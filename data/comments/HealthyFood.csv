HealthyFood,3e0zvv,robotmirrornine,5,Tue Jul 21 03:06:33 2015 UTC,"Agreeing about the fruit; it's just nature's grab and go food. And a dried fruit/nut trail mix might be good to have on hand (not the kind with m&ms!). I drive a lot for work and started keeping interesting granola bars and things in my car.  Preparing stuff the night before would probably best, though. Like a sandwich for the road, or these tasty 4-ingredient breakfast bars. They're really easy to prepare, taste good at basically any temperature, travel well, and aren't loaded with junk. Plus you can make them so many different ways, with different kinds of dried fruits or nuts, throw in some ginger, go crazy with the tasty spices (curry?)...  Anyway, hope that helps.  (Also, I'm hearing more and more evidence that it's probably just fine to skip breakfast or eat late. Unless you are super hungry in the mornings. Then you should eat for sure.)  EDIT: a word"

What I do is batch cook breakfast burritos and egg mcmuffins and freeze them. They reheat in the microwave in 2 minutes and are delicious. You can make them pretty healthy too.   For the mcmuffins, I use an English muffin with whipped egg whites and basil (cooked in a muffin tin to get that circular shape, plus you can cook a bunch at once), a piece of cheddar cheese, and a slice of Canadian bacon. I usually have a green juice to accompany this.   For the burritos, I use the tortillaland tortillas (so much better than regular!), scrambled egg whites, fajita veggies, cheddar cheese, black beans, and a little crumbled bacon.  Reheat in the microwave at 70% power for 2 minutes with a damp paper towel draped over."

HealthyFood,3e0w3v,Angry_Bruce,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:15 2015 UTC,I think a good start to eating healthy is researching essential vitamins and minerals. There are plenty of lists on pinterest about essential nutrients that you can read that will give you info of what are most essential and what foods provide that nutrients. You can also look for a food product that is rich in a lot of different nutrients like yevo oatmeal that will help you get everything you need for the day.
HealthyFood,3e0w3v,yevointl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:01 2015 UTC,"You're definitely on the right track beginning by counting calories as its a great way to gain an awareness of what a day on your plate should ideally look like. If you're someone who likes to eat a lot then your best bet is to add as many green vegetables into your diet as you can- so salads, kale, spinach, broccoli, green beans. Not only are they relatively cheap, stuffed full of vitamins and very low in calories, with a drizzle of lemon, olive oil and a pinch of salt, pepper and even chilly flakes they can be brought alive and satisfy your taste buds. Another tip for easy vitamins is to add frozen berries to your smoothies as they are also very low in calories and add the most delicious kick. Hope that helps and don't give up. Keep exploring!"
HealthyFood,3dwvzc,Kelov,6,Mon Jul 20 05:12:03 2015 UTC,Sounds healthy except consider getting another kind of cheese. American cheese is not technically cheese because it's made up of more oil than dairy. Maybe swiss or provolone would be a better option.

For context: Personally I am 5'2"", trying to lose weight while eating healthy and average 1200 calories per day so this sub would be about 2 meals worth in a day for me.  Hope this helps"

This website has a calculator to calculate if your calories has changed as well as how many to burn to lose weight or how many to maintain: http://www.caloriecontrol.org/calculator/weight-maintenance-calculator-men  One thing I found which helped me was replacing one meal per day with high fiber with fruit or high veg with a lean protein.

HealthyFood,3dwvzc,Brianna-Girl,-1,Mon Jul 20 20:07:03 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on the type health philosophies you subscribe to. But to really get into this:     Subway sandwiches are extremely caloric. Wholegrain Wheat: It's a grain, it's gluten, it's going to cause inflammation within the body. Chicken breast: Most likely hormone-laden and pumped full of anti-biotics. Cheese: Dairy, the second highest cause of inflammation in the American diet, not to mention filled with hormones and anti-biotics and is quite acidifying to the body as well as being highly caloric. Toasted: I mean if you're going to get REALLY specific about the healthiness of this food, toasting it will kill the enzymes and damage the nutritional integrity of the food. Spinach, lettuce, olives, cucumbers: All good vegetables, but toasted so less nutritious and I highly doubt what they use is organic, so probably pesticide-sprayed, awful for the immune and endocrine system. Pickles: Most likely marinated in spirit vinegar which is unhealthy and sprayed with pesticides. Chipotle sauce: Will most likely have sugar and high-fructose corn syrup which is awful and causes diabetes, not to mention being extremely caloric. Probably the most unhealthy part of the sandwich. As well as being densely caloric, Subway sandwiches are notoriously high in sodium.     Now this is being hyper-critical, obviously not everyone wants to observe their diet this scrupulously. I just wanted to give you some information on everything in the sandwich. :)  If it's something really important to you that you truly enjoy, go for it! Health is important, but you need to be happy too.  It's your responsibility to make an informed decision. :) Enjoy!"
HealthyFood,3dwvzc,Tanath,2,Mon Jul 20 13:02:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, gluten is fine for most people unless you have an uncommon allergy to it. Gluten-sensitivity may not be a thing. More likely it's FODMAPs, in particular fructans in modern wheat that are the problem."
HealthyFood,3dwvzc,Brianna-Girl,0,Mon Jul 20 13:49:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I have to say though, from what I've read, I think that most people have gluten-sensitivity to some degree. I'm not talking a full blown allergy or Celiac's, but some inflammation in the gut and digestive issues. It's believed that about 50% of the American population has some degree of gluten-sensitivity, since the industry has narrowed 80 strains of grain down to 4.  People can get themselves tested, it's specified in Breakthrough, by Suzanne Somers, AMAZING book.  I know the ""gluten-sensitivity"" theory seems really trendy and faddish, but it's actually something I think seems legit. Besides, there's SO much conflicting information about gluten, I prefer to avoid it altogether if I can (says someone who's just finished eating a few crackers because my fridge is empty. :()."
HealthyFood,3dwvzc,Tanath,0,Mon Jul 20 14:43:37 2015 UTC,"It's controversial because it's not known for sure. I don't think the evidence supports gluten-sensitivity as much as people think and there is a competing explanation, which I mentioned. We'll have to wait to be sure, but the point is there's all this marketing and hype and such over gluten and it's overblown with little basis. Maybe they're both problematic, but it seems people are jumping the gun."

I would never say to someone ""STAY AWAY from gluten, it's undeniably dangerous and toxic."" but I honestly do believe that it's best to avoid, just from my own personal research.  For me, it's better safe than sorry. I do believe it causes inflammation, but it's everyone's responsibility to conduct their own personal research."

HealthyFood,3dc4em,Onehundredyearsold,8,Wed Jul 15 02:56:07 2015 UTC,Usually it refers to not putting plastic in the bottom rack of the dishwasher simply because the heating element on the bottom can damage your plastic ware. It's not because of health issue (though melting the plastic isn't smart).  Who is saying plastic is related to insulin resistance / blood pressure? That sounds completely bogus for any household item. We have decades of research on plastics that would have clearly shown any link if one existed.  Microwaving leftovers are perfectly safe.

It made me realize that you put good in, you get good out.  Some people say you get this ""tiger blood"" energy. I'm generally about as high energy as a border collie, so I didn't notice extra energy. However, I noticed that I was more efficient. I do a lot of running.

The first few days were a bit hard just because I had to break my junky habits, but after that, I started to feel so much better. My skin was clearer (although that varies from person to person), I felt more energetic and it also helped me eat more regularly. Typically, I drink coffee until about 2-3 pm and then start to eat. My normal eating habits are so bad, so this was a really good way for me to learn about different foods and their effects on my body and just how to eat like a healthy human. I didn't really lose weight either time (I'm 5 ft 8, 118 lbs and wasn't doing it for weight loss) but I just noticed my body was happy on the inside.    I'd definitely recommend it if you want to try it. It isn't for everyone and does require a certain level of discipline, but it was fun!

Use a fork to scrape out the flesh - itll naturally come out like thin noodles. Yum!"
HealthyFood,3cwf6q,Raltie,5,Tue Jul 14 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, you sound exactly like me, cept I cottoned on early because my girlfriend forced me to change my ways.  Re Veggies, try them raw. It's weird, but that's how I started eating them. I couldn't deal with them turning to mush in my mouth. Carrot sticks and cellery sticks are good to start with. Stop eating potato, its really hard but makes a difference. If you drink soda give it up or switch to diet (diet is just as bad in its own way, but its going to take longer to kill you than sticking with the sugar version).   Do you like chilli? If you do cover a bunch of veggies in oil and chilli sauce and roast those bad boys. They will taste like chilli and you still get veggie points.   I'm trying Paleo at the moment, I feel shitloads better if I don't have potato, breads or refined sugar, but I mess up enough to not have lost much weight.  Get in touch with nature, if you can get in a car and drive to a nature reserve. Take a short walk down any track and stop for a while, take in the beauty of the place. The more time you spend enjoying nature outdoors the healthier you'll be.  Good luck."

HealthyFood,3cwf6q,technicaldifficulty,2,Sat Jul 11 18:39:39 2015 UTC,"Having meats isn't necessarily bad- they can be very filling. Try to minimize any sauces you're putting on them (BBQ, dipping sauces, etc) and aim for more spice centric dishes. A great example would be making Rosemary Lemon Chicken (like this) rather than hot wings. I also love roasted veggies- but they might seem mushy to you.  What types of food do you like eating? I might be able to offer some possible substitutions to your regular meals that would be easier to stomach. And of course, if you're not doing it already, start cutting out flavored drinks (like juices or sodas). They're not bad in moderation but it's an easy first step to make."

I'm not sure if they'll mess with your cholesterol (I've heard mixed things about eggs), but it's a great way to slowly introduce veggies into your diet. They can also retain more of their crunchiness in a bake.  If you like salsa/chili, quinoa bowls are great. You put down a base of cooked quinoa (if you don't like the texture you could mix it with potatoes at first) and layer ground meat/roasted or sautéed vegetables. Then put some salsa on top and if you want you can top with a poached egg. Really delicious and mainly just taste like salsa-y goodness. If you want some crunchier textures add some toasted nuts or a few tortilla chips."
HealthyFood,3cwf6q,Qingxiao,2,Sat Jul 11 23:57:30 2015 UTC,"See a professional dietician is my advice-insurance should cover it... Use my fitness pal or cron-o-meter to track your calories/nutrient intake. Then get a gym membership or pickup a sport/activity you will do regularly.  Get a personal trainer if you can afford it.    Stock your house only with health food.   You're going to have to force yourself to make changes to your diet and you can control how you take the experience. You are not a slave to your impulses but neither are you total master.  IMO Zevia brand sodas tastes better than almost all the other 0 calorie sodas and uses safer ingredients. Keep drinking water though-even diet sodas and other non calorie sweets CHANGE your taste to prefer sweets. It also helps me to think of how much time and money a restaraunt is stealing from me by charging me out the ass for cheap, unhealthy soda.   Also note you can't just eat any food because they don't have sugars-your high cholesterol and blood pressures see to that-your overall diet MUST change if you are to improve. EG eat more high nutrient density vegetables, beans/lentils, nuts/seeds  and some fruit and change your meats to lean meats.   Breakdown of the foods you mentioned...baked beans have lots of added sugar and sodium. Try any low sodium regular beans and add your own salt free spices/spice blends. Corn and potatoes are high sugar, low nutrient vegetables.  Reduce them for other veggies-Sweet potatoes are preferable to regular potatoes. Carrots are fine.  Green beans are good, peas are ok. GREENS are king for nutrient density per calorie, kale, cabbage, spinach etc...The top nuts and seeds to eat are walnuts, flaxseeds (ground- I like to add a few tbsp to smoothies, chia is a good sub), sunflower seeds, a single brazil nut a day, and pecans, but there are no really ""bad"" nuts/seeds unless they are fried/sugared/salted to hell. Take it as a challenge. Would peas really make you vomit if you were eating them as a sport? Or could you eat a ton of them? Also you can change their texture by cooking them less-perhaps just blanch fresh/fresh frozen ones. Fruit: berries are king....strawberries, blueberries, raspberries. Almost all fruit is fine except when you eat a ton of the high sugar ones.  http://nutritionfacts.org/video/what-causes-diabetes/"

I find that it sort of stretches out the eating experience and lets me enjoy more of it.  It's sort of along the same lines of eating small cubes of meat or small pieces of candy(think the now-popular ""Bites"" that come in zip-seal bag versus their corresponding candy bars); it's the same amount, but it seems like spreading it out makes it more enjoyable and tasty.

HealthyFood,3cq59s,givemebackmybrain,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:58:22 2015 UTC,It's a pretty light flavor especially when mixed with something much more intense like marinara or alfredo type sauces.  However if you really don't like zucchini this is one of those things you may not be able to disguise enough.  Are there other vegetables you could spiralize which you do like?

If you do a diet and lose weight then go back to the old way, you'll gain back the weight, with or without exercise. Gradual change is best, or if you do choose to flip overnight do something you can maintain. Choose foods you actually enjoy eating that are healthy and stick to those, and don't have a list of foods you can't have.   One thing that has helped for me (while quitting soda) was that I said ""I can have a soda if I want, but I don't want to. I want to be healthy instead."" Keep that in mind when times get rough, as they inevitably will.  Good luck!"

The Casein protein found in dairy binds with antioxidants in the stomach and flushes them out. Blocking their absorption. This is why yogurt in smoothies is a terrible idea. And also why cheese on your veggies should be avoided.

HealthyFood,3cahmz,alenagamolko,5,Mon Jul 6 11:22:15 2015 UTC,Right. I only skimmed through the text but to answer your question - unless you plan staying vegan after you have lost weight I don't see the point. Losing weight is pretty easy from my experience. It's finding and keeping the right habits after you are of healthy weight that makes it hard. If you go vegan for weight loss and then go back to your old habits afterwards you haven't really learned anything?  On the other hand lots of vegan recipes are super good for you. As a part time vegetarian I think everyone should eat vegetarian and vegan sometimes :)
HealthyFood,3cahmz,nannanaa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:10:35 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you! I enjoy some vegan and vegetarian dish as well. As long as you eat whole natural foods most of the time with the right calorie, you will lose weight."
HealthyFood,3cahmz,fitwithmindy,3,Mon Jul 6 13:21:29 2015 UTC,Sometimes cutting down on meat really helps people lose weight... Sometimes it's the opposite; just really depends on your body. Keep in mind that vegan isn't automatically the answer to health. Most potato chips and French fries are vegan. Oreos are vegan.  Simply eating mindfully and planning your meals is usually the best way to go.
HealthyFood,3cahmz,Sledgehammers,2,Mon Jul 6 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's great when anyone wants to eat less meat. But the truth is calories are what matters when it comes to weight loss. You can still over eat on a vegan diet. Some people make the mistake of just replacing the meat with more carbs and that can get pretty caloriffic. So, you need to balance your diet carefully.  That being said, I transitioned to vegetarian about 5 and 1/2 years ago with long streches of being more strict vegan. In my first year I lost about 20 lbs without really trying. I mean, take that for what its worth...  If I were you, I'd check out the vegetarian,  vegan, and veg/vegan recipe subs. and if you have protein concerns, the people at r/veganfitness have that pretty well figured out.   I also recommend downloading myfitnesspal and counting calories. They will also give you suggestions on macros and things like that."

The trend may be stupid, but those who eat gluten free as a fad diet are not hurting themselves, others, or the economy in any way, so I'm OK with it. The only exception is where I will find a person trying to lose weight or have a healthier diet, and they think binge eating rice chips, pasta, bread etc is OK.

OR I get people who just don't take allergies seriously anymore. I can't blame them; celiac disease is pretty rare(but it happens) but everyone is on this gluten-free diet.

I find it has gotten easier explaining to people what it is (and I always explain that I got diagnosed by a doctor it is not because I believe in a health fad) and easier going out. And that is nice. You don't want to be to much of a burden when you get invited out, or when you go with people to a restaurant so it is nice that those choices are increasing. People go like ""oh, my aunt have that.

Kids like the food they are used to and that is cooked well. Not necessarily junk.   Kids didn't only start eating when junk food was invented

If it had more than 5 ingredients, if it had ingredients I couldn't pronounce (or didn't know what they were), if it was made with white flour, or if it had added refined sugar....it was out. Then, I started experimenting with different veggies to see what I liked and didn't like. I try one new fruit and one new veggie every week. The only fruit I haven't liked so far is papaya. The only vegetable I haven't liked so far is okra."

HealthyFood,3btecd,fitwithmindy,6,Thu Jul 2 14:34:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks to Ronald Reagan ketchup is considered a vegetable as far as school lunches are concerned!  Unless that has since been changed.  I used to volunteer with the summer lunch program here (when it was at the local YMCA) and the food was catered by a local grocery store.  We had real fruit (although usually canned), real vegetables (again mostly canned or frozen, unless we had baby carrots or salad), a protein and a grain for every meal (I think). Milk was also served. The meals I helped with were quite nutritionally sound. But, I think the head of the program tried to follow the same rules as during the school year (she is the head of the food program for the schools).  The one thing that was surprising was that the protein serving was the smaller size (for younger kids) for everyone, and not the larger size for older kids.  At first, we were giving out too much of the main dish, and not having enough food.  We thought we were being shorted by our food provider, but instead we realized that we were serving too much food, and had to cut back our serving sizes.  I haven't helped with the program for a few years, and it is now based out of one of the school cafeterias. They serve both breakfast and lunch.  But, I am sure the food is just as nutritionally sound as when I helped.  Were the meals perfect? No.  But, a pickle would not count as a vegetable, and a slushie (even if 100% juice) would not count as a fruit.  Sometimes there were cookies and/or fudge bars or something for dessert.  Then, one of the volunteers had to be the ""dessert police"" and make sure that each child took only one desert!  But, yes it is sad what schools can get away with as far as providing nutritional meals.  I know there was a show on T.V. for a while where Gordon Ramsey (I think, maybe it was another British chef) took over an american school cafeteria to make healthy foods and get kids to eat them.  One episode he made some sort of pasta dish that was loaded with veggies.  The head cook told him that he didn't have enough vegetables in his meal.  I guess the pasta didn't count as a vegetable for some reason.  The cook said there weren't enough veggies in it, even though it was over 50% veggies.  So, the cook quickly made some french fries in order to obey the 'law' and have a vegetable with the meal.  I also know that some of the cooks were skeptical of what he wanted to make--thinking it would take WAY more time/effort than reheating the pre-made junk they usually served, and also thinking the kids would never eat the healthier foods.  I think he sometimes had two options--one the usual junk and one his fresh made healthy stuff to show that kids liked his stuff as well or better than the old stuff.  Also, he encouraged the cooks to actually cook rather than just reheat.  Sometimes it worked out, other times it didn't.  However, it did shed light on how bad the food is in many schools in this country.  And, for kids on the free/reduced lunch/breakfast programs, that food might very well be all they get to eat in a day.  It should be healthy!"
HealthyFood,3btecd,SidViciious,3,Thu Jul 2 01:42:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, that was Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution. I just finished watching both seasons of it. That is what inspired me to say something in the first place. The way they are skirting the guidelines with these ""nutritious"" foods sickens me. How hard is it to make a salad? How hard is it to provide fresh vegetables or whole pieces of fruit?"
HealthyFood,3btecd,mitsene,7,Thu Jul 2 05:08:27 2015 UTC,"I know I'll get down voted for this, but . . . ""How hard is it to provide fresh vegetables or whole pieces of fruit?"" - Instead of bitching and moaning about this type of thing - why not try and answer this question for yourself and volunteer. I agree with everything you are saying about nutrition and education about food, but this question is really the crux of it all. Some kids (a great deal in inner cities) will be lucky to get a meal from organizations like this summer program. As much as it sucks there's a great deal of red tape and govt bureaucracy involved in programs like this. Funding, partnerships, back room deals with larger companies, etc. You might be surprised how ""hard it is to provide"" period."
HealthyFood,3btecd,CrunchySushi,3,Thu Jul 2 10:36:45 2015 UTC,"First off, I don't think anyone should get down voted for their opinion, especially when I requested it. I will tell you that I volunteered for years in our local school system, I worked for Boys and Girls Club for three years, and I volunteer with our drug prevention program. Plus, I'm a single mom raising two kids, and I'm a writer with three jobs. I do what I can.  Secondly, trying to get answers is what I did. That is why I sent the first questions in. If you remember, my original questions were not about the school lunch program specifically, but to the nonprofit organization that is trying to fight childhood obesity with some controversial billboards. If you're going to depict the naked abdomen of a child holding their overweight stomach and put beside it ""Marion We Have a Problem"", offering no website, advice, or proper comma placement, then you should be able to answer a question about this. I mean, how do you say you want to fight childhood obesity and yet you can't even answer a question about a call to action for the nutrition in our schools.  I completely understand the red tape. I understand the issues they deal with. And, I understand that change may have to come from above, but this can be done at a local level. There are other schools who have been able to plant gardens, teach kids about nutrition in the classroom, while also switching to whole, clean ingredients in their schools. Just throwing up your hands and saying ""It's too complicated"" or ""It's good enough"" is not good enough. Sometimes, the only meal these kids get are the ones they get at school, or it is their only chance to get healthy food. So, why are we perpetuating the idea that junk food is okay?  As I said in my original statement, the summer program and the school lunch programs are great because they feed children. However, the logic that the food service director gives me about their choices is not great. I know that somethings have to start at home, but if the schools and parents share the same mentality -- well, we can't serve them that because they won't eat it -- then how can someone fault the parents and not the schools?"

Usually, if I want to stretch my trips to the grocery store, I'll buy two extra salmon steaks, bake them, and then either freeze them or keep them in the fridge for an extra couple of days. Salmon steaks can be cooked, frozen, and then thawed to use in salads and pastas."

HealthyFood,3bo0qj,gabbyrosh,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:24:12 2015 UTC,"Hey there :) chicken breast is a good healthy food to have on hand. You can buy it in bulk and freeze it until you need it, and all you really need to make it taste good is some olive oil, salt and pepper, and maybe some garlic powder or seasoning of your choice. You can stir fry it with some frozen veggies, grill it, whatever. Add some microwave brown rice, or some cauliflower. I love roasted cauliflower, just cut it up into little florets, season however, and bake at 400 F until golden on top. Its a great source of fiber, and very low carb. Eggs and peanut butter are relatively cheap and filled with protein and good fats, and bananas can come as cheap as 39 cents a pound. Those are my reccomendations for affordable daily staple foods. In terms of recipes, I reccomend the hungry girl website or book. You can find plenty of lightened up versions of whatever comfort food you love. Hope that helps!"

HealthyFood,3bo0qj,fitwithmindy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:11:11 2015 UTC,"So let's break down the foods into carb, protein, and fat:   Carb: frozen or canned veggies, any veggies in season (typically cheaper), frozen fruits, bananas (cheapest fruits), any fruits in season, potatoes (cheap and healthy), brown rice or just white rice, beans (humble and healthy), whole wheat or just white pasta, whole wheat bread/tortilla wrap.   Protein: ground meat in bulk, frozen chicken breast in bulk, frozen fish in bulk, any meat or fish that are on sale, plain Greek yogurt, fat free cheese, low fat or fat free cottage/ricotta cheese, eggs, egg whites, canned fish, etc.   Fat: olive oil in bulk, peanut butter, coconut oil in bulk, butter, sunflower seeds, peanuts, almonds from middle eastern store, avocado when on sale, etc.   Try to shop food from these groups and simply bake/poach/braise/stir fry/slow cook your protein, potatoes, and veggies. Cook rice/beans/pasta in bulk. Combine them add in oil or other fat source based upon your macro needs.   For some healthy recipes to start, you can check them out here. I post simple and healthy recipes every Friday. You can apply the braised veggie recipes for both protein and any veggies. You can apply the poached salmon recipe for most proteins especially seafoods. You can obviously get large variety from the stir fry recipe. Basically I make recipes so that way other people can use them for similar foods. Hopefully this helps and good luck!"
HealthyFood,3bo0qj,kjcarr1000,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:36:05 2015 UTC,"Here are a few of my favorite healthy cookbooks: Fresh and Refresh, the BEST vegetarian cookbook series in my opinion. Also I like Hungry Girl series, and it is economical. It is worth your while to learn to cook and to cook 1 meal a day. Otherwise breakfast is usually simple like oatmeal or eggs, a wrap or salad for lunch, healthy snacks like string cheese or hummus and carrots and then the one meal you made yourself. If you are not feeding others then it could last a few days. Hope that helps. Good luck with your studies."

If you're interested in keeping data, you could make a record of what you're eating, and see what the nutritional content is like. You could gradually reduce your meat intake through one of the methods you suggested, or you could try cutting out meat for a while and gradually re-introduce it if your data suggests that you are struggling with deficiencies.  If you aren't interested in keeping records or will struggle to maintain them for whatever reason, you might find it easier to simply concentrate on learning more vegetarian recipes, experiment with vegetarian substitutes, and buying more vegetarian protein sources and a smaller amount of meat. Your suggestion of one red meat, one white meat, and one fish sounds reasonable to me, though it depends on the amount of each.  Also, you might find it easier to get a clear head from an ethical standpoint if you trial being fully vegetarian for a couple of months. It avoids guilt-induced rationalisation, and will help you feel more comfortable in your ethical choices. It will also help you understand how to get sufficient nutrition without using meat as a crutch when you don't know what else to cook.  Good luck."

HealthyFood,3afb6i,SpaceJockey1979,2,Fri Jun 19 18:35:44 2015 UTC,"That depends on what you want to do.  If you want to get the nutrients out of 5 pounds of fruits and veggies, you obviously can't drink that much smoothie. But could easily juice it all.  And with a good juicer you wouldn't oxidize or burn many nutrients. It could also be saved for lunch, or in the fridge till morning.  But if you had a hand full of berries and an apple, you would get more benefit from a smoothie since you could use the fiber. Just make sure you put in ice to keep it cold and not destroy the nutrients, and make sure you drink it right away or it will oxidize.  Both are good for you and should be used, neither is better."

Most don't really care to eat like this, but I just cook a ton of fish or whatever at the beginning of the week, some sort of side dish, and have that for like 4 days, then do the same with a different dish for the other 3. So I only cook twice per week.  For lunch I just slice up a bunch of veggies at the beginning of the week, then portion it out along with some avocado, chicken/tuna/tofu and have salads for lunch.  Overall pretty low-cal, but I eat a shitload of trail mix to make it to the 2400ish that I need per day. On gym days I have protein shakes and snack on the stuff they provide at my office."

Usually I have food that's easily thrown together, like tonight we had sautéed tofu and corn on the cob, took maybe 15 minutes. I also keep a lot of snacks around so I don't have to eat big meals (fruits and raw veggies mostly) and that helps a ton at keeping me from getting too hungry before I'm able to cook a quick dinner."

So instead on Sundays I prepare a batch of soup, veggie burgers, rice/veggie dishes, quiche, tofu-muffin-cup type things and either refrigerate or freeze them. You can do this for dinner as well. Staple grains like beans + quinoa keep really well in the fridge, and IMO beans taste better after a couple days. I also freeze soups and pasta sauces to have on hand on days when I don't have time for cooking dinner. Just check to see what you're refrigerating/freezing keeps well (i.e. don't freeze spaghetti). Some food blogs have sections specifically for ""freezer foods"", so check those out!"

HealthyFood,39z3pq,LanimalRawrs,2,Tue Jun 16 14:23:27 2015 UTC,"Usually the whole afternoon. I try to multitask, so while beans/soup is cooking I might have something in the oven, or on another stove burner. So maybe 4-6 hours including prep and clean up. A lot of that time is hands-off, just checking on food every half hour or so to make sure it's not burning and to adjust seasonings. You could also invest in a slow cooker, which is also mostly hands-off."
HealthyFood,39z3pq,coffeecupschooner,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:10:34 2015 UTC,"I also do cook day on Sunday.  Depending what I've chosen to make, it usually takes about 4-6 hours.  In that time I'll make a breakfast, a light lunch, a one-pot type dinner and sometimes a snack. It gets a little dull eating the same thing all week, and sometimes I'll find that I've made something I really don't like, so I allow myself one cheat lunch and one cheat dinner per week."
HealthyFood,39z3pq,monkeypamper,2,Tue Jun 16 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"I just make sure that I have easy healthy food in the house! I do that by going to the grocery store once a week, figuring out the 3-4 dinners I want that week and making a list. I make sure I have enough for every meal so I don't cheat and eat out! I get a lot of inspiration for recipes on Pinterest and go for healthy & few ingredients. For breakfast I might have a poached egg (which you can make in 50 seconds in a mug in the microwave) with toast. For lunch I might have a salad packed with veggies, seeds, and a low-cal dressing (even better make your own!) with a side of soup (that I made a big batch of for dinner the night before). For dinner I definitely like variety, but I make enough for leftovers so I don't have to cook every night. I'm also a biiiggg snacker so I'll buy nuts, seeds, raisins, etc in bulk and make my own trail mix. I also love those tiny orange things (cuties?) because they're quick healthy snacks. Maybe some hard-boiled eggs... cheese stick...the options are limitless! I also allow myself to cheat and eat unhealthy. However, over time I crave fast food less and less. But I still crave well-made food at restaurants & when you get better at cooking you'll love to recreate those meals at home. I'll totally still buy some Ben & Jerry's to have a few spoonfuls during the week when I want. It's about balancing & not getting burnt out."

I prep dinners and lunches for the week, and a few components for breakfasts.   Also, I like to cook, so I do cook a little every night; my dinners is more prep, and not 100% finished.   That said, I think meal planning is super useful! Even if you don't want to bulk cook dinners, knowing that I have a plan makes it so much easier, just because it takes a thinking component out of it ( I guess!)."
HealthyFood,39xcm1,Cazargar,2,Mon Jun 15 15:54:48 2015 UTC,Frontload the work! This applies in many areas of life but also works well for eating.  1) Chop up all your vegatables 2-3 in advance you want eat/cook them.  2) POT FOOD! Soups/Chilis/Stews! Buy a lot of tupperware and freeze some and save it for the week!  3) Honestly if you want to eat a lot of veggies plan for at least a few trips to the grocery store every week! It's what I usually do..(Fortunately mine is a 3 minute drive down the road)  4) Frozen Peas are everyone's friends  5) INDIAN FOOD! You want to cut down on meat Indian has lots of Tasty Vegetarian Options!  6) Stir fry veggies! Also Good! If you do the preparation in advance the actual stir fry time takes around 5-10 minutes! You can also throw in SMALL portions of meat in there of course!
HealthyFood,39xcm1,Bofonic,2,Mon Jun 15 19:45:05 2015 UTC,"Cooking for one means that you can repeat meals as often as you want and don't have to consider the palate of others.  I made my favorites in bulk and fridge/freeze leftovers for lunches and  dinners. You can also get used to shopping for fresh fruit and veg more often, but buying smaller quantities.    When it comes to meal planning, it's pretty simple.  Start with a list of your favorite meals, healthy and unhealthy.  Find out if you can make healthier versions of your favorite unhealthy meals (yes, pizza  and fried chicken can be healthfied!)  Collect the recipes into a bookmarks folder or pinterest board.  Write down or use a system like OneNote or Evernote to create weekly lists.  There you can combine meals based on ingredients, for example buying one bunch of celery and including it in a soup one day, salad another, as a snack, and in a stir fry.  Include the meals and ingredients necessary in weekly lists on your note app/notebook.  Try to start with three weeks of meals and build from there.  Adjust as needed and be sure to include snacks, toiletries, cooking supplies like plastic wrap, etc.    Plan to invest a couple hours on it, but you don't have to do it all at once."
HealthyFood,39xcm1,babettebaboon,2,Mon Jun 15 20:55:19 2015 UTC,"I think you should try meal prep!  Select your favorite protein sources (chicken breast, turkey breast, etc). Bake, boil or steam them.   Select your favorite vegetables ( broccoli, green beans, asparagus, etc). Steam, bake or boil them.   Select your favorite carb sources ( potatoes, beans, rice, pata, etc).  Cook them in bulk.   Buy your favorite fat sources ( avocados, nuts/seeds, peanut butter, etc).   So once you cook all of them, you just put the right amount of protein, carb, vegetables and fat in each container based upon your macro goals.   You can leave the food for the next two days in the fridge then freeze the rest. After each day, you take out one day worth of meal from the freeze and put in the fridge. Then you will have healthy food for the whole week.   Hopefully this helps!"
HealthyFood,39wry4,NicholasFarseer,2,Mon Jun 15 13:02:18 2015 UTC,"This is my typical breakfast, and not only is it extremely filling, it is packed with protein and high-fiber carbs. I do my strength training early (5:30-6:30), so this is a perfect way to finish off my workouts and start the day:  Avocado Omelette: (I typically eyeball the veggie amounts, but this is really close)    1 tsp canola oil (or other high-heat oil)  1 medium egg  1 serving of egg whites  2 oz cubed Kirkland roasted turkey breast (purchase a whole roasted breast, and cut into cubes or slices, depending on the meal)  1/4 cup diced bell peppers  1/4 cup diced hot peppers (usually a combo of jalapeno and habenero)  1/2 C sliced baby portobellos or button mushrooms  1/4 C diced red onion  1/2 sliced tomato  1/2 ripe avocado   Warm oil in non-stick pan on medium heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low, and add turkey and peppers. Sautee for a few minutes until browned.  Add mushrooms and onions. Continue to sautee until the mushrooms and onions have softened.  Beat egg into egg whites, and season with salt and pepper if you'd like.  Pour mixture over the cooked meat and veggies and shake the pan until they float on the egg. Use a spatula to spread around any clusters.  When the egg has hardened, place sliced tomatoes along one half.  Mash the avocado in a bowl and season to taste. I like to use Konriko Jalapeno Salt - it's a fantastic avocado addition. Spread the mashed avocado on the other half of the omelette.   Let the tomato and avocado warm up for a minute or so, then fold the omelette from the pan onto your plate.   I typically top the omelette with diced tomato (the top and bottom of the tomato I sliced to put inside the omelette) and green onion.

Weigh it down with something heavy so it stays submerged and let it stand covered in a cool place for about four weeks.

The calorie by itself is 199 but if you add rice or pasta, it will be around 389, so still under 400 calories.   You basically need   canned tuna (one can per serving)  olive oil   soy sauce, cooking wine   chopped onion, garlic minced   1 zucchini   2 bell peppers   6 mushroom sliced   1 cup frozen broccoli   seasonings   You basically just heat a frying pan under high heat, then you pour in oil, garlic and onion. Let it cook for 2 -3 min.   Then you pour in broccoli and zucchini, season then let it cook for 5 min.   Then you pour in bell peppers and mushroom, season and add soy sauce and cooking wine. Let it cook for another 5 min.   Then you add in the tuna, mix well then season again.   Then you turn off the stove and let it sit for 10 min or so.   Then you can eat it without carbs if you are on low carb or you can mix it with any carb source you desire (rice, pasta, etc. )  If you are interested in checking out the recipe video, you can click here.  Hopefully you guys find this recipe useful!"

HealthyFood,39p4w8,pearlchavez,9,Sat Jun 13 11:45:25 2015 UTC,"Hey there! I was in the same boat a few years ago until I wound up in the military, where not eating your veggies resulted in much worse consequences than the taste of broccoli. Here's what I did to get to healthier eating, maybe it'll help you:  First, I spent a lot of time listing dishes and things I actually do eat often and their ingredients. Then I dug around researching what kind of vegetables I could sneak in there without noticing. I figured ""if moms do this to get their picky kids to eat it, why can't I fool myself?""  Gradually I put more and more veg in or had a blatantly veggie recipe. I found I'd already gotten used to the flavor, hidden as it was, and it wasn't terrible. I kind of enjoyed it actually, and set about messing around with recipes to make different flavors come out of the dish. In the end I was (and am) eating a lot better, though I still sneak in something terrible for me occasionally.  Tl;dr: try doing what moms do and sneak in your foods, also find recipes featuring the thing you want to eat and tweak to your liking. I recommend vegetarian sites; they're very creative within the limitations they have and make some really cool stuff."

HealthyFood,39p4w8,randomAnonymousThing,3,Sat Jun 13 14:31:58 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  I don't know if you are familiar with this condition, but it sounds like you have Selective Eating Disorder. I used to/still have it, but overcame it in many ways, it was a long and tiresome process and I still struggle, specially with fruits, but here are some ways you can include fruits and vegetables in your diet that you may not notice:   Do you eat tomato sauce in your pasta? If so, make your own tomato sauce (I can give you a recipe if you want), throw in collard greens (spinach, kale, etc) while blending them, you will not notice it. To be honest, I to anything I blend and cook. Try this cake. You can use regular sugar instead of the coconut one they recommend, I promise you, you will not taste the blueberries. It is one of the best chocolate cakes you will ever have! Do you drink protein or vitamin shakes? If not, look to getting one that suits your needs, it tastes like milk shakes, add a handful of berries (preferably frozen) in there, I promise you, you won't taste it and if it's chocolate flavored, you won't even see them. How do you feel about potatoes? If you do like them, try boiling broccoli and/or cauliflower (just boil them for about 10-20 minutes before blending them in), add them whenever you mash the potatoes, I promise you, you won't taste them If you like white sauce, try this recipe Try these truffles   Although you may get away with fooling your body into eating that stuff, it still does not get to the root of the issue. I highly recommend you also tackle the root of the issue so that you don't have all these limitations placed upon you. Here are some of the things that I did:   Try to challenge yourself with a new food. Basically you take a bite of it everyday, start increasing the bite and eventually you it will stop making you gag. I started doing this with baby carrots, I would eat one a day for about a month, later increased it to two a day, and now I can eat carrots without a problem, mind you, I don't necessarily like them, but I can eat them without a problem. I did the same thing with berries, broccoli and cauliflower. The last two I actually learned to like and they are a regular part of my meals. Sometimes you don't hate the vegetable/fruit itself, but you do hate how you prepared them. Try making them in different ways and maybe you will find a way to lake them. For example, I find the roasted broccoli is absolutely awesome! For the longest time I only ate boiled broccoli. For fruits you might have an easier time eating them covered in chocolate or whipped cream for example. It will allow you to get used to their taste and texture, and it does work for a lot of people. Finally, they say SED has a lot to do with anxiety and it is caused by something. It is highly recommended you go to therapy of some sort to find the source of that anxiety. I heard from support groups from Facebook that hypnotherapy is awesome, personally I've never done it, but they do say it does miracles to those who have SED.   That is all I could think of for now, hopefully some of this information is helpful. If you have any questions in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Best of luck at reforming your diet :)"

There are different ways of cooking veggies and fruit too. Does your family typically buy fresh veggies or frozen or canned veggies? Growing up I would refuse to eat veggies that came canned as they tasted like saw dust. Frozen veggies had no flavor unless covered in sauce. But fresh veggies were much better. To this day my mom is amazed I eat peas (though if not fresh I still abandon them on my plate).

HealthyFood,37pvx1,squid_actually,7,Tue Jun 2 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"0% for eating, 2% for use as a spread/topping (e.g. on crackers with smoked salmon or as a baked potato topping).  2% is good, but it's too rich for just having as a snack. I feel like I'm eating sour cream with a spoon. It tastes good, sure, but it's doesn't feel like something you just eat all by itself to me, the same way icing is good but I'd never eat a bowl of it with a spoon. There's just that mental block getting in the way of it being objectively delicious.  I also get plain. I like the taste of it by itself, and I also like variety, so plain lets me mix in whatever I like -- fruit, honey, jam, cocoa powder, vanilla or other extracts, savoury things (miso paste and Greek yogurt! yuummm) -- without worrying about competing or working with whatever flavour the yogourt is.  I eat Greek yogourt largely for the protein (I like it generally, for sure, but I'd eat a lot less if it weren't so high in protein), so I like that plain 0% is really low in calories, too. I like sweet things, so I'd rather have some plain Greek yogourt with sliced strawberries and a little cookie later than have 2% vanilla yogourt with the strawberries -- breakfast is breakfast regardless of if it's more sweet or less sweet, but a nibbling at a cookie with coffee is a beautiful, peaceful 20 or 30 minutes of my day.  I think I want another coffee now."

I'd rather sweeten my yogurt lightly with maple syrup or honey and some fruit (although I do love the flavored ones as an occasional treat).   I'll probably switch to 0% since I get plenty of healthy fats and vitamin A. As I mentioned in response to another comment below, I get plenty of it from fruits/veggies and since it's summer, not so worried about vitamin D.  Thanks! :)"
HealthyFood,37pvx1,squid_actually,2,Fri May 29 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"I think the way to go is to buy the larger tubs of plain yogurt (or make your own!) and sweeten them with fruit, honey, or jam.

HealthyFood,37pvx1,mapleandvanilla,2,Fri May 29 15:30:21 2015 UTC,It depends on the day at my grocery store. Yogurt is marked down almost all the time in some size or another. Buy whatever makes sense for you.  Just saw op posted the same thing.

Why do they make the labels so similar? And it always seems to be when it's marked down (""woo! discount Greek yogourt!"" grabs two), so then I've got dessert-y yogourt that needs to be eaten fairly quickly, and all my savoury options (dips, dressings, and spreads, oh my!) are closed to me.  Usually vanilla yogourt in my fridge means pancakes time. All the better now that the strawberries in the garden are ripe for picking!"

HealthyFood,37o5o8,paddy_o_lantern,3,Fri May 29 02:40:59 2015 UTC,Lol thanks
HealthyFood,37o5o8,intangiblemango,4,Fri May 29 02:43:36 2015 UTC,"Definitely read the FAQ in /r/loseit, also. It's a pretty handy FAQ."
HealthyFood,37o5o8,ChirishFriendo,5,Fri May 29 02:58:24 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite snacks are vegetables and dips, specifically carrots and hummus. All types of vegetables and dips work. Some other dip ideas are tzatziki or salad dressing (my favorite brand is Bolthouse because it's made with yogurt and is low in calories). Some vegetable ideas are celery, cucumbers, peppers, or really anything you have available.   Jerky is also a really great snack. I like Trader Joe's buffalo jerky.   Wrap some deli meat up and dip it in mustard. Add a pickle or eat a pickle plain.  Sauté some spinach with garlic! It takes 5 minutes and is delicious.   Buy frozen vegetable bags and heat them up in the microwave.  Buy single servings of trail mix, cottage cheese, jello, yogurt so that it's easy to grab this and not measure out portions.  Have an open face sandwich that is heavy on the veggies and light on the dairy.   Have healthy swaps available. A lot of companies make popped versions of crackers and chips - they really do work when you're trying to crush your craving and vegetables aren't cutting it.  I buy these things in bulk at Costco: seaweed salad, tabouli, and vegetarian grape leaves. If you have a membership, a friend that has a membership, or access to instacart delivering in your area, I recommend it."

HealthyFood,37o5o8,Purple10tacle,2,Fri May 29 03:55:41 2015 UTC,"Turkey bites are also awesome, but kind of pricey.   Buy turkey breast, chop into strips, marinate in Teriyaki sauce, fry it up, put the turkey strips in the fridge and snack on them whenever you feel peckish. Healthy, cheap and satisfying."
HealthyFood,37o5o8,Pigskin_Ninja,3,Fri May 29 08:50:05 2015 UTC,"Carrot sticks are pretty good and you wont feel guilty about eating a lot of them. They may taste incredibly plain at first but a little ranch dressing or dip on the side helps.  Nuts, while great for you, are pretty high in calories so you have to be careful about portion size.  Popcorn is good to snack on. Just avoid the overly buttered brands.  My personal favorite healthy snack is a sliced apple with peanut butter.  I hope this helps. Good luck!"
HealthyFood,37o5o8,fannytickler,1 point,Fri May 29 02:50:57 2015 UTC,"Fruit! Stuff your face with fruit! It can be a but high in sugar, but it's better than the alternative!  I also enjoy houmous and veggies (my favourites to dunk are peppers and cucumber) the houmous gives you that savoury salty kick and the veggies are sweet and refreshing, jut careful how much houmous you eat, some can be fatty!"
HealthyFood,37o5o8,ToEvadeSlugs,1 point,Fri May 29 12:22:41 2015 UTC,"If you are hungry, eat fruit until you are full. You can and should eat as much as you like. The weight will drop off you, and you will slowly want to start exercising as you get more energy, and you get lighter. Fruit is your friend."
HealthyFood,37o5o8,Purple10tacle,1 point,Fri May 29 14:04:44 2015 UTC,"I was never your size, but at may worst I was Muumuu Homer fat (300lbs, which was considered enormous even by Simpsons standards in 1995).  I have lost 80lbs so far and for my age and height I'm now the ""reasonably healthy but still overweight"" range, there are still some pounds to go.  If you are serious about weight loss, I can give you a few, possibly controversial, tips:   At your current weight, don't torture yourself with exercise yet, both physically and mentally. The calories lost via exercise won't really have much of an impact and you are more likely to either reward yourself with food afterwards or get into the ""didn't make it to the gym today, I guess this is a cheat day then, might as well go to McDonalds"". You can't outrun your fork! Weight loss, especially for very large individuals, is 95% diet. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try to slowly work some more physical work into your routine. Walking places instead of driving should be the first step. You can't fix this with a special, temporary diet, you can't fix this with expensive supplements, this will have to be a permanent lifestyle change. Doing this gradually as you are planning right now  (slowly eating better, slowly exercising more) did not work for me, neither did it work for the vast majority of people I know. Very few success stories on /r/loseit or /r/progresspics begin with ""I slowly worked in some exercise"", the vast majority begins with ""One day I decided to change my life for the better for good"". You know all those studies that seem to suggest that we can trick ourselves into being happy by smiling more or feeling more confident with power poses or by wearing suits? That fake it until you make it attitude works for fat slops like us as well: ""From now on I'm no longer a lazy fat guy, I'm a healthy eater and will act accordingly"" worked for me. Your body won't immediately follow your mindset, but it will follow. Use http://www.myfitnesspal.com as a tool. Get a kitchen scale. Track everything you eat for at least a week, you need to become conscious about what you put into your body. You'll very, very quickly learn what foods to simply cut from your meal plan and which foods are worth the calories. Stick to the things you like and that will keep you satisfied the longest. Gummi bears probably won't, neither will sugary drinks ... bacon, eggs and meat probably will, so they are worth the calories. After the week of MFP, keep using it. Don't buy crap at the supermarket. Once it's in your house you will eat it eventually. Your diet starts in your shopping cart. Never go shopping hungry. Learn to enjoy the satisfaction of filling your cart with fresh produce and healthy snacks. Spend money on quality instead of quantity when it comes to food. Stick to portion sizes! You'll learn that it's a lot easier with high quality and healthy foods. Don't drink your calories. Don't replace coke with fruit juices or coconut water because they sound healthier. They still have a shit ton of calories and no fiber. Drink water. Drink carbonated water. Drink carbonated water with a shot of lime or lemon. Drink tea with no calorie sweetener. Heck, if that doesn't sound appealing switch to diet soda. Fuck vitamins at this point, you're getting enough of those through the sheer quantities you're eating. And your body has a huge amount of them stored that you won't suffer from any deficiencies for a long, long time. Cutting calories is all you need to focus on. Don't drink or eat high caloric items because they sound otherwise ""healthy""! If you want some miracle pills to help you, stick to what is cheap and has been proven to have no negative effects and with scientific studies suggesting that it may even be beneficial. I'm taking 2000mg of L-Carnitine per day because it had the strongest studies backing its effectiveness and it's cheap as chips. If anything, it doesn't hurt my body or my bank account and it's a placebo to hold on to. Stick with it. This is who you are now. Admire yourself for it before others start to admire you.   Alright, sorry for that rambling but you reminded me a little bit of myself, but to answer your original question:  Always have some fruit and healthy snacks in the house. If you run out, you'll end up shopping for them when hungry and that's a recipe for disaster.  Learn what fruits you like and learn about them (I never knew how many different kinds of apples there were and how vastly different they taste - ""Apples aren't my favorite"" has switched to ""I love a good Jonagrod or Fuji, I don't really like Golden Delicious or Braeburn so much"".) Blueberries rock. Bell peppers are a brilliant snack in front of the TV or PC, with or without a dip. Dried apple chips are an amazing replacement for chips. Eggs are better than any expensive protein bar (and taste better, too). Nuts aren't bad, but very high calorie and way too easy to overeat on. I'm staying clear for now.  Love Spaghetti Bolognese? Me, too. I simply replaced the pasta with Zucchini pasta and never looked back and put extra effort into making a kick-ass Bolognese."
HealthyFood,37o5o8,I_Like_Spaghetti,4,Fri May 29 08:46:52 2015 UTC,What do blondes and spaghetti have in common? They both wiggle when you eat them.
HealthyFood,37o5o8,fitwithmindy,0,Fri May 29 08:49:04 2015 UTC,"For weight loss it is about what you eat, it is more to do with how much calorie you eat!   For 1 pound of fat loss, you will need to create 3500 calorie deficit! If you don't like exercise, then you will need to get all of the calorie deficit from food. I would suggest have a calorie deficit no more than 500 calories per day. The reason is because that you will have a long term weight loss and it is not as hard on your diet!   So start by calculating your BMR using your height, weight, and age. Then multiply that by 1.3. That will be your maintenance calorie. So simply subtract 250 to 500 calories from this maintenance calorie, then you have your calorie goal to hit! If you need detailed help on setting your calories, you can check out videos here.  With regard to food, like I said earlier, it doesn't matter what you food eat, as long as you hit your calorie goal, you will lose weight. But healthy food does help you stay satiated longer, hence less calorie. I would say try to eat as much vegetables and fruit as you can, focus on eating whole foods as your main food sources, and have indulgent snacks once a twice a day!   Here are some of my health snacks: canned tuna with whole wheat crackers; whole wheat bread/tortilla with egg whites; apple and almonds; hummus and carrots/celery. Hopefully it helps and good luck! Remember moderation and consistency is key not deprivation :-)"

So I shouldn't eat the shiny apples because they are treated with something that also has non-food applications? Guess what, dumbass: Pretty much everything that can be eaten safely can also be used for other purposes. You know what, just stop eating apples altogether because I heard they're grown in animal poop. Ewww"
HealthyFood,37kgc1,moistflareon,2,Thu May 28 13:03:58 2015 UTC,Well apples do grow on apple trees...so manure isn't a factor in them directly...?

HealthyFood,36mzh1,indulgentfuel,2,Mon May 25 20:09:02 2015 UTC,"You could try making pancakes using almond flour and flax eggs.   Also, try flax seed energy bites. Recipe can be found here: http://youtu.be/WuBCN14pGDs.  Another idea is to use a mixture of coconut flour and gluten free flour as a base for eggless cakes.   You can also use almond meal to thicken your smoothies. It works really well!   You can make oatmeal raisin cookies by substituting almond flour for all purpose flour.   Zucchini/corn fritters can be made using coconut flour along with some chickpea flour.   Enjoy!"

Mango-Coconut yogurt Parfait  1 cup coconut yogurt (if you cant find coconut yogurt Greek, soy or any other type yogurt is good as well)  1 teaspoon chia seeds  agave nectar or honey to taste (optional)  half a mango cut into chunks, save one chunk for garnish (I just brought one of those ready cut packets from the grocery)  granola (I used plain unsweetened but you can use whichever)  toasted almonds to taste (optional)  1.Start of with mixing in the chia seeds and the agave (if using) into the yogurt. Put aside  2.blend the mango chunks in a blender until you have a thick puree (this should take 5-10 seconds)  3.now get a small clear cup and start layering. How you layer is entirely up to you! I started with the yogurt, then the mango puree and then the granola. Keep layering until you've reached the top.   4.Now you can garnish however you want, I thinly cut one of the mango chunks and placed it on top, sprinkled with more granola and then added some toasted almonds. you can add some blueberries, nuts, seeds..whatever you feel like!!   5.

You know a couple of scientific articles (even if neglecting the fact that many researchers actually work for corporations that have direct interest in GE or are financed by them in some other way) doesn't make it the ultimate truth. This field of research is way to new to claim that GM foods are completely safe to consume and that there is no LONG TERM risks to human health.

Just check the sources in this article http://www.collective-evolution.com/2014/07/15/new-study-links-gmos-to-cancer-liverkidney-damage-severe-hormonal-disruption/  And this is just a drop in the ocean.  ""because no credible evidence has emerged to date that any GE food available on the commercial market has caused harmful health effects in humans""  Yeah right. There is only hundreds of types of cancer which occurrence is still not completely explained. And what about intolerances like lactose intolerance or coeliac disease? They are becoming more and more frequent. Yes there are environmental factors that have to be put into equation, but what if some of this amounts GM foods as well?  And a short research never proves anything. You have to go in deep to find the truth, not just scratch the surface. That is why I am saying that there is still lots of research required to claim something like that. And I am not claiming GM foods are unsafe to eat. I am just saying that there is a good chance they aren't. So I prefer to play it safe and stay clear of the most modified foods like soy, canola and corn. But thanks for your insights anyway."

HealthyFood,34eb6a,brazenedelight,2,Thu Apr 30 15:22:31 2015 UTC,"I think a good portobello pizza would do the trick. Saves you the carbs of that unnecessary dough! Here's a recipe I found through a quick google search, but its obviously more fun to adjust toppings based on your personal preferences! I also find pinterest to be an excellent source for new ideas.   Now, if you're willing to be a little adventurous and want to try an alternative to melted cheese, I'd recommend nutritional yeast flakes for the flavor. Very popular among those with vegan lifestyles too.  Edit for (vegan) parmesan cheese recipe."
HealthyFood,34eb6a,mapleandvanilla,2,Thu Apr 30 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"I dunno if this will cut it for you (full confession -- I basically never want pizza, although I do enjoy the taste when I do eat it), but I really like stuffed and baked portobello mushrooms. Fill one up with tomato sauce (or pesto or alfredo or whatever) and your favourite pizza toppings and bake for 20ish minutes at 375ish degrees (I throw them in my countertop oven, keep am eye on them, and just take it out when the mushroom starts threatening to burn). You might steam some veggies really quickly in the micro if you think they won't cook enough in the oven."
HealthyFood,34eb6a,mapleandvanilla,2,Fri May 1 03:56:35 2015 UTC,"That's a really good idea, but mushrooms are one of the few foods I cannot stand - they just turn my stomach!  My boyfriend loves the sound of this idea though, so thanks for the tip! :)"

She politely says, ""Oh, looks very nice!"" and then skedaddles lest we offer her a bite.  The mushrooms work really well as a breakfast option -- either just crack and egg in it with salt and pepper, or mix up and egg and all your favourite egg-add ons (chopped spinach, tomato, cheese, sausage, etc) and use that as your filling.  Mushrooms have a fair bit of water in them, so don't be surprised/confused if there's a bit of mushroom juice on the plates after eating. (Mmm, I bet ""mushroom juice"" is just the most vile phrase to people who don't like mushrooms, haha.)"
HealthyFood,34eb6a,Ohhaybabs,2,Fri May 1 15:16:23 2015 UTC,"Hi, first of all you should not be scared of calories and fat, cause they are both essential for our body functioning. What you have to avoid is so called ""empty calories"" (sugar, white all-purpose flour etc.) and highly processed saturated fats. Second of all, there is a great alternative to a frozen pizza - that is a healthy pizza. Try to make the dough out of wholemeal flour, spelt flour, rye flour, etc... Your toppings should be a good natural tomato sauce, mozzarella and some vegies. And you got yourself a delicious and nutritious pizza!"

HealthyFood,34afno,soundeziner,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:07:38 2015 UTC,"Making smoothies and freezing them for later is an idea and might end up being more efficient, what I was asking was if I could blend, say, bananas and then put that in the freezer for later use in a smoothie.  How would you suggest portioning and separating the frozen fruit into ""servings?"" disposable ""shot glasses"" with plastic wrap over the top?"
HealthyFood,34afno,silverr90,3,Thu Apr 30 14:40:57 2015 UTC,"Pouring pre-blended material into ice cube trays and then bagging after freezing could work if you want to go that route.    If the fruit was already cut up, you could simply put quite a bunch of it in a large freezer bag.  When you go to make a smoothie, just pull whatever amount of chunks you need from the bag."

It's ok to be concerned about pesticides but a simple wash is all you need. Using a sander you may be mixing some of the sanding material INTO your food which is the opposite of your objective.  At least you're willing to eat the peel where a good chunk of fiber and nutrients are.

Frying an egg and eating it on a sandwich is amazing. Use ham, tomato, lettuce and a little bit of mayo (I prefer light Miracle Whip) on brown bread. yes!  I wasn't really a big egg fan but when it's in things, it shouldn't be overwhelming tasting. Hard boiled egg, sliced in a salad is delicious. Or, crack an egg into soup for a thicker soup.

Consider hard boiled eggs, nuts, yogurt with fruit/nuts. Salads in jars seem to be popular lately. Put the dressing at the bottom, then the crunchy veggies and proteins (canned tuna, rotisserie chicken, and eggs are great) lettuce on top. Shake/stir when you are ready to eat."
HealthyFood,33umgt,maowai,2,Sun Apr 26 04:32:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe sandwiches would be helpful. Use 100% whole wheat bread to keep it healthier. You could go the lunch meat route, which isn't always the healthiest (ham is typically healthier than roast beef). But the best thing about sandwiches is their versatility. Add tomatoes or lettuce, or other good for you stuff like spinach leaves or sliced bell pepper. Maybe even sliced cucumbers or carrots. The filling could be anything really. Tuna, pulled meats left over from a crock pot dinner, chunks of left over meats, etc. You can even make it totally vegetarian if you want.   Since your morning is tight on time, I suggest making the sandwiches before bed (unless they contain mayo or other condiments that will soak into the bread). Hummus could add some flavor too, but it might make the bread mushy if it sits on it. I haven't tried it out yet. Throw the sandwich in a reusable container, then into a lunchbox/bag and into the fridge overnight. In the morning, grab your lunch bag, toss in a cold pack and go."

HealthyFood,33tptl,peanutbuttersideup,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:11:27 2015 UTC,Well a little over a year ago I stopped working at a feed factory where I had gained a lot of muscle from working there for two years. My life after that consisted of online schooling and watching my son. I went from a lot of muscle at 190 to all fat at 220. Befor I worked at the mill I was an average skinny guy. I'm really just trying to get back to that. My metabolism is pretty slow so even eating minimally I still don't lose weight. So I started by just cutting out a lot of sugar. Got to where I am. My sex drive has lowered since I gained all the fat due to low self confidence. My wife always tells me I look good to her but to me it's different when I see myself step out of the shower. I'm just really wanting to have a similar figure that I had befor I worked at the feed mill.  Edit. I'm wanting to help speed up the process but still get all the vitamins and protein my body needs to be healthy
HealthyFood,33tptl,Triglycerine,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:58:25 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the shake's composition. If you want to lose it fast I recommend heading over to /r/leangains for a proper diet regimen.  Otherwise I'd suggest taking strictly only protein and fat with no carbs in the morning, modest (!) carbs at lunch and only shake/other protein for dinner. This way you are liberating glycogen from your muscles and force your body to burn fat which translates into net weight loss.   Note that your body can use protein for fuel too so be wary of your total calories.  You could also go completely /r/keto but few people like that.  Cheers. Note: I've explained this in an overly simplified manner."

Plus, I found it much easier to cook when I had seen it done, rather than just reading a recipe. Pick the method you feel most comfortable with, and give it a try.  Start of with some simple stuff, like baked chicken breast or ground turkey meatloaf or balls."
HealthyFood,32cly9,TheGallifreyan,3,Sun Apr 12 18:16:20 2015 UTC,I also ways recommend soups because it's a super simple way to learn different flavours and adjust to your taste. It has definitely made me an overall better cook.
HealthyFood,32cly9,jugglerontheroof,2,Sun Apr 12 20:07:26 2015 UTC,"Professional chef here! I specialize in healthy food and changing your diet. PM me if you wanna chat in more detail. I can help you out together a plan to make changes over the course of a couple months so that you aren't trying to do everything at once and you will be more likely to stick to your new lifestyle.  First off, congratulations on your new beginning! I'm so excited for you.   What is your current level of skill in the kitchen? Do you cook at all? Can you boil water? Make eggs? Do you like vegetables?   Step 0: stop drinking anything but water. Coffee or tea is ok, but not if you put more than 1 sugar in it. And try not to have more than 1 a day.  Step 1: write down everything you put in your mouth every day for a week.   Step 2: enter what you have eaten each day into this website. http://nutritiondata.self.com  Step 3: look for cooking classes in your area if you can afford them. Beginner classes are fun and social. They will give you a lot of good foundational skills and help you meet other people who are trying to do the same as you.  Then we can talk about the results and where to start modifying.   In the meanwhile, start reading! Check out /r/nutrition /r/paleo /r/eatcheapandhealthy  /r/loseit /r/keto (this is contentious but it's interesting)  Read: http://www.amazon.com/What-Eat-Marion-Nestle/dp/0865477388  And this website: http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02012/anti-inflammatory-diet"
HealthyFood,32cly9,julsey414,2,Mon Apr 13 12:12:00 2015 UTC,"I love food blogs because they often do I great job at describing the steps and showing pictures. YouTube can also be great if you like videos (I don't) or to learn a technique. You don't need a lot of materials to get started. I good pot, pan, knife and cutting board are all you need to start. Spices are a great way to add flavor to dishes.  As far as healthy foods, I strongly suggest reading some books or online materials about health. I did my own research about a year ago and found it very eye opening and realized how messed up the current nutrition guidelines are in the USA. I recommend reading Grain Brain, Why We Get Fat, and Good Calories Bad Calories. I'm biased towards low carb diets because of the research i have done. And since you mentioned you had a heart attack, I recommend looking into a ketogenic or keto diet. /r/keto is a great resource."

Even though the program didn't work well for me, I still found it to be a fantastic resource for healthier recipes.  You might also take a look at some of Alton Brown's more recent stuff. My SO and I watch Serious Eats on Netflix and he not only explains the nutrition and science behind the food, he also demos some great cooking techniques.  Here are some of the trailheads I used when I first started my journey to weight loss/healthy lifestyle in the kitchen:   no pop. Seriously. I switched to carbonated water with some lime juice when I'm feeling the need for bubbles. got a store close by? Walk! Walking to the grocery store means you're limited to what you can carry, so you gotta make it count! fish and chicken are easier to cook than you think AND there are some baller healthy recipes out there for them. One of my go-tos is tilapia over a few lemon slices, seasoned with pepper and garlic, wrapped in foil, and tossed on the grill for about 7 or so minutes. cut the salt. Get your body used to low/no salt flavors. I use a lot of garlic, onion, and dill in the kitchen. It's surprising how many differently flavors are out there. grill it!   Feel free to PM if you need to chat! You can do it."
HealthyFood,32cly9,charisma_blackhole,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"Read read read! Personally, I have health issues that are mitigated by diet as well so I talked to my doctor about my necessities (lots of water, fish oil, healthy fats) and made a plan from there. If your goal is heart health I would immerse myself in heart health blogs, and literature. Learn about what the heart needs to function optimally and what things you specifically need to work on. If the problem is cholesterol look into sources of healthy cholesterol (it helps control the bad) and learn about appropriate portions. Healthy fats vs unhealthy, salt intake, and etc. I highly recommend the My Fitness Pal app for tracking calories, fat carb and protein intake as well as vitamins and nutrients. It keep track of your salt and sugar intake as well. Marvelous tool. Once you get started it becomes like a fun game to try to keep your levels in a healthy range. I will look at what I'm low on for the week or day and then do a Google search on healthy  sources of that need, whether it's a mineral or vitamin or whatever. You'll get a sense of what you can eat to fuel your system most efficiently and then you'll know exactly what to cook to reach that need every day.  If you want an easy start, go hard on the veggies, starting with dark greens, as much as you can stand fill up on these first. Don't fry them in oil, sautee them gently if you must but frying in an inch of oil defeats the purpose. Then go for vitamin packed veggies like mushrooms, carrots, yams, squash etc. Herbs are also packed with healthy minerals and vitamins. Incorporate small portions of nuts for healthy fat, and go even less hard on meats. Chicken and shrimp are the least calorically expensive meats and after that, turkey. Everything else is going to need to be extremely small portions to stay in healthy range so I recommend going with chicken and shrimp mostly to start.   I will include some good lists to start. Here's one on cholesterol lowering foods. Raw garlic is on this list and I can't recommend it enough. Raw garlic is a potent anti bacterial as well. I eat raw cloves while I'm sick to fight infection and it definitely helps. It can be rough on an empty stomach so I recommend you eat it with something."
HealthyFood,32cly9,Prinsessa,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:10:24 2015 UTC,"I use a simple formula to make meals that are good and healthy. Lean meat + veggie or single serving of carb + a fat. This helps keep me full.  Example. Lean protein is grilled chicken with some sort of good marinade or something, veggie is just some frozen mixed veggies (I usually just eat as many of these as I want), and the fat is avocado. The veggies could be be substituted for a baked sweet potato or something. Garbanzo or other beans could count for both a carb and a fat.  Tonight, I'm having grilled salmon fish tacos. Fish is the protein, avocado is the fat, and 2 corn tortillas are the carb. The veggies come from this tomato/cabbage slaw stuff that I'm making.  Other than that, the ""healthy recipes"" section of allrecipes.com is a good place to go."

There will always be people who disagree with this, but I would recommend adopting a whole foods, plant-based diet.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3662288/  Extensive research has been carried out in this field and now many doctors and scientists have stated that there is proof that a plant-based diet can manage (and maybe even reverse) heart disease, cholesterol issues, respiratory illnesses and many other conditions.   YouTube really is your friend when it comes to learning how to cook. Just search for a dish that you're interested and click the video with the most views.   For inspiration (beautiful photography, delicious-looking recipes), see this website:  http://garden-of-vegan.tumblr.com/  I am an aspiring nutritionist (have only just started studying but have done plenty of research) and would be happy to provide further info/answer any questions.

The electrolyte and potassium levels of the water of young coconut (even mature coconut) are very, very high. Coconut water leaves you feeling refreshed.      I open my young coconut, then pour the water into a glass. Then I use a strong metal spoon to scrape out all the meat, and cut the meat into cubes. I put the cubes in the glass with the water and that's it! Delicious, especially on a warm day. Not to mention it helps fight cravings of sugary things AND leaves you feeling full. Additionally, in the event an unwanted passerby wanders into your home and you have a mature coconut handy, you could knock a bitch out.  And that's why the coconut is your best friend."

HealthyFood,31fro7,blr1998,4,Sat Apr 4 17:43:45 2015 UTC,"There may be reasons why your parents aren't buying healthier foods and there may be ways you could help.   For one thing, depending on what you're cooking, it can be expensive to eat a nutritious diet (e.g. lots of lean meats and fresh fruits and vegetables). They may be under financial strains they don't talk to you about and may see processed foods as being a cheaper alternative. How you could help: check flyers for sales and note some things you want that are on sale. Or, suggest some things you'd be willing to give up in exchange for expensive meat and veggies. Or get a part time job and pick up a few things every week.   I'd bet the problem is less about financial burden and more about habit, cooking knowledge, and their own diet choices. Diet choices: you can't make choices for other people. If your parents buy all the food and do all the cooking, they're going to buy food they like to eat and that they know how to cook. If you just say, ""get something healthier on the grocery order"", that's a huge open ended request and its completely possible that they don't know what to get or don't see the point of getting food they don't know how to cook and that they don't want to eat. How you can help: learn to cook for yourself and offer to cook for the family occasionally when you get the hang of it. Pick out specific healthy recipes and ask them to get the ingredients you need. When you first propose that you want to cook your own meal, don't just say, ""because you guys eat unhealthy food and I want to eat better"" - that's insulting and you'll probably just make them defensive about the whole situation. Instead, find a recipe, suggest that the family try it the following week, say you'll be willing to help out. If they're not interested in eating it, say you're willing to make it yourself. Just be considerate whenever possible - don't tie up all of the elements on the stove at the time when they usually cook dinner and make sure you do your dishes afterward. Or you can always just start making salads to have on the side of whatever everyone is eating and skip the really rich things like gravy and sugar sweets.  In terms of learning how to eat better, there are some really basic things you can do that would make a big difference: eat lots of protein (eggs and beans are the cheapest, chicken, fish, red meat, tofu are some other high protein foods), eat veggies as much as possible (try eating your veggies first as they'll taste better when you're hungry, take veggies as snacks), cut down as much as possible on foods with added sugar. Protein and veggies with some whole grain carbs (i.e. brown rice, quinoa, or whole wheat pasta instead of bread, white rice, and regular pasta) is the ideal.  As for breaking a sugar addiction, that's all about self-control, discipline, and will-power for the first little while. Learning how to give up something you like in favour of your long term health is a HUGE thing to learn how to do. It'll be hard, but if you're able to do it, you'll feel so much better, will stop craving sweets, and will be a better person overall (because you'll know you can be disciplined and reach whatever goals you make for yourself). Tired of the way Captain crunch makes you feel? Switch to eggs, oatmeal and fruit, or smoothies in the morning, even though you'll miss the sugary taste for the first little while.   Its all about shifting the focus away from blaming your parents and instead trying to think of what you can do change the situation."

HealthyFood,31fro7,fatis4punching,2,Sat Apr 4 22:37:26 2015 UTC,"The first thing is to break that bond with food. You say it is a comfort, and when your life really starts to suck in adulthood, many people lose the little control they had and start gaining. Start on that first, before it's too late, and it won't be an easy thing to accomplish.  Other than that, can you go with your fam to the store and pick out some stuff?  If they won't let you get everything you want, ask for a few things or slip it in.  You could also ask for a few bucks to buy your own groceries, or get a job if it means that much to you.  Otherwise, exercise can offset the bad that sugars and unhealthy food do to your body.  But the absolute first thing to do would be get your mindset about food straight.  I grew up in a house like that and I still haven't shaken it off at 25 years, but I make sure to make good choices and stick to them."

HealthyFood,30yc5v,BlackFlour,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:21:07 2015 UTC,Studies done at Yale University Prevention Research Center have shown that eggs don’t raise blood cholesterol.   Eggs have a complex combination of nutritional properties and there may be something about that combination that mitigates the effects of the dietary cholesterol.   It may be reductionist to say that all sources of dietary cholesterol are as innocuous as eggs.

I don't think this food would be weakening your immune system on its own. Your military weekend work (basic training?) plus gym, plus weekday job might be wearing your body down. Your exposure to people is probably high, with all of your activities combined, so the chances of getting sick are higher. These aspects make you pretty vulnerable to getting sick and make it harder for your body to fight (hence being out of work for a week).  Switching the Michelinas for something else probably will help your overall health. It really depends on what else you're eating. When in doubt, add more veg and fruit."

HealthyFood,30meyu,JusticePhoto,1 point,Sun Mar 29 05:10:09 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem.  When you arrive and put the food in the cooler, it will be warm and it will already have a good growth of bacteria, and then it will stay warm in the cooler for a long time.  It will be nearly impossible to do this right and it is very likely that you will get food poisoning.  The fact that it is vacume packed means that the bacteria growth will be anaerobic (grows without oxygen), critters like botulism and listeria.  You'd be much better off taking food that does not require refrigeration.  Make some small compromises for a few days on your dietary and culinary habits.

He created it with his brother, and they put a ton of time researching this and asking about a dozen nutritionists and others about their opinions on everything.   Their mindset in creating it wasn't to make a diet that lasted only a couple of months, but rather to encourage a whole lifestyle change/mindset.  They don't plan on you losing super crazy amounts of weight really quickly, but rather want you to change to a cleaner way of eating and thinking. Exercise is obviously a important aspect of this, which is why they encourage you to be eating calories (from what I understand. I won't pretend like I know all the research they've done).  And putting aside the calorie counter, the meals are honestly really good. I've had a lot of them, and they're a great way to eat good food, but not feel bad about what you're putting in your body.

With this being said, the site is not a 100% solution, especially for those seeking a significant amount of weight loss in a sort period of time.  It's not about dieting, it's about lifestyle change. On a side note, we are planning on adding a manual input feature for calories and macros in an upcoming version.  Thanks for the feedback and comment. -Founder, ieatfit.com"

Now, I'm very large (and not just fat), so I'm well aware that 2k calories a day is too small for me. But 3.5k seems very excessive.  Can you implement a way for us to input the caloric/nutritional information for you and then you calculate the menu? The menu and shopping list part of your site is EXCELLENT. I just wish I could give it different nutritional parameters."

HealthyFood,309gxr,Soulkept,5,Wed Mar 25 17:14:32 2015 UTC,"Further down the article,    ""If you can reduce the digestible starch in something like steamed rice, you can reduce the calories,"" said Dr. Pushparajah Thavarajva, a professor at the University of Sri Lanka who is supervising the research. ""The impact could be huge.""  Understanding this, James and Thavarajva tested eight different recipes on 38 different kinds of rice found in Sri Lanka. What they found is that by adding a lipid (coconut oil in this case, because it's widely used in Sri Lanka) ahead of cooking the rice, and then cooling the rice immediately after it was done, they were able to drastically change its composition—and for the better.  ""The oil interacts with the starch in rice and changes its architecture,"" said James. ""Chilling the rice then helps foster the conversion of starches. The result is a healthier serving, even when you heat it back up."""

Before their salads, basically anything that wasn't meat was made out of corn to some extent (especially the meat), another frightening industry. But you are right, they are making strides to change and certainly aren't the worst out there, but even if one individual only eats there occasionally, it's the nation as whole who is still demanding this product by the masses, making it impossible for McDonald's to keep up without downgrading on quality.

HealthyFood,2zl8x2,BlackFlour,4,Thu Mar 19 14:54:37 2015 UTC,"The title of this post is a little misleading.  This article wasn't really about grains making people fat; it was about if grains are a healthful choice or not, with obesity being a piece of the story.  However, in the spirit of the title, here are my thoughts:  There is (almost) only one thing that makes people fat: a sustained diet of eating more calories than one burns off.  For me, the reason I avoid grains is because I have found that if I have a breakfast of oatmeal, toast, buckwheat pancakes, granola, etc, I'm hungrier much sooner than if I had an omelette.  I felt like snacking...A LOT, which led to increased caloric intake for me and weight gain.  When I cut grains out of my diet and focussed on high protein, high-ish fat foods, I was fuller for longer.  I lost a lot of weight, and I just simply felt more satisfied after my meals.  Everyone's different.  This is what worked for me.  Grains didn't make me fat, but cutting them out created a shift diet that facilitated in me a feeling of being fuller for longer, and I eventually lost the weight I wanted to lose as a result.  edit: grammar"
HealthyFood,2zl8x2,bearika,2,Thu Mar 19 22:43:28 2015 UTC,I agree completely.  I also lost quite a bit of weight by counting calories and discovered the same thing.  The amount of food vs. how many calories are in it makes choosing grains a less attractive option.  You realize that pasta and bread just don't keep you as full as long especially when a serving size feels more like a side dish but has the calories of a full meal.
HealthyFood,2zl8x2,sergeanttips,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:43:12 2015 UTC,"I have found the opposite. If I don't have a substantial portion of whole grains with my breakfast then I am starving by lunch. Oatmeal, quinoa, brown rice, and homemade granola stick with me for hours. Eggs, meat, yogurt, fruits and veggies alone burn off too quickly. I try to have some protein and fruit/veggies with breakfast too, but if I only have time for one thing I go with whole grains."

But, With this program, the food went straight from the garden to the food bank, and was given to those using the food bank right away.  I forget how many pounds of fresh produce they provided last year (it's first year) but it was well in the millions I think.

HealthyFood,2ziuep,Lordwilky,3,Wed Mar 18 22:53:40 2015 UTC,"Salt is an enormous factor to consider when trying to improve your heart health. It can also be one of the most difficult things to avoid in any diet. Truly the only advice I can give you in this respect is to stop adding salt to your food. Instead, try citrus juice (lemon, lime), cracked black pepper or hot sauce instead of extra salt in your next meal. I believe that brands like Mrs. Dash even produce a line of salt-free cooking blends that add flavor to any dish without raising your blood pressure.    If you tend to eat fatty meats such as bacon, sausage, brisket, etc., try to cut down. Turkey and chicken bacon are decent substitutes for the real thing. Brands like Morningstar Farms and Boca produce wonderful meat alternatives-- I happen to love their mock burgers and chicken patties. Generally, a recipe for braised pork shoulder or pulled brisket or something similar can be adapted to account for those who are concerned about their cardiovascular health. Simply swap the heavier meats for lighter fare, such as venison, bison, turkey breasts, chicken breasts, etc.    And this isn't food related, but take a brisk walk at least once a day. It's great for your heart."

Another go to lately has been tuna with a little mayo and lots of mustard in a pita or on its own. I would try and check out 1200 is plenty for ideas.

HealthyFood,2z3s1a,Mik4MaY,2,Sun Mar 15 15:33:54 2015 UTC,"Ditch the cereal and switch to oatmeal (but don't buy the variety pack). Mix your own sugar (prefer honey or agave) in it so you can control how much. Put a little salt, and maybe add milk or a tsp of peanut butter. Plus throw in a good amount of fruit.   Try to get one square meal a day that has vegetables, protein and a side of something whole grain like barely or brown rice. The USDA has a plate drawing that shows the proportion. Half a plate vegetables, the other half is protein and carbs. Plus a bit of fat.   Have something fresh in each meal. Get about 5-7 servings of either fruit or vegetables every day.   Avoid highly processed white flour and white sugar for a while. They, for some people including myself and sounds like you too, trigger hunger and cravings. When I limited my intake of those, my hunger became a lot more normal.   When I eat what I assume is nutritional and satisfying but become hungry immediately, sometimes the answer is beef. Then I feel ok for a long time.   Exercise, surprisingly, helps reduce my hunger. After a weight lifting class I'd get a Greek yogurt and then kind of not even care if have dinner later.   Those are my personal tactics. I hope some of these help you. I know how you feel and it's very frustrating.   And remember this is a journey. Commit to trying different solutions that work for you. It's very different for each of us."

HealthyFood,2z3s1a,sparklingmineralH20,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:11:25 2015 UTC,"I agree with all the others--add some healthy fats and protien to your diet, and not so many carbs.  I am in a similar boat, but even with protein and fats I'm almost always hungry because of meds I'm on.  It sucks. And, I'm pretty sure these same meds make it very hard to lose weight but easy to gain weight, not only because I'm always hungry, but I think they also do something to my metabolism. (I was in a care facility with a set meal plan when I first started them, and I gained all my weight there.  They were serving me roughly 1800cal/day and I still gained all my weight.  When I switche to the diet plan (1200-1500 cal/day) I didn't lose any weight, but stopped gaining.)    Anyway, now I""m on my own, and cooking for myself.  I CANNOT go below 1200 cal/day because it leaves me WAY TOO HUNGRY (plus it generally isn't recommended).  But, I do find that I get fuller with healthy fats/protein.  I eat lots of fruits and veggies because they will help w/out adding a lot of calories.  But, I will snack on nuts--I measure out a 1oz serving, and this will last me much longer than a 100cal. fibre bar or something other high-carb.   Also, Peanut butter is GREAT!  But, I don't ever eat it on bread.  I'll have peanutbutter and celery for a lunch, or if you like you could put it on apples.  It also has healthy fats/protein.  If you are worried about sugars, look for a natural one that is pretty much just ground peanuts, or make your own. You could try other nut butters too (almond or cashew).  Just make sure you measure out a serving carefully.  With the nuts/nut butters they do pack a lot of calories in a small amount, so sticking to one serving size is important.  Yogurt  could also be a good snack.  Stay away from the low fat varieties that are packed with extra sugar, and just eat a single serving of the regular kind.  The milk w/milk and cookies has protein in it, and depending on what you drink may also have some fat.  That is probably why milk and cookies keeps you full.  Try adding a glass of milk to your meals, and see if that helps."
HealthyFood,2z3s1a,esoper1976,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:34:15 2015 UTC,"People have already answered this pretty well, but I do have one suggestion... Your sub. Switch it for a salad. Get double meat, have a dressing and then sit down, at your desk, at a table, heck even in subway and eat it with a fork.   It physically takes longer to eat, you get more salad (mainly lettuce but you feel like you're eating more and it's basically crunchy water) and I feel much fuller after eating a subway salad than I do a sub.  Also, I have to walk to Ans from subway, around a mile away from my office so I eat there and then walk back and I've added two miles onto my step count for the day and am being fuelled by lettuce! It's a good feeling. Also, try getting water instead of a fizzy drink with it.   And drink more water. 2 glasses before you eat. Apparently it's supposed to fill your tummy up and help you feel full. I can't drink two glasses of water back to back, but I'm building up to it."

Also, it sounds like you should straight go to a doctor. There's no reason you should be feeling ill that shortly after eating on a regular basis. Your diet sounds pretty terrible from what you've described, so you could be malnourished. You could also have a thyroid issue. Nobody here can tell you any of that though. A doctor and tests will."
HealthyFood,2z3s1a,bblemonade,1 point,Sun Mar 15 22:32:31 2015 UTC,"besides what everyone else is saying about eating more protein and healthy fats to feel full longer...since you're trying to lose weight, the best thing you can do is download a calorie-counting app and start logging your calories (LoseIt or MyFitnessPal). Losing weight isn't necessarily about eating ""healthy food"", it's about how many calories you consume versus how many you burn in a day. Along the way you will learn tricks to get the most bang for your buck, which will automatically steer you towards healthier food. But sometimes it's easier to continue eating the same foods you already eat, just less of them, to stay under your calorie goal. Then once you start to lose weight, you feel more motivated to make the diet changes and get used to healthier replacements.  Also, bonus tip: Garcinia Cambogia is a supplement that suppresses food cravings, and doesn't have any side effects (like jitteriness or anything). I know it sounds like a scam like all weight-loss diet pills, but my sister and I found it really curbs our food cravings and when we forget to take it, we overeat by snacking every hour, but when you take it, you don't even think about food or feel hungry."
HealthyFood,2z3s1a,sdteacher,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"Foods like oatmeal, vegetables and fruit will keep you full and they are cheap. You can choose whatever fruits and vegetables are in season and are cheapest. Don't choose simple sugars like white bread, sugar (the caramel) and foods from fast food joints, even if it's ""whole wheat bread.""   Choose to buy a bag of potatoes instead and roast them yourself. Think about what grows on the earth and eat that. These are vegetables and fruit. If you're still hungry at  night then you should aim to eat more fruit and vegetables during the day. Or eat the food you like, but make it at home. Stuff from shops costs more and it's full of preservatives, sugars and hidden salt.   You don't have to go vegetarian. Choose lean proteins like chicken breast, fish or turkey breast. Not the skin. Roast or poach a chicken breast and make a healthy sauce yourself. Eat brown rice. A whole bag will cost you pennies a serving. Buy a bunch of broccoli.

Or, alternatively, take whatever you were going to make the sandwich with, IE. cold cuts, cheese and mayo, and swap out the bread entirely for some chopped salad. My favorite salad consists of hard boiled eggs, chickpeas, chopped olives, chopped mushrooms, cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, tomatoes and romaine lettuce.      Swap potatoes for other root vegetables, like butternut squash, beets, sweet potatoes, parsnips, etc. You'll hardly tell the difference.    If you must drink soda, make it diet. Even better, swap out soda for seltzer water mixed with lemon and lime juice.    Instead of eating a candy bar or a cupcake, try cups of sugar-free chocolate pudding or sweetened Greek yogurt with fruit. The absolute best substitution for those processed sweets would be a cup of chopped up fruit, berries, pineapple, mango, etc. with a drizzle of honey and a dollop of whipped cream.

Figured this is something you guys would really appreciate, and I thought it would be great to get some feedback.  It started in Jackson Hole, WY, after a sunny day of spring skiing and riding with good friends. I was driving home and I was a little dehydrated and tired. I was thinking about a coffee, soda, or an energy drink if I was going to stay awake to meet up with everyone later. These options didn't sound great, as I didn’t want the bitterness of coffee, artificial sweeteners, or energy drink components. I wanted something that would hydrate me, while giving me energy. After much deliberation, I realized that I would not be able to find what I was looking for on any shelf at the market.  The idea grew, and I spent the last 2 ½ years working on recipes, and sourcing superior ingredients to create Caffy’s premium sparkling waters. At first, I started making batches just for me. And then I started bringing it to parties and sharing it with friends. And we are now bringing it to market. We bottle Caffy’s in small batches with the finest natural ingredients including Coffeeberry® Natural Caffeine, from the fruit of antioxidant rich coffee plants. A bottle has 45 mg of caffeine, which is about the same as a diet soda. They have zero calories and zero sugar. It comes in Sparkling, Lemon-Lime, and Raspberry.  Would love for you to follow us on social, and more importantly, would love to hear your feedback, so let us know what you think! You can find us on Facebook, twitter.com/caffyswaters, and @caffyswaters on Instagram).  If you'd like to purchase our waters, please find us in Chicago at select retailers, or drop us a line and stay in touch. Online orders coming soon, at which time we will just create a coupon code for you guys to give you a % off a 6 pack.  Either way, check us out! Thanks for any feedback. www.caffys.com"

HealthyFood,2ysqft,Life-in-Death,4,Thu Mar 12 16:50:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not aware of any reasons why eating fruit at other times during the day would be better / worse than eating them in the morning, but I'm not a dietician, either.  Personally, I don't worry about how much sugar I'm getting in my morning smoothie in particular. I pay attention to how much sugar I'm consuming over the course of the day/week.   The World Health Organization recently released a press release saying that adults and children should reduce their sugar intake to less than 10% of their total total energy intake - and that reducing it below 5% would provide further health benefits. Their release says that 5% would be roughly 25g or 6 teaspoons per day.  So, from a sugar standpoint, cutting down on the fruit in your smoothies is probably a good thing and I wouldn't worry about trying to get the fruit in later. I use a banana and about 3/4 cup blueberries in mine and I find that makes them taste great, adds a great deal of nutrients, and doesn't cause any kind of ""sugar crash"" later in the morning.  EDIT: See replies to this comment. The recommendations only refer to free sugars (i.e. added sugars), not those from whole foods. Eat the fruit!"

I did that for about 3 weeks and then I developed the largest zit on my nose I had ever gotten.  Could have been totally unrelated but I always get Zits when I eat too much sugar.  So I changed that formula.  That was over 5 years ago and my morning smoothies has changed considerably.  Now the sweetest thing I put in my smoothie is a whole red beet.  It may be that I've gotten use to drinking them fruitless but the beet to me really sweetens it up.  It's a natural sugar but I think I read it's a slow release type of sugar.

HealthyFood,2yq23t,Life-in-Death,3,Thu Mar 12 01:17:12 2015 UTC,"Well ""free-range"" has become a marketing gimmick - it can include a million chickens packed in a giant warehouse with no room to move.  As long as they aren't trapped in individual cages, they can be ""free-range"", at least that's my understanding.  If you want color like that, they are going to need a diet that consists of a lot more than corn and soy.   I hardly even have to feed my hens, because they browse the yard, going after bugs, worms, slugs, etc.  You can get eggs like this from farmers markets, Co-ops, or direct from farms.      I hate to link them as a source, but mother earth news did a little study on the actual stats, the results of which can be found here:  http://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/free-range-eggs-zmaz07onzgoe.aspx  EDIT:  here's a better source, they link the study at the bottom: http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrientprofile&dbid=60  EDIT2: another source: http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7219036   Results suggest that grass pastures may enhance vitamin E in eggs of pastured hens more than clover, and pastured hens supplemented with commercial mash will produce eggs with significantly more vitamin E and total omega-3 fatty acids compared to eggs from caged hens fed only commercial hen mash."
HealthyFood,2yq23t,Purple10tacle,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:00:36 2015 UTC,"It is most likely the quality of the food the chickens will be eating.

HealthyFood,2yq23t,Purple10tacle,0,Thu Mar 12 16:26:21 2015 UTC,"The color of the yolk is determined by the hen's diet: the more pigmented foods it consumes, the darker it gets. A diet heavy in green plants or yellow corn produces darker yolks than one in lighter colored grains.  The claim that the eggs are more nutritious or flavorful is simply nothing more than wishful thinking, though. It's verifiably BS:  http://www.science20.com/science_20/science_settled_no_nutritional_difference_between_freerange_and_caged_chicken_eggs-82015  Just about any blind taste test shows no difference in flavor either.

HealthyFood,2yq23t,Life-in-Death,3,Thu Mar 12 02:07:24 2015 UTC,"This link only discusses ""free-range"" labeled eggs, those of which I discussed above.  It's a bunk study because it only takes common sense to know that ""free-range"" vs ""caged"" will produce no difference in eggs, if they are provided the same diet and lack access to an earth-like outside environment.  Pasture-raised hens are a different story altogether.  The color of the yolk is deeper because it has more beta-carotene in it.  Also your comment regarding taste is silly.  Even if it were true, that you can't tell the difference while blind, you do not eat your breakfast blind - you can see it.  Seeing healthy orange eggs as opposed to sickly yellow ones while I eat breakfast comes off as more appetizing to me."
HealthyFood,2yq23t,WolfInAFoxHole,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:12:11 2015 UTC,"It was a controlled study, it did not just sample store bought free range and caged eggs. And it's one of several.  There is a 2003 German study that sampled fully ""organic"" eggs significantly closer to your set up that came to the exact same conclusion: zero difference in nutritional value.  A higher pigmentation of the yolk provides no health benefits.  The eggs in your picture look great and I'm sure they taste ""better"", simply because of the work you yourself out into them.  But the claim that there is any objective and discernable difference in flavor and nutritional value would almost certainly not withstand any scientific testing."
HealthyFood,2yq23t,McNorema,3,Thu Mar 12 02:48:34 2015 UTC,"I browsed through the study already.  It is exactly as I described above - the sample size is 500 chickens, and that is factory-level.  It is not comparable to home-raised farm fresh chickens.  If my same 10 chickens are able to roam an identical environment to that available to the 500 chickens, which group do you think has access to more preferable resources (bugs, worms, etc)?  Well, mine will have 50x the access.  Did you browse through the study that I linked above?  It uses a sample size of 75 hens, and found significant increases in a number of vitamins, as well as healthy fats.  (When we talk about fats, remember that it is not the amount of fat that is important, but the ratio of healthy to non-healthy.)    Other than the enormous flock of hens used in the study, this is also the sentence used to describe the outside area they had access to: ""A general description of the range paddock would be a typical hay mixture "".  That is descriptive of my coop run.  Outside of that, they have grass, dirt, clover, piles of pine, we even have a small creek.  I've actually seen my chickens scratch bark off my tree to find bugs.  The only thing this study proves is that ""free-range"" labeled eggs will never be healthier on a factory farm level, and taking it out of context, and using it as representative of small scale pasture-raised hens, is borderline fallacy."

I think that an important asterisk in this story though is that this is not a passive undertaking. Also, you're going to pay a bit to get set up to get these fresh eggs, and you will have to maintain it.  I wouldn't say that its HARD either, but if you already feel like your weekends are short and you need more hours in a day, then you dont need a hen house to clean out and chickens to feed and water -- even with automatic feeders, etc.  They need clean quarters, if they are free range you should check to see that they are accounted for as often as possible, you should make sure they have fresh feed and water, make sure they have proper heat in the winter, etc etc.  I would somewhat equate it to having a really dumb cat.  I had chickens when I had a more flexible work schedule, and it did kind of become just another task to deal with.

I certainly think its better to eat oats, nuts, and fruit with honey on top than it is to eat processed corn and wheat with refined sugar on top, but for those looking to cut back on sugar, its easy to make the mistake of thinking that honey is 'natural', it doesn't really count as sugar."

There would be ten different vendors of blueberries at each market.  For several years I would sample a few berries from each stand and buy what tasted the best to me.  When they got especially good and cheap, I'd buy 5-10 lbs, wash them and freeze them in ziplock bags.  They are delicious when thawed.  This said, I've now progressed to buying Wyman's frozen wild blueberries in the store throughout the year.  Altogether tasty, convenient and cheap (for what you get).  Sometimes I still buy berries at the market, but I'm often disappointed by the quality/price."

I mean, if you NEED chocolate (and I know what you're talking about) this is a teensy bit better.  Or maybe you could try eating and drinking half as much? Smaller glasses of coke and instead of eating two whole candy bars to only eat half of one for after lunch and after dinner?"
HealthyFood,2yh97t,Spiffy-Tiffy,7,Tue Mar 10 07:39:11 2015 UTC,"To be honest I wouldn't say that having two chocolate bars and several glasses of coke a day is healthy, doesn't matter what else you are eating/drinking because at this level it could damage your health in the long term. Now you are ""fine"" but this sort of habit could lead to an increased risk of type two diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and several other illnesses associated with metabolic syndrome. You are right to be concerned and should find a way yo cut your consumption of chocolate and coke down to a weekly treat or something similar."
HealthyFood,2yh97t,pajamakitten,2,Mon Mar 9 21:43:05 2015 UTC,"My opinion is that is isn't super healthy.  Could you possibly work at getting yourself slowly adjusted to maybe one small piece of chocolate a day and one glass/can of Coke?  I know for myself, often if I am not allowed to have any it makes it worse.  But even if I have just a little bit, it will help satisfy the craving.    Also, you could try to find some healthy alternatives like homemade energy bites, ""healthy"" fudge or other similar chocolatey things that might help you get that chocolate fix in a better way."

HealthyFood,2yh97t,luckiestwife,1 point,Tue Mar 10 01:03:34 2015 UTC,"Well, we all have our vices, right?  :)  And really, the coke is probably much worse for you than the chocolate anyway.  The other thing that just occurred to me now is that you could switch to dark chocolate, if that's not what you already eat.  The darker the chocolate, the healthier it is.  In fact, some studies have shown that small amounts of dark chocolate are actually good for you.  We love Lindt and Godiva dark chocolate (much better than Hershey's!) and if you like truffles, Lindt has some amazing dark chocolate truffles that you can buy in little bags."
HealthyFood,2yh97t,liljordo,2,Wed Mar 11 01:41:32 2015 UTC,"Do you track calories or macros?  I don't know your body fat % or how much you exercise, but your TDEE is probably ~1700 calories if you don't exercise regularly. Using the same calculator, you should probably have about 54g of fat (or less) per day.  A Hershey chocolate bar is 210 calories, 24g sugar, & 13g of fat. x2 that is 25% of your daily calories & ~50% of your daily fat. Also, those 2 chocolate bars are basically all of your saturated fat (which really should be as low as possible).  Coca-Cola 12oz can is 140 calories & 39g sugar. x2 that's 280 calories, bringing your total daily calories to 41%, that's a lot of calories coming from junk food. Max should be ~15%.  American Heart Association suggests getting 100 calories from sugar per day. You're getting 540 calories from sugar (4 cal per gram).  TL;DR: You're eating too much sugar. Cut out the pop and only eat 1 chocolate bar per day gets you to the recommended amount.  Too much sugar increases risk of heart disease, poor nutrition, added fat, & increase risk of diabetes."

I've found that making basic meals from actual ingredients is a great path to health over restaurant and fast food, which tends to have far more sodium and fat that you would add yourself. Olive Oil is a healthier fat. Cut out Veggie and Corn oils when possible. Read the labels of what you eat. If it's high in saturated fat, look for another option. Red meat is not great for you in my experience. Fresh fruit is fantastic. For a snack, have some grapes, an apple - they're quite good - seriously. I LOVE Gala apples now and eat about one a day. Eat as much leafy greens as you want (per my Nutritionist). Nuts, though they have fats, are still better than fast food, and they're nutritious. Cut out soda. Just drop it now. It's just not good for you. Don't waste your life on it. Water is great to drink (in moderation - too much water at once can even be bad for you). Preventative care is so much easier than dealing with something once it happens, as you have learned the painful way with your father's experience. I find it much easier to say no to the really unhealthy foods after having had an illness aggravated by cholesterol, where I could have died or had my hands/feet amputated if the meds didn't work (very quickly). I look at unhealthy foods and think - which would I rather have - my hands or that cheeseburger? Hands win easily. Actually considering the deficits that can result from an unhealthy eating pattern at the time of choosing foods can make the decision easier. That being said - please don't go to such extremes that food terrifies you (I went through that post sepsis caused by stones). I have found that the longer I go without unhealthy food, the more I notice how crappy junk food makes me feel when I do eat it. I used to think that I just felt crappy and that was just how things were, but having shifted my diet in a healthier direction, I realize how much better I can feel each day just by not ingesting food I know to be bad for me. Life is precious. Feeling well is not to be taken for granted. It's not a given. Good health is something that must be worked towards if not fought for. It doesn't have to be a battle - once the shift has occurred and you're in a pattern of eating healthily - but getting to that healthy diet can be a battle. It's one worth embarking upon. Once your'e eating well - then it's a pleasure. In my opinion, stick to low animal fat ingestion, as low as you can of saturated fat intake as possible, include healthy fats like Olive Oil and avocado, Salmon, ground flax seeds, etc - sources of Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, which are healthy for your brain. Fruits, veggies, nuts (raw and unsalted when possible - they don't need help to taste good). I'm a mega fan of a morning smoothie with a little $20 magic bullet looking blender thing you can get at Kmart. I make mine with nonfat organic vanilla yogurt, a little water, a scoop of protein powder with vitamins, a handful of blueberries, strawberries and blend. It's delicious and it takes 2 minutes. On days I have that, I have more umph, and I don't crave crappy food. What I've found is that when I start my day already providing the vitamins and nutrients my body needs, I don't blindly eat junky thing after junky thing trying to find the various nutrients. I hope any of this helps. Most of all, I wish healing for your dad, and for you and your family.   You're approaching this from a good angle. Learn what you can from this and making something good come from it. Be sure to check with your dad's doctors, as well regarding potential future screening for yourself regarding your neuro vasculature. I worked in the Interventional Neuro Radiology Dept at a Hospital, and I remember they suggested angiograms of the brain for stroke patients in the years following stroke to prevent future stroke, as well as for children of people who have had strokes. Best Interventional Neuro Radiology Doc I know of is Alejandro (Alex) Berenstein in NYC. He's like a rock star in the field and an amazing human. I wish for you and your father, good health and a speedy recovery without deficit. Hugs to you. You can get through this."

If I have any processed food in the house I will eat it with little restraint and in place of healthy food.  The food engineers know how to push my buttons.  I cannot resist.

HealthyFood,2xj3ip,adurf,3,Sun Mar 1 16:27:41 2015 UTC,"Replace the salty chips with things like air popped popcorn, roasted chickpeas, kale chips, etc. You can ""healthify"" most meals simply by replacing the protein and swapping simple carbohydrates for complex ones, IE. sweet potatoes or quinoa instead of white rice or pasta, and lean meats such as chicken, turkey, fish and shellfish instead of beef and pork.     Most veggies benefit from the olive oil, salt, pepper and roast treatment: just slice your vegetable of choice into manageable pieces, toss with the aforementioned ingredients, and roast in a hot oven until they become golden brown and tender.    This is a fantastic dinner that you can whip up in under 30 minutes, usually: dice one red onion, some bell peppers, garlic and par-cooked sweet potato, then saute over medium heat until soft. Mix in a can of plain black beans, and season with cumin, cinnamon, coriander, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, hot sauce, and salt. In the last few minutes of cooking, toss a handful of baby spinach into the mix, and let it cook down. Serve with slices of avocado, some salsa, and a dollop of plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream."

Different people are able to thrive on different diets, there are a lot of factors.  2nd place for me would be cutting refined sugars and eating less grains.  Refined grains are super subsidized so it's easy to go overboard on them.  I used to eat a diet very high in bread/pasta, and that was problematic for my digestion.  YMMV  If you are running into conflicting information, some of it is probably biased (check the source to see if it's coming from a part of the food industry, those sources are typically deceitful) and/or part of a nutritional cult/fad."
HealthyFood,2wrwhf,st_valentinus,5,Sun Feb 22 20:43:25 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with the other two (current) comments here. Cutting down on processed food (flour, sugar, deep fried, etc) made the biggest change for me.  I don't avoid these things entirely and actually have a pretty high fat content in my diet, but I'm still relatively young, in good physical health, and exercise daily.  I worked on the road for a year and cooked in my motel rooms. I ate the same thing every day:  Breakfast sandwich - egg, bacon, cheese on bread, with grapes  Snack - banana, granola bar  Lunch - salami sandwich (with every type vegetable I could fit on it), avacado  Snack - apple  Dinner - 5 oz of steak, plate of lettuce or steam in bag vegetable, and microwave rice or potato  Only drank water, and coffee.  I lost 40 lbs and I'm in excellent physical condition according to my check-up last Monday from eating this way.  Total calories in/out and making sure you get enough water and fruits and veggies are in my opinion are great places to start. You can get as complex or as simple as you like. The key is to make it simple enough that you'll stick with it.  The other half is exercise, the more you use those body parts the better they work for you. I seriously would mostly just stand and walk (maybe a little lifting, or shoveling, or throwing of heavy objects here and there) 10 hours a day and that would make a huge difference for me. The trick is to just start with what you're comfortable with.   Good luck."

Apple, orange, banana, spinach & kale, frozen berries, milk/water and protein powder. This takes care of 1/3 of your meals for the week. It is also MUCH easier to gulp all of this down than it is to eat each item 1 by 1. Taste like a strawberrie's wild/razzmatazz shake from jamba juice so its not like it taste like V8. Breakfast can be as simple as cheerios or oatmeal. You can also have some fruit that you don't put in your smoothies like grapes, pine apple, watermelon (for variety's sake). Try to stay away from donuts, pancakes, bagels w/ cream cheese and toast w/ butter & jelly. My motto is: ""I don't eat bread for breakfast."" Quick, cheap & easy lunches at home is pretty obvious: PB&J, tuna sandwiches, deli sandwiches. Try to use wheat bread (i prefer natures own 100% whole wheat. it has seeds and what not in it. Really good. Not sure if it is the ""healthiest"" ever, but i like it). If you do the 3 things above daily, you should be able to eat almost whatever you want for dinner. Don't go crazy and get a large meat lovers pizza and dip it in ranch. But if you want a burger, tri tip, ribs, steak, fish or some chicken, go for it. Sides should be steamed or sauteed veggies (since they taste the best) and/or whatever salad you prefer.  Cut out almost all fast food. If I do eat fast food, it's in n out protein style w/ mustard, or chic fil a. No french fries, soda or shakes tho. You should really only be eating fast food if you don't have time or if you need some extra calories because you haven't eaten enough. Along the fast food lines, no pizza or beer/alcohol. Its tough for the first week if that's your normal diet, but if you replace that crap with a smoothie, you will feel great in a short amount of time. daily multi-vitamins (to get the ones I am missing in my diet), joint supplements (helps reduce/prevent joint pain when running/exercising, and fish oil will help you maintain overall health. Not really food for your mouth, but for your body, and that is to get some sun whenever you can. laying out and getting a tan will make you feel and look better.

WAY healthier than a donut or waffle, or a muffin or whatever bread item people are eating these days. Oatmeal is a good source of fiber, it fills you up, low in calories, cheap and easy to make.

HealthyFood,2wl3wl,lavendyahu,1 point,Sat Feb 21 18:28:44 2015 UTC,"Cut fruit. You can either buy a fruit cup or spend some time the night before and prep. You eat that with a fork so no mess. Grapes need no prep but are high in sugar.   String cheese. Or any other single serve cheese.   Personally I believe that maybe your main meals should be more filling so you don't feel like snacking so much, because any way you look at it snacks are never satisfying enough to justify the calories. But that's just my opinion."
HealthyFood,2wl3wl,superdove,1 point,Sat Feb 21 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who has really struggled with mindlessly grazing (eating heaps of calories without realizing it), I also have to suggest that you pre-measure any snack before eating, especially if you're focusing on work :)  ETA: To actually answer your question, though, I really like baby carrots and hummus (a good salty/sweet combo) and air popped popcorn (when I wanna munch and munch for the sake of munching, but without tons of calories)."

HealthyFood,2wl3wl,kleoptera,1 point,Thu Mar 5 21:00:21 2015 UTC,"What sort of diet do you follow? (not necessarily diet for weight loss, I just mean how do you normally eat?) Also how often are you getting up and walking around? As someone in a similar position, I find that the longer I sit and concentrate/work on something, the more often I get snacky. When I can get up every hour or so, even if it's a walk across my office's floor to the break room to refill my water bottle and do a little stretching, I find I have less cravings. So that might help if you aren't already doing so.  My typical snacks are: coffee & tea (unsweetened in both cases), sugarfree gum (just to give my mouth something to do while I'm focusing on work), protein shakes, nuts (pre-measure these and only bring an allotted portion each day or if you're like me you will easily eat 3-4 times as many as you meant to!), raw or roasted vegetables (cauliflower is a favorite, but I also bring in cucumbers, assorted pickles, celery, lettuce wraps, etc), mini sandwiches, hard-boiled eggs, mini cheeses.  Be careful if you bring in dried fruit for the same reason you want to be careful of nuts: they are very calorie-dense foods and a serving size is very tiny. Also if you're trying to switch from unhealthy/sugary snacks to something more beneficial to your diet, I would avoid most fruit altogether, save for maybe some berries, as that's just a bunch of sugar. Same for juices (fruit and vegetable)."

HealthyFood,2wja9j,bromagnonman,7,Fri Feb 20 14:02:25 2015 UTC,"I eat high protein, and find this article fairly frustrating.  First off, perhaps they should be focusing on recommending lean meats.  Pork & red meat are considerably less healthy options than chicken & fish (in terms of carcinogens, ""cleanliness"" of protein, etc).  Secondly, rather than cutting meat in place of vegetables, clearly the average American diet should be focused on eschewing empty carbs & processed foods.  tl dr; Leave my chicken alone, and focus on getting those Doritos out of Americans' faces."
HealthyFood,2wja9j,rand486,1 point,Fri Feb 20 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with your first point. If they are recommending a reduction in meat consumption for sustainability and health, then it follows that part of that should be replacing at least some pork and red meat with chicken and/or fish.   However, the article is pretty clear that the panel is not supporting empty carbs and processed foods. ""Consistent evidence indicates that, in general, a dietary pattern that is higher in plant-based foods...and lower in animal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with lesser environmental impact than is the current average U.S. diet""."

I said if they're going to pick a demon, either distinguish between sources of protein, or focus on the greater evil - empty carbs/processed foods - which they totally ignore in the article.  After all, the Mediterranean diet has plenty of lean meats, and is considered one of the best diets out there."
HealthyFood,2wja9j,rand486,1 point,Sat Feb 21 05:42:46 2015 UTC,"I agree that overall, empty carbs and processed foods are worse than meat. However, if their main angle is sustainability, then meat is an easy target."

This is a matter of sustainability and an all Dorito diet, while not exactly healthy for you, still has a significantly lower impact on the environment than a high animal protein diet.  As someone who swapped carbs for protein with direct personal health benefits, I still have to admit that I'm probably a bit of an asshole for doing it."
HealthyFood,2wja9j,Purple10tacle,1 point,Sat Feb 21 08:31:13 2015 UTC,"But not once in this article did someone say that eating high protein was less healthy (although there is plenty of statistical evidence suggesting that low protein may increase  longevity).  The single reason given is a perfectly valid one: eating meat is significantly worse for the environment and products a significantly higher carbon footprint, there is no way around that. Eating lean chicken and fish does not change that.  I personally eat relatively high protein and plenty of chicken and fish and I feel that for my personal health this is currently beneficial (I'm still in the process of losing weight). But for the rest of the planet it would be better if I ate mostly plant matter."

Tell the factory farms to produce less meat.  Americans can eat less meat all they want, but the factory farms will still do what they do. There may be change, but it will be slow. If we're trying to prevent ecological disaster based on food consumption, then make the change at the top. If McDonalds began offering a ""bug protein mcnugget"", people would eat it.

Now I'm much healthier and even though I'm still the same weight I feel SO much better. I actually prefer drinking water now as well and coincidentally don't like the taste of soda very much anymore. Other than water I try to drink green tea a few times a week since I heard it helps speed up your metabolism. If you're going to be making tea don't add a bunch of sugar/milk in it but you can add a bit of honey (not so much honey that you can only taste the honey, though lol.)  I slowly changed my diet completely and it all started by switching out my soda with water. :)"
HealthyFood,2w3rlm,MrsTokHaar,1 point,Tue Feb 17 01:21:03 2015 UTC,"I also have had a complete switch from soda to water though I do drink soda here and there due to cravings but I would say I drink my daily recommended 8 glasses of water per day. It was cuz of a realization that sugar causes me to break out. Acne is not a good look so I switched from drinking soda as my go to drink to water and it has helped tremendously. I work at Jamba Juice too and I juice stuff here and there and add vitamins to it(antioxidant, chia seeds). Just wanted to get ur opinion on what else you do in your diet? Like what do eat as snacks and what kind of food you like to eat that is healthy and tasty!"
HealthyFood,2w3rlm,Mackyoni,3,Tue Feb 17 04:23:02 2015 UTC,"Just letting you know you don't have to drink a certain amount of water a day, just drinking it when your thirsty will do!  These are some things from the top of my head. The hard part for me is being always hungry, trying to find something new and tasty to eat. It's truly difficult. I personally eat as much as I want and I eat all through out the day, eating more healthy means I'm way more hungry than if  I were to have a burger. I also don't think I need to be counting calories so long as what I'm putting in my body is healthy. I hope it helps you even a little bit as I struggle with the same thing myself.   breakfast:   oatmeal with blueberries/strawberries pretty quick and easy. banana pancakes only need two eggs and a banana to make. berry smoothie because possibilities are endless with so much fruit. I seem to make banana spinach, strawberry banana, and mango pineapple smoothies the most.  cheerios with low fat milk if I'm in a hurry, NOT the honey nut! Plain and I add my own honey to make it yummy. :)  eggs and fruit I eat a lot. Probably the most, I also put peanut butter on my whole wheat bread.    lunch:   turkey, tomato, lettuce sandwich on whole wheat bread I like to add avocado as well. A bunch of sandwiches really, banana peanut butter, etc.  Salad I toss a bunch of (healthy) stuff into my salad and make it really good and filled with things I like lol, I hate a salad that's really plain. hard boil some eggs, add some fruit and tuna salad!   dinner:   salmon, brown rice, and veggies fish is great for you!  chicken and vegetables because it's super easy to make.  Vegetable Soup Stuffed peppers   snacks:   For snacking through out the day I'll munch on nuts, raisins, eat a banana/apple and other fruits, Lentil chips from trader joes, hard boiled eggs (I love eggs lol), celery with peanut butter, hummus and pita, sugar snap peas."

HealthyFood,2vjg4e,quizzastical,11,Wed Feb 11 14:54:00 2015 UTC,"I can't explain it scientifically. That is, if I can explain it at all, but I can tell you you're not alone. A year ago, I started juicing vegetables (mainly leafy greens and beets) and I would feel the same way. It was like my body was buzzing, my mind was clear, and my thoughts came more quickly. It completely felt like too much caffeine. It's no secret that raw, plant-based foods give you tons of energy. I think that's just what it is. What you're feeling is what eventually reinforces the committment to a healthier dlet and lifestyle. Healthy foods make you happy and make you feel good. They are medicine.   Here's my personal experience; I struggled with crippling anxiety for a few years, and for one whole year, I had no quality of life at all. I also had constant stomach pain and nausea. I took to hiking as therapy, I researched clean eating, and read some helpful texts. I made changes and stuck with them. I don't have a stitch of anxiety anymore, and haven't since I committed to a healthy diet and lifestyle. Even the stomach issues are gone. Now that I've gone a year predominantly without unnatural, processed, and highly synthetic foods, I don't feel the buzz from healthy stuff; I just feel great overall. We all have cheat days, but when eat something synthetic, processed, or containing lots of white flour, I pay for it. I feel sluggish afterwards, my old friend, nausea, returns, and I get brain-fog for the rest of the day.   I hope that you continue to explore a natural diet and see how if affects the way you feel, both mentally and physically. I know it's a diet that costs more, takes more time, and requires some research (there are a lot of lies out there), but I promise it's worth it. :)"
HealthyFood,2vjg4e,timbervibe,3,Wed Feb 11 16:12:27 2015 UTC,"Just want to mention I experienced the exact same thing with crippling anxiety, same length of time, took me out of work and school.  Now I also feel like I have mostly mastered these feelings and they don't ever come to surface anymore.  I also had the stomach issues I lost 20 lbs.  I will say that it was the worst but best experience of my life because now I have a lot more dedication to my own health both mental and physical.  I do get the energy boost from greens but I haven't had any issue with it, its quite enjoyable to me but I also love caffiene.  What always wierds me out is that if I eat a salad I still don't feel all that full but I know somehow I am way more full of nutrients than after a full course meal.  The best thing to do is go use that energy, often I will eat a salad on lunch at work then go bust out the dishes like I just hit a crack pipe.  We always go home early those days."

Unless you're trying to do keto, a little bit of sugar from fruit isn't terrible. I like to make protein fluff with cottage cheese, whey protein, frozen strawberries, and (optionally) your favorite non-caloric sweetener. A giant tub of it is like 300 calories, mostly from protein. If texture is the problem, how about soup? Cook the vegetables, add some spices and broth, then puree until smooth. Go see a nutritionist. Given all of your restrictions and the fact that you're trying to lose weight, you probably could use some advice from someone who knows what they're talking about rather than random people on the Internet."
HealthyFood,2vbtgo,ungoogleable,1 point,Tue Feb 10 05:55:09 2015 UTC,"Good suggestions, but I'd say OP should see a registered dietitian. Anybody can set up shop as a ""nutritionist"" but an RD is trained to provide dietary advice while accounting for medical conditions/preferences."

HealthyFood,2vbtgo,ungoogleable,1 point,Tue Feb 10 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. A better option could be to see a medical doctor who specializes in nutrition. I don't agree that a registered dietician is more credible than a lot of nutritionists online. Obviously you need to make sure that they have adequate education and experience, but a registered dietician goes on a different path than many nutritionists and medical doctors. Like you say, anybody can call themselves a nutritionist.  Having a RD certificate doesn't mean you're good in your field, it just means you managed to follow through a structured course and pass a test. Nutritionists can do that too but they can go even further and obtain PhDs, neglecting to ever become a RD."
HealthyFood,2vbtgo,xgplint,1 point,Wed Feb 11 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"PhD ""nutritionists"" are nutrition scientists. Anyway, I was just asking that OP be aware of the distinctions between different people who claim expertise on nutrition. If I were to choose between a blogger who posts everything paleo to get the most web traffic and ad revenue and calls herself/himself a ""nutritionist"", vs someone who has ""been through a structured course and passed a test"" I'd pickk someone whose credentials are actually regulated, i.e. the RD. FYI, to become an RD does not involve one course and a test - you need a bachelor's degree strong science background and a series of advanced nutrition courses. It is not just a ""certificate"", like an EMT-B or Phlebotomist cert.   Most doctors take a couple of nutrition electives in nutrition in medical school, and even if they ""specialize in nutrition"" they will still bill as an MD. In the interest of cost and obtaining specialized advice, an RD is your best bet."
HealthyFood,2vbtgo,threequincy,2,Sun Feb 15 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"If you don't like the texture, change it. Texture can be dramatically altered through cooking and different techniques, or even fermentation. Blend fruit into smoothies. Different varieties of healthy plant foods have different textures and taste, so experiment. Also keep in mind that our tastebuds are incredibly versatile and adaptable. Eat enough of a food for long enough of time and you'll eventually like it. Try adding in new foods slowly and hide vegetables inside dishes. You don't have to eat anything by itself, you can cover it in sauce or seasoning. I add in grated vegetables to many dinner meals.

HealthyFood,2vbtgo,xgplint,2,Mon Feb 9 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"What kind of banana? Where was it grown? Your problem seems more psychological than anything because you try a general food once, then you convince yourself you don't like all similar foods and never want to try it again.  Bananas, like every other fruit, come in all sorts of varieties with differing textures, smells and tastes. These properties dramatically alter depending on the banana's ripeness too. The best time to eat your typical cavendish banana is when it's yellow with brown spots. (Most people eat bananas underripe.)  Some bananas I've tasted are disgusting. I generally hate all bananas that are sold at supermarkets because they're like chalk. I'm rather fussy about bananas. Last week I bought some bananas from a new local farmer and they were horrible, so I won't be getting bananas from their farm again. I recently moved, and haven't yet found a supplier I'm happy with.  The best bananas in my opinion are from Dominican Republic, but I don't think they're available in the USA. Australian bananas can be good, they can also be bad, it depends what area of the country they're grown, what soil they're grown in and how they're grown. Depending on the state in the USA, produce can be full of flavor or completely tasteless. I have a list of countries to avoid bananas from. I usually look for smaller bananas with more curve and brighter in color.  I've been to a lot of different countries and have tried many bananas, so I know a bit about bananas.  Maybe try some dates. There are many varieties from different countries, so find one that you like and get back to us."

HealthyFood,2vbtgo,terrygRYB,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"Your friends are slightly right. For me, the key in making fruits and vegetables taste delicious is how you dress it. There are other alternatives besides Ranch or French Onion.  If you plan on making it a meal, how about using other cooking methods such as baking (brussel sprouts,kale) or stir frying vegetables.   If you plan on using it as a snack, try using other dressings and dips such as balsamic vinegar with pesto or hummus.   If you're not sure about trying new sauces, grab snack versions in the supermarket. For example, I've seen places sell small portions of hummus with baked crackers."
HealthyFood,2vbtgo,BlissfulEating,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:39:38 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, try everything, not just different types of fruit/veg but also preparations. Roasting cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower brings out different texture than steaming. Mashing cauliflower makes it seem like mashed potatoes, and creamed or sauteed spinach is vastly different from a baby spinach salad.   Flavor isn't just the domain of the unhealthy. There's infused olive oils, various herbs and spices, all kinds of things that you can add to your veggies that are just as tasty but aren't super calorie dense.   Fats aren't an enemy - you need fats to process fats. The key is type of fat and the amount. A sliver of butter over some steamed carrots isn't going to kill your arteries, nor a strip's worth of bacon bits tossed with your steamed cauliflower."
HealthyFood,2vbtgo,TheGallifreyan,1 point,Mon Feb 9 20:17:52 2015 UTC,"As mentioned before, texture can be changed with different cooking techniques.  I second the comment on needing fat.  Your body actually burns fat for long term energy, so trying to cut it out entirely, plus cutting your other energy source, sugar, is likely to result in some issues.  Plus, there is a huge difference between processed white sugar, and natural sugar in fruits.  Have you tried juicing your fruits or veggies?  Or green smoothies?  The idea is you make an awesome smoothie, like orange, pineapple, and mango, but you put in some healthy greens, like kale or spinach.  The smoothie tastes amazing, but you are getting your body the green goodness it needs."

Then I will throw all that stuff over a nice bed of baby greens. I might include some fresh herbs. tomato or avocado over it. Not sure how many calories in this, but it shouldn't be anywhere near 400.  It's very satisfying meal with both cooked and fresh ingredients.

HealthyFood,2v0sr9,threequincy,4,Fri Feb 6 20:37:25 2015 UTC,"Going vegetarian is a good point. In terms of the environment, the production of meat is by orders of magnitude more resource intensive than plants. In terms of nutrition, animal fats are no longer the bogeyman they used to be, but recent research suggests that limiting red meat consumption could lower cancer risk. Going full vegetarian is out of the question for most people (myself included), but conscientious consumption of less and better raised meat is something anyone can do.   Most people look at sustainably raised meat and think ""How could I possible afford this expensive meat?"". What they are really saying is ""How could I possibly afford this expensive meat while eating meat in the amounts I am currently eating?"" Most people eat way more meat than they need, it's a matter of adjusting the amount that they want. An environmentally conscious meat eater sacrifices nothing of their health by reducing their meat consumption and purchasing sustainably raised and arguably more nutritious meat. They can devote the same budget to their meat consumption, while incorporating more resource-friendly proteins like beans and small wild caught fish into their diet."
HealthyFood,2v0sr9,xgplint,1 point,Fri Feb 6 22:10:59 2015 UTC,"Most people don't care enough though. They want cheap meat, and they're willing to ignore or be ignorant on how that's accomplished. If you start buying pasture raised free range animal products then you'll subsequently reduce consumption and it becomes easier to eliminate completely because you start prioritizing how much money you can justify.  For me, I can't justify the cost. Per week my partner and I spend less on food than what some individual people spend on a single meal out. Adding meat, even if it weren't sustainable, would add unnecessary extra expense.  When you add up all the benefits — improved health, less expenses, better environmental sustainability — vegetarianism becomes a no-brainer. People say it's hard, but it's not. What would be hard for me would be going back to regularly eating animal products. What could possibly justify such a radical decision?"
HealthyFood,2v0sr9,TheBaconDrakon,1 point,Fri Feb 6 22:21:26 2015 UTC,"A little thing I do to make my fish consumption more sustainable is to try and only eat fish, like tilapia, that are easy to farm sustainably. Now fish, like cod, have MSC sustainable labels and stuff and that's all good, but I regard those fish stocks to be sustainable for now rather than sustainable in the long term.

Then I started thinking about the issue rationally, put a greater focus on my personal health and environmental sustainability, and realized it really wasn't that hard. Now I look back at the days when I told myself and others that 'I just loved meat too much' and 'I could never give up eggs and cheese' and think how silly I was being.

I think it's causing both problems.  Either you give up because it's too cognitively taxing to try to keep up (food companies win in that case) or to the other side and end up obsessed because of the need to know all the tricks and relabeling that hides bad stuff in otherwise great food.

What about starches?  If animal fats and dairy are not in favor:  Slice an apple, use a tablespoon of peanut butter as dip. You'd be surprised how filling this is. If you feel like it, you could spread the PB on a couple of graham crackers or half a slice of wheat toast and top with your apple slices. Use ""old fashioned"" PB, the kind that you have to mix. Any other type contains mix ins like molasses and/or hydrogenated oils.  Hard boiled eggs are also good and filling calories. Boil half a dozen in advance.  For a snack, slice up one or two and alternate with slices of tomato, season wtih salt n pepper and top with a pinch of coarse chopped basil.   You could prep some light egg or tuna salad ahead of time (use cottage cheese instead of mayo) and tap into it with a stone-ground-wheat cracker and/or celery sticks.  Vegetables are hard to go wrong with. Cucumber slices with balsamic vinegar, olive oil a dash of cumin and salt n pepper make a grand snack with high water content, fiber, good fats from the olive oil, everything that keeps you full. For more variety, add pre-washed cherry tomatoes, pre-washed arugala/baby spinach, pre-sliced bell pepper, all things you can keep for about a week ready-to-eat in a cold fridge.  If dairy and animal fats are okay: Pop open a tin of sardines, anchovies or smoked herring in olive oil. I always keep several tins of these on hand in a variety of flavors. Spread a thin layer of low fat cream cheese on wheat toast, lay a filet or two on top. Small fishes are excellent ""convenience"" protein, as they are low in mercury levels (unlike tuna), and have TONS of omega 3's. Save the rest of the fish for breakfast or lunch the next day. Great on toasted bagel or on top of a light and colorful salad.  Nonfat greek yogurt with half a banana and some walnuts is also very filling.

This is just some food for thought though, not trying to imply this is why you are hungry."

If it's the heaviness of it, use beans, lentils, or other whole grains like barley, gradually substituting more and more meat. Chili and stews are a great way to start the switch.  If it's the flavor, small bits of meat used for flavoring rather than the main ingredient are really effective. Crumbled bacon or shredded chicken on a salad, good chicken stock in an otherwise vegetarian soup, etc. Cook some zucchini fritters in bacon grease.  If it's the satisfaction of fat, make sure you're getting enough healthier fats. Avocado, olive oil, etc. Even the considered use of butter can be effective.  Also, mushrooms make a fantastic meat substitute for both the weight and flavor. Choose flavor mushrooms (not your typical white button ones) and dry roast them in a skillet over medium heat until they give up all their water. When they turn brown and shriveled they provide a very similar mouth feel and savoriness. Add a handful of dried porcinis to vegetable soup, it makes a world of difference!"

There are much healthier plant based protein sources easily and widely available now. Paleo diets get SAD eaters to focus more on whole foods, which is good,  but they are based on a lot of junk ""science"" (naturalistic fallacy plus not even based on real paleo diets) and don't do well compared to whole foods plant based diets.    Also,  if you have healthy testosterone levels you don't need to eat crap food to boost it. More is not always better. Excess testosterone isn't good. Male or female,  we all need the right balance of hormones not some bro science obsession with testosterone. Since you say you have low testosterone,  talk to your doctor for legit ways of boosting it without screwing up a healthy diet with junk like bacon and eggs whose dietary intake does correlate with less health."
HealthyFood,2tz4wp,M4124124,3,Wed Jan 28 19:21:41 2015 UTC,"In my experience working as a nutritionist, it's become very apparent that different people thrive on different diets. While some people thrive on plant based, others do better with meat in their world. Hormones are stored in fat tissues and when it comes to eating meat- it's best to choose organically sourced, grass fed options as much as possible.   When it comes to cholesterol, your body actually makes most of it, your dietary intake shouldn't play a huge role in your blood levels. At the same time, that being said what you eat plays a huge role on how much cholesterol your body makes- specifically if you eat a diet/live a lifestyle that chronically stresses out your organs.   You might find this talk interesting in regards to the testosterone question: https://www.bulletproofexec.com/video-hacking-your-hormones-with-john-gray-of-men-are-from-mars-women-are-from-venus/  and perhaps some more good info here: http://anabolicmen.com/100-ways-to-increase-testosterone-levels-naturally/  Hope that helps a bit! :)"

So I think what the study actually implied was to eat less meat, specifically red meat, not cut all meat out all together. Healthy eating is about balance not exclusion."

It's about balance, substitute some meat with nuts and beans, eat more fish and less red meat and try to avoid processed foods. Being too limited in your diet may reduce the overall nutritious value of the diet.   Exactly. Conventional nutrition advice is correct. Eating less meat, less fat, and more plants is good for you. But restricting whole food groups is bad. Everything in moderation, with an emphasis on vegetables.  I kind of like to view the keto/paleo (but not the type of paleo that eats mostly fish and vegetables, the reddit kind that eats mostly bacon and steak)/carbs are evil people the same way I do conspiracy theorists: They're ignoring decades of nutrition research, and choose instead to take minor findings regarding meat and fat and blow them way out of proportion in terms of importance and base their entire diets on them.   Just because you can lose weight on a specific diet doesn't mean it's therefore the healthiest diet or the one true and correct way to eat. It just means that you lost weight, but weight is not the be all and end all of health.   I'd like to see the cancer rates of keto-dieters in 30 years."

All the veggies you could hope for- broccoli, baby corn, mushrooms, zucchini, onions, peppers. The sandwich station had some pretty good veggie toppings.

I'll try to keep this short. Your wife should slow down and take a deep breath. One enlightening thought is of how much we know now of the science of our bodies and the properties of what's around us- including what food we ingest. Eating healthy is a lot more than meets the eye for most- especially those fed media based grabs of information here in the US. I eat healthier after being on the brink of killing myself in poor health, so as my partner lives with me and my child outside of town, he's pretty well exposed to whatever choices I make. That doesn't mean he's had a full transition from American junk and Fast Food. Your gut has to be able to work through what you ingest. If I don't think about his system still needing baby steps it's easy to upset his body.  Look up FODMAPS, read about nightshades, grab any time  you will spend to brush up your knowledge of what happens to our bodies when we mix these foods in to our system. You and your wife may need to be pickier about a larger portion of your diet until your body can more readily accept the different varieties of food. Red meat, not accepted by our bodies. Some plants are better raw, some will mess with her hormones and the babies. Many things are better prepared in a certain way, with a certain food combined with it to unlock nutrients, or some food categories are better left to be consumed at separate times.  I think starting off it can be a lot for many people to want to consider, but once you start learning it's information you'll have for the rest of your life and you're that much better off for it. I and a few others I've known to go through an experience that pushes them in to this kind of learning have become infatuated with it and have been so far better off. Having the background push to make more considerable options with your body changes your whole life. I hope this gives you plenty of ideas so you might start changing your journey for the better, as you seem to wish. I'm completely up to sharing more if you want to hear anything. I went through a lot considering my own health and that of the family around me- next and near to death experience to a completely flipped healthy. It's been eye opening. Just inform yourself."

They know what sells and how much greed/""profit"" they need to slake. Take a view that they do not have your best interest at heart because they don't have one.  Snacking is not for everyone and is not necessary. You may seem like you are saving time by snacking on some bullshit granola bar but you are not-they are taking your health and cash (aka time/life) through sugar, excess salt, cheap oils/fillers and subpar  nutritional ingredients.  Fasting can improve you mental and physical state. That said we have semi-limited willpower. Don't walk by the snack places ...they put them in high traffic areas on purpose.  Below are ideas on healthy ""snacks""  Go to whole foods or anywhere with decent bulk nuts/seeds. Walnuts/almonds/pecans/sunflowerseeds/a few brazil nuts/. Throw in freeze dried unsweetened blue berries/cranberries/cherries. Now you have trail mix. Portion it into a large canister and then transfer a day or a few days into ziplocks or small canisters.  You only need 1-2 handfuls.  Fruit is fine. Bananas/apples/Oranges(you may want to pre-peel them). If you buy dried avoid sweetened varieties.

HealthyFood,2t7hra,BeginnerLevelFoodie,1 point,Wed Jan 21 20:23:27 2015 UTC,"This won't be awesome, but potentially palatable.  Ok, so thaw the tilapia in the fridge overnight, or if you need it same day you can thaw it in a bowl of cold water.  Dice the tomato (two, if you have them), making sure to keep all the juice. In a soup pot that can hold at least a gallon, saute tomatoes with some fat (oil, butter, bacon grease, whatever) with a light sprinkle of salt and pepper for maybe 3 minutes over medium heat. Add a gallon of water to the pot and crank the heat up to get it to boil. While it heats up, peel the outermost layer of leaves off the cabbage. Slice the cabbage into thin strips (somewhere between 1/4 to 1/2"" wide), making sure to leave out the solid core. When the water boils, add the cabbage, 1/4 cup dried dill, 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1tbsp onion powder, 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper. If your spice rack for some reason came with caraway, fennel, or anise seed, throw in 2tbsp of the first, or 1tbsp of the others. NOT BOTH. Stir everything together and reduce heat so that the surface just barely bubbles (this is called a simmer). When the cabbage is soft but not mushy (check at 20 minutes and every few minutes thereafter), turn the heat off. Add salt and pepper to taste, a bit at a time; you can always add more, but can't take it out once it's in. The soup will stay hot while you make the fish, don't worry about it.   Heat up a skillet large enough to hold your fish filet, over medium heat. Pat that tilapia dry with a couple paper towels. Sprinkle lightly on one side with salt and pepper, and some garlic powder from your spice rack. Add a tbsp of whatever fat (a flavorful fat like butter or bacon grease is best here) and swirl it around to coat the pan. Add the fish, spiced side down, sprinkle a little more salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the unspiced side that is now facing up. Cook for 3 minutes. Flip over using a spatula and a fork or tongs if necessary. Cook for another 3 minutes and maybe another couple depending on the thickness of your filet. It should be flaky and not transparent all the way through. Add the fish to a plate.  Toast the bread until crunchy. Serve fish with a bowl of cabbage soup, using the bread to dip in the soup."

HealthyFood,2t7hra,kziv,1 point,Thu Jan 22 01:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, they will just get mushy. However, you can cut the bread into cubes after toasting and add it just as you serve the soup. They will stay crunchy for a bit, plus toasting brings out the grain flavors. But at that point you might as well save the effort and just dip your toast in.  A big part of what makes a meal interesting is a balance between similarities and differences in flavors and textures. Mushy croutons in a mushy soup would be boring. But a bit of crunch suddenly brings the soup to life because of the contrast. At the same time, note that the flavors in the fish and soup have the same family of flavors (Eastern European). This allows the dishes to work together to form a cohesive meal rather than a hodgepodge of random foods."

You're asking us to justify something that isn't true -- that organic food is just healthier and better in general.  As far as I'm aware, science has not shown this to be true.  The Mayo Clinic on organic foods:   Organic food: Is it more nutritious?  Probably not, but the answer isn't yet clear. A recent study examined the past 50 years' worth of scientific articles about the nutrient content of organic and conventional foods. The researchers concluded that organically and conventionally produced foodstuffs are not significantly different in their nutrient content."

These are foods that you should always try to buy organic (dirty dozen) and things that have less traces of pesticides, so you can save money by buying conventional (clean fifteen). This will help you transition into eating more organics, because it can be expensive! Here is an article and list of foods...   http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/health/the-dirty-dozen-and-clean-15-of-produce/616/  I want to point out that there are many other benefits to eating organic and locally grown foods, such as supporting your local economy, less harm on the earth, and less pollution from transportation and chemical manufacturing.

HealthyFood,2t3cbu,TheYogi,2,Wed Jan 21 01:02:21 2015 UTC,"Most people don't understand just how problematic synthetic pesticides are not just for the environment and farm workers, but our entire society.  Did you know that one of the most popular families of pesticides used in conventional agriculture, organophosphates, has been widely implicated in severe developmental neurotoxicity issues in children?  As these studies showcase, these pesticides, found in normal amounts in children, not children with high exposure, are implicated in reduced IQ and cognitive abilities:   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507778 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21507776 http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1003160/ http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2010/05/17/peds.2009-3058.full.pdf+html http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978   Take a few minutes to ponder the ramifications; the food we eat may literally be making us dumber.  And yes, food is a major pesticide source despite what industry might claim: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18414640.  Continuing on, the most important enzyme responsible for breaking down these pesticides in the human body is called serum paraoxanase.  Some people have a lot of paraoxanase activity and are able to break down the pesticides really fast.  Guess which subpopulation scientists are beginning to find has significantly reduced paraoxanase activity?  People with autism: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16297937 -- and this year a large study found associations between organophosphates and autism: http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/8978.  More work needs to be done on this front, but the early findings are concerning to say the least.  The data against organophosphates continues to pile up and has resulted in the thousands of scientists represented by the Union of Concerned Scientists wanting organophosphates banned.  Unfortunately, politics wins at the EPA: http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/epa-and-pesticides.html  There will be a time when society looks back in shame on its use of synthetic pesticides.  But make no mistake, the greed of chemical manufacturers and the cognitive dissonance of those who utilize these pesticides will result in unquantifiable damage before we get to that point.  Educate yourself and do what you can to protect your family in the meantime."

If you don't mind me asking, I saw that it had only mentioned fruits/veggies in the study. Are similar chemicals in meats of any sort?  EDIT: And how do I know which foods have the pesticide and which don't?"
HealthyFood,2t3cbu,kog,3,Wed Jan 21 00:57:33 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, yes, pesticide residues can be found in meat as well as eggs and milk.  It's pretty much impossible to know which foods have pesticides and which don't.  It's frustrating because a conventionally labeled piece of produce may have been grown with zero pesticides whatsoever but the fertilizer was synthetic or they're not certified organic.  I personally would be ok eating such food but there's no way to know.  As such, I simply go the organic route.  Is organic perfect?  No.  But for the regular consumer, it's the best thing we have."

HealthyFood,2t0g3j,VideoNovah,6,Tue Jan 20 03:25:54 2015 UTC,"Hi VideoNovah! So not sure if I can offer any sort of professional opinion, but I have been focusing on our household diet for a while now, and I think I've picked up enough to give a quick few tips:  It's all about your daily routine. If you can narrow down a set number of foods that you like so much (and are healthy) that you would be willing to eat everyday - foods that are actually good to eat every day - you are already well ahead of the curb. Here are a list of foods I have made it a point to eat at least once every two days (that way I have a variety, since I get bored easy.) I suggest, if money is not an object, go to the grocery store and buy all these foods so that you can try them. With this routine and general guidelines, my husband and I have lost at least two pant sizes within a few months - we do not work out and we occasionally will cheat maybe once every month.    greek yogurt (0% and plain, we eat it at least five times a week.) blueberries (in my yogurt) chia seeds (in my yogurt, remember to stir them around and let them sit for a little bit, I had to get used them, use to think they were gross) banana (either for breakfast or a late morning snack) apple (sliced with almond butter/coconut butter for a snack after lunch) one cup of hot tea (with organic honey, morning or before bed, any type of tea is good) almond milk (you can make it rather easily, or just buy it, unsweetened) oatmeal (for days I don't want greek yogurt) eggs (fried only on the weekends, I'll boil them for throughout the week, quail eggs are so good for you but I can't ever find them)   I also just generally recommend eating: quinoa (instead of rice), whole-grain (instead of whole wheat or white), corn tortilla chips (instead of any other chips), frozen kefir (instead of ice cream), kale chips (If you can cook make kale chips. Hell, if you can make plantain chips and sweet potato chips and mix them up and snack on them throughout your shift), grapefruit (If you can stand them, eat them as much as you can, they fill you up, they are the perfect snack and are super good for you), broccoli (in your pastas, eggs, soups everything, and sweet potato (see broccoli).   One thing about money. Understand that healthier foods, sadly, are more expensive. Organic for example, is important for certain foods. I know apples are one of them, but you can look that up later I'm sure. So just remember that if you are being real about this, you have to accept that food will eventually become a financial decision if you want to eat well.   Buy things with the least number of ingredients. This is a quick and easy way to determine if something is good for you.   Check the label. Can't emphasize that enough. Seriously, once you start reading labels you're gonna be like, ""WTF WHERE IS ALL THIS SODIUM COMING FROM"" Most of the time I don't even know what the hell I'm looking at when I read those labels, but I do know when it looks like there are chemicals in my food and if there is a big mg number that probably shouldn't be that big. Also helps to know the daily % of the nutrients/vitamins in the food.  If you can cook buy as much produce as you can cook with, and cook it. Produce is cheaper and also healthier than any prepackaged food. Any raw ingredients are great ingredients.  I like to just buy tons of stuff and make a new recipe by throwing things into a soup. As long as it's all veggies, it's gonna be healthy. (the other day I made some kind of lemony leek mushroom and hominy soup.. bro I don't even cook and it was orgasmic.)  I also recommend a book called Superfoods, RX. It is a great easy to use book that I read when I'm eating, I'll look up avocados if I'm eating an avocado.   P.S. I'm sorry I got really stoned before I responded to this. I hope I was at least a little helpful.  TLDR: have a routine to eating healthy food, read labels, buy things with less ingredients listed, know it may cost more, eat more produce."

HealthyFood,2sqbfv,lnfinity,7,Sat Jan 17 13:17:00 2015 UTC,I wish more people understood that veganism...or vegetarianism...can have economic and environmental motivations. I'd happily consume more meat if I felt the industry wasn't so fucking terrible for the economy and the environment. I wish there were more small farmers rather than these enormous goliaths of meat and staple crops manipulating regulations and pumping pollutants into the air water and soil.
HealthyFood,2sqbfv,fevertree,2,Sat Jan 17 14:59:46 2015 UTC,"I became a vegetarian for a few years until I started only eating meat I personally killed, or was raised by people I knew and butchered by them as well. I kind a local butcher who made an arrangement with my now ex family and to this day I get my meat and poultry from them.  It's longhorn as well, very good stuff. I still hunt birds and eat pheasant, and occasional fish. But I cannot, for the life of me, walk in and buy bulk chicken breasts frozen or meat from Tyson foods and eat it. And the reason I started eating meat again? I spoke to Ted nugent, who said he would encourage me to stay vegetarian if I could not find meat that was killed in a respectful way. He was/is crazy as a loon mostly, but that sentence was true."
HealthyFood,2sqbfv,-Cerberus,0,Sat Jan 17 18:04:42 2015 UTC,What's so respectful about killing an animal for your dining pleasure?
HealthyFood,2sqbfv,KerSan,3,Sat Jan 17 18:44:22 2015 UTC,"Hunting an animal in the wild, or raising it and respecting it is better. If you don't see that, that's fine,we will never agree. Its your opinion and they can't be wrong."
HealthyFood,2sqbfv,-Cerberus,-3,Sat Jan 17 19:40:45 2015 UTC,Better is not good.
HealthyFood,2sqbfv,KerSan,2,Sat Jan 17 20:51:37 2015 UTC,Small farms are often worse environmentally than large ones per pound of meat produced. They just produce less so they seem better but the reason why factory farms exist is because there are efficiencies gained with scale.  Veganism is better for the environment because eating plants directly is generally more efficient than growing plants to feed animals to feed people.
HealthyFood,2sqbfv,M4124124,1 point,Sat Jan 17 21:01:04 2015 UTC,I'm sure they can be...but personally...after raising chickens and ducks (no more than 25 at a time) it is my belief that farming only damages the environment if you are trying to get a higher yield out of your livestock than the land will allow. Also...smaller farms = more jobs...and a greater variety of produce. That's probably true for most sectors. I'm sure you've seen images like this one... http://i.imgur.com/k0pv0.jpg ...imagine how many jobs there would be if these companies were split up. I know this sounds like an Ayn Rand nightmare and I know the counter argument of efficiency is to be made...but the most efficient mode of production is for robots to make everything and then what...
HealthyFood,2sqbfv,fevertree,4,Sat Jan 17 21:23:36 2015 UTC,"Did you use any outside inputs whatsoever to feed your livestock? If so,  what environmental cost may you have not seen?  Also,  consider the land necessary for such farms if everyone ate animal products from farms like that.    As far as jobs,  yeah,  of course inefficiencies lead to more people working.  But at what cost?  And could we employ these people in other ways if we switched priorities to repairing ecological damage,  encouraging the arts, lowering class sizes,  enjoying services like massage and fitness classes,  and even just having people work fewer hours for a better, living wage? I'd rather see those things versus justifying the needless torture and killing of sentient beings along with ecological destruction and generally worse health outcomes, too."
HealthyFood,2sqbfv,M4124124,1 point,Sat Jan 17 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"I've known several vegetarians who chose to be that way, not because they felt it was wrong to kill animals, or because they couldn't bear to eat a living being, but instead because it was much better for the environment.  I hadn't even really thought of it before, until I met one such vegetarian, and then it made much sense to me.  The locovore movement is really the best way to go for the environment.  In my moms home town, there are many amish people, and it is possible to get any in season fruits and veggies from their farm stands.  My mom also gets all her eggs from the local Amish.  If you want, you can even get your chickens from them."
HealthyFood,2sqbfv,esoper1976,4,Sat Jan 17 18:08:18 2015 UTC,Vegetarian diets in the mediterranian (my personal hands on experience is Israel but it is certainly not exclusive) and other cultures taste so much better than in the states because they don't try to imitate meat and the instead enjoy the flavors and benefits of unprocessed vegetarian meals.  Complaining that soy nuggets don't taste like meat is like complaining that moonlight is a poor substitute for sunlight.  Just enjoy the legumes veggies fruits etc. Without feeling the need to trick yourself into thinking it's more satisfying when it's shaped like a chicken and dipped in ketchup.
HealthyFood,2sqbfv,lolhaibai,1 point,Sat Jan 17 21:22:44 2015 UTC,"Some people just like the variety though. Like, I love tacos and nachos and burritos even though they are mostly the same stuff arranged differently. Beans and rice are fun and all, but so is eating a burger, or chicken nuggets, especially if you used to love them pre-vegetarian and have a nostalgic connection. Food is not 100% about just the nutrients, but the enjoyment. Some people enjoy that. I haven't heard vegetarians complain about the ""realness"" of fake meat, actually - just the actual meat eaters. The vegetarians that I know personally are grateful that there are options, which are ever increasing - there were many fewer options for those 30 years ago who pretty much just had tofu and beans. Which are good, but can get boring to some people.   Also, the point of the article (at least how I understood it) is that why spend all the effort and money and animal abuse for sub-par food when you can make basically the same quality food, but better for the environment and animals. Boca chicken vs cafetería chicken, pretty similarly not ""real"" tasting. Not boca vs a nice medium rare grass fed steak, then complaining that the boca isn't as good"

HealthyFood,2s9j8r,StuWard,2,Tue Jan 13 19:38:06 2015 UTC,"You can eat something sweet that at least has some nutritional benefit like fruit or yogurt. You'd be surprised how many variations of fruit and yogurt you can make (e.g. shopped up tropical fruit layered with yogurt and made into popsicles). This may not be something you're interested in getting into, but I recently got a food dehydrator and have been really into dehydrated fruit (because I like crunchy and chewy things more than the texture of fresh fruit). Chewy dried pears and and crunchy dried pineapple are seriously like candy to me.   If you want to try to get away from eating anything sweet after dinner, you could find a different thing to get in the habit of doing right after you eat. As soon as you start getting the urge to eat a sweet dessert, try drinking a big glass water, drinking herbal tea, or brushing your teeth. Or you could try waiting it out - tell yourself that you'll do the dishes then see if you still feel like eating more. Often it just a takes a few minutes for our brains to get the message that we're full.  I also have a sweet tooth and I've mostly broken the habit of an after supper sweet. I tell myself that if I can consistently avoid sweet desserts from day to day, then I can occasionally go out and get a really fantastic treat and enjoy it. Whenever I'm tempted by desserts, I look at them and think, ""Yep, I know what that tastes like. Its really not worth breaking my healthy eating streak for""."

Eating more fruit and cutting out diet soda and refined sugars (though later I was able to reintroduce that into my diet in a balanced way)  were very helpful in eliminating that need.   If you have enough self control around these things I think you can get some fancy box of pralines, some type that you like that is a little pricey and then 4 times a week enjoy one piece after your meal and really savor it.   Another thing I like is making a hot cup of hazelnut coffee with a bit of whole milk. Or a packet of Swiss Miss. It's 90 calories. I think that's manageable."

You can stir-fry/saute almost anything and it will come out well, just add a little pepper and soy sauce or light dash of salt.  Baked potatoes or backed yams are also easy and healthy, bake about an hour at 400 until a fork easily inserts in them.   Start off slow and look up recipes as you go - bring home one or two new veggies each week with the intention of looking up an easy recipe for it. Troll this sub for easy recipes, and explore VegRecipes, budgetveggie, EatCheapAndHealthy, and Paelo. Pick out a few recipes each week that are simple, and then make a shopping list."

Just make sure you get natural oats and not the processed, sugary flavored ones Meat that expires soon: I know this might sound gross, but it saves me a ton of money. My grocery store marks down all meat the day it's set to expire. You can either buy it and prepare it right then, or throw it in the freezer to use later. Beans, chickpeas, legumes, etc: As other posters have said, they're hearty enough to make an entire meal, and much cheaper than meat. I especially love beans in tex-mex style meals, i.e. black bean enchiladas or ""burrito bowls""   Hope this helps!"

HealthyFood,2rwccm,joshbarkey,3,Wed Jan 14 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"I like to ""sneak"" veggies into pasta sauce. I also like to pre-make meals for when things get busy. Here's what I do:  Ingredients (I don't measure - just throw in how much you want/what you have)   garlic onion shredded carrots chopped bell peppers sliced mushrooms chopped celery baby spinach several cans of pasta sauce oil salt, pepper, basil, oregano frozen precooked meatballs   Heat a large pot on the stove, add oil, and saute the vegetables (depending on how much you've chopped and the veggies you're using, you'll probably want to do this in batches). When they're soft-ish, dump them into a bowl and return the empty pot to the stove.  Brown the meatballs to your liking. When they're done, add the vegetables back in, dump in the cans of pasta sauce, and add some pepper and your spices (I don't add salt until the end to avoid over-salting)  Simmer the whole mess for as long as you want. I usually do about an hour while I do something else.   Usually I freeze this into batches, so I have something healthy-ish and easy to prepare. Defrost in the fridge for a day or two, then reheat on the stove/serve over pasta.  Another good way to work more veggies in is to puree them and mix them into sauces/casseroles etc. I also like to mix steamed finely chopped cauliflower into rice. It cuts down on calories too and I don't notice the difference. Just chop up some cauliflower, steam it in the microwave, run it through a food processor or crumble it with your hands after it's cooled, then mix with cooked hot rice."
HealthyFood,2rwccm,Klaer,2,Sat Jan 10 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"I find I can even hide many of the ""boring""/non-traditionalveggies in pasta sauces, too. I sometimes blend up or shred carrots or cauliflower and throw it in the sauce and don't taste a thing."
HealthyFood,2rwccm,Altostratus,3,Sat Jan 10 19:59:10 2015 UTC,"Thin sliced zucchini can replace pasta--when covered with sauce, the taste isn't noticable.  I also like to put mashed up butternut squash in my macaroni.  I melt some REAL butter, and add some flour and some milk and let the sauce thicken.  Then I add my cheese (I have to use something like velveeta, because I'm on a medication that means I can't have real cheese which SUCKS, but if I could use real cheese, I'd do a good cheddar and maybe a swiss and whatever else I wanted to put in there) and then I add about a cup of smashed squash after the cheese has melted.  (I would guess the recipe is about 2tbsp butter, 2 tbsp flour, 2 cups milk, 2 cups cheese, 1 cup squash, but I don't really measure much).  I pour the sauce over my noodles (I like to use the colorful kind made with different kinds of veggies--spinach, beet, carrot etc.) and bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes until thick and bubbly.  Edited to add: here is how I prepare the squash:  take one butternut squash, and cut it in half. Scrape out the seeds.  Put a small pat of butter in each half where the seeds were.  Wrap each half in tin foil and bake in the oven at 350 for 45 min-an hour.  When done, the insides will be nice and soft, and you can scrape them out with a spoon.  Scrape out all the squash insides and mash them with a fork or a potato masher or even in a tiny food processor (though it is soft enough not to need this).  You can then freeze the squash in one cup portions for use in the future. (I try to get a smallish squash, but even then there is always more than I need for one recipe.)"

Although it may sound unconventional, if you want quick and easy its simple to just cook yourself some: chicken, steak, or fish and eat a couple of vegetables to go along with it.  Eating primarily meats and vegetables is the healthiest way to eat.  Raw veggies are best for you as well.  Eat leafy greens and any other vegetables and keep protein intake high.  Eat plenty of healthy fats like nuts, dark chocolate, coconut oils, olive oil, avocados.  Keep your carb intake on the lower end, but when you do eat carbs eat sources like quinoa, brown rice, rolled oats, sweet potatoes."

To help encourage your pallet to accept the change, try cutting out processed/sugary/salty/calorie dense foods. It's hard to compete with the taste and texture of those things, but if you cut them out of your diet you may find vegetables and fruits will taste better.   I used to have a pretty shitty diet, and hated fruits and vegetables. Since I have shifted to a more plants based home cooked diet I have found I absolutely love them! I used to gag at the thought of a banana, now I love them.   Just know it's good for you and keep trying. I use a masticating juicer and it produces a really nice juice, you may like it.

I try to roast/bake/grill most of my veggies which really helps the flavor of cabbage-based veggies (like broccoli and cauliflower).  I really like the carmelization and it's firm and dry (also helps when packing leftovers for lunch the next day).  Even if I steam some green beans or asparagus, I make sure it's not so cooked that it's mushy.  It should be still a little firm and have some bite.    I love fruit but usually cut them into pieces.  It's easier to not notice the skin that way."
HealthyFood,2ro67w,oneluckyduck,16,Wed Jan 7 21:34:19 2015 UTC,"I must have missed that craze, but the answer is relatively simple:  Is it better for you than Coke? Sure. Is it better for you than water? Nope.  There is nothing inherently unhealthy about Coconut water except, possibly, for its caloric content. It's a natural product and the information about its calories differ from source to source, but appear to be somewhere in the 20 to 30 kcal per 100ml range.  That means, that 1l of coconut water per day will increase your caloric intake by 200 to 300 kcal from fructose, that's far from insignificant when you are on a calorie restricted diet. It's still less than drinking the same amount in sweet coke or lemonade, but not that much less.  You may also be tempted to drink more, because it feels ""healthier"".  If the reason you are giving up soda is your desire to lose weight, coconut water isn't the best choice. Even the sugar free version of your favorite soft drink would probably be a better one.  As someone who gave up soda successfully a while ago:  No, you don't need a sweet substitute. Your body will gladly accept any substitute and will more quickly than you think accept it as the new baseline, with the added advantage that you will crave ""sweet"" a lot less in the rest of your diet as well.  I bought some 100% pure lime juice and poured a little bit into my drink of sparkling water each time: two simple ingredients, next to no calories and I love the taste. Craving ""sweets"", in my drinks or otherwise, disappeared after less than a week. I'm sure you can find a similar alternative."

HealthyFood,2ro67w,Purple10tacle,1 point,Thu Jan 8 16:43:53 2015 UTC,"Sure, in much the same way that Skittles cure scurvy.  If you suffer from a deficiency of any of those vitamins or minerals, Coconut water would indeed provide a health benefit. But, with a somewhat health conscious western diet, it's quite unlikely that you are.  Providing your body with more vitamins than it needs has, at best, no effect at all - you'll just pee them out - and some will actually have a negative effect in higher doses (Vitamin E and Selenium are linked with certain cancers for example).  There are few vitamins and minerals you may not get enough of through your regular diet, Vitamin D for example, if you don't get out much or live in a colder climate. Coconut water won't really help you there, though.  However, chances are, that, with a western diet, too many calories, and especially too much sucrose and fructose, are by far the biggest threat to your health. And, for a drink, Coconut water simply contains too much of those.  There is nothing wrong with the occasional can of coconut water and it's probably better than the occasional can of soda. But, if you have been drinking too much soda, drinking too much coconut water instead is a little bit better, but still far from ideal."

HealthyFood,2ro67w,LeCucumber,3,Thu Jan 8 01:12:51 2015 UTC,Well I guess what I mean is that it doesn't taste sweet. I see that it does contain some sugar but to me neither raw coconut nor coconut water have any sweet flavor. They taste more like a nut like an almond or walnut. But I do think it's an excellent replacement for Gatorade or power aid/ sports drinks. I'm assuming it's the electrolytes it contains but drinking a glass of coconut water can get rid of a headache for me. Sorry if I sounded so matter of fact.

HealthyFood,2ro67w,RambleRamble,2,Thu Jan 8 18:13:37 2015 UTC,The greatest attribute of coconut water that I've found is that if you drink a glass of it before bed after a night of drinking (and then another right when you wake up) your hangover will be almost non-existent.

HealthyFood,2rebwo,clammyhydra,10,Mon Jan 5 12:57:17 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking if you want to lose weight, cutting out 500 calories a day is a good start. That will get you about 1/lb lost per week. The reverse is true with gaining weight. Add in an extra 500 calories to gain about 1/lb per week.  A good way for her is to just reduce her portion sizes by a small amount each meal. It's not too terribly difficult to cut out 500 calories if you take a little from each meal.  For yourself, try adding some high calorie snacks. Almonds are great because they are relatively healthy but pack a lot of energy. Also you could ever so slightly increase your portion sizes as well.

I make big batches of food I can reheat and eat for 2-3 days. A whole chicken in a crockpot or a big batch of chili require not too much effort.

For dinner, we make it together when we get home and it's usually really simple things that take little time if you're two people making it.  Omelettes, roasted meat or fish + vegetables, big salads with chicken, fish or hard boiled eggs and he'll eat more and throw it in pasta, bread, etc.  He also sometimes eats a fourth meal (not always the healthiest but it might be nachos, sandwich, cheese on crackers...) and I just graze on lighter snacks instead."

HealthyFood,2rb11u,tzdk,2,Sun Jan 4 15:55:00 2015 UTC,I second this. It is a no-fail method for making nearly all vegetables delicious. I've also been making this cauliflower recipe a lot lately. Super quick and cuts out oil (and you can go light on the parm): https://dashingdish.com/recipe/roasted-cauliflower/
HealthyFood,2rb11u,votrepetite,2,Sun Jan 4 16:13:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on what healthy means to you, but generally you'll add fewest calories for the same amount of the veggie goodness by preparing them very plainly.  So steamed or boiled.  If you don't mind calories, roasting with olive oil is great.  Herbs and spices have few health downsides (assuming you avoid pastes with oil or mixtures with salt in) so experiment with those.  To be honest, I usually incorporate vegetables into whatever I'm making rather than making additional side dishes.  So the bolognese sauce gets extra courgettes, carrots, onions, tomatoes and whatever else, the chicken gets roasted with peppers, tomatoes, courgettes, aubergines and red onions, the soup has added broccoli and cabbage.  Spinch gets added to nearly anything a few minutes before the end.  If I'm making side dishes, I tend to add spices rather than fancy preparations - the cabbage is stir-fried with caraway seeds, the peas have mint added (sorry, I know, you don't like peas), the sprouts have chilli.  Quite often I choose to make the veg the main event, so in this case, I don't mind adding the cheese sauce or the bacon if it's an otherwise healthy meal."

Boil a pot of water, put the veggies in the steamer, put the steamer in the pot with the lid on, wait 3-5 minutes depending on how crunchy you want the veggies, then remove them, and season them how you like.

Such as overnight oats, overnight chia seed pudding and paleo egg muffins are great for quick grab breakfasts. I just made myself overnight chia pudding for the next 3 days.   Also, I know what it's like to work at a food spot where the food is not the best for you. You have to start bringing your own lunch and snacks with you to work.   Since you have a week off, start practicing and getting in the groove of making bigger batches of stuff and portion them into Tupperware.   For example, bake/roast 3-4 chicken breasts. Steam/roast vegetables, cook rice, quinoa, or sweet potatoes. Depending on your size, chicken should be about the size of your fist which can range from 6-8oz. The carbs should be 1/2 cup. And you want the vegetables to be the majority of your meal.   Sorry if what I said doesn't make too much sense, I'm on my phone.

Because if you run a night shift, then getting up early will just make you tired.  Model your day around your work schedule, if you have a consistent schedule. When you wake up Monday, operate as if you were on your work schedule, but the key is keeping things consistent. In terms of your eating, sure, you're surrounding by crap in your workplace, but I know many people who are healthy who work at a McDonalds. Grilled chicken with some salad (no dressing) is feasible. If you're sick of the food, prepare your meals ahead of time. Things like boiled eggs, tuna, trail mix, carrots, etc. make great meals/snacks on the go.  There's no concrete solution.

Thaw out if needed and put into a big bowl. This is when we put stuff on it. I lather those breasts with honey. I use a ridiculous amount because I love honey chicken. Mix it up and maybe poke the chicken with a fork so some honey can inside of the chicken here and there.   Let them soak in the honey for a while. Maybe an hour maybe a night depending on how you want to do it.   Then cook the chicken on a baking pan in the oven at about 350 until inside temperature reaches 165. Chop it up and it's ready to go with the rice.   P. S. Don't add honey to the top before it goes into the oven or it will burn on top of the chicken.   For the veggies, it's really your choice. If you want to be simple just grab a bag from the grocery store that says oriental vegetables.   (I'm a simple guy with basic cooking skills.)"

HealthyFood,2qt9ra,woahclaudia,2,Wed Dec 31 05:44:28 2014 UTC,I'm going to make fra Diavolo sauce tonight with zucchini instead of noodles. Last time I put bay scallops in there too but I'm going to skip that tonight.  For the fra Diavolo sauce:  Cook 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and one chopped Serrano pepper in some butter or oil to release some flavor. (I'm also going to add a chipotle pepper with adobo sauce because I have it lying around)  Add a large can of crushed tomatoes or fire roasted crushed tomatoes if your store carries that.    Make zucchini noodles by using a potato peeler to get linguini-like peels and cook them in the reducing sauce.   Add salt and parsley to taste.   If you decide to cook shrimp or scallops you can cook them with the peppers in the first step and put them aside before adding them back in at the end. I do not cook with onion or garlic because I have an intolerance but you can add that in the first step as well. Anyone feel free to add suggestions!

HealthyFood,2qffdk,Jscsassy,2,Fri Dec 26 13:15:38 2014 UTC,"Try to sample vegetables that have been cooked properly. I recall hating some vegetables growing up simply because they were not prepared well. Also, your palate will change once you begin to adjust your diet. Try to find ways to appreciate the flavors of veggies raw or by blanching. I do not know if you like [http://greek.food.com/recipe/tzatziki-sauce-greek-cucumber-yogurt-sauce-304166](tzatziki sauce), but that is a healthy alternative to ranch dressing on raw veggies. If you do not like the taste of plain steamed vegetables, you can buy a tin of better than boullion and put a very small amount in the water to add flavor. You can also mix in other things, like fresh ginger, to add some different flavors to them."

Exercise a little self-discipline and just eat the damn vegetables.   I guess I just don't sympathize at all because picky eating was never tolerated in my household - I grew up in very much a ""you will not leave the table until you clean your plate"" environment - and as such the ability to both try new and interesting foods, and to just deal with it when they turn out not to be to my liking, seem natural to me. I hate steak with a passion: I hate the flavor, I hate the texture. And if I visit someone's house for dinner and they serve steak, I thank them profusely, eat the steak, and compliment them on it, because that is what grown adults do.  I guess it's likely that OP has no idea how to cook vegetables, which is a different problem altogether.

Maybe try blending some into a smoothie (kale, spinach, carrots, etc). or try broccoli in low fat cheese sauce, faux mashed potatoes (cauliflower-pinterest has some good recipes), I put yellow squash, zucchini, and carrots into spaghetti sauce, or you could even get a spaghetti squash (cook the squash longer than recommended) to get more of a spaghetti like texture), spinach wilts into nothingness in spaghetti sauce. Seriously I give it to my family of super picky eaters on the regular and they are none the wiser. It also helps to dice up the veggies really small and put them into recipes.

If you have the budget, go to a restaurant that has a great reputation for food quality and order something that features an ingredient you wouldn't normally eat. This way you know the ingredient is cooked and served optimally and that may help you separate not liking a food from never having had it prepared correctly.

Weight loss of article  Apple cider vinegar:       Vinegar (and other acidic liquids) have long been proposed as agents to enable weight loss;   one proposed mechanism is that it prolongs the sensation of satiety after eating.  A 2009 study on mice showed that consuming acetic acid (the active component in ACV), upregulates the expression of genes for fatty acid oxidation enzymes in the liver causing a suppression in body fat accumulation.   In a double-blind experiment, obese Japanese were assigned to three different groups based on similar body weights, body mass indexes (BMI), and waist circumference. Each group drank a 500 ml drink containing either 30 ml, 15 ml, or 0 ml of vinegar daily for 12 weeks. Those in the 30 ml and 15 ml groups had lower BMI, visceral fat area, waist circumference, serum triglyceride, and body weight to the control group of 0 ml. The 12-week weight losses were modest: 1.2 kg in the 15 ml group and 1.7 kg in the 30 ml group. These two groups consumed a similar number of calories to the control group and also performed a similar amount of exercise, so the effect is not likely to have been due to an impact on appetite or other lifestyle changes. It was concluded that consumption of vinegar might reduce obesity.      Interesting: United States v.

HealthyFood,2q6pjh,sergeanttips,0,Tue Dec 23 18:05:19 2014 UTC,"No, as it states, calories are A UNIT OF MEASURE FOR ENERGY. The chemicals used to create energy are not equal, neither is the system for which it is inserted.   For example (not for something that will happen every time): your cellular metabolics  are poised for fat burning so they will take your sugar stores and use them for fatty acid metabolism (aka fat burning). Then later you are eating, and your body restores the sugar depleted earlier. Does that mean you used the sugar for energy? No, it means these are future calories will be put in the bank until they are needed for energy, or as a storage for when you need to do reactions that require sugar to proceed.  The article is spot on for simplifying intermediary metabolism for the interested non-biochemist. Your body is too complex to simplify, understanding some intermediate nutrition is very helpful in proceeding with dieting/ fitness/ general health."

Salt is only bad for you if you are sensitive (yes, I know this is controversial).   That said, it's stupid easy to make good roast chicken and turkey and beef at home. Here's a good blog post that I used as a starting point for making roast beef. It's useful for the cooking times and donenesses. I actually brine my eye of round with honey and kosher salt overnight before I roast it and it gives it that same texture as good deli roast beef. Typically when I do a couple of eye of rounds, I also do a couple of turkey breasts in the same exact seasoning (though I add cayenne to the turkey). You can stack chicken breasts and do the same thing, etc.    Edit:  Rough numbers for the brine are   1 quart water  1/2 cup honey  3 1/2 ounces kosher salt, approximately 3/4 cup"

HealthyFood,2pi44w,sdteacher,1 point,Tue Dec 16 23:05:04 2014 UTC,"I've researched the whole nitrates debate...and basically what I remembered is that you're no better off buying the lunchmeat that says ""no nitrates"" because they DO add celery, which is a natural source of nitrates, so you're getting nitrates anyway. And nitrates are in lots of things naturally. My experience with those ""natural"" ""no nitrates/preservatives"" deli meats is that they go bad really fast, and are expensive. The deli counter has the exact same type of ingredients as the prepackaged lunchmeat. You could get a low sodium brand if you want...but honestly you don't use a ton of lunchmeat in one serving anyway, so it shouldn't be a big deal to continue using whatever turkey lunchmeat you already use. Just my opinion, but you should google the nitrate debate and decide for yourself."

HealthyFood,2pgeqr,toastpants,3,Tue Dec 16 09:43:08 2014 UTC,"As you already pointed out, there's no objective definition of healthy. That said, this meal seems pretty well balanced. The couscous will provide carbs that our bodies all need to function, tuna will provide healthy fats and protein, and frozen veggies often have more vitamins than fresh because they're picked at the height of ripeness. If sodium is an issue for you, though, you may want to check your package of couscous for how much is included and replace the flavorings with herbs and just a tiny pinch of salt. And you can try replacing plain couscous with whole wheat for a little more fiber. If you have more time, whip up a batch of some other whole grains like bulgur, barley, etc and substitute or mix with the couscous for new textures/flavors/nutrition profile.  I do something very similar as my go-to quick meal, except I prefer quinoa."

I would suggest that healthy eating isn't about boiling down all of the healthy eating info you've read into one ""perfectly okay meal"" that you eat everyday. For me, its more about finding healthy recipes and learning how to shop and remembering to use leftovers so you can keep cheap, fresh foods in the house. Don't forget to think about healthy snack foods, too.  When in doubt, look for recipes that contain more veggies, fruit and protein and less sugar, dairy, and white wheat/rice. Brown rice, quinoa, and potatoes are better than white rice, bread, or couscous. And try to avoid too much salt/sodium if you eat a lot of canned foods.  I've met a lot of people who think they can't eat healthy because they ""don't like the taste"" of healthy foods. I find that if you stop eating processed, high sugar, rich foods that are engineered to be like food-crack for our senses, your palette changes dramatically and you start to appreciate the taste of normal food much more. Sometimes it also just takes trying things in a few different recipes until you find a way of cooking it you like. And a good range of spices and reasonably healthy condiments (soy sauce, mustard, nutritional yeast, hot sauce) goes a long way to making eating healthy food enjoyable.  Best of luck!"
HealthyFood,2pgeqr,The_True-True,2,Tue Dec 16 13:47:46 2014 UTC,"Hey , to quote you, I'll agree with ""yeh its cool"" but not with ""that everyday should be ok""... Variety is key to healthy nutrition imho, this meal is a good starting point now try to vary it by substituting:  Couscous for rice/spelt/quinoa/pasta/boiled potatos Tuna for chicken/tofu/egg/beef/lentils Vegetables for salad or just other veggies."
HealthyFood,2pgeqr,M4124124,1 point,Mon Dec 22 11:22:46 2014 UTC,"Couscous is just pasta, which is processed wheat flour and therefore something you shouldn't eat too much of (processed foods tend to be lower in nutrition than whole foods). A much better alternative would be quinoa which is a whole food and also high in lysine. You could also substitute whole grains or even better whole legumes as your starch. Legumes are also a good source of protein. Frozen veggies are good, particularly if they are cruciferous veggies or other green veggies. Tuna... I don't eat meat, so call me biased if you want, but I do think there are good reasons to avoid it and especially tuna because of pollution such as mercury. I get my omega-3s from chia seeds, ground flax seeds, and other plant sources. Legumes, quinoa, and nuts and seeds are also all great sources of protein.  How do you season things? Because that often makes a big difference. If you're adding a lot of oil, salt, or sugar, that can reduce how healthy a meal is. On the other hand, many dried spices and herbs are actually quite nutrient dense and healthy in other ways. Turmeric is anti-inflammatory. Cumin has iron and calcium. I tend to use a lot of curry powder because it has those and other great seasonings. Garlic is also very healthy."
HealthyFood,2pgeqr,jang112,1 point,Tue Dec 16 20:13:43 2014 UTC,"I personally avoid tuna because of high mercury content. Couscous is just pasta, so refined wheat as someone else mentioned.  Try cooking brown rice instead and using chicken breast or salmon filets instead. Frozen veggies are fine, although fresh are always better if youc an get them."

Chop garlic. Dice raw chicken to 1/2 inch cubes. Mix garlic with lime juice (save enough juice to sprinkle on top) a pinch of pepper and salt. Toss raw chicken in to marinate.   Brush both sides of the corn tortilla lightly with 1/2 of the oil to lightly coat. Place on a pan in the oven until slightly golden (3-5 minutes) then flip. Remove after another 3-5 minutes.  In a non-stick skillet (I like the ceramic ones because they're non toxic and require very little oil) heat oil over medium high heat. Once oil is hot toss in chicken and cook through. When chicken is almost done add Black beans to heat them.   On the tostada, spread your avocado evenly to within 1/4 inch of the edges. Then layer you chicken and beans. On top of this, place shaved carrots and cilantro. Drip the remaining lime juice to finish.  Enjoy!"

HealthyFood,2p8kx4,IngwazK,4,Sun Dec 14 15:53:37 2014 UTC,That sounds like Oral Allergy Syndrome. It is not commonly recognized but related to the pollen on fruit and similar to Hay Fever. I have OAS and people just call me a baby when I explain that eating most fruit and nuts can me me puff up and sometimes my mouth bleeds. Unfortunately I love fruit but I just can't have it unless it is cooked.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_allergy_syndrome
HealthyFood,2p8kx4,GlassCactus,2,Sun Dec 14 17:42:48 2014 UTC,"Oral allergy syndrome:       Oral allergy syndrome or OAS is a type of food allergy classified by a cluster of allergic reactions in the mouth in response to eating certain (usually fresh) fruits, nuts, and vegetables that typically develops in adult hay fever sufferers.   OAS is perhaps the most common food-related allergy in adults. OAS is not a separate food allergy, but rather represents cross-reactivity between distant remnants of tree or weed pollen still found in certain fruits and vegetables. Therefore, OAS is typically only seen in tree and weed allergic patients, and is usually limited to ingestion of only uncooked fruits or vegetables.   Another term used for this syndrome is pollen-food allergy. In adults up to 60% of all food allergic reactions are due to cross-reactions between foods and inhalative allergens.

The way it works is by drying the fruits which means the % of sugar goes up! Sugar doesn't get dried out, but a lot of water does. In fact, many fruits are 80%+ water, so sugar percentage can go as high as 75%+ in many fruits without any added sugar! The added sugar fruit was probably dehydrated a lot less, and then more sugar added to get the ratio similar so the taste is similar.  In this case, there's something else going on, like a different variety of fruit because the added sugar one also has more iron and more fiber per gram.  @OP hard to say which is healthier, I would say the natural one has some better benefits because the sugars are probably more complex sugars.

I've been scheduled to have my gall bladder removed next week, so that helped me plan what to eat afterward. A lot of the information there was mentioned to me by my dietitian, but a few things are there that weren't. It'll help me diversify my diet after the surgery so I don't get bored and tempted to stray, which was kinda my initial fear."
HealthyFood,2nyjx6,HighDegree,3,Mon Dec 1 18:16:48 2014 UTC,"Be aware that somewhere between 5-10% (I suspect more based on the percentage of those I know who have had the operation) of those who have their gall bladders removed experience a permanent condition of ummmm....anti-constipation shall we say.  A much higher percentage experience the condition in the weeks after surgery and it ""fades"" in time.  Dumping syndrome is what I believe it is called.  Anything that has sugar or processes into sugars will cause you to have to make a mad run to the bathroom within 45 minutes after consumption of the item.  This means any sweets, sodas, chocolate, wine or other alcohol, bread or any other carb, and especially McDonalds (WOW McD's is a super trigger!) will mess you up."

They are one of the most guilt free foods on earth. Those eggs were never going create a chick. Why let them go to waste?

HealthyFood,2nhi5n,zpkmook,1 point,Thu Dec 18 22:25:48 2014 UTC,I'll agree with you that the conditions in commercial egg farms are horrible but that's not really what I was talking about. I wasn't talking about eggs that were fertilized either. I get eggs from my neighbors who have 8-10 hens that are not allowed around roosters. The kale you eat has just as much of a chance to create a chicken as the eggs I eat do. I do not see the moral dilemma there.
HealthyFood,2nhi5n,silverr90,1 point,Thu Dec 18 23:11:33 2014 UTC,The kale you eat has just as much of a chance to create a chicken as the eggs I eat do.   REALLY? That's completely disingenuous to the argument. Factory chickens do not eat kale first off and are a totally different animal. Supply and demand does work to a large degree as well. And even your farm eggs have tons of cholesterol and saturated fat that the food industry warps to their needs in studies. Lastly a cultural aversion to these moral pitfalls sends a clear message; don't do this bullshit or be punished. Also vegans/vegetarians use these rules as both personal and cultural tools; its an easy heiuristic that allows you to avoid the 99% of eggs and meat products that suck at the expensive of the 1% that are acceptable.

HealthyFood,2ni9t8,kodthr,4,Wed Nov 26 19:48:29 2014 UTC,"This is also something that I have struggled with when beginning a healthy lifestyle. What I have found, from trial and error is that the best way to learn is by finding one new, simple recipe at a time. Start with finding a healthy breakfast and implement it into your routine. Next week find a lunch. Then a dinner. Find some 100 and 150 cal snacks. After that, start over and find another breakfast and begin switching between the two. Keep going.  You have to find what works for you. There are so many recipes on the web just google a few and find one that peaks your interest. A shopping list from a stranger will not help much, these are skills you have to learn how to regulate on your own. Otherwise you'll feel to regulated or hate what you're eating and it will set you back to your old ways.   This is your new guideline, you're learning a new way to live and you're going to do great. One meal at a time."
HealthyFood,2ni9t8,squeeezebox,2,Thu Nov 27 07:41:05 2014 UTC,"Based on how you spelled ""tonnes"" you're not in the US so the following may not apply. In the US, most grocery stores are laid out so that fresh food is along the walls and processed/packaged food is in the aisles. The rule of thumb then becomes: only shop along the outside of the grocery store.  I do make exceptions for pasta, beans, baking goods, and frozen veggies."
HealthyFood,2ni9t8,kziv,1 point,Thu Nov 27 10:47:53 2014 UTC,"This follows from the two other responses, but you need to know what you want to cook in order to know what to put on a shopping list. Try making a meal plan for a week. Collect recipes for each, know how many servings will it make so you know how many days you can eat it as leftovers, etc.) Then look at what you need to cook those things. Put whatever you don't already have on a list and go get it. It will help to group things into produce, meat, dairy, condiments/spices, baking, and other. Do it on a computer and just copy and paste!  One trick to this is that you have to plan to cook meals only when you have time to do so. Think about what days you have time to make big meals, then plan to make enough so you have leftovers for lunches and busy days. Don't eat the same thing for lunch and supper. Also, DON'T FORGET SNACKS. If you switch to eating very healthily, you'll be miserable unless you have things you like to snack on throughout the day (hummus and crackers, carrot sticks, homemade nut mix, fruit, yogurt, etc.).   And since you're looking for a list, here are some things I find myself picking up as I run out of them (some people may not find some of these things healthy, but its my version of healthy eating):   lettuce or spinach (I find they end up going bad if I try to get both at once) avocados, peppers, cucumber, tomato, broccoli, snow peas, zucchini  apples, pears, then occasionally bananas, pinapple, mango sweet potato, carrots, onions, garlic, occasionally cabbage milk, yogurt, and eggs (sometimes I'll get soy or almond milk for variety) almond butter or peanut butter corn chips canned or dried beans (chick peas and black beans, and dried green peas for snacks) rice and pasta (brown rice and whole wheat pasta mostly) quinoa coconut milk rice cakes or crackers nuts and seeds (almonds, sunflower seeds, cashew pieces) meat (usually whatever is on sale, and I'll often cut things up into pieces and freeze them separately) fish (haddock works for most recipes that call for any kind of white fish and salmon is delicious). spices (I recommend keeping a huge spice collection) I also keep a full compliment of baking supplies - instead of buying baked goods, I'll wait until I get a craving for something at which point I'll either make a quasi-healthy version of it or be too busy/lazy and just let the craving pass.

I can't actually read the study itself (because, yes, i only have access to my phone, as i am traveling)but your Oxford journal link is just an association.  Of course high salt intake itself is going to be associated with these things - salt is a proxy for fast food, frozen food, etc. That does not mean high sodium intake is unhealthy!  Sure, high intake increases blood pressure a few points, but does that really matter in a healthy individual?  I would argue no.  Blood pressure is far too complex, and has many other factors that have been identified.  Such as potassium intake.  But guess what?  These same medical professionals you speak of (the old school nutritionists who still claim the egg is unhealthy) gave us a literally impossible recommendations in 2010. Want to know why this happens? Is because the ones giving the recommendations are not nutritionists, they are data analysts, and to them correlation means everything.  Besides, there is more to your health than your blood pressure and ""water retention""or whatever.   Here's a study showing that a 7 day low salt diet increased insulin resistance: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21036373  Here's a study where decreasing salt intake resulted in higher triglycerides/LDL and increased stress hormones  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12535503   Here's a study where both high and low salt intake were found to be unhealthy: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/11/111123132935.htm  Since you seem to like associations, high sodium excretion in urine (which is associated with high salt intake), is positively associated with (inception!)

Be warned that milk/yogurt and soymilks block berry nutrient adsorption. C'mon i found this in 2 seconds: http://www.ninjakitchen.com/nutri-ninja/healthy-living/"

HealthyFood,2mikik,TheHyruleWarrior,7,Mon Nov 17 01:10:48 2014 UTC,"I find a medium to large meal with a lot of starch like rice or potatoes with a decent amount of protein/fat from meat or things like eggs and avocados sets me up perfectly to go to bed within the next 40ish minutes.  When I want to aid sleep without sacrificing health I delay dinner by 2-3 hours so that I'm eating shortly before bed, make something that involves around a cup of uncooked brown rice and some fat and protein.  Chicken fried rice with grassfed butter, peas, finely chopped carrots and onions, chicken thighs, and an extra egg is my goto.     On the less healthy side.   Breads of all kinds, a significant amount of bread makes me sleepy.  Things like large sandwiches, big wraps, and burritos put me in chill mode. Pizza, easily the most effective food for putting me to sleep.     Sidetopics   Caffeine has a 5-6 hour half-life in humans.  Even a cup of coffee first thing in the morning will still have 10-20% of that caffeine kicking around in your system 16 hours later.  It does have effects on your sleep, especially if you drink multiple coffees/energy drinks in the morning or later in the day.  Theobromine from chocolate has a similar, but subtler sleep disturbing effect to caffeine.  But it also has a longer half-life in humans at 6-10 hours.  If you've been eating significant chocolate lately, especially dark chocolate, try cutting it out and see if your sleep improves.    I find eating the stronger cheeses like very sharp cheddar, swiss, and bleu cheese isn't a good idea at dinner.  The effect on sleep is subtle and doesn't seem to be long lived, but I've definitely noticed it.  Mild types of cheese like mozzarella don't seem to have any noticeable effect."

It takes a little time to prepare, but it's nice to sit and nibble on when doing office/computer work, and it fills you up very nicely.   ¤ Chocolate mouse made from avocado, banana and cocoa powder.  ¤ Homemade (or store-bought) dried fruits - Dried apple chips, dates or apricots give a nice kick of energy during long workdays because of the natural sugars. Watch out when buying it store-bought though and make sure to check the ingredients list for added sugar. I wouldn't recommend the store-bought banana chips, as they are almost always covered in sugar and loads of other stuff.  ¤ Nuts - A handful of Almonds, Hazelnuts or (unsalted!) peanuts is always nice to have at the ready."

Offering cheap alternatives. Promoting healthy restaurants and meals etc. People should be able to make they own choices, they should think for themselves. Those taxes are a superficial solution to a much deeper problem. It's just about money, which goes to the government at the end."

If they really wanted to help us they'd attempt to give us some lower priced healthier alternatives, not just making unhealthy food more expensive.   I'm currently a college student cooking and buying groceries for myself for the first time. I've been trying to eat healthy but its just so much more expensive buying fruits and veggies compared to less healthy foods."

Oranges and apples in bags ain't bad. Buy local greens and sweet potatoes, beans and rice. Any smart system usually does subsidize the good and tax the bad. We do know ciggarette taxes are effective. Berkely is using this a proving ground for passing legislation.

HealthyFood,2kdpbs,flingebunt,1 point,Mon Oct 27 10:50:33 2014 UTC,"That is a difficult one because sugar is high in calories and that is what makes things sweet. Also artificial sweeteners confuse your body and you are more likely to put on weight drinking them.  There is a lot of negative press against fruit juice, mostly because it is high in sugar, but they are a healthy option in moderation. However more healthy than juice is to just have fruit, which has plenty of fiber as well.  The problem is that in the western diet we are used to finishing off our meal with something sweet (eg dessert). That is probably what you need to replace. So at the end of a meal try having some fruit.  Also in the morning, if you are not a coffee drinker, then a sugar boost helps start your metabolism for the day. Once again I would say have lots of fruit, but I like a glass of fruit juice in the morning."

HealthyFood,2jf73t,MJCXX,1 point,Thu Oct 16 18:18:59 2014 UTC,"Marketers are very crafty with things like this. A label could say 'low sugar', then in small print on the back, they will tell you it is low sugar compared to their regular juice. Not low sugar in general.  No added sugar is even worse. This label makes people believe the drink doesn't have any sugar in it, or is less artificial, but then it could have just as much sugar as other juices depending on the type of fruit. Fruit contains sugar, and they can leverage this to their advantage by using the concentration and type of fruit so that it still contains enough sugar to appease your taste buds, yet they can claim it has no 'added sugar', which sounds like there is less sugar.  If you're trying to watch your sugar intake, and you like the flavour of juices that have reduced sugar, the best way to choose a good juice is to just look at the amount of sugar per 100mls and disregard any claims on the front of the label. Then look for any artificial colours or flavours, as well as preservatives. A good orange juice should preferably just contain orange juice without any other additives."

HealthyFood,2jbmbc,firemouses,2,Thu Oct 16 01:06:44 2014 UTC,"Here you go: Ingredients: 2 large red bell peppers  2 tablespoons olive oil ½ teaspoon curry powder 1 large bay leaf 1 large onion (sliced) 2 large carrots (sliced) 4 cloves garlic (sliced thin) 1 teaspoon salt 4 cups low sodium vegetable broth 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice  Directions: Turn the oven to broil.  Place bell peppers on baking sheet, place on the middle rack of the oven and set a timer for 7 minutes. Broil on one side until the timer goes off or the skin is black and blistery. Remove from the oven, turn them “one quarter” to expose an un-blistered side, set the timer for 7 minutes, and broil until the timer goes off. Do this for all four sides. Remove the peppers from the oven and place in a large closeable baggie. When peppers are cool enough to handle, remove from the bag and rub off the blackened peel. Remove seeds. Set aside.  While the peppers are roasting, heat oil in saucepan over medium heat. Add curry powder and bay leaf and stir to combine. Add onions, carrots, garlic, and salt. Continue cooking for 8 minutes more or until onion is translucent. Add broth and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer for 25 minutes.   Remove bay leaf and transfer carrot mixture to blender. Add bell peppers and purée until smooth. Stir in lemon juice. To serve, transfer soup to 4 bowls and serve while still hot."

A great way to start is sign up on a calories tracking website such as MyFitnessPal and track what you eat currently to gauge how much you need to reduce your calorie intake. From there, an easy thing to do is to start looking into ways to sub out your standard meals for healthier options. For example, zucchini instead of pasta noodles, tacos on lettuce instead of tortillas, lower calorie dressings on salads, etc..

HealthyFood,2ib9xo,mgende,6,Sun Oct 5 19:34:09 2014 UTC,"I think juice can have some health benefits, but not juice that's premade. It's just sugar water at that point, and even if it says ""100% juice not from concentrate"", that isn't the whole story. For example, OJ goes through a weird process of having orange flavor added back into it after it's made, because the juicing and pasteurization process strips it of all nutrition and flavor. But, since the flavor they add is derived from oranges, they don't have to put that in the ingredients list.  So if you really want to have a healthy juice, the best thing to do is juice your own veggies and fruits, which is expensive and time consuming. Buying fresh juice from a juice shop is a great alternative, but remember that you are still drinking liquid sugar with no fiber despite all the good stuff you are also ingesting. That's why juicing is frowned upon by some. Sticking to juices that are less sweet, like green juices, is probably better.  Or...learn to love water! Then once a day, eat a small piece of fruit to get that zing. The sugars are locked in the fruit fibers and not metabolized at all like liquid sugars.  Another option is to put freshly squeezed lemon juice in your water bottle everyday."

Anything that can last for more than a few days is probably devoid of nutrition, because it's been pasteurized and ultra processed.  I also don't know how much the fiber in the smoothies helps. That is, I don't know if the fact that the sugars are mostly liberated from the fiber when they're pulverized means that you still get that slow absorption of sugars."

Oranges are about one part each, fructose, glucose and sucrose. I believe apple juice has a lower glycemic rating, but that's because apples are about 2 parts fructose to one part sucrose. That's great when you eat an apple, but not so much when consuming so much sugar as in a glass of juice, especially since all the fiber has been removed. And especially fructose sugar.   So here's one juice you can make and it takes just a few minutes, especially when you pre-portion the ingredients in packs in the freezer. In a blender, 1 cup frozen blueberries, about a quarter cup frozen raspberries and about 4 frozen cherries. Drink with a straw. These are relatively low sugar fruits and although you've pulverized them and made the sugar more quickly available, the fiber is at least still in there. Plus blueberries pack a huge nutrient benefit.  Another quick extremely nutritious drink is matcha tea. It requires no advance planning - it's a powder you can mix in cold water. I usually pour some water and spin a whisk to dissolve it better, but it takes about a minute, at most. Matcha is a Japanese green tea that has something like a hundred times the ECG of regular green tea. Tip: You have to drink it within about 30 minutes or it turns to swamp water. Anyway, google it, it's impressive.  I recommend Almond Breeze brand almond milk. I get the 30 calorie vanilla. I used to drink milk before bed, so sometimes I add a table spoon of cream. You can also mix in cocoa. (I don't like the Silk brand - it's got some kind of thickener in it that makes me gag)  If you are going off sugar in general, after a few weeks, the blueberry drink will seem incredibly sweet and you'll pick up the sweetness in the almond milk. I don't add sugar if I make chocolate almond milk. But if I do, I add about a teaspoon of xylitol, which is at the present is thought to be a safe sugar substitute. It is not lower in calories.   The problem with adding any sugar substitute is it just makes you want more sugar , so if you use xylitol, I recommend on using small amounts.   Best of luck to you!  And then there's water.   Edit: Regarding the smoothie above and not liking the thickness - it's more like a slushy than a milkshake, but you can let it become liquid in the frig. Sometimes I make up pitchers of it and of course after a while in the frig, it's not longer a frozen drink. At that point, it has to be stirred because the blueberry skins tend to float to the top"

There are endless possibilities and most of them taste delicious. You can look up fruit water ideas.   You can also start brewing your own iced teas- there are flavored bags of herbal tea (like raspberry, mint, etc) that don't need any extra sugar. If you're in the states Teavana has some good ones (pricey but I like them). In the summer I'd make a gallon of it at a time and keep it in the fridge."

The flesh will come away naturally from the skin. For other hearty squashes (including pumpkin!) they're great cubed and tossed in curries or stir fry, just make sure to remove the rind. You can also bake them the same way as the delicata and let it cool, then mush it up with a little egg, cheese, and arugula and fill little dough shells with the mixture then bake it again. That tastes pretty rad, too. Sorry I don't have exact recipes! I pretty much roll with it. You can also bake/boil the flesh and then toss it in a food processor with chicken broth for a nice soup."

Like everything, the key is moderation and variation. I'd recommend slowly adding other greens to your salads, a bit at a time, until you're accustomed to the taste and textures of the other greens and can work your way up to a varied salad that is balanced with other greens and not based solely on spinach."

Early investigators isolated oxalic acid from wood-sorrel (Oxalis).

Rhubarb leaves contain about 0.5% oxalic acid and jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) contains calcium oxalate crystals. Bacteria produce oxalates from oxidation of carbohydrates.

It gets a bad rap because people typically overcook it and it gets very bitter. Spinach is so low calorie you can pretty much eat as much of it as you want. What I do is really simple:   1 tsp - 1 tbsp olive oil (40 - 120 kcal) Bag of spinach (80 kcal) Garlic (5 kcal) Salt   It sounds too simple but it's actually really good. Just add a tiny bit of olive oil to a large pot (I can get away with as little as a tsp), on medium heat sautee garlic for just a moment so it doesn't over cook (or it'll get hard and bitter), add a pinch of salt, then add as much spinach as you can fit and stir. Keep adding more spinach as soon as you can when the earlier bunch reduces down. Now the trick is to remove the spinach from heat as soon as it's wilted. You want it to cook for the bare minimum amount of time, too much and it will become bitter.  I like to top it with a poached egg for breakfast. Also makes a great low calorie side for dinner."

There so much out there, I don't eat fruits or salads yet I have a pretty healthy diet. Unfortunately most American food is pretty unhealthy, but if you look worldwide plenty of cultures manage to eat happy and healthy. For example, if you are a fan of Chinese food, try to find recipes that incorporate healthy stuff. Also, you should try talking to your parents about eating more healthy as well. Until you have the willpower to fight it, you have to remove the bad food choices within reach. Snacking is a problem most healthy eaters struggle with as well but there are alternatives.

Launched in September 1997 to collect fares for the territory's mass transit system, the Octopus card system is the second contactless smart card system in the world, after the Korean Upass, and has since grown into a widely used payment system for all public transport in Hong Kong,  leading to the development of Oyster Card in London.  The Octopus has also grown to be used for payment in many retail shops in Hong Kong, from convenience stores, supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, on-street parking meters, car parks, to other point-of-sale applications such as service stations and vending machines.   The Octopus card is recognised internationally, winning the Chairman's Award of the World Information Technology and Services Alliance's 2006 Global IT Excellence Award for being the world's leading complex automatic fare collection and contactless smartcard payment system, and for its innovative use of technologies.  According to Octopus Cards Limited, operator of the Octopus card system, there are more than 20 million cards in circulation,  nearly three times the population of Hong Kong. The cards are used by 95% of the population of Hong Kong aged 16 to 65, generating over 12 million daily transactions worth a total over HK$130 million.

Avoid deep fried foods and food that contains a lot of sodium. Avoid all sweetened drinks, drink lots of water instead. Try to eat lots of cooked\fresh veggies.

Also: thugkitchen.com   It might be hard to change everything at once, so don't worry about taking small steps as long as you're moving forward. One problem I used to have is that I knew what not to eat, but didn't really focus on what I should eat (if that makes sense). Nutrition for me was easier when I started focusing on things that were missing in my diet and actively trying to include them.

You don't have to quit caffeine entirely IMO but you need to scale it back to a reasonable amount. 1-2 cups of coffee per day and only in the morning.   Avoid processed foods - if you're unsure, if it comes in a package, box or tin it's probably not going to be great for you.   Each meal you eat should have some complex carbs, some lean protein and some fresh produce. For example - oatmeal, a boiled egg and an apple for breakfast; tuna, brown rice and broccoli for lunch; lean steak, a baked potato and salad greens for dinner.

HealthyFood,2h13ff,gummybear3411,2,Sun Sep 21 19:35:40 2014 UTC,"If you're trying to avoid carbs, you're going to want to eat plenty of fat so you won't go crazy with cravings. Sure, peanut butter is calorie dense, but most of the calories are from fat (and protein) which will keep you full and encourage you to eat less throughout the day."
HealthyFood,2h13ff,Fishercat,1 point,Sun Sep 21 20:11:14 2014 UTC,"Sure. If you like carrots (and apples), you'll probably also like jicama. It's good stuff: tasty, high-fiber, low-cal, etc.  Nuts are fat and calorie dense, but the fats are healthy ones, and they also pack a decent protein punch, so you're getting some bang for your caloric buck. You said you were concerned about cutting carbs and calories. There are very few foods I can think of that combine high protein/low carb/low fat. Egg whites are the notable exception, but by themselves, they're gross. And then you've got egg yolks to either use up or waste.   So anyway, I wouldn't avoid peanut butter, just don't go downing a half cup of the stuff at a sitting. You need to get calories somewhere, and a high-protein, healthy fat source is reasonable. Besides, without some fat, you'll end up hungrier again much sooner."

HealthyFood,2h13ff,dumpstergirl,2,Mon Sep 22 00:15:57 2014 UTC,"I make meat + veg bowls.  Some type of cooked meat which is served on a lightly dressed salad.  I just cooked for next week- it is Mediteranian themed.  Chicken shawarma meat on over roasted onion/pepper/tomato with tahini or tzatziki sauce.  Side of quinoa tabouli, cucumber salad, or crustless spanikopita.  Sometimes I like to put Fajita meat on a bag of slaw mix dressed with lime juice, pepper, and cumin.    You can also dress up slaw mix Thai style, with rice vinegar, ginger, peanut powder, et cetera. Then serve with chicken or shrimp cooked Thai style.   I am not as crazy about low carbs so sometimes my veg substrate has lots of legumes, quinoa, etc.  I like the fiber+protein combo of legumes so chilis, chick pea salads, black bean salsas, and the like are favorite picks.  They may not be consistent with your nutritional goals, however.  Texas-style chili is a good thing to cook ahead and freeze in lunch-sized portions to use as needed.  The trick to a good chili is using whole dried peppers which you toast and then reconstitute in boiling water.  (Throw out the soak water.)  That and a long simmer.  This seems like a lot of extra work, but I guarantee it is worth it.    Edit: This site may have some good inspiration for you.  I am not paleo myself, but I like a lot of the meal plans."

HealthyFood,2h13ff,empT3,1 point,Mon Sep 22 01:27:07 2014 UTC,"My go-to lately has been egg-drop soup. It's roughly the same amount of effort as ramen noodles.  1 can of beef broth, add in some kind of umami enhancer (I'll use marmite, soy sauce, beef bullion, mushroom stock or even a packet from a package of ramen noodles). Bring it to a boil and drizzle in some cornstarch slurry (you don't need much, just enough so that at a full boil the bubbles stack on top of eachother). Once it's thickened I'll slowly pour in a beaten egg and turn off the heat. Depending on how I'm doing with calories and nutrition that day I'll also typically add in some frozen veggies at this point which also helps it cool down enough for me to eat right away.  Depending on the veggies you add in at the end this can be anywhere from 120-175 calories for a bowl of soup that I tend to have trouble finishing (roughly 70 for the egg, 30 for the cornstarch (7g of carbs), and 14 for the beef broth plus whatever veggies you add in)."

Little is known about this healthy, ancient grain in the US but I have a feeling it will be on everyone's radar soon.   Dried apricots are great because they have a low GI, meaning they won't spike your blood sugar.  Dates are great too but they have a slightly higher GI.  That being said, the fiber in each of these fruits slows down the release of sugar into your bloodstream, making them a great afternoon sweet treat.

Usually in fruit there's fiber to make you feel fuller, so you eat and consume less sugar, but in juice you don't have any of that, so it's easy to over-indulge.   That being said, if you like it, why not drink it? Just be aware of the sugar content and treat it like a soft-drink, having it in moderation.

HealthyFood,2gcpti,chromiselda,3,Tue Sep 16 15:27:21 2014 UTC,"All good in moderation. The issue with juices is that they're easy to drink, so you end up over drinking them and the total sugar piles up. For instance it takes around 2-3 oranges to make a small glass of orange juice. Very easy to drink the orange juice, but not easy to eat 2-3 oranges in one sitting. Think about how much whole you can eat, and then take that in liquid."
HealthyFood,2gcpti,zpkmook,2,Sun Sep 14 09:05:15 2014 UTC,"Make a smoothie with whole fruits and veggies, forget juice."
HealthyFood,2gcpti,little_miss_kaea,2,Sun Sep 14 16:19:38 2014 UTC,"In my reading, I understand that juice from fruit is just as 'bad' as refined sugar, it's just that fruit also has fibre that changes the blood sugar response to that sugar.  Your juice is mostly the sugary bits pressed out of the fruit leaving the fibre behind.  Maybe look up glycemic indices for fruits and their juices to see the difference?"
HealthyFood,2gcpti,little_miss_kaea,1 point,Sun Sep 14 09:11:54 2014 UTC,"On the website though, it says the fiber is in the drink still. Its cold pressed and unfiltered."
HealthyFood,2gcpti,VengefulTikiGod,5,Sun Sep 14 09:36:09 2014 UTC,"It's still going to be a big decrease from the actual fruit.  If you want to drink it, do so!  It's probably got some vitamins in, and it will work well as an energy drink because of all the sugar, if you are doing sport.  But it's sugary."
HealthyFood,2gcpti,_meiki,1 point,Sun Sep 14 10:40:43 2014 UTC,"Think of it this way, if you're drinking orange juice for example, think how many oranges it takes to make a class. I'd guess maybe 4? If you ate 4 oranges, you'd be pretty darn full, but when you juice something, most of the fiber is removed, so it's very easy to drink a lot of calories without feeling full. So personally, I do a banana berry smoothie like this: Half or two thirds cup frozen berries, a banana, just a quarter cup OJ, top the rest off with almond milk. Another think I'll do is dilute my juice by half with water. Put the water in the cup first. Tastes better for some reason."
HealthyFood,2gcpti,_meiki,0,Sun Sep 14 20:57:39 2014 UTC,You shouldn't worry about the sugars naturally insude fruits. Every cell in your body is powered by fructose! I couldn't tell if your loved juice is 100% JUICE but chances are if it doesn't say then they've indeed added a scoop of processed sugar for flavour. How about getting into drinking fruit smoothies? Naturally sweet and undeniably healthy.

HealthyFood,2gat32,zpkmook,3,Tue Sep 16 12:41:32 2014 UTC,Well the first step you can take is to halve or quarter the banana or get rid of it entirely. Also you reduce the lactaid or switch to unsweetened almond milk. Why? NO sugar and milk blocks berry phytonutrients.
HealthyFood,2gat32,zpkmook,1 point,Sat Sep 13 18:06:19 2014 UTC,"Yeah I think I'll get rid of the banana, though it's a shame to lose the potassium. I'll take a look at almond milk, thanks!  Edit: question, so mixing almond milk and berries would not block the absorption of phytonutrients?  Edit 2: another question, is naturally-occuring sugar bad?"
HealthyFood,2gat32,drunkenknitter,2,Sat Sep 13 18:41:59 2014 UTC,"I've added boiled sweet potatoes before, more substantial potassium and less sweet than a banana. However a banana sweet potato smoothie is also amazing but tons o' sugar."
HealthyFood,2gat32,looking_for_a_purpos,2,Sat Sep 13 19:04:34 2014 UTC,"Yeah bananas don't actually have that much potassium per serving or per calorie wise. Most people use the banana for the taste and the texture (those that know the nutrition). Greens like beet greens, swiss chard, kale, spinach etc have more potassium per serving but can be a pain to blend unless you have a vitamix/blendtec. Also avocados and sweet potatoes have a lot of potassium.  Naturally occuring sugar is not as bad as added because of the whole food package- phytonutrients and fiber etc. The studies on berry phytos show milk and soy milks block berry phytonutrients. No data on other nut milks."

HealthyFood,2g7uad,gidash,9,Fri Sep 12 17:28:17 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Parents whine all of the time that they cannot stand how picky their children are ""they just are."" It sounds cruel, but note that you are the parent and you have the control. If you let a kid hate a food, they will hate the food. So the rule in our house is you are allowed 1 hate. Once you choose your hated item, you have to stick to it, there is no changing it. This has worked very well for us. No tears at the dinner table and no complaints; everyone is happy.   We also taught our kids to appreciate that they have food at all. To say there are other kids starving in the world who are literally dying not having what you have is a cliché, but it IS true, and we use this phrase appropriately so they understand the power of that statement. Saying this is not an opportunity to rub negatives in their face, but a legit moment to say ""let's keep things in perspective."" The kids really do get that they won the birth lottery, even at an early age they understood this.   Lastly, I take them grocery shopping. It sucks and it's a test of patience for all of us in different ways, but I see it as a necessary life skill to help the kids appreciate that dinner isn't a magical thing that suddenly appears each night. We have two rules: 1.) go find an exotic food item we haven't tried yet. We don't have to like it, but we have to at least give it a shot! We make this a fun experience. More often than not the explored food item becomes a regular staple in our meal planning because we took the challenge together.   2.) each kid has to go get a suitable food item of their choice to put in the local food hamper bin when we leave the store. Again, this is a fun moment, not a chore, and it serves as a reminder that not all people can afford to eat what we are fortunate enough to have. As soon as we started donating food, the appreciation from the kids really solidified itself. We can't afford too much extra, things are tight budget-wise, but we can afford to donate something. I hope other parents make this effort with their kids, too."

OP, I would suggest also taking a look at the rest of your diet and see if you're lacking anything, then see how you might add that to your smoothies."
HealthyFood,2fxmbi,idebs,2,Wed Sep 10 01:48:37 2014 UTC,"If you're looking to lose weight, I'd say add more veggies. I always make a generally delicious smoothie each morning that consists of: 1 small cucumber, 1 celery stalk, handful of spinach, 1 banana, 1 apple, chia seeds, hemp hearts, and flax seeds. Sometimes I add cold green tea instead of water.  Obviously you can mix and match to your own tastes but I find this is always a good basis for a good tasting/feeling smoothie."
HealthyFood,2fxmbi,laughing_cat,2,Wed Sep 10 00:27:29 2014 UTC,"Your smoothie sounds good but, it does have lots of sugar from the fruit. Maybe just choose one type of fruit and try adding some greens instead?  Typically my smoothie ingredients:  walnuts, hemp seeds, dates, cinnamon, kale, spinach or other green leaf, flax milk and maybe some ice cubes.  Often I might add: ginger, cucumber, blueberries, and/or protein powder."
HealthyFood,2fxmbi,laughing_cat,1 point,Wed Sep 10 04:32:31 2014 UTC,Fresh ginger in smoothies is awesome. Its like adding salt to food. It just makes the flavour of everything else pop.
HealthyFood,2fxmbi,Rammydc,3,Fri Sep 12 12:23:06 2014 UTC,"Well, if you want a critique, I'd say more berries, less banana. Strawberries are not a berry with the highest concentration of nutrients, compared to say, blueberries. Cow's milk is an inflammatory food. Have you considered almond milk? I assume you're using organic cow's milk without hormones. I don't know that peanuts are the healthiest ""nut"". You might consider using raw almond butter. You can also add a bit of powdered mangosteen or acai to improve the healthfulness."

HealthyFood,2fvik6,Apk07,5,Tue Sep 9 03:39:50 2014 UTC,"It's so easy to make your own granola bars, just mix up and toast 3 cups of oats, nuts, add dried fruit or choc chips.  Heat about half a cup of honey mix together, (I add a bit of brown sugar) place in a greased pan, press down really hard and refrigerate for 2 hours.  When the honey gets cold it is the glue that sticks it all together.  Cut into bars.  Try different things, flax, other seeds, etc.  Best not skip lunch.  Eat homemade applesauce, or even soup broth.  You'll lose weight in a week and have energy. Cheers!"
HealthyFood,2fvik6,honeyhogan,2,Tue Sep 9 04:17:24 2014 UTC,"The reason why skipping meals is bad is because people often tend to wait until they are absolutely starving to eat and then binge and overeat to compensate. It's not inherently bad to skip lunch. That being said, there's lots of healthy snacks you can have.   Consider individual portion hummus containers with baby carrots, other veggies, or a whole grain cracker like Mary's gone crackers. A piece of fruit or some berries and nuts. A half an avocado (on whole grain toast or just eaten with a spoon) with a squirt of sriracha. A yogurt. Popcorn (depending on the type - plain lightly salted popcorn only has like 30 calories per cup, so you can eat a satisfying amount and not feel guilty.

HealthyFood,2ft8sz,esoper1976,3,Mon Sep 8 16:42:02 2014 UTC,"Probably the best drink out there is plain old water.  I also drink herbal iced teas, when I want a little flavor in my water.  Another way to flavor water is to cut up some of your favorite fruits and/or veggies, and let them sit in a pitcher of water in the fridge for a while.  Then, strain them out and just drink the water.  The fruits and veggies will give the water a nice flavor without adding calories etc.  But, really, I don't drink anything with calories much.  I do have milk on cereal, and an occasional glass here or there.  I stay away from all juices, because other than some vitamins, they are really just sugar water.  Even if they are 100% juice.  If you MUST have juice, make your own.  But, really it's better to eat the fruit or vegetable instead--then not only do you get the vitamins and minerals, you also get the fiber and other goodness."

I mix a level teaspoon in with cold water. You have to shake it or use a wire whip, but otherwise, it's as easy as making instant tea. It's a bright green powder.   2) Something I have up to twice a day and is sort of a smoothie, but delicious and extremely healthy and needs no added sweetener. It has about a fifth of the carbs of orange juice and all the fiber. 1 cup frozen blueberries, 1/3 cup frozen raspberries, 4 frozen sweet cherries and add about 12 oz cold water and put in blender. I use the single serving size Ninja blender. It makes about 16 oz and is about 100 calories.  3) I don't drink regular milk any more, but the unsweetened Almond Breeze 30 cal vanilla almond milk is good. (Brand matters - to me the Silk brand is awful). If I drink it before bed time, sometimes I add 1 tablespoon cream from grass fed cows (50 calories).  You can also blend cocoa into it and , to me, that's sweet enough. But for a treat, I might add a teaspoon xylitol."

I have acquired a surprising taste for purple cabbage and beet juice, and I like to juice a ginger root and add the juice to ginger tea. It's a good way to get consistent wholesome nutrition fast, and it can be easily frozen in ice cube trays for later additions to smoothies or water or soups.  Plus, you can save the pulp from your juicer and do so much stuff with it. For me, what doesn't get baked into muffins (apple, carrot, and ginger combo is especially nice), boiled in a cheese cloth for stock, frozen for later use, or turned into fruit leather gets composted for the garden."

HealthyFood,2fjm7j,rainywalker,2,Fri Sep 5 12:24:56 2014 UTC,"Three Reasons Why You Need To Start Eating Brown Rice Today  If you could make one small adjustment to your daily diet that would improve your health, would you do it? The majority of us eat white rice with our meals, because we think it's healthy. The cold hard truth is we could be doing better. By just taking the small step and switching to brown rice you are going to be doing your body a great big favor.  We don't want to overwhelm you with the massive power that brown rice has on your life, so let's take some small baby steps. Here are three reasons to invite brown rice into your kitchen and your life.  The Common Cure For ""Everything""  We are all taking our health much more seriously and are beginning to live longer and healthier lives. If you are looking for a way to boost that, brown riche has what you are looking for. Brown rice is rich in selenium, which has been shown to prevent many common illnesses. One serving of brown rice gives you almost 40% of the daily value on a 2,000 calorie a day diet. So if you are looking to prevent types of cancer, arthritis, infertility and even dandruff brown rice is a natural choice.  Move Over Jenny Craig  Obesity is on of the biggest health concerns we are facing in the world. While it is a huge concern people struggle with trying to lose pounds everyday. Some of us do it for health, while others just want to look good. We are shown diet plans, pills and exercises everyday,but trying to find the most effective way to lose weight can be confusing. If you happen to have some brown rice in your kitchen you can start a very natural diet plan. The amount of fiber in brown rice helps bowel functions, in turn making digestion easier. Considering the fact that brown rice is going to fill you up quicker,you will be choosing smaller portions at the dinner table.  Oh Baby!  While we want to make sure we are taking care of ourselves, our children need to be our top priority. And if you are looking for the perfect baby food, brown rice should be your first choice. It is perfect due to the dense natural nutrition as well as fiber. Feeding your baby a brown rice cereal as opposed to the refined white rice will give your baby or toddler the nutrients they need during those rapid growth spurts. There is no reason for you to not start eating brown rice. It is obviously more nutritious, healthier and with the right recipes it can be tastier. So get past the look of this natural wonder and start adding brown rice to your daily diet."

HealthyFood,2fbkuk,michaelconfoy,3,Wed Sep 3 02:44:05 2014 UTC,"Lots of talk about why HFCS isn't bad, but in the context of beer it doesn't really matter. Pretty much all the corn sugar added to a beer will be consumed by the yeast, and you will consume the alcohol produced by the yeast. Yeast will produce the same alcohol regardless of the type of sugar it is given.  Yeast have an easier time metabolizing simpler sugars, and corn sugar (dextrose) is quite simple. More complex sugars are what remain after fermentation and are what result in some beers being sweeter or more full-bodied than others."

Try the sweeter red maradol variety at first) Melon   Slowly wean yourself off of your junk foods you can try healthier stuff I.e. Multigrain chips,but when eating the fibrous stuff I mentioned all day,your cravings sugary and greasy food will start to decrease in a surprisingly short period of time anyways.

It's just that it's the most frequently skipped meal, and skipping meals in general is bad because it increases your chances of bingeing later. If you have low willpower when very hungry (or even just kind of hungry) then multiple small meals a day can be beneficial.   I recall reading a study that said that people who skipped meals tended to consume more calories when they did finally eat than they would have if they had split that meal into two."

As your friends suggested, a food log is a classic way to try and figure this sort of thing out. After you've done that for a while and have some ideas about what might be problem foods, you can use another standard tool for GI trouble. Elimination diets can help confirm or disprove suspicions about given foods, although you'll probably want to consult a doc and/or dietitian/nutritionist before starting one.   Something to consider - you didn't mention what your eating disorder was, or how long it's been since you got it under control.

HealthyFood,2ektb6,Fishercat,6,Mon Aug 25 23:44:15 2014 UTC,"The healthiest options are going to be the ones that are the least processed and have the fewest ingredients. If you're shopping in a U.S. supermarket, most of those items are usually located on the outer aisles of the store. (Produce, raw meat, fish, etc.)   Exceptions to the location rule are frozen fruits & veg (with no other ingredients), and dried or canned legumes. Legumes (particularly chick peas) are an excellent source of cholesterol-free protein, and fiber.   If you don't already, learn to love hummus and other bean dips. You can buy them pre-made, or make your own, which is quite easy with a food processor or stick blender. They're delicious, and, especially if what you're dipping is raw veggies, an extremely healthy quick food.  If you like eggs, buy naturally-raised ones -- they have lower cholesterol and healthier lipid profiles than agribusiness eggs. Look for logos that mention Omega 3 or 6 fatty acids.  [*Edited to add:] Making healthier supermarket choices can be a lot easier if you rethink your goal: go shopping for ingredients, not meals."
HealthyFood,2ektb6,notGeorgeKennan,2,Tue Aug 26 02:35:46 2014 UTC,"I second this.  Buying healthy food is easy if you know what to look for.  As Fishercat suggested, I make my hummus and eat it with carrots or celery.  It's surprisingly easy to get used to and much healthier than what I had been eating before!  Some tips on bread: when buying, don't always buy into the whole grain/whole wheat deal.  Truly whole grain, healthy bread contains at least 8g of fiber per serving.  Other breads aren't going to get you the same amount of nutrition (good carbs) for the calories.  Meats: I'm a steak person.  Buying and making steaks is so much fun, easy, and quick.  I look for grass-fed cuts, or meats that mention vegetarian diet-fed cows.  At home, I use a broiler pan to cook the steak so that all of the fat/greasy bits drain off.  Takes about 12 minutes.  So, slightly longer than a microwave do, but not much.  I usually pair this with asparagus, potatoes, or brussels sprouts, all of which can be boiled in a pan on a stovetop, in about an inch of water, no oils/butter necessary!  Salads are another great way to go.  Kale is actually wonderful, and I enjoy doing stuff with it.  It's obviously fast, keeps well, and there are tons of dressings you can substitute for your typical ranch dressing if you have special dietary concerns."

I do know to look for 100% whole wheat (or other grain[s]). If it just says ""whole wheat bread,"" all that means is that there's some whole wheat flour in it. You want the stuff that doesn't have any white flour, which will say ""100% whole [whatever]."""

Avoid cereals, breads, noodles, sugary drinks or foods with sugar like cakes and what not.  Now you can't avoid all carbohydrates because fruits and veggies are vital to healthy living.  You can use a food processor to give cauliflower a quick grind to mimic rice, this can be streamed or lightly fried.  Try using a program called myfitnesspal, it's a calorie counting app and it's a life saver.   You can keep a track on carbohydrates and lower your intake gradually.  My breakfast is usually a piece of bacon or salmon slice, half an avocado, and an egg and I've lost a lot of weight in the past 4 months.

With my father I have restricted bread (except for 1 piece of toast a day because he loves toast) and we no longer eat rice of any form, or quinoa etc.. and cereal.  there are better things to eat for breakfast, but if you want to satisfy that craving, rolled oats are perfect.  Almonds, Avocado, chicken, turkey should be staples in your diet..   http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com u used this website for one reason, it told me the protein level I must reach a day in order to not starve my muscles.   My staples for vegetables are mushrooms, peas, corn, spinach  If you are used to microwaving everything then salads are probably your answer as they require little cooking skill.  Bag of spinach leaves, baby tomatoes, feta cheese, pine nuts (or almonds), capsicum (bell peppers), Avocado, corn kernals.. Now you can fry up some chicken or buy a store bought cooked chicken, or side... Discarded the skin, and fry up some mushrooms.  Involves cooking 1 or 2 things in 1 pan.

HealthyFood,2eh90h,MistahClean,5,Sun Aug 24 22:33:32 2014 UTC,"Really depends on what you like. Lots of fish, chicken, & turkey are good meat staples. You can season them with various herbs and spices. Then, eat lots and lots of fruits & veggies. For me, for work i usually take various types of sandwiches (turkey, tuna, egg salad on whole grain bread), homemade soups, quinoa, salads, etc. Just figure out the healthy foods you like and combine them to make something great. The main thing here is making sure you aren't buying shitty food to eat. If you only buy healthy food and don't go out for lunch, you will find it much easier to reach your goals.  Yes, of course you can snack, you just have to snack on healthy foods portioned correctly. I love eating Emerald nuts (lots of flavors in case you don't like plain nuts), celery or an apple with peanut butter, guacamole/salsa and tortilla chips. The main thing with these is PORTION CONTROL. i recommend using small containers or snack baggies to measure out snacks for the day, so you can't overeat. I've occasionally fasted. I gain and lose weight really quickly, so it helped temporarily, but overall just worry about caloric restriction and not fasting. I'd argue a good deficit is ~500 calories a day for weight loss."
HealthyFood,2eh90h,blonderson,3,Sun Aug 24 23:08:58 2014 UTC,"I am in a similar boat. I don't follow a diet, because its not sustainable but this is some guidelines to what I do.    I bought a small sack that fits in my purse. I love to munch on food during the day, so I found some healthier foods ( cracker and peanut butter, PB&J, Turkey sandwiches on wheat, applesauce)  that I really like and I make like 10 servings on Sunday. During the week I stick in my sack before I leave the house. I make sure to keep a good supply of sweet snacks and salty snacks this way it curbs whatever I am craving. I eat a large breakfast. Its a good source of nutrition and it helps me to stay fuller during the day so that I don't overeat. If I get hungry and crave something, I get what I crave but I either will order a small salad or fruit with it and eat it first or I order two large glasses of water and drink it. Once I am done I eat to my hearts content but I wont have room to overindulge to much.  If I have to go out to eat and its planned. I eat something healthy like a bowl of cereal or a cup of pudding before I leave home. This way when I get to the restaurant, I am not STARVING and end up stuffing my face.  Finally, I buy lots of healthy food and stock up on it. Then I fast for one whole day. By the following day I am truly hungry and I am more likely to accept the healthy food then if I had spent the last 24 hours gorging on McDonalds.  I eat frequent small portions. I try to eat smaller and smaller portions to get my body and stomach used to processing less . Eventually you will crave and tolerate much less.  When I was pregnant, I would drink 4 ounces of water every hour on the hour. It curbs overeating."

Cook foods in big batches that you can freeze and reheat quickly (it's as easy to make 2 servings of Turkey chili as it is to make 10). It's perfectly acceptable to snack provided you're making good nutritional choices. Veggies, fruit, nuts, protein shakes, hard boiled eggs, low sugar yogurt, tuna etc. I don't advise that. Food=Fuel. Studying on an empty stomach personally leaves me unable to focus, retain, and generally miserable."
HealthyFood,2eh90h,ShamelessFox,2,Mon Aug 25 22:43:57 2014 UTC,"I do intermittent fasting. Pretty much just skip breakfast everyday. It's not hard for me at all. Eat lots of protein/veggies/fats in the AM and slightly more carbs in the evening or after a workout when your body can handle it better. For snacks I stick to nuts, veggies, and maybe a protein shake. Dark chocolate once in a while and in moderation too is good for you. Hope this helps!"

HealthyFood,2eccoo,racingturtle,5,Sat Aug 23 04:47:06 2014 UTC,"Protein gives you slowly used energy, while sugar gives you fast energy and then a crash.  So in eating a lot of sugar you're kind of rollercoasting your body.  You have energy and then you have none, back and forth.  One solution is, you can eat lean meat for instance, or pretty much any type of nut for protein to keep that energy going throughout the day.  A lot of cereals nowadays provide protein as well.    Really there's a ton of types of protein out there if you want to get creative.  The key is to find things that give you energy that your body absorbs slowly, because when your body absorbs sugar too fast and you don't use it, it stores it in fat."

Along with the proteins that fill you up and give your body slow burning fuel, fruits and veggies provide vitamins that help your body function smoothly and sharply. Take it easy on fruits though, because even though the sugars inside are natural, they can still turn into trouble if you load down big time.  Best part about fruits and veggies is that you can just grab em and go."

HealthyFood,2dxi62,slightlyhottertuna,4,Mon Aug 18 23:08:52 2014 UTC,"I'm going to say the thing that needs to be said first. I'm not a doctor. The best thing you can do is go see a doctor and probably a therapist. This is an anxiety issue.  That being said. I choked and almost died two years ago. My boyfriend had to give me the Heimlich Maneuver to save my life. After that, my brain was like ""nope, no food for you"", and for the next six months I had to retrain myself to eat solid foods because I was constantly afraid that I would choke again.  This isn't the same as what you're going through, but they're both anxiety issues.   I guarantee that if you're not eating a lot, that you're not getting enough vitamins. So let's start with that. Make your own smoothies. Get some spinach, kale, shredded carrot, etc and chuck it in a blender. Then add some fruit for flavor and carbs. Bananas are great for flavor. Strawberries too. Add a liquid. For you, you'll want to go higher calorie. So whole milk or orange juice.  Try that for a while. And work your way up slowly. My next favorite foods were mashed potatoes and gravy and refried beans with shredded cheese and hot sauce.  They're dense and high in calories, which for you is good right now. But they're also soft and easy to eat.  As time went on I really liked Campbell's chicken noodle soup. Also pudding!  And I slowly moved up to bread, and from bread to whole sandwiches, and once you get going, the momentum takes you into new foods you wouldn't have thought to try before.  It's a long and frustrating road when you have no appetite. But you need the calories and you need the vitamins.  I encourage you to speak to your therapist about this more, because anxiety never really goes away. I know mine doesn't. I just have days that are more manageable.   Good luck! :)"

So this is general advice for changing your diet, but absolutely, you should still talk to a doctor. I'm giving advice from pretty much the opposite end (emotional binge eating), but I think it should still work.   Keep an open mind. Remember that other people may like something, but your palate is unique to you. Start with small variations and grow more adventurous as you gain more success. Expect setbacks, but don't be conquered by them. There are going to be some days that you just can't get it to work. This happens, but it's what you do afterwards that shapes your progress."

I understand the point being made in the article, but if someone is only willing to do Paleo or some other healthy initiative with the contingency that they can get away with some ""bad"" foods once in a while, then they should go for it.  So many people just end up saying ""fuck it"" and eat like crap all the time, but eating paleo 6 days a week, or 5 days a week, or 4 days a week, is still 4, 5, or 6 days a week healthier than not doing it at all."

HealthyFood,2dumla,randoh12,2,Mon Aug 18 02:30:21 2014 UTC,"INGREDIENTS   1.5 cups rolled oats (GF for gluten free eaters) 1 cup raw nuts, roughly chopped ( I used 1/2 cup almonds, 1/2 cup pecans) 1 cup raw walnuts 2 cups pitted dates, soaked for 10 minutes in warm water, then drained 3/4 cup cocoa or cacao powder 1/4 cup natural salted almond butter (or peanut butter) 1/4 cup agave nectar, maple syrup, or honey if not vegan   PREPARATION  Optional step: Toast your oats and pecans in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes or until slightly golden brown. Otherwise, leave them raw – I prefer the toasted flavor.   Process walnuts in a food processor until a loose meal is reached. Remove from bowl and set aside. Add dates and process until small bits remain (about 1 minute). It should form a “dough” like consistency. (Mine rolled into a ball.) Add walnut meal and cocoa or cacao powder back in with the dates and process to combine. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and add the (toasted) oats and nuts and stir to combine. You may have to use your hands to really incorporate the mixture well. Next, warm honey and almond butter in a small skillet over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until combined and pourable.  Pour over brownie mixture and then thoroughly using a wooden spoon. (I opted to put plastic bags on my hands and mix that way to better incorporate the mixture.) Once thoroughly mixed, transfer to a 9×13 dish (or similar size pan) lined with plastic wrap or parchment paper so they lift out easily. If using a 9×13, ONLY USE 3/4 of the pan so they have the proper thickness. Otherwise they’ll be too thin. Cover with parchment or plastic wrap and press down firmly to even out the top. Freeze for 15-20 minutes to harden. Lift bars from pan and chop into 12 even bars (or more if you prefer). Store in an airtight container in the freezer or fridge to keep them extra fresh.

I'm trying to go for varied intake of foods so I don't focus on meats too much, but like I said, I am focusing on protein.

HealthyFood,2dtfln,4th9th10th,1 point,Mon Aug 18 14:43:35 2014 UTC,"I did very similar last year and have lost ~40 pounds. It helped me to eat small meals and healthy snacks (few nuts, raisins, fruit) in between.  A big part of my regimen is walk - walk - walk. I have a desk job so walk before work, take walk breaks while at work, use any excuse to walk more. Now that I am much healthier, I've started to jog and do calesthetics.  All that said, since you don't have much, time do what little you can. Why I chose walking is that all you need is feet and earth. My diet is semi-paleo. Minimal processed foods of any kind. I think that was the best part of my lifestyle change. I do have a few glasses of wine most nights. Because of the other changes, the weight still came off and stays off.  Change is gradual, you'll need patience. I also have cheat meals about 3 times per week. Here's a way to enjoy some of the bad stuff. I make pizza every Friday. But the crust is a whole grain (large) soft taco shell, with a little real moz cheese, light sauce  and healthy toppings like spinach, pineapple, and olives. It's damn good. Search on-line for healthy versions of what you like. There's tons of good stuff out there. This may help you be more successful. Also, skip the fiber bars and go for the natural stuff.  Want beef? Just by eating grass fed (or bison instead).  You'll amp up the Omega's while eating fewer calories and less saturated fat. BTW - male in mid-50's (sigh) and now in the middle of my biometric range of 140-155 lbs and looking to drop about 5 more, then maintain. I feel better than I have in years with more energy, no glycemc crashes after lunch, and seem to think more clearly. Congratulations on your efforts and please think long term. I believe processed foods, portion size, and our addiction to grain based carbs is a big part of our national obesity epidemic. Try not to think about it as a diet, but as lifestyle modification. When you get to the weight you desire, you'll need to maintain. If you revert to old food or habits, the prophecy is self-fulfilling with ballooning that plagues most ""dieters.""

Though, fruit might not be the answer you're looking for if you are trying to find a health snack to replace non-healthy snacks since fruit won't have the same sort of flavor profile.  Since cleaning up my diet, the holy grail for me has been a crispy-salty snack to replace my beloved potato chips.  I've found some foods that help satisfy that craving, but mostly after 6 months of only eating fresh foods and no junk, the cravings for the junk have gone away.  On the way to getting to this point I ate a lot of pickles and olives, things with a lot of flavor tend to provide more satisfaction, but they didn't have the crunch.   My favorite semi-healthy salty snack now is flavored-roasted almond.  Almonds are a good source of fiber, protein, and good fats.  Almonds are high in calories though (the good fat).  56 almonds would be about 340 calories, right in your range.  Blue Diamond has some pretty good flavors.  I'm not really sure if that is what you were looking for, but that's what I got.  for sweetness I go with fruit.

HealthyFood,2cxcyk,goosfraba_,2,Fri Aug 8 02:30:24 2014 UTC,"In terms of snacks, nuts are your best friend.  Nuts are both a great source of protein and more importantly are immensely filling.    The problem with potatoes, for example, is that they contain a lot of carbs that cause your insulin levels to spike.  This in turn causes you to feel hungry again faster, foods with a low glycemic index keep you feeling full longer.  ""The glycemic index (GI) is a ranking of carbohydrates on a scale from 0 to 100 according to the extent to which they raise blood sugar levels after eating. Foods with a high GI are those which are rapidly digested and absorbed and result in marked fluctuations in blood sugar levels. Low-GI foods, by virtue of their slow digestion and absorption, produce gradual rises in blood sugar and insulin levels, and have proven benefits for health. ""  Here is a graph from the University of Sydney showing how the GI affects blood sugar.  If you're concerned about finding foods that keep you feeling full, I definitely recommend doing some research on good snacks with a low GI.  Source"

One of the toughest things for me was getting past ""getting bored of food"". Once you break through that wall and can eat the same thing every day for a couple days on a row, your time spent on cooking per week will be cut dramatically.   Also, don't feel like you have to adhere rigidly to any one diet, but I find elements from paleo and keto to be very helpful.  I usually eat stir fried veggies and brown rice most nights, some times with chicken, never any store bought sugared out sauces. Yes I know rice is a grain, but still.   Also, I would advise in my totally non professional but very healthy opinion to CUT OUT DAIRY. Drink soy milk if you like milk. Skip cheese. Eat plain yogurt with your oatmeal if you really need a dairy fix. You can do it, and this community will always be here for support!

HealthyFood,2cxcyk,clarecatherine,2,Fri Aug 8 02:33:31 2014 UTC,"Be careful on diets like paleo and keto. Those can be very restrictive diets, and it's not uncommon for someone who jumps into such a restricted diet to then find themselves binge eating on the many foods they have cut out. I'd suggest making some manageable changes to begin with, and then if some time down the road you want to try a diet like that you'll be better prepared.   For now, set yourself up for success and forget about all the fad diets. Michael Pollan is famous for his food knowledge and philosophy, and he puts it very simply - “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” It's really that simple. Lots of fruits and vegetables. Try to avoid much red meat. Don't be afraid to try new grains - quinoa, rice, millet, spelt, etc. There's also a ton you can do with beans and lentils. And most importantly, don't consume more calories than you burn each day.  As was also mentioned by someone else - work on cutting out sugar. I live a very healthy lifestyle, but I still enjoy some sugary treats now and then."

It's definitely still a worthwhile oil to have, but used only for low temp/cold applications.  My perspective on oils is that everything is OK in moderation. I have coconut oil, walnut oil, almond oil, canola, butter... Heck, I have a jar of bacon grease in my fridge, and recently used it to saute some cabbage. But I do those sorts of things very rarely.

I train 15 hours/week in a high intensity sport.  When I'm cutting, I usually do so by lowering my carb intake, as most athletes do.  My entire post was clearly speaking from experience as an athlete, and I refer to ""the fitness community"", as well as make it clear I am talking about my own bulks and cuts.  To cut out protein would be... misguided.  There is nothing wrong with a 40/30/30 split, which is far from ""no carbs"".  Your response is little more than hyperbole."

My guess is that if you were to buy ""sun-dried"" tomatoes in a grocery store, they are most likely commercially dehydrated, without the use of the sun. Anyway, I dehydrate tomatoes in a home-dehydrator and use them just as you would ""sun-dried"" tomatoes. The point is to remove water, which concentrates the sugars."

If you're trying to eat better, why not include vegetables? All this reminds me of is the woman who only ate cheesy potatoes and cried because she had to eat a piece of broccoli. Your wife is an adult, she needs to suck it up and eat right.  What about vegetables does she not like? You say 'doesn't' so I assume she's able to, she just chooses not to. Is there a texture she doesn't like? There's also a huge variety of vegetables - tomatoes, yams, spinach, for example, are not the same taste or texture at all. Does she eat fruit? Then maybe get her to start off with tomatoes. Does she like smoothies? Mix a little spinach or kale in there. If she absolutely refuses, make sure she's at least eating fruit."

Maybe try preparing them in different ways? I make a marinade of olive oil, lemon juice, dijon mustard, garlic, salt and pepper and marinate assorted vegetables on that before grilling them.   If she's not ready for that though, one of the best things you can do is cut out processed foods. You can almost ignore the fat and calories in foods you're eating. Look at the ingredients, that is what is most important to me. If it has ingredients you can't pronounce, no good. If the list of ingredients is a mile long, no good.   Start small and then start introducing new things. When you start eating healthy, whole foods you almost ""reset"" your tastebuds.

HealthyFood,2clon6,gummar,2,Wed Aug 6 02:18:16 2014 UTC,"Cooking can be intimidating at first, but honestly if you can read you can cook. Once you get comfortable you can start experimenting and will be amazed at what you come up with. Here are two recipes I made this week:  Quick Stovetop Cassoulet   1/2 lb andoullie sausage 2 (16oz) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed 1 (28oz) can diced tomatoes 1 cup chopped onion 1 cup thinly sliced carrots 2 cloves garlic, minced 1 tbsp olive oil 1 cup low sodium vegetable broth 1 teaspoon dried thyme salt and pepper to taste 1 cup dry bread crumbs (optional)   Heat olive oil in large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add sausage and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Remove sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside. Put the same skillet back on the heat and saute onions, carrots, and garlic until softened. Add a little salt and pepper while sauteing (maybe 3 or 4 ""shakes"" from your shakers).   Cut sausage into 1 inch pieces and return to pan.   Stir in the beans, tomatoes, broth, and thyme. If desired add a little more salt and pepper. Cover and cook until vegetables are tender (on low heat, stir every few minutes) for about 20 minutes.   While the cassoulet is cooking, toast bread crumbs in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring often to toast evenly. Be careful not to burn, and set them aside. When the cassoulet is ready to serve, top with bread crumbs (this is optional, and I often go without)  Turkey and Quinoa Stuffed Peppers  This one I'm gonna be a little lazy and link you to the recipe I based mine off of. I often do without the cheese, but it's still pretty healthy even with it. Recipe here. If you're not into quinoa you can sub rice (brown preferably, but even white would be okay)  Edit: Forgot step in recipe Edit 2: Suggestions"

Be careful, though, since fats are so calorie-rich. There are also strategies out there to get used to eating cleaner, where you start slowly incorporating more natural foods - like vegetables - into your diet!

HealthyFood,2clon6,Senior_Destripador,1 point,Mon Aug 4 18:14:06 2014 UTC,"Sounds like you two need to spice things up a bit....  If you're not used to them, vegetables can be difficult to adjust to especially if you're used to eating the addicting kinds of sugary and fatty foods out there. That said, even if you do you enjoy veggies,  many would agree it can get boring to eat raw veggies all the time. It's a good idea to learn to use oil and spices to dress em up a bit. Something as simple as an all purpose meat rub and a little slippery coconut or olive oil can season a frozen bag of stir fry veggies in as little as 7 minutes. If she is into sweets then you can add a lil sugar to the recipe (many meat rubs will already have it) to make it more palatable for her. You will want to wane off the amount of sugar you add over time, however, as sugar can be a culprit in weight gain, diabeetus, and other undesirable effects.   Nuts. Run to your farmers market and come home with a big bag of these nuts..  They are satiating and require no cooking! You can even have fun with your nuts adding your meat rub.  Garlic salt + avacodo = a quick serving of simple guacamole. You can always add more flavors like vinegar, cilantro, lime, pepper, onion, tomato, hot pepper... If you want to get really healthy with it, you can replace chips with celery sticks. Its quite refreshing.  The Nutribullet can be your friend. It comes with a book of recipients to suit your taste\need. Some argue against making smoothies because it destroys the absorption rate of the food. I would say it is debatable, however. If you replaced the sodas and juices with smoothies made from all real fruit and no added sugar, your health will improve. You can mix vegetables into the smoothie as well.   Ezekiel bread. It's still bread, but it is one of the convenient better choices. Oats and quinoa are some things you can try. These are whole grains. Quinoa is high in fiber and nutrients. There are ways to make this pretty delicious, but I would consider this type of cooking to be next level. Quinoa can be used to make fun stuff like muffins and cookies which would be more nutritious than standard flour.  When you shop for food, look at the ingredients. Avoid food with hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oil of any kind. This is a trans fat. They are bad for you.   If you see sugar in the ingredients, try avoid that.  I know I am kind of contradicting myself by recommending it in cooking, but that is to bait and switch your wife into eating more veggies and less processed food. Sugar has many names in the ingredients list on food products. If it ends in ""-ose"", it is a sugar; for example: dextrose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, maltose, etc. Corn syrup, honey and molasses are also sugars to name a few others. As you begin to read the ingredients on all the foods you buy, you will become disappointed with America. Some added sugar here and there is fun and makes food good to eat. However, much of the food available to consume in the states has sugar added. More information on sugar. It's good shit, but you gotta be careful.   But yeah, shes gonna have to learn to eat veggies."

But I'll give it a try.  Pantry stuff  Grains: Stick with with whole grains. The inexpensive ones where I live are oats, brown rice, corn meal, and whole wheat flour. Whole-grain pasta, if you can find it.  Legumes: Versatile, inexpensive protein. Dried are always cheaper than canned, but most dried ones require presoaking. Split peas and lentils don't; they'll cook in about 30-45 minutes at a simmer, depending on how soft you like them.  Snacks: Nuts are great; some are nutritional powerhouses. Raw and unsalted is the healthiest option. Dried fruit. Buy whichever ones you like. Canned or jarred olives.  Refrigerator stuff   Non-meat proteins: Eggs, yogurt or Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, milk, whatever hard cheeses you like.   Meat: Large portions of meat are substantially cheaper per kilo/lb than small ones. Check the sales at your local markets. Every few weeks, buy whatever large chunk of animal protein is on sale. Cook it, then hack up the leftovers into one or two-meal portions, and freeze those. You'll get way more for your money that way.  Veg: If you're cooking, staple veggies should be onions, carrots, and celery. They're flavorful, inexpensive, and are great in combination. Don't neglect leafy greens. You can make a big salad that will last several days if you line the  container you store it in with a damp paper towel or dish towel. You can also fill a container with crudite or hand salad: crunchy veg cut into strips or sticks that you can grab and eat out of hand.  Fruit: Whatever you like that's on sale.  Last bit of advice: Get a slow cooker. You can throw a bunch of ingredients into it in the morning before you leave and have a hot meal waiting for you when you get home. They're invaluable."

HealthyFood,2b82kc,Spaztic_monkey,2,Sun Jul 20 18:42:28 2014 UTC,"You can marinate/brine your fish before cooking it. There's also salt-baked fish, but although that uses several pounds of salt, the fish itself doesn't end up tasting unusually salty.  Recipes abound for DIY flavored nuts (salt, spice mixture, a little oil, and low heat in oven or skillet). Add a lot of salt to whatever water you cook in.  I'm not sure what your hatred of processed/manufactured foods includes. If these aren't on the list, you can make your own (or get at a farmer's market) fermented/lactic acid preserved foods: sauerkraut, pickles, olives, feta, marinated mushrooms.  General rule: the harder the cheese, the saltier. Feta's an exception, but it's stored in brine.   Celery has an unusually high sodium content. I expect you can find other veggies that do as well; incorporate more of them into your diet.  Homemade potato chips and french fries/oven fries are both excellent, and surprisingly easy to make. They taste nothing like the commercial variants."

Bake a bunch of it and cut it up.  Then its ready to put on a wrap.  For the wrap I would just use spinach, cheese, tomato, cucumber, greek yogurt, and dill for a crude tzatziki-ness to it.  They are pretty delicious and are assembled easily in the morning before work.  I would also like to hear other ideas!  As good as wraps are, anything gets old once you eat it enough."

HealthyFood,2aw4ux,Aqua-Tech,2,Thu Jul 17 03:37:49 2014 UTC,"My favorite salad is two oz cumin seasoned black rice,  one oz guacamole, one oz black beans, few tbsp salsa, and one oz Greek yogurt on top of two cups romaine lettuce with a little lime juice.   Or a tomato sandwich. Tomatoes have so little calories but if you like them as much as I do you can stack them high on your favorite bread with some lettuce or kale and my favorite condiment Dijon mustard. Yum!"

I layer a salad each day with goat cheese (or feta), walnuts, pine nuts, chicken, and any fruit I want with a bed of spinach on top. Takes 5 mins in the morning. I add oil&balsamic vin at work before I eat and shake it up. Tastes awesome."
HealthyFood,2aw4ux,Aqua-Tech,1 point,Thu Jul 17 15:12:25 2014 UTC,That's what I basically was doing making salads like that! Everyday....but I really don't want to eat salad anymore or that often! It gave me really bad gas for days and It would hurt my tummy bad! Since i stopped eating salads i feel gas free. Which is awesome! :) maybe my tummy can't handle that much green.
HealthyFood,2aw4ux,alaskanfarmer,1 point,Thu Jul 17 19:42:25 2014 UTC,"Perhaps. Were you using spinach or just ordinary greens? I would give spinach a try if you haven't already, its also much better for you than lettuce.   In any case, if salads aren't for you that's OK. On days I don't feel like salad I will try to just throw a nice variety of things together. For example, a yogurt + granola bar + tuna packet + handful of nuts + apple or banana makes for a great lunch IMO.   Good luck!"
HealthyFood,2aw4ux,teaandpee,1 point,Thu Jul 17 19:51:28 2014 UTC,I have tried spinach and i really don't like spinach at all! But thank you for your suggestion.
HealthyFood,2aw4ux,juliaou,0,Sat Jul 19 13:42:47 2014 UTC,3 chicken breasts for an entire week? I can eat 3 in a day.
HealthyFood,2aw4ux,dillpiccolol,1 point,Thu Jul 17 16:30:05 2014 UTC,3 divided over 5 salads is plenty. 3-4oz of chicken per salad is more than enough. You should look into portion control if that can't sustain you for just a lunch each day.

HealthyFood,2as8ye,FooKingLegend,6,Tue Jul 15 18:29:19 2014 UTC,"There's no evidence to support the notion that greasy/high fat foods cause acne, although I still wouldn't recommend eating a lot of it for other reasons.  I had reasonably bad acne, and I eliminated dairy and cut a lot of carbs from my diet, and my skin improved about 75%. Research suggests that those two things - dairy and carbs (A great place to start is soda or other sugary stuff), tend to inflame acne, so I decided to give it a go. It took at least a month to see any sort of improvement, though, so be patient.  And no dairy, means no dairy. Nothing that lists milk, butter, cheese, etc. as an ingredient. Once you start to see improvements, you can slowly try to reintroduce those things. Drink almond milk instead, and avocado works well in the place of cheese in a lot of things.  As a result of this, my diet was entirely overhauled, and I lost a bit of weight as well, which was a great bonus.  On another note, if your skin is greasy, you need to rethink your skincare routine. Mine used to be greasy as well, but I found that when I moisturized it twice a day, and switched to only cleansing it once a day (just water in the morning, cleanser in the evening) that the greasiness mostly went away. A great resource for this is /r/skincareaddiction."
HealthyFood,2as8ye,maowai,1 point,Tue Jul 15 18:57:10 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for answering! I have some comments.    >There's no evidence to support the notion that greasy/high fat foods cause acne, although I still wouldn't recommend eating a lot of it for other reasons.    Interesting. There's been times where I didn't eat almost any greasy things at all and the acne still came.    >[...] and avocado works well in the place of cheese in a lot of things.    I love avocado. Good to know it's anti-acne friendly.    >(just water in the morning, cleanser in the evening)    Do you mean no soap at all? I understood glycerin soap was good for acne. What do you mean by cleanser?"
HealthyFood,2as8ye,maowai,4,Tue Jul 15 19:31:00 2014 UTC,"I just run water over my face in the shower with no soap or anything, and that's all I do in the morning. Skin becomes greasy because it's too dry, and produces more oil to compensate. I found that in my case, only using water in the morning stripped my skin less, and my face was way less greasy by the end of the day.  As for the ""cleanser,"" I just use that before bed. I'm pretty sure it's pretty much just glycerin soap, but just make sure it's not drying your skin out too much, whatever you're using. If your face feels dry or ""tight,"" it's probably getting dried out too much.  Also use MOISTURIZER. This did a lot for me. I put it on after the shower, and after cleaning my face before bed.  If you head over to /r/SkincareAddiction, they have a lot of good specific product recommendations in their beginner's guide in the sidebar. Also, changing my diet, I feel, made a huge difference for me, so don't discount that. I'm also in my early 20s, and I got tired of looking like a 14 year old, so I took a ton of measures that were reasonably successful.  Good luck with your skin stuff!"

I am the same and use soap free cleanser (living in a big city - skin actually gets really dirty) and then use olive oil as moisturiser under BB cream in the mornings. Of an evening I use an AHA/BHA skin cream which has cleared my skin up to the occasional zit. I can deal with that, prior to this regime I'd tried everything, diet, medication, peroxide solutions; you name it.

HealthyFood,2aoyzc,twomsixer,1 point,Mon Jul 14 19:27:21 2014 UTC,"The problem is, you're missing the fiber from the fruit. The sugar is still there, granted, but it's not offset, so to speak, by the fiber when it's just juice.   That being said, if you weren't going to eat fruits and veggies otherwise, juice would at least be SOME exposure to fruits and veggies.   What about frozen or canned? Preferably without a bunch of processed sauces and syrups and such.   We make multiple trips during the week for produce. In my local store, it's right up front. Grab some healthy food, hop right in line. It's not so bad."
HealthyFood,2aoyzc,avarweth,1 point,Tue Jul 15 02:12:01 2014 UTC,"Mostly sugar...yep. The processing also destroys the antioxidants/phytonutrients/vitamins in large amounts. You can buy bags of frozen berries and freeze bananas (fresh or freeze them when you know you won't be able to eat them before they spoil) as well. Freezing doesn't have much of an effect on the nutrient content compared to juice. You can also freeze fresh greens before they spoil, the pre-frozen spinach tends to taste bad compared to if you freeze it yourself.  Oranges last quite a while when refrigerated too. You can most fresh in season produce on sale in bulk and then freeze part of it as long you you prep it (ex for strawberries cut the tops off). http://nutritionfacts.org/video/fruit-juice-fail/"

Mass-market dried cranberries are geared towards, you know, the mass market, which prefers them sweetened. Most folks find unsweetened cranberries unpalatable, to say the least.

I think my only question is if you're eating the majority of your carbohydrates in the form of vegetables and fruit do you really need any more antioxidants than you're already getting. At some point there's the law of diminishing returns at play, even some vitamins such as C are virtually useless beyond a certain point and others are actually semi-toxic or very toxic (though it would be hard to reach these levels without some sort of strange banana girl esque diet)   Otherwise interesting find, appreciate it."

HealthyFood,2acf07,CalzonePillow,14,Thu Jul 10 16:40:43 2014 UTC,"Try apples. The chewing required to eat an apple (really, chewing in general) sends signals to your brain that help you stay satiated longer. Plus, the fiber helps you stay full. Apples run from about 60-130 calories depending on size.   If you're really always hungry I'd be concerned about the nutrient density of your food. Calories don't equal nutrition, and your body can be getting all the calories it needs yet be nutrient deprived. If that is the case, you will never really feel full (for long), because your body will constantly be begging for legitimate nutrients.   Good luck!"

The business of internet advertising is pretty unique and imo interesting. Some ads are targeted to a grouping of sites and some targeted to the user. So if you've searched for a burger place, fast food, or even just dinner, this may be targeted to you. But odds are just an ad filling a spot for the server.  Edit: you can actually see the adchoices logo in the top right of the ad. So this campaign is probably being run on googles Adwords. Basically Wendy's sent an online advertising company (or possibly an in house team) this graphic and they created the ad in Adwords.

Doesn't taste like the real thing, but helps me feel not as crappy the next day. De-alcoholized wine can be tough to find, though... I have no idea where you'd find it in the UK. In the US I had to call around to a few liquor stores and finally found some de-alcoholized wine at an upscale wine shop (and was actually decently priced). In terms of health facts, de-alcoholized wine is usually 65-75 calories per serving, so that helps.   Otherwise, sticking to wine is probably the healthiest, relatively speaking. White wine is less likely than red wine to result in a hangover, though I can't say if this will hold true for you. Generally speaking, white wine also has less calories. Mixed drinks contain vast amounts of sugar, so I'd recommend steering clear of those.   Good luck!"

If you're new to hard alcohol and are worried you'll overdo it, a tip I found helpful is to order a plain water in between each and every drink.

The vinegar takes care of the preservation needed, although I don't know how long the shelf life really is. The sugar caramelizes the fruit, but you can do that over the stove. I hope you like tart, because without the sugar the fruits aren't going to be very sweet. Perhaps you can cut down on the vinegar to keep some sweetness? Otherwise, I'm sure it would be fine to do without sugar. But I tried making it myself once (with sugar) and it didn't turn out well at all. Let me know if you make a good one. I'd love a good sugarless shrub!"
HealthyFood,29z7m2,threethreezero,2,Sun Jul 6 22:11:45 2014 UTC,The sugar balances out the taste but yes you could use a little less. I wouldn't go below half a cup of sugar if matching to a cup of vinegar. Try using turbinado sugar.

I also prefer iceberg lettuce because of its crunchieness but that's up to you. On top I've added some smoky spices. I didn't really add a dressing to it. I just pured some sweet white balsamic vinegar over it. That's about it I think :)"

Cooking fresh spinach or other greens is as simple as rinsing, tossing in a covered pan, and hitting it with heat for a minute or so, until they wilt. You can overstuff the pan. It's easy for one person to eat an entire 10-ounce package of spinach in one sitting, once it cooks down.  Low-fat meats can be tough if not skillfully handled; marinating a few hours to overnight with wine, vinegar, or other acids and some spices, is an easy way to add flavor and improve texture.  Salt-free herb and spice blends, aromatics (especially the onion/garlic family), and acidic liquids (wine, beer, wine or cider vinegar, citrus) are all excellent ways to add flavor without salt or fat.   When she does use fat, make it count: the higher-quality the oil, the tastier it is. Buy small amounts, and consider refrigerating to prevent it going rancid. Extra-virgin olive oil and coconut oil will both solidify in the fridge; it's nothing to be concerned about, just warm the oil before use."

Greek yogurt and fruit for snack 1, or some other healthy snack. Make your own salad for lunch or turkey on hole wheat, with another vegie. Almonds for a snack 2, or research google for healthy snacks there's 1000 articles. For dinner, utilize a crock pot for dinner. Good place to start anyway, and do cardio and weights a few times a week. Limit alcohol"

HealthyFood,29685t,squid_actually,2,Fri Jun 27 11:46:54 2014 UTC,"Honestly $200 a month for groceries is REALLY easy. You should be able to actually eat and cook on $100 a month. I live in West Los Angeles which really high priced everything, but can easily do 2 weeks worth of grocery shopping for $50 if I shop properly.  As a lunch time meal, I typically do something lighter and easier. Some options to mix and match:    Bowl of cereal Fresh fruit like peaches, apples, bananas, oranges Make a simple quesidilla with just the tortilla and some cheese on a pan. Very easy Microwave a baked potato or sweet potato for a super cheap, healthy and easy starch PBJ sandwich   For dinner:   If you're lazy about cooking, frozen veggies are the best. Carrots, spinach, brocolli, corn, mixed veggies, etc., can easily be microwaved and mixed with a meat like sausage or even a hot dog (not the healthiest, but if you're only adding in 1 hot dog with the veggies, still a super healthy option overall) Whole wheat pasta with tomato sauce (and hey, you can add hot dogs in them as well)   Chicken and turkey are really healthy meat options, but they're ""harder"" to cook if you don't know how to cook. It's not hard to learn though. Any precooked meats like hot dogs are way easy to prepare and eat, but will most likely be less healthy for you. As long as you're not eating a ton of that stuff at once though, you should be ok.   The big thing is actually sticking to a new diet. We all say we want to eat more healthy, but how many of us actually do? You don't need to go all out and just buy a ton of veggies at once, but maybe try incorporating at least 1 home cooked meal a day vs. always eating out and seeing how that goes. Even switching up snacks like potato chips for carrots and hummus/peanut butter can make a difference."

I'm not trying (well it's not the goal) to lose weight so simply a change in the food I purchase is honestly enough (if it tastes good/ easy to make).  I can cook chicken so no worries there, it's more about the time it takes to cook when I have school and 30 hours of work a week :P  I think I may start with healthier snacks and just having simple food dishes for lunch and dinner.

HealthyFood,29685t,buzzaldrinrapstar,2,Fri Jun 27 03:42:55 2014 UTC,"If you really want dive right into it, first you have to stock the basics, i.e. the things that can be used for any meal and would last a long time. Go to the mexican section of the grocery store and get as many seasonings as you can. Quality is not great but the price is. Get oils like canola if you are cheap or olive oil if you can afford it. Then you stock up on your cereals. Rice, oatmeal, pasta. All multigrain! Depending on the store it could be a large premium or a small one, as you shop more you will get more experienced. Now the vegetables. This is the part a lot of people struggle with bc they get old so quickly. Instead what you can do is get frozen, one bag of mixed, one of broccoli, peas and green beans, etc. These are very versatile as you can have them as a side or make fried rice or whatever. If you are feeling fancy, go to a local farmers market and buy anything that catches your eye, even stuff you have no idea how to cook. Then all you have to do is google whatever it is to find some nice recipes, no work at all. Almost forgot to mention, the vegetables you will almost certainly need but you have to use within a few weeks. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, garlic, and tomatoes. I tend to get the big bags as I know I can use them, but maybe you can start with just a few of each. A quick note about fruits, they are nice to get to replace snacks or desserts, but personally I'm not a fruit eater and ok without it. Now dairy. Eggs are always great, greek yogurt (which you can use to substititute a lot of stuff) and milk occassionally. Personally I substitute with almond milk to cook with, but nothing beats a glass of cow milk :). Don't forget to get organic it really makes a difference, especially with the dairy, nutrient and taste wise."

After bulk shopping the essential stuff I probably only spend $100 a month, if that so it's certainly possible. Also forgot to mention one of the things I hate is just the amount of time it takes to make stuff completely from scratch. So I end up eating one big meal a day instead of 3, because you will spend your whole day cooking if not lol. So don't forget to get simple stuff like cereal and sandwich meat, cereal can be good for you depending on what you get (fruit loops and apple jacks are my favorite and are actually not bad for you :P) and even just adding spinach and tomatoes to a chicken sandwich and grilling with a sweet potato in the oven it takes no time at all and is delicious."

There are vegan nut cheeses which are awesome, and health wise similar to nut butters which depending on your needs could qualify as healthy. (High fat, but that's not necessarily always bad.) If you are looking at Daiya, the benefits are would be:   Does not support the dairy/veal industry which is the source of a lot of unnecessary suffering. No cholesterol. (This may or may not be a concern for you.)  Some people believe casein, a component in milk causes cancer and other bad things. I don't really think this claim is sufficiently established to take too seriously, but perhaps this was your nutritionists concern?   Cons:   High calorie, high sodium and not much fiber.

Even the homemade versions of the same foods tend to be healthier.  Maybe try subbing out one breakfast, one lunch, and one dinner per week for a month. Then add one more of each for the next month.  What also works for me to have the predictability of a food schedule without getting bored is to have a Google calendar set up. I picked one dinner and that I liked and created a repeating event every 4 weeks with that meal. Then I added another, and another until the calendar filled up. I always know what's on the menu for the next week, but I don't have the same meal more than once every 4 weeks. I also adjust this seasonally so I have lighter meals in the summer and more soups and stews in the winter.  I also use a recipe app that only contains untested recipes and those that passed my approval. If I try an untested recipe and don't like it and don't see how to fix it well enough to be worth keeping, out it goes. That way I know that whatever is in my app is something I would like to eat."

One of the things I like about it is that it has a built-in browser so you can search for recipes and then if it's one of the major recipe sites, it'll be able to automatically parse the page and download the recipe for you. But it doesn't save it as a link to the page, it actually copies the recipe so if you need to alter it, you can do so easily. You can also add whatever categories you want, so I have food not only categorized by general type (main dish, dessert, etc) but also cuisine and even type of meat. This helps me look up recipes with just chicken, for example. I also created categories for vegan and vegetarian for the couple times I have those with restricted diets.
