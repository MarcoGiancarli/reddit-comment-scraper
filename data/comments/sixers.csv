sixers,3e3utw,Brokoba,11,Tue Jul 21 22:06:03 2015 UTC,Lavoy Allen.   Great Temple Owl that for some unknown reason the Sixers drafted. I still wear my Lavoy jersey to every game.
sixers,3e3utw,internetdotcom,8,Tue Jul 21 19:51:53 2015 UTC,Came here to say this he went to my HS and dunked on me in a pick up game.....it was a good day.
sixers,3e3utw,SKR13,4,Tue Jul 21 19:59:18 2015 UTC,Not everyone can say they were dunked on by an NBA player.
sixers,3e3utw,SKR13,5,Tue Jul 21 20:10:31 2015 UTC,It's one of my biggest achievements in life
sixers,3e3utw,BrentoMussolini,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:13:34 2015 UTC,too bad he's never been dunked on by a NBA-caliber player
sixers,3e3utw,Jdf5097,4,Tue Jul 21 21:53:51 2015 UTC,I went to Pennsbury too. I was in Lavoy's homeroom. Class of '07
sixers,3e3utw,SKR13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:42:13 2015 UTC,We could honestly make an army with the number of kids that graduated from PHS
sixers,3e3utw,themightypooperscoop,2,Tue Jul 21 23:04:10 2015 UTC,Ay Pennsbury! Would've graduated there this past year but I transferred out my sophomore year
sixers,3e3utw,SteveWynn,-4,Tue Jul 21 22:09:46 2015 UTC,He disappeared in big games for temple and was whatever on the sixers
sixers,3e3utw,internetdotcom,7,Tue Jul 21 19:52:57 2015 UTC,He is Temple's all time leading rebounder and I believe the point of this was to talk about guys who weren't that great.
sixers,3e3utw,SteveWynn,-2,Tue Jul 21 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"Well youre right. He disappeared every year in the tourney, definitely not great"
sixers,3e3utw,internetdotcom,2,Tue Jul 21 19:59:03 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/BifF2CT.png  Yeah pretty much averaged a double double throughout college.   You seem like a really cool guy Steve. I bet you are a lot of fun to hang out with.
sixers,3e3utw,SteveWynn,0,Tue Jul 21 20:32:11 2015 UTC,I used to get drunk with lavoy at the draught horse. Still think he stinks
sixers,3e3utw,internetdotcom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:44 2015 UTC,"and by that you mean you were at the Draught Horse the same time as him. I went to Temple too I guess that means I got drunk with Lavoy, Scootie, Juan, and Khalif all the time. We are real good friends they just have no clue who I am and never speak to me."
sixers,3e3utw,SteveWynn,0,Tue Jul 21 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"Never saw juan at the bar once! I believe he had a girlfriend the entire time, they were always making out at the pool it was gross"
sixers,3e3utw,jjohn268,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:49:42 2015 UTC,He was a big reason we had a fighting chance against the Celtics. That's what got him his new deal.
sixers,3e3utw,ank1613,9,Tue Jul 21 21:47:06 2015 UTC,Matt Geiger is my flair on r/nba but I'm considering a hard change to speedy claxton
sixers,3e3utw,dougluss,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:07:43 2015 UTC,Yes! Speedy! I had high hopes for him...
sixers,3e3utw,ChickenLiverNuts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:57 2015 UTC,Geiger will always be a legend for getting Reggie Miller kicked out of that playoff game.  If im going down im taking you with me!
sixers,3e3utw,ratsafari,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely Geiger, dude was an ass kicker"
sixers,3e3utw,CrunchyKorm,5,Tue Jul 21 22:51:40 2015 UTC,"During the 00-01 season I would always get excited when Rodney Buford came off the bench. I haven't looked at his stats ever and I don't really know why I liked him, he was a very mediocre player. Granted, I was 12.  In more recent years? I wanted Rodney Carney to succeed so badly."
sixers,3e3utw,marksills,2,Tue Jul 21 19:59:56 2015 UTC,hahah I was all in on Carney. Dude was athletic as hell
sixers,3e3utw,marksills,5,Tue Jul 21 20:18:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like Dalembert doesnt get enough love, although I wouldnt call him insignificant as he played so long with us, but I loved Slammin Sammy. Heard a couple stories about him being real friendly too.   Also I'm the head of the JaKarr Sampson fan club"
sixers,3e3utw,SteveWynn,2,Tue Jul 21 20:25:43 2015 UTC,Fuck him. All time king of goaltending and bobbled more passes than anyone ever
sixers,3e3utw,marksills,2,Tue Jul 21 20:29:33 2015 UTC,damn no love for Sammy?
sixers,3e3utw,SteveWynn,0,Tue Jul 21 20:29:56 2015 UTC,"He was consistently awful and every year he supposed to have learned how to play, never did!"
sixers,3e3utw,marksills,2,Tue Jul 21 20:40:50 2015 UTC,"He was always a limited player, but I dont really think he had the coordination to develop into much outside of a shot blocker and a rebounder, which he was quite good at. He played his role"
sixers,3e3utw,BrentoMussolini,3,Tue Jul 21 20:43:28 2015 UTC,the king of picking up 2 quick fouls and spending the majority of games on the bench
sixers,3e3utw,ShrekIsNotDrek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:56 2015 UTC,I liked Sammy much more off the court than on. He was such a liability on offense and the defense never really made up for it.

sixers,3e3utw,root88,15,Tue Jul 21 19:22:54 2015 UTC,"I propose that you fail this challenge, sir. Aaron McKie was never insignificant."
sixers,3e3utw,fuji700,5,Tue Jul 21 19:35:41 2015 UTC,Exactly...Since when did the 6th man of the Year become irrelevant ?
sixers,3e3utw,hillsp,3,Tue Jul 21 19:56:41 2015 UTC,"For those of us die hards, I agree. However he is never talked about as a factor in that 2001 championship run these days. It's all about Larry Brown, an old mutumbo, and of course the answer."
sixers,3e3utw,DanaCarvey,2,Tue Jul 21 20:28:35 2015 UTC,He's what makes that NBA Street team so good. AI and Mutumbo need that third guy to slam it and shoot it
sixers,3e3utw,jondonbovi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"YESSSSS. Who doesn't love some Aaron Mckie, honestly?"

sixers,3e3utw,BrentoMussolini,4,Tue Jul 21 19:41:18 2015 UTC,All about that Jumaine Jones. Even had his rookie card...
sixers,3e3utw,Stoned_and_Starving,2,Tue Jul 21 20:34:58 2015 UTC,"Came here to say the same. He had a put-back dunk - I believe during that 00-01 playoff run - that I will never forget but can't find online. Dude took one step in from the foul line, elevated through like three or four people and just rocked the finish. I was so sure that he was gonna be good and I was so sad to see him go."

sixers,3e3utw,Rick_Empty,3,Tue Jul 21 21:52:54 2015 UTC,Speedy Claxton. Dude has a ring and a name straight outta Backyard Baseball.

sixers,3e3utw,SteveWynn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:24:38 2015 UTC,everyone hated him his first week on the team because he was just lou williams with a much worse shot.  Once he started playing pass first I fell in love with him too... i really want the team to sign him for a few years
sixers,3e3utw,109876ers,5,Tue Jul 21 23:01:16 2015 UTC,Jodie meeks was dope
sixers,3e3utw,hillsp,3,Tue Jul 21 19:27:18 2015 UTC,"I wasn't a big fan of Jodie Meeks in Philly, but I think that's because he was kind of held back playing here. I grew to like him when he left."
sixers,3e3utw,SteveWynn,2,Tue Jul 21 19:32:17 2015 UTC,Id love to have him on this sixers team
sixers,3e3utw,iloveopenbar,3,Tue Jul 21 19:36:10 2015 UTC,Would instantly improve the floor spacing. Him and RoCo would be draining 3's all day.
sixers,3e3utw,SteveWynn,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:52 2015 UTC,Is Theo Ratliff insignificant enough?
sixers,3e3utw,jjohn268,5,Tue Jul 21 19:21:55 2015 UTC,He's significant to why we didn't have a better chance at taking that 2001 championship.
sixers,3e3utw,SteveWynn,3,Tue Jul 21 19:28:19 2015 UTC,"If he doesnt get injured, we have a much better team. We were 41-14 with him, team with mutombo wasn't as good IMO"
sixers,3e3utw,carpisxxx,5,Tue Jul 21 19:31:54 2015 UTC,team with mutombo was a .500 team. ratliff was awesome
sixers,3e3utw,fuji700,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:22 2015 UTC,"Mutombo slowed down everything and didnt stop shaq (which is what he was brought in to do). Real shame theo got hurt, he was playing the best basketball of his career"
sixers,3e3utw,pboly44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:56 2015 UTC,Think of how things would be different today if he had played and the sixers won.
sixers,3e3utw,le_fez,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:37 2015 UTC,Significantly Insignificant or Insignificantly Significant. That is the question.
sixers,3e3utw,QuesoDog,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:56 2015 UTC,"Theo was a defensive stalwart before being injured and getting traded.   Unless you are talking about his second stint with us, in which he barely played. But even then, his past tenure doesn't go away."
sixers,3e3utw,jjohn268,2,Tue Jul 21 21:43:43 2015 UTC,Kyle korver shouldve never been traded. We got rid of him to clear up room for fucking elton brand
sixers,3e3utw,lilgodboy,2,Tue Jul 21 20:45:36 2015 UTC,This still angers me  Edit: they traded the 1st they got here for a conditional 2nd too in 2010
sixers,3e3utw,iateapoptart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:08:07 2015 UTC,Marc Jackson...because he about that life.
sixers,3e4lto,divadmilhorn,2,Tue Jul 21 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"I used to not mind Bomani but how can anyone really think this is just a con?  He went on a twitter tirade for a whole day about how we suck and now this.   ""Hinkie's grand master plan is to never win more than 20 games and he will keep getting new contracts forever because I don't know... PONZI SCHEME MUAHAHAHAHAHA."""
sixers,3e4lto,ChickenLiverNuts,2,Tue Jul 21 22:45:14 2015 UTC,"Didn't Bomani have the Hawks winning the finals this year? I believe he also had the Bengals winning the super bowl. Look, I like the guy but he has a habit of being DEAD WRONG."
sixers,3e2p0m,rahbee33,10,Tue Jul 21 14:27:09 2015 UTC,"Kinda admitted they didn't handle the PR that well, thinking the broken part is true"
sixers,3e2p0m,marksills,5,Tue Jul 21 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"He's certainly spinning, but he did say the releases were true.   We just have to wait for more info. At least this is something."
sixers,3e2p0m,marksills,3,Tue Jul 21 14:52:44 2015 UTC,"Yea, one thing Howard is right about is oneil can spin.   I think what they did in the press conference is only say true things but not tell the whole story. I can't think of anything that was said that would be contradicted if the break was true."
sixers,3e2p0m,modestlife,2,Tue Jul 21 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"thinking the broken part is true    Does he say with ""than explaining med terms but truth in releases "" that from a medical standpoint it's not a break?"
sixers,3e2p0m,marksills,2,Tue Jul 21 14:52:41 2015 UTC,Hard to say because he wasn't exactly writing clearly but I think the releases can be 100% true even if the foot is broken
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,-6,Tue Jul 21 15:35:43 2015 UTC,"I suppose it can be technically true but if the foot was in fact re-broken, the team lied by omission."
sixers,3e2p0m,joelinator,4,Tue Jul 21 15:49:14 2015 UTC,It's been a day and no other media source is reporting that it's broken. The more time passes without national media picking this up the more and more it seems to be false.
sixers,3e2p0m,jjohn268,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:14 2015 UTC,"This is part of the reason the situation is so confusing. Oneil's tweets don't help either. O'Neil is making it seem like it was just miscommunication, mainly on the fans part."
sixers,3e2p0m,iloveopenbar,6,Tue Jul 21 21:58:17 2015 UTC,"so last week before we knew the bone was broken, we knew that he was about to have surgery and be out for the year  then we find out that the bone is indeed broken and... he will have surgery and be out for the year  so basically tomato tomahto, he's gonna have surgery and be out for the season"
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,7,Tue Jul 21 15:46:22 2015 UTC,There's a big difference between rebroken and not healing fast enough.
sixers,3e2p0m,LRW35,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:48:44 2015 UTC,But what if he has surgery and is expected to recover fully regardless if be rebroke or not? Then whats the difference?
sixers,3e2p0m,ank1613,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:58 2015 UTC,"A second broken navicular bone is something you pretty much don't recover from. An improper heal is much more of a case by case basis. Obviously over the course of the next season the outcome is the same, but in the long term a second break could have much larger ramifications."
sixers,3e2p0m,LRW35,6,Tue Jul 21 16:11:07 2015 UTC,A second broken navicular bone is something you pretty much don't recover from.   Are you 100% positive?
sixers,3e2p0m,LRW35,7,Tue Jul 21 16:25:22 2015 UTC,"Hoop76 found this article from 2001 about Derrick Fisher and his 2nd navicular surgery. Obviously they are different frames, but its not a death sentence."
sixers,3e2p0m,davidcroda,5,Tue Jul 21 17:02:48 2015 UTC,Oh ok thats pretty cool. I figured it wasnt a death sentence...
sixers,3e2p0m,BrentoMussolini,4,Tue Jul 21 17:05:58 2015 UTC,"Here's the whole article.   This fracture was diagnosed earlier than last year's, both in relation to the injury and the season, which could allow Fisher to return more quickly. Training camp starts in three months.   He played 60 games the next season FWIW."
sixers,3e2p0m,ank1613,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:31 2015 UTC,Derek Fisher is also not 7 feet tall
sixers,3e2p0m,sk1ttlebrau,6,Tue Jul 21 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"That's why I said ""Obviously they are different frames..."" previous to that.  Edit: And to clarify I wasn't necessarily comparing the two. I was just giving more information about how quickly Fisher recovered."
sixers,3e2p0m,Kingdariush,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:27:49 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HamooI0bDpE  success rate for a navicular bone surgery is around 85% and much less for a second surgery
sixers,3e2p0m,sharke93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:37 2015 UTC,"I dunno I broke mine once and didn't let it heal and I legit still have pain to this day. And that was... 6 years ago. Plus it's the same thing that got yao, Walton, and late career McGrady if I do recall correctly."
sixers,3e2p0m,iloveopenbar,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:16 2015 UTC,Walton and Bowie were 30-40 years ago.  I don't consider them examples anymore considering how advanced medical science has become.  I think we gotta look at cases within the last 15 years to see a more accurate trend.
sixers,3e2p0m,ank1613,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:05:02 2015 UTC,But Embiid has only played for like 4 years which worries me more. He pushed his body so hard in such a short amount of time that I feel more worried that he's so young
sixers,3e2p0m,iloveopenbar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:35:16 2015 UTC,It wasn't like he played nothing when he was young. He played soccer and volleyball so it's not like he has a fragile body because he hasn't played ever.
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,3,Tue Jul 21 21:20:57 2015 UTC,i do wonder if him still growing had anything to do with the bone not being right.  this is all too depressing. i'm gonna be in the 'weed helps you heal' thread.
sixers,3e2p0m,iloveopenbar,2,Tue Jul 21 16:30:31 2015 UTC,We have one of those threads?!

sixers,3e2p0m,iloveopenbar,0,Tue Jul 21 17:06:36 2015 UTC,Either way i'd still like to know the truth.
sixers,3e2p0m,sk1ttlebrau,3,Tue Jul 21 15:53:57 2015 UTC,"what you'd like to know are details. details that make no difference in his recovery timeline - which has been known for a while now  if i was his doctor, then yes i'd need to know details like that. as a fan and season ticket holder, i just wanna know when he will be able to play."
sixers,3e2p0m,sportfan73,9,Tue Jul 21 16:22:19 2015 UTC,"if i was his doctor, then yes i'd need to know details like that. as a fan and season ticket holder, i just wanna know when he will be able to play.   Perhaps that's your take. And that's fine. But there are people who don't like having key details about the ""center of the Sixers universe"" being withheld from them (at best) and deliberately lied to (at worst).  If Joel Embiid's navicular suffered a 2nd fracture and they tried to keep that detail from the public, shame on them."
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,2,Tue Jul 21 16:32:25 2015 UTC,"actually my take on this whole thing (and i have no proof for any of this) is that embiid has been a little reckless with his recovery.  between the weight gain, between the leg dunk requiring a boot the next day, running up arena steps, etc. i assume he pushed it too much too soon and it ultimately set him back. of course the sixers can't come out and throw embiid under the bus, so they just release minimum details and are taking the heat so that their prized prospect doesn't have to."
sixers,3e2p0m,ACPhila,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:04:30 2015 UTC,"Considering he's a 19 year old kid, I can completely buy this answer.  I'm really also not that mad about it if they ""lied"", because it doesn't change the facts at all."
sixers,3e2p0m,marksills,2,Tue Jul 21 19:06:57 2015 UTC,I agree. I also see absolutely no value to them in trying to hide it unless they were trying to trade him it seems they just did it to sell tickets which sucks
sixers,3e2p0m,orangeade34,-2,Tue Jul 21 18:48:48 2015 UTC,I agree derek! I trust you are pushing the sixers for transparency here.
sixers,3e2p0m,ludvigsra,2,Tue Jul 21 17:30:03 2015 UTC,the only reason I agree with this is b/c even if the bone is not broken its not like his outlook improves significantly. Its still not good news. So regardless of whether its broken or not broken odds are he will never play in the NBA or at least you cant count on him to.
sixers,3e2p0m,davidcroda,2,Tue Jul 21 16:50:38 2015 UTC,yea thats why when I saw this yesterday i wasnt that upset about embiid as theres not much of a difference. Do wish they would have told us that though
sixers,3e2p0m,CrunchyKorm,11,Tue Jul 21 16:52:31 2015 UTC,He writes these tweets like a 14 year old girl
sixers,3e2p0m,J4BRONI,9,Tue Jul 21 14:42:32 2015 UTC,Character limit.
sixers,3e2p0m,Lazaraaus,10,Tue Jul 21 15:53:18 2015 UTC,So put out a press release like a normal executive.....
sixers,3e2p0m,jondonbovi,3,Tue Jul 21 17:25:23 2015 UTC,Or just write more tweets with the proper spelling
sixers,3e2p0m,pboly44,3,Tue Jul 21 19:55:01 2015 UTC,"I think its rebroken just because if it wasnt, he would of just said ""its not rebroken"", right?"
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,2,Tue Jul 21 17:42:45 2015 UTC,"This is great to hear. It's a little vague, but I got that the releases were true they just should have handled the overall PR better. I told everyone in /r/NBA to chill until our FO says something. People are so quick to jump on bait. Still want to hear more but more optimistic now."
sixers,3e2p0m,OnAWhale,2,Tue Jul 21 16:21:46 2015 UTC,If the bone hadn't rebroken he would have come out and said so directly. This leads me to believe that Cooneys report is true.
sixers,3e2p0m,OnAWhale,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:30 2015 UTC,"Spin doctors.  The comment about they were so focused on Embiid's health and that is why the message from the team was unclear is bull.  He's not in a life or death situation and they aren't the doctors.  They couldn't control the information and the truth revealed itself.  Fans need to expect more from the team than repeating the mantra of ""trust the process."""
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:26 2015 UTC,So is the bone broken or not? That's all we want to know.
sixers,3e2p0m,amanoob,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:46 2015 UTC,"He hasn't said. I don't know how much he's going to share right now, but I figured I'd put all the tweets here so there aren't a bunch of different posts."
sixers,3e2p0m,DerekBodner,3,Tue Jul 21 14:34:58 2015 UTC,"""We prev stated fracture site didn't fully heal."" ""might b guilty spending n focus on Jo...than explaining medical terms, but truth in releases.""  Sounds to me like he's saying they didn't handle the PR as well as they could've but everything they said was true. But that could mean it also rebroke, but they didn't release that? Hard to say."
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,3,Tue Jul 21 15:00:23 2015 UTC,"Haha I agree.  I was hoping he was going to say a bit more, but he hasn't as of yet. This isn't terribly helpful, but at least it's something."
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:02:19 2015 UTC,"I think this makes it clear that the bone is broken. The only issue is if it didn't heal as expected which could've happened for more minor/natural issues (him growing 2 inches, etc) which means he has a decent chance of recovery or whether it was rebroken which makes it look real bad for his future."
sixers,3e2p0m,TheyCallMeTheBreeze,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:13:17 2015 UTC,I look forward to a clear answer from the organization today.
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,3,Tue Jul 21 14:38:31 2015 UTC,I'd have to assume we hear something today from somebody.  How clear it is we'll have to see.
sixers,3e2p0m,TheyCallMeTheBreeze,2,Tue Jul 21 14:39:52 2015 UTC,It's very obvious he said it isn't refractured. He said the release is true.
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:01:39 2015 UTC,The release can be true and they can still be withholding information. The release didn't say he did not refracture his navicular bone.
sixers,3e2p0m,BrentoMussolini,2,Tue Jul 21 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"Well if it was not refractured, thats great news."

sixers,3e2p0m,BrentoMussolini,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:35 2015 UTC,Hope so!
sixers,3e2p0m,SteveWynn,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:48 2015 UTC,"This is really a question of semantics at this point. The original fracture was a stress fracture meaning that the bone was not broken the whole way through. For his first surgery, they would have had to complete the fracture and piece it back together. Then, one of two things might have happened: either the healing stopped before the entire fracture could close up, or it somehow reversed course and the fracture started to get bigger again. ""Bigger"" is a relative term in that we are talking about a change that would be visible only by CT scan and would be measured in millimeters or less. The likelihood that he was walking down the street one day and his navicular snapped in half is zero. So basically, the Sixers interpreted the CT scan as showing that healing had stopped, which is what the press release said and what O'Neil alluded to in those tweets. It's possible that Cooney talked to someone who somehow viewed a CT scan and had a different interpretation, but we are likely talking about drops in the ocean here. Either way he needs another surgery and its a waste of energy tearing our hair out over whether we were ""lied to"" or not when in all likelihood the two reports are more or less the same thing."

sixers,3e4j9p,joelinator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:28:19 2015 UTC,Okafor was consensus number one pick over towns until two weeks before the draft. He was in the spotlight for longer and his flaws got amplified more than anyone else's. I have no qualms about having Okafor over Towns.

Talent acquisition through the draft and an emphasis on player development and building a culture of success ( not the same as winning)  Using the assets that we have including: young talent, cap space, and picks to leverage into worthwhile assets-undervalued players on solid contracts with room for development, picks, pick swaps (FTW!) NOT sacrificing the long-term vision by constraining the roster with FA talent that would bring an increase in short term wins, and jeopordize lottery % and available cap space   Will it work?

McConnell just needs some more strength, which is easy to add.  My guess is that we will see what TJ and Scottie can do between SL and preseason, but my guess is that McConnell builds some more muscle and then starts knockin down the 3s.  That'll be what keeps him on the roster this year, and I think he can do it.  Edit:  Here's my depth chart for next season as of right now:  PG:   Wroten Cannonball Pappy Jack   SG:    Sauce Castillo Hollis Thompson   SF:   RoCo Jerami Grant Jakaar Sampson   PF:   Carl Landry Jason Thompson GOAT Aldemir   C:   Nerlens Noel Jahlil Okafor   Inactive:   Joel Embiid TJ McConnell"

sixers,3e2kn8,neutropills,4,Tue Jul 21 14:03:38 2015 UTC,"Same. My big concern is who is feeding him the ball. If we have a ball dominant pg like wroten or just an incompetent that cant feed the post, that wont be good for jah's development"
sixers,3e2kn8,neutropills,2,Tue Jul 21 14:06:24 2015 UTC,"We'll see how Pierre does. Both he and Wroten are at least capable passers, even if they aren't very willing passers."
sixers,3e2kn8,lilgodboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's too much of a concern. Having enough shooting/spacing to keep help defenders away (and to keep whoever's checking the PG from sagging off and arriving with the ball) is probably the bigger issue. That happened a lot to the Sixers in the first part of last season, whether it was Nerlens or Sims or Luc."
sixers,3e2kn8,neutropills,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:00 2015 UTC,"I think we should be in good shape. We have three guys now (Stauskas, Covington, Thompson) that can knock it down from long-range. I'm a little concerned about the offensive spacing between him and Nerlens, neither one can really drag their defender away from the paint. Defensively, though, I think Nerlens helping will really be a boon to Okafor."

sixers,3e2kn8,packimop,7,Tue Jul 21 15:55:58 2015 UTC,I'd say around 15 shots per game. I can see him going on early game scoring runs and drawing the double...
sixers,3e2kn8,Youseff_Fictitious,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:56 2015 UTC,I agree. Thats why i think he'll end up with 20 points per game. Hes gonna have the green light from day 1

sixers,3e2kn8,wonderbreadftw,3,Tue Jul 21 14:28:03 2015 UTC,i think he averages 18 and 9 this year so probably around 15 per game.
sixers,3e2kn8,lilgodboy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:33:21 2015 UTC,All of the shots.
sixers,3e2kn8,girlfriend_pregnant,0,Tue Jul 21 21:27:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll see a lot of doubles unless the Sixers use lineups with very few shooters sharing the court. Okafor's not going to be an efficient scorer and he can't make foul shots. Most teams will be content to let him go at their center one-on-one instead of leaving 3-point threats open. Plus, whoever's covering Nerlens will probably be lurking around."

If we already knew about the surgery and him sitting out the year, then why hide the fact that it actually broke? It's insanely unnecessary and just further insinuates the secretive and deceptive tactics the team has gotten a bad rep for.  It's like your friend told you he slept with your sister. You got mad and then slowly just accepted it. Then a week later after you calmed down he tells you he's actually been doing it for months now."

sixers,3e0hoh,Vandredd,3,Tue Jul 21 13:56:53 2015 UTC,They didn't say he was a prison rapist either. Can this team be held to any kind if standard on this sub?  Is expecting not to be lied to really an abomination to the Hinkie faithful?
sixers,3e0hoh,rahbee33,3,Tue Jul 21 05:27:14 2015 UTC,"You have no proof they lied about anything.  All we know is that Cooney said it's broken and he doesn't know anything more than that.

Of course, if he isn't willing to stop being a consumer it will be hard for his complaints to be heard by the 76ers."

sixers,3e0hoh,Taxman29,2,Tue Jul 21 01:03:20 2015 UTC,"Yea, the media hates when they dont get told all the stuff they want to be told...hence the mishandled it.  Just like Chip mishandles his press conferences, did you notice how they only people who think Chip is smug pompess ass are the media, while most casual fans laugh at the media when they get stiff armed in press conferences with quick smarmy answers to stupid questions that deserve them."
sixers,3e0hoh,Cainez,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:03 2015 UTC,"I'm totally with you about when it's dumb menial questions, which most press conference sports reporting is. Like I said somewhere else in this thread (using a previous example), I don't give a shit about how Marshawn Lynch plans to attack the defense for his next game. He's going to try and play football well. That's what he does.  But I don't think we can classify this as the same situation as the ones you mention with Kelly, or even with Hinkie before hand.  Gonzalez is asking for more information than necessary here, but the only reason this whole minor situation is sticking with me is because this isn't some ""what will you change moving foward"" game-planning BS inquiry. The fact is that if the organization knew (not confirmed as of yet, and may never be) that he actually re-broke his foot and attempted to gloss it over with the ""healed less than anticipated"" release, then they unnecessarily lied for zero benefit.  Asking for them to tell the entire truth when they are already issuing press releases on the event of a serious injury isn't the same as the Chip Kelly situation."
sixers,3e0hoh,BCSinReverse,4,Tue Jul 21 20:42:50 2015 UTC,Good article
sixers,3e0hoh,chipsvisor,6,Tue Jul 21 20:49:38 2015 UTC,"Ehh, it's just one long headline. It's the same thing repeated over and over, and seems like he might be a little upset that the organization locks out media.  It's an interesting read with a lot of unnamed sources and hearsay. He never explains why he thinks the organization is obligated to share information on the injury."
sixers,3e0hoh,MatCauthonsHat,7,Tue Jul 21 00:47:54 2015 UTC,The organization owes it to the fans at this point.  I always hate the narrative of how not answering questions to the press is a disservice to the fans and can't stand when Mike Missanelli goes on his rants about that and tries to demonize players like Marshawn Lynch for avoiding questions.  But this is one of the rare instances where the organization legitimately owes it to the fans to discuss this.  The questions in the last paragraph of the article were excellent.
sixers,3e0hoh,BCSinReverse,5,Tue Jul 21 01:00:32 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I don't care about how Marshawn Lynch (using your example) plans to run on Sunday. It's not important. The Sixers in this case (assuming they knew about the break at the time of the ""not healing as much as anticipated"" release) deliberately did not tell the entire truth about something - and very unnecessarily so. And whether we like it not, this public perception of the front office being so secretive that it's dishonest is a bad look for the organization. Whether that ultimately matters is probably negligible, but it's still unnecessary.   This is not a referendum of the plan, of Hinkie's draft decisions, or any of that. They are just very, very bad at handling PR recently."
sixers,3e0hoh,MatCauthonsHat,5,Tue Jul 21 01:08:33 2015 UTC,I could not disagree more.  I'd never provide any information I did not have to.  Information always has value.  It can be used one way or another.  It should never be given out for nothing.  Just complete the rebuild and win.  Lie all you want along the way.  I don't care.  My feelings don't get hurt.

I get what you're saying in theory but for this situation specifically hiding that portion of the truth has literally no potential positive effect (taking into account we now know it anyway).  What, was he going to be traded? Nothing different was going to happen! That's why this is so dumb in the first place - because the 100 percent truth has the same effect as what was originally told. There's no reason to hide it."

sixers,3e0hoh,MatCauthonsHat,3,Tue Jul 21 13:20:40 2015 UTC,"i thought most of those questions were way too much. I think they should have told us about the break, but I never have ever expected an organization to tell the success rate of a doctor.    How did it happen? when?   They basically told us this, they dont really know, but when they went to the doctors they saw the injury.    What were the different opinions of the different specialists?   Never heard an organization release this info, and it doesnt really matter, what matters is whats happening. I'd assume the debates were between surgery or no surgery/rest with long rehab.   What language did they use in their diagnosis?   I'd assume English, but Joel does speak French.   Is Embiid still pain-free?   They told us he was about 3 weeks ago, I wouldnt expect a week by week update on Joel's pain.   What’s the success rate for a second navicular procedure?   Look at Pubmed. Not their job to tell us that.   Has the doctor who will do the procedure performed it before? How many times? What was his/her success rate?   Has any team ever released this, besides maybe with Dr. Andrews?"

sixers,3dz3mv,IMDATBOY,4,Tue Jul 21 02:54:49 2015 UTC,You guys can't swap this year if we arent a top 10 pick because any pick we land outside of that is owed to Chicago.
sixers,3dz3mv,hawktherapper,3,Tue Jul 21 03:22:17 2015 UTC,"The implication is that you'll be in the lottery and the general feeling around here is that there will only be a pick swap if you guys get lucky (unlucky really) and get the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd picks.  So, yea, we can't swap if after the lottery y'all are outside the top 10, but I don't think any 76ers fan thinks if you're not in the top 10, we'll have a later pick than you."

sixers,3dz3mv,sk1ttlebrau,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:14 2015 UTC,"It's a risk but one almost all kings fans agree we have to make.   I guess perception is everything.  We would hate to put all our eggs in the basket of signing (quite honestly) mediocre free agents and hope it takes our team to the 7th or 8th seed.  Our history isn't much richer than yours over the last 10 years, so I guess I just don't get it.  You had your picks in the top 10 if you were horrible again, Stauskas started to show potential towards the end of last year.  I get shit is rough with Boogie/Karl, but you got the guy for 3 years.  I'm sure you could've at least played the year out, seen how the chips fell, and revisited the issue next offseason."
sixers,3dz3mv,IMDATBOY,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:18:02 2015 UTC,"It goes beyond our history of losing games though.  The impatience has a lot to do with what the fan base dealt with in the Maloof era, the thread that we barely hung on by when most believed the Kings were 100% going to Seattle, and what the new arena that comes next year represents.  We have a major cultural need right now, and that need is to instill a more mature, winning culture that hasn't existed in years.  You say mediocre free agents and you might be right, but average NBA players are tough commodities to get when it comes down to it.  These guys are quality role players who have been with winning franchises, and they chose to sign with the Kings.  That's a huge deal for this team's mentality.  Plus, with Boogie and Rudy both already being 20+ scorers, it really does come down to the Kings putting quality NBA players around them, and that's what they finally were able to do.    The end goal is always a championship, but I won't lie and say I wouldn't be happy with fun, competitive basketball back in Sacramento.  Of course the goal is to strive for more, but this whole city needs a team that they can be proud of again.  The last 7 years, this team's mentality and culture has been immature, frustrated and confused.  The team has been characterized by it's young guys for far too long.  Just having a team that resembles that winning culture that used to exist in the early 2000's is a huge morale boost for the fanbase and Sacramento as it attempts to revitalize the city simultaneously."
sixers,3dz3mv,IMDATBOY,-1,Tue Jul 21 19:47:33 2015 UTC,"As a kings fan, Sixers fans are missing that we don't give a shit. We understand that you guys got a sweet, no risk deal. Our concern is putting a good basketball team on the floor for the next few years, and we're hoping that those swaps won't matter in the end. If they do end up coming into play, we screwed up anyway. And although you guys get the extra lottery balls, that just isn't as a significant for us as it is for you all, since the idea of offering up the swapping rights is so worth putting more proven vets around Boogie.   This deal is a clear win for Phili, but that doesn't necessarily make it a loss for Sac, and I think that's a major thing many Sixers fans aren't putting any effort toward understanding. Which makes sense, it's hardly intuitive to think the other team could gain anything positive from such a clearly beneficial trade on your side.  Edit: Screw it, downvote outside perspective all you want.  I'm hardly saying anything negative about the Sixers by acknowledging why the Kings took the risk on the trade.  Keep telling me how much Kings fans are in denial while you all ignore every other possibility that isn't the best case scenario for your team as well.  If that really is the issue you guys have with Kings fans, at least we have that in common."

I think the Kings will probably be worse, so the percentages would be higher.  Since there's a lottery, the pick swaps are huge.  (i.e. let's say Sixers are 3rd worst team again & the Kings finish 5th worst.  Our chances at getting #1 jump from 15.6% to 24.4%, or going from having a 1/6 chance to a 1/4).  Get excited."

The DMC/Karl clash and Rondos antics as well as the front-office mess has all been covered so I won't get too into it, but one thing no one is really taking into account in Sacramento is health.  Their rotations aren't exactly made up of spring chickens. Rondo, Bellini, and Gay are all approaching 30. Andre Miller is 39. Reggie Evans & Caron Butler are both 35."
sixers,3dz3mv,ClassicalUrine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"Reggie Evans isn't on the roster and Andre Miller hasn't been retained yet.  But even if he is retained, he's our 3rd string point guard behind Rondo and Collison.  And he's actually still pretty damn good.    Also, Gay is approaching 30 but is averaging career highs in multiple categories.  If anything, we need the extra experience of some of these older guys to pair with our younger guys like Boogie, Ben McLemore, Willie, ect.  We have a decent balance of age on this team."
sixers,3dz3mv,speak27,6,Tue Jul 21 18:58:47 2015 UTC,"i'd be surprised if the kings ended up having one of the worst records in the league.  they still have boogie who i hear is pretty good and divac surrounded him with veterans. it's 8th seed or bust over there.  if he gets hurt, or if the bubble bursts with him and the coach, then our chances are better.  other than that, its just a slight increase in ping pong balls"
sixers,3dz3mv,aBagorn,6,Mon Jul 20 19:48:09 2015 UTC,"That's certainly how Kings fans are looking at it. The glossed over fact is: sure, they have some ""decent"" talent, but seriously, look at the history of the players from the coach down, they're going to have a really hard time not butting heads.  George Karl + Boogie + Rondo on a 1 yr deal = someone not coming out the other side alive. Throw in JR Smith and I wouldn't miss a single game. Not joking."
sixers,3dz3mv,hawktherapper,4,Mon Jul 20 20:09:54 2015 UTC,Could someone explain how this affects the Sixers draft picks? I know that there is some type of conditional swap but I don't know the specifics.
sixers,3dz3mv,aBagorn,4,Mon Jul 20 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"Basically if the Kings pick falls inside the top 10, the Sixers have the right to swap picks (which they would if the Kings pick ends up being higher).  What this essentially boils down to is extra ping pong balls.   Say we finish with the worst record and the Kings end up with the 4th worst record.  Instead of having a 25% chance at the first pick, we'd also get the first pick if the Kings got it (11.9% chance), so in essence we would have a 36.9% chance* of getting the top pick.  *I'm pretty sure that's how this works, just a straight addition of the odds. Though I've never taken a stats/probability class so there might be more going on"
sixers,3dz3mv,Sdt6023,2,Mon Jul 20 20:49:46 2015 UTC,"For the 1st pick, it's straight addition, if the 76ers/Kings both miss out on the top selection (in this scenario) it becomes a lot more messy.  Basically you'd wanna look at the odds of the four(?) potential winning scenarios which are, 76ers/Kings both in top 3 [Kings Higher], 76ers/Kings both in top 3 [76ers Higher], 76ers in top 3 but Kings aren't [76ers Only], Kings in top 3 but 76ers aren't [Kings Only].  Add those 4 odds and then subtract the [76ers Higher][76ers Only] and that's the real % odds the Kings pick swap improves us in terms of what the lottery balls boil down to which is a top 3 pick."

sixers,3dz3mv,Sdt6023,2,Tue Jul 21 10:36:31 2015 UTC,"If I'm correct on this, the sixers can swap with the Kings as long as the Kings pick is top 10. If their pick is 11-30, the sixers can't swap and the obligation to ever send the pick goes away. In other words, we need the Kings to have a top 10 pick and have a better pick than the Sixers to realize that pick swap. Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong."
sixers,3dz3mv,NolanJones,3,Mon Jul 20 20:47:12 2015 UTC,"The pick swap is for the next two years, we can swap once, twice or never (if we always have the better pick).   We cannot swap the pick if they trade the pick to the Bulls as the result of a previous trade (top 10 protected 1st rounder goes to the Bulls), anything outside of the top 10 will go to the Bulls, therefore we won't be able to swap what they don't have."

But it sucks none the less. I wasn't expecting it to be silent all day long though. Cooney's article has been up since midnight last night and there hasn't been a single confirmation or denial in any which way from any other party.   But I guess this is what we signed up for. At least the team is relevant?"

Its not like they were trying to trade Joel, I just dont see why them saying ""it wasn't healing right"" is such a big deal...the bones broke, maybe the kings would have been less 'generous' (stupid) in their trade with us if they knew we were down a big man.

sixers,3dypvl,girlfriend_pregnant,13,Mon Jul 20 16:55:51 2015 UTC,"Actually, I believe Iverson would be twice as great if he was drafted in 2006 instead of 1996.   You look at Iverson, and obviously his off-court decisions and motivation were what held him back. But the other major factor was on the court. That guy took a BEATING. He had to go to the rim, but every game he was going to take some shots while trying to do so.   Today's game, guys couldn't do half of what they used to do to AI without getting a technical. The game has been designed to reduce the strength of big guys and show off flashy gaurds even more."
sixers,3dypvl,109876ers,6,Mon Jul 20 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"This...the amount of foul shots he would of taken post-Donaghy era would of been record setting. It's a shame that the refs of his era conspired against him, probably took a year off his NBA shelf life."
sixers,3dypvl,fuji700,5,Mon Jul 20 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"On the court, he'd be just as good. He'd still put all types of pressure on opposing defenses.  Off the court would be worse for him. Everyone has cameras these days."
sixers,3dypvl,iloveopenbar,3,Mon Jul 20 17:05:20 2015 UTC,"Better, you would have to think? Imagine him running spread pick & roll/pick & pop or spursian motion-esque dribble handoffs instead of just isoing against a clogged lane every time.   For what it's worth I know the overall percentages aren't good but I don't remember him ever missing an uncontested 3. I just don't think he took very many either."
sixers,3dypvl,heytho,3,Mon Jul 20 18:06:51 2015 UTC,"I think one thing that gets glossed over when trying to transplant players into different eras is the thinking that they would play the same way even when playing in a different era. In the late 90's the NBA was still mesmerized by Jordan's mid-range fadeaways and the young stars to join the NBA including Iverson were clearly influenced.   If Iverson was drafted this year by Hinkie, I think he would develop a formidable 3 pointer to compliment his already amazing slashing and open court game. People like Iverson are transcendent talents that would dominate in any era."
sixers,3dypvl,arjunbsharma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"AI would have still been great, but not as great in this era.  He was a major ISO player and his inefficiency wouldn't have been tolerated in today's NBA.   Also, I don't think he would have fared as well playing against the type of defenses (Thib's D) that started to arise after the 2002 rule changes.   Plus, with today's emphasis on team basketball and moving the ball, I can't imagine AI being very receptive to that."

sixers,3dy9mi,faithdies,5,Mon Jul 20 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"They were very adamant that their was no new injury and there was no pain, it was just healing slow, which doesn't sound that bad to me and different was other big men.   If this is true, a broken bone flies in the face of that.  It completely changes the conversation."
sixers,3dy9mi,Hirshologist,5,Mon Jul 20 17:38:31 2015 UTC,Apparently if there is pain it is very little. Embiid was shooting before games his summer league. He apparently looked good too
sixers,3dy9mi,SeriouslySeriousGuy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:40:56 2015 UTC,"A broken bone is a broken bone.   That wasn't the message the Sixers gave us.   They said the healing slowed down more than it should.  Even if he's not feeling pain, which I doubt, a broken bone resets everything."
sixers,3dy9mi,Hirshologist,2,Mon Jul 20 17:52:27 2015 UTC,"The surgery resets everything in general, no matter what the reasoning.  Whether there was a re-break or it was ""not healing properly"", they still need to go in and put in a bone graft.  The issue is that if it is a break, it's probably more likely he'll be injury prone.  Other than that, this news changes nothing."
sixers,3dy9mi,sk1ttlebrau,2,Mon Jul 20 22:16:54 2015 UTC,"The issue is that if it is a break, it's probably more likely he'll be injury prone."
sixers,3dy9mi,Hirshologist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:20:04 2015 UTC,"Right, so who cares about what they said?  He's going to miss the season regardless of whether it's broken, not healing properly, or they have to amputate his foot."
sixers,3dy9mi,sk1ttlebrau,5,Mon Jul 20 22:22:21 2015 UTC,I still don't understand why you care so much. As a fan of the team the impact is the same. He's out for the season.
sixers,3dy9mi,faithdies,9,Mon Jul 20 17:39:24 2015 UTC,"Because the fear with Embiid was/is his ability to not get injured over and over again.   That's what happened to Oden, Yao, and etc.   So, when the word was that his first injury hadn't completely healed, that's less worrisome.  It's just a matter of us being patient while he continues his process.   But now that it's broken, that's different.  All of sudden, Embiid is no longer a player who's trying to heal, he's another center that's brittle and can't stay healthy.     If this news is true, everything with Embiid is fucked.   Breaking a bone again despite not playing is literally the absolute worst thing that could have happened."
sixers,3dy9mi,Hirshologist,3,Mon Jul 20 17:50:40 2015 UTC,"I think the surgery is actually the same.  Someone else commented about a pencil analogy, I thought that was pretty spot on and kind of explains a lot of things.  Injuries like this are tricky.  Any medical expert would tell you that this is done on a case-by-case basis, so even if there was a break, it's not incredibly damning of the FO and doesn't necessarily mean they lied to us."
sixers,3dy9mi,sk1ttlebrau,2,Mon Jul 20 22:15:27 2015 UTC,"There's a reason why medicine is a ""practice."""
sixers,3dy9mi,DeanBlandino,4,Tue Jul 21 07:17:41 2015 UTC,"It's not even about next season, it's about his long term health, a rebroken bone is a lot more worrying than just 'not healing properly'"
sixers,3dy9mi,TheSmushRoom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:09 2015 UTC,Is that really true?
sixers,3dy9mi,DeanBlandino,2,Tue Jul 21 07:26:40 2015 UTC,"Because a rebreak is more career threatening than a simulated healing process, that's why people care. And they obviously knew that's why they told him to get surgery"
sixers,3dy9mi,superdude523,2,Mon Jul 20 19:21:44 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  The CT scans could have shown less healing than expected, like they originally announced, so they chose to do a bone graft surgery to speed up the process. It's possible that after making that decision, they ran some more scans that revealed a fracture. We don't know either way."
sixers,3dy9mi,juco818,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:30:52 2015 UTC,CT scans show broken bones.  It's the most comprehensive scan we have when it comes to bones. It should be quite obvious and there shouldn't be confusion.
sixers,3dy9mi,Hirshologist,4,Tue Jul 21 01:16:16 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Disappointed they have yet to hold a press conference regarding this all.
sixers,3dy9mi,BCSinReverse,6,Mon Jul 20 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"It's been 13+ hours since Cooney posted his article and absolutely nobody else has reported it.  Why would the team hold a press conference (which they only really do after the draft and trade deadline) for one report?  At the very most we'll get another press release with new info, but I'd be surprised if it's today."
sixers,3dy9mi,rahbee33,4,Mon Jul 20 17:40:27 2015 UTC,My confusion also comes from no national media reiterating it. Embiid setback news is very big.
sixers,3dy9mi,CrunchyKorm,4,Mon Jul 20 19:51:44 2015 UTC,"Right? They were all over the report about the initial setback.  Usually when something like this comes out the other beat writers (Pompey, Moore), plus the national media would have something up about it. Anything. The only other things I've seen today were a Gonzo piece on CSNPhilly with a little new info (concerning talking to the doctors) and the Pavorsky piece on LB which didn't add any new info.  As we get further into the day this gets a little murkier the longer it goes on. It could still be 100% true, but I feel like somebody would have come out and said ""My sources said this too.""  Who knows anymore."
sixers,3dy9mi,rahbee33,2,Mon Jul 20 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't doubt this is a possibility any more. Hell, it actually sounds very likely, but this story has been out for hours and only Philly media is on it. I guess everyone is waiting for confirmations."
sixers,3dy9mi,CrunchyKorm,2,Mon Jul 20 20:08:49 2015 UTC,"Well since the last release last Saturday said they'd get the procedure done in 7-10 days that would put them at this weekend or very early this week.  I think there is a chance he had or is having the procedure already. Maybe that's why nobody can get confirmation? I have to imagine Bodner, Moore, Pompey are all working on it and I'd assume the one report perked the ears of at least a few national guys.  I guess we just have to wait and see - like always."
sixers,3dy9mi,rahbee33,0,Mon Jul 20 20:12:29 2015 UTC,At the very least they should confirm or deny the report.
sixers,3dy9mi,SteveWynn,4,Mon Jul 20 17:41:58 2015 UTC,"Why? They never release statements on stuff like this until it's confirmed by multiple sources. This is one writer who is making a pretty big claim with nobody to back him up as of yet.  I'm not saying it's wrong, because we just don't know, but if Hinkie and Co. ran around making statements on all of these things all the time they'd never get any work done.  Don't hold your breath for any sort of statement."
sixers,3dy9mi,rahbee33,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"Not just for this report, for the whole Embiid situation as a whole.  They didn't hold anything when they announced he was going to miss a second straight season for another surgery.  It's a bit disrespectful to the fans honestly and this is coming from someone that is 100% in on the process and everything."
sixers,3dy9mi,BCSinReverse,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:05 2015 UTC,I guess that's personal preference then.  I don't see any need for a press conference. It's not something that NBA teams do very often so I don't think we should expect the Sixers too. Most everything is announced via statements.
sixers,3dy9mi,rahbee33,0,Mon Jul 20 18:23:18 2015 UTC,If we had a press conference we would have found out about the broken bone instead of it coming via media leak a week later.  The level of people being apologists around here is irritating at times.  This is the guy who was supposed to be the franchise cornerstone and he is out for a second straight season.  It would be greatly appreciated and a service to the fans to actually go out there and answer some questions on this instead of only releasing reactionary statements in response to leaks uncovered by the media.
sixers,3dy9mi,BCSinReverse,2,Mon Jul 20 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"Hinkie did touch on it in the press conference after the draft where he said:   ...We got to March, and in March he had a CT scan that looked right on schedule. on that point he was nine months post [operation]. And they said, ""This looks excellent. Everything is good. Take the next step."" The next step that we always talked about. That went great. And he played wonderfully and was able to do more and more day and day by day. Including like, play, and play in our gym, and shoot and run and do all sorts of things.  And we had one more precautionary [CT scan], it was largely the pre-summer league one. We had that and it looked different. It just looked different.   Then in the official statement last Saturday (10 days ago) they said:   A collective decision has been made that the best approach to promote full healing would be to proceed with a bone graft of the fracture site. We anticipate the procedure will take place in the next 7-10 days and result in Joel missing the upcoming season.   Now there is one report that has yet to be confirmed by another journalist or the team and you want a full press conference? They've been answering questions about everything up to this point and I'm sure if there is big news to talk about they will talk about it either via statement or press conference.  Teams don't call press conferences every week to talk about this stuff. Unless they are found to be caught red handed lying about this - which would be huge considering the uproar over the Jrue trade - I'd expect this to just be a release."
sixers,3dy9mi,rahbee33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:49 2015 UTC,"Please, don't act like the press conference after the draft sufffices for Embiid's situation.  The Sixers whole stance at that time was still that they were getting second opinions and would have more information later.  I'm not talking about a press conference every time some new bit of news comes out but when they finally decided on the second surgery and shelving him for the second straight season they should have had a press conference.  There were no second opinions, they had come to their conclusion and they should have presented themselves to answer questions on it.  Instead they go the route of only revealing as little as they possibly can based on what has leaked out through media outlets.  It's honestly a bit disrespectful to the fanbase who has been in complete 100% support thus far and continues to be so."
sixers,3dy9mi,BCSinReverse,2,Mon Jul 20 20:14:18 2015 UTC,"I wasn't saying it sufficed, I was saying they've been keeping us in the loop. I feel like your persecuting the Sixers for something that nobody else around the league does. Nobody is going out and presenting detailed info about players injuries or surgeries in press conferences regardless of how important they are. As an organization you only let out as much information as you absolutely have to.   when they finally decided on the second surgery and shelving him for the second straight season they should have had a press conference.   And what would they have said that would have been any different than the press release? Nothing. If it turns out they were hiding information about the break in the statement then there is no way they would've said anything about it during a press conference anyways.   I understand you want information - we all do, but that's not really how the league works and it certainly isn't how the Sixers have operated over the last 3 years."
sixers,3dy9mi,rahbee33,0,Mon Jul 20 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"There is no way they would've said anything about it in a press conference?  So you think if they were asked if he re-fractured his foot they would have flat out just lied?  No I doubt they would have, which goes to show the use of press conferences.  I can't stand people like you."

sixers,3dy9mi,DariosDentist,-4,Mon Jul 20 18:20:03 2015 UTC,Most of you are either denying this or making excuses for lying
sixers,3dy9mi,SteveWynn,4,Mon Jul 20 18:28:04 2015 UTC,"Considering the context the news was presented in and the recent history of getting lies about Embiid from beat writers - I think it's justified to at least question it.

They knew about Embiid's injury for a long time--team's lie when it comes to bad news.  Hinkie took a gamble in Embiid and it's turning out to be a bust."
sixers,3dy9mi,Trainwrek,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I would say its too early to tell..but if its actually rebroken after playing no basketball I think we can expect his career to be injury plagued.
sixers,3dy9mi,rahbee33,3,Mon Jul 20 21:08:02 2015 UTC,"He has been playing though:   Since the season ended and up until the June 13 statement, a source said Embiid was working out daily at the team’s practice facility. When asked if Embiid was playing five-on-five, the source said that he hadn’t, but “only because there weren’t enough people to play five-on-five. He was playing very meaningful games of three-on-three and was doing full-court workouts. He is pretty much a full go.” Words used to describe Embiid’s play were “dominant” and “explosive.”   Source  So although it wasn't 5v5 he was still playing."
sixers,3dy9mi,ohnoyoudidnt29,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:09:39 2015 UTC,3 v 3 is A LOT different than playing in a Nba game. An Nba game where he is facing other dominant bigs and fighting for rebounds every play is way more taxing than 3 v 3

I don't buy the BS about the Rockets sitting him to suppress value; the simple fact is that they had Brewer and Harden and KJ wasn't good enough to crack their rotation.  Oh well, live and learn I guess."
sixers,3dv3el,neutropills,7,Sun Jul 19 19:46:22 2015 UTC,We already have a logjam of semi-ok guys on the wing. Thompson/Stauskas/Grant/Covington/Sampson are all going to be competing for 96 minutes of playing time and are cheaper
sixers,3dv3el,xjcs97sy,0,Sun Jul 19 22:17:40 2015 UTC,"I would take KJ over Thompson, Grant, and Sampson."
sixers,3dv3el,jjohn268,2,Mon Jul 20 02:17:12 2015 UTC,"May I ask why? Thompson is a hell of a shooter, honestly one of the better 3 point threats in the league. He had a rough start to the season but was on fire in the second half.  Jerami Grant seems to do everything that KJ does(not quite the highlight blocks, but he's crazy athletic and has the tools to be a great wing defender) plus he has shown some initial shooting ability too.  Sampson? Eh. I can agree there. I know I'm probably just biased against how terrible he was at the beginning of the season, but he was probably one of our more reliable players towards the end. If nothing else, he projects to be a pretty solid wing defender as well."
sixers,3dv3el,intoxxx,2,Mon Jul 20 11:52:06 2015 UTC,"Grant and KJ ended up with fairly similar lines actually, and I think Grant was running fairly hot from 3 given his poor shooting overall. KJ was also a much better finisher.   Grant was actually probably just as impressive on defense though, and a year younger, which isn't nothing."
sixers,3dv3el,zigzagzil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:37:32 2015 UTC,"If we're acknowledging Grant went on a hot streak at the end, we'll need to bring up that KJ started extremely hot himself from 3 and regressed to the mean after.   But you're right about KJ currently being a better finisher. I also think that big time blocks and dunks like he does have more than just the normal impact. No way guys wanted their shots blocked out into the stands and to be on that highlight reel.  I really like Grant, so I'm a bit biased in who I would rather take. Plus, Grant doesn't have a crazy mom, so there's that."
sixers,3dv3el,intoxxx,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that KJ's underlying shooting stats + college stats indicate he ""should"" be a better shooter than Grant. That might not be the case in the long run, but KJ probably ran kind of bad and Grant ran good, so we should say they're probably roughly equal in that regard (or not different enough that we can really tell).  One interesting thing - RPM type metrics appear to prefer Grant to KJ. That could be noise, but it's not a bad thing, either."
sixers,3dv3el,zigzagzil,2,Mon Jul 20 15:55:10 2015 UTC,"Ah, I misunderstood you. I just remember being pleasantly surprised at how well KJ was shooting the 3 at the beginning of the season.  The RPM is interesting. I like it bc it backs my guy, but part of me thinks it may be the fact that Grant played against backups in the beginning part of the season, where KJ was starting quickly. I'd have to look up splits though and see how that all shook out.  One thing I do know though, as you mentioned Grant is a year younger plus he is on a much better contract now. All in all it has worked out."
sixers,3dv3el,intoxxx,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:44 2015 UTC,"I'd go Thompson and Grant over KJ in a heartbeat.  That said, I don't know why you were downvoted for giving your opinion."
sixers,3dv3el,Zeus_Wayne,2,Tue Jul 21 06:35:59 2015 UTC,I'd much rather give this money to KJ than a couple of Hinkie specials to Wilbekin and Jackson.   Why ?
sixers,3dv3el,throwaweight7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:20:57 2015 UTC,3 million a year us a top 10-15 contract
sixers,3dv3el,MatCauthonsHat,2,Mon Jul 20 01:20:56 2015 UTC,Yeah but rookie contracts tend to be bargains.
sixers,3dv3el,Iputthescrewintuna,7,Mon Jul 20 03:53:38 2015 UTC,man i miss KJ. hope he gets more PT this season than he did after the trade.

sixers,3dv3el,RunnitBack,6,Mon Jul 20 05:25:16 2015 UTC,Canaan and Holmes > KJ....and cheaper
sixers,3dv3el,fuji700,2,Sun Jul 19 21:03:31 2015 UTC,"IDK consider all the picks/players coming in over the next few years. Then consider all the players on the roster that look to max their potential out as role players.  I would rather have the superior prospect, with more range to grow. In a vacuum you would probably be right, but not in the Sixers' current situation.   His contract is affordable, Sixers are below the cap floor, & Hinkie would still have room plenty of room for cap dumps."
sixers,3dv3el,G-BreadMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:19:13 2015 UTC,yip
sixers,3dv3el,imDnY,3,Sun Jul 19 21:39:44 2015 UTC,"Hinkie probably figured that if KJ stayed getting minutes on the Sixers, he would command a bigger contract, and one that he wasn't comfortable matching. Morey had the luxury of keeping him on the bench -- not saying they totally intentionally buried him, but they were a contender with depth -- and knew that would likely lower the amount of the offer sheets to an acceptable amount. Everyone kind of wins:   Hinkie gets Canaan and Holmes while escaping conundrum of overpaying KJ or letting him walk for nothing Morey gets a young player with potential at a reasonable price KJ gets paid a lot more than he would have in Philly, even if his value was a bit depressed by the trade"
sixers,3dv3el,lilgodboy,3,Mon Jul 20 00:07:01 2015 UTC,"Hinkie probably figured that if KJ stayed getting minutes on the Sixers, he would command a bigger contract   KJ's value was plummeting about a month or 2 before the deadline so that isn't it.  He was in a serious funk so I think it was more of how much he liked Canaan (and the pick too) and how we needed to replace MCW."
sixers,3dv3el,Iputthescrewintuna,2,Mon Jul 20 03:57:28 2015 UTC,"That's possible, but I definitely believe that KJ would have attracted a bigger offer if he was playing 28 minutes in Philly versus zero minutes in Houston."
sixers,3dv3el,lilgodboy,5,Mon Jul 20 07:25:58 2015 UTC,This is actually a fairly good deal but as I've always said I'd rather have the flexibility of the hinkie special than overpaying on a 2nd rounder.
sixers,3dv3el,eagsrock20,5,Sun Jul 19 19:49:23 2015 UTC,This deal doesn't hurt felxibility in any way. As someone else pointed out it's basically a late first rounder deal which is what he played like.
sixers,3dv3el,DramDemon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:05:22 2015 UTC,"It's is around $3M a year, which is about 4% of the salary cap. This deal is a bargain and does not take away flexibility."
sixers,3dv3el,jjohn268,-6,Mon Jul 20 02:19:55 2015 UTC,Overpay? lol have fun with your your championship roster
sixers,3dv3el,speedy100,2,Sun Jul 19 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"For everyone losing their mind over this: KJ could have made a Jeremy Lin-type $42 million had he stayed around. He probably wouldn't, but any contract offered would jump in 3 years - when we need to sign Nerlens et al.  Houston was able to grab him and essentially stash him, thus lowering his trade value. Sixers gave him big minutes. Big minutes = big stats = more money.  Yes, Grant needs to do something this year. But remember we are keeping cap room to sign two big-name free agents along with our draft picks. Would you spend that on KJ?"
sixers,3dv3el,snausages21,2,Mon Jul 20 09:54:23 2015 UTC,Easily Hinke's biggest miss so far besides Embiid.
sixers,3dv3el,scurvy_durvy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:34 2015 UTC,You think drafting Embiid was a mistake?
sixers,3dv3el,Zeus_Wayne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:39:20 2015 UTC,"Not a mistake, but a miss none the less."
sixers,3dv3el,starving_musician,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:49:49 2015 UTC,"I think taking a risk on a guy with a proven injury history was a big mistake as is born out by the fact that he won't have played in his first two years, and who knows what he will be able to do. There were other players that were much sure bets.   Could have had Marcus Smart, or Aarons Gordon. Guys who will actually contribute."
sixers,3dv3el,scurvy_durvy,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:16 2015 UTC,"Harden, Ariza, Brewer, Thornton, Dekker... do they play him over Dekker? It's solid depth nonetheless."
sixers,3dv3el,imDnY,3,Sun Jul 19 21:41:52 2015 UTC,"KJ most likely will be a future trade piece.  He doesn't crack that rotation without injuries.  Lawson, spanish dude, and Bev will be small balling it too a lot so KJ still on bench."

sixers,3dvjm1,sportfan73,5,Sun Jul 19 21:58:23 2015 UTC,Something about him made me think Paul Millsap. We could only be so lucky.
sixers,3dvjm1,CrunchyKorm,3,Mon Jul 20 00:56:19 2015 UTC,"I genuinely like Holmes. I'm not sure how much playing time he'll get ahead of Thompson/Landry if they're on the team, but I hope he gets a decent crack this season."
sixers,3dvjm1,sportfan73,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:44:37 2015 UTC,"I think we cut Landry, showcase Thompson as first big off the bench until asb and then move him and a 2nd for a future first due to his favorable contract next year. Holmes to me is 2nd big off of bench until Thompson is moved or just takes his spot by asb."
sixers,3dvjm1,AttractiveandRich,7,Mon Jul 20 01:48:41 2015 UTC,lol you aren't getting a future first for Thompson. Don't you think the Kings would have done that??
sixers,3dvjm1,davidcroda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:48 2015 UTC,"Why would the sixers play those guys? The whole point is to develop young talent. We got them as a salary dump, not because we think they are part of the team of the future."
sixers,3dvjm1,CrunchyKorm,2,Mon Jul 20 13:25:48 2015 UTC,"I'm speculating, I'm not making guarantees. I wrote ""if they're on the team"" as well.  We can point out the youth development, but the team did play J. Rich last year when he returned. There are exceptions to the rule."
sixers,3dvjm1,eagsrock20,2,Mon Jul 20 18:33:17 2015 UTC,That's great news if he doesn't need surgery I'm really excited for him to see him play he's one of the few players in the front court that can stretch the floor. Not only that but I think he can work well with okafor because he was a good rim protector in college but stretches the floor on offense to provide some spacing for okafor.
sixers,3dvjm1,Elricked,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:37:13 2015 UTC,All I know is Richaun Holmes has me feeling some type of way
sixers,3dvjm1,vayuu,-1,Mon Jul 20 10:51:33 2015 UTC,"looks like a shitty terrance jones to me, but i suppose you have take crack at him with the hinkie special"
sixers,3dvjm1,sportfan73,4,Sun Jul 19 22:26:50 2015 UTC,Much better defensive potential.
sixers,3dvjm1,Jahlol,2,Sun Jul 19 22:41:11 2015 UTC,"terrence jones isnt a bad comp, but holmes projects as a much better shooter"
sixers,3dvjm1,sportfan73,2,Mon Jul 20 00:01:29 2015 UTC,Poor man's ibaka is a much better one
sixers,3dvjm1,sportfan73,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:32:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know enough about Terrence Jones's strengths to make a very informed comment but I know that Rich Homie projects as a much better shotblocker and floor spacer right now. Also if he becomes as good as Terrence Jones, while not the best outcome in the world, is still terrific value out of a 2nd rounder, and definitely alleviates the blow of losing KJ. Also the Hinkie specials offer terrific value and flexibility moving forward"
sixers,3dvjm1,rahbee33,0,Mon Jul 20 04:56:57 2015 UTC,I also truly believe if anyone on this team can force a nerlens trade this year it is Holmes. Not saying he will be a better player at all. But if he proves to be a rim protector  AND be able to stretch the floor from the 4 then I think hinkie would pull the trigger on nerlens for a young star. All bets are off if nerlens comes back with a mid range game of course.
sixers,3dvjm1,sportfan73,10,Sun Jul 19 23:43:42 2015 UTC,"There is no way that Holmes could make Nerlens expendable in any universe.  I like Holmes, but you don't trade a guy of Nerlens' defensive prowess because a 2nd rounder can adequately do similar things."
sixers,3dvjm1,rahbee33,0,Mon Jul 20 01:04:11 2015 UTC,Don't remember nerlens being able to shoot 3s or stretch the floor at all. It's not about him being better it's about him being a much better fit and the high return for nerlens
sixers,3dvjm1,sportfan73,6,Mon Jul 20 01:09:20 2015 UTC,Nerlens was top 10 in steals and blocks last year. You don't trade that guy because another guy rebounds well and can hit the 3 at an average clip.
sixers,3dvjm1,RIPSweetPrince,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:18:15 2015 UTC,So you see noel and okafor fitting next to each other then?
sixers,3dvjm1,sportfan73,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:21:10 2015 UTC,It wouldn't be impossible for either of them to develop a jumpshot. Nerlens is entering his 3rd NBA year(2nd playing.) and Jahlil hasn't even started his first.
sixers,3dvjm1,rahbee33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:38:00 2015 UTC,How about I put it this way. Holmes displays that as a rookie he is a competent rim protector and can stretch it to the 3 point line. Nerlens shows out on d again and say WAS decides that Beal and wall are redundant  and gortat shows age. Nerlens for Beal on an extention.
sixers,3dvjm1,ImJustAMan,3,Mon Jul 20 02:00:30 2015 UTC,As a rookie? He played in like 3 Summer League games.  He hasn't shown anything. Certainly not enough to warrant trading a piece like Nelerns.
sixers,3dzrab,SteveWynn,11,Mon Jul 20 21:13:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you want to shatter his bone beyond repair, then yeah."

sixers,3dxv9z,SteveWynn,20,Mon Jul 20 12:51:15 2015 UTC,Seems really strange if true - why has he been walking around without a boot if he has broken foot right now?
sixers,3dxv9z,zigzagzil,11,Mon Jul 20 13:11:29 2015 UTC,"These things are super tricky.  Hence, I don't necessarily believe the Sixers lied about anything.  Years ago, before CT Scans, stress fractures were basically undetectable.  They don't show on x-rays because the ""break"" in the bone is not a clean break like you see when snapping a pencil in half.  Think of it more like bending a pencil until you barely hear the very first sound of cracking - and then stop.  The pencil looks fine.  There is a very tiny crack in there somewhere, but it has closed up again and you can't see it.  That's my ELI5 understanding of stress fractures.  Doug Collins and Andrew Toney were the subject of much scepticzim when they complained of foot pain with no apparent cause, and they both played for a while on ""broken"" feet.  They didn't just walk around with stress fratures - they tried playing.  If pencils healed, you can imagine it would be unwise to bend the pencil until the healing finished.  That said, if you bent it when the healing was 75% done, and you destroyed some of the healing, it might be very difficult to say if you ""re-broke"" the pencil or if it was just healing more slowly than anticipated.  I've always had the impression that these things are very hard to see.  Indeed, I've heard that it is easier to see the healing process than it is to see the fracture itself."
sixers,3dxv9z,chipsvisor,4,Mon Jul 20 15:34:53 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt that there's some nuance to this that we're missing. But it seems like the Sixers have generally been quick to be very conservative with this injury - and now they're allowing him to walk around (for a month?) with a re-broken foot?   It's just generally odd - when he had the original break discovered prior to the draft, surgery happened relatively quickly afterward."

Most I can say about Robinson III is from his Michigan days. He seemed like a potential lottery pick before his last season (13-14) at school but dropped to the 2nd round after a not-amazing season (Philly passed him twice at #32 and #39).

sixers,3dqzhm,DariosDentist,14,Sat Jul 18 16:56:00 2015 UTC,"Don't love this, but I trust Hinkie"
sixers,3dqzhm,fuji700,18,Sat Jul 18 17:26:07 2015 UTC,He's probably been our best guard in SL.
sixers,3dqzhm,chukinthebuket,6,Sat Jul 18 16:58:44 2015 UTC,I just don't know what he's going to do when his Jumper isn't dropping. Doesn't even have the PG or Defensive skills that Pappy Jack has. Just my $.02
sixers,3dqzhm,fuji700,12,Sat Jul 18 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all. He just had a game against the Celtics SL where he made Kazemi look good on offense - that takes playmaking. Haha. I think he's a pesky defender who gets steals & has 5"" on PJ.   I know Pierre depends on his athleticism and was playing through an injury last week so I'll reserve too much judgement but Wilbekin outplayed him on both ends of the floor in Vegas."
sixers,3dqzhm,DariosDentist,4,Sat Jul 18 17:05:56 2015 UTC,He dribbles too goddamn much.
sixers,3dqzhm,xychosis,2,Sat Jul 18 17:12:20 2015 UTC,My biggest complaint as well.   He never seems to go anywhere. McConnell usually gets right to that free throw line spot where he can dish or shoot that jumper. Wilbekin goes East/West not North/South and never gets anywhere.   Canaan was very similar though.
sixers,3dqzhm,rahbee33,2,Sat Jul 18 18:10:21 2015 UTC,"He gives me flashbacks of Evan Turner when he does that. Tries to dance around defenders and when he can't, doesn't even bother to at least make a pass, just chucks up a three late in the shot clock"
sixers,3dqzhm,xychosis,3,Sat Jul 18 20:04:40 2015 UTC,"Agree with you completely, it's cool the guy was able to play well enough to get that check but I'm not really a fan of his game at all."
sixers,3dqzhm,Phogify,0,Sun Jul 19 05:28:24 2015 UTC,"He's clearly not a PG, he's a wing player.  He was ATROCIOUS last year in SL, had no redeemable qualities.  He came back this year and now has a shot and a better handle.  If he can play adequate D and hit a 3 consistently at the NBA level, he'll have a decent career as a bench player."
sixers,3dqzhm,chukinthebuket,3,Sat Jul 18 17:40:26 2015 UTC,I just look at him like a lesser Canaan
sixers,3dqzhm,fuji700,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:09:10 2015 UTC,"I think he's a better Canaan if he can at least shoot 38%.  Wilbekin has the size advantage and if he ever improves, will be less of a liability on defense.  Canaan's size pretty much relegates him to being a PG who can't really dribble, drive, facilitate, or play defense.  He's also a turnover machine."
sixers,3dqzhm,chukinthebuket,3,Sat Jul 18 17:39:06 2015 UTC,"I'm indifferent towards this move. He's a low upside guy who likely will not be on this roster next year. But who would you replace him with? Just another unproven, below average player."
sixers,3dqzhm,jjohn268,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:57:02 2015 UTC,It's not like this means he's a guarantee to be on the NBA squad in the fall. The team is spending such little money at this point that it's a non-factor if he's not good enough.
sixers,3dqzhm,CrunchyKorm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:10:58 2015 UTC,I mean it low risk high reward. Not like hes going to be taking the spot from some great player. If he sucks whatever if hes good we found a solid bench player for the future.

sixers,3dqzhm,TEDDYBRUCKSHOT,3,Sat Jul 18 19:11:56 2015 UTC,"Good for you guys, liked watching him play in college and this SL."
sixers,3dqzhm,AndrewFlash,5,Sat Jul 18 17:35:01 2015 UTC,"Sixers are going to bring 20 guys into training camp, just like they always do. That's all these contracts mean. Wilbekin and McConnell may have a chance to make the team, but will probably be cut and allocated to Delaware. Sixers signed Roberts and Gordon to these type of deals last year."
sixers,3dqzhm,lilgodboy,5,Sat Jul 18 19:30:33 2015 UTC,Training camp contracts are different. This isn't a training camp deal.
sixers,3dqzhm,jjohn268,2,Sat Jul 18 17:21:08 2015 UTC,"It doesn't sound any different than the 3-year, partially guaranteed deal the Sixers gave Roberts last season (before cutting him and allocating him to Delaware), but I don't know the specifics."
sixers,3dqzhm,lilgodboy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:36:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Roberts, but I'm pretty sure we saw Gordon on the actual NBA roster."
sixers,3dqzhm,jjohn268,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:56:39 2015 UTC,"He came up later and people said he was ""recalled,"" but it was after signing another multi-year deal. The guys who are allocated to a D-League team are free agents and not under contract, having been cut after training camp.   A few guys with contracts just like Wilbekin, McConnell and Jackson are going to get cut when the roster size is winnowed down from 20 to 15. Others who were drafted and remain unsigned, like Tokoto and McCrae, will get stashed.  Edit: I can't remember if guys need a contract to be in training camp (so maybe Tokoto wouldn't be there, for example)."
sixers,3dqzhm,lilgodboy,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:24:02 2015 UTC,lmao @ someone downvoting this
sixers,3dqzhm,lilgodboy,2,Sat Jul 18 18:38:20 2015 UTC,"Wroten, Canaan, Jackson, McConnell, and now Scottie. I'm guessing we cut McConnell and trade either Wroten or Canaan?"
sixers,3dqzhm,McHandsome,7,Sat Jul 18 19:58:23 2015 UTC,Wroten has no trade value. He's still rehabbing.
sixers,3dqzhm,jjohn268,3,Sat Jul 18 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"Unfortunate, Wroten is still super young and has shown to be a legitimate NBA player, but I don't want him starting. Wish we brought back Ish, hell we still could but I really doubt we do now."
sixers,3dqzhm,McHandsome,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:01:47 2015 UTC,I wasn't impressed with Canaan at all last year. Wish we still had McDaniels.
sixers,3dqzhm,dab2525,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:34:02 2015 UTC,"Well McDaniels is a FA this year and likely would've gotten a decent paycheck to go elsewhere. The trade to the Rockets really tanked his value cause he got virtually no PT over there. Canaan is at least team controlled, young, and a shooter. I believe we also got pick 37, which resulted in Richaun Holmes, who showed some good potential in the Summer league. Add to the fact that Jerami Grant stepped into his role pretty seamlessly, and the trade looks pretty good in hindsight imo."
sixers,3dqzhm,McHandsome,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"NetsDaily is complaining about the Hinkie Special and our ""signing"" of TRob in the replies lol. What's new?"
sixers,3dqzhm,jjpoole7,4,Sun Jul 19 04:10:33 2015 UTC,"The guy that runs that twitter is a fucking idiot. Every time he gets made fun of for one of his stupid, petty rants about the Sixers, he acts like they were a sarcastic performance art piece or some shit."
sixers,3dqzhm,ThaOneNOnly,3,Sat Jul 18 17:15:58 2015 UTC,What exactly is the Hinkie Special? Is it like 1 year with little cap hit?
sixers,3dqzhm,Shieldz123,4,Sat Jul 18 19:11:19 2015 UTC,"A four-year contract that includes two non-guaranteed years and low cap hits. I assume that's what Wilbekin's four-year deal is.   Hollis, Covington, Grant, JaKarr, McConnell, Pierre, and a bunch of guys that have since been traded/cut have received similar contracts (basically all 2nd round picks and the undrafted guys), so it has come to be known as the Hinkie Special."
sixers,3dqzhm,jjpoole7,3,Sat Jul 18 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"What I don't get isn't just the fact that other teams do this, but it's not like Wilbekin or Jackson are vets or 1st rounders - they're fringe NBA talents. How is signing a fringe NBA player to any contract a bad thing for them?"
sixers,3dqzhm,CrunchyKorm,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"PG: Isaiah Canaan, Pierre Jackson, T.J. McConnell, Tony Wroten  SG: Nik Stauskas, Hollis Thompson, Scottie Wilbekin   SF: Robert Covington, Jerami Grant, JaKarr Sampson  PF: Nerlens Noel, Jason Thompson, Richaun Holmes, Carl Landry  C: Jahlil Okafor, Furkan Aldemir, Joel Embiid  This is 17 people. Who are we getting rid of before the season starts?"
sixers,3dqzhm,marwels23,2,Sat Jul 18 20:20:21 2015 UTC,I say Canaan and Landry if we need to trim the roster down to 15.
sixers,3dqzhm,xychosis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:52:00 2015 UTC,There's no IR in the nba to stash embiid?
sixers,3dqzhm,ihorsey,2,Sun Jul 19 05:30:33 2015 UTC,NBA did away with IR spots a few years ago and just added an additional roster spot I believe
sixers,3dqzhm,Hogwarts_Bukkake,2,Sat Jul 18 18:55:21 2015 UTC,Huh. That seems really dumb.
sixers,3dqzhm,ihorsey,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"I would say definitely Landry, probably Thompson and TJ, and maybe Canaan and Jakarr."
sixers,3dqzhm,Joseph609,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:57:16 2015 UTC,IMO McConnell and either Landry or Holmes.  Maybe both with Kazemi sticking.  Played OK in SL.
sixers,3dqzhm,Xo0om,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:36:38 2015 UTC,"We're running out of roster spots. We got 3 from the Stauskas trade, Pierre signing, and now Scottie. Signed Okafor and presumably Holmes. Assuming LRMAM, J-Rich, Henry Sims, Glenn Robinson, T-Rob, and Canaan are out, we would still need to drop 1 more player. I guess thats Ish."
sixers,3dqzhm,MongolianDynamite,2,Sat Jul 18 19:46:41 2015 UTC,"You're confusing Canaan and Ish. The former is under contract, the latter is a free agent and not on the Sixers."
sixers,3dqzhm,lilgodboy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:37:55 2015 UTC,O right so we don't re-sign Ish and release Canaan?
sixers,3dqzhm,MongolianDynamite,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"Seems unlikely since Canaan is younger, better (in general) and has a guaranteed contract for next season."
sixers,3dqzhm,lilgodboy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:27:21 2015 UTC,No what I am saying is we might have to not re-sign Ish and also release Canaan since we have so many new players getting added to the roster.
sixers,3dqzhm,MongolianDynamite,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:14:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's unlikely that Canaan gets released, considering they just guaranteed his contract for next season and he's only played with the team for 30 games, but maybe."

sixers,3dqzhm,danielsilva12345,5,Sun Jul 19 13:55:21 2015 UTC,"Damn do people forget how promising Jakarr looked once he got consistent minutes last season?  He is versatile and one of our few players who can put ball on floor and make something happen.  Grant , Covington, and Hollis can't do the things Jakarr can.    I'd be shocked if he got cut."
sixers,3dqzhm,Iputthescrewintuna,2,Sat Jul 18 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Jakarr is only 22. People have such short memories around here."
sixers,3dqzhm,McHandsome,-1,Sat Jul 18 21:39:34 2015 UTC,Okay.
sixers,3ds1iq,sixersnba,2,Sat Jul 18 22:20:10 2015 UTC,"Agree with these. It's nice to see Kazemi hustle well and bring intangibles, tough to see him actually made the club though. Grant looked stronger (literally) even if all his shots weren't falling and Jakarr's form looks different and less awkward, plus that last game dominance is always nice.  As for Okafor I was neither overwhelmed or underwhelmed. Some inefficient games that could be look effecient with better ft shooting, but his poise was phenomenal when he had the ball and didn't look to awful on defense."
sixers,3ds1iq,choose_uh_username,2,Sun Jul 19 01:04:38 2015 UTC,He won't make the team but it would be interesting to see what he could bring back in a trade.  Teams short on front court depth or maybe dealing with injuries could have a need for the Iranian Reggie Evans with a high BBall IQ.  Some of his passes were dazzling around the rim and he has good hands when he is on the receiving end of wrap around dishes.

sixers,3ds1iq,JuveSoCal__S,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:31:43 2015 UTC,"Was somewhat disappointed with the relatively low efficiency from Jah, but I loved watching him unveil his repertoire in the post. When things open up for him, he'll probably bump his FG% a few ticks, especially if he can continue developing his faceup game."
sixers,3ds1iq,xychosis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:00:47 2015 UTC,"He did miss some really easy looks, but take away that he put himself in position to have those easy looks"
sixers,3drey9,torah_sam,15,Sat Jul 18 18:59:39 2015 UTC,I have yet to see him be out-hustled.
sixers,3drey9,ThaOneNOnly,9,Sat Jul 18 19:12:12 2015 UTC,"I like Kazemi and think he has an interesting story. It seems to me his strengths are shared by other players and he has too may shortcomings to make the team. I wouldn't mind seeing him make some hustle plays and dunks coming off the bench for Sixers, or any team for that matter. He's also the only player associated with the team who I'd go gay for."
sixers,3drey9,FleetwoodMatt,2,Sat Jul 18 19:24:46 2015 UTC,He looks like he's extremely scared of scoring. I see him pass out of open lanes all the time
sixers,3drey9,SongofVictory,2,Sat Jul 18 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"Its hard for Kazemi to show his true value in the summer league. Hes a team player and a coach's player; fans wont like him until hes a regular on the team and then they see his value. His basketball IQ is high and in a summed league where everyone is fighting for a spot it was hard for him to show his true value. Too many new players that dont know each other. I think whichever team signs him they will do great. He is the glue to the team, does dirty work and can do double doubles all the time. Hes the reason OREGON went to sweet 16 and they lost to eventual champions. Not too bad."
sixers,3drey9,JuveSoCal__S,2,Sat Jul 18 19:45:57 2015 UTC,What do ypu think of his defense? From what I've seen he seems lost. A lot better offensively. If he gets more aware on the defensive end i think he'd be great.  He has nice footwork i think
sixers,3drey9,JuveSoCal__S,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:33:18 2015 UTC,"i didnt think he was lost, if he did so did others at some points as well, because its a new team and no one knows each other. So its natural if they are not in sync.  Otherwise his steals, blocks, rebounds, hustles are all considered good defense. not to mention half the time he's guarding bigger players.  He would do good in sixers but for his sake i think its best if they trade him so he can shine somewhere else. we already have enough big men on this team."
sixers,3drey9,insanedreamer_,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:36 2015 UTC,"The new team might be the reason he seemed a little lost. He looks like he can be a good help defender but not a savant by any means. Id love to see him coming off the bench somewhere olaying 12-16 min and being a good hustle guy. His passing was really great though,  really enjoyed it"
sixers,3drey9,CrunchyKorm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:05 2015 UTC,From what i've seen the dude absolutely knows how to take a charge.
sixers,3drvdp,danielsilva12345,24,Sat Jul 18 21:23:39 2015 UTC,Seriously? Of course he should.
sixers,3drvdp,neutropills,7,Sat Jul 18 21:25:39 2015 UTC,Agreed. This dude is one year removed from being an under the basket before and he has shown the ability to attack the rim and shoot threes in the NBA last season and it looks like he has improved at both judging off his SL play.   Poor game one excluded.
sixers,3drvdp,andhily,9,Sat Jul 18 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"Why is this a debate? he was our 3rd best player last year after Noel and Covington. Toward the end of the year I'd even argue he was more valuable than Covington. Literally played 3 positions for us throughout the year and showed he can somewhat be a primary ballhandler and was even our pimary scoring option when Noel sat out at the end of the year.   And to think, at the beginning of the year I was livid he was making the roster while we cut dudes like Ronald Roberts (lol). But JaKarr was literally that bad to start the year, easily the worst player on our team. So to think he developed enough throughout the year that he was one of the best is insane, and shows his potential. Yes he should make the roster. Versatile defensive wing with 3&D potential."
sixers,3drvdp,HeJind,5,Sun Jul 19 02:30:27 2015 UTC,"Obviously.   He's only 22, an athletic freak, on a great contract, and did some nice things as a rookie. This penchant for making snap judgments on whether a player is presently ""good"" is really silly considering that's not the Sixers' organizational emphasis at the moment. It's about upside and improvement."
sixers,3drvdp,lilgodboy,10,Sun Jul 19 00:14:49 2015 UTC,"Sampson isn't good, but neither is half our players. Unlike guys like Mcrae, Sampson can at least give you the versatility to play multiple positions."
sixers,3drvdp,jjohn268,10,Sat Jul 18 21:36:15 2015 UTC,Everyone is so young. It's hard to say who is good yet and who isn't.
sixers,3drvdp,10_9_8_76ers,4,Sat Jul 18 23:17:26 2015 UTC,He's got all the makings of a good 3 and D player. Look at what Carroll just got paid in Toronto. They are very valuable guys and the Sixers have one on the cheap.
sixers,3drvdp,rahbee33,7,Sat Jul 18 22:52:08 2015 UTC,he shot 24% from 3...
sixers,3drvdp,vayuu,10,Sat Jul 18 23:26:46 2015 UTC,.286 for carrol the season before he joined the hawks and he was 26. Jakarr has time and room to improve
sixers,3drvdp,rahbee33,5,Sun Jul 19 00:49:45 2015 UTC,Yeah and it looked much better in summer league regardless of what he made.   All I'm saying is that he's got a ton of upside and I'd like to see him get better.
sixers,3drvdp,fuji700,4,Sat Jul 18 23:37:04 2015 UTC,An Easy Yes. Dude has potential and currently has versatility.
sixers,3drvdp,Gillezeau,4,Sat Jul 18 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"If this was based off basketball alone, then yes. But add the fact that he has puts in 110% effort and is a good chemistry guy, he a complete lock. This season at least"
sixers,3drvdp,thedealerkuo,3,Sun Jul 19 02:37:42 2015 UTC,i sure hope so.  he had a positive defensive win share last year which is pretty amazing considering how raw he was coming in. i think he finished out the year well and showed he was an nba player.  he has the athleticism and defensive ability to stay in the league.  if he can consistently make a corner 3 then he will definitely stick.
sixers,3drvdp,xychosis,2,Sun Jul 19 01:01:27 2015 UTC,"Not sure why this should even be a debate. JaKarr's athletic, and improving. If he was still the JaKarr we saw at the start of last year, then hell no, but he's made massive strides forward."
sixers,3drvdp,J4BRONI,2,Sun Jul 19 12:53:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly no, I think we are gonna look back in the future and laugh about this, I dont think Jakaar is that good"
sixers,3drvdp,Xo0om,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:00:58 2015 UTC,"Until we get some people that are better or have more upside, then yes.    I'm not as sold on how much of a beast this guy is as some in this forum are. IMO what we saw last year is about how far he's going to go, but that's not bad...coming off the bench. He can't be starting this year, other than the occasional fill in."

sixers,3dnsi3,JoelStampiid,-6,Sat Jul 18 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"you serious? 43% is horrendous for a player that shoots everything around the rim. thats absurd of you to say. given the kinds of shots okafor takes it is absolutely terrible, makes it even worse knowing his free throw percentage is worse than that."
sixers,3dnsi3,FortyPlusTwo,5,Sat Jul 18 01:42:29 2015 UTC,"Dude chill out haha. He's a rookie in god damned summer league and was pretty much the only legitimate offensive threat for his team. He made good moves and took decent shots, some of them just didn't fall. Is 43% good? No, not really, but it's not like he hasn't ""done shit"". He did fine, and I'm highly optimistic for the season and the future."
sixers,3dnsi3,deadnside,-6,Sat Jul 18 01:57:21 2015 UTC,not saying you shouldnt be optimistic but you are acting like 43% for him is just not good. its awful. Shooting in the low 40s in the summer league was the worst case scenario for him. does that mean hes a bust? no. but you cant deny that its awful and that he underperformed offensively
sixers,3dnsi3,FortyPlusTwo,3,Sat Jul 18 02:02:46 2015 UTC,"It's really not awful. Did you watch the games at all? It's why I'm not panicking. He looked very good, some of his shots just didn't fall. I'm really not that invested in summer league statistics"
sixers,3dnsi3,JoelStampiid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:52:46 2015 UTC,Obviously he didn't as Okafor looked pretty damn good - but he does need to get that FT% up.
sixers,3dnsi3,FortyPlusTwo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:46:28 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll admit his free throw shooting was horrid
sixers,3dnsi3,LeM1stre,-1,Sat Jul 18 04:47:37 2015 UTC,"It is awful, there's no way around it but 43% is terrible for someone that shoots everything in the paint. He made some good moves which tells us he could be good in the future but he isnt very good right now. Seemed like he turned it over or got his shit stuffed in the post more often than he actually score there."
sixers,3dnsi3,skOzy,2,Sat Jul 18 17:45:16 2015 UTC,Alright well I'm gonna go ahead and say he wins RoTY. I'll bet a flair on it.

sixers,3do9sb,southerngangster,21,Fri Jul 17 22:05:21 2015 UTC,"I understand that people might not like me saying this but I am continually unimpressed by Pierre Jackson. I understand its just summer league but his size has killed him every game. He can't get his shot off and if you are that small you need elite separation skills like Isaiah Thomas and he just doesn't have that yet. He can't get his shot off consistently and he is not that good of a point guard, having 6 turnovers today. NBA level defenders are going to kill him and he is way to small to effectively guard any of the top NBA point guards. The regular season is a long ways away but I really don't like that we gave him a guaranteed contract. Please somebody tell me his NBA skill, because at 5'8 he better be damn good offensively and he hasn't shown me that at all."
sixers,3do9sb,Slim91292,2,Fri Jul 17 22:27:41 2015 UTC,Has anyone ever fully recovered from an Achilles injury?  Especially for a guy that relies on athleticism... that is a horrible injury.  Hopefully he can prove us wrong and make a strong comeback but I don't see it sadly.
sixers,3do9sb,ChickenLiverNuts,2,Fri Jul 17 22:49:34 2015 UTC,Not sure about basketball but in football it seems like you need a year after recovery before you're back to normal
sixers,3do9sb,PhromDaPharcyde,2,Fri Jul 17 23:44:55 2015 UTC,"Of the recent tears besides last season:  Kobe- Hasn't played at pre-injury level since Achilles tear, but that's probably not the only factor in his lower level of play  Elton Brand- Wasn't the same player (easily 20-10 player for Bulls/Clips) after the injury but still was serviceable  Jeff Taylor- Was a pretty bad player after the injury.  Then again he was a pretty bad player before the injury too  Chauncey Billups- Career was essentially ended by Achilles tear.  Played his final season in Detroit and didn't play well in any of it.  So yeah, not a very optimistic prognosis.  However, there are a few cases of players like Dominique Wilkins, who thrived after their injury, but for every Dominique Wilkins there's four or five Isiah Thomases"
sixers,3do9sb,QwertyBuffalo,3,Sat Jul 18 01:50:52 2015 UTC,I agree completely man.  I love his story and im happy he got a Hinkie special but if he makes the team our PG situation is more fucked than i thought
sixers,3do9sb,ChickenLiverNuts,3,Sat Jul 18 04:11:19 2015 UTC,Him and Mcrae are pretty overhyped around here. I doubt Mcrae even makes the roster. Jackson is going to get maybe 10 minutes a game unless injuries happen and the minutes open up.
sixers,3do9sb,jjohn268,8,Fri Jul 17 23:16:05 2015 UTC,Mcrae was hyped up because he did great in the summer league last year. He averaged 21 points on 50% shooting and 37.5% from 3.

sixers,3do9sb,fuji700,8,Fri Jul 17 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"You get 15 players:  Okafor, Noel, Covington, Grant, Sampson, Hollis Thompson, Aldemir, Embiid, Wroten, Jackson (newly signed) and Stauskas all make it. Thats 11 contracts.   Jason Thompson and Landry are both under contract as of now. So that leaves 2 roster openings. I know people aren't too high on Canaan, but I doubt they give up on him so quick. So 1 roster spot left.   IMO, Richaun Holmes, even though he is injured, will get that last spot. I also think they might waive Landry for McConnell, Ish Smith or another PG via trade.   Tokoto goes to the DLeague or overseas."

sixers,3do9sb,RoboticParadox,2,Sat Jul 18 01:12:15 2015 UTC,I agree.  I wasn't sold on him at first but that shooting... He definitely deserves a spot on our roster over Canaan or Jackson.
sixers,3do9sb,chukinthebuket,2,Sat Jul 18 01:23:37 2015 UTC,"I think we're on the same page for the 15 man roster. I would just say McRae will make it. To nitpick, I would say Canaan and Holmes are semi-safe too."
sixers,3do9sb,fuji700,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:43:07 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to why Canaan wasn't in Summer League.   I don't think he's that safe. In fact I think he's the most expendable one on the roster.
sixers,3do9sb,rahbee33,3,Sat Jul 18 02:18:10 2015 UTC,He just got a 200K bonus for being on the roster past last Thursday...that's why I think he's safe. And also because he's a 38% 3pt shooter who can play pg (not saying he doesn't have his flaws).
sixers,3do9sb,fuji700,2,Sat Jul 18 04:06:26 2015 UTC,"Aside from the 3pt shooting, he has nothing BUT flaws."
sixers,3do9sb,chukinthebuket,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:04:34 2015 UTC,I forgot about the bonus.   I just think he is more of a SG than a PG and we have a pretty decent crop of wings to play that spot that are bigger and better defenders.   I wouldn't be surprised if he's on the teM though.
sixers,3do9sb,rahbee33,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:44:34 2015 UTC,"Exact same for me, I'm giving him a pass for now because he's coming off a terrible injury but he has to step it up in the regular season."

sixers,3do9sb,lilgodboy,4,Fri Jul 17 23:47:40 2015 UTC,"JaKarr's 3-pt shot has been spotty in preseason, but it does sound like he really worked on it (along with adding weight, which is visible). Great to see him knock down a few today.   Like Wroten, he's another guy with great athletic gifts whose roadmap to efficient scoring will rely on improving catch-and-shoot threes and free throws. Optimistically, those seem like skills that repetition in the gym can upgrade. Last season, JaKarr shot 52% from 2-pt range and had a solid FTr, which are good signs."

sixers,3dnm4f,rahbee33,7,Fri Jul 17 19:03:50 2015 UTC,I've been looking at the Sixers shot selection from last year a lot trying to figure out how/why Stauskas is going to fit in so well and I found this little gem. He shot better than guys like Korver and JJ Redick and just about as good as Klay Thompson. It was a decent sample size too at 53-110.  If Hollis gets off to a good start and is consistent for most of the year he'll likely be among the best 3 point shooters in the league. I have a feeling he's going to turn a lot of heads - although I said exactly that this time last year.
sixers,3dnm4f,OnAWhale,7,Fri Jul 17 19:06:29 2015 UTC,No change of release and (hopefully) no respiratory infection this year. I think he's gonna break out big time this year
sixers,3dnm4f,andhily,2,Fri Jul 17 21:35:38 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised to see him shipped to a contender around the deadline if he keeps up his post ASB play. He's still relatively young and on the Hinkie special I could see him fitting in real well with some of the teams out West.   Also he's the oldest out of himself, Stauskas, and Covington so that makes him most likely to be moved, imo."
sixers,3dnm4f,andhily,10,Fri Jul 17 20:48:28 2015 UTC,I disagree.   They have him under contract for pennies the next two years. Him and RoCo are steals on those contracts and I think they'll both be here for awhile.   It'd have to be for something pretty good.
sixers,3dnm4f,andhily,3,Fri Jul 17 21:08:46 2015 UTC,Yeah his contract and the fact this his production is so much more valuable than his contract is what makes him an attractive piece for other teams.  I really wouldn't be surprised to see a team like Memphis or LAC trying to add him at the deadline.  Hollis is probably one of the most underrated players on our team and his 3&D ability would bolster any contenders bench.
sixers,3do8nt,ChickenLiverNuts,5,Fri Jul 17 21:56:11 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what team they are playing for, any player not currently under contract is fair game for any team. Usually though their agents give the team that gave them a chance at summer league first dibs."

sixers,3dl1np,Charles_Barkley_34,12,Fri Jul 17 03:20:14 2015 UTC,"Going 0-9 on midrange isn't disturbing, it's brilliant. Why would you want him taking more low-value shots? His three-point% and FT% are the problems.   If you take away his penchant for end of quarter heaves, he shot around 28% from three. That's bad, but a solid jump from 22% in 2014. Modest improvements to 30% from 3 and 75% from the line would make him somewhat close to league-average in efficiency (he doesn't need to be GREAT from either because of his ability to get to the rim). Hopefully he's spent his rehab in the gym."
sixers,3dl1np,lilgodboy,5,Fri Jul 17 03:28:53 2015 UTC,"Hell, if he improves his FT shooting alone and adds the ability to finish off-hand lay ups, his efficiency would soar"
sixers,3dl1np,xychosis,3,Fri Jul 17 04:51:21 2015 UTC,That would work. I think the reason I'm still fairly high on Wroten is that he's young and there are multiple avenues to him being a reasonably good offensive player. The fact that he's literally the best in the NBA at getting to the rim gives him some leeway. Pretty funny that Ish is second and MCW is fourth.
sixers,3dl1np,lilgodboy,4,Fri Jul 17 08:54:33 2015 UTC,"Wroten is scary good at attacking the rim. His handle's tight, he has a fast first step, I just wish he had an off-hand."

sixers,3dl1np,chukinthebuket,2,Fri Jul 17 16:46:58 2015 UTC,And MCW was just really long.  Hinkie has not been that secretive about wanting guys that get to the rim. That's why I'm a little surprised none of the PGs on the roster at the moment besides Wroten really do get to the rim. Jackson and Canaan are jump shooters and McConnell is more of a penetrate and look for the pass off the PnR.

In order, points off drives per 48, the top 10 is Wroten, Ish, Schroder, MCW (in MIL), Reggie Jackson, Teague, Harden, Westbrook, Isiah Thomas, LeBron. (MCW's overall season numbers would push him back to 10th)."

sixers,3dl1np,Hazard326,11,Fri Jul 17 15:48:45 2015 UTC,"Super athleticism that can't be taught.  Young and still improving.    Zero right hand.  Gets to the rim like a god but needs to finish better.  Using both hands wold help.  I recall unacceptable turnover issues as well.  A point guard that is reckless with the ball sets a bad tone for the team.  With Okafor and Noel in the game, we will have a hard time spreading the floor, which might make it harder for Wroten to attack the hoop, but he's so damn good at it that I think he will get there anyway.  I want to see better passes and more controlled layups.    Crazy, but I think Wroten could be a borderline star, or he could get cut.  A lot depends on his IQ and the maturation process.  Can he learn to use his talent efficiently?"

sixers,3dl1np,wonderbreadftw,-3,Fri Jul 17 12:22:26 2015 UTC,Russell because he's a better player.
sixers,3dl1np,chukinthebuket,3,Fri Jul 17 12:46:53 2015 UTC,Why?
sixers,3dl1np,throwaweight7,0,Fri Jul 17 15:35:44 2015 UTC,"Because if Wroten were a better player with a higher ceiling, he'd play better and probably be considered one of the top PGs in the NBA."
sixers,3dl1np,chukinthebuket,2,Fri Jul 17 17:13:47 2015 UTC,No I mean what do you think Russell does better?
sixers,3dl1np,throwaweight7,2,Fri Jul 17 18:23:48 2015 UTC,"well i mean right now he definitely passes, sees the floor, shoots and finishes with his off hand better than wroten. Wrotens ability to get to the rim, his athleticism and his experience are the only things we know he has to his advantage. I think wroten will still be the better player this year though."
sixers,3dl1np,The-Stev,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:34:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure Russell is a better passer, Tony averaged more assists in the NBA per game last season than Russell in college.

sixers,3dl1np,Lyndell,0,Fri Jul 17 19:51:42 2015 UTC,"That's fine, I just don't think Wroten is all that great.  He is amazing at getting to the rim but is one-hand dominant as people mentioned, isn't a good shooter (23.4% from 3 for his career), and I'm honestly not sure about his defense (really haven't seen him on that end of the floor so dunno if he's good or bad).  I think he's got the ceiling of a backup PG on a contending team.  EDIT:  It appears he's a pretty good defensive player, but not as good of an offensive player, which makes him a net negative."

sixers,3dl1np,zigzagzil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:04:48 2015 UTC,He has all the athletic tools to be good on defense. I hope that Brown can get him to not gamble quite as much and stop ball watching when he's in help defense.  I think both those things are easily correctable because they're more effort than anything else (see: James Harden). Now we just need him out on the court to see him do it.
sixers,3dl1np,rahbee33,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's not a fatal flaw for somebody with his tools. He is just such a horrendous off-ball defender right now (watching any tape of him last season, he gets burned on back-cut after back-cut) that he's pretty long way away (developmentally) from being an average defender.  Definitely not out on him as a real NBA player (his tools are way too good) I just don't see any ""star"" level talent in there."

sixers,3doti9,probotic,2,Sat Jul 18 21:24:19 2015 UTC,"I've watched Russell in every game in SL so these are my thoughts (haven't really watched Okafor so I can't comment on him):  Russell's play-style relies a lot on chemistry between him and the other players -- chemistry does not exist in SL. His assist stats might also be negatively skewed because the quality of his teammates in SL just isn't that high (how many open 3s are we bricking...?) His 3 has been short pretty much every time he shoots it, which just leads me to assume that he has to get used to the NBA range which will come with time. His pick and pop game is on point."
sixers,3doti9,iloveopenbar,4,Sat Jul 18 01:06:34 2015 UTC,"If his play-style relies on chemistry, I am really worried about how his season is going to go with players like SwaggyP, Lou Williams, and Kobe all being on the same team. Too many cooks in that kitchen."
sixers,3doti9,SteveWynn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:14:51 2015 UTC,"I think the only thing we can take away from Russell and SL is that he isn't ready to come out and be a sure-fire starter for the Lakers.  That can change once he starts working out with the other starters, but huge amounts of turn over and horrid shooting from the 3 isn't going to get it."

His D is what lacks and where Horford is much better. For this team I'd probably go with Horford because Vuc and Pau are really similar.   I think it's a little narrowminded to say that Horford is by far a better C than Vuc.   2014-15 stats  Vuc: 19.3 pts, 10.9 rbs, 52.3 FG%, 2 ast, .7 blk, 21.62 PER  Hor: 15.2 pts, 7.2 tbs, 52 FG%, 3.2 ast, 1.3 blk, 21.43 PER"

My original point stands, and that is they're virtually equal. Yes, Horford is better than Vuc at some things, and Vuc is better than Horford at some things. When comparing them overall it's basically a whitewash though.  To answer your question...I do think Vuc is better at offense. His offensive rebounding and his ability to play all over the offensive zone is more versatile than Horford's game."
sixers,3diwct,freewheelinCW,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:55:07 2015 UTC,"Horford's passing is what makes him at worst equal to Vucevic on offense, he is seriously one of the best passing bigs in the NBA. when you combine that with his defensive advantage there is basically no reason you should ever want Vucevic on your team over Horford if your goal is to win games."

sixers,3divv8,throwaweight7,14,Thu Jul 16 18:40:16 2015 UTC,"So doing some forecasting, if you will...  Noel gained 8 lbs of MUSCLE in one year, 215-223, which is what you would expect from an elite athlete with the resources he has. He has done a good job meeting that lofty expectation.  Let's say he is able to gain 8lbs of muscle per year, assuming the gain remains somewhat consistent, for two more years....going into his 4th year he would be about 240 lbs  by his 4th year I also think it is modest to say his free throw percent will be over 70% and he will be able to hit the mid-range jumper with enough consistency to use it as a weapon  so in his 4th year when players typically start to really take off we should have:  Defensive all-around BEAST at 240 lbs (his body type means this is rock-hard muscle and wirey strength), could be best defender in the whole league  Ridiculous leaping and speed, probably turn from okay to great on the boards with that weight and jumping, especially the O-boards  A nice face-up game for a center/PF because of his speed and getting down a few jumpers, also will have a hook shot and great at putbacks, cutting to rim  good passer with HIGH BBALL IQ and elite awareness  Nerlens will be all over the court on both sides of the floor.  maybe he won't reach these gols but he is clearly well on his way and not looking like he's slowing down  He could be a top ten player in the league for sure  his offense may even regress slightly next year in SOME respects as he tries to incorporate more but I fully expect year 3 and 4 for it all to really come together"

sixers,3dk3qn,IDontRegreddit,20,Thu Jul 16 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"No one knows what Noel's offensive game will become. He basically didn't shoot a jumpshot at Kentucky, so the fact he took (and made) any at the pro level was an improvement. His FT% really did improve quite a bit as the season wore along. Those are good signs.  Do I think he'll ever shoot 3-pointers? No. Do I think he can grow and hit open 12-footers with some (45% or so) consistency? Yes, I think that's possible.  I don't think his offense will ever be a go-to aspect of Sixers basketball. But I think his defense is under-appreciated by many, even some around this sub. Noel was maybe the best defensive rookie ever. He can grow into one of the NBA's best defensive forces ever. I don't consider that ""third banana"" kind of stuff. He's not Ben Wallace, but his overall impact on the game can be identical. That's what I see from him.  I don't want Noel traded. I wouldn't want Noel traded even if Okafor and Embiid were both 100% healthy superstars in their own right. I'd rather just have all three and fill the rest of the roster with trades/FA's."
sixers,3dk3qn,lawofmurphy,5,Thu Jul 16 22:37:18 2015 UTC,"45% from mid range is absolutely elite. If Noel shoots that from mid range he is a superstar. Conservatively I think he will be around 35-37% mark at his peak. He doesn't have great form or anything like that. But I definitely agree on your second point, his game is all about the defence where he has world beating potential. So excited to see that develop."
sixers,3dk3qn,mxnoob983,3,Fri Jul 17 13:17:03 2015 UTC,"Well yea 45% is elite, but he said 45% on OPEN jumpers.  There's a difference.  I doubt he'd be able to only take wide open shots.  So if you factor in 45% on open ones and maybe 30% on contested, you get about 37% or something like that overall like you said"

sixers,3dk3qn,tokeallday,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:41:14 2015 UTC,"I doubt he'd be able to only take wide open shots.   He definitely could until he proves himself as a shooter.  We've seen them space Jah all the way out to the 3 pt line in SL, I have no reason to believe they wouldn't do that with Noel to leave room for a guy like Wroten to attack the rim.  NO ONE respects Noel as a shooter at this point, which would cause defenders to sag off him and protect the paint.  I think he'll get a fair amount of open looks until he starts making them at around that 40-45% clip."
sixers,3dk3qn,chukinthebuket,9,Sat Jul 18 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"While Noel developing a jump shot would obviously improve his offensive game, I think improving his hands, and cutting abilities will be the biggest steps.  He will be second banana to Jah and Joel offensively, and that means it will be his man who is rotating more often than not to play help defense.  If Noel learns when and where to move once his man leaves, and can catch the ball every time it comes his way his offensive game can be at least as good as Deandre Jordan (considering Deandre is a better offensive rebounder and Noel is the better free throw shooter."
sixers,3dk3qn,jobie_deez,4,Fri Jul 17 00:19:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly my feelings. He will probably never be a great shooter (though he may yet become average or even good!) but what impressed me the most about his offense last year was his slashing ability. He can run circles around guys his size due to his athleticism, and improving in this one area I think is how he'll be able to be employed most effectively on offense"
sixers,3dk3qn,InmytimeofDying,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:16:53 2015 UTC,"He can be as good as DeAndre on offense, but you also have to remember DeAndre is a 5.  It doesn't matter that he can't hit a shot outside 2 ft, it's not his job.  If Noel is gonna play the 4 at this level and co-exist with either big, he NEEDS that jump shot."
sixers,3dk3qn,chukinthebuket,6,Sat Jul 18 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"I dont think he'll be able to shoot threes, but in that last interview he had w huffpost he said his shooting has been improving, and knowing brett brown they have probably been working on it since the season ended ... shooting as in those 15 footers that Timmy and KG knock down consistently"
sixers,3dk3qn,patelt91,7,Thu Jul 16 22:33:21 2015 UTC,"I've been picturing him as Tyson Chandler. Dude that can give 17 points just by being athletic and shit.

sixers,3dk3qn,DanaCarvey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"Tyson is really limited (although awesome at what he does). Nerlens is raw, but already is better at facing up at the elbow and either shooting or straight-line driving by the defender. Maybe Noah is a decent comparison, although in a perfect world it would be KG.  I feel like people are forgetting the strides NN made at the end of last year. He freaking scored 30 against the Clippers on jumpers, drives, lobs, free throws (it wasn't a competitive game, but still)."
sixers,3dk3qn,lilgodboy,5,Fri Jul 17 19:37:59 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that be crazy that we are so focused on Jah and Joel but maybe our franchise superstar was picked 6th in the draft two years ago?

sixers,3dk3qn,LostCityLeague,5,Fri Jul 17 01:10:33 2015 UTC,"Why? I mean Jahlil average 1.4 blocks and .8 steals per game, 2.2 DWS. Not great numbers, but Nerlens never even took a jumper at Kentucky."
sixers,3dk3qn,throwaweight7,2,Thu Jul 16 23:30:36 2015 UTC,"From my understanding of the consensus on Oak and Nerlens it's the hands/athleticism of Nerlens that sets them apart. Oak is a thumper with great feet, on defense that can keep him from being muscled and put him in good position when his man gets the ball inside. I don't see him handling space or speed or doing the hustle aspects well on D. Nerlens, on the other hand, is just amazing with how fast his hands are. He seems to play with an even bigger wingspan than he has because his hands get to where they need to be so fast. Nerlens Noel has David Robinson level D. With a true center inside that athleticism could have a pretty high ceiling. There's unknown to what Nerlens offensive game could be whereas Oak, while there is plenty of unknowns, has fewer because he's not going to play in space. He is what he is, dominating in the paint.  I'm going back to my booze and lurker status."

sixers,3dk3qn,dinolarry,5,Fri Jul 17 02:15:02 2015 UTC,He can be a star. I watched his offense steadily improve over the season.
sixers,3dk3qn,SteveWynn,2,Fri Jul 17 03:27:58 2015 UTC,"I hate how dismissive of his offense people are. I was listening to The Fanatic on draft night (note: I'm well aware that talk radio is not the highest level of intellectual sports conversation) and some dude made a joke about like ""You could lock Nerlens in an empty gym alone and he wouldn't put up 20 points."" I started screaming at the radio in my car. Nerlens scored 30 points THIS SEASON. In an NBA GAME. He's not the smoothest, most polished offensive player, but for the most part, if you run an offense that gets him the looks it should get him (post touches/oops/an occasional jumper), he knocks down plenty of them. And some nights, he hits a lot of them and end up with 30 GODDAMN POINTS. He can score just fine, especially considering his impact on the defensive end.  Again, I am fully aware that this comment a) was a joke and b) should be taken with a mountain of salt because it was on sports radio. But the fact that a version of this attitude is sort of the prevailing wisdom on Nerlens is a shame because I think he's already pretty fine on offense, and we should have every reason to expect his offense to improve."
sixers,3dk3qn,divadmilhorn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:34:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's like people watched him in the first half, dismissed him, and never paid attention later in the season. I'm puzzled by the comparisons to Jordan, Tyson, Wallace and other bigs who do nothing except catch lobs and jam put-backs in. That's not how he played in the second half, at all. He's already more comfortable creating his own shot than those guys."

sixers,3dk3qn,chukinthebuket,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:53:06 2015 UTC,"nn hit only one jumper in that 30 point game and it was a lucky fadeaway bank. While I do believe his jump shot will improve, I think that his improvement at the free throw line has been remarkable.  At UK the kid couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from the stripe, and in that 30 point game, his stroke looked awkward, but was consistent.  It was obvious what he was working on the most during his year off.  I'd look for him to not make an incredible amount of jumpers next season, but attempt more all together as he gains confidence this off season."
sixers,3dk3qn,alexmarte,2,Sat Jul 18 17:30:03 2015 UTC,"It sort of depends on your definition of ""franchise player"".  If you're asking if he's going to be the best player on a championship caliber team, I don't think he'll ever be that.  Partly because of his offense, and also because it's rare for a true C to be the best player on a team at that level in today's NBA (Horford is probably the best example as a C who's the best player on an elite team).  Cousins was the best scoring C in all of basketball last year and his team won less than 30 games.  If you're asking if he can be the 2nd, 3rd best player on a championship caliber team, a la Tyson Chandler or DeAndre Jordan, I think his defense gives him a much higher ceiling.  The problem with him here is that he's not a 4.  Not yet, and he may never become one.  I understand why people on this sub get so defensive about him (he was the only thing worthwhile last season, and really, the only positive result of ""Trust the Process"" at the moment. Everything/one else is predicated on fulfilling potential or conveying picks), but if you really think he can work and be successful on THIS team by just getting better at rolling to the basket on lobs/dunks, you're dreaming.  In an alternate reality where we drafted Wiggins in '14 and any combo of Mudiay/Russell this year, he's a perfect fit and we more than likely have our core in place.  Going forward, he's going to be asked to play a position he's not used to playing.  I know he's improved a lot, but it's kind of a long shot to say a kid who never shot a jumper in college will be able to effectively hit 10-15 ft shots consistently against the best competition in the world.  TL;DR - Noel can absolutely be an elite C, but he's gonna play the 4 here and if he can't hit a mid range jumper, he can't stay."
sixers,3dk3qn,chukinthebuket,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:44:22 2015 UTC,"He doesn't need to become a 20, 15 point scorer, etc. He can be a regular double double machine easily though. Think bigs like Tyson Chandler, Ben Wallace, even DeAndre Jordan. He can easily make 5 field goals per game off put backs, alley-oops/lobs, cuts/open under the basket, and transition dunks. Add to that the free throws per game. double figures easy. I think what's important to develop early is the free throw shooting so that no free shots are wasted. And the sense of shooting at a distance develops. The easiest ranged shot to master is actually the bank shot between the elbow and baseline. I don't know if the Sixer coaches realize this, but it's the easiest distance shot to add to a big's arsenal, just look at Tim Duncan even Zach Randolph, even Jahlil has a bank shot at midrange."
sixers,3dk3qn,decriz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:55:14 2015 UTC,"This is spot on. It's not about having him score droves of points, but when the opportunities arise, make him highly efficient, i.e. didnt Deandre Jordan have a really high FG% this season?  And yes FT shooting is a must- prob the only downside to Deandre (good comparison of the type of player you'd want Noel to become)."
sixers,3dk3qn,sochac,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:01:49 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends what people think of as a good offensive game. DeAndre Jordan and Tyson Chandler are actually two of the best offensive centers in the league because their role is very well defined and they're very good at it - run pick and rolls, and finish at the rim. Nerlens probably can't be on their level as an offensive rebounder since he'll never be that big, but he's actually a significantly better passer than both which can easily make up for that since he has a little bit of dimensionality beyond ""dunk.""   The big thing for him is if he can be a consistent finisher of lobs (which tbh, is partially on the playmakers of the Sixers since they were bad at this) he can be a plus on offense."

sixers,3di906,TheSwampDweller,14,Thu Jul 16 14:13:24 2015 UTC,"Sounds about right. Could be a year sooner depending on how things pan out.  If you look at it from the perspective of Josh Harris and how he wants the Sixers to run as an organization, the pictures pretty clear. The man co-founded one of the biggest private equity firms in the world that specializes in leveraged buyouts. I think his plan has always been to take over, cut out inefficiencies (in this case there were a lot) and rebuild by creating real value. Like any other business, this is a long and arduous project when it comes to a sports team. You have to identify any assets you have, navigate cutting away what you don't want, all while getting any shareholders (fans) on board.  I think the plan was evident from the second Harris bought the team. It's only now starting to come into fruition."
sixers,3di906,sooshiii,4,Thu Jul 16 14:34:55 2015 UTC,That's the textbook definition of private equity; unfortunately that's not how most of them operate.
sixers,3di906,edubcb,10,Thu Jul 16 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"To me, the fallout from the Bynum trade started this clock. If everything works out as planned we should be contending by 2019-2020, maybe sooner if we accquire a superstar VIA trade or free agency. The clock could also be extended if Embiid never touches the hard wood and Okafor/sauce fail to pan out."
sixers,3di906,Halfonion,9,Thu Jul 16 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"Im all with the plan...but with your logic we might never be good. If Okafor and Embiid don't pan out and we don't win, Hinkie failed. You cant suck forever."
sixers,3di906,GrownManMove,3,Thu Jul 16 15:56:22 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily true... By all estimations Noel is going to be a stud. Even if Embiid and Okafor don't work out we still have a ton of top picks coming up in the 16 and 17 drafts, plus the potential to swap with the kings. Again that might push contending back a little but i dont think its the end of the world."
sixers,3di906,Halfonion,6,Thu Jul 16 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm fine with the three big men. Having a 33% chance that you're going to have a premiere big man on your team for a long, long time is good to me."
sixers,3di906,charliedarwinsfather,3,Thu Jul 16 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"But there's not a 33% chance of that.  Having 3 very good prospects increases your odds over having one or two, yes.  But there's no guarantee that one of them will become a premier big man.  Two could bust and one could end up being a solid starter.  Two could be solid starters and one could bust.  They could all bust.  Who knows what's gonna happen, but 33% is not accurate."
sixers,3di906,tokeallday,3,Thu Jul 16 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"You're right, its an oversimplification. I should more say that we have 3 opportunities to have a premiere bigman."

All we can do now is gather assets and hope our tops picks pan out. If by 2017-2018 we dont have a true superstar and a good supporting cast than Hinkie will most likely have failed and he will be gone. The point is Hinkie can still succeed if he whiffs on both Okafor and Embiid.

The ownership group knew going in that their investment could only go up due to the growth in the sport locally and globally.  The big thing is that they took Snider's secondary focus and gave it the attention and investment it needed to operate as a serious business. No more practicing at PCOM and creating a real facility. Investing in a D-League team. Getting the name out there in the community and becoming a part of the area. Investing in sports science, analytics and player development.  The Sixers were run about as ass backwards as a professional franchise could be in modern times. Fixing all that stupid stuff takes time."

sixers,3dkgry,Mr_Sixer,8,Fri Jul 17 00:14:27 2015 UTC,Devin Booker's and Cameron Payne's come around often though. I still would like one of them but don't think they're worth sweating over missing out on.
sixers,3dkgry,choose_uh_username,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:33:40 2015 UTC,Yeah Cameron Payne I agree. Devin Booker is just showing up in summer league right now and I was high on him predraft.  Would have taken him before Frank the Tank and Winslow. As long as he doesn't become Klay 2.0 we straight though.
sixers,3dkgry,choose_uh_username,2,Fri Jul 17 00:37:41 2015 UTC,Yea I think Stauskas brings a similar skill set though offensively and he can actually create room for his own shot with Booker didn't show at Kansas. I think Booker does have potential to be a really good two-way player even though he was pretty subpar at Kentucky because of his lateral quickness and physical profile.
sixers,3dkgry,LRW35,7,Fri Jul 17 00:41:34 2015 UTC,"Im 99% positive Stauskas will be better than Booker, and Cam Payne's come around pretty often"
sixers,3dkgry,DanaCarvey,3,Fri Jul 17 00:40:51 2015 UTC,Stauskas definitely has more offensive potential. But his defense is supposedly really really bad. I think Booker has the potential to become a great defender.
sixers,3dkgry,jackfoss,2,Fri Jul 17 00:53:05 2015 UTC,"One thing I'm not super worried about is defense on this team. Grant, Thompson and Covington on the wings with Nerlens protecting the paint is great. It'll be alright with Okafor and Stauskas there"
sixers,3dkgry,jamhamram,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:15:26 2015 UTC,"Well we can't play all of them at once. I would be on the same page as you if we had both Embiid and Noel in the middle, but now that Okafor is our guy perimeter defense is going to be more of a need.  Covington has the tools to become a good defender, but he is not very good yet, however I think that Grant and Thompson will be very very good defenders for us in the future.  I think it all comes down to who we eventually see as our longterm solution at PG. If we had Damian Lillard for example who is a turnstile on defense then Stauskas would not work, and giving up offense for much needed defense would be required e.g. Booker (or a similar player)  If we had a player like Mudiay running point who is a better defender but worse shooter, then we could definitely give up some perimeter defense for some better offense.  That being said I am simplifying this too much because there are way more variables involved, like if we had Chris Paul at our point guard, he is an elite defending PG but because of his height we couldn't switch him onto a 2 or 3 easily to cover up Stauskas's defense like we could with the 6'5 bull Emmanuel Mudiay. I am just on a pointless caffeine induced rant right now so I'm just going to stop and trusttheprocess"

So the biggest impact to the Sixers in a hypothetical uncapped league is that they wouldn't be able to acquire all of the assets for ""nothing"" like they've been able to.  As for whether we'd go after FA's...I dunno...I guess. If it's just a matter of overpaying everyone, I don't see why we'd be different from any other team."

sixers,3dhk9n,Feelfreetoupvote,9,Thu Jul 16 14:30:00 2015 UTC,"He played the most minutes on the worst defensive team in the NBA.   He had a poor DBPM, DRPM, and per NBA tracking stats, opponents shot a higher pct than average against him on every type of shot.   None of this says that he is going to be a poor defensive player going forward, but what evidence is there that he is already a good defensive player?"
sixers,3dhk9n,flyingdeathmachine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:29:33 2015 UTC,but what evidence is there that he is already a good defensive player?   Did you ever watch him play?  People who have will vociferously disagree with you.
sixers,3dhk9n,Hirshologist,3,Thu Jul 16 17:45:49 2015 UTC,"Sure, he absolutely has the tools to be a good defensive player.   Here's an example of someone who watches him more than probably 99% of NBA fans on Wiggins' defense:    The Bad: Defense wasn't quite as advertised (though rookies almost always struggle at that end), and had trouble filling the box score outside of scoring. (via http://www.canishoopus.com/2015/4/16/8420937/timberwolves-player-grades)   The critical thing here is that rookies struggling on defense != they will always be a poor defensive player. It seems pretty evident that given time, Wiggins will fit into the former."
sixers,3dhk9n,flyingdeathmachine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:18:22 2015 UTC,"That's fair and I hope i'm not implying he's a great defender compared to Nerlens (although I argue it's a little easier to defend bigs in the modern NBA than guards) but here's a more descriptive article on Wiggins' abilities as a defender.  As the article points out, he certainly has his share of weaknesses and question marks, but also fairly good strengths as well.     James Harden will also testify to his defensive abilities if need be."
sixers,3dhk9n,Hirshologist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:50:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole can be a good defender argument IMO is different than generally is a good defender. Lebron when he is locked in is an awesome defender. A lot of the time he isn't locked in.   Jimmy Butler can be a very good defender, but a lot of times last season he wasn't (mostly due to offensive burden). I'd argue that type of ability is probably more valuable than just being a slightly defender on aggregate with a weaker apex (since you can ramp up effort in playoffs).  I don't think there's any concern going forward that Wiggins will be a good defender (unlike say, Jabari Parker), but I just don't think he's quite there yet. In terms of the concerns about his game, it's on the lower end."
sixers,3dhk9n,flyingdeathmachine,3,Thu Jul 16 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  Of course I wanted Nerlens to win as a Sixers fan but Wiggins did deserve it.  Noel played very well, but not better than Wiggins."
sixers,3dhk9n,juco818,2,Thu Jul 16 19:40:09 2015 UTC,"Yea i feel like the locals are worried about not supporting their guy. Noel had a really good year, he just wasn't in the same realm as Wiggins. The greatest philly fan strength, loyalty, sorta  bites us in the butt sometimes"
sixers,3dhk9n,Feelfreetoupvote,7,Thu Jul 16 19:48:47 2015 UTC,Wiggins had a -1.8 DBPM and opponents shot a higher percentage than average against him from everywhere on the floor.
sixers,3dhk9n,lilgodboy,7,Thu Jul 16 14:47:57 2015 UTC,"From the basketball-reference explanation page of BPM:   ...on defense the box score is quite limited. Blocks, steals, and rebounds, along with minutes and what little information offensive numbers yield about defensive performance are all that is available. Such critical components of defense as positioning, communication, and the other factors that make Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan elite on defense can't be captured, unfortunately.   To say Wiggins is a poor defender based on those numbers is incredibly short sighted.  I agree with OP actually, volume scorers like Wiggins can fall victim in other areas of advanced statistics.  If you watch both play, I think there's no doubt Wiggins is gonna end up the superior prospect and there's no doubt in my mind the Sixers would've drafted him if they had a higher pick, regardless of Embiid's health situation."
sixers,3dhk9n,chukinthebuket,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:01:35 2015 UTC,"Wiggins is a great prospect. He just wasn't good as a rookie, and there are zero metrics that indicate otherwise. He showed flashes of future excellent, which hopefully he achieves.   I don't think the Sixers (or most teams) would have taken him over Embiid if health wasn't an issue. Embiid was easily the superior talent by consensus."

Wiggins is just pedestrian-to-lousy in all of them, which is worth mentioning when comparing him to other rookies.

sixers,3dhk9n,lilgodboy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:21:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you get it.  When it comes to defensive skill, the things he does best aren't measureable.   You're being very disingenuous by continuing to criticize his numbers, when stats (advanced or otherwise) can't measure half his game."
sixers,3dhk9n,Hirshologist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:43:18 2015 UTC,"What, exactly, does Wiggins do on defense that stats can't measure?   He wasn't good by any composite defensive stat, played tons of minutes on the worst defensive team in the league (which was 4 points per possession worse when he was on the floor), allowed opponents to shoot a higher percentage from everywhere on the floor than average, didn't block shots or get steals, and was prone to lapses and mistakes like most rookies.  Guys like Tony Allen, Draymond, Nerlens and other good defenders have great numbers in these kind of categories. Why is Wiggins so mysteriously under-appreciated by the numbers? Hint: He's not."
sixers,3dhk9n,lilgodboy,2,Thu Jul 16 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"such critical components of defense as positioning, communication, and the other factors that make Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan elite on defense can't be captured, unfortunately   That's like the 3rd time that's been quoted.  Are you sure you haven't read that yet?  He's similar to Iggy in a way, another person whose defensive skills aren't quantifiable.  He wasn't Top 50 in defensive advanced stats last season.  So, are you going to question his defensive ability?"
sixers,3dhk9n,Hirshologist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you keep stating that defensive impact isn't quantifiable. Like, Wiggins is great at ""communication"" like Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan? You're just making thing up.   Iggy has great defensive stats, unlike Wiggins. Opponents shot -2% again Iggy. His DBPM was 1.5, down from 3.0, and he's always rated well in that category. Garnett had fantastic defensive numbers (career average DBPM of 3.3), just like Duncan (career average DBMP of 4.0). Wiggins is a negative in that category.  I'm not arguing that all defensive impact is measurable by numbers alone, but defensive players generally have good defensive stats. Wiggins doesn't. The idea that he, unlike other good defensive players, somehow is mysteriously being ignored by the numbers is insane."
sixers,3dhk9n,lilgodboy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:42 2015 UTC,"I definitely think they would, for several reasons:   They already had a center in Noel. While maybe not having the same ceiling, Wiggins still had a superstar-level ceiling coming out of college, and probably the 2nd highest upside of anyone in that draft save for Embiid.   -Wing players in today's NBA are more dominant.  Judging by the Sixers style of play, they want to go for the typical trend: Run up and down the court, score in transition and shoot 3s.  Obviously Wiggins fits that mold.  We'll never know for sure, but the whole ""winless for Wiggins"" mantra we kept telling ourselves during the '13-'14 leads me to believe he was the main target all along, much like Russell was this year."
sixers,3dhk9n,chukinthebuket,2,Thu Jul 16 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"He also always guarded the opposition's best player, and he played for a team that basically picked up a guy off the streets to play for them because they had so many injuries."

sixers,3dhk9n,FuxBeta,12,Thu Jul 16 10:20:47 2015 UTC,I also think that Noel should have won but I can't tell if i'm just being biased. I have come to the sad conclusion that ROY and 6MOTY are mostly just about scoring and PPG.

People probably would have complained about Noel not deserving it if they gave it to him. I mean a guy like Wiggins who is touted to be the next perennial all star is the obvious choice to win the ROY award by default.   Looking at Wiggins raw stats is pretty impressive, but he technically wasn't that good when using advanced stats and factoring in the amount of minutes he played."
sixers,3dhk9n,Hirshologist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:45:23 2015 UTC,Completely agree with you. Especially on 6MOTY. Didn't Andre Iguodala finish like 5th in 6MOTY voting? That's brutal.
sixers,3dhk9n,NolanJones,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"Ironically, Iguodala's strengths don't show up in stats (advanced or otherwise) either.  Based on the OP's argument, Iggy doesn't have any business being as high as 5th in 6MOTY."
sixers,3dhk9n,Hirshologist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:00:29 2015 UTC,"I mean, I know it's not everything and it may have to do with the players surrounding him, but he led all reserves in plus-minus (+5.7)."
sixers,3dhk9n,NolanJones,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"problem with plus-minus is that it's heavily influenced by teammates, so it's hard using it to compare one player from the NBA's best team to a player on a more average NBA team."
sixers,3dhk9n,Hirshologist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"right, that's why i prefaced it with ""it may have to do with the players surrounding him,"" but I get your point. Iguodala is not a statistical monster despite his great value to a team in other ways."

sixers,3dhk9n,jjohn268,16,Thu Jul 16 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"When Jah wins ROY this year with 18ppg and Towns has much better all around stats, I don't want anyone to saying he deserved it."
sixers,3dhk9n,flyingdeathmachine,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:26:03 2015 UTC,"Highly doubt Towns will have better stats. Defense? Maybe, but if we're talking WS, VORP BPM etc, Okafor should be much higher than Towns. Offense is too good/efficient and he has dominated for the most part so far, even though it's only the Summer League."
sixers,3dhk9n,TheAntagonisticDildo,2,Thu Jul 16 12:05:38 2015 UTC,Towns should be an all around better player. But Okafor will dazzle with his offense. It could very well end up like the Noel and Wiggins race.

sixers,3dhk9n,JoelandNoel,7,Thu Jul 16 14:53:41 2015 UTC,"For the first half of the season Wiggins ran away with it, wasn't even a competition. Those last 2 months or so Nerlens seriously should have won it hands down. He wasn't only the best rookie down the stretch, but downright one of the best PLAYERS in the league. Seriously he had a historical season. Could have gone either way in the end."
sixers,3dhk9n,yourbestfwend,12,Thu Jul 16 12:56:42 2015 UTC,"I'm huge Sixers fan. And I'm going to get killed for this. But you guys are unbelievably biased. One of the best players in the league? Are you serious? Did you even watch any good teams? I like Nerlens and I think he has huge potential for us, but people need to stop blowing his performance out of proportion."
sixers,3dhk9n,HeJind,3,Thu Jul 16 15:17:58 2015 UTC,It think it would be fair to say he was one of the best defensive players in the league after the all  star break.  Top 15-20 maybe?  Offensively he was certainly not.  Average at best.
sixers,3dhk9n,davidcroda,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:02:15 2015 UTC,"Defensively, yes he was one of the best players in the league for those last 2 months."

sixers,3dhk9n,Kingdariush,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:42:37 2015 UTC,They were both lousy. Wiggins' advanced metrics are comically bad for a guy who won ROTY so easily.

sixers,3dhk9n,bieberhole696,2,Thu Jul 16 12:58:07 2015 UTC,"I feel Noels meh first half doomed any chance.  Your case for Noel is a good one, but it's not like Wiggins didn't play well.    Also IMO you can't make the case for Noel being more efficient when Wiggins is asked to shoot.  Noel would just pass out, we don't score because team stinks, and hey but I'm efficient.  You need to take efficiency with a grain of salt.  Someone has to shoot the ball eventually.    I'm fine with Wiggins winning.  He was #1 pick, he had the most scrutiny, he did his part on a bad team.  Yes Noel was 'better' but he did not run away with the stats."
sixers,3dhk9n,soylentcoleslaw,2,Thu Jul 16 13:23:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. I think people fall victim to recency bias, as Noel ended the season very well. Wiggins did too, but Noel's ending was better IMO. But nerlens offense at the start of the season was seriously terrible"
sixers,3dhk9n,themightypooperscoop,2,Thu Jul 16 15:45:41 2015 UTC,Wiggins is severely overrated. I am a big believer in the advanced stats because not everyone on here watched every single game that both Noel and Wiggins played in. I believe in the facts and I believe that Noel should have won.
sixers,3dhk9n,lilgodboy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:57:06 2015 UTC,"Noel overall had a slight edge over Wiggins, but if you're going to win ROY when you're not the scoring leader, you have to do more than have a slight edge, especially since he had the entire previous season to recuperate from his injury and get coaching from an NBA staff.  If he had double-digit rebounding numbers and maybe bumped 2 of the other stats above 2.0, he probably would have run away with it.  But make no mistake about it, hype plays a part in every year-end award, and the hype-train was fully behind Wiggins.  Just look at how the Timberwolves franchise is looked at compared to the 76ers, despite the standings last year."
sixers,3dhk9n,Happy_ScrappyHeroPup,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:51:12 2015 UTC,Yes. Noel was better than Wiggins at just about everything except scoring.
sixers,3dhk9n,fuji700,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:30:14 2015 UTC,"Wiggins was barely among the top five rookies last year. He just played a ton of minutes, scored some points and had a good narrative (being traded for Love). He, like most rookies, was lousy. Nerlens was at least elite on one side of the ball."
sixers,3dhk9n,nooge76,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:43:07 2015 UTC,"My opinion:  Noel did more to help his team win than any other rookie, but judging by the criteria voters base their decision on each season, Wiggins was the clear winner."

sixers,3dg8d4,DutchEnglish,7,Thu Jul 16 03:09:33 2015 UTC,I can't speak for OP but the ESPYs probably panned to Okafor because he's a rising star and Lebron is the current star/face of the NBA.

sixers,3dgdkx,marksills,5,Thu Jul 16 03:29:05 2015 UTC,His niche is shooting so that is setting the bar quite low.  League average is around that so I would want 39-40 ish.
sixers,3dgdkx,marksills,4,Thu Jul 16 05:25:22 2015 UTC,"League average is at 35, and Nik shot 32 last year, so I would be satisfied with 37 (I'm also not totally sold on him). Id be very very happy if he was at 40, but I guess volume has to be factored into that."
sixers,3dgdkx,jay_gaz,3,Thu Jul 16 05:31:38 2015 UTC,"Im not too high on stauskas, dont think he'll ever be a starter on a real contender, but im not an expert on him so its not written in stone or anything. Just think a lot of people are gonna be disappointed. Pierre reminds me of an Aaron Brooks type of player playing style wise, although chances are he wont be as good as him"
sixers,3dgdkx,PetalumaPegleg,3,Thu Jul 16 03:25:09 2015 UTC,"I can see Stauskas being a starter on this current team, but he is nothing more than a bench role player on a good team."
sixers,3dgdkx,CrunchyKorm,2,Thu Jul 16 03:54:19 2015 UTC,"Er... why? He's very young and was highly drafted in a good draft, and we haven't seen him play a minute in the Sixers system (which is potentially a good fit). He may or may not end up as good but his scoring and shooting percentages (but actually with better assists and rebounds) all compare favourably with JJ Reddick's first two seasons except FT%. I think JJ has turned into a pretty good starter, as has Korver."
sixers,3dgdkx,kip_chelly,2,Thu Jul 16 08:23:55 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't expect much of Jackson. I kinda see him as a redundant Isiah Canaan-level of player, but I'm willing to see what he has considering the PG situation. Off the bench is easier to understand than starting, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's a very-end of the rotation level player with Wroten back and healthy (presumably).  Stauskas' improvement I think right now is next season's biggest on-court X Factor (off-court being where the Heat, Lakers, and Thunder finish in the standings). There's no shying away from the fact that he was pretty bad for Sacramento last year, even if it was a bad situation to be in (playing behind a player the same age at the same position drafted the year before, plus all the coaching changes). We can say that the addition of Okafor will do well to shed defenders off the perimeter and free up Stauskas, but remember he played with arguably the league's best pure center last year in DeMarcus Cousins and still struggled. And we hope Okafor becomes the player Cousins has become.  I expect Thompson to start ahead of Stauskas at least at the beginning considering he's actually a vet with the team (weird, right?), knows his role well, and is a better defensive player. All Stauskas has to do is hit 3PT at a positive clip (above 37%) to earn playing time, and I believe his other positive assets - ball-handling for a SG and FT% - will also improve. If he becomes a positive player and legitimate piece moving forward then the transition to a good 76ers team becomes slightly more visible."
sixers,3dgdkx,JoelandNoel,2,Thu Jul 16 02:40:58 2015 UTC,"Pappy gawd has Lou Will potential off the bench, Sauce has starting potential and could potentially win most improved player of the year, if he balls out like he did at Michigan his sophomore year."
sixers,3dgdkx,kip_chelly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:44:27 2015 UTC,You can't win MIP as a sophomore. but if you could I think he would definitely have a chance. If he is able to shoot over 40% from 3 for the year and get a few assists per game I'll be happy.

sixers,3dgdkx,RkyAzure,2,Thu Jul 16 02:52:52 2015 UTC,I think it can but voters don't vote for them cause sophomores are expected to improve.
sixers,3dgdkx,Xepa,2,Thu Jul 16 02:58:31 2015 UTC,Neither Pierre or Sauce will not be starting material for the next couple of years. I doubt either will be in the end but that's just my opinion. Sauce could be a sixth man while Pierre could be a Nate Robinson type role(which isn't a bad thing tbh). I think the only foreseeable starters right now are Okafor and Noel.
sixers,3dgdkx,Freak_Fest,2,Thu Jul 16 08:33:53 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe Sauce can be the 3rd or 4th best guy on a championship team. I'm that high on him. Not just his shooting, but his ball handling and decision making. <3 Sauce"

Sure we shouldn't expect him to be the best SF in the league, but I don't understand the negative attitude.   Personally I'm not expecting a championship, but it is exciting to have a few players who you know could be genuine building blocks for the future of this team.    I was also confused by the Okafor pick, but after watching him move so smoothly in the post and knowing what we know now (and the sixers likely have known for a while), I think it was absolutely the right thing to do to draft the best player available.  No matter how you look at it, we drafted the player who will most positively affect our team, and we have a genuine-honest-to-goodness scoring threat.  Personally, I'm very excited to see the beginnings of a new era of 76ers basketball.  Welcome aboard, at least no one can call you a bandwagon jumper!!!!  Fair warning though...being a sixers fan can be an emotionally damaging decision.  I've managed to watch 60-65 games a year the last couple years and often it's not pleasant, but it will be nice to watch this team gel and create an identity.  The sixers don't have many ""fair weather"" fans left, so being in on the ground level will be a special thing, I think."
sixers,3dflcg,ACPhila,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:46:07 2015 UTC,Well I have decided that they will be one of my 5 league pass games. So I am investing quite a bit. I think Jahlil and Nerlens next to eachother can be a nice duo.
sixers,3dflcg,JoelStampiid,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:31:03 2015 UTC,"Their strengths and weaknesses certainly compliment each other.  I think Jahlil may be an under rated defender, but I'm not really expecting any all-defense nominations out of him.  However he is a fantastic scorer with a seriously polished post game for being 19 or whatever he is.  I know it's played out, but he definitely has some Duncan like aspects to his offensive game, and if he can learn to use his 270 pound frame, he could be a true force under the basketball.  Will not be surprised if he leads this team in scoring for years to come.    While Noel's offensive game definitely improved down the stretch, his defensive play was so outstanding people were starting to put him in the conversation for Rookie of the Year.  He is a legitimate shot blocker already and he had much more steals than I would've expected truthfully.  Best part is he's young and will hopefully only get better.  One of the more telling games for me was when we played Houston after the all star break and I'm fairly sure (but too lazy to look it up) he had 5 or 6 blocks.  He blocked Harden and showed me he isn't afraid to take the lane away from star players like Harden and Howard.  Incredible defensive confidence for a rookie.  I could honestly see him being an All Defense PF consistently."

He has the body, footwork, hands and shooting touch to be a double-double machine. I love his game. And he's a great passer. When you get double-teamed in the summer league you know you're a real threat."
sixers,3dflcg,thethinkingsixer,-5,Thu Jul 16 12:24:16 2015 UTC,"Some people look at Jahlil's summer league offensive performance and say he won't be able to replicate it against real NBA players. I disagree.   Well I would hope he wouldn't replicate overall bad performances to  NBA games. But I do think he will get better from here on.  Also, cool it on Nik Stauskas a bit. Most people that start following a certain team for the sole reason that a below average player they like is on it will end up disappointed and probably hating that team for not giving enough chances to that player. Nothing wrong with watching your favorite players, but I'd just advise that you temper your expectations for Nik's future on this team since you seem to be calling yourself a ""fan"" of the Sixers."

sixers,3dejaw,brodownincrotown,2,Wed Jul 15 20:08:51 2015 UTC,Thanks for the interesting look into how to develop soccer teams abroad.  I find it fascinating that the bottom 3 or so teams are basically kicked out of the league for a season.  Soccer rules are crazy over there and they make my head spin.
sixers,3dejaw,chukinthebuket,2,Wed Jul 15 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"The good part about this system is that with enough success any team can reach higher leagues. The English pyramid system is enormous and hypothetically if an amateur team kept winning their league over and over again they could become semi-pro and eventually pro.   One group of disgruntled manchester utd supporters frustrated with the dealings of thr glazer family actually formed their own club. FC United of Manchester, the new club, has climbed the ranks and is now only 5 tiers away from the English Premier League! It's one of the things that really makes things exciting, watching grass roots teams."
sixers,3dejaw,gogunners11,2,Thu Jul 16 00:54:05 2015 UTC,"(This is not specifically aimed at you)  That's the first thing people say when they try to sell pro/rel as being better than the American system - anyone can win.  But the truth is that American leagues and their static roster of teams see more turnover at the top than the Premier League does.  Money still rules there just as much as it does here, except that there they sell this illusion of parity.  I don't mind the system and I think it's fine there.  I just get irritated when I'm informed that American leagues are doing it wrong."

sixers,3dejaw,robspeaks,2,Thu Jul 16 01:38:24 2015 UTC,"Espn treats the nba like a single season on nba2k. They were saying that the lakers would need to trade randle in order to get former all-star david lee. Dont put stock into their analysis, just watch the highlights"
sixers,3dejaw,collinw727,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:38:28 2015 UTC,"I've been saying it for years, and more times than not I get down voted to hell, but the only way to truly get rid of tanking is to either completely randomize the draft (which is silly) or to institute a relegation and promotion system.   I honestly much prefer the way soccer in everywhere but the US handles player transfers and money (before FFP)."
sixers,3dejaw,brssnj45,2,Wed Jul 15 21:50:35 2015 UTC,"Tanking won't ever be a thing in MLS because the game is global.  The structure of the league was a brilliant move to establish financial stability after multiple US soccer leagues had failed.  The rising status of MLS is not in spite of the way it's run, but because of it.  It's also just a step in a process.  The setup has already begun unwinding and eventually the teams will be free like any other league.  MLS will be a legitimate force in world soccer and other small, struggling leagues around the world will try to emulate the one-entity system.  MLS is basically the Sam Hinkie of soccer."
sixers,3dejaw,robspeaks,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:19:42 2015 UTC,Probably. The quality of the infastructure and youth coaching is getting better. I'd talk about my problems with the MLS but I'm drunk and don't want to sound stupid. Thank God for autocorrect.
sixers,3dejaw,brssnj45,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:45:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Sixers are rebuilding in a particularly unique way, but there are some obvious reasons they became a punchline.   tying the all time loss record drafting three lottery picks with injuries/overseas commitment playing tons of anonymous d-leaguers and free agents trading for tons of second-round picks   The whole tanking debate needed a face and the Sixers were an easy target. I don't think Philly fans should be so sensitive or feel singled-out -- it makes sense how it happened."

sixers,3ddln5,Impakt55,6,Wed Jul 15 14:19:11 2015 UTC,So many times I think damn. Did he just did dis?
sixers,3ddln5,Kingdariush,24,Wed Jul 15 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"I might get flamed for this, but I think Porzingis has the higher upside in the modern NBA than Jah. His ability to make perimeter shots, as well as offer some rim protection, will in time make him a crazy weapon on the court."
sixers,3ddln5,allanmac00,15,Wed Jul 15 14:09:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's crazy at all. In fact, you heard a lot of ""talking heads"" saying that leading up to the draft. Essentially that outside of Towns, Prozingis may have the highest ceiling of any prospect, but that Okafor was also a safer bet."
sixers,3ddln5,charliedarwinsfather,6,Wed Jul 15 14:11:01 2015 UTC,I love watching Oakafor play.  I don't really watch college ball so never saw much of him. He's so damn fluid for a big man.
sixers,3ddln5,DaBombDiggidy,7,Wed Jul 15 15:29:19 2015 UTC,while i agree porzingis has a higher ceiling himself i can't help but feel like jahs skill set can benefit his team mates better once we get rolling. Obviously he has to get in better shape and learn some D FENCE
sixers,3ddln5,allanmac00,9,Wed Jul 15 14:11:38 2015 UTC,"For sure. I do think Jah's ""weaknesses"" are very correctible, at least to the point of not being total liabilities."
sixers,3ddln5,DaBombDiggidy,3,Wed Jul 15 14:14:25 2015 UTC,"oh totally, him getting in shape and being around noel will really help his defense. He's visibly not able to keep up with the game at a high pace for the minutes we need him right now. Dude's 19 though i got more then hope hell be a beast very soon."
sixers,3ddln5,chukinthebuket,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:21:57 2015 UTC,"I think once Noel gets accustomed to guarding 4s, they'll be fine defensively.  The scary prospect is on offense.  You now have two players who can't hit a midrange shot with any kind of consistency.  For as great as Noel is on defense, his offense is atrocious, and he was literally a black hole for that offense many times last season.  I worry about them giving the illusion of any kind of spacing, and if one of them can't develop that midrange game, they won't last very long as a pairing."
sixers,3ddln5,allanmac00,3,Wed Jul 15 15:20:36 2015 UTC,Hopefully kickouts to Sauce and RoCo can help that out.
sixers,3ddln5,dougluss,2,Wed Jul 15 16:45:55 2015 UTC,"I still think Noel will be great as a 4. He loves the weak side block, he can drive the paint from the key, and he plays face up basketball. Let's see how his midrange shot has improved (I bet it has), but he can still help the team from the 4 now while he keeps working on that shot. His defense is just too good."
sixers,3ddln5,xychosis,5,Wed Jul 15 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"He definitely has much more upside, but I'm very doubtful that he ever touches that ceiling. I was adamant prior to the draft that he'd end up as the fourth-best big man in this draft when all is said and done, and I'm sticking to my guns. I rate Towns, Okafor and Myles Turner higher than him."
sixers,3ddln5,Halfonion,3,Wed Jul 15 14:14:49 2015 UTC,"So his ceiling is Dirk, but he will most likely be some variation of LaFrentz/Kaman/Kirilenko? Is that a fair assement?"
sixers,3ddln5,eru88,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:04:29 2015 UTC,He is potential is what got him to jump in the draft to #4. But with a much bigger risk than Okafor. For me Okafor looks like a sure All Star while Porzingis could either be a bust or All Star as well.
sixers,3ddln5,root88,0,Wed Jul 15 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"Well, Porzingis definitely won that battle."
sixers,3ddln5,girlfriend_pregnant,11,Wed Jul 15 17:09:17 2015 UTC,This draft is looking incredible. Honestly I love both of these guys.
sixers,3ddln5,iloveopenbar,22,Wed Jul 15 14:07:50 2015 UTC,Can't wait to see nerlens shut down kristaps
sixers,3ddln5,packimop,16,Wed Jul 15 13:55:53 2015 UTC,yeah really I think Nerlens is going to bitchsmack Kristaps for a lonnnggg time. He's never had to face a superior athlete with the hands of Nerlens.
sixers,3ddln5,iloveopenbar,4,Wed Jul 15 14:12:25 2015 UTC,"Can nerlens guard him all the way out at the 3pt line though? And if he does, doesn't that take away some of Nerlens' value as a help defender blocking shots?"
sixers,3ddln5,chukinthebuket,11,Wed Jul 15 14:26:52 2015 UTC,"It will, but I'm assuming nerlens will be on him more since they'll both be playing at 4.  And yes nerlens is more than capable of going out to the perimeter and poking that ball out of his hands"
sixers,3ddln5,hiv_negative,3,Wed Jul 15 14:36:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you gotta also take into account Porzingis is anywhere from 7'1""-7'3"".  Couple that length with his athleticism, and Nerlens may be one of the few players in the league who can match his athleticism and also has the length to cover him out on the perimeter."
sixers,3ddln5,OnAWhale,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:17:53 2015 UTC,yea idk i think now noel has more value as a shotblocker where he can anchor the middle and erase mistakes until okafor can play perk to noels KG
sixers,3ddln5,allanmac00,6,Wed Jul 15 20:00:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm crazy, but I did not think Porzingis looked good. Barely saw the ball on the offensive end (especially in the first half) and only was effective defensively when Okafor was visibly gassed. Also finished with 7 fouls in under 22 minutes."
sixers,3ddln5,root88,3,Wed Jul 15 14:47:47 2015 UTC,"He may not have looked amazing in this game, but I think you can see glimpses of what he brings in terms of shooting stroke combined with freak size."
sixers,3ddln5,RunnitBack,-1,Wed Jul 15 16:47:18 2015 UTC,He smartly used the fouls he was allotted.
sixers,3ddln5,Hootchy,5,Wed Jul 15 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"This thread is overly negative on Jah - not sure if it's because of all of us fans want to temper our expectations or what, but quite simply Jah owned Kristaps in this game. Read the Grantland article linked in another thread on this sub for a great breakdown. Sure Kristaps had 3 blocks, but at the cost of 7 fouls and Jah absolutely destroying him down low all first half."
sixers,3ddln5,chukinthebuket,3,Wed Jul 15 17:29:13 2015 UTC,Both looked like they have bright futures
sixers,3ddln5,chukinthebuket,2,Wed Jul 15 13:50:46 2015 UTC,Love the move by Okafor at 2:41!  Edit: Link - https://youtu.be/yuwZpTv1pZM?t=159
sixers,3ddln5,chukinthebuket,2,Wed Jul 15 13:09:32 2015 UTC,"Looks like Porzi owned him a little last night, especially at the end of the game.  Those Oka-four blocks at the end were killer.  Really hope Jah gets his butt in the gym and works on conditioning for the next 3 months or he's gonna have a LOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNGGGGGG season."
sixers,3ddln5,PHLHomer,7,Wed Jul 15 15:05:29 2015 UTC,"Porz did have a couple of blocks on Okafor, but to be fair, Porz also had 7 fouls in 22 minutes."
sixers,3ddln5,chukinthebuket,3,Wed Jul 15 15:13:42 2015 UTC,"It's not just Porz, it's a consistent problem I've seen with Okafor that worries me.  He looked like he didn't get any lift from his legs at all (not that he really ever does) last night, and his lack of athleticism was definitely a problem.  I am aware it's SL and I'm repeating that in my head as a mantra since it's WAAAAYYYY too early to get worked up, but that lack of athleticism is the one thing that I think would make him a bust, and that's the scariest thing about him.  He just might not be a good enough athlete to be a superstar."
sixers,3ddln5,and1thousand,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:22:58 2015 UTC,"I get what you're talking about. Ever since Matt Moore talked the other day about Okafor's shots being ""block bait"" or whatever, that's changed how I watch him. He's definitely not a high flyer, and he does seem to do some moves around the rim the come from a very ""low"" place.  But...I can't agree on the lack of athleticism. Watching some of his post moves, and his spin moves, etc, he has athleticism. He's just not a big leaper (I guess)."

sixers,3ddln5,Hirshologist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:36:54 2015 UTC,"I'm talking explosiveness as it pertains to other players in the league.  Obviously he has great athleticism if he's playing in the NBA, but I'm talking about the elite level athleticism that guys like Towns, Mudiay, Noel, etc. have.  Does that automatically mean he won't be great? No.  All I said was that it's a concern of mine."

This sub, a few of the fringe media, bloggers, twitterati, these are the only people keeping up with Joel.  The only time most people in Philly hear about Joel is when the print, TV and radio media are are giving them bad news.   As far as this sub goes. This is a Sixers forum, to discuss Sixers news and topics. Embiid's continued recovery is one of the main topics. Respectfully, get over it."

It's not just the Sixers that do it though as they already showed him shooting flat footed threes again (I think we're still before surgery though) at Summer League this week.  I don't know if we'll see the pregame workouts again this season or not though."

sixers,3djj8j,rahbee33,2,Fri Jul 17 14:46:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I just don't think that we should continue to hypebeast this dude coming off of a second surgery. Information about Embiid leaks out into /r/NBA, CBS Sports, ESPN, etc. Its not just a centralized thing and really there isn't anything wrong with it but it just adds another layer of unnecessary pressure onto Embiid.  I firmly believe that the graft will allow him to have a long and healthy career, and he's only going to be 22 years old at the start of this third season. I guess it's just a mentality thing where some people want to get hyped over every single baby step, I'd rather just see him when he is ready."
sixers,3djj8j,rahbee33,4,Thu Jul 16 20:33:16 2015 UTC,"I totally get where you're coming from.  That's part of the reason I changed the side banner image today. I feel like the best thing is to focus on the guys on the floor this upcoming year and let Embiid do his thing, just like you said.  Personally, I have a feeling all the leaks and pregame workouts were all to sell season tickets for this year. They didn't do that with Nerlens, but they also had MCW. With Nerlens being a bit of a wild card to start the season and the fact that he isn't a scoring ""superstar type"" they needed something the season ticket holders could latch onto and that was Embiid.  I'm going to guess that Okafor and Noel along with the rest of the up and coming young guys are going to give everybody more to focus on on the court this year rather than worrying about what somebody is doing off it like last year."
sixers,3djj8j,chukinthebuket,0,Thu Jul 16 20:59:16 2015 UTC,well said.  I agree 100%.
sixers,3dfya0,demo4,5,Wed Jul 15 23:32:54 2015 UTC,"I think overseas was the original plan, similar to jordan mcrae's path last year. He hasn't proven himself enough in Summer League to change that plan"
sixers,3dfya0,ifollowphillysports,5,Wed Jul 15 23:38:01 2015 UTC,D league or Europe would be my guess.
sixers,3dfya0,tungtwister,2,Wed Jul 15 23:47:42 2015 UTC,"Very modest, nice kid.  Talked to him on 3 occasions.  His grandpa was a big influence on him.  His grandpa actualy played professional soccer in France for teams like PSG and Bordeaux, as well as playing for Cameroon with Joakim Noah's Grandpa. JP is actually named after his grandfather.  The whole family is wonderful"
sixers,3dfya0,marksills,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"Based on how he played, probably D league or overseas, although I wouldnt be 100% surprised if we took him to be able to have Brett develop him, although he may develop more where he can get more playoff time. Shot pretty terribly this summer, although he played pretty well today and had a monster dunk"
sixers,3dfya0,eazylee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:36:44 2015 UTC,I'd like to see him play 3-4 years in Europe while we hold his rights. He has a lot of things that I like but it is obvious he is not remotely close to being an NBA player. My hope is that he learns to hit corner 3's at a league average rate and upgrades his handling and passing to a level of a point guard's

sixers,3dbvm0,throwaweight7,41,Wed Jul 15 01:57:42 2015 UTC,That was part of the Stauskas trade - Hinkie had to give up some of his hair to Vivek. He did that for us.
sixers,3dbvm0,rahbee33,8,Wed Jul 15 02:15:17 2015 UTC,Stress can cause hair loss. He might be stressed about Embiid news.

sixers,3dbvm0,GirouxIs4TheChildren,13,Wed Jul 15 02:50:02 2015 UTC,Yessss!!!!! So pumped to have him on the roster. Hopefully we'll sign scotty too.
sixers,3dbvm0,MotM54,5,Wed Jul 15 01:48:53 2015 UTC,Scotty Pappy and Canaan as our three pgs this year maybe
sixers,3dbvm0,tokeallday,24,Wed Jul 15 01:50:44 2015 UTC,Wroten over Canaan
sixers,3dbvm0,Freak_Fest,8,Wed Jul 15 01:55:53 2015 UTC,Wroten is more of a SG
sixers,3dbvm0,danielsilva12345,25,Wed Jul 15 01:57:15 2015 UTC,"wroten is a point guard that dosen't run the point, or a shooting guard that can't shoot.... pick your poison"
sixers,3dbvm0,Freak_Fest,12,Wed Jul 15 02:33:03 2015 UTC,shooting guard that can't shoot
sixers,3dbvm0,hemminngway,13,Wed Jul 15 02:35:01 2015 UTC,"SG that gets to rim at will, excited to see the improvement he makes this year"
sixers,3dbvm0,lilgodboy,12,Wed Jul 15 03:00:39 2015 UTC,How doesn't he run point?  Assists per 36 minutes:   Wroten 6.3 Lillard 6.2 Parker 6.2 Conley 6.1
sixers,3dbvm0,ohnoyoudidnt29,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:47:57 2015 UTC,Per 36 is misleading
sixers,3dbvm0,lilgodboy,8,Wed Jul 15 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. But would you prefer assists per 100 possessions?   Wroten 8.8 Parker 8.8 Lillard 8.8 Conley 8.8 Bledsoe 8.8 Rose 8.5 Calderon 8.2 Knight 8.2 Kemba 7.7 Burke 7.6 Kyrie 7.4   Wroten has his flaws, but claims that he's ""not a PG"" are just cliches based on obsolete notions about the role of the position. He's not a purist distributor, but neither are most PGs in the modern NBA."
sixers,3dbvm0,fuji700,8,Wed Jul 15 18:40:30 2015 UTC,Wroten is most certainly a PG.
sixers,3dbvm0,Freak_Fest,5,Wed Jul 15 02:05:04 2015 UTC,Odd that he would be listed as and play SG most of the time then.
sixers,3dbvm0,fuji700,7,Wed Jul 15 02:08:25 2015 UTC,"-worst attribute: shooting; -best attribute: getting by people; -avg. 5 assists per game; -No MCW this year, he will be used as a PG"
sixers,3dbvm0,Freak_Fest,5,Wed Jul 15 03:07:14 2015 UTC,If he plays the whole year at PG he will break the record for turnovers in a season.
sixers,3dbvm0,andhily,2,Wed Jul 15 03:24:03 2015 UTC,Canaan has a guaranteed contract though
sixers,3dbvm0,MatCauthonsHat,4,Wed Jul 15 02:10:33 2015 UTC,Not if he is released before midnight
sixers,3dbvm0,secret_economist,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:25:46 2015 UTC,Less than a million.  Not a big deal.

sixers,3dbvm0,fuji700,10,Wed Jul 15 07:01:59 2015 UTC,"Wonder how much of a paycut he had to take to get Hinkie to agree to pose for this  We may be just signing him to keep Joel happy as he can use his hashtag still.  Seriously though, I'm excited. Pierre has showed he's capable of playing well, excited to see what he can do during the full season"
sixers,3dbvm0,danielsilva12345,6,Wed Jul 15 02:00:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe you woulda grown another couple inches if ya slept a little more ?!  Just Kidding, fan of the signing"
sixers,3dbvm0,EaglePride101,3,Wed Jul 15 02:04:44 2015 UTC,anyone knows the details of the contract?
sixers,3dbvm0,rahbee33,5,Wed Jul 15 02:33:26 2015 UTC,"4 years, probably Hinkie special"
sixers,3dbvm0,CrunchyKorm,4,Wed Jul 15 04:17:57 2015 UTC,Well this makes things interesting.  That puts PGs on the roster to:  Wroten  Canaan  Jackson  McConnell  That means that without any further movement Ish and Scottie are out. It also means that we don't have an NBA starting PG to start the season.  He's not done moving.
sixers,3dbvm0,rahbee33,5,Wed Jul 15 01:58:36 2015 UTC,"Partially guaranteed deal, so not fully signed."
sixers,3dbvm0,ludvigsra,4,Wed Jul 15 02:00:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly, which would be nothing for Hinkie to eat if he needs a roster spot, but he is signed none the less."

sixers,3dg3su,GOATrieIrving,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:37:59 2015 UTC,"Very (9-10)  Rookies making the ASG is rare enough. The factors involved have to be (generally speaking) that Okafor puts up fantastic stats (lets say 20-10-2-2 on 50% FG), the Sixers have to be at least better than the team's low expectations, and the East has to either be bad again and/or the other players who play center in the conference have to either be hurt or having really down years.  Consider the other All-Star caliber center-eligble players currently in the East: Brook Lopez, Pau Gasol, Al Horford, Greg Monroe, Andre Drummond, and Nik Vucevic to name a few - and those are all players on teams presumably better than Philadelphia, which does way heavily in All-Star considerations."

He's going to be like the third option off the bench for a team that desperately thinks it's all-in for this year, but is just as likely to completely implode and convey their high lottery pick to us.   I like Luc, he's a nice defender and a good dude and I'm glad we got to know him better here, but honestly this isn't a guy who's going to move a team's needle in either direction."
sixers,3daryc,BourbonShocker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:43:11 2015 UTC,"Will be interesting to see what Luc's absence means to the Sixers. He played the third-most minutes last season and his on/off numbers indicate the team was, unsurprisingly, better defensively and worse offensively with him on the floor. On a team that had plenty of bad offensive players, Luc was the worst -- he took took the third-most shots on the team.   Nerlens' absorption of Thad's minutes had a profound impact on both sides of the ball, and I'm curious to see what swapping Okafor for Luc/Sims will mean.   One could make an argument that Luc was one of the biggest reasons the Sixers' offense was so terrible. His departure will absolutely mean improvement in scoring, but I'm not sure the defense won't slip at the same time."

sixers,3db2or,SlappyBagg,3,Tue Jul 14 22:59:54 2015 UTC,I still think he will make the team but he certainly isn't making it easy on himself
sixers,3db2or,ChickenLiverNuts,19,Tue Jul 14 23:18:22 2015 UTC,Totally out on Tokoto.   For all that he doesn't do he needs to play defense and he is not doing that.
sixers,3db2or,rahbee33,3,Tue Jul 14 22:12:02 2015 UTC,He's a pretty good athlete... but that's literally it.
sixers,3db2or,zigzagzil,2,Tue Jul 14 23:22:01 2015 UTC,Give him a year or two to put it all together.
sixers,3db2or,ihorsey,17,Tue Jul 14 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"Okafor is literally unstoppable in the post. If he develops that little mid range bank @ a better rate, he'll be DOMINANT."
sixers,3db2or,troublewill,14,Tue Jul 14 22:12:11 2015 UTC,The fact that he is only 19 always amazes me
sixers,3db2or,Tell_Me_Random_Facts,4,Tue Jul 14 23:18:22 2015 UTC,I'm only asking for 10-12 feet.
sixers,3db2or,thisisnotme12244,17,Tue Jul 14 23:20:08 2015 UTC,I'm just here to upvote the Wilbekin comments
sixers,3db2or,And3rson,15,Tue Jul 14 23:37:22 2015 UTC,... So I may have overhyped Jordan McRae in my head...  Like a lot.
sixers,3db2or,ank1613,5,Tue Jul 14 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"I'm still holding onto the fact this wasn't his best ball. He can get buckets, but these just haven't fallen.  I think we'll at least get another look at him during preseason."
sixers,3db2or,rahbee33,3,Tue Jul 14 22:23:21 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll give him a chance at the roster come preseason but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed. He shoots everyone right out of the offense when he's on the floor and doesn't make the shots.
sixers,3db2or,ank1613,2,Tue Jul 14 22:25:23 2015 UTC,"THe problem is if he isn't getting buckets, he's practically useless. Actually, is a negative to the team because of his poor defense."
sixers,3db2or,jjohn268,4,Tue Jul 14 22:32:14 2015 UTC,I'd rather have Ish Smith on this team than McRae
sixers,3db2or,jjohn268,16,Tue Jul 14 22:31:23 2015 UTC,Wilbekin playing his way into the team. Also showing how much shooters can benefit from playing beside okafor.
sixers,3db2or,SlappyBagg,15,Tue Jul 14 22:51:49 2015 UTC,I like this Wilbekin kid.  He can shoot and looks decent passing.
sixers,3db2or,thisisnotme12244,3,Tue Jul 14 22:49:37 2015 UTC,Just what we need
sixers,3db2or,mattk225,3,Tue Jul 14 22:53:06 2015 UTC,scottie > ish
sixers,3db2or,danielsilva12345,11,Wed Jul 15 00:19:31 2015 UTC,"So Wilbekin made the team, right?"
sixers,3db2or,gerrybertier,11,Tue Jul 14 23:19:17 2015 UTC,Alright I'm sold I want Wilbekin
sixers,3db2or,marwels23,9,Tue Jul 14 23:39:43 2015 UTC,Keep wilbekin
sixers,3db2or,ImmortalSanderCohen,10,Tue Jul 14 23:39:10 2015 UTC,Can Okafor dunk?
sixers,3db2or,gerrybertier,7,Tue Jul 14 23:47:40 2015 UTC,I think his legs are pretty dead. He seems tired af.
sixers,3db2or,amanoob,10,Tue Jul 14 23:49:53 2015 UTC,Where are the Chip Kelly smoothies??
sixers,3db2or,davidcroda,9,Tue Jul 14 23:50:55 2015 UTC,He is saving them all for Bradford.
sixers,3db2or,amanoob,3,Tue Jul 14 23:51:30 2015 UTC,Seriously tho he's been getting swatted.  Need him to go two hand jammin' like shaq did.
sixers,3db2or,gerrybertier,8,Tue Jul 14 23:54:24 2015 UTC,I'm likin wilbekin
sixers,3db2or,ImmortalSanderCohen,9,Tue Jul 14 22:51:36 2015 UTC,I WANT WILBEKIN. Hes a SNIPER
sixers,3db2or,noeltojoel,9,Tue Jul 14 23:03:56 2015 UTC,SCOTTIE WILBEKIN IS A COLD BLOODED BADASS
sixers,3db2or,gerrybertier,8,Tue Jul 14 23:39:42 2015 UTC,Fuck the knicks
sixers,3db2or,ank1613,8,Tue Jul 14 22:12:54 2015 UTC,MSG Broadcast is so biased lol they just BITTER!
sixers,3db2or,gerrybertier,8,Tue Jul 14 22:21:38 2015 UTC,So does Wilbekin actually have a chance on the team? If he can do this shooting he'll actually be valuable.
sixers,3db2or,marwels23,3,Tue Jul 14 22:51:41 2015 UTC,He's a pretty good defender too
sixers,3db2or,SlappyBagg,8,Tue Jul 14 22:59:11 2015 UTC,"Wilbekins got a nice stroke, he has an opportunity here"
sixers,3db2or,ImmortalSanderCohen,10,Tue Jul 14 23:04:42 2015 UTC,Wilbekin time to show us ur clutch free throw shooting
sixers,3db2or,davidcroda,5,Tue Jul 14 23:37:27 2015 UTC,And he can't miss!!!!
sixers,3db2or,davidcroda,6,Tue Jul 14 23:38:59 2015 UTC,"I understand that he is shooting the lights out, but Wilbekin's passing ability is really impressing me. He is a very underrated passer for being a scoring point guard, i'm impressed."
sixers,3db2or,Slim91292,3,Tue Jul 14 23:04:49 2015 UTC,after this game i think he has a spot on our roster  he has been killing it all SL  EDIT: 6-6 holy shit
sixers,3db2or,The-Stev,6,Tue Jul 14 23:18:29 2015 UTC,"Sampson and Tokoto are the 2 worst players out there. I understand picking JP where he was, worth a shot, but he is atrocious. He'd have to a PG in this league because he can't shoot and has no size. Yet he has no bball IQ to be a PG. Career D-leaguer"
sixers,3db2or,troublewill,6,Tue Jul 14 23:06:25 2015 UTC,I'm more alarmed at Sampson being so bad
sixers,3db2or,SlappyBagg,5,Tue Jul 14 23:16:23 2015 UTC,Knicks leave him wide open for 3's because he bricks them all. Guy's horrible.
sixers,3db2or,etched_chaos,5,Tue Jul 14 23:18:48 2015 UTC,Okafor is gonna get fouled so much this season
sixers,3db2or,SlappyBagg,5,Tue Jul 14 22:35:39 2015 UTC,"""I like playing against great players like him (Okafor)"" - Porzingas"
sixers,3db2or,ACPhila,4,Tue Jul 14 22:37:20 2015 UTC,Ugh. Wilbekin finds Tokoto nicely only for him to butcher the layup
sixers,3db2or,mattk225,8,Tue Jul 14 23:18:46 2015 UTC,I LOVE WILBEKIN
sixers,3db2or,mattk225,3,Tue Jul 14 23:19:19 2015 UTC,They are playing him more tonight.  Guess he is impressing enough in games to warrant more of a look.
sixers,3db2or,thisisnotme12244,2,Tue Jul 14 22:49:41 2015 UTC,Jesus he is on fire
sixers,3db2or,thisisnotme12244,3,Tue Jul 14 22:55:04 2015 UTC,"Wait, what? Why was the other thread deleted?"
sixers,3db2or,OnAWhale,3,Tue Jul 14 23:19:28 2015 UTC,It's just spam to promote that stream.
sixers,3db2or,rahbee33,3,Tue Jul 14 22:12:20 2015 UTC,Yep. Same dude that did it for the Celtics game too.
sixers,3db2or,davidcroda,2,Tue Jul 14 22:17:47 2015 UTC,"So because it's not the stream you want to link, it's spam? Even though they had it up when the game started and yours was like twenty minutes late? Gotcha...."
sixers,3db2or,davidcroda,2,Tue Jul 14 22:27:44 2015 UTC,"No, its spam because it's a new account posting links to the same website and only that on every single basketball sub imaginable.   That's the very definition of spam..."
sixers,3db2or,SlappyBagg,5,Tue Jul 14 22:36:01 2015 UTC,Fair enough I was just pissy because I was talking to myself for like ten minutes lol
sixers,3db2or,OnAWhale,3,Tue Jul 14 22:51:25 2015 UTC,Yeah that's my bad. I forgot to drop a link to the new thread in the comments there.
sixers,3db2or,Nigel_No_Mates,3,Tue Jul 14 23:05:13 2015 UTC,Comment thread is dead today
sixers,3db2or,mattk225,3,Tue Jul 14 23:08:34 2015 UTC,"A thread was deleted that had 40 comments through the first quarter, probably a result of that"
sixers,3db2or,SlappyBagg,3,Tue Jul 14 23:16:49 2015 UTC,just got to work. Whack hours these games. 9.25am here.
sixers,3db2or,ACPhila,4,Tue Jul 14 23:18:56 2015 UTC,PHIL JACKSON IS PAYING THE REFS!!!
sixers,3db2or,marwels23,4,Tue Jul 14 23:24:32 2015 UTC,"The only time okafor misses in the post is when he gets his shot blocked, happens quite often though"
sixers,3db2or,ACPhila,4,Tue Jul 14 23:29:47 2015 UTC,I am totally nit picking but Oak has to not get his shot blocked so much
sixers,3db2or,sokrazyitmightwork,2,Tue Jul 14 23:30:36 2015 UTC,"nah I think it's definitely a concern. But I guess we'll see in the NBA. I'm sure there's a stat out there of % of successful post-ups, could see how that is"
sixers,3db2or,davidcroda,2,Tue Jul 14 23:32:07 2015 UTC,It's not that concerning because half the guys guarding him would have fouled out and couldn't be as aggressive
sixers,3db2or,sokrazyitmightwork,7,Tue Jul 14 23:41:30 2015 UTC,Okafor just looked a little worn down at the end. Definitely something that can improve before the season starts.   This was the first game I was able to watch start to finish and I was blown away by his dominance early on. I also thought jakaar and wilbekin looked impressive.
sixers,3db2or,OnAWhale,6,Tue Jul 14 23:48:54 2015 UTC,You thought JaKarr played well? You know he's a second-year player right?
sixers,3db2or,OnAWhale,2,Tue Jul 14 23:52:24 2015 UTC,Maybe I wasn't paying attention I just thought he looked good for how raw he was
sixers,3db2or,mattk225,3,Tue Jul 14 23:54:15 2015 UTC,Holy shit what a pass
sixers,3db2or,SlappyBagg,3,Wed Jul 15 00:11:57 2015 UTC,lol Okafor is straight up shutting down Porzingis. When he's guarding him he can't get the ball
sixers,3db2or,SlappyBagg,3,Tue Jul 14 22:15:10 2015 UTC,Chuckie is the man
sixers,3db2or,SlappyBagg,3,Tue Jul 14 22:20:22 2015 UTC,McConnell is balling!
sixers,3db2or,Darth__Nader,3,Tue Jul 14 22:55:31 2015 UTC,"Such a travel by Grant, not that we should have let it get that far."
sixers,3db2or,ACPhila,3,Tue Jul 14 22:58:45 2015 UTC,So many turnovers
sixers,3db2or,ACPhila,2,Tue Jul 14 23:35:20 2015 UTC,Oakafloor!
sixers,3db2or,davidcroda,2,Tue Jul 14 23:44:27 2015 UTC,"Okafor gotta go to his left a little bit more, otherwise he looks amazing..."
sixers,3db2or,ACPhila,2,Tue Jul 14 22:07:37 2015 UTC,"Okafor just has some unteachable ability. Im convinced post moves, you just cant teach them you either have them or you dont."
sixers,3db2or,BrentoMussolini,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:24:18 2015 UTC,I'm sure it's one of the first things they will work on but he has to take it a lot stronger to the hole on anything within 5 ft of the rim or he's going to get thrown so hard. Love his footwork though
sixers,3db2or,Slim91292,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:32:31 2015 UTC,hes also 19

sixers,3db2or,gerrybertier,2,Tue Jul 14 23:24:24 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that's just in double overtime
sixers,3db2or,davidcroda,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:30:33 2015 UTC,"You're right, they just said it on air. I still want to see that though."

sixers,3d9hyn,rahbee33,11,Tue Jul 14 16:01:52 2015 UTC,The flat-top to flat-top connection could be a beautiful GIF

sixers,3d9hyn,superslayer44,6,Tue Jul 14 16:59:51 2015 UTC,Shump cut his off tho. It's dreaded now
sixers,3d9hyn,YoungAI,7,Tue Jul 14 17:55:16 2015 UTC,That must've been recent... I mean the finals werent that long ago.
sixers,3d9hyn,superslayer44,28,Tue Jul 14 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"If anyone can carry us to the promise land, it's Two-time Champion Norris Cole."
sixers,3d9hyn,DramDemon,8,Tue Jul 14 15:36:27 2015 UTC,The real backbone of the Heat. Lebron and Wade did nothing!
sixers,3d9hyn,secret_economist,7,Tue Jul 14 16:31:51 2015 UTC,Its the flattop.
sixers,3d9hyn,superslayer44,4,Tue Jul 14 17:01:16 2015 UTC,They were just riding his coattails since they knew he would be a two-time Champion.
sixers,3d9hyn,DramDemon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:41:42 2015 UTC,I can confirm
sixers,3d9hyn,BerryMcockner,21,Sat Jul 18 08:44:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty much what we need at the moment. A stop gap pg who can throw entry passes, defend well and shoot the three."
sixers,3d9hyn,SlappyBagg,14,Tue Jul 14 16:03:30 2015 UTC,Would love to get Norris. He's the cousin of Trent Cole btw.

sixers,3d9hyn,southerngangster,2,Tue Jul 14 18:16:56 2015 UTC,Looks like a skinny angry Trent Cole too
sixers,3d9hyn,ArthurRiot,11,Tue Jul 14 20:05:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone assumes that we'll try to bid for him instead of trading for him. But trading for him is a possibility, too.  It seems like a solid move so that we have a pg for now, who may not be a pg of the future."
sixers,3d9hyn,Zeno84,6,Wed Jul 15 00:02:44 2015 UTC,"I like the idea. Price won't stop us from making any future moves, but a solid presence who can fill the role for now. If the lotto balls fall that we end up with like Kris Dunn next year, still a good pairing for a rookie."
sixers,3d9hyn,Zeno84,6,Tue Jul 14 15:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think we're getting at the point where we need to keep our top prospects happy (e.g. Okafor and Noel), so putting some NBA level talent around them--even if they're basically journeymen--is not a bad idea."
sixers,3d9hyn,xychosis,7,Tue Jul 14 15:43:27 2015 UTC,Exactly. I would hate to impede Jah's progress because of a lack of NBA ability with someone like TJ
sixers,3d9hyn,iloveopenbar,9,Tue Jul 14 15:44:50 2015 UTC,"Yo, this wouldn't be a bad pickup for us. Not a world-beater, but certainly better than starting Isaiah Canaan."
sixers,3d9hyn,Phogify,6,Tue Jul 14 15:46:34 2015 UTC,a point guard who can defend? yes please! haven't had one of those since mcw  oh and he can hit an open 3? even better.
sixers,3d9hyn,chukinthebuket,5,Tue Jul 14 17:12:41 2015 UTC,He's a below average 3pt shooter
sixers,3d9hyn,superslayer44,3,Tue Jul 14 17:19:41 2015 UTC,I don't see how he's any better than who we've already got.
sixers,3d9hyn,chukinthebuket,4,Tue Jul 14 20:00:02 2015 UTC,He isn't Canaan.
sixers,3d9hyn,superslayer44,3,Tue Jul 14 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"He's pretty much Ish Smith.  Been there, done that."
sixers,3d9hyn,MatCauthonsHat,8,Tue Jul 14 17:02:22 2015 UTC,He's like Ish but better. He's learned from better player and has better experience.
sixers,3d9hyn,superslayer44,2,Tue Jul 14 17:16:29 2015 UTC,"He's like Ish but better.   How is he better than Ish?  A slightly better shooter, but that is about all."
sixers,3d9hyn,chukinthebuket,2,Tue Jul 14 17:37:33 2015 UTC,"Like I said, better experience. He has played with LeBron, Dwade and Anthony Davis. The man knows what good basketball looks like and how good basketball is played. With the right developement of our young players, I think he would be a pretty good asset."
sixers,3d9hyn,MatCauthonsHat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:06:50 2015 UTC,"The man knows what good basketball looks like and how good basketball is played.   Just because he played with those other dudes, he's automatically an improvement?  Random Player>Canaan isn't reason enough to sign them.  Fact is the dude really isn't better than what we've got or what we had next year, and I don't see anything he could give us that McConnell or Jackson can't for less money."
sixers,3d9hyn,superslayer44,-1,Tue Jul 14 18:09:07 2015 UTC,"The man knows what good basketball looks like and how good basketball is played.   Then Norris Cole and I have some things in common.  Both of us know what good basketball looks like.  Both of us know how good basketball is played.   But neither of us can do it.    Norris Cole may have seen it, but he ain't it.  He is no better than Ish or Canaan."
sixers,3d9hyn,Malephic,3,Tue Jul 14 18:15:14 2015 UTC,It is good for a young team. I have a feeling you don't know basketball as well as Norris Cole.
sixers,3d9hyn,SlappyBagg,3,Tue Jul 14 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"He played 20 minutes on a championship squad. It's not a matter of him being good, it's about him not being awful. Say what you will about him, he's definitely an NBA player. I don't know that you can say that about any of our other PGs."
sixers,3d9hyn,MatCauthonsHat,3,Tue Jul 14 19:33:57 2015 UTC,I can't see how you think that. Ish and Canaan are way below average.
sixers,3d9hyn,chukinthebuket,2,Tue Jul 14 20:21:27 2015 UTC,So is Norris Cole.    Numbers for Ish and Cole this year
sixers,3d9hyn,PHLHomer,2,Tue Jul 14 17:17:48 2015 UTC,So is Norris Cole
sixers,3d9hyn,JDubKilla,3,Tue Jul 14 18:06:18 2015 UTC,I would think the Pelicans would match unless our offer is absurd.
sixers,3d9hyn,superslayer44,5,Tue Jul 14 18:11:36 2015 UTC,"...Which, knowing Hinkie, it won't be. But who knows? He would certainly fit the mold and give us some depth and defense. I just find it amusing that the Process has made me view a 26-year-old player as ""old"" haha"

Only 2 years left on his contract. Maybe Hinkie will invest while this asset has a low value..?"
sixers,3d9hyn,goodatbeinggood,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:52:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think Lawson is going anywhere now. Since his trade value has plummeted, he's more valuable for the Nuggets on the court... they'd get like 20 cents on the dollar back for him. They would have to be looking to basically Josh Smith him, and even if that happens, I doubt that Brett Brown wants him in the locker room even if Hinkie is intrigued by the value."
sixers,3d9hyn,Skibibbles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:11:35 2015 UTC,"Supposedly they're considering waving him. Their owners are straight up embracing the tank idk if u remember the instance where Lawson and other vets wanted to play, the coach wanted them to play but ownership said no. I still think they will try to trade him but will get very little, I would be shocked if it was a first. He's dope though, DUIs aside. I say through a protected second rounder and download uber on his phone"
sixers,3d9hyn,davidcroda,2,Wed Jul 15 03:18:06 2015 UTC,I would fucking love this move. Nice 3 and D guy who can give solid entry passes to Noel and Okafor. We don't need much more right now.

sixers,3dad9a,dab2525,0,Wed Jul 15 17:50:24 2015 UTC,He wasn't hot garbage the other night - he was actually kind of dominant. Sumner league dominant but still. JaKarr had come a long way - I'm rooting for him if for no other reason but to give our staff a win.

Like I said, I appreciate the fact that you care enough about the team to take time out of your day to write about them. I also live in a place that lacks any Sixers fans and I do find this is a place to get of ether to talk about all sorts of things involving this team.

sixers,3ddtyc,theLgndKllr35,2,Wed Jul 15 15:16:03 2015 UTC,"ignore the folks who dont want to comment on this stuff, dont know why they open the link.   The fact is that this is the situation the team is in and its an extremely likely scenario based on everything we have to go off from the 76ers front office. Pointless topics would include, is grant going to be able to shoot the 3? or will Embiid play next season? Not who is going to be drafted because if you go back to preseason mocks from last year, how many players jumped in to the top 10 that you weren't aware of, Russell was the highest mover then probably Booker, I think Ford had Porzingis high from the year before. Alexander, Harrell, Looney and Oubre fell the most.  Overall it is likely, with 4 potential ping pong balls (PHI/SAC, LAL, MIA), to get the 2nd overall pick, BPA at the moment would make that Skal in my eyes because Simmons is just head and shoulders above everyone.   In my opinion the most obvious trade in that situation would be Noel, but given that he will only have a year left before his QO may hurt his trade value or contrarily be more valuable to Hinkie by giving him more time by not having to commit anyone to a big deal as I am sure Saric will opt out too or just pull a Mirotic. he may improve his trade value himself by showing he can hang with jah (or any othe ball dominant big), increasing his range and by showing he is an elite defender, all would probably push him past the Skal post in terms of overall potential making Skal probably the highest trade value based on those 4 years of rookie scale and all that upside.  If Jah is not going to pull up from the elbow at all this season then the lane is going to be very clogged as Noel is not going to respected from outside the paint. so assuming that Jah has been told not to take jump shots, and he will sooner or later, and that Nerlens will improve over the season the 2 bigs should mature into their positions and roles on the court over the season to make the Skal vs Nerlens debate more accurate. Embiid will be steered well clear of by anyone until he plays at least 20 games and Okafor will still be too soon for Hinkie to release after his first year.   Really interesting going this deep into a rebuild. I guess they must use OKC and the Harden/Ibaka scenario as a case study but now with cap raising twice in these pivotal years for Nerlens and Saric maybe we could see a 5 man rotation at the 4-5 even after all their rookie scales have ended and still have some salary left over for a world beating backcourt.  Still wishing for Simmons, but hes 6'10 aswell, what a player though!"

sixers,3dblg9,jimjones0007,2,Wed Jul 15 10:07:28 2015 UTC,His conditioning is weak because getting injured before the draft is a huge risk. Players tend to do the workouts required to get drafted and not much else.  He'll get in better shape and a touch more explosive and those block shots wont be half the issue they were vs. the Knicks
sixers,3dblg9,throwaweight7,9,Wed Jul 15 07:39:10 2015 UTC,"If he shoots, say, 48% on 18-22 FGA, would you care how many times he gets blocked?  TO is a different story, but I don't care about getting blocked.   He should focus on FT and TO."
sixers,3dblg9,lilgodboy,2,Wed Jul 15 19:49:27 2015 UTC,"Okafor will be a disaster if he shoots 48% without a dramatic spike in his FT%. Like, not worth giving the ball to. That would give him a similar scoring efficiency to T-Rob, Chuck Hayes, JJ Hickson and other scrubs.   Barring huge improvement from the line, Jah needs to shoot around 55% (which would give around a league-average efficiency, which isn't even impressive). If you can't make threes or FTs, you better fucking shoot a high percentage from the floor."
sixers,3dblg9,modestlife,5,Wed Jul 15 00:49:15 2015 UTC,Boogie shot like 43% his rookie year. I see no way that Okafor will be close to 50% with all the touches he'll get. My guess would be around 45%.
sixers,3dblg9,lilgodboy,2,Wed Jul 15 01:03:24 2015 UTC,"Then Okafor will be a terribly inefficient scorer, just as Boogie was."
sixers,3dblg9,ChickenLiverNuts,8,Wed Jul 15 04:12:43 2015 UTC,He has been getting blocked a lot but mostly at the end of games when he is tired.  Continuing to adapt to NBA shape will help him a lot hopefully because if it doesn't this is far more concerning to me than his defensive deficiencies.
sixers,3dblg9,LRW35,7,Wed Jul 15 06:47:03 2015 UTC,"We shouldnt be too critical. For the most part, when he had 1v1 matchups he was a monster and unstoppable. Im not sure you can put any player in the nba in his place that would have more success in that kind of traffic.  When hes conditioned, when hes got guys like RoCo and NikRox on the floor with him, when we build a little familiarity and continuity, when he stops hesitating to take mid ranged js, he'll be fine.  We are over analyzing the hell out of him right now."

sixers,3dblg9,The-Stev,8,Wed Jul 15 01:17:15 2015 UTC,He has to work on it but part of it is conditioning and the other part is guys stay aggressive after having 6-7 fouls when normally they'd be out of the game or much more conservative. Kristops had 7 fouls in 28 minutes that's not close to being good
sixers,3dblg9,TrueSixersFan717,3,Wed Jul 15 01:07:08 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say this. The good defensive players in summer league, and there are some good shot blockers in Upshaw, Black and Kristaps, had no fear of fouling a poor ft shooter and being kicked out of the game.

sixers,3dblg9,LeM1stre,3,Wed Jul 15 01:38:52 2015 UTC,im honestly not very worried about it. he was clearly tired and wasnt using his body to dominate people like he was early in the game. turnovers are something that plenty of rookies struggle with and i dont really think it will be a longterm problem with him. he is a very patient player and once he settles into his role on this team the turnovers will dip.

sixers,3dblg9,levenger,3,Wed Jul 15 02:08:02 2015 UTC,"Post scorers are going to get a fair share of shots blocked, especially the ones who can't jump out the gym. Cousins leads the league with around 2 blocked attempts a game, and Pekovic and Monroe are in the top 9. Z-Bo is among the leaders.   Okafor is going to have to adjust and get in better shape, but it's also part of life for guys who work out of the pivot. Get used to it."
sixers,3dblg9,andhily,3,Wed Jul 15 03:50:02 2015 UTC,"A few things:    Conditioning, like everyone says.  Isn't elevating late in games. Post up big men get blocked a lot.  Just a fact of life.  You're going up against long, tall men.  It's unavoidable. He has a low release point.  He needs to work on that.  I'm sure he will. Lack of spacing.  Weakside shot blockers don't need to worry about Kazemi/Charles Jackson/etc. This will be better with our regular guys."
sixers,3dblg9,JiveTurkey92,2,Wed Jul 15 12:23:37 2015 UTC,Did I miss something? Is he getting his shots swatted now with concerning frequency?
sixers,3dblg9,RkyAzure,2,Wed Jul 15 04:02:26 2015 UTC,I think some of it has to do with his lack of confidence as a free throw shooter. It's like a mental block thing where he doesn't go up as hard as he should so he doesn't get sent to the line to miss shots.  I feel like Nerlens started attacking the rim way more once he hit his FT stride.  The only thing that Jahlil should be focused on right now is his FT's. If some of his shots get blocked it happens it's the NBA but he is leaving some serious points on the line. If Brett Brown gets him up to like 70% he might average 22/23ppg as a rookie.
sixers,3dblg9,stringbrean,2,Wed Jul 15 04:45:20 2015 UTC,"i'm not too concerned about turnovers for rookies in summer league, like russell...his blocked shots, i mean two came from Kristap who is HUGE, one was an incredible play by the knicks dude on the ""dunk attempt"" ...then the laker game, Larry Nance came by on help defense to block a shot. 1 on 1 Okafor will get his, and once he becomes comfortable playing on the team and learn his teammates, he'll be able to pass out of double teams easily."
sixers,3dblg9,ACPhila,2,Wed Jul 15 04:43:48 2015 UTC,"I just watched the game and the combination of Porzingis reach and lack of explosiveness contributed to the blocked shots which was nothing we didn't know about. Once he shoots better free throws he should draw the foul instead which will decrease his blocked attempts although it will happen to all big men who post up alot.  The turnovers you can live with because he's 19 and still adjusting to the game. Judging by the patience he has with the ball, he'll cut down on turnovers but remember he's getting doubled a lot at points of the game and will make mistakes.  I feel like a small portion of this sub takes for granted some of the things he does well and expects him to be a 20-10 guy at 35 mpg when he enters the league when that's unrealistic (look at Towns, Russell, and Porzingis.) Sure he's not immune to criticism and is not by any means a complete player but I can't remember the last time we had someone who could be the focal point of the offense (MCW was the last one I remember) and be able to dominate his match-up for stretches of the game. Remember Noel and his brick hands in the beginning of the year and almost limited to put-back dunks? He made huge progress and Okafor will too. Let's wait until summer league finishes before overanalyzing him.  With that being said, the team is missing Holmes so bad right now. Kazemi is so useless on offense..."
sixers,3dblg9,stringbrean,2,Wed Jul 15 04:46:51 2015 UTC,I like the tone of this post.  What I am learning is that post players get shots blocked way more than I thought.  I suspect we haven't had a post player in so long that I'd forgotten.
sixers,3dblg9,stringbrean,0,Wed Jul 15 06:58:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, he's 19.  No, he's not yet in NBA shape.  Sure, he'll improve as his conditioning improves.  But . . . if we are being honest, he looks like a guy that could lead the league in getting his shot blocked, and until he improves his ball skills facing the basket, he is going to be turnover prone.  Does everyone see these things?  How easy or difficult will it be for Okafor to improve or fix these seeming problems?"
sixers,3dblg9,Baked_Bt,4,Wed Jul 15 07:16:49 2015 UTC,"developing a 10 foot jumper will force defenders to respect his shot and not play off him knowing he's just gonna drive/back them down. I think that, along with improving his foul shooting, is very doable. You can't make yourself more athletic, he's going to get blocked, but getting in better shape as you said will also help."
sixers,3dblg9,skOzy,3,Wed Jul 15 07:22:34 2015 UTC,You actually can get more athletic and he will he's not gonna be Noel but he'll get more athletic and stronger
sixers,3dblg9,FleetwoodMatt,3,Wed Jul 15 00:28:24 2015 UTC,yea i mean leaping and quickness are never going to be his strengths but i think his skill that he already has along with the skills he will be able to refine show that his floor is a solid starter for a long time
sixers,3dblg9,nikitos1979,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:35:07 2015 UTC,An extra pump fake might be needed to avoid blocks.  He seems bright enough to learn that - and I assume it is being drilled in his head during film sessions.
sixers,3dblg9,FleetwoodMatt,4,Wed Jul 15 01:20:05 2015 UTC,"thats also why developing even a short jumper will be so important for him, it makes his pump fake more effective"
sixers,3d8u3p,sam_cooke,12,Tue Jul 14 12:10:14 2015 UTC,The comparison to Phoenix made me feel pretty happy that we're not Phoenix.  I don't care about competing for one-and-done playoff spots. We've been there and have done that.  I'm in this for the long haul. If after five years we have nothing to show for it then I'll talk about changing course.
sixers,3d8u3p,Zeno84,5,Tue Jul 14 12:38:37 2015 UTC,Philly’s owners trust a process they can shape more than “normal” teams like Phoenix will ever be able to shape free agency or the trade market.   I like this summary from the end of the article. I'm with you: glad we're not casting our fate to the wind.
sixers,3d8u3p,FleetwoodMatt,10,Tue Jul 14 12:49:46 2015 UTC,"Quite simply, it's worth the wait.  I've only gotten to experience 2008 once in my lifetime; I want a few more moments like that."
sixers,3d8u3p,Zeno84,2,Tue Jul 14 14:27:15 2015 UTC,One of the greatest moments of my life :)
sixers,3d8u3p,neilarmsloth,9,Tue Jul 14 14:29:49 2015 UTC,"If Philly is really willing to do this for five, six, or seven seasons, it almost cannot fail. It will either land a superstar or draft so many good players that they will gather a solid NBA team. Brett Brown may check himself into an asylum before then, but if you keep getting lottery picks, you will eventually succeed.   What's the alternative at this point? If a championship is the goal, the only real solution is to trust the process. Keep gathering assets and making smart trades that give a positive, long-term return over a short-term boost. Trading assets for a superstar will only work if we already have a 6-8 seed base with developing players and a secondary if not tertiary star."
sixers,3d8u3p,ImJustAMan,4,Wed Jul 15 07:07:13 2015 UTC,"What's the alternative at this point?   Pretty much what Phoenix did / what we did for 10 years prior to Hinkie. I prefer the Hinkie route, but if this does go on for 3+ more seasons, I wouldn't be surprised if public outcry / declining profits push the higher-ups to start demanding a playoff push."
sixers,3d8u3p,ioio-,2,Tue Jul 14 14:56:38 2015 UTC,"Well this will be the third year in a row that we will be a bottom 5 team in the league. I think next offseason is when Hinkie makes his ""James Harden"" move and we really start to compete."
sixers,3d8u3p,Halfonion,2,Tue Jul 14 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"Hinkie would have made a ""James Harden move"" on day one if it was possible."
sixers,3d8u3p,lilgodboy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"I dont necessarily think thats the case. We didnt have any assests when he started as the GM and we had to tank hard to aquire what we've got (both through the draft and shrewd cap absorbing trades). This off season or even last off season he could have made a deal for an elite player but he knows it takes more than one all-star to win a championship. Now that we have a core of young, high ceiling big men, it would make more sense to bring in an elite guard in the next two years than any point in the past."
sixers,3d8u3p,Halfonion,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:47:43 2015 UTC,"You're right that Philly didn't have the assets to acquire that kind of player when Hinkie took over. But I have no doubt whatsoever that he would have tried to scoop up an elite young player like Harden. There's no way you let that kind of rare opportunity pass because you're worried he'll make the team too good, too fast. But there are very, very few Hardens."
sixers,3d8u3p,lilgodboy,5,Tue Jul 14 21:35:25 2015 UTC,"So, whose agent do you think is trying to get them out of Philly?"
sixers,3d8u3p,ToxtethOGrady,8,Tue Jul 14 22:26:30 2015 UTC,The only player who makes any sense to me is Tony Wroten. He might see himself has a 6th man on a playoff team
sixers,3d8u3p,intoxxx,3,Tue Jul 14 13:01:03 2015 UTC,What about KJ last year?
sixers,3d8u3p,colemanj74,5,Tue Jul 14 13:50:49 2015 UTC,Yea KJ probably wanted to go but look how well that worked out for him.
sixers,3d8u3p,zigzagzil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:54:34 2015 UTC,"So hard to tell. I have a few guesses: 1) Wroten--could see him thinking he could be a great piece on a contender, and his crazy Randy Johnson passes would work with better teammates. 2) Covington--he could legitmately be a piece on a contending team, so I guess I could see him wanting to be a part of something bigger. Probably isn't in love with his contract either so may have wished he had gotten a shorter deal and has some animosity towards Hink. 3) Noel--this is the worst case scenario, but he sees Embiid, Saric, and now Oak get a lot of love from management and none of them have even played a game while he has kind of become the brushed aside story when he feels like he can become a star in the league. (I really, really hope this isn't the case)."
sixers,3d8u3p,JDubKilla,4,Tue Jul 14 14:02:12 2015 UTC,The Covington one would surprise me. The Sixers basically gave him his first real shot at being in the league.
sixers,3d8u3p,colemanj74,5,Tue Jul 14 15:16:02 2015 UTC,"My subreddit flair notwithstanding, I really doubt it's Wroten. He seems really excited about what's being built here, and seems to be close with the guys (especially JoJo, if that FaceTime screen grab is any indication). Same goes for Covington. He might become more disgruntled with his contract as time goes on, but I'm pretty confident he's just happy to have the chance to show he belongs. Could very well be Landry's agent, or even skullduggery from Thomas Robinson's agent back before he bought into the system. Lowe conveniently refuses to give us a timestamp on the conversation, so I'm going to take that with a grain of salt."
sixers,3d8u3p,zigzagzil,-1,Tue Jul 14 15:56:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure why you're so confident re: Covington. He's a fantastic shooter and has already shown he belongs. I think he's going to be a great fit in our offense this year w Oak and Noel, but I can't just assume he is happy to be a part of the rebuilding part."
sixers,3d8u3p,colemanj74,5,Tue Jul 14 15:34:18 2015 UTC,He was a D-Leaguer until basically December of last year. Pretty sure he was happy to get a real shot in the league as a starter.
sixers,3d8u3p,zigzagzil,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:39:05 2015 UTC,"Of course he was. He also probably thought he could play in the league and be valuable (he was right). Now that he's shown that, is it really out of the realm of possibility that he wants to play for a more competitive team? He may get less minutes elsewhere, but it wouldn't be a KJ situation--he would be really valuable for some good teams out there (Clippers, Memphis, Washington, Atlanta, etc.)."
sixers,3d8u3p,colemanj74,6,Tue Jul 14 16:00:02 2015 UTC,"No of course, it's very reasonable. But the problem is, do you really think he was asking for his agent to get him out of Philly after two months of pretty good play?"
sixers,3d8u3p,chukinthebuket,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:09:22 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, I was just hypothesizing which of our players he could have been referring to. It makes no sense to assume it was someone like Jakarr. It was ""agents"" too, so it wasn't only one dude.  He never states that the players themselves requested anything, but agents were asking around. Obviously agents act on behalf of players, but there is a distinction there. I wonder if it's a case of agents preferring to deal with other teams more than players are actively trying to leave here."
sixers,3d8u3p,DerekBodner,3,Tue Jul 14 16:12:42 2015 UTC,"Why is it that when we try to build through the draft, we get ""The draft is a crapshoot.  How do you know it's going to work?"".  But when Phoenix signs Tyson Chandler...   The final year of Chandler’s deal could be ugly, but he’ll mentor Len, and Len’s presence will allow Hornacek to sit Chandler 10 or 15 games per season."
sixers,3d8u3p,chukinthebuket,3,Tue Jul 14 16:41:18 2015 UTC,"He did say that the Sixers were taking the course to limit luck as much as possible.     Few teams have tried to minimize the role of luck as thoroughly as the Sixers, who don’t appear interested in any team-building path they can’t control almost completely."

sixers,3d9a6d,ZeroCool79,6,Tue Jul 14 14:33:57 2015 UTC,I don't get why people think Noel and Okafor can't play together. Are they writing these articles in Sacramento after drafting WCS?
sixers,3d9a6d,throwaweight7,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:45:27 2015 UTC,"While their play styles complement each other well, my big worry is offensively because you have two guys who can only work 15ft in so what would stop teams from doubling Okafor when Nerlens doesn't stretch the floor."
sixers,3d9a6d,eagsrock20,3,Tue Jul 14 15:56:03 2015 UTC,Okafor can just dump it off to Noel though. We've already seen plenty of examples in the SL of him being able to handle doubles.

sixers,3daauw,dinolarry,6,Tue Jul 14 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"It's ""passable"" to the point where he's not a liability on that end, probably closer to bad than good. Danny Green is one of the better perimeter defenders in the league, I highly doubt Hollis ever gets to that level."
sixers,3daauw,themightypooperscoop,3,Tue Jul 14 19:09:05 2015 UTC,Hollis has 1-2 years left on his contract. There's no chance he becomes a lockdown defender in time for us to trade him.

Marcus Smart doesn't appear to be anything more than an average defensive hustler off the bench. Ty Lawson has shown what he is and we can't move forward with him. None of them are worth even thinking about. Neither is Norris Cole, but he is no worse than the others, the only guy even worth remotely considering from your list is Smart, and that's only in the hope that he drastically develops under Brett Brown.

sixers,3dbzi2,Yanns,-1,Thu Jul 16 04:14:25 2015 UTC,Marcus Smart doesn't appear to be anything more than an average defensive hustler off the bench.    Have you ever watched him play and not just browse box score stats?
sixers,3dbzi2,b3diddy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:48:21 2015 UTC,"If I had just browsed box scores I wouldn't know he could play defense. Be honest with yourself, his ceiling is Jameer Nelson."

sixers,3dbzi2,b3diddy,0,Wed Jul 15 15:53:10 2015 UTC,"It really isn't.  Okafor has played 4 summer league games. We have a full season of Smart to evaluate, and he didn't show a whole lot... Unless youre a blind Boston homer there isn't about to be excited about."
sixers,3dbzi2,Yanns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:16:38 2015 UTC,"Smart showed plenty last year while playing through the year with a nagging ankle injury. He is already a great defender and has the potential to be near Tony Allen level, his 3 point shot improved a lot, and his TS% was 49%, not great, but only 3% lower than Jordan Clarkson who many Lakers fans cream their pants about. Not only do advanced statistics love Smart, more than almost any other 2014 draftee, he does many things that don't show up in the box score, such as defensive pressure, taking charges, etc. He also greatly improved as a passer over the course of the season. So yeah, I don't think he'll be a perennial All-star, but he could make an ASG or two and be a mainstay on All-Defensive team lists. That's a lot higher upside than Jameer Nelson."

Trey is a score first guard that once he gets is shot falling can also turn to passing. Right now his shot isn't falling so all the defense has to worry about is him passing. If he can be on a team with a really good front court, like the 76ers, and a former college teammate he will shine."
sixers,3dbzi2,pepesilvia___,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:39 2015 UTC,I think both Lawson and Jennings are worth way more than Burke and noticeably more than Smart. I would say Lawson over Jennings only slightly due to Lawson's DUI.

sixers,3dbi0y,troublewill,18,Wed Jul 15 00:15:54 2015 UTC,"I think your problem is you don't like old school basketball. Okafor is a blast from the past. We haven't seen a pure back to the basket player come out of the draft in a long time. You see, Okafor even turns down the open FT range jump shot to drive to the basket.  I, on the other hand, LOVE it. We haven't had a player that dominated a specific part of the game since Allen Iverson. We could potentially have that in Okafor, a guy who will demand double teams on a consistent basis throughout his career.  If Stauskas can come up big and shoot like he did @ Michigan, along with the other 3 pt shooters we have, it will be fun to watch.  I am also extremely excited to watch Okafor & Noel play together."
sixers,3dbi0y,vayuu,0,Wed Jul 15 00:08:52 2015 UTC,i have a hard time seeing okafor being efficient enough in the post to warrant a double team in the nba
sixers,3dbi0y,Camus145,7,Wed Jul 15 00:14:26 2015 UTC,"I think Okafor will definitely draw double teams in the NBA, at least against a good number of teams. If he can get a midrange jumper (and kind-of-related his free throws) going consistently he's going to be unstoppable on that end of the floor."
sixers,3dbi0y,rahbee33,3,Wed Jul 15 00:23:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe you're right, maybe you're wrong. Somebody help me out here. What post players currently draw a double team right now in the NBA? Boogie and Anthony Davis certainly draw a lot of help defense. Blake Griffin does sometimes. I can't really think of any others. Maybe Aldridge? Okafor might have to join that kind of company to draw doubles and help defense consistently."
sixers,3dbi0y,vayuu,2,Wed Jul 15 00:35:02 2015 UTC,Marc Gasol  Zach Randolph  Al Horford  Brook  Lopez  Al Jefferson  Nik Vucevic  Dwight  Nikola Pekovic  All those guys get double teamed on a fairly regular basis.
sixers,3dbi0y,marksills,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:04:03 2015 UTC,"the real issue is that it is almost beneficial for an opponent to allow a guy to go one on one in the post over and over again.  for example, dwight while not being a great post player was like 1.2 points per possession against robin lopez in the 2014 payoffs, however the blazers never doubled and allowed him to get as much buckets as he wanted  because it takes everyone else out of rhythm  while tiring him out on D."

His offensive game and the ability to force teams to gameplan for him is the reason he was picked so high. Unless he suddenly learns to block like Howard or shoot from the mid-range, his post dominance is all we have. Give him some time, let's see how he deals with the actual nba"

sixers,3dbi0y,Mmaayyoo,-4,Wed Jul 15 00:14:08 2015 UTC,I'm just saying aesthetics. James Harden is a hell of an offensive player and how he gets to the line consistently is remarkable... but I dislike watching him play.  I like that the ball goes in the basket. I just don't find how the ball goes in the basket all that enjoyable to watch.
sixers,3dbi0y,IVLegacy,-1,Wed Jul 15 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"how well do you know the game of basketball? did you ever play it?  I can kind of understand your perspective because that's the same way I feel about soccer.  Soccer bores the crap out of me.  I never played, never watched it growing up, and I don't appreciate the finer strategies or skills. But I played basketball all through school and I've been a fan of basketball for like 13 years haha so watching Okafor play definitely gets me hyped.  Just a difference in perspective I guess.  Edit: Jeez getting downvoted in a basketball sub because I don't enjoy soccer? Wtf."

sixers,3dbi0y,Xo0om,5,Wed Jul 15 04:16:03 2015 UTC,"Nobody can help you bud. Okafor isn't going to be Russell Westbrook. If I were you, I'd try to understand the logic behind what he does in the post. It's not like he's just randomly bumping guys and throwing his weight around. Consider how he's using leverage and misdirection. ""Exciting"" players like Westbrook, Harden, etc. use these same techniques with quickness, Okafor is just using the strength version. Also look for him to alternate between beating doubles off the pass, and taking extra pivots to get a shot off. If you still think it's boring to watch, I don't know what to tell you."
sixers,3dbi0y,ACPhila,5,Wed Jul 15 00:18:33 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that. Although I enjoy high flying athletes and 3 pointers a lot, my favorite thing to watch is actually big men with nice post moves and footwork.   Don't worry man, during the year you'll have plenty of other guys to watch like Nerlens catching lobs and Roco raining down threes."

sixers,3dbi0y,noeltojoel,2,Wed Jul 15 00:10:35 2015 UTC,Watch the Spurs play with Duncan nothing about Okafor is old or new school it's just more Spurs than warriors
sixers,3dbi0y,The-Stev,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:05:01 2015 UTC,"You have to appreciate Okafor as instant offense. He is an instant/automatic play. He creates the offense. He pursues the low post and looks for an opening or an opportunity and usually gets it because of his IQ and footwork/agility + massiveness and strength, if he gets doubled he looks for the opportunity for others. He's an offensive difference maker, and will still get even greater through the years."
sixers,3dbi0y,faithdies,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:20:56 2015 UTC,"Right now Okafor is all you have to watch. Fingers crossed, you'll have some good players to watch next year. Saric, Embiid, 4 1sts. I'd bet we get at least 1-2 exciting players out of that pool."

On the other hand, I'm terrified that he'll be a liability on defense. Reserving judgment until he's in better shape, although it's made me more appreciative of Nerlens' ability to be everywhere."
sixers,3d5fus,Lyndell,36,Mon Jul 13 17:50:16 2015 UTC,"Every time he speaks, Jah seems like a very driven yet humble young man.  He doesn't brag or boast, he just tells it like it is. As someone who wasn't thrilled with the pick, I'm very happy to see this."

sixers,3d5fus,patelt91,15,Mon Jul 13 22:03:51 2015 UTC,"I was saying this before the draft over and over. When Coach K, the guy who coached a team full of the best NBA players in the world multiple times for the Olympics, calls Okafor  not just a franchise talent but a franchise person, that's a sign of a special human being."
sixers,3d5fus,Xepa,2,Mon Jul 13 22:24:30 2015 UTC,"It's more like half the league, there are tons of childish guards and forwards too."
sixers,3d5fus,Baked_Bt,5,Mon Jul 13 23:19:39 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, are you happier with the pick now that you've seen him play in summer league and know that Embiid needs a second surgery? I felt the same way when he was first drafted, but am coming around to the pick considering the Embiid situation and his performance so far."
sixers,3d5fus,ewyorksockexchange,4,Mon Jul 13 21:50:18 2015 UTC,"I'm much happier to have a phenomenal insurance policy. If Jah can play well, I can see Philadelphia slowly becoming a sleeper destination for FA talent."
sixers,3d5fus,RedHuntingHat,22,Tue Jul 14 02:08:55 2015 UTC,I think LA not picking him was the best thing to happen to him. He's got even more motivation to prove everyone wrong. The guys gonna be awesome for the sixers.
sixers,3d5fus,TheDenverBroncos,-14,Mon Jul 13 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not to mention, with the 76ers he's probably going to have more minutes than if he was with the Lakers. I don't doubt that he'll be traded if he does well though."
sixers,3d5fus,rivera_views,19,Mon Jul 13 21:25:40 2015 UTC,Here we go. Why would he be traded if he does well?

sixers,3d5fus,DariosDentist,-4,Tue Jul 14 04:13:16 2015 UTC,"If he proves his talents slip over to the NBA well, I think a lot of teams would be willing to trade good players for him. The Sixers need guards more than they need a center IMO."
sixers,3d5fus,rivera_views,4,Tue Jul 14 04:35:24 2015 UTC,But if we trade 1 of our 2 real centers for a guard then we will just be stuck needing a center instead of a guard...

sixers,3d5fus,Freak_Fest,0,Tue Jul 14 05:15:11 2015 UTC,Embiid. Even though he hasn't played yet... Ha :/
sixers,3d5fus,rivera_views,-16,Tue Jul 14 06:02:15 2015 UTC,cause the Sixers are trying to tank again
sixers,3d5fus,nikkus,13,Mon Jul 13 22:59:32 2015 UTC,"Trying to tank again?  When the hell did we stop?    Also, we haven't traded any talent guys that fit our actual team going forward.  They want a team built around bigs.  MCW was a shoot first PG, and they want a pass first guy at point.  They traded Jrue Holiday for Noel.  They traded Brandon Davies who wasn't doing anything unique.  They traded Evan Turner who wasn't, and isn't, anything special.    Doesn't make any sense whatsoever to say the Sixers would trade a guy like Okafor when you actually have knowledge about the team and management."
sixers,3d5fus,pumadude321,2,Mon Jul 13 23:20:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said but the fact that MCW was a shoot first PG. If anything I think he is a turnover prone, pass first point guard who's a terrible shooter."
sixers,3d5fus,brodownincrotown,3,Tue Jul 14 01:51:56 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I guess.  Maybe I just saw him as a shoot first PG because he was such a bad shooter, and that stood out to me the most."
sixers,3d5fus,pumadude321,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:54:02 2015 UTC,I think the only reason he shot as much as he did was because he felt he had too. Its not like he had the best talent around him. I think he can be a solid starter with some more experience and better talent around him. Though I still think trading him was the right move for us.
sixers,3d5fus,buc_nasty_69,-1,Tue Jul 14 02:21:29 2015 UTC,Stop making excuses.. he was awful awful awful
sixers,3d5fus,SteveWynn,5,Tue Jul 14 02:45:16 2015 UTC,"Not really making excuses, just saying why I believe he took so many shots. I don't think he has the scoring talent to be a teams first scoring option, which is what he was pretty much forced into being for us."
sixers,3d5fus,buc_nasty_69,2,Tue Jul 14 02:59:48 2015 UTC,Because rookies ever grade out as net positives as it is...
sixers,3d5fus,flyingdeathmachine,14,Mon Jul 13 23:21:18 2015 UTC,"He seems like a ""Spurs player"" to me, and I mean that as a huge compliment. He is driven with a great work ethic, makes intelligent decisions on the court, and doesn't boast. He should achieve ROTY no problem."
sixers,3d5fus,IVLegacy,6,Mon Jul 13 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"Jah and Russell are both talented scorers on teams with not much else. It should be a battle. My money's on Okafor, but I dont know if you can say ""no problem."""
sixers,3d5fus,ImJustAMan,7,Mon Jul 13 19:33:10 2015 UTC,Russell won't be in the ROY race. He has too many gunners on his team and while his passing ability is advanced we saw last year how great you can be at anything but scoring and lose.  I think it'll be between Jah & Mario.

sixers,3d5fus,WalkingThePlanes,2,Mon Jul 13 18:11:33 2015 UTC,I think he should get down 10 or so lbs to start the season. Tone that body up and improve the speed. He'll be a menace

It'd have to be a sign and trade and we're not giving up anything of value for him and we probably won't want him at whatever his contract is going to be. There's a reason the Hinkie Specials (Jakarr, Grant, Hollis) are still on the team and KJ is not."
sixers,3damhy,NikeStanislaus,13,Tue Jul 14 20:32:57 2015 UTC,I don't want his mom back.
sixers,3damhy,RBRTPNG,11,Tue Jul 14 20:14:47 2015 UTC,His mom wasn't nearly as big of a deal as she was made out to be. Outside of the Orlando game where she was up yelling and there was the fan that talked about all the negative stuff she was saying about his teammates. I assume they had a talk with her after that.  Oh and a very small Twitter beef with one of the Liberty Ballers guys.

He showed during his his time with the sixers that he has dynamic athleticism, plays good D and has potential to develop a decent 3 point stroke. He could turn out to be a premier 3 and D guy which is very useful to a team trying to compete."

sixers,3damhy,aumenous,2,Tue Jul 14 23:32:45 2015 UTC,Correct.  You cannot resign a player you traded who was subsequently waived for some period of time I can't remember right now.

At this rate, we will be contending in five years. Why is this freaking everyone out so much? Is it just because Hinkie does not talk to the media?  Edit: Missed a Hinkle"
sixers,3d9a1v,Ignatius_Atreides,5,Tue Jul 14 16:40:34 2015 UTC,Oh look another thinly veiled anti-Sixers piece by Matt Moore.
sixers,3d9a1v,andhily,2,Tue Jul 14 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"Ugh, some issues with this article.   However, say the team had taken Aaron Gordon, who had a lower ceiling than Embiid but very much has looked like an impact NBA player during his rookie season (despite an injury issue that caused him to miss some of the season and the need for a reworked jumper he's displayed already in Summer League this month.)    Aaron Gordon played 17 MPG in 47 games and avged 5 PPG last season. His per 36 #s weren't anything notable.   Or say they had taken Julius Randle, who may not have suffered the freakish leg fracture he suffered last fall with the Lakers.   So a guy who had a known history of leg injuries might not have rebroken his leg if he played for the Sixers? Maybe, who knows? He also might just flat out stink.   Meanwhile, a good coach and a pretty entertaining team will remain stuck in neutral, the process will remain the same, assets will be gathered and the debate will rage on.   That's extremely disingenuous. They have a load of upcoming picks, and pretty much every guy on their roster who plays major minutes is young and on the improving side of the aging curve. Young players tend to get better."

sixers,3d90n8,AndrewHainesArt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:58:18 2015 UTC,Bird rights give the team a player is from the option to give them the most money. Also teams will offer max contracts to pretty much all top FA's.
sixers,3d90n8,ZeroCool79,3,Tue Jul 14 18:13:33 2015 UTC,"I very honestly think, no on Durant.  As for the rest, they'll have to start going after FAs next offseason, probably with not much luck. Bench fillers, maybe 1 starter, but if Saric comes over and assuming at least 1 of our 3/4 firsts pans out, do we need to go that hard in FA? Factor in the possibility (optimist here) that Embiid recovers, too  EDIT: With the ""have to go after FAs"" line, I mean that they have to start drawing fans back and look like they're focused on winning, not that they'll necessarily need FA players to be good.

sixers,3d90n8,ZeroCool79,3,Tue Jul 14 14:30:31 2015 UTC,"Outside of Durant, I think PG Mike Conley is probably the best target for the Sixers, assuming that they'd have any appeal for him. I'm not a huge fan of Brandon Jennings or Eric Gordon, but both could also fit the team pretty well. Among wings, Batum and Gallinari could be targets. If they opt out of their final year, I'd also be interested in DeMar DeRozan and Chandler Parsons.  Among RFAs, I like Bradley Beal, Jordan Clarkson, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Harrison Barnes, and Terrence Ross. Meyers Leonard might also be an interesting target as a stretch 5."

He front rims a lot, but I'd rather have a guy front rim, with a strength problem, than miss wide, with an awful shot. His passing is great, his chemistry with the bigs is great, the guy knows his role on that squad.  He knows he was brought in to be a pass first PG, to pass down low to the bigs. He does it well. On top of that, he hustles every single play. As a Zona fan and Sixers fan, I love him and I know he can, and will, get time this season.  Strength is a non-issue in my book, since all guys work on it all the time. We have until October 27th, the first day of the regular season, for him to build up some strength. No problem for that."
sixers,3d6xh4,pumadude321,2,Tue Jul 14 01:24:07 2015 UTC,"He looks serviceable, but it is only summer league."
sixers,3d6xh4,jjohn268,3,Tue Jul 14 00:42:02 2015 UTC,Thought he did a great job controlling pace.  Was able to get in the lane. Defends the whole court.  What do you think of his distance shooting? Seemed to struggle spotting up.
sixers,3d6xh4,EaglePride101,3,Tue Jul 14 00:26:36 2015 UTC,He's okay but hasn't left much of an impact with me. I'd put him third out of the three on the SL point guard chart.
sixers,3d6xh4,DariosDentist,3,Tue Jul 14 00:43:28 2015 UTC,"I like that he seemed to look for Jahlil more than some of the guards we ran out there in SL, but I was not impressed with his three point game.  At this point, even if we don't re-sign Ish, I'd probably rather go Wroten/Pierre/Cannan at PG."

sixers,3d6xh4,ThaOneNOnly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:48:10 2015 UTC,"Hasn't been great so far at times the offense is really terrible. He makes some good plays, good ball pressure on defense. His shooting has been a disappointment so far. He is not good at creating his own shot and that hurts on this SL team because there aren't any shooters. Right now I don't think he makes the 12 man roster. I think he'd do better if there were some shooters out there for him to pass to so I think it's a little thought to judge"

I'm so glad he's out of the hell that is Sacramento and the fact that it's with MY TEAM is even better.  He's a great shooter, but what made him climb the draft was because he showed an ability to make plays off the dribble once teams ran him off the 3 point line that second year at Michigan. He was the main focus of that offense and still put up 17 PPG."

sixers,3d67be,LRW35,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:14:06 2015 UTC,Well considering that team went to the Final Four Stauskas only has to play better than...McGary? to be considered the best one from that group. Kind of amazing.
sixers,3d67be,chukinthebuket,2,Mon Jul 13 21:14:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think he will this year simply because of his role."
sixers,3d67be,Xepa,3,Mon Jul 13 21:18:42 2015 UTC,"I really hope hes able to put up #'s like this! My cuzzo predicted similar #'s. Someone up top said he'd average RoCo #'s, but hes wayyy more skilled and probably an equal shooter."
sixers,3d67be,rahbee33,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:20:33 2015 UTC,"Seems like you're higher on him than most.  I keep hearing a lot of people kinda meh over him.  I sort of was too, until I watched a few highlights (I'll admit, not the best judge of a player) and thought he was pretty much a JJ Reddick type until I saw he actually has a pretty decent handle, and didn't seem too shy about going to the rim.  Since you're a Michigan fan, what do you see in him that maybe others don't?"
sixers,3d67be,Phogify,2,Mon Jul 13 22:29:52 2015 UTC,I'm super high on sauce. I think he can be the 3rd/4th option on a championship team and a near-max contract player. I'm actually expecting it.
sixers,3d67be,rahbee33,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:43:55 2015 UTC,That ability to make plays off the dribble. His assists jumped in that second year after Burke left and Walton was still a freshman.  Stauskaus isn't some sort of Jimmer Ferdette shooter that can't do anything else.
sixers,3d67be,Phogify,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:45:41 2015 UTC,That would be insane and I am highly doubting it.
sixers,3d67be,rahbee33,2,Tue Jul 14 01:32:29 2015 UTC,Really? It's only slightly better than what Covington did last year but more efficiently. Not out of the question I don't think.
sixers,3d67be,Happy_ScrappyHeroPup,2,Tue Jul 14 03:45:44 2015 UTC,A jump from .365/.322 to .450/.410? I'm not gonna count on that at all. I know we like to blame it on Sacramento but that would be ridiculous.
sixers,3d67be,Mmaayyoo,2,Tue Jul 14 04:27:40 2015 UTC,In his two years at Michigan he was .467/.441 and that 2nd year he was the first and second option and still put up .470/.442.  All I'm saying is that it's possible.
sixers,3d67be,sabakasabaka,2,Tue Jul 14 04:30:21 2015 UTC,"Scoring at that rate would make him basically a first option when on the floor. I can't imagine Stauskas maintaining that type of efficiency with the necessary usage.  I've also been really high on him since all that work he put in after his freshman year, but I just can't see volume and efficiency coming together on a roster so barren."

sixers,3da49u,iloveopenbar,5,Tue Jul 14 18:07:11 2015 UTC,There were also rumors that we would have taken Mudiay over Russell.  But in his post-draft radio interview Mike Miss kind of got him to insinuate it was a three player draft and that if he felt Mudiay was better than Okafor he would have taken him.  So tl;dr we probably will never know who they would have taken at #3 if Okafor went #2 but I think it's safe to say we had Okafor higher than #3 on our big board.
sixers,3da49u,andhily,4,Tue Jul 14 18:16:42 2015 UTC,i do think we're lucky for having okafor fall to us #3  imagine all those evan turner flashbacks we'd be having if russell was here stinking up the joint in summer league for us.
sixers,3da49u,sharke93,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:43 2015 UTC,It's the Summer League. If people were already freaking out then I wouldn't want to be in this sub unless Russell does good because all of the shit posts we'll get.
sixers,3da49u,Mr_Sixer,0,Wed Jul 15 12:42:28 2015 UTC,"People need to stop saying this. Hinkie doesn't reveal ANYTHING to ANYONE. When will you guys learn? He was just agreeing with him to make him shut up.  Hinkie doesn't see black and white. He doesn't see a 1 or 2 or 3 person draft. He has his big board, and he assigns value to each player in the best possible way he can. Maybe Hezonja was his 3rd guy, and Mudiay was his 4th, but if you add a first rounder to Mudiay then suddenly that is more value than Hezonja at 3.  I just think it's silly when people try to read too much into every little word Hinkie says, particularly in this one interview.  Hinkie is quite honest and forthcoming about his philosophy and when giving a qualitative analysis of a trade, pick, or player but he is too smart of a guy to ever make a public comment insinuating any kind of preference between players. All we know is he values Okafor >than anyone picked 4 or lower"

sixers,3d4cml,DariosDentist,17,Mon Jul 13 12:35:13 2015 UTC,"I said this in another thread, but I think this is an important wake up call as to why Hinkie is approachig this rebuild the way he is. The point of getting all these high picks is to give yourself the best chance at finding a star. That is acknowledging the risk that many of these players will not be that guy. Embiid was 100% the Sixers best chance at a star in last years draft, and Okafor was 100% the Sixers best chance at a star in this years draft. The fact that Embiid is looking a lot like a busted pick right now should only further the belief that we need to trust the process and stick with it.   The Sixers are still in a really good position moving forward. This is the reason why he has all these picks - Joel didn't work? No problem, we'll try again with Jah and 4 more picks in next years draft. It's a bummer if Joel is the one that doesn't work out because we love him and you can't find upside higher than his, but the whole point of The Process is the fact that the Sixers are the most prepared team in the league to deal with a busted lottery pick."
sixers,3d4cml,sokrazyitmightwork,5,Mon Jul 13 14:34:55 2015 UTC,Embiid is worth maybe 4/5 wins in his rookie year - probably less if they're being conservative with his minutes. And I'm all about letting our talent develop over strategic losing so I can't say I totally agree with you.  But at this point the Sixers are starting to fill out their roster and look like an exciting young team who could be a monster even without him. If/when he comes back it'll be like a basketball sized cherry on top of an already awesome sundae. JaKarr is the nuts.
sixers,3d4cml,sokrazyitmightwork,6,Mon Jul 13 16:27:47 2015 UTC,"My point is just that a setback like this isn't a hitch in Hinkie's process, it's the kind of thing that his process is exactly meant to protect against.   For example, let's say we immediately annointed Embiid as our cornerstone and star, and kept MCW with the intention of keeping him as a solid PG to build with Joel and Nerlens. Then we'd be in trouble because it doesn't look like we can count on Embiid as our star.   Instead, we traded MCW (a replaceable player) to get another pick that could be top 5 and gives us another chance to grab a star player. This team's road to being competitive doesn't start until we find a superstar, and we are still in the best position of finding one, even if it won't be Embiid. So the point is trading any replaceable asset so that we can get closer to finding the guy."
sixers,3d4cml,KingOfPancakess,0,Mon Jul 13 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"Alternatively and playing devils advocate, Hinkie is stoked. This may get him an additional two years to keep his job. He can blame a poor record on injury rather than a frankenstein roster full of children."
sixers,3d4cml,sokrazyitmightwork,5,Mon Jul 13 17:00:55 2015 UTC,He wasn't going anywhere. You don't hire a guy like Hinkie - who has been very clear and forthright about the length of this plan from the beginning and presumably during the interview process - just to jump ship after 3 or 4 years.
sixers,3d4cml,marksills,2,Mon Jul 13 17:04:37 2015 UTC,Hinkie isn't doing this just for the money. He wants to build something special. He could be making millions elsewhere. He is certainly not stoked
sixers,3d4cml,DerekBodner,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:01:56 2015 UTC,Hinkie wants great players. He does not want draft picks. He is not stoked that the best prospect he has drafted cannot play.

The nice part of selecting embiid when we did is that in this point of the rebuild we have no need for him. Him being healthy and playing would be a detriment to our upcoming draft and maybe even the evaluation of jah/noel as a group. who knows.  looking solely at embiid he still has by far the highest ceiling of any athlete in Philadelphia and he is even lucky to have been playing for the sixers. I'd be willing to bet most, if not all, teams would have rushed him back by now. This guy will get the correct treatment and rehabilitation time, i truly believe that is being undervalued by many writers."
sixers,3d4cml,ihorsey,2,Mon Jul 13 13:55:00 2015 UTC,"You stated it would be a ""detriment"" if he was healthy for the upcoming season because it would impact the draft.  Giving the choice of Embiid being healthy and playing this season or the current situation where he misses another season, which one would you choose? I would take Embiid playing.  He's a guy who played less than a year in college and is going to take over 2 years to recover from an injury.  I would have loved to see him healthy and on the court this season"

sixers,3d6ltj,rahbee33,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:42:11 2015 UTC,I mean the way I see it - he has the moves to get by anyone in the nba. If he's getting blocked he's likely either getting fouled or getting doubled.   We know he's not a great foul shooter but getting big men in foul trouble will eventually put less skilled big men against him that he can feast on is very advantageous.  Doubling him will leave wings and a cutting Nerlens open .  I know it's not that simple but it's also not rocket science. I'm sure he'll end up with a higher release point but in the meantime I ain't worried.
sixers,3d6ltj,lilgodboy,5,Tue Jul 14 00:38:15 2015 UTC,"He's had his shit punched a lot in summer league. I'm not worried about it that much, but he'll need some time to adjust."
sixers,3d6ltj,brssnj45,2,Mon Jul 13 23:05:45 2015 UTC,"A lot of good points in this thread, but I also wanted to point out his craftiness. You don't have big man moves like he does unless you have a bit of gusto and magic to the way you play. His hands are so big that blocking his shot is more difficult than percieved. We've seen him glide effortlessly by post defenders with two steps simply because of the versatility that palming the ball gives you. A weak side spin switch to the strong hand is pretty unstoppable. He's going to get high percentage looks regularly, and there's not much defenses can do about it. If he can execute regularly at the level he's used to, he's going to be an all star. Everyone gets blocked. That's no big deal. Once he gets a feel for the NBA he'll be able to adapt to post moves for maximum efficiency high percentage looks.   Unless he decides to kick it out for the open three. I'm fine with that too."

sixers,3d6ltj,thatbOl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:12:49 2015 UTC,I am worried that people going to time the spin and pin the shot. He has to continue to develop some more moves. It's crucial for him to get a mid range so he don't rely on that spin too much.
sixers,3d4yva,rahbee33,2,Mon Jul 13 15:48:51 2015 UTC,The ball movement on that Jackson 3 was nuts
sixers,3d4yva,10_9_8_76ers,2,Mon Jul 13 16:43:29 2015 UTC,I just made a post about Wilbekins game last night - I was impressed. Dude can spread the floor on his shot and was great in PnR. If the Sixers didn't have a long line of third tier point guards trying to step into a role this year I think he'd be a good fit. I agree he'll end up somewhere and wouldn't mind if it was Philadelphia.  He has better size than Ish/Jackson/McConnell and I'd take him on D over any of the three.
sixers,3d4yva,DariosDentist,2,Mon Jul 13 17:06:45 2015 UTC,"Glad to see Kazemi producing after all this time. Not sure it's enough to make the team, but at least there's improvement compared to how he played last year the Summer League"

sixers,3d4yva,xychosis,2,Mon Jul 13 18:16:01 2015 UTC,Hahaha. I knew I'd get it wrong. I looked it up in the box score and must've just typed it out wrong.
sixers,3d4yva,lilgodboy,2,Mon Jul 13 18:23:03 2015 UTC,"I'm looking forward to seeing JaKarr play with the regular Sixers. He seems a bit pressed to be the man on the summer league team, and that's not really his thing. But his handle, jumper and physique might have improved. Those scoring drives and the late threes were beautiful and hopefully indicative of the kind of things he can contribute."
sixers,3d4yva,xychosis,2,Mon Jul 13 20:57:29 2015 UTC,"JaKarr's handle is tight. Really looks good. I imagine he'll take another step forward this year and continue his upward trend with his game.   Kazemi seems like he's a great glue guy and has a very high BBIQ, but he lacks the athleticism, outside shooting and size to be a strong contributor at the 4 spot. If he had a jumper, he'd be a solid 3 off the bench, if he were a couple inches taller, he'd be a good 4. But well, he is what he is, and I think he still has an outside shot of making the final roster.  EDIT: Oh, and I think Pierre can be a crazy spark-plug off the bench. Instant offense, but apparently, streaky. His shot wouldn't fall, and it's a shame, but when he's on, he's on."

He is the kind of player coaches like, fans might not see his value as he might not be flashy all the time and taking shots, but he is the type of player you need to succeed. He was amazing for Oregon 2 yrs ago when they reached sweet 16 and he can do wonders for Sixers. I hope he gets signed."

sixers,3d4jof,Zeno84,12,Mon Jul 13 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, in a number of ways. The most important one, though, might be his propensity for constantly flipping assets while they still have value. Even though I've had a stable job for years that pays fairly well, I find it hard to bring myself to pay full price for new electronics, game consoles, computers, etc. So over the last year and a half, I've constantly been turning over assets in my life into forms of equity that I know I will use in the immediate to short term future (anywhere from 1 month to 12 months out).   For example, I had a laptop from a few years back that was just not cutting it for the type of development work I needed to do. It was still in good shape, so I took advantage of an electronics retailer's trade-in program to grab a sizable gift card for it before it depreciated further (and out of extended warranty status). I waited for a new revision of the laptop that I actually wanted to come out (took about four months) and then used that gift card to fund the purchase.  Before Hinkie, I used to just keep all of my stuff forever, even though I never ended up using that old desktop or Wii again. Really regret not getting value back for a lot of that stuff over the years. Now I'm constantly looking to refurbish and sell stuff back or to another party."

sixers,3d4szr,KingOfKings323,10,Mon Jul 13 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling he ends up in the D-League I'm a huge fan of his just because he's super athletic and is excellent defensively and is also a fairly good off ball-handler, he just needs to develop a half decent shot to have chance in the NBA."
sixers,3d4szr,eagsrock20,4,Mon Jul 13 15:12:57 2015 UTC,I'm not a fan of the D-League. The structure of the league is too loose to even be called pro-basketball. I know the 87ers haven't been around too long but no one who was a Seven has made an impact on the Sixers in anyway shape or form. And in the past two years they've had plenty of shots to.  Send him to Europe. He'll get paid and compete with some good basketball teams.
sixers,3d4szr,DariosDentist,10,Mon Jul 13 16:20:29 2015 UTC,"Covington played a good amount in the D-League, FWIW"
sixers,3d4szr,ioio-,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:36:29 2015 UTC,Not with the Sevens.
sixers,3d4szr,DariosDentist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:08:51 2015 UTC,Sure. I just don't see why the team matters if your issue was with the structure/talent of the league.
sixers,3d4szr,ioio-,3,Mon Jul 13 18:28:21 2015 UTC,I think I'm just frustrated that the D League could be so much more than what it is and the NBA has the money to make it the second best pro sports league in the world and doesnt.  You're right - it doesn't matter what team because aside from two assigned players from the affiliate every player on every DLeague team is up for grabs. It's crazy and structured so badly that I'd just prefer developing players on a more stable squad.  Props to Cov for making it on 20k a year in that league.
sixers,3d4szr,DariosDentist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:49:22 2015 UTC,I'm sure Cov could've supplemented his income with an offseason job. Perhaps he did.
sixers,3d4szr,ihorsey,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:09:24 2015 UTC,I think that's the best thing for him.  He just needs to work on a couple of things that are easily fixed by practice and playing.  He can be in the D-League for a year and really kill it in the SL next year if he works at it.  I think he can do it and he'll be really good.
sixers,3d4szr,pumadude321,2,Mon Jul 13 15:45:53 2015 UTC,"I see him in a similar light as KJ McDaniels, Jerami Grant, Jakarr Sampson, and Glenn Robinson III. I think Hinkie is taking flyers on super athletic guys at the right price and hoping they develop a 3 pointer.  In Tokoto's case, he might have come around at an unfortunate time if he was hoping for NBA action this year. There's a bit of a roster crunch and we don't have the room like we did last year to keep these flyers in house. I think he'll be treated similarly to fellow 58th pick and summer league teammate Jordan McRae and play overseas a year and then show his improvement in summer league 2016.  As a player, I think his shot looks like it isn't as far off as KJ, Jakarr, and Grant looked coming into the league (though he's been missing just as often). His ball handling was a pleasant surprise but I'd like to see him attack more aggressively. He reminded me of KJ getting up for some of those rebounds. The athleticism and defensive potential is there, he wasn't afraid to stay up on the ball handler and he can guard the 1, 2, or 3.   I like him but I'm not holding my breath that he'll ever turn into a productive player. I'm glad we own his rights and think we got great value at the 58th pick, but it's hard to romanticize him any more than I have."
sixers,3d4szr,NikeStanislaus,3,Mon Jul 13 18:55:16 2015 UTC,Probably won't see him on the roster this year
sixers,3d4szr,jjohn268,2,Mon Jul 13 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if he made the team.  He hasn't played very well in the summer league, but the sixers love explosive athletes and good defenders.  I think there's a decent chance he makes the team and steps in to a more limited version on the role KJ McDaniels played the first half of last season"
sixers,3d4szr,16Jack,2,Mon Jul 13 15:13:52 2015 UTC,Irrelevant to the sixers future to be honest
sixers,3d4szr,Kingdariush,2,Mon Jul 13 15:46:21 2015 UTC,"Perfect example of ""athlete that plays basketball"" as opposed to ""athletic basketball player"". Will definitely need to polish his game. I feel we'll stash him on the Sevens or overseas and hope he can come back an improved guy after a year."
sixers,3d4szr,xychosis,3,Mon Jul 13 16:08:05 2015 UTC,"I think he's terrible. I like how he skies for rebounds and there's definitely something there on the defensive end, but offensively he's just atrocious. Terrible jump shot, awful court vision which leads to bad passes galore, the list goes on and on. It seems like every time he touches the ball in SL the result is negative."
sixers,3d4szr,BrentoMussolini,2,Mon Jul 13 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I understand how frustrating he can be offensively, but the biggest thing that pisses me off his inability (or maybe he isn't trying?) to get to the basket. He's a solid ball handler with stupid athleticism, why not take it to the hoop?"
sixers,3d4szr,vayuu,2,Mon Jul 13 15:51:54 2015 UTC,he can't dribble to get to the hoop
sixers,3d4szr,hemminngway,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this assessment, I don't think he makes the team but would be pretty pissed off he did."
sixers,3d4szr,marksills,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:25:28 2015 UTC,"His shooting is pretty atrocious, and he can't do a ton offensively. Defensively and in transition he's very good, but when you can't play offense, not sure there's a place for you. He does pass well it seems and he gets rebounds and lose balls well, but he's far from NBA ready."
sixers,3d4szr,CrunchyKorm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:19:54 2015 UTC,I don't see how he isn't in the D-League or playing internationally in 2015/16. We'll see what progress he makes on that end.
sixers,3d4szr,goodatbeinggood,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:03:09 2015 UTC,In a Morey interview he talked about how the new frontier in analytics is defense which might explain why the rockets have so many shitty FT shooters despite being an analytics team - most of those guys bring something to the table defensively. I think tokoto fits the mold for this but will likely be playing games in the D-league first. If you're a UNC fan then I don't have to tell you but his defense and I think his wingspan/jumping compensate for his size. Also he can be viewed as an upside gamble since he may develop a shot which would potentially make him a starter at the 2.
sixers,3d4szr,lilgodboy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:39:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you all for your responses, I greatly appreciate it. The consensus seems to be that he likely won't play in the NBA this season. I feel like a possible national title run + another year of development in college would have helped him, but I respect his decision to leave. Hopefully he'll embrace whatever opportunity he has this year and makes big strides in his development as a pro. Good luck this season, Sixers fans!"
sixers,3d4szr,WalkingThePlanes,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:56:45 2015 UTC,"D League or overseas. He appears to have very, very little chance at making the roster."
sixers,3d4szr,vayuu,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"He's not good enough to play in the NBA. Non-threat offensively - his athleticism is offset by the fact that defenders can sag off as much as they want because he can't shoot - at all. Decent on defense but not Avery Bradley/Marcus Smart good, which is how good you have to be as the wrong kind of one-way guard to have any shot in the league. If he starts stroking jumpers in the D-league he could play on the Sixer roster but I'm not betting on that."
sixers,3d58u2,DariosDentist,4,Mon Jul 13 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"I like him and thinks he deserves a shot in training camp.  He played well last game too, and can shoot from what I saw from him so far this summer.  If nothing else we need a PG who can shoot, and its hard to gauge assists in summer league since its all about trying to score"

sixers,3d58u2,markiesmalls,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:24:18 2015 UTC,I liked watching Wilbekin at Florida. He's got a shot to develop and make a NBA roster for sure.
sixers,3d58u2,chukinthebuket,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:48:20 2015 UTC,"He looked good, but I don't think anyone has looked better than Pierre playing the point this SL.  I doubt he makes the team."
sixers,3d58u2,Slim91292,3,Mon Jul 13 17:18:36 2015 UTC,"People will hate on me because this sub loves Pierre but I completely disagree, did you watch last nights game? I know we love Pierre but his height is going to kill him in the NBA. There were multiple times last night that he literally couldn't get a shot off because he was so much smaller than his competition, and the shots he did take were so much more difficult than the average NBA player because of his height. He is also not a great finisher at the rim, air balling at least one floater I know for sure. He did make a couple nice 3's the first game, but how is 3-12 shooting, 4 turnovers and 3 assists better than what Wilbekin did last night. At least at 6'2 Wilbekin has a chance at getting his shots off and defending starting caliber players in the NBA."
sixers,3d58u2,thisisnotme12244,4,Mon Jul 13 17:36:14 2015 UTC,"PJ was coming up short on his shot last night.  I chalk it up to a year off and only his second game, he needs to get his legs back"
sixers,3d58u2,Slim91292,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:48:55 2015 UTC,"I definitely hope you're right. its just my opinion that his height and him not being a natural point guard is going to hurt him. 5 turnovers and 4 assists over 2 games as a point guard is a cause for concern imo, I hope i'm wrong."
sixers,3d58u2,Slim91292,3,Mon Jul 13 17:55:30 2015 UTC,And the other night Jackson looked great.  I think we need patience. Hopefully he can develop into a viable bench player.
sixers,3d58u2,HeJind,2,Mon Jul 13 17:41:07 2015 UTC,"Feel free to disagree but I honestly didn't think his first game was all that great. Had his shot blocked a few times because of the length that was guarding him, and only had one assist as our starting point guard. I will say he can hit open shots, and even hit a highly contested 3, but his height and him being a natural scoring guard not a point is going to really hurt his chances at being a quality point guard. Time will only tell if i'm right or not and I will definitely be tuning into the rest of summer league and continue to form an opinion."
sixers,3d58u2,chukinthebuket,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:49:49 2015 UTC,He looked good against the Lakers but great? 5/11 with an assist. What am I missing?
sixers,3d58u2,LostCityLeague,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:12:38 2015 UTC,Using assist numbers in Summer League isn't exactly fair. Jah would've had a triple double with 10 assists if Tokoto and JaKarr had any semblance of a jumpshot. Our SL team is filled with great athletes who can't shoot. Low assists numbers =/= no passing being done.
sixers,3d7g5m,mxnoob983,4,Tue Jul 14 02:47:40 2015 UTC,"I have a friend who is a major Pelicans fan and when they brought him back this year he was upset. I also find myself watching the Pelicans a lot which gives means I've seen him play. For the amount we would have to pay for him and I don't see him being our 2 guard of the future. Idk, I'm off Gordon island but who knows, he could flourish in our program."

sixers,3d7g5m,marksills,2,Tue Jul 14 03:48:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind signing him. You probably are going to get a lot of ""he doesn't move the needle"" comments but he is a very solid player and shot it very well from three this year.   A lot of it depends on where we end up in the draft and who we end up signing. If we have our point guard then he is a great signing and fills out the roster nicely but if we don't have our PG it's probably best that we pass on him."
sixers,3d7g5m,andhily,2,Tue Jul 14 02:54:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced that we need to go so traditional and have such a ball dominant wing/guard combination. Solid to good PnR players are really what we need, they don't have to be PGs necessarily."
sixers,3d7g5m,andhily,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:57:14 2015 UTC,"I agree that PnR should be highly valued but signing Gordon to the amount of money that he is going to command is essentially committing to being competitive -- which is fine since we can swap with Sac.  But I think that we need to know who our PG is going to be before we make the commitment to compete. I don't care if we draft him, trade for one, or even sign Conley but right now PG is our #1 area of need."

For context, he completely disrespected Illinois and withdrew a verbal commitment to play for Kelvin ""the snake"" Sampson at IU. He was booed mercilessly when he came to play at ILL his freshman season. Every. damn. time. he touched the ball."
sixers,3d7g5m,PM_YO_VAGINA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:00:41 2015 UTC,Nooooooo. He's an undersized two guard with no ability to run the point (career 3 ast/game and basically 1/1 ast/tor) He's a ball stopper who loses interest if he's not getting his shots. On top of all that he is extremely injury prone (never played more than 64 games in any season). I'll pass
sixers,3d65gq,DariosDentist,2,Mon Jul 13 20:47:35 2015 UTC,"Lol, I don't really understand what you are trying to say. He plays better when he knows Embiid is hurt?"
sixers,3d65gq,arjunbsharma,2,Mon Jul 13 20:49:23 2015 UTC,"I think Okafor has the attitude that he will be great, dominate, a ""golden boy"" attitude, a ""it is my destiny"" attitude that the great players have.  So I think it makes a lot of sense that Okafor did not want to be a sixer when Embiid was going to be the center piece of the franchise.  Then when learns he will be the center piece, Okafor loves being a sixer.    I think, trying to stretch for a bright side (really stretching) Embiid sitting another year out, might make it more probable that in the long run the sixers do the right thing and hang on to the big 3, instead of trading one away.  Okafor gets to enjoy a year of being the man on the team, and work with Noel, trying to figure out how Noel can work with him.  Embiid then after a year can come back to playing and try to fit in with Okafor, instead of Okafor coming in trying to fit in with Embiid.   Embiid seems to have a more laid back personality, can maybe share the centerpiece role better than Okafor."
sixers,3d65gq,valleymountain,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:15:13 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone gets what I'm speculating. And it is total speculation, but it's also not hard to put 2 and 2 together.

sixers,3d5q14,PHLHomer,13,Mon Jul 13 19:00:58 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people think Brooklyn would tank, they don't own the rights to their picks for the next couple of years so why would you tank if you're not gonna benefit from it?   They're better off just being a mediocre team that fights for 7 or 8 seed in the East."
sixers,3d5q14,eagsrock20,4,Mon Jul 13 19:15:33 2015 UTC,I don't think that they'll tank -- they could be really horrible if Joe Johnson gets traded and/or Lopez gets hurt. They could be atrocious
sixers,3d5q14,Blasphemizer,6,Mon Jul 13 19:18:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think that they have a good chance of being that bad. King has every incentive to make moves to win now because they don't own any of their picks for the next few years. And Lionel Hollins is still a decent coach. The biggest loss they suffered was Deron Williams, and I'm not sure that he added that much. Plumlee regressed last year, so losing him isn't too major either. They actually made some nice little moves to add depth in Larkin, TRob, RHJ, Cliff Alexander. Unless they deal Joe Johnson or have major injuries, I think that it's unlikely that they are a bottom 10 team, much less bottom 5."
sixers,3d5q14,Blasphemizer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:27:13 2015 UTC,"I'm personally on the fence; I'm not sold that they won't have major injuries (lopez, bargnani, one of them are bound to get hurt). And I'm not sure if Joe Johnson is gonna be their savior out of the bottom 10 squads in the league.  Even at full strength, which teams will they be better than?  East: Sixers, Knicks (maybe?), Pistons (maybe?), Hornets (maybe?), Magic (maybe?)  West: Nuggets, Twolves, Lakers, Kings, Jazz (maybe?)  A lot of those teams have a lot higher potential than the Nets in my opinion"
sixers,3d5q14,chukinthebuket,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:39:29 2015 UTC,"Joe Johnson is a good player, he's just way overpaid. And their big injury concern is Lopez only, they're not counting on Bargnani to be a major contributor. Add the Blazers to the teams that they'll be better than. Lillard alone can't keep that boat afloat in the West. I think that you can cut the ""maybe"" from the Knicks, Magic, and Pistons. Knicks and Magic would have to improve a lot and the Pistons have to make up for the production of Monroe. Don't think that everything is hunky-dory in Pacerland either just because Paul George is back. Losing West and Hibbert is no small thing. Here's what my list would look like: Sixers, Knicks, Nuggets, TWolves, Lakers, Magic, Pistons, Blazers, Kings, Hornets (maybe), Pacers (maybe), Jazz (maybe)."
sixers,3d5q14,ff_nut,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:18:23 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, and I didn't even think about the Pacers. They could be pretty bad this year too; however, I disagree with you about a lot of those teams.  Knicks: With a healthy Carmelo and Robin Lopez, I can easily see them being better than the Nets, albeit not making it into the playoffs either.  Pistons: Think about who they have in comparison to the Nets - Drummond, Ilyasova, Reggie Jackson, Marcus Morris, Brandon Jennings (I'm running out of names that I can think of) but still, I think they have more promise than the Nets  Lakers: They've made enough moves this offseason to make them look better than the Nets on paper. And that's how we're comparing them right now I guess, right? Hibbert, Randle, Kobe, Lou Will, Russell, Swaggy P, Clarkson, Brandon Bass. >Nets  Blazers: The blazers will not make the playoffs in the West but they are still better than a lot of the teams in the East. Lillard, henderson, aminu, ed davis, and mason plumlee definitely has more firepower than the Nets  Besides that, I think the rest of the teams are sort of a toss up besides the Sixers, Magic, Nuggets, and Twolves.  TL;DR I think the Nets really blow lol"
sixers,3d5q14,chukinthebuket,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:31:31 2015 UTC,"How he sees the Magic<Nets is beyond me.  All Brooklyn really has, to me, is Lopez.  The Magic have their own double double machine in Vucevic, plus a scoring wing like Tobias Harris.  They also have a core of decent young players in Vic Oladipo, Aaron Gordon, and Elfrid Peyton.  Plus Super Mario, I can see the Magic contending for the 8th seed this year."
sixers,3d5q14,EUPW,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:24:31 2015 UTC,"So Thad is a nobody now? Remember that he more or less single handedly kept this team afloat before he was traded from philly and we were t a bottom three team then. So idk how Johnson, Lopez and Thad make Brooklyn horrible. They'll be bad, but nowhere near a bottom 5 team in the league without major j juries and/or trades"
sixers,3d5q14,lilgodboy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:45:20 2015 UTC,"I never said Thad was horrible.  He's just kind of average to very slightly above average at best right now.  I think the Nets could be about where Miami was last year, but they were barely a playoff team last year and they didn't seem to get all that much better, so I don't think it's a stretch to say that maybe they're not a playoff team next year."
sixers,3d5q14,marksills,2,Tue Jul 14 01:24:08 2015 UTC,"They play in the East, have no incentive to tank, and have three pretty good players in Lopez, Young, and Johnson. I'd say they have maybe a 5% chance of landing Boston a top-3 pick."
sixers,3d5q14,lilgodboy,2,Mon Jul 13 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"Thad Young is a decent, hardworking player, but his recent history in PHI and MIN suggests he does more to help a team lose than win. At the very least, he doesn't move the needle."
sixers,3d5q14,marksills,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:09:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's true. We would've been even worse without him, he had a lot of good games with us. And he was played out of position with the wolves. He's a pretty good player"
sixers,3d5q14,chukinthebuket,2,Mon Jul 13 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"How much worse would the Sixers have been? He was there all season and they tied the longest losing streak ever. They traded him, MCW and lost Wroten for the year -- and won almost the exact same number of games.  But anyway, we can probably agree that Thad isn't going to carry the Nets to a lot of wins by himself. He's a role player."
sixers,3d5q14,lilgodboy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:51:44 2015 UTC,"He added a pretty good amount of wins. We had that 4 game won streak that he dominated in and probly won 3 of those games right there. We would've been worse than the bucks without him.   But yea, he's not gonna carry them to the playoffs or anything. But with Lopez and ISO joe i think they can get up to like 10th worst"
sixers,3d5q14,chukinthebuket,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"According to basketball-reference, Thad was worth 3.1 Win Shares (estimate of wins contributed by a player) last season.  Over his 8 year career, he averages 5.26 WS/season, although they're somewhat inflated by his middle years, which were highly productive.  Watching him play over the years and coupling the numbers, I tend to agree with /u/lilgodboy.  He's not someone I'd worry about even a little, nor someone who I'd point to on an otherwise bad team and say, ""Well, he's here so they won't be that bad"" (See 2012-14 sixers for evidence)"
sixers,3d5q14,marksills,2,Mon Jul 13 21:32:38 2015 UTC,"I dislike ragging on Thad, but he's kind of a dude whose abilities are diminished in a league that has shifted towards big men who are either rim protector/rebounders or three-point threats/passers. He's great in transition and a mobile defender against the pick n roll, but needs a pretty specific niche and team to minimize his shortcomings.   Maybe being next to Brook Lopez is a good spot for Thad -- his offensive efficiency jumped up to around league average (although I wouldn't bank on him being a 38% 3-point shooter for a whole season)."
sixers,3d5q14,chukinthebuket,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:58:37 2015 UTC,Thad would be awesome coming off the bench as a 7th or 8th man out West for a really good team.  But he's not a difference maker is all I'm saying.
sixers,3d5q14,marksills,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:25:29 2015 UTC,"I think you can say if he's their 3rd option, they'll probly get closer to the 10-12th pick than 1-3rd"
sixers,3d5q14,chukinthebuket,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:42:32 2015 UTC,See I really disagree.  I don't think him being on the team factors into that any more than Jarret Jack or whomever else they have.  He's a slight positive.

I'm not saying he's terrible or useless, just that he's ok.  Probably better suited in a reserve role for a contender then a 2nd/3rd option on a team that isn't very good."
sixers,3d5q14,DariosDentist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:28:11 2015 UTC,"I love Thad, but is he the player to win them 35 games? How can you be 95% sure they will be better than even just 3 teams in the league? Johnson averaged like 15 ppg last year.. He's not the all-star he used to be. And I feel like there's a higher chance than 5% that Lopez gets hurt. I'm not concerned about US not getting the No. 1 pick, I just really, truly, do not want the Celtics to win this lottery...  Edit: I'm not saying they're going to ""tank"". I think they could genuinely try to make moves to win, and fail to do so."
sixers,3d5q14,sharke93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:06:50 2015 UTC,We have Sac's and our own ping pong balls. It's hard to say.
sixers,3d5q14,s1010,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:08:03 2015 UTC,"Right. I personally think the pick swap gives us a higher chance of the No. 1, but only marginally - seeing as how the Kings are most likely going to be a late lottery team.  But let's say, the Nets are the worst team in the NBA (drastic assumption, I know). They'll have 250 ping pong balls.   Now say we're the 3rd worst team in the league. We would have 156 ping pong balls. The Kings would have to be the 4th worst team in the NBA (giving us an additional 119 ping pong balls) to give us a statistically higher chance of receiving the No. 1 overall pick than the Nets. If they are as high as the 5th worst team in the league (adding just 88 ping pong balls), we still have a lower percent-chance of receiving the No. 1 overall pick."

sixers,3d2n6l,mistercrinkles,7,Mon Jul 13 02:04:31 2015 UTC,"Haha interesting point. They do ""hold the rights"" but it has to end at NBA rights. Right?"
sixers,3d2n6l,sharke93,3,Mon Jul 13 02:17:52 2015 UTC,Yeah it's only NBA rights. FIBA is completely seperate.
sixers,3d2n6l,flyingdeathmachine,6,Mon Jul 13 02:35:54 2015 UTC,"Probably not, but it's the offseason, and rumors like this are a lot of fun."
sixers,3d2n6l,vekin91,6,Mon Jul 13 01:27:37 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know if Saric has any experience at the Small Forward position? I'm always hearing about how we expect to slide him in to our starting lineup right away, but I'm really not sure where..."
sixers,3d2n6l,tungtwister,0,Mon Jul 13 03:36:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put Saric at the 3... his lateral quickness isn't good enough to keep up with NBA level swingmen on the perimeter, and if you try to take advantage of his size offensively you'd better have a big man who floats towards the perimeter (which the Sixers don't have outside of Embiid, who I'd rather not leave out near the 3-pt arc anyway). Saric is a power forward with handles and PG court vision."
sixers,3d2n6l,MatthewCauthon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:55:01 2015 UTC,"It's not as is RoCo is a defensive stopper at the 3 now, so I don't see a switch to Saric at 3 being much (if any) of a downgrade there, but his playmaking ability should be a huge boost to the offense.  And Nerles is lurking to deter incursions into the lane.  I think that can make up for perceived defensive liabilities in other players."
sixers,3d2n6l,philip_oliver_holes,7,Tue Jul 14 02:10:19 2015 UTC,"Is it possible that Efes could let him go this summer for the following logic?  If you are Efes, you know you can't keep top, NBA-caliber talent indefinitely. Even though Saric has agreed to a contract of a certain duration, moving to the NBA is in the best interest of his career. Although they are entitled to keep him for the duration of the contract, it may benefit them to allow him to leave now in order to make themselves a more desirable destination for future top young prospects. In other words, future prospects may be more inclined to play for Efes knowing that when their time comes, they will be granted permission to make an upward career move.  It's like how position coaches in the NFL are almost always allowed to take jobs as offensive/defensive coordinators and coordinators are almost always allowed to take jobs as head coaches. Upward career moves are rarely blocked. The team needs to keep a good reputation so it can continue to attract top coaching talent top-to-bottom."
sixers,3d2n6l,SteveWynn,0,Mon Jul 13 02:30:40 2015 UTC,"The only logic theyd consider is $$$. Someone has to get paid. Harris has the money, either he has the balls to get it done or he doesnt"
sixers,3d2n6l,chipsvisor,10,Mon Jul 13 02:56:38 2015 UTC,Harris is not allowed to buy Saric's contract or he would.  Pissing away money is not a problem for him.
sixers,3d2n6l,cobbicus333,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"NBA rules say that a team can only contribute so much (I think it's like 500k) to a contract buyout, the rest has to come out of the players pocket. So it's weird."

sixers,3d2n6l,Slim91292,4,Mon Jul 13 15:59:25 2015 UTC,"I would love to believe this but I thought his situation was pretty cut and dry. He signed a contract that has a NBA out clause after 2 years, and if he wants to go before then Saric himself will have to pay his team a significant amount of money to come over. I don't think there is really anything the Sixers can do other than convince Saric himself to pay that buyout so he can come over and be apart of the process as soon as possible."

sixers,3d0n21,ObsessedWithOKC,69,Sun Jul 12 14:52:40 2015 UTC,I'm thinking about getting foot surgery too just as a show of solidarity.  Then me and jojo can be boot buddies.
sixers,3d0n21,secretlypooping,17,Sun Jul 12 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"Great idea.  I still believe in Embiid!  Yeah 2 years is unprecedented, but he has the spirit and will to overcome this.  When he finally does play next season it will be soooo worth it."
sixers,3d0n21,Iputthescrewintuna,16,Sun Jul 12 15:08:22 2015 UTC,This obviously sucks but I'm 100% on board with waiting for Embiid full recovery. In the mean time I'm just excited to watch Jah go to work in the NBA. I wanna see him take ROY.
sixers,3d0n21,sharke93,11,Sun Jul 12 15:49:19 2015 UTC,"Jah gets all the PT he needs, this yr, to work out the rookie-nerves and polish out his pro-game, then next summer we get must-see-tv w/ embiid & (potentially)saric dominating summer league.... I can live with that"

sixers,3d0n21,DeadsBroSquatsBro,2,Sun Jul 12 21:03:01 2015 UTC,Obviously we would love to have him in the lineup this year but there are some silver linings. Noel and Okafor can play as many minutes as possible plus we will most likely have another top 5 pick. Now we can only hope saric is serious about coming to the NBA next season and Embiid makes a full recovery for 2016. Also add the 2-4 first round picks to the mix and we have very exciting future.
sixers,3d0n21,Halfonion,2,Sun Jul 12 17:33:56 2015 UTC,I thought from a financial standpoint it makes no sense for Saric to come over next season? I think that's what Bodner claims at least.
sixers,3d0n21,BrentoMussolini,2,Sun Jul 12 18:33:23 2015 UTC,Correct. If he waits one more year he's out of the rookie contract stage
sixers,3d0n21,Feelfreetoupvote,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:49:30 2015 UTC,Yes he would make more money staying in euro another year after this but there's rumors we wants to play in the nba asap.

sixers,3d0n21,jaysonrodriguez,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:59:26 2015 UTC,"I really feel for this dude, he's so scrutinized and hasn't even played a game, and seems like so many fans take anger out on him. Really hoping he has a long, healthy career."
sixers,3d0n21,hemminngway,-9,Mon Jul 13 19:28:49 2015 UTC,I'm getting a Greg Oden vibe here...I think he should retire. A big man with foot problems at such a young age? Yea good luck having a lengthy career o_O  Sorry Philly...dems the BREAKS!
sixers,3d0n21,xChainfirex,3,Sun Jul 12 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"Different medical issues.  Not only that, but Oden was rushed back way too fast.  He is going to have a chance to completely heal before playing.  He is lucky he is on the Sixers because they can be patient.  I'm will to bet most teams would have said, ""you feel fine, so get out there and try and play"""
sixers,3d0n21,thisisnotme12244,-3,Sun Jul 12 19:18:03 2015 UTC,You don't find foot issues alarming for a young big man?
sixers,3d0n21,xChainfirex,2,Sun Jul 12 19:23:58 2015 UTC,Not in someone that young.  A kid 20 years old can heel from something like this.  Now if he was say in his late 20s I would say  it's a lot more worrying
sixers,3d0n21,thisisnotme12244,5,Sun Jul 12 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"you actually dont think this is alarming? I dont think he's done for, but there's a good chance he never has more than 1 or 2 healthy seasons"
sixers,3d0n21,marksills,5,Sun Jul 12 20:42:00 2015 UTC,"Bone grafts are not terrible surgeries. Plenty of people have them. Durant had it (though for a different bone injury). The Sixers are overly extending Embiid's timeline. They're being safe. I'm fine with that. David Robinson, 4 years + 2 in the Navy."
sixers,3d0n21,Xepa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:50:31 2015 UTC,"but still, he couldnt take a 30 game season, got 2 different stress fractures from it. Then one of the fractures didnt even heal correctly. I try to be optimistic, but im not sure how you dont find this alarming"
sixers,3d0n21,marksills,3,Sun Jul 12 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"KD is having the same procedure, so i'm waiting to see how his health is this season before i get done with hope."
sixers,3d0n21,ikenjake,0,Sun Jul 12 22:56:19 2015 UTC,"I guess, but KDs body has a better track record of holding up.   Also, I still have hope. I think it's possible he still has a very good career, I just think not to worry or be alarmed about it is crazy"

sixers,3d1enh,rahbee33,7,Sun Jul 12 18:54:14 2015 UTC,"Im also beginning to believe in Okafor. The faceup and post up domination, the probing and passing iq, his willingness to defend... I believe in him. I enjoyed seeing him adjust and make fts, and adjusting to the pace of the game."
sixers,3d1enh,LRW35,5,Sun Jul 12 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"Okafors footwork is unbelievable for a 19 year old. The last Okafor gif posted above, showing patience, is just absolutely hakeem-like footwork and patience. I can not wait for him to show his stuff during the season."
sixers,3d1enh,noeltojoel,3,Sun Jul 12 21:13:13 2015 UTC,Another thank you.  I caught the game but this is the perfect distillation of what happened.
sixers,3d1enh,EaglePride101,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:51:06 2015 UTC,No problem.
sixers,3d1enh,EaglePride101,2,Sun Jul 12 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"On Jakarr - love the guy and think he has a ton of potential.  I'm concerned about the big hitch in his shot, though.  I would have hoped that he had worked on that more so far this offseason.  If he can get to 35% from three he could be a hell of a player."
sixers,3d1enh,decriz,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:05:50 2015 UTC,"OKAFOR! great footwork, even in defense. His defense is underrated. I think consistency is his real issue on defense otherwise, he's no liability. Refer to defensive plays on guards, Clarkson and Russel. And his patience when working in the post! It's evident he's a cool cat, never panicking. He's going to be a reliable offensive option and go to guy."
sixers,3d1enh,GOATrieIrving,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:34:13 2015 UTC,"Okafor's moves are a thing of beauty. Wasn't sold on him before the draft, but dear gawd he looks great. D'Angelo on the other hand, I think the Sixers may have dodged a bullet."
sixers,3d2okq,CeleryOnReddit,4,Mon Jul 13 01:16:17 2015 UTC,I just hope if he is a future all-star he still wants to play in Philly after his rookie contract is up.
sixers,3d2okq,MyCommentIs27,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:10:37 2015 UTC,I agree but on draft night I was pretty bummed we didn't get Russell. I still kind of wish we had him but after hearing about Embiid it makes me feel a lot better about the pick.
sixers,3d2okq,marksills,5,Mon Jul 13 03:13:26 2015 UTC,"I dont think our luck has been too bad. Im happy we got 3 both drafts, as these drafts seemed to be pretty top heavy, specifically 3 clear guys that stand out imo. Obviously our luck wasnt great with last years draft, as we probly wouldve ended up with Wiggins had Embiid never have been hurt, but Id still take embiid over others that went behind him.   If Bosh doesnt get hurt/sick last year, the pick is likely in basically the same spot itll be this year (barring injuries this year), so not too much bad luck there.  Hinkie said when we got the OKC pick, he thought we had a 30% chance at getting it, so it was more likely we didnt. It also was much more likely we didnt get the Lakers pick.  I dont consider not getting Russell bad luck, as it was just someone making a pick. And some would say were better off with Okafor, which is a reasonable opinion.  I count us lucky we didnt fall out of the top 3, and while we have also had some bad luck, mainly concerning the 2014 draft/embiid, I dont consider us that unlucky. I dont think overall weve been lucky, but also dont think weve been unlucky"
sixers,3d2okq,brssnj45,4,Mon Jul 13 02:48:59 2015 UTC,"I love this sub, don't get me wrong, but some people here are impatient as fuck. Chill guys, let this thing ride for a little while. If you question the process every single day, it's going to take a lot longer. It's like watching water boil. Instead, focus on the team and the players and look at the whole big picture in bigger time frames.   I know I won't be saying anything about the process until at least after next seasons draft. These things take time, and the only way we can ruin the whole thing is if we are impatient."
sixers,3d2okq,DutchEnglish,4,Mon Jul 13 02:47:43 2015 UTC,"Bad luck?   Hinkie flips every player that was left from the old regime for 1st & 2nd rounders and most of them made no impact with their new teams and have become role players. Hinkie lands Noel who was the sure #1 pick if it wasn't for his injury and also picks up MCW who becomes a late lottery gem. MCW becomes ROY and people all over the league become fans of his so much that we land LA's 1st rounder. Noel rehabs so well that we haven't even heard of an idea of a setback. He's developing way more quickly than ANYONE expected. The storied LA Lakers cannot land a FA and one of their legendary players is on his last leg and can't give 110% effort anymore, AKA the LA Lakers are in serious rebuild mode...in the Western Conference. Okafor who was the best player in college falls because of the idea that the NBA is ""changing"" and we land the guy who's viewed as a generational big. Imagine the Spurs landing Tim Duncan at #3 nowadays...yeah exactly. He flips 2 overseas projects for Sauce, Landry, Thompson, 2 Pick Swap options and a unprotected 2019 1st rounder because the Kings want FA's...they only land 2 FAs & their best player hates the coach. AKA the team is in shambles and we get to gain from that meltdown for 3-4 years straight.   Man the only bad thing that happened was Embiid being injured, but IMO I think it's a good sign that the Sixers organization won't rush a guy back just because. You have to remember that before the injury Embiid was expected to become the 1st pick of the draft...people thought so highly of him that they would draft him over Maple Jordan lol.   Hinkie is the luckiest bastard in the world because next year we will potentially have 3-6 1st rounders coming to us next year (Saric, Embiid, Our 1st, LA's 1st, OKC's 1st & MIA's 1st) to add on our existing core with Okafor, Sauce & Noel. If that isn't luck idk what is."
sixers,3d2okq,iloveopenbar,2,Mon Jul 13 03:28:13 2015 UTC,hopefully a stud point guard can be gotten next year.
sixers,3d2okq,DutchEnglish,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:07:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know but one thing that works in our favor is that D'Angelo wasn't even projected to be a 1st rounder until he balled his way to recognition.  With Dunn, Trimble and some other PG's who are projected to go in the first we just have to see who ends up taking over their respective conference like D'Angelo did to see who's the studs."
sixers,3d2okq,Secondstrike23,2,Mon Jul 13 15:29:14 2015 UTC,"I agree Hinkie has had a stream of bad luck, though not as much as you would say.   I would say it was more of a ""we didn't hit the lottery"" rather than ""the lottery would have been the best any way but this"". Embiid was a choice that was correct at the time. The way Hinkie tanks seasons, it is only a setback of a year, a very good price for a chance at a superstar, considering the difference of value between a top 3 pick and a top 16-20 pick (the road of mediocrity). The Saric trade I believe was good luck, at least for now, but getting Parker or Wiggins would have accelerated the process by 2 or 3 years. This year we failed to get the lakers pick as well, but at the same time we got Okafor where news of Embiid's injury came through and I would say that is actually very good luck considering what reports were saying. The way he is running the process is pretty luck proof in that getting a good player has to happen some time.  On another note I think that Hinkie has been looking mainly for the transcendent talents, ones that started as defensive stalwarts and grew an offensive game specifically, and had great character. Okafor was kind of an odd pick but I would attribute that to the weakness of this draft class in terms of star power. Next draft class appears to be weak in star power too, with only a consensus No. 1 pick so it's quite unfortunate that most of our eggs are in that basket, considering we don't have anything that could be considered a franchise star yet. The pick swap was a masterful move for that but it's only a very low chance it will pay off. We might not win the lottery now but it will happen sometime."
sixers,3d2okq,hawktherapper,2,Mon Jul 13 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"This is a public service announcement.  There's been a little bit of a damper on this since the Embiid news, but it's CENTER CITY.  Whoever came up with that is a friggin genius, it's not Triple Towers, Philly Skyline, Block City, Big, Bigg, and Bigger, or Jahlens Nobiid.  It's CENTER CITY.    Good post otherwise though."

sixers,3d2okq,LRW35,5,Tue Jul 14 06:16:48 2015 UTC,We havent been lucky so far in the rebuild. Thats pretty clear if you read this at all...
sixers,3d2okq,ThaOneNOnly,4,Mon Jul 13 01:36:50 2015 UTC,Well that shit luck is gonna finally turn around after this year when Embiid comes out of this healthy and the Sixers/Kings win the lottery!
sixers,3d2okq,LRW35,3,Mon Jul 13 01:54:34 2015 UTC,"I agree, we are due for some luck."

sixers,3d2okq,Camus145,2,Mon Jul 13 02:20:46 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree. We'll be adding 2 top 7 picks next year plus Saric and Embiid in theory. Im content with our direction

sixers,3d1kl5,noeltojoel,3,Sun Jul 12 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"After duncan retires, i can see him taking a Hakeem role and trying to pass the torch to younger players. Theres videos of Hakeem training Dwight and even Lebron i think, but Dwight will never be a post up back to the basket guy. If Duncan trained with Jah, Jah would soak everything up like a sponge and work hard till he perfects it."

Who will average 20 a night in this league.   Having fought through some injuries myself, as hard as the physical ails are, the mental can sometimes be much greater. Joel Embiid, a 21 year old who has only played 28 games in the last 2 years, will be sitting out another year. That must be a load on him.   I have a lot of optimism for this team, Hinkie has beyond a doubt maximized value time and again. I don't think we will be horrible next year. I think we can find ourselves 7-10th in the East."
sixers,3d1y59,brssnj45,12,Sun Jul 12 21:33:50 2015 UTC,Time for Pappy to take over. #Theysleep
sixers,3d1y59,TrueSixersFan717,3,Sun Jul 12 22:00:18 2015 UTC,"I think he will be. It seems hinkie likes him, as he gave him money last year when it wasn't necessary and brought him back. And if he plays like yesterday again, there's no way he's not on the team"
sixers,3d1y59,marksills,5,Sun Jul 12 22:18:00 2015 UTC,So really no reason to watch. I'll catch the highlights after the game

sixers,3d1y59,DariosDentist,3,Sun Jul 12 23:07:54 2015 UTC,"Looking for a bounce-back from JaKarr. As someone pointed out, he appears bigger (just as Grant did). If he was motivated enough over the offseason to add muscle, hopefully he worked on his shot and last night was just a rough game.  Would love to see another scoring barrage from Pappy. His return is a nice story, especially considering the other injury news surrounding the team."
sixers,3d1y59,lilgodboy,2,Mon Jul 13 00:23:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll be hoping for big things from Jakarr. He hasn't done enough last season and this summer league to secure his place on the team, and while he can be a good player, he needs to match his effort level with the rest of the team. I'm not saying he isn't trying, but rather his efforts need to be both more effective and more consistent."
sixers,3d1y59,lilgodboy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:14:53 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if he was cut, especially since there aren't any incoming swingmen that could foreseeably take his minutes other than Stauskas (Tokoto, McRae and the others seem destined for D League or overseas). To me, the main potential redundancy in the backcourt is Pappy and Canaan."
sixers,3d1y59,AyMiles,2,Mon Jul 13 00:38:08 2015 UTC,Nah he won't be cut. But he might not be around long term unless he can demonstrate value.
sixers,3d1y59,marksills,3,Mon Jul 13 00:56:05 2015 UTC,To engage physically would be the next logical step right after that

sixers,3d1y59,marksills,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:07:27 2015 UTC,Let's pretend JaKarr was taking uncharacteristic shots because he's a vastly improved shooter now (and was just off).

sixers,3czb58,lKug,2,Sun Jul 12 09:08:34 2015 UTC,You know he is the steal of the draft when he was the third pick and is still going to be considered a steal lol. I think his game will translate better to the NBA than college as well.
sixers,3czb58,Kobe_AYEEEEE,6,Sun Jul 12 16:45:45 2015 UTC,After such a shitty day in Sixer-land yesterday Jah came in with some insane post & face-up moves that took my blues away. And It was even better that it was against the Lakers & a struggling D'Angelo Russell.

sixers,3cz5ey,muchacho2149,30,Sun Jul 12 02:40:18 2015 UTC,Jah killed it tonight. He had moves and counter moves and (in this instance) counter counter moves.  He also passed well out of the low post to open shooters. Can't wait for Jah - Nerlens - Sauce
sixers,3cz5ey,aBagorn,8,Sun Jul 12 02:49:41 2015 UTC,Jah with sauce roco and hollis could actually get us some wins.

sixers,3cz5ey,JoelStampiid,14,Sun Jul 12 03:34:46 2015 UTC,"oh the idiot again, great."
sixers,3cz5ey,ACPhila,12,Sun Jul 12 04:08:20 2015 UTC,The guy defending him had 8 freaking fouls.
sixers,3cz5ey,faithdies,-8,Sun Jul 12 04:06:02 2015 UTC,"And the guy defending him (tarik black) had 10 fouls in his game yesterday, thats just his thing i guess. A lot of players rack up the fouls in summer league"
sixers,3cz5ey,JoelStampiid,5,Sun Jul 12 04:14:36 2015 UTC,"He was covering Towns then, so yeah"
sixers,3cz5ey,ziggy8392,-5,Sun Jul 12 06:48:51 2015 UTC,"okay? im not sure why it even matters anyway. 12 pts on 14 shots, 5 TOs, 7-12 from the line is very far from ""killing it"""
sixers,3cz5ey,JoelStampiid,5,Sun Jul 12 07:13:22 2015 UTC,"He had 19 pts, not 12, and 11 rebounds, 3 assists, and 2 blocks.   Say what you want about the other games, but Okafor had a very good game last night."
sixers,3cz5ey,ThaOneNOnly,-2,Sun Jul 12 19:07:16 2015 UTC,Well yeah i meant 12 points on 14 FGAs. 19 pts on 14 FGAs and 12 free throws is very inefficient. Startling that a guy whose #1 strength was his efficiency has yet to have an efficient game against SL talent
sixers,3cz5ey,JoelStampiid,8,Sun Jul 12 21:29:54 2015 UTC,wow.. take a look at how the defense collapses.. every single guy goes way off his man.. this is the power of okafor.
sixers,3cz5ey,girlfriend_pregnant,3,Sun Jul 12 05:37:34 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, but it's more likely that this is the power of summer league"
sixers,3cz5ey,baconshake8,3,Sun Jul 12 14:23:58 2015 UTC,For real - don't focus on Jah just watch the defense attempt to react to every move he makes there. Dance Lakers dance!
sixers,3cz5ey,DariosDentist,5,Sun Jul 12 12:37:52 2015 UTC,Thats a grown man move and the dudes only 19. Thats a superstar move man. Jah just keep working on those free throws and that bank shot and your offense will be unstoppable.
sixers,3cz5ey,J4BRONI,4,Sun Jul 12 07:27:45 2015 UTC,man we needed this so badly.
sixers,3cz5ey,ACPhila,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:08:31 2015 UTC,He's definitely going to be double teamed all this year and depending on how this season goes could be double teamed his whole career
sixers,3cz5ey,iamyourlager,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:59:56 2015 UTC,"insane how he made the entire defense react to what he was doing.  if they can somehow get a stud on the outside that can also command a double team, game over"
sixers,3d15a8,GingerDomination11,3,Sun Jul 12 17:37:30 2015 UTC,he was cookin'

sixers,3d15a8,TrueSixersFan717,2,Sun Jul 12 17:54:42 2015 UTC,He was actually a much better passer than I anticipated.

sixers,3d15a8,SilverSpoonGoon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:55:33 2015 UTC,quite good. Think he'll make the squad
sixers,3d15a8,marksills,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:38:30 2015 UTC,"He has tons of potential.  15 pts in his first game back from injury (8 points in 1 minute), extremely hard worker, can catch fire at any time. Very Curry-ish in terms of being smallest guy on the court, creating his own shot, handles and a great passer when he wants to be, he looks promising and is still young. Id love for him to be a longtime sixer and watch him grow."
sixers,3d15a8,noeltojoel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:20:01 2015 UTC,"seemed to be nervous in the beginning, settled in and became more assertive, got some nice buckets , a couple from 3 , he's able to create his own shot despite being small (i dont remember if he got a shot off against russell) ...cant wait for tonights game"
sixers,3d0iqg,GrownManMove,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:05:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with what you're saying. It's funny how when they both came to the 76ers they both  literally couldn't jump more than 6 inches off the ground I remember watching a game with Chris Webber and he looked like he couldn't jump at all.  When he would Dunk it would look so painful
sixers,3d0iqg,Level80IRL,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:12:04 2015 UTC,"If you notice when he mentions his time in Philly when talking on TNT, he always looks somewhat hesitant and embarrassed about the way he conducted himself here.  Remember, the team bought out his contract so he would go away from the team, as he was just a toxic presence in the locker room."
sixers,3d0iqg,eagsrock20,5,Sun Jul 12 14:15:34 2015 UTC,"The Bynum trade was the one for me when he was healthy and had his head on straight I think he had top 5 center potential. Unfortunately those were huge ifs, but it fortunately brought the end of the Doug Collins Era."
sixers,3d0iqg,FuckingHippies,3,Mon Jul 13 15:11:21 2015 UTC,"I was so stupid excited when I heard we got Bynum. Obviously didn't pan out, but now we have Hinkie and the process, which is a lot better than the 8th seed every year."
sixers,3d0iqg,mistercrinkles,3,Sun Jul 12 17:02:55 2015 UTC,The Bynum announcement easily. I thought he was the key piece we needed. Bought half season tickets. Was a bad year. A very bad time. A very sad time.
sixers,3d0iqg,nocioniisgod,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:01:05 2015 UTC,I think he had top 5 center potential   That's a bold statement /s  duh lol he was easily the 2nd best center in the league
sixers,3d0iqg,marksills,3,Mon Jul 13 02:39:25 2015 UTC,"Webber. With the brand signing, i was old enough to realize given a somewhat old guy coming off a torn achilles a big contract was a bad idea, with Webber I was naive enough to be excited. Although I remember watching Webber's first game and being super annoyed at how much he took that stupid mid range jumper"
sixers,3d0iqg,brssnj45,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:48:19 2015 UTC,"And he missed that game winner off the AI miss free throw against the Kings no less.   After that happened, I knew it was gonna be a tough year."
sixers,3d0iqg,Level80IRL,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:57:10 2015 UTC,He used to always do that midrange bank shot.
sixers,3d0iqg,xychosis,2,Sun Jul 12 15:19:41 2015 UTC,"Webber. Was pretty young at the time (2005, right? I was like, 8 at the time), and viewed the Sixers in a neutral light, but C-Webb was a massive name with the Kings, and just flat-out dominant, and it just sounded so exciting to see him pair up with AI."

sixers,3cyvl0,TheSublimeLight,3,Sun Jul 12 01:19:15 2015 UTC,I don't know how to feel about this! WHERE IS JAH
sixers,3cyvl0,pboly44,17,Sun Jul 12 16:55:47 2015 UTC,After playing less than one year in college he is now going to miss his first two years in the league.  When/If he comes back he is not going to be much of a factor during his first season playing.  The team needs to keep building without expecting anything from Embiid.  If he ever gets on the court than that will just be a bonus.
sixers,3cyvl0,bonobo14,2,Sun Jul 12 01:58:23 2015 UTC,Was them drafting Okafor not a clear sign of building without expecting anything from Embiid? Sure Russell was gone but they could have just as easily gone Mudiay or Super Mario at #3 if they wanted to. Instead they drafted another big man in case Embiid's setback was a big one
sixers,3cyvl0,busterbluthOT,5,Sun Jul 12 06:56:08 2015 UTC,"No, they took Best Player Available."
sixers,3cyvl0,busterbluthOT,3,Sun Jul 12 11:09:05 2015 UTC,What? Okafor was the best player available.
sixers,3cyvl0,muppet_master123,42,Sun Jul 12 12:56:49 2015 UTC,"Bone graft is the same surgery Durant is getting, and it's to help the bone heal properly. It's not like he has to do the original surgery over again, Embiid has still made progress. We should expect this procedure to help him fully heal, since that is the reason he wasn't ready to play yet. Durant was expected to miss 4-6 months, so sixers are being extra cautious."
sixers,3cyvl0,TheyCallMeTheBreeze,11,Sun Jul 12 13:02:59 2015 UTC,"I work in orthopaedic surgery and this is not exactly true. His first surgery was for a stress fracture, meaning that the bone wasn't broken the whole way through. So basically they had to go in the first time, break the bone completely, and secure it with hardware. The second surgery will actually be very similar. In order to introduce the bone graft to the fracture site they are likely going to have to re-break the bone with an osteotome (basically a thin flat piece of metal). Once the bone is broken they will place the bone graft inside the fracture and secure it with a screw. The bone graft does nothing to help healing unless it is actually inside the bone. I can't speak to what his recovery time should be but the idea that this will be different from his original surgery is misleading. I'm still pretty optimistic about his long term outlook but I think we need to be prepared for him to sit out the entire next season."
sixers,3cyvl0,ACPhila,5,Sun Jul 12 01:44:53 2015 UTC,"oh w/o a doubt hes sitting out the entire season, the real question is do you think if given  a full year he can come back healthy and 100%?"
sixers,3cyvl0,TheyCallMeTheBreeze,3,Sun Jul 12 13:55:26 2015 UTC,"That's a tough question to answer, it really depends on what they did in his first surgery. If they didn't use bone graft in the first one, it's reasonable to think that the addition of bone graft might help him to heal better. It's worrisome that he just stopped healing the first time around though, that doesn't really happen especially with someone who is apparently still growing."
sixers,3cyvl0,Schtip,19,Sun Jul 12 19:08:09 2015 UTC,If this is true that kinda makes me feel better.
sixers,3cyvl0,pumadude321,14,Mon Jul 13 13:20:44 2015 UTC,"Cleveland Clinic explanation of it.   Bone grafting refers to a wide variety of surgical methods augmenting or stimulating the formation of new bone where it is needed.  There are four broad clinical situations in which bone grafting is performed:   To stimulate healing of fractures -- either fresh fractures or fractures that have failed to heal after an initial treatment attempt. To stimulate healing between two bones across a diseased joint. This situation is called “arthrodesis” or “fusion”. To regenerate bone which is lost or missing as a result of trauma, infection, or disease. Settings requiring reconstruction or repair of missing bone can vary from filling small cavities to replacing large segments of bone up to 12 inches in length. To improve the bone healing response and regeneration of bone tissue around surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints replacements (e.g. total hip replacement or total knee replacement) or plates and screws used to hold bone alignment."
sixers,3cyvl0,Nyanu,4,Sun Jul 12 01:52:08 2015 UTC,Do you think Embiid could recover within that 4-6 month period? We might be able to actually see him play this year if that's the case. I hope so.

sixers,3czf2e,ACPhila,2,Sun Jul 12 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"A surprising  amount of Okafor hate on this thread...   Listen.. in June, when Silver called Okafor's name as our pick, I was depressed. Distraught even. I mean the ONE player I didn't fucking want in the top ten... I worked myself into such a Russell frenzy that, when we didn't get him, I felt like my heart shrunk three sizes like I was the fucking Grinch or something. But even with all his flaws- which we all will admit are fairly prominent- Okafor is going to be a goddamn stud. You can't watch this and deny that this kid has fucking Fred Astaire feet on the block and flat-out amazing post moves. More advanced than the majority of the players in the NBA. And, okay, he may struggle at first. And he has to work on his defense. And conditioning. And he has to bring his free throw shooting above Deandre Jordan levels. But even with the utterly soul crushing news of Embiid's surgery, we all should feel fine that this kid is our backup plan. Because he's a damn good one. I'm sold."

Also, on that last bucket he clearly traveled, which is something I've noticed often goes uncalled in the NBA. Whenever a big man is surrounded in the post, for some reason the travel whistles go completely silent."
sixers,3czf2e,arjunbsharma,2,Sun Jul 12 05:09:58 2015 UTC,"One thing I noticed is that on spins and other post moves, he tends to jump off his pivot foot. That's awesome because it gives him quickness which is hard to defend, but I wonder if it will make him an easy block target against the pros."

My uncle always taught me (he played in the NBA) to use the glass rather than trying to shoot for the basket.  He just has to work on getting some arc so it has a softer bounce off the rim.

sixers,3d17u2,mistercrinkles,4,Sun Jul 12 18:00:08 2015 UTC,Give as much time to Okafor and Noel as possible. Thompson will be up around 20 minutes.
sixers,3d17u2,JDubKilla,3,Sun Jul 12 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like Thompson doesn't get enough credit. He's only 28, WANTS to be here, and can flat out play. He's also been pretty open about how the tire fire in Sacramento impacted his production. I'm hoping he serves as a mentor in lieu of LRMAM (assuming he doesn't re-up) and gives us some veteran presence. There's certainly a chance he gets flipped at the deadline, but for now I expect him to contribute."

sixers,3cz36x,noeltojoel,10,Sun Jul 12 02:30:36 2015 UTC,"The way i look at it: The only players acceptable to take over Embiid were Wiggins and Parker. If we had a higher pick and took one of the two, they would have played the first year and we would have had atleast a few more wins, and probably wouldnt have gotten third pick this year, but maybe 4-6 range. So, if we never took Embiid, we might not even have Jah right now, and be completely suicidal as a fanbase"
sixers,3cz36x,brivolvn7q,3,Sun Jul 12 02:41:57 2015 UTC,"No, we'd have Parker and Mario. Them with Sauce, Nerlens, and eventually Dario is still a solid lineup."

sixers,3cz36x,I_Dumped_Adele,4,Sun Jul 12 02:52:30 2015 UTC,"We will always get screwed in the lottery because as we all know that's fixed and we are hated. I have to agree, just like taking Jah this year, Embiid had way more upside than anyone left, I hear the Exum talk but I doubt he becomes anything more than a role sixth man.   Hinkie more or less in my mind especially after the robbery of the kings, is one of the best general managers around. I'm feeling pumped to see Noel after his big season come back and play with Jah, a healthy Tony with sauce and Grant/Covington. I like what we have going."
sixers,3cz36x,MatCauthonsHat,3,Sun Jul 12 13:13:16 2015 UTC,"Joel Embiid is 21.  If the surgery is a success and he is ready for the start of next season, he will be 22.  Even if it takes him a year or two to get the feel of the game back he is still young.  Is this good news?  Nope.  It is the end of the world?  Nope.    The Sixers are doing something with Embiid that has never been done.  I'm willing to be patient and wait and see.  Even if he is never 100% healthy, it was still the best pick you could make."
sixers,3cz36x,le_fez,2,Sun Jul 12 11:36:57 2015 UTC,"I was against picking Embiid when they drafted him simply because I had a concern that his injuries would not heal properly and/or plague him and given his lack of experience he would not develop. I still think Exum has the potential to be good and I liked Vonleh as well. I obviously hope that Embiid recovers and gets even remotely close to living up to expectations but unfortunately that less likely. That said i don't think the Sixers made a foolish move in choosing Embiid, I think they rolled the dice on the highest ceiling guy available and it hasn't paid off yet but there's still time.   The other thing is that looking at the draft not only did no one who was available to the Sixers perform up to expectations many were injured, even if they were fluke things, so it's the nature of the beast.   I think your logic regarding injuries is flawed though guys Embiid's size simply do heal differently, their bodies, especially lower backs, knees and feet take more stress than someone with less height."
sixers,3cz36x,ACPhila,2,Sun Jul 12 03:16:50 2015 UTC,tl;dr but Embiid was absolutely worth the risk you cant miss out on generational players if youre already a bad team b/c they might bust.

sixers,3cz36x,mcorcoran3,2,Sun Jul 12 21:41:48 2015 UTC,"Why is 10 points per game the magic number? That is extremely rate for rookies. Elfrid Payton, Smart, Randle, Exum are all intriguing prospects who can play. It does soften the blow that there are no Kevin Durants, but that doesn't mean Joel E was, in hindsight, a better pick than Payton, Smart or Gordon."
sixers,3cz36x,Lyndell,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:47:17 2015 UTC,"Let's say he doesn't hit his projected peak, He could still be a solid back up to our other two dominant Bigs, they will have to sit every once and awhile."
sixers,3cz36x,scurvy_durvy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:00:08 2015 UTC,"Embiid definitely wasn't worth it, and the proof is the fact that he won't have played in his first two seasons minimum, due to injury.   Remember why he slipped, injury concerns. This is a  results oriented league. Right now you literally have nothing to show for that pick. Plus what's the history of big guys who miss their first two years due to injury?  What's the projection for a player who can't get in the floor in his two youngest theoretically healthiest years?  Say what you want but I'd much rather have Exum or Marcus Smart, or even Elfrid Payton. They are a known quantity. For now Embiid is just another Greg Oden."

We could have Jim Lynum, Doug Moe, Fred Carter, John Lucas, Johnny Davis, Larry Brown (lets not forget he wanted to trade AI but couldn't because of Matt Geiger), Randy Ayers, Chris Ford, Jim O'Brien, Maurice Cheeks, Tony DiLeo, Eddie Jordan, or Doug Collins as head coach.    And we could have Jim Lynum, John Lucas, Brad Greenburg, Billy King, or Ed Stefanski as GM.    The Sixers haven't won since '83. They haven't been competitive since Barkley or Iverson. In both instances coaches and GMs failed to provide a quality roster or player development program. Instead they collected a paycheck. Floating from one head coaching gig to the next with broadcasting jobs in between. I find that nepotism infinitely more insulting than what Hinkie is doing.   I like how the current staff is building from the ground up and putting themselves in a position to draft early and often.     Sure Embiid is going to sit out another year, and yeah someone else could have been drafted. But it was the right pick at the time which is something that couldn't be said for, I don't know, Shawn Bradley, Sharone Wright, Clarence Weatherspoon, Jerry Stackhouse (traded after two seasons), Tim Thomas (traded after two seasons), Larry Hughes (traded after two seasons), or Evan Turner (not traded soon enough)."

sixers,3cxg1w,sportsflush,19,Sat Jul 11 17:27:39 2015 UTC,Embiid & Okafor probably work better on the court.
sixers,3cxg1w,BCSinReverse,8,Sat Jul 11 17:19:39 2015 UTC,"How so?  Embiid and Okafor are both low post bangers.  Yea embiid can hit the outside shot but that's not what we drafted him for.  They would just take away space from eachother.  Just like Furkan did in the summer league.  Noel is not much of an offensive threat, okafor or embiid would have more room to work.  Then defensively Noel is the best and will be able to play the 4.  Which okafor obviously can't and would put more stress on embiid a foot."
sixers,3cxg1w,sportsflush,10,Sat Jul 11 17:51:13 2015 UTC,Embiid & Okafor compliment each far better offensively due to Embiid's ability to hit an outside shot.  Noel is the best defensively but Embiid also has/had the potential to be a really good defender as well.  At the end of the day the best combos would have been either Embiid/Okafor or Embiid/Noel.  I understand everyone wants to try to be as positive as they can about bad news but you also have to be honest about the reality that Embiid has/had the highest ceiling of any of the three bigs on the roster and would have complimented Okafor and Noel better than they will each other.
sixers,3cxg1w,BCSinReverse,4,Sat Jul 11 17:56:02 2015 UTC,I agree Embiid and Okafor would have worked or could still work.  Okafor is the only guy who is strictly a Center.  Embiid is the most flexible because he stretches the floor.  Noel needs to get a knock down 18 footer.  Okafor and Noel is gonna be rough on the spacing.
sixers,3cxg1w,Iputthescrewintuna,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:02:05 2015 UTC,"Noel's ability to put the ball on the floor and drive from 12-18 feet will mitigate the spacing somewhat. Defenders won't just be able to play off him because if he gets a step he's quick and athletic enough to finish at the rim.  I agree, he still needs a jump shot that is at worst mediocre."
sixers,3cxg1w,aBagorn,3,Sat Jul 11 19:40:59 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong I would never complain about having okafor/embiid on the court at them same time.  I would take those two over the majority of the front courts in the league.  I just feel an embiid Noel or okafor combo would be best.  Either way I hope embiid gets healthy.  I was just as excited about him as the next guy.  I'm just not freaking out due to having okafor and Noel.
sixers,3cxg1w,sportsflush,5,Sun Jul 12 01:07:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been preparing for this the whole time. I feel good about Noel and Okafor. From what I can tell, it seems like their deficiencies are the others strengths so if they get on the same page it could be great. Definitely more interested in the Saric situation now and hopefully if we can get him over here next year. We could still end up with a strong frontcourt."
sixers,3cxg1w,_TheLoneRangers,3,Sat Jul 11 18:31:49 2015 UTC,"I too dont think it is a big deal for this season and for this stage of ""the plan"". The obviously concerns are for his future and for the Sixers future. Embiid is clearly one of the main pieces of this team and if the plan is to be good, and contend, in a few years we will need him fit and at his best.  With this the whole ""Can the Sixers make the playoffs"" talks are over and we are probably going to finish with another very high pick so that's good i guess."
sixers,3cxg1w,eagsrock20,16,Sat Jul 11 17:59:19 2015 UTC,Hello darkness my old friend....
sixers,3cxg1w,djl04614,30,Sat Jul 11 18:02:55 2015 UTC,Taking the slightly optimistic view here: the guy just grew another two inches and is still growing into his body. Maybe this will help him heal and he has 16 months from today to be ready to suit up.
sixers,3cxg1w,jdol06,19,Sat Jul 11 18:04:26 2015 UTC,plus we have Okafor to basically fill his position. Now we won't be stressing over lineups or whether one of the 3 bigs gets moved
sixers,3cxg1w,tomchaney479,2,Sat Jul 11 17:24:57 2015 UTC,"There's generally an upper limit on height/weight for centers.  Once guys get too tall/big, they tend to have lower extremity issues.  Big Z and Yao come to mind."
sixers,3cxg1w,andhily,34,Sat Jul 11 17:36:05 2015 UTC,I'm more proud of Embiid and the Sixers than anything. They aren't goverened by instant gratification and really are putting his health above everything.  I'm sure quite a few doctors said he could probably play on it and he probably would have looked amazing until he got reinjured or hurt somewhere else for compensating.  This will all be worth it when he is able to have a 8-10 year career.
sixers,3cxg1w,RkyAzure,5,Sat Jul 11 18:51:18 2015 UTC,"I really hope he does. I can take this but if he never plays more than 50 games a season after, it will break my heart."
sixers,3cxg1w,valechaira,12,Sat Jul 11 17:35:50 2015 UTC,Big Z did
sixers,3cxg1w,patelt91,2,Sat Jul 11 18:44:03 2015 UTC,I thought Z only missed 1 season
sixers,3cxg1w,thebigthunk,4,Sat Jul 11 18:49:05 2015 UTC,He actually missed most of the time between 97-01.
sixers,3cxg1w,thebigthunk,4,Sat Jul 11 19:53:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to be unrealistic, but this isn't oden level shit. This isn't a rebroken bone or some super damning injury. This is a current injury that has healed to the point of him doing everything but playing in practices that stopped healing. There is no pain when he plays.  We shouldn't say that he IS going to come back but we also shouldn't write him off. The kid is only ~20 and has a lot less wear and tear on his body then other people who this injury ended their career."
sixers,3cxg1w,brivolvn7q,3,Sat Jul 11 21:50:12 2015 UTC,"Concerned that it could be is not the same as believe it to be probable. He's not saying he will have a long productive career, just that he still has hope."

sixers,3cxg1w,LRW35,3,Sat Jul 11 17:28:59 2015 UTC,Embiid will eventually play. Just unlikely hes the franchise player. And thats what sucks. Anything we get from him is a bonus. On to the next one i guess.

We have 2 who should be able to hold down the fort, and even excel in this league. You draft 3 big men with the hopes that one of them pans out. Even if Embiid never plays, we still have a good shot with Nerlens and Jahlil"
sixers,3cxg1w,AssholeAlert3000,7,Sat Jul 11 20:47:10 2015 UTC,"This sucks, but it's the right decision. The worst thing that could have happened was to put Embiid out on the court when his foot wasn't completely ready. That's what made Oden's problems worse."
sixers,3cxg1w,joelinator,3,Sat Jul 11 20:09:58 2015 UTC,"Seriously. We've had a decade of medical advancements and also previous situations to learn from on our side.

Okafor could still be a dominant offensive big man and I believe he has the work ethic to get better on D. He and Nerlens could be a dominant duo for years to come no matter what."

We're going to be a bottom 4 team next year in my opinion. Giving us a great shot at Simmons, Skal, Brown, or Ingram.  This should also allow Jah to properly develop this year without having to share time with Joel. With all that being said, FUCK. I just feel so bad for the kid.

I really believe if he can get past these injuries that he'll still be a top 10 player in this league.  That being said, if he never plays a game in the NBA, it will be okay because Hinkie has stuck to the playbook. No team hits on every single draft, no one can be perfect in that regard - they can only make the best possible decision with the knowledge they have at the time.  If the Sixers didn't pick Embiid would we be closer to a championship with Aaron Gordon? Dante Exum? Marcus Smart? I would still 100% pick Embiid in that spot even if I knew he would miss his first two seasons.  Yes it sucks. Yes it's disheartening. But I'm still stoked for this season. Let's watch Noel grow into a defensive force, let's see Okafor dominate in the post as a rookie and let's see Sauce rain threes all day.  Stay off /r/nba for awhile and turn off WIP. Remember that this is just a bump in a long road that I still believe, as much as yesterday, leads to glory."

sixers,3cxg1w,BCSinReverse,3,Sat Jul 11 18:50:47 2015 UTC,"Didn't they say we had to wait another week anyway? Why all of a sudden now we get the news? And why have we not heard anything from the sixers yet? Is the front office close to Pompey? Where did he get his source from? Because he doesn't mention it at all in his artcile. All he said was ""The source said"". What source?"
sixers,3cxg1w,Nyanu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:04:03 2015 UTC,"It's probably better just to accept the reality of the situation so you can get onto stage two, anger."
sixers,3cxg1w,BCSinReverse,2,Sat Jul 11 18:29:54 2015 UTC,I'll accept the reality of the situation when I get a reliable source.
sixers,3cxg1w,Nyanu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:48:22 2015 UTC,Keith Pompey has proven himself to be pretty reliable regarding the Sixers.
sixers,3cxg1w,BCSinReverse,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:02:58 2015 UTC,But we've heard nothing from anywhere else. We're only trusting his word. Was he feeding off someone else's sources before? I guess we'll see how this turns out though. I'm calling foolery.

sixers,3cxg1w,ACPhila,0,Sat Jul 11 19:03:20 2015 UTC,"Trust the process?  I'm not trying to be a jerk...  what is the consensus among /r/sixers about the ""process""?"
sixers,3cxg1w,macbeth_htebcam,4,Sat Jul 11 19:08:26 2015 UTC,most of us trust math so we trust the process.
sixers,3cxg1w,Lorax1515,-2,Sat Jul 11 19:10:30 2015 UTC,"the process hasn't lead to any positive results thus far. You have won a total of 37 in the past 2 regular seasons, I'm no mathematician but that not very good at all. If I was a sixers fan I would be upset by this shitty process. The product isn't even watchable. Take Utah for example they where able to get better without making a mockery of themselves. Now your going into a 3rd season and the outlook isn't going to be any different. You can't draw any free agents because the players hate Hinkie and you have created a losing culture."
sixers,3cxg1w,ACPhila,5,Sat Jul 11 18:31:31 2015 UTC,"The process is not guaranteed success, it just tries to give you the best chance of success. You can't judge it now, it takes time to see if the decisions pay off. Embiid may not work out, but maybe the Kings get the number one pick next year and it transfers to us? It's all about having as many opportunities to have a home run as possible."
sixers,3cxg1w,jjohn268,4,Sat Jul 11 17:48:42 2015 UTC,"take Utah for example, they will never win a title ever. good example."
sixers,3cxg1w,ACPhila,3,Sat Jul 11 19:30:18 2015 UTC,"You are using Utah as an example? A 45 win team tops. They have to bank on Exum to be the guy they can build around. Gobert is a nice defensive anchor, but just like we have Noel and just like the Clippers have Jordan, they are all 3rd options at best.    You can't draw any free agents because the players hate Hinkie and you have created a losing culture.   What free agent was the Sixers targeting? Tell me since you seem to know more about the SIxers then any insider. Oh wait, you are talking out of your ass once again.  And the Jazz aren't drawing any free agents either.   By the way, I have no problem with criticism of Hinkie's plan, but you can do it without looking like a jackass."

sixers,3cxg1w,Schtip,-2,Sat Jul 11 22:44:22 2015 UTC,Called it.  The pick was an absolute disaster
sixers,3cxg1w,Sdt6023,5,Sat Jul 11 20:24:42 2015 UTC,Who else were we suppose to get though? You have to go get the best player possible and risk that Embiid pans out.
sixers,3cxg1w,TU_Vesthis,-1,Sun Jul 12 00:11:31 2015 UTC,"Anybody. Embiid was a stay away for me. 7 footer with a broken foot. Stay. Away. Would have rather we drafted Exum, Aaron Gordon or Randle at the time. The risk on him was one I didn't want to make. We need to get guys into our system to learn and start developing. And we took 2 guys in that draft in the lottery that won't play for us for at least 2 years. Sorry guys, that's a disaster. A risk we didn't need to take."
sixers,3cxg1w,Sdt6023,4,Sat Jul 11 23:57:54 2015 UTC,"Dumb as shit.   Embiid is a potential generational player. Notice how I said ""is,"" not ""was."" First of all, this isn't over by a long shot. I do NOT want a potential role player, sixth man, or overall average player. I don't care if Embiid was a 20% chance to reach his potential. You take it with a player like this."
sixers,3cxg1w,TU_Vesthis,3,Sat Jul 11 18:11:43 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's called a risk for a reason. I've seen enough NBA history to know not to gamble on 7 footers with foot issues. And you're right. His career isn't over by a long shot. But it doesn't look good.
sixers,3cxg1w,Schtip,2,Sat Jul 11 17:57:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I am still just fine with the pick. I really don't think, for example, Marcus Smart would make us a much better team or have much more hope. I'm still very confident in our plan -- and if we get ANYTHING out of Embiid, it'll be great."
sixers,3cxg1w,patelt91,2,Sat Jul 11 18:06:30 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but the Sixers aren't just going to draft someone who can play right away. They're going to take the best overall player no matter what, to be honest I'd rather keep Embiid knowing the risk he can be a huge bust opposed to missing out on him and he turns out to be a really good player."
sixers,3cxg1w,Vandredd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:15:11 2015 UTC,"Thats what people said when it came to ACL injuries,... which has clearly been disproven when you look at guys like Noel and AP --- people need to realize the scientific advancement is ridiculous, we will just have to sit tight and wait till Embiid is done growing, and once he's 8 feet tall, no one will say shit to us Sixers fans and ""how bad of a pick"" Embiid was lol"
sixers,3cxg1w,Schtip,-1,Sat Jul 11 19:11:12 2015 UTC,Someone that will actually play in thr NBA would be better.  This entire ponzi scheme only held validity based on Embiid coming in a being thre amazing player all you cultists proclaimed he was.  Right now he has less value than expiring contract.
sixers,3cxg1w,Vandredd,6,Sat Jul 11 21:05:14 2015 UTC,Who said he's not going to fucking play? Embiid isn't fucking retired yet.
sixers,3cxg1w,BrentoMussolini,0,Sat Jul 11 21:17:01 2015 UTC,Embiid will not play 50 games in the NBA.  Its over.  Deal with accepting the ponzi scheme for what it is.

sixers,3cyvot,chipsvisor,3,Sun Jul 12 02:36:36 2015 UTC,"Durant isn't nearly as big as Embiid. And like it or not, that is important. Also because Embiid has only been playing basketball for a short while and his body hasn't been able to handle it well."
sixers,3cyvot,nimgame,2,Sun Jul 12 03:46:26 2015 UTC,Isn't Durant 6'10-6'11?
sixers,3cyvot,Tell_Me_Random_Facts,2,Sun Jul 12 12:08:19 2015 UTC,"He isn't 7-2 ,270lbs. Durant is built like a stick."
sixers,3cyvot,nimgame,2,Mon Jul 13 03:32:48 2015 UTC,Part of it is that this'll be the 3rd year in a row Embiid will miss significant time with an injury. By the time next season rolls around he won't have played meaningful basketball in over 3 years. I can't think of any player that's missed that much time who came back at the same level they left.
sixers,3cyvot,Black_Dumbledore,2,Sun Jul 12 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"He'll definitely be rusty, no debating that. But if anything, recovery wise, he fairs better than Durant due to age."

(Not including the shortened lockout season when he played all 66 games.) Now Embiid on the other hand has not played a single NBA game. He is also bigger than KD.

sixers,3d2vtz,MeAndEmbiid,4,Mon Jul 13 02:47:31 2015 UTC,"i think this whole process was to get Wiggins   Hinkie's plan was not based soley on winning something with 20% odds.   Also I really dont think their opinion on MCW changed that much. There were rumors of him being moved on draft day, and im sure there were talks.   And knowing what they knew at the time, trading Embiid, saric, what became the lakers pick, and our 2017 pick is way too much for wiggins.   Id also much rather have Dario and our 2017 than peyton"
sixers,3d2vtz,marksills,2,Mon Jul 13 02:54:57 2015 UTC,"Cleveland drafted Wiggins. They already had Kyrie Irving, and they would not have been interested in MCW."
sixers,3d2vtz,bmkcacb30,0,Mon Jul 13 02:54:01 2015 UTC,I forgot it was Cleveland. But I still think both picks and a conditional plus MCW would have gotten the job done.
sixers,3d2vtz,bmkcacb30,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:31:30 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be a troll or anything. But that would make no sense for Cleveland. He would have 2 years left on an escalating rookie contract. Irving was on his way to MAX money regardless if LeBron makes it to Cleveland.   Trading Wiggins away for MCW would require (in order to justify the trade) Cleveland to re-sign MCW at the end of his rookie deal... which would be significant in and of itself, on top of any salary kicker in the CBA for winning rookie of the year.  Paying potentially 8 figures for a backup point guard when you already have Kyrie Irving... no way. Dan Gilbert is a turd burger, but he is not Ranadive...   Cleveland's goal was to acquire a Superstar that summer. MCW was not going to make that trade possible from a talent point of view. (or Hinkie would have accomplished that). Further, his rookie scale contract that he is on, would not have been valuable enough, or large enough to compensate for trading for a max guy.  I know we all loved MCW, but he is the 20th best pg in the league? at best. Teams do not trade away 19 year old, potentially franchise changing players for 23 year olds due big money, and are best case scenario, the 3rd or 4th best starter on a good team.  The trade makes little sense personnel-wise or contract logistic-wise."
sixers,3d2vtz,GOATrieIrving,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:41:23 2015 UTC,"Noel, Okafor and (hopefully) Embiid is pretty damn good. After the draft this season, the Sixers are looking great, providing Embiid is healthy.  There's something to be said about championship-winning big men like Okafor. I would be very surprised if he doesn't become a perennial all star, the guy can win games and get it done. HNNGGG post moves."

sixers,3cxjwd,tokeallday,6,Sat Jul 11 18:32:29 2015 UTC,"It's an unfortunate situation, but the selection of Embiid was high risk.  In his case, the potential reward was worth it.  He was expected to sit out the season and then become a potential superstar after he recovered.  Maybe he'll never fully recover.  Maybe he will, who knows?  The point is, given who he could have been, who would you have selected at 3 last year instead?  The best point guard prospects last year were Dante Exum and Marcus Smart.  I'd still take my chances with Embiid next year.  Elfrid Payton?  I think they can do a lot better.  They just brought in Stauskas for free.  Embiid was the pick, all we can do is hope he can take the court one day.  In the meantime, we'll have a solid young core of recent draftees in Noel, Okafor, and Sauce, along with the other guys, some of which may turn into solid roleplayers.  The sky is not falling, it's just a setback."

If Embiid is one of those, it'll be a huge bummer because we all love his personality and salivate at his upside, but this is the exact reason why we have all these extra firsts and its the exact reason Hinkie will keep taking BPA and worry about fit later."

Part of the reason why I ""trust the process"" is because it inherently provides protection against really bad luck, e.g. Embiid's health. The immediate future for the Sixers is a 4/5 combo of Noel and Okafor, both of whom have top of the league talent.   I'm not happy, but I'm not crying.

sixers,3cyky4,Kingdariush,10,Sat Jul 11 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"It's pretty easy to get an idea of how good a player is by looking at numbers beyond counting stats. MCW, for example, was always an inefficient scorer with a fairly bad assist/turnover ratio and a lousy offensive rating. We know his stats were also a bit inflated because of the team's league-leading pace during his rookie season.   It's more likely that untalented teammates camouflage a player's abilities to contribute in a more stable environment where they would be only be asked to do what they do best (but I don't think that being on a bad team hampers development as long as the team is well-coached). Someone like Canaan wouldn't be charged with running point for extended minutes if he was on a team like, say, Cleveland, and in a Delly role."
sixers,3cyky4,lilgodboy,3,Sat Jul 11 23:50:11 2015 UTC,"Yep. MCW's undoing was all about inefficiency.   Terrible around the rim and beyond the arc, he might have been held in higher regard if he was at least efficient at one or the other, but you couldn't have both. Shooting sub-.500 around the rim was probably his undoing. When you see players like Dragic and Knight over 70% from the same spot you kinda know you have a middling point who hasn't put it together."

sixers,3cyky4,marksills,3,Sun Jul 12 05:29:22 2015 UTC,"As already mentioned, MCW had good counting stats, but look at the rate stats. This is similar to stats in baseball. A player may have 30 HRs and a 100 RBIs, but if his on base percentage is .300 and his batting average is .250, you know he's nothing special. MCW had a horrible FG% and advanced stats such as true shooting percentage only solidified this notion.   Without going into advanced stats, just use your eyes. MCW made poor choices, forced shots, turned the ball over too much, and had other flaws. He also was 22 years old, so drastic improvement seems unlikely.   On the other hand, Wiggins last year had a high usage rate and as expected put up big numbers. But with the eye test, you can see he has the tools to be something special, and he was only 19 years old."
sixers,3cyky4,jjohn268,2,Sun Jul 12 00:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah but if dude proves he can consistently hit 100 RBIs and 30 HRs sometimes you just say fuck that advanced stats sheet. Not saying MCW was great, but I thought we could go extra big in a world of small ball, bring the Defense back."
sixers,3cyky4,Lyndell,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"Except power is very much highly rated by advanced metrics. If you wanna make a comparison, take someone like Ben Revere, a high BA hitter with a low OBP and no power output, but lots of stolen bases and no arm in the outfield. His basic stats looks very solid, but he's not as impressive as his basic statistics make him seem."
sixers,3cyky4,xychosis,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:51:41 2015 UTC,I agree with what your saying but if a dude is constantly hitting .250 w/ 30HR and 100RBI he would be a perineal allstar
sixers,3cyky4,FriendlyFreeman,2,Sun Jul 12 20:57:33 2015 UTC,"a star player, regardless of position will elevate his teammates and you will see improvement as a team. A good player on a bad team will simply put up good numbers and the teams will continue to be a bad team.   Granted it's an extreme case but look at Cleveland in the playoffs, a good player or even a very good player would have put up some decent numbers as the Cavs got swept by the Hawks while LeBron James was able to carry them to game six of the finals."

I really like Ben Simmons and I hope the Sixers can get him. After that though, idk how many picks they'd keep. depends on the picks I guess. Heard this draft class is viewed as a little weak, but they haven't played yet. We'll have to see who is worth keeping if they use all the picks. Really depends on how the talent level in this draft is viewed, imo."
sixers,3czliu,Shieldz123,2,Sun Jul 12 05:44:35 2015 UTC,The one thing I would be worried about is finding playing time for all these picks.  Plus if Embiid plays next year and Saric comes over.  You could have a top 10 pick playing 20 minutes a game.  These guys need minutes to develop
sixers,3czliu,Shieldz123,2,Sun Jul 12 05:48:48 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. I'm up for trading some of the picks to move up for someone really special. The problem is that if they were to trade up for Simmons, it'd have to be the 1st pick (as of right now), and 1st picks rarely get traded. Especially if the value of the picks they'd trade to move up are viewed as a question mark like they may be right now."

sixers,3czj3c,LRW35,3,Sun Jul 12 05:16:34 2015 UTC,"Starting/back up points guards of top teams, listed by margin of victory: Curry/Livingston Paul/Rivers (or Crawford) Parker/Mills Teague/Schroder Irving/Dellie Lillard/Steve Blake? Beverly/Prigioni  Point being: It is really helpful to have a world-class point guard. It's not necessary. Plenty of contending teams have a very good point guard.  And very good point guards are plentiful. Some of the teams above have two.    And that's assuming MCW will be a very good PG. Jury's out. It's hard to say MCW is ""valuable"" in that sense, even if he did look decent in the playoffs. Certainly not more valuable than a top 10 pick. (sidenote: Heat could be FUN this year)"
sixers,3czj3c,snausages21,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:56:26 2015 UTC,"Great point. I wonder if JKidd relates to the kind of player MCW is. Developed shooting so much later in his career, became one of the NBA's leading 3PT of all time."
sixers,3czj3c,marksills,2,Sun Jul 12 05:22:21 2015 UTC,"I think so. MCW has a lot of good qualities, and think he'll be a fairly good player, but I think you can find guys like him relatively easily. Also, with the bigs we have, shooting is important. Kinda have to build a team specifically with MCW, and our key players dont fit that mold."
sixers,3czj3c,danielsilva12345,2,Sun Jul 12 05:43:06 2015 UTC,yes; that pick can be top 7 this year
sixers,3czj3c,Feelfreetoupvote,2,Sun Jul 12 05:23:56 2015 UTC,Won't know until we see where that pick falls
sixers,3czj3c,Cold_and_Composed,2,Sun Jul 12 05:27:48 2015 UTC,"Just know without the trade we would have won more games, there would be no Jah."
sixers,3czj3c,lilgodboy,2,Sun Jul 12 13:12:02 2015 UTC,"The venom towards MCW from some Sixers fans is really unseemly. He was traded. It's not like he abandoned the team or said mean things about Philly.  MCW came into the league with questions about his jumper. That hasn't changed. If he was a reliable shooter, he'd be a really good PG. But without that weapon, he's inefficient and always working against a defense that clogs the paint. He's young enough that he still could improve, but the Sixers were smart to sell high because of that uncertainty."
sixers,3czj3c,ACPhila,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:52:19 2015 UTC,"we're not mad at him or anything. I hope he does well just stating facts, hes an average PG."
sixers,3czj3c,jondonbovi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:08:45 2015 UTC,MCW would be an all star if he could shoot. But he can't and he's not skilled enough to get by without it. He's going to be 24 and hasnt made any progress.
sixers,3czj3c,flyingdeathmachine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:10:59 2015 UTC,"No doubt. Having to root for MCW to learn a jump shot for yet another year would be rough...and when he probably doesn't learn it, then we'd be rueing that they didn't trade him when there was an opportunity.  Plus the Lakers are gonna suck this year."
sixers,3czj3c,kip_chelly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:39:41 2015 UTC,would you trade justise for that same protected lakers pick?
sixers,3czj3c,kip_chelly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"No, but we're in win-now mode. We'll see what this year brings, but definitely not if Justise is a ROY candidate."
sixers,3czj3c,kip_chelly,3,Sun Jul 12 05:14:56 2015 UTC,"MCW won ROY in a weak draft, it inflated his value; his true value is a fringe starting caliber PG, due to his poor shooting and turnover totals. The Lakers pick is insane value for him, considering the Lakers will have the worst record in the West this year. Also, I love Justise."
sixers,3czj3c,thisisnotme12244,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:35:04 2015 UTC,"Great point, I think he's a better fit on the Bucks than the 6ers now with Okafor. He needs that spacing and clean offense. What do you love about Justise? He looks good so far, pedigree as well, but I don't watch college BB so I haven't seen much"
sixers,3czj3c,thisisnotme12244,3,Sun Jul 12 05:39:43 2015 UTC,"he's athletic as fuck, a hell of a slasher and defender, if he ever solidifies his shot he will be a star. He's a beast, yall got the steal of the draft."
sixers,3czj3c,ThaOneNOnly,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:12:33 2015 UTC,"It was great value, he should be a good player for the Heat."
sixers,3czj3c,Feelfreetoupvote,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:48:23 2015 UTC,"In their head the heat are win now, but they aren't even close to winning now.  I know they think they will get a big named free agent next year, but so did the Lakers"
sixers,3czj3c,Level80IRL,3,Sun Jul 12 06:46:19 2015 UTC,"In their head the heat are win now, but they aren't even close to winning now.   Really? I think the Heat are loaded. Dragic, Wade, Deng, Bosh, and Whiteside is a hell of a starting 5.   If everyone stays healthy, I could easily see them going far in the East."
sixers,3czj3c,Feelfreetoupvote,0,Sun Jul 12 05:36:38 2015 UTC,If everyone is healthy they win the east.
sixers,3czj3c,thisisnotme12244,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:06:19 2015 UTC,Over Lebron/Love/Irving? That seems a bit of a stretch.
sixers,3czj3c,thisisnotme12244,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:13:31 2015 UTC,Bosh wade goran. Gap isn't that much. Whiteside is the wildcard
sixers,3czj3c,thisisnotme12244,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:09:10 2015 UTC,Where do you see us landing in this year's playoffs?
sixers,3czj3c,EUPW,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:58:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe a 7.  I live down here in Miami, so I watch a lot of Heat bball.  I just don't see that what they added is going to be a big improvement, plus Wade will most likely play 50-60 games.  Honestly, I would have let him walk.  I know everyone was saying Bosh got hurt, but even when he was playing they were struggling for an 8 seed"
sixers,3czj3c,Level80IRL,2,Sun Jul 12 05:39:34 2015 UTC,"Really? I see us as at 4-5 in the East. Talented enough for 3, but first year chemistry and health lands us lower. I'm willing to bet my Sunpass we get 6 or better haha"
sixers,3czj3c,Hirshologist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:42:25 2015 UTC,"So off topic...I drive a company car that is signed up for toll by plate.  But only the toll roads in Miami take toll by plate at this point, so I have to constantly take it off, hide it in the that silver bag depending on which road I'm on.  I panic depending on which road I'm on.  Get on the turnpike near Sunlife, great toll by plate, express lane on 95...fuck me, where did I put that stupid SunPass"
sixers,3czj3c,dinolarry,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:08:51 2015 UTC,"Wait, doesn't the Sunpass work for all Toll-by-plate roads? Why don't you just keep the Sunpass up and have them pay that bill?"
sixers,3czj3c,marksills,2,Sun Jul 12 06:16:46 2015 UTC,"Because my company doesn't want me to use Sunpass if the road is toll by plate.   It's such a pain in the ass...they don't get it because where they are everything is just EZpass.  It's the accounting people, they have no clue what goes on in the field"
sixers,3czj3c,dinolarry,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:32:49 2015 UTC,uhh... Thanks Ellen Pao.
sixers,3czj3c,marksills,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:40:45 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely. I'm not a big believer in MCW (an historically inaccurate shooter for his position) and my only real worry is that the Lakers will get a top-3 pick this year and improve a lot in 2016-2017.
sixers,3czj3c,dinolarry,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:42:37 2015 UTC,Julius Randle is looking great so far.
sixers,3czj3c,marksills,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:30:19 2015 UTC,Depends on how healthy Kobe is this year.
sixers,3czj3c,dinolarry,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:34:53 2015 UTC,"I liked MCW personally.  He made a great first impression, leading us to a win over the the Heat and their big 3.    Whether the trade works out or not depends on what kind of pick we end up getting and who we draft.   I know a lot of people are criticising MCW right now and it's true he had his share of weaknesses (shooting), but he did play very good/great defense and he had a really good ability to get to the hole.     I personally would have preferred to stick with him and continue developing him.  He was never going to be a great player, but he could be a valuable piece with some of the tools he offers."
sixers,3cyvwj,shakabraj,7,Sun Jul 12 01:05:44 2015 UTC,"Needs some work on his strength.  If he hits the gym for a little bit, his shot will improve.  He front rims a lot, but I'd rather have a guy front rim, with a strength problem, than miss wide, with an awful shot.  His passing is great, his chemistry with the bigs is great, the guy knows his role on that squad.  He knows he was brought in to be a pass first PG, to pass down low to the bigs.  He does it well.  On top of that, he hustles every single play.  As a Zona fan and Sixers fan, I love him and I know he can, and will, get time this season.    Strength is a non-issue in my book, since all guys work on it all the time.  We have until October 27th, the first day of the regular season, for him to build up some strength.  No problem for that."
sixers,3cyvwj,pumadude321,5,Sun Jul 12 02:46:27 2015 UTC,He seems to have some nice chemistry with Jah. I hope he can make the team.
sixers,3cyvwj,muchacho2149,3,Sun Jul 12 01:08:35 2015 UTC,"I really like the way he plays, but dont think he's talented enough to be an nba player"
sixers,3cyvwj,marksills,3,Sun Jul 12 03:53:52 2015 UTC,not worth a roster spot
sixers,3cyvwj,vayuu,4,Sun Jul 12 01:35:32 2015 UTC,"He should go to the D-League, he could be a decent player, but needs some work"
sixers,3cyvwj,thisisnotme12244,3,Sun Jul 12 01:36:43 2015 UTC,He'll have a good career in Europe

sixers,3cxv9g,dspm90,6,Sat Jul 11 19:29:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on how Okafor grows as a player. Hes a major faceup threat, and I can see our coaching staff helping him further develop his mid ranged shot. I think its not the perfect pairing but it will work."
sixers,3cxv9g,LRW35,3,Sat Jul 11 19:38:29 2015 UTC,whenever we play them at the same time it's gonna have to be cannan/hollis/covington in the floor with them.... maximize that space
sixers,3cxv9g,danielsilva12345,2,Sat Jul 11 19:44:26 2015 UTC,Presumably that'd be a significant amount of time? Do you see the two of them starting?
sixers,3cxv9g,lilgodboy,4,Sat Jul 11 19:48:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's any scenario in which Nerlens/Okafor, at least if healthy, aren't starters. If spacing and defense are terrible with the combo, then there could be adjustments to that strategy."
sixers,3cxv9g,SilverSpoonGoon,5,Sat Jul 11 19:55:16 2015 UTC,"Even if it's not incredibly effective, I assume you guys are at the stage where it's more important to play them for their development than for overall success this season?"
sixers,3cxv9g,lilgodboy,4,Sat Jul 11 19:58:47 2015 UTC,"Yea, I mean I assume that was gonna be the case even if Embiid was healthy for this year. We're still in the ""see what we've got in these young guys"" stage."
sixers,3cxv9g,ThaOneNOnly,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:39:01 2015 UTC,That's definitely the case.

But seriously there are teams that have similar pairings, Memphis, LAC, Chicago, Sacramento is going to try and do it, Cleveland was doing it in the playoffs with Mozgov and TT."
sixers,3cxv9g,throwaweight7,2,Sat Jul 11 20:01:23 2015 UTC,blake can kind of shoot that mid range jumper dough
sixers,3cxv9g,jjohn268,2,Sat Jul 11 21:23:07 2015 UTC,I think both Nerlens and Jahlil will be taking midrange jumpers from start to finish    dough   dude
sixers,3cxv9g,Hirshologist,3,Sat Jul 11 21:38:03 2015 UTC,"Offensively it will be a challenge and adjustments will need to be made, but defensively I think the pairing can work. Noel is just so athletic and can cover so much ground."
sixers,3cxv9g,InboardPG,3,Sat Jul 11 20:17:21 2015 UTC,"As it stands right now, it's a tough/bad fit offensively.  They are both strictly centers with neither having the good enough shot to play the 4.    The bright side is that we don't have to win right now, so we can afford to let those guys take as much time to learn the position and hopefully develop a decent jump shot."
sixers,3cxv9g,Hirshologist,2,Sat Jul 11 21:14:24 2015 UTC,Looks like a shit ton of responsibility is going to fall on Noel. He has a few seasons to develop offensively while becoming a much bigger leader for the team.
sixers,3cxv9g,803Tiger72,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:08:22 2015 UTC,Okafor 2.  He needs to develop a jump shot.

sixers,3d1wwt,srekalal,14,Sun Jul 12 21:23:29 2015 UTC,"Okafor is hands down BPA over everyone who went pick 4-60. Porzingis is a twig and no doubt has potential, but cmon.. Jah is the best back to the basket center coming out of college in a loooong time."

I responded to this comment with a very short rap I wrote on the spot about Hinkie and it referenced him being Jewish. I was pretty sure that I had heard that he was, but I couldn't find the answer on Google so I mistakenly decided to ask /r/sixers.

I don't think either are tied into each other because all Hinkie has done really was draft the kid. He's stayed by his side, but other people like Brett Brown, and his doctors have a much bigger role in Joel Embiid as a player. Excited for the next David Robinson tho"
sixers,3cyj31,Kingdariush,0,Sat Jul 11 23:20:58 2015 UTC,Robinson played 4 years in college; won awards; stayed healthy; then served in the Navy  Embiid played in just 28 games in college and couldn't stay healthy.  647- that's how many minutes of college basketball he played (22 minutes/game)

sixers,3cxi2m,jjohn268,3,Sat Jul 11 17:52:08 2015 UTC,"Hinkie's plan is to approach this with multiple pronged approach. We have Okafor, who can be a franchise player. And we will have a shot at he #1 overall pick once again. Hinkie has not put all his eggs into the basket known as EMbiid."
sixers,3cxi2m,jjohn268,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:46:24 2015 UTC,"We've shot for the No. 1 overall pick for two straight years and missed both times.    this doesn't mean we won't get the #1 overall this time around. Depending on where we finish, we have the same odds as before.    Embiid was our best chance at a franchise player.    Maybe. Yes he had the highest upside, but we knew the risk taking him. Just because Okafor isn't as good as a prospect as Embiid, doesn't mean he can be a guy we can build around. Just look at the reigning MVP.    I have much less confidence in a healthy Okafor than I do in a healthy Embiid.   Embiid's health was the reason he fell to #3 overall. It was a concern then, and is now. You can't omit that andsay you'd rather have a healthy Embid.  You obviously are not high on Okafor, which is understandable, you don't have to like every player drafted. I would agree with the general consensus that Okafor can become a ery good player that you can build around. If that doesn't work out, you still have a likely top 5 pick coming up. If both of those don't work out (which would only be seen 2-3 years from now), Hinkies gone and we move onto the next era."

sixers,3cxi2m,RedBaron8920,9,Sat Jul 11 18:50:52 2015 UTC,"All I can say is thank god for Okafor and Noel now. This was the risk with Embiid and it looks like his career might go Greg Oden. As harsh as it sounds this is probably worse for him than the Sixers. We wernt going to challenge this year anyway and it would have been great to see him but the positives are he won't be rushed and we are going to still see the start of something special with Noel, Sauce, and Okafor. Get healthy Embiid, IN HINKIE I TRUST."
sixers,3cxi2m,AceHemingway,3,Sat Jul 11 19:06:15 2015 UTC,"I knew this was coming, why does it feel like I got punched in the gut?"
sixers,3cxi2m,LRW35,5,Sat Jul 11 20:18:54 2015 UTC,This sucks so bad
sixers,3cxi2m,NewRedditKid,6,Sat Jul 11 18:36:57 2015 UTC,Seriously its heartbreaking.  Its really not fair.
sixers,3cxi2m,LRW35,5,Sat Jul 11 18:27:16 2015 UTC,"We just havent got our lucky break yet man. Good teams get lucky from time to time, landing a #1 pick in a good draft, landing a franchise player outside the top 5 in the draft, being gifted a franchise guy like Harden to houston. We just havent gotten lucky yet.   I just hope next year we get lucky and get a true franchise player, get good positioning with the Lakers pick, and Embiid is able to put these injuries behind him."
sixers,3cxi2m,NewRedditKid,2,Sat Jul 11 17:39:10 2015 UTC,I feel like Embiid putting his injuries behind him would give you a true franchise player.  I've never felt so strongly that a player I haven't seen play in the NBA yet would dominate.
sixers,3cxi2m,LRW35,3,Sat Jul 11 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. Embiid if healthy is a top 5 player. But I just hope that going forward, we get lucky."
sixers,3cxi2m,NewRedditKid,3,Sat Jul 11 18:25:45 2015 UTC,Me also my friend.  I've sorta became a secondary Philly fan through my love of Embiid.
sixers,3cxi2m,LRW35,2,Sat Jul 11 18:47:36 2015 UTC,"It's a gut punch, man."
sixers,3cxi2m,ext2523,2,Sat Jul 11 19:26:05 2015 UTC,We are not lucky at all
sixers,3cxi2m,ziggy8392,2,Sat Jul 11 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"It was going to be a long season anyway. It was a calculated risk, there's no one drafted after Embiid that had as much upside or has shown it so far."
sixers,3cxi2m,marksills,2,Sat Jul 11 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"I just want to know if he's gonna be able to play at all. The lack of information is really frustrating. Look, I get the desire for secrecy, but for fuck's sake tell us what's going on and stop forcing us to speculate on everything!"
sixers,3cxi2m,jdol06,2,Sat Jul 11 17:48:14 2015 UTC,"They will put something out, they just aren't final or just become final recently"
sixers,3cxi2m,juco818,2,Sat Jul 11 18:00:22 2015 UTC,this season wasn't going to hinge on Embiids health anyway. buck up and #trusttheprocess
sixers,3cxi2m,chukinthebuket,6,Sat Jul 11 18:08:49 2015 UTC,"Ok yeah but this isn't about the season. We were all excited to watch Embiid debut this year and have a glimpse of hope for the future but now it's back to square one. I'm sure in a few days we'll have a better outlook but this is fucking awful news, let us feel sad about it."
sixers,3cxi2m,juco818,4,Sat Jul 11 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"This is a big blow to the team, no question.  Back to square one?  idk about that.  We still have two out of the 3 draft picks we picked up from last year (3 out of 4 if you count Stauskas now) that we can watch develop, whom have the potential to be superstars in the NBA.  We have a shot at another lottery pick next year (maybe two, whether we're horrible again or somewhat decent), and we're not hampered by terrible contracts, so if Hinkie starts feeling the pressure in a year or so, he can go out and pay for someone in FA.  This is a devastating blow to the franchise no doubt, but it's not gonna kill us."
sixers,3cxi2m,chukinthebuket,2,Sat Jul 11 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"Like I said, square one in regards to Embiid. Not square one in regards to the Sixers. I am excited to see Jah play this year and watch the rest of our guys improve as well, but I really like Embiid and this news absolutely sucks and we are allowed to feel sad about it."
sixers,3cxi2m,Iputthescrewintuna,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:42:33 2015 UTC,that sense of villification you're feeling is something you're concocting yourself.  I never said you couldn't feel sad about it.
sixers,3cxi2m,Kingdariush,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah we are being extremely picky with Embiid so I can be patient.  He will not be put out there until he is %100.  It will be unprecedented waiting 2 years through an injury but just look at the fuck ups in NBA history where a player could have used that.  Grant Hill, Yao Ming, etc.    I still have hope in Embiid.  Just not expecting him to be a franchise cornerstone anymore.  If he gets healthy he is just a bonus now.  A big bonus."
sixers,3cxi2m,chukinthebuket,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:37:43 2015 UTC,"this just really makes our rebuild a year later...again. I'm not in the boat where I want a playoff team now, I just don't want to have to wait another year or another year to watch players develop. Maybe in the end it all works out but other teams don't have to deal with what we deal with and it makes me jealous."
sixers,3cxi2m,Kingdariush,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:49:04 2015 UTC,"If Okafor becomes elite or Noel improves his offensive game tremendously, then it's not ""a year later"" at all.  We have so many assets coming up in the next few years.  Whether we're bad or not, we're in position to capitalize."
sixers,3cxi2m,chukinthebuket,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:52:30 2015 UTC,"But for me, i can't think of a prospect at least at this time that is better than Embiid. He's such a great prospect in my eyes and I might be biased but I don't think we'll come close to his level of potential and room to grow"
sixers,3cxi2m,MotM54,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:51:12 2015 UTC,"Shit happens man.  Nothin we could do about it.  Portland survived the situation twice (Sam Bowie and Greg Oden) and came out OK.  Bowie's career never panned out after taking him in the '84 draft, went on to make the finals in '90 and '92.  Not only did they have injury issues with Oden, but also Brandon Roy's career was cut short.  They still managed to overcome and be a perennial playoff team.  It does suck, but we had to kind of expect this could happen in the back of our minds when we drafted him.  It's easier to accept now that we have a player who's actually going to play this season that we get to see develop."
sixers,3cxi2m,juco818,2,Sun Jul 12 05:16:06 2015 UTC,We're not back to square one. We have an up and coming Noel to pair up with Okafor. It'll still be a fun season.
sixers,3cxi2m,jdol06,3,Sun Jul 12 05:27:39 2015 UTC,I meant back to square one with Embiid. But yeah you're right.
sixers,3cxi2m,thisisnotme12244,0,Sun Jul 12 16:25:15 2015 UTC,be my guest
sixers,3cxi2m,Iputthescrewintuna,6,Sat Jul 11 17:54:21 2015 UTC,"I still trust the process, but I just really wanted to see a healthy Embiid. It's kind of how I assume Eagles fans felt when Jason Peters went down with that second Achilles injury."
sixers,3cxi2m,BCSinReverse,6,Sat Jul 11 17:57:54 2015 UTC,I'll take another year if this means that he will have a 10 year career
sixers,3cxi2m,Xo0om,2,Sat Jul 11 21:54:24 2015 UTC,I am very proud of the 76ers and Embiid.  I know Embiid feels like he can play right now probably and 76ers refuse to risk his future.  He is healthy enough to where most teams I am sure would trot him out there this year wanting to sell tickets and get wins.
sixers,3cxi2m,Birdgang14,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:42:43 2015 UTC,"It's not about the season, it's the fact that his career is more likely than anything else to never really take off.  Not a good sign at all."

sixers,3cy2do,VladDracul_III,15,Sat Jul 11 20:31:56 2015 UTC,I think it's fairly self-explanatory at this point.
sixers,3cy2do,kip_chelly,4,Sat Jul 11 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"I was glad before the Embiid news came out. I had Russell 4th on my big board; behind Towns, Okafor, and Mudiay."
sixers,3cy2do,ThaOneNOnly,3,Sat Jul 11 21:02:24 2015 UTC,yes... let just hope okafor turns into boogie with a good work ethic  imo okafor has the potential to be a better passer than boogie (and that saying alot since boogie is very good passer) but his defensive abilities are probably going to be worse due to boogie's slight advantage in standing reach
sixers,3cy2do,danielsilva12345,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:14:37 2015 UTC,Boogie is much much faster than Okafor.
sixers,3cy2do,sharke93,2,Sun Jul 12 00:18:08 2015 UTC,being fast dosen't really matter in the low post
sixers,3cy2do,danielsilva12345,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:43:05 2015 UTC,"Does matter in transition though, and Boogie can push it hard."
sixers,3cy2do,xychosis,6,Sun Jul 12 05:18:17 2015 UTC,If Okafor is better than Russell then I am glad. If not then I'm mad. Too early to tell.
sixers,3cy2do,Trainwrek,2,Sat Jul 11 20:48:49 2015 UTC,Yeah but it's not like we could have gotten Russell.
sixers,3cy2do,Lyndell,2,Sun Jul 12 17:03:17 2015 UTC,Okafor is instant offense. He can create for himself with good efficiency and he can find others when they have the better shot. Okafor is the offensive difference maker while Noel is defensive difference maker. Both x-factors and game changers at either end of the court.
sixers,3cy2do,decriz,2,Sun Jul 12 06:10:50 2015 UTC,"no, i had porzingis and herzonja higher than okafor"
sixers,3cy2do,vayuu,2,Sat Jul 11 21:24:06 2015 UTC,herzonja is going to be good
sixers,3cy2do,Kingdariush,3,Sat Jul 11 21:35:14 2015 UTC,you would have drafted Mario Herzonja over Jahlil Okafor?
sixers,3cy2do,Phogify,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:45:48 2015 UTC,"That seems to be what he is implying, or traded down for Mario."
sixers,3cy2do,lilgodboy,2,Sun Jul 12 02:35:05 2015 UTC,I wish Philly had Porzingis. He's a lot more interesting than Okafor and Nerlens could play center.

sixers,3cxo9k,SteveWynn,21,Sat Jul 11 18:28:56 2015 UTC,Let's just assume Embiid died until Hinkie speaks. Then there's no way we're disappointed.
sixers,3cxo9k,ihorsey,19,Sat Jul 11 18:58:00 2015 UTC,Thank God. He's alive. He just needs foot surgery.  Dodged a bullet there.
sixers,3cxo9k,109876ers,6,Sat Jul 11 19:27:36 2015 UTC,Who says he is getting surgery at all? Pompey hasn't been the most reliable source. Ill wait and see for the news this week.
sixers,3cxo9k,12hphlieger,2,Sat Jul 11 18:34:00 2015 UTC,Bob Cooney confirmed his report. John Gonzalez said he heard last week it was a 99.9% chance of surgery. Barring embiid going rogue he's getting a surgery of some sort
sixers,3cxo9k,dbick,4,Sat Jul 11 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused as to what took them this long to actually decide surgery. I get that they were getting multiple opinions, but this just seems to be an excessive wait. Also, if he is going to get surgery how come he wasn't wearing a protective boot? Or would it not have mattered if he was getting surgery anyways?"
sixers,3cxo9k,arjunbsharma,3,Sat Jul 11 18:47:34 2015 UTC,Two theories   This story by Pompey is a gambit. When he asks for news they blow him off. So he runs this story and they either have to confirm or deny.   They haven't decided what doctor to use.
sixers,3cxo9k,throwaweight7,2,Sat Jul 11 19:08:13 2015 UTC,"As much as I wish it were true, I can't see this report being false. The only silver lining I can possibly glean is the actual amount of time he would be sidelined. Pompey just said that based on how they dealt with his previous injury he will be out for the entire year."
sixers,3cxo9k,arjunbsharma,2,Sat Jul 11 19:18:30 2015 UTC,I don't think the boot mattered. I'm just speculating but he wasn't feeling any pain so maybe it's not that it could get hurt just walking around but if he did anything too hard than he would re-injure it.
sixers,3cxo9k,sharke93,2,Sat Jul 11 18:52:33 2015 UTC,They were getting as many opinions as possible. Good to be thorough when making a big decision like this.
sixers,3cxo9k,marksills,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:55:24 2015 UTC,"multiple opinions, maybe looking into alternate treatments, trying to find the best doctor for the job... I guess to me it seems like a reasonable amount of time.  As far as the boot goes, I'm a nurse (so not a doctor haha) but I know that blood flow is important to continue the healing process and if there isn't an unstable fracture (i.e. the bones aren't cracked and at risk of shifting) a lot of times you'll just forgo the boot because using the muscles and moving around can stimulate the blood flow.  But I don't know.  I'm just desperately speculating at this point :("
sixers,3cxo9k,juco818,3,Sat Jul 11 23:48:38 2015 UTC,The more important point here is that more details will come and we'll have a lot more clarity about the situation.

It was way too soon to give up on Stauskas. That 1st round pick going unprotected after 1 year is great, especially cause Cousins could be outta Sacremento by then. Plus I'm not sure Rondo is gonna be worth it. Not to mention the swap rights as an extra bonus."
sixers,3cuwx4,yopeee,6,Sat Jul 11 01:03:55 2015 UTC,You need to remember that we have an arena building in a year.  We can't afford  rebuild right now.  We needed to dump.  Hinkle saw our weakness and exploited it.  1st round is my only issue.  JT is solid but expensive.  Landry is trash.  Stauskas wasn't right for our system at all.  He has confidence issues and our development staff sucks.  Nik was gonna be trash here.  To soon to speak on Rondo but he is no different than everyone praising mavericks for Williams. We needed to take a risk for more reasons than most know. If we are a .500 team next year...  Cousins is gonna lose it.   We now have the deepest roster in 10 years. I'm OK with it.
sixers,3cuwx4,xychosis,5,Sat Jul 11 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"it's hard to believe that the sixers wouldn't have done this deal for stauskas alone without the draft swaps or unprotected 1st rd pick.  they need the salaries just to get over the minimum.  you almost get the sense that hinkie threw this out there as the initial offer expecting to negotiate further and vlade just said ""sold"""
sixers,3cuwx4,witness_greatness,2,Sat Jul 11 01:40:02 2015 UTC,"Yea I guess he could be described as being between a rock and a hard place, I guess. But man did Hinkie exploit that to the extreme. I hope it works out for you guys, wouldn't want Cousins to fall into the hands of the Lakers."

sixers,3cuwx4,RedHuntingHat,3,Fri Jul 10 23:57:55 2015 UTC,I'll admit that I love the trade both for the present and the future but let's not totally dismiss the Kings fans who say Stauskas struggled because we knew MCW wasn't very good while a lot of people think the Sixers are crazy for tra fingers away the ROY.  With all that said I still have all the faith in the world he could thrive in our youth movement and feel a little at home with Thompson and Landry. Nik rocks!
sixers,3cuwx4,TheAntagonisticDildo,-6,Sat Jul 11 04:39:58 2015 UTC,most lopsided trade in sports history
sixers,3cuwx4,uncreative157,18,Sat Jul 11 00:25:10 2015 UTC,Definitely not.
sixers,3cuwx4,xychosis,-1,Sat Jul 11 00:39:58 2015 UTC,that statement cannot be completely dismissed. In 5-7 years the trade COULD end up being up their as one of the most lopsided in nba history if sauce turns out to be an effective perimeter player and we get great talent via draft swaps with the Kings over the next two years. We could essentially receive 1-3 good to great players for salary relief and two second round picks. Only time will tell.

sixers,3cz8j3,JoelStampiid,-2,Sun Jul 12 03:22:44 2015 UTC,how the hell is he gonna shoot 60% over the course of an 82 game nba season as a rookie on a bad team when he has shot below 50% in every single one of his summer league games?
sixers,3cz8j3,JoelStampiid,-1,Sun Jul 12 04:12:54 2015 UTC,"I think he will shoot a better percentage too but not 15% better. It's obvious he has needed time to adjust to the bigger/better defenders he is playing against right now and he will need to adjust a lot more when he gets to the NBA. I mean, he has had his 1-on-1 opportunities in the post and he just hasn't been that great at finishing, he's getting blocked a lot and turning it over quite a bit. You can't put that on the players around him. He's not ready to average 16.6 on 60% yet. I would think somewhere more along the lines of 14 pts, 8 rbs, 2 asts, 50% shooting."

sixers,3cz8j3,ACPhila,5,Sun Jul 12 04:05:03 2015 UTC,"Totally entitled to your opinion, but out of curiosity I gotta ask why?  He's shown nothing but good form and technique.  Obviously free throws need work but after the work they did with Nerlens I have no reason to doubt that Jah could be a 60%-75% free throw shooter by the end of the year"
sixers,3cz8j3,JoelStampiid,-4,Sun Jul 12 04:10:07 2015 UTC,"For a guy that made himself into a top pick solely from what he does in the post, shooting below 50% every game and having a lot of turnovers isnt good. Lack of athleticism is apparent and it is hurting him; he is getting his shot blocked a lot. Seems to be a good 1-on-1 post defender but every other aspect of the defensive end he is crap. He doesnt move to where he is supposed to be and doesnt really look like he cares. Post game isnt as diverse as I expected from ""the most skilled post prospect since Duncan."" He's above average down there but not living up to the hype for me so far. going to the spin move over and over wont work in the nba.  For me, every negative we have heard over the last few months about him seem to be true, and he hasnt been as good in the areas he was said to excel in. Terrible might be strong, but he has not been good. The only thing he has done that is objectively good is rebound. Al Jefferson comparisons are fair and I think that's around what he will become, but I dont think he will be the superstar that sixers fan seem to think he will be. Based on what I've seen he has a much longer way to go than we thought."

I mean, the Knicks flagrantly tanked in the second-half of last season, but they were one of the worst teams in basketball even before they pulled the plug (sitting Melo, trading Shump/JR, buying out Amar'e). And they still didn't end up with the worst record or a top three selection.   There are a lot of teams with potential to be quite bad if things break negatively: NYK, MIN, POR, PHI, LAL, DAL, ORL, SAC, DEN, BOS."

I mostly mean if the Lakers are regular lousy, it would be tough to justify a flagrant tank if the odds are that they'll lose the pick anyway. You're basically humiliating yourself and alienating a fan base when all it will likely do is give the Sixers a better pick.   Slipping into the bottom ten like Miami did isn't that hard -- but bottom three is rare territory populated by the absolute worst of the worst."

sixers,3cukr1,ACPhila,30,Fri Jul 10 22:11:47 2015 UTC,Okafor at summer league is like having a surgeon work in a butcher shop. He's so obviously ahead of most of the guys there both physically and skillfully that he can't play to their level. I don't even know what that means but I know what that means and it sounds cool.

sixers,3cuoib,Amenz,17,Fri Jul 10 22:43:20 2015 UTC,"to me its good news as long as they dont say, ""Joel Embiid has decided to retire from basketball due to his injuries"". People are freaking out he might need surgery again, but I'll say this a million times. Zydrunas Ilgauskus had the same injury needed 2 surgeries on one foot got the same injury in the other foot had surgery on that, and after all of it, played 5 years in a row where he didnt miss more than 3 games including making 3 all star teams. Embiid is also a lot younger."
sixers,3cuoib,ACPhila,2,Fri Jul 10 22:47:19 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that Embiid's scenario looks a lot worse than Zydrunas's. Zydrunas injured his foot and then was able to play for an entire season after that before the injuries returned. Embiid had an entire year for his stress fracture to heal (a fracture that normally has a 4-6 month recovery time).   In Zydrunas's case, he was actually playing basketball and putting stress on his foot for a year before the injury returned - that is what people worried about with Embiid at the beginning of this year based on his size.  In Embiid's case, its far worse because he had an entire year off with minimal things that should be stressing his foot and its still not healing. Now picture what's going to happen once he starts actually jumping on that foot and putting real stress on it.   The ideal scenario is that Embiid and his trainers incorrectly had him start practicing and working too soon and that's why it didn't heal. I call that the ideal scenario, because if he actually did spend an entire year resting and follow proper protocol, then his lack of healing suggests he may never be able to really play meaningful basketball again. This also isn't the sort of thing where you can say ""oh, we'll just have him get surgery again and he'll be fine in a year if we're patient"". For this type of injury, surgery really isn't that different from just resting and rehab, and the outcomes of patients that undergo surgery is not very different from patients that don't undergo surgery. So, regardless of whether or not he has another surgery, you can still expect him to be out for months and have nagging foot injuries for the rest of his career unlike something drastic changes (far better diet, not exercising incorrectly, etc), I'm not saying that his diet is poor or that he's exercising incorrectly currently, but I'm hoping that's the cause as that's something fixable and its more likely that the actual cause is not fixable (weak bone healing/structure due to factors like his 7'2 size)"

sixers,3cth50,kip_chelly,9,Fri Jul 10 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"They're doing pretty good though. The Celtics own the nets next three draft picks, 2016, 2017, and 2018. The Nets have even traded all of their second round picks away, out to 2020. They literally own 0 draft picks until 2019. Given the lack of talent on that Nets roster and how old some of their players are (and how they've struck out in free agency), the Celtics are looking pretty good right now. Good for them! They also own Minnesota's first next year and the Mav's first next year, a ton of second rounders, and a 2018 first rounder from Memphis. That's a total of 6 extra first round picks in the next 3 years,  plus a bunch of second rounders, totally legit."
sixers,3cth50,Camus145,10,Fri Jul 10 18:50:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but just from history sake I think the Nets will still continue to try to be as good as they can and with them being in the East it's more likely they sniff the playoffs while the Kings are in such a weird spot now there is no telling what's going to happen.  The Kings aren't totally screwed because I think Karl, as much as I hate him, can coach a team to a decent regular season record and he has zero interest in tanking.

sixers,3cth50,Camus145,4,Fri Jul 10 19:04:12 2015 UTC,"The Sapien Rule (from my understanding) is supposed to make that impossible.  (i.e. if a team trades their 1st round pick one year, they aren't allowed to trade the following year's 1st round pick to any other team under any other circumstances).  This is exactly the reasoning why the protections on the Sixers-Kings trade are so odd and predicated on so many factors.  I'm about 99% sure teams aren't allowed to trade consecutive 1st rounders within the rules."
sixers,3cth50,chukinthebuket,4,Fri Jul 10 19:13:40 2015 UTC,You're right. The 2017 pick is actually a pick swap. Still solid.

sixers,3cth50,LRW35,2,Fri Jul 10 18:55:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah 1-10 in 18', completely unprotected in 19'  Edit: here it is more clear http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/3ctj3b/coon_some_details_on_kingssixers_trade_sac_gives/csytoe1"
sixers,3cth50,marksills,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:01:41 2015 UTC,so basically protected for one year no matter what. not sure why they dont report it that way
sixers,3cth50,PHLHomer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:55:53 2015 UTC,"That's what it had been reported as for a week now, but the link that this guy posted above^ says otherwise, so now I'm confused too.  That being said, the tweet from Coon is fairly nondescript, so that redditor may be wrong."
sixers,3cth50,jondonbovi,11,Fri Jul 10 19:30:34 2015 UTC,"How fucked up would it be if Sacramento won the lottery two years in a row in 2016 and 2017 and had to swap those picks to the Sixers. Then they finally get the #10 pick in 2018. The following summer the Sixers sign away Cousins in free agency, and the Kings win the lottery again in 2019 only to give that pick to the Sixers."
sixers,3cth50,Brokoba,2,Fri Jul 10 19:41:52 2015 UTC,Hnnngh
sixers,3cth50,TheTurribleTurtle,3,Fri Jul 10 21:48:09 2015 UTC,Lottery picks forever
sixers,3cth50,vayuu,3,Fri Jul 10 22:41:18 2015 UTC,unprotected.....
sixers,3cth50,rbren658,6,Fri Jul 10 17:28:04 2015 UTC,so what about the pick swap next year.....
sixers,3cth50,CrunchyKorm,8,Fri Jul 10 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"Has to be in the top 10 to avoid Sacramento giving its pick to Chicago, but better than the Sixers pick."
sixers,3cth50,rbren658,17,Fri Jul 10 17:40:15 2015 UTC,so basically we have to cheer on a total rondo/DMC/george karl melt down.... im in
sixers,3cth50,mining_for_more,4,Fri Jul 10 18:13:37 2015 UTC,And it's already started
sixers,3cth50,rbren658,3,Fri Jul 10 18:14:58 2015 UTC,we can only hope they dont fire him and it goes downhill all season lol
sixers,3cth50,sharke93,2,Fri Jul 10 18:31:27 2015 UTC,I think we still get the pick swap.
sixers,3cth50,chukinthebuket,3,Fri Jul 10 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"In order for the '19 pick to be worthwhile, we need a few things to happen:  1)  We need the Kings to suck this year and secure a top 10 pick.  If the Kings finish outside of the top 10, the Bulls get their pick and we get the protected '18 first rounder.  2)  After completing step #1, we then need the Kings to rebound and have a successful year in '16-'17, finishing outside the top 10, thus ensuring that Chicago does get their pick.  (If the CHI pick doesn't convey by '17, then it becomes two 2nds.  This would once again cement the Sixers with the protected '18 1st rounder).  3)  Finally, we need Cousins to leave them in '18 and for them to be atrociously bad in '18-'19, thus completing the cycle of us getting a lottery pick in 2019 while (hopefully) being a contender."
sixers,3cth50,PHLHomer,10,Fri Jul 10 18:09:18 2015 UTC,Or they can just suck for 4 years straight and land 1-10 every year and we still get an unprotected lottery pick from them in 2019
sixers,3cth50,chukinthebuket,3,Fri Jul 10 19:10:52 2015 UTC,Or that.
sixers,3cth50,Malephic,3,Fri Jul 10 19:44:29 2015 UTC,Getting a protected first doesn't really matter at all. It'll just defer to the next year if they suck. That's much simpler than them rollercoasting up and down.
sixers,3cth50,chukinthebuket,4,Fri Jul 10 20:38:28 2015 UTC,But this was so much fun to type out and also works.
sixers,3cth50,ACPhila,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:58:30 2015 UTC,So they gave us an unprotected 1st round pick the year Cousins is a free agent. LOL
sixers,3cx0fk,16Jack,6,Sat Jul 11 14:54:42 2015 UTC,No. Mavs will give up nothing to get him and then we are stuck with him and his cap space. Terrible idea.
sixers,3cx0fk,CrumbThumber,7,Sat Jul 11 15:47:12 2015 UTC,Deron Williams is garbage
sixers,3cx0fk,kip_chelly,5,Sat Jul 11 15:35:27 2015 UTC,Hot garbage even.
sixers,3cx0fk,KoolGMatt,2,Sat Jul 11 15:46:03 2015 UTC,Boiled garbage even.
sixers,3cx0fk,Sir_Capt_Obvious_III,3,Sat Jul 11 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"Given his large contract, injury history, and diminished level of play, I think he'd have negative trade value. Dallas is signing him to a 2/10 contract, whereas if the Sixes picked him up off waivers his contract would be 2/40. But I like the thought process."

sixers,3cx0fk,thisisnotme12244,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:07:27 2015 UTC,"LOL, part of me loves it, but what if we could do a deal with The Mavs in the future? Wouldn't this sour our relationship with them?  We can only piss off so many GM's, lol"
sixers,3cux1j,sixersnba,2,Fri Jul 10 23:50:37 2015 UTC,"This is an awesome trade, in every sense of the word."
sixers,3ctagi,rahbee33,7,Fri Jul 10 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"From those highlights, and how you describe his game, Okafor's performance doesn't look nearly as awful as people make it seem on here"
sixers,3ctagi,xychosis,7,Fri Jul 10 16:38:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know - I've been pretty impressed so far. It's just three Summer League games and he's playing with guys that aren't that good all while being doubled teamed every time he touches it. He hasn't taken a straight jump shot yet, but his face up game is on point. He drives left or right, he's got spins, he's got flips and hooks...  The defense needs a lot of work, but offensively I think he's going to be capable of 15+ PPG this next year pretty easily."
sixers,3ctagi,sharke93,3,Fri Jul 10 16:41:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I honestly think the reason he's not scoring much are the doubles. Pretty much every time he touches the ball in the low post he's doubled and he has to kick it out to players who have repeatedly failed to knock down the open 3. If we can throw out a line up with all 3 point shooters along with Noel or Joel I think he'll be much better off.
sixers,3ctagi,xychosis,4,Fri Jul 10 17:17:01 2015 UTC,"With Cov and Nik sure to draw attention from defenders, once we see Jah in regular-season action, we should see him go to work with better efficiency."
sixers,3ctagi,sharke93,4,Fri Jul 10 17:21:22 2015 UTC,And Hollis and sometimes Canaan
sixers,3ctagi,LRW35,2,Fri Jul 10 17:22:49 2015 UTC,Yeah hes a dominant faceup threat. Even his little pullup is on point. Cant wait to see what Wright does with his body.
sixers,3ctagi,LRW35,2,Fri Jul 10 17:56:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I think we are going to hear a lot about Wright this season.
sixers,3ctagi,DariosDentist,3,Fri Jul 10 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"I agree. Theres a lot of room to improve Okafor too. He isnt limbering, but hes doughy with baby fat and has poor stamina and thats the absolute best case scenario. Oak can probably lose 10 lbs or so, turn some of that baby fat into muscle which will improve his explosiveness, quickness and strength, and work on his stamina."
sixers,3ctagi,DariosDentist,4,Fri Jul 10 18:06:31 2015 UTC,I wonder if he's doesn't make the team if they'll stash jp in Delaware or down under.
sixers,3ctagi,YoungAI,2,Fri Jul 10 18:10:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be opposed to either. I like him, I just don't know if I like him better than say, JaKarr."
sixers,3ctagi,MartinRemo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:13:35 2015 UTC,Who knows what the staff can do with his shot between now & training camp but it's less effective than Nerlens at this point. I love his athletic & dribbling ability though.
sixers,3ctagi,ZeePrime,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:17:46 2015 UTC,Yeah he has some of that KJ flair with a little more of the skills. I love the way he goes up and gets rebounds.

It may have been the result of him growing 2 inches since he originally injured it, and not because of a lack of normal healing/poor bone growth.

And even if he never sees the court, the whole point of The Process™ is that something like this won't derail it. We have a ton of draft picks in the future to build our team.

sixers,3cw1j1,bhikshoe,6,Sat Jul 11 06:46:20 2015 UTC,No but we should definitely sign Sebastian Curry
sixers,3cw1j1,decriz,3,Sat Jul 11 11:42:43 2015 UTC,wouldn't hurt to give him an end of the bench roster spot for the minimum and see what he can deliver.

sixers,3cw1j1,CeleryOnReddit,2,Sat Jul 11 07:47:05 2015 UTC,was thinkin similar after reviewing tyler harvey highlights. someone in orlando sub said harvey was more like seth than steph. so thought if sixers cant snap up harvey maybe try seth. see how stauskas does i guess
sixers,3cw1j1,pumadude321,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:49:05 2015 UTC,Yeah it's just our pgs just haven't been that good this summer league they could really use a shooter. I just watched Seth highlights for today 30 and shot 9/17 2/7 threes and 10/11 free throws but only 4 ast and 4 turnovers :(
sixers,3cw1j1,lilgodboy,2,Sat Jul 11 06:59:15 2015 UTC,Just wait for pappy Jack against the lakers. He will kill it!!'
sixers,3cw1j1,GOATrieIrving,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:39:40 2015 UTC,"We aren't looking for a shooting PG.  TJ has been doing well this summer league.  He's a pass first PG who was brought in to kick the ball to the wing guy or the big guy.  A shooting PG would not be a good fit for us.  We would be wasting the talent we have down low.  TJ would have more assists if we didn't put him in with raw players, like Okafor, McRae, and Furkan (who is getting better).  Put in Noel, RoCo, Stauskas (a little raw, but can shoot well), or even Thompson and his assist total would go up."
sixers,3cw1j1,sharke93,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:52:01 2015 UTC,Yeah that's true I pretty much just asked because of the Utah SL team that had no shooting. Hopefully Pappy Jack does work and we don't worry about another pg
sixers,3cw1j1,busterbluthOT,2,Sat Jul 11 19:00:23 2015 UTC,definitely. then pick up larry jordan

sixers,3cw1j1,WalterWhiteRabbit,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:15:54 2015 UTC,"It's because he can't play defense and has no play making skills. His only skill is shooting, and his release is slow even then."
sixers,3cupqr,eagles420,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:50:30 2015 UTC,Unfortunately a team trading a superstar never gets back what they gave up.
sixers,3cupqr,thisisnotme12244,8,Fri Jul 10 22:53:37 2015 UTC,Not even in the top 10 unless a pick swap turns into James Worthy or something.  Maybe 5th in Sixers history although we were on the losing end of 3 out of those 5.
sixers,3cupqr,MatCauthonsHat,0,Sat Jul 11 00:06:34 2015 UTC,"Well that's what I'm saying. I know it could end up just being a decent trade for us. But it could also be the best. I mean it's potentially 3 top 10 picks, 4 including Stauskas, And also 2 other quality players. Shit it could be 3 #1 overall picks(let me dream)"
sixers,3cupqr,pumadude321,4,Fri Jul 10 23:05:24 2015 UTC,"it's potentially 3 top 10 picks   It's one pick (in either 2018 with top 10 protection or 2019 unprotected), and 2 pick swaps.  That's not 3 picks.  That's 1 pick with the opportunity to make 2 of our own picks better."
sixers,3cupqr,pboly44,0,Fri Jul 10 23:07:45 2015 UTC,It's a good trade for the Sixers because they didn't give anything up.  They need bodies to fill out the roster anyway.  Swapping draft positions won't come into play.  The Kings are more likely than not going to have a better record than the Sixers the next two seasons.  They had 11 more wins in a tougher conference with their best player missing a chunk of games.

sixers,3cupqr,lilgodboy,6,Sat Jul 11 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"We have no idea if this trade is lopsided yet. Nik could be a bust; the pick and swaps might amount to very little; the Kings' freed cap space and subsequently signed free agents might help Sacramento.   It looks like a great trade for Philly, but there are a lot of moving parts whose value won't be determined for years."
sixers,3cupqr,eru88,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:27:50 2015 UTC,"It's a great trade for philly and for me doesn't matter what happens with the picks. We shouldn't be result oriented, not to say Kings did really bad, they got the cap space and sign few players.   But for the sixers it's impossible to be a bad trade, regardless of how Stauskas and the Picks turn out."
sixers,3cupqr,MatCauthonsHat,0,Fri Jul 10 23:57:32 2015 UTC,"The trade is lopsided.  We gave up three 2nd round picks, 2 of them being #47 & #60 in this years draft.  If all we got back was Stauskas, it was a pretty even trade.  Who they sign is irrelevant, as that is not part of the trade."
sixers,3cupqr,lilgodboy,0,Sat Jul 11 14:29:24 2015 UTC,"The cap space counts. It's a finite resource. Just as other teams spend money on free agents, the Sixers spent it on Stauskas and unknown future picks. They used $24M in this deal. That's what Sacramento traded for, and that's what the Sixers gave up."

sixers,3cupqr,ext2523,2,Fri Jul 10 23:45:01 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty lopsided trade.   I know a lot of people are saying it depends, but how it pans out does not matter.  The trade value should be evaluated at the time of the trade and includes all the scenarios of how the picks and players could turn out.  It's like going all-in with pocket Aces and getting called with 10-8 off suit."
sixers,3cupqr,lilgodboy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:56:04 2015 UTC,"This is completely untrue. While Sacramento is absorbing so much risk that was can say it was a foolish trade, it won't be lopsided until we know how the picks work out. If Philly gave up $24M in cap space for a disappointing Stauskas, two non-swaps and a middling first-rounder, it's not a good trade for the Sixers."
sixers,3cupqr,eru88,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:08:39 2015 UTC,Being result oriented is bad mmkay and we weren't doing anything with that cap space. This is impossible to be a bad trade.
sixers,3cupqr,lilgodboy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:34:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not ""result oriented"" in the least. I think the trade offers fantastic upside for Philly and is extremely dangerous for Sacramento. But it only becomes historically ""lopsided,"" which is specifically what we're talking about here, when we know what happens. That word is about results, not process (or whatever you want to use).   The Sixers could have used $24M in cap space on other ways, including different deals to take on salary in exchange for picks/players. It was a finite resource, not something that they ""weren't doing anything with.""  Again, love the trade from a strategic standpoint and would support doing it again regardless of how the picks end up conveying. It's basically just a semantic discussion here -- to me, ""lopsided"" is best applied retroactively."

Correct me if I'm wrong but the initial press release was news of a setback, right?  Doesn't sound like Embiid is making progress.  :(  One positive, though, is that Embiid has felt great.

To me - this is the most important element in developing a winning franchise.  From Josh Harris to Scott O'Neill to Sam Hinkie to Brett Brown these guys are 100% on board with the same plan and strategy - a focus on player development with a vision towards the long term. I know it's a cliche, but Rome really wasn't built in a day.  Whenever I read or hear interviews with Josh, Scott, Sam or Brett I feel excitement for the future. I don't know how many of you are ""4 for 4 fans"" on this subreddit, but it's especially refreshing for Philadelphia sports."

The only thing preventing Embiid from being fully healthy and a franchise player on the sixers is the fans/organization being impatient for him to heal."

Doctors say they can make it perfect with another surgery and more time off.  The Sixers want him to have the surgery but Embiid want to ball. Fucking Nerlens talks too much and he wants to shut that boy up.  Embiid is inching closer to getting his way."

Would he really put anything up at all if he got bad news.

But who knows the whole thing is cryptic as fuck, and I think Embiid loves that and I love him for that. However, if there was originally a ""finally"" before ""my time is coming"" then that MEANS HE'S PLAYING IN VEGAS.  I don't know how instagram works, but if he edited it, I would pay actual money to see a screen shot of the original with ""finally"" in it."

sixers,3csljq,GOATrieIrving,14,Fri Jul 10 13:04:12 2015 UTC,"If he can hit a 3 with some consistency, he has a place in the nba and a legitimate claim for a roster spot long term"
sixers,3csljq,10_9_8_76ers,3,Fri Jul 10 13:08:06 2015 UTC,agreed... you saw how valuable tristan thompson was for Cleveland on the boards and he has pretty limited offensive abilities... dont get me wrong he is light years ahead of furkan but i can see him developing into something similar coming off the bench... mabe even with a 3 point shot.
sixers,3csljq,rbren658,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:19:43 2015 UTC,"we need a lebron level player to create buckets in spite of furkan's offensive / spacing issues before his rebounding becomes a net positive.   In other words, he's gotta be respectable from 3."
sixers,3csljq,vayuu,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"We have no real evidence, other than an awful Philly.com article about Aldemir going 3 for 6 in summer league from 3PT, that suggests he can be a 3PT shooter.  He was 0 for 5 last season (Small Sample Size), and only 13 for 27 from the free throw line."

sixers,3csljq,ZeroCool79,3,Fri Jul 10 13:06:47 2015 UTC,"Very, very good rebounder, but he's not doing anything we haven't already seen from him. I don't think he deserves a spot on the roster unless he can develop his offense some more."
sixers,3csljq,xychosis,7,Fri Jul 10 13:11:38 2015 UTC,"He has a fully guaranteed deal this year, I don't think he's getting cut.   He's also playing much better defense when he's the loan rim protector as far as I can see, actually using verticality and rotating on drivers. I don't think that 3 point shot is too real, but at least he is shooting."
sixers,3csljq,zigzagzil,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:21:55 2015 UTC,"He's also playing much better defense when he's the loan rim protector as far as I can see, actually using verticality and rotating on drivers.   This was much better last night than it was in the previous two games for sure. But he did finish with 6 fouls the last two games so I think his aggressiveness might be curtailed in the regular season when he has to worry about foul trouble."
sixers,3csljq,rahbee33,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:59:10 2015 UTC,Hitting three 3-pointers in a game is something we haven't seen from Furk before. I don't think he needs a reliable perimeter shot to make the team -- but it would go a long way towards making him more than a specialist.
sixers,3csljq,lilgodboy,2,Fri Jul 10 15:02:55 2015 UTC,"The more 3's he shoots, the further away he is from the basket - greatly reducing his chances of a rebound. If that's the one thing we keep him for, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to give him the green light from deep.   We'll keep him for awhile to have a healthy rotation of big men, but he really can't score unless the ball falls into his hands for a putback or he heaves a lucky 3. He's no Ryan Anderson or Ilyasova. Unless he develops any sort of post game, the dude will be riding the bench in 2-3 years when we have more talent, or he'll be waived"
sixers,3csljq,PHLHomer,2,Fri Jul 10 14:07:45 2015 UTC,"You guys still not a fan of him?   He seems to be well-liked around here. There was a hype thread, like, 2 days ago."
sixers,3csljq,FleetwoodMatt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:36:55 2015 UTC,He can rebound but he seems to blow the offense up a lot and he just slows down okafor.
sixers,3csljq,sportsflush,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:51:44 2015 UTC,"He had zero 3 pointers in like 40+ games last year, so I'm not going to get my hopes up for him ever being a 3 point threat.  But yes, rebounds."

sixers,3csljq,marksills,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:05:40 2015 UTC,I just feel like unless we cut at least one of Thompson/Landry he may be the odd man out. We can't have 7 big men on the active roster.   Nerlens Jahlil Joel Richaun Furkan J Thompson Landry

sixers,3cvaqa,ChickenLiverNuts,2,Sat Jul 11 01:54:02 2015 UTC,I love Noel too. Obviously this is based on potential/ceiling and college career 1 Embiid 2 Okafor then Noel. I get we can keep all three it would be nice to get a strong guard that can get to the basket and distribute
sixers,3cvaqa,ChickenLiverNuts,5,Sat Jul 11 02:19:20 2015 UTC,Unless Hinkie has got inside info that makes him supremely confident in Embiid then im not shipping out Noel for a guard that can't shoot and another pick.  That would appear to be a risk for the sake of taking risks

sixers,3cqt8j,ChickenLiverNuts,2,Fri Jul 10 01:18:44 2015 UTC,I feel like Jahlil palms the ball every time he gets it just to prove he can.
sixers,3cqt8j,aumenous,2,Fri Jul 10 01:19:53 2015 UTC,All of a sudden when Okafor gets the ball in a decent position he does that haha
sixers,3cqt8j,pumadude321,2,Fri Jul 10 01:22:03 2015 UTC,I love that Okafor is showing he can score without being under the basket

sixers,3cra62,throwaweight7,2,Fri Jul 10 12:13:33 2015 UTC,How about Jameer Nelson?
sixers,3cra62,MatCauthonsHat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:04:57 2015 UTC,"No.  We're looking for young stars.  He's neither young, nor a star.  No reason."
sixers,3cra62,MatCauthonsHat,5,Fri Jul 10 14:07:41 2015 UTC,Sometimes you need to surround young guys with talented facilitators to help them grow. Fact is that noel looked 100x better on offense after we got a competent pg running the show.. that says alot to me
sixers,3cra62,monkeylazerfighter,-1,Fri Jul 10 14:09:06 2015 UTC,But why waste a roster spot on a soon to be 34 year old who has no future with the team?  We aren't looking for any players to help us win games this year.  We are looking for our future.  Jameer Nelson is the past.
sixers,3cra62,MatCauthonsHat,5,Fri Jul 10 14:14:21 2015 UTC,For our big guys to develop offensively they need someone who can get them the ball. I dont think wroten or canaan can do it and that may stunt their development. I think we saw that last year when mcw wasnt getting noel good looks
sixers,3cra62,PHLHomer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:19:59 2015 UTC,"If you look at the 2011-2012 Thunder, their team was filled with all young guys and they made it year after year higher in the playoffs with a young talented core of Ibaka Aldrich Durant Harden Sefolosha and Westbrook. It's good to have veteran leadership but ideally you want it from someone who has made it very far in the playoffs, and there aren't many around now"
sixers,3cra62,PHLHomer,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"For our big guys to develop offensively they need someone who can get them the ball. I dont think wroten or canaan can do it and that may stunt their development.    This is one of those things that sounds good on the radio, but is really a whole bunch of nonsense.  Coaches develop the players.  Not the PG.    Noel's development may not have been apparent on the floor last year with MCW at point, but he was still being developed.  The only thing that changed with Ish Smith running the point is it became much more apparent and visible how much he had developed.  Also, the Sixers completely changed their offense after they dealt MCW.  The Sixers are not looking for a veteran presence.  They aren't.  If Thompson and Landry aren't enough veteran presence, they will bring back Luc M'bah a Moute or Jason Richardson.  Also, if they are going to sign a FA PG, why wouldn't it be the one who worked so well with Noel last year.  Then again, why the hell would Jameer Nelson sign with this team?  Pity?  Charity?  Wants to finish his career in Philly?    I don't see the point in bringing up 30+ FA PGs.  Those players want to go to a team that has a chance to win a playoff game in the next year or two."
sixers,3cra62,MatCauthonsHat,4,Fri Jul 10 17:25:53 2015 UTC,"Clearly you haven't played basketball then. The people you play with have just as much influence on your development as coaches do.  Also, why do you count out the possibility of signing Ish and working to get a veteran PG? You seem to be closed-minded about what the sixers will do, and really holding your opinions to be fact."
sixers,3cra62,PHLHomer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"These guys can practice all they want but i think actually doing it in-game is still very very important. I agree that bringing back ish is a smart move, if not him then another pg that knows what hes doing"
sixers,3cra62,PHLHomer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:32:18 2015 UTC,"Luc Mbah a Moute was extremely valuable for our team last year. It's not like he won us 5 more games than we would have, but veterans like that are certainly useful for stability and to help the flow of an offense. Not sure how you can just write off the notion of having one player over the age of 24...  Edit: I guess Jason Thompson and Carl Landry are vets. But would conflict with the development of our big guys so..."
sixers,3cra62,PHLHomer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:23:10 2015 UTC,Luc Mbah a Moute was extremely valuable for our team last year.    Luc came in a trade.  Just like Thompson and Landry and Jason Richardson.    Ish Smith is the oldest player Hinkie has signed.
sixers,3cra62,throwaweight7,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:29:28 2015 UTC,"But why waste a roster spot on a soon to be 34 year old who has no future with the team?   If your point is that Hinkie will try to trade for an older player to try and receive a package deal that includes future picks or whatever, instead of simply signing someone... sure. I don't think that's what I was responding to though.  I was responding to your notion that it would be pointless to waste a roster spot on someone who has no future on our team. Did you think Thomas Robinson really had a future on our team? Henry Sims? Glenn Robinson III?   Just because someone like Jameer Nelson is 34 and doesn't have a ""future with our team"" doesn't mean that there wouldn't be mutual interest. Does the guy want to play for someone in the NBA? Would we like a PG that can bring stability to our roster and facilitate for our young big guys? I'm just confused about how you believe a signing like this couldn't help our team"
sixers,3cra62,RIPSweetPrince,0,Fri Jul 10 17:51:58 2015 UTC,"Was luc useful? He sucked on the floor, we're not bringing him back"
sixers,3cra62,lilgodboy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:29:01 2015 UTC,"He started 61 games for us and averaged close to 30 min/game, so I would say yes, he was more useful than a majority of the players that were on our roster throughout last year.   10 ppg, 4.9 REB, .395 fg%  Clearly he wasn't lighting it up, and as we gain more talent, there will be less and less room to keep these type of guys on our roster. But to say he wasn't useful or to say ""older"" players aren't useful for our team is pretty illogical"
sixers,3cra62,mek284,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:40:50 2015 UTC,I agree some older players can be useful but i dont like bringing old guys in for the sake of bringing old guys in. The idea of keeping ish or bringing in a veteran pg is terrific to me because we need the big men to develop offensively. Otherwise I happen to be a luc hater and am happy hes not returning
sixers,3cra62,lilgodboy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:45:28 2015 UTC,"I think we're on the same page lol. I'm not saying Luc is the answer at all, I think Jameer Nelson on a 1-year contract could be a really good thing for us"

sixers,3cpam2,Hirshologist,14,Thu Jul 9 22:07:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure i'm seeing the same stuff that you are. Most of the sentiments that i've read are that Noel can play w/ Embiid or Okafor, and that the actual problem is that Embiid and Okafor can't play together (meaning it's more likely we ship one of them)."
sixers,3cpam2,sokrazyitmightwork,8,Thu Jul 9 18:45:35 2015 UTC,It's the other way around.  Nerlens isn't a good fit (offensively) with another big.  Embiid and Okafor is more of a possibility.
sixers,3cpam2,catpigeons,7,Thu Jul 9 19:44:53 2015 UTC,"huh, well both comments have upvotes and now I'm more confused about it than I was before. Based on the transitive property using these two posts, I'd say they all can play together at the same damn time."
sixers,3cpam2,Hirshologist,2,Thu Jul 9 20:46:46 2015 UTC,"the Embiid Noel combo is the one that makes the most sense - Embiid can step out and face up while both could be elite rim protectors, and noel can guard quicker 4s on the perimeter"
sixers,3cpam2,rahbee33,2,Thu Jul 9 23:19:04 2015 UTC,"Embiid-Noel is good fit defensively, but not at all offensively.  Whoever plays alongside Noel is going to have to deal with lots and lots of doubleteams."
sixers,3cpam2,Xo0om,12,Fri Jul 10 01:55:07 2015 UTC,I agree that everybody is too quick to ship Nerlens out. The numbers he put up last year as a rookie don't come along very often (evidenced by all the weird Hakeem and David Robinson stat lines he replicated this year). He is already elite at one end of the floor.   I think everybody from the outside might have a slightly different plan than what is going on in the front office.  If we did move Noel I think it would have to be after we see Embiid play and even then I don't know if you let him slip through your fingers.  TeamNerlens
sixers,3cpam2,MatCauthonsHat,6,Thu Jul 9 18:09:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think there are all that many people shipping Nerlens out just yet, but there is a subset here that is always wanting to make another deal, get another draft pick, anything.    Me I want to see how Nerlens and Okafor look long before we do any such thing.  IMO Embiid can't be moved now since it would a low sell."
sixers,3cpam2,Hirshologist,2,Thu Jul 9 18:14:30 2015 UTC,Everyone in this sub
sixers,3cpam2,GaiusMagnus,5,Thu Jul 9 21:27:01 2015 UTC,"The people asking questions about how the three of them can fit together are overreacting.  The people saying we have to trade one of them are overreacting.  And you are overreacting.   Relax.  Training camp hasn't even started yet, let alone the season."
sixers,3cpam2,Hirshologist,5,Thu Jul 9 19:18:15 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm probably one of those people who's been saying we will probably ship Nerlens out, but it's not because I don't like him or anything.  I like him a lot!  But the problem comes down how he fits in this roster long term when we have two other centers.  Assuming these players develop the way they're supposed to and stay healthy, here's a list of reasons why Nerlens is probably the odd man out.     He's not a good offensive fit with either Okafor or Embiid.  Since his offensive game leaves a lot to be desired, teams will routinely double the other guy when Nerlens in on the floor.   While Embiid might be able to make it work a little since he has a jump shot in his game, with Okafor, offensively it's a disaster fit.   His offensive skills are a big problem.  As great as a defensive player he might become, it's much more valuble to the sixers to play Embiid or Okafor at the 5 because generally speaking, offensive skills are more valuble than defensive skills.  A bad defensive center like Okafor can be hidden by a good defensive system; the same can't be said about offense. His contract is up in 2 years and we can't spend the type of money Nerlens deserves on someone who is projected to be a backup for us.     While I like Nerlens personally, it just makes more sense for us as a team to move him for another asset (hopefully a wing) that fits best with us long term.   Normally a player of his skills is very very rare.  It's amazing to think that a player of his skill is surplus to requirements on one of the NBA's worst teams, but he just is.    Having said all that, I don't want to trade him today or anytime soon, prefarebly not till the next offseason.  Player development always throws a few surprises.  Maybe Nerlens develops an offensive game.  Maybe Okafor develops a jump shot and can be a bitter fit with Nerlens.  Also, Nerlens value should only increase by next year anyways."
sixers,3cpam2,kip_chelly,0,Thu Jul 9 20:01:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, Noel will never be a scorer. But can he be a poor-man's Joakim Noah? If so, that's not something I want to give up. And Saric is a scorer."
sixers,3cpam2,lilgodboy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:34:33 2015 UTC,"Nerlens will probably be better than Noah, but the problem is that he has two better players in front of him."

sixers,3cpam2,Camus145,2,Thu Jul 9 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"Noel has so much value although hes not a franchise player. Hes the best rim protector but he is such a great athlete he can guard stretch 4s and even steal the ball from guards off the dribble. On offense hes basically DeAndre Jordan but on defense hes way better and he actually makes more than half his free throws. My guess is if Embiid can prove he'll stay healthy for a full season, Okafor is getting traded, b/c Noell is so versatile and it allows Embiid not to exert energy on defense if youre running the offense thru him."
sixers,3cpam2,chukinthebuket,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:09:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's not so much everyone wants to trade him, but rather we just wanna see Hinkie do his Hinkie thing. Everytime he makes a move it's always incredible, and we get to see it only rarely. With a top player like Noel you can only imagine what Hinkie would get out of it, which is why I think people are okay with trading everyone and anyone.   I just wanna watch Hinkie ""Hink."""
sixers,3cpam2,J4BRONI,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"I think I'm seeing a good bit of this. And maybe people feel another trade is inevitable and don't want to get so attached that they are completely heartbroken if Noel gets moved.

sixers,3cpam2,marksills,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"I dont think I would abandon the sixers, but i will definitely always be a huge fan of Noel whether he is on the sixers or not.   Also, I think most fans here on reddit are just ready to see the future and as valuable as defense is, it just isn't as important as offensive in the Nba. Noel is no doubt on his way to becoming a DPOY candidate and should be an important cog in this organization for years to come imo. However, having a two way player that could also be a top 5 defensive center(embiid) would be more beneficial than just a defensive juggernaut.   All this being said, if we traded one of these guys tomorrow it would have to be Embiid. We have no idea what he is going to be. We havent even seen him on the floor and he could flat out bust for all we know.  I think it's obvious though that Hinkie wont trade any of these guys away until we know what we are getting from them, so I wouldn't worry about it too much."

Arizona won by 15.  But that doesn't really tell the whole story as Russell had McConnell, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Stanley Johnson rotating on him all night and McConnell was mostly guarded by Shannon Scott.

sixers,3cpo2l,MatCauthonsHat,5,Thu Jul 9 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"Flexibility/optionality is sooo important. I think a lot of gms visions are compromised my owners who push them into win now moves that give most teams a ceiling by taking up all their cap.   Hinkie knows that the only guys you commit to early are the ones who are worth more than the maximum amount allowed. We may or may not have them already, and even if we do, them being very young/inexperienced allows us to add more via high draft picks until they develop into allstar level players and their mere presence carries us out of the basement. So adding more experienced guys who will add wins but arent able to be apart of a super core artificially inflates our wins and kills this opportunity.  Im fine with signing unknown and searching for more RoCos and taking on more Stauskas's in the short term. In a year or 2 or 3, a few of our prospects will leap into franchise talents and naturally carry us into the playoffs."
sixers,3cpo2l,LRW35,8,Thu Jul 9 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"I like watching the Sixers, even when they're bad. They have so many young players, it feels like you're constantly discovering new things about them.   Also, sometimes they can be bad in spectacular fashion, which can be entertaining at times. Like Nerlens early last year - he had some highlights, but damn did he have some lowlights as well. Airballing jump hooks, missing layups, etc. Mix awful plays like that with the occasional ultra-athletic block or putback slam, and you have an entertaining emotional rollercoaster."
sixers,3cpo2l,Camus145,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:51:27 2015 UTC,I suspect two of those three won't be on the Sixers this season.
sixers,3cpo2l,lilgodboy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:02:26 2015 UTC,I still want a veteran PG on the team who if nothing else is at least a decent passer so he can help Okafor develop his post game. Doesnt have to be a great player or anything.
sixers,3cpo2l,ACPhila,0,Thu Jul 9 20:31:32 2015 UTC,To be fair last year's not a great comparison. Now that we have another potential superstar prospect (and the pick swaps) I think we're much less devoted to winning fewer than 20 games.   As an example - the attempted Jimmy Butler meeting would never have happened last year. We were trying too hard to lose.  That said I'm not expecting much simply because there's nobody young/high-upside/scheme-fitting/inexpensive enough out there for us to take a shot on. The vets who are out there now are the guys you fill out your team with after your core is in place.

I like this a lot. With all the focus they've put on sports science it makes sense to go and get one of the best guys in the country.

Its shit.  There is no mention of the trade on the Sixers website or Twitter.    For a trade to be official ...    When teams wish to complete a trade they must set up a ""trade call"" with the league office.  If the teams wish to complete the trade over a weekend they must notify the league office on Friday, otherwise the trade call cannot be held until the following Monday.  The trade is not complete until all terms have been agreed to during the trade call.   During the trade call the teams and the league office review:   The exact terms of the trade (players involved, cash, draft picks, etc.). Contract details for each player, including remaining seasons, salary and any trade bonuses. Health information for all players, including any factors that could affect a player's ability to play basketball at any point in his career. Teams must disclose any relevant health information. Insurance information, including any exclusions (see question number 73). Each team's responsibilities and understandings.   Following the trade call each team sends the league office an email with the terms of the transaction, and the league office sends the involved teams instructions for conditions that must be satisfied before the trade becomes official (such as physical exams). When all conditions have been satisfied, the league office sends another email notifying the teams that the trade is complete. Any term or condition that is not specified in the trade call is not enforceable.  Players cannot play, practice or work out with their new teams until the league office notifies the teams that the trade is complete. source:  Larry Coon's outstanding CBA FAQ  With all the trades that happen during the moratorium, it takes the league a little while to catch up and make everything official.

sixers,3cor4s,I_Dumped_Adele,2,Thu Jul 9 17:32:42 2015 UTC,Did you really dump Adele?
sixers,3cor4s,MotM54,5,Thu Jul 9 18:15:26 2015 UTC,"yea, Hinkie seemingly can negotiate pretty well.   Also, just because everyone knows you want to trade someone doesnt mean you cant leverage offers against each other.   If I were to complain about having to trade one, i would say traditionally the teams trading the big piece in the trade usually are the ones getting the short end of the stick (not so much recently however). But at the same time, maybe were not trading the biggest piece so who knows"
sixers,3cor4s,marksills,2,Thu Jul 9 15:49:35 2015 UTC,Exactly. Just like how the whole world knew Minnesota had no choice but to move KLove and they still got a king's ransom from a desperate Cleveland.
sixers,3cor4s,BrentoMussolini,3,Thu Jul 9 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"Trades in the NBA are made when both sides see them as beneficial.  Having three young high upside centers is not a bad problem to have and having all three won't necessarily affect their value if a team needs one. They wouldn't care if we had 15 centers if we have at least one that they like. I don't think teams often take into account how trades will effect the other team in a deal as long as they get what they want.  The same thing goes for Hinkie and other GMs - if he has something they want they are going to try to deal with him. All of that bullshit about him being a pariah among GMs is just more static being thrown his way by the media. Are their some GMs that don't like him? I'm sure, but if there is a deal that is beneficial to them they will make it. Sort of like how teams dealt with Donald Sterling and the Clippers for years despite him being a Grade A asshole.  I'm not worried about it."
sixers,3cor4s,rahbee33,3,Thu Jul 9 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll run you through this scenario, just to give you an idea if all three pan out. This takes place not this year, but the following next year...  There's an NBA conference call where all the GMs decide that they will lowball Hinkie. He has three proven big men and not enough minutes to go around. Meeting adjourned, Hinkie won't get anything more than a second round pick.   Now look around the league at how many teams need a center, than look how many are young and team-controlled on a rookie salary through 2017-2018. Now ask yourself how many of them are available for trade. I'll give you a hint, it's not a very long list.   So now we have all these teams that need centers, preferably young ones with great contracts and a very few amount of them actually available. Do you see where I'm going with this? Teams can realize that we have to make a trade all they want. We have something that a lot of people want. So when team A realizes that all they have to do to beat the ""agreed second round pick"" is offer up a low first, they're going to do it because a low first for Nerlens Noel is a steal for that team. And now everyone else has to beat THAT offer. This continues and continues until Hinkie takes the best offer available because that's how you use teams against one another to drive up the price. Supply and demand."
sixers,3cor4s,theLgndKllr35,3,Thu Jul 9 17:05:20 2015 UTC,"The only time you get low balled is when you back yourself into a corner and may lose him for nothing.  See James Harden.    I don't think Hinkie is that stupid, especially since he was on the winning side of that deal."
sixers,3cor4s,MatCauthonsHat,2,Thu Jul 9 17:05:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure there will be multiple teams looking for good centers on rookie scale salaries. Hinkie is patient and knows what a players value is, I'm not worried."
sixers,3cor4s,mkyle12,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:53:38 2015 UTC,"If multiple teams are lining up to get a player they won't lowball, because they are competing with each other. I'd be surprised if we trade one of the big men and there are not multiple offers"
sixers,3cor4s,sharke93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:07:12 2015 UTC,"It's stupid. If all 3 big men pan out and Hinkie wants to trade one that logic only makes sense if only one team is interested and they can say ""hey you have 3 guys you can't play together, so take this shitty trade, it's really your only option""   In a reality where all 3 live up to their potential Hinkie tells that GM to go fuck himself and has 20+ teams on the other line bidding against each other for a good young athletic big man. And he'll get a good trade in return."
sixers,3cor4s,MrHobo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:16:11 2015 UTC,"If he truly wants to trade one of them it will most likely be to a team that needs a center. If a team needs a center they're also in not a super strong negotiable situation based on need. I look at it like what the Phillies are doing with Hamels (probably the one thing in RAJ's era as GM that I think he has done really well). They're holding onto him because a team looking to strengthen to itself in the postseason NEEDS strong pitching. I can see this with the Astros and Royals as simple examples. We don't need him cause we blow but another team does to be great, and that gives us the greater leverage.  This parallels with the Sixers situation because we don't need 3 centers, but it doesn't mean we don't have to hold onto them. Maybe a team desperate for rim protection such as the Suns if Chandler goes down and Len can't stay healthy will create an offer for Noel that the Sixers can't refuse because they're that desperate. That's a pretty extreme hypothetical situation but crazier things have happened. Overall I think the situation when it comes to trading one of big men will put us in the driver seat more so than who we're dealing with."
sixers,3cor4s,choose_uh_username,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:36:16 2015 UTC,Its not just the media basketball people in general hate this b/c many of them are former players and coaches. I saw El-Hassan (who's a dope) say Hinkie has no idea what hes doing but then couldnt elaborate on what he did wrong. Daryl Morey thinks Hinkie is a genius and that carries more weight to me than any former player or media talking head.

sixers,3cprh0,DariosDentist,4,Thu Jul 9 20:09:11 2015 UTC,"Lets assume that all 4 turn out to be the generational talents.  It's very difficult/impossible to make that sort of financial investment for the two players that end up coming off the bench.  It makes more sense to move 2 of them for equally good backcourt players.    Also, there's a minutes problem here.  Teams and great players want to play around 35 minutes/game.  You're going to have at least 1 player pissed about minutes."
sixers,3cprh0,Hirshologist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:30:17 2015 UTC,"I agree but what if they're not always coming off the bench. What if team B starts some games for a strategical advantage? Or for a health advantage?  Financially it could work for some time depending on how often Hinkie gains future picks moving forward, how stashed players develop, ect  But For the guys that would want to be moved - there isn't a better way to keep their value high. It's better than keeping them hidden on the bench where no one can see what they're worth.  And for the time that it does work it could turn Phildelphia into one of the elite destinations."
sixers,3cprh0,Hirshologist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"Star players don't want to sit on the bench for any reason and if they're sat for ""strategic"" reasons, that only hurts their value.    I kinda see what you're saying but it's not really realistic or practical and you're making a lot of false assumptions."
sixers,3cprh0,Hirshologist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:08:59 2015 UTC,I'm not betting that this will happen but more of an interesting what if - What false assumptions?
sixers,3cprh0,J4BRONI,2,Thu Jul 9 21:29:37 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're assuming players would in any way shape or form like or tolerate this.   There's not a good basketball player in this world that would happy being part of a B team or situational team.   If I had the talent of these players, I would want to play at least 35 minutes per game.  This is important for my financial value.  Players that don't play consistently aren't valued as highly as the ones who do.   Look at Omer Asik for example.  He didn't want to be Dwight's backup and he's not even that good of a player, but getting out of Houston into a starting role in NO netted him 58 million.  Philly wouldn't be an ideal destination in the slightest.  Players don't like joining logjams.  Remember how pissed Dragic was last season when phoenix played 3 PG's?  Even right now, I think it's pretty safe to assume that neither of the guys we have are thrilled about playing together."
sixers,3cprh0,marksills,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:13:32 2015 UTC,"It's not an assumption - it's just that they are all under the Sixers control for enough time to do this plan successfully. Nerlens is an RFA in two years, Joel in three, Jah in four, ect. So it's not assuming they would tolerate it - they would have to tolerate it. And when their first UFA contract was coming up you would have a player whose capable of their ""generational"" ceiling, has probably won, and not as much miles on their body as if they were the workhorse of that position. That's when you choose the two best big men and trade the other two for a rich value.  I'm not suggesting it would be a destination for 4s & 5s but certainly the other positions."

sixers,3coksp,trophymursky,2,Thu Jul 9 18:17:38 2015 UTC,(Win more games + lose draft position + sign free agents = Championship) great formula just ask the Knicks how thats worked out for them the past decade.  This is correct and Mike Colney Jr is a free agent next year and will not be signing with the 76ers. Hmmm if only there was a way to get a cornerstone pg outside of free agency. I agree with you on this which is why I am giving it a couple more months and probably 20 more moves by Hinkie before I get too worried.
sixers,3coksp,mek284,0,Thu Jul 9 15:40:43 2015 UTC,We have swap rights with the Kings. We no longer need to lose to get a good draft pick. The Kings will lose for us.

sixers,3coksp,MatCauthonsHat,5,Thu Jul 9 15:40:07 2015 UTC,"We are still in the looking for a star phase of the rebuild.    Hinkie swung for the fences.  Jimmy Butler cancelled all his meetings with other teams once it became apparent the Bulls were giving him what he wanted.  The fact that The Sixers were one of those meetings says volumes.   Hinkie has previously said he had his FA target, and would be going after him, but if he missed out, he wasn't going to go after the 2nd or 3rd best guy.  Butler was the FA target.  Nothing out there on the market has star potential.  I would assume at this point there won't be any signings other than an undrafted FA or minimum type guy."

sixers,3coksp,zigzagzil,2,Thu Jul 9 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"Really the only spot minutes-wise to give is at PG.   Bigs: Noel, Okafor, Aldemir, Embiid(*), Jason Thompson, Holmes  Wings: Covington, Hollis Thompson, Grant, Sampson, Tokoto (?)  Guards: Stauskas, Wroten, Canaan  Embiid obviously we don't know if he'll play, and Tokoto may get stashed, but at least 5 bigs will play, as well as 4 wings and 3 guards. That's 12 players getting real minutes, and really the only spot to add a big minute player is PG.   I am also assuming Landry is bought out or traded, as I don't think he makes much sense. That could be entirely wrong though."
sixers,3coksp,sharke93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:10:21 2015 UTC,"The way I see it (and this is just my opinion), there are 10 guys that are a lock for our roster this season:  Bigs: Noel, Okafor, Embiid, Jason Thompson  Wings: Covington, Grant, Sampson, Hollis  Guards: Wroten, Stauskas  Then there are 8 fringe players battling for the last 5 spots:  Bigs: Holmes, Aldemir, Landry  Wings/Guards: McConnell, Pierre Jackson, Ish, Canaan, McRae  I think 3 of these fringe players will either be cut or waived.   I think Hinkie has proven before that there will be a surplus of opportunities throughout the season to take in/move around pieces in order to reach the cap floor, so at this point there most likely won't be any free agent signings before the season starts"
sixers,3coksp,PHLHomer,3,Thu Jul 9 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"I know people aren't huge Aldemir fans (and really, neither am I), but he isn't getting cut or waived. He has a fully guaranteed deal for this year and it makes little sense to cut him now.   Holmes to me is a good enough prospect to make the roster, so that wouldn't shock me since he is looking like he can get minute as a stretch-4 type (eventually) next to Okafor.   I also expect Canaan to be on the roster. McRae may also, but I am less of a fan of him, though not sure that he's much worse than JaKarr."

Personally, don't see tremendous value in a ""veteran presence,"" as that was a source of much debate before last season and turned out not to matter much. At this point, anyway, there are a bunch of third-year players on the team (and Wroten is in his fourth season).   Outside of Wroten, who is better than any available veteran, I'd prefer to see what Stauskas, Pierre, Canaan, JaKarr and Thompson can do at the guard slots than dedicate minutes to retreads who don't have a longterm future with the franchise. Ish is okay to bring back, maybe."

He is the real deal, and probably will be the best player in the draft this year and in future years.  He plays like a young Tim Duncan. Amazing offensive and passing skills. Sweet backboard shots. He just needs to concentrate on those free throws and always be motivated to play since he will surely have more losses than wins this year and probably the next year.

It's always going to be rough with the limited amount of practices that these guys get, but overall I'm excited about what we've been able to do so far.   Okafor performed well. McRae has some nice moves if he can shake the Aussie Superstar mentality. Furkan surprised me, dude's just a complete ball magnet. Richuan seems like he'd be a great fit with any of our big men, I'm excited to see how that develops. If TJ can show that he can play D on bigger guards, maybe he makes the squad. Exciting time to see all these guys develop."

I'm a little hazy on these overseas transfers, but he's not Nikola Mirotic; Saric is in his early 20s and was a lottery pick who presumably sees himself as a future NBA mainstay, right?  Wouldn't it make more financial sense for him to get to America ASAP and get paid way more at the back end of a veteran NBA contract(s) later in his career?"
sixers,3cjoqt,letsgogetem,4,Wed Jul 8 15:42:01 2015 UTC,Because his rookie contract wouldn't be huge and he'd have to pay a lot of many by himself for buyout.
sixers,3cjoqt,LoLz14,6,Wed Jul 8 15:58:01 2015 UTC,"Isn't this the 2nd year of a two year contract in Turkey? Regardless, a few hundred thousand in a buyout seems like pocket change compared to the generational wealth that Euro vets like Dragic and Asik are raking in this summer. The sooner he comes, the sooner he gets to paydays on that level."
sixers,3cjoqt,letsgogetem,2,Wed Jul 8 16:20:48 2015 UTC,Those paydays arent a sure thing.
sixers,3cjoqt,DecentHuman,2,Wed Jul 8 18:13:40 2015 UTC,"Sure, but nothing's a sure thing for any young player. I'm just confused by the conventional wisdom, because people keep comparing his financial calculus to that of Mirotic (who's 24 and was a roulette spin on ever making it in the NBA) and I don't see how he's a template for Saric, who's younger and a much higher level of prospect. If there's safer money to be made in Europe, how come every late lottery pick isn't going there for 3 years to wait out the rookie scale?  Ostensibly its because they're aspiring pro athletes who are betting on their ability to make it in the NBA, where over the course of their career they stand to make much more money to compete at the highest level."
sixers,3cjoqt,letsgogetem,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:40:16 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, and I may very well be wrong as it was awhile ago and I may be misremembering, his buyout was a couple millions dollars and the amount an nba team could put up was pretty limited. I could be wrong though."

sixers,3cjoqt,Camus145,3,Wed Jul 8 13:17:42 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll come over next year. He'd be crazy to do so, from a financial standpoint. All he has to do is wait out one more year after this one (and get paid a reasonable chunk of money from a European team on a 1-year deal) and he'd be off the rookie scale. That's huge, that's the difference between a 4-year $5 million dollar contract (or so) and a 4-year $30 million dollar contract. I say there is no way here is here next year either, unfortunately, his agent would flip."
sixers,3cjoqt,noeltojoel,2,Wed Jul 8 19:28:57 2015 UTC,"He already stated in an interview that he will come over after 2 years ""for sure, 100%"", and that hes not really looking at a financial standpoint, and just trying to improve his game, live his dream of being in the NBA, and letting his game earn him more money down the road in the future. Im prettysure it was his pre draft interview, its on youtube."
sixers,3cjoqt,bigdogneversleeps,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"I did the math, it is just north of 10M for the 4 years.  Second, what if he gets hurt overseas badly? That is alot of guaranteed money he could lose  Third, 3 years of NBA experience vs 4 years could prove valuable when it comes to his second deal. And if he tries for the 4 year approach on his first deal, he is giving up the millions he could have been making had he not done the 1+4 and just went for 4 next year.  I'm pretty sure the US would offer far better endorsement deals then where he is now  Finally, he may want to be on this Sixers team. If he waits to come over, he would find himself more vulnerable to be on the trading block and going a team that maybe he doesn't want to go to.  And he wants to build a connection with his team so they can win a title, the goal of any reasonable player.  It is not so logically insane for him to come over, and the intangible benefits make it seem down right sane, if not what YOU would do. But then again, we are on /r/sixers and he is working in the gym to improve his jump shot"
sixers,3cjoqt,Camus145,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:11:23 2015 UTC,"But still. Demarre Carol just signed a 4-year $60 million dollar deal with Toronto, and he isn't very good. Players don't get the big bucks until they get off that rookie scale. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if he comes over next year, wouldn't he have to sign a 4 year contract on a rookie scale? That would delay his cashing out with a non-rookie contract by an additional 3 years."

The latest that can happen is 2019.  If it happens in 2018, the pick is top 10 protected in 2018, and is unprotected the year after.

sixers,3cmzq6,Feelfreetoupvote,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:27:34 2015 UTC,A similar situation is next years Knicks pick. Denver has the right to swap so they get the more favorable and Toronto gets the less favorable of Denver and Knicks pick. So if the sixers pick is less favorable than the Kings I think the Kings send the sixers pick to the Bulls. That said maybe the timing of the deal for the initial trade and swap determines who gets priority
sixers,3cmzq6,goodatbeinggood,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:20:37 2015 UTC,No i dont think you can devalue a pick you owe another team. If the kings pick is 11-30 the Bulls just get it. Otherwise I'd be trading for pick swaps after trading away the rights to that pick everytime.

sixers,3cmzq6,thethinkingsixer,2,Thu Jul 9 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"We can trade the rights to the better pick between our pick and Sacramento. We cannot trade the right to swap picks.  I.e., if we trade with Milwaukee, Milwaukee would get the better of our pick or Sacramento's pick, Milwaukee wouldn't get the choice between Milwaukee's pick and Sacramento's pick."
sixers,3cmzq6,DerekBodner,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:34:58 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that the pick is top-10 protected up until 2019.  It becomes unprotected in the year 2020.  Since you can't trade two consecutive first round picks away, we have to wait 2 years after the Kings convey the pick to the Bulls.    So, in your scenario, we'd have a top-10 protected Kings pick in 2019.  We'd get it if Kings finish 11-30.  If the Kings however finished in the bottom 10 that year, they'd keep the pick and we'd get their unprotected 2020 pick.  Make sense?"

sixers,3ckq7g,BCSinReverse,31,Wed Jul 8 17:49:53 2015 UTC,"how about a non conspiracy theory.   The Sixers weren't lying and embiid's foot wasn't healing the way his doctor expected. Since no one on the staff is a foot expert they don't know if surgery, healing, or starting to play is the best option for a long career for embiid. The sixers brass felt comfortable taking the next step only after getting a consensus opinion from a host of trusted doctors. They're still doing this and hence we haven't gotten an answer yet.  in the end i'm just saying what they had stated in the beginning, but their brass seems pretty straight forward when they bring information.   from this, the only reason i see them taking so long is that different doctors are saying different things. If he 100% needed surgery he would have had it yesterday, if he was 100% good to go he would be in the summer league."

sixers,3ckq7g,Zeno84,5,Wed Jul 8 17:53:48 2015 UTC,Just a gut feeling I think he's playing. I agree with all of you that's they were being overly cautious just for the teams benefit. Whether that was to increase the value of Noel or Okafor or trying to justify the Okafor pick. (Which I think this is less likely cause junkie would of took the best player if he had deandre Jordan and Dwight Howard).  He looks like he's in good condition and embeast will be ready.   I hope

sixers,3ckq7g,Fasyed21,4,Thu Jul 9 01:53:17 2015 UTC,"Hard to know. They could still be getting second or third or fourth opinions before figuring out a course of action.   There's no urgency to make an announcement unless it's bad news and he requires surgery. Saying ""YAY HE'S ALL GOOD"" would be premature unless it's 100% certain that he's going to be fine for training camp. I'm sure they've learned lessons from the Bynum situation in which there were constant estimations of his return that never panned out, which inevitably added to public disappointment and feelings of resentment towards the injured player."
sixers,3ckq7g,lilgodboy,7,Wed Jul 8 18:55:17 2015 UTC,before everyone freaks out if Embiid needs surgery again. Ilgauskus had 2 surgeries and then his recovery improved drastically. He had a very good long career after it including 3 all star appearances in the following 5 seasons w/o missing more than 3 games a year.
sixers,3ckq7g,ACPhila,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Yeah it could be a Yao Ming/Bill Walton situation, but it could just as easily be nothing at all or an Ilgauskas situation. We just don't know yet."

sixers,3ckq7g,Baked_Bt,5,Thu Jul 9 15:45:08 2015 UTC,My conspiracy theory is that they released that right before the draft because they thought Okafor might drop to them. This ultimately softened the blow back and raised the potential trade value of Okafor at the time because they would be less inclined to trade him.
sixers,3ckq7g,Sir_Capt_Obvious_III,4,Wed Jul 8 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I do think it's true that he hasn't healed as much as they like, but until they officially update, I will continue to think that it will not be a long term issue and, like you said, they were trying to raise Okafor's trade value in the event he didn't go 2."
sixers,3ckq7g,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:59:43 2015 UTC,"If that was true they would have traded okafor on draft night, his value will never be higher than it was that night while on the sixers. There just isn't enough minutes in the sixers frontcourt in the coming future unless that is, embiid is done for, so reason here just contradicts itself."
sixers,3ckq7g,GopherFawkes,9,Wed Jul 8 18:31:02 2015 UTC,Well just because they tried to increase his value doesn't mean they got an offer that matched that value.  Maybe the Embiid news didn't actually change his value and the sixers didn't get a good enough offer. That wouldn't change the fact that that's what they were trying to do (if that's what they were trying to do).
sixers,3ckq7g,sokrazyitmightwork,5,Wed Jul 8 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"So you are going to decrease one person's value to increase another, and you think the player who decreased and his agent is going to allow it? Come on man, let's not get delusional, embiid and his agent would have come out firing denying the reports if not true, its his agents job to keep his clients value as high as possible."
sixers,3ckq7g,GopherFawkes,5,Wed Jul 8 18:40:18 2015 UTC,"Embiid's value is 100% irrelevant there is absolutely no chance of him being traded right now. They could never get back what they gave up for him, so there is literally nothing to gain by trading him now before you ever see him play. Embiid will only have value once he plays, and it's not like the press release affected his recovery process or chances of playing...that's kinda just based on his foot.  I'm not saying they lied - just that they released what little info they had so as to create a cloud of doubt to increase Okafor's value in the event he falls to 3. Since they used almost all 5 of their alloted minutes on the clock, I don't think it's unreasonable to assume they were on the phone. And since they didn't trade him, they obviously weren't offered the value they were looking for."

That's the most reasonable explanation given.  If he needs a second surgery, so be it.  We have another big man to try to build around, and if that doesn't work, Embiid will (hopefully) be ready to go next season."

The stats that stood out to me specifically were his FG & 3PT shooting %s   (Small Sample Size Alert)  Pre All-Star break: 50 games, 13.6 Mins/Gm, 33%/26%/86%  Post All-star break: 23 games, 19.4 Mins/Gm, 42%/42%/86%  Hopefully, he can keep up whatever improvements he made post all-star break, and maintain that 40%+ 3PT shooting."

Haha aside from that I'm surprised how good his numbers are post all-star (which I think is most relevant to us.) Considering how poorly his rookie year is spoken of, ~12 points per 36 on 42% 3 pt shooting isn't too shabby."
sixers,3cklt1,lilgodboy,3,Wed Jul 8 20:02:16 2015 UTC,"His true shooting percentage in the second half was better than any Sixer (over the course of the season), narrowly edging out Covington. He wasn't particularly good at getting to the basket or to the line, but he was lighting it up enough from three, and at a high enough volume, to be above league-average in efficiency.   Along with Covington and Hollis, Stauskas should allow the Sixers to trot out a ton of lineups with multiple legit perimeter threats. If Jerami, JaKarr and even Furk can be quasi-reliable from deep, spacing could be less of a problem than anticipated. For all of Wroten's well-documented shooting woes, he shot nearly 29% on spot-up threes. That's nowhere close to good, but a modest uptick after spending a lot of time in the gym seems possible."

Even if they finish with the second or third worst record in the entire freaking NBA, the odds are around 50% that it falls out of the top three. Sixers fans should want the Lakers to freaking suck.  Over the last 5 years, the Pacers have had the 9th, 1st, 1st, and 7th-ranked defenses.

I'm a little young to remember them but when we met in the finals in '01 I remember all the old timers rehashing the L.A. hate.  The '01 series did renew it a bit.  It kind of felt like a Rocky movie where the Lakers were the juiced up Dolph Lundgren (swept all of the series on the way to the finals) and the Sixers were a punch drunk Stallone (went 4, 7,7 back when the first round was best of 5).  There was a real David vs Goliath vibe, which was not helped at all when our formerly native son K. Bean Bryant said he wanted to rip our hearts out (paraphrasing).  Mostly though it is just our pathological need to feel like underdogs.  Personally I suspect it has something to do with growing up your entire life in a city that is truly amazing and constantly feeling overshadowed by NY/DC.  Tl:Dr It's a Philly thing.

sixers,3chgbt,bieberhole696,8,Wed Jul 8 09:02:41 2015 UTC,"Good point made by the Jazz commentators during the game... Does this mean he played yesterday without a contract? Hypothetically, what would have happened if he had a bad injury?"
sixers,3chgbt,ImJustAMan,12,Wed Jul 8 10:53:56 2015 UTC,There's a wage scale and a clause where they have to negotiate in good faith. Similar in the NFL with Dante Fowler
sixers,3chgbt,skulman7,6,Tue Jul 7 23:21:50 2015 UTC,Correct. This is a basic contract signed before any workouts are to begin.
sixers,3chgbt,Robot-Banana,2,Tue Jul 7 23:36:07 2015 UTC,"I assumed he already signed, but either way, this is great."
sixers,3chgbt,Gillezeau,2,Tue Jul 7 23:37:22 2015 UTC,Professor Oak schooling fools out there
sixers,3chgbt,nooge76,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:38:39 2015 UTC,A 2 year deal? That seems extremely short for a rookie contract. Am I wrong here? It feels like a really short contract.
sixers,3chgbt,popmurtha,11,Wed Jul 8 02:47:52 2015 UTC,That is every 1st round rookie contact.
sixers,3chgbt,CrumbThumber,2,Wed Jul 8 00:19:53 2015 UTC,"Every first round pick gets two years with a two-year team option. Or it could be two one-year team options. Not sure on that though. Regardless, it's basically a four year contract. Unless you're Anthony Bennett."
sixers,3chgbt,FuckingHippies,0,Wed Jul 8 01:35:36 2015 UTC,"it doesn't say that now. It may have when you saw it, maybe a typo?"
sixers,3chgbt,harry_kalas,3,Wed Jul 8 02:41:45 2015 UTC,"This is what I read:   The Sixers on Tuesday signed the No. 3 overall pick. It's a two-year deal with team options for a third and fourth year, a source told CSNPhilly.com's John Finger.   Source"
sixers,3chgbt,popmurtha,9,Wed Jul 8 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"That's how every first rounder's deal is structured. You can't alter it, except for going up to 120%(?) of the rookie scale amount."
sixers,3chgbt,Happy_ScrappyHeroPup,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:37:34 2015 UTC,Or down to 80% which never happens
sixers,3chgbt,MongolianDynamite,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:49:24 2015 UTC,Oh I see. Looks like that's the standard based on Noel and Joel's deals
sixers,3chgbt,harry_kalas,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:23:39 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why the Sixers signed him so early -- they didn't do that with MCW, Nerlens or Embiid (although the last two weren't playing anyway)."
sixers,3chgbt,lilgodboy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:28:40 2015 UTC,Probably because he is playing in summer league.
sixers,3chgbt,seanchazin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:02:27 2015 UTC,MCW signed in September
sixers,3chmsz,Jdf5097,18,Tue Jul 7 23:51:45 2015 UTC,Meet #22 Richaun Holmes. The 37th pick who apparently went undrafted..
sixers,3chmsz,Kittonberry,10,Tue Jul 7 23:55:17 2015 UTC,Aldemir knocked down two!  Edit: Make that three!
sixers,3chmsz,ThaOneNOnly,8,Wed Jul 8 00:34:27 2015 UTC,Yeah they're terrible...although at least they're not assholes like the Orlando ones last year.
sixers,3chmsz,cobbicus333,4,Wed Jul 8 00:11:02 2015 UTC,"For real, this must be a developmental league for the announcers as well."
sixers,3chmsz,valkore1,3,Wed Jul 8 02:31:59 2015 UTC,"My favorite was when they were announcing the starting lineups vs the Spurs. Our SF was ""Jerimiah"" Grant."
sixers,3chmsz,ACPhila,2,Wed Jul 8 05:14:17 2015 UTC,apparently the celtics rookies are worse than both
sixers,3chmsz,sherekahn5,2,Wed Jul 8 01:04:10 2015 UTC,holmes was the man today  ..him being traded this year confirmed
sixers,3chsgx,Tac1Son,23,Wed Jul 8 00:36:55 2015 UTC,"Aldemir might end up being nothing, but people have been tremendously hard on him thus far. He joined the team midseason, struggled with conditioning, language and the speed of the game, and was overmatched at center.  The thing is, he was advertised as a fantastic rebounder and he's already proven that it translates to the NBA. He was elite in terms of offensive rebounding rate and very good overall on the boards. In the second half, he showed the ability to take care of the ball in extremely low usage and passed pretty well. His rim protection, by opponent FG%, was 45%, which is fantastic (small sample size and all the usual qualifiers apply, of course). Now, as it appeared was the goal very late last season, Furkan is trying to add a three-point shot. If that's legit enough to keep defenders honest, he can stay on the floor alongside another post player.   Again, I'm not saying the guy is going to be a longterm contributor. But there are more reasons to be optimistic than people seem to believe."
sixers,3chsgx,lilgodboy,12,Wed Jul 8 03:53:38 2015 UTC,You said everything I wanted to say just in a really better way.
sixers,3chsgx,DariosDentist,5,Wed Jul 8 04:27:07 2015 UTC,"I don't see a reason to be overly negative about young guys like Wroten, Furk, Grant and Canaan. It's totally fair to be critical of a player's shortcomings, but simply saying ""he sucks, get him out of here"" is shortsighted while the current goal remains development, not contributing to a playoff team. Most of these guys won't pan out (like Ware, Davies, Varnado, Elliot Williams, etc), but it's fun seeing if they improve."
sixers,3chsgx,lilgodboy,3,Wed Jul 8 05:03:31 2015 UTC,People want him gone? For me and most people it's just fun to make fun of him because how clumsy he looks and how his offense was hilariously bad last year. I definitely want him to stay for a while though
sixers,3chsgx,DanaCarvey,13,Wed Jul 8 13:43:33 2015 UTC,"I just bought his home, away, and alt jersey"
sixers,3chsgx,FleetwoodMatt,4,Wed Jul 8 01:08:24 2015 UTC,And Retro?
sixers,3chsgx,MongolianDynamite,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:24:05 2015 UTC,You're FURKAN crazy. And I love it
sixers,3chsgx,DumpsterFlowers,9,Wed Jul 8 23:49:38 2015 UTC,And set screens like it's nobody's business
sixers,3chsgx,brodownincrotown,4,Wed Jul 8 00:58:47 2015 UTC,"Furkan Aldemir can rebound - and pretty efficiently, might I add - but that's pretty much all he is good for. Not just in terms of his defensive game, but his overall game. Whenever he's out on the court, he plays so sluggishly and carefree (albeit not in a good way) that you might forget he was there if it wasn't for his tall, awkward stature.  Reggie Evans was also a rebounding machine, but he was almost utilized for that purpose alone. If Evans were younger, and we needed a big man whose role primarily focused on rebounding the basketball, I'd still likely opt for Evans simply because he's a bit quicker, more athletic, and has some killer facial hair.  But yeah, I think the only reason why Aldemir continues to get playing time is because we need somebody to play C when Noel and/or Okafor get tired...  Edit: didn't catch the game tonight but I just saw that Aldemir shot 3 3-pointers. What the fuck?"
sixers,3chsgx,digiskunk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"I actually don't agree with him being sluggish or carefree - you can't be a good rebounder if you're not scrapping. He's not an explosive athlete, so I can see how it looks sluggish, esp. since he was out of shape."
sixers,3chsgx,ferpo_perp,6,Wed Jul 8 11:34:25 2015 UTC,Yeah. Too bad its the only thing he can do :/
sixers,3chsgx,noeltojoel,24,Wed Jul 8 00:37:57 2015 UTC,3-5 from downtown tonight
sixers,3chsgx,fcobrien,7,Wed Jul 8 00:48:35 2015 UTC,I stand corrected O_o who needs sauce. Translation of sauce in Turkish please!
sixers,3chsgx,noeltojoel,7,Wed Jul 8 00:49:57 2015 UTC,Sos
sixers,3chsgx,ikenjake,10,Wed Jul 8 01:38:05 2015 UTC,"Bullshit, he's a good defender and sets great screens."
sixers,3chsgx,themightypooperscoop,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:07:03 2015 UTC,"No, he was a really bad defender last year. Hopefully he can adjust, but he definitely was not good."
sixers,3chsgx,zigzagzil,2,Wed Jul 8 13:36:42 2015 UTC,"Not much evidence to suggest Aldemir was ""really bad"" on defense.   His rim protection numbers were excellent and opponents shot 2% worse against him from the floor from 2-point range (Furk got lit up by perimeter shooters, which isn't surprising). His defensive rating for the season was 104, which was third on Philly behind Noel and T-Rob. If you consider defensive rebounding part of defense, he's obviously solid there.   We all saw Furk get absolutely manhandled by a few guys like DeMarcus late in the season, which might be creating the perception that he was lousy. He was occasionally overpowered by strong centers, struggled to close-out against stretch bigs and fouled too much (6.4 per 36 minutes)."
sixers,3chsgx,lilgodboy,2,Wed Jul 8 15:02:57 2015 UTC,"His on/off splits are horrendously bad. 108.4 on, compared to 100.1 off. Granted, he was not on the court with Noel much until the end of the season, but that's really bad. His DRPM was also -2.29, suggesting he was bad there. Really only box-score based metrics give him credit for being good, and that's primarily due to rebounding (which he was good at).   His rim protection numbers are ""ok"" but his contest % looks fairly low even for his minutes, which matches the eye test on him.   Defensive rating (at least the one on bball-ref) to me is not very meaningful."
sixers,3chsgx,zigzagzil,2,Wed Jul 8 15:09:25 2015 UTC,"That's fair, although Furk's noisy on/off numbers, which show the Sixers' offensive rating being 5 points better per 100 possessions with him on the floor, indicate that he played in lineups with more shooters than defenders. He played a lot of minutes with Covington, Hollis and Ish in the second half, which backs that up.  45% rim protection is fantastic, although, as I said, tiny sample size. From the eye test, I believe numbers showing he contested fairly well in the paint, but really had trouble closing out on shooters. I don't put that much stock in individual defensive rating either, but it's not a glaring red light in his case.   In general, to be a good defender, Furk has to either get fast enough to guard mobile PFs or strong enough to check Cs. Right now, he's somewhere in between."
sixers,3chsgx,lilgodboy,5,Wed Jul 8 16:40:55 2015 UTC,Absolutely no one has a problem with guys like Reggie Evans and their one dimensional talents. Put him on the second unit to allow Noel/Okafor to rest and you know your production won't dip bc of putbacks and second chances
sixers,3chsgx,bonobo14,5,Wed Jul 8 02:15:31 2015 UTC,Looks like he can hit threes too!

sixers,3chsgx,eagles420,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:51:18 2015 UTC,I wonder if they're trying to emulate Embiid's skill set with him taking so many 3 point shots recently to see how Embiid could possibly work out along side Okafor.
sixers,3chv9i,Fasyed21,8,Wed Jul 8 01:00:34 2015 UTC,I hope he skip the tarheel
sixers,3chv9i,throwaweight7,6,Wed Jul 8 01:02:36 2015 UTC,I liked the tender embrace with T. J. McConnell just before that.
sixers,3chv9i,aumenous,4,Wed Jul 8 01:06:50 2015 UTC,He needs to start trading autographs for second round picks
sixers,3chv9i,noeltojoel,3,Wed Jul 8 01:51:16 2015 UTC,Missed the game. What was his stat line?
sixers,3chv9i,sharke93,2,Wed Jul 8 02:22:59 2015 UTC,"If you haven't checked already, 13 points on 5/12 shooting, 9 rebounds (5 offensive)."
sixers,3chv9i,the_wheyfinder,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:36:04 2015 UTC,Not sure why he wouldnt check in the first place.. a lot faster to find the stats than someone commenting back
sixers,3chv9i,skOzy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:40:58 2015 UTC,"Lmao ya thats just weird. Already on the internet, why not just find the answer yourself and some highlights while you're at it."
sixers,3chv9i,J4BRONI,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:39:50 2015 UTC,He went right for the easiest/closest fan.  He needs to learn to set up closer to the locker room if he ever hopes to be elite for future autograph sessions.
