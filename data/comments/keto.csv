keto,3e2901,Prisaneify,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:02:04 2015 UTC,"In Australia a ""Long black"" is 2 shots of coffee poured over hot water, and if you can find a good cafe, it'll change your life.  Drinking 24oz of anything is A LOT. I don't think even that amount of heavy cream would be good for you.  If you find espressos or americanos too bitter the barista has simply over-extracted your coffee. You'd expect some bitterness, but the right  extraction levels can see some coffees tasting somewhat sweet and juicy.  I am a big fan of the toddy cold brew system if you want SUPER cheap coffee on the go, super strong caffeine content, and cold and deliciously refreshing! Can also mix with sparkling water if it's too strong. https://toddycafe.com/"

I worked at Panera for years and when people asked me questions like this is was really annoying. My job is to take your order and make the food and answer basic questions.

This is not some stranger that I just met.  This is a person I interact with on a daily basis.  I'm not shaping my point of view off of one social interaction.    Additionally, this is in a Hospital.  There are other people who have even more legitimate/ medical reasons than I do for NEEDING to see the nutrition information.

She is in a customer service position she needs to make sure her CS skills are up to par.  Personally i would have made sure a complaint was filed, and if i was the manager i would like to know these things because it not only looks bad on the establishment, but it looks bad on the manager also.  Don't get me wrong the other barista sounds awesome and is going above and beyond her job responsibility because she is a caring human being.  And for that i would also make sure the manager knows how wonderful that person is.

It's not even insulin resistance (well maybe technically?) but my body just digests sugar very slowly regardless of how much insulin I put out. Which explains why I've never felt a 'sugar rush' in my life, and why I'm always hungry after eating carbs. Apparently this is closely tied into my PCOS. Anyway I got that gestational diabetes test and my insulin level 2-hours-post-sugary-drink was fucking 756. SEVEN HUNDRED. and fifty six. I went on keto that day and really haven't looked back. All I think of in my head when I see carbs is ""756"". Thinking of my poor lil pancreas struggling away to put out a useless product that does nothing for me...

Also get a cucumber or an orange and a bag of ice.  What we do is we get a big clay or ceramic teapot and fill it with Ice and sliced cucumber or orange. We then pour in 4 shots of gin and top it off with the slimline tonic.  We let it sit for a few minutes and then pour it into small teacups and just sip while watching a movie or something.  Really really refreshing and tasty.  Not very manly looking.

I'm kinda weird, so some of the foods I prepare are not for everybody, but here's a more or less typical day:   Breakfast: one egg, beaten and microwaved with garlic salt; half gallon of water Lunch: leftovers or, more often, 4 oz spinach with 2 tbsp dressing; 2 tbsp chia mixed with 1 oz shredded cheddar and 7 slices turkey pepperoni; string cheese 3 p.m. snack: 1 oz almonds Pre-cooking snack: 2 tbsp hummus (preferably edamame hummus); another half gallon of water Dinner: meat with vegetables, like a taco mix or casserole Dessert: either a ~4 oz assortment from my latest cheese expedition, 2 tbsp chia in 1 tbsp butter, or 1 oz almonds/walnuts sprinkled with Splenda and heated   Occasionally to aid satiety I'll add a couple heated bullion cubes in water in a coffee cup. I try not to do that too often because the jury's still out for me on sodium. I also have what may be an overreliance on sucralose-flavored water.  All that runs me in the 1600-1750 range, which is right at TDEE-500 depending on which calculator you use. I don't really worry about the exact number because my exercise underestimation seems to make it up."

The vanilla is a good way to go but the strawberry tastes way to artificial to me and it was hard to drink but the drinks themselves are like thick smoothies.

As for your progress, it depends, many find it difficult to lose weight eating more carbs which is why many are here, but if you can maintain a deficit eating more carbs then it shouldn't necessarily affect your progress but I don't think this approach is necessary and with time the rash will resolve"
keto,3e2nrn,anbeav,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:30 2015 UTC,That is another reason I stayed keto even after the steroids made it worse. I have read that some people can wait it out and it naturally just fades away. Mine has just continued to grow! That dinner was honestly the first time I have cheated. The highest that I have gone since starting is 25 carbs.   This past week (before the dinner) it had started to spread down to the top of my butt and now it is completely gone. The only things left are some slightly darker marks where that rash was at its worst. I think I could deal with the rash if it was just a cosmetic issue but it was so itchy!

She was adamant that it was in no way connected to my diet and diagnosed it as something else. I went back for a referral for a dermatologist and she was reluctant about it and said that they were just going to tell me the same thing.

When you change your intake and are in a deficit for an extended period your body produces Cortisol which can have a stimulating effect. I imagine it is the same initially when your body is not getting the carbs/sugars it is used to. As your body adjusts the stress hormone (Cortisol) should subside a bit letting you get some rest. ALSO these other guys are right about electrolytes ESPECIALLY magnesium. Low magnesium can be a cause for anxiety and sleeplessness. Hopefully as your body adjusts and you make sure your magnesium intake is good you will get some quality rest again. Good luck!   P.S. look up Natural Calm...it is a good flavored magnesium powder you can add to your water before bed to help."

I was still a little groggy when I woke up this morning so I'm going to take it 2 hours before going to bed tonight.

Most Ketopians will drink coffee with heavy cream and/or coconut oil to increase their fat intake while getting in some fluid.

Weaker coffee in larger amounts is far better for you than strong coffee in small amounts. Coffee was revised as an acceptable beverage in the latest Atkins approaches and according to A New Atkins for a New You, it may actually prove beneficial in aiding weight loss gently.

Gravitating towards IF, such as eating once a day, is common on keto due to its appetite suppression effects, the satiety of eating fat, and the fact that we have limitless energy access via our body fat stores. You don't have to eat breakfast at all, but sure, if the BPC gets you going and that's all you want, go for it. Just make sure to adjust your macros/food plan for the day accordingly, based on: adequate protein based on your weight, carbs < 50g/day, modulating fat intake based on whether you're eating at a deficit (thus relying on body fat for energy rather than dietary fat), or eating at maintenance (thus getting higher amounts of dietary fat)."

I couldn't shop over the weekend like I normally do, so instead of doing the stuff I wanted to do after work yesterday, I went to the store and loaded up on stuff that would keep me on track this week.

keto,3e2jad,anbeav,2,Tue Jul 21 13:40:42 2015 UTC,"I've been doing that. Sounds kind of silly, but I've been writing in a journal about it. Just so I am more cognizant of these situations. I've found the hardest situations I've encountered is my own friends and family. They do not share similar goals or care about their health as much as myself. It's been kind of hard because I have to alienate myself from them. I can't do all the same things like them [go out and grab food (to an extent), drink, and whatever else]. If I do join in, it has a negative effect on them, because my lifestyle choices limit theirs as well. In some cases I get ostracized. Which I sometimes try to avoid. But I think the time is right, and I have a pretty good support system. So I'm very ready for a change."
keto,3e2jad,anbeav,5,Tue Jul 21 14:08:18 2015 UTC,"Not silly at all, journaling is a great way to learn about yourself through this process.    You don't have to alienate yourself from anyone to live a healthy lifestyle.  Few people I know care or even pay attention to what they eat and don't exercise, it doesn't have to affect my choices.  I go out with people all the time, most restaurants have a keto friendly option, there are keto friendly drinks or usually I just go for the company and hang out.  Do NOT let anyone let you think that your lifestyle choices affect their choices, they don't and it's often it's just insecurity that you are doing something they wish they could do but aren't doing.  Do not bring up your diet, just go, eat what you can and don't make it a big deal and few people will really care and if they do they get over it.  Yes, it can be challenging when others don't have the same lifestyle but you definitely do not have to be an outsider, often the issue is people make themselves the outsider because they feel like they will be whereas if they didn't do that they are welcomed and accepted. Your friends have to get used to your new choices and most will as long as you don't make it a thing."

How about pouring my Crystal Light into my Stoli, when all my friends were drinking out of the keg for a bachelors party, sure they poked fun.  But, most of the time they did not care or notice.  And when they did notice, they were happy for me trying to do something to better myself.  More than one of my friends actually told me they were proud of me for resisting the easy temptation.

keto,3e2ehs,anbeav,0,Tue Jul 21 12:59:04 2015 UTC,"I do track. We use some paleo cook books that have the calories/macros per serving.  For instance last night, we had mexican burgers. Patties with guac/salsa and a side of sweet potatoes + bacon, I basically just had half the sweet potatoes that she did."
keto,3e2ehs,RaveninaBottle,4,Tue Jul 21 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"You should be skipping the sweet potatoes altogether. On keto, the word ""potato"" should be feared."
keto,3e2ehs,RaveninaBottle,5,Tue Jul 21 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"Are you using a food scale? Also half the sweet potatoes she had could be a lot of carbs, so not really keto"
keto,3e2ehs,WillowWagner,0,Tue Jul 21 14:43:26 2015 UTC,"It ends up being 5.4 carbs per serving with 2.6 grams of dietary fat. And thats for a cup, which I only had half.  I have a food scale but I don't enforce my gf use it when she cooks for me. Its something I can explore."
keto,3e2ehs,HotSeamenGG,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"Cup is not accurate, you need to be weighing your food. It's not the carbs though, it's the calories but still if you're nibbling on half carb servings all day that's going to add up to something that's not keto so you can't conclude keto isn't working   I would explore it sooner rather than later if you're frustrated gaining weight"
keto,3e2ehs,HotSeamenGG,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:30 2015 UTC,"It's really surprising sometimes how little the human body needs in terms of calories to survive. I'm a shorter, smaller guy than average, and do not do heavy work. I only need 1,100 - 1,300 calories to actually sustain my weight, but without heavily fortified foods or supplements, it's impossible to get proper nutrition. If your lifestyle changes, you'll gain or lose weight accordingly if you don't adjust your eating. Keto might have worked to help lose weight, and if that's all you wanted to do with it, then it served its purpose and you should adapt again to your new environment. I don't think keto has to be a lifestyle, or any weightloss diet for that matter."

keto,3e2ehs,frostednuts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:39:59 2015 UTC,"Some nutrients are required to help your body able to digest certain things - thiamin, for example, helps your body process carbs, and it can only be synthesized in non-meats (even if keto is a high-fat focused diet, you're still eating some carbs, so thiamin is still important). Eh, if you used to take a vitamin, you probably are at least somewhat aware of the importance of it all... But yeah, it's harder to manage weight with malnutrition for those kinds of reasons."

keto,3e0uz1,DouglasPR,4,Tue Jul 21 05:19:50 2015 UTC,"Not to minimise the struggle that keto (or any significant shift in one's habits) typically is especially during the acute transition, but...   the success of a ""diet"" is that it actually begins nourishing the body and mind.  and acceptance and adherence are not about discipline and having a stronger constitution than others. it doesn't make you a better person. it isn't simple nor any one factor, but when you FEEL better - and see results like these (which are common in the subset!) - then it is not about buckling down and just gritting your teeth through a challenge because you're stronger than someone else.   failing, temporarily or otherwise, should not be assigned to weakness and stupidity.  but to the very hard shift and learning curve that changing sometimes everything you thought you knew, practicing new behaviours, identifying your individual strengths and temptation weaknesses.   and, most of all, being able to visualise what the new lifestyle actually, practically, day by day, looks like with the same clarity with which you can review the past.   This takes the amazing stories and real life pictures and support of a community like this. Real help sorting through the tsunami-sized waves of misinformation and platitudes...    i may have needed to tag this [RANT], tho certainly not against your comment itself"
keto,3e0uz1,jessfm,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:08 2015 UTC,"True, but a lot of 'whole grains' are just garbage grains. It's like a buzzword people use. I agree that when not on Keto people should be getting real food, fruits, veggies, real grains, meat. But our nutritional knowledge is so skewed that people equate Wonder Bread with healthy, low-fat with good for you and anything with fruit being good (No, Hostess fruit pies are not healthy lady at the checkout :P )"

If not, I'm sure it'll be buried anyway -- so hopefully -- no harm, no foul.  After going through my weight loss (I dropped about 30% of my total mass), what I learned about most conversations since, usually people were/are talking about themselves in the context of me. It was a little confusing at first, but eventually I figured it out.   We've all heard it. Someone asks you how you lost weight, and you tell them how. They say ""I could never give up <insert_carby_food_here>."" Sure, there is an inner 6 year old inside that wants to throw a tantrum that says ""I just gave you the right answer, motherfucker! Why are you not listening after asking your own damn question?!?!""  Or people feel free to take creative license with how we look. They range from the innocent when a child says ""Uncle Illogic_Bomb, I can get my arms all the way around you now!"", to the crazy, as you have posted, OP.   Your friends (as you call them), are saying things that make you uncomfortable. You can't change what people are going to say. But you can change how you react to them. Please don't take this as victim blaming, that's not my MO here. Take some time to reflect why you are uncomfortable, and make yourself a better person from there. Eventually, you'll see the comments for what they are: absurd. Once you get that, you'll be untouchable.  Seeing the highest rated comment (at the moment of this writing) saying ""Don't be polite[...]"" saddens me a bit. You are the ambassador for all of us in /r/keto in your part of the world. Gandhi said ""You cannot inject new ideas into a man’s head by chopping it off; neither will you infuse a new spirit into his heart by piercing it with a dagger."".

I'm inclined to give people the benefit of the doubt and suggest that maybe, just maybe, they are simply trying to reverse psychology you (and themselves) into believing that they never judged you when you were heavy and they loved you all along. It's such an unhealthy way to portray that though and I see it all the time. People like to compliment your hefty aspects and diminish your accomplishments because they don't want to be seen as someone who values fitness, because in some twisted sense that translates into devaluing heavy individuals.

keto,3e003f,Fuhrer_Of_Flapjacks,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:46 2015 UTC,"A few things i will point out.  1.) Most people's negative responses tend to come from a internal space.  They feel insecure about themselves so they project those concerns onto you to make them feel better.  2.) If people are willing to speak honestly in front of your face (good or bad) that is something you should fine ways to be ok with.  Seeing as they could have easily just talked behind your back and lied to your face.  AKA it could be worse and you could completely be unaware of it.  3.)  Just because they say these things does not make them true.  You have the choice of going down a few paths the spiteful route, completely ignore it route, or the comment sarcastically route.  Personally i am a sarcastic son of a beech so i tend to go that route more often then not.  The benefit with that is with sarcasm there is always some truth to what you say but if you add light hearted humor to it people tend to not respond negatively to it.  What ever the case may be, and what route you take never let these things BOTHER you.  People show their own securities in the comments they say.  Just remember that the next time you hear a negative comment and look at the person you can see exactly why they feel that way.  The person that said ""i'm happy your not my wife"" how large of a person was he?  Could it have been he feels he wouldn't be able to keep up around you?  He would feel like he would be eating a ton of food compared to your plate?  Person who said you have no boobs left woman or man?  If woman does she tend to use her breasts to gain attention of people, because she feels that's the only way to attract them?  Very quickly you can see how a simple comment from 1 person can quickly be turned around back onto them to realize exactly why they said it.  Sorry for the wall of text i went through this with someone who was anti keto kept saying ""youll gain it back"" .. ""i did it already you will get sick of eatting the same things"" .. ""by the 3rd week if i ate one more egg was going to throw up"".  I was sitting there going i havent eatten the same thing more then 2 or 3 days in a row (those days were if i made a meatloaf or something).  I had 0 eggs (unless used as binder in meatloaf).  I quickly realized she was unhappy with her weight and saying these things gave her the justification to NOT do anything about her weight because even with my success ""i will fail"".  That did not upset me i completely understood why she said it, if anything it fueled me more to keep going.  Down 82lbs and got another 111lbs more to go.  Her comments are never hurtful because i know there is no malice associated to them, it is more to keep her happy.  I hope this helps you in with interacting with them.  And remember if they didn't say anything they could have easily just talked behind your back and that honestly in my eyes would have been worse."

keto,3e003f,Frozenlock,0,Tue Jul 21 09:32:18 2015 UTC,"Everyone is saying that you should find new friends and I completely disagree. Friends, especially in groups tend to say things in jest that are disparaging or even hurtful but rarely are the comments meant as insults. They are your friends and sometimes say things that they shouldn't for a laugh and it seems that it is at your expense.  I have said somethings to my friends that were not appreciated and I didn't even know that I had crossed the line until they told me.  The last thing I would have wanted was for my friend to just cut contact for something that could have just been talked out.    You answer your question, you should just talk to them directly. Explain to them that what they are saying is hurtful. If they are truly worried for you then talk to them on the side, educate them on what you have changed in your diet. Invite them to a typical dinner or to exercise with you.   Good friends are very hard to find. Especially those that you retained into your 30s."
keto,3e003f,twinsocks,0,Tue Jul 21 11:44:58 2015 UTC,"Also 5'6"", I can guess that 126lbs muscular must be pretty lean. First, it's possible their comments are bothering you because they are most likely concerned and could be correct. I would take your health into your own hands and find out what your body fat percentage is and research if it's healthy or not. Don't rush over this or try to look for what you want to find. This is your body and you wanted to be the healthiest you can. If you find out for sure from a legitimate online source that you don't need any more fat on you, quote your stats to your friends. ""Actually, I'm in the normal range of blah blah for my height and I feel great"". If I had a friend tell me he's glad I'm not his wife, I would have said, 'That makes both of us' and laughed. After you've done your research and talked to your friends about it, tell them you're sick of hearing it and to lay off."

keto,3e003f,tdotnrd,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:52:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with the comment below that you should listen when some people tell you that you have lost enough weight.  ""Some people"" because other people may be trying to sabotage you or are just mean.  On the other hand, this situation comes up often here when parents of teenagers tell them to slow down their weight loss, and the parent in me says that is probably well meaning advice.  If you would have said that you had reached your weight by just dieting, I would have said it might be time to quit the cutting and move to heavy lifting instead.  Since you are already lifting, and not doing excessive cardio, it seems like you are doing everything just right.  You might want to confirm your BF % and focus on that instead, as you might actually need to add even a bit more muscle.  As you look at some of the progress posts of some here, you might find a woman your height at 125 who then continued lifting and ended at 140 and you may prefer that look as well."
keto,3e003f,Frozenlock,2,Tue Jul 21 04:07:52 2015 UTC,I've been listening to my doctor and my husband who is very fitness minded.  Also have an appointment with a trainer at work for a fitness check.
keto,3e003f,tdotnrd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:19:00 2015 UTC,"My ex is your size, and I understand the comments about being too skinny.  At your height, there is a big difference between 125 and 135, and sometimes I also thought that she looked ""too skinny"" at 125.  But she was not lifting nor exercising, and sometimes weight loss is just related to stress or illness or poor eating, and then that can become less attractive and less healthy.  Many women fear becoming too ""bulky"" when lifting, until they find out that the opposite is more likely and they see or talk to women who really do lift.  After that, it then gets back to controlling your body fat percentage, and choosing if you want to go for a 10% BF level and look chiseled or a 23% BF level and look curvy.  Developing good musculature promotes bone strength as well, which will help you over the rest of your life.  Too low a BF% in women can mess up your hormones and reproductive processes and make you more susceptible to some illnesses.  Listening to your doctor and husband is just right.  Going overboard and trying to be as skinny as some photo-shopped magazine models is not.  I feel that 10% BF at 125 pounds (112.5/12.5) is too low, but 23% BF at 135 pounds (104/31) might be a bit too high, and (110/25) is ""nice."""

Set protein to 117 grams, 0.8 grams per lb lean mass   Also check out /r/xxketo if you haven't already   Focus on commitment and discipline, not motivation. It's nice when it's around but it's fleeting and it will always fade, discipline and commitment are lasting. Commit to this and yourself, make it long lasting lifestyle change.   General newbie advice -   Electrolytes, electrolyte, electrolytes, follow the guidelines in the FAQ!  Read the FAQ a few times Learn what you are doing, why you are doing it and how you are going to do it Read labels and ingredients and ask questions at restaurants; trust nothing, question everything, carbs are fairly ubiquitous Look before you eat - look up the information online or read the label before you put food in your mouth Follow the plan and let it work. Plateaus happen, accept it and KCKO (keep calm, keto on). Take measurements and pictures. Get rid of any foods you will not be eating Think about what you can eat and not what you can't eat - there's no need to feel limited on keto, yes an entire food group limited but you can eat as you otherwise would just exclude the carbs don't overcomplicate it - keto is nothing more than real food minus the carbs Avoid substitutes, fully embrace a new way of eating  Commit to the plan and focus on the non-scale victories and benefit as well  Read the FAQ and follow the electrolyte guidelines as well as drink a lot of water Plan ahead - plan your meals, snacks at home, at work, in the car Avoid ketosis anxiety - if you overeat carbs or fall off the wagon, get right back up, learn from it and move on. You will be back in ketosis before you know you weren't.  No need to stress about it, focus on how you feel.  It's not ratios, it's net grams    Limit to 20 net grams carbs Meet your protein goal set based on activity and lean body mass Eat fat to satiety unless eating at a high deficit"

No breakfast, I have a disease which makes me feel very sick in the mornings and usually if I eat before 10 it'll just come back up. Nothing to do with the band, that issue was pre-existing.   Egg-muffin at about 10.30 or whenever I can grab it at work. Lunch is always salad leaves, halloumi and meat (usually chicken thigh), 2g carb of dressing,   with a Pepperami and a 2 carb jelly pot. Might have another Pepperami for a snack in the afternoon. Dinner is usually a green veg (cabbage, broccoli, spinach) and chicken thigh or salmon. Dessert would be my terrible daily sin of a satsuma.   I use a scale if making something to a recipe. Otherwise it's half a cabbage, whole broccoli, two chicken thighs, one salmon fillet..."
keto,3dzihl,HotSeamenGG,13,Mon Jul 20 20:30:29 2015 UTC,"One trick I have found that's made it easier to track my calories is to actually log all my calories for the NEXT day. That is, figure out what I'm going to eat the night b efore. Then, I don't wing it during the day and find out by dinner time that I only have 200 calories and zero carbs left. You can also take time then to weigh/portion out your food. I'm surprised I don't mind weighing so much, its the MFP that I find somewhat time consuming. Not terrible, I spend maybe 10 min a day, but that's because I'm being very meticulous and cross-referencing to ensure accuracy."

keto,3dzihl,thelastpie,4,Mon Jul 20 22:00:59 2015 UTC,"Just gotta track unfortunately. If you want real results, you have to track. Try tracking and see what happens. It's very easy to overeat. If you're staying the same weight you're probably eating maintenance calories. Gotta eat at a deficiency to lose weight. Spend the extra 3~5 minutes putting food info into an app a day vs not tracking for 1 month and seeing no results. At least w/ the tracking you know where to adjust. With the no tracking... can't troubleshoot. Stalling for ~2 weeks can happen. 3 weeks is unusual, which usually means too much calories. Use the keto calculator on the right side to calculate your daily calories @ 20% deficiency."

keto,3dzihl,fivecentpsychiatrist,4,Mon Jul 20 20:40:18 2015 UTC,"Not at all. It adds maybe 30 seconds to your cooking to weigh food, logging takes some getting used to but I don't even think about it now. I just do it lol. It gets easier after the first 2 weeks. Promise haha. Also just an FYI. Fat is a MAX (it helps keep you full), protein is a goal to hit (to make sure you don't lose too much lean muscle mass), and 20 grams of carbs is a limit (to keep you in ketosis). Keep it simple lol."
keto,3dzihl,helloimwilliamholden,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:17 2015 UTC,"As far as I know you can go up to like 50 and still stay in ketosis, but it's suggested to be below 20.  And yeah, start counting and logging. I do it raw, like I weigh my meats, liquids etc. raw and then put it in the logger, check the calories, then I switch around the weights until it fits. Of course I have planned out the ingedients beforehand but still, it takes about 10 minutes each day for me. I'm on day 4, and I have to say it's way easier than I anticipated.  For example today I had thawed about 500g of chickenbreast, and I thought it'd be nice with some stew kind of thing, so I put in 1dl of heavy cream and some tomato paste. That worked very well with my macros, and I seasoned it with cayenne, chili and paprika, added some water because I thought it was too little sauce. It turned out really well, actually one of the better chicken dishes I've made.  Anyway, the point is I just put in whatever ingedients I want to use, and adjust the amounts so it fits my macros, it's really easy."
keto,3dzihl,fivecentpsychiatrist,2,Mon Jul 20 22:21:46 2015 UTC,Glad it works for ya! And yeah def easier. I measure my food raw too. Not sure if it makes a difference but it's worked so far. Personally I prefer chicken thighs. Cheaper and fattier :D!

keto,3dzihl,RobertLxander,2,Tue Jul 21 17:40:29 2015 UTC,"That's definitely the problem, I think.  My law school prof used to say ""get a handle on the basics first"".  Tracking is one of those.  When you've done that for a while (a couple of months), you'll be able to estimate portion sizes, calorie counts, food you can eat without gaining or making you stall, and tweak your diet to your macros appropriately.  Carbs and protein intake are what I mainly watch out for -- limit carbs and hit protein goal.  As /u/anbeav told me before, fat is the flexible macro.  Eat more of it if you're still hungry and you've already met your protein goal.  Just try not to go over the max limit of your fat macro or it will also affect weight loss."
keto,3dzihl,Addbutter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"Immediately that screams at me ""not enough fat"" and ""too much lean protein"" (chicken). It might be wise to weigh and check what percentage of what macros you're getting. I'd hazard a guess at too much protein and far too little fat."

If you are struggling to lose weight on keto, I recommend counting calories.  I tried keto but did not lose weight for a while.  Once I started counting calories, it became clear to me that I had simply been eating a maintenance level of calories, but of all low-carb foods.  Too much food is still too much food.  I tried again, but set a firm limit of calories per day and kept track.  The weight has been falling off (down 60lbs so far in less than 5 months), and I developed a better sense of how much food I should really be eating.  By now, I don't even have to count calories rigorously, since I am much more aware of how many calories I'm eating without actually counting them.  That, plus my new habits, keep me naturally eating the right amount."
keto,3dzihl,znick5,5,Mon Jul 20 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"P.S:  You may ask yourself, ""If I'm just counting calories anyway, why do I need to eat ketogenic foods?""  The answer is that ketogenic foods will make your body feel full on fewer calories than high-carb foods, and the lack of sugar will wean you off sugar rushes, stopping you from developing the cravings that lead you to eat candy and desserts.  It may take a week or two of effort and willpower to kick any sugar addiction you may have, but once you're over that hurdle, it's smooth sailing.  Good luck."
keto,3dzihl,yumyumfat,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, it looks like that's the way to go.

keto,3dzihl,e32,3,Mon Jul 20 23:09:33 2015 UTC,"That's OK though.  The biggest problems with new diets is that people try to change every bad habit they've ever had, all at once.  So you got through a few weeks of making better food choices and re-establishing good habits.  Now that those parts are easier, you add on calorie-counting until that seems like much less work.  It's all about the long game, and making good decisions most of the time for a long time."

But right now you're probably still in the shocking your body stage (it takes a good two weeks to genuinely get into ketosis) and you might be just getting into ketosis as your body decides to be an asshole and make you more insulin resistant if it's nearing your time of the month.   It also looks like you might still be having too much carbohydrate. You really need to get that crap below 50g a day, preferably below 25g."

keto,3dzihl,DMDorDie,7,Mon Jul 20 21:55:59 2015 UTC,"Scales can be deceptive. Personally, these days I'm against weighing oneself or counting calories. I was downvoted below threshold last I voiced this sentiment, so read this while you can. People love their second by second, molecule by molecule trackers and scales. Since you're frequently peeing and drinking water, plus you've just finished some stressful eating habits and then 'reset' them, it might take some time before things stabilize. By the way, getting more sodium (add 1-2g/day, in most cases) can resolve the frequent urination issue and help you stay hydrated (perhaps removing the need to drink more than 3 liters/day water), which might stabilize any fluctuations of water weight."
keto,3dzihl,xklinx,6,Tue Jul 21 00:32:06 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Weighing myself and counting calories quickly turns into an obsession that gets unhealthy so I avoid it. Realizing I'm not losing quickly enough or even gained has been enough to make me quit completely in the past, so now I'm just going by what my clothes tell me. The main reason I picked up keto again is so I could feel like I was in control of my relationship to food whereas my whole life it's been the other way around. Yes weight loss is an added benefit of eating this way, but it's the most healthful way to eat with my PCOS and that's how I look at it. I don't own a scale and can't really see a time I'd be interested in weighing myself in the future."
keto,3dzihl,xklinx,3,Tue Jul 21 19:21:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, a big part of my choosing to try keto was wanting to feel like I COULD make sensible food choices, when for so long I've made terrible ones, or been forced to eat badly because of the band restricting textures too much.

You may or may not get to your weight loss goals (depends on how much you want to lose weight) but that will require a lot of patience on your end since you're winging it.  I'm the same height as you, had PCOS (diagnosed for several years), was T2 (for several years again) when I started but not anymore, was hormonally and metabolically challenged because of all the yoyo dieting, and keto did work because I followed the advice on the sidebar and of all the helpful users around here.

So my original comment is contextualized since I wasn't replying directly to OP. Like I said before, not losing weight fast enough, or what I deemed fast enough, made me feel like a failure and give up. I was weighing myself multiple times a day, but even when I would weigh myself once a week it was dangerous enough for me to obsess over and feel like absolute shit if it wasn't going the way I wanted. I got close the first time, but was under 18, and the only one eating keto in my house so it was basically impossible once my mom got tired of it. The other times were just borne out of desperation to lose weight fast and not an intentional attempt to better my health, which would inevitably result in the complexes and obsessing that sabotaged before. I also tried starting in the middle of the year in college without evaluating what I could abd couldn't eat so I got bored quickly. I was being a bit hyperbolic saying I'll never weigh myself, but it's not going to be the main way I measure progress."

keto,3e39v0,Avamedic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're not getting enough sodium, those are the classic symptoms. You need about 1-2g extra sodium each day while eating keto (similar to how folks need to lower sodium intake while eating carbs). Get 3-5g sodium/day routinely. This is the priority. Following this, make sure to get adequate potassium and magnesium through food, e.g. ~2g/day and ~350mg/day respectively.  Full keto-adaptation takes about 3-4 weeks, also, keep in mind."

keto,3dzpbu,HotSeamenGG,6,Tue Jul 21 18:20:21 2015 UTC,"From what I've read in several sources, as long as you have sufficient sodium (NaCl), you're fine. If the serum (blood) Na gets too low, potassium (KCl) is substituted in the urine. If the K gets too low, magnesium (MgCl) is substituted. Low serum KCl can result in headaches and low serum MgCl can result in muscle cramps. If the heart has a cramp it's very bad.  I use Lite Salt (tm) on my eggs and if I have a foot cramp in my AM exercises, I double up on the NaCl / KCl for a day or two. I also eat spinach as well as guacamole, although I'll switch to AVOCADOs soon."
keto,3dzpbu,parl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:15:40 2015 UTC,"The heart cannot cramp such as skeletal muscle cramps, it has many safeguards to prevent and correct erroneous spasms if any occur. I hope I don't come off as a know-it-all here. Just saying the heart can't cramp as most people think of cramps.  More know-it-allness. The electrolytes for the heart include calcium along with potassium magnesium, and sodium. Both high and low serum levels may effect your heart.   @OP The Keto FAQ has guidelines for electrolytes. Drink water daily. The human body generally regulates itself well with salt, to say it is vital would be such an understatement. I don't know how you are tracking your electrolytes, consider that potassium is often not on food labels, there may be foods you eat which don't list potassium in them, personally I've never seen meat labeled with it's potassium content even though all meat has potassium. You can always look for any signs of Keto Flu as in the FAQ, that would be a sign of an electrolyte inbalance. Nu Salt is another salt, similar to No Salt, and Lite Salt was mentioned already its half Sodium half Potassium salt with Calcium and Magesium too."

Besides there's a small amount of Mg in my Ca supplement already. And it also has vit D3 and that's important for Ca absorption. And CaO is the least worst kind to take. I'm taking Ca-citrate; not sure if there's a better one. I'm not about to eat eggshells.

keto,3dzpbu,Reverserer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:59 2015 UTC,"Not exactly, the 1.5g/day is suggested as over and above what you find in foods. With the daily ""RDA"" this puts it up to about 5g+/day.  However, unless you feel the symptoms of low electrolytes you really shouldn't need to worry about it. Sodium is more important because your kidneys do actively dump it, over hydration makes this worse and not enough salt results in potassium being dumped in order to keep the sodium potassium balance in the cells. There's a lot of potassium in most meats and in dark green plants, so most people on keto shouldn't actively need to supplement it. So long as you're not over cooking your meat/veggies and tossing the drippings/water you will mostly only need the sodium to keep things balanced out. And magnesium as always unless you're eating tons of seafood."
keto,3dzpbu,Chocothundathighs,2,Tue Jul 21 03:53:51 2015 UTC,"Volek and Phinney's books just recommend getting potassium through food. Based on their research, we're talking about 1-2g/day, total. Low sodium due to natriuresis is the key issue, and causes low potassium, so you really just need to supplement sodium, 1-2g/day (to get a total of ~5g/day), and make sure to adequate potassium through food, though the occasional dash of No-Salt doesn't hurt: adding a pinch to the broth you use to get 1-2g/day extra sodium works very well, it blends in with the taste and if anything enhances it. Magnesium you really only need to temporarily supplement (with chloride or citrate being the usually recommended kinds, not oxide) if you experience cramps and aren't getting 300-400mg/day through food."

I don't have a lot of time so sometimes it's frozen things I can cook fast like salmon, turkey burgers, frozen meatballs, sausages, etc.   Edit: When you feel like you need a diet coke, make some coffee.

When you say that you've had problems with units, are you talking about when you're entering a food item or the displayed summary?  In Cronometer, you can also set your own target ranges for each macro and micro nutrient - so no screaming at you unless you're under or over your preset limits."

keto,3dziap,HotSeamenGG,2,Tue Jul 21 12:43:05 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, I would think it was blood sugar related as well.

I.F. is no trouble for me, been doing it all week with Keto macros...in fact I ate dinner at 7 last night and just made Rocket Fuel Coffee ( 18 oz coffee 2TBS heavy Cream, 2 Tbs Grass Fed Organic Sweet Cream Butter, 1 TBS Cold Pressed Coconut Oil, stevia and a shake of cinnamon) haven't even sipped it yet and I feel great. I always (even before keto) squeeze one lemon into 32oz pure water while making my coffee...have to cleanse the body and get those natural electrolytes in before drinking a diuretic like coffee. While doing keto I am adding 1/4 tsp iodized salt to that."
keto,3dziap,Prisaneify,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:36 2015 UTC,Yeah. Getting electrolytes is important but no worries. You'll stop peeing so much after a week or so. And are ya allowed to drink rocket fuel/bullet proof coffee while in a fasted state since it has fair amount of calories?

keto,3dziap,gradedexposure,3,Mon Jul 20 22:39:26 2015 UTC,"Good for you, it sounds like you are easing into it which makes a TON of sense. I lost 46 LBS Intermittent Fasting with a 16/8 schedule 6 days a week and one heavy calorie refeed day. Losses have tapered down to .5 lbs every 2 weeks so I figured it was a good thing to take the next step and go from Slow/Low carbs to full keto. I am sure with minimal carbs (and the ones I did consume were high fiber carbs) that I was in ketosis pretty often so the transition has been easy thus far.

I do however take my multivitamin, magnesium, fish oil, and calcium (depending on what I plan to eat after the fasting is over) supplements when I wake up (during the 16 hours of fasting) and I supplement with a tiny bit of No Salt a few times a day. Otherwise water and an occasional Sprite Zero only. Never had any problems."

I used to snack on sunflower seeds all day when I work from home, and I stopped because it was using up so much of my allotted calories. Besides adding in vitamins and supplements in the morning, would adding some coconut oil to my coffee and drinking a cup of bullion be too much for a fasting period?"

I did a 30 hour fast without even trying.   My suggestion, though, is that you eat as much of your daily fat in your last meal as you can.  You need to drink a lot more water on keto as well. Pre keto I drank 2-3 liters of water a day... now I drunk 4-5.  And get your electrolytes."

keto,3e1c8t,KetoWut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:17:40 2015 UTC,"I haven't, but I went a-googling and found this:   So I take 40g of ""pork dust"", which doesn't need to be finely blended, and put in a quarter can (3.5 fl oz or 100 ml) of coconut milk, and then a little water to desired consistency. I add about 7 drops of stevia liquid to it. And depending on if the pork rinds are salted I will add salt to taste. I sprinkle some cinnamon over top and mix it up. Finally, I top it off with a bunch of shakes of powered xylitol :). It's probably the closest thing to cereal you'll get if it's cold. And it gets soft and mushy like oatmeal if you microwave it.   Which sounds pretty good. A little more desserty and decadent. I'll probably be trying it."

I've been like that since I was like 11 when my friends started smoking (curiously I've never known anyone that started smoking after they were 16, maybe people realise it's stupid by then) and I didn't want to because my mom would easily get pissed off when she hadn't had her smoke. Maybe I subconsciously realise I have an addict personality?  I'm not proud of this, but in my younger days if I noticed I was doing something almost every day, I would just quit doing it for a while, like eating sugar, or playing wow, just to see if I could do it.

When I brought up the fact I was doing keto, by turning down the pizza everybody else was eating, some of my other friends were skeptical.  He confirmed that the science is sound and as long as you follow the diet, there's no reason you can't lose tons of weight."

TMI as well,  the first few months my period were crazy heavy despite having mirena and was told it was just because when you lose fat so quickly,  it releases a lot of hormones.    After a few months and the weightloss slowed they went back to normal."
keto,3dxjrw,Addbutter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:00 2015 UTC,"Good to know, thanks for sharing. It's been incredibly heavy so far as well, but I'm keeping in mind what you and others have said about the body and hormones needing time to self regulate with all the fat losing."

keto,3dxjrw,lecirca,6,Mon Jul 20 11:59:27 2015 UTC,"I thought that too, about how much of those hormones I'm actually ingesting, but I thought that maybe in the long run they add up, especially since I've had hormone related issues for years. I guess the warning was more of a ""don't have animal fat as your main source of fat"" advice. Whic is okay because I get most of my fat from olive oil, coconut oil and butter.

keto,3dxjrw,biomags,7,Mon Jul 20 13:39:45 2015 UTC,"Hahaha I thought about it, but then I remembered I had told him (more than two years earlier, when I first went to see him) that I was eating low-fat, and he said that it wasn't really efficient, and that the better option would be to cut carbs a little. He mostly warned me against processed sugars and starches, so his focus was more on quality than quantity. I guess he's just as cautious as I was to say ""ketogenic"" :P"
keto,3dxjrw,biomags,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:29 2015 UTC,I'm reading this and very interested because my wife has endo. Have you seen benefits from keto that helped with endo? My wife and I are interested in trying keto (I've been lurking here for a bit) and I've been wondering if anyone has seen results that would help her.
keto,3dxjrw,SionnachDearg,4,Mon Jul 20 14:28:35 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I've only been on keto for about 20 days, so I'm not going to give you cold-cut answers, but:  I had been on a low carb diet for months before starting keto (basically I would do great for days/weeks, then crack and binge, but mostly my diet was pretty low-carb, for example I'd eat pasta/bread/rice once every two weeks or so, the rest of my carbs would be from a little fruit, but nothing crazy) and that has helped immensely. Helps with the pain, the bloating, the mood swings, the hormonal reactions, the heat flashes, the cramps, the nausea, just overall easier periods and no pain in between anymore, which is a miracle by itself. So yes, I'd say based on my experience with low/no carb and endo, I've definitely felt waaaay better without the carbs.  Also, ignore thisif it's too personal, but what's her stats? Is she on hormone replacement pills, did she have the surgery, does she currently have any cysts, etc... If I have that info I could give you more details about what helped me when I was in that situation.  Best of luck to both of you, not only on your keto journey (GO FOR IT), but in your dealing with endo. I know how debilitating it can be, and I really do hope that your wife at least goes low-carb, if not keto."
keto,3dxjrw,randomizeitpls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:44:23 2015 UTC,"I'm curious because I suspect I might have endo (waiting to get sent for an ultrasound, but symptoms match) - and I've been low carb/grain free/keto for almost 4 years but the pelvic pain is something new in the last year or so (maybe longer, I had some other chronic pain/gastro issues I was sorting out). I'm just curious what other treatments you've tried. I've got a friend who had it pretty severe (she was bedridden for a few years, ended up having surgery, then a pregnancy reset her hormones and she's been fine since) and in her experience the treatment offered was mostly pain management."
keto,3dxjrw,SionnachDearg,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for your friend, it seems quite severe, I seem to have had it a little easier (was never bedridden for more than a week).   As for treatments, I was on hormone meds for over a year, then I had to have a surgery (laproscopic) to remove cysts that had gotten too big. Afterwards I went on the same pill again for a while, then doc said we could try going without (that was around a year ago) and I haven't had any new cysts or new symptoms since :) But the weird thing is that unlike your friend, I was never on pain management meds, I was only allowed analgesics on my period, when it became untenable, but otherwise all I took was some vitamin D supplements.  Good luck with your ultrasound, I hope they find the cause of your symptoms, and if it is endo, I hope it's still in the beginning (so still manageable) :)"
keto,3dxjrw,Chocothundathighs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:54:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the reply. That's so helpful and promising to hear that you saw a difference on low carb/keto. I continue to look for things to try to help get her through the rough days.   I don't think she has as debilitating or severe diagnosis as you however. No hormone replacement therapy, no surgery. She's managing it all currently by staying on the pill, which works for her currently, but in some degree of pain most days.   We were going to give keto a try. Just thought it was exciting to see the two paths cross in a positive way. Thanks again for the reply."
keto,3dxjrw,randomizeitpls,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:23:04 2015 UTC,My absolute pleasure :) And I'm glad to know your wife is doing good! Good luck!
keto,3dxjrw,bobaimee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:39:17 2015 UTC,"Great advice, except that you should know to be careful of the kind and how much fruit you consume.  Also, your Doctor's comment about losing visceral fat is probably not very accurate.  Visceral fat is around your organs and underneath your stomach muscles.  Subcutaneous fat is on top of your stomach muscles.  If you are losing inches around your stomach first, that means you are probably losing both types of fat, most likely in a similar ratio.  Changing your diet to keto, increasing your exercise level, and perhaps raising the amount of coconut/MCT oil composition in your diet may tend to decrease visceral fat a bit more, however probably not as significantly as losing overall body fat does.  Sumo wrestlers reportedly have low visceral fat because of their activity, yet obviously high subcutaneous fat levels."
keto,3dxjrw,randomizeitpls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for the informative response!   A couple questions, if you have the time:   You mentioned types of fruits that are better than others. Right now (since I'm still early in the fat adaptation process), I'm not eating any fruits. But later on, when I'm adapted, I do intend to play aroud with fruits, see how my body reacts to some. I know the least sugary-ones are berries, and I've read some other fruits being low in sugar, but I had thought I'd just eat whatever my macros of the day allowed. But now with your comment, and having read the effect of fructose on the body (in another thread), I'm hesitating. What's your opinion about this? About the visceral fat, he said it after reading my weight loss numbers, that I've lost visceral fat, probably because I still have loads of subcutaneous fat (my form hasn't changed much) and yet I've lost a lot of weight. He asked me if I'm exercising (to make sure it wasn't muscle loss), which I do daily. So I think that's where he got it from. He also gave me an ultrasound, do you think he can see visceral fat deposits or something?"
keto,3dxjrw,bobaimee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:11:01 2015 UTC,"Dr. Atkins said no fruit for the first two weeks of the diet while keeping to 20g of carbohydrates.  Then, if people wished to increase their carb intake by 5g each week, he recommended adding more vegetables for the next two weeks.  To me, that seems that if you hold to no fruit for the first 30g of carbs in your diet, then any fruit intake needs to be really ""Nature's candy"" and you will have to limit it to 5g-15g per day if you are young and fairly active, or a bit more if you are very active (e.g. athlete.)  And yes, you can see visceral fat deposits with an ultrasound, and this is not a typical test for most general practitioners, so I would say that you indeed have a good Doctor.  Was this a GP or an OB/GYN?"
keto,3dxjrw,randomizeitpls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"OB/GYN, he specializes in endometriosis :) so maybe that was it, he could have noticed the difference in the ultrasound!   Thanks for the info about fruits, I have a better understanding of the re-introduction process later on, so thanks!"
keto,3dxjrw,nothingtoseehere28,3,Mon Jul 20 15:33:22 2015 UTC,"That is great, and even if your ""shape"" hasn't changed as much as you might like at first, losing visceral fat in favor of subcutaneous fat is really preferable and better for your health.  As you keep reading here, you will read about the ""paper towel roll"" effect, where you drop inches faster and faster as you lose more fat.  Keep at it!"

keto,3dxjrw,Treat_Choself,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:46 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Maybe it's got something to do with the fact that there seems to be more literature regarding the effect of keto on hormone management than regarding other areas?

keto,3dxjrw,randomizeitpls,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:00 2015 UTC,Yes I think it might have to do with the weight management/hormone interplay that is crucial in a lot of fertility/women's health issues.   I went in for an unrelated issue (UTI) and saw a new doctor at my gynecology clinic and she freaked out when she saw my urine sample ketone level. She was like ARE YOU EATING?

I'm not interested in eating low carb for life as I enjoy many things that the keto diet heavily restricts. I can definitely drop those things for a few months, but I'm not interested in doing keto permanently. After dropping the weight I want to drop,  I'd like to go back to my regular diet (while still eating under my TDEE, as I usually do now).  Now I wonder how much water weight I'd gain after stopping keto. Thanks for the info.  Edit: just realized what you meant by your sustainable comment. I have since edited my post. I meant to say that I enjoy foods keto restricts too much to drop them permanently.  Sorry for the shit wording."
keto,3e05ca,mjbendy,2,Mon Jul 20 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"Actually I read it incorrectly. Yea it depends on the person really on how much. Maybe shoot for a BF% instead of weight? If you're set on 170 maybe go a bit lower to account for water weight gain. Anyway, good luck!"

However that doesn't mean you can't do keto for life but NEVER have a slice of bread or pasta or cake ever again. If you can make adult decisions and come back to keto, you can still have those things... just not very often. That's how I plan to do this lifestyle. I understand that some people are extremely happy with staying strict keto their entire lives, but that's not realistic for me. What is also unrealistic for me is going straight back to my old diet when I hit my goal weight. There's a reason it didn't work for me the first time. My body hates it. So, sometimes I will have a slice or two of pizza. I just don't want to become someone who can't stop eating pizza.  So, you do you. It can be a lifestyle, or it can be a diet. You get to choose.

keto,3e05ca,Foamrrroller,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:52:10 2015 UTC,"By logic, you will gain back pounds if you resume the eating habits you had while gaining.

It doesn't have to be black or white. But balancing this is delicate and requires attention to details, IME.  Only way to find out for you, is to try.

If you are looking at the scale, put it away.  Your body holds water differently throughout the day and at times it can make you look like you are gaining.  But the true secret of this way of eating is that you are losing ""fat"" all around your body while the scale is saying that you are gaining.  You will have a ""swoosh"" soon.  Hang in there."

In less than a week I was getting coached online, for the price of what would have been 1 IRL lesson, by a PT who also happens to be a very competitive powerlifter- form checks, custom program design, frequent e-mail exchanges, etc. No brainer imo.  Before starting 5x5 take into account if you have any postural issues (rounded back) or relevant injuries. If either is true, then your program should probably be modified."

keto,3dzxu1,throwaway-5965566,3,Mon Jul 20 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"<50g/day of carbs is the stricter limit; 20-30g is the safer limit to set. The percentages are deceptive and more to give folks eating at maintenance a useful metric, b/c if you eat at a deficit and thus eat less fat (vs. the fairly constant baseline of moderate protein, low carbs), you're still using fat for energy (e.g. 70%), but it's body fat making up for the lack of dietary fat and inflating other percentages b/c the body fat percentage is 'hidden'."
keto,3dzxu1,ketosq,3,Mon Jul 20 22:17:56 2015 UTC,"No, it's a recommended limit to facilitate transitioning (cravings and hunger are usually more manageable with lower carb intake), guarantee ketosis and facilitate adaptation.

keto,3dzxu1,anbeav,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:03:41 2015 UTC,Ok! Thanks for clarifying! So the recommended 5% 30% 65% is just a guideline? The 5% can be reduced and made up in fat/ protein?

I was wondering if this is correct, should I be aiming for consuming 15-20 like everybody says? Or is it the assumption that people struggle to get down to that range which is why it's a guideline?  When I consume less carbs, the percentage of carbs is going to reflect as lower.  Edit: I may have failed to mention I have a calorie limit. So when i refer to percentage it's the ratio of each macro within the limit."
keto,3dzxu1,bidnow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:57 2015 UTC,"You're fine with under 10g, but that restricts your vegetables quite a bit.  I would worry about vitamin intake, but maybe there are suggestions for that.  I'm still fairly new to keto."

I just try hard to not over eat anything else, and am very selective with items I buy and consume - almost all 0g - 2g carbs.

keto,3e0lls,WillowWagner,3,Tue Jul 21 01:14:54 2015 UTC,I like that you are looking on the bright side of keto flu! Seriously though - get yourself some electrolytes pronto! (Not just salt!)
keto,3e0lls,P0PSTART,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, you need to get that extra 1-2g sodium through broth to get 3-5g/day total, and that'll likely resolve your issues, assuming you're getting ~2g potassium/day and ~350mg magnesium/day through food (maybe add just a pinch of No-Salt to the broth if the food's lacking in potassium). Lack of magnesium is associated with cramps, sodium with headaches. If after making sure you get the above you still experience cramps, try supplementing magnesium (e.g. mag chloride) for a while.  The only thing really keto specific, re: electrolyte issues, is sodium. It's the opposite for us ketoers than for carb eaters--they retain sodium and have to keep it lower, we excrete it and need to boost our intake. Low sodium causes potassium issues but otherwise the 'get adequate potassium and magnesium' is really a universal for any way of eating. It's just our sources tend to be different, re: the lack of fruit.  Fun fact about potassium: ""There’s as much potassium in 4 oz of meat as in a medium banana or 8 oz of orange juice."" (Volek and Phinney). The trick is that much of the potassium is in the broth/drippings from meat, so we want to keep those."

For example, 4 oz of chicken breast is 112 grams but not all of that weight is protein, it's ~ 25 grams protein, the rest of the weight of meat is composed of fat, water, and connective tissue.  So, 79 grams of protein would be ~ 12-13 oz of chicken breast (3/4 lb).

keto,3dyz59,YaHurd_Wurd,6,Mon Jul 20 17:55:16 2015 UTC,"Perspective is helpful. It's only in recent decades that the idea of eating fat is so fear- inducing. The current food situation is not the norm, it's the abnormal which has clouded everyone's perspective. My 86 year old grandmother completely understood keto, it's the way people used to eat, sure the table had some carbs (a small potato or 1/2 cup pasta, not a pile of grains and processed carbs), but a pork chop fried in butter was normal. Moreover no one bats an eye at a BLT on whole wheat bread but remove the bread and now it's an issue. I eat a ton of veggies, probably more than anyone I know. No one has ever looked at my meals and wondered if I'm on a special diet, it's just food, it looks like what my friends eat just minus the carbs. If you are afraid of fat, this isn't going to work so either read the evidence and convince yourself that fat isn't going to harm you or you're going to feel miserable.  Untrain your brain, read the evidence.  /r/ketoscience  The art and science of low carbohydrate living; Good calories, bad calories; The big fat surprise; Death by food pyramid  Or...  Look at the population, is it working? People are eating less meat, less cheese and less fat and sicker than ever. Apparently fat isn't so bad or at least not the cause of one of the biggest public health crises.   What were your results and how long did it take to achieve your GW?    Results vary as everyone is different - different amounts of weight to lose, some track calories and some don't, some exercise and others don't.  Most lose 1 to 2 lbs a week, with your stats 1 lb a week would be the upper limit expected loss but less than that would be a good pace as well."
keto,3dyz59,anbeav,4,Mon Jul 20 18:01:44 2015 UTC,"Hi, I hope this doesn't come across badly, but I'm inclined to guess, based on your stats, that you may be right that 116g fat a day seems a little high.   The general rule of thumb with the ketocalculator is to set it to Sedentary (it over-estimates calories burned from activity) and to set protein to .8g per lb of LBM.  Assuming you've done both of those things, 116g of fat would give you a daily caloric deficit of about 10% or 150 calories per day, which adds up to a loss of ~1.3 lbs per month (assuming you're tracking and weighing you food accurately (which is kind of impossible as rounding error always factors in and your metabolism may be slightly different that the calculator's estimates.))  To compound matters, I weigh about what you weigh and I still see 2-3 lb day to day weight fluxuations, which means any fat loss you accumulate at that 10% deficit may not even show up on the scale consistently until another 3-4 months from now of continuous keto.  As long as you know that and are prepared for it, I think a 10% deficit is healthy and sustainable, but people sometimes get discouraged seeing such slow losses. If you want to see slightly faster changes, maybe try for a 20% or 30% deficit for a little while and see how you feel?  :)"

Again carbs keep under 20 grams (15 is fine, that's what I hit most days, if you go over a little, don't stress it), protein is a minimal you have to hit otherwise you'll lose more muscle mass than you'll probably want, and fat is a max to keep full (also your primary energy source).

So don't expect to be 100% till then.  Also, aim for two cups, or rather, two bouillon cubes, assuming 1 cup broth and 1g sodium per cube. That is, ~2g, aiming for 3-5g/day total.  I thought I 'knew' keto over the years but it wasn't till I routinely began drinking a big soup mug of broth (~1.5-2g sodium in 12-14 oz water) that all these symptoms I thought were 'required' on keto began to resolve."

So think nutrient-rich, natural foods that help satisfy hunger for as long as possible, without excess kilojoules.  Eating as soon as you are hungry may not always be possible. This may be the case during long shifts at work, for instance, or through religious fasts such as Ramadan, or during weight-loss diets that involve severe energy restriction (such as intermittent fasting diets). All of these should only be done if your doctor has given you the all-clear.  In these cases, it can help to remember that, with time, your glucose counter-regulatory response will kick in and your blood-glucose levels will stabilise. Also, when you go without food, your body starts breaking down its own fat stores for energy, some of which are converted by your body into ketones, a product of fat metabolism.

keto,3dzdvl,Whoaaa3,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:05 2015 UTC,"Probably the most valuable information I learned when I started keto was about dietary cholesterol vs serum cholesterol and the reality of arterial plaque. Read as much as you can about it, it's probably the crux of keto. There are some good videos on YouTube.  For what it's worth, after 6 months of keto my blood numbers came back great. Triglycerides plummeted to 76, HDL went to 61 (60 and above is considered heart protective). I did the more advanced NMR lipid profile to get a better look at the LDL and it came back great; I have the good mix of LDL particles. Naturally the sugar numbers are better.  I went from being in the worst 30% for risk of insulin resistance to being in the best 30%. My risk profile for cardiovascular disease was turned upside down as well.  HOWEVER - I told my Dr. the same thing, ""low carb"" diet. He was fine with this, but after talking to him a few minutes I realized I would leave it at that. He was pleased with the blood work, but, sadly, I could tell he was pretty ignorant/rigid.  Inflammation - that's the boogyman to pursue. I had heard that word repeatedly without understanding what it really meant. Want to protect your heart? Learn about inflammation. Unfortunately I didn't learn about it until we discovered my thyroid was shot. Oh well, at least I wised up before I got diabetes on top of it. These can both often be thought of as autoimmune disorders, I learned. Arteriosclerosis may be also, in one way of looking at things. The great news is there is a way to halt the progress with dietary changes. Thank you reddit/r/keto!!!  edit: the best piece of advice I got at the very beginning was from /u/emjayt, who said, be sure to get enough fat.. It was then the lightbulb went off and I understood keto. Thank you /u/emjayt, if it weren't for you I would probably just be failing at a 'low carb diet'."

keto,3dzdvl,emjayt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:34 2015 UTC,"All good things to point out, thank you.  I have PCOS and found out I have hypothyroidism about 3 months ago.  I've been on medication since and I feel a lot better.  From what I understand the hypo isn't something that the weight can bring on anyway so I can't blame myself for that one, but the PCOS is just extremely annoying.  Both of those make you gain weight and harder to lose weight.  So annoying.  I'm trying my best to up the fat intake but I will say it's kind of hard to do that when your protein is capped and you can hardly have any carbs.  I've been trying to be under 20 g of carbs but I've been hovering around 30.  Maybe today is the day! Lol.  I read a bunch of people on here say that keto helps with inflammation? did i misunderstand..?  Thanks for your response btw, very thorough!"
keto,3dzdvl,parl,2,Mon Jul 20 23:46:03 2015 UTC,"As you lose weight, your fat cells will decrease in size (and some may even go away). But they release both fat and cholesterol as they have stored both. For technical reasons, the cholesterol they release is counted as LDL-C. Once your weight has stabilized, the LDL-C reading will be OK."
keto,3dzdvl,Faelostacia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:19:45 2015 UTC,Dietary cholesterol does not equal blood cholesterol. The two don't affect each other.  Cholesterol tends to improve drastically on keto for many people here. Do a blood test about a month in and you'll see what I mean.

keto,3e00is,Seantzizl,2,Mon Jul 20 23:35:14 2015 UTC,"In regards to the high sodium intakes, two things to know: first, unless you already have sodium-responsive hypertension, sodium won't cause any sort of problems. Your body is very good at eliminating excess. Secondly, you retain a lot less electrolytes when on keto, so you have to replenish."

Many have cravings that make it difficult to stick to keto, that doesn't mean they abandon it. The cravings often return in stressful situations like sickness when the primitive brain takes over, it doesn't mean you need these foods. Last I checked there's nothing in fruit required to heal, you get all the vitamins and nutrients needed to heal on keto, fruit not necessary.

It is your decision, and as simple as that."
keto,3e23en,HotSeamenGG,2,Tue Jul 21 14:22:53 2015 UTC,"Paleo is just as much work. You really gotta ask your self if you're willing to put in the work and if it's worth it for you. They don't allow sugary carbs either. If you have no real reason to pursue that path or keto, you're probably going to end up resorting back to your standard diet which gave you issues in the first place. Cravings go away for 2~3 weeks on keto. And you need to change your mindset. ""I can't"" is an excuse people give themselves when it's more convenient and easier than to actually try for something greater because its hard. Mindset is everything, whether it's in diet or working out or life in general. ""I can't find a better job"" ""I can't lose weight"". Stop opting out and take responsibility for yourself."
keto,3e23en,Wendyland78,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:47:00 2015 UTC,"I tried paleo many times before finding keto.  I still like the message, but I feel better when my carbs are lower.  I also like dairy.  I did like being able to eat sweet potatoes, but it didn't translate into weight loss for me.  All you can do is try it and see if you like it.    Or you can give yourself a short break from keto and ease back into it."
keto,3dz2ur,aj_ski,2,Mon Jul 20 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"The beauty of keto is that it's a framework which you use to then incorporate foods that you prefer so the answer to this question will depend for every person. Keep it simple - meat, seafood, low carb vegetables, eggs, avocado, cheese, cream, oils, butter, nuts   Plan your meals ahead of time until you get the hang of it. Sign up at myfitnesspal.com, weigh your food, search the database (for products with a label compare and double check the label, for products without a label use the USDA site to verify the information http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list), log it and then you'll learn about macros as you go.

keto,3dyt0c,JaysusMoon,19,Mon Jul 20 17:12:40 2015 UTC,"Find things to replace the carbs you do like instead of thinking of yourself as rid of them.  Keto isn't all ""baked chicken, bulletproof coffee, and broccoli and cheese"". The thing that makes keto so accessible is that it's easy, and that it's intuitive. Just limit your carbs.  Missing sugary soda? Pick up a coke zero.  Want some Haagen-Daas? Pick up a pint of Breyers CarbSmart.  Pancakes? 1 egg to 1 oz of cream cheese, blend with some stevia and cinnamon and pan-fry that shit.   Miss carby finger foods? Drop $8 on almond meal and zucchini, make zucchini fries.  But what about KFC? Roll some chicken around in that almond meal, deep-fry it.  Brownies? I've seen fucking keto lava cakes. Replacements exist. I promise.  Finding it hard to keep up with strict keto? Say fuck your macros, do lazy keto, and just eat below 25g carbs per day. Your weight loss might be slowed a tiny bit, but it's worth your happiness and contentment.  Carb binges are only fixed by assessing your happiness on keto and turning it from ""yeah, I'm doing this diet called keto"" to an actual sustainable lifestyle change. And that's what it needs to be, because guess what, if you're having carb binges, it means you're addicted to carbs. After keto, you probably won't be able to control yourself, so you might have to eat keto or at least on a low-carb diet for a long time unless at SOME POINT you actually think ""hey, I can have a sandwich with whole grain bread and not want to binge with 3 slices of carrot cake after"".  I'm not going to lie, the health market's expensive, and since we have this way of shoving money towards carby things as a society, low-carb alternatives are NOT cheap. And if you want to be 100% happy on keto with alternatives to EVERY carby thing you love, you'll spend a pretty penny. But it's up to you to assess the worth of spending time and money finding replacements to carby things you like, or developing some sort of self-control and self-discipline to just eat keto the cheap way with meat and eggs and cheese. I don't blame you at all because that's exactly what I have to do because before keto, my passion was baking and cooking and a good bread made my world go round.  I'm being hard on you because I can tell that it's what you need right now: someone to say you're being an idiot and to cut this shit, because you and I both know keto's fantastic and that you can ABSOLUTELY do it."

I'll guess that you have self control in other areas of your life, but carbs create a physiological response that is addictive and extremely difficult to break.  The only thing that helped me was to finally admit that I had no self control either, and then it just became a matter of fact that I could not eat those carbs.

The me that was alive a year ago is dead, I killed him with the bar.   Properly feeding the beast is only half the battle, you have to push it with weight for full potential."

I too was a H E A V Y nightly drinker; I quit for a little...slipped up for a weekend...quit for 55 days...slipped up for a night and now I am 72 days sober and think I have a pretty good handle on it. With that said, I have a very serious interest in Keto and the way it affects and involves the liver. I have read a lot about how beneficial it can be for a fatty liver but most resources only list Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease as the ailment it can help. I imagine that is because they assume Alcoholic Fatty Liver is not going to get better without stopping drinking? Anyway I am all too familiar with the withdrawal symptoms you refer to and can't imagine getting such a scary reminder of what they are like without even falling off the wagon.

keto,3dxoox,nutrop,8,Mon Jul 20 11:45:54 2015 UTC,"Uric acid is often elevated when starting keto. For some this even leads to acute arthritic inflammation (gout).  In these cases, often, the issue is not increased production of uric acid. It is a problem of decreased clearance.  Uric acid competes for clearance in the kidneys with many other metabolites, not least ketones themselves. The kidneys operate on the basis of they can only clear so much and concentrate the urine so much, they also have the job of keeping you hydrated.  An easy resolution is to drink a lot of water, lightly salted with lite-salt. It has potassium and sodium, essential for the kidney to work properly at keeping you hydrated. Drink this and ensure that your pee is colorless, or as near to colorless, if you have a gout attack. If you are asymptomatic staying well-hydrated and flush with essential electrolytes is a good idea anyway.  HTH  Edit:  I found the paper which describes this clearly, from 1970. In those days a ketogenic diet was not differentiated from ""starvation"", since in both cases ketone production is elevated, and in both cases fat metabolism and gluconeogenesis are elevated.  http://ard.bmj.com/content/29/5/553.full.pdf"
keto,3dxoox,simsalabimbam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:09:51 2015 UTC,A little more to add to this for people that want a way to treat gout easily is to also heat the effected area as the pain comes from the acid crystallizing in joints and the hot water turns it back into liquid in your system and with the help of the water as stated above your system can then remove it.

In addition to the weight and inches lost (since easter I've dropped from a size 16 to a size 10)  I have zero joint pain, I sleep now (chronic insomnia before), no hypoglycemic episodes, skin has cleared up, I have an exponentially less severe allergy issue, food tastes better, my lifting performance has easily increased 25% and I've shaved over a minute off my mile and have negative splits on 5 and 10k's.  Oh - and I don't want to shoot people during shark week (or shark 15month extended edition in my case)  My husband is having the same success.  Why would I want to return to not sleeping, having a face full of teenager acne, a husband back on BP and cholesterol meds and just an all around shitty existence? :) Not everyone has these results.  Not everyone had these issues prior to keto.  The question you need to ask yourself is:  Will I return to eating the way I was before keto?  Because if you are, you won't sustain the weight loss.  Its just a fact.  Its what got you there.  BUT!  You can always eat a modified diet - stay lower carb, watch your calories.  If you can do that, you'll maintain the weight loss and not feel like you're missing out on something.  Food is fuel - there's nothing wrong with enjoying your fuel.  I like to think my car is happy when I give it good gasoline :) That being said, going overboard really can cause mental and physical issues.  Just be mindful of that. There's no standard right or wrong answer - we are all individuals.  You have to choose what's right for you."
keto,3e0a9f,lecirca,2,Tue Jul 21 13:19:14 2015 UTC,Keto can be just a diet to lose weight but you just have to remember if you go back to your old way of eating you'll go back to your old weight.  What made you want to do keto vs reducing intake on the diet you want to eat?

keto,3dzdp7,anbeav,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"Ok.  These are first thoughts...  Have a big keto breakfast.  Meat, eggs, butter.  Carry some keto-friendly snack food with you.  Nuts, counted or measured in baggies (just because they're so easy to overdo.)  Hard boiled eggs.  Maybe some cold deli meat.  When you go to dinner, almost every place has some keto-friendly choices.  Grilled steak or chicken.  No potato, but maybe some extra green veggies with extra butter.  Burgers without the buns.  If anybody asks, just say you're watching your carbs; avoid the debates and the unsolicited advice.    By all means, give the electolytes a shot.  Try 1/4 tsp of lite salt in a glass of water, followed by another glass of water in a couple of minutes.  Sometimes I get a Powerade Zero and add the lite salt to that.

I would like to hear how do you manage to fit adequate fat into your diet, as all gastric bypass patients seem to develop intolerance for high fat, high protein foods.   Also, after the surgery, did you take any supplements? I was wondering if you had any complications from the diet, as the surgery makes it harder to obtain some nutrients, such as zinc, B12 etc.  Thank you so much!"
keto,3dz2b4,chocolate_on_toast,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"I haven't had any removal, only a band around my stomach to create a small 'pouch' at the top. Food has to pass through a very tiny hole to reach the rest of my stomach. If it's not small enough, the hole gets blocked and I'm forced to regurgitate.  I'm not sure if the situation is directly comparable or not.   Fibrous foods (fruit and veg) is hard for me to eat as they simply won't go down. Meat can be difficult too, as it can clump together and form blockages. This might be why it's hard to eat high-protein.  I believe the fat intolerance is due in part to less intestine, so less time for bile to break down the fatty acid chains? I've just spoken with a couple of friends who have had bypasses and they use the little-and-often method, nibbling throughout the day so that they absorb food slowly and don't overwhelm their stomach or intestines.   For anyone with bariatric surgery, you get used to soup. LOTS of soup. I make mine with veggies, and stock, blended into a thin broth (to get over the fibrous nature of veg), then add in some very finely-chopped or ground meat. If you want fat, add cheese or cream to the soup. And then: a little and often. I keep it in a thermos flask and sip throughout the day.   Supplements are always good. I had trouble with B12 and got very anaemic at one stage (not enough leafy greens). I also had quite a severe Vit D deficiency over the winter."

You catch the low-carb flu   The result: bad breath, dry mouth, tiredness, weakness, dizziness, insomnia, nausea, and brain fog. Basically, you feel like you have the flu. Eventually, your body adapts to running on ketones so you don’t feel so bad, but they are still aren’t your body’s preferred fuel source, says Spano.    It takes a few weeks to fully adapt but after that period there's no difference in mood or cognition (Brinkworth, 2009). The body doesn't have a ""preferred"" fuel source, it'll use whichever is most readily available for the cells. As an example if you inject ketones when there's plenty of glucose available the brain will reduce it's glucose use (animal study example: LaManna, 2009), if glucose was the preferred fuel why would the brain use ketones at all when glucose is available? The same is true for ketosis; your body maintains normal blood glucose levels so if glucose was the preferred fuel there would be no need for the brain to use ketones. Your cravings subside Ketosis also seems to have a unique appetite suppressing effect (Gibson, 2015). Your risk of heart disease and diabetes goes up--or down Studies show that virtually all health-related risk markers improve with low carb (Santos, 2012) and ketosis (Bueno, 2013). Your energy levels drop     Plus, since carbs are your body’s preferred fuel source, all of your cells slow down without a healthy supply, says Caspero.   As discussed above carbs aren't the only, or preferred, fuel. Studies show no difference in metabolic rate with low carb (longer post), likely because ketosis increases the ability to oxidize fat massively:  Figure 1   The most efficient approach to accelerate the body’s ability to oxidize fat is to lower dietary carbohydrate intake to a level that results in nutritional ketosis (i.e., circulating ketone levels >0.5 mmol/L) while increasing fat intake for a period of several weeks. The coordinated set of metabolic adaptations that ensures proper interorgan fuel supply in the face of low-carbohydrate availability is referred to as keto-adaptation.

You don't poop I'm not sure if the authors of the article realize that vegetables contain even more fiber than grains, and you can eat vegetables on keto.   Constipation is the one of the most common side effects in the maintenance phase. This can be managed by increasing the dietary fiber intake and by use of lactulose.    Sharma S, Jain P. ""The ketogenic diet and other dietary treatments for refractory epilepsy in children"" Ann Indian Acad Neurol. 2014 Jul;17(3):253-8. doi: 10.4103/0972-2327.138471. You get really moody     Carbs—whether they are whole or refined—increase the brain’s levels of the feel-good neurotransmitter serotonin, says Caspero. So when you cut healthy carbs like whole grains, your mental health goes right along with it.   Studies show that mood doesn't change, or improves, on keto (Brinkworth, 2009). Your workouts suffer If you do high intensity exercise this might be true, but you can to TKD or CKD to maintain muscle glycogen levels on keto (see /r/ketogains for info)."

The real desserts are always going to taste better than the keto-friendly (for the most part I would imagine) so the addiction is not really being treated on keto-friendly desserts - it's just being mitigated and put in waiting, if you will. So you are still a dessert-chaser and probably more like likely to fall off the wagon when you taste the real one. In fact, I have used the same strategy for all foods which are simply replacements for sugar/carb heavy foods and which mimick the taste, texture, and feel of sugar/carb heavy foods.  For the first time in my adult life - I have no food cravings of any kind, and I feel that this has been achieved by not chasing 'substitutes' and just eating real food. Of course, my n-1, but I am sure I am not the only one here who feels this way."

Hard boiled eggs are great to have for the week as well, and easy to do a large amount at a time.  On the weekend I like to grill so I'll do a whole bunch of extra kebabs with zucchini, eggplant, onions, mushrooms, chicken thighs etc and have those throughout the week.

I wasn't keto at the time, just calorie counting (but had been doing so successfully for over 18 months) and I found I couldn't get full and the little voice that would often talk me down when I was really craving foods I wanted but were very calorie dense was more or less gone.  I tried a different med and the appetite issues were gone (as well as other side effects), but the anxiety wasn't treated nearly as well.  Talked to my doctor, we went back to prozac (since it was working) and added Welbutrin to the mix. This has a few week period where it made my anxiety worse, but now my appetite is more normal (still higher than normal, but not insatiable).  I've also started keto (my partner was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, so making a family diet change to help with that) and that has helped a lot.

keto,3dyivs,Yaliejourney,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:35 2015 UTC,"Shorter feeding window, give your pancreas and tissues a break. However that being said, do what works for you, not everyone has such an insulin issue that they need to eat fewer meals   IF isn't overeating   Overeating as in excess calories above TDEE especially when high carb contributes to IR not just eating your calories in a shorter period of time which increases insulin sensitivity"
keto,3dyivs,anbeav,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:28 2015 UTC,Ahhh I got it lol. Personally I like to IF 16/8 everyday and 18/6 interspersed through the week.
keto,3dyivs,simsalabimbam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"Or is it better to portion out the days with small meals?    No, that is the wrong approach for better insulin sensitivity.  Every time you eat, insulin is released. Usually for healthy people this isn't a problem, it is what should happen.  However if you are insulin resistant, more and more insulin is produced to overcome the body ignoring it. As even more insulin is produced, the body just stops hearing its signal. Then diabetes begins.  To become insulin sensitive, we need to reduce the amount of insulin which is necessary to control blood sugar. One great way to do that is to have regular, long periods where no insulin is produced because nothing is being eaten.  If we do this often enough, the signal will get through better, and insulin becomes more effective. Meaning that less is needed. This is a healthy insulin response.  Having a healthy insulin (and glucagon, and leptin, and ghrelin, and peptide-yy, and IFG etc. etc.) response is at the heart of keto - and fasting. keto helps because carbs produce the biggest insulin rise - so we restrict carbs. IF helps because fasting provides the biggest drop in insulin - so many do some sort of fasting regimen.  Also fasting helps in many other ways, see: Intermittent Fasting 101 – The Ultimate Beginner’s Guide"

It has many benefits other than the weight control (better skin, better mood, more energy). It was relatively easy to go from 160 to 120 after my pregnancy but now I feel stuck. When I try to decrease my calories it causes me to crave carbs and then I end up binging in the middle of the night. This causes me to be thrown out of ketosis.

But it can be hard to tell since different ways of cooking may give you big differences in weight.   It would make more sense that the nutrition information is for the average of one piece (hence why they give you their portion size next to it) since it is a pre-printed package and doesn't look like they would be able to change it for every one made. I believe anything that has a portion size of X pieces, and not a specific amount like in tablespoons or oz, is the portion tested for the nutrition facts below and not the exact portion inside the container (since it would be hard to replicate the same weight every time for most things). Which is why they have to give you the weight.  Edit: Grammar and Formatting"

I've been basically feeding them very similar meals to what I've been eating with some additions. For example, last night I prepared flank steak rolled with spinach and cheese and Brussels sprouts. I gave them each a side of brown rice on their plates. We've been eating a lot of salads topped with chicken so I'll give them some extras that I skip out on such as fruit salad for a side. They're both physically fit and I don't want them to feel deprived because I'm trying to lose weight, but overall making healthier choices for everyone. Also, I can't afford to go shopping for them and buy completely different ingredients for myself. It's working out great so far!"
keto,3dv8ug,cammierochelle,13,Sun Jul 19 21:33:11 2015 UTC,"My kids are not keto but we try to reduce refined carbs.    The hardest thing has been getting the kids off sugar.  Instead of juice and pop, they have water, fizzy flavoured water, and iced herbal tea.  Fruity or peppermint tea has been popular.  I don't sweeten it.  They like it more when I serve it with plenty of ice.   Vegetables.  Also hard. I take care to make the vegetables extra tasty.  I let the kids pick their favourite vegetables at the grocery store.  I always have an assortment of cut up fresh veggies in the fridge in case they reject the dinner veggie.  I found Jack Bishop's Vegetables Every Day to be my most useful cookbook, though it is not keto/paleo, he has good ways to bring out the best flavour in each vegetable.    They still have potato (in limited amounts) and a little bread.  I just don't make it the focus of the meal.  Example: bacon and eggs for breakfast... Kids may have a slice of toast with that. Or steak, grilled vegetables, and some roast potatoes.   We have one of those rotisserie chickens at least once a week.  I make some gravy (just Bisto) and they seem to like that.  They are often happy with the same limited things over and over.  So what if it's chicken and salad again? Some kids eat Mac and cheese several times a week.  Typical meals:   oven baked chicken wings, salad, broccoli and cheese sauce.  Ribs, veggie tray, dip.  Stir fry with vegetables.  The change hasn't been all at once.  I don't push too hard and I try to listen to their preferences. At first I just concentrated on improving one meal a day. We didn't eat crap before but they needed time to adjust to the taste of good, real, unsweetened food.   Treats: homemade yogurt and fruit Popsicle (I use a little Splenda), fruit and whipped cream, avocado chocolate pudding."

They eat a lot of fruit, sometimes my husband makes them smoothies. Treats are raisins and nuts. They get homemade ice cream at my mothers house but otherwise we limit processed/sweet food. Both were/are breastfed well past 1 year and they did ""babyled weaning"" so they have never had purees or baby food. Just hand on food experimentation from the start.   We make it a huge point to never comment or reprimand them for food related issues. We dont tell them to finish their plate, nor do we encourage one food over another. If they finish all the fruit and dont touch anything else and ask for more fruit we just explain that what is on their plate is what they are getting (within reason..). If they are eating everything (or trying everything) and want more of something ill usually oblige. I trust them to eat what they need to be healthy and so far so good! I look at it like my job is to present them with the widest variety of healthy foods that I can.. they will take care of the rest."
keto,3dv8ug,poppyseeded,18,Mon Jul 20 01:10:18 2015 UTC,"I don't have children but if I did they would eat similarly to the way I was raised which is most similar to a Paleo approach with quality fat and protein and carbs from vegetables. They certainly would not eat a high carb diet, though I also wouldn't necessarily have them eat a keto-level carb diet, low to moderate carb diet from quality sources. If nothing else, kids have to stay out of the cycle meaning the SAD cycle that these days starts incredibly early and is quite difficult to get out of because it completely distorts your ability to learn hunger and satiety signals and thus limits the ability to learn healthy eating habits.  Do your kids a favor and teach them healthy eating habits that will last them a lifetime, including cooking skills.  My meals as a kid were similar to the meals I eat now - roasted chicken, taco salad, meat sauce with zucchini noodles, seared salmon and spinach, steak and asparagus, deli meat and cheese roll ups, avocado egg boats, scrambled eggs, omelet, quiche, frittata, tuna salad wraps, stir fry, meat and veggie kebabs, pot roast, chili"

I'm not from the US so the products I feed him contain far less sugar, but I do feed him peanut butter, strawberry confiture, chocolate sprinkles, apple syrup alongside slices of meat and cheese.  I have keto breakfasts, usually omelets or keto pancakes. When he ever wants them, I'll gladly cook him the same :) But he's in the phase where he doesn't want to eat anything eggy and well, I'm not forcing him.

Weight loss = calories >>> macros >> timing  The issue with many on SAD is that IF is a disaster, when your body depends on you supplying its fuel, IF does not work very well which is why people need to eat every few hours.  In fact I was just listening to a podcast with a few functional medicine physicians with experience in this area and they say they specifically do not recommend it for people who are eating high carb diet especially if insulin resistant as they are more dependent on constantly feeding the system for it to work well and suffer more from the overeating issues of limited intake throughout the day   I do IF because it's my natural preference, I'm not hungry and always satiated so it's just easier to eat once a day. For others they do IF because counterintuitively, eating less often and eating more in one sitting allows you to feel more satiated and less hungry and thus you maintain a deficit more easily.  People seem to overthink IF, do it if your body naturally leads you there but in general other than assisting people maintain a deficit, the benefits are marginal when speaking simply of weight loss."

keto,3dysyp,ketosq,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"From what I've read of the benefits of IF, there are many that aren't touted as benefits of nutritional ketosis (maybe not though, I haven't done a direct itemized comparison); if nothing else you can think of the similarities/differences as complementary or synergistic. I think the best way fasting on keto works is a practical reason: since you've already gone through the carb detox/keto flu process which includes burning a bit of muscle through gluconeogenesis, you don't have to worry about that when starting a fast on ketosis.  So for example, any time I want, I find it very easy to do days/week(s)-long water fasting, since I'm already in a fat-burning, low appetite state which has already caused me to just eat once a day every day."

I had my first issue with keto flu after 10 years in ketosis"
keto,3dys6f,anbeav,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:37 2015 UTC,"My impression is that 'keto flu' generally refers to the transition process from carbs to ketones as fuel; but yes, you need to monitor your sodium to ensure you get ~5g/day, because losing the carbs has what's called a 'natriuretic' effect where you lose salt through the urine: this in turn causes various symptoms and potassium issues. Once you've got sodium on track, typically through 1-2g sodium in broth/bouillon, getting adequate potassium and magnesium through food is easy enough (~1-2g/day and ~300-400mg/day respectively). People who eat carbs also have to monitor sodium to make sure they don't get too much, since carbs force the kidneys to retain sodium, making them less efficient at eliminating fluids and such.  As for the cramps, this isn't necessarily keto related, though when making a big change it's always tempting to associate problems with that change. Could be that you're eating something with sugar alcohol or inulin or polydextrose, etc. that you're having issues with, perhaps having started eating a lot of new relatively unfamiliar low carb foods.   We process fat really well, especially when it's our primary source of energy, but specifically it needs to be SFA/MUFA rather than PUFA, that is, saturated/monounsaturated rather than polyunsaturated. PUFA can be harder to digest, our bodies want to burn sfa/mufa, reflecting our body fat composition. So for instance, if you buy mayo or dressing, most likely you'll have to choose vs. soybean or canola-based: get the canola as it's higher in MUFA (canola is controversial, so some prefer to make their own or hunt down avocado oil-based mayo; there are dressings made with high oleic sunflower, too, which is acceptable); likewise olive oil is great; you can find profiles of oils online. Even with pecans vs. walnuts, pecans are better (higher in mufa, unlike walnuts). Chapter 8 of Volek and Phinney's second book has more info on ideal fat sources."

keto,3dw4jg,Fuhrer_Of_Flapjacks,8,Mon Jul 20 00:54:13 2015 UTC,"Check out Stronglifts 5x5.  I've been doing this for a while now and can happily recommend it. Here's why I like it so much:  First, it works.   Second, it focuses on compound lifts - lifts that work multiple muscle groups at once. For me, these feel more ""real life"", like proper work. You can selectively add specific isolated lifts to work parts of your body.  Third, it uses minimal equipment - a bar and plates, a bench, and either a frame or chin-up bar. I don't have a lot of space at home, but I fit all this in a really small area. That way I don't need to go to a gym and can work out when it suits me.  Fourth, making progress each week is great for my confidence.  Finally, the time commitment is very reasonable: three days a week, two or three exercises per day, total lifting time per week is about 15-minutes, and at this time I'd redirect you back to my first point. The programme has you only do each exercise once a week, so you really get stuck in.  On my non-lifting days I ride my bike, swim and run. A lot of folks say the cardio kills the strength gains, but I don't see it because I'm more focussed on feeling amazing, and a big part of that (for me) is the enjoyment I get out of triathlon.  Start with the lifting, and selectively add your cardio in only as and when your body feels good and your nutrition keeps you fuelled. It's an ongoing process and it will take months and months, and years and years if you're lucky..."

keto,3dw4jg,Distle,2,Mon Jul 20 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"I'd also add that Stronglifts starts you out at very low weights, so you're a lot less likely to hurt yourself, you'll perfect your form on each of the exercises, and you'll be less likely to quit early on in the program.  That being said, Stronglifts also progresses fairly quickly, so if you feel that the weight is too light, it should only be a few weeks until it's where you want it to be. It really is a terrific program to build strength quickly and easily (relatively speaking, of course).  Edit: I saw in one of your comments below that your gym provides you one free session with a trainer. If you do decide to go with Stronglifts, a great way to use this session would be to have the trainer check and correct your form on each of the five exercises involved in the program. That'll get you off to a great start. Best of luck, OP."
keto,3dw4jg,HotSeamenGG,2,Mon Jul 20 03:04:16 2015 UTC,"By the way  I highly recommend starting w/ lower weights (just the bar) to warm up before you hit your ""working weight"" for the 5x5. I typically do 2~3 sets of 5 reps at approx 10~20% of my max weight before I do my max. Also look up Allan Thrall on Youtube to make sure you get those forms down. I feel he has the best tutorials on the proper benchpress/OHP/Deadlifts etc. Also TRACK TRACK TRACK! It's kinda like keto. Track the weight gains. It's a huge motivator."

There are also YouTube videos by the author that have been one of maybe 3 videos that have actually made a real impact on my life.  There ends up being lots of information out there that is on a much more shallow and arbitrary level, and because of that it is difficult to sort out because you aren't getting to the fundamental principles.  The short version of those principles is that working your muscles to muscle failure works exhausts your multiple muscle fiber types as much as possible.  This can be done quickly and simply, although it isn't always comfortable.  Your muscles healing after the fact builds them up as well as making your body recharge them with glycogen.    Keto and high intensity exercise are very potent together. 'Cardio' workouts dont give the same benefits for the effort you have to put forth since you can exhaust your muscles in a half hour and be out of breath for the next two hours and sucking up stored energy for the next couple of days."

Protein can be inexpensive, no one says you need to eat Wagyu beef, the absolute cheapest cuts of beef, lamb or pork include lots of bones and fat - excellent for keto.

keto,3dxm3s,bidnow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:32:18 2015 UTC,"If you are trying to eat less than 20g of carbs a day, all of your meals are ""really low carb.""  Even if you ate all of your protein and carbs at one meal, it is generally not an issue.  These feelings reported are primarily from lack of electrolytes.  ALL food signals an insulin response.  Even thinking about food can signal an insulin response.  If you eat a meal of 30g of protein in meat, that also contains fat and takes a while to digest, so your insulin will be elevated for a longer period of time.  Whey protein shakes do not generally have that fat and are much more quickly digested, so your insulin level might get higher but for a shorter amount of time.  If you are trying to lose weight and keep your calorie intake below your TDEE, any extra insulin spike from whey shakes is not significant.  If you are trying to build muscle and eating at a slight surplus on keto, the insulin spike is actually beneficial."

Others in this thread have pointed out /r/vegetarianketo, but I would say that is not really necessary for your situation. Just eat normal keto but don't choose options that contain red meat.

keto,3dw8d5,markedr3d,3,Mon Jul 20 02:41:44 2015 UTC,I generally see it suggested to not exceed a 30% deficit. Eating under 20 g of carbs will guarantee you are in Ketosis but some people can consume more and remain in Ketosis and others cannot. I don't believe there is a way to know which category you are in until you try. This is why I stay under 20 g of carbs daily. /r/ketogains has a lot of info on muscle gain.

I'd be overjoyed if that info was wrong.... since I do already have no enamel on my teeth thanks to my lifelong weird affinity for lemons and limes.  Having to use much less than I normally do for my unsweetened iced tea has been making me nuts.

keto,3dwwan,lumpy_frieda,3,Mon Jul 20 05:15:30 2015 UTC,"Welcome back!  You know, it's not just a matter of character and willpower.  When you eat sugar (any carbs, really) you produce a lot of insulin in order to handle it.  Once you're insulin resistant (as many seriously overweight people are) you produce so much insulin that it drives your blood sugar down through the basement and further...and then, because your blood sugar has been driven so low, your body starts screaming at you that you need more sugar and you need it NOW!  Once you get into ketosis, you don't need to keep your blood glucose levels up because you're burning ketones instead of glucose.  There's some insulin involved, but not the massive highs and lows of a high sugar diet.  Even if you're in ketosis, though, if you have a brownie, or an ice cream, you'll still produce a surge of insulin, and that'll still drive your blood glucose really low and your brain will go into a panic and start telling you that you ""might as well have pizza for lunch.""  If I eat something really carby, I'll spend hours, maybe days, being miserable while I'm trying to beat back those cravings.  That's why I don't ""cheat"".  Keto is just the way I eat now, because it's the only way I can eat and feel really good.  A brownie might taste good, but the price is just too high.  I know you already know all this.  I'm just saying that it's biology, not a character flaw, and that yes, one bite will hurt, and also that you're not alone.  You're right; you can do it."

keto,3du1a4,hailnobra,3,Sun Jul 19 19:45:04 2015 UTC,"I noticed mine was falling out around may and it just now within the last two or three weeks stopped being a concern. my hair is very thin to begin with, so I was really concerned, but everything seems to be okay now. the only thing I did was start taking biotin, but I'm not sure how much help it did since I hear that takes a while to get into your system anyway. no bald spots or anything like that"
keto,3du1a4,MILeft,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"Echoing what others have said, see a doctor. My wife had a similar issue about 3 months in, and we had to go through multiple appointments to figure it out. It turned out to be a fungal infection and a topical treatment fixed it. With that said, they checked for everything else before landing on that (even lupus... It's never lupus!). Don't always assume diet, only your doc will be able to eliminate other causes."
keto,3du1a4,Treat_Choself,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:49:32 2015 UTC,Did she go to a Dermo for help?? What test did they run to figure it was fungal.. And did she have any other symptoms?? Thank you!! I'm glad she figured it out.. Did her hair come back?
keto,3du1a4,Quorum_Sensing,2,Sun Jul 19 18:39:36 2015 UTC,"Yup, dermo couldn't figure it out after a ton of testing.  The fungal was kinda a last ditch effort after they had eliminated just about everything else.  The doc prescribed the topical shampoo as a ""well, nothing else has worked"" solution.  By that point, the hair was coming out in clumps (bad stuff).  The topical took about 2 weeks to show results, but it did the trick.  Her hair grew back over the next few months and is nice and full once more.    EDIT: I just sat down with my wife and asked her about it.  Your symptoms sound eerily similar to her experience.  If you want to ask your dermatologist about it she was prescribed salicylic acid 6% shampoo for the issue which is what did the trick She has been on it about 6 months now, and the doc wants her on it at least a year before talking about taking her off the regimen."
keto,3du1a4,hkaiser350,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:42:57 2015 UTC,"As a person who has had various thyroid issues over the years, I would try the simplest method to treat the hair problem--take Biotin. It's cheap and has no side effects. I actually do know someone with lupus who takes it successfully.  If you still have a problem in three months, see your doctor."

keto,3du1a4,octagonally,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"Just FYI, if you didn't already know, but biotin causes skin breakouts for a lot of people. I take 5000 mcg a day, but worked myself up to that really, really slowly = over the course of about four months.   I initially took the 5000 mcg right away, and after about three weeks my skin was an utter mess."
keto,3du1a4,billsil,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:57:11 2015 UTC,I would try the simplest method to treat the hair problem--take Biotin.   Your body makes it and the eggs most people on Keto take in in large quantities also contain it. The odds of being Biotin deficient are very low. It's time for a doctor.

keto,3du1a4,firetender,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:30:32 2015 UTC,"Lack of iron and biotin can also contribute to hair loss (eat your eggs & liver).  Gelatin also supposedly helps.  I have alopecia universalis (no hair on my body).  It's random.  I was totally bald for 10 years; totally smooth.  I regrew 1/3 of my hair for 6 months when I switched to paleo, and it re-fell out and I was bald for the next 2.5 years while doing the same diet.  It decided to grow again recently, so I have a few 2 mm long hairs on my head, one 2"" hair, a few 1/2"" long ones on my face and all of them are colorless.  Your attitude and mood are hugely important.  If you hate your job/life/work, your hair can fall out, but if you like it, it can regrow.  I recommend coffee.  It makes you feel good and makes a job/whatever that you dislike less stressful."

keto,3dwzrd,blacktangled,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:08:38 2015 UTC,"The way I first started was to start day 1 with a massive shopping trip. I went to the local supermarkets and looked down every aisle I normally frequent and read the labels of all my favourite foods with Keto in mind. I came up with a top list of my favourite foods with low to no carbs and that became my first week's worth of groceries. This included cream cheeses, salami, whipped cream, twiggy sticks, bacon, eggs and sausage.  It helps to start from a comfortable place of foods you already recognise. I started at 50g/day too, so it made the transition much easier. I also used to hit up Mcdonalds etc more frequently, requesting their burgers without buns - turns out not having a bun barely changes the taste of most of my favourite fast food options.  From there it's all a journey of discovery - new keto foods, recipes, swap-outs/alternatives, etc. Nowadays I have no trouble keeping well under 20g/day and only ever eat food I like - I've been working on getting more greens into my diet too, and it isn't hard once you start lathering them in butter or low-carb sauces."

It was a good run down and helped me know how to go about it.  Get myfitnesspal or equivalent and log food BEFORE you eat it. It is a surprise the amount of carbs in things that I wouldn't have considered. Clear out your pantry of food you don't need now. I gave some to family, but you can donate it to a local op shop or something. Get it out of the pantry and fridge, much easier to plan if it's not staring at you.  Keep posting, we are all keen to know how you go!"

keto,3drqb8,Corund,6,Sun Jul 19 00:07:22 2015 UTC,I eat two eggs with salsa and sour cream as soon as I wake up. Between noon and 2 I'll eat a low carb high fat meal. The most common meal is Five Guys double bacon cheese burger as a no-bun salad bowl. Or I'll do a chef salad or sub as a lettuce wrap. And that's all the calories for the rest of the day.   I do allow myself empty calories if I want (straight liquor) just because I have found no correlation to it and weight loss... And it takes my mind off wanting dinner.   I average around 1 pound a day when I'm being strict and having nothing after 2 pm

The main advice I can give is to think of high carb foods (sugar, bread, pasta, dough, etc.) like poison. I don't crave pizza because it's not something I would consider eating. It's not an option.   If you stick with it I promise you'll see results, and you'll be so happy you did it. Also, limit when you eat. Try not to eat anything after 5 if possible.

keto,3dv1e3,anbeav,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:26:53 2015 UTC,"I would suggest making a chart (like in Excel).  Write down a vertical list of all the common foods you eat or would like to eat.  In the next column, mark an X next to all of these foods you can't eat if you want to do a Keto diet.  Then make a third column and mark an X next to all the foods you can't eat because you're a T2 diabetic.  After that, you'll have a more complete picture of which foods you can eat based on which ones do not have an X next to their name.  It might help your situation to be less overwhelming.    If there's not much on the list, over time you can grow it and, although it will take time, eating the remaining foods will eventually become habit."
keto,3dv1e3,regents,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:28:45 2015 UTC,"Prediabetic, I've been through this. I think it is kind of common actually for people going keto to run into some histamine intolerance issues. The good news is that histamine intolerance can vary so much, from crippling to none-- if you are say overwhelmed by seasonal allergies, you will want to eat super clean from high histamine foods or else pay whatever price... but if you aren't under any kind of allergy/environmental stress you might be able to chow down on aged parmesan and red wine to the fullest limits of your carb allotment with no trouble. Over time I got a real feel for noticing how much stress my immune system was already under so now it's intuitive. There is more to the story with a few of the banned items on your list... I can tolerate fresh cheeses and feta, hard liquor, and chocolate even at my worst. At a sort of middle level of allergy stress I can handle cheddar, but fish is super risky. Etc."

keto,3dv1e3,lecirca,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:53 2015 UTC,"Zero carb, if my understanding is correct, isn't an option:   This forum wasn’t about finding low-carb and sugar-free recipes,  as was the case with most low-carb websites. These people simply ate from the animal kingdom.  Meat, eggs, and dairy.    These are all off the table with a low histamine diet. Well, meat if you just carved it off the animal is OK. Egg yolks are OK. Milk and cream are OK. But not much else.   In a keto group I'm surprised zero carb was the solution, it doesn't mention fat.  And the idea of adding things back is itself problematic. Add what? The intersection of low carb and anti histamine is depressingly small."
keto,3du8ud,canalto,7,Sun Jul 19 15:05:13 2015 UTC,Symptomatic hypoglycemia on keto especially after a long time on keto is rare if unheard of.

keto,3du8ud,anbeav,5,Sun Jul 19 15:12:54 2015 UTC,Better called glucose sparing effect in the sense that your body is running on fat and ketones so glucose is spared for the tissues that need as manifested by elevated fasting glucose. This effect is completely reversible if you resume eating more than 100 g carbs for 3 days thus it's not pathological as in bad but a physiological effect of ketosis

That's what the explanation is...your body is sparing glucose for cells that need it thus your fasting glucose can be elevated as other tissues are not taking up the glucose, however your A1c and post prandial glucose are normal. In diabetes neither is normal."
keto,3du8ud,helloimwilliamholden,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:54:53 2015 UTC,"The bit about your body sparing glucose: your body does this by making certain tissues selectively resist taking up glucose. Insulin carries glucose into your tissues, therefore, those tissues are insulin resistant, on purpose. If you provide your body with glucose, and the signaling pathways for glucose metabolism return to normal, then those tissues immediately cease to be insulin resistant. It's all safe and good and the way your body is supposed to behave."

A deficit makes it more of a problem but it is an issue even on maintenance calories.  Right now I treat it by eating at keto maintenance or even keto calorie surplus and carbing up every so often, but am looking for other solutions so I can stay on a weight loss track and because the carbups mess with my good habits and my head. My stats are very close to yours, though I powerlift and am currently parked at a higher weight than you are now.

I once had a therapist say that she thought my hypochondria had its roots in the fact that I didn't take care of myself. There's more to it than that, but it did turn out to be true that the more I take care of myself, the less worried I get about my health. No need to feel shame or fear. Every day is a new day.

Going for walks?  Getting any sunshine?  Meditate?  (That's nothing to do with keto, just asking about stress relief methods.)  What are your current macros?  If you're eating 1360 calories a day, you need to eat more. How much protein are you getting?  I suspect it's a combination of too much stress and not enough food, especially protein.  I could be wrong, though.  Post your macros and see what some of the medical professionals here think.  In the meantime, keto flu can happen at any time.  I know you're paying some attention to your electrolytes, but are you actually tracking them?  That would be a really good idea."

In terms of stress-relief, I don't metabolize sunlight properly—I shit you not—so that's not going to get me far, but I have been walking the mile and a half or so to work and back before the sun gets too high and after it starts creeping down again. More mindful mediation might be on the agenda; currently, my idea of meditating is 'listening to music instead of reading for courses.'  My macros are, for a mostly sedentary person of 5'8"" and 155: 1,345 kcal; 20g carb; 100g protein; 96g fat. The protein macro is the one that I'm most mindful of (after carbs, of course), and I do well to always either hit 100 or fall within the 66-108g recommended by the calculator. I'm tracking sodium and potassium and eyeballing magnesium, which I don't think MFP tracks.   I guess this also goes to show that there's always more to learn: I've always associated keto flu with the first days or weeks of adaptation to a ketogenic diet. I'll be bearing it more in mind. That said, I'm not sure that the level of vomitty I was last night can be chalked up to keto flu."

Try eating at maintenance for a while, till you get your stress under control, then try a 20% deficit.  Vomiting doesn't sound like a keto issue, but it can certainly be a stress issue.  As long as you're waiting to get in to see the doctor, try eating more, eating healthier, and working on your stress levels.

I have a hypothesis about this phenomenon. I think the effect can be explained in terms of undiagnosed fatty liver. The average overweight.person starting keto will see an initial fall in triglycerides and transient rise in ldl-c. This because the liver is now dumping stored fat.  Once the stored liver fat has been lost ldl-c returns to normal ranges.

keto,3dv2ku,anbeav,3,Sun Jul 19 19:30:02 2015 UTC,"I agree.  However, if artificial sweeteners cause insulin secretion, which some studies have suggested, then they could reduce the benefit of ketosis, since reduced insulin is one of the key reasons that ketosis is good for you.  There has been so little good nutritional science done on people in ketosis that I doubt there is good science to clarify what's happening for people in ketosis who respond poorly to artificial sweeteners.  (Reminder: I am agreeing with anbeav here that you'd still be in ketosis, even if the benefit is reduced.)"
keto,3dv2ku,Ohthere530,2,Sun Jul 19 20:04:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the issue, it's not that it kick anyone out of ketosis but the effect of the insulin response affects some people, distinct difference that people seem to miss when discussing this.

Everyone is in less than 20 net grams, out if over 100 net grams, between the limits it varies. Avoid ketosis anxiety, if you take a bite if chocolate before you remember just move on but need to think before you eat.   Log your food, it removes any guessing. Keep it simple, meat, seafood, eggs, avocado, oils, butter, cream, cheese, low carb veggies"

keto,3dxkge,anbeav,-2,Mon Jul 20 11:14:09 2015 UTC,I've been keto for ~2 years now and I don't get knocked out of ketosis at the drop of a hat like that. I have a banana (and sometimes an apple) with my breakfast smoothie multiple times a week and my ketone levels are essentially unaffected.
keto,3dxkge,reggae_muffin,4,Mon Jul 20 12:59:15 2015 UTC,"If you eat over 100 g of carbs you are out of ketosis, when OP describes ""not being able to control myself around his popcorn"" my assumption was that he exceeded 100 g of carbs  I've been on keto for over a decade, and if I or anyone else eats over 100 g of carbs then I'm out of ketosis   Are you actually testing ketone levels?"
keto,3dxkge,anbeav,-2,Mon Jul 20 13:25:57 2015 UTC,"I measure my levels, not daily anymore because I don't need stick myself every day. To get over 100g net carbs in popcorn you'd have to eat a mighty lot of it, because of how light it is 100g of popcorn (just using a standard serving size) is quite a lot, with a decent amount of fiber. I'm not saying its not possible, I'm sure there are people who have eaten 300g+ of carbs in a day before, I'm just saying that its a blanket statement regarding ketone levels - everyone is different. Maybe OP didn't get knocked out of ketosis, so for you to tell them to ""take off their cape"" is pretty assumptive."
keto,3dxkge,reggae_muffin,4,Mon Jul 20 13:36:00 2015 UTC,"""I ate a bucket of popcorn."" I'm not sure if you've seen what buckets of popcorn look like recently.  My blanket statement implied OP ate over 100 g carbs so it applies, if it was less than 100 g carbs then it does not apply but when someone says they ate a bucket of popcorn a safe assumption is that it was over 100 g carbs"
keto,3dxkge,anbeav,-2,Mon Jul 20 13:42:23 2015 UTC,"No, I suppose I'm not currently up to date on popcorn bucket sizes. OP also suggests in the post that they 'shared' a bucket with their dad so who knows; point is, safe assumption or not, no one would know unless everything was weighed and measured and if OP is still in ketosis with no other side effects (don't know if they measured levels or not, but since OP states they were still in ketosis I should tend to think they did) then your statement does not apply."
keto,3dxkge,reggae_muffin,4,Mon Jul 20 13:46:41 2015 UTC,"I think the point was clear.  OP assumed he was still in ketosis because he didn't have side effects of being out of ketosis, not exactly the best way to measure ketosis, moreover the way in which OP wrote the post is quite problematic - lack of self control and then a feeling of ""cheating the system.""

keto,3dxkge,reggae_muffin,3,Mon Jul 20 13:16:40 2015 UTC,"The assumption was that this person ate a lot of of popcorn, it's easy to reach 100 g of carbs when eating popcorn so it's not ridiculous.  OP described ""I ate a bucket of popcorn."""
keto,3dxkge,anbeav,2,Mon Jul 20 13:26:26 2015 UTC,"they didn't say some popcorn, they said a BUCKET. A medium bucket is about 65-75 net carbs.  There's no telling if this knocked them out of ketosis or not. Regardless, I think the control issue and attempted justification of being out of control but possibly maintaining ketosis is the OP's bigger issue to deal with."
keto,3dxkge,lecirca,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:38:28 2015 UTC,"Right, and we have no information on the size of the bucket, but that OP shared it with another individual. But you're right, its more about control than being knocked out of ketosis - that much is easy enough to remedy."
keto,3dxkge,reggae_muffin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:40:49 2015 UTC,"It does entirely depend on how much popcorn was eaten. OP makes it sound like it was a lot, and I think it is a reasonable assumption that he was knocked out of ketosis.   OTOH, being knocked out of ketosis isn't a big deal. You can jump right back in within a day, and not notice any symptoms. Its important to correct the idea that you can consistently eat 50g+ of carbs, though. Just because it was okay this one time, doesn't mean its okay to do often. Not if your goal is fat-adapted keto."

After that, many younger, active adults can remain in ketosis at around 50g of carbs, and athletes in training may actually be able to handle 100g per day.  Obese people with ""metabolic damage"" tend to find that their own ""critical carbohydrate"" intake level is probably more like 35g.  I have tested myself, and am pretty sure that 45g a day is probably still a bit too high for me at my weight and activity level."
keto,3dxkge,bidnow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:48 2015 UTC,Would eating 30g of carbs kick you out? Separate question from the popcorn.
keto,3dxkge,ReddRoverXX,2,Mon Jul 20 11:35:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but probably not. 20g is a safe figure for just about everyone. How many carbs you can consume while still working on a ketogenic metabolism varies person to person. If you stick to <20, you're almost certainly in ketosis which is why that number is generally recommended here."
keto,3dxkge,wulixue,2,Mon Jul 20 11:42:01 2015 UTC,"For nearly all, no. Between 20 to 100 g, everyone makes some ketones, the question is of consistent ketosis and that limit varies"

I'm really close to Onederland (207) and don't want to screw it up now. The last couple of weeks I've had more ""low carb"" sugar alcohol and noticed that I've stalled a bit.

keto,3dxkge,ReddRoverXX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:02 2015 UTC,"Your brain and central nervous system requires about 35g of glucose a day after keto-adaptation.  I believe that determines the tipping point for many, and over-consumption of protein comes into the mix as well.  If you are eating at a deficit with protein at 0.8g/LBM pound and you do not have a completely messed up metabolism, you should be able to increase your carb intake to 25g, 30g, and probably even 35g with little problem.  Then it just gets more interesting, as too much carbs or protein, or too many fat calories, or not enough exercise, or eating just one trigger food seems to be able to stop your fat loss and stick you at a weight plateau.  Good luck."

keto,3dv4du,Addbutter,2,Mon Jul 20 02:49:37 2015 UTC,"Some simple math shows that this label is all screwed up.  Notice that the ""total carbohydrate"" line (2.6g) is lower than the ""sugar"" line. This is impossible because ""sugar"" is supposed to be part of the total carbohydrate.  Notice that ""calories from fat"" is 175, but if you calculate the fat calories based on ""total fat"" (6g), you get 54 calories instead of 175 (9 calories per gram of fat).  In other words, it's not clear why one would trust anything that this label says."

keto,3dv4du,betterthansoda,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks, everyone.  I didn't think the label added up or made sense since wheat was the first ingredient, but wanted to check and make sure I wasn't just missing something - I typically expect these things to be accurate (I mean, really.  Is that too much to ask for?), especially for reasonably large companies such as this one.  That's why I was so surprised and figured checking in might be useful."

If you know, based on research, science and experience, that your way of eating is healthy and what's best for you then you don't deviate from it regardless of what an SO or family says.  Easier said than done but in the end you gotta do what you gotta do."
keto,3dudga,cero,2,Sun Jul 19 16:00:44 2015 UTC,"My family doesn't get it. I've had many conversations with my insulin pump diabetic father about how he doesn't understand why I can't just eat carbs like a normal person. Honestly, because I was going to be him and I didn't want that, but I don't just say that. I let it go, because I know he's not trying to understand. He can't quit carbs on a psychological level. He's seeing me do something that could greatly improve his own life and he doesn't want to have to do what I do. And that's fine.  Most people will come around. They see it's working for you. They see you losing weight. They see how much energy you have. They see how much healthier you are. And they accept that you know what's best for you - even if they don't understand exactly how it works. If they don't, if they continually hassle you when your success is quite visible, I'd personally question my need for them in my life."
keto,3dudga,PCBreakdown,2,Sun Jul 19 17:00:44 2015 UTC,I appreciate that response. Diabetes runs in my family and so does being grossly overweight. I just don't want to do that.

When I say supportive, I mean stuff like he looks for low carb sauces when he's grilling for Food or asks my preferences. He eats pizza, candy, drinks beer, etc., which doesn't bother me. I have bigger trouble with my kids getting offended when I say no thanks at their attempt to share candy with me.

Before I started, I lurked a lot and read a lot. I told SO that I've been reading up about it, and exposed my arguments and point of view. SO was skeptical but overall supportive, here's why:  I made sure to make her understand that I get it that it's weird for her, I know it's tough to disregard everything you thought you knew about eating, I know it seems counter-intuitive to eat so much of the once-forbidden foods, and I know that her fears for my health are legit and coming from the most loving place. I said that there was 0 pressure on her to start with me or to even agree with me, but that I was convinced by both the literature and the experiences, and that I might be wrong about this but I'm convinced enough to try it out. If it raises some problems then nothing about it is irreversible. And finally I said she should feel free to ask me tons of questions, I won't get short-tempered or scoff at her because I know it's not easy to wrap one's head around it, and that you need to understand the way different foods affect your body, especially that she is the type of person who needs to have concrete, irrefutable evidence to be persuaded. So I'll do this on my own, and she can watch how it goes and observe the changes, and she will eat however she sees fit, regardless of how I eat.  That was weeks ago, she is now on the brink of starting :P just saying :P"
keto,3dudga,KetordinaryDay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:47:59 2015 UTC,It's funny because at first she was all on board with it but then when she started it she just wasn't able to keep with it and fell out of it.

keto,3duavx,yumyumfat,3,Sun Jul 19 20:31:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with the others that starting now is best but if you are intent on easing into it, how about eating under 20 g of carbs and eating to satiety? When your contest begins, you can start eating at a good caloric deficit and will already have carb tracking down. 50 g of carbs may allow some people to enter Ketosis but not everyone. 20 g will for sure put you in Ketosis and is plenty if you are getting your carbs from vegtables and whole foods instead of frankenfoods. Seriously though, Shia LaBeouf is right and you should just do it."
keto,3duavx,okatie88,2,Sun Jul 19 21:05:49 2015 UTC,"At first glance, you'll probably want to lower that carb count to closer to 25g or 30g as a max target. I found that if I went higher than 50g (when I was eating more carbs last year), I entered a crappy zone where I had no energy (no gluconeogenesis = no ability to make the small amounts of glucose your body absolutely needs). And at that point, you'd have to eat like 150g of carbs or more to compensate, so you're definitely out of keto. Aim low on carbs."

Just a quick edit to add some of the British expat online stores have them listed a lot cheaper than Amazon.

In the context of risk associated with diet and lifestyle, it's marginal, there are worse things I could be doing and I'm not going to stress an unproven risk of HCAs unless grilled meat was all I ate. Everything has context, driving a car or leaving the house is a risk but there are worse risks you could take. HCAs might be a risk but once q week isn't going to kill especially in the context of an otherwise well formulated keto diet which drastically decreases the risk of nearly all current common health issues"

keto,3dszf0,markedr3d,4,Sun Jul 19 04:10:02 2015 UTC,Snacking will add up in terms of calories and carbs. I'm not perfect but I've gotten myself down to about 100-150 calories for snacks/dessert a day. Some days I white knuckle from 3:30 to 4:30. But it's not real hunger.

keto,3dszf0,delillie,3,Sun Jul 19 06:02:36 2015 UTC,"Distraction. Video games and porn are good choices.  But in general, ketosis lowers your appetite steadily over time so if you're only a week in, your appetite hasn't been fully dampened yet."
keto,3dszf0,YetAnotherCommenter,3,Sun Jul 19 13:07:32 2015 UTC,"There's already a couple of good responses here, but I would like to add that I think tracking what you're eating, especially when starting out, helps you understand your body and what it wants a lot more accurately.    Also, I don't know what amount of carbs you're trying to stick to everyday (20 grams is the general suggestion), but the carbs will add up quick if you snack a bunch, even if the foods are ""low carb"".  Just to repeat what markedr3d said, you might want to take in more protein and fat.  Here are a few ideas that I keep in mind every day about keto:   Stay between x-y carbs.  Personally, that's 20-30.  Other people have different levels. Make sure to get all the electrolytes I need.  Everyone's body is different, so you gotta experiment a bit while following guidelines. Make sure to eat enough fat and protein to maintain that satisfied feeling.   If you are feeling hungry 2 hours later, I suspect that you could be:   Not limiting your carbs as much as you think you are; or, perhaps, not as much as you should be. Not eating enough fat and/or protein in a meal.   Lastly, I don't know your current weight, age, your preconceptions about food, your typical meals, and so on and so forth, but you needn't be afraid of protein and fat, if that's entering your mind at all.  Don't worry about what someone else might think of you if they see you chowing down on a big ol' hunk of juicy meat.  Conversely, don't worry if someone sees you chomping away on a massive salad and accuses you of eating like a rabbit.  As far as I'm concerned, you're damned if you do, damned if you don't, so just go with the flow and do your best.  Sidenote, just had a thought pop into my head:  If you want to get a more fat in your salad without drowning it in cheese or dressing, pour some olive oil on it!  It's, apparently, a fairly common thing, but I only started doing it when I started keto and I highly recommend it."
keto,3dszf0,Tortan,2,Sun Jul 19 06:20:44 2015 UTC,"Snacking, hunger, and cravings can be caused by having a calorie deficit that is too big, or your carbs are too high.  If you make your meals fattier, either by fatty meats or by adding oils like olive oil, coconut oil or butter, you will feel satiated & fuller longer. Also having meals with more protein will help too. If you have snacks around then you will eat them. In other words get rid of the snacks, and eat meals that are more dense with fat and protein. And before you eat, drink water since you may just be thirsty.  Make sure you get all your electrolytes (see FAQ for proper amounts)"
keto,3dszf0,BigTigerPaw,2,Sun Jul 19 07:08:37 2015 UTC,Part of adjusting to keto from a high cane diet is learning the difference between satiety and fullness. It sounds like that's part of what you're dealing with as well as habit. Easy solution would be to stop keeping snacks at your desk and learn to ask yourself if you're truly hunger or bored or looking for physical fullness.
keto,3dszf0,anbeav,2,Sun Jul 19 09:58:35 2015 UTC,"Be busy. Seriously, the only time I want to snack is when I'm doing nothing on the computer.

While you're adapting, ensure you're getting enough energy to fuel your body, and hunger is the signal your body sends to let you know it isn't getting enough."

I work a physical job 9-10 hrs a day and have it set there and my macros give me more than enough nutrition to keep me going and still lose weight. One thing I have been doing lately is reading posts labeled as [FP] which is food porn. This has given me tons of ideas for future meals. Most posts include ingredients/instructions and if not most users are more than happy to help you out. The meals I have tried based on these posts have been excellent. I highly recommend using My Fitness Pal to track your food intake. Weighting all of your ingredients is also very helpful. It is too easy to guess portion size incorrectly and this keeps you honest.

There were other signs of massive bacterial death, basically involving other body odours (mouth was super funky, lady bits were funky, poo was funky), despite being a fastidiously clean person. That was gone after 2 months or thereabouts, and now I smell 'normal' and poop semiweekly (twice a week), and they're firm. There is no shart alert.

Since ketosis can be fatal for diabetics, these sticks can be found in the diabetic's section of your local drug store (Note- As a former heavyweight, I know browsing diabetic supplies can feel uncomfortably real. Just remember you're perusing that section NOW so you won't have to make repeat visits much LATER). You dip one side of the ketostick into some of your urine and you can tell at a glance if you're in Keto or not. Its a little peace of mind while you experiment between how much bread you need to prevent ""yellow"" and actually keeping your carbs low enough to remain in ketosis.  As far as 'not-breads', AFAIK they should be avoided. They use clever little chemistry tricks to lower their official, government allotted carb count, but your body won't be fooled. It'll process faux-bread like any other grain. Last I checked, anything that poses as a grain or a sugar should be avoided. Whole grain is still grain- Avoid like poison. Possible exception with artificial sweeteners, like in diet cola: some folks have reported issues with them while on Keto, but I never had any problems. I would often enjoy a coke zero, a little whole cream and a splash of vanilla extract just because Keto."

I breastfed and ketoed, but not til 10 months. Losing wright is ultimately about cutting calories. Keto is a tool to manage calorie restrictions because fat and protein make you feel full more so than carbs. When I went keto and cut calories, my supply tanked. At 10 months, after EBF while working full time and pumping 4-5 times a day, I didn't care that mtg supply went down and we ended up having to supplement with formula. My suggestion is that you go slow with calorie cutting to see if there is any impact on supply. Depending on height and weight, you need about 400 calories extra a day to bf. I think it al depends on your goals wth breastfeeding. How would you feel if supply went down and you needed to supplement? There's also a  (not very active) sub r/losebellynotboobmilk I think there was a thread a where people said 1800 calories/day worked for them to keep milk and lose weight but ymmv. I couldn't deal with taking care of the baby, working, pumping and being strict about diet. So I held onto about 10-15 lbs for almost a year. I finally lost the last bit around his first bday.

If you're worried you could get some urine pH test strips and see if you can try and maintain the pH around 6-7 to avoid, or potentially dissolve, stones. You can also supplement with potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate, but check with a doctor if you want to do larger doses (4 grams potassium citrate and 2 grams potassium bicarbonate in the below study):   On the contrary after 6 weeks of potassium citrate/bicarbonate treatment, complete stone dissolution was found in three of the patients.

keto,3dqoq6,bryancb86,3,Sat Jul 18 17:39:18 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the party!  Make sure you run your calc in the sidebar keto calculator.  Read the FAQ and then read it again.  Activity set at sedentary no matter what you think it should be.  20g carbs, protein at .8g/lbm, remainder is fat.    Buy a food scale.   Download MFP and log your intake religiously(it gets easier after the first week).  Feeling hungry? Drink some water you're probably just thirsty.   I'm zeeboot on MFP and I'd love to watch your progress!  Everyone here wants to see you succeed so don't hesitate to ask questions.  You're gonna do great.  EDIT: IF probably isn't gonna impact the dramatic loss you're about to experience but do your thing.  If anything I would worry more about not feeling hungry for a while(lots of fat! Mmm, cheese is your friend) so you can establish the good habits of not eating things you shouldn't.  Cheating(likely not on purpose) is probably going to be your biggest struggle for the first couple weeks."

I was lucky enough that everyone was and still is incredibly supportive of my weight loss journey.  I get compliments daily.   Just know that while you may feel weird ordering a bunless burger now no one else will care in a month when you've done it in front of them a few times.  My loss has actually got a few work folks on board with keto.   I don't talk about my eating lifestyle unless pressured for fear of seeming preachy.  And yes, I use the word lifestyle intentionally. You will think of it as a diet for a little bit and then your mind will slowly convert into lifestyle mode.  I don't even think about it anymore.    Get going man. You'll look back in a month and think ""holy shit I've lost a lot of weight"". And in two months you'll be a different person.   I'm proud of you for taking the first step."

That's what I do, 1/4tsp of Lite Salt (that's half sodium, half potassium) in 20oz of water and drink it.  The multivitamin will not take care of sodium, potassium, or magnesium for you.

Waste of money, compared to the salt substitutes. Don't take too much at once as it can be hard on the stomach at concentration. I like cold carbonated water with 1/4 tsp nu-salt and 1/4 to 1/2 tsp regular salt mixed in. Mix in slowly as it makes it fizz up a lot. Potassium chloride by itself in water tastes nasty to me.

Pretty sure I'm in withdrawal of some sort, plus this low potassium/ salt/ magnesium issue. But feeling like shit - low energy is not new for me.

In the first week you lose a bunch of  water weight, which totally counts in my opinion. I don't know if that's happened to you yet. Depending on how big you are you are it could make you look noticeably better right away. Hopefully that boost makes this temporary bad time worth it. Good luck buddy."

I only ask because I find my experiences to be drastically different than a lot of testimonials on here, after about 6 months I had lost 80 pounds but there were times I hit plateaus and felt exactly like you and tracking the problem down proved to really remotivate me."

Yes work a 8-5 desk job. Trying to get back into the exercise portion, stress has decreased significantly in the past few months"
keto,3ds8rv,naturexplorer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, so some encouragement:  40lbs overweight isn't that significant, which unfortunately means it is going to be harder to take off.  From my own experience (I was 100lbs overweight when I began) the first pounds practically melted off, it was awesome, it was the reason I was able to stick with it, but now, 80lbs later that same diet and lifestyle isn't having the same impact.  A lot of people encourage you to avoid the scale, this for me doesn't help.  What I found helped was living on the scale.  Things like waterweight, going to the bathroom, having recently eaten can and do effect what the scale shows (Hell, getting on the scale fresh out the shower will effect it) so what I did was a weighed myself twice daily.  For me it was first thing in the morning and first thing after my after work shower.  The reason I bring up routine is because if you can build a routine for your diet it will greatly help in tracking weight and identifying what is going on.  My life is always so chaotic, but in the times when I was working a regular schedule with low stress I found I had the most success.  I noticed elsewhere you said you do less than 50 carbs a day, I would recommend trying to keep it at 20 as others have said.  I frequently go over but most of the time around 30-40 is when I risk falling out of Ketosis, and when I did the weight gain hits hard.  It is mostly water weight so it is easy to take off, but still it hurts.  Just last month because of all the chaos in my life I went off diet pretty hard, but when I went back on it my fourth weigh in (so my second day, post work weigh in) I had lost just shy of 15lbs, but the thing is that wasn't really 15lbs of fat burned, it was mostly water weight and simply having less food in me.  I don't know if any of that helps.  I recognize for me this whole weight loss thing was for personal health reasons, I had never tied my self image to my weight so I know my experiences are not even close to the norm."
keto,3ds8rv,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:26:37 2015 UTC,"After my initial pre-keto weight-in, I didn't touch a scale for the first month. It was really tough not knowing how I was doing, especially since I still don't see a physical difference in the mirror but it was worth it just trusting the process. I knew my macros were right, I weighed every gram of food and marked everything in MFP religiously. After a month I had lost a little over 15 lbs but I very well could have gained weight that first week before starting to lose. If you are following your macros, you should see gains over time. Just don't compare yourself to other peoples results. Some peoples bodies might drop weight quicker but they might also gained it quicker than everyone else originally. If it isn't just simply water fluctuation, it could be do to incorrect macros, not weighing food or counting carbs but not eating at a caloric deficit. Good luck and stay strong."

keto,3ds8rv,Spiffy-Tiffy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:26:21 2015 UTC,Calculate your deficit again. Get a food scale. Make sure you weigh your food. Make sure you stay at a deficit with your calories. Make sure you stay under 20 net grams of carbs per day. Weigh yourself once a week AND take measurements.

keto,3ds8rv,Spiffy-Tiffy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:00:00 2015 UTC,"If you do <50 there is a chance you may not be in ketosis which is what aids in fat burning. If that's what you've been doing then I would try going down to <30 and see if that helps. If not then <20. Usually people who are a bit more active can maintain ketosis at <50, but if you are more sedentary then you're less likely."
