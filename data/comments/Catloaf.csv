He got to be 18 years old, before we had to put him to sleep this January, seeing as he developed asthma suddenly which slowly choked him to death. For me it was a very tragic loss which I am still not completly over as this loaf has been with us nearly my whole life long. As an example here are a few pictures of me as a baby and him kind of cuddling with me.  This picture is back from Sylvester 2013. Good memories, good memories..."

I rescue a lot of animals and always try to remind myself that while they are only a part if your life, you are THEIR entire life. And all the love and kissies you give them makes them lucky kitties. You made one beings life so so happy and that's something to be proud about.  And you now have room to make another kitty just as happy as you made him! :3"

Catloaf,3cpu83,shadow_control,6,Fri Jul 10 02:16:36 2015 UTC,"They are actually fairly easy to put on! Trim the nail (not too short).   Get the kitty into a (relaxing) position! Fill the cap about 1/3 full with the adhesive (this usually comes with the caps).  Quickly slip the cap on to the nail. It's best to make sure there is no runoff. When you fill the cap with too much glue, it'll spill over and then kitty is uncomfortable.   Afterwards, give kitty a treat to let him/her know they did a great job! I be sure to praise them every time I administer the caps; it helps to associate them with treats/positive feelings.   I often have to reapply missing caps every 2-4 days. It just depends on how much they chew on them (I highly discourage that behavior) or how active they are. The more kitty runs around, the greater the chance the caps might fall off.   Overall, the claw caps have been a great success. Sure I have to keep up with caps falling off here and there, but for the most part my babies have the tolerated them well.   PLUS-- I don't get scratched the fuck up. And my furniture gets a reprieve too!   Edit: Don't buy caps from a chain pet store. You'll pay out the asshole. But online (eBay is good). You'll get the cheapest caps from Hong Kong (once again on eBay), but be prepared to wait 3-4 weeks for shipping."
