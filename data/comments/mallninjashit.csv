mallninjashit,3e2hk0,Toddler_Souffle,19,Tue Jul 21 21:06:27 2015 UTC,There's no way that's legal.
mallninjashit,3e2hk0,decoy321,6,Tue Jul 21 13:57:36 2015 UTC,"Don't know what kind of plate that is, but it looks vaguely yellow on top and pale on the bottom which lines up with an NJ plate.   http://www.knifeup.com/new-jersey-knife-laws/  There are specific kinds of laws but there is no blade length restriction so it's all good in NJ as long as there is no intent to harm. In FL, there is a gray zone where it's only legal up to 4"" but after that, it's undefined (probably so that it's up to the judge if you're guilty. If you are carrying a machete to trim palm leaves, it's legal, if you're walking around with a katana at a walmart, probably less so.)   In colorado, all knives over 3.5"" are illegal to carry.   TL:DR; Maybe?  Edit: also for NJ ""Any weapon for which a person has an explainable lawful purpose for owning"": Belonging to a martial arts club for training to be a bad ass ninja is an explainable lawful purpose."

mallninjashit,3e2hk0,ComradeOj,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:26 2015 UTC,If people can own guns (which they should) then there shouldn't be any stupid laws keeping people from carrying large knives. Swords are pushing it but blades 4 inches and longer do a lot of things that smaller knives can't.

Thing is the NRA doesn't push for knife rights the way they do gun rights, and there aren't any other significant second amendment lobbies.

mallninjashit,3dxb0g,fluttersoshy,18,Mon Jul 20 10:05:58 2015 UTC,I'd trust the crossbow more than anything else there  Is that really a 10/22 though...? The stock looks kinda reminiscent of some Gamo airguns.
mallninjashit,3dxb0g,GreatBaldung,17,Mon Jul 20 11:46:29 2015 UTC,Definitely a pellet gun.
mallninjashit,3dxb0g,SchwarzeSonne_,14,Mon Jul 20 13:39:36 2015 UTC,That is absolutely not a 10/22.      There's no magwell or magazine release. There's no ejection port. The trigger guard is way too big and doesn't have the safety.   That is a pellet gun.
mallninjashit,3dxb0g,akai_ferret,6,Mon Jul 20 13:49:27 2015 UTC,Is that really a 10/22 though   Doesn't look like any 10/22 I've seen.
mallninjashit,3dxb0g,wee0x1b,-4,Mon Jul 20 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"I think it is, that doesn't look like an airgun scope for one, but I've seen similar stocks for 10/22s, I've heard they're easier to draw and shoulder-fire."
mallninjashit,3dxb0g,bitshoptyler,5,Mon Jul 20 13:15:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think so... Tubular upper, the stock seems to split right around where the ""chamber"" would be. If only the last picture wasn't so damn grainy."
mallninjashit,3dxb0g,GreatBaldung,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:39:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on second look it looks like the barrel is multiple sizes near the 'hole' in the stock (where the barrel breaks to load and pump), also the trigger safety is different than 10/22-style, it looks like the safety is inside the trigger guard, similar to many Crosmans.  So yup, probably an airgun.  Source: Every squirrel I shot with one years ago after getting sick of losing all the fruit we grew."

Any tool can be used by someone who knows how to do damage with it, you could use a spoon to mess someone up if you knew how and wanted to.  To me, a mall ninja is a state of mind.  Someone who buys all this stuff then actual attempts to use it but fails badly at it because they lack proper skill and end up looking like a complete fool because they try to hard at it through ignorance.  I keep thinking of Chris Farley in Beverly hills ninja when I think mall ninja.    It's kind of rare to catch one in the wild though.  So, carry on."

mallninjashit,3dsh0c,Deradius,-14,Mon Jul 20 10:42:34 2015 UTC,"From here:   There are numerous classical twin studies in obesity, and the average heritability (i.e., proportion of inter-individual difference in a trait explicable by genetic variability) reported consistently in these studies on the order of 40–75%    Obesity has a very strong genetic component, and it can be very difficult to judge other people for these sorts of things when they have to suffer three or four times as much as you might to achieve the same goal.  Your opinions might be more welcome over at /r/fatpe - wait, they banned that subreddit so now you have nowhere to go.  Well, carry on I suppose."

mallninjashit,3dsh0c,Deradius,-6,Sun Jul 19 12:17:08 2015 UTC,"I've given you the data.  I'm not sure what else to tell you.  Obesity is between 40 and 75% heritable, and this meta-analysis includes twin studies in which monozygotic twins were separated.  It's not as simple as calories in and calories out because there are neurological/physiological variables in between the calories in and calories out that are affected by genetics.  As an example of a biological condition that can lead to weight gain, hypothyroidism can lead to both lethargy and weight gain by reducing the body's basal metabolic rate.  It has impacts on heart rate, ventilation rate, cardiac output, and so on.  Things like VO2 Max are under genetic control, and satiety responsiveness may be as well.  Hell, even where your body stores fat is under considerable genetic influence.  If you get winded three times faster than the next person and you suffer from hunger if you don't overeat, losing weight is going to be much more of a challenge for you than it will for someone else.  My point here is this:  As much as you (for whatever reason) may wish this were the case, obesity is not a character flaw.  You can't say someone is weak or flawed just by looking at them and seeing that they are obese.  They may have just as much self control as you, and may be exerting that self control just as diligently as you, and they may still be overweight because they've lost the genetic lottery.  It may be ten times harder for them to run the same distance, or say no to the same food.  They may be hardwired that way.  That's no excuse not to try and I'm not saying it is.  People should watch what they eat and exercise.  But I know and have seen people who exert tremendous discipline over extended time and are still overweight."
mallninjashit,3dsh0c,RaccoNooB,2,Sun Jul 19 12:35:50 2015 UTC,"It's not as simple as calories in and calories out because there are neurological/physiological variables in between the calories in and calories out that are affected by genetics.

Hell, even where[4] your body stores fat is under considerable genetic influence.   Where does not affect how it burns.   As much as you (for whatever reason) may wish this were the case, obesity is not a character flaw.    Wow what an assumption! Maybe you shouldn't judge people so quickly?  I've got no problem with overweight/obese people. Shit, I am personally overweight right now. And yes, there are definitely certain factors that make weight gain easy and loss difficult, and in some cases not really practical. That's fine. But the majority of people crying about their genetics are looking for an excuse, like all people who don't want to change. Most people don't lose the genetic lottery that harshly."
mallninjashit,3dsh0c,Deradius,4,Sun Jul 19 12:39:57 2015 UTC,"...All that does is change the calorie ratio necessary.   It also changes the effort, self-control, and discipline needed to achieve the necessary calorie ratio.   The obesity predisposing FTO variant was associated with increased total and fat dietary intake in children [20, 21] as well as in adults [22]. The obesity risk variant was also associated with diminished satiety and / or increased feeling of hunger in children [23] and in adults [24]. The obesity predisposing SNP variant near MC4R was associated with increased feeling of hunger [25, 26], increased snacking [25], decreased satiety [26], and increased total, fat and protein energy intake [25, 27], the effects of the variant on food-related parameters being observed both in children and adults.   But the majority of people crying about their genetics are looking for an excuse, like all people who don't want to change.   I disagree.  Study one:   Results from twin studies suggest that genetic factors explain 50 to 90% of the variance in BMI.   Study two:   For the transformed data, the zero-order correlation of twins' BMIs was 0.79 for all twins, 0.63 for the Finnish twins, 0.73 for the Japanese twins and 0.85 for the 'archival' twins. When modeled with regression to control for relevant covariates, the estimate of h2 is either 0.50 or 0.70, depending on one's definition. The semipartial r was 0.50, suggesting that 50% of the total variance in BMI appears to the genetic in origin after controlling the covariates.   Study three:   The heritability of that portion of weight unrelated to height was large: .61 for men and .73 for women.   Study four:   Concordance rates for different degrees of overweight were twice as high for monozygotic twins as for dizygotic twins. Classic twin methods estimated a high heritability for height, weight, and BMI, both at age 20 years (.80, .78, and .77, respectively) and at a 25-year follow-up (.80, .81, and .84, respectively). Height, weight, and BMI were highly correlated across time, and a path analysis suggested that the major part of that covariation was genetic. These results are similar to those of other twin studies of these measures and suggest that human fatness is under substantial genetic control.   Study five:   The intrapair correlation coefficients of the values for body-mass index of identical twins reared apart were 0.70 for men and 0.66 for women. These are the most direct estimates of the relative importance of genetic influences (heritability) on the body-mass index, and they were only slightly lower than those for twins reared together in this and earlier studies.   Study six:  In pairs of male monozygotic twins, weight gain on the same calorie surplus ranged from 9 to 29 pounds between pairs (!), but varied little within pairs.  If I can eat the same calorie surplus you can over two weeks, and I gain 9 pounds while you gain 29 pounds as a result,  I'm not going to chalk the difference between us up to 'you looking for an excuse'.  You would need to burn 60,000 more calories than I do over the same period of time to maintain the same weight, which is 89 hours of cardio.  In other words, you'd need to spend 26.5% of that two week period running 12 minute miles just to break even with me.  That specific example is admittedly from the two extremes of the range, so I'll also tell you that the standard deviation is 5.3 pounds.  Even at only one standard deviation apart, that's 15,000 calories or 22 hours in two weeks that you have to spend running that I don't; again, just to break even!  You can keep saying that people who are talking about genetics are looking for an excuse and I won't be able to stop you.  But I don't think you can continue to say that and say that you are open to changing your opinion given sufficient data and remain intellectually honest."
mallninjashit,3dsh0c,Doctor16,2,Sun Jul 19 13:11:54 2015 UTC,"You're making this way too complicated for yourself.   If you eat too much, you'll gain weight. People will gain more or less weight depending on person to person, but only if you eat too much.   If you don't eat more than what your body needs, you're not going to increase in weight. If you eat slightly less than you need, you'll start to lose weight. Add in some exercise, and you will lose weight even faster. Now if I need 2 weeks worth of exercise to lose a couple of pounds but you only need one, it doesn't matter.   Nobody is immune to diet and exercise. It's not going to work as well on everybody, but it's going to work.  With that said, I'm not going to condone this guy for being fat. For all I know, he might be working on it and if so, that's great."
mallninjashit,3dsh0c,madwilliamflint,-1,Sun Jul 19 19:52:36 2015 UTC,"You're making this way too complicated for yourself.   And my point is that you (and many others) make it way too simple.  I'm not blaming you personally, but people have had this 'calories in, calories out' mantra pounded into their head with such zeal that I can hand you a pile of peer reviewed references indicating that there is a very significant heritable component which is mediated most likely by a complex mix of satiety signaling, leptin and thyroid hormone issues, and variability in the body's conversion of energy to lean vs fat mass and you'll blink once or twice and just repeat the old lines.   Your response here strongly suggests to me that no matter how much data I present, it's not really going to matter to you.   People will gain more or less weight depending on person to person   People will:   Have different energy levels from person to person, mediating ability to exercise. Have different VO2 max from person to person, mediating ability to exercise. Have different calorie to lean or fat mass conversion rates from person to person, mediating the effect of excess calorie consumption, with the difference potentially requiring the investment of up to 25% of the week running just to break even. Have various visible or invisible disabilities that may impact the duration and effectiveness of their exercise programs. Have different satiety thresholds from person to person; one person may be able to eat a handful of almonds every six hours and be good all day, and another may have to endure the constant psychological pressure of feeling hunger nearly irrespective of how much food is consumed. Probably much more that I'm not aware of because this isn't even my field of study.   Your oversimplification is akin to saying:  'Look, you're overthinking this.  All you have to do to get to the top of any mountain is make sure that your net elevation is increasing.  Climb up more than you climb down, and you're going to eventually reach the summit.'  That is absolutely correct in the most technical sense and is true whether you're climbing a mole hill or Everest.  It also glosses over so many of the essential details as to be useless, perhaps even fatally useless, to a climber who tried to rely on that advice alone.  Especially if the climber is Stephen Hawking, for example.   Now if I need 2 weeks worth of exercise to lose a couple of pounds but you only need one, it doesn't matter.   Except that it does, because it impacts motivation and propensity to continue exercising, the rate at which change happens, and the energetic balance at which loss versus gain occurs.  Again, an oversimplification.  If you make more than zero dollars, you can afford a yacht!  It's just a question of how long you need to wait!  Again, technically true, but there are some rather important nuances we're glossing over here.   Nobody is immune to diet and exercise. It's not going to work as well on everybody, but it's going to work.   My point was never that diet and exercise don't work or can never work.  My point is that person A can have a BMI of 30 and twice the discipline and work ethic of person B with a BMI of 20.  It's not reasonable to claim that obesity is the result of a character flaw or 'someone's own fault' when such a substantial component of the condition is genetically determined."

This looks to have a similar mechanism.   The knuckles look like machined aluminum or something and that probably took some tooling to set up production. I doubt they made a lot of those.   So, low production. Probable quality (no idea). Also illegal as fuck in most places. I'm sure the price is about right.  Edit: I said something really stupid at the beginning here... Microtech Halo 5 is a single-action OTF switchblade. This one is a double-action OTF. Microtech does make a double action OTF but it's kind of hideous. Anyway the Ultratech, Scarab and Troodon are less sexy than the Halo series but they are the same price range and are all double-action OTF.

mallninjashit,3dcsxs,Wanderer_Takezo,17,Wed Jul 15 16:33:14 2015 UTC,It even has the sections that break off.
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,Kayakular,8,Wed Jul 15 11:16:05 2015 UTC,That's my favorite part of the AOT swords.  They're basically giant box cutters.

mallninjashit,3dcsxs,Sick_Boy_Paddy,5,Wed Jul 15 16:16:40 2015 UTC,"That's subjective. I like to think they're taking the DBZ road, where they stretch out all the battles and scenes, and you have to get every single persons reaction. I understand what you mean though, it took like 3 episodes to plug that hole in the wall."
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,gibusyoursandviches,21,Wed Jul 15 13:46:45 2015 UTC,"God, I tried reading the manga. It's page, after page, after page, of existential angst and drama and bullshit and whining and more angst. Maybe the show is better, but the manga was honestly 95% angst, 1% action, and 4% people getting eaten as though the author was a fettishist."
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,shiftygopher,6,Wed Jul 15 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I find AoT really, really fetishistic. It's quite off-putting."
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,RussellLawliet,6,Wed Jul 15 16:14:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not into anime but I kept hearing about that show so I gave it a shot.   First episode was pretty great, but as for the rest of it, introducing characters and then killing them off doesn't equate to depth, like a lot people seemed to think. We all know the main 3 are probably going to stay alive for the whole thing."
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,Volatilize,3,Wed Jul 15 19:33:38 2015 UTC,"The show doesn't really have much filler in it though, it's pretty focused and constantly moves forwards.  The only filler in the show was the length of the training. And the ""Since That Day"" episode labelled episode 13.5.  There didn't really seem to be anything else in the show where literally nothing happened."

mallninjashit,3dcsxs,Volatilize,4,Wed Jul 15 19:36:35 2015 UTC,They've really built up what that secret is in the manga. A LOT of PLOT has happened.

mallninjashit,3dcsxs,Volatilize,3,Thu Jul 16 04:47:06 2015 UTC,There are more interesting things to care about. I don't get why people are so hung up on the basement.
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,PunxsatownyPhil,2,Thu Jul 16 04:51:55 2015 UTC,"It seemed like they put a lot of emphasis on it, like getting there was the end goal and that the next major progression of the story would happen after they got there."
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,Volatilize,2,Thu Jul 16 04:54:38 2015 UTC,"The anime isn't really filler, its just that the dialogue drags on. It gets old very quickly and loses its rewatching value having to recap on why Eren is doing this, or why that character feels that certain way. Animes that don't spell out what, why and how each character is experiencing something, feels better IMHO. Especially if you want to show a friend as to why its awesome, you have to skip several episodes into arcs for the good actiony parts past all the talking."
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,gibusyoursandviches,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:07:49 2015 UTC,"Animes that don't spell out what, why and how each character is experiencing something, feels better IMHO.   Yeah, I can agree with that, but I guess I didn't really feel it with Attack on Titan. Perhaps it as because the reactions and behaviours of the cast of AoT felt believable, they did a great job of picturing the terror of war and how people confronted with life or death situations react very differently, even when trained.  By contrast I utterly hated another popular anime - Code Geass. Mainly because it was both incredibly obvious and explanatory while simultaneously ticking the box of every single trope, cliche and stereotype of anime while the decisions of the characters felt entirely unbelievable and unrealistic half the time. There was no depth to characters whereas I get a real sense of depth from Eren and Annie, the female titan, and Armin, I'm also still unsure of much to do with Mikasa and her personality despite it being explained how Eren's family adopted her after he saved her. Though I suppose much of this might be covered in the manga I feel it leaves the characters feeling very interesting with a lot of their motivations and decisions still to be learned. None of their decisions have felt unrealistic though.  By contrast I bet you're a big fan of Psycho-Pass, as I was, with realistic motivations and no need for things to be over-explained.  Steins;Gate would bug you if you haven't seen it... Slowest start to any anime I've seen, 11 episodes in fact, yet upon completion I know of nobody that thinks those episodes were pointless in any way at all. They contribute to the massive emotion that the rollercoaster of a second half generates in the viewer. Probably one of the best animes I've ever watched."
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,AndThatIsWhyIDrink,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:04:28 2015 UTC,"My big problem with AoT was that I saw every character's reaction.  They had spent the first few episodes killing off characters left and right, so I refused to get invested.  I didn't want to focus on a character just to have them die again.    It was a Game of Thrones vibe, but game of thrones spent a whole season before there was a big loss, AoT started that right out of the gate.  On an unrelated note, I tried Steins;Gate, got 3 episodes in and realized I'm just not smart enough for it to make any kind of sense to me."
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,quaggas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:38:43 2015 UTC,"You ARE smart enough.  Steins Gate doesn't require any kind of special knowledge or brain, it's just being silly and making a lot of things up for the most part.  It gets relatively confusing for absolutely everyone when things start bouncing backwards and forwards through time, and it's supposed to. A trope of time travel stories is generally that they're confusing as shit until something occurs that makes everything make complete sense. Expect to be confused and enjoy trying to unravel wtf is going on at times until they blow your mind. Enjoy getting into the characters too in the first half, pretty much everything up until episode 11 is just character development and building up the viewer's feelings for the characters. The entire show drastically changes pace from mundane to breakneak speed after that episode and goes from ""Why am I forcing myself to watch this"" to ""Omfg why didn't I watch this earlier?"". Still the best anime I've ever watched in my opinion, despite the romance trope of incredibly poor social skills and awkward interactions that I very much despise."
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,AndThatIsWhyIDrink,2,Thu Jul 16 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"The writers are complete donguses, even in the manga they haven't yet opened the damn basement (probably because the writers have built up to much suspense for a secret they couldn't and haven't come up with). The ""DBZ road"" is the worst fucking way to do anything. It's an obvious ploy to make people watch more adds while the writers do their best to come up with anything they can do to progress the plot. All the characters are pretty much one dimensional as well."
mallninjashit,3dcsxs,Saucy-Devil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:58:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, its why I can't rewatch the anime at all. And it's not like I need to either, they'll probably recap the fuck out of the last season for several episodes. And thank you for telling me they haven't done anything with the basement yet, you saved me a lot of time and bullshit. I was considering reading the manga just to see how far they got, because the basement was the only thing I really cared to learn about since it ""held all the secrets"". I was hoping AOT would be a short and juicy anime but I guess since the manga is no different, I might as well wait."

I'll give you that they are similar in design but the imperfections in the hilt can't possibly be made by anyone but myself. If you look closely, you can see the ripples and scuffs of my own forging. The etchings in the hilts are my own. While inspired by other designs, as all forges are, these are authentic. A press made the ones you have given in example. They are nice and all, but have no character. Mine show my mistakes, my imperfections. Call bullshit or mall ninja on me all you wish.

Where were your parents when you were purchasing this?   Third question:  Where did you get all of that sweet ninja star cash when you were 9?  Was it allowance money?"
mallninjashit,3cd721,knownaim,13,Tue Jul 7 05:53:39 2015 UTC,"Ok, wall drug is the ruin of an ancient civilization somewhere in a state compromised mostly of cornfield.   They did not let me buy the ninja star, so I waited until a more aged mall ninja went to buy one and paid him an extra dollar to get one for me.  I was with my grandpa at the time and he dont give a fuck.   Lasty, I made the mad dosh hustling and having my bitches work the street."

mallninjashit,3cd721,nzMACnz,4,Tue Jul 7 06:57:08 2015 UTC,"Real talk, everyone should have a P-38 on their keychain. Saved my ass so many times in college when I was hungry and either didn't have a kitchen can opener or had one, but it was cheap and mangled the can so badly that it couldn't be used to open it. I've yet to find a can you can't open with a P-38, even when it's too damaged for a hand crank or electric one.  I really wish you could still buy the full sized, handled can openers that were the same basic design without the portability that they used in, like, the 30's. You see the characters use them occasionally on Looney Toons. I mean, what's not to love about a can opener with no moving parts? The modern ones don't last because everything moves."

mallninjashit,3bs3u8,The80sWereCool,3,Thu Jul 2 04:11:30 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. I'm regularly mad at cops for being overly aggressive but depending on the situation I can see something like this being a mitigating factor.  Not everyone who complains about police aggression does so just to complain or because they hate cops. Sometimes, and recently more regularly being recorded and shared, cops step over the line and we should call them out on it."
mallninjashit,3bs3u8,saichampa,9,Fri Jul 3 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"Hm. Nope.   Having a gun in your pocket shouldn't get you shot. Even if it's real. Depending on open-carry laws you should probably get a ticket for using that case, and it should probably be banned in stores.   If you're pointing it at people trying to be funny or to actually threaten someone, yes. Using a phone as a phone should never get you shot.   There isn't a way to use that phone in a way that people should think it's actually a gun, except when taking a call. But even if someone actually put a gun to their heads, I can't see anything more than tazing justified.  Edit: No, you're right reddit. If you carry a firearm and happen to see anyone else who also happens to carry a firearm, you are justified in shooting them on that information alone. Thanks for showing me the error of my ways."
mallninjashit,3bs3u8,Dakrys,12,Wed Jul 1 20:58:40 2015 UTC,"Having a gun in your pocket shouldn't get you shot. Even if it's real. Depending on open-carry laws you should probably get a ticket for using that case, and it should probably be banned in stores.   Correct.   However given that you have to ""draw"" to answer the friggin' phone, it's understandable how people could get the wrong idea.  And while it's legal to open-carry in certain places, there are still practical limitations around drawing an open-carry."
mallninjashit,3bs3u8,sifumokung,16,Thu Jul 2 02:11:56 2015 UTC,"Why the downvotes? Many states allow OPEN CARRYING OF ACTUAL GUNS. It is how you wield this phone or actual firearm that makes it dangerous.   Unless the downvoters are cool with Barney Fife cops shooting every possible threat because they were scared.   Don't just stifle dissent, assholes. Make an argument if you don't agree.  Fucking pussies."
mallninjashit,3bs3u8,Haltgamer,2,Thu Jul 2 00:18:16 2015 UTC,"Its the unnecessary aggression being presented, more than anything, I would think.  Downvotes aren't supposed to be used to disagree with others, it is supposed to be used to discourage disorderly conduct. Most subreddits request it is used if nothing is added to the discussion.  Whether or not this is the case is beyond me. Its mere speculation on my part."

mallninjashit,3bs3u8,Dakrys,4,Fri Jul 3 03:15:49 2015 UTC,"Lmao.   It's probably just because I come across as pro open carry in this sub.   I don't own guns. Only shot a .22 once in my life.   But some states allow open carry. Some even without a permit. So there's really no argument against me, just butthurt regulation shills."
mallninjashit,3bs3u8,Theta_Zero,10,Thu Jul 2 00:29:59 2015 UTC,What does it matter if you're pro or against Open Carry?  You cannot shoot law-abiding citizens just because you disagree with the law.  Period.
mallninjashit,3bs3u8,Biffingston,4,Thu Jul 2 01:13:45 2015 UTC,"And yet if you think that someone is drawing on you, weather the gun is real or not, you have the right to defend yourself.  Period."
mallninjashit,3bs3u8,Theta_Zero,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, at least partially.  You have to assess the threat though before pulling the trigger.  There is no taking back a bullet.  It is a very final option for self defense and should never be your first resort.  Definitely shoot if you feel threatened, but also identify nervousness/uncomfortableness versus actual threat.  You have a gun too. If you draw then they have a right to shoot you back because they feel threatened.  It's not a good situation for either party.   Personally, yes. If someone pulled out a phone case like this I would absolutely draw on them and have them get on the ground.  Would I shoot them?  Not if they didn't make sudden movements or wave the thing around.  But I can understand how under pressure, that might happen to any law-abiding gun owner including myself.  It's 90% stupid teenagers fault, 10% rushed decision by the gun owner."

Let me just put it this way.. the time that my little sister thought I was an intruder and called the cops I kept my hands above my shoulders and clearly visible for a reason."
mallninjashit,3bs3u8,Theta_Zero,3,Thu Jul 2 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, and putting yourself into that situation is a stupid thing to do if you can avoid it.  Having a ""fake gun"" doesn't matter if other people aren't in on the joke; it's a real gun until we know otherwise.  Split second decisions absolutely do lead to mistakes so don't make me (or anyone else) have to make a split second decision about whether to shoot you."

I can totally see someone getting shot if police were walking by and they saw them reaching for that thing and got jittery. What if the person were Arabic and the police officer thought he would be a terror preventing hero? Another problem is doing this in jurisdictions where open carry of any sort is illegal and scaring police officers.   All in all while I don't think that someone should ever be shot for something like this, it will probably happen eventually remember that children have been shot for carrying BB guns before."

I'm a God Damn Marine and this kid was acting more MILSIM TACTICOOL HARDCORE WARFIGHTER than I ever acted, even during my moto-bootcamp phase."

mallninjashit,3bi0pj,The_Brain_Fuckler,9,Tue Jun 30 08:42:47 2015 UTC,"The main reason I never wanted to play airsoft. Every airsoft video I see is like 40% 'looks fun' and 60% cringe.  It also just looks dumb as fuck when everyone's all dressing up in their army mans clothes, but since there's zero consistency, it just looks like a bunch of retards who don't know what they're doing running around yelling a lot. It's like the white people version of those videos from Syria where they're running around with stock-less AKs, holding them over their heads firing them wildly.   I don't even understand how they tell each other apart. You have one asshole dressed up like he fell out of Chinook in Afghanistan right next to a guy wearing a fucking t-shirt. 8:10 is the best (before our hero with the sword comes in). Everyone's just yelling at each other, running into each other, nobody knows what the hell they're doing."

The way I deal with it is to run with a close group of friends and ignore the rest of the idiots, talking to them is like talking to a wall, most of the reason that they all have shit gear is because they would rather buy 6 guns that they don't use than upgrade the gun that they actually like."

Pussy question, it's so I can throw them at all the zombies I find. What am I doing to this sword, you ask? Why, I'm doing pull-ups with it. I stress test every blade I use to ensure proper tang, specification folding, stress modulation and stainless ribbing posterity. Being an operator isn't a fucking joke. You see this knife here, you weak little pussy? It weighs 12 pounds and it looks like a fucking dragon. Sometimes I hang myself by my feet from the rafters until all the blood goes to my head, then I gently prick my forehead with the dragon knife and a tiny jet of blood spurts out a couple feet, because the dragon said it was a good idea, and that the witch would sit on my chest every day if I didn't do the poking ritual. Why am I even explaining this to all the beta males on this sub?"

And on most days you're not even going to pull it off of your belt except maybe to cut some 550 cordage.   The axe is completely unnecessary and can be replaced by a lightweight hatchet or (my go-to) a folding saw.   The spear is the only interesting thing and really that would just be for fun because if you're really trying to catch fish there's a reason the fishing pole is the most popular way to do it, it works. Even the fishing pole is unnecessary if you have running water because you can make a funnel fish trap with a few sticks.   What do you need a leatherman for? Are you taking screws? Is the 3"" saw going to help you out? The first rule of hiking/camping/surviving outside of a car camping trip is to reduce unnecessary weight and increase mobility."

Their only course of action is whipping out a $200 black titanium knife that has 4 different flip actions and is about as sharp as a honed kitchen knife (but it looks like it could cut steel).   The worst part is that if you call them out on how ridiculous it is to carry around shit like that, they just try to pass it off as a mild convenience. Like it's just the same as carrying keys or a wallet. It's ""to open boxes"" or ""to peel fruit."" Yeah right. They're not fooling anyone. They just feel cool when they carry knives.

They aren't just full tangs that make the ""tang"" noise. No, these full tangs have a special feature: as the cheap faux paracord wears away from your toxic palm sweat, these tangs will slowly begin to fuse with your palms. The swords become a literal extension of you. Soon, even you kicks and elbows will make ""tang"" sounds upon striking your enemies. The chineseum running through your veins will give you speed you've never known, strength you've never known, and a predilection for only buying black, red and neon green clothing (with added resistance to headaches from those colors). Soon, with these swords now growing from your arms, you will be able to skip the preliminaries and go straight to Japan to compete in Ultimate Ninja Warrior. And you will win, because unlike all other competitors, you actually have a weapon: you. For you and the swords are one now. One tang, one life."

As I said before, there are other tools that would do a better job at the tasks an espada would be useful for, but that doesn't mean it is a mall ninja knife. I've seen it used for heavy duty bushcraft and it definitely proved itself.

Some might even wonder if there are male versions, perhaps in blue.. or with blue led's.  You may even think ""These are tactical claws that make your hands look like a cat."" You'd be wrong!  These are actually for RIDING a large cat, like a tiger or for smaller ninjas perhaps just a lynx. The claws help you hold on and the large cat thinks you are like any of the many other cats that often ride straddling it.  Don't be fooled by the name."

mallninjashit,39v98l,gibusyoursandviches,-5,Tue Jun 16 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"not a threat so much of getting shot by a pen gun. it's actually pretty cool....but also pretty unnecessary. it escalates things so fast; bullets can't be taken back. unless you're james bond, it's not really that practical. if you use it, and miss, well, they're going to shoot you...with more than 1 bullet. it escalates things insanely. or the notion that everyone is carrying. check out r/everydaycarry (i think thats it) and EVERYONE has a gun. ""are you a policeman?"" ""no."" in the army? no. it's part of why cops are so psychotically stressed that they automatically draw on a kid. he had a pen! well, if the cop thought that he had a 22lr pen gun, he wouldn't be wrong. it's overkill. i know this is on mall ninjas, which is cool; look, the product IS cool. the sword with the taser built in? hell yes. come ""the walking dead"" we're going to be ok. but the notion that everyone, everyone has a gun, is pretty terrifying."

It might be a little different in southern states, but its not as if its a warzone down there and people rarely ever carry (unless if you have a concealed carry permit, which only works for certain guns definitely not pen guns). This pen is widely impractical and is really only for looking cool, which is why you'd never see anyone with it, nor would you actually try and defend yourself with it.   The notion that EVERYONE has a gun is a bit silly, because its just not true. And of course you'll find people with guns in a subreddit about everyday carrying.

If you look here;  http://legallyarmed.com/ccw_statistics.htm  You'll see that the concealed carry permits are much lower than the general population, and that there are often 2 tiers of permits, one for ownership and one for carrying. So what does that mean? It means a few people who pass background checks own a lot of guns.  Also, people carry guns because they want to. Sure, it might be unnecessary at most times, but its a freedom that we have, and most people don't like having their freedom taken away. It's not like you can carry a gun anywhere either. Guns are locally banned in universities, locations such as stadiums or places that can hold over a thousand people in capacity.

An extra handhold, foothold, holding saws, chainsaws, camera, rope, etc etc. The one thing I would never use it for is brass knuckles. Unless you have a huge hand, they won't sit against your knuckles properly, and can easily spin or slide out of your hand especially if you're applying a decent amount of force. Not to mention you could easily break the mechanism rendering a 20 dollar climbing carabiner inoperable. This is the stupidest shit I've seen on here, so this one wins my upvotes."

mallninjashit,38lxi3,whisky_dick_actual,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:44:30 2015 UTC,Probably can't... Unless it's black powder then it's likely considered C&R rather than NFA but I don't work for ATF nor am I a lawyer so I'm just guessing here.
mallninjashit,38lxi3,GeneralDisorder,4,Fri Jun 5 13:47:07 2015 UTC,It's a sword. I don't think swords use black powder.
mallninjashit,38lxi3,cadika_orade,2,Fri Jun 5 15:18:27 2015 UTC,Unless it's a sword gun.  Which was actually a thing back in the black powder days.
mallninjashit,38lxi3,StabbyDMcStabberson,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"/u/wee0x1b mentioned ""cane guns"". Then /u/whicky_dick_actual asked if you can purchase an NFA without a tax stamp and form 4.   If the NFA is black powder (i.e. if a cane gun is black powder) it's not necessarily an NFA... unless I'm wrong, so ask the ATF or a lawyer with relevant specialty.  But you're correct still that the posted item isn't a firearm at all."

Folding tactical knifes are pretty mall ninja too.  This is my go-to survival knife. They're cheap but very durable, hold a blade well, are easy to sharpen, and very lightweight.

It is about a group of people who are reincarnations of ancient Inca warriors who have returned to re-enact a civil war that resulted in the fall of the Inca Empire.  Miura Kyoji, a dedicated kendo student, discovers that his instructor, Tate Masanari, is a reincarnated Inca warrior named Yawaru who wishes to destroy the world to purify it. Kyoji himself is the warrior Bilka, who foiled Yawaru's plans in their previous lives. As Yawaru gathers other awakened spirits to give him ever more power, Kyoji faces conflicting loyalties; he must decide if he is merely a vessel for the reincarnated soul, destined to fulfill a role given to him and destroy a person he liked and respected in order to save the world, or if he is a free individual who can bring Masanari to his senses and break the cycle of rebirth and human possession.

mallninjashit,37xqt2,Merlord,3,Sun May 31 11:35:27 2015 UTC,"Personally, I've always thought of mall ninjas as that guy you knew at school that had lots of cool looking shit, that he thought he could fight with, but would get his arse handed to him in a heartbeat, but I daresay there is probably some truth to your interpretation, too."
mallninjashit,37xqt2,therealbighairy,5,Sun May 31 11:45:55 2015 UTC,"I'd say those guys are definitely part of the mall ninja spectrum. I actually agree with your definition;   stuff that someone buys, believing it to be legit and practical, or tactical, but is just for show in real terms.   but I would extend it to any preference for 'coolness' over practicality. I think mall ninjas tend to buy things for the cool factor, and that just happens to have a high comorbidity with the delusion that the shit they buy is actually useful."

I remember my first sword, that I took in for cutting practice was £70 from Vic Morris in Glasgow.  Instructor wouldn't let me use it, but I tried it myself when I got home on a cardboard tube.  Took a week before I could hold a bokken again, after the handle split and the miniscule tang sliced in to my hand.  I was so ashamed."
mallninjashit,37xqt2,therealbighairy,2,Sun May 31 12:22:20 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think that its only 'mall ninja' if whoever buys it actually sharpens it and intends to possibly use it as a weapon.  Buying a replica weapon from an anime is not really any different than buying a replica weapon/item from any other genre or form of media.  Its really just a memento or discussion piece.  For example, someone buys a replica StarWars blaster and hangs it on their wall or keeps it in a collection or something.  That isn't 'mall ninja' the person knows it isn't a weapon and isn't intended to actually be a weapon.  Someone buying this thing isn't 'mall ninja' either unless they actually sharpen it and carry it around in order to use it as a weapon."

mallninjashit,37v43n,ReyRey5280,12,Sat May 30 23:33:48 2015 UTC,"Alright I got this. As a zombie expert once told me in a drunken ramble humans see more shades of green than any other color so when the body and brain dies the green cone cells die off rapidly. The rods are more precise and also more durable so they rot slower. When the zombie turns zombie it's color vision fades almost immediately and it mainly just follows movement...  Unless they're propelled by magic then all bets are off. Also you'll be fighting skeletons, ghouls, goblins, demons, undead of all kinds, I can't really remember any more of the monsters from Diablo 1 and 2 or expansions but you get where I'm going right?"

mallninjashit,36pgph,saichampa,7,Tue May 26 01:46:01 2015 UTC,"Post again at /r/knifecringe.  I also have a few questions. I'm not a fan of karambits, so if there's any karambit experts here, help me out.   What's the point of the ""extensions""? All it does is return the knife to the original position. Does it serve any purpose? Why is it most commonly held in the upside-down position? I'd keep it upright so I can block an opponent's knife. More specifically, I wouldn't even be using a karambit, I'd be with my Bowie."
mallninjashit,36pgph,info90,8,Thu May 21 11:31:52 2015 UTC,"Alright  1.) The extensions are mostly flashy and for an intimation factor or psych-out an opponent.  Also, it can be a weak deceptive hit.  You get used to the blade having a certain range, doing an extension you can hit someone with the spine of the blade (or the other edge as some karambits are double edged) or you could theoretically hook into someone's face on the return from the extension.   2.) The karambit originated as a farm tool, it was a small sickle type tool and while I'm not a filipino farmer, I was told that's how the original tool was used.  And now most of the karambit techniques are built around that reverse grip hold.  A karambit is actually a bit more clumsy when held in a forward grip (unless it's something like one of the new straight-bladed karambits) because you can't really thrust easily with it."
mallninjashit,36pgph,chipotleninja,2,Thu May 21 18:54:34 2015 UTC,I thought it was supposed to be a tiger's claw. Which would be weird to hold it blade down like that.
mallninjashit,36pgph,professorbooty25,3,Thu May 21 22:51:49 2015 UTC,"The blade shape is modeled after a claw, especially the ones designed more as a weapon.  But drawing and using a blade with that clawed shape is easier in reverse grip."
mallninjashit,36pgph,chipotleninja,11,Thu May 21 23:01:05 2015 UTC,I think people just want to look cool spinning a fucking talon around.
mallninjashit,36pgph,hktouk,6,Thu May 21 17:14:34 2015 UTC,http://i.imgur.com/t0Tkz.jpg  where it began
mallninjashit,36pgph,sigurbjorn1,3,Wed May 27 17:18:13 2015 UTC,"The spin move is called a ""flail"" and it is used as an impact strike, though some karambits have a second edge. It is mostly a feinting and distraction maneuver, but it is actually very important technique for a kali knife fighter, as misdirection is thr main method of scoring strikes.  The reverse grip is the standard karambit grip for a few reasons: the ring, and also the inwardly curved blade, is arguably the reason the karambit is considered the most effectice combat knife, as retention is everything in hand to hand knife fighting. If you hold thr knife in a standard grip, your pinky goes in the ring as opposed to your primary finger. Pinky in the ring is not recommended as any fighter worth his salt will notice and give your blade a good twist to break your pinky, and disarm you. The curve of the blade is another important feature, as curve=control. You use the curve to hook your opponent's wrist, crook of elbow, and neck. If i get hold of your arm, and jam the curved edge of thr karambit into the crook of the elbow and push down towards the ground, you will instinctively drop to the ground to avoid getting cut. The curve can be utilized well with either grip, though again, nobody wants their pinky broken.  Edit: and just to clarify, what this dude is doing is sloppy and filled with bullshit that is only intended to look cool, and i say cool because thats what he is thinking. also, The sequence he is doing is about as basic as it gets."
mallninjashit,36pgph,info90,2,Sat May 30 21:40:00 2015 UTC,"Now that is a fact: Karambits are the best fighting knife. I agree with that.  The reason I'm not a fan of them is because it trades combat for utility and versatility.  I, personally, would rather carry a tool than a weapon. But that's just me."
mallninjashit,36pgph,sigurbjorn1,4,Sat May 30 22:19:27 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, you only carry a karambit if you intend it to be a combat knife.

mallninjashit,36pgph,sigurbjorn1,1 point,Sun May 31 00:51:32 2015 UTC,"Think of karambit fighting being kind of like taichi(sp?). Instead of blocking with the blade, you redirect using your forearm and your ""shield hand"", which in kali-silat, which is a form, technically two, of filipino fighting,  is what we call your empty off hand, like you see in taichii. Let me find a link for you. Now, what i am going to show you is practice fighting with training knives, metal, blunt immitations of the samr dimensions and weight, and although it looks choreographed, it is actually jusy highly practiced and they are in the flow. You will see quite a few good disarms as well. Be warned, the intro is godawful.  Edit: also, this isnt me.

They observe the marketplace and have their ears to the ground considering what the average Mall Ninja wants to buy. All so that they can introduce new knives for the following season.

mallninjashit,36edtz,Brudus,2,Tue May 19 02:16:48 2015 UTC,Are there any jurisdictions where brass knuckles are illegal but full-guard knives like that spikey one and the buteerfly thing aren't? Because (setting aside your opinion on weapons laws in general) that would be silly.
mallninjashit,36edtz,CoolGuy54,4,Tue May 19 00:53:18 2015 UTC,Brass knuckles are illegal.  That there is a paperweight.
mallninjashit,36edtz,AUMoriarty,2,Tue May 19 05:51:15 2015 UTC,Has this ever worked anywhere?
mallninjashit,36edtz,CoolGuy54,2,Tue May 19 09:22:10 2015 UTC,Sure... in possession inside a bag with receipt of recent purchase or on someone's desk.  Ever when involved in criminal case? No way. Because if you bash someone in the head with a paperweight that looks and functions as something banned the purpose or legal status of the object is entirely secondary to assaulting a person with it. Probably other more specific reasons too but I'm no lawyer.
mallninjashit,36edtz,GeneralDisorder,2,Tue May 19 15:25:21 2015 UTC,"Well at that stage the assault charge is weightier anyway, so its not a big win for the cops. It's the ""being used as an actual paperweight"" case that would never fly in my jurisdiction (NZ) and I'm still skeptical that it works anywhere."
mallninjashit,36edtz,CoolGuy54,3,Tue May 19 21:47:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah. This depends on how illegal it is. In parts of the US where possession is fine but carry isn't (I can legally own throwing stars, butterfly knives, switchblades, daggers, WW1 fighting knives, and brass knuckles) you could probably carry the item in a bag legally or in a locked case.   If it's illegal to possess that's a whole other animal."

mallninjashit,3696v0,callmesnake13,1 point,Fri May 22 22:03:18 2015 UTC,I really only remember a douche dressed up like a swat cop attacking some fence posts and soda bottles. I bet it's an all time top post in this sub. It was awesome.
mallninjashit,3696v0,professorbooty25,14,Fri May 22 22:14:09 2015 UTC,"I actually like the look of all this m48 stuff.  I know I'll never, ever be in a position to use it until the zombie apocalypse, but it's all cheap enough, and seems to take enough of a pounding, like my ex-girlfriend, that the temptation is there."
mallninjashit,3696v0,therealbighairy,29,Sun May 17 15:24:05 2015 UTC,"The material they make the handles out of is pretty brittle, and the tang of the axe is really short.

mallninjashit,3696v0,speedy45,2,Sun May 17 15:17:53 2015 UTC,"I love how the handle is considerably shorter than poleaxes, and significantly longer than typical one handed war axes. This thing is a disadvantage in a melee because it doesn't give you much if any extra reach and can't be used one handed with a shield. Also it's made of cheap plastic with a short tang so it will probably break from a few solid whacks."

E.G., for emergency use at ranges a lot closer than 5 feet? I know I've seen similar guns, I'm just not sure if I've seen one with both the knife part and the brass knuckles part. There's some other ridiculous things from the 18th-19th century, too, like a gun for a prison guard that doubled as the cell key."
mallninjashit,367xsu,Owyn_Merrilin,4,Mon May 18 23:29:48 2015 UTC,"First, apologies, these were apparently considered a pepperbox design of a sort.  They were, however, 20th century weapons, or at least not well known until then.

mallninjashit,354nke,Grave_Girl,13,Thu May 7 03:50:04 2015 UTC,I don't want people thinking I am taking shit about cold Steel. I had a bushmaster until last weekend and it was my every day carry. The videos are what make it mall ninja shit to me.
mallninjashit,354nke,minotaurohomunculus,11,Thu May 7 14:20:54 2015 UTC,Did you ever hang up cuts of pork and attack the meat confidently then defiantly nod to a camera?
mallninjashit,354nke,DarkComedian,2,Thu May 7 21:23:25 2015 UTC,Nope
mallninjashit,354nke,dabork,35,Thu May 7 21:33:26 2015 UTC,"Nah, cold steel actually isn't so bad. It's a bit over priced and really just mid-tier quality, but it's not cheap shit.   Some of it IS fairly questionable though, at least in terms of marketing. But they beat the shit out of those things, and they just keep cutting."
mallninjashit,354nke,Muffinut,14,Thu May 7 03:30:55 2015 UTC,"I was hoping to see some defense here.  Cold Steel makes pretty good stuff if you can catch it at the right price, but shit straight out of their catalog is always about 25% more than it should be.  They make tons of ""dumb"" stuff that is actually built pretty well, but they also have their share of regular knives that aren't half bad.  I carried one of their AK-47 folders around for a few years and it was pretty good until I lost it camping.  Basically, I probably wouldn't buy direct from them unless it was on sale, but I wouldn't be nervous about using something made by them either."
mallninjashit,354nke,chipotleninja,5,Thu May 7 12:46:50 2015 UTC,Well the link in the OP is $75 on their site but just $40 on Amazon. Sounds like a great price for it.
mallninjashit,354nke,Narwhalbaconguy,11,Thu May 7 18:55:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah cold-steel is weirdly positioned for the mall-ninja.  Yes, some of their videos of chopping up pigs or stabbing a car hood to death are silly and overly dramatic.  But most of their stuff isn't completely impractical.  I bought a couple of their things on sale, and the quality is decent.  Most (but not all) of their stuff is also based on designs that, historically, were at least moderately effective."
mallninjashit,354nke,Boomerkuwanga,4,Thu May 7 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"I agree. I love the Brooklyn Basher, it's a surprisingly nice baseball bat."

mallninjashit,354nke,SchwarzeSonne_,0,Thu May 7 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"The swords are shit. At best they are high quality wallhangers. The weight and balancing is atrocious. The knives, and in my experience the axes are perfectly functional though."
mallninjashit,354nke,InquisitiveLion,7,Thu May 7 18:20:03 2015 UTC,They make a nice machete.
mallninjashit,354nke,dragonblade629,6,Thu May 7 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"they are sold as machetes, not swords. They're good for their price ad can cut things without shattering or the blade flying out, which is what you're getting for $20-50 bucks."
mallninjashit,354nke,InquisitiveLion,5,Thu May 7 22:34:08 2015 UTC,"The machetes seem to be a good value, and I'm looking into purchasing one at some point, but they do sell swords.  http://www.coldsteel.com/Category/4_1/Swords.aspx  A lot of them use threaded pommels and just aren't worth the cost. One would be better off getting a Hanwei, Darksword, or Albion blade."
mallninjashit,354nke,zsiwpoprod,2,Thu May 7 22:40:19 2015 UTC,"ah yeah.... NOOO not for those prices. I heard cult of Athena was a good place, if you're into that stuff."
mallninjashit,354nke,SchwarzeSonne_,1 point,Thu May 7 22:43:45 2015 UTC,"Yah, Kult of Athena has good prices on a lot of stuff. I don't have any experience with swords with cutting blades, just mostly dulled hunks of carbon steel in the shape of swords that are well suited for stage combat. I mean, I could have gotten the Hanwei Practical I've bought from them sharpened (I'm pretty sure there was a video of some mall ninja in a trench coat cutting water jugs with the sharpened side sword, so I guess that's sharp), but when you want to have it hitting against other swords, sharp is silly."
mallninjashit,354nke,I_FRAPPE_CATS,2,Fri May 8 01:26:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, you want dull swords for sparring, but cold steel machetes are decent starters for sharp slabs of carbon steel."
mallninjashit,354nke,biggsbro,2,Fri May 8 02:02:08 2015 UTC,Their swords are meant to be something you can fuck around with that won't break. Pretty much the opposite of a wallhanger.
mallninjashit,354nke,turtleblues,1 point,Fri May 8 00:50:34 2015 UTC,"But they break far too often, at least their larger offerings. A threaded pommel is almost always a bad idea for a zweihander type blade."
mallninjashit,354nke,ZACHtheSEAL,6,Fri May 8 00:52:52 2015 UTC,"I picked up the 6"" ti-lite for cheap a while back.  It's completely silly and impractical, but at least it seems well made and durable. If i'm ever cornered by a side of beef or a pork shoulder in a dark alley i think i'm set...."
mallninjashit,354nke,Codeworks,5,Fri May 8 21:57:04 2015 UTC,http://www.coldsteel.com/Category/40_1/Battle_Shades.aspx  This might be a bit more in question.
mallninjashit,354nke,thepainteddoor,5,Fri May 8 01:33:02 2015 UTC,Cold steel also makes probably the highest quality tomahawks out there IMO

mallninjashit,354nke,wantonballbag,9,Sat May 30 12:21:44 2015 UTC,Cold Steel actually makes semi decent blades... they're just kind of tacticool.
mallninjashit,354nke,Boomerkuwanga,3,Thu May 7 05:30:49 2015 UTC,"I have that, I love it. Feels like a west side story knife. The original mall ninjas. It's pretty damn solid."
mallninjashit,354nke,biggsbro,3,Thu May 7 07:22:19 2015 UTC,"They make pretty practical stuff too.  I've been using a Cold Steel SRK as my survival knife for many years, and it's been great."
mallninjashit,354nke,RaptorFire22,3,Thu May 7 17:14:10 2015 UTC,Switchblade videos. 4 minutes long and 3 seconds of it are the damn thing actually opening. We need to see the action damn it.
mallninjashit,354nke,professorbooty25,3,Thu May 7 18:22:22 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with that at all. They have a decent amount of mall ninja type stuff, but most of their knives and swords are tough as nails and well designed. I carried a lawman for years. One of the best sub-$100 knives I ever owned."
mallninjashit,354nke,Greybear93,2,Wed May 13 12:47:26 2015 UTC,Their knives are pretty high quality though!
mallninjashit,354nke,SirWibberdywib,2,Fri May 8 01:25:50 2015 UTC,I have one of those. I've had it for about 2 years and used the hell out of it. Got it from a BX in Southwest Asia.
