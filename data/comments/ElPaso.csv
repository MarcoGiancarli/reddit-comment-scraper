ElPaso,3e0ozo,DartosMD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:11:37 2015 UTC,"Comparing the city investment and involvement with the ballpark to a public utility is somewhat misleading. The team and the ballpark only appeals to a relatively small population in El Paso. In contrast, the adoption and use of broadband home internet is 70% according to a 2013 Pew Research survey (although this did drop to about 50% or lower for hispanics, low income, or those with no high school  diploma). As a public utility however, the idea is worth a consideration."

The only problem i currently have is the availability of a good ISP.  Luckily i was able to get ultimate from Time Warner.  What i didnt like is that in some cities Ultimate for the same price is double the speed which i think is illegal.

I'm of the opinion that legalization would help curb the crime rates, deter importation, raise state revenue, overall wealth and create more jobs. It should not be a wild card my friend, but I suppose it is of unpopular opinion."
ElPaso,3dt04r,Dragon_jones,4,Sun Jul 19 05:24:23 2015 UTC,"I am not against it at all. It's just that since we have the I-10 and El Paso is in the middle of the country it is used as a main importation point because from here you can either go easy, west and north. Now, we are really ducking close to mexico so at this point we would have to consider exportation as well. People from mexico would then be able to come and take it over there, which I think it would not affect us in the least minimum, but I don't know how their government would take it.  I guess you can take Walmart from Cielo Vista as an example, a lot of people from mexico go there and take the food over there, and it helps us economically at least, but as a consequence their government can now confiscate the food or charge them extra to import it."
ElPaso,3dt04r,Dragon_jones,0,Sun Jul 19 05:36:20 2015 UTC,"OK, if I'm following correctly your concerned for the welfare of the Mexican nationals. They come and help us economically by shopping here, and risk fines and imprisonment as well as confiscation? That is concerning, especially if I had family there. But I do not see the relation between legalization here and the Mexicans. Aside from the state not finding marijuana a positive contribution to society, which is well understood. Never put you on the chopping block amigo, just looking for some back and forth."
ElPaso,3dt04r,JustChillingReviews,2,Sun Jul 19 05:48:41 2015 UTC,"Nah it's cool, I am not concerned for the mexicans themselves, I'm just saying that the two governments work together on a lot of things, and I don't know how that would change, they could either support us or go against us (thus the wild car reference). It is no secret that drugs have changed that country and stand against it. At least on the record, off the record it could be something else.  It would be dope as hell if it was legalised."

I would like to see the stigma of marijuana being a ""gateway drug"" lifted. Pharmaceutical companies may not want you or I to have access to this plant because they make make a lot of money selling you drugs. The doctors get kickbacks for prescribing big pharmas drug.   The war on drugs is costing the taxpayers money. That's a war that will never be won, but will continue to weigh us down. The war takes nonviolent offenders, first time offenders and imprisons them, labels them users and makes it incredibly difficult to reinstate them back into the workforce. The prisons cost you and I money as well, how many inmates do you think are there for nonviolent drug related offenses?  Are you against legislation here in Texas, or is this just something you would not care to pursue regardless.

Hell, it'd be pretty fun if we did a different themed meetup every month. Not all out cosplay but subtle enough that we can recognize each other from the rest of the bar patrons and still have fun. The problem is organization usually falls through or they don't see the details due to the post being buried due to lack of upvotes. I recommend making some sort of group chat thing that relays details of each meetup. Or perhaps encouraging people to get the meetup app and do it through there since it alerts your email and whatnot."

Cavenders charges full retail price. Cowtown is the Lucchese factory store. Justin Brands/Tony Lama Outlets sell mostly factory defects but also allow you to order/purchase non defective boots and will ship them to you. On top of that list there's probably another 10 or more boot manufacturer's in the El Paso area.

There is also an ok little shop in the entrance as well.  Get on Montana Blvd going east.  Keep going until you see the American Eagle Paintball which is the main entrance.

ElPaso,3bxhpm,ZeeX10,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:21:28 2015 UTC,"The web design of that last site is pretty horrible.  If you stay by UTEP you kinda split the difference between the east side and the west, though you're closer to the west side. But you're closer to the museums and stuff of downtown.   Also as far as I know the only waterpark in EP is Wet n Wild, the one in that hotel is likely just a slide.   If you stay by the airport you're close to both Cielo Vista and Basset malls which both have theaters(IMAX at basset).  Pretty sure I've been to the Wyndham, it was alright though I don't remember too much as when I went I was more preoccupied with the person in the room than everything else."

Along the river is also quite nice. You can start near the casino and go all the way up to nm and back. Or at least as much of that as you want to.

Lots of people parked in empty lots on the service road of US54 before you get to Wal-Mart there, but that might be built on, I haven't been in a few years.
