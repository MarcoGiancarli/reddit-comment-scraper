web_design,3e2bgq,unkemt,4,Tue Jul 21 12:53:35 2015 UTC,"In your guys' experience, do you buy the fonts and have them forever, or is that something the client should pay for?   both, you buy a ""print/computer"" licence to use them on your computer and the client pays a web licence to display them on his website (whether he does it through your or directly buys it himself), this is true for most web font licences (but there are exceptions, check the licence of that very font for an accurate answer ;) ).  In your particular case I wouldn't buy the fonts, I'd design the website with a similar looking free font and set it as a fallback (putting the wanted font ready in the CSS) and explain my friend he should buy a licence of the font if he wants to use it and that I'd gladly edit the link whenever he does.   I don't think there will be a need for him to edit content regularly through a CMS or something like that.   99% of the time it's wrong to assume that, even if he told you he won't edit the content regularly it's not safe to assume that he won't, even if he really really doesn't want to edit the content regularly you'll be glad to have a CMS whenever he does.   Should I give him the files and let him worry about getting the domain? I think he's prepared to do that, but I don't know where my responsibilities end and his begin   I think it's way simpler that you let him handle this, that way you don't have to worry about renewing it, etc. That doesn't mean you can't help him and sit next to him when he does. Then ask him for the FTP and hosting access (that he can change later if he wants) to upload the files, set redirections, etc. (you shouldn't probably let him do that himself)  Now for training purpose you could buy it for him, there are ways to buy a domain and hosting for a third party, but it might vary depending on the TLD (some TLDs have specific rules regarding content but also the identity of the owner/publisher/editor, etc.) and the registrar/hosting company (some will require you set a reseller account for instance, other will just let you fill a form with the owner information). I'm not being familiar with US registrars so I won't try and help on that topic.   But do not buy the domain and hosting in your name, you could be held responsible for the content that will be uploaded on that website, even if it gets hacked or if your friend goes crazy and joins ISIS (at least in some countries, I don't know for the US sorry)."
web_design,3e2bgq,UltraChilly,2,Tue Jul 21 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"I usually use Google Web Fonts for text, but if you need the fonts for images, then you will have to purchase them. I've encouraged clients to purchase fonts themselves if they want them. Then I have them anyway once they send it to me to use.  You'll need to setup your business process and decide if you'll provide domains, hosting, maintenance, etc. I take the approach of offering a set package to keep my life simple. If you do something different for each client, things can get complicated. I doubt many clients would know what to do if you just hand over the website files. That's why they are paying a web designer."
web_design,3e2bgq,webeminence,2,Tue Jul 21 15:18:32 2015 UTC,"Then I have them anyway once they send it to me to use.   YSK this is not legal though. Most font licenses nowadays specifically say each computer/user should have its own license. And even if they buy several licenses, bulk purchases are often limited to employees of the company.   So most of the times they're not allowed to send you the font. (but it varies from one foundry to another)   But I agree you should not have to buy it from your pocket if the client requires a very specific font (if he requires a classic and you don't have it it's different though). In this kind of case I buy the font but add it to the price.  PS : since I'm on the subject, YSK that a lot of foundries now sell different (and not overlapping) licenses depending on the use. You could end up paying the same font several times if it's used in print, for the web or imbedded in an app. It's not ok to use fontsquirrel to embed desktop fonts on a website, might as well download it illegally.  Subscription-based font services like Typekit are a good alternative/complement to buying fonts one by one."

There are some really expensive ones.  But if your client wants specific font for web use you may try to find a compromise and suggest looking at the Google fonts - there might be a font very similar to the paid one he wants.

web_design,3e3pay,Dokkarlak,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:08:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. Yea, I can actually explain that.  As far as I understand it, GIF usually just draws over the rectangular area which changed from one frame to the next. If there is a transparent palette entry, it can encode all pixels which did not change inside this area as transparent.  The problem is that it can't paint with transparency. The transparent pixels are skipped. What it can do, however, is dispose (discard) the stuff which was previously drawn. Unfortunately, this means that the next frame needs to contain some of the stuff which was in the previous one.  ImageMagick's documentation has some examples:  http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/anim_basics/#dispose  Edit:  Here is how the frames of the opaque one look like: http://i.imgur.com/SdOKmjU.gif  As you can see, each one is just a bounding rect which contains the differences."

Some things though:  Try to give all common elements the same class instead of just giving them all unique ones.  Try to avoid IDs, they can make CSS selecting confusing.  When using a placeholder in the href of an a tag, use '#'.  Try not to repeat yourself in CSS. When you have multiple elements using the same styles select them with commas:  .element1, .element2, .element3 { styles }  I used Jquery for that fork, look into what that can offer you before you get into Javascript. It's much easier and has many shortcuts you will find useful.  The effect you're after here is called an accordion, maybe look for some pre existing ones you can edit.

web_design,3e2c0t,jbrdc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:29:16 2015 UTC,I'm not a web designer but I've got enough sense to put together a web page.  I met a guy yesterday that does web design and he was saying that I should convert the main site over to Wordpress.  Right now only the blog portion is running on WP.  I kind of like the minimalist approach but I realize that aesthetics are important.  Looking for some guidance.
web_design,3e2c0t,groundxaero,2,Tue Jul 21 12:31:07 2015 UTC,It all depends on what converting it to WP gains you in your use case.   Are you going to be updating content on the site regularly? Are you going to want to add new pages often? Are you going to be handing off the content updates to people that have no clue about what an HTML page or FTP is?   Those are all cases where you'd probably want to use Wordpress for ease of management / client satisfaction.  If none of the above is true then I ask you how would YOU benefit from putting more work in to convert your template to a WP theme?
web_design,3e2c0t,groundxaero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:36 2015 UTC,"Content/Links on the main page are updated quite frequently (several times daily).  Pages, not so much.  Handing off to folks without HTML/FTP experience, maybe one day but not any time soon.  I feel like I've got a fairly good system now.  I plug in a URL and text into a form on my local machine (with optional image filename and alt text) and let javascript spit out the HTML <a> and <img> tags.  Maybe WP could make that process more efficient but not by much and I like having the fine-grained control that hacking up HTML offers.  I feel like I could add aesthetic flourishes to ""pretty it up"" without WP, I just don't have any idea what direction I want to go in regarding that, and I'm worried about sacrificing performance/page load speed for the sake of making it pretty.  I want the focus to be on the content more than my page, which may be foolish, but it's how I feel."
web_design,3e2akb,simpletoad,2,Tue Jul 21 12:14:46 2015 UTC,Imagine saving lots of different sized versions of an image in a .tar file.  An ico is like that.
web_design,3e2akb,uk_randomer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:18 2015 UTC,"It's a Windows standard that stores multiple file sizes and color depths in one file. They should only ever be used for icons (and even now most browsers support using png for favicons, which is the only time you will use them in web design so it's not really a big thing anymore). That said if you're looking for images/icons that will look good at any size and any resolution, always go SVG."
web_design,3e2akb,tgeek373,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:49:44 2015 UTC,"An ICO file is a special image format developed by Microsoft for the purpose of storing program icons. Program icons often need to be displayed at different sizes, such as 16x16 pixels in a list view or 32x32 on the desktop. The ICO file format essentially allows for these different sized icons to be saved into a single file.  How does it work? Well the file format itself is quite simple. At the start of the file you have the number of different images present in the ICO file. Then for each image, you have the image's width and height (limited to 256 pixels) and the image data, which may either be a BMP or PNG format. There's some other information stored regarding the image's colour palette (if it uses one) and bit depth, although this is mostly irrelevant these days as most icons are stored in 32-bit full color. Keep in mind that the ICO file format was first used in Windows 1.0 back in 1985, so legacy features such as color palettes and monochrome images aren't surprising.  So why are ICO files used for favicons on websites? Well, Microsoft 'invented' the favicon back when Internet Explorer 5 came out in 1999. If a website was bookmarked, the browser would request the file favicon.ico in the site's root directory to display in the bookmarks menu and address bar. Internet Explorer all the way up to version 10 only supported ICO files to be used as the favicon, although now Internet Explorer 11 and other browsers support the use of other image formats such as PNG and GIF."

That's why UI/UX is a huge job right now.  There are new rules/recommendations you'd have to learn. Like how everyone in their first year of design learns the rules of making a poster (big type it's far away) there are things we've learned in the internets short life, like that filling out a form with left/right columns can lower its efficiency over a form where each input is on a separate line."

The biggest thing is that you can't make assumptions on what exactly the user will see. In print, you can control the exact crop of that image and the exact placement of your type.   On the web? You can't. A majority of sites are responsive, and even those that aren't probably still have fluid elements to them. Different browsers will render your type differently. Even color you can't control as much because you have no idea what one's monitor might be like.   So you need to just give up some of that control or you'll drive your developer crazy. The more you think in terms of how a design will adapt the better."
web_design,3e1431,abbotleather,11,Tue Jul 21 03:43:18 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the grain of everyone's recommendations and say don't learn any frameworks.  You feel like you're drowning because you lack the understanding of the basics that these frameworks are built upon so you're attempting to jump head first into the deep end. Starting with a framework will definitely make building a website easier for you once you get your head wrapped around how it works, but I think that's a bad learning technique.  It's about like the progression of learning math in school; A lot of people feel lost and struggle because they're able to solve equations when they're told how it should be done, but what's vastly more important is the understanding of the core concepts. Jumping ahead makes you feel lost even though you're able to complete it.  Super simplified metaphor:  In geometry a lot of people know a2 + b2 = c2 for triangles. But they don't understand the actual geometry behind the equation.  Using a framework is a bit like using your calculator to get ""c"" but not understanding how you arrived there. Which as you learn more advanced things only compounds your confusion."

web_design,3e1431,Thirdsun,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"While HTML/CSS is obviously the basic foundation of web design, I'd recommend learning Rails, or to a lesser degree Django, as it gives you a modern, mature and very complete set of tools to build almost anything. I'm not a fan of JS-heavy single page apps, but if you're looking into that I'd save that for later - there are major downsides to these kind of apps in my opinion.  If you really want to stick to php (you mentioned it in another comment), take a look at Laravel, it's close to Rails, but again - why not prefer the original?  To get up and running a css framework like Bootstrap helps, but don't rely on it when you become more confident - it's a lot of overhead and if possible you should develop your own look and probably much smaller css toolbelt."

Tech comes and goes, and only a small part of it becomes ingrained with what is considered important to web design.  Instead, I'd recommend learning the lowest common denominators really well. Get to know what is already available in the standards. Whenever you come across something new, skim over the related methods, properties and parameters and play with them to understand them. MDN's docs are incredibly useful for this.  Then, when you notice you're doing repetitive tasks, seek out ways to automate them; nobody wants to do the same things over and over again. Look at other people's code and see how they've solved similar problems. Try things out, see what works for you.  Then again, it's good to keep an eye on the hip new trends, even if you never bothered to learn all of them. There are some very useful things around, which you might not even know you're missing if you go full Lone Wolf.  As for practical recommendations;   I've personally found SASS to be a big productivity booster regarding CSS Git is damn useful for never losing any work Facebook's React seems like a really smart way to build bigger web apps LiveReload has saved my F5 key from wearing down   But I also use Guard and Bundler to quickly set some of these things up    All of the above have plenty of alternatives, and nobody can objectively say which ones are best. Tools are always a matter of personal preference.  You could also use BuiltWith to find out what tech a particular website is using."

Easily. Including just sending a DMCA straight to your host-provider and having them shut down your site.  Here's a reference to fair use. Which is the copyright law that allow some websites to use their images. e.g. news blogs.  The biggest point to note is that failure to enforce your trademark actually jeopardizes your ability later in court to protect it. For this reason Apple will actively seek out people using their trademark and enforce it.  In the end, even if you think you fall under fair-use protection, it won't protect you incase they decide to try and stop you from using their content, because you don't have a corporate team of lawyers."

web_design,3dvdqk,ihopeudie,33,Sun Jul 19 23:25:51 2015 UTC,"The ""No Captcha ReCAPTCHA"" as Google calls it (NCRC since it's a mouthful) is a very clever piece of engineering that utilizes pretty much every available piece of information about your browser. Here's the fallback scheme:   NCRC tries to show the ""not a robot"" checkbox assuming you have a modern browser with JS enabled. It tracks a variety of factors including cursor behavior, a browser fingerprint, and (crucially) other Google cookies. This is made possible by hosting the NCRC script on the google.com, allowing it first-party cookie access to all other Google services. Because of this, if you are logged in and active on other Google services, you will almost always pass the robot check with no intervention. If you block cookies, have no cookies, or are just on a fresh machine with no fingerprint, NCRC will show one of several ""challenge tasks."" These include your standard fuzzy-word CAPTCHA and a picture-matching task (e.g. choose the airplane from this grid of pictures). If you have JS disabled, it will fallback to an iframe of https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/fallback which contains the NCRC. If your browser doesn't support the NCRC script, it will fallback to the regular CAPTCHA with a standard form entry."
web_design,3dvdqk,redct,2,Mon Jul 20 01:53:12 2015 UTC,"If you have JS disabled, it will fallback to an iframe of https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/fallback which contains the NCRC.   Only if you set up the CAPTCHA to use it. By default it's not included, you have to look in the FAQ for the details.  And the non-JS version is pretty lame, you do the thing in the iframe, then you have to copy and paste the super long code into the box on the real form."

No. If someone else has already done the heavy lifting for you, then for Pete's sake use the code that has been tested to work!  If you're making something and need a captcha, go grab reCAPTCHA.

Rather, it demonstrates why you must always learn about a given technology or paradigm before implementing it. Whether you are vetting someone else's code/project to see if it does a good job, or designing you own, you must first learn how and why X works.  For all we know Lifehacker did not even design their captcha. It looks to me like they might be using a third party captcha system based on the URL.

Items vertically centered, shadows, fonts galore and my favorite items aligned as if they are on a piece of paper and not an ever changing medium.  Wooo now that I got that off my chest...  What you will find with web is, items need to be predictable.  You don't want to use magic numbers in your code because the designer decided that this one list is indented 25 more pixels than the rest of them because they like the look.   We can do a lot more with CSS3 these days but load times and search engines play a big part into how you design.  So I recommend you learn the following   Learn a frame work like bootstrap or foundation.  Design based on their rules to get use to the rigidity of web design Learn to code a little.  Understanding how the pages are built makes a huge difference and more than likely you'll be asked to code at some point.   Build Mobile First.  Design for a phone and then build up to desktop.

web_design,3dzn99,jarvispeen,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:30 2015 UTC,"in the process of deciding if I want to have a WordPress them or find a student to help code it from scratch!   You should map out the purpose and requirements of a website before deciding which tools to use. Fundamentally, what should people do, or what can they expect when they arrive?   Generally, if you plan on updating content, which is the vast majority of sites for an organization, you should not code from scratch.   have you used Adobe Muse and if so is it a powerful tool?   IMO, Muse is a good idea, but a poor execution. Ideally, it would act as a much needed bridge between PhotoShop and code. But it can only generate code in one direction. Meaning, you can't use your own code or project files,  which is the fatal flaw in most modern GUI designers. It could potentially work as a quick prototype tool, but that's about it.   I would recommend not making the same mistake many designers/beginners make, which is searching for the perfect look first, and then figuring out how to cram all of your content into it.   Map out a strategy. Map out the requirements in terms of pages required (Information Architecture), then organize the information, then figure out how that information might change or grow over time. For instance, will you need to continually add to menu items? That will change the structure of your navigation.  Match all of this to realistic resources for maintenance. It's common to think you're actually going to find the energy to update a blog or organization news feed, and never do. Keep in mind the kind of talent you have for those updates. Don't build a fancy slider with a graphic designer who will exit after its built, and leave the remaining ""clip art crew"" to update with new slides.  Once this is all organized, the size and complexity of your site will be more apparent. The priority of your content will be more clear, and the features and/or tools which you require will become more apparent; or at least you can start researching how to match your requirements with product or talent strengths."

Unfortunately, I've only worked with the Atlas Ad Serving System and Double-Click system. Each one of those had pre-made HTML5 and Flash templates you could use. Perhaps Google does as well? Also, Actionscript 3.0 is very similar to Javascript so if you can code in AS you'll be able to use Javascript. To take it a step further, if you used the Greensock Actionscript stuff for coding tweens, they converted all of it to Javascript so you can chain animations easier and don't have to add in delays."

When they say ""HTML5 is the new Flash"" they certainly mean paired with CSS and JavaScript.  There's just no other way.  Swiffy seems to work fine if you don't have complex shape data (gradients etc.) and if filesize isn't an issue. I've found on a ~120kb creative, swiffy exports at around 240kb.  Personally, I use GWD to build a template that prefabs things like the DC Enablers, and then I crack open my favourite text editor, and code all the animations/build the Dom.  I use Greensock for animations, which is an incredibly powerful JavaScript library. They've also got a flash API.  All in all - HTML5 banners are most definitely the future, but until most browsers support things like clipping paths and similar features to get complex shapes and effects like you can on flash, Flash will still have its place."

Should I be coupling Greensock into that somehow?

web_design,3dzyqq,morguefile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:44:06 2015 UTC,"I work for McCann and these past two weeks all clients are moving completely to HTML5. Flash has gotten some very bad press this past month and clients are going back and revising their media buys. Starting is September flash will be disabled by default in Chrome so you will no longer be building display ads in flash.  The problem with swiffy is it generates machine code, you are still developing in flash for updates and publishers right now are still sticking to flash specs (40K initial load for standards) which means your code has to be very lean. Swiffy isn't a terrible choice but it is also not ideal. Edge uses canvas and is also not bad but has the same problems.  I am not sure about adwords but for DCS you definitely do not need GWD. Its very cool but still in BETA. You have to check the specs for publishers and DCS, there is a limit to number of files you can include, use of 4th party vendor calls (CDNs), font use is very different and also the way k count is calculated. HTML5 banners is a very different animal then flash and the landscape with media agencies and publishers is the wild wild west.   You can animate with CSS3 or pure JS, and or utilize the canvas element. We avoid using jquery, mostly greensock if we can fit it and use css sprite sheets, optimize images with kraken.io or tinypng.com.  I am currently working on a summary of my research for McCann after having spoke to a lot of rich media vendors including google if anyone is interested.

Then those other folks can just pick an element - say, a tab panel or an error message - copy and paste it into the project, and know that it'll look great.  It takes the load off of other developers, because they don't have to analyze the CSS and try to make decisions about how things ought to look, and it helps keep the design consistent going forward, when other designers join the team and need an overview of the current style guidelines."

As to why IE (and also FireFox) is not showing the image; it shouldn't show the image as it's not the right syntax, chrome tends to be flexible with css syntax most of the times."

web_design,3dy71m,vousvisual,3,Mon Jul 20 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"You can build Android applications on Windows or Mac, and purchase relatively cheap devices to test your apps on. And as Android continues to dominate the market share, more mobile developers are choosing to get started on Android than iOS.   On your Mac, you can create iOS applications that run on the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch with Objective-C. Objective-C is Apple’s abstraction of C with influences of Smalltalk used primarily for building iOS and Mac applications.  Because there is less fragmentation on iOS compared to Android, it’s easier to create a one-size-fits-all application for the App Store than Google Play."

web_design,3dy71m,Velsheda,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:01:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I fully understand your question, but...  I'm an iOS user and prefer iOS, but I like the material design concept better. I think it's more interesting and more defined. However, I would say 95% of people design for iOS first, in which case, if you do freelance design, iOS will probably get you more business. While I like using iOS, I don't agree with all their principals and concepts (such as only using tab menus on the bottom). I also think their ""flat design"" can sometimes look unfinished and empty. Based on new Apple Music app, it looks like they're gearing towards smaller fonts/buttons in their designs and their designs have become much more complicated. Or maybe they've simply realized that their bottom tabs philosophy is very limiting for complex apps (like the new apple music) and therefore they have to make this complex design just to stay with their own philosophy. Anyway, I'm not sure if that helped, but basically if you're looking for which design platform will get you more business, then I think it's iOS. In terms of software, I'd recommend Sketch if you have a Macbook (only available for OSX)."

web_design,3dxhkh,tgeek373,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:20:22 2015 UTC,Could You tell me more about other ways to present a design to a client?
web_design,3dxhkh,tgeek373,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:25:11 2015 UTC,"There are lots of great options that will show how your site will display on all different screen sizes. Some online services will even load your site on a bunch of different widths and export it to an image file with wireframes of desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. This will give the client a good idea of how their site will render on all kinds of devices. Of course, in order to use these services your site has to be responsive... If it's not then you really shouldn't be presenting ideas to clients anyways. I can try to get back with you with some examples of these services after I get some sleep, but I'm on mobile right now... Any other questions, feel free to ask!"
web_design,3dxhkh,walkities,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:38:51 2015 UTC,If the design is done already why not just host it on your own server/account and then show them that way?  This way they'll know exactly what they're getting and you can transfer or change it to their domain when they pay you.  On the flip side you could keep it on your server after they pay you and charge monthly/annual hosting feeds for a small passive income. That's what I do and while it's not huge it still makes about 4k annually for really not having to do much.

web_design,3dwizh,jumpjumpdie,7,Mon Jul 20 03:38:08 2015 UTC,"Your trusted friend isn't giving you the detailed and full answer you deserve. You need to learn HTML & CSS before you learn anything else. If you suck at those two things, using and customising a CMS is really going to be difficult. You will be able to fumble through basic things probably but you will have issues with styling very quickly.  Also a ""graphics driven"" site sounds dodgy. It sounds like you are saying you are going to use graphics for as much of the site as you can. This is really bad practise as search engines can't read the text within images.

web_design,3dwizh,TelFiRE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:26:40 2015 UTC,"PHP is good to learn yes. JavaScript is front end (traditionally anyway) while PHP is back-end.

web_design,3dwizh,TheBigLewinski,-1,Mon Jul 20 13:02:16 2015 UTC,"Drupal. If you're just now getting into this, get into Drupal 8, specifically. It has yet to be released, but release is imminent, as some companies are already using it in its beta form.   It's literally over 75% new code from Drupal 7, with many lessons of the previous version applied (read: modern). It's built on standards which are useful toward learning PHP in general, instead of just Drupal, which was a major complaint of Drupal 7.  WordPress, on the other hand, is hell bent on backward compatibility, and as a result is becoming an increasingly antiquated platform for development.   The strategy is somewhat understandable, as its enormous community has become one of its defining assets. If you need a brochure site or simple blog, WordPress is still a solid choice for going from ""want a website"" to ""have a website"" quickly.    Which is best for me to succeed in building my site easier?   That depends. WordPress is easier to get up and running, but you run into limitations quickly. Drupal has a bigger learning curve, but once you learn some concepts, you can then do more complicated things easier than you could with WordPress.   which CMS is more promising to invest time into so I can continue to use it in the long term future?    I don't think demand will fizzle out for either one in the foreseeable future, but different people will be knocking on your door. Generally -save for successful theme/template sales on ThemeForest- your pay will be higher with Drupal, especially with 8. Drupal currently plays in a different market than WordPress, and it will become even more distinct with 8.   Drupal and WordPress are both popular, open source CMSs but they're different products. WordPress is consumer level, the point-and-shoot camera, while Drupal is the business product; the SLR."

web_design,3dwizh,TheBigLewinski,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:41:53 2015 UTC,"You're pushing a platform, touting a 75% overhaul in it's codebase. That's a big red flag right there.    Code has a life cycle, and the willingness to rebuild it -to modernize it- is a necessity, not a red flag. It really doesn't matter if the code was absolutely flawlessly brilliant when it was written. The landscape has changed.  Drupal 7 was released in 2011, after nearly 3 years of work. That puts us back to 2009 when the project was started. Retina display wasn't a thing, responsive wasn't a thing. We didn't even have HTML5! XHTML transitional was still largely the standard, PHP 5.3 was just released, and it's not even supported any more. People were still calling Jobs a lunatic for refusing to put the omnipresent Flash on the new iPhone. You get the point.   Nearly everything built in that era had to be rethought. If you built a website that you started building in 2009, it should probably be 75% new code in order to be modernized. A CMS is no different. It's not about ""oops we screwed up"" it's about not getting stale in the face of change. It's wise.    Your argument is largely ""Drupal got better, give it a chance""   Well, yes, it did get better. You can make something better without the previous version being shit. I wouldn't start with 7 now, because its at the tail end of it's lifespan. Every codebase has a lifespan.   ^ I'd love to see a source/some reasoning on this   You can get it from the horses mouth, at the WordPress blog, where they state ""WordPress strives to never break backwards compatibility.""   WordPress was built to PHP 5.2 standards and PHP 7 will be out by the end of this year. It will be nearly twice as fast by some measurements. Will WordPress be ready? Drupal 8 will.   you run into imitations quickly   Yes, I do. Because I've worked with other CMSs which do much more. The only way to believe WordPress does everything is to have lived solely inside the WordPress bubble.    Evidence/reasoning please?   That's a topic all by itself. Drush (Command line management), Views (Query builder), Image Styles (automatic image generation, like batch PS runs) Rules (Heavily customizable reactions to events which integrate with everything), Features (deployment tools), Multi-domain tools, translation tools, far more robust taxonomy. Content types are built in, so every module understands/supports it. That's before getting to API comparisons...  and all of that is Drupal 7."

Microsoft's IIS makes up the remaining 13% of the 95%, and all of them can be used to serve a PHP / MySQL based CMS like Drupal or Wordpress."
web_design,3dwizh,RotationSurgeon,-4,Mon Jul 20 03:39:57 2015 UTC,"I have been designing websites since I was 12 years old. Since then I have mastered 6 different programming languages and 4 different web frameworks. Web development is a very valuable skill because the browser is the single most used application on a computer and its potential unlimited. It's a skill that's in high demand in the modern economy and is among the most well paid professions with infinite potential.  Here are 10 steps to becoming a full stack web developer. (a full stack web developers are what we call people who are architect of the world wide web.)  Step 1. Buy shared hosting on godaddy, it costs like 5 bucks a month and comes with a free domain. Make sure your host supports php. All godaddy starter packs do.  This will also as an incentive to learn web design, well you have the space to host it and the cool domain to reach it. Why not?  Step 2. Learn HTML.  HTML is the backbone of your website. Not knowing html is like learning how to sky dive without knowing how gravity works.   Learn: what html, head and body tags how to format text what divs and tables are  Good Resource: http://w3schoola.com/  Step 3. Learn CSS.  All websites would look like text typed up on a notepad without css. CSS is the color on your canvas, it helps you structure and style your website. Don't really try to learn all syntax. Mastering CSS is all about practice. It's very intuitive and inspect element on Google chrome is your best friend. Inspect element on a website by right clicking and chrome will let you style the CSS if any website according to your wildest fantasies.   Go through the CSS section on http://w3schools.com/  Step 4. Learn about WordPress WordPress is hands down the best thing to happen to novice web developers. Go to http://wordpress.org. learn everything you need to know about its famous 5-minute install which is basically following instructions. You have to use your brand new server setup. The installation will seem magical the first time. Hit me up if you don't understand this part. I feel like introducing people to WordPress is a service to mankind.   Consider it as a gateway drug to an addiction that is web design and the money you make from it.  Step 5. Make WordPress websites  Make as many wordpress websites as you can. Imagine all the businesses that need a website. Conjure an imaginary company that wants you to make a website for them. Note down the imaginary requirements for their websites to be readable on both mobile and desktop. Make one for a law firm, another for a non-profit in Africa and another for yourself. Learn the difference.  Learn what themes and plugins are. Hacj away at their codes. Install 20 plugins on your website and then wonder why it takes 3 minutes to load.  Step 6. Going further  Nos that you know what basic web design is learn JavaScript. JavaScript makes your website magical, things fly around and change their size. This is what makes your website responsive. Learn how to use jquery and put sliders on your website. Just copy, paste, edit, notice the change.  Also learn basic Photoshop or GIMP so that you can make fancy logos by copy pasting pngs from Google or make a nice custom background parrern.  Step 7.(optional) Become lvl 1000 webmaster  Learn python/Ruby. And then go on learn Django or Rails. Just google those terms and put learn in front of it. These will help you create powerful websites like Reddit and Instagram.  Step 8. Learn what SEO is.  Google internet marketing strategies.  Realise that Content > Everything.  Step 9. Sell yourself.  Go to fiverr create a gig or better go to a friend/family and make a website for them. Say that you'll spend 20 hours to create a website for 5 bucks. Add real customers to your portfolio. When you have 10 businesses on your portfolio, people will start trusting you with their money.  Go make a website for the local restaurant down the street. Offer to help them get on Wikipedia (its pretty easy to learn, its just 4 reference websites) charge them $500 for it. They'll pay you gladly.  Step 10. Mastering the art.  Slowly as you master the art, start looking for bigger better projects. Make your own web service. Create something beautiful out of nothing. Become empowered.  Inbox me if you you need help, I find no bigger joy in life than empowering people. I'll have a ticket based help forum and more detailed tutorials on my own website as soon as I find time. Spread the love."

I did small homepages for myself when I was like 15 with html and css only. But almost all knowledge is gone. How long would a normal person need to learn all that? I need money soon.

web_design,3dwizh,dongpal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:10:28 2015 UTC,"In the current market you need to have knowledge about atkeast one dynamic language like php.   To start making money asap. Learn how WordPress works, install it on your own shared hosting and create sample websites using hundreds of pre-made themes out there. You can edit the themes easily and make it your own work by just changing around the code or messing with the theme settings.  After you make some sample websites to practice your skills create a small portfolio, make a profile on fiverr.com and start creating gigs where you help people create landing pages, blogs, etc. You'll start making a small income but you'll have a number of good work to add to your credibility.  After that start approaching small businesses near you. There are definitely some that need an updated modern website.   In web design you learn by practice and observing trends in the work of other people."

web_design,3dwzj9,maximaLz,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:52:17 2015 UTC,"I have been designing websites since I was 12 years old. Since then I have mastered 6 different programming languages and 4 different web frameworks. Web development is a very valuable skill because the browser is the single most used application on a computer and its potential unlimited. It's a skill that's in high demand in the modern economy and is among the most well paid professions with infinite potential.  Here are 10 steps to becoming a full stack web developer. (a full stack web developers are what we call people who are architect of the world wide web.)  Step 1. Buy shared hosting on godaddy, it costs like 5 bucks a month and comes with a free domain. Make sure your host supports php. All godaddy starter packs do.  This will also as an incentive to learn web design, well you have the space to host it and the cool domain to reach it. Why not?  Step 2. Learn HTML.  HTML is the backbone of your website. Not knowing html is like learning how to sky dive without knowing how gravity works.   Learn: what html, head and body tags how to format text what divs and tables are  Good Resource: http://w3schoola.com/  Step 3. Learn CSS.  All websites would look like text typed up on a notepad without css. CSS is the color on your canvas, it helps you structure and style your website. Don't really try to learn all syntax. Mastering CSS is all about practice. It's very intuitive and inspect element on Google chrome is your best friend. Inspect element on a website by right clicking and chrome will let you style the CSS if any website according to your wildest fantasies.   Go through the CSS section on http://w3schools.com/  Step 4. Learn about WordPress WordPress is hands down the best thing to happen to novice web developers. Go to http://wordpress.org. learn everything you need to know about its famous 5-minute install which is basically following instructions. You have to use your brand new server setup. The installation will seem magical the first time. Hit me up if you don't understand this part. I feel like introducing people to WordPress is a service to mankind.   Consider it as a gateway drug to an addiction that is web design and the money you make from it.  Step 5. Make WordPress websites  Make as many wordpress websites as you can. Imagine all the businesses that need a website. Conjure an imaginary company that wants you to make a website for them. Note down the imaginary requirements for their websites to be readable on both mobile and desktop. Make one for a law firm, another for a non-profit in Africa and another for yourself. Learn the difference.  Learn what themes and plugins are. Hacj away at their codes. Install 20 plugins on your website and then wonder why it takes 3 minutes to load.  Step 6. Going further  Nos that you know what basic web design is learn JavaScript. JavaScript makes your website magical, things fly around and change their size. This is what makes your website responsive. Learn how to use jquery and put sliders on your website. Just copy, paste, edit, notice the change.  Also learn basic Photoshop or GIMP so that you can make fancy logos by copy pasting pngs from Google or make a nice custom background parrern.  Step 7.(optional) Become lvl 1000 webmaster  Learn python/Ruby. And then go on learn Django or Rails. Just google those terms and put learn in front of it. These will help you create powerful websites like Reddit and Instagram.  Step 8. Learn what SEO is.  Google internet marketing strategies.  Realise that Content > Everything.  Step 9. Sell yourself.  Go to fiverr create a gig or better go to a friend/family and make a website for them. Say that you'll spend 20 hours to create a website for 5 bucks. Add real customers to your portfolio. When you have 10 businesses on your portfolio, people will start trusting you with their money.  Go make a website for the local restaurant down the street. Offer to help them get on Wikipedia (its pretty easy to learn, its just 4 reference websites) charge them $500 for it. They'll pay you gladly.  Step 10. Mastering the art.  Slowly as you master the art, start looking for bigger better projects. Make your own web service. Create something beautiful out of nothing. Become empowered.  Inbox me if you you need help, I find no bigger joy in life than empowering people. I'll have a ticket based help forum and more detailed tutorials on my own website as soon as I find time. Spread the love."

Hell fucking no. I have no idea where to start but I'll try to give it a go.  Never ever fucking work with your close friends and family and shit, unless it's paid a good enough price. 5 fucking dollars for 20 hours is ridiculous. You'll gain literally no fucking skills doing that, and you'll just end up feeling like a fucking slave. Instead, do fictional projects. Challenge yourself. Do NOT make websites for 5 fucking dollars, you'll fucking educate people to think that webdesign is fucking cheap and is not a real profession. You know what these people will do ? Fucking talk about it to their friends, business owners and generally people they know need a website. They will tell that either they got a cheap website from you, or that websites are fucking cheap. These people will fuck with other pros, waste their time, and basically be a nightmare for everybody else. DO NOT educate people to think that webdesign and web dev is a fucking joke.  As to the $500 website, it's exactly the same fucking argument. Except they have more money to spend than your family and friends because they are a fucking business. They need to know that websites are not bullshit.  Stop fucking minimizing yourself and step the fuck up, do fictional projects, but do not, I repeat DO NOT fucking work for peanuts just under the assumption that you'll get portfolio material. These people that will pay you cheap ? They'll think the whole world is due to them. They'll ask you to correct stuff thousand times before validating the website. They'll make your life a living hell, and the final website won't look anything even close to what you designed at first. You won't even want to put it in your portfolio. You'll waste time. Do fictional projects instead. Create a fictional brand. Design it, design their website. Code it. Get it hosted, get it in your portfolio. That's what you'll be proud of.  One could argue that people won't be willing to spend money on someone who has no real client. Well nobody will want to spend money on somebody who did a shitty website. Because these $5 and $500 websites will be shitty. It'll make your life harder as to find clients because people will talk about how cheap websites are. ""What ? $5000 for a website ? You're fucking nuts man"". That's the kind of shit I heard. That's the kind of shit I went through after doing exactly what you said somebody should do.  And no. Hell fucking no, you should never ever fucking work for peanuts because it will both kill you and the industry. Hell fucking no.  Sorry fur cursing so much.  /rant"

But yes it could be seen as unnecessary bloat, but rather than bloat your pipes and slow down the gulp with something whose only purpose is to remove two targets from your CSS that you could easily delete yourself...  I would probably do something like include it in a partial ""_developer.scss"" inside a separate folder from the rest of my Sass and then just create a gulp task specifically for production that doesn't include that folder in my pipe. Run that when you're ready to release and bam, gone.  (replace Sass with whatever you use)"

If you're using margin or padding, remember that the amount is ADDED to your element size, which will cause them to stack if the result is more than 100% (eg. two 50% images with 5px padding each will result in 100% + 10px)"

One issue I have with dynamic serving is a lot of people assume that just because I'm on desktop, that i'm viewing my browser full screen. Often times I'm multitasking and have my browser open with just a fraction of my full viewport. Sites that require 900px for me to view them on desktop are just annoying, and I avoid them."

Seeing stuff moving around and changing places is very disturbing to some users who might just resize their browser. You need to do fluid the right way, which means do not change the position of elements. If your menu is on the left, do not put it on the right. Maybe that sounds idiot to some of you here, but I've seen this very example way too many times.  Having a neat transition between elements with animations and stuff is good looking, but if your user have no idea what the fuck to do with it, it kills the purpose of using your website.  Also, google guidelines are cool, but they are not some kind of Web bible. Google saying something doesn't mean we should all follow their orders. That's how you kill creativity, and that's why so many people are refusing to go for material design, because it's just the same layout applied to every single thing, which is bad UX."
web_design,3dv003,maximaLz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:11:36 2015 UTC,"I agree, if you do fluid the right way, stuff should very rarely move around. The usual exception though being when horizontally aligned content becomes vertically aligned, that's kind of necessary movement.   we're really getting at the same point here. Proper fluid design doesn't have a ton of multiple 'views' so things shouldn't be shifting. Fluidity is mainly about styling things relatively instead of a absolutely so that content is allowed to flow to the viewport and not forced, if you get what I mean.   and yes, Google design guidelines are only guidelines (not sure why this is being brought up haha) but this thread is meant to discuss best practices."

web_design,3dv003,maximaLz,4,Mon Jul 20 13:28:24 2015 UTC,"Eventually? It has already been decided. Browser detection was the original answer for mobile phones, then responsive took over.   Browser detection makes sense for some companies with significant complexity and enormous resources for development. After a while, the teams becomes so large that splitting the tasks and having them develop in parallel makes sense.   For the rest of us, delivering two (or more) different code bases depending on the device is a problem. Responsive allows websites to be served with a single code base to any device. That's a huge advantage.    Maybe I'm missing something   Sharing and bookmarking. If I bookmark something on my phone, it should simply look right on my desktop when I get home, using the same synced bookmark. Same goes for sharing. If someone posts a link on reddit it should work for every user, without unreliable intervention or redirects.   Using a separate address, or ""m dot"" as they're sometimes called, also increases management and infrastructure complexity. You're running two different websites, each with their own metrics,  traffic demands (increases scaling complexity), maintenance... you're doubling the amount of potential problems by maintaining two different sites/vhosts."

web_design,3dt5ox,MaresDoOrgasm,5,Sun Jul 19 05:16:09 2015 UTC,"I often hear this misconception coming from people who are blurring print and web. DPI/PPI doesn't affect the image when it's displayed on a computer. 500 pixels is 500 pixels. Sometimes I hear things like, ""it's 1024x104 but the resolution is 300 DPI so you can blow up the image."" Statements like that are simply false and it creates confusion. I find this happening in the web design industry and I find it incredibly misinforming. Is this just me?"
web_design,3dt5ox,alejalapeno,2,Sun Jul 19 05:16:59 2015 UTC,"""it's 1024x104 but the resolution is 300 DPI so you can blow up the image.""   Yes this statement is inherently wrong because pixel dimensions denote the image ""size.""  From the article:   there is simply no logical reason why you would need to set its resolution to 72 ppi in Photoshop. Unless you're printing the photo, you don't need to worry about image resolution at all.    Here is a screenshot of the image used as an example in the article, in photoshop, with a resolution of 500 ppi. Saving it out at 500px x 500px it will definitely look exactly the same as your article says, but that ignores the practical application of actually working with the file in photoshop. Note the file size on the bottom, the zoom is 100%, and I can only see a fraction of the image.  If you ever set the W x H in pixels then yes resolution is irrelevant. But if you're working with a different unit for some reason you should be using 72 ppi, that's why photoshop actually grays out the option for pixels in the 'Image Size' dialog menu when you don't have 'Resample' selected."
web_design,3dt5ox,Thykka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:29:43 2015 UTC,"if you're working with a different unit for some reason you should be using 72 ppi   What? I thought we already established that the DPI (or ppi) setting has absolutely no meaning, unless you're printing an image.  The image in your screenshot has been resampled to 500dpi, which means the pixels have been scaled up via interpolation. Saving that out at 500x500 will cause the image to be interpolated again, which also means that it will not look exactly the same as the original 500x500px image. When you view an image in Photoshop at 100% zoom, the image's pixels correspond to the display's pixels 1:1, and dpi has nothing to do with this.  The DPI/PPI you should be using is the DPI/PPI of your output medium. That is, if your image is going to be printed in a glossy magazine, it's DPI should be 300 for Photoshop's metric/imperial measurements to match the actual printed measurements. If you're working on a huge poster, the DPI needs to be lower, depending on the poster's physical dimensions and viewing distance.   that's why photoshop actually grays out the option for pixels in the 'Image Size' dialog menu when you don't have 'Resample' selected.   This is incorrect. The ""resample image"" option, when selected, calculates new pixels in between the original data. The pixel dimensions are thus modified and some data is lost. When you deselect this option, resampling is no longer allowed, and any dpi changes you make only affect the image's metadata. A 500x500px image stays at 500x500px whether you set it to 1dpi or 1000000dpi. It will look exactly the same on-screen, but if you print it it will appear huge or tiny, respectively. Again, this also affects Photoshop's measurements when using imperial or metric units."

web_design,3dt5ox,cooltrainer_rob,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:34:15 2015 UTC,"This is very confused. Only the number of pixels in the image file matters when it's digital. You can't tell a monitor to change its PPI with an image file, so it's meaningless for digital use.  You CAN tell a printer how densely/sparsely it should print an image though, hence that's the only meaningful use of the image DPI setting."
web_design,3dt5ox,Eyger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"Technically they're correct in that a 300 DPI image will blow up better (not good, just better) but its a moot point on the web.

web_design,3dt5ox,MINIMAN10000,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:39:17 2015 UTC,So what ppi should you use then? That isn't made clear IMO.
web_design,3dt5ox,zamadatix,0,Sun Jul 19 14:09:57 2015 UTC,"I don't hang out here much. But printers will have a set dpi so setting the dpi makes sense. Monitors DPI are are variable due to being calculated from common resolutions like 1920x1080 with variable sizes from 21.5"" to 27"" and resolutions from 1360x768 to 3840x2160 so mixing and matching those you get a huge range of DPI. So if DPI is so variable it shouldn't be used as a baseline. So look at what is less elastic I'm unaware of how to get monitor resolution but that would have been helpful but you are left with  Resolution. Because 3840x2160 is a multiple of 1920x1080 I like to use 1920x1080 as the size of an image. Then scale based on what % of the screen you want to cover."
web_design,3dt5ox,uk_randomer,2,Mon Jul 20 01:21:01 2015 UTC,"It made it clear... ""if your images are destined for the web, you don't need to worry about image resolution at all!"". If the data is going to be thrown out when you tell the page where to put the image what does it matter what the thrown out data is? Set it to 42, set it to 100000, don't set it at all and take the default - they are all equally as useless in this case so set it to whatever you want."

web_design,3dt5ox,uk_randomer,0,Sun Jul 19 09:43:40 2015 UTC,Leave bitmaps for actual bitmap data like photographs. Your UI or anything else that you'd care about DPI for should be either a vector graphic or made of styled native elements - it avoids the problem all together and is less hacky than having multiple supported pre-rendered versions of your pages.
