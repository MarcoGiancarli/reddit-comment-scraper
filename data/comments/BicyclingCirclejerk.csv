And the slammed stem which is part of the geometry. You need 73 degrees everywhere. That's geometry. Guess what! 90-73 = 17 degrees. That's the slammed stem geometry. I don't know if I mentioned but geometry is kinda important in these things. I could recommend you a bike with good geometry. The CAAD has very good geometry. Skip the first 9 iterations. The 10 and the 12 have the best geometry. Geometry is very important on a bike frame. I don't know if I wrote it before but it's all about the geometry.  TL;DR: Geometry!

BicyclingCirclejerk,3cy3dd,uluchay,2,Sun Jul 12 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"I generally wear just regular shorts and dry fit t-shirts when I ride, with helmet and gloves, but I'm sure the bike I'm riding is more expensive and better setup than whatever they have. Not that this expensive bike thing actually matters, but, things like what OP said are why I don't even bother with group rides. To me, the kind of person who would partake in a these group rides are generally in the beginning states of ""bike asshole mode"" and I just don't want to deal with them. If I did somehow find myself in a setting where I had people like what OP had talking to me, I would tell them to fuck off with their advice.  I'm not saying ALL cyclists are like this, but, it tends to be the state of affairs from what I see. I just want to ride and have fun my own way, thus the solo only ride attitude. I see this same sort of ""dickish"" attitude in my local cycling subreddit and really, it just turns me off from dealing with anyone involved."
BicyclingCirclejerk,3cxk2c,Sumpm,20,Sat Jul 11 17:52:15 2015 UTC,"Last time something like that happened with me, I just couldn't help myself...I hauled off and clocked the guy right in his jaw. He was wearing a helmet so I knew he wouldn't be hurt too badly, but lucky for him I've been trying to cut gramz so my arms are practically vestigial at this point and he didn't even flinch.   Some asshole cager in an urban-offroad deathUV saw me take the swing and dropped the dime, fortunately, it was bike cops who responded. They lumbered up on a pair of blocky Treks that would have been more at home in a Minecraft game, but were sufficiently cowed by my custom-painted CAAD10 and matching kit to immediately take my side and beg forgiveness for the possibility of even thinking I might be at fault.  My heart rate was starting to drop so I didn't get to see the final outcome, but as I sped off through the red light I glanced back and was pleased to see the stockier officer lift his goddamn Trek over his head like Atlas holding up the Earth. He let out an animal roar and dropped it like a freight truck on that aero-less sucker's head.   I don't think that helmet is going to help you now, Freddie!"

BicyclingCirclejerk,3cxk2c,DMVgunnit,11,Sat Jul 11 18:30:47 2015 UTC,Was it a CAAD10 or a chinese knockoff? I'm guessing the latter.
BicyclingCirclejerk,3cxk2c,tedder42,5,Sat Jul 11 21:59:40 2015 UTC,It wouldn't surprise me.
