Khazars have a chance to be a really dominant power if they conquer the Kazani. Yakutia will definitely stick around, seeing as they are stronger then their neighbors. Mongolia sorta seems like they've seen better days, but they are still huge, so their odds are still good."
civAIgames,3du5ol,misko91,5,Sun Jul 19 15:57:58 2015 UTC,"I think the Soviets are the most effective empire on the map - they've really been crushing it in their wars - but I don't like their odds. Kazan and Khazaria are both looking very strong, and if they decide to quit fighting each other and go after Stalin instead, the Soviets could end up like Rome in the European battle royale. I'm still rooting for them, though."

civAIgames,3dpd30,misko91,2,Sat Jul 18 04:08:17 2015 UTC,Called it. Can't trust the AI to use it's science bonus right.

civAIgames,3dpd30,Captain_Lime,2,Sat Jul 18 18:11:55 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, the next round is all about how quickly the Babylonians can dig in. If the Zulu can rush the Babylonians, then they've got it all set, but if the Babylonians are allowed to dig in, then it's all over for the Zulu. If the Babylonians are able to go STRAIGHT for Writing, get their Great Scientist, and then go for Archery and Masonry, then it'd be looking VERY good for them, even if neither gets the iron. If Ol' Nebby can get a couple cities dug in with him, then points to him. But since that sequence of moves is something that a competent human would do (and not a Civ V AI), I think Shaka's gonna be cleaning the blood off his spear.  That may sound like a euphemism, but I can't tell if the euphemism is better than what I actually said."
civAIgames,3dpd30,forgodandthequeen,2,Sun Jul 19 04:21:36 2015 UTC,"It's also going to be (probably) Shaka constantly on the offensive, and Nebby constantly on the defensive. If Shaka messes up for a few turns, the attack is delayed by several turns. If Nebby messes up for a few turns, he could lose a city."
civAIgames,3doqqq,hare8901,3,Sat Jul 18 00:32:19 2015 UTC,In every game Seddon settles an absurd number of cities. Is that his bias?
civAIgames,3doqqq,sundubujjigae,3,Sat Jul 18 01:57:04 2015 UTC,"New Zealand's UU makes it seem like it is supposed to be a more defensive civilization.

It's particularly notable how far behind the normal tech curve they are (for obvious reasons), at this point in a normal game wed probably be seeing X-coms!  In a particular stupid decision even for an a.i it looks like that great merchant tile between kyoto and abiss ababa is four tiles away from both cities and therefore unworkable."

civAIgames,3dmva2,Iamnotwithouttoads,2,Fri Jul 17 22:25:02 2015 UTC,I'm loving this game. Have been rooting for Catherine since the start of part 2 but I'm disappointed that Catherine didn't take Lisbon and maybe even Ottowa while the Zulus were finishing off Japan.

civAIgames,3dl8iv,TeOr2419,4,Fri Jul 17 05:59:51 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Hiawatha has an expansion value of 9, which is the second highest after Shaka's 11."
civAIgames,3dl8iv,TimGB,6,Fri Jul 17 08:54:39 2015 UTC,Let it be known now that civs with a lower expansion value have won games against civs with a lager one even with a largish gap as in Babylon V. China
civAIgames,3dl8iv,your_favorite_addict,2,Fri Jul 17 12:58:50 2015 UTC,who voted for oda? He never wins in an AI game. certainly not when he likes to turtle and its a domination only game.
civAIgames,3dl8iv,themexics,2,Fri Jul 17 10:55:43 2015 UTC,"He won against the Huns, but they were tied until almost the very end. It wasn't as one-sided as this game."
civAIgames,3dl8iv,misko91,2,Fri Jul 17 12:25:04 2015 UTC,"This was obvious. While Hiawatha may have a shitty UA and buildings, he makes up for it by being relatively intelligent as AIs go. Since they both had an island to themselves, it was inevitable that Hiawatha would expand onto Oda's instead of the other way around, and after that Oda never really had a chance."

civAIgames,3dhxw8,TeOr2419,8,Thu Jul 16 12:30:26 2015 UTC,So I can't help but notice there are 'white walkers' with RPGs and anti-air guns? Any way that could be avoided? I'd call it somewhat immersion breaking.
civAIgames,3dhxw8,an_actual_potato,2,Thu Jul 16 13:52:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah and I kind of feel like the wildlings had literally no shot of ever winning with the white walkers right there. And though that might be interpreted as a reflection of the actual show, it makes for a kind of ""so the entire civ is a buffer and not a contender"" kind of feel. However I do feel as though the ""winter is coming"" snow landscape was a very good handicap on the north's unfair expansion opportunities."
civAIgames,3dhxw8,5566y,2,Thu Jul 16 23:04:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed. There should have been more snow in the north to start, but I'd prefer that the whole white walker situation not play out like the books. The point of this game is to say 'theoretically, who would win the War of the Seven Kings?', not 'how will it work when the whites sweep south and winter buries Westerors'. We know how that works, according to the books, everyone dies. I don't make the game, though, so I can only gripe so much."

civAIgames,3dfzrt,montypissthon,2,Thu Jul 16 02:38:17 2015 UTC,What about an all navel battle series where its a bunch of one tile islands surrounded by oceans?

civAIgames,3dfzrt,GRI23,5,Thu Jul 16 02:49:51 2015 UTC,"Inuit would be overpowered. You might as well use the Master Race: you'd achieve the same effect in less time.  Come on, give poor Venice something."
civAIgames,3dfzrt,ClassyAmoeba,3,Thu Jul 16 03:55:07 2015 UTC,How come no civs have produced settlers? Is that because the AI sees no places that are worthwhile to settle?

civAIgames,3d3gou,LacsiraxAriscal,2,Thu Jul 16 01:21:48 2015 UTC,"This is really great. Rooting for Maori although the Sami and the Thracians are looking strong in that northern corner. I think that the forest in the middle of the largest continent where the Tuscans are should be named the Forest of Bones based on the amount of battles that have taken place there. I agree with your comment that the Anishinaabe are playing very cleverly - strong contenders for sure. Based on the success of the Buccanners and the Anishinaabe, it looks like being at the southernmost tip of a landmass is a strong place to be. Looking forward to the next part!  EDIT: Also, get on with it and attack, Scotland and Minoa!"
civAIgames,3d3gou,ClassyAmoeba,2,Mon Jul 20 16:50:02 2015 UTC,"Dont worry, like you I am also annoyed with Scotland/Minoa. Anishinaabe keep winning the strawpolls, so they have the people's support. A Maori victory would be awesome, and since they just made peace, they might be able to bide their time and sneak in an attack. I'm personally partial to the Sámi but it would be awesome if the Maori did well also."

I think they may be running thin on units due to their continual wars with pretty much everyone and their large deployment currently stationed in Scotland."
civAIgames,3cpn0j,sparklethong,2,Thu Jul 9 21:20:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the bulk of their army is up north. A Northumbrian strike could be very opportune - but bear in mind Lancashire currently have a defensive pact with the Vikings, who while tiny aren't to be shrugged off."

Even with vanilla civs in the 1x1 games, quite often one will be wildly better than the other."
civAIgames,3cnph2,sparklethong,3,Thu Jul 9 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'll remove that one. You've convinced me"
civAIgames,3cnph2,droidbrain,5,Thu Jul 9 21:59:01 2015 UTC,"The rules are pretty much just to stop anyone from being stupid.

There have been people in the past who have used OP UAs though, and I'd like to stop that in the future   Don't be biased Giving one civ more love than another, giving the Manx a settler in Ireland (hypothetical) would be an example of that. It hasn't happened before, but some people have demanded that from authors. If a Civ isn't doing too well, then it isn't dong too well. No exceptions, unless the AI is acting up (e.g. the Boers) Don't be a dick Obvious"

civAIgames,3cjpjh,Kaffe4200,12,Wed Jul 8 13:11:38 2015 UTC,"Iran now has 9 cities and #1 population. Let's be extremely conservative and say Iran will have an average of 5 farms per city. That's a free 15 production per city just due to the UA (~130 free production due to farms right now). They can build troops and infrastructure twice as fast as any other civ, and they already have run away with wonders. Iran's direct neighbors are all weak, giving them room to expand.  I think it's already safe to say it's a foregone conclusion, and not even every civ allying against Iran (which won't happen) could stop them."
civAIgames,3cjpjh,jetlags,6,Wed Jul 8 14:48:08 2015 UTC,"This is starting to look all too accurate. I was hoping they would get boxed in early, but they're all over the place now. Their cities are productive enough that being spread out doesn't seem to be hurting them, since a group of 2-3 Iranian cities can field a respectable military on their own.  Still, Iran borders a lot of other civs now, so maybe there's hope yet for a combined offensive big enough to overcome their production advantage."
civAIgames,3cjpjh,droidbrain,3,Wed Jul 8 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"I think, and have thought, that restarting the game with Persia or the Afsharids in place of that Iran mod would be a good idea. That's just a game-breaking UA that's only going to get worse as the game goes along at this point."
civAIgames,3cjpjh,an_actual_potato,4,Wed Jul 8 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"I will most likely be putting up a poll before I start the next part, to determine whether or nor Mohamed should stay in the game. Enough people seem upset about it, and I'm obvouisly not going to continue a series people don't enjoy. So stay tuned for that post!   And thanks for the feedback to the people who has been commenting, I appreciate it!"
civAIgames,3cjpjh,jetlags,3,Wed Jul 8 15:47:14 2015 UTC,That's a good idea. Thanks for listening to input! I think it should definitely go on at least one more part to see if Iran really is incontestable.
civAIgames,3cjpjh,Admiral_Cloudberg,2,Wed Jul 8 15:50:14 2015 UTC,"What bugs me almost as much as Iran's UA is the fact that the spot where Tehran should be is miles south of this map, and Iran shouldn't have been in this at all as only a tiny corner of the country can be seen. Something like Azerbaijan (if such a mod exists) would fit in that area better."
civAIgames,3cjpjh,SamuraiOutcast,2,Wed Jul 8 16:11:36 2015 UTC,There is an Azerbaijan civ actually.
civAIgames,3cjpjh,benadreti,-1,Wed Jul 8 20:33:24 2015 UTC,The sad thing is they were totally unnecessary for this game.  Their capital is in the corner of the map with barely any of actual Iran on the map.  So they're sinking it for no reason.
civAIgames,3cjpjh,Tankman987,4,Wed Jul 8 15:18:15 2015 UTC,Stalin seems to be a contender for the victory
civAIgames,3cjpjh,thatoneguy1243,2,Wed Jul 8 14:41:28 2015 UTC,The winner of a Stalin vs Khasan war would be situated rather nicely.

civAIgames,3cl54t,Admiral_Cloudberg,8,Wed Jul 8 20:58:47 2015 UTC,"I would prefer that you restarted the game with another civ in Iran's place rather than simply eliminating them, which feels too interventionist."
civAIgames,3cl54t,KirbyATK48,6,Wed Jul 8 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"Agree with this most, like /u/an_actual_potato said, any victory would be a kinda victory since Iran had affected all the civilizations already, maybe add Azerbaijan or something"

civAIgames,3cl54t,an_actual_potato,6,Thu Jul 9 02:57:26 2015 UTC,"Why not ponder restarting the game, other than it would be a lot of work? Iran's presence has altered the play-through significantly by now, playing a big role in the fates of two civs, not to mention all the wonders it gobbled up from others. I mean it can definitely play out after this, I just feel like the eventual winner will have an asterisk next to their win, which is far less satisfying."

civAIgames,3cl54t,Darth_Kyofu,2,Wed Jul 8 20:49:57 2015 UTC,"If deleting them is like razing a city, then I don't think they will be able to be rebuilt. I guess we'll find out!"

civAIgames,3cl54t,sparklethong,3,Thu Jul 9 02:10:32 2015 UTC,"Since Iran's cities are split into four different areas, can I suggest that if you do eliminate Mohamed, you split his cities into four different city-states instead of deleting them? It might be a little crazy and I don't know if you can even do that in IGE, but I think it would be interesting to simulate it as though the Iranian empire collapsed.  On a side note, I love these matches and will continue to read no matter what you do (or don't) with Iran."

civAIgames,3cbq8i,sparklethong,4,Mon Jul 6 21:48:03 2015 UTC,Communism
civAIgames,3cbq8i,KirbyATK48,4,Mon Jul 6 20:09:22 2015 UTC,"I think Iran's UA is just too OP. That's 4 food 3 production farms on grassland, and 3 food 4 production farms on plains. I think they're just going to snowball out of control, especially with all of their wonders. Every civ would have to unite against them right now to contest them."
civAIgames,3cbq8i,jetlags,5,Mon Jul 6 22:18:07 2015 UTC,"It's just mental. I reckon an average city will have about 7 farms. Some more, some less. That means Iran gets +21 production in every city just for the pleasure of being alive. It really should be +1 production. And something tells me the mod was made by an Iranian."
civAIgames,3cbq8i,forgodandthequeen,2,Mon Jul 6 22:31:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, that's the thing. The Days of Sadat modpack was made by an Egyptian, I think. And Egypt's UA isn't anywhere near as OP as Iran's (a combination of Songhai's and Sweden's UAs from the base game IIRC).  Also, Thatcher's UK's UA from that modpack is a combination of Brazil's, England's and Denmark's UAs from the base game. Thought that might interest you."
civAIgames,3cbq8i,New_Katipunan,3,Tue Jul 7 09:26:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be so sure; their capital is in a terrible spot with only 8 workable land tiles, and they've settled their cities so far apart that it'll be hard for them to defend against an attack by any more than 1 civ at once."
civAIgames,3cbq8i,Admiral_Cloudberg,8,Mon Jul 6 22:29:46 2015 UTC,"I dunno, do you see how fast they make carpets in their colonies?  They are in a crappy spot, but who else can just settle randomly and carpet up in a few turns?  It'll be interesting to watch."
civAIgames,3cbq8i,sparklethong,2,Tue Jul 7 02:09:11 2015 UTC,"The thing is, their capital will become substancially more vulnerable than their colonies, meaning it will become an easy target, even more so since it is in a crappy position. My guess is that if they fon't snowball, they'll lose their capital as soon as paratroopers begin."
civAIgames,3cbq8i,Kropenfuer,2,Tue Jul 7 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe.  Good chance of that, or not.  I'm mostly just happy to see someone with that UA also being stuck in that spot.  I actually like the random colony strategy - AI civs stupidly do that all the time, but the Iranians can actually do that and hold those cities.  Interesting to watch."
civAIgames,3cbq8i,sparklethong,2,Wed Jul 8 05:58:34 2015 UTC,"They're strong, that's for sure, though I don't think they are that big of a threat to anyone just yet. Their empire is scattered, and a big army could easily take some Iranian cities, since Mohamed also seems to be focussing less on military than some of his neighbors.  That said, Tehran is well defended by the Caspian Sea, so their capital will be difficult to take."

If Argentina delays too long in trying to take out Brazil, then Pedro could get his own carpet and the game could get real interesting. And with Argentina distracted with Bolivia, it could be a while before said war breaks out."
civAIgames,3c8ozn,misko91,2,Mon Jul 6 00:54:25 2015 UTC,"But having the ability to produce a carpet doesn't help against someone who has a carpet. Especially an XCOM carpet, which Brazil simply needs ASAP."

Question: Is Chelkar really the name of the Scythian capital? It's interesting if that's the case.  And yeah, that Iran seems pretty OP. I was wondering if it was balanced against the other civs in the Days of Sadat pack. But although the UAs of civs in that modpack tend to be composites of multiple abilities from vanilla civs, none seem to be as OP as Iran's, with the possible exception of Carter/Nixon's USA. (And Kuwait, which has triple the number of trade routes. I guess that's OP too until they get pillaged.)"
civAIgames,3c42pf,Pizzarcatto,3,Sat Jul 4 19:20:47 2015 UTC,"No, Chelkar actually isn't Scythia's capital. I forgot to mention that, I moved the capital, as it was too close to some of the other empires."
civAIgames,3c42pf,DrPixel,2,Sat Jul 4 20:52:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for the answer. I was wondering because Chelkar (or Shalkar) is the name of an actual present-day city in the area, and if the Scythians had had a city of the same name it'd be pretty surprising."

civAIgames,3bmiva,KirbyATK48,10,Tue Jun 30 13:15:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe, maybe not. Spain seemed to be the weaker link, so I think Romania could have killed them in around 10 turns. Then Carol could have sent his entire army to the north. Also, I think some of the units who attacked Egypt were still there, so they could have been useful."

civAIgames,3bk8cf,an_actual_potato,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:33:48 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the civs personality, a high score in defense/military will make it more likely build a carpet."
civAIgames,3bk8cf,ThrashReflex,3,Tue Jun 30 02:18:26 2015 UTC,"Whew. Those multi-front wars were bad news for Romania and good news for everyone else, because Romania has to fight everyone else and everyone else pretty much only has to fight Romania. I was particularly worried when Russia actually had higher troop density at the start of the war than Romania did, and started off strong by recapturing several cities.  Nevertheless, Romania pulled through once again. France has fallen, Egypt is about to, and Romania broke even on the Russian front, losing one or two cities but taking one or two. With France gone, that should free up a lot of Romanian troops to be used elsewhere. Time to finish this!"

Also funny that the Tyrells took their time besieging a city they could have quickly conquered.  The Targaryen Restoration scenario is interesting, but I'd give it a rain check for now. As for the White Walkers scenario, the thing is that for them to go south, the Free Folk have to fall, then the Wall, then the Starks, disadvantaging those factions. Also with the ""Winter is Coming"" scenario, changing tiles to snow would probably lead to mass starvation scenario and collapse of civs, since snow tiles in Civ5 produce nothing at all and can hardly be improved."

France is about to collapse completely, with Paris set to fall in 1-2 turns. Romania now is not facing a war with Russia (for the time being) allowing him some time to regroup and rebuild his forces in that area. Moreover every time someone strikes a peace deal with Carol, which will happen fairly often I think, they give away huge chunks of the map. That rest of the world combined has about 60% of Romania's production is really the death knell. Sure if they all fought Romania together, with concentration they might have a shot, but the AI isn't that clever and they're all fighting each other too."

France had a true Friendship with Romania, going back to the times where they were separated by at least two or three nations, and they stayed loyal to each other!

But between Spain and Rome, going by uniques alone, Rome did seem like a somewhat better choice.  I don't think Spain could have reached Krakatoa anyway. The only way they could have reached it was the desert tile at the tip of the peninsula, and I think they couldn't have settled there because Madrid was too near. Turns out they didn't need it to win.  Rome being allied to Hanoi probably helped them; Hanoi built up a formidable military for a CS. This was also one of those rare games where we got to see a lot of fighting on the other continent too.  You wanna know what was really strange? I thought Rome was behind in tech, yet they were the ones who voted to repeal Scholars in Residence, while Spain voted for it."

civAIgames,3b7j4n,Ignus_,6,Fri Jun 26 16:30:52 2015 UTC,Really like the barbarian fleeing idea. Usually civs in corners/with lots of space tend to snowball because they can expand uncontested. Hopefully this will even the odds a little.

civAIgames,3b6sz9,New_Katipunan,3,Sat Jun 27 06:56:53 2015 UTC,"Interesting. This must be the first time in an AI game one AI didn't manage to steamroll the rest with XCOMs and Stealth Bombers. I suppose the Tupi could have been closer to parity with the Aztecs than most other civs in previous AI games, but I'm not really sure - Sweden in the Scandinavia game was pretty large too, and they didn't stand a chance against Finland.  Possible that the terrain of narrow Central America in the western theater and a bunch of islands in the eastern theater made advancing difficult, but I still think that the Aztecs could have forced their way in by brute force by setting all their cities to build XCOMs, stealth bombers, and nuclear missiles, and then funneling in all those to the front line. I think something about the geography made the Aztecs keep most of their army at home. The Aztec heartland tiles were probably filled with units.  Still, I really got the sense of two massive empires fighting an eternal war, with only border cities changing hands. Congratulations!"

I'm a bit sad that the Aztecs didn't get more time to get the win, but the draw is a somewhat deserved (and fresh) result.  Even so, it is clear that even with the continued existence of the Tupi, it was the Aztecs that made more gains once the Olmecs were taken out… so I'm calling that one a moral victory for Monty. ^^"

Iasi was Polish for a very long time, and the Polish almost took down Bucharest very early on. Romania has been fighting against stronger enemies the whole game, and after being thoroughly ravaged over and over from the start, they've still come to dominate the game.

Well earned.  Edit: Keen observation time! During this episode Romania deployed two citadels along the Russian border and ate up quite a bit of Russian territory north of Crimea.

civAIgames,3b0ve0,MetropolitanVanuatu,7,Thu Jun 25 05:01:12 2015 UTC,I'd say no settlers. I prefer no human intervention when possible.
civAIgames,3b0ve0,Kropenfuer,4,Thu Jun 25 04:29:21 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, Ireland should be colonised as soon as possible, even if you have to intervene to do it… especially with Manx."

So I say no on the settler add. Let the smart AIs figure it out and the dumb ones flounder and fail."
civAIgames,3b0ve0,misko91,2,Thu Jun 25 03:09:20 2015 UTC,"I say no settlers. Odds are that with the many, many AIs in this game, at least one will colonize the island, and the one that does will no doubt be crowned King of all Britain."

civAIgames,3b0ve0,sparklethong,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:17:29 2015 UTC,"I say add the settlers: without them, the AI probably won't care enough about Ireland - focusing production on military instead of settlers.  Although it may be intervention, it wouldn't be biased towards any specific civ and would add another area of interest which (again) may not exist otherwise."

Brazil is the most powerful country in South America and Argentina is the second most powerful, just like in real life! I'm impressed at how accurate this game is turning out. And then these two are followed by Chile (still accurate) and...Bolivia!?  However, Bolivia being embargoed and Autocracy becoming world ideology will both help to weaken them.  The war between Argentina and Brazil should be named the Platinean War. An interesting alt-hist scenario (and indeed one that could have happened in real life)."

civAIgames,3azamr,KirbyATK48,2,Wed Jun 24 19:32:07 2015 UTC,"That's currently my prediction as well. I've only run it until the point marked as the end so far, so no clumsy foreshadowing there.

civAIgames,3azamr,Austinpike446,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:28:34 2015 UTC,"A little defenestration is good every now and then.  Morocco's elimination virtually guarantees Team Navy's victory in my mind, since three civs are together versus two. True, Netherlands/Venice might be able to secure the entire east continent for themselves, but I'm not sure that'll happen.  Come to think of it, even Venice could have been put in Team Navy too. There's a good amount of overlap between naval power and trading power, for obvious reasons."
civAIgames,3aypl1,GRI23,7,Wed Jun 24 15:56:22 2015 UTC,"I think the forced war was a good idea, since they are in the correct era."
civAIgames,3aypl1,Fusion_Spark,6,Wed Jun 24 16:59:19 2015 UTC,"Whoops. I noticed the anomaly with the UK being behind, and I should have pointed it out. Teammates share tech, the fact that the UK was lagging behind should already have indicated that there was a problem. In fact, the very reason the Allied team was 1 or 2 techs behind the whole game may be because only 4 civs were researching together versus 5.  The World Congress voting shows something bizarre, with four civs per team voting for one teammate - and then that teammate voting for someone else. This allowed the Allies to take the host spot from the Axis, but in fact both sides are doing it, with all the other Allies voting for China and China voting for France. Weird.  Also. While I did say ""Modern Era"" last time, it's not exactly the correct era. The Modern Era in CiV corresponds to around WW1-era in our timeline. The proper era for WW2 is the Atomic Era (although with a bit of variation since atom bombs can be researched at the same time as bombers and tanks). Because of this variation, I guess a Modern Era start is okay."
civAIgames,3aypl1,New_Katipunan,2,Wed Jun 24 17:26:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, UK isn't on the allied team. Teams have a shared tech tree with the science cost determined by their science thresholds being added up. If Churchill doesn't have the same amount of techs, he's not on the allied team. Sorry /u/GRI23, you done fucked up."

Start a game with IGE and you can get rid of your settler and warrior and put a nuclear sub in a corner or something, place the AIs where you want, reveal the whole map, etc. Essentially every aspect of setting up an AI game is done using IGE.

civAIgames,3ao61l,KirbyATK48,5,Mon Jun 22 03:06:54 2015 UTC,"The Afghani victory is inevitable at this point; however, I would actually be interested in seeing an alliance war of the Blackfoot and Zapotecs vs. Afghanistan. I know it's not what the AI would do, but in actual gameplay that would be the rational choice the two players would make. Wait until 2050, and if noone declares war, force a war between the two sides."

Guess my cathartic revenge will have to wait. It'll happen eventually anyway.  Fyodor Ushakov is indeed a prodigy, he managed to spearhead the capture of an enemy city despite not having a navy.

Monty has a 1000 point production lead, but it seems like a third of it is going straight into aircraft carriers and anti-air, whereas Tu seems to be putting hammers into artillery and, most importantly, X-coms. I would say this is a pretty even match. Like GRI23 points out, if Monty's AI gets stalled at Panama, but Cunhambebe can make a miraculous landfall in Florida, it might be Tupi that run away with this. I suppose it all comes down to who nukes what.  Regardless, congrats /u/kaffe4200 on making one of the most intriguing games so far. Really looking forward to the finale."

civAIgames,3amhe2,your_favorite_addict,7,Mon Jun 22 06:02:24 2015 UTC,monty will win this. it will be a short stalemate first and then his southern army will wrech tupi's. while tupi will have to hop islands which is way harder for the AI.

civAIgames,3amhe2,MrEnderGhast,3,Sun Jun 21 17:56:56 2015 UTC,I still think that the Tupi can win as Monty now has to navigate his units through the one-tile wide area of Panama. This should slow him down a bit and the Tupi can land in Florida and fight a land war.

civAIgames,3amhe2,Kropenfuer,3,Mon Jun 22 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"And then there were two.  Both the Mexica (Aztecs) and the Tupi have vast empires, but the Mexica empire is vaster. I predict an eventual Aztec victory, although not necessarily a quick an easy one.  The two superpowers have been fighting in the Caribbean for sometime, with neither able to gain a decisive advantage. However, with the Maya and the Olmecs now eliminated, they can reach each other in Central America as well, opening up a second theater for the war. Note that in the last slide, Laguna de los Cerros, the Olmec city taken by the Tupi, was immediately nuked by the Aztecs as soon as the Aztec and Tupi borders met in Central America and the Olmecs were eliminated. Nice way to kick off the war between them in that theater."
civAIgames,3ajox3,5566y,10,Sat Jun 20 21:25:43 2015 UTC,Yerevan is about to be captured but it looks like Mr. Mada is ready to strike back on the western front.
civAIgames,3ajox3,Corbutte,6,Sun Jun 21 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"Rome vs. Spain is interesting, and will depend a lot on the start. If both civs are on different continents, the wide play and infrastructure development ability of Caesar should be able to win. If both are squashed in together, Isabella's ability to create incredibly good cities could be powerful. These matches show time and time again that wonders win wars, and Spain is all about those wonders."
civAIgames,3ajox3,forgodandthequeen,3,Sat Jun 20 23:05:44 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I would note that the time of warfare will also play a factor. Both have two UUs, but Rome's are both in the Classical Era, while Spain's are Renaissance Era. If they are smushed together, that favors early warfare (and thus Caeser), while different continents will be necessarily Renaissance or later."
civAIgames,3ajox3,misko91,2,Sun Jun 21 00:31:22 2015 UTC,"Plus, the UAs of Rome's UUs (yes that made sense) don't carry on after up after upgrade, but I think Spain still keeps them."

civAIgames,3ajox3,arrioch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, it will be very situational. If there's a close natural wonder to Isabela, she can snowball easily. She likes to build wonders, but Caesar is not stranger to wonder-whoring either. If Caesar expands early and uses his UUs wisely he can take her out quickly, if he misses that chance, it will be much tougher afterwards."

I still don't think they have the numbers, and I've never seen a civ build a carpet this late if they didn't already have one, to play with the big boys, but damn if they weren't fun to watch in this part. Also interested to see who Romania turns their wrath on next. I'm guessing Rome, civs tend to bandwagon when an empire shows too much weakness."

civAIgames,3a8vin,New_Katipunan,6,Thu Jun 18 03:48:22 2015 UTC,"Simon Bolivar is so badass that he can lead two nations at once and go to war with himself. Probably should have had Venezuela be led by Hugo Chavez, that would be good for a laugh.  Both Brazil and the Tupi have unique improvements that vastly improve the jungle, giving them an edge in the Amazon. The Tupi can settle it from the start, but Brazil starts in the coastal region south of the jungle, and have not settled it yet. They should put at least a few cities there.  Chile not founding any coastal cities is a betrayal of the very nature of that country (just look at its shape on a map dammit). On the other hand, it does allow them to utilize all of the good land between the Pacific and the Andes."

Romania has almost certainly won this game, nailing a base hit off Egypt like that, which may well turn out to be a homerun, should be enough for them to just steamroll the rest of the way. Russia simply doesn't have the manpower, or the will to produce the manpower, to stop them."
civAIgames,3a5tk6,an_actual_potato,9,Wed Jun 17 13:55:37 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed. Even if the conclusion is almost foregone, it's distressing to think that it might end early after an astonishing 39 parts."

If my computer collapses too soon, we'll see about getting someone else to narrate. Now that you say that, it really seems like a good idea. Originally, I was going to include America under FDR in Washington with Richmond by Jefferson Davis just to the South, but one of the mods (the Midwest, I think) broke America, so I substituted in Virginia and moved the Confederates down south."

civAIgames,3a563s,LacsiraxAriscal,2,Wed Jun 17 10:40:08 2015 UTC,"Having game run, I decided to represent White Walkers as barbarians as only possible option. Because of revealed map their camps don't appear on their own.  I decided to make it as a sort of scenario.   I will put barb camp every 5 turn somewhere in the north. Every 20 turns I will put a bunch of camps (5 or about) just to make barbarians spam and swarm like if they were true White Walkers. When a barbarian unit reaches further south line, it becomes possible to me to place barb camp the same further south. When a city becomes damaged down to zero, I delete this city through IGE and put 5 more camps in its place.   So using this I hope we will see good-looking ""The Winter is close"" event which won't ruin much other game process.  What do you think about such ""custom sub-scenario""?"

civAIgames,3a2rty,forgodandthequeen,7,Tue Jun 16 21:42:20 2015 UTC,"I've a couple of ideas. My most fully fledged idea is a Japan one: 4 Japan civs starting at Nara and Kyoto, Tokyo and Kamakura (each pair are very close). Several of the major Sengoku era clans would be represented with city states. Authentic city naming would be included as in the Britain game. I need to test the Tokugawa Japan mod before this idea comes about, however (I have no idea how well it works); Meiji and Tojo seem to be fully functional in other people's games.  I've a couple of other less well-formed ideas; one is to use one of the scrambled continents maps (probably Africa), or an Antarctica map with Chile, Argentina, UK, Norway, Australia, NZ and France fighting it out. Another more far out concept is a semi-interactive AI game; instead of voting on who you think the winner will be, you vote for a civ you want to help out and each episode's winner will receive some complementary units courtesy of IGE. They will then be left out of the next poll to avoid one civ building up some maniacal fandom :P  They're the ones I'm chucking about in my head at the moment, but I'm not even vaguely thinking about the logistics of any of them at the moment. I have to get through this one first... the first signs of weakness in my laptop have just started to kick in."
civAIgames,3a2rty,LacsiraxAriscal,3,Tue Jun 16 23:33:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, I have an idea for your Japan match. For more variety in civs, I recommend this. However, it replaces the names of the other Japans into Chubu, but nothing too bad."

We'd have Bosnia, Finland, the Saffarids, the Picts, probably the Qin, but that's all. Three for Europe, one in the Middle East, one in Asia, zero in America, zero in Africa. With the Oceania and the Carribean ones we might equalize the map a tad, but not enough for a real match.  Someone should do an Africa AI match. We had one but it failed."

Since it might take a little time for this to occur, I think we might be able to use runner ups who are also pretty good in the games. Also, let's just hope that this one has more stability( probably not because it will probably be mostly entirely modded civs.) Also, I heard an idea before where there would be commentators from the people who did these matches. It's a nice idea and I hope it gets somewhere ( and possibly get the attention of the great TPang himself.)"
civAIgames,3a27cp,Samarkhannor,9,Tue Jun 16 17:28:58 2015 UTC,"It may seem like a small thing, but I strongly oppose intervening after declaring a world wide war. The AI has no conception of what you are doing, and I've seen a game turn on the peace deals that are made, and then force-broken by the player (The AI Britain game from a while ago).  If the entire world settles back into peace, I think further intervention is fine, but otherwise you are just handing the game to the civ with the biggest army, and you might as well just declare a winner instead of going through all the trouble."
civAIgames,3a27cp,misko91,3,Tue Jun 16 18:29:05 2015 UTC,That was obvious anyway and only matter of time.

civAIgames,3a27cp,sparklethong,2,Wed Jun 17 03:06:42 2015 UTC,Congrats on a successful finish!!!  Those last 15 turns or so of the previous part were some of my favorite scenes i've ever watched of these AI fights.

civAIgames,3a27cp,LacsiraxAriscal,2,Tue Jun 16 19:41:07 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I won't be able to work on the next one, as I will be going to Mongolia (whoop whoop). However, in August, we plan to do another joint one with U.S. states; I'm really looking forward to it, although I'll miss out on the South America one."

civAIgames,39y10s,boonboonsplat,4,Mon Jun 15 18:53:46 2015 UTC,Oh man are you about to find out! This episode is nothing compared to the next one! :) Stay tuned.
civAIgames,39y10s,Admiral_Cloudberg,4,Mon Jun 15 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"After a brief hiatus, the Mesopotamia AI Deathmatch with /u/Samarkhannor and myself is back! The strawpoll from last time was fairly decisive, as it should have been, with a clear lead for the Afsharids.   The Afsharids (68%) Armenia (12%) Greece (8%) Minoa (8%) Sumeria (4%)   Everyone who didn't vote for the Afsharids must be extremely hopeful. I didn't include a strawpoll this time because there's really no question of the victor, but the warfare in this episode is astonishing in its own right and worth checking out. Part IX should be out later today or tomorrow!"
civAIgames,39y10s,Admiral_Cloudberg,2,Mon Jun 15 18:50:41 2015 UTC,"yeah, minoa and sumeria are two apparent victors"
civAIgames,39y10s,TeOr2419,5,Tue Jun 16 02:12:05 2015 UTC,Remove Achaemenid  Remove Parthian  Remove Safavid  Remove Pahlavi  Afsharid Stronk!
civAIgames,39y10s,novov,2,Tue Jun 16 04:13:20 2015 UTC,"Order must prevail. That's a clear reason why Afsharids decided to wipe all others out  And nukes, yeah, more nukes. That's what we all have been missing in these AI games"
civAIgames,39y10s,TeOr2419,2,Tue Jun 16 02:07:06 2015 UTC,"Egypt uses a few too many nukes on Lagash, erases it completely.  The Afsharids conquer everything in sight despite suffering -100 happiness from ideological pressure. They should just switch ideologies already, unless their plan is to wipe everyone with a different ideology out before the unhappiness gets to be too much. That might be difficult, even for them, though.  Edit: And I'm sure that their unhappiness is the reason they don't attack more civs after ravaging Phoenicia."
civAIgames,39y10s,New_Katipunan,2,Tue Jun 16 08:02:08 2015 UTC,This match has definitely got something the other AI matches have been lacking: nukes galore. I think this is the first time we've seen civs go wild with the nukes instead of just dropping a few here or there.

civAIgames,39ub32,forgodandthequeen,4,Sun Jun 14 22:27:58 2015 UTC,Venice vs. the Mayan. Venice is generally annoyingto play against so I'm looking forward to seeing them get crushed.
civAIgames,39ub32,thatoneguy1243,5,Mon Jun 15 00:10:28 2015 UTC,The production ranking popup doesn't necessarily mean who has the most production. The numbers shown there are the average of the production of each of that civ's cities. A civ with one large city will get a higher number than a civ that recently founded several small cities.
civAIgames,39ub32,New_Katipunan,2,Mon Jun 15 08:52:12 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was combined production, then again that might be demographics, oh well thanks for the information!"

Two large mostly flat square landmasses seems kinda dull.  Black Sea/Pacific Ocean would lead to much more interesting gameplay.
civAIgames,39swlw,sparklethong,5,Sun Jun 14 14:09:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I think it's the civ numbers that are bringing the votes.  Also I want the Tupi, or anyone other than the Aztec, to win as well. It's still possible. No unit carpets to just sweep the game with, which is pretty important in ending things."
civAIgames,39swlw,an_actual_potato,5,Sun Jun 14 16:10:49 2015 UTC,"This is getting to be even more one-sided than the Italy match. I think geography has been key here: the map is relatively narrow, so even though Montezuma is a central power, he's never had to worry about more than two fronts at once. Now it's hard to see how he could possibly lose, with commanding leads in literally every category."

They're certainly a rather wonderful anomaly in history, a tribe who very rapidly went from being just another backwater small nation to owning half of the known world.

civAIgames,39rdpe,GRI23,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:17:03 2015 UTC,"And then they went right back to where they started. Ya there were loads of Khans. Bodg Khan wasn't even from the Empire.

civAIgames,39gh4f,benadreti,10,Thu Jun 11 23:58:28 2015 UTC,"I'm almost certain at this point that Romania will win. It's like the Italy AI game from a while back. Other nations (Genoa, Corsica, etc) had more advanced militaries and sizeable empires, but Bosnia maintained an enormous force of paratroopers and other units, a force so large that it just overwhelmed superior units (and was eventually upgraded to XCOMs anyway. At the end of the day, the unit carpet wins nine times out of ten. If Romania and Russia went to war right now it would be red slaughter.  Edit: Norway, of all countries, could actually challenge, too, they're military is now so large it's filling up more of Russia than the Russians are."
civAIgames,39gh4f,an_actual_potato,8,Thu Jun 11 16:14:17 2015 UTC,"Unit carpets usually do win, but for Romania, It is completely deserved."

Norway threatens too, though, but everything has to go right for them to get ahead of Romania in a meaningful way (like DoWing Russia and mopping the floor with their inattentive asses)."
civAIgames,39gh4f,an_actual_potato,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:45:32 2015 UTC,It's just insane how big armies the civs can build. I wonder if we'll run out of room before the end.
civAIgames,39gh4f,an_actual_potato,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:36:04 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, conquest helps with that and there's still plenty of ocean tiles (and Russian tiles) to be swamped with Romanian/Norwegian/(to a lesser extent) Egyptian units."
civAIgames,39gh4f,misko91,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"While I sympathize, I think Romania is hardly a certainty yet. I can't help but remember the team civaigame : Team Commonwealth was doing extremely well, but was pounced on by all their neighbors and they simply folded (37 lost cities in one part, fucking insane).  For Romania to be guaranteed a win, in my mind, they need to get in a one-on-one (and it has to be one-on-one, can't share the spoils) with one of their big neighbors, and they have to crush them utterly. Doing so both removes one competitor, and gives them the production advantage necessary to take on the remaining powers without fearing a coalition.  They could still win without using that method, of course, but that's what I think they need to do to be safe from some bizarre DoW from Spain or something that leads to a ""blood in the water"" moment, like with Rome now."
civAIgames,39gh4f,Ignus_,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:11:33 2015 UTC,"That part was amazing.  I remember seeing the cities drop like flies.  I'm trying to figure out where all that military score from Russia is.  They have a pretty strong military judging from the Info Addict, but it is nowhere to be found.  Either way, if they actually make a military and do stuff with allies then they could easily cripple Romania.  At this point, Romania needs Istanbul to be nuked, otherwise they will always have a capital in exile that is as good as any other civ's legit capital."
civAIgames,39gh4f,forgodandthequeen,7,Fri Jun 12 21:49:51 2015 UTC,"I really hope Romania wins, mostly because they're not a corner civ. Corner civs have an innate advantage, and it would be nice for something to overcome that for once."
civAIgames,39gh4f,jrgbest,4,Thu Jun 11 21:55:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, Rome loses out big time and Romania looks very strong. A win against Russia would basically be game, but they need to avoid being backstabbed."

But I'm still hoping for Romania to win this. If they take cities from Rome, it might give them the edge they need to take down Russia.  Rome has stood strong this whole time, but it's at war with three different powers right now. Romania sure picked a good time to war them, alongside Spain and France.  Meanwhile Aleksandr is laughing madly from his single city as the world burns."

Also, not that you care, but plate tectonics got its start in Ullapool because it's a great place to see plate tectonics in action. The Moine Thrust nearby has older rocks on the top and younger rocks at the bottom (the reverse of what you'd expect), which led geologists to scratch their heads until they concluded that the movement of plates at the fault had pushed the older rocks up from the depths.  Disclaimer, though: I'm not a geologist; I'm just related to one."

So far, I have the first episode already cast and done, it just needs to be posted. This first Stage of the elimination tournament will see Skyrim take on the nations of Mordor. Then, I had an idea for the second tournament to feature the nations of Fallout battle it out with the exciting nations from the Bioshock universe. The third tournament would consist of the nations from A Song of Ice and Fire against those from the Dynasty Warriors games. Then, the losers would have one chance to redeem themselves in a loser bracket, while the winners would eventually work their way up the ladder towards an epic 2v2 match up and after that, an epic 1v1 battle to determine who is the most powerful nation of them all."

civAIgames,38sa7u,forgodandthequeen,3,Sat Jun 6 13:00:05 2015 UTC,"Do you mean if the Tsar stayed in power during 1917, or if Lenin's Bolsheviks never take control? The former would probably see a regime similar to Imperial Japan. The latter likely something resembling interwar German democracy."
civAIgames,38sa7u,New_Katipunan,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:06:16 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of the latter. But a scenario where the Mensheviks became the dominant form of Russian socialism would also be interesting to consider.  Can you see any scenario where Russia becomes a stable, functional democracy? Russia and democracy just don't seem to mix, and of course the ""democracy"" they have at the moment isn't really one at all."
civAIgames,38sa7u,forgodandthequeen,2,Sun Jun 7 05:24:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure democracy is doomed in any country. Look at Germany, centuries of democracy becoming merely a formality, Hitler and Habsburgs alike. Today it is most certainly a democracy, with no indication it will ever not be.  Look at France. Are we on the Fourth French republic now? I think so. And I wouldnt argue France is anything but an democracy. Russia has  had bad luck with Putin and Lenin. I wouldn't say democracy is doomed in Russia because of that."
civAIgames,38sa7u,New_Katipunan,2,Sun Jun 7 08:58:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I suppose that's a hopeful sign. You're right about France and Germany. And I guess one could say that every country that is a democracy now was not a democracy in the past (using the strict definition, even the US was not a democracy at one point, however much they insisted they were, because of slavery).  If democracy succeeded in Germany and Japan, two countries whose people were both said to have ""autocratic tendencies"", then it could succeed anywhere else. I hope democracy eventually prevails in the remaining autocratic major powers. (I'm thinking mainly of China and Russia here.)"

civAIgames,38rd41,KirbyATK48,4,Sat Jun 6 05:39:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, I thought Denmark was automatically screwed with that mountain island and the colony fail.  IMO the coastline was a good idea, but it screwed the Denmark AI due to the mountain range blocking off the rest of its island. Coastline will work fine with flatter islands."
civAIgames,38rd41,TA_knight,3,Sat Jun 6 11:36:58 2015 UTC,"And that's why I don't vote in the straw polls here, it seems the public is excellent at guessing winners. :P  I mean, Denmark, usually dismissed as a weak civ, against Assyria? It seems to be no contest. However, when it comes to the AI, their personality flavors often mean more than their unique abilities."
civAIgames,38rd41,New_Katipunan,3,Sat Jun 6 05:47:08 2015 UTC,"I like the coastline encouraging early interaction, and I definitely like the more balanced continents style map, it made it way more even throughout the game."
civAIgames,38rd41,VanillaIceTray,5,Sat Jun 6 18:20:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a match. Did not certainly expect Denmark to recover.  The Mongols will absolutely crush the celts, I am already calling it. No one is safe from Genghis."

civAIgames,38q848,Samarkhannor,4,Fri Jun 5 22:19:15 2015 UTC,Welcome to part 4 of the Mesopotamia AI Deathmatch with /u/Samrkhannor and myself! The results of the strawpoll in part 3 were less decisive than those in part 2:  Phoenicia (27%)  Babylon (20%)  Minoa (18%)  Greece (16%)  Egypt and the Afsharids (tied with 9% each)   No other civs got any votes at all as the clear contenders begin to emerge! The strawpoll for part 4 can be found here.
civAIgames,38q848,Admiral_Cloudberg,4,Fri Jun 5 22:19:43 2015 UTC,"Stupid AI... Giving away huge cities in stupid peace deals. Then burning conquered huge cities (with wonders!).  Though this is one of the most exciting AI games, there are constant wars, political map changes by the turn."
civAIgames,38q848,arrioch,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:02:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'm really happy with how this has turned out so far. As for razing cities, the AI is programmed to raze the city if upon capturing it their happiness is lower than zero, regardless of whether or not it's actually in their interest to do so. If there's a mod that changes this, I haven't seen it, but I might use it next time if it exists."
civAIgames,38q848,Admiral_Cloudberg,3,Sat Jun 6 15:18:27 2015 UTC,Minoa is going to last a long long time on the mighty stronghold of Knossos.
civAIgames,38q848,forgodandthequeen,2,Sat Jun 6 11:58:20 2015 UTC,"Considering the size of the army that took down Tabriz, Armenia should not have given a city away to the Afsharids, and should have kept the city they got from the Hittites (which they apparently replaced with a new one anyway). In any case they still have a sizable empire, and will not fall too easily."
civAIgames,38q848,New_Katipunan,2,Sat Jun 6 05:27:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, their strategy isn't the best. I think they gave away that city because the army had been significantly reduced by fighting against the Afsharids, and although they had a decent sized army still, it didn't compare to the mighty Afsharid force. I highly doubt Armenia win, but they won't be easy to break, especially given how difficult the terrain around them is."

There are still plenty of civs left with no clear strongest and it would be nice to see where this is going if left on its own. I.e. in an all-out war I believe Romania, surrounded from all sides, would have less chance of ending up victorious than if we left her to to take on the major forces one-on-one."
civAIgames,38nvsy,gyepi,4,Fri Jun 5 13:18:34 2015 UTC,"yeah, I wouldn't really like to do that either, since it'd be a shame to destroy the alliance between the central autocrats (spain, france and romania, and rome is kinda there also). It's just that I don't know how long this would last (iirc it took kaffe like hundreds of turns of peace until he forced wars in some game) and I have to finish the series before July."

If u need to end before july lets wait until mid june to see if its really needed to do that."
civAIgames,38nvsy,meerkatsrgay,2,Fri Jun 5 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"No, let the game develop on it's own.  There's plenty of action going on and still technology developing, it's not like everyone is just sitting around at future tech."
civAIgames,38nvsy,jetlags,2,Fri Jun 5 16:03:40 2015 UTC,"Don't force wars until it's absolutely necessary...you can just let the game run for a bit without screenshots and give a quick recap of what went down in between when something does happen. Forcing wars kind of screws the AI over like it did with Novgorod, who signed a city away in a peace deal before we immediately put them back into the war down one city they weren't about to lose."
civAIgames,38nvsy,New_Katipunan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"All out war would be a good idea. I feel picking wars is picking winners. How about....start war with everyone. Then, the first 4ish peace deals get to stand and everyone else is forced to stay in war. The true allies should look for peace first so it should be more fair that way. Rome, my favorites, would die, but that is fine."
civAIgames,38nvsy,sparklethong,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:27:47 2015 UTC,"I think if nothing happens with England, war should be declared between all civs that are denouncing each other. That way it's a compromise between all out war between everyone and targeted wars that may be unbalanced for some civs."
civAIgames,38nvsy,New_Katipunan,2,Fri Jun 5 18:41:04 2015 UTC,"I would suggest waiting another 50, or if you're fine with it, 100 turns. It's not as if no wars are raging - the Huns (edit: and Bavaria) were eliminated in this part, and the British are at war with multiple civs."
civAIgames,38nvsy,your_favorite_addict,2,Fri Jun 5 15:19:06 2015 UTC,Yup 100 more turns I say.
civAIgames,38nvsy,TeOr2419,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:04:22 2015 UTC,I'm thinking at least enough time to let the major powers reach the end of the tech tree. Hopefully around 50 turns is enough to do it.

In a failed AI run before I started, I accidentally set it on marathon instead of historic and no one even made a settler or really did anything until almost turn 100."

Historic isn't for everyone, but marathon is much less interesting to watch and play, personally. Do a poll and see what people think, but I'd include standard, marathon, whatever is in between, and historic."

Unfortunately, the AI won't think of that."
civAIgames,38dsw3,Admiral_Cloudberg,4,Wed Jun 3 15:54:53 2015 UTC,"Good idea, but Carol doesn't yet have nuclear subs."
civAIgames,38dsw3,Admiral_Cloudberg,2,Wed Jun 3 16:05:31 2015 UTC,Good catch. I hadn't noticed that.

civAIgames,38dsw3,New_Katipunan,5,Wed Jun 3 17:47:43 2015 UTC,"So just a few turns after the war, Romania's managed to fill up all of its tiles with units again. That says a lot about their persistence. Now, they've got to catch up technologically, and the nuked cities need to recover their populations.

civAIgames,38fhxp,samitian,2,Wed Jun 3 21:37:05 2015 UTC,"I suppose that depends on the type of game you want. Are you wanting a long game? Get historic speed mod. Want aggressive AI's? Get the aggressive AI mod. Want a certain part of the world or a fictional one? Download some maps. Maybe download some civs that would belong in that area (Example: The Italy map had Genoa, Corsica, Bosnia, etc. from mods.). Honestly an AI game and really any civ game can go many different directions even with the same start every time, so you don't NEED any more mods than probably the IGE. Do you have an(y) idea(s) for a game lined up already?"
civAIgames,38fhxp,Lazy_Rebel,2,Wed Jun 3 21:42:12 2015 UTC,"I was actually planning on being rather boring, just using 22 random AIs (my computer isn't amazing and struggles to handle 42) on a fractal map type and letting them have a go. I already have Historic Speed, which seems like a good one to use.

civAIgames,38au71,misko91,2,Wed Jun 3 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"I guess that for civs that start very close to each other, the optimal strategy is to build up a large army immediately to destroy the other civ.

(The Huns have founded it in the Battle Royal)  It was partially shamanism, and partially worship of the Sky Father, Tengri. Genghis Khan himself worshiped the SkyFather, and the most sacred mountain in Mongolia is Burkhan Khaldun, where Genghis Prayed to the sky father for guidance in uniting the steppe tribes into one nation. Tengrism is no longer the Majority religion in Mongolia, with Tibetan Buddhism having taken the place in the 16th or 17th centuries. It is still practiced by about 3% of the population and has influenced Mongolian Buddhism as well.  Well, there you go."

Instead they wasted time on the harmless Zapotecs, sheesh. The Philippines is pretty strong for a turtle and continues to stay near the top of most rankings, but they should really start taking territory.

As I haven't tried that many, that's essentially JFD.  Boudica's Celts (Vanilla). Though Boudica was a member of the Iceni tribe from Norfolk, here they start in Inverness and represent the Picts. Their city names are Scottish Gaelic.  James's Scotland (Mod). They start in Edinburgh, of course, and their city names are in Scots.  Harold Bluetooth's Denmark (Vanilla). They start in the capital of the North, York (not to mention my home-town). Their city names are consistent where possible with Viking city names, although as well as representing Knut's empire they also represent Anglo-Saxon Northumbria and the Yorkists, which is a bit much but hey this is AU.  Henry VIII's England (Mod). They start in Lancaster, and predictably represent Lancastrians.  Elizabeth's England (Vanilla). They start in Tamworth, representing Mercia.  Churchill's United Kingdom (Mod). They take a very different role in this mod, as Wales, starting in Cardiff with Welsh city names.  Augustus' Rome (Vanilla). They start in Colchester, the first Roman capital of Britain, and as well as representing the Roman conquerors they also neatly sit in the area of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia. Their city names are still Latin though.  Victoria's Britain (Mod). They get the honour of starting in London, representing the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Essex.  William's Normandy (Mod - a very new one, at that). They start - where else? - in Hastings, again not only representing the Norman conquerors but also the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Kent. I considered giving them French city names but decided against it as a) Norman French very quickly melded with Anglo-Saxon to form English and b) French names for English cities are generally the same anyway.  Alfred's Anglo-Saxons (Mod). They start in Winchester, representing Alfred's own Wessex."

civAIgames,3839o6,an_actual_potato,3,Mon Jun 1 18:03:49 2015 UTC,"Still, you gotta wonder if they could have gotten more if they pushed a little further.  As it is now...I had hoped that Russia had at least used up their entire nuclear arsenal, but no. Slide 7 shows at least seven atom bombs. And near the end, we see a Russian nuclear submarine loaded with two nuclear missiles - and six other nuclear submarines carrying two units each. And I'm pretty sure nuclear missiles are the only units nuke submarines can carry.   Which raises the question of just how much uranium the bitch has and how big her nuke stockpile really is. I'm still rooting for Romania to win, they deserve it after all this."
civAIgames,3839o6,New_Katipunan,3,Mon Jun 1 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"I'm still rooting for Romania to win, they deserve it after all this.   I am too, and that's part of why I think it's fortunate the war ended when it did. In addition the nuclear carpet bombing that was likely to continue and even intensify those interior shots showed an interior Russia re-armed with large numbers of units. I'm not sure Romania could have fought those off. Best it ended when it did."
civAIgames,3839o6,an_actual_potato,3,Mon Jun 1 18:32:13 2015 UTC,"As it stands, it'd be nice if Romania got some help from another civ against Russia. However what's left of Novgorod still stands between Russia and Norway, and Egypt needs to destroy the Huns to reach Russia, and Ramesses seems to want to take his sweet time with that. Which is why Romania must face Russia on its own."
civAIgames,3839o6,New_Katipunan,5,Mon Jun 1 18:48:03 2015 UTC,"Egypt also isn't geographically positioned very well to project force onto southern Russia. If Romania loses it will be largely because they didn't have an ally to rope into the fight. This is my one major beef with four cornered, hard-walled maps. You get major powers in those corners who don't have to worry about two of their flanks and are thus able to really punish those states that do border them without having to worry greatly about their rearguard. A lot of AI game winners have been produced from those sorts of situations (see Bosnia in the Italy AI game)."
civAIgames,3839o6,an_actual_potato,4,Mon Jun 1 18:51:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Egypt also has no way to bring ships onto the Black Sea, so even when their land units do manage to capture San Sebastian, Attila can easily retake it with ships, despite the Huns being much weaker than Egypt. I mentioned the ""corner"" issue myself in an earlier installment of this series, where I also said that I admired Rome precisely because they managed to come out dominant from a central start where they had to fight constant wars with enemies on all four sides. Romania, of course, has now earned that same distinction, perhaps even more impressively."
civAIgames,3839o6,New_Katipunan,4,Mon Jun 1 18:57:46 2015 UTC,"Rome had in fact quite isolated start. The peninsula is well-protected by alps, and early AI didn't really use ships. Sure, they faced really strong Austria and Germany, but those weren't so big threats.  Romania however has been impressive. When Poland took Iasi and was closing on Carol's capital, I was 100% sure they would be out soon. But by beelining artillery, Romania rose into the superpower it's now. That was a really smart move!"
civAIgames,3839o6,New_Katipunan,3,Mon Jun 1 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"Aye, Rome was only central in the sense of starting near the middle of the map, with Carthage and Morocco south of them, Spain to the west, Greece to the east, and Austria and Germany to the north. However, the Mediterranean helped protect them from all but the last two. Romania's rise really happened against all odds, yeah."

civAIgames,3839o6,srolanh,2,Mon Jun 1 19:51:35 2015 UTC,"If Romania could turn all those paratroopers they've got into XCOMs, that'd be great.  I would have said that atom bombs are little more than a nuisance against Deity AIs with large empires, because of how huge their growth and production bonuses are, especially when targeted at cities behind the front lines where they don't manage to kill many military units. But when it's about 10 atom bombs, that still kinda stings a little. And when it's 14 nuclear missiles, which can remove cities from existence, that's a little pants-wettingly scary."
civAIgames,3839o6,dexter_ramone,2,Mon Jun 1 20:07:03 2015 UTC,"Russia has a lot of land, which of course brings a lot of strategic resources. And you know Catherine's UA.  While Romania has risen into fame against all odds, Russia hasn't done bad either. Due to Novgorod's ability being bugged, they were basically unable to expand without attacking the strong Huns. And remember that Novgorod was almost as advanced as Russia when the war started, and Alexandr hadn't lost a war before."

I spawned a Keshik, I got 5 movement. I sent my horseman into some ruins way far away (that 14 movement is ridiculous) and he turned into a Keshik, went down to 5 movement. It looks like the only units that count as mounted for that are Knights, Cavalry, Horsemen, and Lancers. Mongolian observation 2: the 10x mod does NOT apply to UU abilities. I spawned myself some warriors in a line with a khan behind them and some venetian spearmen on the other side of my warriors and declared war on venice. The warriors healed 25 per turn, (10+15 from khan ability) but not anything more. They also only got a +15% combat modifier from being near the Khan."

civAIgames,3820fx,TA_knight,2,Mon Jun 1 09:30:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah no problem! I was curious myself after you mentioned it.    ...I still totally think Mongolia will win. Brazil will be tough to beat though, if past games and current empire/army size are any indication."

civAIgames,3820fx,orderofolav,2,Mon Jun 1 08:32:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I can change that in the other matches if youd like. I did domination only since that makes the AI more aggressive, and combined with the agressive AI mod, I expect a more interesting game overall."
civAIgames,3820fx,SuperiorJ,3,Mon Jun 1 08:33:37 2015 UTC,"Leave it, IMO, some UAs will make other victories a forgone conclusion, while domination is interesting due to AI not knowing how to make use of their abilities."

civAIgames,37xy5h,misko91,1 point,Sun May 31 18:15:03 2015 UTC,"It's pretty useful though, given A: happiness is less of a problem for most AIs (although it is a problem for muscovy, somehow), and B: the civs in this game have an absurd number of cities."
civAIgames,37xy5h,orderofolav,1 point,Sun May 31 22:16:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for the AI it is A okay, and as for the human players it still has upsides since burning cities grants golden age points and thus happiness. It is probably too good if you only have warmongering in mind (which I for sure did), just balance the politics with the AI well and you can take on any empire with some cannons and allot of cavalry to snipe the low health cities.   I guess I tried to give some downsides because deep down I felt it was kinda OP which is a dirty word to me. It is the most empty and most used critique on steam by mod users towards the creators which really bothers me, besides I believe you can call anything in the Vanilla game OP in the right situation."
civAIgames,37xy5h,Who_is_Atlas,4,Mon Jun 1 10:59:42 2015 UTC,Rome really needed to press the advantage they had on Iberia a few parts ago.  Now Portugal looks unstoppable.
civAIgames,37xy5h,sparklethong,3,Sun May 31 13:48:57 2015 UTC,At least Rome woke up a bit and realized they had to eat as much of the Commonwealth as possible before everyone else did.
civAIgames,37xy5h,Ignus_,2,Sun May 31 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"At this point, I think only a Russo-Roman coalition will be able to take down Iberia effectively."
civAIgames,37xy5h,sparklethong,1 point,Sun May 31 15:32:45 2015 UTC,Depending on when and how the final war starts it really could still be any of the three.  It's still a really exciting game at the end.
civAIgames,37xy5h,misko91,1 point,Sun May 31 20:11:42 2015 UTC,"That's unlikely: looking at the game, Iberia and Russia are mutual fans, who are united in their hatred of Rome.  The Romans still have the most stuff though: Portugal may match (if not beat) Byzantium stat for stat, but their minor partner Spain is weaker then Byzantium's minor Rome. If Roman has time to build up, they could field a much larger army then either team; it's a question of whether Iberia will press their advantage now."

civAIgames,37xy5h,New_Katipunan,3,Sun May 31 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"Losing 37 cities in one go, that's got to be rough. I mean, you really gotta cheer for Poland or Poland-Lithuania whenever they appear in an AI-only game, since they almost always put up a good fight against multiple enemies despite being completely surrounded by said enemies. In this case, Team Commonwealth beat Team Germany into irrelevance, and then beat Team Russia in a war after Russia had had hundreds of turns of peace to prepare, and then beat Team Rome, the world superpower.  But then every single team left (even the irrelevant Germans) declared war on them, and although they fought hard, that was too much for anyone to handle. Their central location really makes it difficult to win.  Now the three superpowers are Team Iberia, Team Rome, and Team Russia. Someone put Team Germany out of their misery already. It's hilarious how despite being reduced to a one-city wonder, Bavaria has hogged the position of World Congress host forever."

Let's just get this one city...  150 turns later, and they're still stuck at that one city. In fact, I'm not sure if they're even trying, they're just standing there. It would be nice if this civ could accomplish something, anything, it's all right there for the taking.

I removed Venice from the lineup due to it being either them or Poland, and I would rather see Poland in the game. More interesting. Deity difficulty. Marathon Speed. Large map (even though meant for 10, only being used by 7.). I am not entirely sure what map type to pick yet. If anyone responds before I get everything else set up, I'll put it to that. Guess not. Map type will be Fractal. We will see how well this works out. Well that was a good test game I guess. I didn't know Casimir would break the game with his free social policies, so I didn't have save social policies as an option, and I did too large of a map.

It works but I think it could be better, don't remember what it's called though. ...if someone can make me a map of whatever they want with like maybe 25 AIs I could probably do that without problems. so a 26 person map.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=239794296  Here's the aggressive AI mod.

civAIgames,37qhk7,GRI23,5,Fri May 29 17:13:14 2015 UTC,What about doing six games of 7 civs (so that each civ gets a match) and then have a grand finale with the top two from each game?  The map could be fractal on historic with the aggressiveness mod. I don't know what you think but I think it would be better than trying to slog through a large match like TPang is.

Don't know if that'll work out though :/  Edit: Upon further inspection it is worth noting that the vast majority of Russia's remaining melee units, which there are only about a dozen of, are gunships, while Romania has doubled down and built huge numbers of AA missiles. That could actually work out really well, esp as they can rush those AAs onto the field very quickly, with their high move."
civAIgames,37fws8,an_actual_potato,4,Wed May 27 15:02:44 2015 UTC,I have this feeling that Russia is going to be left with nothing but rocket artillery and no melee units and Romania is just going to sweep through and put Catherine back in her place. They should not make peace now because making peace will give time for Russia to rebuild its army.
civAIgames,37fws8,Admiral_Cloudberg,2,Wed May 27 19:58:56 2015 UTC,"I dearly hope your correct, but if Russia puts its production to use building any, say, tanks or infantry then, well, it's all over. The AI has been impressively stupid so far in just spamming missiles and gunships, which the AA loaded Romanians can certainly take advantage of. Still, that technology and manpower advantage is quite intimidating."
civAIgames,37fws8,an_actual_potato,3,Wed May 27 20:35:56 2015 UTC,"It's important to note that Russia has the largest military by the numbers only because they've built so many nukes.

civAIgames,37fws8,Admiral_Cloudberg,2,Wed May 27 20:39:41 2015 UTC,Ha! Nukes count as soldiers? That does help.

civAIgames,37fws8,Corbutte,2,Wed May 27 21:04:31 2015 UTC,"Here's hoping Romania can put the Russian bear in its place.  Like others have mentioned, Russia's military strength is at around 1,750,000, while Romania's is at around 1,300,000. However, nukes add so much to the military strength, and Russia has so many of them, that if you subtract them, Russia's true military strength is likely to be much lower than 1,300,000. Will this be the beginning of Russia's decline?  Even if Russia uses the atom bombs, it wouldn't help much. You'd be surprised how little an atom bomb does to a Deity AI with many cities. And the AI only ever targets cities, never concentrations of units. And it will not target any city where the blast radius would reach even one tile of its own or any other neutral country's territory.  When Romania liberated Iasi there were 9 air units in it, I wonder if any of those were nukes and if any were caught and destroyed?"

civAIgames,37dj2h,Darth_Kyofu,3,Wed May 27 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"If I were you, I would start again, but with different civs and Info Addict. Here are my suggestions: Replace the HRE with this version. Just replace the name and position of the capital to Nuremberg. Why? Because JFD's version can't found cities and would be the same as having Venice in the game. Remove Egypt and change the place/location of the Arabian capital to Cairo, since the Abbasids were the main caliphate on the renaissace and its capital was Cairo. The Ayyubids and Umayyads were way before Renaissance. Add Sardinia-Piedmont, but change the capital to Cagliari. Change the location of Istanbul to where it really is. Add the Papal States, but move it slightly more the south if necessary (or Florence more to the north). Add Ireland Add Morocco Add Denmark-Norway Add Switzerland Replace Poland with Poland-Lithuania Replace Songhai with Mali Add Netherlands Also, make sure you check the option that makes city-states start at TSL and add only the ones that existed during renaissance. If you don't find enough, then make some Ottoman-conquered cities as city-states. If you feel you have excess city-states, delete some of their settlers."
civAIgames,37dj2h,Darth_Kyofu,2,Sat May 30 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestions!  Yeah, I decided that I would start again.  (Partially because I don't have another good excuse for why I didn't update Friday... but also because of reasons similar to those you and others mentioned.)  I'll add as many of those suggestions as I can, seeing that I agree with most of them.  I'm not sure how to do some of those things, such as adding only certain city states (I mean, I can move and edit the locations and names, but I don't know how to do it otherwise) however hopefully that won't get too much in the way.  Also, something I'm not sure about - should I add the Huns?  I know, I know, they have absolutely nothing to do with the Renaissance, but I really need another Asian civ, and the Huns spawn inside the map bounds and they could potentially act as the Mongolians, which reached their peak shortly before the Renaissance.  It would be a bit anachronistic to have them at the same time as Peter the Great and his contemporaries, but something has to be done."
civAIgames,37dj2h,Darth_Kyofu,2,Sun May 31 00:27:12 2015 UTC,"By adding CSs, I meant change the name of any that didn't exist during Renaissance to one that did, and if you don't find enough names, delete their settler and effectively have one (or more) less CS. About the Asian civ, you could add the Sibir Khanate, which existed during renaissance. You will have to change the capital to Chimgi-Tura (for location reference, see the modern city of Tyumen. If it still doesn't fit the map, you'll have to move it closer) By the way, if you want, you can also add Bohemia, Hungary, JFD's Scotland under James VI and Croatia (if you have to choose between Hungary/Bohemia/Croatia, I'd say Bohemia because I don't think I've ever seen it on an AI-only game). I also thought about adding a Teutonic civ to the Baltic, but couldn't find any."
civAIgames,37dj2h,JayRizzly,1 point,Sun May 31 00:59:06 2015 UTC,"By the way, you should wait until JFD releases his Mehmed version of the Ottomans and decide wether you want to replace Suleiman or not (the Ottomans in vanilla have a good UU, but that's about it). Again, if necessary, don't forget to move Istanbul to the right place, unless Mehmed's capital is Edirne."
civAIgames,37dj2h,Darth_Kyofu,0,Wed Jun 3 03:56:39 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion or input, but you could put Catherine of Russia in alongside Peter.  Peter's Russia, according to what I just read, was a Westernized Russia, while Catherine's was considered the Golden Age of Russia, whilst being ruled by a female German.  Both are kind of a Renaissance one being the Russian's culture becoming more Westernized, and the other with continued the former's westernization while dismantling his social reform.   Though it would be weird to have two Russia's.    Source"

civAIgames,37dj2h,orderofolav,0,Wed May 27 16:09:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions!  I would have added Morocco, however they didn't really do anything during that time period, so far as I know.  Meanwhile, the Songhai managed to establish a strong empire around that time that survived off of trade.  Also, as I said, Arabia is relevant because of its participation in inciting the crusades, with indirectly caused the beginning of the Renaissance due to foreign ideas being imported to Europe by returning soldiers.  Also, if I removed it, it would just give the Egyptians more land to settle, leading to another superpower.  I do agree that a few civs are a bit isolated though... I just have nothing to place there."
civAIgames,37dj2h,SuperWeegee4000,2,Wed May 27 19:50:59 2015 UTC,"Morocco is the empire that destroyed the Songhai empire lol. The renaissance was when Morocco kind of flourished sandwiched between three world superpowers (Portugal, Spain, and the Ottomans). It was during the 16th century that Ahmed defeated the Portuguese invasion stripping Portugal of all of it's heirs forcing Portugal to unite with Spain for a good century. Portugal would never bounce back from this humiliation. To this day in Portugal they still tell tales about their lost King Sabastien returning to bring Portugal back to its former glory (a cult known as Sabstienism).  So considering that Morocco defeated two of the powers you put during this period, it only makes sense to include Morocco in it because it was actively involved during that period. Sorry if I sound like a douche. I'm being nit-picky I know. This is just in case you were interested. Renaissance period was in between the 14th and 17th century if my memory serves me well."

Corsica could have challenged Bosnia, but their military wasn't as big as it could have been for some reason, and Sicily attacked them at the same time.  You could say this was the most predictable AI match, but it wasn't exactly, since after Bosnia got the early lead they proceeded to do nothing with it for a long time. Then there were rapid and massive power shifts, such as Sicily expanding on to the mainland, then Liechtenstein exploding to superpower status, then just as rapidly being taken down by an expanding Corsica and Genoa, then Corsica turning on its erstwhile Genoan ally. And then Bosnia decided to rejoin the fray by taking Liechtenstein out, which culminated in their victory.  Still though, that size 102 Corsican capital. How is that even..."

Despite their enormous size, they lost on all fronts, losing cities to both Team Iberia and Team Commonwealth.  Team Commonwealth takes the credit for fighting three other teams at the same time, but despite doing well against Team Roman, they lost cities to Team Scandinavia and Team Iberia. Team Iberia did well throughout, taking cities from both Team Scandinavia and Team Roman. Team Scandinavia did eliminate Prussia though, and might be able to eliminate Team Germany altogether."

civAIgames,36l7z7,Sprinklesss,2,Thu May 21 18:33:21 2015 UTC,"I want to make the games have more of a chance factor. Plus fractal gives variety and civs with naval UU's can use them more effectively than if they were on a Pangea map. Even with the size difference the Huns had many chances to gain the upper hand on Japan and didn't, it's more of the AI not acting quick enough than having more land. Don't forget that the Huns had more cities than Japan for a while and didn't capitalize, it's not about how much land you have it's how you use it."

civAIgames,36dnpk,New_Katipunan,3,Wed May 20 08:34:23 2015 UTC,"This AI-only match is very well-balanced - although superpowers are emerging, it took them a lot of struggle to get to where they are, and there are many large and powerful nations distributed around the map. Even at this relatively late stage in the game there is no one superpower that is going to be the obvious winner. Everyone has been fighting everyone else, especially civs in the middle. A civ may lose a city to another civ, which then loses it, not to its original owner, but to a third civ. That's how fluid the situation is.  Russia seems to be rising up, but their happiness is poor, which is why they raze cities. Rome doesn't have that disadvantage and still has far greater production than Russia does. Unlike Russia, which started in the corner of the map and therefore had two of its flanks automatically secured, Rome started right in the middle, and had to fight endless wars with neighbors to the south, north, east, and west. Yet it emerged from all these wars as one of the world superpowers. There's also Egypt. Egypt's performance against Rome in the last war was surprisingly lackluster, but they annihilated Israel to make up for it."

Also he only has 38 of the 42 civs while I have all of them competing (even the really bad ones cough indonesia cough). Finally I would like this to be more community oriented i.e making brackets beforehand, speculating winners, voting on the next winners etc. And though I have watched some of his videos at your mention I think an annotated album gives people more time to look at and move at their own pace.

civAIgames,362mlh,Dolphin_dane,2,Sat May 16 06:04:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the appreciation; I'm trying my best to make it fresh and interesting.   I plan on continuing this to the end (or as close as possible, my computer is great but I know how games can get funky as turns go on), and there will most likely be a ton of parts too - each one being only 10 to 15 turns in the early game; there's soo much going on.   Anyhow, need to get back to commenting part 3..."
civAIgames,362mlh,Dolphin_dane,2,Sat May 16 06:16:23 2015 UTC,When will part three be out?
civAIgames,362mlh,Iamnotwithouttoads,2,Sat May 16 12:51:53 2015 UTC,I'm going to try to get it out in a few hours. (2 and a half I expect assuming I'm lazy)  There's a lot of stuff to sort and the text is monstrous in amount. I won't be able to get them daily (due to these reasons) but I should be able to get 4 out as well tomorrow.

civAIgames,362mlh,EmperormattXIV,2,Sat May 16 13:03:00 2015 UTC,Sounds fantastic! Sending a message now.
civAIgames,362mlh,BlakeHighborn,2,Sat May 16 13:07:52 2015 UTC,Team Wales!!!!!
civAIgames,362mlh,Dolphin_dane,2,Fri May 15 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"This seems like a cool game so far, I'll be supporting Cornwall, I liked that Penzance (pennsans) is in the right location, but was surprised to find out that my house is now in a desert!  One question, it seems that tiles around some cities are being captured, before the city, but without a citadel, is this a mod or something else I don't know about?"
civAIgames,361nx7,lungora,20,Fri May 15 10:15:09 2015 UTC,"This looks fantastic, I love the density of regions usually represented by only one or two civs each. Could you perhaps show us each civ at some point so we can get some background before it really kicks off?"
civAIgames,361nx7,Iamnotwithouttoads,8,Fri May 15 11:19:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the comment. I thought it (the scale and region) might be fun to do, and so far it has been. Glad you enjoyed the meager amount so far.  I plan to do a look-over of each civ at turn 50 as the start of part 3. (part two is straight off the end of this bit) At that point (where I have my game paused now) each civ has a fairly solid base, and not too much has really happened yet. (apart from a little bit of war, which is inevitable.)  What did you think of the commentary? I'm trying to add a lot of flavor and shy away from a dry album, but is it too much?"
civAIgames,361nx7,BlakeHighborn,9,Fri May 15 11:28:17 2015 UTC,"Not the OP you were replying to, but I really like your style of commentary. Too often these games get boring when commentary is just ""Here's this civ,"" ""Here's this civ,"" ""Civ X declared war on Civ Y."" The flavor you added, I like and I'd say to keep it up in future parts. I know all be watching because I have a weak spot for any game with Prussia in it."
civAIgames,361nx7,orderofolav,3,Fri May 15 12:23:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll try it keep it up then, and also aim to see a bit more of Prussia too.    Writing up the next set of comments now, and without giving away too much, Prussia is doing well."
civAIgames,361nx7,Trias171,4,Fri May 15 12:45:08 2015 UTC,"Nah It's fine, although maybe some more observational comments and background info would be nice.  Like, why Portugal is a replacement for the Hanze (a smart choice btw) , why you decided to make the big European rivers like that (really awesome IMO) and why you be making fun of Dutchies :P"
civAIgames,361nx7,Draeren,5,Fri May 15 12:31:57 2015 UTC,"I can do that, sure. If you're wondering about those specific things right now, I'll answer the three here now.  Portugal for the Hanseatic league was due to firstly, I like their color - the blue on white is really nice. Secondly, though the map is lacking city-states, (due to crashing on launch that I finally decided to just start without) the civ artwork fits, as does the trade bonuses based on resources, as does the unique boat unit. Honestly, if I were to make a Hansa civ it would resemble Portugal quite a bit.  Question two is because rivers (the big ones, and there are plenty of small ones too on the map) were vastly more important as barriers, trade conductors and boats COULD sail down the big paths. By making them coast tiles, these things become true. The massive increase in coast amounts on the ocean pats (the Baltic sea is all coast) is due to the scale decrease - there is much more shallow water at this scale, and it allows better pre-caravel naval combat and movement.  The Dutch mocking is due to the fact that I am half Dutch myself, being brought up in an anglo household. We love to joke about the swamppeople on the 'other' side of our family. I have a strong bias for the Dutch in this game (see the marshland amount and the two Belgiums (one is Flanders), and the dutchie mocking will only continue. :P"
civAIgames,361nx7,Trias171,7,Fri May 15 12:44:18 2015 UTC,"This is my first AI game; and the introduction part. The selection of civs was based entirely on my own opinions, and is quite bias towards the early eras on purpose.  I made the map for this, based on memory and a base images from Google. The game itself is inspired by all AI only matches, particularly the Scandinavia and British Isles ones; alongside the fact that I wanted one focused on this region since the craze began.  I have the next 25 turns filmed, and there has been no crashes so far so it should all be good for a long while. Please, do tell me what you think, and ways to improve on everything."
civAIgames,361nx7,Draeren,3,Fri May 15 10:19:59 2015 UTC,"Love it so far! I really dig the map also, do you have it uploaded anywhere? Also how did you get tsl to work? I would love to play this map but with maybe less specific region civs, England, France, Dutch, Germany etc."
civAIgames,361nx7,MrEnderGhast,2,Wed May 20 21:49:34 2015 UTC,I believe he placed them all manually.
civAIgames,361nx7,AllKnowingFez,2,Wed May 20 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"I did, but. I would really like to get TSL working for it (with mods) somehow, but I haven't been able to understand how Gedemon works his code to tie in a similar system.  If you or anyone passing through knows how to set up TSL with an easyish explanation, I would be stoked to learn."
civAIgames,361nx7,AllKnowingFez,2,Thu May 21 00:52:22 2015 UTC,Ah fair enough! Yeah I don't have the patience or know how to place each civ in the correct TSL. So I was hoping you had some easy way such as in YNMP that comes pre loaded with TSL. Maybe your map could be integrated into that ?
civAIgames,361nx7,RemindMeBot,3,Thu May 21 01:06:06 2015 UTC,"I would love to, and that was my plan. (and still is if I can figure the code out, LUA is confusing compared to C-bases that I normally work with)  As for manual movement, it's a patience thing with IGE - one unit at a time across the map into the right spots. However,m that method can't work for a legit game sadly."
civAIgames,361nx7,Fusion_Spark,2,Thu May 21 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the appreciation!  As for the map, I'm going to be doing a little touching up in the southernmost regions in the next day or two before I put it on the workshop. It'll be released alongside a. Black and Caspian Sea map of the same scale, which. I still have to do the rivers on.  As for TSL, as /u/Draeren said, I moved them all from their random locations manually with IGE to their locations. I would love to integrate TSL, but I'm afraid I simply don't know how."
civAIgames,361nx7,Fusion_Spark,2,Thu May 21 00:58:41 2015 UTC,If you were interested I believe somewhere on the YnAEMP page there's some information that explains the process behind adding support for your map.
civAIgames,361nx7,T-A-W_Byzantine,6,Thu May 21 02:00:30 2015 UTC,I like it. It looks like a great start. There were far more civs that I expected from a region like the North Sea which I like. Keep up the good work!
civAIgames,361nx7,T-A-W_Byzantine,2,Fri May 15 10:58:39 2015 UTC,"It surprised me too actually; and while I cheated in a few places (Munster, Obrodites, Hansa, Blackfeet as Sami, and then a few swap-outs I did because I didn't like the mod that would fit (Novgorod, Vandals)) I think it's great that we can focus onto a sammler region and have a civ to fill every blank spot.   As to keeping it up; I plan on it, glad you enjoyed."
civAIgames,361nx7,Dolphin_dane,4,Fri May 15 13:07:41 2015 UTC,Could you please have a list of civs competing? I'm having a hard time following.
civAIgames,361nx7,Dolphin_dane,6,Fri May 15 22:57:58 2015 UTC,"The list of civs and game-play mods'll be up at the start of part 3; but I have to type it up somewhere anyways - give me about an hour and I'll reply or edit them in here.

I'll have to figure a way to ""remove"" them then. Do you have any suggestions that aren't a total, instant wipe? However, did they not take part in wars during the Scandinavia AI battle? My version is a bit older than that at least, so I guess it'll be better to just wait right now. idk though.  As for the next part, its on its way, and I'm almost done the commentary.

I've been looking for an Oceania map with Australia and the Philippines but there doesn't seem to be one. The Pacific Ocean map from Paradise Found is good though, but doesn't show very much of Australia."

In every AI match containing the Qin that Have finished, they have won. :(  I don't know about other people, but I want to see Asia Revamped without Qin."
civAIgames,360y0f,EmeraldRange,3,Fri May 15 06:19:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd really like this too. Replace the Qin with vanilla China, and perhaps swap a few other civs too for some variety. (I'd like to see Champa). The Asia match was a really good watch (read?) and I'd love a revamp as well.  On the topic of other locations (to OP and anyone else really), I'm currently in progress of a 42civ North Sea match, and will have the first part up by Sunday Today [Edit: I decided to cut the first part into a small intro of thirty turns and a second big bit that I can comment on after I drop the first bit] - so, that's a thing. And, the Oceania match would be awesome if you have a map."

You may install mode from workshop like Song of Fire and Ice, with true starting locations in Westeros and then watch the AI game of thrones. This could be extremely interesting.  Anyway, I could suggest looking for another settings, maps, mods, conditions for AI battles. Ancient TSL start in real map has quickly become classic and I think people would appreciate game of another kind."

It would be hard to do commentary, but it's a nice idea nonetheless.  As for the Ancient TSL start part, I'm kinda sticking to the continents theme, but I'll try doing some random maps as well (I'm still debating on whether doing the Oceania map on a real Pacific or a random archipelago map.)"
civAIgames,360y0f,Iamnotwithouttoads,1 point,Fri May 15 05:55:24 2015 UTC,Maybe a real pacific map but with smaller islands balanced out with increased size (or amount of islands) to allow for equality. Also potentially adding Southeast Asia to put some of the civs with weaker starts on.

civAIgames,35y6s6,GnuSlashTortoise,6,Thu May 14 16:19:05 2015 UTC,"Sure! The UA causes enemy cities to enter resistance if Qin's military power in the area is greater than the defender's. Against humans, this isn't quite as unbalanced but the defending AI don't seem to account for it really well.   Qin also gets passive great general points though its barracks replacement. The combination is pretty great."

civAIgames,35k87r,dexter_ramone,8,Mon May 11 07:47:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's reasonable to expect the reader to be ok with the fact that the game probably won't have an ending. I personally find that it makes the rare game that does finish so much more satisfying (lookin' at you, Scandinavia)."
civAIgames,35k87r,Corbutte,7,Mon May 11 05:12:19 2015 UTC,"Speaking for my series personally, it's just that this is a very difficult time of year for those of us still in school. I have AP exams all over the place, and realistically I need to put those ahead of annotating slides. That being said, as of about 1,150 slides in, only four civs are eliminated. Getting to the end would require me filming ~6000 slides, then going back and re-watching the slides to remember what happened, then re-annotating the slides and trying to keep it tense. It honestly wouldn't be worth doing (or fun to do) if I already knew how it ended."

But that's just me.  I'm sure there will be an audience for what ever you do.  Side note: One of the biggest source of technical issues that Tpang has in the battle royales comes from having to close and restart the game. I know practically, it is hard to keep one game from start to finish on this scale, but filming your future AI battles many parts in advance might help."

Team Germany did really well, a lot better than I had anticipated, given their circumstances.  The border civs have fewer flanks, and fewer worries.  Not fully on-topic, but I thought team Iberia's decisions to send fleet after fleet to Norway was hysterical.  They showed that they could go toe-to-toe with team Roman in Africa, but decided to sail dozens and dozens of ships and land units to retake some outposts so far removed from their core they were a liability.    The other funniest part for me was when Poland fucked over Lithuania and chose the mainline ideology :P"

Sometimes my game start on the first load and sometimes it crash. It can get pretty frustrating, but I'm pretty used to it by now.   My advice to you would be to try and lower the graphics. Also another thing to think about is how big the game is. I once did a AI only with 42 civs on the Europe map and at turn 300+ it crashed at every loading screen so I ended up quiting it. But in the series I'm doing now I only got 16 civs and I barely have any crashes.   My PC specs:  Taurus eSport   GPU - Geforce GTX 650  CPU - Intel Core i5-3470. 3.20 Ghz."

I would much rather wait a month or even like 5 months for a FR on the Westeros Map than get one on the current map sooner. At this point it doesn't feel like a Game of Thrones, it feels like a couple of civs fighting with some names changed.  Just a thought."

Oh and DJSHenninger's Córdoba in Spain to restrain France a bit.   Lastly maybe the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Ghadaffi's Libya on the steamworkshop by kelnahas to crowd Africa even more :)  Overall I think this is fun, we all know by now how most Civ's react/ competitive they are and how good they do on their historically correct places (aka Greece/Netherlands always losing).

I would restart!  Look at Kaffe's Italian game for instance, everybody was already calling Bosnia out for winning in the first part, something like that really kills the suspense and makes people quite indifferent to what will happen next.   If I were you I would even out the map as much as possible, let the AI do their thing on equal basis. This also means that settling them to close to each other unnecessarily cripples one of the two (or both) which kind of defeats the purpose of them being in the game in the first place.     Anyway I'm sure you yourself know a couple of more civ's you could add in, but looking at the map as of right now Africa, Russia, Arabia, Iberia and the black sea era are extremely empty and will surely result in snowballing.  I am really looking forward to your game btw, I love Europe, it has large patches of land but also enough water for naval warfare. I will definitely follow your game :)"

Ther Turks' early expansion into Greater Serbija means if they can stay out of wars, they can expand pretty safely to have both that AND most if not all of Asia Minor.  Saying that, the only way the Russians weren't going to be a superpower in this game is if Ukraine could match them. Sadly, they couldn't, and I think Stalin is in position to really dominate.  The brief but undecisive war between Poland and Lithuania probably both means they fall behind the Iron Curtain before it's all said and done.  France should pounce on the Spanish colonies before she has time to regroup and consolidate power on Iberia.  Looking forward to the next installment."

I think Finland had taken Trondheim, Koenigsberg, and Stockholm already. It would only have taken them a dozen turns at most to capture the remaining two capitals anyway, so I think we can say that this AI-only game has come to a satisfying conclusion."

Religions in Civ are enhanced, not enchanted or enchanced.  Benelux is spelled like that, not Benolux.  ""A lot"" are two separate words, it's not alot.  Overall though, this is very enjoyable!

War usually breaks out between France and Brazil over French Guiana, and between the UK and Argentina over the Falklands. Made worse by the fact that France and the UK are Freedom and Brazil and Argentina are Order.  If I remember correctly, spaceship parts have been made extremely expensive in this scenario. So expensive that it takes a large high-production core city with a spaceship factory (preferably both spaceship factories) in it to build a part in anything less than hundreds of turns. The fact that civs are churning them out already (this is Deity difficulty, right?) means that we might see a Space victory before anything else, which I never would have expected on a lower difficulty."

civAIgames,30p2en,sundubujjigae,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:05:19 2015 UTC,"Cordoba is an city in Spain that once belonged to Arabia so I decided to include it because of that. By Europeans, I meant white caucasian Europeans. Sorry for the confusion. I included the Sami because I thought they were indegenous to the area, but then when i found out they weren't Mongoloid so that was a mistake on me I guess. XD"

civAIgames,2zjg0k,Ponicrat,1 point,Thu Mar 19 04:21:52 2015 UTC,"Well, well. At last an AI-only game with the Philippines in it. Unfortunately as I predicted, they're handicapped by the tiny amount of land they have to start with. Oh well, having the smallest military in the world doesn't really matter yet since no one can attack them anyway. But they have to focus on getting Optics as fast as possible and settling overseas. And sheesh, the Philippines should have built the Banaue Rice Terraces at least!  Most of the religions in the game seem to be based in or near Africa, with only two located elsewhere. That means that Wakan Tanka can easily dominate the whole of North and South America, and Buddhism can dominate most of the Asia-Pacific, giving the Cree and the Maurya a significant advantage."

civAIgames,2ze3ng,dexter_ramone,3,Tue Mar 17 20:47:39 2015 UTC,"This concept has potential. As someone else said, with civs unable to advance beyond the Classical Era, UUs could become very important, since they'll be around forever. And as far as I can tell, all the civs in the game have either Ancient or Classical UUs (I wonder if you set it up that way on purpose). Not only the UUs but also the UBs should prove very useful (although Persia's UB is a Renaissance era building, unfortunately).  Bohemia is very stronk, maybe the actual Bohemia civ should have been in the game. ;)  Besides Bohemia, Sparta capturing Corinth was interesting. I wonder if one city-state will end up uniting all of Greece?"
civAIgames,2ze3ng,boywar3,3,Thu Mar 19 17:45:29 2015 UTC,"The Inter-Greek wars was something i'd been looking forward too, Sparta having two cities allows them to build many more units than their counterparts and gives them a big advantage. And I can't believe what Bohemia are doing, it makes me really happy to see them growing their own little empire haha"

So yeah, this Carol is super aggresive, when he really shouldn't be. I'll tell him to fix that."
