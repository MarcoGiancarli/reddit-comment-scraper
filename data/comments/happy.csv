happy,3dz1rl,Socialyawsomepenguin,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:58 2015 UTC,"Honest question: why do you go to a barber shop to shave?   I personally grow a 7mm beard and shave my neck, which takes less than a minute with a razor (Gillette, Wilkinson, whatever works). Everyone else I know who's clean shaven uses a razor at home. Why do you pay a man to do that for you, and why do you invest the time to go there and wait?  Thanks."
happy,3dz1rl,Baghdadification,4,Mon Jul 20 23:15:08 2015 UTC,"I get mild razor burn on my neck and throat if I use a regular razor, and since I also wear a short beard that's all I need to shave. I keep it trimmed down with clippers but once or twice a month it's nice to have it done. Plus he cleans up the edges really nice. Cheeks, neckline, temples, eyebrows."
happy,3dz1rl,James_Locke,4,Tue Jul 21 04:18:25 2015 UTC,Its a both and. Hair cut and a shave. You just go for the haircut and dont shave for a few days before as an added bonus.

It was a mix of hormones, stress and food allergies.   I'm much more careful about what I put on my face now especially as far as cleansers and moisturizers."

Face was OK until I began going to the pool more often - I freaked out when 2 pimples surfaced and refused to go down for 2 weeks!!! Now I've learned my lesson and will always bring a facial cleanser with me after I've finished using the pool.

I keep them in my car to take off my makeup after work or a night out. And I take them with me on vacation and clean my face with them whenever I can. I haven't had any bad breakouts just one or two bumps here or there. And I was just at the pool this weekend and I hope nothing happens, but so far so good.   Are the pimples like white heads or cysts? If you can see in the pic, I got 1-2 cysts. I've been trying not to touch them like I used to"
happy,3duvgn,OceanCarlisle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:47:55 2015 UTC,They were more like white heads but one of them throbbed quite a bit more than usual. The pimples have now dried up but they're going to leave marks because I've been impatient enough to pop it (twice).

happy,3duvgn,Mikeastuto,2,Sun Jul 19 21:41:01 2015 UTC,Seems like it was accutane that worked (this answers both /u/OpusCrocus' post and /u/LoafPigeon's post).

Each and everyone of us find happiness in different ways, I find happiness in doing what I enjoy, which is playing video games here and there, and hanging out with my friends. One thing you don't want to do how ever, is make it ""seem"" like you are happy. Don't fake it man!

Faking happiness is one of the worst things you could do. I used to do that and nothing good came out of it, but when I did tell people, I realized there were more people there for me than I really realized. Even just getting it off your shoulders is a tremendous relief. Don't shoulder the burden by yourself, talk it out with your boyfriend.

happy,3dfuyo,geshikhte,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:21:40 2015 UTC,"This one was a government student loan and I had a student loan from the bank as well. In total when I was done school combined it was right around $42,000.  I'm in Canada and I'd say this was probably a bit above what the average was at the time I was in school. There were definitely cheaper college programs and longer more expensive programs than mine. I'm not sure what the average is for the U.S. exactly but probably more than what I had.      I finished paying back the bank loan about this time 2 years ago and my last payment on the government one was at the end of June and I just got the letter in the mail.   For a long time I wasn't very smart about paying it back and was paying the minimum for years but that's all I could afford so it really stretched out the length of time it took to pay it back. When I finished the bank loan I started snowballing all that money and as much as I could extra onto this to get paid off as fast as I could."

I tried to stay as lean as I could for other parts of my life, tried to save up as best I could for things like buying new clothes and attending various entertainment events. Didn't always work out exactly, hence the bit of credit card debt I'm getting rid of now but it definitely allowed me to be able to funnel as much as I could onto my student loans.

happy,3da26y,Kaleyedoskopic,4,Wed Jul 15 00:05:57 2015 UTC,"I am no ornithologist (or owlithologist), but IIRC from what I've seen and read, when most owls are stressed/frightened/upset:   They squint until their eyes are nearly closed (some species) They make single, high-pitched ""chirps"" in sets of like 2-5 over a small period of time (not the little twittery ululation the owl in the gif is doing) They stand really tall and straight, or tall and ""puff"" all their feathers out to look more menacing (that water looks shallow enough for it to stand in, TBH) They become very still and tense their bodies (basically readying themselves to GTFO). The stressed owls I've seen have their pupils narrow, not dilate. They dilate when they're in low light, when they're playing, and when they're hunting.   This one is literally just floating and making little cooing chirps. I think it's probably pretty relaxed."
happy,3da26y,VenetiaMacGyver,4,Wed Jul 15 14:47:41 2015 UTC,There's a TIL right now that tells how an owls eyes can't move that's why their heads can rotate so much.

happy,3c1k4o,liskoturri,35,Fri Jul 3 22:27:12 2015 UTC,I've had this guy for two years but only today took him out of the package as I've been waiting for this moment. Couple of years ago I'd never have believed that one day I might have the courage to take a toy like this to the beach and just enjoy the warm summer day. Especially on a Friday night like this when the beaches are packed and full of people.    Way into my adult life one of my biggest problems was caring too much of what other people might think. That I'd make an error and get ridiculed at or laughed upon. Make myself a fool and get embarrassed. Say something stupid and lose sleep over a stupid remark. I gave up with so many things because I was so afraid of not being and looking normal.  I finally overcame the last fear that kept me from being myself.   Today was one of the happiest days of my life.

I can't even begin to express how I feel right now, the happiness is so much, it's so big, it's completely out of my league. I don't have words, not in spanish and definitely not in english, to describe it.  After I finally moved out, and my parents went back to their homes, with a incredible and proud smile on their faces, I sat down and started to cry. Just... cry.

happy,3bl5a3,Mieksie,4,Tue Jun 30 10:44:17 2015 UTC,That is really sweet!  I recently moved to NYC and was a bit terrified about people being rude after reading that they are very kept to themselves. Surprisingly I have come across some very nice and polite people here.  I really don't know what exactly it was that I expected but it doesn't seem that much more different than Texas. I would come across a lot more friendly people in Texas but I would also come across some rude assholes.

happy,3bl5a3,JohnnyPappis,3,Tue Jun 30 13:27:05 2015 UTC,I was at taco bell and the person who ordered before me forgot to ask for guacamole.  They were going to charge this nice old lady like 50 cents.  So I said add it to my order.  Then the Taco Bell lady gives me a free cinnamon twists order.  The twists cost more than the guac!  Why not just give it to her?!
happy,3bl5a3,Smithers66,4,Tue Jun 30 15:07:16 2015 UTC,"because TB employees are empowered and allowed to make the call to give a free cinn. twist or nacho's for a mistake.. this TB employee must have done it out of seeing you do something kind. Guac is always undercounted during inventory counts, so I probably would have tried to ask to add it, but that would depend on the person making the food doing her a favor, rather than her being allowed to give a free cinn. twist.   I worked at various TB's for over 3 years :) I'm glad you had an awesome employee helping, and thank you for being awesome!"

happy,3bi1t6,PenguinsGoMeow,3,Mon Jun 29 16:30:45 2015 UTC,Congrats and good luck!   Its such an exciting but stressful process.  I promise when it's all over and you have the keys in your hands it's so worth it.  All the best!  :D
happy,3bi1t6,PenguinsGoMeow,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"I will agree that the process has been stressful, especially since they told us we won't know 100% that we got the house until closing day. Hoping everything works out for the best. This has been the most stressful month of my life!"
happy,3bi1t6,PenguinsGoMeow,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"How does that work?  Just genuinely curious as I've never heard of that.   The way it went for is was we put in an offer, it was accepted by the seller and then we had about 2 weeks to close.  But the house was off the market as of the date the seller accepted our offer so no one else could make offers."
happy,3bi1t6,mapguy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:02:20 2015 UTC,The bank that our loan is through apparently does things in a different way and doesn't approve people until closing day. Our offer was accepted on day 2 of this process. The rest of this has been getting documentation and such approved for the home loan. The house has been under contract since our offer was accepted. It has just taken this long for all the details to come together.
happy,3bi1t6,raendrop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"Aha i understand now.  I thought you meant you wouldnt know  if the house was yours as in, you wouldnt know if the seller accepted your offer until  the closing date.    Well, best of luck!  I'm sure it'll all work out.  It's super stressful for sure and anyone who says it isn't is nuts,  lol.  Just stay positive and looking forward to how awesome it's going to be owning your own house!!"

happy,3bi1t6,noreasterner,3,Mon Jun 29 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"Congrats.  Even though you didn't ask, here is a little advice.  If you two don't know much about DIY home repairs and your house isn't coming with new appliances, I'd recommend a home warranty plan.  In the last two years we've save almost 10k.  First year our hot water heater broke, was replaced for free.  Saved us around 3k.  In February our heater went.  Fixed, not replaced.  Saved just under 2k.  Two weeks ago our central air went.  Saved us 5k for a brand new unit.    For us it has been worth it, but we knew going in a lot of our appliances didn't owe us many years.  It's a wild but fun ride."

happy,3aovbs,Inquisitor1,14,Mon Jun 22 14:31:39 2015 UTC,I'll have you know that this is one of the 'Almighty' mountains from Bob's earlier seasons (I used the 'Almighty' knife to make it) . But having worked with this mountain I happen to know that it is indeed very content with being a mountain.
happy,3aovbs,lyssargh,8,Mon Jun 22 14:42:36 2015 UTC,I for one feel reassured.    Thanks for sharing.  :)
happy,3aovbs,catjuggler,6,Mon Jun 22 21:31:05 2015 UTC,That is so lovely.  Is it based on a real mountain?
happy,3aovbs,SERFBEATER,9,Mon Jun 22 11:22:30 2015 UTC,Only the ones in my imagination. I find this kind of pointy mountain easy and enjoyable to paint. The picture takes me about an hour and a half to paint but about a week to dry.
happy,3aovbs,SERFBEATER,7,Mon Jun 22 11:29:58 2015 UTC,Hey man or woman I've recently started watching Bob Ross and I really enjoy this style of painting. I have sort have wanted to try it for a couple months now but I have no idea what I really need or how much it costs. How much has it cost you to get the essentials?
happy,3aovbs,andwhatlol,25,Mon Jun 22 13:59:17 2015 UTC,"I am certainly one of those. A man to be exact.   Now let's talk art supplies. Prices will be different for you as I am British guy married to a Dutch lady. I bought some stuff in Holland and some stuff on Ebay in the UK. But we can make a start.   Bob Ross uses oil paints. I started off by buying a beginners oil paint set for about €40. The set came with 10 different paints and a few basic brushes. After getting some other stuff I only really use the box this set came in. The paint was too thin and didn't work like Bob's did. So don't waste your money in a cheap starter box.   Bob Ross uses a very firm paint which can be expensive if you buy his brand but I have bought a set of paints on eBay from a person who gave up trying and they had some good 'Windsor and newton' paints. These are working just fine. On Ebay there are several people selling used supplies and often there is still a good amount of paint left in them. I paid £30 for a box which had £100+ of supplies in it. I don't use all of it. Make a list of the colours he uses and try to find them on eBay. I'll list them at the bottom for you.   I haven't bought any liquid white as it's quite expensive but you can make your own with titanium white paint and linseed oil about 50:50 or 40:60 depending on how thick you want it. Linseed oil is only a few dollars from the art shop.   Now the essential brushes are these: A 2"" brush (I bought  a cheap house painting brush from the hardware store for €1) A 1"" brush (€1) A #6 fan brush (for happy trees - bought a real one from an art shop still only €4.50) A script liner brush ( about €3) A palette knife (you can make your own with from a scraper. But I got one in eBay for £3. It is a number 20 if that helps. Many are shaped differently to Bob's but they aren't as useful).   With these 5 tools you can paint everything he does. A lot of the difficulty I have comes from the paint being different to his. You just have to have a go. It is certainly worth having a go.   Canvases are cheap as chips and can be found in various places. I've only tried small ones so far.   Now that I've got some more experience with painting I am thinking about biting the bullet and buying some real Bob Ross brushes to see if I can get them to do what Bob's do. My brushes are very cheap and their bristles are not so strong and fall off onto the painting. But they can be £10-15 per brush. Maybe it's worth it.   Top tip from my grandad: he bought really cheap oil paint; £4 for a box of 10 paints and made them thicker with corn starch. It works for him.  Bob's colours: Titanium White  Pthalo Green  Pthalo Blue  Prussian Blue  Midnight black (I've never found  this in real life only 'Ivory black'. It is black and works)   Van Dyke Brown (you'll use lots!)   Burnt umber   Alizaron Crimson   Sap Green  Cadmium Yellow   Yellow ochre  Indian yellow  Bright red"
happy,3aovbs,Winemouth,5,Mon Jun 22 14:32:01 2015 UTC,You're amazing! I am going to give it a shot.
happy,3aovbs,Send_a_kind_pm,8,Mon Jun 22 20:36:48 2015 UTC,You will not regret it.   Bob believes that you can paint and I know you can too.

happy,3aovbs,Weed_n_Wisdom,4,Mon Jun 22 19:31:21 2015 UTC,"I used to watch the show out of nostalgia but after seeing him do the techniques and with his constant encouragement I decided to try it. If you follow is instructions you will be amazed at what you can make.   Remember there are no mistakes, only happy accidents.   If it goes wrong you can just scrape the paint of and paint over it. Or if your me you just plant a massive tree over what went wrong."

happy,3aovbs,revertive,8,Mon Jun 22 11:49:01 2015 UTC,I didn't watch an episode as I did this one. But I'm not surprised you recognise it. It looks like several pushed together. Especially the background.... And foreground...   Have you tried painting anything? I highly recommend it. Bob Ross is right. You really can do it. I have one painted a few (maybe 5 times) and it is very do able.
happy,3aovbs,CommentCalligraphy,3,Mon Jun 22 12:17:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, he did a one hour special on a painting that was very similar to this because it incorporated so many different things. No, I haven't tried painting really. I just love Bob Ross's energy, it's a nice thing to watch/listen to."

A lot of people who are anxious and/or depressed are plagued with negative self-statements, or negative self-talk like ""No one enjoys my company"", ""I screw up everything"", ""I'm stupid, a failure etc"". My paper proposed that, in these people, if we just focus on changing these types of thoughts rather than have them undergo extensive therapy for their anxiety/depression with a specialized therapist, meaningful positive changes can occur, and doing these therapies do not require having a therapist; with correct application and execution of these therapies, a lot of people could benefit without having to pay a bunch of money for specialized treatment, and also having to avoid the stigma of needing to see a therapist."

What systems, protocols, whatever they have - research that now. Figure out how you will answer the questions about your qualifications. Turn every negative into a positive.   If it's ""years of experience"", then that just means you haven't had time to learn bad habits. You won't have to unlearn anything. Make sure you know what experiences they want you to have had and see if you have ANYTHING REMOTELY SIMILAR. Play that up.   If it's experience on a particular system, if you have worked on similar systems point that out. Don't say you're sure you can pick it up quickly (that's kind of insulting to the old farts who've been doing it for years). Is there anything that teaches you this online? Research it.  What strengths can you bring them? Most candidates want to know what the co will do for them; you're going to be the opposite. You're going to look for every place where a strength YOU have will help them get where they want to be. Where DO they want to be, btw? Research that, there's plenty to find out if it's a public company...  And write a thank-you note to all the people who interview you.   This is your moment! Prepare for it, go in smiling and confident and kick ass!"

Just because people have a catch stick doesn't mean they are proffesional. That dog clearly tenses up, and they just got lucky that he didn't bite. My guess is they had already done this several times, but most people wouldn't know that because  most don't understand dogs.

There is no way a professional is going to do what that person did. Why? Because if that dog had bit someone, it would have no chance.  They probably would have put it down. You don't ""correct"" issues like that by the way. You have to train them very carefully not to have issues like that. It takes awhile.  That is a big dog. The person got really lucky that it had the food in its mouth. Where did you get that professional run around getting bit all time?  That just doesn't happen. It is embarrassing when it happens. It means you weren't paying attention to the animal and let your guard down.  I never said not to go by a dog with by the way.  Where did you get that? This particular dog is very tense and looks like he is ready to bite. You have to be careful. They didn't know this dog. It was stray.  For all they knew, it actually could have been rabid.  That is why you use a catch pull to keep the dog's mouth away from you body."

Not only can I have books, I have a shelf to put them on and they won't ever be touched or messed with by anyone but me. It sounds insane, but I don't even mind cleaning and doing the dishes because they're -my- dishes.   I own dishes.   I have a desk all to myself. I have a bed I don't have to share with anyone. I have my own bathroom and my own internet and a little porch to grow herbs and tomatoes on.   I'm okay. I'm okay and everything in my life is okay.

If you wanted to indicate plural, you have to use the word ""men"", but I think it is obvious that you were indicating that the support belonged to the one man, therefor the word should appear like this: ""man's"". The apostrophe denotes possession."

happy,396o2b,ke1ly,18,Tue Jun 9 17:29:38 2015 UTC,"I love customers who put in a good word. Like they notice everything I'm working hard for and aren't the kind of people who try to cherry pick little mistakes to fuss about. I remember this one woman who ordered a big order of smoothies over phone in the middle of a busy time, and while she was apologizing over phone for being an inconvenience I assured her it would be fine. An hour later when she came to pick her order up she found the manager and told him how friendly I was and told me I was ""literally the best employee"" she ever met. Needless to say my day was absolutely made."
happy,396o2b,HailToTheThief225,6,Tue Jun 9 18:52:53 2015 UTC,"Aah! Had the same a few days ago, I was so happy I grinned for the entire day. I was helping her find an item and did everything possible so she could have it, and she asked to speak to my manager and said very flattering things. The first time someone has asked me to lead them to a manager in order to praise something."
happy,396o2b,suchsterling,3,Tue Jun 9 23:35:51 2015 UTC,It's absolutely fantastic when managers are open to this but from experience some are not. I know in one of my jobs that if I got the manager for the customer to either compliment or complain I'd have been given out to for wasting their time. It's important to read the situation when going to give a compliment.

I think the idea of a single soul mate being the only one ever is silly because I've met more than one already.

happy,38p10j,HolleWalter,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"I would suggest that it is built in to you. You react to certain stimuli in a conditioned fashion. The conditioning becomes automatic and your emotional response is automatic. You can do it yourself (in most cases). Try this. Smile, take a deep breath, sigh from your heart. Please describe the feeling. Do it again and see if it gets stronger. Also smile at yourself in the mirror. In my case it is self explanatory and needs no external verification. Almost everyone can do that. Except people who are extremely mentally disturbed. Another example is to remember being taught what is bad. There are certain images or ideas that we associate with unhappy and bad. We learn that. Happiness is the same mechanism."

I'm 33 and I was worried it would be weird or I would have learning issues because it's been so long so let me tell you how it went:   It was amazing! It feels so good to be in class finally working towards a degree in the field I love.  No one cared about my age and it was great! Almost everyone was a decade younger and only one person asked my age by the end of the second semester.  It doesn't have anything to do with being smart! The more effort people put into a class, the better their grade! Calculus was hard, but the only way people did well was by studying, NOT by being brilliant quick witted geniuses. Their was a 'genius' at the front of our class so I asked him how he always had the best test grade. He told me 'it takes me hours every night to study and I search youtube for calc examples' --we all spent an hour or two a day and thought we were slow, he spent 3-4 and aced everything. Find classmates you can talk to!  The only way my life won't drastically improve from here on out is if I give up. Ha! I love going to school, I wouldnt even consider it!"

We're all so worried about dwindling birth rates and populations in 1st world countries, not being able to pay the pensions of the past generation, I think if more countries adopted more generous parental leaves it would make it much easier for people to have and raise kids."
happy,38ccxm,wuzizname,32,Wed Jun 3 12:56:29 2015 UTC,"As someone whose wife is due with our second child in just over 2 months, knowing that she will be off work for 8 weeks unpaid scares me.  She might have a week, maybe week and a half of PTO she can use at that point and I think we have a ""disability"" policy that will pay something, but shit, when you have a new baby is a time when you need every penny.  Not getting paid for 2 months makes it a tough squeeze if anything happens (like, my roof starting to leak and needing replaced ASAP)  Honestly, I can't complain much.  My wife and I are better off than probably 80% of Americans.  We both have stable jobs with great benefits, but it seems to me we, as a society, could be doing a whole lot better."

I'm studying systems engineering and mathematical economics right now, and I probably want to go grad school afterward, but I definitely want to spend some time in front of the blackboard.

Think of the theft as an overall win. $10k is still less expensive than what may have played out: a ring then... wedding, life expenses (house, credit card debt, child support, etc.) and subsequent divorce.

happy,37q1em,Roger_Roger,6,Fri May 29 21:49:35 2015 UTC,"I have had a fire-proof safe since high school. You used to be able to get them for not too much money at places like WalMart. I keep all my important things in there that either can't be replaced or would be a nightmare to replace like my birth cirtificate, car title, SSN card, etc. That way even in the event of a natural disaster, my stuff is safe. I think everyone should have this however I do not think that you should let anyone else know how to open it - even a family member or spouse. I liked the idea of taking a few hundred dollars when I had some spare cash and starting an engagement ring fund in my fire-proof safe.   I never in a million years would have thought my girlfriend at the time, who I wanted to marry, would have gone through my closet and opened that to steal the money I was saving to buy her a ring. I also never would have thought that she would have seen me enter my PIN while buying groceries and steal my debit card while I was sleeping to steal money from my account. Live and learn I suppose and it's kind of fucked up that it still affects how I treat all people including SOs to this day. Even if I married the love of my life tomorrow, shared finances are never a thing that will be in my future and I will never feel open to trust someone in my home or with my most personal belongings/secrets/emotions again."
happy,37q1em,franklymydeer,5,Fri May 29 23:28:43 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry that happened to you. I'm glad to hear you have recovered and moved on.   It's probably good that you were so young when that happened. If you were older and closer to retirement age, it could be very different.   Money comes and goes. Don't dwell on what was lost. Just go forward and know that you can get past obstacles like this."
happy,37q1em,Who_Wants_Tacos,3,Fri May 29 23:58:22 2015 UTC,"Depending on the country, a safe might be a better option. I'm lucky enough to live in a country where, if I put my money in a bank, I can be fairly confident that I won't lose it. But that isn't always the case."

In 8 years I have promoted 4 times and now make $50k.   On the side I have a portrait art business that keeps me busy just through word of mouth.

Training 7 hours a day in rural China. Not far from the North Korean border in fact!  I'm going back at the end of July. You can visit www.PrinceRasta.com if you like.

happy,36rffw,jxp497,1 point,Tue May 26 01:40:31 2015 UTC,"Ni hao! Back from my last adventure. I highly recommend Costa Rica, but that's another story.  I primarily lived in Su Zhou. This is where I was setting up a factory for a large medical device company (mechanical/manufacturing engineer by trade). We landed in Shanghai and would get in on a Saturday so we could shop on Sunday before driving out to Su Zhou. Su Zhou was incredible. It looked like it was 15 years ahead of Blade Runner. The neat part is that when I was there (about 4 years ago) they have this really cool place where there is a movie theatre that shows what it looked like 15-20 years ago, and it was an old fishing town. I stayed for the first three weeks in the Crowne Plaza in a suite and it was divine. Close to city center and I walked everywhere. I always walk around new places so I can fully grasp the culture and the people. I would visit bars at night and have the waitresses teach me Mandarin. I learned enough to get by, plus it was just a fun way to learn. The fourth week I was there I was asked to go to Shenyang. I can't remember the city, but two hours east of Shenyang was a foundry that was making large castings for our operation. This area was about 12mi from N. Korea... about as close as I want to get to N. Korea. In fact no on there had seen anyone who wasn't Asian. It was a very humbling experience, but a wonderful one. Since it was very primitive we spent most of our nights together (it was December) in a restaurant eating, drinking and playing guessing games, like how old do you think people are, or yelling gambi! at each other when drinking (if you hear gambi and are pointed out, you have to chug your drink). It honestly was some of the best bonding experience I ever had. Just people from different parts of the world sharing a meal and getting to know each other in a cold desolate part of the world. I made many good friends there that I still talk to on occasion. (I had a level 8 translator with me when I was there but also was with two colleagues that spoke English well too). After that week, I flew back to the US. Fun fact. China hasn't had a flight program for very long. It is not unusual for flights to get canceled just because the pilots don't show up. Always a gamble when flying in China!  One great thing about being there was that when I was wandering the streets of Su Zhou a couple approached me and asked if I wanted to join them visiting some of the very famous gardens of Su Zhou. SURE! Gordon and his wife were very nice. They paid for my admission to each garden, told me about the history behind everything and even bought me a snack. They then gave me their phone number and helped me get on a bus to get back to the hotel. They offered to give me a ride for groceries if I needed them and to come to their home in my next visit for some home made spicy dinner (I loved anything 'la').  When I went back for two more weeks I stayed in Su Zhou but visited Beijing via overnight train. I saw the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, etc. I bought local paintings from a painting school and some other students at the Forbidden City. I loved haggling with the locals. It was so much fun.  I have many, many, many more stories... If you'd like to PM me about China or any other trips I've taken, I'm very proud to talk about them. Israel, Ireland, Scotland, Aruba... list goes on.  Zàijiàn!"
happy,36rffw,Wonka_Vision,2,Thu May 28 19:47:41 2015 UTC,"I did similar thing recently, asia is really broad, what countries did you go to specifically and what were your favorites?"
happy,36rffw,ZK686,3,Thu May 21 20:43:26 2015 UTC,"Tdlr; India, Thailand and China  For this particular trip I started in India with my mom. Over the course of just under two weeks we went from Delhi to Agra to Jaipur to Varanasi and then finally to Calcutta where we met with a charity I work for. It was our first time traveling together, which was very nice.  When she left I went to Calcutta for a few weeks, where I stayed with a family and met with members of the technology sector.  During that time I was speaking with a Thai girl who I met on Omegle. Things were going well so I decided to fly to Thailand to go on a date with her. She lived in Pattaya, which is where I ended up staying in Thailand for two months.    The first time I went to Asia was back in 2012. In 2011 I was in a bad place in life and then a friend died, so I decided to go live life. First I went to Pune, India. There I basically underwent ayurvedic therapy and practiced yoga, all in an effort to recover from 3 major knee surgeries.  Then I went to Phuket, Thailand to learn Thai boxing. That was a failure, but a fun one. After a month I moved up north to Nong Khai, right along the Mekong river where Thailand meets Laos. There I volunteered as an English teacher.  Finally I went to Siping, China where for two months I lived in a kung fu academy. That was such an amazing experience.  You can read all about it in Enter the Monkey for free on www.PrinceRasta.com. The book is my life story.   Not that people would want to read it because I'm some special person, but because I'm brutally honest in recounting all the struggles I've been through in life, which people can relate to. And maybe it's motivating because I was able to turn that bad into good.    Anyway, I'd love to hear about where you've been and how you liked it."

happy,36ir1v,PrinceRasta,29,Tue May 19 18:11:56 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone, I'm Prince. Nice to meet you. The picture you see above was taken in January of this year. Here is the backstory:  Five years ago I got my first decent paying job. That's when I decided to start giving to charity - sponsoring a child from Children.org  Four years ago I quit that job and went on a trip to India. While there I decided to meet the girl I sponsored, plus her family. The experience was so touching that I vowed to help more in the future.  Last year I went from sponsoring one child to eight children, three of which live in India.  This January my mother and I went traveling together for the first time ever. We went to India and made sure to visit Calcutta so we could see the three kids and their families. Before the trip I raised $1,500 to stock the library of the charity's service center. So when we arrived to Children International, the kids, their family, my mom and I met there in the library for greetings. Then my mom decided to take out all of the kids, their siblings, and their moms for lunch. But not only that. She also bought an outfit and one toy for every kid (even the ones I don't sponsor).  The picture above shows the job that escapes many of us as we grow out of our youth. Whereas as a kid it is best to receive gifts, it seems the best way to feel that joy as an adult is to give to others.  If you'd like to read more about Children international, check out this blog post on PrinceRasta.com. Or you can just go to check out some other fun stuff.  Thanks for reading. I hope to talk to you in this comments section."

I started calling his phone, no response. I'm imagining every horrible scenario that could happen; I'm completely terrified. I finally called his work number and asked for him. I was so relieved when I heard his voice that I started sobbing and saying I was so relieved he was OK.  This, in turn, scares the hell out of him, and he's panicking thinking something happened to me.  It was 7 p.m., not a.m. like I assumed. He was still at work, and since it was summertime, it was still light out. I'd only been asleep for an hour. I'm an idiot.  But hey, at least my husband was OK. :)"

happy,36gcmo,2noson2,19,Tue May 19 05:34:35 2015 UTC,Potentially. If so here's what happens. You go to college and it changes you a lot for the better. You will get your heart broken a few times. One of those heartbraks will lead you to loose 100+lbs. You graduate and marry a redhead that you talked about liking to your friends. It is your finest hour up to where I'm at. Dad dies but we've always had a good relationship with him. Ultimately you'llfeel like nothing really went unsaid and that he knew you were okay when he passed. Dad was very proud of us. You will take a few jobs some awful others awesome. Where I'm at we haven't really found what we want to call our career but you and the wife are doing fine financially at my point  You'll pass on the opportunity to live abroad eventually you come to terms with it. You did it because you love the woman you married. It all ends up being worth it up untill now. Personally I wouldn't change a thing we do. Eventually even the parts that hurt will be valuable to you on your way to me. See you later.

Another 5 years after that, my uncle found his life partner...my uncle-in-law. And we all suddenly realized why his first marriage failed. ..he was pressured by society and family to do the ""right"" thing.   They were married for almost 30 years before my uncle passed away. My wife and I were the only members of our side of the family who accepted it. We love our uncle-in-law to bits.  I cannot fathom how people can be prejudice against their own family members to the extent they drive those members away.  May you and your wife enjoy a long and happy life.  EDIT: Gosh.

happy,367nlk,Beastmonger,12,Sun May 17 12:32:02 2015 UTC,"Not the OP, but I'll assume your question was asked in innocence (I think some people think you are judging).  I think it's as much about personal preference as it is about the style and personality of each woman.  Socio-political choices may come into effect as well.  Some people are aware of the practice of being compartmentalized into clothing based on gender, and so buck the norm to make a statement about that.  For example, the woman on the right may not be wearing a dress because she may believe that there's something wrong with the expectation that a woman is always in a dress at a wedding, and a man is always in a suit."

You can't take a lack of depreciation with you to the grave, but the good vibes from such a great feeling can contribute to your overall happiness.  Between a lower APR, overall longevity, and lack of unexpected costly repairs, the difference between a wisely-chosen new car and a used car is negligible.  Enjoy your purchase and take care of it!"

happy,35t2i5,velders01,8,Wed May 13 11:32:53 2015 UTC,"Especially in Korean study culture. The high school exam they take is extremely rigorous and has a major influence on the rest of their lives. So many Koreans know an incredible vocabulary and can rock English tests like nobody's business, but when it comes to actual conversation they're awful.   I'm a teacher back in the US too, but my goal here in Korean was to install that sense of fun in learning another language. If after middle school and high school, when the joy of learning is beaten out of them, at least one students looks back to his/her days in elementary and goes ""You know what? Teacher Dan's class was super fun despite him being a massive dork. Maybe I should check out English more"", I'll have considered my time here a success."

happy,35t2i5,thrashbat,2,Wed May 13 23:28:55 2015 UTC,"It's worth it, youngster.  Always worth it.  Teachers prepare us for the future, and sometimes results aren't seen for years.  If you have teaching in your heart, never leave it.  Every now and then, you just may help a child climb from a very deep hole.  You remind me of one of my favorite movies--To Sir With Love.  Check it out some time.  Different age.  But kids are kids.  And the ending may resonate with you."

happy,35t2i5,VenetiaMacGyver,7,Wed May 13 11:43:25 2015 UTC,"I have a friend there -- she left without ever having been, and without knowing hardly anything about the country. Planned on only staying for 6 months. Got cold feet 2 weeks in, wanted to leave, but something dissuaded her ...   It's been over 2 years now and she's trying to get dual citizenship. She loves it. Fucking loves it.  She was kind of lazy and self-centered before she left, but has changed SO MUCH (for the better). She's also traveled Asia and has made a gazillion friends. I'm pretty jealous of her!"
happy,35t2i5,VenetiaMacGyver,2,Wed May 13 15:03:17 2015 UTC,"Sounds good!   I kind of need a jump start like that, was she teaching English?"
happy,35t2i5,meepit,1 point,Wed May 13 20:43:07 2015 UTC,"Yep. I would've gone in a heartbeat except I never got a bachelor's and I wouldn't have wanted to leave my SO behind. If I were single with a bachelor's+, I'd already be there.  Just be careful of who you go with. Here's an article that will get you started in recruiter info, if you are interested: http://www.vergemagazine.com/work-abroad/articles/732-teach-abroad-choose-a-credible-recruiter.html  And remember: There're a lot of places other than South Korea where you can teach!   It's a beautiful, awesome country, but they are EXTREMELY focused on a full work schedule. They're even more religious about a 40+ hour work week than Americans are -- many S. Koreans frown on taking personal days, and will NOT tolerate lateness, for instance. But they can party down at night harder than anywhere you'll find in the US. (Again, this is all according to my friend there, so it could be totally just her experience.)  If you're looking for a more relaxed culture, for instance, try Spain or Italy (so I've heard; I could be wrong!). There are so many opportunities, as you can see, in part, here: https://www.tefl.com/job-seeker/map.html  Do your homework on what you want in a job abroad, and what those countries' recruiters offer. It's very exciting, is a great talking point for conversations and interviews, and looks killer on a resume when you come back home."
happy,35t2i5,meepit,2,Wed May 13 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"Haha, yeah, the party culture is crazy. There have been several nights where I have stayed out until 2am on a Wednesday night with my principal and staff (with classes on Thursday). Thankfully it's never forced upon you if you don't want to (you get a lot of free passes for being a foreigner).  As for the full work schedule, it really depends on the company/school. For Koreans, oh yeah, it's expected. For foreigners, not so much. I teach 25 hours worth of classes a week, which is slightly more than my peers. Unless you physically cannot bring yourself to school sick days are pretty unheard of (though there have been days when I just slept at my desk or in the nurses' office. That's common and acceptable). Public schools, at least, are generally low-stress for foreign teachers. Private schools are a whole other mixed bag."
happy,35t2i5,meepit,1 point,Wed May 13 23:38:50 2015 UTC,Yeah my friend's only worked for private schools. They expect her at work early and to leave late everyday unless she's on her deathbed. She broke her ankle on a Sunday night and got yelled at for calling out the next morning (and had to come in immediately!).   Her next school was slightly better ...... But only slightly.
happy,35t2i5,notjawn,2,Thu May 14 01:08:08 2015 UTC,"God, that's a loaded question. I'm feeling sentimental now, but I'd consider it somewhat life-changing.    I got to meet so many people from across the world and have cultivated so many friendships I hope to keep for a while. The country has its problems for sure (especially with the education system in middle and high school).  My school in particular has been amazing. It's an impoverished neighborhood, but my kids are really fun and always a riot. The staff is fantastic. Quality of life is great. Things are pretty cheap in general. Saved a ton of money, got to travel.   If you're looking into teaching in Korea, let me know. I went through the EPIK program. I would have liked to stay another year, but budget cuts are causing the program to be all but phased out in my city. Still, I feel very satisfied with my time here and am excited for the next stage of my life."
happy,35t2i5,PanFiluta,1 point,Wed May 13 23:34:56 2015 UTC,I would love to ask you a couple questions if you don't mind! I checked out the EPIK website and I couldn't seem to find anything about requirements of fluency in Korean. How much experience with the Korean language did you have prior to teaching there?
happy,35t2i5,tutter,2,Thu May 14 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"Sure, fire away!  And haha, I came over to Korea only knowing how to say ""hello"", ""yes"", and ""no"". Thankfully I've taken a couple classes in the two years since I've been here and can hold my own decently in a conversation, but in terms of EPIK looking for fluency, there isn't any information because there aren't any requirements!  Most of my foreign friends over here still barely speak Korean."
happy,35t2i5,05ekul,1 point,Thu May 14 03:46:51 2015 UTC,"Ok, great! I bet it took some adjusting at first, haha. Learning Korean is on my bucket list, but unfortunately no university's near me offer it so I can't take a class in an actual classroom. It seems like it would be incredible to get to learn a foreign language in a country where they actually speak it!  As for the actual teaching, are you provided lesson plans or do you create them on your own? I will be graduating with a Communications degree,  so I have little to no teaching experience. I imagine your experience with teaching in the US made it a little bit easier in Korea!  And finally, what is the one thing that you wish you had known before going?"
happy,35t2i5,EndiaBanana,2,Thu May 14 15:53:41 2015 UTC,"Lesson plans vary depending on where you're teaching. I'm a public school and have to plan everything myself (which I prefer). Www.waygook.org is a great jumping off resource where everyone pools their lesson plans to share (though the quality of the lessons can leave a lot to be desired). Some private schools (hagwons) give you all the materials and lesson plans, you're basically required to read off a script. It varies wildly.  The vast, vast majority of teachers over here have no teaching experience either. In fact, two of my friends have communications degrees as well.   What I wish I would have known? Not sure, honestly. It's an easy country to travel and get around. Cheap cost of living. I guess just go out and do as much as you can. It's easy to be a shut-in and not experience all the communities Korea has to offer, both expat-wise and Korean-wise. Additionally, it's super easy to get sucked into a work all week, drink all weekend cycle, which is bad for different reasons. Try your best to strike a balance."

The doctors I saw as a poor child completely missed my colorblindness and when I got older I was told that many of the rods and cones in my eyes are simply not their. I don;t know what the world looks like to the erst of you but I know that someday I want to find out and with glasses like this becoming more common and cheaper it's becoming realistic.   When I was a child these glasses cost $5000-8000 a pair and I just assumed I'd never be able to afford that, With them getting down to $250-500 it's becoming realistic and I cant even explain how excited that makes me.  I always assumed I saw what I saw and that is good enough. Then in college I started experimenting with psychedelics and SAW COLORS THAT I LITERALLY HAD NO IDEA EXISTED. This wasn't a deeper blue than I had ever seen or an especially vibrant crimson, these were colors I had no words for or frame of reference of. It changed everything and I've been keeping an eye on these types of glasses since. I still cant afford them at their current price point but someday I'll be able to and on that day a lifelong dream of mine will come true. Thank you enChroma, seriously."

""Strong Protan  Strong protans (“pro-tans”) have a severe form of red-green color blindness.  Strong protans generally do not get the “wow-effect” from the EnChroma Cx lens. Color vision may be improved slightly, but the effect is subtle and takes a significant amount of time to adapt to (anywhere from days to weeks). In some cases, there may be no noticeable effect at all–these types are called dichromats, where the individual has effectively no L-cone photopigments at all).  Based on feedback from people with similar results, we believe there is about a 30% chance that EnChroma glasses will help your color vision.  All EnChroma products are satisfaction-guaranteed within 30 days of purchase.""  With there only being a 30% chance of vision improvement due the the lack of cones I mentioned in the OP it seems like this might be a waste of money I'm not even sure I'm OK taking. Plus the glasses are $350, not the original $200 I though. Still, this offer was enough to make my finals week. Thanks TresGay."

However, the original point still stands: once you're an employee, performance matters more than negotiating skills. If you're not a hard worker who accomplishes meaningful results, your strong negotiating skills won't matter much. There are always examples that contradict this, but over the long haul most employees get what they deserve. Hard work > negotiating skills.   If your work experience says that the reverse is true, I would suggest that you look for better employers."

There might not be much room for individual wage hikes Two employees with same skill and different starting salary will get the same raise each year, not closing the gap (if percentage wise hikes, the one who started out better will actually pull ahead)    but over the long haul most employees get what they deserve.

All told, thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars worth of work for two thousand plus five hundred in gas and hotels. The dentist was great and it went extremely well.

happy,350akr,Italy321,5,Wed May 6 12:59:13 2015 UTC,"For me it was due to bad genetics ( Dad got his at same age, both grandparents had dentures as well) and extreme dentaphobia. It was a true metaphorical life lesson. I let my fears control me and it decayed me mentally and physically. I had quite a few cavities overdue, broken/chipped, and more after not  seeing a dentist in over 10 years so it was decided in the long run it would be a better option to extract and replace them all."
happy,350akr,jart,1 point,Wed May 6 13:56:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you for sharing your story. You must feel relieved now that it's all over and you won't have to fear the dentist ever again or worry about tooth pain. Ten years is quite a long time to be wracked with uncertainty and pain.  I guess I won out on the genetic tooth lottery. I once went eight years without going to the dentist, mostly because I was poor. My brushing habits also weren't exactly twice a day. And then when I finally did go, the dentist was astounded that I didn't have any cavities. So I got invisalign.  The same can't be said about my sister though. She's 23 and her teeth are very strange and brown looking. I'm not quite sure what's wrong with her. I wish I could help her, but the cost of veneers is just astounding. I think it's like a few thousand per tooth. So she might be in your camp soon."

Eastern Europe seems to offer the best value in terms of top quality aesthetic standards and India-level affordable cost (even factoring for travel and lodging,). There are some 'low cost cosmetic surgery' horror stories from places like India, Mexico (where aesthetic sensibilities aren't as rigorous) but I know Hungary, Serbia and Romania are huge in the EU for dental work and veneers are, seriously, like a couple hundred euros compared to thousands of dollars/pounds in the US or UK."

Getting away from the US and seeing the actual out-of-pocket costs in health care systems that were either totally socialized (where governments can negotiate price) or totally free market (where there wasn't a ton of regulatory BS) woke me up to what a ridiculous extortion racket the US health care system has become.   Serbia is way underrated. I'm probably moving to Portugal (suuuuuper cheap and way high quality of life... and warm) but strongly considering a couple places further east, too.   The right formula for tech seems to be live lean, work like a mofo when you get a gravy train in the Valley or NYC, make as much hay as you can, then bail and live a peaceful and content life doing what you love, maybe some consulting stuff on the side. I cashed out some very modest techbucks in the late 00's, used it to buy a small off the grid place that I'm converting to an organic farm. Forget the rat race. Life's too short.

I have no teeth on my right side past my canines back and only two teeth in my left side. My two front teeth are cracked and missing chunks so bad it looks like I have a big gap and the rest of the teeth I have are so painful I can't use them to do any meaningful chewing and have to cover them with my lips when I drink anything.  I've been saving up for dentures for a while now (should be able to get some by the end of the year)and I can't wait.  I miss smiling (and chewing) without being extremely conscious of it."

Record a video of yourself telling your story and showing your teeth that you can put on the page. And if you have a job, definitely mention that, because people are biased in that way and want to feel like they're donating to a normal respectable person.

happy,350akr,poppinwheelies,1 point,Thu May 7 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"I've never thought about that.  I know I saw a redditor do that once and he got his teeth fixed, I'm not sure if he got dentures or just some work done though.  I'm not sure how I'd feel about having people help me get new teeth when there are tons of other people who have life worse than just not having teeth, like my 7 year old who is wheelchair bound (not that he's living a rough life by any stretch of the imagination) .  I mean I've been wanting teeth so bad for so long it's very tempting.  I just wish it wasn't so insanely expensive even with insurance.  It makes me almost want to become a dentist just because I know exactly how much pain it causes and helpless people feel.  I used to smile all the time in high school and now I'm constantly keeping  my lips in check because it embarrassing, even though I know I shouldn't care it still makes me super self conscious.    Compared to other afflictions it may seem silly but it really takes a huge toll on you mentally and physically.  Besides the health problems caused by not having many teeth (my nasal passages are all shallow and jacked up because without teeth they don't stay where they need to be) and having to stop myself from smile wide enough to show my teeth because it grosses people out (or fear of being treated like you're a crackhead because a lot people don't understand your teeth can be bad without there being a crack/meth addiction involved), just daily stuff like eating dinner or drinking a cold glass of water can be incredibly difficult and painful task.  I think about my teeth constantly.   Agh, I'm rambling and I probably sound like I'm about to throw a pity party haha.

happy,34y3fa,threepwoodpirate,2,Wed May 6 02:03:00 2015 UTC,"Misattribution of arousal:       Misattribution of arousal is a term in psychology which describes the process whereby people make a mistake in assuming what is causing them to feel aroused. For example, when actually experiencing physiological responses related to fear, people mislabel those responses as romantic arousal. The reason physiological symptoms may be attributed to incorrect stimuli is because many stimuli have similar physiological symptoms such as increased blood pressure or shortness of breath.  One of the initial studies looking into this phenomenon conducted by Schachter and Singer (1962)  was based on the idea that the experience of arousal could be ambiguous and therefore misattributed to an incorrect stimulus. Operating under this assumption, the researchers developed the Two Factor Theory of Emotion. Misattribution of arousal, which is an influence on emotion processing, can be found in multiple situations, such as romantic situations and physiological responses from exercise.  An example of the possible effects of misattribution of arousal is perceiving a potential partner as more attractive because of a heightened state of physiological stress. A study by White et al. (1981)  investigated this phenomenon and found that those in an unrelated aroused state will rate an attractive confederate more highly than a rater without arousal. The researchers also found that aroused raters would dislike an unattractive confederate more than those without arousal.

I hope you've set up some ground rules of hiring people who know their shit and not taking work problems home with you. I wish you all the success in the world and mostly five star Yelp reviews!  Tips:    Pizza without cheese doesn't need to be cooked as long as pizza with cheese.  Have blue cheese salad dressing on hand for sides. Look into Celiac disease and gluten. If you offer gluten-free pizza be sure that every item your restaurant offers is or isn't gluten-free and train your employees to not contaminate with gluten via gluten-free only cutting boards, sauce, etc. Wearing gloves while making a gluten-free pizza is a good idea. Gluten can cause hospitalizations, it's not just a ""fad."" Garlic knots are amazing. The employees in the kitchen need to communicate. Use the rule of three to figure out prices. If something costs $4 to make charge at least $12. Pasta is a great menu item because of mark-up. Decide what you are good at and educate yourself so you can be better at it.  Always call references on resumes. Try and get into relationships with local businesses like hotels. See about getting involved in your city's Facebook and do a comment raffle.  Join your local Chamber of Commerce and network with the other business owners. Refrain from giving any personal opinions via social networking -- it will always bite you in the ass. If you have a personal Facebook make sure it's private.  Try your best at not having a microwave in your kitchen. Fresh ingredients will get you farther and if you do decide to forgo the microwave, spread the word.  This is just a personal thing but please use Coca-Cola not Pepsi lol!!!"

happy,34sfsb,Val-Endrada,9,Mon May 4 13:21:55 2015 UTC,"I worked at a Little Caesar's for one year in college.  I've heard just about every possible request on a pizza you could imagine.  No sauce or no cheese are both common.  Had a guy ask for a pizza half of each, once. One side no sauce, the other no cheese.  Had a sorority ask for 40 pizzas, and each pizza have a different letter in pepperoni on it to spell out their sorority name.  Had a Muslim guy come in and ask to wash our own pizza cutter for us before we made his pizza so he could ensure that it made no contact with any pork.  Don't run into many like that in Alabama.  The weirdest that I can think of off the top of my head, though, was the guy who wanted just the pizza crust with the garlic sauce spread on it.  We sold garlic breadsticks, and for a lot cheaper. But nope, he wanted it as a pizza, even after we told him the breadsticks and the pizza were made from the same dough."

happy,34sfsb,Picturerazzi,11,Mon May 4 19:20:20 2015 UTC,"The traditional Italian ""Napoletana"" and ""Romana"" pizzas are originally without cheese.

You can of course add mozzarella if you like, most people do, - but omitting it would only be authentically Italian, not ""blasphemy"" at all."
happy,34sfsb,eosha,2,Mon May 4 15:21:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% sure about Romana, but pizza napoletana is definitely made using mozzarella cheese in Italy, and has been since it was first made."
happy,34sfsb,Picturerazzi,2,Mon May 4 22:15:55 2015 UTC,"hmm..   The source of my information is an obscure old Italian cookbook, which is perhaps not exactly scientific. It does however seem feasible to me, that the humble (16th century) beginnings of pizza started out as simply being bread with tomato-topping. Some hold that it was Raffaele Esposito who introduced mozzarella as a pizza-topping in 1880, when he invented the Margherita pizza, while other sources claim that it was already an established practice before that (which is probably true).  In any case I think I'll probably need to look further into this. One thing I AM certain of though, is that I'll definitely be making pizza later. Thanks:)"

happy,34sfsb,succulentlysimple,3,Mon May 4 23:50:42 2015 UTC,"So exciting! Best of luck!   I've studied a lot on business ownership (this is a goal someday for me), and I have some friends who've started their own that have imparted a lot of wisdom about it.   Just figured I'd mention a few pieces of wisdom I've learned that a lot of new business owners don't think much about, but can totally break them (you might already know, but just trying to be helpful!):   Stay extremely modest in year 1 profit expectations -- unless you have a ton of starting capital and reserve cash, you guys should be either the sole round-the-clock employees, or have bare-minimal staff. If business is booming in the beginning, it's because of ""new-itis"" -- the people that show up during the first few months are not usually indicative of who your regulars are gonna be, so don't start going on a hiring frenzy until you're 100% sure you can earn the regular income to maintain them long-term. Don't be afraid to drop a couple hundred to a thousand on a decently-designed logo and marketing designs (look for freelancers and the internet for help with this; don't go overboard in your first quarter on it but don't trust your new brand to your weird cousin Tony who's had Photoshop for a year and no professional design experience). Having a modest site up can be done on the very cheap, or free, and that should tide you over in the beginning (since you're a small brick-and-mortar restaurant). Get referrals for good local printers from other area businesses, and make a deal with them for your printed materials. Professional-looking marketing designs will set you apart from competition right out of the gate, especially if you are near a college/area with a large young adult population, or are near an area with a lot of white collar offices or tech jobs. (It's less important if your demographic is largely older folks or middle-income/low-income families.) Think you have enough reserve cash? Think again! The bare minimum you should have, or work towards, will cover 6 months of near-zero customers. That's 6 months of salaries, insurance, rent/lease/mortgage, supplies, etc. (not to mention your own cost of living!). I say minimum because, what if you hit a few slow months, and a disaster happens? Or someone sues? Or you want to try to make a big advertising thing to get more business? You should be able to handle those emergencies PLUS still have reserve cash for other problems that might happen. Tons of small businesses fail because they worry about expanding before they worry about savings. Don't be resistant to change. Think you want your place to cater mostly to young adult white-collar workers? Well there's a chance that your main demographic will surprise you. Could be you get nothing but middle-aged families and teens. Could be that you ONLY get blue collar workers. That means you have to adapt your menu, look, marketing, etc., to cater to your market. Don't cling to a name or menu that earns you less profit just because you disagree with who your customers are. Tons of people start businesses with a lot of fun ideals for their perfect shop, are fed some unexpected reality, and refuse to adapt. They're like the dinosaurs. You don't adapt, you go extinct!   All that might be common knowledge to you already, but I had a bit of time to type and am excited for you. Hope it goes really well!"

Luckily, my realtor is AMAZING and got $5000 in closing help from the seller, so I didn't have to pay a thing in closing costs! I am very fortunate to have these awesome people in my life.  Also, I wouldn't have thought about buying a house now except for the fact that I plan on staying in this area for the next 30 years for my job (pensions are sweet yo!), plus the interest rate I was given was pretty low (and for me, it's cheaper than renting).

Havent always done that but I've been on caffeine since my teens.  Currently in my 30s.  I had a bad caffeine overdose a couple weeks ago and it scared me.  Decided it was time to get clean.  I dropped down to 1 cup of tea per day for a week and now I'm off entirely.    An unexpected side effect is my depression symptoms have been greatly reduced.  I had no clue!

I quit cold turkey and don't really miss it now. It was rough, but not being able to stand for hours and feeling nauseous is a good motivator to quit. Apparently, I drank too much and finally developed a allergy to it. Even a little bit messes me up for hours.  Keep it up. Even without an allergy, caffeine isn't good for you."

Six foot seven, 250lbs and also soft spoken, but my yells cause mountains to piss themselves.  We've had one fight in all our years, but it wasn't a yelling match, just a discussion of feelings.

Maybe it's because English is not my first language, and I don't fully get what you're trying to say. But the notion of someone ""allowing you to be free"" doesn't seem quite right to me. Like you need to be grateful that your husband isn't verbally or otherwise abusive towards you? And that somehow tall, bearded men in law enforcement would be prone to be that way? I hope it's just me reading your post the wrong way and that you feel that you really have the agency to rule over your own freedom and happiness, with our without the permission of someone else."

I never knew in my nearly 20 years on the internet that other people might actually be online, and that they (like fellow grocers, drivers, shoppers, church-goers, politicians, cops, friends, and family members) might have lustful, disgusting thoughts and desires for children (now including my own).   If you want to teach someone something, and you are not in fact an asshole, then think before you post. Perhaps a PM or some other form of delivery would be more appropriate.  But, alas, you are free to be as much a dick as you desire. That's a wonderful thing as far as I'm concerned."
happy,33meh8,energy4anarchy,-1,Fri Apr 24 02:43:03 2015 UTC,"Hey Man,  Look - thanks for your genuine reply.  I know the first line in my post came across as confronting - and I guess I did it to get your attention.  I'm a dad myself - 2 daughters - and yeah man, you're absolutely right and know what you're doing, plus, who the hell am I to tell you what you can/can't do.  But just be careful man. I've seen Reddit kind of move from a place of like-minded individuals just to a cesspit of rubbish.  I mean, hey, I'm here after all so I can't be too hypocritical.  But I guess I'm a bit sensative as check my other posts man. Some dude posted the other day the link/image and its just completly distatesful... and it pains me to think that somehow that kid has to be embarrassingly tied into the image on the right because some Reddit/4chan dude wanted to make a meme.  So yeah - best of luck in fatherhood man! Just watch out on this site."

happy,33meh8,thecoldwarmakesmehot,0,Fri Apr 24 02:55:15 2015 UTC,"All good man... and apologies for coming across as I did, it wasn't my intention.  In 5 minutes time, after you read this - I'm going to actually go and delete my comments (with that link I posted on another reply somewhere here) - again, because I don't want your daughers pic somehow being tied to that other one, even on the same thread as its posted.  But again man, as I said... all it takes is the hivemind of Reddit/4 Chan to slap a meme/phrase over your photo, or copy paste some nasty stuff next to, beside or on top off... and its you and your kids that wear it from there on in.  I have two kids under two myself and my wife and I have the thought that when my kids are ready, we'll monitor and let them post things themselves as they want to.  There are actually reports/studies out about how kids are going to grow up in the future with their complete birth to adolescent years plastered across the net... and how, subject to things like memes and so on - perhaps what it will do for confidence/esteem amongst other things!  I know its over the top man - but just something to consider! Best of luck for a long, loving life together man!"

happy,33ft4s,nukefudge,6,Wed Apr 22 12:31:47 2015 UTC,Well since it's my last year of high-school and it is the last dance of the year it's basically the last big event of the year! In my opinion it's important but I'm stress free now :)
happy,33ft4s,Adam_Warlock,5,Wed Apr 22 13:03:08 2015 UTC,"Prom is kind of a formal right of passage kind of thing. Most teenagers don't see it that way, but it's the last school dance. I personally felt more like it was a bunch of people trying to cling to childhood, so as an ambitious, independent, and pretentious young man it was really important that I didn't go. I instead symbolically started my career and went to the college I was going to and watched a play. I was going to be an actor at that point, so it meant more to me than a night with a bunch of people from high school I had really become apathetic for. Prom is kind of a formal party before everyone either goes off to college or goes out into the real world and you never hear from each other again. It really means different things to different people. Some folks know how to have fun with it, some folks take it too seriously, and then there's me who was ready to be done with it all. This kid knows how to have fun with it, and kudos to him for that."

happy,33ft4s,JayTS,3,Wed Apr 22 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"It's one of those things that has always been celebrated glamorously (fancy dresses, tuxedos, nice dinners, limousines), but seems to increase in perceived importance, probably due to the ever increasing numbers of high school movies continuing to show how ""important"" prom is.  Then kids hear their parents' stories, their older siblings' stories, and naturally want to match, if not one-up them.  I always saw it opposite from how /u/Adam_Warlock views proms and thought it was more like children trying to act like grown ups, rather than young adults clinging to childhood.  Lots of kids see it as an excuse to act wild, get drunk, and have a crazy afterparty, while others see it as the most important social event they will have other than their wedding.  It's been a recent phenomenon, though, to make asking someone to prom as elaborate as a marriage proposal.  I graduated from high school only ten years ago, and everybody got a date just by asking in the hallway or over the phone.  I had a graduating class of over 650 students and I don't recall anyone going as far as OP did to ask someone to prom, and his is more a funny gesture than an over-the-top romantic one."

Now given everything that you've said, I first want to say that I sympathize with you completely and I understand how you feel. I've been there, but I'll tell you what, the difference in how these things play out is how well you respect yourself. Every girl wants a man who will respect her and honor her, but in order for a woman to find that she looks for a man who respects and honors himself. I'm not saying you do or you don't do these things, but what I am saying is not matter how shit turns out or how it may seem to be going you continue to work on yourself in all different aspects such appearance, knowledge, trades, skills.. just add to your self-worth by making yourself who you want to be and in the end all that matters really is how happy you are single or not. So don't fret because of something as trivial love.. although love may be a powerful feeling, so is happiness and with love comes happiness BUT also brings sadness and  turmoil. You cannot love without being willing and able to withstand heartbreak... so ask yourself questions that you can honestly answer. Am I ready for love? Do I truly love myself? If I do can I then love someone else? Will I be able to handle them maybe not loving me as much as I love them? The answers and solutions to these questions lie with you, my friend. Good luck with your journey and here's hoping that we'll all end up happy in the end. Cheers."

He asks the customs guy, ""What's with the drums?!?"". The customs guy replies, cryptically, ""Drums play, good news. Drums stop, bad news"".  He gets in a taxi and heads to his hotel. The drums are still playing, so he figures he'll ask the taxi driver, ""So, what is it with the drums playing?"". The taxi driver replies the same, ""Drums play, good news. Drums stop, bad news.""  He checks into his hotel and heads to his room. All night, he can hear the drums playing, and it's driving him mad.  At breakfast the next morning, he's hearing the drums, still playing away in the background. All of a sudden they stop, and the restaurant goes quiet. Almost in a panic, he says to the nearest waiter, ""Why is everybody so quiet? What does this mean!!!"".  The waiter replies, ""FUCK! Now the bass solo begins."""

At MD Anderson (at least on this one floor), when you come out of the doctors office cancer free you ring a big bell with a rope on it. My dad had to go over there for lab work at 9am then he was going to get word from the doctor at 11am. So I said 9am was too early and wouldn't be able to make it. I drove hours to get there and arrive at 11:10am (bad traffic) and waited for him to come out and ring the bell so I could record it. I waited. 45 minutes later I ask the receptionist. They leave a message in the back for someone to check. I waited 2 hours. My dad wasn't answering his phone (hospitals are cement bunkers so I understood that). Then I started thinking the worst. But I had to drive back to work and it would take a few hours to get there so I left. Sad. My mom called me as I was getting in the car telling me that my dad just walked in the house. I missed him ringing the bell by maybe 10 minutes. It was the only time in history that the doctor was early.  My dad said he had to go back in a week and that he could ring the bell again then. I told him that wasn't ""REAL"" and he should just take a selfie.  Everyone else laughed. That was like 8 hours for me."

happy,3235vf,Local_Crew,3,Fri Apr 10 18:40:34 2015 UTC,"Congrats! It's a very beautiful ring, but for those of you wondering it is set to look like it's a much bigger stone that it is. It's hard to take a picture of diamonds and really show their beauty and elegance, especially with a simple camera phone.    This ring is set so that with a quick glance it looks to be 3 large stones. it's really a bunch of smaller stones centered around a slightly larger stone. The center stone in the center ring of diamonds appears to be no more than .25 the surrounding stones are probably between .1-.15 same with the outer rings of diamond. those centers are probably .15 with surrounding .1. The TCW is probably somewhere around 2.5 with a clarity range of I1-I3 and a color of H-I. This is a very smart way of getting a ring that looks a lot more expensive than it really is. Smaller stones are more forgiving with inclusions, meaning you wont see them as easily as you would with a larger stone. Smaller stones are also less expensive, by arranging the brighter color stones and less included stones in the center it will draw in the most attention and shine.   It's still very beautiful and this become a common trick in the diamond industry. From a quick glance,  a diamond snob will be able to tell very quickly but an average person will just see the 3 large stones as intended."

happy,3235vf,sunstorm77,-3,Fri Apr 10 12:42:25 2015 UTC,"Because the announcement of an engagement tends to focus on the stupid ring and not on the commitment two people have decided to make to each other. That tends to come later, after the initial novelty of the whole thing wears off. I'm not saying I condone such thinking, just that that's how it seems to me. When my ex and I got engaged I had absolutely no desire for a ring and told him that, but he refused to announce the engagement until there was a ring on my finger because he was afraid everyone else would think he was a cheapskate. So I picked out this $100 ring with an amethyst in it to appease him and then he freaked out because the ring only cost $100 and he was afraid of what people would think of that. When we picked wedding rings, I just happened to find exactly what I wanted to go with my amethyst ring for $50. We spent $400 on his wedding ring because that was the one he liked, but throughout the marriage, he kept suggesting that we replace my set because they didn't look enough like bridal rings. That shit drove me nuts. If I ever do it again, I don't want anything to do with rings."

happy,31oup3,charlotte095,6,Tue Apr 7 00:03:46 2015 UTC,I've been to classes for quitting they say the nicotine receptors in your brain only go to sleep. As little as one or two cigarettes can reawaken these receptors and they say you'll be buying packs shortly after that. The only real way to stay smoke free is to never give in to the 'one won't hurt mentality' even when drunk.  My aunt quit for 30 years. Her mother died and she smoked a few at the funeral and was buying cartons by week's end! Stay strong!

I take 150mg effexor once a day.   I originally took zoloft given to me by my GP before I found a psychiatrist however it stopped working for me and I had a major relapse which cost me my job. (good ridden that place sucked) eventually I found a great psychiatrist which I just had to stop seeing  due to insurance changes but I am basically on maintaining for the next few months until we draw down my medication and I am labeled cured.

Can I recommend you reading Israel Finkelstein and William G. Dever? Those books are invaluable regarding Biblical archaeology and provide good counterpoints against those who take the Bible at face value.  Oh, Finkelstein does a super-thorough analysis on Exodus and how archaeology relates to it.  So, if you love science and analyzing books as your teacher/pastor/whatever says, I'm pretty sure you'll love reading those. (Or if you want to go hardcore scholar, read Frank Moore Cross, he analyzes the influence of Canaanite mythology in the jewish faith)."
happy,30ybfw,laela_says,2,Wed Apr 1 14:32:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendations - I'll be sure to check them out.   I'll do you one as well.  I recommend Israel in Egypt by James Hoffmeier.  Has been extremely influential to me.  And, if YOU want to go hardcore scholar, I recommend On the Reliability of the Old Testament by K. A. Kitchen."
happy,30ybfw,silverwillbot,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:58:20 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes, Kitchen's book. I've heard about it a few times, and I've been curious to buy it but have postponed it for one or another reason. According to reviews, he debates Biblical minimalists.   There's a curious thing about minimalists is that they go to the extreme to argue that the Bible dates to Persian or Hellenistic times. William G. Dever (""What did the Biblical writers know and when did they know it?"") also rebukes them, exposing all their flaws and physical evidence like the Tel Dan stele which contains the famous ""House of David"" inscription.  I like Dever a lot. His approach is treating the Bible like an archaeological artifact, whose authors had agendas and biases. His approach is very balanced. His hypothesis is that the Israelites didn't experience an exodus, but were native Canaanites. He wrote another book about this (""Who were the Early Israelites and where did they come from?"").  Finkelstein, on the other hand, argues that the Deuteronomistic history was written not in post exilic times, but in the court of King Josiah, and describes the situation of the Near East in the 7th century BCE. His low chronology hypothesis is controversial, but can't be discarded without a clear dating of King Solomon's temple. His pointing out of the circular reasoning for early archaeologists' dating of artifacts is worth noting (i.e. we start assuming  that this artifact is solomonical because stratigraphy deals with relative dating and we have no reference frame; then another guy dates another artifact and compares it with ours, therefore claiming it's solomonical. So another one compares our finding and confirms that it dates to the date of the second artifact. Therefore, solomonical, ignoring it was circular reasoning. Q.E.D.)  Finkelstein points out various anachronisms in Genesis and Exodus, comparing the situations described there to the 7th century BCE instead of the 12th, supposed time of the Exodus. An example is the Egyptians looking for spies from Assyria. In the late Bronze Age there was no political conflict between Assyria and Egypt, but there was in the Iron Age. This and other situations are explained by Finkelstein to point to King Josiah's reign as the time when the Exodus was written (this also matches priest Hilkiah's discovery of the Book of the Law, which IMO was not a discovery but a very well crafted invention. The prophesies of a second David named Josiah all seem too convenient for him - they didn't count his sudden death by an Egyptian archer, but I digress).  So there you have a nice set of different viewpoints, all worth considering."

I've been struggling with this a lot too early on, and it wasn't until my last relationship when my ex was really into my looks and kept complimenting me when I really believed that hey I could be considered attractive. We're often our own worst enemies so we pick on ourselves and convince ourselves that we don't fit society's definition of pretty. I'm happy you are believing otherwise, you definitely should!"

I played around with it and got decently good at it and paying so much attention to my face helped me see the good features of it. I got to where I felt confident with makeup on and now I'm confident without any makeup at all. I think it's partially the feeling of 'I know I could look a certain way if I wanted to, but I'm choosing to look just like this'."

His father was a construction worker and they basically moved anywhere he could get work back in the 1950s.   My dad only slightly remembers it, as well as the drive back to Illinois on route 66 the year before he started school.  Ever since then, it has been a dream of his to go the whole route and make it to the ocean. He tried about 5 years ago but started having health issues in Arizona and had to turn back. Since then, his health had been getting worse including having a small stroke early last year.  Recently, my husband and I were moved from the east coast to the west, we had to take two vehicles and to make it easier, my mother in law and my father volunteered to help us drive.  Knowing my dad's dream and knowing that we were set to get to California on his birthday, we purposely planned to take a somewhat longer route and end up a few hours away from our destination initially so he could finally reach the end of Route 66 and did so on his 64th birthday.

I have a lot of stress in my life right now, as I'm trying to parent an adopted child with reactive attachment disorder. While she's at school, I often paint, and feel so much peace.   So glad you're finding similar benefits through coloring!"
happy,30dq9j,janeD73,13,Thu Mar 26 17:56:36 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to say: thank you for what you are doing. I've studied RAD in school and it can be devastating. I admire that you are making sure you are engaging in self-care as well as parenting a child in circumstances that would be a challenge for anyone.  I'm not sure if you would find this useful, but in my graduate studies I was introduced to this book: Building the Bonds of Attachment: Awakening Love in Deeply Troubled Children that specifically focused on RAD and is not only very informative, but is written in a style that makes it very easy to read as well. It oscillates between narrative story and treatment options and analysis and is an amazing gold mine of useful and practical information for both clinicians and parents. If you would like an additional resource, check out the reviews on the link above and see if you think it might be worthwhile in your situation.  But seriously, thank you for what you are doing. :)"
happy,30dq9j,vampire_kitty,5,Thu Mar 26 19:47:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for taking the time to comment here and to offer your support. I recently read that book, on the recommendation of a friend, and it was eerily similar to our situation. I'm wishing and hoping and trying to be more like the mom who ultimately adopts Katie, but there are days where I worry that I might wind up being more similar to some of her earlier foster parents. I thought before adopting that I had quite a bit of patience, but this experience has turned out to be even more challenging than I expected. And I suspect that self-care is a big piece of the puzzle for maintaining my own sanity."
happy,30dq9j,janeD73,2,Thu Mar 26 21:21:55 2015 UTC,"Never, ever underestimate the difference that self-care makes. If you don't take care of yourself and make sure your needs are met as best as you are able, you will not consistently have the strength and energy to be there for your daughter. Kind of like that whole airplane tutorial of securing your own oxygen mask before securing one for a child. It is so good that you are making a conscious effort to make sure your mind is in a good space.  Also, don't forget that no one is perfect. Some days will be better than others. Sometimes you can do everything perfectly according to all the textbooks and things will still go all to hell in a hand basket. That you've already read the book and are keeping the ideas in mind is more than most adoptive RAD children experience from their parents - major kudos to you. Unfortunately, it can take excruciating amounts of time for some of these issues to get resolved. In the meantime, don't forget your self-care techniques and experiment with additional methods that may help to bring relief along the way as well such as meditation, journaling, finding a support group, taking walks in the sun, cuddles with a significant other, a hot bubble bath, a massage, varying forms of artistic expression (which you've already experienced as relaxing) and more.  Your daughter is extremely lucky to have someone like you on her side in life. :)"
happy,30dq9j,vampire_kitty,2,Fri Mar 27 16:59:02 2015 UTC,Thank you. I'm trying and it's very hard. We're about to start with a new therapist that specializes in attachment and I'm really hoping it will help. I appreciate your support and words of wisdom!

I asked him once when I was going through a rough patch in life- how he kept such a good attitude and his answer was gratitude. He had a lot to deal with but he had people that loved him, a roof over his head, food to eat.

happy,2zwful,Magic_Cats,3,Thu Apr 2 22:16:39 2015 UTC,"I try to be overly accepting of basically everything on this sub but this I have to say something about.  I've seen other posts or links to ""Things to do or think that will definitely make you happy"" and they frustrate me for a number of reasons.   First of all, I am assuming there is a reasonable number of people who on this sub who maybe have a hard time with happiness. Maybe they have depression or some other mental illness. Maybe they're just going through a particularly hard time in their lives. Or maybe they don't have "" a job to go to and the money to pay those bills. And legs and arms that function to do your cleaning and laundry."" maybe they don't even ""make time to go on Facebook. or make time to go get a beer."" because they are spending all of their time working to feed themselves or their family or caring for someone who is sick or injured or any other reason why there are people out their who don't have time to meditate, let alone Facebook or go out for beer.  But second of all, general day to day happiness is such a subjective, philosophical idea. For many (most?) people it is achievable with the right lifestyle, like the one that you've described as working for you. I used to have it and I think I might be getting it back again. But the idea that if everyone would just follow your advice, your lifestyle that works for you, then they would be happy...that seems a little crazy to me. Everyone is different, everyone has different values and there is no list of things to do and think that will apply to everyone.   So when you're browsing /r/happy because you're feeling a little down or because you're feeling so depressed it's debilitating and you just want to hear about other peoples happiness to pick you up a bit and you find lists telling you that it's basically your own fault you're depressed and that if you'd just follow the advice in this list you'd be happy, it doesn't help. In fact when I was depressed most of the things on lists like that, including yours, I'd already tried. ""So what does that say about me?"" I would think, ""I follow the advice and I'm still miserable, what's wrong with me?""  Sorry to ramble, I just feel like people who post stuff like this maybe haven't thought of it from that perspective. I've been in places in my life where posts like this really fucked with my head and I don't think I was really capable of replying and pointing out why back then but I am now. So just in case there any other people reading this who feel the same way I felt but are too apathetic or sad or whatever to point it out to you, I felt I should. Maybe it's just me, in which case it really is a ramble isn't it? But maybe not."

This post doesn't apply to everyone's healing journey and others need different modalities to get them to that place of happiness.

happy,2ztpgl,AmantisAsoko,8,Sun Mar 22 01:51:15 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you.  I really like stories like this being people often get sucked into the negative aspects of social media/internet about bullying etc.  Seems to me, hundreds of people going out of their way to make someone's day a little better is something to embrace and encourage."
happy,2ztpgl,JerkyMcGee,7,Sun Mar 22 02:16:06 2015 UTC,I agree. It doesn't take much to make someone smile. And that hundreds of unknown people want to help someone do so is a great thing. It def helps counter balance all of the negative things we see in the news everyday.

happy,2zr5eb,StinkinFinger,13,Sun Mar 22 10:17:39 2015 UTC,"Pro-tips:  Be sure to change your air filter regularly.   Plants grow bigger than you think. Be patient and plant them far enough from the house and spaced appropriately. Also, some plants require less care than others. Always make sure the water drains away from the house.   Ensure all downspouts are directed away from the house. Clean your gutters at least once a year.   Be sure to clean your dryer vent. Dryer fire is the leading cause of house fires.   Learn to fix things immediately. Being handy will save you a great deal of money in the long run.   Painting is easy. Just be sure to let the roller do the work. Don't push and don't put too much on the roller.   If water isn't a problem where you live, install a sprinkler system. Your lawn will look a million times better.   Maid services are cheap and fantastic. Your house will be clean all the time and your paint jobs and carpet will last longer."

happy,2zr5eb,XCorneliusX,2,Sun Mar 22 10:19:31 2015 UTC,"Count on $40 per month or so for water/sewer.   I just though of a couple more. Make sure your insurance policy covers replacement cost, otherwise the insurance company will amortize everything you own down to nothing. I got robbed and because I had that everything was completely replaced. In most states that's the standard, but not all of them.  Another thing you need to do occasionally is drain your water heater.  Sediment builds up in the bottom and can cause corrosion. I learned this one the hard way when mine blew. Huge problem. I happened to be home and averted a catastrophe.   Which brings me to my last point. Get a Ridgid wet/dry shop vac from Home Depot now. When you have a water emergency you need it immediately, not after going to the store."

Chose on better reliability and less taxes [plus a possible supercharger upgrade in a year or two] over noisy fun, and RWD fun haha. The manual box was mandatory ;]   The long road trip idea sounds excellent. I think I'll do that! The break in period might not be completed before the summer though, supposedly it's after 1k miles and I'm still driving my old car since I'll be selling it and gotta show it to anyone interested.

The plan's already pretty advanced, and at least we've already decided it'll be RWD, a tubular frame, front engine, and definitely NOT a V8 engine.

I think I just do it regularly here because as you said it's a really great way to meet people in Europe, especially after a night of drinking. ""Does anyone have a cigarette?""

I'm working abroad in Honduras and I've mentioned it in many a thread. not sure if that's foolish to mention or not.   Making friends here has been incredibly brutal. People here don't really have friends. They get their need for socializing from their very large families. So, if you don't have a family. you're screwed. People who move here basically have to start a family. so, it's all or nothing. kind of rough for people here temporarily. I'm actually going home, and the rough social scene (or lack there of ) is partly the reason. The loneliness and ensuing depression is crushing sometimes.  I'm very happy for you that you're starting to meet receptive people. We travelers can't afford to be shy."

Fortunately the new role is independent of any particular department or location.
happy,2xz4f4,Onikaimu,3,Fri Mar 6 00:05:18 2015 UTC,"Sounds like the people in management below the CEO are not going to be particularly cooperative or welcoming. I'd call some of those recruiters back before I committed to consulting with your old company. You don't want to get stuck wasting your time and energy again, even if it is on the other end of the pay scale. They already have your blueprint, so don't let them try to guilt you, either.  Also consider that you can consult part-time, if you like, as long as it doesn't conflict with other employment."
happy,2xz4f4,Andiththekid,5,Thu Mar 5 06:38:36 2015 UTC,"I think the managers were afraid of me showing the failures withing the department, hence the lack of support. Great advice. Thanx.  I can't consult in a permanent position as it does conflict with some other work that I am doing. So I am looking at an external vendor contract.

I personally don't often give them money, but I help in other ways, food, conversation, etc.  It doesn't take much to be a human being, but this is key, we need one another. Sometimes it fails, I almost got into a fight with an old Yugoslavian guy on the train the other night  when he was to drunk to understand how to get off the train and get on the correct one, but it got me talking to the others watching as well and I harbor no ill feelings towards him, but still wished him luck after we got off.

Even taking personal bias out of it(I just don't like that name), just in every day life having a unique name makes life a little harder. you could have to deal with teasing from other kids growing up, or later in life it would be difficult for making friends and networking. Everyone remember's John or Michelle. me personally, I'm bad with names, and if I can't easily remember yours, there's a good chance you wont ever hear from me again or I'll actively avoid talking to you because I'm embarrassed about not remembering your name. I know ronnie, mike, amy, and jason and kelly down at my parents bar. I've met dozens of people tons of times, and I never talk to any of them because I feel bad for not remembering. and you can bet if I'm that way, then others are like that too, some of whom are actually important to be involved with.

happy,2ww8nf,PerpetuallySingle,15,Mon Feb 23 19:25:51 2015 UTC,"What's funny is that I really shouldn't have gotten either one of them. The vending machine at my school has that spiral holding mechanism, and when I pressed the buttons for skittles the first one didn't drop. It was stuck against the glass and held up by the spiral and I'm just like ""Are you kidding me..."" But it turns out that this type of vending machine detects whether something dropped or not, and since nothing dropped the spiral started moving again, resulting in both the first and second one falling down."

Still don't know why it was there, but after youth meetings I'd go back there, grab a little plastic cup, and use the nozzle to fill myself a cup of coke.

Nothing happened. So he pushed the coin return button and instead of his money coming out, 4 Cokes fell out. And then it returned his money. So he left with 4 sodas and didn't spend any money. He won the vending machine lottery."

If you demand refunds when you get ripped off, then you should also demand to return the product if it's given to you by mistake.  This is the code I live by.

A thought I've been having is that I need a job and a place of my own asap but that won't happen for a while, maybe at the end of this year. Whenever that's happening, I want to move in with my/my sister's dog and she (the dog) is a cutie, loyal and good, so I can't wait. I love my dog, who 30 minutes ago was having nightmares. Cute.  There's also this girl, I met her through a video game and we've been gaming for over a month. I've never met her and we live 290 miles apart from eachother, but you know the feeling when you meet someone outside of your own circle of people, and you get along? I've always been having problems meeting people, let alone girls. But I also feel she's not simply a girl I'd want to date, I feel like she can be a lifelong friend, and I've always been having problems meeting people, so gaining a friend makes me happy.  So yeah, life's boring, has the same problems it had last year, but I have goals. I needed goals.  And since I made you read such a long post and I teased about the dog I see only fitting that I put this here. I wish I was able to take a better pic of her but she's being lazy and wants to curl up in a ball."

happy,2wonym,milojoker,21,Sun Feb 22 05:39:38 2015 UTC,While this is /r/happy there are still social rules on Reddit. Posting a ton in a smaller sub is seen in a negative light even with it being this sub.  People don't want to come here and see a ton of posts of the same person as there is already not a lot of content here.    With that said I do agree with you. We should be more positive about it but I would be lying if I said it didn't bother me a little.

happy,2wgmqy,Arsenault185,14,Thu Feb 19 21:30:43 2015 UTC,"Let's say the manufacturer decides to make 20 of these. All of 20 are sold. Now, the 21st guy who comes late to the game wants a toy. What's he gonna do? Or the next ten guys after him? All the toys are already sold!  Thankfully, someone else has got a spare one he's willing to sell. Or maybe he's just bored of the toy and wants something else. So he lists it on eBay or one of the inflatable collecting forums. He sets the starting price at $500 maybe, or whatever he originally paid for it.  Some guys had their toy but weren't as lucky; maybe they popped, maybe they were destroyed in fire or otherwise damaged. So they want another one. Now there's ten or more guys competiting for the single item available on Earth and the price will skyrocket to lower four figures. The most I've seen someone to pay for a toy was about $3,300.   Same goes for smaller commodity toys. What was manufactured tens of thousands of units and cost you $9 at Wal-Mart will now cost you $30-50 plus shipping, maybe $200 if it's super rare."

So my initial investment was $150 @ minimum wage (my whole paycheck) to new resume and subsequently three new positions in two years, up to 40k/year. I'm happy.

happy,2wayn5,agent-99,9,Wed Feb 18 18:52:06 2015 UTC,"Why would you doubt that? I know reddit loves the broke college kid living at home stereotype, but it's really not a stretch considering she never mentioned that her business was successful (which is completely subjective in the first place), and owning a house in many parts of the US is cheaper than renting an apartment or house of equal size. It could be in a bad area with a mortgage of $350/month.   That being said, congrats OP, keep that momentum up!"
happy,2wayn5,agent-99,8,Wed Feb 18 19:28:24 2015 UTC,"Because it's just not very practical. How many people do you know that went from a minimum wage job or near to it to owning a house within a year? Take that back even, how many semi-recent college graduates do you know that even have good enough credit to get any kind of a loan for a house? It just doesn't happen, I'm not saying ever, but it's definitely not normal by any metric.   Whether owning a house is cheaper or not, I'm not arguing (why wouldn't it be cheaper though? I doubt people rent properties at a loss after all), there's more upfront cost which is not feasible for young people to pay. We just can't afford it without building up saving and/or credit which takes many years in the professional world.   Likewise it takes money to start a business, even a low overheard door to door business. Hell, most young people can't even afford the custom tshirts and hat that she had, much less everything required to get your business off the ground.   That being said, congrats OP, keep that momentum up!   Agreed. I'm not trying to knock her down in any way here, just trying to paint a likely realistic picture of the situation."

happy,2wayn5,ivandrago0,2,Thu Feb 19 21:55:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and that's exactly it. I wasn't trying to put anyone down, whether it takes 2 months or 20 years accomplishing what she did is great. The guy asked how someone could do that in such a short time though, pressumably a young person starting off without much, and I gave what I felt was likely the most accurate answer. There's no shame in getting help, we all get help, I do feel there should maybe be some in pretending you didn't recieve any or being arrogant in some way, but she wasn't doing that here either."

happy,2wayn5,MrOwnageQc,4,Thu Feb 19 05:48:15 2015 UTC,"Not to get personal, but were you prescribed any medication? Kinda in the same boat...."
happy,2wayn5,LCPhotowerx,7,Wed Feb 18 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP, but meds help. After all, depression and anxiety is a chemical imbalance and the meds just help to normalize things.   I do believe that while meds can be part of the solution, counselling often gives you the 'tools' so to speak for dealing with day-to-day adversity which tends to drag you down. Some people take blood pressure pills to regulate that, others need meds for depression. It's as simple as that."
happy,2wayn5,bsukenyan,3,Wed Feb 18 16:49:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I am not prescribed anything because I found councelling very healing, however I can understand that sometimes depression is biologically or chemically related."
happy,2wayn5,Purpledrelib,2,Wed Feb 18 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but from my experience--combo of counseling and meds worked for me.  Stopped therapy when I moved, then about 6 months later went off meds.  I was fine at that point.    Recently (about 2 years later) started having some trouble again; went back on medication (different one), and already I'm seeing improvement.  If I hadn't sought help so quickly after it started, I would probably need both again.  I just recognized the feeling and went for help before it could get bad enough that I wouldn't be willing to do so.  (Had to practically be dragged to psych the first time around.  It wasn't pretty.)  It varies from person to person.  If ""just"" counseling works for you, that's excellent.  If not, there's no shame in it.  Talk to your doctor about options.  If you just need someone to talk to, feel free to PM."

I just want to encourage you to continue to look for ways of loving yourself for who you are, even without her there. It will not only make you happier in general but it will also make you better in your already great relationship. Congrats!"
