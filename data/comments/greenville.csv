greenville,3e0ghr,lordnecro,2,Tue Jul 21 02:08:03 2015 UTC,"Check out Asada on Wade Hampton for really good mission-style tacos, burritos, etc. (get the carnitas taco - it's amazing).   If you want to try SC BBQ, check out Henry's (also on Wade Hampton - get the BBQ sandwich plate with spicy BBQ sauce and absolutely get the sweet potato casserole as a side).   If you're in the mood for a really good burger and cheap beer, the Blockhouse is great - on Augusta St. not too far from downtown.  If you want some Southern food, go to Southern Culture, OR if you want real Southern food, go to a meat-and-three like O.J.'s (Pendleton St.) or Gus's (White Horse & Anderson Rd.). Prepare your arteries.  For dessert, eat any kind of cake (or all of them) at Brick St. Cafe on Augusta St. Ho-lee shit, are their cakes good. My favorite is the sweet potato cake (it doesn't really taste like a sweet potato - just moist, fluffy, rich, cakey goodness with cream cheese icing).  Or if you want ice cream, go to Spill the Beans downtown. I love their Mexican Spiced Hot Chocolate, and all of their ice creams.  I'm a native, and I think most of the restaurants downtown are overrated and overpriced. Yes, downtown is pretty, and you should definitely visit Falls Park, but I can only think of a handful of restaurants downtown that are good anymore. They don't have to try because we have so many tourists and people downtown that they're in no danger of losing business.  Stop by Michelin on Main and ask for Nick - he'll tell you some good places to go (corner of Main & Camperdown, right across from Falls Park).  Edit: Oh damn, how could I forget about Pita House?? On Pleasantburg, best Middle Eastern food I've ever had. Get the Middle East plate with gyro (gyro meat, falafel, hummus, tahini salad, and pita bread so you can build your own if you want). If you're really hungry or going with a group, get the stuffed grape leaves or stuffed squash. But take cash or your checkbook - they don't accept cards. Also get some baklava.   Also, Tanner's Big Orange is a true piece of Greenville history (70+ years old) - get the pimento burger and a medium Gold (punch). Don't bother with the fries. You'll be on your back after the burger.  Double edit: Let me know if you want a food tour of the best places in Greenville. I'm making myself hungry talking about all of this delicious food!"

greenville,3dmljh,kissthering,2,Fri Jul 17 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"I went to the pre-opening party and once or twice since. Cool atmosphere, standard beer/food offering. It's a lot smaller than it seems due to the mirror on the back wall. Fun if you have a big group. Games are expensive as you want them to be. You can probably play all of them once for less than $20. YMMV  Just go with some friends and check it out."
greenville,3dmljh,WolfInAMonkeySuit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:49:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all of the feedback, I'll check it out!  I couldn't find a beer list for the local one, but I guess I can always pop in The Yard House on the way in."
greenville,3dmljh,HLewis24_7News,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:10:24 2015 UTC,"Food and beer was pricey, games were surprisingly reasonable.   Its a good time."
greenville,3dmljh,jupham,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"What kind of games are there? Is it the standard Frankie's Fun Park affair with dozens of light gun games, racing games and ticket games?"
greenville,3dmljh,cincydash,3,Fri Jul 17 19:25:07 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, little bit of everything for everyone. Lots of kids, as can be expected. I felt it was maybe a step up from Frankie's but not way ahead."
greenville,3dmljh,crackofdawn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"It's so bad compared to back in the 90s.  I went in expecting awesomeness and what I found was basically iPhone arcade games and tons of ticket games, nothing actually fun to play."
greenville,3dmljh,gigimck,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:30:52 2015 UTC,We love it! It's not as expensive as Frankies and my kids always come out with a nice toy. :) Of course that nice toy cost me $50 but not bad between 3 kids. No go-carts or anything like that. Stay away from the Wizard of Oz game. I may or may not have dropped $20 playing it ;-)
greenville,3dmljh,Brobi_WanKenobi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:44:22 2015 UTC,"I've not been to the one here in Greenville but I imagine they're all pretty much consistent. Great place to play games, decent food, pretty good beer, but fucking expensive. For the whole experience expect to spend something like 50 bucks."
greenville,3dmi4b,Beanz122,5,Fri Jul 17 13:56:21 2015 UTC,"Depends on where in Asheville/Greenville you're talking about. My company has an office in Fletcher that I drive to from east Greenville every once in a while, probably takes me 50 minutes. To actually get into the heart of Asheville I would say leave yourself no less than an hour and a half."
greenville,3dmi4b,Brobi_WanKenobi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:42:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it wouldn't be worth it for anything farther apart than Fletcher/Skyland and the near side of Greenville"
greenville,3dmi4b,1stonepwn,3,Tue Jul 21 12:41:04 2015 UTC,"My ex did that commute for over a year (Laurens Rd area of Greenville to Fletcher, actually, so right about an hour) and while it was okay at first, it got old in the end, I think. Pretty sure he's moving to Asheville soon because of that."
greenville,3dmi4b,aGeekSaga,6,Fri Jul 17 14:18:19 2015 UTC,Just drove from DT Greenville to DT Asheville this morning. Expect at least a 90 minute commute with construction and speed traps.
greenville,3dmi4b,Gooberkk,2,Fri Jul 17 13:57:52 2015 UTC,"Ouch, that's rough. I love both cities but it looks like I'll have to make a choice of one over another if it comes down to it. Like, I'm sure I could afford it, but I don't know if I want to sacrifice 3 hours of my day like that"
greenville,3dmi4b,jawa-pawnshop,5,Fri Jul 17 14:05:01 2015 UTC,As far as job markets go Greenville is the better choice.  Lots of people want to live in Asheville because it's a great community and can't earn a decent living.  I lived in Asheville for a while and now reside down in Greenville.  Plenty of people with masters degrees waiting tables in Asheville.  Service industry is about the only strong job market there.
greenville,3dmi4b,jawa-pawnshop,2,Fri Jul 17 17:01:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I noticed my field isn't quite as strong there but I've found a couple positions that I'm going to apply for. May as well! Thanks for the advice though!
greenville,3dmi4b,aGeekSaga,4,Fri Jul 17 17:12:28 2015 UTC,"A good option you may want to consider is if you plan to try to be actively in between both cities is to split the difference.  Hendersonville, East flat rock and North Greenville all have reasonable cost of living and are situated between the two cites nicely."
greenville,3dmi4b,WolfInAMonkeySuit,2,Fri Jul 17 17:28:17 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought of that! I'll definitely consider it. Thanks!
greenville,3dmi4b,WolfInAMonkeySuit,3,Fri Jul 17 17:33:31 2015 UTC,I'd say don't. Honestly Greenville and Asheville are so close that if you have friends in one or the other you can always just spend weekends switching back and forth.
greenville,3dmi4b,musictechgeek,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:18:48 2015 UTC,"Why would you take a job in one and move to the other? I'm just curious as to what circumstances would lead to someone doing that voluntarily. Or am I missing something?  It's short enough to make a weekend/day trip out of it, but I wouldn't voluntarily commute more than 15 mins one way for a job, unless I was earning money while driving (taking biz calls or otherwise being on the clock). Life's too short for that nonsense. 3 hours is 12.5% of your day, 18.75% of your usable day (assuming 8 hours of sleep). Not to mention the cost of gas and wear/tear on vehicle."
greenville,3dmi4b,rmkensington,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:25:21 2015 UTC,I was just thinking of the hypothetical situation of where I'd want to live in one city but my job exists in the other. It probably won't happen but you never know. I'm still months away from making any sort of decision on this
greenville,3dmz30,Bootlessred88,2,Fri Jul 17 16:11:59 2015 UTC,Looks like you just finished navy basic. Don't get a dog. You're going to get shipped off. Not good for the animal.

One is 3 and 7. Just wait. It sounds harsh, but you're just starting life. Wait 2 years. You'll probably meet someone, settle, even if it's not your wife, it's a better situation for a dog."
greenville,3dpgdd,Deutschenhund,17,Sat Jul 18 04:38:09 2015 UTC,That place is the worst.
greenville,3dpgdd,kilbus,2,Sat Jul 18 12:07:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. Everything on the menu tastes the same. Which is terrible.
greenville,3dpgdd,Early_Cuyler,4,Sat Jul 18 13:26:14 2015 UTC,"And the owner creeps me out. He's in his 40's or early 50's but dresses and acts like a 20 year old. At his former second restaurant, he and the employees would also take breaks to smoke/ talk on the phone/ etc. in the front of the restaurant, which always seemed unprofessional to me."
greenville,3dpgdd,Gay_in_gville,4,Sat Jul 18 13:38:08 2015 UTC,This restaurant is all around crappy. Food quality is blah at best. Service is goofy. Atmosphere is contrived. There are at least a half dozen Thai restaurants in Greenville that are worlds away better than this one.
greenville,3dpgdd,kilbus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:20:05 2015 UTC,I agree.  I always got the impression that he didn't treat the employees too well either.

She then proceeded to flash the bartender (who was an older woman) once or twice.  I laughed and had a free shot of fireball.  added:  They also used to have a grill and on a certain night of the week you could bring your own meat and grill.

greenville,3d3hmu,Evaunit01berser,3,Mon Jul 13 10:58:46 2015 UTC,"Asked this a few months back, received this bit of legal jargon:  ""Greenville SC Municipal Code Sec. 18-69. Open burning. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person to start, or cause to be started, an open fire to burn any woodlands, brush, grass, leaves or other woodland debris, except as follows: (1) The city may issue a burning permit, at its discretion, for the burning of trees, brush and undergrowth on lands within the city limits where such land has been cleared for development. (2) The applicant will pay a permit fee as determined in a resolution by the mayor and council. (3) The applicant shall give the city, in writing, all information required by the city. This information shall include but is not limited to proof of liability insurance, the location of the burn, times and dates of the proposed burn, and a site plan of the property establishing the size of the burn area, public roads, property lines, and proximity of surrounding structures. (4) The applicant shall conduct the burn at such location described and under such administrative guidelines as set down by the fire permit. Failure to comply will result in revoking of the burn permit. Any person who willfully violates the provisions of this section shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the municipal court for each offense. (5) No burning permit shall be issued and no burning shall be carried out during any period in which the governor or other authorized official has declared that an emergency exists in connection with open burning. (b) This section shall not prohibit cooking fires built in fireplaces, grills or barbecue pits which shall be kept under competent and continuous supervision. (c) This section shall not prohibit the issuing of permits for bonfires as part of special events under such terms and conditions as provided by the city and the adopted fire code. (Ord. No. 2001-40, § 17, 6-11-01)""  That said, I went ahead and built a pretty sizeable fire pit, have had many a night out there with a good blaze going and have never heard a thing from any law enforcement, even when they constantly use my street downtown as a cut through.  I'd say keep it manageable, have the hose nearby to show our friendly LEOs that you're being responsible should they stop, and have decent neighbors that aren't going to call the cops because they hate you or something."

greenville,3d3hmu,Yellow_Skittles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:35:45 2015 UTC,It has to be a contained fire. Yes they will give you a ticket for burning anything larger than a fire pit or for burning outside if a fire pit/place. Inside city limits.

I come from a town that's 40% Hispanic. Yes, there was racism. Yes, there were racist policies and laws.  But it didn't feel like the norm for most people. Maybe ""everyday racism"" would be a better way to describe what I'm talking about. When I first moved here I was shocked at how many times people would say racist things to me even though they just met me, or while in a professional setting.

Ive seen those bumper stickers but never really thought people wanted us ""Yankees"" to go home.    If so, that's pretty ridiculous.  My company moved from the north, like many others, because of tax and other benefits, bringing thousands of jobs to the area, and that's nothing compared to BMW, Michelin, ZF, etc.  Should Ze Germans and the French go home too?   And yeah, it's hotter than humid hell down here, but the benefits to living here far outweigh the heat.  My only real honest complaint is the flat out horrible driving."

greenville,3d06qy,jiggle-o,5,Wed Jul 15 18:56:05 2015 UTC,"IMHO and from my international travels across EU, Africa, Oceania, Northerners (particularly from the 95 corridor and Ohio) are some of the most ignorant people in the world (yes, I am from there). I've heard statements than anything outside of DC to Boston on I-95, Denver, California and Seattle may as well be a third world country, from multiple high income people.   Europeans typically appreciate and adapt to a culture. Northerners come down and bitch about everything that isn't like it was at home or why Ohio or ""The City"" are the greatest places on earth. If they are so great, why are you here in Greenville?   Thats why people down here hate northerners and not germans, french, the brits or the hispanics. Just as the average northerner thinks prejudicially that every southerner with an accent is simple and racist, they also come down and impose their culture on them."

greenville,3d06qy,suvanna,3,Sat Jul 18 14:26:43 2015 UTC,"From up north originally.  Likes: -Love the politics to an extent. I'm heavy libertarian, very pure minded. I don't care for big government. I hate the Sanders circle jerk. -Love the mountains, and the outdoor around it. -Love the downtown vibe, love the design of it. -Love the people across the entire southeast because I travel it each week, from the Ozarks to Appalachia, from the Bayou to OBX, Southerners carry a wonderful warm feeling for the most part. -Love the worship of SEC football. Growing up an Eagles fan, I can appreciate being diehard for your team....excessively diehard. -Food is great.  Dislikes about the South: -Sweet tea is good for about 1/4 of a glass. overrated diabeetus drink. -Meth. Its a serious problem that isn't talked about enough. -Poor folks. especially black poor folks though. Education is important. So is dental hygiene. (I feel like this is going to get crucified, but it seems the poorer black folks seem to disproportionately neglect their teeth. Its really gross. rotten teeth are bad and hard to look at. I'll buy you tooth paste, just please brush!) -Smoking and tobacco use past college aged. Its bad. YOUR kids are watching you. -Drunk driving. This is awful. I've seen folks driving around with beer in hands in North Main and Stone Ave, and it seems to be the thing to do in Columbia and the entire state of Mississippi and Alabama after 5pm. -Snow/Ice. Just because you have a 4 wheel drive car, when there is a sheet of ice on I-85 doesnt mean you can go 55mph. That works in Mud and sometimes snow. Not ice/sleet.  Dislikes about Greenville: -Some of the above apply. -the church folks with megaphones at town events like Fall for Greenville. No one is joining your cult today (because their recruitment methods are cult like). -I hate the newbies in town that hit on diversity. Its pretty fucking diverse. lots of hispanics, blacks, white muricans, and legit europeans (seriously I have british and german neighbors) all over town with an increasing indian and east asian populations. Quit your bullshit. -better local music. -Better restaurants downtown. The mexican places, yap, redfin, are all owned by the same group and they all are terrible. Fords is awful. Liberties just got better recently re-doing the menu in the last 6 months. I wish there were more options and a burrito place downtown. Not full on Mexican food, just a burrito place. -A GOOD Irish pub downtown. Connollys is terrible, the new place Kilpatrick's/POUR/Comedy zone does too much and is awful. -more shops open past 2am or 10pm during the week. -driving. Driving on Main or woodruff and increasingly haywood might make me need a script for xanax. Also 85 between Anderson and Lawrenceville, GA. I went 10 miles in an hour today because of what looked like a fender bender. -Private schools. I wish they were better. Wife and I may move when we have kids for that reason. -Too much church in a lot of people's lives. I went to catholic school, though college, but it seems people here have a harder time separating church from your daily lives. (My mississippi sales rep call me a heathen for being agnostic :). I love it.) -Teen pregnancy. Boys need to start using some condoms. Damn! Kids are for life kids. Plan it out!  Probably a few more. I do love it here though. I do not hardly complain about the town, but I saw an opportunity for my 2 cents. Every place has issues. Greenville is more my style than anywhere else and I love calling it home."
greenville,3d06qy,debuskjt,3,Mon Jul 13 03:16:28 2015 UTC,This is quite thorough. I enjoyed reading it.
greenville,3d06qy,joe9439,3,Mon Jul 13 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"You literally named the worst restaurants downtown. There are dozens and dozens of good places to eat here. If you want good Mexican food, go to Asada. And why would you drive down Main St.? That's what cross streets are for... you can get around downtown fairly easily any time of day unless there's a huge event because actually going down Main St. isn't necessary. IMO they should start shutting Main St. down on Friday / Saturday nights except for the cross streets to give pedestrians room to breathe."
greenville,3d06qy,Sterling__Archer_,3,Mon Jul 13 20:51:47 2015 UTC,"I live on Main street in North Main. I rarely drive on it, but sometimes you just do by accident or you're picking someone up somewhere and they're on main street. It sucks. I also agree that they should shut down more than NOMA Square/Farmer's market on Fridays and Saturdays. They should shut down to Greenville News building Friday and Saturday."
greenville,3d06qy,Guayota,3,Mon Jul 13 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"I think that would be great. Definitely from NOMA to Greenville News would make sense. And invite live bands and the food trucks in at some of the corners at night. But the restaurants wouldn't like it, I'm sure. But if you're picking someone up anywhere along Main Street between Beattie and River I'd be telling them to meet me at a side street. I typically take Church or Academy to get near where I want to go and then shoot in from there. The cruising along Main St. on weekend nights is stupid."

greenville,3d06qy,joe9439,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:10:03 2015 UTC,"I want to say the driving, but I'd also imagine most places are full of their crappy drivers too.  Parking in downtown is always a mess, and 50/50 chance you're gonna end up paying if you really want to hang out downtown. I'm mostly a homebody though, so I'm glad my hobbies are mostly indoorsy stuff.  Traffic on 85 or Woodruff road is usually pretty bad, so I dislike having to schedule a certain time to go to places on weekdays.  Other than those complaints, I quite like it here. I used to be a Spartanburg native, and Greenville is more of a city than small town Sparkle City."
greenville,3d06qy,shaw2885,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:36:53 2015 UTC,"outside of downtown it's pretty much entirely suburban sprawl. not pedestrian or bike-friendly, residential areas are cut off from commercial areas. big chain stores with big parking lots. unless you live downtown or off Augusta, there's no walking down the block for a cup of coffee or into your neighborhood bar. sort of an adjustment from living in a bigger city. but I think it's moving towards more of a city feel so I'll be interested to see what happens in the next 10 years."
greenville,3d06qy,debuskjt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:22:12 2015 UTC,I don't see the suburbs really getting better any time soon.

greenville,3d06qy,joe9439,7,Sun Jul 12 17:00:20 2015 UTC,"Is that comparable? Their Altima isn't ruining the environment while doubling as a silly veiled display of fragile masculinity.  That comment really ruffled your feathers, didn't it?"
greenville,3d06qy,debuskjt,-9,Sun Jul 12 18:40:01 2015 UTC,Uh what? Adding a lift to a truck (or any car) does nothing to change its emissions output?  Apparently you need to go read up on cars and how they work..  And yes it is comparable.. people were bitching about their looks. Not their function. Plus.. their emissions differences aren't too far off..   edit: apparently y'all don't know a single thing about cars?
greenville,3d06qy,FURyannnn,-2,Sun Jul 12 18:52:17 2015 UTC,"This. A lot of lifted trucks are in good shape. Not my personal preference, but some look good."
greenville,3d06qy,joe9439,-1,Sun Jul 12 17:18:50 2015 UTC,"I hate that Greenville won't build a building above like 5 stories in height. Lets make a really nice downtown that NOBODY can live in because we want to keep that ""small town feel"" or whatever. Just build a darn residential condo building with more than 10 units in it. It'll be fine I promise! Don't be scared of people. Everything is 30 minutes away because it's so spread out. I want a condo on top of a Wal-Mart in the middle of downtown and I want the condo building to be 50 stories so that it's no so exclusive that it costs a million dollars to live there.  The approach to growth seems to be stomp it out rather than manage it in a normal way. I'm pretty libertarian and I don't think that big buildings and big government have to go hand in hand. We really can have the best of both worlds if we try.  I also don't like the taxes in South Carolina. They're too high and only make sense if you're poor. Texas has no income tax. SC taxes you 7% if you make more than the pitiful $13K limit. Come on guys. Lets get rid of the income tax so that we attract people with money. Freaking communist California has lower income taxes than SC does at some level of income. Like WTF?  Corporate tax is also too high. I'm not paying 5.5%. I'm in the process of moving my company from SC to NV. Have fun collecting no taxes either way. At least if the tax rate were lower there would be more jobs. I might open a office in Greenville rather than China.  Property taxes apparently have a floor of like $1.5K per year. I was looking at buying some investment properties downtown to fix up. It's like $1.5K in property taxes per year for a house worth $20K. It's also $1.5K in property taxes for a house worth $150K. How does that make any sense? Yes, lets punish people with 5% yearly property tax rates on cheap housing that could be fixed up and sold as something nicer. Poor areas stay poor and rich areas rich because the property tax rates don't make any kind of sense."
greenville,3d06qy,debuskjt,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:15:47 2015 UTC,"The point of limiting building height right now is to control and increase property values by limiting residents and limiting overhaul of infrastructure to support it, like electricity, telecom, and sewage. This way Greenville City can continue to attract high income, under 45 professionals, and low income can be a county problem.  Just what I see.  Also agree with you on taxes."
greenville,3d06qy,shaw2885,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:45:37 2015 UTC,"This seems unlikely given the tall towers on North Main. The city seems to have an appetite for building. There probably just isn't any developer interest for super high rise condos only. There's obviously an appetite for dense housing, though. They just built a ~150 unit or something building on Rhett and a 140 unit at Rivers' Edge. There's another 215 unit building going in at River. Another 250 unit is going in on South Main.  Just building out a 5000 unit condo building would be an enormous risk and it's unlikely the market here would support it at a price that would cover the build out costs if that much supply hit the market all at once. There's not even 100,000 people living in the city limits."
greenville,3d06qy,wallstreetnole,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:58:52 2015 UTC,"You mean Main and Stone? those aren't towers. they are luxury condos and under 5 stories.  If you mean Towers East, its basically projects converted to disability housing and grandfathered in. Hence why the folks sit outside usually missing a limb and smoke.   I agree on the risk aspect of a massive building. The 5 story limit though, does just that, it limits housing development for a controlled growth. While the building will increase supply short term, the demand to live downtown continues to grow and will continue. hence supporting higher income. Its a long term play to keep high income folks living downtown."
greenville,3d06qy,suvanna,2,Mon Jul 13 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"I mean the commercial buildings. We have plenty of large commercial towers. We have many buildings over 5 stories, including new ones. (ONE building. The one beside it on Washington.) If a large enough developer threw money at it, a zoning exception for a residential tower would fly through. Money talks to our zoning board like nothing else. I agree with the city here. You can't really throw a bunch of residential supply out there and expect it to work out well. The truth is there just isn't interest for super high rises that are residential only (mixed use sure--there are multi million dollar condos at the top of Poinsett Plaza already, for example, and that building is pretty damn tall). But some of the new apartments are also above five stories, so I'm not sure where this ""5 story zoning rule"" is coming from--it's certainly not being applied to current or past residential development. River Place has six stories in the second building, for example. The city's proposal for mixed residential stuff at County Square was talking about up to twelve stories."
greenville,3d06qy,bluepaintbrush,-2,Mon Jul 13 21:18:30 2015 UTC,There's nobody living within city limits because there's nowhere to live. If you want a 2 bedroom condo you better become a drug dealer because you're going to be paying $500K. Maybe I should look at moving to Manhattan because it's going to be cheaper than Greenville pretty soon. I mean Greenville is nice but dang.  I dare a developer to put up a kickstarter type website to see what type of demand there would be for a giant 1000+ unit condo building downtown. They would be surprised. I just sitting here waiting for something to become available at a reasonable price. I'd gladly buy a condo in a building yet to be built if it means I can just get my hands on a place period.

I've known a few folks that have gone through it and we have even hired a few.  It's hit or miss (like any school) in regards to students and how good they are once they leave.  If you have cash to spare and are determined to work your tail off then the IY could be a good investment. But don't think just cause you go through it's program you'll land an awesome gig and be a rock star developer.   That takes a long time :)  Good luck!

I've had a little bit of experience doing this through learning and really enjoyed it.  My long term goal has always been to work for myself, so eventually having the skill to do freelance work is something I'd want to work for.    As far as having the funds, I'd be going the loan route.  So far it sounds like if you put in the work and effort required, you'll eventually be able to find work.  I don't have a degree, so something like this seems like it could be a good investment over time.  Thanks again"

I'll say this about it, it's a good start on web development but since it's a such a short time period, they don't really get into some things that are VERY helpful to see in a junior developer.    Specifically, I've noticed a lack in teaching the students how to debug their code and also a lack of understanding of why certain things work the way they do in html, css and javascript.  In the end, I feel like it's a good start for someone who's INTERESTED in web development not just looking for a job in coding."

greenville,3cx62v,modern_storyteller,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:02:57 2015 UTC,"I've gone through the program. When I was there it was very very small (only one front end course at a time and only in Greenville). It was really great and I really do think it's the best decision I've made as an adult.  They've since expanded to something like 10+ cities and have even started to work on an international program in London. So what they're doing is obviously working, but I know they've had some problems with instructors not sticking around for the long haul which does worry me a bit. I also know of some students that have had difficulties finding a job and their job placement program is NOT a guarantee that you'll land a job- just that you'll receive a job offer.  Do some research, visit the campus and see if you can't grab a cup of coffee or a beer with some of the staff and see if it's right for you. It's a great program but it's not magic- it requires a lot of work."

In high school, we'd skip class and go to Como's for lunch.   My favorite thing was when I was little, my grandfather would take me ""gallivanting"" on Saturdays (it was actually just running errands like picking up his dry cleaning), and once in a while we'd go to the Woolworth's downtown and I could get a bobo Barbie and a chocolate malt.

greenville,3ckmil,cincydash,7,Fri Jul 10 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"Bacon Brothers. There are lots of fanboys, and that's great, but I'm not impressed. Expensive, service is typically good, menu is heavy a la carte. The food I have had is okay, but I've only been at lunch and didn't want to go over $15-20 with tip so I've only had low end sandwiches (burgers I know, can't remember if I had anything else). People rave about their breakfast platter, it must be a go to. The people I've gone with have had other things, no one raved about it, just that it's good. For the price, I'll pass. I can get a way better value with good food at somewhere like Universal Joint or Carolina Ale House or even Fuddruckers. I respect their farm to table concept and them trying to be different, but, not for the price and the food isn't to write home about. We've tried it multiple times and left disappointed."
greenville,3ckmil,dlightning08,7,Thu Jul 9 00:25:44 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that a restaurant sucks because you always get the cheapest lunch menu item? I've never been to Bacon Bros and have no dog in this fight but that seems like a silly reason to dislike a place, especially when it seems to be more like a fine dining place instead of a hamburger joint.  I also have to disagree with Universal Joint. The food is okay and the atmosphere is nice, but I have had such terrible service every time that I can't go there any more, which is a shame."
greenville,3ckmil,theriotismagic,2,Thu Jul 9 02:49:08 2015 UTC,"To \u\cincydash 's point, I got a reuben (with a water and no sides mind you) and it was $17+ bucks after tip. It was a good sandwich, but nothing about it's quality validated it costing so much. The waiters are friendly. They do a good job of informing you of the ingredients and their sources. The food never seems to live up to the hype though. A $15 sandwhich has big expectations to live up to, the price is definitely a factor. It's not always about trying to get a cheap lunch, so much as a lunch that meets the expectations set by the price and menu description.  I really enjoyed Bacon Bros when they opened. Their original menu and prices seemed more in line with similar options in town. There is a lot of merit in what they do, but the prices are too high for me."
greenville,3ckmil,dlightning08,-1,Thu Jul 9 13:09:46 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree that $15 reuben is expensive but what do you expect? Again, you are going to what appears to be a fine dining restaurant and ordering a sandwich. If I want a sandwich, I go to a deli. If I want something expensive, I go to a fine dining restaurant.   If their sandwich or burgers are $15 or so, I'd willing to bet that's about as cheap as they can make it, while trying to keep a higher dollar clientele. I could explain restaurant pricing, but that's a rant for another day."
greenville,3ckmil,theriotismagic,3,Thu Jul 9 13:21:36 2015 UTC,There is nothing about Bacon Bros that in any way suggests fine dining other than the extravagant prices.  I mean the food itself is basically 'cheap unhealthy food' (or rather it's supposed to be).  Being farm to table doesn't warrant charging double the price to me (and most other people I know) but apparently quite a few people disagree.
greenville,3ckmil,dlightning08,2,Thu Jul 9 14:03:00 2015 UTC,"If you buy quality meats from farmers who actually give a damn like a lot of them do around here, the meat can be twice as much easily. That's the difference. There's a big difference between grocery store meat and the kind you can get at the Farmer's Market. And then, when you add making a lot of what you do from scratch, that requires cost of the food plus the time it requires in labor. For a menu that is between $12-$25 (from what they have on their site), that's a pretty good deal."
greenville,3ckmil,theriotismagic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:13:35 2015 UTC,"I understand the point that it's farm to table, made fresh, smoked out back...great.  The concept itself is solid.  I'm not a ""food snob"" so I can't debate the details, but I assume that it's quality.  The taste isn't there.  The experience isn't there in order to justify the pricing.  It doesn't make me want to come back.  It was just a meal to me, and even that, I wasn't totally satisfied."
greenville,3ckmil,dlightning08,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:45:43 2015 UTC,"Are you saying the food is not good or are you saying the food is not good enough for the price? If it was $5 cheaper, would your opinion change to praise?"
greenville,3ckmil,cincydash,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:00:31 2015 UTC,"For $7 or $8, the patty is unique enough to justify worth trying and having occasionally.  Maybe even enough to tell other just for the concept itself of brisket, bacon and chuck.  However, for the portion size and toppings (cheese, pickles, sauce), I'm still leaving hungry.  Throw in some fries or chips, I'm in.  Granted, they'd probably be selling it at a loss for the cost of the meat itself."
greenville,3ckmil,dlightning08,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"At $7 or $8, they aren't losing money at the cost of the beef itself. But that's not the only thing that goes into pricing. You have a million other things you have to pay for such as rent, labor, electricity, etc., etc. At that point yes, they aren't making enough money to justify putting an $8 burger on the menu. Your complaint is just you do not want to pay more for better ingredients. You just want enough food to fill you up, and that's not the type of restaurant Bacon Brothers wants to be. They don't want to be a more expensive Five Guys. The concept of fine dining isn't just limited to expensive French techniques, it's now taking American style food and using better ingredients with better techniques to make a better dish. The differences may not slap you in the face, but they are there.  It's just like the craft beer industry. Hey, you want to drink a lot for cheap, grab a 24 pack of Bud Light for $18. It tastes like beer and it's cheap. But if you want something that has any other flavor than cheap grains, you pay $10 for a 6 pack from Thomas Creek. It costs more because they can't buy in bulk like Budweiser and they use ingredients that would cost more anyway because they have the freedom to use it how they like."
greenville,3ckmil,aGeekSaga,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:38:21 2015 UTC,"Nothing about the experience screamed fine dining though. That's why I feel it's overrated. The smoking of the meat, taste of the rye bread, and supposed quirkiness of the sauerkraut were not there. I was expecting a unique take on the deli classic and ended up with an overpriced (and boring) sandwich. I'm a huge Greenfield's fan. You can't beat their rueben. An inventive, farm-to-table version of that sounded great. I would've gotten it and been disappointed regardless of price."
greenville,3ckmil,alanedomain,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:48:34 2015 UTC,"I won't argue the quality since I've never had it. But looking at menu prices online, you paid less than 4 dollars more for what I assume is all in house made ingredients. I'm sure Greenfield's is good, but they aren't making their ingredients and only charging 8 bucks."
greenville,3ckmil,sockgorilla,2,Thu Jul 9 14:00:09 2015 UTC,"The politics of pricing are beyond me. As a consumer my concern is the product, not the cost to the business of preparing said product. I was expecting the scratch made sandwhich with ingredients made in house to be awesome. There was nothing exciting about it though. That's when I look at the price and wonder ""what gives?"". I paid a premium for the house made ingredients and it did not deliver.."
greenville,3ckmil,BottomoftheFifth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:33:42 2015 UTC,"You said overpriced, I tried to argue that. If it doesn't taste that great, then I can't tell you that you are wrong in thinking that.

greenville,3ckmil,Koosh25,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:39:12 2015 UTC,Understood. I was holding it to the standard of a $17 experience. It did not deliver. I wouldn't say it was bad because I could've gotten a sandwhich more to my liking for cheaper elsewhere. It was a bad experience because for $17 I got a run-of-the-mill sandwhich and a glass of water.
greenville,3ckmil,kissthering,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:51:51 2015 UTC,"All I will say is that it cost more because the ingredients cost more and is more labor intensive. If you would love the sandwich if it only cost $10, it's more a you thing than a Bacon Brothers thing."
greenville,3ckmil,deathlifter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:05:41 2015 UTC,"You make a solid point that they are aiming to be more fine dining and we order cheaper items, which may be why we are disappointed. But the product we received doesn't motivate us to want to try anything more expensive.  I've never had a bad experience at Universal Joint in the two or three times I've been there. Of course it was during lunch and not as crowded, YMMV."

Another time, the waitstaff was outside playing with a dog throughout my entire visit while it was busy.

Usually involves bodyweight exercises with some short distance running mixed in.

However, it's a hole in the wall, so as long as you're ok with the restaurant not being the fanciest, you'll probably be very happy with the place. The lady who owns it is a sweetheart too.

greenville,3cirnl,hawleywood,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"Asada - Latin Fusion on Wade Hampton  Thai Restaurant - Bland name, amazing food on Augusta  Pita House - It's worth mentioning again. Get the Middle East plate with Gyro or just go home  India Palace - Awesome Indian food on Pleasantburg  The Blockhouse - Their burgers are fantastic; nothing special, just a great burger  Henry's - THE BEST BBQ. Ever. On Wade Hampton. I prefer the spicy BBQ sauce. Definitely get the sweet potato casserole as a side.  Southern Culture - Go for Sunday brunch and get the Yard Bird with fried egg (heart attack on a plate, but you will die happy) and $12 bottomless mimosas  DishOut Cafe - Really good food - the menu changes frequently. The owner used to own Corporate Deli, so you'll recognize some of the dishes if you ever ate there.  Stax Omega - Really great diner. I love to go there for breakfast and get their Challah French toast. I use blackberry jam instead of syrup. It's delicious. They also have amazing cakes and desserts.  Brick St. Cafe - Best cakes anywhere in the Upstate. Their food is awesome, too. If you go for lunch, the fresh fruit plate is their most popular (and my favorite), but I've never had anything bad there. Get a piece of cake for dessert, doesn't matter what kind. You'll enjoy it.  Tealoha - They have food, which is great, but I go there for the tea. It's amazing. The London Fog (Early Grey latte) is my favorite, but they're all good.  Edit: I forgot about Tony's Pizza on Haywood and Tito's on Pleasantburg! Two of the best pizza places in town. Tito's is my all-time favorite, but it's further away from where I live, so I go to Tony's more often."

I eat out very often and have tried so so so many places in Greenville and most of my favorites are 'reasonably priced with high quality food'.   Chinese: Oriental House (by far) Mexican: Papas and Beer, Chuy's for non-traditional Pizza: Bellacinos (this is definitely heavily opinion based as Pizza tastes vary a lot, I've heard Grimaldi's is insanely good) Middle Eastern: Pita House (their falafels are damn near orgasmic) Steak: Rare on the Piazza, though IMO none of the steakhouses in greenville are all that great, I'd usually rather make a steak myself at home BBQ: Mac's Speed Shop Sushi: This one is tough, probably Sushi Masa Thai: Sweet Basil Thai   My mind is going blank on other food right now so I'll leave it at that and update later when I think of some of the other amazing restaurants around here.  Edit:  Forgot about Tijuana Flats since it's so new around here.  I've been eating at since the late 90s coming here from Orlando - as far as tex-mex goes it's really good.  I usually go on tuesdays for the $5.50 lunch special - 2 tacos, chips, drink."

Mac's is one of the only places here that I would even consider going to for BBQ.  I hear Smoke on the Water is good and not really SC style but I haven't tried it yet.  I've been to probably 15 different BBQ restaurants in the Greenville area and Mac's is one of the only ones I'd ever go back to even though it's a 'chain'.  It also has the advantage of having a decently large beer selection.  If you like SC style BBQ then pick any of the places I listed above, they all serve basically the same ultra dry chopped pork/chicken."

You can pretty much substitute Charlie's, Buckey's, Tom's, Little Pig, etc and they're pretty much the exact same thing with the exact same sauces, flavors, same dry meat, same sides, etc."
greenville,3cirnl,honeybadgerdontgive,3,Wed Jul 8 19:05:02 2015 UTC,I have never had dry bbq there.  We get them to cater large events and never had any complaints.  Clearly you are delusional.
greenville,3cirnl,crackofdawn,-1,Wed Jul 8 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"I've been twice, got the pulled pork the first time - dry like any other SC style BBQ place (this seems to be done on purpose, you have to cover it in BBQ sauce to make it edible).  Second time I got the beef brisket and it was actually visibly dry, as in I had to smother it in BBQ sauce just to get it down.  Most SC natives I talk to around here say thats how they like their BBQ - dry and chopped.  It's just the thing around here.  I don't know why people like it that way but whatever floats your boat.  I prefer my BBQ without sauce - good BBQ shouldn't need sauce, and SC bbq absolutely needs sauce to make it moist enough to eat."
greenville,3cirnl,freckledbastard,2,Wed Jul 8 19:13:34 2015 UTC,"No one should serve brisket in a restaurant. If they do, it needs to be immediately available until it's gone.

greenville,3cirnl,crackofdawn,-2,Wed Jul 8 19:30:59 2015 UTC,"Every native SC person I work with thinks 'dry bbq' is the the thing/good.  None of them realized it was dry until I mentioned how dry it was and asked them to try BBQ somewhere that wasn't SC style (Sonny's, Mac's, etc).  Then they just admitted 'we just like it that way here' :)  Some places are more dry than others.  Places that serve it chopped like Mutt's, Charlie's, etc have it ultra dry."
greenville,3cirnl,honeybadgerdontgive,2,Wed Jul 8 19:37:57 2015 UTC,Then clearly you don't work with sc natives. Mutts pulled pork is typically dry but toms pulled pork is always very moist.
greenville,3cirnl,freckledbastard,2,Thu Jul 9 03:15:26 2015 UTC,Tom's is overpriced?? lol ok   you should try the mcrib at mcdonalds
greenville,3cirnl,crackofdawn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:06:12 2015 UTC,"Compared to a lot of BBQ restaurants around here yes.  I went there for lunch, had a platter and a drink and it was $12.   Considering how bad the food is, that's definitely overpriced.  I'll take Voodoo BBQ over that any day for the same price.  Tons of people around here are from out of state, and to a lot (dare I say most) of us non native South Carolinians, SC bbq is just bad.  Edit: I  also smoke my own Pork Butt at home all the time and I can make it a lot more moist and a lot better tasting than any of the SC style BBQ places around here, and for far cheaper, which makes it all the worse when I end up at a SC style BBQ place.  I would have to actively try and screw up my BBQ to make it as dry and bland tasting as places like Tom's, Charlie's, etc.  Just my opinion.  We discuss this sort of stuff at work all the time and pretty much all the Greenville natives love places like Charlie's and Tom's, and pretty much all of the people that moved here from anywhere else in the country hate those places.  Edit2: You realize something can be cheap and still be overpriced right?  That 'overpriced' doesn't have to mean unaffordable or expensive, it just means the cost is more than it's worth, which definitely describes the food at Tom's."
greenville,3cirnl,freckledbastard,2,Wed Jul 8 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"Any meal you make at home is going to be cheaper. $10-$15 is standard for lunch anywhere in Greenville outside of fast food.  Btw, kudos for smoking your own pork. I grew up doing it and still do now with friends especially when we have people over.  You must have had a bad experience at Tom's. His pork is probably the most consistent over the year I've been going there.   Where are you from originally?"
greenville,3cirnl,crackofdawn,-2,Wed Jul 8 19:16:09 2015 UTC,"Alaska.  But I've moved around a lot, came here from Orlando 8 years ago.  Almost all of the places I listed in my original post are <$10 for lunch and (in my opinion obviously) leaps and bounds better than Tom's, Charlie's, Mutt's, Buckey's, Little Pig, Henry's, etc.  As far as smoking my own Pork, been doing it for ~15 years.  I buy 4 pork butts (usually around 24-26 lbs total) and smoke them all together (currently on a weber smokey mountain) so I can make a huge amount and have tons of leftovers.  After we eat our fill I split the remainder into ~10-12 separate vaccuum sealed bags and freeze them.  Reheating them in a pan with a tiny bit of water makes it taste almost like it just came off the smoker.  Edit:  And the total cost for 26 lbs of pork with spices and everything for me is around $35, which means ~$1 per meal, not including sides or anything.  There are plenty of BBQ places around here that are way less expensive than Tom's, but even if Tom's was less expensive I just don't think the food is good.  Even if it was $7 a plate I still wouldn't want to go."

greenville,3cha8w,mentaljewelry,13,Wed Jul 8 11:39:36 2015 UTC,Fords is awful.  It should be illegal for them to say that food has ANY resemblance to Cajun or Creole cuisine.  We transferred here from New Orleans and I miss my Muffalettas and crawfish!
greenville,3cha8w,Pyramids-and-tombs,4,Wed Jul 8 04:14:45 2015 UTC,Agreed!  I was discussing this with a friend the other day.  Where can one get authentic Cajun or Creole in Greenville?  I have yet to find a place.
greenville,3cha8w,deathlifter,2,Wed Jul 8 15:11:03 2015 UTC,Went one time. Staff admitted that the food is reheated from packages.

greenville,3cha8w,hawleywood,3,Wed Jul 8 01:13:33 2015 UTC,It's always hit or miss on the service. Try not to sit in the bar area too. The bartenders are also servers there so you get second rate service--unless you're actually at the bar. Sitting in the main dining area is a world apart.

I think its a great spot. go for a casual afternoon/evening with friends and have some beers outside. it is not a fast casual pace, and the owners are European so they will not cater to patrons the way most Americans expect. I think this can explain 99.99% of the bad online reviews lol.    my go-to is Trappe Door. man I love that place. food is excellent, beer selection is excellent. Lazy Goat is top notch for a date night. I also eat at the Blockhouse all the time because its in my neighborhood and while their menu is simple they execute the hell out of it."

California Dreaming is also a chain, and while Chophouse '47 isn't an outright chain the same company owns several other steakhouses.

greenville,3cha8w,ecle,7,Wed Jul 8 02:15:47 2015 UTC,I think a lot of the hype is from years and years ago when it was one of the only real nice places in Greenville. It hasn't kept up with the competition.
greenville,3cha8w,mindfulshrimp,3,Wed Jul 8 03:31:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. Ever since the original owner died I think 4 years ago the food quality lowered very greatly.

Therefore, I always hesitate to label a place as ""the worst"" or ""the best.""  I've written a TON of restaurant reviews, and it's been my experience that any restaurant can have a bad night.  The question is whether or not a place is consistently bad.  It's also been my experience that restaurants that are consistently bad tend not to stay in business.  One visit, then saying, ""I'll never go back again"" is probably not a true measure.  It also depends on personal taste.  Perhaps ""most overrated restaurant"" might be a more appropriate topic title? ;-)  Disclaimers aside, we have never enjoyed our visits to ANY of the Rick Erwin establishments.  Waiters have been rude, food has been so-so, and we even heard the namesake loudly berate employees at one of them, despite being within earshot of patrons."

Taco bell is literally better, and that's some bad shit. Ford's is so terrible on all fronts it baffles me to no end how that place is open still. I mean everything is flat out disgusting. I always tell people to avoid Soby's at all costs. It's popular because of it's PR team, not it's food. For the price, it's terrible. It seems people actually like smoke on the water, but it's some bad stuff as well. It's a time warp straight to horrible food from the 80's, nothing is seasoned, creative or of any quality. It seems like anything with the staxx name attached  to it relies on food that's frozen, canned, premade or out of a box. The same could be said of all Rick Erwin restaurants for that matter, slick interior decorating with a nice wine list and really mediocre, low quality ingredients at a premium price."

I commuted everyday so there wasn't any distractions. also married so that helped with that as well.  I went to school 5 days a week, 7:45-2:45. for 3:30 in the morning we had lab which was welding in the shop. after lunch we had 2 hours of lecture about anything you can possibly think of that's welding related. overall i really enjoyed it. I love pushing myself to be better and i did that everyday. the down sides for me were the commute, an hour each way, and hanging around with kids that i was technically old enough to have fathered them. it was worth though.

greenville,3bqzxp,CaffinatedLink,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:18:35 2015 UTC,"thought i'd add a little more detail to what kind of welding I actually did. the first semester was as follows, 5 weeks of OxyFuel cutting, 10 weeks of stick on plate in every position, fillets and grooves. second semester was 5 weeks of MIG in every position followed by FluxCore for 5 weeks. about half way through the second semester we had to complete this big weldment using OFC, stick, mig, and fluxcore. huge pain in the ass, everyone called it the ""boat anchor"" because they just wanted to throw it in a lake. last 5 weeks were TIG.  third semester was a nightmare. 6"" schedule 40 pipe, 6G position, open root, 6010 root, 7018 fill/cover, 75 degree groove angle. not a happy weld shop for at least 5 weeks. then the last 10 weeks it was mig open root plate which was a joke compared to the open root pipe! also in the last 5 weeks or so we got into TIG pretty heavily. I think it was 2"" .125"" wall mild steel tubing 2G and 5G open root.   fourth semester was TIG 2"" schedule 40 SS pipe in 2G and 5G open root. after that it was 3"" aluminum .25 wall or so in 2G and 5G butt joint. then the remainder was our senior projects which we had to come up with a concept, draw it in CAD, order material, write a bill of materials, build said thing to the drawing you drew, write a 1,500 word paper and give a 15 min presentation on your project. it was a busy semester that's for sure. and on top of that we sold our house, bought a 1984 toyota sunrader rv, moved into the in-laws temporarily, fixed up the rv, and drove  to greenville 2.5 weeks ago.  good times! hope this gives you an idea of what school was like for me and perhaps what to expect if you're planning on attending.  FYI we welded to AWS standards and were graded to that standard. .25"" fillet is a .25"" fillet, any bigger or smaller and its wrong."

There are a good many bars and restaurants to hang out in, if that's your thing. If not, the Reedy River park is pretty relaxing to hang out at.  Camp Croft in Spartanburg is pretty cool if you're into hiking / biking and outdoor activities. There are a lot of things to get into and do, even on a budget if you look around. The key to the Upstate is that, unlike a larger city, you have to do a bit more poking around and looking to find them.

To add a scenic route to the endeavor, take 25 into Belton and go to Abbeville that way. Lots of trees. Some pretty houses.   So once you hit the square, everything worth visiting is within walking distance. The Village Grill is worth hitting up for a French dip and cashew butter pie. Natty's is across the street from the Grill. I haven't been there yet, but people seem to like them. I know the owners, and they're cool people, so I'll vouch for a visit.  There's the Opera House, and that's a fun experience. It's an old building (like all of the other buildings on the square) and the seats are cushy and it's not so huge that you can't enjoy the show from the back row. And in case you start bleeding to death mid-show, they stock the ladies room with tampons and pads. I thought that was neat.  Lots of Mennonites in the area, so there are a couple of stores if you're into Live, Laugh, Love memorabilia. Oh, and there's a little grocery store now with a lot of... well, like there was a lot of trail mix. It's been a while.  If you like history, you can get your Civil War fix. The Burt-Starke mansion is there. They do tours and stuff. I think there's a haunted house somewhere in the area that does tours if you're into that, but I'm not 100% on the details.   It's not the most exciting town, but they do have the best pie."

greenville,3bnslu,freckledbastard,0,Wed Jul 8 23:22:32 2015 UTC,The attitude toward development in Greenville and surrounding areas kind of makes me sad. I say to people that Greenville needs more tall buildings so that people can actually live in town and everyone is like nooooooo. Nobody actually wants anything resembling a city in this area so we get endless suburbs instead.  The geographically closest city to Greenville that I would actually call a city is Charlotte. I may eventually move to Charlotte if Greenville doesn't build me any place to live. There is apparently some kind of stigma against buildings higher than 3 stories that I don't understand.  Greenville hasn't actually grown in population since 1960. They just kind of buldoze the ghetto and build extremely low rise condos in their place which doesn't increase the population count.  I'm harsh because I love Greenville. I want to live there!! If we could build places for people to live that would be great.  I spend a lot of time in China. While a lot of things suck in China there are some things they do get right. They do a building technique which they call urban villages. You usually have mixed use buildings where the bottom 5-10 floors are retail and offices. The upper 20-30 floors are condos. For some reason in the US we haven't figured out yet how to combine shopping and living spaces. Why can't I live on top of a Wal-Mart like I can in China? I look at stores here and I just see wasted space over them. I want to live on top of a grocery store. It's amazing to be able to shop every day and have a tiny fridge rather than once a week and horde up a week's worth of food.  Come on guys! Build some stuff!

greenville,3bopcm,MarsTheRover,2,Tue Jun 30 22:23:03 2015 UTC,I thought about building an off grid solar powered cabin out of those. I didn't get much farther than thinking about it though.  One thing that I read is that they are VERY poorly insulated so you really have to pay attention to that when building it out. It's essentially a giant metal radiator that you are making a house out of. In the sun it will be an oven. In the winter it will be equal to the outside temperature even with a heater. Some people mentioned re-purposing the refrigerated containers as they are already insulated.
greenville,3bopcm,joe9439,2,Wed Jul 1 06:31:04 2015 UTC,These peaked my curiousity as well and this may or may not help. If you take a little drive out of town on 385 there is a company selling shipping containers with one painted an obnoxious bright green on the north side of 385. Can't miss it. I remember pulling up their website (which I cannot find now) and they sell several different size containers. I can't remember anything about their company converting these but it might be an easy way for you to put your hands on an actual container and see how big a project it might be.   If these guys could solve all the issues of getting one there you might be able to work with a standard local contractor to finish it out. It might not be apples to apples work but it's not apples to rhinoceroses. Keep us updated if you find any good info.
greenville,3bopcm,OCR755,0,Thu Jul 2 18:08:08 2015 UTC,I know there is a company in Charlotte that sells them. Can't remember their name though. I can look it up in a bit.

In fact any place you take them too wouldn't even waste the time looking. The only thing you can do is get a beckett and look up any really old, or big names you find. And even then, unless you get the diamond in the rough, you probably don't have anything. Sorry."
greenville,3bndto,jabbakahut,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:15:04 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it's gone but you are right about the 80s-90s part. Just too many cards were made.   But most of this collection is from the 60s-70s. Which is definitely before my time. Hence why I wanted to get them checked out.

If you're not getting having any luck finding somewhere, you could swing by Borderlands on Laurens Rd.  I'm almost positive they don't sell sports related cards, as they're a comic book shop, but they may be able to point you in a specific direction."
greenville,3bndto,RodneyPeete9,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:58:31 2015 UTC,If I'm not mistaken Greenville Sports Card Connection shut down the actual store. You may be able to contact the owner and get his opinion.  Like most people said anything post 85-95 is worthless for the most part. Maybe a few things worth a couple bucks but 60[s and 70's could have some gems. The newer cards 00-now often have value but more for the autograph cards and relics. Always consult Ebay and other collectors before you sell if you have little knowledge some dealers prey on newbies. (Sad but I've seen it a ton!)

So its possible that there is just a leak caused either by the wreck or a dry rotted line that cracked when it was moved when the radiator was being put in.   I'm hoping its a case of simply finding the leak, stopping it, and having it recharged.

AC has not been working for some time and with the rising temps I'm not sure I can hold out much longer without it. It still blows warm air. I don't want to spend a ton of money on fixing it so I'm trying to find someone who does good work and is relatively inexpensive. Let me know how it goes for you.
greenville,3b8dmx,wallstreetnole,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:13:17 2015 UTC,"Go to youtube and search for your year car make and model recharge AC. My boyfriend's jeep was having this problem about a week ago and he thought I pretty much preformed witchcraft. It costs like $16 and takes 10 minutes.   On most cars you're looking for a black hose that ends in a silver cap that has two barbs (car penis is a technical term.) you attach the r-134 kit to the bigger of the two car penises. Turn the car on and go back to your kit. If the gauge is lower than 20 psi, its not actually on the air compressor. If it is, cool. you got this. Consult the current temperature and the instructions in the kit to see what PSI it should be at before you stop. Oh. Make sure to shake the can every 5 or so seconds. Anything over 55 psi is a no. If the can feels empty, turn the can over. If it doesn't get high enough based on the temp, you need a second can. Turn the car off, take the can off, bask in your cool car."

If you're wondering what to go with first, try the tonkatsu, it's always been my favorite.  They have some side dishes like dumplings and rice balls with fish inside.  It's a legit ramen shop. First day we went, we were the only white dudes in there. We stuck out like a sore thumb, but ordered the fuck out of some ramen.  The only other ramen I've had was in NYC at ippudo. I knew what I liked already so I was surprised to see it on the menu. I think I surprised the owner."

greenville,3b2c3w,papajohn56,0,Thu Jul 9 22:48:33 2015 UTC,"Debit cards serve no viable purpose. They lack the protection of credit cards when it comes to fraud. While they (banks) do investigate issues, the chances of you being out large sums of money for extended periods of time are very high. CCard companies have entire divisions of people who deal with this stuff...because it's their money on the line, not yours.  Seriously consider removing debit cards from your life.   Edit: Everything I said it absolutely true. Debit cards offer you no advantage, and less protection. There are so many far more advantageous ways of paying for good and services than a card tied directly to you account(s)."
greenville,3b2c3w,ncshooter426,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:22:10 2015 UTC,"People with poor credit cannot get a credit card, but they can get a debit card.     The exact people who shouldn't have a debit card. Someone who has limited funds/cash flow has a much greater potential to be seriously impacted in the event of compromise. Someone in that situation might not be able to just deal with the 30+ days of  potential investigation to get the funds returned. 500$ is nothing to me, but it may be the world to someone else. It's not worth the risk.   Not getting a card isn't helping their poor credit history either. Debit card payments have zero impact. Damn near anyone can get n unsecured card with 500$ limit. The interest will be insane, however that is only applicable if they don't pay the balance."
greenville,3b2c3w,Valien,0,Thu Jun 25 13:22:28 2015 UTC,Nothing you said was true. Not one thing.
greenville,3b2c3w,ncshooter426,4,Thu Jun 25 13:29:38 2015 UTC,"A lot of what he said is very true.  Automatically debiting from your bank account like that is far more risky, even with some protections they offer.  Even if you do have protections in place on a debit card, it will take time to authenticate the fraud and get the money back in to your account, so you could be sitting overdrawn or at a $0 balance for a week or more.  Credit cards have that buffer between them.  Plus debit cards are just less useful and have more annoyances, things like temporary holds that freeze funds in your bank account.  I deal a lot with merchant processing, and credit cards provide much better protection and service than debit."
greenville,3b2c3w,papajohn56,4,Thu Jun 25 13:07:27 2015 UTC,Everything I said is absolutely true. A debit card offers you NO ADVANTAGE over a credit card. None. Zero.   You stay classy kiddo.
greenville,3b2c3w,Valien,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:37:34 2015 UTC,"Don't know what kind of debit card you use but I only use a DC. Never have had an issue. In fact they are faster on reporting security issues than CC's. All depends on your bank I guess.  Sometimes my DC is overly secure and I need to call the bank to add some temporary removals for certain transactions (above certain amount or foreign mainly).  So yeah, DC's are fantastic. :D YMMV"
greenville,3b2c3w,humjaba,5,Thu Jun 25 13:23:09 2015 UTC,I don't use them. They offer no advantage for me   Do not build credit history Offer limited protection when compared with the major CC orgs Impose daily limits in most cases to transfers. Don't have additional rewards/buyer protection/etc.   I do >100K a year on my Amex. They don't screw around when it comes to having your back on purchases. Banks offer me little by comparison.
greenville,3b2c3w,Valien,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:30:51 2015 UTC,Same here.  Amex is amazing.
greenville,3b2c3w,humjaba,-1,Thu Jun 25 13:36:56 2015 UTC,See I could care less about credit (I live  debt free) so CC's have no advantage for me. But yeah if you're doing that much with AMEX then that's prob a good move. :D
greenville,3b2c3w,Valien,2,Thu Jun 25 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"Wish I could pay cash for a house. Must be nice.  There is also cash back, fraud protection on a cc works so that you owe less, rather than the bank taking some time to put money back in your account after it's been removed, rental car insurance, my Amex provides another year of warranty on all items purchased, I can shop at Costco. I have no debt either, but I would like to buy a house someday so I'm building credit by using my card and paying it off every month. Take your head out of the sand - a responsibly used credit card is better than a debit card in every way except for the occasion you need cash."
greenville,3b2c3w,papajohn56,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:47:42 2015 UTC,Huh? I'm not dissing folks for using CC's. I just mentioned my personal choice in the matter. I do have a mortgage (only debt so I correct my other statement). I pay cash for cars and everything else. If I don't have the money for something then I don't buy it or I save until I have the money. It's easy when you live on a budget and live on less than you make.  I have made a personal choice to use a DC vs a CC. I have no regrets by doing so and probably won't change either. I spend less using a DC for sure! :)
greenville,3b2c3w,Valien,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:57:40 2015 UTC,"I pay cash for my cars, as well. Treat a credit card like your debit card (pay it off every month). I just listed some of the benefits. You can get cash back (i get 1% back on everything, 2% on groceries and 3% on gas). It's literally free money.

greenville,3b2c3w,Valien,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:58:10 2015 UTC,(I live debt free)   Why?  Being educated about debt and using it as leverage is much smarter.  Credit is a valuable tool if you're not an idiot.
greenville,3b2c3w,IceburgSlimk,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:05:55 2015 UTC,Because as I mentioned earlier I've been on the other side of CC debt due to stupid decisions on my part and parts of others. I will never be slave to it again and as soon as my home is paid off then I will never look back.  And the greatest wealth building tool you have in your arsenal is your income. Not debt leverage.

I used to go to Athens a lot when I lived in Greenville,  but not everyone knows about it.   Athens is only 1.5 hours away and while I think it's always worth the trip for the food coffee (Jittery Joes), and beer (Terrapin and Creature Comforts) alone,  it also has a great music scene.  As an illustration, REM, Drive by Truckers, B-52s, Of Montreal, Widespread Panic, Love Tractor, Reptar are all Athens.  Danger Mouse, too.   A lot of the shows are free, including Of Montreal, the Whigs, New Madrid, and the Baseball Project (some guys from REM and other big bands I don't remember with baseball related songs). There's a club crawl with concerts all over downtown (walkable). There are also day parties which have beer and more concerts that aren't listed on the Athfest site, including a Breakfast of Champions on Saturday morning with free (good) beer, coffee, tacos, and music. You can find those types of events on Flagpole.  There are 100 bars in a square mile and there will be music and beer everywhere.   I am not affiliated with the event, I'm just really excited about it and wanted to share with you guys and the Augusta sub since I live there and that is nearby also."

My speedtests with charter are usually in the 75-85Mbit range and it still ends up being cheaper than much slower internet from AT&T.  You'll have to check if you can get charter in that area though.  As far as security you'll probably have to decide that for yourself.

greenville,3aw9mt,MichelleEllyn,2,Wed Jun 24 15:07:30 2015 UTC,FYI Residential and Business are exactly the same from a routing perspective. I had both at my home at the same time and the only difference was that they provided an SLA for support and a static ip address. The only reason it seems so much better is that they fixed the problem you had with residential by likely replacing the coax run from the pole or connecting to a different tap.
greenville,3aw9mt,konoo,-1,Wed Jun 24 20:17:50 2015 UTC,"1) reliable roommate and a dog. Also a firearm. Best home defense period. 2) AT&T Uverse has been working well except between 5-8pm.  To expand on 1 and give you some advice, I bought my condo in North Main 3.5 years ago. I travel very similarly and am also in outside sales. I would rent out to a renter to monetize my house. They would have their own bedroom and bathroom. They had good jobs and were young professionals in their 20s. I knew my place was secure and they helped pay the mortgage when I wasn't there, which was more often.  Hope this helps!"
greenville,3aw9mt,shaw2885,-1,Wed Jun 24 01:28:03 2015 UTC,"That might be a good defense system but it isn't the best for a homeowner. Insurance companies provide a substantial discount if you have an alarm that notifies emergency responders if there's a break in or fire. I bought my own hardware so I only have the monthly, contract-free service fee which is less than my insurance discount."
greenville,3aw9mt,CC440,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:22:08 2015 UTC,"that might be a good defense system but it isn't the best for a homeowner.   Dogs are the best defense system period as long as they are spaniel size and bigger. My family has had coonhounds from rescue shelters for the last 20 years, between my parents and my place. Their bay is loud enough to scare anyone and notify anyone in 1000 ft radius something bad is happening.  An alarm system might get you a discount, on insurance, but from my experience, it has always been a waste of money.  Example, some illegals broke into my parents house in PA. Alarm system didn't do jack. It was armed and didn't go off until they guys left. The guys left because they woke up Bucky and Bucky woke my parents....and their neighbors. This was a very affluent area as well. Bucky was at Doggy Day Care when they scoped the place."
greenville,3aw9mt,shaw2885,2,Wed Jun 24 18:27:47 2015 UTC,"The dog's size doesn't matter much, as long as they're willing to bark long and loud they're a fantastic deterrent. Seasoned burglars will leave the second anything starts to draw attention to their unwanted presence. Spaniels tend to suck at that job, our Boykin is practically mute.  I agree that home security systems are useless when it comes to stopping a burglary that's underway,  I point out the insurance discount because the savings can often outweigh the monthly service fee, it's a free $10 every month innmy case. I'd also hate to get jerked around by an insurance company should the absence of a system effect their payout. I doubt that would happen with most companies but you can never predict what a massive, profit seeking bureaucracy will do."
greenville,3aw9mt,CC440,0,Wed Jun 24 20:41:08 2015 UTC,"Fair point.  I meant spaniel size dogs in regards to would-be burglars scoping a place out. A dog around a cocker spaniel size will force a bad guy to look somewhere else usually. A bark/bay is best at a deterrent though. I would take a beagle's bay over a Rottweiler's build for security.   But I love my coonhounds. Always need homes, loyal loving creatures, beautiful animals and goofy looking at the same time, and when they bark/bay, it's loud!"
greenville,3aw9mt,shaw2885,0,Wed Jun 24 22:42:26 2015 UTC,"As a former home security installer and monitoring station employee, if I know your not home, I can care less if you have an alarm. I would just smash and grab if I looked at your dmark box and noticed no phone line. I would also kick in the front door as I would have 30 to 60 seconds before the alarm actually goes off.

greenville,3aw9mt,Evaunit01berser,2,Wed Jun 24 09:42:39 2015 UTC,"Thats why they invented always on cellular panels. If the panel sends a door open, or motion, and then the station doesnt get the disarm code it triggers an alarm at the station. POTS alarms are a thing of the past."
greenville,3aw9mt,kilbus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:48:55 2015 UTC,Yup pots alarms are a thing of the past but I will add that most modern alarms are not only cellular but also have a battery in the panel along with reinforced casing. This way if they are ripped off the wall (which sends an immediate alert) and thrown on the ground they are still functioning.

If the fan outside doesn't kick on it's most likely an issue with the contactor or motor. Don't try to take the motor off, it's a serious PIA. Contactors are easy to swap, same as capacitors. If the fan works it's probably low Freon and you'll be lucky to get it fixed for $200."

Squat racks, bench press, free weights, sleds, box fans, no AC and tires to throw around?  Basically a modern crossfit place without the crossfit bullshit?  If not would anyone want a basic gym like that? That's more my type of place.   I currently go to Coops. I like it but it has too much shit for me.  Too many upsells and staff trying to 'put you on a plan'.

I've been working out at home doing yoga and bodyweight exercises and I'm down 15 pounds in 70 days (188 to 173). All it cost me is the price of a yoga mat, a pull up bar, and rings.

greenville,3amow5,i_like_marbles,2,Sun Jun 21 22:53:26 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for using a cable card with Charter, but I've used most of the rest of that setup with OTA for a couple of years.   First the Silicon Dust HDHomeRun. SD makes solid equipment, and it works great on the network. Just make sure you get a Cable Card version, not an OTA/ Clear QAM version. It's worth making sure you're getting the current version available (check the the Silicon Dust website for the current versions when shopping, as there are older versions available for sale that won't have the same feature set as the latest ones).  If you have any premium channels (known as ""Copy Once"") you will only be able to record them with WMC, on a Windows box. This means sticking with Win7 (WMC is included), or Win8 (WMC is an upgrade), as WMC has been retired in Win10 ....  If you don't, then there are other PVR options available, but in my experience most are tougher to setup, and will require a third party EPS subscription.  You may also not be able to watch recordings from those ""copy once"" channels on extenders, so keep that in mind.   WMC also records into a proprietary format, so playback on other devices without some modification isn't possible (extenders being the exception).  I personally run a Windows 7 HTPC attached to the TV in the living room as a full blown DVR, and it's a very nice solution. It's not as pretty as some of the other stuff, but it's dead simple to setup, and just works. Out of the box there are some minor annoyances (very short cache time for paused live TV is one), but there's plenty of info out there on how to adjust these things, and some third party tools to sexy it up a bit.   For non ""Copy Once"" content (most regular channels), you can use third party tools like MCE Buddy to convert to formats usable by other devices, and even strip out commercials.   That would allow you to use something like Plex to serve those shows to other devices, but you won't be able to share a live broadcast. You'll only be able to convert the shows after they have been recorded.   Plex in and of itself is a great solution for serving local media to other devices. We have a bunch of ripped DVD content on our HTPC, and use Plex to serve it to Rokus on other TVs in the house."

We have everything online at home, so Charter made sense. And surprisingly, given their reputation, the only issue we have had with them was when someone moved out of the apartment next door and the tech cut our service off instead of the neighbor's. Got a shiny new router out of it."

Reliability tends to vary from one area to the next.  AT&T is willing to ""deal"" if you tell them you're considering switching when your contract runs out.  Charter is starting to refuse deals which is stupid considering the profits margins."

greenville,3ajm46,dat2109,2,Sun Jun 21 14:23:07 2015 UTC,Charter or Uverse are your only options.  Do not go Uverse!! They have the worst peering I've ever seen. When we had them a few months ago I had to use a VPN or my connection would only be like 0.5 megabits to sites like youtube even though we had a 12 megabit line. AT&T cheaps out on interconnection with datacenters and content providers. You'll get the 12 megabits advertised but ONLY to AT&T servers. You can forget about Google or Netflix servers though. I don't know if AT&T has everyone in town sharing a single 10 megabit line to google or what but it's ridiculous.
greenville,3ajm46,ANewHopeWithKids,2,Thu Jul 2 01:25:31 2015 UTC,Its interesting to hear everyone is paying a different rate for what sounds like the same service.

But it'll be easier with a roommate or two. I live on Woodruff by myself which is about a 10ish minute drive downtown, and i'll be paying the same exact price at my apartment next year, with 1 roommate, and the unit is smack dab on main street."
greenville,3a5rx7,biscuitfool,2,Wed Jun 17 23:10:59 2015 UTC,"I live in The Bristol. It's about a 5-10 minute drive to downtown and about an $8-$10 uber ride. The majority of people that live in this complex are young professionals. They just renovated the pool and it is literally packed on the weekends with people hanging out, drinking, swimming, playing cornhole, grilling, etc. I enjoy it. It's a happy medium between living downtown and living out near Haywood/Woodruff Rd area. The apartments are pretty nice as well."

greenville,39zqt0,hypnofed,3,Thu Jun 18 15:39:51 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow NJ expatriot!  I'm going to go with /u/sheizlegend on this one.  We have a pretty good economy here in Greenville, but a lot of that economy is small, locally-owned businesses.  Charlotte, Raleigh, and Atlanta have tech sectors that we really don't.  If your situation is Greenville or bust and you're sufficiently enterprising, I could imagine you carving out a niche as an independent IT consultant.  Again, lots and lots of small, locally-owned businesses.  These companies don't have an IT division because they might have half a dozen employees or less.  So any IT issues are going to be handled by whoever in the company is best with computers and/or outsourcing the work to Charter or to someone independent.  That said, if you're not an entrepreneur and aren't prepared for the hardships of a small business startup yet this would be a significant risk.  If you do end up here, Greenville to me ""feels"" a lot like the part of NJ around Stockton College- Mays Landing, Egg Harbor Township, etc.  Just with mountains and elevation.  Pick up some apple cider donuts before you come.  I haven't found any around here."
greenville,39zqt0,hypnofed,2,Tue Jun 16 05:01:50 2015 UTC,"Hello fellow New Jerseyan! Thank you for the very helpful response. Its good to know how the economy, life style, ect is before I move down. The limited reviews of the area do not provide that much perspective. However, coming from NJ, you know it was up here and how it is in Greenville. I am going to continue to look!

The limited reviews of the area do not provide that much perspective.   I like the area.  It could stand to have more amenities but I don't feel there's anything significant I'm going without.  Of course, in NJ everyone knows a couple great places in their town and a couple great places in nearby towns.  Greenville is basically a single population center, so you're limited to what's in Greenville.  It's not even remotely the sticks, but it's surrounded by the sticks.  One of the nearby cinemas has an IMAX screen.  Most of all the major national chain brands are here.  There's a really great downtown.  Tons of stuff to do outdoors if you have an active lifestyle.  Myrtle Beach is within vacation distance and is a lot like the shore.  Big population centers within a reasonable drive in Atlanta and Charlotte.  Low cost of living.  Nearby to the Appalachians as well.   We have a Delicious Orchards along with a few farm stands that I can check out.   I miss Delicious Orchards so frikkin much.   Would you like some pork roll as well?   You know, pork roll I do ok without.  We don't have it precisely but there's no shortage of salty pork products in the south.

You're an ass and I will let you know that. Same for on the way home. People will run down the far right lane of 85 until it ends and then cut into traffic.

Lots of people are on their phone (talking, texting, or whatever you can do on smart phones), a lot of people drive 5mph under the speed limit, no one treats the left lane as the passing/fast lane, people block all of the intersections, people don't accelerate when the light turns green, people will cause a crash just to be nice to someone else, no one acknowledges their own right of way to the point of inconveniencing everyone around them, and everyone is afraid of a horn. Honking a horn isn't always aggressive but every time I toot that sucker, someone flips the bird at me.   So for me, that's why I drive aggressively. And again, I am sorry. It could be said that I drove aggressively before I moved here, so there's that.   edit: added a couple things to the list  edit #2:  For what it's worth, SC has tied with Montana as the two states in the US with the worst drivers. source"
greenville,39tu3u,brsheff,11,Sun Jun 14 21:28:27 2015 UTC,I have no problem honking the horn at someone if the light turns green and they don't go in a reasonable amount of time. Especially because 90% of the time they're on their phone and not paying attention. My biggest pet peeve though is when you're on a two lane wide road and there are two cars next to each other going the same speed and way under the limit. Like...have some awareness of your surroundings ffs.
greenville,39tu3u,SorenShieldbreaker,5,Sun Jun 14 22:39:23 2015 UTC,"Not alone! I'm a recent transplant from The Buffalo/Rochester/Syracuse NY region.   As a whole, there seems to be less ""awareness"" of the flow of traffic and cars around them.   Likewise, while I may seem to be driving aggressively, I'm really just scratching my head wondering why you're holding up a line of 10 cars going 50mph in the passing lane.   I'm assuming you're in la-la land and you're going to do something stupid any moment, so I just want to get around and out of your way."
greenville,39tu3u,AdamRK,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:38:50 2015 UTC,Haha. I am from Houston and doing the same thing. People here drive soooo slow. The number of people I have seen goinv the wrong wag on a oneway is insane.
greenville,39tu3u,SexCriminalBoat,4,Sat Jun 20 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"I am in complete agreement with you.  I've lived in many places and the drivers here, in my opinion, are pretty bad (for all the reasons you cited)."
greenville,39tu3u,shuffma,4,Mon Jun 15 03:05:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me that you're more ""assertive"" rather than aggressive. The things you mentioned that bother you are all other people's lame driving that you're having to compensate for.  I'll accept your apology for that. The complaint I have is when someone becomes retaliatory or blatantly rude and then they do something dangerously unsafe, and that doesn't sound like what you're doing."
greenville,39tu3u,nofaprecommender,4,Mon Jun 15 20:47:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not from Greenville, but I've driven lots of places. I'm not sure how you drive, but from my observation, most people are pretty crap drivers. The average person seems to be in a terrible rush but does not really think about how the environment is going to effect travel time; he or she just thinks that stomping on the pedal at all times is the fastest way to get from point A to point B. I see people accelerating all the time when there is a stop sign or red light at the end of the black, or braking on the highway because they accelerated too much and are going too fast or have traffic right in front of them. Whenever you brake, you are wasting gas.  To me, a good driver is one who brakes as infrequently as possible, and to do that you have to pay attention to the road ahead to see what speed you can attain before you have to slow down again. Braking on a fast moving highway is the epitome of stupid driving because it shows how little attention the driver is paying to what is going on. Rather than accelerating at maximum warp throughout the trip, the average driver would save time by using Google Maps or Waze to check the traffic before starting, including on familiar routes. All that excess gas you burn to maintain the illusion of speed also ends up costing more time to pay for later on."
greenville,39tu3u,brsheff,3,Mon Jun 15 21:27:37 2015 UTC,Oh man.  People that use their brakes on a highway make my blood boil.  The whole purpose of the HWY is to get where you need to go without breaking.  You hit the nail on the head.  The people that speed up just to slam their brakes are the ones throwing everyone off.  They make the drivers behind them think that higher speed is fine for them. Then when the first driver needs to brake there's a chain reaction of everyone having to slow down on a HWY.

The best scenario might be a manual control mode that has automatic safety controls built in that take over when a person is about to hit something."

I see people accelerating all the time when there is a stop sign or red light at the end of the black,    Fucking THIS. I never understand the idiot aggressive tailgate-you-then-swing-around-you people who always end up at the EXACT same light you do. It's like this: Traveling cross country? State to state? On a LONG mostly highway trip, you MIGHT be able to cut some time with higher speeds, because it's largely uninterrupted motion.   In town? You just look like a douche, and the time you MIGHT (but probably won't) save can be measured in seconds. If you're lucky. Just fucking relax, or leave earlier.   Braking on a fast moving highway is the epitome of stupid driving because it shows how little attention the driver is paying to what is going on.    Pet peeve. I NEVER touch my brakes on the freeway unless ALL the traffic comes to a standstill, or very nearly. If there's no jam, and you're driving properly, there's never a reason to brake on the freeway."
greenville,39tu3u,crackofdawn,8,Fri Jun 19 04:52:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly there are hardly any aggressive drivers in Greenville.  I feel like anyone who thinks there are a lot must be from here or never have driven in any larger area.  There are a ton of rude drivers through (mostly intersection blockers and red light runners).  I always forget how aggressive drivers can be in other places.  When I go back to Orlando to visit family it feels like everyone on the road is an asshole.  I will agree with the other person who mentioned everyone driving crappy in greenville.  It's super annoying driving here because so many people drive slow in the left lane (especially when they match the speed of the other lane so they're blocking everyone), so many people slow down to an absolute crawl to make a turn, so many people block intersections, run red lights, don't go when the light turns green until it's about to turn yellow, etc etc etc.  I mean overall Greenville is filled with a lot of really shitty drivers, just in the opposite shitty way of most bigger areas.  I can't even count the number of times I've been on woodruff road during a non-busy time, where the speed limit is 45mph and two cars are both going 35mph next to each other blocking everyone behind them."

greenville,39tu3u,CaptainObvious,9,Mon Jun 15 12:09:32 2015 UTC,"Many, many, many of the natives don't realize how poorly they drive. I know Greenville used to be much slower paced, but the reality is that is no longer the case. Many people moving to the area are from places where driving habits are more aggressive by comparison to how things have always been in Greenville. It's not that they are assholes, they are much closer to normal drivers around the rest of the country. My wife and I are perfect examples. She is native and drives slower than molasses in winter regardless of traffic or road conditions. So does the rest of her family. I'm from South Florida. I'm not afraid of the speed limit, passing other cars, or turning while going more than three miles per hour.  Greenville has to come to grips on the fact it is no longer a sleepy backwater. It's a growing and dynamic city. Time to grow up. This covers everything from traffic, to infrastructure, to housing, to social norms."
greenville,39tu3u,shuffma,8,Sun Jun 14 23:32:38 2015 UTC,"I would politely disagree.  I grew up in Connecticut, which is at about a 7/10 on the traffic scale, and the people there were 1000% better drivers despite their reputation as Yankee A-holes.  I've lived here for a decade and it's been my experience that drivers here are oblivious 80% of the time.  They have no idea how to merge, they block traffic incessantly, they sit at green lights so they are the only ones to get through it, they don't turn on red...the list goes on. Ironically, I think drivers from outside the south are consistently more considerate than Southern drivers on average...outside of California."

greenville,39g2ee,kilbus,4,Thu Jun 11 14:50:54 2015 UTC,"I've lived in several cities throughout the South; the weather is pretty much the same everywhere, only once you get out of Florida the winters get ""cold"" (cold by our standards is below freezing a couple days in a row and maybe a little snow here and there). Charlotte has a lot of people, a lot of different cultures, and a lot of jobs. I've never lived in another country so I don't really know what it means to be ""accepted"" into a new culture, but I would imagine a large city like that would be very accepting. Here in Greenville there are a few foreigners, but most of them are German and work for BMW or French and work for Michelin. So there are French people here in Greenville for sure.  Ok so basically Greenville is like this: If you're in Greenville Proper (within city limits), the people are pretty friendly and generally pretty accepting of a lot of different lifestyles. But if you go more than 5 or 6 miles outside of downtown you start running into people who are of a very tight community who don't warm up to outsiders so readily and tend to be quite judgmental. Then if you go outside of that you're so damn removed from everything that it's pointless to live there altogether (no offense TR residents).  Charlotte has so many different parts of town that you can do really whatever you want and there will be some community that you'll fit right into.   Also I should ask, how old are you guys, and are you planning on having a family any time soon? Those are important factors for choosing a place to live in the Deep South."

I'm from West Palm Beach and you literally can not exist without a car. Orlando just installed the Sun Rail recently and will hopefully be extending it to Tampa soon, so that would definitely be a better option. In Tampa Ybor City is pretty much the only place that has a little trolley and even that isn't all that useful."

greenville,39g2ee,kilbus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:27:37 2015 UTC,"The terrible -- but in your case slightly helpful -- thing about Greenville is that people in this area drive very slowly, and very poorly.

I was hoping that by moving to the south I would avoid that as New York is so expensive for everything...I lived in Southern Virginia during college and I couldn't believe how cheap everything was...Honestly I can live anywhere in the USA as I have lived all over the east coast from the ""deep"" south to the northeast...but I am more concerned about my girlfriend....I want her to be as comfortable as possible...Even though she went to college for a year in America, I'm not sure if she is ready for the real ""shock"" of living there permanently....I work in IT..I'm trying to become a bit more specialized before I come back to America...my girlfriends skills are just her language skills unfortunately, but she would do anything for work she just wants to live in the US."

greenville,39g2ee,kilbus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:56:37 2015 UTC,I don't think G'ville is more expensive than Prague. VAT is murder on the bottom line. Southern states are pretty inexpensive in terms of cost of living.

Retracted the whole post. Greenville is easily twice as expensive as prague, at least in terms of housing/food. A draft beer in prague is like 75 cents. A steak dinner is 8 dollars. Decent hotels are 30-40 a night. Also you dont have to have a car which cuts off 3-600 a month."
greenville,39g2ee,kilbus,2,Thu Jun 11 15:00:44 2015 UTC,People talk about Greenville like it's cheap or something. If you live outside of town and drive 20 minutes when you want to go to town it's okay expense wise. If you want to live in town good luck with that. Housing is more expensive in Greenville than both Atlanta and Charlotte. It's probably one of the most expensive cities in the entire southeast.
greenville,39g2ee,allWoundUp357,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:09:13 2015 UTC,"Ummm...what city do you live in? I can't speak for Charlotte but I know tons of people who live in Atlanta and housing here is a hell of a lot cheaper than it is there, at least if you want to be inside the perimeter. I've known people who rented and purchased here and I've done both in places other than Greenville as well and this is by far the cheapest place I've lived. Except for maybe in college, but that doesn't really count because I went to school in a small town."
greenville,39g2ee,scienceasfuck,2,Thu Jun 11 16:05:40 2015 UTC,I'm talking about living downtown. Greenville is super high for a city the size that it is. If you want to walk to anything you will pay for it in Greenville. You can get an apartment in Charlotte within walking distance to things for like $1K. In Greenville it'll be like 50% higher.  For living a life where you can use your legs to go places Greenville is high. I need to make a website where walkability index is compared to cost of apartments to find the walking cost. I have no interest to live in the sticks where it takes me 30 minutes to go to the grocery store regardless of how nice the area is.

As for Thai, there is one restaurant and one alone you should know, simply called Thai Restaurant on Augusta Rd next to a former head shop and defunct fish selling place.  It is a hole in the wall but it's goddamn amazing.  Hit me up if you ever want some friends around here.  The roommate and I do so love this town and love to meet new folk."

And the little I know about Thai food I can say I liked the restaurant Sweet Basil on Pelham road. Walking around downtown and enjoying Falls Park is a wonderful way to spend a day with people from out of town if you're interested!
greenville,39e0sn,katraya,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:17:14 2015 UTC,Yes we'd definitely like to know more about bars! I'm 22 and he's 26 and we're not really into the club type scene like a lot of our friends so its kinda hard to find new places. Is that the park with the bridge that looks like its only being held up on one side? We may have walked around that area today!
greenville,39e0sn,joeschmo1969,2,Fri Jun 12 02:44:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's the bridge! Okay so if you're looking for a casual drink check out Sip. It's an upstairs, outside bar and is a great way to cap a date! My girlfriend and I grab sushi and walk across the street on North Main Street to get there to grab some great mixed drinks or a glass of wine. Reys is a popular bar, but if I had to recommend one bar it would be Jack & Diane's. $5 cover and it's a dueling piano bar where you can recommend songs and they'll play them! Welcome to Greenville!"
greenville,39e0sn,ncshooter426,4,Fri Jun 12 02:56:22 2015 UTC,"As for Thai food, I recommend Thai Jing on East North.

Sadly I haven't been to a Thai restaurant here but I have heard good things about both Sweet Basil and Lemongrass, which I see others have suggested.  Smiley's is usually great for bands. I used to sing in one and we played several places downtown but that was years ago and nowadays, most of them either hire the same three shitty bands over and over again or don't have live music at all anymore :-/ That said, as others have said this is a great time of year for live music because the bands that play at Downtown Alive on Thursdays and at Main Street Fridays are usually pretty good.  If you like baseball at all, check out a Drive game.

greenville,39e0sn,carbonapollo,8,Thu Jun 11 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"Mekong is great for the hole in the wall Vietnamese vibe, otherwise go to Lemongrass in downtown main.    Comedy can be seen at Comedy Zone and Coffee Underground.  Live shows will be plentiful on the weekend, there will be live music on Main Street starting around 5pm on Friday.    Then there will be bands or djs at most bars.  Smileys is guaranteed good acoustic band music, Jack and Dianes is fun dueling piano, Blues Boulevard is an older jazzy crowd, Mojos will have a small acoustic type act.  Don't take your parents to IPA and Radio Room unless they're into the dive bar rowdy scene.  Radio Room is better left to college kids drinking PBR and drug dealers.  IPA is much nicer but still attracts a wilder after-hours type crowd.  Other great food options: Soby's (Southern), Lazy Goat(Mediterranean), American Grocery(VERY GOOD), Rick Erwin's Grill (Steak) and Nantucket (Seafood), Larkins on the River (Filet), High Cotton (Southern)  Source:  Lived in greenville all my life and work/live downtown  TLDR:  I recommend going downtown around 4pm this Friday and walking around a bit, catch the live music in front of the Hyatt on Main and check out some shops and then walk just a block to Lemongrass, a great Thai restaurant."

Instead teaches a more liberal less extreme version. It tells people what they want to hear so they'll think that when they die they all go to some happy go lucky place in order to get more donations. Its a corperized mega church.

It sounds pretty reasonable for that area either way honestly, but if you have two bedrooms you're getting a pretty good deal. It might be a little pricey for a one bedroom but it depends on how new the complex is.  That area is a little more expensive than some others around Greenville.   I'm currently paying 840 for a two bedroom townhouse near Pelham Road but that is only because I got into it before the new management. Now my apartment is going for like 1200 per month.

greenville,37ms7c,CaffinatedLink,-7,Thu May 28 21:40:34 2015 UTC,"Prior to this posting, this has been my plan.  My concern is that, while I know Clemson University is a state inspected facility, somehow the idea of raising all these animals humanely outside on pasture with natural forage to take them to Clemson where some Animal-Vet Science major can pop their slaughter cherry for a B this semester in Poultry Science seems to defeat the purpose of raising them in such great world - seems worthless if that's how the birds go out of that world.  Edit: Punctuation  Edit 2: Clarification - I initially interpreted this statement to be that Clemson could slaughter the birds, because they are a state inspected facility. I have since re-evaluated it to mean that I should call the Dept of Meat and Poultry at Clemson, and to clarify, I have made this call - they are very good at explaining to me that it's complicated, and not as good at answering questions to make other less so. To my understanding, there is no state inspected facility in the state that handles small customer work like this."

As to your thought about the student slaughter, I kinda agree and add thought that  carting them all the way over there might be the more stressful part. I would think that would be the worst part of the experience for them. But then again you could also argue that they're supposed to be for food, not pets.

greenville,37ms7c,Armageddon_It,2,Thu May 28 20:09:30 2015 UTC,"I have read this before when I was trying to learn the difference between a USDA inspected facility and a state inspected facility, but only just now did I read this section:  Exemption for Direct Sales Poultry producers may slaughter on-farm without inspection any poultry products that are distributed directly to household consumers, restaurants, hotels, and boarding houses for use in their own dining rooms or for use in preparation of meals for sales direct to consumers if the products are identified with the name and address of the processor, are not otherwise misbranded and are “sound, clean, and fit for human food” when distributed.  What'd you think?  If Im raising the chickens, and selling them out of my truck, does this law mean I can kill them myself without going through a USDA or state inspected facility?  That seems pretty direct to consumer.  Does that mean, after all the regulation I've read, that if my slaughter house  (household kitchen or garage) is ""clean and sound"" I can do it myself quietly without telling anyone what I'm doing?  Whats confusing is that the beginning of the section refers to ""poultry producers"" who can slaughter their own birds, and by the end of it says it has to be labeled with the ""processors name and address"" which would just be... the poultry producers name and address?  So the rule is... you have to take your birds to an inspected facility where they will slaughter, weigh, and label it for you, OR you can do it yourself in a reasonably clean area, and put your name and address on it?"
greenville,37ms7c,Armageddon_It,2,Thu May 28 21:33:16 2015 UTC,"I've been to a few farms (""producers"") on the farm tour, and from what I can tell they slaughter, package, and label it right on site.   The potential technicality here is that you are transferring it directly to the consumer, via the food truck, so not actually distributing it as a producer (but this is certainly a question for whatever governing bodies you deal with on the farm, and the food truck). The potential way around this is to ensure that the food truck is a separate legal business, and sell the chicken from the farm to the food truck.   It might be worth the $30 next weekend to go visit a few farms that distribute, and talk to them. I know that Happy Critters Ranch sells directly from the farm, and at several farmers markets (including the TR one), and had a process for cleaning chickens right at the farm."
greenville,37ms7c,crushdaddy,3,Thu May 28 23:51:15 2015 UTC,"You have hit the nail on the head regarding the crux of my issue - I dont know what category I'm actually operating in.  Does the state consider me a farmer selling chickens at a farmers market if I am a farmer selling fried chicken on a biscuit, or some sort of egg breakfast sandwich? I understand if I'm going to be cooking on the truck, then I have to be inspected and a business - okay, thats fine - am I not a farmer anymore now, because DHEC inspected my farmer's market stall?  I think that way pretty much all farmers go about doing this is by just assuming that no one is actually going to come check how you're doing it.  The guidelines for a slaughter facility and a labeled package are simple - be clean, and label an airtight package of what it is and what date is was processed.  Every kitchen in america is supposed to have a date and label on every refrigerated item, so thats no different that just being a restaurant/food truck anyway, right?  I guess when I read the guidelines on here it seems to be able to be interpreted in one of two ways. Either I can only sell a chicken in a restaurant (phrased in the document as ""In commerce"") if it has been inspected, OR I can do anything I want as a farmer when it comes to selling to my customers as long as my slaughter area is clean.  Anyone have a second opinion?"
greenville,37ms7c,tossitwhenurdone,2,Fri May 29 00:33:39 2015 UTC,A possible work around would be for you to create 2 businesses. Wicked Good Farms raises chickens and slaughters for sale on their farm. Wicked Good Foods purchases their meat from Wicked Good Farms. Although I don't know if this would settle the inspected birds sold in commerce issue.   Have you tried contacting any of the local farm to table restaurants? I imagine they have already solved this issue. I can't see how your business would compete with something like the swamp rabbit cafe so they may be inclined to help another local business.   Either way I'm pulling for you. I've really enjoyed the food trucks in bigger cities and would love to see more in Greenville.
greenville,37ms7c,chadandjody,2,Fri May 29 14:36:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to respond. The farm to table restaurants aren't raising their own birds, most of them buy their poultry from a place like Poultry Junction, which is a cooperative that represents a number of small producers, but almost certainly those birds make the trip past Columbia to a USDA facility so they can be sold over state lines. Also, those restaurants aren't buying directly from a farmer, because I don't think they are allowed to without them going to an inspected facility.  I agree that it makes sense business wise to have 2 separate entities, but I think it might be questionably legal to sell chickens directly from my farm to my truck, where as selling chickens directly to consumers out of a food truck is seemingly less so.  Based on all the phone calls I've made to varying places trying to figure out what the actual rules are, I've concluded that no one really knows, and more over, no agency is looking to see where food comes from in restaurants. So is what I'm going to be doing legal? Dunno, but I'll be sanitary and delicious, and I hope that's good enough for the powers that be."

greenville,37ms7c,joe9439,2,Thu May 28 21:39:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've watched his videos on processing.  While the state of Virginia (where Polyface Farm is located) is very clear about those guidelines, South Carolina is less so.  And even for Salatin, none of his birds can be sent outside of the state, or sold ""in commerce"" which is the term given by the state for any food that is sold raw to an institution that prepares it.  So far my best interpretation of the best possible answer is a blend of u/graycountertop's ""Just dont tell anyone"" theory, combined with  my own personal interpretation of the Exemption for Direct Sales from the pdf that u/hayshock submited: http://www.carolinafarmstewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/CFSA_RegGuide-SC2012_08-webres2.pdf"

There are also a lot of Hispanic carniceria(s), but alas, I do not speak Spanish and I am not brave enough to try yet without it. Due to this, I get most of my meat from Whole Foods or directly from local farms at farmers markets and local stores due to this. I know there are a few people talking about opening a USDA slaughterhouse/butcher for local meat, but it may just be a pipe dream.  Let me know what cuts are you most often looking for and I can point you in the best direction from my experience so far."

greenville,378u9e,Skeezin,7,Mon May 25 20:37:58 2015 UTC,"I have a few different opinions than the ones posted, so I'll post mine-   Where is a good place to live for less than $1200? With that budget you'll have plenty of options. Downtown would be a fun and exciting place to live, however I live like 7 minutes away and I think it's the perfect place to live haha! It's right by the interstate, mall, and tons of restaurants, plenty is close by without having traffic and noise problems, and much more room than you'd have downtown. I'd suggest looking in the Pelham/Haywood/Woodruff area for apartments. All are pretty nice neighborhoods (in my experience) and central locations. Although Woodruff Road does get backed up. What is single life like for a mid-20's guy? There are tons and tons of opportunities to meet up with people, girls specifically if you'd like. Greenville is such a friendly and welcoming place! Are there places to hunt/fish for the public, since I don't own any land? No idea  Are transplants from Tennessee generally well received by the community, or do natives stick with each other? Like I said, this is a really friendly place. I moved here from out of town as well, and I haven't run into this problem :) actually it seems that people are a bit more welcoming once they realize you're not from here.  I'm conservative and Christian, but don't like these topics when interacting with people. How often do people bring these topics up? Same! In my experience, it's not brought up a ton unless you tend to bring it up yourself. You'll find the right group of people, and they'll respect you and your beliefs :)"
greenville,378u9e,baburusa,3,Mon May 25 23:00:53 2015 UTC,"I've lived in both Knoxville and now in Greenville. Transplants are very well received, and I would pick Greenville over Knoxville every time."

The people are wonderful, the trails are great, lots of festivals and events. Most of these things exist in Knoxville, but just feel more alive here. I know that's not super helpful, but it's what I've got. The other commenters have hit the religious stuff etc. in the head."
greenville,378u9e,jawa-pawnshop,1 point,Tue May 26 00:17:38 2015 UTC,Knoxville seemed more progressive and less conservative so you may like Greenville better.
greenville,378u9e,Rationalizer,2,Tue Jun 2 17:35:53 2015 UTC,"To address the hunting question, there is a good bit of ""Wildlife Management Area (WMA)"" land in the area that is owned by the state and allows hunting.  It just requires an additional license."
greenville,378u9e,crackofdawn,2,Tue May 26 02:00:30 2015 UTC,A huge portion of the Greenville population are transplants.  I hardly know anyone here that is actually from SC.  For $1200 you can rent or buy a 3 or 4 bedroom house depending on the area.  There is plenty of stuff to do here for single people depending on what your interests are.  If the 'club scene' is your thing then Greenville probably isn't for you.  I'm an Atheist and really the topic of religion pretty much never comes up with anyone I've interacted with in Greenville.  I know tons of christians around here but nobody is ever talking about it (from my experience anyway).
greenville,378u9e,gwompki,2,Tue May 26 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"I have never lived in Knoxville but visited friends on several occasions so take my opinion with a grain of salt.  The way I perceive it, Knoxville has more going on in terms of culture (music, arts, good venues, etc) which I would guess probably has a lot to do with the fact that it is a college town.  It is a cool town and I like it a lot.  That said, I love Greenville and would choose here every day of the week.  The downtown area blows Knoxville's out of the water.  Great restaurants, parks, farmers market, festivals, etc.  I think it has something to offer all ages.  I moved here in my 20s when I was single and had a blast.  Now I'm older and married with a kid and all three of us love downtown for different reasons.  I won't go into any of the advantages from a family perspective since you are young and single, but just know that it's a great place to put down roots.  Plenty of fun to be had now as a single person and potential fun for a family down the road if you go that route.    I know I'm kinda trashing the Greenville arts/music scene so let me be clear.  It seems to be steadily improving since I moved here 11 years ago.  We have some great local venues.  An annual music festival that seems to be getting some good regional attention (Hey Look! Music Fest). The quality of musicians playing at our annual festivals gets better every year.  The Pendleton Arts district seems to be booming.  Lots of killer things happening and getting better every day."
greenville,378u9e,WeenisWrinkle,2,Wed May 27 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"Where is a good place to live for less than $1200?   You'll have the pick of the litter for $1,200. Greenville is an inexpensive place to live.   What is single life like for a mid-20's guy?   Decent downtown, meh elsewhere. Lots of mid 20s and mid 30s folks live in the downtown area.  Are there places to hunt/fish for the public, since I don't own any land?  Yes, but I'm not a hunter/fisher, so I couldn't tell you where.   Are transplants from Tennessee generally well received by the community, or do natives stick with each other?   The community has plenty of transplants, you'll fit right in.   I'm conservative and Christian, but don't like these topics when interacting with people. How often do people bring these topics up?   The residents here are generally conservative and Christian. Among young people, that's not really a topic that a brought up I'm my experience. I don't attend church, nor do I really get invited to church functions often. The idea that the city is overly religious is very overblown, IMHO."
greenville,378u9e,aGeekSaga,1 point,Mon May 25 22:17:44 2015 UTC,"You can easily get a great apartment or house rental for under $1200 so long as you don't have like a million pets or anything ;)  Single life is what you make of it. I'm a girl and early 30s so I probably don't have the best advice to give there.  Not sure about hunting/fishing but I know some people and could maybe get you a hookup that would also involve helping you make friends with people who have similar interests :) My brother-in-law is in his mid-late 20s and hunts on the family farm and has permission to hunt on some nearby land as well.  I think transplants are generally well received here, period, but it does depend on the area you live in around Greenville and who you choose to surround yourself with.  I was raised conservative and Christian but do not practice any of that anymore and I don't have any issues at all. My family is probably the biggest culprit of talking about stuff like that...outside of them it's pretty rare to have to deal with it IMO. But again, that's due to the people I surround myself with, I'm sure."
greenville,378u9e,MrKentucky,1 point,Wed May 27 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"They're very similar. Greenville has a better downtown and outdoor activities, Knoxville a better suburbia and bar scene because of UTK if you ask me. Pretty much it."

From everything I can gather, Greenville is just Knoxville but located in South Carolina. Was the state income tax noticeable? Other places I've lived and had a state income tax didn't tax food. Not that it evened out, though.."
greenville,378u9e,altxatu,1 point,Tue May 26 02:13:03 2015 UTC,"I think you may find the dating scene much less formal than DC but somewhat harder to meet people. Less people in general. Tax wise you should find it a hell of a lot cheaper than DC, not sure about comparing that to Knoxville but I would imagine it would be less. My brother lives in DC and hates it. Most ppl I've known to live in DC have not enjoyed it much. Never been to Knoxville though."

greenville,3770er,leespice1,5,Mon May 25 11:53:38 2015 UTC,"I have two suggestions. First, there a ton of pretty cool bars/pubs/eateries tht are awesome for hanging out, grabbing a beer, and meeting new people with a little bit of liquid courage to help you out. Just depends on the vibe you're into.   To piggy back off that, do you have a dog? If not, consider getting one. For sure, its a lot of work, especially as puppies, and if you don't have time for them if won't work. But there are tons of puppies, adult dogs, whatever, at local shelters. And an adult dog will already be easier to take care of. But ANYWAY, the reason I suggest that, is I'm a bit introverted, but when i got a dog and started taking her on walks, to the dog park, eating outside with her at restaurants, she became a great icebreaker. People LOVE dogs, and if you walk them with a smile, people (including adults, pretty ladies, hot guys, whatever you're into, will always stop to talk."
greenville,3770er,madycat123,7,Mon May 25 12:03:37 2015 UTC,"To piggy back off of this, go adopt a dog from the Greenville Humane Society. Then take said dog to their Yappy Hour events (one Thursday a month.) GREAT social interaction."
greenville,3770er,zekebaldinger,1 point,Mon May 25 13:37:40 2015 UTC,"That's also a great idea! We just adopted a puppy from them - they are a great organization. We plan on going to there, as well as the Yappy Hour at NOMA square!"
greenville,3770er,madycat123,1 point,Mon May 25 13:49:37 2015 UTC,"I got a Husky but she is a bit tempermental when meeting new people so she is mainly a house dog,  in time she warms up to people, but it takes a WHILE.  Not sure about introducing another dog how that would workout or how she would take.  Also not really big in the bar scene, guess I heard too many horror storys,  but if there was a relaxed place that I could go to get a drink and either watch a game or socialize I am game to venure to it."
greenville,3770er,madycat123,1 point,Mon May 25 13:47:25 2015 UTC,"If you have a temperamental dog (which i understand, our first dog is that way) if you have a friend that has a dog, you could walk them on a leash close, but not so close they are able to touch, and see how they do. Some dogs hate people but love dogs (or in my case, the reverse). Dogs are just GREAT icebreakers.  As far as bars, I'm a fan of Velo Fellow (slightly hipster, no tvs, some board games, craft beer and craft food, pretty laid back unless they have live music). Carolina Alehouse has 8 million tvs so they show every sport imaginable, a huge selection of beers, the upstairs bar is definitely the way to go...but it can get super crowded. I'd probably go there early afternoon on the weekend, but its a great hang out place, especially at the bar. Grill Marks has pretty good drinks, outdoor seating, beer milkshakes and decent food. sitting outside opens you up to a little more social interaction from people walking by. Bars are ALWAYS going to be worse at night and on the weekends, but at the less crowded times, they can be pretty chill."
greenville,3770er,mkay1911,6,Mon May 25 14:06:54 2015 UTC,"Lmao @ ""slightly"" hipster.  Probably the most hipster bar downtown.   I still enjoy it from time to time."

I've been to the Bohemian as well and that would be my second choice unless you want to go downtown. If you go downtown you can get a great meal almost anywhere."

greenville,36ezx9,rwparris2,3,Thu May 21 03:21:00 2015 UTC,"/u/ihavesixfingers has pretty good taste. I will second Radiolab, This American Life, Invisibilia, Freakonomics, and Serial (who doesn't like serial? It's great! Seriously, if you haven't listened to Serial, start there. Better story than anything on TV last year.) I haven't listened to the others he listed, but I'll be sure to check them out.  They're all really really great podcasts. High production values with interesting and they all (excluding serial) go over varied topics, which keeps them fresh.  Criminal is a monthly podcast mostly about crimes and things surrounding crimes. I wish the authors would delve deeper during the podcasts... they're each ~20 minutes long, but I'm always left wanting more details. I discovered this one after Serial, which spent HOURS on a single crime, so that may have biased my opinion.   The Allusionist features a cheeky British woman talking about linguistics. Very funny, very entertaining.  The Truth has the tag line ""movies for your ears"". It tells short stories (usually ~15 minutes long) like the old radio shows. Most of the stories pretty good, and some are absolutely fantastic.  Home Of The Brave is a fairly new podcast that I'm absolutely loving. It's mostly this guy talking about his experiences in life. He's an amazing story teller.  For music, I enjoy KEXP's live in-studio performances, KEXP's Music That Matters, KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic, NPR's Tiny Desk Concerts, and NPR's All Songs Considered. All Songs Considered is more discussion about music than actual music, but the others have little to no chatter. They all feature all types of music, but there's definitely with a heavy focus towards the various rock genres.  There have been a bunch of threads like this in /r/askreddit, so you may want to check there for ideas, too."

Outside of that, I listen to Welcome to Night Vale, Shut Up & Sit Down's podcast, and occasionally Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me.  I also host and produce Saving the Game, a Christian podcast about tabletop roleplaying games and collaborative storytelling. Sometime this summer I'll be starting another podcast as well with one of the guys at Innroads Ministries, for writers and storytellers of all stripes.  I've been considering doing a separate podcast about Greenville, actually. There's certainly enough going on in the Greater Greenville area that I wouldn't run out of content.

They are going to have to do SOMETHING to make this garage non-jumpable. I know that sounds harsh... Greenville has GOT to do something to keep this (as much as they can) from happening.

Sometimes people who are set on taking their own lives in this manner will be seen by someone as they hop over a high railing or climb up the fence, and this may allow someone to save their life instead. And before you get too high on your horse, I and my family are survivors of 2 suicides ourselves, so let's take it easy on the paintings with a broad brush there sport.

If you do this, make sure you take Tower Rd for the view of Gville near the radio towers, but be prepared to deal with lovers making out, kids smoking pot, and the cops that wanna bust em both.   25 is also nice-good views of the foothills unlike 276 where youre in the hills.

greenville,34vlfq,Kelsig,6,Mon May 4 22:42:42 2015 UTC,"Harvard came out with a big upward mobility study, I want to say last year? I remember reading a lot of discussions about how poorly Atlanta and the Southeast in general had scored. a major component was geographical segregation of high & low incomes which was perpetuated by limited access to reliable transportation. I mean, most cities exhibit a substantial amount of segregation but by providing affordable transportation, individuals from lower income communities are able to travel to more prosperous areas for work. I think the historical race/class disparity in the South probably already sets us behind, but progress might also be impeded by our infrastructure which really only supports individual drivers. the point about a lot of transplants in Greenville especially due to the large amount of industry also seems valid."
greenville,34vlfq,suvanna,9,Tue May 5 12:57:09 2015 UTC,"I wonder if Greenville's fast growth due to non natives is part of the reason for this statistic? In other words, the best jobs in Greenville go to people who moved here. Even if it is people who went to Clemson, Furman, etc but are from other parts of the state or country.   For example, in our medical practice their are 5 doctors and one PA. Out of those 6, only one has lived in Greenville for much longer than 5 years.   They say a rising tide raises all ships, but that's not necessarily true. Sometimes when a city experiences explosive growth, the natives get passed by and don't reap the rewards."
greenville,34vlfq,moby323,6,Tue May 5 11:55:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I also feel like the fact that the city is growing so fast has almost everything to do with this statistic. Creating thousands of engineering and other specialized degreed jobs means that obviously that isn't going to benefit poor families. Pair that with the fact that a ton of people are coming in from other places to fill these jobs, and your ""income mobility"" gets shot down right away. I don't really see this as a very reliable statistic."
greenville,34vlfq,Brobi_WanKenobi,5,Tue May 5 12:32:59 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the educational system in this area isn't really nationally known for its excellence..."
greenville,34vlfq,caserock,8,Tue May 5 17:28:24 2015 UTC,"No, and that may be in part why some of the good jobs opening up had to be filled by people from other areas.   I mean, politicians always talk about bringing high-paying, hi-tech jobs to an area. But what if your residents don't have the skills to do those jobs? Then you are bringing in jobs, but you are also bringing in the workers to do those jobs. In that case there is not going to be much of an immediate effect of the ""upward mobility"" of the locals.  Still, it means the tax base grows, which in turn could lead to a better schools parlayed into a more well educated demographic. But those benefits will be reaped in the long term, not the short."
greenville,34vlfq,moby323,2,Tue May 5 19:26:09 2015 UTC,"I imagine this would apply to cities in general and could amplify some of the unexpected hot-spots in places like Winston Salem and Huntsville as well. But this doesn't translate to the general negative trends across the country (and the south in particular). It also raises a question as to why other places with similar (or greater) influxes of out-of-state talent do not exhibit the same vast disparities: Portland OR, San Francisco CA, Austin TX... even Nashville TN."

I think that's an important factor; maybe thee important factor. Certainly there are exceptions, but it seems like places with a history of exclusion, extraction, and exploitation are doing significantly worse than places with a history of inclusiveness and cooperation. That those places correlate with this map: http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_vault/2013/09/4/BigSlaveryMap.jpg seems incredibly significant.   why Greenville county is bad in particular   There's is almost certainly some inherent noise in the data. As the research states, the county-level data are based on ""estimates"" contrasted with a national average (presumably of more estimates). I poked around looking for the exact data sources and came up empty. I'll assume Census? It's possible Greenville County's estimate was biased by feedback effects, small sample, some aberrant data, or combinations of skews. I'm sure the data is solid from the perspective of broad trends, but I doubt there's that much systemic difference between #24 and #64 or #104. From a data visualization standpoint, I think it's probably better to blur the map rather than draw clear contrasts between county lines. If you can find the the exact methodologies the researchers used, I'd be happy to revise my assumptions if need be."

While the meat and produce isn't terribly great, their prices on staples are incredibly hard to beat.  While they may have a few naame brand items, youll pay more fot them than anywhere else.  The brands they sell are their generic brands, and to be honest, I shop there a good bit and the only thing I've ever had taste awful was their sodas.  For meat, I'd head to a Walmart, and for fresh produce, the Bi-lo at Mills Avenue.  If you ever get in an area of Greenville where there is an Ingles  (Butler Road in Mauldin or Grandview Drive in Simpsonville), they have great prices and wonderful meats and produce.  And if you're ever in Fountain Inn  (there's a Simpsonville location, too, off Fairview Road) Deal Mart on Main Street sells name brand fresh loaf bread (Sunbeam, Captain Derst's, Pepperidge Farm, etc) for $1.25.  They are more of a salvage grocery store, but they often have super cheap but great deals on things like frozen foods, fresh block cheese, canned/frozen vegetables, etc.  Just watch your expiration dates on items.

greenville,34gnnm,destroytheheart,7,Fri May 1 00:57:49 2015 UTC,"Makes sense numbers wise. To the immediate south you're competing against Athens and Atlanta and to the immediate north is Asheville and Charlotte, all of which will draw bigger crowds and have a plethora of venues for middle sized acts. When we had the Handlebar the booker straight up fucking sucked. Rumor has it dude passed on the Black Keys shortly before they became an arena band because he hadn't heard of them. God forbid dude get on the Internet for ten minutes, there not be enough dad jeans in the crowd or they have to reschedule their swing dance night."
greenville,34gnnm,destroytheheart,3,Fri May 1 03:28:21 2015 UTC,"No kidding about the Handlebar. The booking there was pitiful. Nostalgia acts, and when they would occasionally book an indie band, zero promotion. I wonder what ever happened to their ""new venue."" My guess is that was a bunch of hot air in a last minute attempt to save face while they were being evicted."
greenville,34gnnm,Wes627,2,Fri May 1 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there really isn't much to miss or be nostalgic about there. Funny thing is, the few indie shows they had sold out or fared better than I would have expected. I heard they flubbed a handshake agreement that had allowed them to use the Canal Insurance-owned parking lot as well. Wish we had something more in line with The Grey Eagle."

greenville,34atcn,hillbillydan,2,Thu Apr 30 00:50:08 2015 UTC,"That's a great question that I am trying to answer. I've talked to a host of agencies and am not getting a great answer on this. I've been directed to everyone from FERC to one of several state agencies to the counties. Very little official paperwork with plans have been filed and the preliminary maps I have showing the route have a lousy scale. The track for the pipeline could be anywhere inside of 25 miles.   One source said that it's been so long since SC had a new pipeline that a lot of people need to get educated on the matter. And because plans have not been filed anywhere, it's not kicking in any processes where a given agency can/will tell me that they need to do XYZ.   It seems Kinder Morgan has done more groundwork in Georgia, which would make sense. They will have more pipeline there. I do suspect that as more landowners are notified here, we'll begin seeing more informal public meetings.   We'll keep following. Thanks for reading. I think it's an important issue."

I'm not talking necessarily about people in this thread, but I know plenty of people who always talk about how they wish the music scene was better, yet they won't put down five dollars to see ANYONE unless it's somebody that's nationally famous like the Black Keys or something.   Before we get better acts, we HAVE to support the ones we do get."
greenville,349lm9,jdubrow,2,Wed Apr 29 20:48:00 2015 UTC,"While I do agree with what you are saying, I differ slightly on one point.    Before we get better acts, we HAVE to support the ones we do get.    I agree that we need to support the music that comes through Greenville. However, if it is something I just can not stand then I will not go and support it. For example, I can't stand cover bands, country and bluegrass, stupid DJs etc. I will not go and support them because that sends the message that we want more of that.   However, when bands like RBTS WIN, Baby Baby, Roz and the Rice Cakes, etc. come through, I make sure I go and support. I also enjoy going to see bands that I don't know, as long as they don't fall into one of the categories I can't stand."

I called baileys and Twin Peaks and they both estimated that people would start getting there at about 4:30 and that they would be full by 6:30 or 7:00.

greenville,33vn4e,CommieColin,8,Sun Apr 26 01:43:17 2015 UTC,Universal Joint on Stone Ave has a cool half inside /half outside bar so you can get a decent bar crowd.  A plus- great food.
greenville,33vn4e,BottomoftheFifth,2,Sun Apr 26 02:54:13 2015 UTC,Universal Joint is great on a nice sunny day for lunch. good beer selection too. and personally i think their food is great
greenville,33vn4e,money3,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:09:56 2015 UTC,Can't agree with the food opinion. I've tried three time and was terribly disappointed every time. Liquor Drinks are good and cheaper than the beers. Wednesday is trivia starting at 7.

greenville,33vn4e,Ross_da_boss,6,Fri May 15 02:09:46 2015 UTC,Local Cue off haywood road right near the mall. Super chill atmosphere with plenty of games and tvs and stuff. Although I usually steer clear Friday and Saturday nights when it's super busy.
greenville,33vn4e,Mostlyharmless86,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:20:15 2015 UTC,how many pool tables does local cue have?
greenville,33vn4e,money3,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:12:04 2015 UTC,"I'd say at least 8.    Darts, ping pong, giant jenga, board and card games. All of these help the pool tables from getting too crowded...but you better get there early on Friday or Saturday night."

greenville,33vn4e,crackofdawn,3,Mon Apr 27 13:26:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I tend to get on pretty well in all those types of environments. My bar experience is mostly limited to my hipster-ass college in New York and bars in NYC. I'm a big fan of bars with jukeboxes, too. I'm mostly asking for suggestions because I don't know anyone here to give me any and I'd like to try and make some friends ASAP. I'll check out downtown next weekend and hopefully meet some people my own age. Thanks for your help!"

greenville,33vn4e,Darlich,2,Sun Apr 26 17:52:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with all the picks here, local cue, velo fellow, IPA, Pour. You should also check out brewery 85, its a brewery a little bit further out, but a really cool spot. They have a stage in the back for live music on the weekends. The beer is great too."
greenville,33vn4e,acertaingestault,2,Sun Apr 26 18:40:13 2015 UTC,"I personally love velo fellow, addy's, the irish pub, community tap, and universal joint."

greenville,33vn4e,sheizlegend,4,Sun Apr 26 18:56:19 2015 UTC,I second Addy's as a great place to get a drink.
greenville,33vn4e,papajohn56,4,Mon Apr 27 15:32:17 2015 UTC,"I third Addy's, and to clarify, it is on Coffee St.  Get the Rodenbach.  Be happy.  EDIT:  The Irish Pub on South Pleasantburg Drive is also a great indoor/outdoor spot complete with volleyball, corn hole, and grills to cook your own food."

greenville,33vn4e,GeneralGore,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:40:03 2015 UTC,"Addy's is a neat bar, dark and looks like a real bar and not a restaurant.  However, keep in mind that they don't have ANY beers on tap and bottles are not cheap.  Addy installed a regulator system on the liquor bottles, so you always get the same weak pour.  Food is good here, also."
greenville,33vn4e,papajohn56,2,Sun Apr 26 17:24:48 2015 UTC,I'm all about Belgian beers! Thanks for the suggestions!
greenville,33vn4e,GeneralGore,5,Mon May 4 07:52:42 2015 UTC,"If you like Belgian beers, first of all check out Trappe Door on Washington St. Half price bottles on Sundays and tons of Belgian beers. Also Quest is a local brewery on the opposite side of town from you; their beers are all Belgian style and they're pretty good at it if you're into that kind of thing."

greenville,33vmui,RousingRabble,5,Sun Apr 26 01:40:16 2015 UTC,"The problem is paradoxical.. I understand the argument of ""it's a constitutional right to carry, so we shouldn't need a permit for an inherent right"" (and I also understand that interpretation is open to opinion).  But I also understand the problem with letting just anyone run around with a weapon, basic safety and legal training or not.  It's a hard question for me, because while I think anyone carrying SHOULD have basic training, I think the current CWP licensing is bullshit. I took the classes, I passed the tests, but SLED denied my permit over a nonviolent misdemeanor from 20 years ago, with no further legal issues since then. A goddamn nickle bag of pot when I was barely 18 in another state is why I can't carry concealed? Fuck that."

greenville,33uqob,Malvaviscos,16,Sat Apr 25 21:44:14 2015 UTC,"That's a tough question. Not sure I can really say I have a favorite over all restaurant.  For steak and beer at night or a fancy burger at lunch I love Trappe Door.  For sit down old school BBQ it's Mike and Jeff's. But for something quicker I like Charlie's.  Pizza depends on the mood and time of year. Barley's has a great lunch special with some awesome beer choices. Mellow Mushroom is great for hanging out in the winter, again, it has good beer selection too.  For old school pick out your own steak I'd go Peddler, it can be a little iffy at times and this is simple steak. No fancy sauces or spices here.  Stella's does a great farm to table that's also affordable. The hanger steak is amazing.  If you want to spend some $$$$ you can't go wrong with Nantucket or American Grocery.  For some meat with a different flair Sacha's Cafe is a slice of Columbian heaven. The Picada(sp) is meat eaters  paradise.  Love the Cuban gone Banana's at Mad Cuban. Crunchy, spicy, sweet, and oh so good.  I'm hungry, give me a bit and I can probably add more.  Oh yeah Bacon Bros for the food but the service sucks. And Bad Daddy's has a build your own burger that will kill an appetite, can you say batter dipped deep fried bacon."
greenville,33uqob,geekswrath,5,Sat Apr 25 21:30:06 2015 UTC,In 9 times going there I always had great service at bacon brothers
greenville,33uqob,rmkensington,1 point,Sun Apr 26 11:24:57 2015 UTC,I've only had inadequate service there once out of the several times I've been. I don't think that particular waiter lasted too long though.
greenville,33uqob,the_crayon_moose,2,Sun Apr 26 12:36:12 2015 UTC,At one outing the service at bacon bros was lacking. Next visit was great. The bar tenders are top notch.
greenville,33uqob,IronyingBored,2,Sun Apr 26 15:29:02 2015 UTC,"I may have been a little unfair to the service at Bacon Bros but most times I've been the greeter has been slow and huffy, like I was wasting their time. First time I went was with a large group, we had reservations, so I can give a bit of slack for the slow service there. Food was still great. Don't get me wrong I recommend them very highly."
