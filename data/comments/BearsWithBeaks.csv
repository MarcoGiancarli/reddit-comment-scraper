BearsWithBeaks,175r0w,ChainChump,15,Thu Jan 24 01:45:59 2013 UTC,Turtles are not birds! Koalas are not bears! Perhaps you are looking for r/marsupialswithturtlebeaks
BearsWithBeaks,175r0w,Giggibeerbelly,17,Thu Jan 24 02:24:13 2013 UTC,"Koalas may not be actual bears but it doesn't matter where the beak came from. No where in the name /r/bearswithbeaks does it suggest the beaks have to be of avian origins. Hell, I made a bear with a dolphin beak once. Many animal have beak. I put them on bear."
BearsWithBeaks,175r0w,almightytom,6,Thu Jan 24 04:39:42 2013 UTC,"I'll just be pedantic and repeat myself: I would agree if this subreddit was called MembersOfTheUrsidaeFamilyWithBeaks, but it's called BearsWithBeaks. Koalas are also known (regardless of the taxonomical inaccuracy) as Koala bears and I believe this makes them eligible to be part of this great community. Besides, you can't deny that this is bloody hilarious. As for the beak issue, I believe it has already been addressed."
BearsWithBeaks,175r0w,ChainChump,1 point,Thu Jan 24 18:31:14 2013 UTC,Koalas are also known (regardless of the taxonomical inaccuracy) as Koala bears   Not in Australia they're not. Because it's incorrect.
BearsWithBeaks,175r0w,fatdonuthole,3,Thu Jan 24 23:39:36 2013 UTC,"Sorry, I thought I had made it clear.      I am absolutely aware about the fact that it is incorrect: the biologist hidden inside me cringes a little every time I think about the fool that started calling them koala bears... how he could mix up an eutherian omnivorous mammal with a vegetarian marsupial is beyond me... he must have been high.     My point is that despite this, a large segment of the world's population (maybe not Australia's, according to you...) keeps calling them Koala bears.      Having taken this into account we can then observe that this is not the subreddit to debate taxonomy, but rather it's a subreddit to laugh at or be scared to death by horrifying creatures that were extrapolated from Lucifer's anus, and it's undeniable that an adorable creature such as a koala is a very good candidate for such humour (or monstruosities).      Thereofore, does it really matter if Koalas are not actually bears? Imo, it doesn't, but to each his own.  TL;DR Who actually cares? Let's just have a laugh..."
BearsWithBeaks,175r0w,temmex,3,Fri Jan 25 00:10:36 2013 UTC,I am disappointed that this doesn't exist.

BearsWithBeaks,175r0w,bearswithbeaks,3,Thu Jan 24 14:38:47 2013 UTC,"From Wikipedia: ""Although the koala is not a bear, English-speaking settlers from the late 18th century first called it koala bear due to its similarity in appearance to bears. Although taxonomically incorrect, the name koala bear is still in use today outside Australia – its use is discouraged because of the inaccuracy in the name."""
