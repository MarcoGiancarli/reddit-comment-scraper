Everything is month-to-month. You get a key card that grants 24/7 access. Free parking is across the street. They do monthly community events. They have multiple large, open spaces, including a rec area that has free pool, ping-pong, and a variety of board games.  Additionally, Cherokee Street is the best up and coming community in Saint Louis (IMHO). You have a lot of 20/early 30-somethings running small businesses and building a real, organic community independent of any top-down driven city planning. Bars, food places, music venues, coffee houses -- all within a several block walk. To name a few: The Mud House, Little Dipper, Foam, The Fortune Teller, The Whiskey Ring, 2720 Cherokee, blank space, and a bunch of Mexican restaurants."

If you are seeking a diverse work space in addition to a flavorful local community Nebula would be my recommendation. I have been attending events at Nebula for years, and now work in the office as the Space Manager. I was attracted to the space for several reasons. Many of my friends and piers in the community are members. The space is visually attractive and unique and houses a variety of creative businesses and individuals. We make coffee daily for our members. Cherokee Street as a community is bursting with art, restaurants, and night life.  I have been an artistic tenant on the street for almost six years and have enjoyed the experience immensely. If you are curious about us please come and take a tour. It would be our pleasure.

StLouis,3dyhvq,paz1200,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:55:02 2015 UTC,I can recommend T-Rex however there are quite a few options these days. T-Rex is $50 / mo but you may need to account for parking.  Other options besides Nebula and T-Rex include:   Lab 1500 CIC St. Louis Tech Arista   and more ... check out St. Louis League of Independent Workspaces
StLouis,3dyhvq,copywriteher,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:04 2015 UTC,T-Rex looks like it might fit the bill. Does the $50/mo space work for a dual monitor setup or are they shared tables and whatnot? Should I consider the $75/mo package if I need that extra space?
StLouis,3dyhvq,raccoozie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:54 2015 UTC,"I think that the $75 month option is the way to go for a dual monitor setup.

Also I have a completely finished basement wired for power and cat5 every 5' (basically set up for a giant LAN party) that goes 95% unused.

StLouis,3dyy4k,joshuahedlund,4,Mon Jul 20 20:00:14 2015 UTC,See this book. The overwhelming majority of inner-city shootings come from a small number of groups that get into beefs with each other.

StLouis,3dyy4k,somekindofhat,5,Mon Jul 20 20:06:28 2015 UTC,"I'd say we don't have enough details to know what might have prevented this particular shooting. In some cases tougher enforcement of existing gun laws might help. In other cases, maybe stricter gun laws. Better mental health and family counseling outreach. Better public education. Yes, some of these things might take years or decades to make a difference. It may not be feasible to prevent every incident. In general, at least at a national level, crime is already less prevalent than it was even a few decades ago."
StLouis,3dyy4k,nerfdude,2,Mon Jul 20 20:12:41 2015 UTC,I'd love to hear SOME ideas   see sibling comment.
StLouis,3dyy4k,SamwiseHamgee,4,Mon Jul 20 20:52:39 2015 UTC,"Focusing the discussion on race rather than the isolated situation is not going to solve anything. Being black is not why this guy shot his wife. The black guy on the metro  with me didn't also commit this crime, nor did my black colleague. If you believe the race of this perpetrator (I genuinely don't know if you do or not) is a cause for the crime, or if being black is the reason various crimes are being committed, why aren't these gentlemen also comitting crimes? Should we treat them differently?  More white guys have been the perps of school shootings than black guys; do we need to address the white community as a singular being about school shootings?"
StLouis,3dyy4k,somekindofhat,2,Mon Jul 20 21:44:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's blaming it on the color of the guy's skin, I think he's saying there is a small fraction of the population of African-Americans as a whole that resort to extreme violence. I think it's fair to say the vast majority of black people are law abiding citizens and not violent criminals, but there is a subculture that was raised around violence, grew up watching violent acts between family members and neighbors, and it's just become a casual fact of life and appropriate response/solution to an argument.  Drawing the conclusion that all black people are violent is racist. Recognizing that there is a problem with some people resorting to violence within the black community is not. Admitting there is an issue is the first step to finding a solution. Pretending it doesn't exist, burying your head in the sand, or shaming anyone that dares to talk about it by calling them a racist just let's the problem continue to fester."

If it's the first, how do you propose we single out the black community to stop gun violence without ignoring white murderers or including the majority of black people whom aren't murderers? Simply saying black people kill more frequently than other races isn't accomplishing anything other than letting people know that you're aware of data and may or may not group all black people as one community responsible for each other In a larger sample size, white people have committed significantly more genocide than black people. Should we gather all white people, address them as a singular community, and lecture them about why genocide is bad, m'kay?"

He/she should be remembering table numbers to avoid these issues; it's very possible it was a sub-par employee and the owner used this as a perfect opportunity to fire him/her.  If the employee was a consistent performer and had shown no racist inclinations in the past, I do agree he/she should not have been fired."

Note: these are just my observations/opinions.   I'd say the married young idea can go either way, some people I know are married young, others aren't. 50/50 overall. The part about moving to STL I found weird is that the segregation among social groups/where you live/how much money you make/who you know/where you went to high school.... are pretty drastic. Given, I work with a bunch of married people with kids, so its not like I'm hanging out with them. Maybe meeting people through your work will be benficial for you, or other social groups (there are plenty). u/elchip3 is right, most married people live out in the county. There are young and up and coming places to live all around. I'm sure if you want to get more specific, we can help you there. It's very hot and humid here. Not my favorite.

(And to throw people off their game, tell them just the name of the high school you, being from out of town, went to.)  St. Louis is just small enough that most locals will have a passing familiarity with where most high schools are and how rich/snobby/classy/classless the students would be.  We also have a ton of private (many Catholic, many single sex) schools with fairly well defined reputations.  It's the perfect indirect question to use to determine how much money someone had growing up, who they might know, what their attitude might be, and presumably how much money they have now.  That being said, I feel that I hear the question a lot less.  Maybe it's because I'm a little older and it matters less.

StLouis,3drtuk,tdk2fe,3,Sat Jul 18 23:02:21 2015 UTC,"CWE certainly has the qualities you described, but before you decide I would encourage you to look at a few other neighborhoods that also share those qualities:   Tower Grove South The Loop The Hill Benton Park Cherokee Washington Ave   Each of those has a very different culture and sense if community.  CWE seems to be a lot more affluent, and a bit elitist (likely because of the world class medical facilities in the heart of it).  Tower Grove also has a fantastic park, along with a more ethnically diverse palette when it comes to restaurants.  You can also rent a house for the same price as an apartment in the West End.  The Loop is kinda like an STL version of Beal street, and more of a nightlife driven area.  Lots of musical overtones as well, with Vintage Vinyl, the Pageant and Blueberry Hill.  Benton Park seems to be up and coming, something of a tiny Brooklyn of you could call it that.  And it's pretty close to Cherokee, which has a lot more of the dive bar and live band feel to it, with a strong Latino heritage.  The Hill is known for the Italian population and the restaurants, but is more of a middle class neighborhood feel along with being family friendly.  Washington avenue is unashamedly yuppie.  Lofts and rooftop pools, along with being the cradle of the tech startup boom that's going on in the city.  As for the marriage thing, StL has a natural filter of a stigmatised public school system which seems to drive people away who have an interest in starting a family.  While many of your coworkers will likely commute from places over 30 miles away, I can certainly promise that if your not afraid of leaving your house you'll undoubtedly have no trouble landing with a social circle that shares your interests."

I LOVE St. Louis and the Central West End. There is a lot to do here, the living expenses are extremely reasonable, the food is excellent, and Forest Park is a marvel. The people are extremely friendly, and there are a lot of ways to meet people (I recommend looking up St. Louis Transplants, which is a good community of people and helps people relocate).  I can't speak to the experience of women here, but I do get the impression there are plenty of single people in their 20s. Let's just say there are a lot of hot guys running around the park in summer ;)."

StLouis,3drtuk,Ajaq007,2,Sun Jul 19 05:27:41 2015 UTC,"Depends on the person I suppose. From my track record I have seen some types flourish. My perception is that st louis is very clique ish. As long as you have an activity to branch out from, most people do fairly well. If not, it tends to be a bit more difficult that the same setup in some other cities."
StLouis,3drtuk,matthedev,2,Sun Jul 19 07:56:07 2015 UTC,"What people have said about the cliquishness of the St. Louis area is definitely true; I'm a native myself, but I was a geek back in high school and socially a late bloomer, so I've had to work hard to build up a social circle the way the transplants do. A lot of people seem satisfied with the social circle they had growing up and really won't go out of their way to meet new people, especially if you don't know someone they already know. Caring about sports, especially the Cardinals, or at least pretending to care seems to get people far in this city.  As for the singles scene, I think there's a surplus of young men between roughly 23 and 35, especially since, yes, a lot of people do start getting married by around 25 (or at least well settled into long-term relationships). Because of the male surplus, a lot more women have raved about their success with OkCupid and the likes while I know many decent guys who go quite a while between dates.  You'll probably want to check out Meetup.com."
StLouis,3drtuk,elchip3,2,Sun Jul 19 20:01:15 2015 UTC,"Now I've heard mixed things, so I've got to ask: is St. Louis a town where people tend to marry young and have children fairly early, leaving those unmarried feeling a bit like outcasts?  Hmm.  That's tough.  I can only speak from personal experience.  At just shy of 25, I was among the first people I hung out with to get married.  By 28, though, I'd say the majority -- but by no means all -- of the people I hung out with were married.  Those who weren't were generally in long term relationships.  Now at 34, only two people I hang out with are unmarried, but they are in long term relationships.  I did have an upper middle class upbringing.  Certainly in more working class areas, people get married and/or have kids early.  But I wouldn't say everyone here gets married super young.  Then again, people probably don't get married that late either.  Probably kind of in between.  If you move to a remote suburb, you're more likely to encounter married people."
StLouis,3drtuk,Starks_Got_Ejected,-23,Sat Jul 18 21:18:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty much agree with this - just adding my perspective:  To an extent, it depends on who you surround yourself with. I tend to run with a crowd of transplant ~30-year-old young professionals, almost none of whom are married and roughly half are in relationships.   It's also dependent on what part of the city you live/work/play in. Move into an apartment in the CWE and you'll find several singles jogging in the park, at coffee shops and bars, law and med students milling around, etc. Move to a suburb and it'll naturally skew more towards married people. But no, this isn't some small town where everyone is engaged at 20."

StLouis,3drtuk,bigbertha707,-16,Sun Jul 19 02:47:49 2015 UTC,"I moved here from Eastern PA at near to the same age as you, and I have to be honest with you, St. Louis was a breath of fresh air.  It is definitely not perfect like most big cities, but just in the 2 years I have been here, the area around me is unrecognizable from when I first got here.  It is changing quickly and for the better and as long as St. Louis is pumped about encouraging bio-tech and tech start-ups to come here, its just going to bring in more and more young, innovative, and interesting people, single and married.  All the comments I've read so far are true and accurate.  There is still this ""class or group division"" as some people put it, but all of the people I hang out with are not from here and we are from all different incomes and ages.  Most of the people I hang out with are Single Professionals and we talk about how difficult it is to meet people, make friends, especially people you might be interested in dating.  But I have lived in many big cities and it is just as difficult to meet people in places like Seattle, Philadelphia, DC, Dallas etc.  You just have to be willing to put yourself out there a little bit and be very honest about your boundaries.  And the one thing I do like about St. Louis as apposed to the North East is that in general people are very welcoming and nice.  Its not as friendly as say, Texas or San Francisco, but definitely a bit of southern hospitality mixed in there.  Definitely take the job!  I think you will find some great surprises around every corner.  There is always some kind of fair or event going on.  And the BEST BEST thing about St Louis, every event includes great BOOZE!  People here definitely do not frown upon drinking like those Pennsatuckians.  ;-)"

Many of us have been working hard for years to counteract the image that outsider, t.v. news addicted, racists propagate. I've lived in two other cities, both much more cosmopolitan, and StL feels much safer. And the CWE is probably the best patrolled of all the neighborhoods. Statistically, it is a fairly safe city as comparable ones go. That's not to mention how danged beautiful it is."

StLouis,3drtuk,CockIsMyCopilot,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:44:41 2015 UTC,"You keep saying ""downtown"" which is a dead giveaway that you aren't very familiar with the city. Downtown is not interchangeable with ""the city."" Downtown only refers to the area directly behind the arch with all the multi-level office buildings and lofts, which is just a small section of the city as a whole. The people that refer to the entire city as ""downtown"" are usually from the outer burbs or rural areas and aren't familiar enough with St. Louis to know or realize the difference.   Just to show how silly it is to call the entire area of St. Louis City ""downtown,"" Look at how a more typical city is set up. Here's some pictures taken randomly from Google maps of all four borders of Kansas City. How  would people look at you get if you called all the farmland and pastures in Kansas City ""downtown?"" It's in the city, isn't it?  And since you brought up the crime thing, take another look at those pictures. Kansas City is 319 square miles. St. Louis City is nearly 5 times smaller at 66 square miles. And yet, the St. Louis metro area is 506 square miles bigger, has almost a million more people, and a Gross Metropolitan Product (GMP) 104 billion dollars higher than Kansas City. Kansas City, and many other cities, include areas that stretch deep into the suburbs and into rural areas.   What if the local boundaries in St. Louis were similar to that of other cities, and included the suburbs, and even places like St. Charles? It would probably even include where you lived while you were here. What do you think the crime stats would look like if we included all the suburbs around St. Louis instead of just the urban core? They'd probably look similar to a place like Kansas City, which you rarely hear anything about as far as crime.   Also, think about this- do people look at the GMP of just St. Louis city and think ""Holy shit, what an economic powerhouse! Look at all that capital for such a small city! Amazing, everybody invest now!"" No, because they don't look at the city boundaries, and look at the region as a whole. To ignore the rest of the metro area is silly; looking at the entire metro area is a more accurate representation. But to ignore the metro area when looking at crime stats should be just as silly.   Comparing entire metro areas from city to city is a more accurate representation, because fairly arbitrary things like how local governments devised boundaries doesn't come into play. The difference is when people are investing money, they want to have as accurate of a representation as possible. When people write a click-bait article on ""Top 10 Most Dangerous Cities"" who really gives a shit about accuracy."

I checked out CWE, clayton, soulard, and downtown. I drove around CWE and downtown fairly late at night, and while the areas were cute and somwhat populated, I guess they seemed on a smaller scale than what I was envisioning based on descriptions.

StLouis,3drtuk,LostInIowa,2,Mon Jul 20 14:58:49 2015 UTC,"Having lived elsewhere and returned I've had very mixed feelings about StL. It is a sleepy Midwestern city and it has a brain-drain (or creativity-drain) problem as many motivated people leave. You must be fairly motivated so I imagine that could be frustrating for you. It doesn't rival New Orleans, but there is a serious bar and drinking culture here which can be easy for some to get caught up in. And while I don't really see the lack of singles problem, the cliqueishness is unmistakable. It's just not a very transient city so people hang out with the those that they have for years.   On the other hand, I find that when i do make a friend here it is sincere. My personal connections here are close ones. I appreciate that alot. I also really like the lack of density in the city; I find it to be more pleasant and easier to get around. The parks are incredible and the architecture has been preserved through the years, making many parts of the city beautiful with a cohesivee feel.   The city is changing really fast right now; seems like every few days I hear about a new restaurant or interesting development project. And because of its diminutive nature it's a city that one can easily feel like an essential part of and that really improves my quality of life. The affordability means that my standard of living went through the roof when i returned; my place is huge and gorgeous and I can travel more.   Yea StL is a missed bag and I struggled with it for a while, but I'm really enjoying it nowadays.  p.s. When you visited you stayed pretty much in the central corridor. If you come again go South. In my opinion that's where the real people and many of the best restaurants are."

If it wasn't for my education, I would not be in st louis.   I also heard all of the rumors and found them mostly to be true.   Dating is a horror compared to a larger city. Downtown, where I live now, is almost vacant, though I have seen improvements in the last 2 yrs. The majority of the people Ive met in st louis are married suburbanites- this is where all of the money was invested into improvements- the buildings are beautiful but are 30min out. The cwe in the city, while the closest to a young professionals vibe area, will not match that of other cities. If you view it as a small town, this place is great- it's just not going to compare to the resources a large city can provide. The diversity or density of people just isnt here."

You absolutely can have a good social life if you're a transplant, but you're going to have to put in more work.  The high school/clique thing is a legit force here, and it's really too bad. I'm guilty of this myself, I'm closing in on 25 and I still mostly hang out with people I've known since grade school, despite said grade schools being all across the city.  Of two good friends of mine that are 24/25, one is married, one is engaged. I'm in a 3+ year relationship. To be perfectly honest, once I'm totally done with the whole education scam, I'm considering more and more just packing up and moving to say, Boston. Especially if a couple more older friends just drop off the face of the earth by marrying or moving themselves."
StLouis,3drtuk,brokedown,-7,Sun Jul 19 12:37:23 2015 UTC,"Things to know:  . The county is where people go to get away from the ""up and coming"" areas. If your lifestyle accepts living in an apartment in a brick building above a dance studio and next to a bar,  the central west end or these days even downtown will be a solid choice. The negatives are that these areas have higher crime and a fairly steady stream of nonsense (personality!). The people who move the to the county are often families who want to get away from the nonsense, and see the next door bar as a negative rather than a positive.  . The food in St Louis is very, very good. Lots of people move to St Louis and shortly after discover they've gotten fat.  . It's not nearly as much of a thing as it was a few decades ago, but areas around town tend to be cultures grouped together. For example, The Hill is primarily catholic Italians, and you need go no farther to see just how good the food is in St. Louis.  . Downtown St Louis is trying really really hard to not be an awful place. It's so much improved from 10 years ago, but you still have nonsense like a 1% city income tax and  literally the worst crime rating score possible.  . The highway system isn't awful, but there are some real choke points. What part of town is the potential job in? Living nearby can save you a lot of time in the car.  . What do you consider the right age to get married and have kids? I know people who married right out of high school and I know people in their 40s who never got married, the average is somewhere in between."
StLouis,3drtuk,allegiancetonoone,2,Sat Jul 18 22:35:27 2015 UTC,"The crime statistics you cite are refutable; here's a quote:   At least once a year, St. Louis faces a wealth of media criticism and bad publicity when the Washington D.C.-based publisher CQ Press releases its annual City Crime Rankings: Crime in Metropolitan America report. This publication consistently ranks St. Louis as one of the most dangerous cities in America, and the city is subsequently portrayed as such in the media. Though this publication is often quoted by the press, virtually all criminology experts (including the FBI and U.S. Council of Mayors) believe the CQ’s methods to be faulty and its data very unreliable. Scott Morgan, the co-editor of the publication himself, said during a television interview in 2006, “I am stunned if there is a criminologist out there who will support this.”   And there is much more info on the webpage: http://explorestlouis.com/st-louis-crime-rates/"

You might not want to use them to compare against Detroit, but we're not doing that. Equality isn’t always fair: So stealing a car shouldn't count as crime because nobody got hurt? What’s factored out: So staying inside is safer than going outside, and that's somehow more important than how likely you are to be a victim of a crime when you do eventually have to leave your house. To report or not to report: Really? You can do better than that.    That is a pretty bad link to give to people."

The area north of Lumiere is already starting to see a little activity (see Bissingers). Development is finally going again following the recession. What could the private market do there on its own? It costs nothing to wait and see.  I love soccer, but I think the economic benefits are overstated. Most people don't have a pot of special soccer money lying around that they're waiting to spend. That money is going towards other recreational options: concerts, other sporting events, bars, movies, etc... More competition for those dollars just shifts the money around - it doesn't attract much new money to the regional economy. The only new money would come from anyone traveling to STL just for these games. However I don't think that's a significant number and certainly not worth $50 million."

We have a chance to build an attraction here, perhaps a new team, and fix up a dump area and we want to walk away from it. Is it going to fix everything? NO Is it going to be a money maker, I dont know. But what I do know is it will make St. Louis a nicer place to live and visit. There is some civic pride involved as well. It would be really nice to have a nice area by the water almost connected to the Arch grounds people can use.

Or to put it another way, he could do exactly what he's doing in LA.  If he can get a return on that investment in LA, but not in St Louis (at least not without the public contributing all the capital), then maybe we need to re-examine whether this market actually has the capacity to have an NFL team."
StLouis,3dmsno,Dave_the_lighting_gu,2,Fri Jul 17 18:25:05 2015 UTC,the only reason he wants to build in LA is because the value of the team is going to go from one of the worst in football to one of the top 3 or so. Thats a huge amount of value.

Now I understand, sorry for making such an obvious mistake.    To answer your earlier question I look at people's motives to determine how credible they are.  Local businessmen tend to be interested in the local economy performing well.  Maybe if they are personally going to benefit from a government project they might not care, but when they have nothing personally to gain I'm pretty convinced they don't want the government to waste money.  The governor of a state, particularly when he's on the way out of office, wants to leave a good legacy.  The Mayor of a city typically wants to have a good economy etc.  John Oliver's interests are 1) making people laugh and getting attention in the media and 2) promoting his political agenda.  That doesn't make Oliver evil, he just isn't very credible in this case.  Heck he didn't even look at our situation in depth, he was just making a generic argument.     If the construction company that was going to build the new stadium was out there saying this was an awesome idea and many other local interests thought it wasn't then I'd be more skeptical.    Not everyone in government power is an idiot or corrupt.  If you take the John Olivers and Bill O'Rileys of the world as gospel you aren't going to have a reasonable position.  They both probably think they're fighting to make the world a better place, but in the end they are both entertainers first.  There's a reason people with reasonable arguments don't get on TV much.

If we're going to build a St. Louis stadium with public money, we should at least build it in an area that has potential to become an entertainment destination and potentially see improved public transport.   Fenton is a nice city, but does it have the bars/restaurants/infastructure necessary to support a 75,000 person influx on Sundays? What happens during the off-season? This new stadium would have local businesses nearer to Blues games, Cardinals games, concerts, casinos, etc. thus giving any news businesses which arise with the stadium a better shot at financial viability."

StLouis,3dmsno,coachkler,2,Fri Jul 17 18:13:33 2015 UTC,"Flat-out cannot.   The Fenton site is a prospective candidate for a relocated National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, as well as North City, South County, and Mid-America Airport/Scott AFB. Their contingency plan is already determined: a family-oriented entertainment development to be centered on a minor league hockey facility designed in the same format as the old Saint Louis Arena on Oakland. Anyways, moving it all the way out to Fenton would negate the financing on the existing EJD bonds. Perhaps most importantly, Steve Stenger had previously stated that he wants to have no involvement in this process other than to sit it out, including the potential for any County funding towards the new stadium. Governor Nixon dismissed him from the decision-making process months ago. There goes anything Rams going into the County."

StLouis,3dnvsh,doctorsound,3,Fri Jul 17 21:13:30 2015 UTC,"So is the MTC really interested in ""public safety"" , or preventing competition from some of it's board members (Owners of local cab companies)."

StLouis,3dnvsh,alcashmoney,2,Fri Jul 17 21:29:19 2015 UTC,"Clearly there are some on the MTC board that do not want Uber to operate. But, Taxi owning stakeholders only make up 3 of the 7 members, so they don't hold a majority. Their intention is public safety, and we've seen gaps in how much ability they have to enforce that (in the case of Domain and Harris Cab at least). Obviously, that's the accusations being made though, that the MTC is protectionist. But, MTC has been pretty explicit that they'd allow Uber, provided they comply with the state laws they're charged with enforcing."

StLouis,3dnvsh,carpedonnelly,-2,Fri Jul 17 21:12:17 2015 UTC,"The MTC's position is pretty simple:  Appear to be relenting on the inconsequential stuff they claimed was important like drug testing and insurance (which Uber is more than sufficiently maintaining, and they know that) so that they can lean on those when they refuse to relent on the background checks and fingerprinting, citing ""state statutes.""  This isn't rocket science, but it will be enough to keep the anti Uber folks happy with a talking point (Uber doesn't care about rider safety, they do this in other cities, etc etc), and it gives them a way to attack the pro Uber group by saying they have been more than accommodating, agreeing to 14 of their 15 points, but they cannot meet them on this.    This is the wall that they are building leading to the 29th."
StLouis,3dnvsh,carpedonnelly,4,Fri Jul 17 20:21:48 2015 UTC,"not sure why you put ""state statutes"" in quotes.  they linked the statute and it clearly says fingerprints are required (that's what ""shall"" means in legal terms).  I'm not sure MTC has the clear right to delay that, and I don't know who's supposed to enforce it, but that's on MTCs head, and at worst Uber would have to cease operations if that got challenged."
StLouis,3dnvsh,chrwei,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:36:11 2015 UTC,What has Uber done to be accommodating to our laws? Why is compromise a one way street?
StLouis,3dnvsh,doctorsound,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:24:55 2015 UTC,"unlike lyft, they've kept drivers off the roads, and provided all the requested documentation.  why does there have to be compromise when changing laws?"
StLouis,3dnvsh,chrwei,2,Fri Jul 17 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"I see statements like /u/carpedonnelly that make it seem like MTC is stubborn for only compromising on 12 points, but not 3 more. Meanwhile, Uber hasn't compromised on any of their demands.  If the laws are bad, then they're bad, and they should be changed. But let's not blame MTC for not compromising, when Uber hasn't."
StLouis,3dnvsh,doctorsound,0,Fri Jul 17 21:12:50 2015 UTC,"Meh, I couldn't care less about Uber making concessions, if I am being honest.  They have no incentive to do so, outside of operating in the city quicker.  As Uber has shown, public perception and the court of public opinion and the like has done more to bend the MTC than anything Uber could accomplish by acquiescing.  And really, as someone who thinks the MTC should be abolished entirely, I am more than willing to watch them rot from the inside out the longer they delay what the public wants.  In this instance, I don't really see the point of Uber backing down from their 15 points.  They are totally winning the perception battle, to the point that state legislators have told Ed Domain that they will be working in the next general assembly session to neuter the MTC and their ability to delay Uber and Lyft.  Do I think Uber will be allowed to operate after the 29th meeting?  To be honest, no I don't, but if we can wait a year+ for the service, what is a few months while the state government more or less disembowels the MTC?"
StLouis,3dnvsh,carpedonnelly,3,Fri Jul 17 21:25:12 2015 UTC,"You're right, Uber has no incentive to do so. They've done a fantastic job of marketing themselves as the little guy, being oppressed by St. Louis and the MTC. Any concessions they make would hurt their bottom line.  Uber could be allowed to operate after the 29th, as the MTC has stated, provided they comply with the background checks.  Over the last year, I've become less and less convinced that the MTC is necessary. But, at this point, they're still doing what they're legally obligated to do, and have made as many concessions as they're legally able to do in order to allow Uber."
StLouis,3dnvsh,doctorsound,-2,Fri Jul 17 21:30:18 2015 UTC,bad laws don't get changed unless someone challenges them.  isn't that was Uber is doing?
StLouis,3dnvsh,chrwei,2,Fri Jul 17 21:25:26 2015 UTC,"No, Uber's saying they don't apply to them. Uber has made no proposals to change state laws, at least that I've seen. Uber has only put out statements that MTC/St. Louis is blocking them."

The only negative is that they didn't allow reservations on the blower, so you just have to hope it is there when you need it.  I'm sure you can DIY fiberglass, too, but it's more expensive.

I'm not sure if I'd use the same product or vendor again, I'm not unhappy with it, but it's still quite hot up there, even after having larger vent and return ducts added.  also, if the roof is plywood, I wouldn't do it.  plywood does have to replaced occasionally, and it would destroy the foam unless they do some kind of barrier which would likely be difficult and take a ton of labor.  mine's ~100 year old 1"" wood planks, those aren't going anywhere ever :)"

StLouis,3dmm1h,wuuza,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:08:53 2015 UTC,Yes I have done it to my house and my parents' house this past spring. HUGE improvement; it has reduced the attic temperature by at least 10-20 degrees and the AC cycles intermittently now instead of running constantly. My garage doesn't even have insulation other than the radiant barrier and it is cool as a cucumber in there while all the neighbors have their door propped open and are roasting like rotisserie chickens.

I couldn't afford that at all. But luckily my wife and I qualified for CareCredit so we got a year to pay it off before interest kicks in which is amazing. Go to CareCredits website and apply--they'll tell you immediately if you qualify. Then you can make monthly payments. And for wisdom teeth only, won't be that bad. Good luck. I know your pain.

My girlfriend came home a few minutes after it went in the oven and instantly knew what the smell was. The California ""provel"" tastes exactly like St. Louis provel according to her and even became the gelatinous blob she loves. Even found a Boulevard beer to have with the pizza!  Lessons learned:    When you think you have rolled the dough too thin, keep going.  Learn how to read more complex recipes and don't rush it even if you are trying to surprise your SO.

You can tell yourself that you'll have time to chop the shallot later, but the next thing you know the meat's out of the pan and you're ready to brown the shallot and your shallot's not chopped and now you've burnt your fond. Read the instructions at least once, preferably more than once, before starting.  You don't need to know the entire thing by heart, but you should have a general idea of what's coming.  Otherwise you'll dump all your olive oil in a rush at the beginning, when the recipe clearly said in step 1 to reserve a portion of the olive oil for a later step."

I like it, and it certainly ""scratches the itch"" (so to speak), but it's not quite there. The crust is thin, sure, but it's dry, a bit too bubbly, and is usually charred, which it shouldn't be. It's almost like it's trying to be a fancy version of STL pizza, and STL pizza is never something that I think was intended to be fancy.  Having said that, it's definitely worth a try. I do like that Tony's pepperoni has a natural casing, so it curls up like little salty cups of grease.  Nowadays, I visit STL once per year and get Imo's and Stefanina's (I'm a St. Charles County boy) when I'm back. Also, it helps that T-Ravs are somewhat accessible here. Many places in SF carry toasted ravioli, but they call them ""fried"" ravioli usually.

Still not okay with Harris Cab operating for the failure of ""following the rules"" that they are trying to force unto Uber and hiring incompetent and dangerous drivers. But that's just my opinion."
StLouis,3djawa,haharrison,6,Thu Jul 16 21:46:26 2015 UTC,The blog post in question  http://stltaxicommission.com/setting-the-record-straight-stl/
StLouis,3djawa,if_man_is_5,3,Thu Jul 16 20:44:59 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed that MTC has been so quiet about this for so long, but from the sounds of it, MTC has conceded on 12 points, is considering conceding on 2 more, and want to investigate the final point, background checks further. Suffice to say, I think MTC and Uber can come to an agreement."
StLouis,3djawa,doctorsound,3,Thu Jul 16 22:03:04 2015 UTC,"The issue wasn't that MTC refused to even entertain UberX, only that they were lawfully bound to uphold these checks. I'm glad they made this move to explain their position in more depth. Hopefully the PD can get back to MTC soon about the background checks."
StLouis,3djawa,FivePrecepts,0,Thu Jul 16 20:39:07 2015 UTC,"Probably not going to mean anything, sadly."
StLouis,3djawa,ManchurianWok,3,Thu Jul 16 19:52:17 2015 UTC,I'm cautious optimistic that Uber and the MTC commission figure this out.
StLouis,3djawa,alcashmoney,3,Thu Jul 16 20:03:33 2015 UTC,"This sounds like some sort of compromise was arrived upon.    The commission believes it has discretion in the timing of fingerprint scans, but also says it knows that state law ""does not allow us to waive the requirement altogether.""   This almost reads like they agreed to try to figure out how they could let that slide and still stay within the state law.  Edit, from that blog post:   . MTC will consider the company’s certification of drivers, and as we do today, issue preliminary driver permits pending fingerprint scans at a later date.   Yeah, this reads like ""we'll let them drive now with alternate background checks, and not require the fingerprints until the legislature either removes the requirement or declines to do so."""
StLouis,3djawa,if_man_is_5,3,Thu Jul 16 20:38:30 2015 UTC,What did Kansas City and Columbia about this law? I would think we could do the same.

This is lunacy!"

StLouis,3dkhuo,artbiocomp,2,Fri Jul 17 11:37:40 2015 UTC,"When I was in Junior High we took our 8th grade field trip to Six flags and my friends and I went on castaway. We were being really rowdy being a pack of boys and even throwing gravel.  We get to the end of the ride and its a miserable rainy day in the park and three security officers in long yellow raincoats block our exit and escort us to the six flags holding tank without telling us why. We spent hours in the concrete cell without anyone telling us a thing and our principle and my social studies teacher occasionally looking through the window and just shaking their heads. I remember telling our class principle, sincerely, to ""not worry, we will be found innocent, I believe in the system"" to which he angrily replied, ""dont make sarcastic jokes to me when you are in trouble like this already son"". It was finally my turn to be interviewed by the police officer that had been pulling us out one by one. I was eager and earnest and asked/demanded to know why were were being held. By this time the buses and all the other kids from school had long since gone.  The police officer at first wouldnt tell me but instructed me to just answer the questions. Finally, after i kept pressing, he quipped that one day I would grow up to be a lawyer and that an employee had seen us get out of the boat, throw the concrete alligator into the water and destroy many of the dioramas, shutting down the ride and jamming the tracks. Sure we had been rowdy but we had done none of those things. Finally we are all released to our parents after something like 8 hours in the cell. I tell my parents what happened and somehow this time they believed me and I was pretty sure the police officer had also kindof. Six flags offered us a settlement of 850$ per person for damages but I refused to take it. There were 9 of us and everyone but me settled. I actually hired a lawyer and my parents explained I would have to pay using my savings that relatives and friends had given me over the years which was around 1800$ which at the time was a huge amount of money to me. The case lasted for two years and two court appearances. At the end of the two years one of the employees was called to the stand and asked to identify us and said simply, ""those arent the kids I saw"". We had won. All my savings were spent but it was very satisfying to my budding teenage ego that I was able to stand up against this company and clear our names.  Shortly after I believe they shut down the ride or converted it. Im not sure if it was related to this incident. Later found out 4 kids from school who were in the boat behind us were trying to outdo our rowdiness and were probably the ones who destroyed the ride."

StLouis,3dfx7t,SoulardSTL,4,Thu Jul 16 00:06:02 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity....how much does each person pay to the zoo each year in taxes?
StLouis,3dfx7t,bosnak_10,17,Thu Jul 16 02:37:58 2015 UTC,"Its paid for by the Zoo-Museum District Property Tax  Zoo = $0.08 per $1,000 valuation Art Museum = $0.08 Science Center = $0.04 Botanical Garden = $0.04 History Museum = $0.04 TOTAL = $0.28 per $1,000 of value  On a home worth $200,000 that's $56 per year."
StLouis,3dfx7t,ilsotus,5,Thu Jul 16 03:24:35 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks. Found the 8 cents but wasn't sure how it was calculated !"
StLouis,3dfx7t,bosnak_10,3,Thu Jul 16 03:48:34 2015 UTC,"But it's a percentage of assessed value, not appraised value.  In my experience, a house is appraised at several times its assessed value."
StLouis,3dfx7t,elchip3,2,Thu Jul 16 11:52:10 2015 UTC,"What does that mean? The appraisal is what a bank uses when you purchase it, right? How is the assessment different?"
StLouis,3dfx7t,jonlucc,4,Thu Jul 16 12:29:00 2015 UTC,"Appraisal is closer to reality.  The house I recently sold was assessed at $27,270, appraised at $143,500, and sold for $165,000.  Appraisal is reflective of what the house is actually worth to sell.  In St. Louis City, residential assessment is actually defined as 19% of appraised value.  And taxes are done as a percentage of the assessed value."
StLouis,3dfx7t,elchip3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:33 2015 UTC,Good information; thanks!
StLouis,3dfx7t,jonlucc,3,Thu Jul 16 14:41:14 2015 UTC,The assessment is usually done by your local government that charges you property taxes. The appraisal is done for the bank.
StLouis,3dfx7t,acepiloto,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:32:22 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks. Why do they vary so wildly?"
StLouis,3dfx7t,jonlucc,2,Thu Jul 16 13:42:31 2015 UTC,That's an answer I don't have. Just have experience with it being a homeowner.
StLouis,3dfx7t,acepiloto,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:54:27 2015 UTC,"That's right, thanks for the correction."
StLouis,3dfx7t,ilsotus,3,Thu Jul 16 14:46:39 2015 UTC,It is taken from property tax. I think the average is around $15 per house.
StLouis,3dfx7t,ticket2win,2,Thu Jul 16 03:15:11 2015 UTC,also is it just city taxes or does county throw in for it to?
StLouis,3dfx7t,wellitsbouttime,5,Thu Jul 16 02:46:48 2015 UTC,"County does. I pay around $30/year, I think."
StLouis,3dfx7t,yawetag12,18,Thu Jul 16 03:19:54 2015 UTC,"See, I have to make this comment. As a non-native with a very noticeable accent that everyone asks about, I often get asked by incredulous people ""Why St. Louis?"" or ""How did you end up here?""     This. This is the reason; St. Louis has some of the absolute best free entertainment and day outings of any city I've ever visited or lived in. Yeah, I've lived in London... big deal. Most of the stuff that is fun to do there costs money, sometimes lots of it. I love being able to take my son to the zoo and just walk around for hours with the only cost being the gas I used getting there. I also love that it's a pedestrian only zoo.    But that's not all. There's so much free stuff to do, so much going on. I can't count the number of times I've gone to the art museum on a whim... or the science center. Not free, but minimal cost for sponsorship and donations are wonderful things like Shakespeare in the Park... yeah, they're all a bit focused around Forest Park... but why not? Hell, the Muny is awesome as well now I get into it. This is a reason I'm moving to Compton Heights...    ... but honestly I'm almost as incredulous with some of these people who have lived here their entire lives. They really don't realize how good we have it in St. Louis. It's a nice city with an incredibly diverse and interesting population. There's a wonderful history and a cost of living that (for the benefits) seriously can't be beat. It's been an incredible place to raise my son, and I don't think I could've picked a better place.    I could've made more money elsewhere, yes... and yes my life would be quite different elsewhere. But I've made good money and had a quality of life that I don't know I would've had in London for example.    Sorry... rant mode off :)"
StLouis,3dfx7t,Sinister_Crayon,3,Thu Jul 16 15:39:24 2015 UTC,I also love that it's a pedestrian only zoo.   Are you saying there are zoos that cars can drive around? Isn't that like a safari?
StLouis,3dfx7t,IRAn00b,16,Fri Jul 17 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"I've said this a million times, and I'll say it a million more... THE SAINT LOUIS ZOO SERVES BEER. That is all."
StLouis,3dfx7t,bentonvilliken,13,Thu Jul 16 04:53:52 2015 UTC,And it's cheap. $5 for a 24 oz. Its one of the cheapest bars in Stl.
StLouis,3dfx7t,Karmatsocheff,9,Thu Jul 16 07:24:10 2015 UTC,"My only real regret is that none of the 1904 building were saved. But yes, the STL zoo is a must see whenever we make the trip there."
StLouis,3dfx7t,MattAdams53,12,Thu Jul 16 01:38:00 2015 UTC,In flight cage was saved.  Are you certain none of the animal houses on the hill aren't from the exposition?
StLouis,3dfx7t,LLv2,3,Thu Jul 16 01:47:09 2015 UTC,The houses are all later.  1920s-1930s
StLouis,3dfx7t,MattAdams53,4,Thu Jul 16 01:47:59 2015 UTC,The Zoo didn't exist until like 1910 and even then it was mostly just pits and old barns.  It wasn't until a bit later where it actually became more developed.  The flight cage wasn't even part of the Zoo it was for the World's fair and later acquired.
StLouis,3dfx7t,ticket2win,3,Thu Jul 16 03:21:07 2015 UTC,"It was built on the site of the World Fair. I was talking in general.  I'm a fan of historic architecture and wish STL would have saved at least some of that for future generations. From what I have read, within twenty years, most of what was built for the fair was gone."
StLouis,3dfx7t,MattAdams53,3,Thu Jul 16 03:24:10 2015 UTC,"I think the major issue with the buildings from the World's Fair being gone is because they were only built for temporary use, so built poorly with shitty materials. However a lot of historic buildings in Midtown were built for the world's fair."
StLouis,3dfx7t,Wm_TheConqueror,5,Thu Jul 16 04:10:37 2015 UTC,Staff (building material) is the temporary reinforced plaster that most of the world's fair buildings were covered with.
StLouis,3dfx7t,brickandtree,2,Thu Jul 16 12:07:12 2015 UTC,"Even the Apotheosis of Saint Louis, the statue in front of the Art Museum, was meant to be temporary. It was one of many statues throughout the fairgrounds and was originally made out of plaster but it became immensely popular because it's where people would meet up when visiting the Fair - ""meet me at Saint Louis"" - the same way we say ""meet me at Stan"" when going to Busch Stadium. After the fair they had it recast in more permanent materials which is what you see today.   Before the full size sculpture was made there were 3 models made. Only one has survived, it's behind the bar at Vin de Set. The building owners found it in the attic when they started doing renovations. The building had been owned by one of the Fair financiers."
StLouis,3dfx7t,Onfortuneswheel,2,Fri Jul 17 13:24:10 2015 UTC,"The art museum and lagoon in front of it were built for the fair. Brookings Hall on the WashU campus actually predates the fair by a couple years, but it was used as the administration building."
StLouis,3dfx7t,girkabob,2,Thu Jul 16 14:23:23 2015 UTC,"Most of the buildings for the 1904 fair were temporary structures and were never supposed to remain there permanently, only for the duration of the fair. Those were demolished. However, some permanent structures were built, as you know, and still stand today (ie Art Museum)."
StLouis,3dfx7t,damien_shallwenot,2,Thu Jul 16 16:28:18 2015 UTC,"Huh... I guess it has been a while since I researched it, but I thought... Huh, I guess I don't know St Louis like I thought I did.  Now, I'm really impressed that the building wasn't abandoned at some point in its 100 years. (Like the Union station in STL or KC)"
StLouis,3dfx7t,MattAdams53,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't know about this until I got curious while reading Eric Larson's Devil in the White City last year. I was wondering why most of the buildings were demolished after it took years to build them. It took a while to find the information. I'm on mobile but there is a website that has a ton of info on it. I think it's called something like ""The myths and legends of 1904 St. Louis Fair""."

StLouis,3dfx7t,MattAdams53,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:42:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the one! Not sure if I got the information from there or another source but it said that the buildings were made from some type of hemp and wood material."
StLouis,3dfx7t,damien_shallwenot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:51:52 2015 UTC,I believe that they have fragments of several of the WF buildings in the Missouri History Museum. All of the stone looking exteriors on the buildings were plaster of Paris.

If I had to pick one word to describe it, that word would be underwhelming. It's extremely crowded, both because it's the mother fucking San Diego Zoo and because everything is crammed together (compared to st Louis zoo). The most interesting animal activity I saw was a giraffe licking at a metal plate in its pen. Cover it in that exorbitant cost, and all I got was disappointment of my expectations. I mean, yeah, it was a zoo so still fun anyway, but I would go back to the St Louis zoo instead every single time."
StLouis,3dfx7t,someredditorguy,6,Thu Jul 16 12:03:44 2015 UTC,I went to the zoo a few weeks back on lsd it was an amazing experience! I love our freaking zoo

StLouis,3dfx7t,madmaddmaddie,2,Wed Jul 15 23:25:35 2015 UTC,I haven't been in a few years. Is it still best to get there early in the morning to avoid big crowds?
StLouis,3dfx7t,HereHaveAName,3,Thu Jul 16 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"eh. depends.  School children during the school year are there right when it opens and usually stay until about 1 or 2pm.  During the summer, the hours are until 7, so if you wait until the afternoon, the babies and young children tend to trickle out around 3/4pm.  The upside of getting there early is parking availability."
StLouis,3dfx7t,carpedonnelly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:16:09 2015 UTC,"You're close on the hours.  Open until 5 Monday through Thursday, until 7 Friday, Saturday and Sunday."

And free.  Although I did get to see two tortoises fucking, and a buddy of mine sexually assaulted a bronze statue of a gorilla. Guess that was worth the price of admission."

StLouis,3dfx7t,_ruinr_,3,Thu Jul 16 20:42:29 2015 UTC,And $14 is relatively cheap admission compared to some of the others on the list!

We packed a picnic, parked in a free spot; the adults bought beers at the zoo and we got some little things from the gift store for the kids.

The San Diego Zoo would have been $300 for everyone to just get in, even with kid's prices and the littlest one being free. wtf."

StLouis,3df1pu,offeringToHelp,6,Thu Jul 16 18:38:51 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm not thinking too well but beyond the general regulations all businesses comply with I'm not sure why Cabs need any additional regulation beyond:  1) Insurance Requirements 2) Some sort of background check on a driver before he's allowed to drive people around 3) Occasional inspections on the vehicles themselves.  I'm not sure why we need a taxi cab commission any more than I'm not sure why we would need a truck driver commission.
StLouis,3df1pu,BrotherClaret,5,Wed Jul 15 21:41:50 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, your first two are two of the points in question.  State law (and by extension, the MTC) wants drivers to carry commercial insurance, Uber claims their insurance satisfies this.  State law/MTC states drivers must get a fingerprinted background check, Uber states their background check is sufficient.  My issue is, if we determine that Uber's background checks and insurance are sufficient, do all transportation companies get to have these rules where they can say their own requirements are ""good enough""? Or, will ridesharing have an exception, giving them a competitive advantage over taxis? I'm not sure what the answer is."
StLouis,3df1pu,BrotherClaret,4,Wed Jul 15 22:09:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, and I do think its kinda funny that there are a lot of people that looooooove regulation of other businesses but that are really interested letting the businesses they like do whatever they want.  (You guys know who you are). Like you I'm a bit skeptical of an out of town company showing up and saying they need not comply with the law or the law ought to be changed for them.  But, as someone who really has no dog in the fight, my main thing is I just don't see why this sort of regulation is left up to some specialized body."

StLouis,3df1pu,BrotherClaret,2,Wed Jul 15 21:58:29 2015 UTC,Actually.......that's my point.  Trucking is heavily regulated but there's no trucking commission.  (that i know of)
StLouis,3df1pu,pbrunts,2,Thu Jul 16 00:08:39 2015 UTC,"Trucking would be more difficult though as it, by definition, requires trucks to travel into and out of our area. Plus, regulations specifically for our area would be a violation of Congress' commerce clause power.  The difference is that taxis are specifically for the St Louis area. And they pick up passengers. So, any issues with how the passengers are treating only affects our areas and creates a very important reason for stronger regulation."

Anything. The MTC, a reformed MTC, could allow for some kind of domestic (St Louis domestic) competition against the massive multinational near monopoly that is Uber, the massive multinational near monopoly getting deservedly horrible press basically everywhere they operate, and will operate, as a monopoly, indefinitely. Let people use their own cars, let somebody come up with an insurance scheme for independent commercial drivers who pass drug tests and fingerprinted background checks- the stuff that Uber is literally too disinterested in St. Louis to agree to since they don't want any boots on the ground, i.e. the expense of any ""employees"" or a brick and mortar office here in town. Which is how little they care about here. We're that one major city without X or Y in 1989, encircled by K-mart or Blockbuster Video.

We were trying to get to the east side to go to a strip club for a bachelorette party (because the party we were having was boring and the bride wanted to kick it up) and it took 45 minutes for the cab to get to her house (we're in South County, but still. It takes like 30 minutes tops to get anywhere in STL during non-rush hour). And when the driver got there, and we told him where we wanted to go, he was all, ""oh, I don't have enough gas to get to Centreville!"" So we had to go to the gas station. We went inside to buy alcohol because we weren't drunk enough, and he lost his keys :|  Took him like 20 minutes to figure out where the hell they were, then we finally got on the road.

StLouis,3deh0o,chrwei,4,Wed Jul 15 18:12:06 2015 UTC,They use Square.  It's very lightweight in transaction fees.
StLouis,3deh0o,Sobie17,15,Wed Jul 15 18:15:37 2015 UTC,"From what I read, the MTC forces them to use certain processing companies -- about 7% of the fare vs 2% or so for square.  This way, the MTC probably gets some kickback from the extra fare/commission the CC processing company gets.  This was last week I think in some story about how the MTC is a bunch of bullies to the drivers."

StLouis,3deh0o,dy-lanthedane,3,Wed Jul 15 20:06:22 2015 UTC,But isn't there a flat fee per transaction??
StLouis,3deh0o,t-poke,5,Wed Jul 15 22:56:58 2015 UTC,It depends on the agreement the merchant can negotiate with their card processor (and the big ones like Target and Wal-Mart obviously have more clout than mom & pop stores) but typically the fees are a flat fee of a few cents plus a percentage. Or Square which is just a percentage.
StLouis,3deh0o,shellica,2,Thu Jul 16 01:18:36 2015 UTC,Not with Square. I pay 2.75% with no other fees unless I manually enter the card.
StLouis,3deh0o,shapu,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:59:59 2015 UTC,"There'll be a flat fee for accepting the transaction and then an interchange fee of between 2 and 4 percent.  7% is bananas and borders on criminal.

StLouis,3deh0o,stltaxi,4,Thu Jul 16 20:04:42 2015 UTC,"I would like to help shed some light on the credit card fee question and the role of the MTC vs the cab company. The MTC just regulates what technology can or cannot be used to actually process the card. IE back seat device or a Square.  They get absolutely no revenue from the credit card processing fees in any way.  Their purpose for regulating the device is simply to ensure the device is PCI compliant.  Each driver is allowed to chose how they want to process their credit cards.  They can choose Square and pay the flat fee they charge. Or they can chose to have the cab company they are affiliated with to process their cards.  Unfortunately some cab companies use this as a revenue opportunity and charge the cab driver a fee of  say 7% which is more than their costs to process the credit cards plus the related technology and data costs. The driver has the final choice in how they chose to process their cards. Again the MTC gets nothing from these transactions. At county cab, 98% of our drivers allow us to process their cards because we provide funding to them almost immediately whereas Square could take a few days.  We do charge a small fee but it just covers our fees and the necessary data plan to process the card in seconds. It is just cost neutral for us. Hope this helps to clarify.  This is Debbie Rudawsky CFO and co-owner."
StLouis,3deh0o,Sobie17,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:56:57 2015 UTC,"Any proof of this? Square does say up to 36 hours, usually 1-2 business days.  I'm not a merchant so I'm not hip on how long traditional processing takes."

Poor people can't afford to pay for insurance, registration, or even the car to begin with.  Not that it really matters, since I don't think in an urban center you should have to own a car.  That should be the perk of living in a city -- everything should be in walking, biking or train/trolley service distance: groceries, your job, etc.  I wonder why things failed in the city by the 70s? Probably because you needed to have a car to get everywhere.  Poor people can't buy cars.  Without a car, you can't get to work (or at least a decent job, with livable pay).  The lack of solid public transportation just kind of perpetuates the segregation in this city, in my opinion.

Other factors: Floor openings that drop five or six stories onto hard packed earth and left over concrete, crumbling staircases to high up areas, very little light inside of buildings that haven't been inspected or fixed up in years, holes in floors that drop into water of indeterminate depth with no easy way out.  Everything is loose and feels like it's on the verge of collapsing at any moment, and then you and your buddies walk out onto it. It's exhilarating and was a lot of fun, but I don't think I'd go back unless I had permission  You can find my photos here"

Drivers were friendly. Payment was handled in-app. No charge for extra riders.  Good luck waiting that short of a time anywhere in St Louis (except maybe the airport).

Back when it was cheaper universities could afford professors that had free time, benefits, and some form of job security. That leads to a happier person who does their job better.  The last class I took was a train wreck. The teacher didn't care and made it obvious. They barely controlled the classroom and was rather frank about how much they didn't make and how much it stressed them out.   And there I was like a sap supporting their mistreatment all so I could maybe better myself and find a job I can afford to live on myself."

Just a few days ago I spoke to a fellow teacher & one of his classes had been cancelled. No one bothered to tell him & he would not have known if he had not asked. Said if he didn't have a photography gig on the side he would not be able to make his monthly payments. This has happened to me as well. I absolutely love teaching there & were it not for the students I would feel much more depressed about the situation. I too have another job on the side & am considering picking up a few hours at my friends restaurant.
StLouis,3dc47w,l84tahoe,13,Wed Jul 15 02:54:33 2015 UTC,"Homemade provel recipe:   Sodium citrate (buy on Amazon) Sharp white cheddar Swiss cheese Smoked provolone (or regular provolone + liquid smoke) Water    Using equal parts of all three cheeses, shred them and combine. Weigh out 4% of the total cheese weight as sodium citrate. If the total cheese weight is 100 grams, use 4 grams sodium citrate. Weigh out roughly 90% of the total cheese weight as water. Bring the water and sodium citrate to a simmer and slowly add the grated cheese, whisking each addition until melted. Pour into a container and let cool, then refrigerate until solid. Boom - processed cheese.   The sodium citrate prevents the cheeses from ""breaking"" into their constituent parts (fat, milk solids, etc.) and improves their melting characteristics. This recipe can be used with just about any combination of cheeses but you might need to fiddle with the amount of water. Cheese made this way makes some of the best macaroni ever (a la Modernist Cuisine) with a much clearer cheese flavor and velvety gooey texture."

StLouis,3dc47w,Sobie17,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:56:17 2015 UTC,Does anyone have a good recipe for a good Imo's clone? Backstory: I'm a California native and my girlfriend is from Kirkwood and loves the shit out of some Imo's (and Steak 'n Shake). I visited her family after Christmas and over 10 days we had Imo's 3 times. My favorite was the cheeseburger variety. I would like to try my best to make it for her because she recently got a promotion and can't make it back to Kirkwood this summer. I know the sauce is going to be the hardest to emulate.

SAUCE   1 (8-ounce) can tomato sauce 3 tablespoons tomato paste 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil 1 tablespoon sugar 2 teaspoons dried oregano   CHEESE   2 cups shredded white American cheese 1/2 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese 3 drops liquid smoke   DOUGH   2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tablespoons cornstarch 2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons water 2 tablespoons olive oil    MAKE SAUCE Whisk together tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, sugar, and oregano in small bowl; set aside. Toss cheeses with liquid smoke in medium bowl; set aside. MIX DOUGH Combine flour, cornstarch, sugar, baking powder, and salt in large bowl. Combine water and olive oil in liquid measuring cup. Stir water mixture into flour mixture until dough starts to come together. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and knead 3 or 4 times, until cohesive. ROLL DOUGH Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position, place pizza stone (or inverted baking sheet) on rack, and heat oven to 475 degrees. Divide dough into 2 equal pieces. Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, press into small circle and transfer to parchment paper dusted lightly with flour. Using rolling pin, roll and stretch dough to form 12-inch circle, rotating parchment as needed. Lift parchment and pizza off work surface onto inverted baking sheet. ASSEMBLE PIZZA Top each piece of dough with half of sauce and half of cheese. Carefully pull parchment paper and pizza off baking sheet onto hot baking stone. Bake until underside is golden brown and cheese is completely melted, 9 to 12 minutes. Remove pizza and parchment from oven. Transfer pizza to cooling rack and let cool few minutes. Assemble and bake second pizza. Cut into 2-inch squares. Serve.   The dough can be made in advance. At the end of step 2, tightly wrap the ball of dough in plastic and refrigerate for up to 2 days."

I feel like the whole over-the-top SJW persona (/r/tumblrinaction, HAES, etc) has really diluted the conversation around what social justice should be.   This article being downvoted pretty heavily seems to underscore the reluctance of people to acknowledge that there is a race problem in St. Louis.   I was talking to a black friend who moved away from St. Louis a decade ago. He was having trouble believing that police elsewhere could actually be fair and just. Now that he's been away for a while and has been able to experience normality he just can't believe how backward this region is in certain areas.   Those of us who are white middle class men cannot even comprehend the injustice that others face. Therefore to many of us, it doesn't exist and is a result of black people being overly sensitive.   If we do not actually come to grips with the disparity we can never fix it. And if we don't fix it, get ready for the next flare up."
