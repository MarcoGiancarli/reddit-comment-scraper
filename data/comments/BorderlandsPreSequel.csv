BorderlandsPreSequel,3e183k,IKill4MySkill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:42 2015 UTC,VB's good but there are better options DPS-wise for her such as Sledge's Shotty or Toby's Bright Spadroon. It's still nice though when you're not using the Aspis since you can restore both your health and shields (through Conduit) with it.

After the first playthrough (normal mode) you can play through the Claptastic Voyage DLC which starts at level 30, or start True Vault Hunter Mode, which is the entire game again but with everything levelled higher. After you've finished the game on TVHM you unlock Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, which is the whole game again in the hardest of hard modes.  The Holodome Onslaught DLC can be played once in each game mode, with a repeatable badass final round. Claptastic Voyage can also be played once in each game mode.  The base game itself has a secret boss called Iwajira, and a raid boss called The Invincible Sentinel (an upgraded form of the final boss). You can repeat the last boss of Claptastic Voyage as well, and that DLC also has a repeatable arena with a few customizable options.  Hope this helps."
BorderlandsPreSequel,3e2ba7,Shrykos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:10:37 2015 UTC,"it does help, thanks for the information...  I guess I'm just wondering where to go from here; I know with Borderlands 2 there are a number of raid bosses you can farm for sweet legendary gear and obviously I have ran into a few bosses in TPS but I'm not sure which I should be farming for my build.  I'm playing as Nisha and I am going for a dual wielding pistol DPS machine, so I really would like to know which raid boss drops a good legendary pistol.  I appreciate you letting me know the name of two of the bosses, I'll look up some info on them after I finish my first playthrough and see what they drop!"
BorderlandsPreSequel,3e2ba7,Shrykos,2,Tue Jul 21 14:59:00 2015 UTC,If you scroll down this page to the BLTPS section you can see which enemies to farm for a couple legendary pistols.

BorderlandsPreSequel,3e1h8g,JWalty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:55:30 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure the level of the quest reward is the same as the level at which it says when you first accept that quest. So in your case to get a level 70 version of Zarpedon's pistol the mission would have to be rated at level 70.
BorderlandsPreSequel,3e1h8g,TheEagleFanboy,2,Tue Jul 21 07:38:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Level up to level 70, then reset your campaign and run through it again. If you do the mission then you'll get a level 70 Zarpedon's pistol."
BorderlandsPreSequel,3e1h8g,Innominandum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:35:34 2015 UTC,you can reset uvhm at any point so when you hit 70 you can reset and play through all the quests and get the max lvl stuff

BorderlandsPreSequel,3dt65t,Blurgas,2,Sun Jul 19 05:57:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I forgot about that. Seems inconsistent with the visual of the big hunk of Helios falling into the singularity. The canonicity (is that a word?) of side missions is mixed, though seems a little more canonical in TPS. I'll hold out hope, but realize that it is minuscule at best.  Probably should not play so late and get more sleep...."

You can find the 25-digit codes via two twitter accounts: the official Borderlands twitter and Randy Pitchfork. For past codes, websites like ORCZ and the Borderlands Wikia have compiled lists of gold key codes that still work. Cross saves only work within a gaming family: 360/One, PC/Mac, PS3/Vita/PS4.  I don't actually know the answer to this . . . but there are class mods/oz kits/shields/skill tree abilities that, when combined, can greatly extend your max health."

BorderlandsPreSequel,3dl46y,madhaunter,6,Fri Jul 17 05:52:33 2015 UTC,I got the same feeling. The first two were perfect. Set the mood up for the game and were catchy as hell. Didn't feeling like humming this last one.

BorderlandsPreSequel,3ddhbn,datadamage,3,Thu Jul 16 12:06:06 2015 UTC,"As far as classes go, if you're looking for a similar play style to guns erode then Nisha is the way to go. She's the most run and gun in this game. I played as gumzerker in BL2 but when I got to TPS I wanted something different and went with Athena and I love her. I haven't played as anyone else so I can't recommend anything.   For the DLCs there is only one story DLC. The claptastic voyage. I have loved playing it and I'd recommend waiting until the end of your first play through to enter it. The holodome would be a great way to do some extra leveling if it's ever needed thoughout.   True Vault Hunter Mode (TVHM) and Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) are the second and third playthroughs of the game. With TVHM the enemies continue to level until you reach level 50 at which point they will stop. In UVHM the enemies are constantly scaled to your level. Meaning they will essentially always be a level or so higher. But that just means you level up more and get higher quality loot.   As for the bosses, I would say there aren't as many as there were in BL2 but there isn't a shortage of them by any means. They've released a lot of updates that have fixed the drops of legendaries and now most unique enemies have some kind of special drop, whether it's legendary or unique. There are a couple bosses who you can only fight once that have legendary drops. There is only one true Raid Boss in this game but the final boss of the claptastic voyage is as hard as one. I'm pretty sure there's a full list of bosses on here somewhere. But I'm on mobile and can't link it.   One last thing that will help you is the Grinder. When you are able to get the mission ""Grinders"" make sure to do it right away. It's a great addition to this game. There is also a thread on here that goes into depth about that.   Well that's all I got. Happy Vault Hunting!"
BorderlandsPreSequel,3ddhbn,oopoe,2,Wed Jul 15 13:19:53 2015 UTC,This is extremely helpful; thanks for your response!  I'm excited to play through everything!
BorderlandsPreSequel,3dd0ei,TheWWWorm,10,Wed Jul 15 08:41:03 2015 UTC,All the planned content is released already.

BorderlandsPreSequel,3dd0ei,ChiefMcKief,3,Wed Jul 15 10:16:32 2015 UTC,"Was a very poor excuse for a season pass IMO. The other 2 games boasted 4 campaign DLC's and BL2 with even more content...  TPS was just 1 campaign DLC, which was awesome, but not good enough to make the game feel as complete as the other 2."
BorderlandsPreSequel,3dd0ei,ilovecheese2,0,Wed Jul 15 10:21:06 2015 UTC,All the content for this game should a cost $49.99 in my opinion. Charging full prices game was a disaster a.k.a. money grab.
BorderlandsPreSequel,3dd0ei,AskACapperDOTcom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:19:51 2015 UTC,Is that official? Theres nothing more coming out for this Release?
BorderlandsPreSequel,3dd0ei,safeguard77,3,Wed Jul 15 19:17:08 2015 UTC,This game pretty much flopped compared to BL2. Just look at steam stats. You can be lucky you got as much as you did.
BorderlandsPreSequel,3dd0ei,Rykzon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"I mean, I get that it was handed to another studio, and this is probably filler until Borderlands 3 but damn I really hope there is at least one more campaign"

BorderlandsPreSequel,3dd0ei,Nnoitrum,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:39:49 2015 UTC,It is the last planned DLC completing the season pass... I doubt Gearbox will work on this game anymore with BL3 and Battleborn on their minds.

BorderlandsPreSequel,3d7s8o,ToxicPerc,3,Tue Jul 14 14:54:59 2015 UTC,"AFAIK his  ""You don't know...my name!"" is possible without Badass upgrade.  Badass upgrade adds ""That's right, it's a badass Jack"" and ""Yeah well I got a badass of my own!""   I could be wrong. It happens on rare occasions. Usually my sweetheart Daemerrung corrects me.   What really gets on my nerves are the constant callouts from Money is Power. If I could turn ONLY that off, I'd be happy.  But I can't skip the skill, because even though it takes a while to get to the point where the bonuses start to add up, it's worth it in the end.  If you need ammo, go somewhere that respawn enemies low-level enemies.    The only time I spend money with Jack is for Legendaries that I love, like the Storm Front or Badaboom."
BorderlandsPreSequel,3d7s8o,AJockeysBallsack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:05:15 2015 UTC,Oh I didn't realize that. I don't remember hearing it until I put the point into the badass upgrade. I was watching a video by bahroo and he said that's what caused it. That's why I specd out of it. Now I feel like I need to test it. Also your 100% right about money is power. 999 stacks can get crazy!
BorderlandsPreSequel,3d7s8o,ToxicPerc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:42:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his right tree is so great for TVHM/UVHM IMO (FFS UFO OMG WTF).  MiP takes forever to max if you aren't grinding it (and then it still takes a good while), but the difference is obvious by about the halfway point.    I used to think Compound Interest was a waste of time, until I got all the way to Sponsored By...and then realized I should be constantly swapping weapons like Athena, and using as much Hyperion gear as I can.  Compound Interest is a lot more effective when it's constantly being set off, even if it's not at max damage. Every little bit of damage helps."

BorderlandsPreSequel,3d83qv,I_am_Hoban,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:08:59 2015 UTC,I don't know because it gives like small percents to shield and health and damage so at lower levels I imagine it's not that good but a the higher levels it may prove useful.
BorderlandsPreSequel,3d83qv,aman4456,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:25:13 2015 UTC,The middle tree you really need a cryo weapon but if you're lucky it makes your action extremely powerful and makes you very hard to kill
BorderlandsPreSequel,3d83qv,brandpanz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:00:42 2015 UTC,I like sniper so i did left tree. Ita pretty badass if your good with them
BorderlandsPreSequel,3d83qv,AJockeysBallsack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"Here's a skill guide in case you were wondering. Here are some extra tips that are worth mentioning:   Avalanche will grow stronger the more you mob. It's not too impressive though until you get Fragment Rain and/or use a lot of cryo weapons. Aurelia is the squishiest Vault Hunter in the game, and it really starts to show in higher levels. You might want to start using transfusions (cryo is best) eventually. You can prestack I Never Miss at the firing range in Deck 13 1/2 (provided you have Clapastic Voyage). Just make sure not to miss. If you plan on using Avalanche, avoid trying to inflict fire damage at all costs. This includes fire barrels and the fire damage option from Custom Loads. If you see a bunch of fire barrels, destroy them before they can hurt any enemies."

BorderlandsPreSequel,3d6jgc,nanoflower,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:05:15 2015 UTC,at Lvl 70 he's dropping the Hail every time. The Thingy is still rare to ever see. There was a time when I seemed to get a Thingy ever few kills but for the past few months it seems to take tens of kills to find one Thingy.

Once you start TVHM you can always return to your first play through if things are too hard and you want to level up a bit more. So I would jump right in!

BorderlandsPreSequel,3ctoiw,wingsday1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:00:39 2015 UTC,Only Bona Fide Grit and COM/Oz boosts actually boost the critical damage.
BorderlandsPreSequel,3ctoiw,brandpanz,2,Fri Jul 10 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"I would argue that toumbstone is an incredibly powerful crit damage buff, because it alows splashdamage to crit, which, by the way, scalse off of your gun damage.

BorderlandsPreSequel,3ctoiw,wingsday1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:53:03 2015 UTC,"I guess a better way to describe Tombstone would either be that it buffs your overall damage or that it buffs your crit potential, since evidently saying that it buffs crit damage can be misleading.

BorderlandsPreSequel,3ctoiw,_darkwingduck_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:30:59 2015 UTC,"I had to make a similar choice for my Clappy (along with an explosive dmg mod) and ended up with the gun damage. That made for a nice boost when farming Iwajira.  By the way.. with the gun dmg mod and the yellow glitch bonus I can take down Iwajira just using a Frigida at lvl 69. It's funny to watch Iwajira move in slow motion. If only it could actually freeze him.   But back on topic.. After testing similar expl., crit. and gun dmg mods the gun damage mod was the best for my Claptrap. As they say with Nisha the picture changes a bit if you are going to crit most of the time but with gun damage the bonus is always there."
