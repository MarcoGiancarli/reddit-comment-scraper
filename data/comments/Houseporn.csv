Houseporn,33v4s6,KeepingMyselfAlive,20,Sun Apr 26 00:27:17 2015 UTC,"Large homes like this are primarily for entertaining. Large parties, charity functions, etc.  Plus they have specialized rooms which can add up (home gym, home theaters, etc.) A house like this might even have a ballroom and wing for permanent staff."

Houseporn,33v4s6,oswaldcopperpot,16,Sun Apr 26 01:56:33 2015 UTC,Sometimes you can have both the house & the 20 condos.    And I suspect Mark is in that category of people that can.
Houseporn,33v4s6,wdr1,14,Sun Apr 26 06:47:19 2015 UTC,"You would be surprised. My mother works real estate in Florida. The things that people have in mansions is crazy. Usually 2-3 family rooms, 2 pools, a secret room, a wine cellar, a home theater room, play room, game room, music room, office, kitchen, full service bars, Jacuzzi, halls, halls and more halls for the art they buy."
Houseporn,33v4s6,Bonafy,2,Sun Apr 26 03:08:52 2015 UTC,This means never having to make room for doing different stuff.  Just go to the room set up for it.  Not that people with staff have to do it anyway...
Houseporn,33v4s6,0_0_0,6,Sun Apr 26 09:26:07 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree in general.  Some families are close.  House that big could house extra family members, but everyone would still have enough space not to interact unless they wanted to.    Another thing is theres probably lots of specialized rooms as well as very open spaces.  Thats going to balloon the square feet quite a bit.  I think Ide rather have a much smaller, but cooler house.  Something more like say Iron Mans house.  On a bluff overlooking the ocean with some very cool architecture.  Or something else even more unique."

I hear your opinion very strongly!    (Although I cannot see evidence of it falling apart, with the exception of the fence)  I am just wondering that there may be a NZ cultural thing going on here.  There is a strong tradition in New Zealand of people spending a holiday in buildings just like this.  They are called a ""bach"" in most of the country and a ""crib"" in the deep south.  Many people have strong memories of happy times in buildings just like this.  They are sought after, although land prices are rising and many are being replaced by large expensive buildings in prime beach locations.   It is still possible to rent these sorts of buildings out ""Book a Bach"" does a huge trade, with people looking for this sort of accommodation in preference to hotel sterility.     Ugly is a bit of an irrelevance for how they are loved.      I do hear the sounds of both the up and the down votes though. It's obviously a little too controversial!    Obviously a substantial group of people agree with your views.  It's been a very  interesting discussion."

But if the actual building itself is ugly, nobody glosses over that with ""But oh the memories!"" We'll laugh because the place is so shitty but it doesn't matter because you're there for the experience together and to be outdoors.  But not once will anyone confuse one of these places for house porn. Just the opposite.  I think you're looking at this place through extremely rose-tinted shades. It's a broken down relic.

Houseporn,2xc43f,TheShadyChemist313,2,Sat Feb 28 03:40:56 2015 UTC,"Accepted that it is simple design.  A little bit like the simplicity of Japanese rock gardens perhaps.   Where it stands if it were a competition, I'll leave to viewers to make judgement.  It is, however not all same old.  What stands out, and something I have not seen before is the wavy lawn, alongside the curvy path. It was the lawn that initially attracted my attention, and not the path.   The wavy lawn is perhaps not that easy to see in the photo.  I have not seen such a lawn before.   And perhaps for the good reason that it is much easier to mow lawns that are as flat as a pancake!      This design is saying that functionality is not as important as form.  The look of the lawn is worth the downside of making the mowing of the lawn more difficult for years to come!  I have been told that the owners once had blue lights that lit up the bottoms of the waves.  Until they were stolen :(    This must have looked magnificent.  (Wavy pastures are actually a design feature of many Dairy farms on the West Coast of the South Island.  The rainfall in this area is higher than almost anywhere else in the world, and the ""waves"" allow the pastures to drain)"
