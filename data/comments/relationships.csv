It is easy to sit behind a screen and say that you should always take care of children in extended family. But each of us has a limit to what we can handle without imploding our lives. If you think that you can't deal with the kids, I'd suggest you do not deal with the kids.   If something happens to my partners sibling, we will take in her son. This was something that the two of us have discussed and agreed on. And he is a neurotypical kid.   If the kid had issues, or if they had four kids, you bet I would have had a discussion with my partner about this before moving in together. I don't do with more than one or two kids, or with special needs kids. That's my limit and I own it.   You need to find your limit and own it as well. So does your SO."

My perception is that those situations are less common, but I don't speak from personal experience.  (2) I have two kids with a wife I love, and they are an immense amount of work.  Our life pre-kids and our life post-kids ... hugely different.  Our relationship, despite our love, takes so much more work.  I can't imagine having four.  And to add a special needs kid on top?

As far as foster parents are concerned I think it's because we focus on the negative stories of how they are in it for the money and they abuse children. In reality there are probably just as many if not more biological parents abusing their children as foster parents (that can be how they end up in foster care in the first place).   With my step dad though it seemed to run in the family. His parents had Foster kids who loved them and his SIL always had Foster kids and actually adopted twins.

They would have meetings where they kicked us out of the house and debated about what to do with us. Left to our own devices, we just kinda imagined the worse.  Tell them. Kids are brighter than you may think, and even if they can't fully grasp the situation now, they'll have your side of the story when they grow up later. Let them know there are other factors at play and the reason they're not being taken in, is not because there is something wrong with them and they're unlovable.   All that being said.

Everything else is identical. Same ages as the older 3.  My aunt couldn't have kids so she and her husband adopted them... and it was the worst decision this family has ever made. They have so many developmental problems, require SO much extra attention. They developed a lot of early sexual experimentation behaviors. I don't know how much of it was related to drugs and alcohol but despite being sweet whenever you meet them, they're nightmares to raise. My aunt had to quit her job because they required constant supervision. My aunt and uncle are so exhausted dealing with these kids that my aunt is starting to show signs of alcoholism... she comes over DAILY to my mom's house to get the kids off of her hands. In drunk honesty she said she's getting so tired of it that she wants to kill herself some nights.   For clarity, they don't respond to discipline well. They're slow to learn or understand anything. One of them is repeating the 3rd grade for the 3rd time. Their dental hygiene was terrible and they spent thousands on dental bills. They're always trying to get into trouble by going through other people's things. They steal small items, which becomes a big deal when a small item is expensive jewelry. The older one touches the younger ones inappropriately. One of them takes every chance she has to hold an iPad or phone to run away with it and watch porn. And they just take twice the effort of a normal kid to improve in any regard.   No one in the family hates the kids. All of their problems can be attributed to the mother. But they're disasters, year or more behind in school, etc. This was 5 years ago and it has only gotten more and more and more miserable as we realize the consequences of all the fundamental developmental problems they have. Family is beginning to ostracized my aunt whenever possible, aunt and uncle considering divorce because their marriage is unhappy because they literally can't devote time to each other.   But you know what's the worst part? They had NO IDEA how terrible the kids were when they adopted them. They seemed like precious angels at first (with your typical undisciplined kid problems), their wild behaviors were all things they developed due to various things.   From my experience, I would say no one has an obligation to go through this. Good on you and absolutely amazing if you have it in you, but I don't think there's an underlying responsibility. You'll be putting your life on hold for the next 16 years, at least. Maybe they're not as terrible but you have no idea. My aunt went from no kids to 3 and wants to die 5 years later. There's no responsibility there saying you have to do this.  Edited for elaboration on their behavior."

Years later, the children were removed from the home by the state, and my family member got them. They all had severe developmental and behaviour issues, and one is has special needs. They were coached all their life to believe that my family member was worthless and that his military service made him violent and evil and abusive.The one with special needs adjusted INCREDIBLY well. The kid is an angel. The other two, however, began to act out really quickly. They falsely accused my family member and his wife of abuse and neglect, leading to my family being completely railroaded by the media. All children, including his wife's special needs son from her prior relationship, were taken from the home, and they were charged with abuse, neglect, etc. In order to regain custody of his wife's son and his special nerds son, he had to relinquish his rights to his other children. He was then declared unfit due to PTSD from his time in Iraq, and his wife is having to jump through all kinds of legal hoops. As of now, however, the two who were making false claims have been declared sociopaths, therapists have denied the abuse, and all charges have been dropped, but my family member is still being dragged through the mud, and he and his wife are still being denied access to their children. It's a fucking nightmare, and the fact that he did relinquish two children to the state is being used against him to further the idea that his is incompetent and irredeemable in his petitions to regain access to his special needs son and his wife's son. So it's possible, but I've witnessed awful things come of it."

With a child with severe special needs, you could literally be looking at caring until you drop dead of old age, and then they end up in the system anyway. I know a couple, parents in their mid 50's with a 26 y.o. son with severe special needs. They hate life, they hate him (not that they ever show it, it's more a general feeling based on their lives being ruined whilst he cannot appreciate what is happening) and they hate each other. There's nothing they can do about it either, there's no way out for them - they willingly made and continue to make the sacrifice. It's terrible for everyone, and it will be a mercy when any or all of them pass - they have told me that themselves.   On top of that potential nightmare, the older kids are likely to be very difficult to parent, assuming their mother showed the usual level of parenting skill a mother with four kids by four different men and a history of drug addiction and whatever that 'etc' stands for shows.  I'd try and locate the various fathers, to give them a chance to do right by their kid, but I would not even consider stepping in as a parent.   Good luck OP, I'm glad I'm not in your shoes."

My mom died when I was 12 and the family I lived with afterward involved one spouse who really didn't want me there. (but the money and what will people think!)  It was hellishly confusing and horrible environment to go through adolescence.   It is hard to describe how messed up it was, but these kids need parents who will love them. And if that just isn't in the cards, they at least deserve an honest situation. Don't pretend you are going to be a family for them if you are not. It is not something you can fake. And whatever happens these children will not be grateful. I always hated when people told me how grateful I was supposed to be. These kids aren't asking you to change your lifestyle.  They are only looking to be taken care of which is their right not a privilege. You (ethically) only need to see that this arranged somehow, not change your personal lifestyle. If you do change your lifestyle, it is your choice not these kids choice. And it is not for a long time, it is forever. They will need a parent when they are 20. 30, 40 years old (when is the last time you called your mother?). If you ""take them in"" till 18 for the SSI $ and the judgment of the extended family, you are robbing them of the chance to forge a relationship with someone who actually be there parent.  TL;DR  Don't take on children out of peer pressure from family. They don't deserve your resentment."

relationships,3e2af7,wombatzilla,76,Tue Jul 21 13:02:00 2015 UTC,It also sounds like these kids are going to end up in foster care
relationships,3e2af7,Owr_Cinc,73,Tue Jul 21 13:22:26 2015 UTC,"Probably, but they're better off in foster care if their only options consist of family members who aren't really willing to take them and would only be doing it out of guilt or a misplaced sense of familial obligation. I know Reddit likes to hate on foster care and foster families, but as someone who actually works in the field (I'm a clinical social worker who specializes in treating kids and teenagers with PTSD) and sees these situations on a not-infrequent basis, I feel confident in saying that foster care is usually the best place for kids like this.   The OP doesn't give us a whole lot of information, but reading between the lines, it sounds like the kids' mom has neglected them fairly significantly over the course of their lives and has a history of chaotic romantic relationships (a huge risk factor for abuse and neglect), to the point where at least one of them is ""high special needs."" This means that they very likely all have varying developmental, medical, and emotional problems resultant from being neglected for that length of time, and will all require significant intervention to cope with this loss and adjust to life in a different family. That's a pretty tall order for people who never wanted kids in the first place, and do not appear to have the resources to take them in.  One of the good aspects of foster care is that kids who are actively in care are given first priority to receive services in most areas. In my agency, the kids who are in state custody are always the first to receive services because they are considered to have a higher level of need, often taking precedence over kids who've been on the wait list for months. In addition to that, their caseworkers (which they will always have if they are in foster care) are in the best position to sign them up for things that they will need and ensure that their needs are getting met across settings (example: I once worked with a kid who was in a totally inappropriate educational setting, and I'm convinced the only reason he got moved to where he needed to be is because his caseworker and her supervisor intervened with the school). Lastly, there are specialized foster parents who will take on kids with more advanced needs who have the training to manage them.   Most kinship guardians simply lack the education, experience, and free time to do all of those things for high-needs children, especially since they do not typically get paid to take these kids in. Foster care isn't free, but kinship placements are, which is why random family members tend to get leaned on to take in kids in situations like this one. The only help that OP and her husband would be guaranteed to get are food stamps and medicaid for the kids. They might be able to get housing or childcare vouchers, SSI for the disabled kid, or child support from the kids' fathers (assuming they can be tracked down and have jobs), but none of those things are guaranteed and they won't come close to offsetting the cost of taking them in and raising them until adulthood.   If OP and her husband aren't all-in on taking these kids in and doing right by them, they need to step aside."
relationships,3e2af7,pandoraslunchbox,91,Tue Jul 21 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"Possibly. But any of the family who is asking OP and her husband to take on these kids is also making the choice not to take the kids in themselves, so I'm not sure why they're putting all this pressure on OP and her husband to take the kids."

She actually didn't mention other family putting pressure.  It could be child services asking, at this point, for all we know, because the picture she painted shows zero other family able to do what she and husband don't want to do.  I'm not saying I blame her--I'd be hard pressed to take on someone else's four kids, including a special needs one, and I like kids.

relationships,3e2af7,Ruval,15,Tue Jul 21 14:11:37 2015 UTC,"If it's not right for you, it's not right for you.  But to me it kinda sounds like you are asking reddit to tell you that you shouldn't feel guilty about letting these kids end up in foster care... and you should realize that everyone commenting on this thread or voting on comments here is going to forget all about this in an hour or a week or a few months, but this is a decision you and your husband are both going to have to live with for the rest of your lives.    I think you should think about this a little harder.  I see you making assumptions about what it would be like to accept this responsibility that are false.  You don't have to move back to your husband's home town -- the kids can come to you.  You don't have to take on all four of them if it's too much, you don't have to take on the ""high special needs"" child on top of everything else.  Your apartment is too small, but there is probably financial assistance.  If you were to really explore your options and at the end of that process you decide that you really don't want to accept any of them, I think you'll come out much better prepared to deal with the guilt than you are now.  It would be better if this feels to you like ""we can't"" rather than ""we don't want to"".  Right now it sounds like you think that visiting your nieces and nephews once or twice a year and sending cards / gifts is enough, but I think that's delusional.  It's not enough to stop you from feeling guilty if they face serious hardships in foster care, and it's not enough to make them feel like they have a loving, caring family either.  In fact, by trying to stay in touch with them, you may find they resent you for not loving them enough, and that makes things even harder.    And let me just add to this... I'm glad that right now you and your husband seem to be of the same mind about this, but make absolutely sure.  You have to make a joint decision here but you also have individual opinions and you need to try to be aware of what those opinions are, individually, where they differ, where they agree, and how your joint decision sits with each of you.  You don't want a situation where you find out in four years when the oldest gets arrested and sent to juvie or something that your husband really wanted to help but felt like he couldn't say that to you."

This isn't just making the decision to help out for a few weeks or months until there is a permanent solution.

If you do take them in, you will likely resent them (as you never asked for them), and it will show.

Not taking them in isn't just okay, it's the most responsible and fair decision you can make in this situation.

I think you will resent them for ruining your life. And they don't deserve that. But on the other hand, you don't deserve to be thrust into parenthood. Whoever is pressuring you into taking them is doing so out of selfishness instead of what is best for the kids.  Bottom line I think the kids get the worst situation out of this either way. But it doesn't seem like they had a good healthy childhood to begin with. You may feel bad if you don't but will be resentful if you do. It's a shitty situation.

Family does not necessarily mean any better for kids. There is too much insistence on that. Just like one of the comments said, family is free and therefore more suggested. Plus, if it's something like 1 or 2 kids, sometimes it's more manageable. I was given the responsibility of my sister's 2 kids, at the time 4 and 9. I had a 4 year old of my own, I was a full time student and my part time job was just enough for my son and I. I became instantly physically ill from stress, the poor kids were confused and sad (mom went to jail), I had to find daycare for my nephew which was NOT the same one my son was in. So I had to pick up 3 kids all from different locations, and get them all ready in the morning to take to different locations. I obviously failed the following quarters, which dropped my gpa to the point of getting on probation. I left school for two years to try to get everything settled. Now the kids are with other family who have time for them, plenty of people around to take shifts in picking them up or dropping them off, and they are faring 100x better than we could have done. The fact that it was family was fortunate for us, but they love the kids and, like I said, have all the time and resources for them. I know what I can handle, I have one son because I can only handle one child. If you can't handle any, whatever your reason, then don't! Don't let these people guilt you into taking on a responsibility you can't do. Just stay in the kids' life as often as possible, that's what I do and it worked out for the best."

I am child free myself,  so I am sorry that I cannot speak from direct experience,  but I would like to speak on behalf of someone who has said experience.   My friend,  we'll call her Betsy,  wanted kids,  so did her husband.  Her sister and her sister's husband died leaving their developmentally disabled child.  Having no other family,  Betsy adopted the boy.  He was wheelchair bound and would never be able to function above the level of a child.   The boy ruined their lives.  They kept delaying their own kids until they had a grasp on caring for the boy. They never did get a grasp. She had to quit her job to care for the kid. She had really loved her job,  but he made much more, and they needed the money to support the kid.  They got divorced two years later, the husband unable to deal with the constant maintenance of the child.  He really wanted kids of his own too, not a 20 year old who needed his diaper changed every few hours. She got some skeezy phone job,  I think phone sex or tarot reading.  She had to be at home to care for the boy. I don't know how she's managing to be honest.   The last time I talked to her,  she looked twenty years older and told me she has fantasies about the boy dying. She knew I had a bit of a, well, let's just say troubled past and asked if there was anything I could do about it.  She immediately claimed it was a joke,  but her voice told me that she had been dead serious, and even after claiming it only a joke, she was hoping I would offer her something.  I never could though. Not even when I was ""troubled"".  I sometimes wish I could when I think about her.   So.  Is there a chance the system could ruin their lives?   Yes.   But taking them in might ruin your lives too. That kinda life when it's not what you wanted could ruin all of your lives.   I hate to give straight yes or no answers most of the time...    But PLEASE. Don't do it."

That's what they're there for! Also, with the financial issue, they should have been getting some sort of help from the government so the mom didn't have to be a sex worker. And excuse me? She had fantasies about murdering the kid and you didn't call DDD, APS, or you know, the cops, which would all have gladly given her the resources to help her out of this situation? The ignorance of the resources at this couples hands astounds me. The government alone throws money at these cases...

There are many people who love and appreciate all aspects of a child with special needs. Clearly your friend struggled, but that is not always the case. One horror story should not constitute guidance.   If OP does not want to raise these children, that's a valid choice without focusing on any special needs. I would encourage OP and SO to find a way to be supportive to the children either way, as this may be an extremely traumatic time where they feel abandoned by a parent and the small family which they have known thus far. It sounds like mom made a series of bad decisions and maybe it will end up being for the best to provide the children with a new life. However, OP, please remember that these children need someone stable in their lives, even if it's not as a parent figure. Even if it's from a distance, I encourage you and SO to stay involved as much as you can to support these children.

My dad died when I was young from diabetes-related issues and my mom died a few years later from cancer. The only relatives my siblings and I had (4 of us total, I'm the youngest) were my dad's two siblings. Neither would take us in.  Now I didn't resent them when it happened and I just believed they couldn't take us in. In reality they could have based on their means. But, I never held it against them.  Fast forward to a couple of years ago and I'm now a father of two kids and I have a great job. Somehow I managed to not only go to college but also law school and I've been fortunate. Well, my aunt tries reaching out to my siblings and me because her brother, my uncle, needs a kidney. That's when I started reflecting on the past. I lost contact with them years prior and never gave them a thought until she reached out. I guess my feelings changed when I had my own kids because now I wonder how someone who should have a connection to helpless kids could let them suffer and feel unloved. Side note- foster care was miserable.  Well, my siblings agreed to get tested to see if they were a match and I went along as well. They were talking about how it would be nice to get to know our family for once and reconnect. As luck would have it, I was a match. I was the only match.   My uncle died because I did to them what they did to me. I saw he was in trouble and when I was the only one that could help I did nothing."

If you can't do it, you can't do it, plain and simple.  As much as some people say put yourself in the shoes of the kids- theres the other side of that as well- yes the kids deserve happiness- but so do you as a married couple and if kids arent in your cards, you should be miserable/unhappy for the kids sake.

relationships,3e2af7,KhalDrogoThatHoe,5,Tue Jul 21 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"I work in the child abuse and neglect area of the law. I see this situation often. I will be frank.   You do not have an obligation to care for the children. Obviously, the law will vary between jurisdictions, but that's the general rule. However, if those children do not have a caretaker, they are likely to be adjudicated neglected. If so, they will be wards of the state.   Now, this is where I'll be very frank. Things will probably not turn out well for them. They will probably be placed in foster care. And, there's a good likelihood that they will be separated. It is not uncommon for wards to have multiple foster homes throughout their childhood. Also, given the age of the children, it is unlikely that they will be adopted (and have a permanent home).   So, they will probably grow up in the system. In my experience, this rarely turns out well. Not having a ""permanent home"" has a profoundly negative impact on children. Most have severe trauma and resulting mental health issues that are compounded by being in foster care. Also, many foster parents will bail when a child's acting out behaviors (that are a result of trauma) become difficult to deal with, which makes the problem worse.   Remember, none of this is due to any fault of the child. It's tragic, but it is the reality of many children in America.   There is no right answer here. While you have no obligation whatsoever, if you and your husband step up now, the children will have a good chance of having a happy and normal childhood. I don't mean to scare you or guilt you into making any decision. But, it's important to know all of the facts, particularly involving the interests of the children. I'm so sorry you're in this situation. My heart also goes out to these children."

Hell, if this happened in my own family, I'd be seriously tempted to say no as well - and I'm in a much better position to take something like this on.  That said, I know that you and your spouse are child-free, but would you feel differently if it was just one child instead of four? Because here's the thing - if those kids end up being in the foster care system, they're probably not all going to be placed together anyway.

We have a brother/sister pair currently enrolled in our program, who live with their aunt. Aunt has 4 kids of her own, as well as these two kids and their two younger siblings (so 8 kids in the house, total). Our clients' lives suck. Their aunt took them in because no-one else would after biological mom's parental rights were terminated. And every day, I wish they were in a foster home or adoptive home - a place where they are wanted and well cared for.  Your sister's kids are going to be high-needs. They've experienced at least one traumatic event, and likely more than one (since you're heavily implying that your sister was a less-than-adequate caregiver). They will need therapy, and possibly more intensive services. They will demand all of your time and attention. If you are not willing to take that on, there is no shame in saying so - better for those kids to have a home that is fully prepared to take on that level of work.  That said, their lives probably will suck in the foster care system. They will likely be split up and placed in different homes. Some of them may be neglected, or even abused. Their need for intensive services will increase. Their quality of life will, in all likelihood, be pretty low.  I can't give you any advice, here. There is no good advice to give. These kids are going to be a giant pile of work no matter where they go, and their lives are almost certainly going to get worse before they get better - that's kinda how trauma works.

There is very rarely room for two siblings, let alone four, in a single foster home unless they live in a rural area where there isn't an overflowing system already.  Most likely the 11 year old boy will have the hardest time- most foster families feel that boys (esp. those that are teens/nearing teens) will be more 'trouble'. He will most likely go to the worst foster parent- the ones that will take anyone for the check. The 2 and 5 year old will be taken by different people hoping to adopt them. The 9 year old is a wild card.  You may not want to have children and you shouldn't feel obligated via guilt to put yourselves in such a huge financial and emotionally draining situation. Just wanted to be clear what the circumstances and realities are.  You may want to do some research and look into families that are looking to adopt siblings- many couples look overseas for babies because for different reasons they cannot adopt here in the US (sometimes the wait list can take years). Talk to a few adoption agencies and see if anyone on their list would be willing to become foster parents- since there is no family, even if it does take years for the adoptions to go through, there would be no challenge to them and they'd still be the 'parents' through the entire process."

If you say no they will likely go to a foster home where they will have trained, attentive and caring foster parents who have chosen to devote themselves to children. People hear horror stories about FC but that is a one in a million shot. Most homes are fabulous places where their parents will devote so much time and love to them.

However, you are simply not in a position to even remotely understand how to care for 4 children -- especially with that large of a age gap and special needs.   Foster care is not always hell, many kids (like myself) did just fine in the system and were placed with loving homes. Taking these kids in right now to your life would put them in a worse position than letting the state handle this mess."

Either in the will or a separate document. But this lady doesn't sound like she'd be responsible enough to have that. If what OP is saying is completely informed, and there really is no one else in the picture, OP and her husband would be the only people to list."
relationships,3e2af7,orangekitti,4,Tue Jul 21 15:01:39 2015 UTC,"It is absolutely okay to say no.  You are under no obligation to another's children, because you had no say in their creation.  Kids deserve to be raised by someone who is 110% all into parenthood, and if that's not you, it'd be a shitty situation for everyone involved.  There is no shame in being childfree- my partner and I are, and it doesn't make you cold-hearted.  IF you do decide to take the kids on, perhaps you can compromise to make it as painless as possible for both you and them.  I know they say moving kids can be difficult after a tragedy, but if they want you to drastically alter your lives, perhaps moving them to your area and getting a bigger apartment or purchasing a house would make it easier.  Then you could keep your jobs and some semblance of your former lifestyles.  However, again, I do not think you need to feel like you must do this.  It isn't your obligation and if you don't think you could be a happy parent, don't make yourselves miserable trying to be the heroes.  There are other ways you can help out (perhaps monetarily?  Contributing to school or food costs?)"

And it's ok to care about our nieces and nephews at this time without wanting to take them on and raise them right?   Yes - but be aware that this might damage your relationship with them. They'll either be told or figure that you didn't want them and might not want to see you."

My uninformed assumption is that foster care is very grim but that a little stability, caring, and extra help would make a big improvement to it.  Just having someone who personally cares about the kids helping to navigate the system to make sure they are in a good home/get the right resources and attention could make a difference?"

Talk to child services (or whoever you need to) and ask about what happens if you don't want them. Do you have anyone you know who would be willing to take them, if not his family then yours? I would also suggest taking the kids for a short time until they can find them a home. Give child services a deadline like 2-4 weeks. While you don't want children, these kids are going through something traumatic and it would probably be a comfort to be around people they know at this point. Stay in contact with the kids when they leave you and make sure to tell them that you are always there for them. Make sure you know where they are being placed and that they are not in a bad situation. From what I hear the foster system sucks... but it wouldn't be any better then being with family that obviously doesn't want them and full of resentment."

Write down all of your best memories of their mother and put it in a scrapbook for when they come looking for more information on their family when they are older.  I know it's hard to have to make this decision.    As for the money issue - the kids would get survivor benefits from social security.  That could be close to 1 thousand per kid per month.  It is meant to be used for their food/clothing/shelter/education/transportation and in their case - counseling.  It's a huge commitment to take on one child.  Much less 4.

Their mother knew that without her those kids would likely be in foster care.  Their mother knew she had a special needs kid and didn't make adaquite provision for them.  Their mother had FOUR children when it sounds like she wasn't even able to keep her own life on track.  Their mother created a situation where it is virtually impossible for the only living relative she has to take in her children.  It would be one thing if there was just one child.

She took it farther by making her toon lay down and was RP comment like ""doest thou wish to join me?"" Fuck no lady, I doest not. I got out of their and blocked her. It felt akward and made me feel dirty. I generally don't assosiate with RP players because I think it's right fucked. I'm biased in that way.  So I said that to point out that if I felt weird about that their is no way that this guy of yours isn't getting some kind of a thrill out of it. He would not be doing it if he was not. Every thing we do has an emotional connection. EVERYTHING. I.E. ""I love camping."" ""I Hate work.""

The way I explained it to her was that RPing on WoW is just an interactive novel. She reads 50 Shades, so I said it was like that. So she was okay with it. That's why I was shocked, cause thats how I see ERP. It's an erotic novel. Might make me ignorant, but that's my view.  Now, as soon as he said he was single. I literally said ""Fuck that"" at work. That's just a shitty thing to do to anyone and he deserves whatever comes to him. You did the right thing. You should be proud of yourself and not let some child ruin your day."

Religion is not worth it the second it starts to impact your life in a negative way. I know someone that goes to a catholic church, not only does she get pressured into doing things for the church on her own time (because they know that they can push her around), but at one we were discussing ""the DaVinci Code"" at work, and she said ""oh, we're not allowed to read that""  At what point do you put the breaks on religion? when they dictate what you can read?"

She also was against that.  There were some changes to our sex education program, which any normal person would be totally fine with, but the hard core muslim community got their panties in a bunch about it it, and raised a shit storm, non-speaking chinese immigrants followed, along with hard core catholics.  She mentioned that many in her church are up in arms about the ""new curriculum"". Mostly because the information all these groups are getting is wildly inaccurate. Such as ""grade one's will be taught how to masturbate""  NO where in the curriculum does it even hint at this. It's just a straight out lie, and these guys believe it hook line and sinker (as well as many other lies). So even though I joke at her about being a prude, she says that her fellow church goers are far far worse than she is, which scares me a little.  One time at work, we were really slow.

There are 'collectivist' cultures, where the needs/wants of the family group are given more value than the wants/desires of the individual, and because the US is overall an 'individualist' society (flip the description of collectivist), this can lead to cultural clashes within families, particularly those where the parents and the child were born/raised in different countries."

You've got a good head on your shoulders.  And you shouldn't worry about your parents.  I'll tell you a little story:  My friend Ashley was raised Catholic her entire life.  Really inexperienced with relationships, she had a boyfriend in high school that she kissed once in two years.  A lot of us go to the same college, and she figures out that she's a lesbian in her junior year.    Her parents are super strict and she's afraid of telling them this but I told her there were only two possible outcomes:  1) They are initially mad, and maybe even cut off contact but they eventually come around.  This happens a lot with super religious families with LGBT members.  In that case, you know that eventually everything will be OK with them even if it takes time.  2) They are initially mad, and they cut off contact and never get around to accepting her.  In this case, they are the type of people who would put their ""faith"" in front of their own child.  If someone is so spiteful that they would abandon their own child for this, is that kind of toxic person someone you want in your life?  This is a test of their moral character, not yours.  She had a lot of support from her sister and she told them the next week.  And they were mad.  Didn't speak for like a month.  But eventually they came around. They even took an interest in her girlfriend and had her over for dinner a year down the road.  These two outcomes are why I think people who come here for advice should never, ever be afraid to stand up to their parents.  Because they are adults, and they are accountable for their actions.  And if a parent is so selfish that they wouldn't accept something fundamentally important in their child's life, and are willing to abandon that child, they are not worth being around.  It's as simple as that.  It's a litmus test; those who pass are worth keeping in your life.  Those who don't, aren't."

Nobody gave a shit that he was born a Catholic and 'converted' to atheism. My entire extended family (which is huge, we had 230 people at our wedding) knows he's an atheist and doesn't care. And when our first baby was stillborn, everybody was very careful not to say comforting things rooted in our religion - any religion in fact. Yet they supported me in a Jewish way. He's not the first gentile to marry into the family - just the first male gentile.  Strict Orthodox sects will cut all ties to family members who marry outside the faith, going so far as to mourn the individual as if they were dead. But that cultural behavior is not standard for all sects - it's not standard for most sects. Families may put pressure on individuals to find a Jewish spouse (mine didn't), and sometimes that pressure can be intense, but a family who cut ties to their child/grandchild/whatever because they were dating/engaged to a non-Jew would lose some face. They might lose face either way (again, not my family, and not in my sect, Reform, and generally in not Progressive sects), but cutting a family member out due to the religion of their intended spouse is generally found only in the Orthodox sects. I should also point out that in many Progressive sects, intermarriage has been allowed for decades (my cousin married my Methodist cousin-in-law in 1984, I was the flower girl), and in some of these sects, gay marriages have been permitted for 2+ decades, and gay/lesbian rabbis are not uncommon. Moreover, Orthodox Judaism is not the 'original' form of Judaism that all current sects evolved from. Religious practiced varied greatly from community to community and country to country, often because Jews were not allowed to live among non-Jews, so the community's religious practice was based around a single rabbi and could be highly specific. It was only when Jews began to be allowed into the culture at large that the current sects were formed, as there was now a need for uniformity across a greater population.  But I will concede that this kind of cultural behavior is common to collectivist cultures (vs. individualist cultures as is common in the Western world) and Judaism is a collectivist culture. As an anthropologist turned social worker, I saw this cultural behavior in other collectivist culture members transplanted in the US (Chinese, Muslim, and Indian), and yes, Orthodox Jews do this too. It's a cultural conflict for many first generation immigrants. But it's not fair to assume anything beyond this being a collectivist immigrant family - there is no indication of what culture it is - and you can't apply a single cultural behavior to a diverse group of people, especially one where most families have lived in the US/Western Nations for decades.  tl;dr: Several Jewish sects do this. Most do not. Don't lump us all into one group."

I wouldn't say ""converted"" to atheism, but ""graduated"" to atheism, in most contexts.  Also you know what's amazing? Religion is all but extinct in most of Western Europe. Amazing how much of a 'bubble' the US is in, isn't it?  In the US, ""Christianity"" is normal --- in France, Germany, and the UK, it's pretty much the fasting shrinking minority. 40% of the French are non-religious. 32% of the Germans. And that means they don't believe in any sort of God or 'spirit' or life force.  And most of the religious are the elderly. Those percentages are overwhelmingly larger among the youth.  The majority of young people in these nations are atheist/ agnostic. The people there that ARE religious (except for a handful of muslims and sprinkling of Christians) are pretty tolerant to other faiths and even atheism.  .... religious is like the Confederacy, or people against women's and gay rights .... a fucking dinosaur, that is slowly, but inevitably, going away.

If you disagree with this, tell me how you think a more exactly analogous response would fly, such as ""I hope a series of unrelated coincidences lead to a satisfactory resolution for you""?  I'm absolutely in favor of freedom of religion, so please don't mistake this for being a radicalised counter-position, but I do think there tends to be a higher reluctancy to challenge religious beliefs than non-religious beliefs.  That said, maybe I'm wrong, deeply biased, and/or simply an asshole. In that case I do apologise."

Allow me to explain with a slightly more extreme example.  Imagine you are neighbours with a woman whose kid goes to church camp. A few weeks later it comes to light that as it turns out, the kid was repeatedly molested at said camp. Now, obviously, your neighbour understands that while the religion itself doesn't advocate for diddling kids, the way in which it is structured definitely facilitated that. Moreover, the culprit is being relocated to avoid a fuss. Now, you're a religious person as well, but you're alsoempathetic and socially skilled. What do you say to offer consolation? I bet it won't be ""neighbour, what happened is horrible, but I have faith your child will pass through this ordeal unscathed regardless, as long as your faith remains strong. You are in my prayers"".  Now I see I'm definitely overthinking this, but this was my reaction when I read GP going into unnecessary detail about GP's sharing being religious with OP's parents, and offering a religious way of consolation.

At least one of them has a Mom who isn't a religious whack job. I assume they raised you to not fornicate and that is why they (your Mom) hates your SO. I have family that chooses their religion over their children too thinking that choosing what God wants over family makes them like Moses. Obedience to God is paramount and all that. It's horseshit of course but some people have addictive personalities and cling to their religion like a heroin addict to their dealer. Abandoning anyone who gets in the way.

How important is religion to you? Because if you eventually end up marrying your SO and have children, would you want your child to be raised in your religion? Or your SO's? (I don't know how different your religions are.) You're still so young so this may not have even crossed your mind. I think it is more often for children of dual religion parents to become neither when they grow up.   The way your parents acted was very childish. I'm glad you didn't give in to their manipulation. I have a good relationship with my aunt and uncle (and an estranged one from my mom -- a long story). It's definitely nice to have a support system somewhere.

My thinking in this is that the person who can't accept the choice or situation I'm in and then decides that I basically have to choose between them and the other person doesn't get to have their way by controlling me by defining how my relationships with them and other people work. There will always be exceptions or situations that come in to play, but for me I've found that the people who have the most love and acceptance of me won't put unnecessary boundaries and will work at being a part of my life, even if it means dealing with someone or something that they don't fully approve of."

I can see this being a huge issue for some people.   I know i'm going to sound wrong in the eyes of ""politically correct reddit"", but if my daughter brought home a muslim/hebrew/hindu etc. guy (I am born and raised catholic) I would be much less than thrilled. It would essentially mean that if she ever marries said guy she may have to/desire to become a muslim/hebrew/hindu etc. herself.   Now I don't hate muslims/hebrews or hindi, But i would be lying if i said I wouldn't be perturbed  to see my daughter marry one or be with one.  When it comes to religion some people are more bigoted than others. I will admit i am biased towards other religious faiths. I would prefer my children not convert religions. I would prefer they become aetheists rather than muslim/hebrew/hindu etc.  Race isn't an issue for me. But religion is. Downvote away. Just being honest here.   In many cross religious relationships one person 9 times out of ten adopts the religion of the other. and its rarely ever Christianity that is the adopted religion. Some muslim families threaten to kill their children who try to adopt christianity over islam.   So I can definitely understand your parents point of view. They may see your SO as a threat to how they raised you. They may believe he will convert you. It does happen. It can be difficult for two people of differing religions to be together. The beliefs are strong in certain faiths and can cause problems. Maybe if you convinced them that you aren't gong to convert religions with this guy (unless you plan to that is) then I think they may come around. But I strongly suspect this is what your parents are taking issue with.   That being said..  I  want to point out that your family will always be there for you (hopefully)even with this situation that has developed. Your SO may not always be there nor his ""simply amazing"" family. It might not work out between you down the road, who knows? Your parents love you I am sure of this. Ultimately it's your life. You have to choose. IF this guy is important enough to cut contact with your parents that is something you will have to live with. Just consider that if something were to happen to them today or tomorrow would you have regrets?   I would say just make an effort to stay in touch with them and just play it by ear. They may come around and they may not. But the old saying comes to mind  Blood is always thicker than water."

relationships,3e21yy,sunrisesunbloom,23,Tue Jul 21 16:49:30 2015 UTC,"125 pounds is a major life change. Not an issue of weight, especially for someone who used to exercise."
relationships,3e21yy,Earplugs123,8,Tue Jul 21 14:00:10 2015 UTC,"Not just a weight gain, but it sounds like a lifestyle change as well. Going from being athletic daily to staying inside and eating/playing games all the time is huge and even if he hadn't gained any weight, some people would be very unhappy with that kind of shift in priorities."
relationships,3e21yy,Mercuriallly,19,Tue Jul 21 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"If you want to give it one last shot, maybe try framing it differently than you have been. The knowledge that his body repulses you is probably putting him on the defensive, and is making him resentful instead of motivated. It sounds like fitness was something that you two had in common, as a relationship connection and not just a physical one.  Try talking to him about it that way- ""I miss the jogging partner that I fell in love with. I miss having that connection with you, which I just don't feel with your new lifestyle (video games & junk food)."" Ask him if he misses that connection too. Be gentle- being brutally honest hasn't worked before. If he's committed to his new habits, then explain that he's changed too far from the med student you loved and that you need to leave to find a relationship with someone who is on the page as you."
relationships,3e21yy,saralt,19,Tue Jul 21 13:11:07 2015 UTC,"Uhhh, pretty sure your partner putting on 125 POUNDS, and then refusing to do anything about it is an extremely valid reason to break up."

You can like the guy, you can love the guy, but you're a sexual being and if it's like that, then I think that's a death knell.  As far as him not changing, could it be that he felt no need to continue now that he's in a relationship? I've known some people to radically change their behavior once they ""snag"" someone."
relationships,3e21yy,Meatros,22,Tue Jul 21 14:49:34 2015 UTC,"It feels like a very shallow reason to leave someone to me.   OP, it is not a shallow reason to leave someone. Physical attraction is absolutely crucial in a relationship. I'd put it right up there at the top. People who deny this are being disingenuous or naive!     Lots of my friends have told me to accept him how he is or look how beautiful he is on the inside.   They're trying to help you see past his appearance, and keep you together. You definitely should look at how beautiful he is on the inside... but, as I mentioned above, if you don't find him physically attractive then that only goes so far.  125lbs is an insane amount of weight to gain.   May I suggest approaching him one final time about this. Tell him that you love him, you want to be with him, and you want both of you to be happy and healthy. Tell him that can't happen if he carries on the way he is, and something needs to change. Then say you want to work with him to make that change. You both should get in great shape. Fuck it, sign up for a marathon with him there and then. Give yourselves 9 months to get ready for it. Have this conversation in a positive way - don't shout or make him feel bad. He's probably very conscious about his weight and that won't actually help.  To me it sounds as though you don't want to end this relationship, and for that reason I think you should give it one last go. But that should be it - just one last go. If he's not making any effort in, say, a month.... then you know what to do."
relationships,3e21yy,Meatros,61,Tue Jul 21 12:16:14 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't withhold sex or issue ultimatums.  Essentially you are punishing him and I don't think negative reinforcement works. Positive reinforcement does, IIRC.  THAT said, he's gained 125, which is incredibly unhealthy. I'd guess he is depressed as well.  He USED TO exercise and eat better and he just needs to get back to that and stick with it.  Ultimately you can't really do this for him, he's got to do it for himself. I suspect you may have already done this, but you need to have a final conversation with him - he needs to get down to a health weight. You have no intention of watching him die early because of obesity.  If he doesn't, you need to walk out."

relationships,3e21yy,helm,2,Tue Jul 21 12:26:28 2015 UTC,"Have you suggested he see a therapist? 125 sounds enough to be linked to depression, or maybe he's just having difficulty adjusting to the changes in his life.   It's not just about you feeling shallow -- he's hurting himself and your future together. Would you be comfortable raising kids with him? Even if you're planning to be childfree, I think it's a good bearing of the strength of your relationship if you can confidently answer yes. If not, I would recommend therapy for him or as a couple. An outside perspective may also be the push he needs in the right direction."

relationships,3e21yy,RandyPandy,5,Tue Jul 21 11:46:45 2015 UTC,"He needs to be motivated to lose weight, and for future reference don't use sex as a bargaining tool or threat/reward. That kind of attitude can lead to major issues.  Try to talk to him and let him know you are concerned for his health and want to be able to spend many long years with him.    Go read the FAQ on r/loseit.  Do not make this an attack on him or about how you're no longer attracted to him.   Instead you need to lead by example.   Plan some healthier meals together.  Use it as a way to save money from not eating out so much.    Ask him if he'd like to go for a walk and walk together.    The loseit sub can be very inspirational.   I've used it to motivate myself into losing weight and I'm down almost 30 pounds in 3 months.   My wife is now motivated to try to lose some weight as well and has gotten more active with me.   If you want to try to save things just talk with him.  Don't pressure him or push him to hard. He'll feel attacked and shut down.   My wife had pressure coming at her from her parents and it just pissed her off.   I simply told her when she was ready for it I would be there to support her and help her with what worked for me.    How you handle this will show how you will handle other conflict in the future (whether you're with him or someone else).    If you want to save things you need to find the root cause of his lack of desire to lose weight and try to address it.   If that sounds like too much work then the relationship was destined to fail even if he wasn't overweight so end it."

My dad said that he was utterly emaciated during his residency because his hours were so brutal and he spent nearly all the time he wasn't working sleeping, and used jogging for stress relief. He's obese now that he's older, but I've seen pictures of him around that time--and he really does look skeletal. He said by the end of his internship year his scrubs just started falling off him if he didn't belt them with something.  Here I am in med school myself, and I'm terrified of getting fat in my residency."

As someone married to an overweight dude for almost 10 years, I can tell you, that's not going to work. If you really love him, you'll get him into therapy. You'll plan physical activities that you can do together and you'll plan healthy meals together. You'll tell him that his health is important not because of physical attractiveness, but because you're worried about losing him at an early age due to diabetes or cancer or heart disease. You'll tell him that when he lets himself remain unhealthy, it says to you 'I don't care about being with you for a long time'.  I know you two aren't married, so here's where you decide. Do you love him enough to do this? Or is he really just not marriage material, not just because of his weight gain, but because you BOTH can't find a way to move past this argument?"
relationships,3e21yy,pilllogical,10,Tue Jul 21 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"Residency isn't an excuse. It makes it understandable, but it's also not an excuse.  He's a doctor. He knew enough to know that if his exercise dropped off, he needs to watch his calorie intake better. He didn't and he still doesn't. He got fat because he decided to eat like shit for 4 years.  He obviously doesn't want to change for himself since the only time he tried was when you provided immediate gratification. He won't change while you're still in a relationship with him. Get used to the obesity, or leave."

I may not agree with your argument but I'm not going to judge you. Seriously though if you feel this strongly about the situation you need to let him know before it gets out of hand and you really start to despise him. I'd imagine you will fall out of love with him unless he changes, at least give him the chance to change. Stop hinting and be more direct. Explain with the focus on you and how you feel not him and how he is.   So you're likely feeling that he doesn’t care enough to stay healthy and attractive for you. Is there anything you can do to help with his stress or depression. What can you do to help him get more healthy. You want him mentally and emotionally but physically you feel like he doesn’t value you enough to do anything."
relationships,3e21yy,slangwitch,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:54 2015 UTC,You're holding onto him because he is your first when he clearly isn't the right person for you. This happens so often it's hard to believe.  You need more experience and he needs a wake up call. Him being single might actually cause him to fix himself and you would both end up happier with someone else.
relationships,3e21yy,Phteven_j,3,Tue Jul 21 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"Have you considered that he may be depressed? Instead of seeing the situation as him simply being unhealthy/overweight based on lifestyle choices or perceived laziness, with a weight gain of 125 lbs, I'd be willing to bet depression might have something to do with it."
relationships,3e21yy,TheMexican007,5,Tue Jul 21 16:23:53 2015 UTC,"If you are consistently disgusted with having sex with him then don't do it. Not to ""withhold"" in hopes that he change, which is manipulative BS, but because it sounds like that aspect of your relationship is over for you. You shouldn't have sex just to tick a relationship box. You should want to have it the majority of the time, with some leeway for intermittent times where he wants it and you're just impartial but willing. Being disgusted by it, though, is unacceptable. Stop putting yourself through that, but not in order to be manipulative.   Do you think both of you would be okay with maintaining a relationship that is nonsexual? In order to be true to your feelings it sounds like thats the only option, and considering that human nature is to desire and seek sex that probably means a breakup is necessary. Most people can't be happy in (preventably)  sexless relationships, even if they love their partner.   If this were due to a horrible illness or accident that he had no control over I think it would be a bit more possible to deal with a period of sexlessness, but he's created the issue through bad habits and hasn't addressed it so it sounds like you have to base your decision on whether you can deal with nothing changing and no desire for sex in your relationship for the foreseeable future.   He really should see a doctor to rule out mental and physical illnesses though as that is an extreme weight gain."

Flip the tables for a second and ask - If you had a serious issue which caused your partner not to be attracted to you, would you be helped by ultimatums and withholding sex?   Perhaps help him out and find counselling for him.  Edit: I figure I'll get downvoted, because what I'm suggesting is one of those classic MRA arguments, but hey, I don't generally post to /r/relationships, so I thought what the hell. But that said, in any relationship that sort of activity is NOT okay, and it's just as healthy for him to leave as for her to do so."

It's your relationship and you're the one who suffers if you aren't happy.  Massive weight gain is def a legitimate reason to end a relationship. He might be the nicest bloke on the planet and if that's the case you can just be friends. You don't have to keep having sex with someone who you aren't attracted. Break it off.
relationships,3e21yy,ZackariahL,3,Tue Jul 21 16:19:23 2015 UTC,"Basically, I think the rules for this type of thing go like this:   You should have a reasonable expectation that your partner will maintain the level of physical fitness they had when you got together. If something happens and causes them to become less fit, a compassionate understanding partner will let them know that this making them less attractive (in the eyes of their partner). Give them some period (6 months, a year) to change. If they can't or won't, you have to consider moving on.   Trying to strong-arm him into losing weight is not going to help anybody. He understands your position and he's not doing anything about it. Do you want to spend the rest of your life with someone you're not physically attracted to?   Last thing: it's possible that a break-up might inspire him to get back in shape. Don't get dumper's remorse. If that's the reason he got fit, he'll probably put the weight back on once he's thinks he's in a secure relationship again."

I say give the guy one more shot. The most serious ultimatum. Be completely honest about how you're feeling and lay out a strict deadline for him to lose X amount of LBS. This way there is no gray area. It may seem harsh, but it will let you know right away if he takes you seriously and is committed to your relationship. It sounds like you've taken the nice route already and that did not work.  Now, if you are already checked out then just move on as hard as that may be.

If you indeed love him more than anything else, I don't think this should be the end, there could be way worse things, God forbids, but as least he is not missing a limb or anything from an accident, it's still reversible. Would you stop being with him if one day he has an accident and loses a leg? Sex could always wait a bit. I think being able to stay with your first in everything is very precious that not everyone can have, I don't think you should just give up because there's a temporary problem.

In the former case, regardless of if you break up with him, get him some help and/or implore him to. In the latter case, it's seems clear there's an incompatibility and you have made that clear enough to him-- if he won't strive to make the relationship work as much as you have then you cannot sustain the imbalance of effort."

You have expressed the problem, he has expressed an unwillingness to change, and you can't keep staying miserable just because of something you guys had in the past. He's also your first boyfriend so there's a lot you simply don't realize yet and you're blinded by that. Anyway arguing every day and avoiding sex is no kind of relationship."
relationships,3e21yy,Kheran,2,Tue Jul 21 10:42:10 2015 UTC,"It isn't shallow. This isn't just about weight gain and how attracted you are to him. It's about lifestyle choices. Who wants to date someone who chooses to put unhealthy crap into their body and only play video games in their spare time? You're never going to agree on what to do together in your free time. You'll want to go for a hike and he won't be physically able to. He'll want to try some heart attack food restaurant and you won't be interested.  This isn't just about having sex. It's about being on the same page in your relationship. Why would you want to put time into a relationship with a guy who won't be able to physically keep up and has a risk of dying early in life due to his unhealthy choices? If he's not respecting himself, why should you?  Also, in 4 years, he gained the weight of a small person. That's not easy to do if you're in the right state of mind. Clearly he's got some issues and honey, at this point, it's not your job to fix them."

You shouldn't look at your partner with resentment, nor should you loathe sex with the person you love. For what it's worth, if my partner gained that much weight, I'd break things off too. I couldn't be with a person who ignores the body that badly.  From the sounds of it, he's not going to change things up. Honestly, it sounds like you two are done."

I would understand if he put on some pounds during the stress of residency and then wanted to get back into shape, but the fact that he carries on with the same behavior means he's changed.

I know how hard it is to pull the trigger when you love practically everything about a person except their changed appearance and how frustrating it is to see them put ZERO effort into changing (or at least getting somewhat closer to where they were when the relationship started).  It really boils down to two things:  1) Will he EVER change?  2)  If the answer to #1 is yes or he is trying, then how long are you willing to tread water and do the whole dead bedroom thing?  If the answer to #1 is no, then you have to leave.  If the answer is yes, but the process is slow going or up and down and goes beyond what you have the patience for, you have to leave.  This will not be easy and it's not supposed to be easy, but moving on is better in the big picture than being unhappy for another 5 years."

I tried my best to work things out, but he just really didn't care. Sometimes he would complain about it, but never did anything to change. Actually, most times he would complain and then go get a snack. He tried therapy, but stopped after he lost 30 pounds because he said he was better and then just gained it back and refused to go back to therapy. He was never going to go back to being the same person. It got to the point where his entire car was filled with fast food wrappers and he constantly had food in his hand and dishes next to the bed. He stopped helping around the house, but constantly wanted sex and then have me wait on him hand and foot so he could watch tv and eat until he fell asleep. Anyway, I was ranting. Have a chat with him about his lifestyle. If he does the ""get better for a week and then revert"" routine, he doesn't care, has changed, and you either have to live with it, or leave."

You said he was not like that before so there must be something wrong and he needs YOU especially to be beside him during these times. You wouldn't want to force him into doing things out of hatred (not with you for leaving him with that reason) towards himself.  Maybe he's just enjoying his time out of serious stuff like your med job and working out.

With domestic violence, the charges are pressed BY THE STATE, not by the individuals involved.  You have a right to not incriminate yourself. DON'T ADMIT TO ANYTHING. You WILL be arrested if you admit to hitting her under ANY circumstances, including self-defense. I wouldn't make any kind of a statement to police - anything you say will probably be used against you, especially during cross-examination by the prosecution.  If you seriously injured her, you're in for a rough time, regardless of the circumstances. If you have any injuries, document them immediately - including any blood from your nose that could have gotten on to your shirt.  I wouldn't recommend getting the police involved AT ALL, honestly. It could turn out extremely badly, and it doesn't sound like either of you had significant injuries. If she threatens you with police action, let her know that you're happy to tell them about how she and her friends chased you down and she hit you, and that women are equally punished in the legal system for domestic violence as men are - it's not true that police always go after the man.

You need to get yourself into therapy, ASAP. Cut contact with her, her friends, etc. and focus on bettering yourself, because you are as big of a mess as she is."

relationships,3e3ao3,SayceGards,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"Please google getting hit in the head while drunk. You don't even have to hit a person that hard for it to effect them as if they were hit much harder. Her being drunk likely contributed as much to her injuries as her being hit back by OP.   No he isn't as culpable as she is. He was being attacked and surrounded by her friends who didn't even step in to end the situation while he was begging her to stop. I don't understand why people expect him to be more self aware in the situation when he was the one who was chased down, attacked repeatedly and kept from leaving the situation. It's not easy to restrain a drunk person hell bent on attacking you, especially while they have an audience where one is encouraging it and the others are standing around blocking you from going any where.   Drunk people aren't rational and after she decided it was cool to make out with an ex in front of him, it's obvious this woman was probably so far gone she was going to keep doing damage until she wore herself out.   It's unfortunate she got hurt, but he didn't actively keep attacking her. It's easy to say he could have restrained himself after the fact but it's an entirely different story when you are in that situation and being attacked while others are actively keeping you there in the situation while you are trying to leave."

They will be more concerned with your ex and her safety if she decides to go to the police.    If you have any injuries,  make sure to take pictures.   Otherwise,  ditch all the ""friends"" that think you did something wrong. If you're a monster for defending yourself but your ex isn't because she's a woman,  then these people aren't really your friends. It may be tempting to tell everyone the truth, but do not do this without talking to a lawyer first."

You're stronger than her and you knew that. You knocked her out. That's not defending yourself that's fighting. Defending would have been if you restrained her or walked away or simply just pushed her away. But you didn't. Both of you should be charged with assault and battery.

They were both bleeding and she seems to have done a lot more damage than he did. He didn't even defend himself until he had no choice.  I don't think he should be charged with assault and battery. She started punching, kicking and  attacking him until he started bleeding. He was being blocked in by her friends, one was encouraging it and none of them attempted to stop her while she repeatedly kicked him and even punched him in the head.    Hell she cheated in front of his face, then decided it was cool to chase him down and attack him for not standing there and taking it. At some point you should be allowed to protect yourself after you beg someone to stop and repeatedly try to walk away."

She got up from the slap, scratched his face and punched him in the head. If she stayed on the ground from the first slap, then yes he's absolutely done enough to extricate himself from the situation. But she got up and assaulted him again. Ergo, he has not defended himself enough because she continued her assault.  After she was down on the ground the second time, when her friends were probably tending to her and no longer blocking OP's path, he ran home. It's like you're literally picking and choosing individual words from the OP to read and retain or something, or just straight up ignoring the fact that she continued assaulting him."

He could've restrained her, could've ran, could've screamed bloody murder until someone came to help him, could've pushed her on her ass (IMO that's true self-defense), etc. The fact of the matter is that if she was attacking him the entire time, it didn't seriously incapacitate him. Two hits from him brought her to the ground both time. He's obviously stronger, he could've handled this without escalating the violence.

Pushing someone to get out of a situation is defending/avoiding the conflict.  He is allowed to defend himself, but punching her so hard she blacks out is not defense, it's a counter attack.   He could've pushed past and ran."

In your mind, does this rule this apply to all assault situations even between two males, or only between one female and one male? Why are you quantifying this?"
relationships,3e3ao3,Usernamechosennow,-3,Tue Jul 21 17:58:07 2015 UTC,"Punching =/= pushing. Please read what I'm saying again. I don't think hitting anyone is acceptable, male or female, and he could've restrained her/pushed her by the shoulders to move her out of his way. Hitting is not fucking okay. He escalated the violence by slapping her to the ground, then punching her so hard she was incapacitated. He could've killed her, dude.  And think of it this way - he was obviously strong enough to knock her down twice. When a chihuahua bites a German Shepard, he's still biting, which is wrong. If a German Shepard bites back, bye bye chihuahua. You still have two bitten dogs, but the outcome is different."

HE escalated the assault (violence) initiated by Ex by slapping her (instead of knocking her out instantly which he restrained himself from doing), therefore HE is in the wrong. That's what you're saying?  Yeah, GF could have been killed. That's the type of risk someone takes when they assault someone unprovoked."

Reality is bills, rent and food. She chose not to go when you were available and has chosen not to involve others.  She's also going through a really awful and stressful time right now. I would suggest that you give her a few options that are ok for you. Check the hours of the clinic that she wants to go to. If they do evenings and weekends, text/call her and ask her if she can reschedule. Suggest that if she can do the weekend then you can take care of her better.

Your friend made the choice to avoid the consequence that would affect her most, in favor of complicating your life, because she knows she can count on you. This was a selfish decision on her part.   I will avoid making a judgement of your friend here, because I think it's obvious.  You can be a good friend and still look out for yourself, which I think you should do in this instance.

Tell the coworker to leave him alone or he will go to HR. Go to HR if necessary to report all repeat incidents.   Hopefully the girl isn't crazy enough to try and cry wolf to HR, but if she seems like a liability then it is a good step.   The key point here if HR will be involved is to get everything in writing. It's very hard for HR to take any kind of action if complaints aren't formalized in writing, and this will help them deal with the coworker if that becomes necessary."

relationships,3e1ab8,earnestadmission,116,Tue Jul 21 16:09:12 2015 UTC,"You aren't being a spoiled brat and it sounds like your mother has some kind of savior syndrome where she feels like she's earning her place in heaven by being a martyr to the care of a person who belongs in professional hands.  You've been neglected in your care and emotional well-being in favor of a stranger and sadly, there isn't much you can do about that.  I know you said some things to your mother that upset her and being atheist is very much like being gay.  Coming out can have serious consequences and I urge you to reconsider your actions right now.  Your parents have all the ability in the world to deny you the escape to a college and your opportunities for higher learning.  They can simply refuse to give you their tax information for the FAFSA, which would make things incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for you in obtaining funding for school.  You aren't going to talk your mother out of doing what she feels is her ""Christian duty"", so my advice to you is to contact the organization that set up this diabolical situation.  When you contact them, ask them if you can rely on them for complete confidential anonymity and if they assure you that this is so, you can tell them that you are being neglected, the woman's care is far beyond what your mother can handle, and you are concerned for your own well-being and with the fact that your mother will not concede that Sarah needs a higher level of care and professional support.  Tell them about the verbal abuse, the unhygienic surroundings, and that you fear for your safety and do not believe that a minor child should be exposed to this kind of environment.  Ask them what evidence they need to provide proper placement for this woman and go from there.  If they will not allow you to remain confidential and handle this with care, please talk to your pastor.  I know you're an atheist, but he is the most likely person to have your mother's ear.  Play nice and tell him that you believe that your mental and emotional well-being are at stake and that your mother is choosing to continue this path despite the harm it is doing to you.  Explain to him that you are concerned about the repercussions of coming to him with this problem, that you've prayed over it, and that you received guidance and courage in coming to him despite the fact that it may result in you being turned out of your home and being denied assistance in continuing your education.  Tell him you trust him and will pray that he can come up with a solution that will enable this poor soul to get the care she needs and to resolve the discord that has come up in your home.  Tell him about the cursing, the violence, the danger you feel you are in and assure him that you want to help people, but you're just a kid and you feel like something is very wrong here.  Hopefully he can intercede with your mother and give her a charity mission that doesn't result in your isolation and emotional neglect.  If these two options don't pan out, you should talk to a school counselor about everything and ask them for their advice on the matter.  See what they say about the possibility of your parents not providing tax information for the FAFSA and if there are any ways to get around this.  I've heard that there might be and it might also be worth a try to talk to the university's financial aid department about your unique situation.  This might come down to having CPS get involved and relocating you to an empathetic friend's parents house, a relative, your siblings, or a foster home.  All of which sound FAR better than the hell you're going through at home.  Good luck to you and stay strong, even if you have to face one more year of this madness, you can say you made it through and never look back if you don't want to."

Whilst a teenager he would routinely cut himself and end up in a psychiatric ward.  He was diagnosed bipolar, but decided he doesn't need medication after some point when it wasn't possible to force him to take medication.  My other siblings and I, as well as my father, all expressed that he should not be living at home.  My mother couldn't bring herself to put him in an inpatient facility.  She failed to see how he was negatively affecting everyone else, including herself.  My parents nearly divorced, and now approximately a decade later I'm really not sure why my father didn't leave.  However I can't really respect my mother anymore.  I try to limit interactions with her as much as possible.  I know that when it really comes down to it, she doesn't care about me.  My father was on my side, as were my other siblings.  Since I've moved out of their house, I've gone on vacations with my siblings one-on-one, and I've done the same with my father.  But I will not do that with my mother and I do not initiate contact with her.  This is essentially the same position OP is in, except the lack of care of OP is even more explicit because her mother is choosing a stranger over her own daughter.

Yes, they might want to talk to your mother about child endangerment or abandonment...but she's edging towards guilty in that regard.  If things have settled by tomorrow, call the agency that handles Sarah's account/contract directly, and tell them about your situation - you belong there, not (necessarily) the patient - and you believe your mother is unfit to continue as caregiver of this patient. Again, if you are CALM BUT FIRM, they should understand, and start to process a change in the living dynamic for all three of you.  If this strains your relationship with your mother, so be it. She's not prioritizing her functions as a mother over that as a caregiver, and that's unacceptable. You've got the 24-hour McDonalds as fallback, and give us an update if you have another problem.

It truely sounds like your mother is not fit for this job. I'm a special education teacher and have worked with students like Sarah- it's not easy and if your mother isn't properly trained or qualified, she could be hurting Sarah more than helping.   I think, since your mother isn't responding to your needs as reason to move on from this job, that you should tackle it as you feel that Sarah is not being adequately cared for and she should inform the company that Sarah would be safer and happier in a home that has the resources and care she needs. It sounds like your mother took the job as a means to gain money without considering the actual lifestyle you needed to adopt. It also sounds like she is justifying it now as a duty, something she is obligated to do, instead of something she wants to do.   I'm so sorry that you feel like you've lost time, friends, and opportunities. I know the feeling and it really sucks. The best advice I can give to that is to not give up on your top choice for college! Chances are the tour guide was a student that sees a ton of faces a day and doesn't have any pull in the decision. Still apply, still pursue other colleges, and if someone makes a comment to you about your visit, which I'm almost 100% sure won't happen, then forget them. There's literally 1000s of other people at college who you can get to know instead. As for friends, this might be a time to tell your school friends what's up. If any of them drive, they can get you from your house. They could help you escape. Explain very simply that your mother took in an adult with special needs and you are unable to have other over or freely leave the house. Don't go into crazy detail, just keep it to the important info and see if they can help you out. Maybe even get a job that you can bike to.   Last but not least, please please please talk to your schools counselor and tell them what's up. Tell them what happens daily, calmly and not over dramticized, and how your mother reacts. Give details on what you have discussed with your mom and what happened tonight. Talk to anyone that will hear you out- teachers, school nurses, social workers etc. When you go to college, talk to a therapist. You don't want or have to carry this resentment your entire life. It doesn't mean you have to talk to your mom or tell her ""it's okay"" because it's not, but bitterness and resentment will eat away at you. Its best to learn how to overcome those feelings early and move on with your life with a positive outlook.   I hope this helps!!"

Enduring these 2 crazy bitches is nothing compared to the gruelling job search you'd have to go through to find a minimum wage job that wouldn't even pay for anything except food. Disclaimer: you might need to call police to uphold the 2 laws mentioned above against your mother. Just do it, she doesn't mean anything to you anyway, so don't worry about any discomfort you might cause her    You've been dealt a shit hand in life, and you will have to deal with it for a few more years until something changes for the better. Don't jump into colleges and massive student loans for some art degree just so you can live your life easily for 4 years. 8 bucks per hour vs 8 bucks per hour with 50-100k debt? Try to get into STEM field where you can find jobs easily (engineering) if you do want to go down that route"

Rather than just assuming you have to be an engineer to get a job, look at the many many many possible careers that a college degree can get you. The entire financial sector is a cash cow, and there are a lot of medical tech jobs (both in operation and maintenance) that will only be in higher demand. Management is difficult to start in, unless you get into a good college, but business programs are just as likely to have placement assistance as are engineering programs.   It is entirely possible to get a good job without being an engineer, and one that you are passionate about is not an extravagance to be tossed aside. Rather, passion for your field of study is likely to save you additional years of school as you return to get training for a new job!"

If they talk about christian duty, ask how many people with mental disabilities smear their faeces in their bathroom and if they can have her in their home for a few days so you can have a break, Most will then suddenly have a pile of excuses but might then have some ideas to support you.   The other option is seeing a counselor at your school as they are often linked into support services for teens with home issues.

Longer term, talk to you school counselor about just going to a community college next year as you last year in high school. In Florida, taking classes are free until the summer after you graduate from college. In Florida, if you earn your AA from a cc, then you are guaranteed to get into a state college for your bachelors. Also, most universities will allow you to transfer some credits from outside institutes. so it is frugal to take as many classes as you can at a CC.  If you need help deciding what to study, I recommend going to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.

Emergency shelters and women's shelters more than likely qualify as well due to your age.

Not of your own feelings, because this is a massively unfair situation for you to be in. Your mother should be embarrassed. She's trashing your physical and mental health so she can feel like a good person. She isn't.  But also, don't be embarrassed to return to the college. Shame is a deeply irrational feeling in general, and springs up in situations where it makes no sense. You've done nothing wrong, and when people see mentally ill people in public, they understand that the families/caretakers are in an impossible position (though in your mother's case, it's some self-inflicted martyrdom, but they don't know that).  My advice to you about college, in fact, is to own this experience. In fact, write an essay on it. College admissions essays are a really bizarre institution: they want to hear about adversity in your life, and the harsher and more novel the adversity, the better. It's pretty shitty and exploitative, but that's what it is. The school already knows about this situation, and it's already taken a harsh toll on the last two years of your life, so you might as well leverage it to get you the hell out of there with a hefty scholarship."

relationships,3e1ab8,attemptnumber12,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:09:25 2015 UTC,"You're not being selfish, or a brat. Your mother has decided that she's going to take care of a mentally disabled person and that's a huge decision. Sure, someone needs to do it and the disabled need to be taken care of, but taking on that responsibility for yourself is a huge decision and a big deal. There's nothing wrong with your mother's decision on its own, except that she has a child who had to live with the implications of that lifestyle. It is not easy living with someone who smears shit on the walls. Your reaction is perfectly understandable.   Honestly, I think your mother is being selfish. I don't know what her motivations are for keeping this woman around, other than that she needs money and wants to help someone in need. But she could earn money another way, and she can help people in need without taking on the responsibility of personally caring for a person that mentally handicapped. If she thinks it's her duty as a Christian to care for the needy, she can do so in other ways, so that's just a bullshit excuse.   She's not taking your feelings into consideration and that's incredibly selfish of her. She also kicked you out of the house at 17. No one deserves that. You aren't in a position legally or financially to take care of yourself. You rely on her and her alone and she's betrayed you by not caring about your feelings and kicking you out when you have literally no other options. You're a minor, and you're her daughter. All you wanted was some peace. This is absolutely unacceptable. Don't let the voice of guilt make you think you're being unreasonable. Would you tell someone else they were being selfish if they couldn't handle living with a mentally handicapped person who shit themselves and screamed in public? No. So don't tell yourself that.  Other people's advice here seems sound, and I have little to add to their advice. Just do what you have to do to take care of yourself. When you get back to your mom's house, just lay low and get out as soon as you're 18. It's clearly not a stable and reliable environment and not good for your mental health. It's clear your mother won't watch out for your wellbeing, so you have to watch out for it yourself. Stay strong."

What I see is since your Stepdad lost his job which nearly broke your finances and then got a lower paying job your Mom has done what she could to keep your home and family together. Actually, I applaud her tenacity. However, the patient she has is not appropriate for your home and should NEVER have been placed there. NEVER. Is she a nurse because she should have to be to care for someone this involved. And putting a person like this with children is really foolish. Sounds like they put the most inappropriate person in her care because she was foolish to accept that responsibility. Never doubt the desire of these organizations to off load problem patients to unqualified people if they think they can get away with it, because its cheaper than a nursing home which is clearly where she belongs. Now the exact problem is that your Mom refuses to engage the agency that put this person there to send her to a proper place and get a new placement. Im guessing it was a religious organization that is laying this load of crap and guilt on her about it being ""christian"". And she is buying it.   I can understand you feeling upset, hurt, and disrespected in your own home. This women is abusive, however I doubt she is doing this from her own abuse as a child. She is in extreme dementia, or some other issue. This is how they act when far along. But I would ask that you understand that she did this to save your family. You need to speak to her and explain that this is not okay, that its not okay for her to forsake her children for this specific patient. That its okay to ask to switch to a less violent, more reasonable patient that needs help. And be firm about it. As to the college issue, its not uncommon for people of your age to think that they are being judged so harshly. But people dont judge those things. So please dont feel embarrassed, etc. What do you think they thought? That you are a horrible person unworthy of the school? Do you think they ran around saying, ""LOL how can that kid expect to go here?"". No. No one is thinking twice about it. So let that go. Its your actions that reflect on you, not other peoples. So, that is something you will have to learn either way in life. You need to know that to grow up and be happy. Im sorry its happening this way. But people dont judge you like you think they do.   I recommend you approach your Mom. Im sure to her she is doing what she can to keep her home and family together. She isnt doing it to be evil or punish you. I highly doubt what you describe is ""Fun"" for her. She is under stress, has made a decision, and is trying to uphold it. That said, its not acceptable. You mention older siblings, have you spoken to them about this?  And I doubt your Mom is throwing you out for good. Like you said, she just wanted you away so you could clear your mind. I think you should go back and talk to your Mom. Talking means like a grown up. No screaming, no accusations or blame. The point is to come to a resolution not blame people or threaten people. When you do that, chances are she will respond. Its at that point where you discuss with a school counselor if she refuses to ask for a new patient.  Dont threaten her with that, tho. Nothing makes people less likely to respond to your requests more than being threatened."

Use apps like Meetup, to meet new people who share interests; similar as yours. Tell people about you being from another country. People who care, would try to make extra efforts and make you feel comfortable. Try taking classes for things that you like (cooking, baking, knitting, etc.). That's a great place to meet new people. If you can spare some time, enrol yourself as a volunteer in a club/ NGO. You'd always find new people there, who you can become friends with.   This could be a start.

Frequently, those who already have lots of friends and social circles around just don't have the interest or energy to actively establish new friendships - they're not against making new friends and might generally find newcomers fun and pleasant, but they're not going to go out of their way to invite new people when they have a lot of others already.   In short, I think the onus is going to be on you to initiate, at least until you meet someone who eventually reciprocates. :) And do check to see if local custom means that ""we should hang out sometime!"" is genuine interest or just something everyone mouths - that seems to vary by locale."

You can invite married people over with their partner (and kids).

I'd suggest asking her where she sees this relationship going. Have a conversation about relationship goals.   Explain that an adult relationship is between two people....not two people and their parents.   When does she see herself moving out...getting married etc.   Explain your feelings on this...how you feel when she has to get parent permission. It sounds like you're wanting to date an independent adult...tell her this.  The outcome of the conversation should tell you if its worth continuing or not.

relationships,3e2g42,randomAnonymousThing,24,Tue Jul 21 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"Hey man, so I dated (and now married) an italian girl. We started at 17 so I know exactly where you're coming from.  Hid the relationship for close to 2 years, and was another 2 years before we really got some 'freedom' in what we did.   I think you need to understand and respect their culture a bit more,  IF you want a shot at a future. I have seen firsthand how close an italian family can be and how rigid a lot of their expectations are (no sleepovers, not a ton of contact, etc). You have to keep in mind - especially given how young you two are - that her parents will be a massive part of your life for a long, long time. I'd advise against rocking the boat.  However, I would (and did) approach things straight-forward. Take her parents out for drinks, or better yet, bring over some wine, and ask them what their expectations are. You haven't really stated how your relationship with her parents is, aside from the obvious cockblocking, so it's tough to know if they accept you (not that they need to.. but you know) or understand that you could be in this for the long haul. I think if you voice your opinion and let them know you're serious about their daughter, and willing to respect some of their 'rules', you might find yourself with a lot more freedom. We ended up seeing more eye to eye and having a much better relationship afterwards (me and her parents, as well as me and her directly).  Again, that's only what worked for me, but I do know how strong/rigid the Italian culture can be when it comes to relationships and showing a clear sign of respect can go a long way. I don't want to sound like you have to 'give in' to her parents, but, I also don't see it as 'giving in' if it strengthens your relationship..   just my 2 cents - good luck!"
relationships,3e2g42,YoungJolie,6,Tue Jul 21 14:46:21 2015 UTC,"So much this!  You need to understand how important family and respect are in Italian culture. You never date/marry the person, you date/marry the family.   It's all about face for Italians. Are you Italian? That might be a factor as well. ( Have you seen the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding? That's what it's like but Italian. )  I agree that you should take them out. Try taking them out to dinner and invite any of her siblings if she has any. Depending on where you live, take them out to a comedy show (bonus points if it's a comedian like Joe Avati or Sebastian Maniscalo, typical Italian comedians) or a play. See what they're into and use that as a way to gain their trust. When you go over her house bring something like wine or better yet pastries.   I can tell you that her parents will always be in your lives. I'm in my late 20s, female and Italian. I live in a different city than my parents and live with my boyfriend. My parents are still very much in my life. If your girlfriend is the one you want to be with then you need to accept this.   Also, please remember that this is very hard on your girlfriend too. She is probably under a lot of pressure from both sides."

relationships,3e2g42,cupcakeartist,8,Tue Jul 21 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"That's tough man. On the one hand it sounds like everything is fine in the relationship, except for her parents.  The question you have to ask yourself is this: If this is the ONE, like, you're going to marry her some day, is that going to back them off, or make them more involved than they are now? Is she going to let them have a say in YOUR life if you decide to hitch yourself to this woman?  After 3 years, personally, I would be done with it. It's a hard thing to do, but you need to get your girlfriend to claim her independence from her parents, or you need to leave. If she's not willing to do that, and you're at a point where you need more out of the relationship (be that more intimacy, or you want her to move in), then you need to leave her. If she really cares about you, she'll figure out that its not the end of the world to tell her parents no.  Think of it this way. Assume you and her parents are in an argument, and neither side will budge, and its something that is really important to you. The deciding factor is your girlfriend. Knowing that the ending result is not life or death, but still very important, does your girlfriend side with you, or does she side with her parents? How does this result make you feel? Think about it, and I think that should tell you what you want to know."

If this is how she is when you're dating, imagine how she would be when you're married. She'd still listen to her parents and choose them over you. If you want kids, your kids will be raised the way your in-laws wanted, not the way you wanted.   You already made your feelings known, and she already showed you that she is willing to let her parents control her life even at the expense of your relationship.

My friend has struggled with them her entire life and at the end of the day, while she is still dependent on them, there is nothing she can do.

The second attack on my son, pushed me to take that step. This is real, and started to feel scary. What happens in a few years?    She's an angry teenager lashing out at her deadbeat dad. She didn't ""attack"" your son. The insult wasn't directed at a toddler who's never done anything to harm her. She most likely resents him for being the golden child who was lucky enough to have his father's love and support, but it's you who's the object of her fury.  One day, your beloved son is going to become an individual who isn't all smiles and Kodak moments and unconditional love, just like your unfortunate daughter. Maybe then your son will be a ""unnecessary drama"" and ""sunk costs"" too. But even if that doesn't happen, some day that boy will find out he has a sister. He's going to know that you refused to take responsibility for her or even acknowledge her existence. And that's going to dramatically change the way he feels about you as his father, knowing that you consider your children disposable if they're enough of an inconvenience."

I'm saying this because everything that you've done surrounding this situation is so twisted and selfish and sad. You're fucking delusional.

There's two avenues here, and r/relationships is going to suggest the latter:  1) Talk it out; tell her she can't talk to this guy (could it be her boss?) and have your relationship continue. As long as you're okay with her getting this close to infidelity, and she apologizes, you'll consider this a bump in the road later on...OR  2) She's already checked out of the relationship and it's time to throw her ass to the curb.  Number 2 is the more realistic choice: there's a decent chance she's cheated on you already while you've been out of town.  There's a 100% chance you need to get your dick checked.  There's a 95% chance you need to kick her ass out and tell her you're through.  With a relationship that's been going this long, you need to have an honest discussion. Remember, you hold all the cards."

His was fine and clear   Chlamydia would not be present in a blood sample.  I'm sure you tested positive after a Pap- test (swab from your vagina). You could have had chlamydia this entire time with no symptoms. You BF may have it as well and should see his PCP about submitted a urine sample and penile swab for testing.

Maybe you could get a note from your doctor explaining that the virus could remain dormant and undetectable for some time--the fact that you tested negative a few months ago seems to support the fact that you did not cheat.  On a different note, I think you may have some issues to address in your relationship that have nothing to do with the std situation.  You only text your boyfriend? He's all you need? That sounds pretty unhealthy. Even people with wonderful partners need a social life outside of their relationship. If you invest everything you have in this person and the relationship ends, you're going to need to rebuild your other relationships you ignored during your time with bf from scratch. Sorry, but if my boyfriend only texted me I would find that to be a huge turnoff and an indicator of huge co-dependency and self esteem issues."

There's a lot of effort put into the ""clean catch"" usually, with the sealed, sanitary cup, sanitary wipes, etc. It's important.   How to deal with your SO: Get him tested too, and tell the doctor about your sexual history. Ask him/her how this could have happened. Relay that to your SO, or have him come with and get tested at the same time. That's all you can do. Give him the honest truth, hope for the best."

If you just want to get out of the house and she is hosting a party at least there would be other people there to talk to and meet, so it might be worth it just to go even if that means you don't hang out with the host that much afterwards."

Thats how I feel now that I've noticed she turns almost every convo back on herself.  I still like her, she is cool and interesting, but she is super self-centered."
relationships,3e2mom,Tea_cakes,4,Tue Jul 21 14:16:17 2015 UTC,"I sounds like you might also be a passive conversation partner as well. You put that blurb there at the end that you have a lot going on in your life, but did you mention any of it out loud to her? She was probably waiting for you to broach the topics on your own.  Some people don't like to talk about what's going on in their life because they're either very private or things are not going well and they don't want to bring it up, so I usually let them bring up life topics. Some people are not great conversationalists so the only way they can keep up a flowing conversation is to talk about something that is relatable - which is usually themselves.    You are critical of her part, but do your own part? You have the ability to steer conversations and broach different topics as well. To simply rely on the whole ""well it's polite to ask about the other person"" isn't going to serve you well if the other person doesn't realize they're being rude. If you're lonely and short on friends - it won't hurt you to try out a friendship with this woman and maybe be more proactive in conversations."

Like for example, when my FIL passed away, I told her and her reply was ""oh well if you ever need anyone to talk to, my FIL has a chronic illness and it's been really hard and blah...""  Topic of conversation immediately changed to how hard it is to take a vacation with someone with a chronic illness in your travel circle."

I don't think she's really capable of handling harder stuff so she changes the topic really quick. All in all you might be better off finding other friends, and maybe speaking with a therapist about the things you feel weighed down by.  If you're friend hunting and you don't have any close friends, heavy topics aren't really ideal to unload on people you're not intimate with."

That's...really bad. There are obviously intimate details about your relationship that you shouldn't share with others but this kind of blanket prohibition is a giant red flag.  She also seems very judgmental about your activities. She disapproves of your video gaming, but if you were reading - and still not interacting with her - that would be fine. She's also vetoed your other suggestions (and her reaction that you were ""taking shots at her weight"" by suggesting pretty normal activities is a bad sign all around).  The solution is what it usually is: talk to her. Ask her why she wants the gaming time to get cut down. If it is to spend more time doing ""together"" things, ask her what she has in mind beyond reading silently in the same room, and tell her that seems like neither a ""together"" thing nor something you think is fun. Be ready for her to tell you she feels the same way about gaming with you.  If you can't reach a middle ground you can both live with maybe it's time to call it a day and end the relationship."

Though you may assume that she enjoys the games, it may not be the reality.  She may believe that she has compromised for you for a long time and would like to see it reciprocated.  I gamed a lot when I met my wife and we came to deal that I could do it 2-3 nights a week but the others were for us.  If you simply stop gaming to do more music, it is not a compromise.  She is right to ask for more time to do things that both of you may like.  You don't have to look at it as giving up your music or games.  6 years later, I still game but I don't miss the marathon sessions and I came to find some new activities that were fun with her.  I would never have tried the new things if I never made any time for them.    A relationship is about compromise and how both people approach and apply it.  It may be time for you to take a look at how you spend your time in different perspective and make a decision of what is more important to you."

We cook, watch shows, visit friends and family, go to dinner, go out on the town, and volunteer at our church together. Between all of those things she is saying that we don't have anything that we do together. I'm guessing this activity would fill the slot where I get stuck watching her work on her projects and watch TV because she doesn't want me to play guitar or video games. We spend nearly all of our time together."

You're setting up a dangerous power dynamic in this relationship by not asserting yourself and setting clear boundaries.  You can still love her and have a good relationship with her without conceding to everything she wants or caving when she gets upset with your unwillingness to do as she says.  She's not your mother or your master, she's your partner and if you can't communicate, compromise, and retain your own identity in this relationship...you should probably reconsider it or face living a lifetime of resentment if you decide to marry her.  This is the kind of relationship people rebel from when they get sick of it, which usually has disastrous effects."

relationships,3e38gs,TheFeelsMachine,6,Tue Jul 21 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"Hey there! So like you maybe 1-2 years ago I was in the SAME exact position. I went on dates and was basically learning the dating game. I do have some advice and I think it's awesome that you found a girl that you really like and are into - it's a great feeling! I'll use my current girlfriend as an example because she is the one I dated for a pretty good amount of time until she became exclusive with me.  How long ago did you talk to her last? Generally speaking, I always tried to talk to my current GF every day or two when I was dating her. It was a good way to keep a connection going and also a way to learn more about her without having to be on a date with her. When it comes to how often you should be going on a date, I would say maybe 1 time every week. It doesn't always have to be an event, some weeks you could just invite her to go to dinner with you. Not sure about your financial situation, but I would highly suggest you pay. It's just something I learned over the years that even just offering to buy her a drink will make her feel good.   One thing I can say for sure is always try to talk to her every week at a minimum. Always text her after a date and let her know how much fun you had and ALWAYS say that you want to do it again within a week in that same conversation. If there's one thing I learned, it's that girls sometimes feel they are put in the friend zone if you don't say certain things. Definitely compliments too!   1) Text her every week (at a minimum) 2) Offer to pay the bill or offer to buy her a drink 3) Compliment her when you see her. You can simply say, ""You look great today"" 4) Flowers go a long way, even if you haven't been dating a long time 5) Show your interest romantically to make sure you are not going to be in the friend zone. Make sure she realizes you like her as more than a friend!"
relationships,3e38gs,SportsOnly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:02:16 2015 UTC,"So when you were dating you contacted her every other day or so?  That sounds a little much, but interesting"
relationships,3e38gs,SportsOnly,3,Tue Jul 21 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean the whole point of dating her in the first place is with the goal of being her girlfriend as a end result, so speaking with her often only helps you learn more about her. You can learn her texting habits - does she respond often, or rarely - see what she does on days that you aren't going on dates with her, and overall I think most girls like the fact that you show interest in them. I wouldn't exactly say go text her every day, but there's nothing wrong in texting her every 2-3 days and saying ""How's your week been"", ""would you like to go to a dinner with me sometime next week""."

First things first - this should be pretty obvious, but you're not in a relationship yet. Don't get caught in the thinking that you are. She may be dating even while seeing you.   Secondly, CHILL OUT. Things went great. Awesome! Don't fuck it up by trying to make everything perfect. You'll drive yourself insane trying to do it and look desperate in the process. Your goal now, is to lookup things that sound fun. And then do them. You're already in the hiking group, so keep doing that together.   Look at local papers or whatnot for things to do. Preferably cheaply. You don't have to (or want to) start blowing money like crazy because it will setup an unreasonable expectation that you won't be able to sustain.   Don't pay for everything. It's reasonable to pickup a check every once in a while, but don't put yourself into debt going out constantly.   HAVE OPINIONS. Always. Even if the option presented you could not possibly imagine giving a shit less about it. If you go to a movie, and you ask her where she wants to sit, and she tosses the question back to you, just pick a spot and go. The words, ""I dunno - whatever you want"" should never leave your mouth.   Most importantly, though, just keep it light. You're just dating. Dating, believe it or not, is fun. Had you dated more in the past, you'd be more used to it. The more you can chill out and relax, the better off you'll be."

Ask her to go on another hike and also find something else fun you can do.

Everyone's got their own level of comfort in what happens and at what speed they happen when it comes to dating.  Since you don't have that much experience, you'll need to find this out for yourself.  The slightly more complicated answer is, do what you want to do with a realistic mindset.  Especially for people newer to the dating scene, it's really easy to over idealize everything.  You put this relationship on this idealistic pedestal which does nothing but put a ton of pressure/expectation on the both of you.    Realize that you've been on a SINGLE date.  Neither of you should know each other well enough slash be invested in the relationship enough to warrant the level of worrying you're putting into this at the moment.  This girl should not be THAT special in your mind.  Just chill out a bit, relax, and have fun.  Dating is just a period where you guys get to know each other and have fun with each other.  Don't over complicate things.  There's a time/place to worry about making a relationship succeed, but the first date is not it."

It was months of secrecy, sneaking around, and cheating emotionally, finally culminating in physically cheating. For months, he lied to your face every single day. It was mistake after mistake after mistake which he didn't feel bad about in any way, shape, or form while it was happening, and which he escalated from an emotional to a physical affair. The blatant lack of respect and disregard for your feelings is abhorrent.   I have no advice for you because cheating is an absolute deal-breaker for me. Once the trust is gone (I mean, months of lying to your face), it can never be regained in my eyes. I'd never be comfortable again unless I was with the person 100% of the time and they had no cell/computer to contact anyone other than me, and that'd be ridiculous.   Good luck."

I'm also fairly certain that percentage is small and it seems your guy is lacking the whole ""bettering himself so that this never happens again"" element which is pretty key. Without that, why would he change? Especially if he knows that he can ""get away with it"" when you take him back?"
relationships,3e2ku2,rekidai,2,Tue Jul 21 16:34:51 2015 UTC,"An affair isn't cheating once, it's full blown premeditated. You say in your post you want to get over your ""hurt ego""... A hurt ego is thinking you're the best looking person in the room until someone better looking comes along. A hurt ego is thinking you're the best lay your partner's ever had until they admit they've had it pretty good elsewhere.  A hurt ego is not someone promising fidelity to you, breaking it, then tell you to get over it. That's not your ego talking, that's someone trying to manipulate you."

If he were truly remorseful, he would be willing to do anything to make sure you two survived as a couple. Instead he's feeding you an absurd excuse. You should really consider how sorry he truly is if he can't even do the bare minimum to win back your trust (aside from what I'm sure are some crocodile tears and empty apologies)."

Maybe one 'blip' would be insignificant in context of your relationship. But this isn't just a blip, it's not one stupid drunken night out with a stranger, or one kiss with a coworker. It's an affair. It went on months. He lied to you for months. If your relationship was so amazing, surely he wouldn't do that?   You've been together 2 years. If this went on for 6 months, that's a quarter of your relationship. It isn't just one blip."
relationships,3e2ku2,KatieOhLee,15,Tue Jul 21 14:00:18 2015 UTC,"Try and spend some time talking about your feelings, don't hold things back to spare his. You both need to process. Think of ways he can earn back your trust, open phone policy, etc. It wasn't a one time mistake, he carried on an affair for a couple of months even if it only became physical once. That will make it harder to move past, knowing that he actively chose to lie to you.   Sometimes it's easier to let go, think of that relationship you had as over, he isn't who you thought he was, so now you need to figure out who he is again and how to have a new relationship with him.

Cheaters who are atoning for their crime do everything under the sun to help their jilted partner, and he's failing you by withholding this incredibly useful tool for you to cope. I guarantee you that his #1 fear is that a therapist will make you see that staying with him is a bad idea (which is unfounded, they won't judge like that, but I guarantee that is his fear because your bf is self-serving and wants what is best for him)."
relationships,3e2ku2,Meatros,11,Tue Jul 21 14:04:02 2015 UTC,"If he really loved you and respected the relationship, he would have communicated with you that the relationship was going through a rough patch instead of looking somewhere else to satisfy his needs. This wasn't a mistake or ""one blip"". He knew what he was doing, made that CHOICE, and was doing it for months behind your back.   Your whole relationship consists of two years, a couple months of that (2 or 3?) were him sneaking behind your back having the time of his life with a younger woman. Sounds like only one of you thought the relationship was going amazing.  You're not married or have kids yet, which is good. I'd cut my losses before the horrible cycle, him cheating on you and you being a shell of the woman you once were, begins.

If you can't, it's not fair to you to force the relationship to coast on.   As to advice - I don't have much as I wouldn't be with someone who cheated on me by having a prolonged affair with someone else. I doubt I'd stick around if it was a one-night thing, but an entire separate relationship is definitely a no-go for me.  That said, the basics:   He has to go no contact with her.  He has to be completely transparent - you have access to his emails/phone/text/smoke signals, whatever. You two need to determine why he chose this route. It could be that he's simply a selfish shit OR maybe there was something lacking in your relationship that needs to be addressed. Figure it out and resolve it."

I know some of that is just guilt and fear but I can't stop seeing his face look like that with tears streaming down and I can't believe that he was anything but so upset that he potentially ruined our relationship, that's really the only reason I'm inclined to believe he felt he was so wrong and dumb to do such a thing."

He came clean to me to alleviate his guilt. He cheated multiple times and didn't tell me until the very end, after he had already gotten me to believe no other guy would ever want me, and after he thought he had me (because I didn't want to divorce). I am so glad I got that divorce.  Let's say you do get married, have a few kids, and you're going through a lot of issues. Would you trust him to remain true through everything? When you're bleeding for three months after giving birth and can't have sex? When you're older and sick and tired from being up all night with kids? This is not a solid foundation on which to build a lifelong marriage. I'm talking to you from the other side, married for half a decade to my husband, no issues of trust, two kids, still happy together.   Do you really want to look back, years from now, and have the reason you stayed with a guy who cheated on you for months and refuses to go to counseling... be because he shed some tears? I've seen so many fake tears from toddlers, I can make a little river. Don't buy that emotional manipulation. The one he feels the worst for is himself. You need to think about yourself and your future.  Someone who truly loves and respects you wouldn't cheat on you. Remember that."

The truth is you don't ever have to forgive him and you shouldn't feel pressured by anyone or anything to do it. Make the decision by yourself and based on what you want your relationships to me. It's down to him to regain your trust and make it up to you by putting in the effort, it's not up to you.  To reiterate.

Condom broke, and I had to confess to my mother that I was sexually active and I might be pregnant. She accepted it (but was not exactly happy as you can imagine).  Your mother sounds a bit harder than mine. I think your plan is a good one. Bring up the possibility of being sexually active, but don't tell her you already are. Let her get used to the idea and see how she reacts. Then take things from there.  Also in the meantime there are other enjoyable sexual activities you can do which won't put you at risk of pregnancy. PIV (penis-in-vagina) sex is not the be all and end all."

Everyone else saying be honest and spill everything and talking about how you are disrespectful, are all assuming your mother is a sensible and logical person but unfortunately not every person or parents is. only you know her really - breaching the topic first with maybe/what do you think? let's you gauge her future reaction. If she responds well or at least sensibly even if she isn't happy, you can continue being more and more honest, but this way if she flies off the handle at the mere thought of you having sex, you'll know you need a plan B, at least for the meantime.   Once you're 16 you can apply for a Medicare card and be bulk billed without your parents tracking your visits on their account. There are also many clinics you can pay upfront (maybe expensive but if you're willing to pay for condoms, lube nd the pill then it's worth it). Try community health centres as they often have very open-minded services and good programs for sexual health."

Sometimes condoms break, and there's not a lot more you could have done to prevent this.  As for your mother, that will really be your judgement call. If you are sure that she will be unreasonable then I'd say secrecy would be your best option. As you said, due to your age she does still have the power to make your life miserable and destroy the relationship at this point.   If you do choose secrecy, look into different lubes - the risk of pregnancy through using condoms is extremely low. As for other advice, maybe try your BF's mum?"
relationships,3e24ng,Jazzbee,30,Tue Jul 21 11:21:59 2015 UTC,"It's important to remember that Birth Control is often used for other things to control hormones, such as acne, heavy periods etc.   I'm going to be brutally honest here, though - your mother MAY seem very heavy handed, and arguably she is. But you are 15, you are still incredibly young and it never hurts to respect the rules of your parents. Sex is an emotional thing as well as single minded, and it could be that's why she's put these rules in place, even if it does seem OTT.  You don't need to tell her you're sexually active if you don't want to and you feel it will negatively affect your life, but it's worth mentioning that now you're getting older that you feel it's suitable to get on birth control and the doctor recommended it for heavy periods etc.  Don't fault your mother for not wanting you to have sex at 15. I was 15 when I lost my virginity, and though I don't regret it and my mother was very open with me, I still wouldn't be happy with my child having sex at 15 - though if they wanted to I'd ensure they were up to date on safety and on birth control. You're still incredibly young and you do have a mature head on your shoulders, but don't be upset that it seems she's OTT with the rules - she just wants to keep her child safe."

It sounds though that your boyfriends mom is pretty cool so my suggestion to you would to go to her with all your questions.  Also if you have a Planned Parent Hood I would make an appointment as soon as possible.  In most states you do not need your parents permission to make an appointment at one of their facilities or to get birth control.  They also would be able to answer any and all questions you may have.  On the other hand you may also want to try and broach the subject with your own mom.  Maybe not starting with my boyfriend and I are currently having sex but with something to the affect that you have been hearing so many conflicting stories about sex at school and would really like to know what is real and what is not.  On a final note if you are unable to get on birth control in your area without parental consent my suggestion would be that if you believe you are old enough to be participating in a sexual relationship then you need to be adult enough to delicately tell your mother the truth.  In closing, do you and your boyfriend a favor and abstain from any further sexual activity until you get on birth control and always use a condom. No one wants to be 15 and pregnant or have a STD."

You need to be suitably aroused before these things occur and trust me, it's worth it. You'll notice a big difference.   Secondly condoms do break and it's awful and I guess the UK is better prepared cause we have anonymous clinics that you don't need Id or a certain age to be. You can also get tested at these places and maybe that's a good idea too? He might say he's a Virgin but it's always nice to be sure and a lot of stis don't have symptoms.  And lastly, you need to respect your mum, she's hard because you don't need a baby at 15. It's coming from a good place. Stop lying to her, cause my mum would find that worse than the sex. I know it's hard and you feel like you know your own mind and you know what's best for you...but she has her reasons for these rules and I bet a lot of them are pretty valid. Saying that I was terrified of admitting I'd started and just blurted it out when we were on the motorway. She nearly crashed the car. I do not advise that. Sit down with a cup of tea and gently broach the subject, ""mum I know you have these rules but I'm 15 and I've been with SO for a while and maybe i'd like to go on the pill?

Maybe not this harshly but do you honestly believe you don't deserve to be punished?   I wish my mum was more supportive.   Have you even tried to confide in her. Your relationship isn't going to go anywhere if you don't stop betraying your mother. If you wanted to know more about sex you should have gone to your parents and started a communicative relationship on the matter.  You sound like a bratty teen because your being a bratty teen. The longer you withhold all of this from your mother, the more you're straining the relationship between the two of you. Parents set rules because 9 times out of 10 they know what is best for their children. It might sound like it's unfair to you right now but believe me, when you have children and they betray your trust you're going to feel just as hurt and realize how stupid and bratty your actions are.  Go to your mom and tell her what's been happening. Do throw a fit when she get's offended by your actions.

relationships,3e24ng,Yamazaru90,3,Tue Jul 21 15:19:45 2015 UTC,"I have a plan for you where you don't have to tell your mom that you are sexually active. Now, when I was 14 I had an irregular period, heavy heavy flow, hectic cramps that made me bed ridden. My mom personally took me to the doctor and got me birth control for it. So, if you have any of these problems I would sell her with one of these symptoms.   As for the lube, if you're not getting wet enough in your nethers that means its not enough foreplay. I've never once had to use lube in my life for vaginal sex. Unless you have a problems which prevents you from getting wet.   Another thing to note, mothers aren't dumb. The fact that shes so strict about you and your boyfriend might just mean she already knows you're sexually active. I lost my virginity when I was 19, and I always lied to my mom about it because I didn't want to disappoint her. However, I had to admit it to her because I got a recurrent yeast infection (im on her medical still), she told me she knew the day I lied already. So chances are she might already know.  EDIT:  Once you manage to get birth control note the following: 1. Use alternate protection for the first month of using birth control (it takes a while to start working efficiently.) or you can fall pregnant. 2. Take your birth control at the same time everyday or you can fall pregnant. 3. If you don't take it at the same time everyday but still take it every day you can fall pregnant. 4. Once the birth control is in your system (one month later) the morning after pill becomes useless, all that it'll do is fuck up your hormones unless you've been taking your birth control incorrectly. 5. Even once the birth control is in your system, use alternate protection. If you take it correctly, its 99% safe but you might be that 1%. 6. Switching to a different birth control resets your system (so you have to be careful again for the first month).  Follow these steps. I don't want to see you on 16 and pregnant. Good luck kiddo."

I don't really see how that's hypocritical.  Relationships between adult partners are different from the relationship between near-adult children and their parents.    Standards of behavior between adult partners, like monogamy, are mutually agreed upon.  Infidelity is breaking that agreement and breaking the critical trust of the relationship.  The authority in the parental relationship is unilateral.  The degree of freedom children should be expected to exert, against their parents' wishes, is a totally different argument from whether or not you should betray your adult romantic partner."

You sound like you might be in the UK (based on ""mum"", at least). NVM see you're from Aus. Not sure how much of this still applies to you, sorry :c  Just get the contraceptive pill yourself - there is absolutely no need to tell your mum.   When I was fifteen & in a steady relationship I went to the doctor by myself to ask for birth control.  He said he would be happy to give it to me on the spot. However, having worked with my mum he knew her & knew that she wouldn't freak out. He thought that her knowing about it might be useful in case anything went wrong. I agreed & my mum just sat & listened while he told her he was prescribing it.  My mum is very keen on people being responsible sexually, so as it turns out she didn't pass judgment on this. If I had thought she would I would never have let the doctor invite her & I still would have got my prescription.  If your doctor won't do this, see a different GP in your surgery, or better yet a contraceptive clinic (Google NHS contraceptive clinic). These services are not age-restricted.

She didn't mind when I told her I'd be going to my boyfriend's house, either (but that also took a lot of getting used to). So I think she kind of already knew, but it's nothing we've needed a conversation for. But your mom seems a lot more conservative.

relationships,3e24ng,SoBasicYouAcidic,0,Tue Jul 21 12:28:23 2015 UTC,"Your mother is being irresponsible by not providing you with information on how to be safe with sex. Is this the only topic she is so extreme about? I would consider withholding this kind of information from you based on her personal opinions as child neglect.   My first suggestion would be to just spill the beans. Tell her you're sexually active. You're growing up and in three years you will legally be considered an adult. She can try to keep you in the dark about sex but obviously you're going to do what you're going to do regardless of her authority in that regard, and it would be much safer for you, her child, if you could talk to her about it instead of hide it. Sex can lead to worse things than just pregnancy and it's important that you have an adult that you can talk to about it without fear of any backlash.   Of course she will not be happy at first but you are her child and your wellbeing should be the most important thing to her. So she grounds you, takes your laptop, your phone, whatever. Still doesn't change the fact that you're no longer a virgin, and it doesn't change the fact that you're eventually going to have sex again. There is literally nothing she can take away from you that's going to really teach you anything - other than to be shameful of your body and your needs which is definitely a lot more detrimental to you in the long term than a conversation about safe sex would be. Talking about safe sex and being open to hearing your concerns about your experiences doesn't mean she has to condone you having sex in her house. It just means she has to accept the fact that you're sexually active and give you enough information to keep yourself out of harm's way. This doesn't just mean talking about what to do if you get pregnant. There's also STD risk, yeast infections, endometriosis, urinary tract infections, consent - a lot of things you should know about in order to keep yourself AND your partner safe.  Another suggestion would be that if you're really too afraid to talk to her, maybe ask your boyfriend's mom to talk to her about it and not stop talking about it until she agrees to have a rational, unbiased and informative conversation with you about the topic. Again, your safety should be the number one priority to her. I'm sure she will come around. She really doesn't have a choice but to. If anything happened to you, inevitably it would be on her for refusing to give you the right information. Whatever you do, make sure she knows this.   Good luck."

It also makes me feel more secure, because the sacrifices we'd make to physically be together require a certain level of stated commitment before taking the leap. It could also just be how it works out for their timing and plans for their life.

First just an office wedding (if that's the English name, dunno) in my country to legitimize her staying there and then later a nice ceremony in her home country with close family and friends. Nothing big. We both don't need that. She's not exactly from a rich country or family and neither do I have a lot so the most important thing for is right now is just to be together.  In her culture it is very normal to marry so soon. You finish school with 16 and university with 20 and many already end up getting married during this. Sometimes having as well.  I know it won't be easy and I don't expect everything to always go smooth. But the actual wedding is still at least a year away. So if something doesn't work out it will be sad obviously, but it will not be the end of the world.  Also the fact that people here seem to think a ring and wedding etc are costly.

I was in a LDR for a bit over 2 years when we were both around 20. There were a lot of negative things about her in my eyes (and I'm sure negative things about me in hers) that just sort of get ignored when you don't see each other regularly or aren't big parts of each others' ""real"" lives.   I'm not saying to break up with her or not to have LDRs in general, but don't marry each other until you do have the chance to at least live in the same city beforehand. She's also really young (and you are too, for that matter), so there's no need to rush to marry either way."

It is waaaaay too soon for you to be getting engaged.  You don't see each other often in person and LDRs can cover up a lot of who a person is when you don't see each other often.  I'd try to be in the same location for awhile, date normally, see how that goes and then maybe consider engagement.  You don't give the length of the relationship, but if you're 20, it couldn't have been very long.  Hold your horses and slow it down."

If you only see each other a few times a year, that is hardly enough basis to actually, truly know someone.  Words on a screen or skype is a heck of a lot different than living with someone day in, day out and knowing all of their quirks and flaws.

I understand that in her country getting married young is the norm, but as far as we know most of those couples have probably lived together and grew up together and have known each other their whole lives! You and your girlfriend have never spent more than, what, 2 months together, at most? I think you would be better off waiting until living together (or just closer together) is an option."

You're right in that if you are considering a lifelong commitment you should be in a place where you're able to talk through conflicts in a healthy way.  People don't magically become good at this just because they get engaged so it's smart to make sure that you both can do this together, not to mention planning a wedding can be extremely stressful and taxing on even the best relationships.

I know this isn't the same but it's my personal experience with these situations. I have a best friend (of the opposite gender) I have known online for 5 years. 5 years of every day contact, phone calls, texts, skype, videogames, you name it. We have talked about everything under the sun. I thought I knew everything about this guy and there was not a singular thing I could think of that made me dislike him.  This summer he came out for a few weeks to visit for the first time. So many things were different, so many little things bothered me about his in person personality. It's really easy over the interent to hide things or lie. I found out a lot, see a lot of the lies. Not saying he isn't my friend still, but in person contact changed A LOT of my views on him.  I know you've met this girl in person before. I know you love her. LDR of any kind need in person time. A lot of time. A few weeks at a time isn't enough to know a person in ""real life."" You know how when you meet someone new and you get along with them 100% the first few weeks and then they start to show their true colors? It's really easy to be on your best behavior for the few days or weeks you visit. Like others have commented, you're going to do what you want to do, but I suggest taking some time to be around eachother in person for a while. Things change when it's not over a screen. You're both young, what is the harm in spending a few months being in the same area to make sure this is what you both want? To make sure this is something you are both ready to sacrifice everything for? I really hope the best for you, I hope whatever path you choose brings you happiness."

relationships,3e2tuz,thepasswordisspoopy,22,Tue Jul 21 18:53:33 2015 UTC,"OP, I'm not sure you're going into this with the right attitude. Being a stay at home parent is a full time job, and I think you're underestimating the difficulty while telling (!!) her to lose weight, cook homemade meals, make social plans, and clean up more. This quote in particular struck me the wrong way:   We take turns doing dishes and taking the trash out even though she's the one who's home all the time and generating the trash and the dirty dishes.   OP, is it her generating the mess, or could it perhaps be the two small kids < 3 years?  If you want her to do any of the things listed above, something's gotta give. If she is unhappy with the current situation, consider hiring a once-a-week housekeeper, a babysitter, or purchase a meal subscription service like HelloFresh/Plated.  Edit: re-reading this, I'll also mention:   I try to help when she asks me   You're supposed to be her partner. Perhaps the reason that she's freaking out about chores is because 100% of the stress/responsibility is still squarely on her shoulders, and you aren't being a team player. This is your house, and these kids are yours too-- it's weird that she even has to ask you to pull your weight when you get home."

relationships,3e2tuz,bozoconnors,12,Tue Jul 21 18:44:42 2015 UTC,"even though she's the one who's home all the time and generating the trash and the dirty dishes   You have to be kidding. C'mon man, if this the attitude you're approaching chores with, it's totally not shocking that she's building up resentment. This is your HOME, this is your FAMILY, work goes along with both of these privileges of owning a house and having children.   I try to help when she asks me and take the kids so she can get stuff done around the house but she always finds something I've either forgotten or done wrong and freaks out about it. She says it creates more work for her but it's stupid things that only takes a few seconds to fix so I'm leaning toward her just being dramatic.   Like what stupid things? Is it truly her being dramatic and controlling and unable to let go (and it could be, some woman are like this)? Or is it that you manage to f up every chore in some way or leave something undone, so the final responsibility of making sure the work is done still is 100% on her shoulders. Like, you do the dishes but leave food stuck to them, or pile them into the dishwasher is such ways that they break or they don't get clean? Or you pick up the toys but jam them into the wrong places? Or you wipe up the spill but leave the rag on the floor or use the only good towel she owns to do it? Only you know the truth here, we don't, but if it's the latter, nothing gets done completely or right without her having to do it, she has to follow up/finish up the things you do, then you are the problem with this one.    I go to work (sometimes six days a week)    6 days a week on her own with 2 kids under 3? It's grueling, thankless, and near endless work and responsibility.   Everything everyone said already about PPD and counseling stands true. However, these things I quote stand out for me. Are you sure you're helping as much as you think you are, that you are as supportive as you want to be? Give it an honest think-through and see if there isn't something you can change that can help turn this around."

When was the last time you guys hired a sitter and went on date night?  All of these things should be regularly scheduled, ideally weekly. She should be out of the house sans kids at least once a week to do an activity she loves - yoga, painting, robot building, whatever it is. Having equal leisure time without kids for each parent is absolutely key to a healthy marriage. If one parent is off camping all weekend while the other only gets a spa day every six months, you're going to have a really bad time.  No one could cope with being with two kids under 3 24/7, with no end in sight. 15 pounds of baby weight still on?! GASP. If 15 pounds is enough to make you lose your attraction to someone, you're going to have a really tough time in any long term relationship.  And you're considering divorce? I don't know why you'd jump to ending the relationship, when everything here is very easy to fix with additional help for your wife and time without the kids."

If your daughter grows up in a loveless household, she will pick up the fact that you guys don't love each other and she will model her future relationships after your own.

Your behaviour should be applauded, because it means that's how you're likely to act if your girlfriend is drunk and in need of help or your kid is. Emergencies aren't inconsiderate.  Perhaps it is time to look at how available you are to your sister. If she has a habit of flaking out, then yes you should talk to her about parental responsibilities and set up some boundaries. If it was an incident, let it go.  It sucks if celebrations are messed up, but to be fair, a reunion can be postponed. Those few hours aren't a big deal and the gf isn't in pain, the cousin is.

Your girlfriend temporarily lost closeness and sexy time.  That can easily be made up.  That all she see's in her point of view in this is a concern for me - is she often not able to see other people's needs or is this a one off, likely due to her just being back?

Not that OP is that kind of guy, but there are people out there who will help anyone who needs it--besides their significant other. I've never figured out why, but it happens.

Would give large sums of money away to people she barely knows (church stuff),bend over backwards for ""friends"" who drop her the moment they don't need her anymore, she would not even see me when I (her husband) was in the hospital for emergency surgery--she went on vacation without me instead. I never asked but she got about $300,000 inheritance and never offered to help one cent towards her husband's $30,000 medical bill, despite during our marriage she insisted I pay for everything.  So glad I'm not married anymore.   If I had to guess people like that are more in love with being in a relationship or marriage than they are with the person. Once that sinks in the jealousy and resentment build up, and they can't do anything because it makes them look shallow and stupid."

If I ever get married again (doubtful) I am going to need my partner to be 100% behind me, someone who will fight for me, as I would for them.   To be fair to her by the time I ended up in the hospital she was already about 80% checked out of our marriage. She may have already been seeing her boyfriend.

relationships,3dxwtt,hitbyabus21,102,Mon Jul 20 13:10:20 2015 UTC,"If it doesnt happen often, then your girlfriend is being unreasonable.  If it happens often and you like the role of semi parent, and dont want to change the dynamic, you need to honestly admit that to your girlfriend, and the two of you can have an open discussion about how that affects your relationship. If she expects a boyfriend who isnt responsible for a child, then ofcourse you're going to run into conflicts when reality meets expectations and dont match up.  If it happens often, and you have avoided adressing it with her mom, maybe you should try to change the dynamic. That can be hard, especially if your sister isnt really cooperating. In that case, be honest about it with your girlfriend, stay available for your niece (thats the decent thing to do) - but try to have an honest openness about the issue with your girlfriend."

Certainly a lack of explanation on what kind of stomach pains your niece was experiencing could have made her feel like this was not that big of a deal. If you left in a rush with little explanation, I'd have probably felt similar.   However, after the situation was explained in detail the next morning, I would have figured she would be more understanding. It's your family, clearly family means a lot to you and your willingness to be there for your niece is an admirable quality - especially if your girlfriend right now is at all considering you to be the father of her children someday. If I were her, and your niece called you in the middle of the night for help and you ignored it, that would make me question whether or not I would want you as a long term partner or the father of my children. I think deep down she probably knows she would feel the same if you just shrugged it off as if your niece was being a pain in your ass. My guess is this guilt is probably why she is so upset about it. That's entirely speculation though. I don't know your girlfriend.   Hope you guys can work it out. xo"

Or maybe, as a 15 year old, she felt uncomfortable waking up another person's parents and felt more comfortable reaching out to her uncle.

Honestly, my initial reaction was to roll my eyes because at 15, she's old enough to deal with a stomachache until her parents are available. It doesn't sound like an emergency.  But what constitutes an emergency worthy of calling uncle in the middle of the night is another discussion.  You're right. I would be alarmed and take any call at 1am seriously.

Now if you're constantly having to rescue her, that's something entirely different, but that doesn't seem to be what's going on here.  You know she's upset..

I totally get it. I love you.).  It's not reasonable to expect both people in a relationship to come to a final decision or consensus about whether every decision anyone made is right or wrong or good or bad. There's no need to ""settle the scores"" or what have you.

relationships,3dxwtt,radiobrackish,56,Mon Jul 20 20:35:35 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of comments taking your side, and I mostly agree. I know I'll catch furious downvotes for playing devil's advocate, but here's my take on why it's a bit frustrating from the GFs perspective, in case it helps get communication rolling:  If you drop everything to answer the phone, that's frustrating. The fact that it's family in the middle of the night means it was the right move (family or no family, I wouldn't need a special ring tone to be concerned if I got a midnight phone call).   But your reaction at that point was to value the niece 100% and the GF not at all, aside from expecting blind devotion and understanding from her. A 15-year old being frustrated that she can't reach her mother, especially with some cramping or stomach pain going on, is not necessarily an imminent health risk. Your description sounds more like discomfort and simply needing/wanting a ride home when you made your decision to go - you stated it wasn't until you already had her picked up and were on the way home that you decided just maybe it was worth checking out at the ER, so clearly it was not a huge health concern at the time of the phone call - besides, if it was an emergency then the friend's parents would be who I would expect to call an ambulance or get her to the ER immediately (and of course try reaching the mother).   A response that balanced both people's needs would be more like ""try your mom again, if you can't reach her within 10 minutes I'll come get you"", and in 10 minutes try calling the mom at least once yourself too.  You did good by your niece and are clearly a good dude. But I'd say cut the GF some slack since it doesn't take much to see events as a bit of slight to her importance in your world. I'd play up the part where you just counted on her to understand (love and trust is good), and focus less on the ""why you mad!"" part. I think at this point she's more annoyed that you're making it so black and white and can't seem to comprehend why she might have a valid reason to feel less important. You don't have to both handle situations like the phone call the exact same way but I'm sure you're closer to common ground than you realize if you simply accept the fact that there's room for compromise on what the appropriate reaction could have been."
relationships,3dxwtt,barntobebad,27,Mon Jul 20 16:17:55 2015 UTC,"I kinda agree to this point. Unless you where in the midst of an hours long love making session, you could've finished and called niece back. After two weeks, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't have been more than ten minutes. Niece mean while would've tried parents again. I'm not saying family isn't important, but 15 year olds do tend to get dramatic and self absorbed. That ten minutes of her waiting wouldn't kill, she was in a safe place, you could come get her still. Dropping your SO, and not seeing her side of it does send a shitty message to her, especially if she has been feeling neglected. Maybe it's time for an unplugged night. All phones off, candle light and some one on one time. This does seem like the issue is deeper than hero uncle saves day, girl friend jealous.

There was no reason to just plow over his SO's feelings for a stomach ache. She's not even his kid and is barely a kid at that. I'm shocked by how many people say he did the right thing, that it shows he'd be a good dad. But he isn't a dad.

He says he knew it was his niece from the ringtone, and a call at that time of night implies something serious is happening, but in the moment that her boyfriend stops having sex to reach for the ringing phone, serious feelings of neglect and bitterness can surface.

Also, at 1am, shes upset enough to call her uncle because she doesn't feel well, while it is completely possible it was just an ordinary stomach ache, most of the time at 1am you wouldn't be too embarrassed to camp out in the bathroom at a friends house. A big symptom of anxiety can be stomach pain, is it possible something happened that made her uncomfortable enough to want to go home?   Did you ask her about the incident? It just seems strange not having the parents take you home, especially if you're not feeling well and cant reach your mother. I dont have much to say about the GF, I understand being a bit dissapointed, and feeling like you could have finished real quick then called back, but again at 1am its clear thats an emergency, and you can bang later.Her issue is feeling like you picked something else over her, and she needs to deal with that herself, because that insecurity will come out a lot later on. This, with a child relative, itsnt the time to play that card against you.   Your post just stuck out as odd to me though, id follow up and make sure nothing happened to make her uncomfortable with her friend or their siblings or parents."
relationships,3dxwtt,SeaShelll,11,Mon Jul 20 23:58:29 2015 UTC,"If the stomach pain was so serious that it warranted being taken to hospital, then I completely understand OP's niece wanting to leave the sleepover. (Also as a teen I got sick at a sleepover once with a simple vomiting bug, and I definitely wanted to be at home throwing up with my mum looking after me rather than in a house I didn't know well throwing up in front of a friend's parents who I didn't know that well.) I wouldn't necessarily expect the friend's parents to bring her home, as long as they were awake and supervising her while waiting for someone to collect her. I think the bigger issue is why she was unable to get hold of her own parents, and whether that's something that happens often or it was just a one time thing."
relationships,3dxwtt,_cornflake,7,Mon Jul 20 17:06:43 2015 UTC,"I thought of that too, generally parents have the phone volume up loud when the kid is out. Who knows though.   As for the topic of the gf, that seems like theres no way anyone could disagree that he was in the right."
relationships,3dxwtt,SeaShelll,23,Mon Jul 20 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"The other parents were probably asleep, and it'd be pretty ballsy to walk into their room and ask to be taken home. And if it was a stomach ache because of nerves, there's no way she's going to be comfortable doing that. She's already uncomfortable/embarrassed and isn't even going to want to talk to the other kids about it, much less wake up the parents. Definitely better to just call someone to come get you.  You're definitely being over paranoid."

There were times I was at a friends, after eating something bad, and knew id just be in and out of the bathroom all night. If I couldn't reach my mother, it would not at all be "" ballsy"" to tell your friend you aren't feeling well and have them get your parents to take you home. Though I will say I didn't notice the age in the title, I was thinking this girl was under 10, not a teenage.  Thats my point though, if its about nerves, thatd be the reason shed call him, not talk to the friends parents."

Sometimes, with us women, it's not so much WHAT you do, as HOW you do it.    It's perfectly acceptable to go collect your niece.  It's not, to make your girlfriend feel like she doesn't matter. barring the idea that your SO is an inconsiderate child, which I doubt, or why would you even be with her?  I think it may have been not so much you doing it, but how you handled it that was the problem.   When my guy breaks plans for me for his kid, HOW he handles it can make a world of difference between me feeling like he is just being a good dad and me feeling like I am a whore who can just be discarded.   Maybe ask her what specifically about it upset  her.  I bet you would be surprised to find out that it actually wasn't what you did, but the way you made her feel while doing it."

Oh they werent there? At 15? Maybe, but not likely."

And OP can't be blamed for prioritizing the safety of his niece (who he even took to the hospital) over sexy time.  Yes his GF has the right to be upset. But at the situation and not at OP and certainly not at his niece. Neither of them are to blame for this.

You're a terrible lover for leaving your phone's sound on during sex, for interrupting sex for a phone call (there's a reason why it's called intimate moment) and then leaving your girlfriend out to dry in the middle of sex to leave the house, especially after having been 2 weeks without any.   But hey, you're a great uncle."

I think your girlfriend has every right to be upset. Who answers the phone in the middle of having sex?! I would be upset at my girlfriend if she pushed me off of her (or climbed off, whatevers) to go and answer the phone. I understand there being some situational justification there (you recognized the ringtone, it's late), but really?! It couldn't wait for just a minute? It's not like sex is an hours long involved marathon. ESPECIALLY after two weeks, I would just be.. disappointed that you treat sex so casually, answering the phone in the middle.  You're a great uncle, nice job with the rescue; but sheesh, maybe your girlfriend is just pissed that you don't have any ""offline"" time. And it sounds like you just took off after you got the news; did you update your gf on what was going down or what?"

However you need to consider your girlfriends feelings, she felt abandoned and now she's angry. To help alleviate her hurt and anger you need to apologize for leaving but make it clear it could have been an emergency. Maybe ""I'm sorry for how I made you feel I should have handled it better. I was worried that my niece was hurt and I couldn't leave her there."" Also a romantic night where you spoil her a little wouldn't hurt."

relationships,3dxwtt,peppepcheerio,55,Mon Jul 20 17:11:46 2015 UTC,"You were in the right.  I'd be a little sexually frustrated, maybe, at having to interrupt--but being called by a kid at 1 AM is not a joke!  And you're her uncle. It is your responsibility, that's how being an adult role model for a relative works.  Yes, I would have done what you did.  And in all honesty, if I were the girlfriend in the scenario, I probably would have come along for the ride."

relationships,3dxwtt,fluorowhore,21,Mon Jul 20 14:45:46 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily think that being an uncle automatically makes the child his responsibility.  For example, there are people who don't want children because they don't want to be an adult role model to a child, period. Having children is a choice parents make, and you can't force someone to act auntie or uncle like just because you give birth to a child.   However, if a child feels comfortable calling you that late, there is probably established precedent of being a caring uncle there."
relationships,3dxwtt,lady_wildcat,6,Mon Jul 20 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"Sure, I had uncles who were definitely not in the picture--but if he is in the picture, what I'm saying is that he doesn't get to pick and choose, you know? If he's her emergency call then he always has to pick up for her at odd hours, and his partner needs to grow accustomed to the fact that he's got responsibilities to other  people than himself."
relationships,3dxwtt,RememberKoomValley,9,Mon Jul 20 21:22:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   I think it is rude for someone to tell their sibling that they have to be incredibly involved in the child's life and try to force that. Not everyone wants that kind of role or even likes kids. However, if you insert yourself into that role, by choice, you're on call for fun and responsibility."
relationships,3dxwtt,lady_wildcat,15,Mon Jul 20 21:23:51 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I was thinking. My boyfriend has a kid sister and if she called him in the middle of the night, I know for a fact he would drop everything to go get her. If I were with him, I would most definitely go along to to make sure she's okay. If she's having a serious emergency, it's better to have two people in the car anyway.  I was shocked to read that she said she didn't want him to go get her. What if it was a serious situation? Say it was appendicitis, not treated because uncle didn't go pick up, it bursts, she dies. Would you really want that over your head? This isn't even just a boyfriend/girlfriend situation. This is simply human decency."

relationships,3dxwtt,holdingvadersleash,15,Mon Jul 20 20:00:54 2015 UTC,"OP's actions are so textbook perfect we all automatically jump to him being ""right."" I don't think relationships are about being right or wrong. While everyone applauds OP,(deservingly) I would like to point out a different perspective:   The perspective of OP's girlfriend: OP mentions briefly that him and his partner we're apart for the last two weeks but mentions very little about her perspective of the argument. She was probably really excited to see him. Excited to be alone with him. Excited to spend quality time with her partner. But more deeply to be shown she is important.   Yet here, in her most vulnerable and (arguably) most intimate moment, her boyfriend she hasn't seen in two weeks answers his cell phone and leaves her immediately in the middle of the night.   That's gotta feel bad.   No matter how right OP's actions were, the context of the situation sucks. We're not all good at bouncing back from moments like that. And sometimes we misrepresent our emotions, or don't know why we feel a certain way.   It's easier to say, ""what you did was wrong"" than to say, ""I felt really alone and missed you and you left me alone in the middle of the night to feel more alone.""  The ethical thing to do is to say OP is right but relationships aren't about that. Sometimes we forget that and sometimes it's hard to tell the people we love most our own insecurities. These are the real pitfalls of relationships. The why did she say this. What does it mean and why does she feel that way. OP's question shouldn't be who's right but how can they prevent her from feeling this way together without sacrificing  safety or diminishing the importance of Op's niece."
relationships,3dxwtt,squeeezebox,79,Mon Jul 20 20:48:36 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but the potentially urgent call from a child should always trump  immediate sexual gratification.  If your GF doesnt understand or agree with that... well just be sure you are using condoms.

I mean, it would be jarring to be interrupted in that fashion and then have you run off - but it was for a fairly important reason.  So, IMO, she's allowed to have an emotional reaction to it, but once she gets over those emotions she needs to realize that her position (ignoring the call and/or repeatedly calling the mother) was pretty shitty to begin with."

My wife and I had sex interrupted more than once when we were in high school because someone came home early. Getting a call at 1 AM from a family member is bound to ring alarm bells.  Being upset for more than a few hours about having sex cut off early because of a possible emergency is incredibly selfish and immature.  What's more important?  Her getting an orgasm, or the OP getting his niece to the ER before her appendix ruptures?  It sucks that the Mother didn't answer the phone, and I wouldn't blame OP's GF from being irritated with her, because in the end if Mom answer's her phone initially, then OP isn't making a trip to the  hospital.  But none of that irritability should be directed toward the OP."

It might depend on your family dynamic. I wouldn't do it for my family (except maybe my mother) because they're fucking idiots. Additionally, what's an ""emergency"" to a child would not necessarily be one to an adult. I'd have expected the niece to be like ""she hurt my feelings and I wanna go home!""

But any reasonable adult who isn't completely self centered would immediately realize that a child calling for help in the middle of the night is more important than the sex is. Even if she was still upset in the morning, hearing the entire situation then should calm her down. Yet she's still upset about it? After hearing you were her second person of contact? After hearing she was in pain? After hearing that you took her to the hospital? Your girlfriend strikes me as incredibly selfish if she can't put her feelings aside for your niece, a child, in need. I don't know any children who would willingly leave a sleepover with their friends unless something was really wrong. I may come across as crass or abrasive, but you girlfriend really needs a wake up call if you two have continuously discussed this and can't come to terms about this. This isn't one of those situations that are all about context and have many different ways to look at it. This is one of those easy black and white situations. Your niece was in pain and needed help and as a result your girlfriend is pouting (essentially) because she didn't get her way. You did the right thing.

Not at you, directly, but I would be extremely upset that the mother of your niece didn't have her phone on her and turned on while her thirteen year old daughter was having a sleepover. Like, she better be in the middle of her own damn emergency to blow off her daughters calls and put that responsibility on you.  But then again... my boyfriend and I have a strict no phones in the bedroom during sex/foreplay so this wouldn't have happened at all. He'd seen the calls post-sex and done what he needed to do.  The problem here isn't really what you did. It's that your niece's mother is putting you in a position to do these things and while it's great that you picked your niece up, I can say I'd be a little irritated about it especially if we hadn't seen each other in ~2 weeks."

relationships,3dxwtt,Jett202,8,Mon Jul 20 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"Remember, sex for her can be about bonding, showing that you care about each other, and deep intimacy; it can leave anyone feeling vulnerable in the presence of another. To have your partner up and leave you in the middle of that could truly impact your self-image. I absolutely don't condone how your significant other is acting out about it, but I fully understand how she could be left feeling unimportant and set aside. Especially if this was supposed to be her first night back with you after an extended absence.   You should not apologize. Tell her that while you have an immediate responsibility to help your niece in any kind of distress, you do care very much for her feelings about the situation, and that she is a very important person to you. You could make up for last night by having a romantic dinner tonight and, honestly, avoid sex unless she initiates. Opt for a lot of cuddling, massaging, and sex-free intimacy. If she does initiate though---brother, go knock her socks off and make the night about her. You'll be over that fight in no time."

Someone else had said something about anxiety, and while I don't know if I'd take it to a catastrophic place, upset tummy + late at night + unfamiliar sleeping place? Sounds like an anxious reaction.  Does your niece call you for a ""bail out"" often? Does your partner know how much of a support you are in your nieces life?"

Who would want to date a guy who wouldn't go get his niece? That's the type of guy who will leave you in the ER by yourself. That's the kind of dude who won't come out and change a tire for you. That's a scumbag dude. Why would she want to date a scumbag?

Even if it turned out not to be an emergency after the fact, I would still continue to pick up the phone the next time the phone rings at 1 am from a family member. Just because I don't want that one time that I did not pick up to be the time that it mattered.   Explain this to your GF. Maybe her opinions on family values are different than yours. It doesn't mean that you're right and she's wrong; it means that you two have differing opinions on this matter and you two should continue to discuss this with each other until you can both reach an understanding that suits both of you."

I don't care if I'm mid-orgasm or mid-REM sleep, I'm answering. 1am is the time of emergency calls - there isn't any other kind of 1am calls.   If a young person in my family needs something at 1am - then I do it. What the fuck else would I do? Sure - try to contact the mom once - but if you fail too, then you get your ass up and get it done. That's what a good guy does. Does your GF not like these traits in you? Does your GF not see that these traits are exactly what she DOES like in you?  Oh your boyfriend is really nice, kind, loving, and caring? Ya, mine is great - he got a call at 1am from his niece needing to be picked up from a sleepover and he said, ""fuck that"" and kept fucking me.  No.    Now if this is somehow a pattern. That your niece calls every weekend from some random bad part of town after doing a pound of coke and asks you to take her to the rave in the desert at 1am... Then sure - you have grounds to say no and for your GF to be upset for constantly rewarding her bad behavior.  But a one-off freak thing - why wouldn't you do whatever you could for family?"

I understand that my Gf could be frustrated of the situation, we hadn't had sex for two weeks (she was away) and this was our first night together but that's just bad luck, I would still do what I did.   Stick to this. It'd be one thing if it had been a mid-afternoon casual chat, but a 1:00 a.m. phone call that leads to a hospital trip is anything but casual. It's fair if your girlfriend feels bummed out that the timing interrupted your bang time, but the take away here should be: ""Your niece is lucky to have an uncle like you and I'm glad it was a false alarm"" not to pout about interrupted sex."

You would then feel super guilty and through that guilt rationalize it to be your gf's fault and resent her for it. That's what could have happened and I think your girlfriend while okay to feel what she feels right now should come to the understanding later on her own timeline that you did the right thing

Another consideration is that another time when your niece is in trouble - she's been molested or harassed (or worse) at a party, or someone's drugged her, she's too drunk, feels threatened or unsafe ... but she's made poor choices and is too scared to call her Mum. You would be the person that she'd call and if you can't be there for those littler issues, she won't call on you later down the track for the big issues when she truly needs someone!   I'd absolutely hope you don't ever get one of those midnight calls in a situation like that, BUT, she knows she can trust you to be there for her. That is HUGE!   It's unfortunate that sex was interrupted - especially after you'd not seen each other for a while - but long term, the bigger issue is the trust level has risen for you and your niece! You did a good thing!"

A phone call and things start happening.    Your niece has her own ringtone, you knew who was calling.  At 1am a family call has some priority.    Fast forward 5 years.  You two are married, with a kid.  Your child is at a sleepover.  You two go out, get drunk and have a date.  You sleep through 6 missed calls from your kid, and one from your brother.

She proceeded to fuck her BF three feet away from me while his friend tried to put the moves on me. You heard the special ringtone, its not like the caller could have been some random woman. Aside from that, boners happen, it's not like she lost an infrequent opportunity. If my boyfriend were called by his sister's kids in the middle of the night, I would want him to go, and I would probably go with.

Your girlfriend, well....It's all well and good (and even understandable) for her to be disappointed at having to be interrupted in such a moment, but the reality is your niece needed you more than your girlfriend did in that moment. She needs to accept that you value your family and that you'll prioritize emergencies over sex every time.

Remind her that your plans for the night and you doing something you were enjoying were also changed/interrupted. I highly doubt you'd rather be sitting in a hospital waiting room than having sex. So aside from the should you or shouldn't you have dealt with it difference of opinions, your girlfriend should get that this wasn't a thing you did to her, it was a disappointment that happened to you as a couple because an obligation came up. As for whether or not you should have answered, of course you should. A family member calling in the middle of the night (who doesn't habitually do that) is clearly calling because there's an emergency. A familial child who can't get in touch with other family shouldn't be told to just hang out and keep trying, you should absolutely have gotten her.   Edit: autocorrect did some weird things there"

It sounds like you're in that same boat, if it was 1pm you probably wouldn't have answered until it was apparent there was something serious going on (second or third try).  To just leave her at a friends house when she was feeling ill would have been very cold.  It wasn't your responsibility necessarily, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't have stepped up for her.  The situation could have been a lot more severe, she may have not been able to call back or pickup your call so it's good you answered the first time.

You're so terrified of coming off clingy, or pushing things, or forcing something that isn't fitting naturally, that you're not allowing yourself to communicate in a way that might actually cause this relationship to reach its natural conclusion.  I define this particular thing (there should be a name for it, because it's so common these days) thusly: There's this guy I'm seeing.  He has said he's not my boyfriend, but that was months ago, and sometimes he acts like my boyfriend.  I don't want to ask him what we are to each other, because that's clingy and unnatural.  So instead of asking, I'm just going to wait around for the next year, or two, or three, and see what happens.""  The problem with that strategy is twofold:   He's already told you he doesn't want to be in a relationship until he's out of the army.  He's not out of the army yet, so, he still doesn't want to be in a relationship.  Also, take note of his wording… I wouldn't want to be in a relationship until I'm done with the army, which you do realize, implies that he might want to pursue a relationship with you at that time, but does not actually state it.  In other words, you could wait around for years for this guy to get out of the army, only to have him tell you that he still isn't interested in a relationship. You don't have the unlimited time in life that you think you do.  You spend a year waiting for this, a year waiting for that.  Then another year to clear up a misunderstanding, then another year to ""get over"" the misunderstanding.  You live that way long enough, and you end up in your mid to late thirties, looking around at all your married friends with their children, and you wonder when you missed your boat.   My advice: Stop doing what you're doing.  Tell him how you feel about him and what you want, and ask him how he feels and what he wants."

Just call him, or the next time you see him, be like ""Hey listen, it's obvious we both really care about each other, but I just want to make sure I know where we're at."" or something to that effect and see what he says.  Whatever happens, you're not doing yourself any favors by sitting around mulling over it.

His reaction was completely normal and your attitude is scary and controlling. If you feel the need to label people with a random psychiatric diagnosis when you're not a doctor to validate your own insecurities about your past relationship, why don't you take a long look at your own scores on these personality tests?  Or wait, for you maybe it's ""just a test"" and he ""really has it""?  Stuff like this drives me crazy and adds to the unneeded stigmatization of real mental health patients. You're not a doctor. A cute online test does not make up for having a PhD in the subject, and it's an insult to yourself and psychiatric medicine to diagnose people like that.

You and I know that isn't always realistic. Most comments are starting with the premise that giving this turd money means supporting drunk driving. Also not realistic. You don't really know this guy, you don't know the victim, as someone else pointed out an office change bucket doesn't go far in the world of medical bills, so any amount of money you give or don't give means jack. It will have zero effect on the amount of drunk driving in the world, and as far as I'm concerned that's the only metric that matters.   So, that said, I'd like to encourage you to be a little more selfish here, because your own situation is about the only thing you do have control over.

You want to be the one charged with wandering the aisles at the hallmark store, picking the perfect turn of phrase for our dui manslaughterer?   Do they even make cards for that?   It feels like the involvement level just rose 1000%. Just stick a crumpled bill into someone's hand and fade into the crowd.

You don't (usually) have to continue seeing people who ask you out, there are different expectations surrounding dating and sick coworkers.  That said, you could be right. It all depends on the office, so OP will have to make that call. My advice is still to do whatever creates the lowest impact, then wash your hands of the whole thing. If your read is that you can brush collections off without blowback, by all means go for it. If you're concerned about your reputation going forward, tens of dollars is a small price to pay for peace of mind.

Unfortunately, as repellent as it is, you might need to kick something in just to have peace in the workplace. Think of it as a tax that allows you to keep working there until you can find something better. Next time they hit you up, give them $5.00. It's stupid, but possibly necessary. If they still give you shit, tell them that's literally the limit of what you can afford, and update your resume.   My line of reasoning is that what's right isn't necessarily what's practical.

Do not let your wife know you are making this plan because she will explode at you and bully you out of it.

They're tiny and fragile, and I'll bet you $10,000 they're afraid of their mother. One of the most common mistakes victims of abuse make is to think that it's just them that will be victimized, but it's not just you. She will, will, will take this out on your kids. She will. You need to do something before she damages them beyond repair.  Couples therapy for the both of you, individual therapy for her, and her full commitment to both, or you leave and take the kids with you. Full stop, no negotiation. And that's if you even want to stay; you'd be perfectly within your rights to just file for divorce and go for full custody.  I'm sorry about your childhood, but I can tell you, I prayed my parents would get a divorce. I would have given anything to get away from my mother, to get away from the screaming and the tantrums and the violence.

I give this advice to guys on this sub all the time: if you had a female friend in your situation, what would you tell her? If your female friend told you that her boyfriend wouldn't stop pressuring her for sex even though it was extremely painful for her, showed no sympathy for her pain, and routinely digitally penetrated her against her will... what would you say?"

You don't tell your parents relationship issues if you want to keep the girl.   They will always hate her for hurting you.  You can't change that.   If you want money to go see her,  I suggest a job or at least doing some odd jobs and paying for it yourself.

relationships,3e3ib2,moon-chaser,3,Tue Jul 21 17:56:12 2015 UTC,"Loving someone is not an on/off switch you can just flip when you feel like it. It's a constant caring, even when things go wrong. Rather than cut off communications and blame his S/O, he should be talking about how he feels and offering / asking for support if needed. THIS IS NOT HOW FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS WORK.  I understand there may be some mental health issues involved, but that's no excuse for being constantly emotionally attacked like you are being. You're still young, you've got plenty of time and it doesn't sound like you have a life locked down with him (living together, kids, etc.) so stand up for yourself!  Sit him down and tell him that he's making you feel terrible when he does that and that it's causing you a lot of stress / anxiety. If he doesn't care when you genuinely tell him what's going on then you need to be in a different relationship.  There's no reason to sacrifice yourself for someone else so early in your life. Get out there, stay strong, and you'll make the right decision. Just be honest with yourself and your relationships. You have a lot of growing to do still!"

relationships,3e3ib2,six_of_swords,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:55 2015 UTC,"Is he in therapy? What you're describing sounds a lot like 'splitting', a form of black-and-white thinking in which it's very hard for him to see the people around him as anything other than all good or all bad. Look the term up and see if it sounds familiar. Being with someone who does this can be completely crazy-making: one minute you're great, the next you're shit. You never know which it's going to be, you're on eggshells all the time, and you keep wondering if you're doing something wrong somehow but you just can't figure out what it is.  It's not about you. It's about him. There's therapy for this stuff, and he needs to be working on this with a professional, for your sake if not his.   And for your own sake, look around online and find a community of other people who have been through this (groups for partners of people with various mental illnesses are out there). Right now, it sounds like you feel very alone and isolated because of all this, and I think you'll be in much better shape if you can share your experiences with people who know exactly what you're talking about.  Edit: The combination of depression and PTSD and splitting clicked something for me. Look up Borderline Personality Disorder, and see if the description sounds familiar. I'm not a psychologist, I can't diagnose your boyfriend over the internet, and I could be way off here anyway, but if the description of that disorder rings bells for you, that may help you make sense of what's been going on."

He won't do anything about his mental problems. I've tried a bit but in the end I just told him I can't force him to do anything. Im not going to force him. If he wants to do something about it he has to do something about it on his own. I've never been that girlfriend that forces her boyfriend to do anything. Even if it would be a positive thing.

relationships,3e2q44,Meatros,6,Tue Jul 21 14:45:44 2015 UTC,"Woah, wait - after four months you weren't even ready to say 'I like you'? WTF man...   Then she says she wants to discuss the rules and mentions that the guy wanted to touch her sexually but she stopped him because she wasn't sure how I'd feel about it. I told her that I would have probably stopped seeing her if she just came and told me that she had sex with someone. Then she asked in what context would it be ok for us to see other people. I said one where we tell each other ahead of time, especially if we wanted to have sex with someone (in which case we'd discuss it and see if we wanted to stay together or not).   Wait, what?  I get not being cool with her seeing her ex and especially not being cool with him having sex with her. It suggests that she's not over him and a whole bunch of unhealthy shit.  That said, are you and her going to have a poly-amorous relationship? Not my cup of tea, but whatever.   When we met, I implored her to speak because somthing had obviously radically changed in her mind. Eventually, she told me that, to her, everything had changed, and that she went out and kissed with 2 different guys on Saturday and Sunday. I felt betrayed when she said that. I had told her that I was meeting someone, as we had agreed, but she broke the promise and did it in secret. It took a while to explain to her how she had basically done something dishonest and abused my trust. I felt hurt and amazed at how she had hidden her feelings and radically branched off into her own reality where I despised her and where she no longer needed to be honest with me.    Um, yeah, she suggests the open relationship. You agree to rules. She breaks those rules. She cheated/broke your trust. I have no idea why it took a while for you to explain this to her, since you all both agreed to the rules.    She said she wanted a full open relationship where we didn't have to tell each other before seeing other people. She said she wanted to see her ex and maybe sleep with him if she felt like it before he travels in a few months. That hurt me even more. I didn't know what to say. Eventually, I told her we should stop seeing each other for the rest of the month.   She's being extremely selfish and shitty here. She broke your trust and now she's attempting to get everything that she wants, an open relationship on her side and not live up to anything that you want.    I has starting to feel really happy and content with my life when I was with her, as was she, but I don't think I can easily get over the facts that she hid her feelings, took radical decisions about us on her own, betrayed my trust, and most of all, wants to be see other people.   To me, those are deal breakers.   Before we stopped seeing each other she said she still liked me and would like if we remained at least friends.   Tough shit for her. You need her out of your life."

It takes me a long time to collect and understand my feelings and to get attached to someone. And I don't like to say those words unless I'm really sure I mean them.  Perhaps if I had said them before, she'd have taken us more seriously, but then again I doubt anything would have been different in terms of how she'd have reacted."

It doesn't matter whether he thinks it is going to be easy or not. It will not be easy. It is freaking HARD. It's hard in our relationship even when everything else is going right. If the issues that led to you taking a break are still unresolved, it is going to be stressful, painful, and likely stupid for you to get back together with this added complication.   You may just want to hang and see what he is like after the birth--is he pursuing custody of any kind? Visitation rights? Is he paying child support? How often will he be contacting/contacted by the girl? Will it frustrate him to not spend time with this child? All of these answers have the potential to be very upsetting.

You don't give much information about what brought you together or what tore you apart, so I can't give much detailed advice.  But my gut is that he will be busy come January; you already broke up once and now there's the potential for additional resentment (although you guys were on break, it's still easy to feel cheated on in that sort of situation).  It's a lot of work for a relationship, you aren't married or have kids so I think you're better off finding someone new.  edit: Misread, I didn't see that you got back together in January and the baby is due soon.  Again, if you were married or had kids, and had access to counseling, it might be a different story.  You could also see how it goes the next few weeks, if there's nothing abusive or controlling about the relationship."

If you're misguided enough to actually want to take a break at some point in a relationship, the terms can be hashed out then.

It's not the kid's fault, but I'd find it hard to not blame all of the future relationship problems on the fact that he has a child with a fling from  a break in the relationship.

We all know that some relationships are a bit of an 'off again on again' and were never really meant to last. You can continue being the woman he settles for but not the woman he gets excited about and engages in casual/unprotected sex with. You can just as easily find somebody out there who will treat you the right way, does not involve so much conflict that you need breaks, while otherwise foster a stress free and enjoyable relationship.

If this all doesn't bother you, honestly, I wouldn't be in a relationship with him. Not just yet at least. He's about to step into parenthood right now and balancing fatherhood and a relationship with someone who isn't the mother of his child, with whom he already has issues with, he needs this time to settle into his new life and you need that time to figure out what you want.

You are already having misgivings about the child, so it seems to me you're uneasy with it.  Being with someone who has a child is difficult and is an added responsibility that many are not ready nor willing to have, and that is perfectly okay. Ultimately, the choice is up to you. You have to leverage how much you want this relationship, how you feel emotionally about him having gotten another woman pregnant, and how you are going to manage (together with him) to co-parent or, at the very least, be co-responsible for this child at certain times and during visitation (assuming you two live together)."

The entire point of a marriage ceremony is to say, in front of witnesses, that you have chosen each other.   Have you been pressuring him to get married, and he sees this as a way to make you happy without any public consequences? Does he think his family would disapprove of you marrying so young?

Part of marriage is the public acknowledgement of the relationship; standing up in front of your loved ones and pledging commitment to your partner is a beautiful thing and should not be done if one or both people aren't prepared to do their best to hold up the vows they agree to.  It's common for military relationships to rush into marriage for the benefits.

If you live together, save lots of money, and love each other. This whole situation seems kinda sketchy to me. Husband and I got married kinda in secret. We planned on it eventually and when he got orders we married so we could go joint spouse. Family found out was no big deal and we had a ceremony before we PCS'd. We married probably too soon and have had problems to work through. The first year is HARD. But it's what we BOTH want and were enjoying life.   What I'm getting at is you seem hesitant about this. Yeah it works out for some people, but there's a lot of flags here. If I was you I wouldn't do it. There's a lot of questions to need to ask him. Why do you want to marry me? Will we live together? How are bills to be paid? Will we sign for joint spouse? Are you faithful to this and really plan on having a ceremony?   I wish you the best of luck.

It also seems that your old friends are not very committed to keep the friendship going. There can be lots of reasons for this. they maybe feel you are boring or they just do not have the need to keep in contact via all kind of social media. I have friends i may see every second year , and we are still good friends, but we would never write on each other social media, it is just not how it works for us. Making new friends out of work can be done any place. As long as you get involved in people and show you are friend material people will want to be friends with you.

relationships,3e20ek,squarecoinman,2,Tue Jul 21 10:35:33 2015 UTC,"I was never really much one for socialising outside of school times.   FWIW, I think that this limited you to being a ""work"" friend.  IME, you need that extra socializing outside the ""forced to be together"" environment to transition to a solid friendship.    Doesn't explain your lack of success making uni friends though.  :/  It sounds like you're doing everything right (e.g. try to engage & keep up with people), which either means:   you have really bad luck.  Rare, but can happen. you don't have a magnetic personality.  (I mostly fall in this bucket.)  This is my guess since people are ok being friends when you're physically there.  To be fair, it's hard to maintain LDRs -- platonic or romantic -- so it's very common for friendships to peter out after a party moves away. you have a personality trait/behavior that's offputting.

I have a large group of friends, and they're all great people, but it feels like they only ever message me when they need something. They only ever invite me to major parties or events now, whereas I used to always get invited to casual movie nights and stuff.   It's frustrating because I don't know what I am doing wrong, or why they felt the need to start cutting me out of things. But I recently noticed that I've also grown out of them a bit. They're my friends from high school and sometimes when I hangout with them now (we graduated 3 years ago) I feel like they're still stuck in their high school days.   My issue right now is that I want to find new friends, but I don't really have an outlet for that at the moment. I work for my family business, meaning my mom, dad and my uncle. So I can't meet anyone from work. I won't be going back to school (since I'm working towards taking over the family business..) so I can't meet anyone from school. I feel quite trapped and lonely.    Sorry I didn't mean to start laying out my problems on your post but I just really connect with everything you have said here.

That way, I can meet people with the same interests as me to keep conversation and activities going.  Being one of the 'other', I learned that it is completely ok to have few friends long as they are true. I'm guessing you still haven't found your true friend, or that maybe you keep on looking and not realize there is one, like with love. So try to do things you genuinely love. And don't look at their age, maybe a circle with your same age is not for you, probably with the way you think, and for me there is nothing wrong with that.  With a true friend, keeping up to date is not necessary. And with a true friend, you won't need to exert that much effort and feel that bad about yourself."

relationships,3e20ek,kmidre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:15 2015 UTC,"OP, the problem seems to be that a) you were never that close to your friends in the first place b) most of your current relationships are long-distance.   I moved to a different city when I changed high schools, and to a different city when I got to uni. So I have a lot of LD friendships too. One best friend I eventually stopped talking to because we were contacting each other less and less frequently and when we did it was awkward, we had lost the rhythm of each other's speech patterns. It was sad but we had grown out of each other's lives and it was time to let go. Some of your friends will feel this way.   Second case, I am considering dropping another LD friend because we were never that close and frankly I can't be bothered putting in the work to stay friends with someone I feel meh about.  Of course, some LD friendships are possible. Three out of my four best friends are on different continents. No matter how great the distance between us is, we stay close because we talk a lot. But I mean a lot. At least once a month and sometimes every day. The point is, it requires consistent effort from both parties, which unfortunately doesn't seem to be the case with your friends. So no matter how hard you try, it won't work and they might find it annoying.   So make new friends. Get a hobby/go to places that has people of your age. Check out other tennis places or youth clubs. And you seriously need to show why you're fun/ny and interesting (but not in a cringey way). You say that one of your friendships is stale because there's nothing to talk about but uni and work -my god, that's stale! Both of you sound devastatingly boring. (Fine, I'm being harsh, you sound like friendly acquaintances my grandma's age.) I'd be out of that café in a flash if someone droned on about nothing but work. What are you interested in? Cooking, heavy death metal, gardening, airplanes, makeup, skateboarding, travel, TV shows, current events etc. etc. Talk about that.   TL;DR: LDRs difficult, make new friends, be interesting"

You'll feel sad and unhappy, and unsettled because you are making a huge change, and leaving someone you've spent 2 years with. Its completely normal. It hurts both people, not just the one who decides to end things.   Im not suggesting that you be cruel, quite the opposite. It is impossible for the one who is left behind to not crave and wish for the person they still desire to stay with them just a little longer, just to try a little harder, just to give it one more chance. And if you keep her in that mire, of hoping you'll change your mind, she doesnt get the clean break and a chance to get over you. It will just drag on for her.  As to your decission, I think you have described two people who are not compatible. You should be as bold as you say you are and go actively looking for a girl who has the same inclinations. You gotta be honest about that next time round, - Im pretty sure you did not disclose to your ex while you two were courting that you prefered rough sex, or in semi public places, or that you wanted to see her dress to show off her body. And isnt it also true that you saw she was insecure in her own skin early on but persisted with the relationship anyway. Dont do that next time. You know what you want, you know what you need, you dont spend your life with the opposite only to bemoan it later. You're young, but if you make the same mistake in your next relationships, you might find yourself with this dilemma in your 30s, and if you think its hard now, you have no idea.   The right choice is to not settle for anything you know you wont be happy with at 22. Thats just an unecessary compromise to make at such a young age."

relationships,3e0hdc,UnlikelyExplanations,24,Tue Jul 21 11:36:00 2015 UTC,"Answers to your questions:  -No, you shouldn't tell your ex-GF all the problems you had with her unless you plan on giving it another shot.  -No, you probably shouldn't give it another shot. She's not going to be able to change some of the things you don't like about her, and certainly not enough of them to be the person you want her to be - which is a different person.  -No, you shouldn't answer the email at all or any text messages or keep going to dinner with her, etc. You both need to heal from the break up and you have to do that separately.  -You will keep having this problem if you don't start telling people when you have problems with them. Some of this stuff could have been talked about and resolved or at least worked on. Some of it is just who your GF is, so try picking a different kind of girl next time (for example, someone who likes wearing the kind of clothes you find sexy and is more forward sexually.)  Look, I know you think it will make it easier for her if you give her a better reason for the breakup, but since you keep meeting with her and dragging it out, you're not making it easier for her. She's accepted what you told her so far, so I don't see any reason you can't stick with that. If you just can't, at least try not to be hurtful. She can't fix this stuff. She isn't sexually aggressive, it just isn't in her nature. She doesn't dress in a sexually suggestive way. She doesn't have intense conversations and seems to be a bit of a pushover. These are big personality things she just isn't going to be able to fix just to make you happy - and really you shouldn't want her to. She wouldn't be who she is if she changed so many things about herself just to please you even though if seems like she wants to be with you bad enough to try.  Your best bet is to move on and give her some space. Heal and find someone new who you aren't afraid to ask for what you want with (because you aren't blameless in this scenario, you didn't even try to work this stuff out with her) and move forward. She will do the same and someday you two can be friends again. That's the kindest thing you can do - for both of you."

You started feeling this way 3 weeks ago but didn't say a word?  Or did I not read that well enough?  I am going against the grain her I know but just call it the old stubbornness in me, but what really is the problem here?  You want her to be more open to sex that is dangerous and more open to different positions?  I'm going to guess that given the choice, which you did not give her, she would have gladly made modifications to keep you in her life.  It's totally up to you whether or not you want that I guess but it just seems to me like it would have been the fair thing to do unless you just wanted out altogether and if that is the case then basically you need to just send her a text or whatever stating that you are out and that you need to stop contacting each other as there is nothing to gain from it for either of you."

The way you described your girlfriend, she sounds very similar to me.  Personally I would like to be told what I did 'wrong', purely because after two years of a trusting and loving relationship I feel like she deserves that.  There are ways to tell her gently, don't make her feel like what she did was God awful. Like you said, if she doesn't feel like it's an issue, you shouldn't try and change her.  If you don't clear things up though she could be jumping to conclusions left right and centre.  You still care a lot for this girl, so she would understand you have no mean intent."
relationships,3e0hdc,Madombie,-5,Tue Jul 21 00:50:13 2015 UTC,I think she deserves to hear what she possibly could improve. People learn from mistakes you know:)
relationships,3e0hdc,BloqueEU,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:15:51 2015 UTC,"i completely disagree. people can figure out who they want to be, or improvements they want to make, without direction from an ex. if she wants to work on being braver and more assertive, or sexier and more adventurous, then great. she probably did notice that it was an area of incompatibility or conflict, so she can think about it and figure out if that's the direction she wants to go for future relationships. if she doesn't want to be that person, then telling her that's why you don't want to be with her isn't going to help either of you.   every single time i've been honest about specific personality/behaviour traits in a breakup, it has been horrible. no one is actually open to ""learning"" from someone who is dumping them. communicate it while you are in the relationship if something bothers you. work on being open when you notice incompatibilities/differences. express your hopes and preferences. then hopefully your partner isn't so confused when you leave them(people believe what they want to, anyway. i've had a couple relationships were i tried to be clear about my hesitations and concerns but my exes were still ""confused"" when we broke up and demanded better reasons). don't do try to have those analyses after you've broken up.   everyone deserves to be loved by someone who appreciates them the way they are. there isn't some perfect person she should try to be to be better at relationships. it's a hard lesson to believe, but a breakup doesn't necessarily mean anyone needs to change. it doesn't even necessarily have to have a reason, or one that the dumpee can understand. it usually just means that you didn't fit together that well. an ex can't teach you that.. it's something each of us has to figure out on our own."
relationships,3e0hdc,sweetpeppah,3,Tue Jul 21 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"Have you ever clearly and explicitly told her what kind of sex you want (all of it) and how often, not to be selfish but simply what you know you need in life to be happy? And mismatched libidos lead to r/deadbedrooms and honestly all the confusion you're feeling. It took me many years to just come out and say exactly what I wanted and just how badly I need it. Not selfishly because I will do anything she ever wants me to do for her as well. When both learn to really satisfy each others needs, the human ""pohn far"" and many other relationship distractions disappear. Because blood fever from a lust deficit is toxic. I believe the happiest of all relationships come from knowing and fulfilling each others sexual/intimacy needs and doing your absolute damnedest for each other should be a core requirement before marriage. When these human needs are routinely met, it's amazing how many other things just fall into place."
relationships,3e0hdc,afarkas2222,3,Tue Jul 21 07:05:57 2015 UTC,"I just want to say, OP, if my ex's had put this much thoughtfulness and kindness into breaking up with me, I wouldn't have a lot of the emotional hang-ups I do now. You sound like a decent guy and the reasons you stated for breaking up with her don't make you anything but yourself.   Sometimes people change, sometimes people aren't really who we thought they were, and that doesn't make them bad people, either.   Whether you want to get back together or not, I think the best thing is to take a nice clean break from each other and feel it out. It's likely right now she's in overdrive, she's scared, she's hurt, and she's grasping at everything to get you back. People don't like having their worlds changed. It wouldn't surprise me if she's had some problems with the relationship or places where she wasn't happy herself, but right now she's hurting and is pushing those feelings away.  The problem with talking out why you weren't invested/happy with the relationship anymore can do more harm than good. She might hear it and acknowledge it, sure, and she might actually try to satisfy you sexually how you want it, but is that fair to her if she's not into it? Not really.   She'll probably be more adventurous in bed, do all the things you like... for awhile. And then she'll revert back to her comfort zone and you'll be in the same spot. People are far more likely to change when they're about to lose something."
relationships,3e0hdc,_TIXCY_,3,Tue Jul 21 08:48:29 2015 UTC,"You two will not work it out; you both have irreconcilable expectations from the relationship.  She will remain Miss Timidity, you will remain Mr. Temerity, and there will always be a vast gulf of mismatched values between the two of you.  Trying to meet in the middle will make you both resentful and unhappy.  Don't drag this out, love.  Make it a clean break; you're just prolonging her agony otherwise."
relationships,3e0hdc,Durbee,2,Tue Jul 21 09:01:11 2015 UTC,"I think you said it best here:   I hadn't been getting off lately because she had been turning me off in several ways - and a few of them were things about her personality, that she likes about herself, and wouldn't want to change.   The things you want are OK, and the fact that she wants something opposite is also OK. You're just desperately mismatched. Learn from this experience and understand how important certain things are to you. From now on you will be able to recognize incompatibility in these things much earlier in the relationship. I applaud you for not listing all the things she could've done better to keep you. She has low self-esteem so she would probably take it as a cue to mold herself into something that might satisfy you more and that just wouldn't benefit anyone.   I recommend she does something about her self-esteem. That's pretty much the only real problem she has. All the other things are just preferences. Sure, it would be possible to compromise on them, but this seems important to you so why not just look for someone else who has the same preferences and values as you? Much less friction, much more satisfaction.  All in all, you did the right thing breaking up with her. The way you did it was also commendable. Now stop contacting her, don't meet up for dinner, if she invites you places tell her you think it'd be best for you to spend some time apart.    But I don't know which. I don't know which of those I tell her and which would be just mean to tell her.   Well... I guess you could tell her about the low self-esteem, but self-esteem is widely misunderstood. I firmly believe healthy self-esteem is a result of certain attitudes in life, not a source or a standalone thing. For example if I am internally consistent and self-aware, chances are I'll have good self-esteem. Not the other way around. Anyway, you could tell her to speak to someone about it and then see how many other issues are resolved by her gaining more confidence. (Way she dresses could be a confidence issue, BUT it could also be a simple preference in which case it wouldn't ""resolve"" at all) But all the other things? I wouldn't recommend it.   And I really don't know if it's worth the try or if I should just stay single, focus on myself and later look for a girl that's more fit to me and I to her.   IMO just stay single, focus on yourself and later look for a girl that's more fit to you. Recovering self-esteem takes a long, long long time, it's completely out of your hands, and no guarantees. She might have other underlying issues that caused the low self-esteem in which case it might not even be ""raisable"" to an extent you'd like.  But she's 22 years old. She has to figure this shit out for herself. You can't make a horse drink and so on. She has to decide it's time for a positive change.   I understand you had something good, you love each other. I get it. But the impulse to break up with her came from a good place. It's best for both of you. Remain strong."
relationships,3e0hdc,illinoiscentralst,2,Tue Jul 21 09:02:08 2015 UTC,"You are a good person and you did the right thing. You are aware of the issues in this relationship and they are more than a plausible reason to break up. You did it in the kindest way possible. You should not feel in any way guilty or bad.  However, I don't think your ex-girlfriend has quite understood why this is happening, and this is affecting you as well. I suggest not cutting contact just yet and explaining to her the very things you've said in this thread in a more gentle way. Perhaps use e-mail so you give her more time to think about it and avoid seeing a reaction/response that would be too emotional for you to handle. Do not leave the door open for a second chance! Don't be too harsh, but reassure her that this is your final decision and you don't want to change it. ""I think we are incompatible. You are a wondeful person, but there are some little things that break my heart like your lack of opinion or curiosity to explore our sexualities. I do not want you to change because otherwise you wouldn't be you and the you I know is an amazing person. This amazing person is just not the partner I want and need in my life right now. You will find somebody who loves these things about you and who appreciates you more than I did.""  More importantly, however, find your own peace about it. Your ex-girlfriend is obviously important and you don't want to hurt her, but you must not avoid hurting her feelings at the expense of your own. I sincerely wish you best of luck and I hope that you will be in a better place of mind after all of this!"
relationships,3e0hdc,dropout-eloise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:34:33 2015 UTC,"Don't tell her all that. It is too much and too much for her to hear. Combined with rejection that sort of critique does her no good.Plus the message sounds too much like 'do more in bed' not 'find someone that values you for who you are, and feel more confident in yourself"".   You have no path forward with you to together, so you have an obligation to her to do what lets her move on best. IMO that is No Contact (read the link) because antyhing else doesn't let you both progress. You CAN walk away and not talk to her again, or at least for a couple fo years. In fact you must.   As to what you CAN say to her, it is minimal. Even if she could change, it would not be fast enough to fix your relationship with her. So anything that makes her think she can fix herself for you, is cruel. So it has to be very clear that it won;t happen. You are incompatible and you have to be OK with that.  All you can say is ""I have thought a lot about us and why I feel like I do. I think I am learning a lot about myself, and I think I see differences if the lives we want. I need to go out and find the life I want. That probably involves throwing myself into the unknown, and I can only do that on my own. You need to find the life you want because you are wonderful and special and I am fully confident that you will find someone you just click with. I wish that were me because i love you, but I love you too much and respect myself too much to force that when I see that our futures are diverging.""  Anything you say about boldness will be heard are her being boring. Anything about sex will be heard as her being useless, frigid and vanilla. The emotional hurt fo the breakup overwhelms hearing the advice, and she is so far from over it enough to hear it is not true."
relationships,3e0hdc,LazyG,2,Tue Jul 21 10:18:03 2015 UTC,"I have to commend you for going about the breakup in such a thoughtful way, and for the way you are being really self reflective and self aware. You sound like an incredibly kind person.   That being said, I think that your kindness may end up unintentionally hurting her if you move forward with the idea of seeing her again and talking in detail about the feelings you just expressed about non compatibility and the reasons why, and about whether you can work on changing those feelings.   You already said these are things about her personality that you don't think she would want to change. You outlined stuff in detail and it really does sound like you are incompatible on a number of points that are pretty important to you. I think you are having second thoughts right now, but it would be very unfair of you to flip flop back and forth on this matter unless you are one hundred percent sure you can work through it. It seems from your post that you are not.   You also run the risk that, right now, she is hurting very badly and may be willing to say or doing anything to get you back. If you are as different as you have outlined here, she may end up compromising core parts of herself as a person in order to save the relationship.  At the moment she will be in a place where she is struggling to come to terms with the breakup and looking for reasons why. You have already had 2 in depth conversations with her about it....I'm sorry, i know you want to help - but you really are no longer the right person to help her through this. Every time you are meeting up she is in hope that she will be in some way able to fix this. It is keeping her hope alive when she needs to move on. Her family and friends need to be the ones supporting her. At the moment, unfortunately, you cannot be her friend. That may be possible in the future, however you need a break of several months AT LEAST from seeing her as a friend, or being in contact with her. This is the only way she will be able to properly move on. I know it will suck for you too, as you love her as a person, but please believe me when i say the best thing you can do for her is tell her that you want a few months at least of no contact to allow you both to move on. No phone calls or texts, just no contact.   I think the conversations you've had with her already are sufficient. You are just not compatible. Going deeply into those reasons may hit her self esteem hard. There will be someone else out there who loves her and has similar interests and someone out there for you who will love you and have similar interests.   This is one of those situations where it's just very sad that 2 people aren't right for each other any more. Please give yourselves both a chance to find someone who is better suited.   Best of luck. I know it's very hard."
relationships,3e0hdc,lonewytch,3,Tue Jul 21 10:38:52 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, a lot of people will tell you that you should stay firm, stay broken up, and limit contact with her. I agree that it is not fair to give her false hope if there isn't any.  At the same time, it seems as though you never addressed any of these issues with her properly when you were together. I know you want to respect who she is, but if you don't tell her what you need from her, you don't know whether it's something she would be willing to do, happily. I'm saying this from the point of view of someone who was very similar to your girlfriend when I was 22, and was also in a relationship with someone who was like you, very intense and wanting to push boundaries etc. I was nervous about approaching people to ask for things and was quite shy about a lot of stuff. He was frustrated by it, but there were so many things about us that we had in common and enjoyed together. He loved my mind and how caring I was etc.  He talked to me about these issues and how he felt about things, and I was open to exploring things with him. He totally changed the way I felt about myself, about sex, everything. I became a lot more confident and we had a great time for another few years until I finally ended it because we both moved away for school and the long distance thing didn't work out.  I think you owe it to her to let her know a bit more about the reasons you feel you are incompatible, the things you have said here. If she is who she is and doesn't want to change, then it will help her to realise that you two really are incompatible and will make it easier for her. It may also help her think about why she is like that and work on her self esteem if she wants to, because this kind of shyness about things like learning to drive or asking for things will really negatively impact her whole life, and not just in relationships.  At 22, you are both still growing and changing and she has the opportunity at this age to become more confident and see the world in a new way. It's not your responsibility to make that happen for her, but I feel that if you could talk to her more openly and honestly about these things then it could help her. If she wants to work on it and open up more and grow her confidence then perhaps you two could reconcile. It sounds like you really love her and there are things about your relationship that you value a lot.  You have to think about whether you really gave her the opportunity to change and helped her change, or even asked her if she wanted to change these things. It may be that if you had spoken with her about these issues a month ago she would have been open to changing, not just for you, but for herself. In my relationships if there is a problem or something I don't like I will talk to my partner about it and see if there is a way we can work it out, before deciding to break up. It seems like maybe you didn't try that first."
relationships,3e0hdc,JeopardyLeyton,2,Tue Jul 21 11:02:37 2015 UTC,"You've gotten a lot of comments saying that you should just call it quits, go no contact, there's no hope of reconciliation, you indeed shouldn't voice your reasons for dissatisfaction as that'd crush her even more/make her become a doormat to you, etc. While I'm sure those commentators and yourself are just coming from a place of kindness for both you and your partner, my first reaction to reading your two posts today was sadness and frustration. It sounds like you guys did love each other a lot, and were both very kind and understanding to one another. It just really frustrates me that you guys hadn't communicated sooner about things that were causing dissatisfaction in the relationship. Because of your kindness to each other, I feel like there would've been a good chance that things would've worked out had you spoken up earlier.  Indeed, this relationship may still not be salvageable and it's likely that your ex couldn't change that many things about herself as quickly as you need... and the timing's rather problematic, because you do run the risk of her doing things that are too far out of her comfort zone and becoming a complete doormat in attempt to save the relationship if you finally speak up now. But had you communicated this all before you pulled the plug - given her a chance to work on the relationship, so to speak - things might have turned out different. You keep saying that you don't think she should have to change herself, but perhaps she'd have been welcoming to the change and just needed that extra little push. Plus, it's normal for people to be adaptable and changeable, especially at your ages. And sometimes, in relationships, partners change and inspire each other for the better. (For instance, I feel motivated by my high-achieving partner to do more with my life.) I feel that you really kinda blindsided her - it's evident, from her remark about doing exercises to last longer in bed, that she really had no clue what your real issues were. You didn't make the effort to communicate that with her prior to breaking up with her, due to you wanting to be kind to her AND due to your own fear... and maybe, deep down, you simply didn't want to continue on with her regardless so you didn't give her a chance.  But anyway, my point is that I feel there would've been a chance she'd happily have worked on some aspects of herself for the benefit of the relationship as well as herself, and for you, if you had only brought up your issues more straightforwardly and sooner. After all, it seems like all of the qualms you had about her stemmed from a singular aspect: her timidity (which, as you pointed out, probably rose from her low self-esteem). Her fear of saying the wrong things and expressing her opinions leading to bland conversations and her lack of initiative in sex - both of these issues seem to have a common theme in timidity. I just felt like a deep conversation with her about this - you'd have to do the hard work of broaching it in the first place of course - would've helped things.  In this respect, the lack of communication seemed to have come from your own timidity."
relationships,3e0hdc,attemptnumber12,2,Tue Jul 21 13:56:27 2015 UTC,"I want to preface this by saying you were right to break up, you seem incompatible and I'm sure that those incompatibilities would have gotten worse had you two tried to take things further rather than better.  However, I want to add for the sake of your next relationship, that you seem to have some issues with communicating how you feel and how you'd like your partner to respond to your feelings. I'd advise you to work towards being more open and communicative in your next relationship, so your partner is better able to understand you and your needs. I am in no way saying you should get back together with your ex, because I think the incompatibilities boil down to a lot more than just communication. But I do think you need to work on saying how you feel and what you need out of a relationship in order to help you attract a partner who is better suited for you in the future."

I know you're feeling an awful lot of uncertainty about your decision, but I want to add to the reassurance you're getting here that you have broken up with your girlfriend with kindness, integrity, and consideration.  This is about the classiest breakup possible.  Your conscience can be clean.  As far as all the issues you spilled that led to your decision... I think ruminating on whether or not they could be fixed is rather pointless. Sometimes, especially in the relationships we have when we're very young, the time and effort and pain and difficulty of fixing issues like this after so much damage has been done is not worth it.  You're swimming upstream against very basic incompatibility.  Incompatibility in multiple areas of a relationship results in a mismatch.  Plain, simple, straightforward.  You can't spend your life trying to cram 10lbs into a 5lb sack.  You are both going to be okay.    Now you must continue to maintain your integrity by sticking with your decision and not leading her on or giving her hope.  It would be cruel to do so, even if it seems it would make her happier in the short run."
relationships,3e0hdc,whenifeellikeit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:20:53 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what the reason is, but if if you feel you are unhappy and need to leave, then you go ahead and do it. You too aren't married or have kids, your commitments are only to each other. You can't force yourself to be in a relationship. If you are, then you should rethink yourself and your actions. It doesn't matter what the reason is. Just don't be a dick about it. You owe it to her to tell her you want to break up. There won't be a reason that will make it acceptable. She will get her feelings hurt. The only thing that will be different is her reaction towards you. You can either be honest and risk being thought of an asshole, or be thought of as a good person.   Think about that, and then decide what to do."
relationships,3e0hdc,teh_fizz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:09:44 2015 UTC,"Here is my gut instinct: you two have fundamental incompatibilities and continuing to try to have a relationship will only cause more pain. Be grateful for the good things you had, mourn the loss of the dream of being together, and move on.  Probably best if you two stop talking for a month or two, to make the break final and give a chance for the feelings to die down."
relationships,3e0hdc,nonnyhabitat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"Like the other commenters, I'm impressed at your maturity.  You have handled this pretty darn well thus far.  It sounds to me like you are not 100% certain with your decision, and that you still very much care for your ex girlfriend.     If there is something we can try, we should try working it out.   I haven't become the typical, jaded r/relationships reader yet, so I want to explore the idea of staying with your ex rather than moving forward with a break-up.  If you were looking to make things better with her and to resolve some of the issues you were having with your relationship, the key, as usual, is communication.   I feel like her low self-esteem makes her believe that she is not worthy of an opinion, or that whatever she says is probably wrong, or there is just so much more, and everyone might think little of her because of it. And that's ok, people are allowed to feel like that, but it is something I fight against myself and that eats me slowly if is next to me. I don't know how I can try helping her change that, and I don't even believe she thinks that is an issue. And if she doesn't thinks that's an issue, who am I to want her to change that? I shouldn't be trying to build her to be the perfect girlfriend for me, because that would stop her from being herself, and that would be wrong!   Others may disagree with me here, but what if she DOES want to change those things?  I didn't get the sense from this post that you have had real discussions with her about how you feel about this -- that you think she's too scared to have opinions, and that this bothers you.  Maybe, if you had an honest conversation with her about this, she might open up to you about her self-esteem issues and tell you that she DOES want to overcome them and become a stronger person who can express her opinions.  Some of the issues in your sex life also seem to stem from her lack of self-esteem, as you admit.  Perhaps, if she became more self-confident, many of your sexual desires that are currently lacking could be fulfilled.  It may even increase her libido.  My question to you is, what have you done to address her self-esteem issues?  How have you tried to build her up in the past?  You're her partner, the person she (likely) cares about most in the world.  If anyone can make her feel strong, confident, smart, sexy, etc., it's you.  Maybe she's the type of person that desires plenty of words of affirmation -- compliments, telling her how much you love her and why you love her, telling her that you love her body and that she should feel confident showing it off, etc.    She may have deeply-rooted issues that are causing her low self-esteem.  Maybe it's not something you can fix, and maybe she needs to see a professional.  Maybe you have tried to build her up and make her feel more confident to express her opinions on things without fear of being ridiculed.  If you have, please let us know.    By no means am I suggesting that you should become this girl's crutch, or work for years and years of your life having to constantly reassure her and build up her self-esteem.  I'm just suggesting that, perhaps if you had an honest conversation about that where she tells you that she wants to be more confident and that she thinks you encouraging her would help her get over her self-esteem issues, maybe that's something you could try.   I have several problems with the relationship, and I don't know which of them I should address and which I shouldn't and if we should give it another try or not   It's really up to you.  If you love this woman and think that she could be the one you want to spend the rest of your life with, then I don't think you should hold anything back.  Communicate.  Risk hurting her feelings.  As I said, she may already be at the point where she needs to speak with a professional to help her through her self-esteem issues.  If that's the case, and she gets very upset by you telling her that her lack of a backbone, inability to express her opinions, to feel confident, etc. is something that bothers you and that she needs to work on... if that makes her upset, then that's okay.  Maybe you straight-up suggest to her that she see a professional for this.  As others have said, though, if you don't think she wants to change, if you don't think she can become more self-confident or doesn't want to, and if you think things will drag on the way they have, the way that has resulted in you feeling like you can't be in the relationship anymore, then you should be more firm in your convictions and let her go.  Completely.  Don't drag it out by continuing to have dinners with her and get into a long e-mail exchange.  If she's not the one and you don't think you can be happy in your relationship for the long term, stand strong and end it.  I would just keep in mind that no one is perfect.  All relationships have their issues.  All long-term relationships require work and effort.  They all require open communication.  I have no doubt that, especially at such a young age, you can find someone else that will make you happy.  It's up to you whether you think you'll be happier with someone else or with your ex.    Best wishes."
relationships,3e0hdc,bareley,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:25 2015 UTC,"So...all the stuff you listed, sexual and otherwise?  It's okay that you feel that way and want those things.  The only not okay part is that you stayed for two years with someone who couldn't give them to you.  You keep talking about her low self-esteem, but what about yours?  I mean, I think you found some...the fact that you broke up with her at all attests to that...but you need to realize that you deserve to have the things you want too.  Liking exciting/public sex and lingerie and toys doesn't make you a bad person, okay?  And next time, after you realize your partner isn't into that stuff a few months in talk about it.  Some people might surprise you.  If that fails, obviously, end it sooner rather than later."

Your ex is clearly sweet, kind and respectful, and there is nothing wrong with that. However, there is also nothing wrong in wanting more than that.  I considered dating a guy like that, because he was so nice that I didn't want to hurt his feelings, but in the end I decided not to, because I knew it wouldn't make me happy. Like you I need someone more adventurous, willing to speak their mind, take charge, try new things, and yes get a bit dirty now and then. In short, someone who challenges me, and while this guy was nice and sweet, that's all he was to me.  No matter how great a person this girl might be, it doesn't mean that she is the one for you. If you want to give it another go, then great. But if you go into it hoping that she will change, then don't go into it at all. She might attempt to change for you, but chances are that it will just make things worse. You both deserve the chance at something more, someone who will love and appreciate you for who you are."
relationships,3e33js,squarrior,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:31 2015 UTC,"Holy hell you moved fast. You're wayyyy too young to be shafted with being stuck in a dead bedroom scenario, not to mention not being all-in committed once you bought a house.   There's nothing wrong with having a different libido than your partner. Some people can deal with it, some people can't, but it's a perfectly legit reason to not want to be in a relationship if you value that in your life.   I think the best thing you can do is stop being distant and just sit down and talk to her up front. Tell her that you're feeling iffy about the future and that you have issues with the libido difference. It's better to get it out in the open and discuss now, rather than 5-10 years down the road when you've wasted more time."
relationships,3e33js,TheFeelsMachine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:57 2015 UTC,"Stop for a moment and consider that you have only been with your girlfriend for 2 months, not 6 years. Would you still have any doubts about if you could spend the rest of your life with her?  Being sexually Unsatisfied for the rest of your life, posting on reddit and going to counselling, for the rest of your life  It's completely normal and sane to be scared. Think of all the women out there who share the same passions as you, have the same libido and preferences as you, they're all out there and if you marry your gf, who you're already questioning if you're compatible with, you will forego the chance to ever meet anyone else, unless you end up divorcing, and by that time it's possible things might be complicated with kids.  I suggest you do some soul searching and ask yourself what your real fears are. Being afraid of being alone is not a good reason to stay in this relationship.  Air out all of your concerns to your gf and see if anything can be changed. If not, just bail man."

My family would say that shouldn't concern me/it's not my business, but it's frustrating to watch.   But the other aspects that I described above make it hard, too, to seriously connect with her. And I really would rather have no relationship than a fake relationship with a sister, but maybe that's foolish thinking. Our relationship would essentially consist of small talk over board games.  Edit: As long as my sister is not financially independent, I will always question the sincerity of her relationship with my parents as well as the relatives that donate to her."

For those reasons alone, this is not a relationship worth maintaining right now. It could be later, if she changes her ways.  Find an ally in your family (maybe extended family) to confide in about this if you can, otherwise you have friends to lean on. You are not obligated to have contact with her just because she is family. IMO she sounds like she's on the path to becoming a truly despicable person, and you can just tell people you don't want any part of that."

Obviously I don't know you or your situation, but maybe it's time to put relationships on the back burner for right now- none of this sounds healthy for you or the warm bodies you're dating.   Take time. Be casual, make friends, date, court. Meeting, kinda liking each other and then having sex isn't a relationship. Don't force it- rub one out, smoke a blunt, hug a pillow. It's okay to need human interaction and companionship, but sleeping with people and leading them on because they are as good as it gets for you right now, sucks in a number of ways, for both of you, but I'm sure you've experienced them already so I don't need to list them.

She says she was a very emotional person as an adolescent, but then I guess something happened to her.  I don't know what it was, and as far as I know she doesn't either, but she's been dealing with this for 30+ years.  She's been in therapy, and I only know a couple details about that, but one thing I heard is that the therapist thinks she's afraid of emotion because it could get completely out of control.  Basically, she feels so much that she's stopped herself from being able to feel any more in order to protect herself.  She's had trouble dealing with this in therapy, but she also has 30 years of this being ingrained.  You might do better since it's just starting with you."

You are avoiding thinking about your mom, and pull out about seeing things that make you feel anything about your bf. Try to give yourself some time to actually remember your mom, the good and the bad times, then you'll come to terms with her passing, even if you don't cry. Grieving doesn't necessarily mean crying, just having some time to process what happened. Same thing with your breakup. <internet hug>"
relationships,3e0xit,xcg22,45,Tue Jul 21 02:46:54 2015 UTC,"First thing, don't compare your relationship to other relationships, that's an awful thing to do. You don't know how both people are feeling, the history behind them or anything else. The fastest way to kill something special, is to compare it to something else.  I don't believe she is ""using you"", I believe you are both young and don't know how to always express your feelings. Another guy has told her the same things you feel, it just might be something she does and she doesn't realize it. Have you told her when she is being distant? If she doesn't know when it's happening, how can she solved the problem?  Always communicate. It doesn't matter if you live in the same house or an ocean away, communication is important. If you can't talk to her, nothing will get better. Did you express how you felt when she didn't want you to stay? Maybe she had to get up early, maybe she's not used to someone being in her bed, did you spend any part of that day together? Just because you couldn't sleep together, doesn't mean she doesn't like you.  By affection, I know some people who just aren't into physical touching. They love the hell out of their SO, but they just don't want to hugged in public or randomly. That's okay, maybe your girlfriend is like that. That doesn't make her a bad person, it just means she doesn't like those things.  I think you need to talk to her, before running into ""she's a terrible person and you need to leave her!"" There's a lot of unanswered questions here and it just sounds like a good talk is in order."
relationships,3e0xit,petitefox,3,Tue Jul 21 05:40:01 2015 UTC,"Your first two points are valid. But yes, we have communicated about her being distant before. From what we've discussed, it seems like she has no control over it.  It's not like we haven't communicated at all about these things. We have a lot, actually.But like you said, I think being young does make it difficult to express our feelings. So despite our communication, it might not necessarily allow as much progress as necessary.  As for the spending the night thing, she absolutely knows how I felt about it that one time. And she happened to feel very differently. Her reasoning was that it was going to be a really sad goodbye no matter what, so she wanted to ""rip the bandaid off"" so to speak and get it over with sooner rather than later. I completely disagree with her logic and am still hurt that she felt that way, but I respect her enough to understand those were her wishes and to leave them at that.  And if we have differences on being into physical affection, don't you think that might cause a lot of problems in our relationship? It's already a difference that stresses me out and one of the reasons for this post. Never said it made her a bad person, but if she's not into it, then I think we as a couple have an issue there.  All in all, I'm not just going to leave her all of sudden. I agree talking to her is the first step. I just hope I'm able to adequately express how I feel."
relationships,3e0xit,Alesxana,15,Tue Jul 21 05:51:01 2015 UTC,"You, and your girlfriend, should look at/read the book ""The 5 Love Languages"" by Gary Chapman. It's a book about different ways people communicate their love to one another.   The distance you're feeling between you two might just be because you communicate your love differently. Obviously, it's also something you both have to work on, showing the other person love through their love language."
relationships,3e0xit,petitefox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:49:02 2015 UTC,"We're actually both familiar with the five languages.

I think she might just have trouble expressing those things, though."
relationships,3e0xit,kasunder,5,Tue Jul 21 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the misunderstanding, I was referring to other people saying she was a bad person or using you. It seems to be a /relationship thing to yell, ""BREAK UP"" ""RED FLAG"" ""MANIPULATION"" when maybe the person just isn't good at feelings. Some people can't show how they feel or they mess up, it doesn't mean they're a bad person, they're human, they make mistakes.  I think you do have some compatibility issues, but there will always be a few in every relationship though obviously some are bigger than others. It takes work to find out how you fit together and to make sure everyone is happy, so there's hope! You don't have to leave her because sometimes she's not good at hugging. I second the Love Languages, because you might express your love in one way why she expresses her in another. Figure out what she likes the most and what you like the most, but I'm assuming yours is physical touch.   I don't think the answer is simply to break up or that you two are wholly wrong for each other. You seem to really like her, and she treats you well except when she becomes distant which is a problem with everyone for her. You also said if you broke up she would just wonder what she could do to fix it, she wouldn't freak out or blame you which is also a positive sign. Just remember, with any relationship, it takes work!   There's no magic fix it button, but figuring out what you two can do together that satisfies both of you would help. She also seems to be a bit guarded, as with your example of her leaving. Sometimes people would rather start the pain early and get it over with quickly, because that's the best strategy in their mind. That doesn't mean she didn't want to be with you, she just thought it was better to run than stay, if that makes any sense.   ""Any partner we choose will hurt us at one time or another. No relationship, even the most ideal, has unwaveringly smooth sailing … There will always be differences between lovers.""  ""People say I love you all the time - when they say, ‘take an umbrella, it’s raining,’ or ‘hurry back,’ or even ‘watch out, you’ll break your neck.’ There are hundreds of ways of wording it - you just have to listen for it, my dear."""

But yes, I understand there's no magic fix button. I do love her and want to work things out. This is the first time I've been a relationship that was difficult for one person and so easy for the other, so I guess I'm just still trying to find my footing. If I'm being honest, I do wish she was less guarded around me. I wish she could trust and be comfortable around me the way I am with her, and that's actually another thing I probably need to talk about with her.  Thank you for your thoughts. I really appreciate it."
relationships,3e0xit,snuff74,24,Tue Jul 21 13:53:38 2015 UTC,"Oh man this made me really sad and scared at the same time. Mainly because I'm in an almost identical situation except I'm in the position of your girlfriend. Details are scary similar, right down to not being able to sleep when my SO is around.  I don't know either of you, but I can try to explain what she maybe, might be feeling. There's every chance your girlfriend loves you more than she knows how to process or express. I want to be with my SO for the rest of my life, but for the life of me can't get over my fear of looking stupid or not being reciprocated with the same amount of love, so I refrain from expressing both my love and my concerns that we might not be on the same page. All of my distance and flip flopping personality wise come from the fear that my SO can't possibly love me as much as I love him. One day I'm so overcome by love for him and I'm warm, the next day I fear that I love him too much so I withdraw and I'm called ""cold"".  Take all of your concerns and just have a real, honest conversation with your girlfriend. Stop thinking about deal breakers or fears and just create a completely trusting space to talk about wanting that emotional connection. When you come to people with love and appreciation, most of the time that's what you'll receive in return.  If, after that, she still can't seem to connect with you. THEN start thinking about moving on. But I'd say give her the benefit of the doubt. Stop letting your fears whirl around in your head, and having a very honest yet eager conversation with her. Then you can say you tried everything and you'll know you're not crazy for wanting to move on."

But I guess I feel I would be lying to myself and to her if I didn't express my love, and I only hope I can receive as much in return. If I had to guess, I would say that this doesn't really seem like her. At least if it is, she has never shown any side of herself that indicates those feelings. Honestly I would love for that to be it, but it just doesn't strike me as being her. I'm afraid coldness is just a natural state for her. From what she's told me, she seems to think it is.  We've had a lot of conversations. I think both of us probably aren't the best at communicating our thoughts and feelings because nothing has ever really come from our conversations, despite them usually being pretty serious. So I do know I need to talk with her. I'm just hoping I can adequately express how I feel."
relationships,3e0xit,Jacob_961,9,Tue Jul 21 14:01:14 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you guys might just be mismatched.  If you prefer to be more warm and affectionate and she doesn't, that doesn't necessarily mean that she is a bad person or that she's using you, it could just mean that you are two different people and you need to be with someone who is more warm and affectionate and she needs to be with someone who is colder and less affectionate. Especially if you see people in warmer relationships and wish you were in one.  I am more warm and affectionate like you are and I don't think I could live in a relationship like you describe. I would feel just as you do - that I love them more than they love me. It's hard to know if that's really true from what you've told us. Only you can really know the truth in that. And it's true that while you're apart things are more difficult for the relationship in general.  But what I don't hear you saying is anything about how things have been worse since you've been apart or that she is cold since you've been apart - if anything it seems like you've been noticing it all year and maybe are just reflecting on it more now that you have time away from her. And that means it's not the distance that's doing it - it's just a fundamental incompatibility between the two of you.  And it's ok if that's the case. The point of dating is to see who you mesh together with. You've had a reasonable time to get to know this girl and you've noticed that despite some very good qualities she has some things about her that you don't want to live with for the long haul. That's ok. That's good actually. I had a break up once that was after about a years long relationship, like yours. I didn't want to end it and when he did I was so upset about it. But looking back I can see how right he was - we were just so wrong for each other and even though we were both good people, we were bad together. Not bad for each other, that's not the same thing, we just weren't right for each other. And now I'm married and happy and have been for 13 years - so all's well that ends well, right?  Sometimes all the talking in the world won't get you past the fact that two people just shouldn't be together. I don't know if that's where you are - only you can answer that. But if you are, just be honest and move forward. There's no shame in it.  TL;DR Maybe you're fundamentally incompatible, if so move on."

However, I understand that it can be hard to being these conversations up in the middle of LD. If you will be back together soon, then it would probably better to have conversations about relationships issues in person. If you will be apart for a while, it might be better to address them now.  As for emotional and physical expression, consider trying to  get to the root of the mismatch, rather than the end result. Having a discussion (or several) about how both of you express your feelings, as this could help her realize you need a bit more attention, or you realize that she could be showing it, just in a different way than expected.   The next step would be to try to compromise on how to change your respective behaviors to accommodate one another. It could be that you need to have two bed(room)s for sleeping in the long run and for her to make a more conscious effort to initiate affection."

We've tried to have conversations before, but I don't think my thoughts were quite this organized and the conversations didn't really make to much progress.

relationships,3e0xit,CSNX,2,Tue Jul 21 08:23:32 2015 UTC,"Look, you guys are young and you say you both know and she openly admits she's ""emotionally stunted"". That's what this boils down to. Now you have two options: Stick around and see if it changes (can she maybe attend counseling? or does she think her ""coldness"" is the better approach to have because it lessens the chance of getting hurt.)  Second option is if you decide you want to be in a relationship with someone who's on the same wavelenght so to speak. For example I'm a person who enjoys touch a lot, just some physical contact, hugs, kisses, arm around shoulders, holding hands, some sort of touching with my partner during regular activities/hanging out/going places. So I'm naturally well matched with my partner who is exactly the same way about touching.  I've dated people where I was the touchy one and had to remind myself to give them space. This was rarely the main reason of why it didn't work out, but it overall makes both parties sort of uncomfortable - to be constantly subtly rejected when all you want is human touch, or for them I'd imagine it was to be constantly bombarded with subtle touching when they liked their space or something.  So after I started dating my SO there were of course thousands of things we had in common but I found myself telling friends that we're just so, so well matched in the touch department it feels like a permanent hole was filled. It was an incredibly great feeling. Maybe you need to experience that before you settle for a LTR. Maybe not, maybe you'll lose the need for touch and intimacy in time or decide it's not all that important in your relationship.   But you're young, so I hope you'll get to experience it someday. Maybe your girlfriend will change a bit and be more open to it, I don't know. I just know that what you ask of her is totally understandable and to receive it is heavenly."

On a very stressful day (from work, school, or one of the million other things I have going on) I become distant from everyone. It's not personal I just feel like I need to be left alone for some time to relax. Does this mean I love my SO any less? Heck no! I just need some space to breathe. I think your SO might be feeling the same way. However, she can approach it differently perhaps. I noticed my distance was affecting my boyfriend so now when I've had a stressful day and I just need to relax I simply tell him ""hey, school, work, etc was very stressful today. I'd like to relax for a few hours, I'm going to turn off my phone for a bit. Love you."" This can make my attitude seem more understanding. I am also not a very affectionate person. Does this mean I love my SO any less? Nope! Just communicate to her on how you feel when she is distant and not very affectionate.

relationships,3e0xit,jacksrequiem,3,Tue Jul 21 10:27:57 2015 UTC,"If you are too romantic, and maybe have a flare for the ""dramatic"" and she does not, maybe it does not mean she is cold, but that she expresses her feelings differently. Maybe you should talk to her (without fighting and when you get to see her) about what you feel regarding the way she expresses herself. Remember that you are not forced to stay in a relationship if it does not make you happy. You are right on one thing about what you said: you are giving her too much emotional power. Say if you were playing a videogame and your character started at level 100, you would be bored as hell because things would be so easy for you. But if you have to fight for months to level up well you would feel very rewarded and would not want to lose your saved game right? Leave her alone, do not mistreat her but do not worship her or ask her about your relationship. She can do what she wants, but you TOO. always stay strong and never subdue yourself to no one. Note that this does not mean ""try to subdue other"" it just means: do not force things. Do not be violent. If someone fights you, be it your girlfriend, a dog or the cashier at the supermarket, do not fight fire with fire. Be cool, always. If you love this girl, give her her space. And if you find out that she is not really interested, don't try to force anything. Never make yourself look as a clingy person. Do other stuff. Go out for a walk and talk to people. Or have a coffee alone or with a friend or two (if you have). Get a new haircut or buy some new clothes. DO NOT make this girl the center of your life. Do not obsess, and she will be at your feet. I guarantee it. Best of luck OP!"
relationships,3e0xit,AllisonWeatherwax,2,Tue Jul 21 12:23:38 2015 UTC,"It sounds to me like she just wants more personal space than you do. Time alone, time not being touched, time not waxing poetic about feelings. Honestly, I relate a lot more to her than to you reading this post; I really get frustrated when people take it personally if I want some time to myself, or to sleep by myself before a big stressful event (eg traveling).   I think calling her ""emotionally unavailable"" because she isn't ALWAYS, 24/7 as sappy as you is honestly insulting and very presumptuous, but I'm probably projecting. But I can picture if you were to paint you in the same negative and accusational light you might say you're clingy, needy, sappy etc. (Not saying you are, just illustrating the point).  I think you should speak directly to hear about how you two have these differences (WITHOUT using baited words like ""cold"") and how sometimes you irrationally feel abandoned or like she doesn't care. Approach it from the perspective like, ""neither of us are doing anything wrong at all but we have this small incompatibility that gives me grief sometimes, and maybe if we communicate about it openly without it being a big deal, frequently, it will soothe my nerves and we can keep being great."" If you two make an effort to be more verbally reassuring to each other then you won't have to read so deeply into her actions and the subtle ways they differ from how you handle things.  That all said, you don't need a reason to be unhappy, if you're simply not that into this relationship. There are people out there who will express affection more similarly to how you understand it."
relationships,3e0xit,kb0351,2,Tue Jul 21 14:11:28 2015 UTC,"It sounds like things are coming down to a basic incompatibility between you two. You are dissatisfied and unhappy. If you can't even talk to her about these problems you're having, just what kind of relationship do you really have.  It sounds like both of you have some things to figure out before you can be in a healthy relationship, either between the two of you or with other people.  Your thoughts and feelings are reasonable, because you have them; people have thoughts and feelings, it is good to feel things. What you need to do now is talk to your GF about them. Over the phone, facetime, it doesn't matter. Fly out there and talk to her. If you want this girl and think things could be fixed so that you can make a long term relationship work, that is healthy, then you need to make an effort. Part of being in a health, ""adult"" relationship is communication, so you need to step up and execute that facet.  If you can't give communication a chance, then you might as well just call her and break up with her, because you'll continue being unhappy and unsatisfied.   If you don't think this is a relationship that is/can/worth going long distance, then break up with her, because you'll continue to be unhappy and unsatisfied.  Discuss your findings on the incompatibility between the two of you, and ask her if these are aspects that she is interested in working on. Talk things out."

I guess for my part, there is little this community can really say that will help you, because we can't read her mind, or really know either of you, regardless of how much detail you go into. When it comes down to it, a relationship between two people has to be built and worked on between those two people.   So for my part of the community's thoughts is that you need to work with her to communicate your feelings. Sharing yourself with someone else is a difficult thing, so it's only natural that the two of you experience this difficulty. Talk it over with her and see if you can work it out together.

I've been long distance for over 50% of all my relationships' timespan. I am also dating someone whom you might call 'emotionally stunted.' However, with me, he is gentle, sweet, loving, and expresses to me feelings that literally no other person has ever awakened in him. I'm just saying these things are not things that should stop you from having a good relationship.  Are you really trying to say here that this girl is one of The Ones? Are you really thinking she'll change and suddenly fulfill your NEEDS? Because that's what they are, emotional NEEDS.   You're 21, take a look at the situation, evaluate where it might go, make a decision. That, and communication (which is obviously lacking here), is what makes an ""adult"" relationship. Not your age. If you cannot communicate like an adult, even in a difficult situation, then you are not in an ""adult"" relationship. If you really think this is relationship-breaking, then it is important enough to discuss NOW. I can understand not wanting to bring this up 5 minutes before an important interview or presentation, but I doubt her situation is that urgent at the moment. If her answer is ""I can't do anything about it"", then you have your answer, right? Shouldn't she be with someone who either she cares enough about to change her behavior, or is ok with her behavior as it is?  As a side note, what the other person said was true. She's ""using you"". She doesn't really know it herself totally yet, but she is using you to fulfill a need she has. She enjoys the feeling of having an SO, even if she does not truly love them."

I'm in a relationship right now (long distance because I'm in the Marines and she is from my hometown) with a girl(f24) very similar to yours. She has had a rough life and has moments. The thing is,  i love her. And love is not a give what you get relationship. When she shuts down,  i have to be patient and show her I'm there for her.  Something simple like flowers,  or in my case i send a Playlist on a cd because music reaches out to her really well. So you have to ask yourself if you love her. If you do,  prove it every day,  even if she doesn't exactly show her appreciation,  but believe me,  she does. We've had our share of problems and it's not easy, but things worth fighting for aren't easy. Loving someone is an action,  not a feeling.   And for having serious intimate talks,  what i do is ask her to go to her room.  I'll close and lock the door and initiate. It's still hard to get her to open up, but be firm and patient but not pushy. And she will eventually open. And when she seems to not want you around, (this may be wrong but it works for me) I'll trap her (not literally, i just realized typing this it sounds creepy lol) I'll trap her in the corner with my arms and just look into her eyes and give her a kiss.

People not believing me, or thinking it was all in my head. Even my best friend didn't believe me until I got my diagnosis. My own doctor had a talk with me about eating disorders, and this was right after I had told her I was losing weight due to all of these crazy symptoms (luckily I saw another doctor who knew what it was right away). I understand the fear you have telling people about the disease. Like you said, it's especially hard with the fad diet now.   The next time they bring up your supposed anorexia around your friend, give her the all clear to tell them you have celiac. Or, try bring it up yourself before the intervention. The fact that they noticed you not eating and are concerned enough to stage an intervention (as misguided as that is) makes me hope that they care about you. Give them a simplified explanation of the disease if you can. This is what I say when people ask me why I'm not eating:  ""Oh yeah, I have celiac disease. It's an autoimmune disorder that damages my whole body if I eat anything with wheat."" I usually avoid the word ""gluten"" when I'm first explaining celiac and tell people I can't eat wheat, barley, etc.   If they press for more details, don't be afraid to share. Most people have heard about the disease by now, and even the most difficult nonbelievers shut up when I tell them my symptoms and explain the long term effects. I've also explained my diagnosis, with the endoscopies, blood tests, etc. I think people are more receptive when you explain all of the testing and doctors visits you go through to get diagnosed.  If you're not able to talk with them before the intervention, it's okay. Just take a deep breath, and tell them the truth. Your concerns about telling them are valid and I understand why you haven't told them before.  I'm sorry I can't give you much more advice at the moment. PM me if you ever need to talk or rant about it."

My favorite thing is simply explain what celiac is and that your dad isn't accommodating you. Then tell them that cheating is like having food poisoning... For three days.   I'm not sure what your reactions are like but most people have had food poisoning and understand how awful it is. The comparison is the one thing that clicks for most people.

Next RP session ask if you can talk to everyone before you start, and say something like this:  ""I want you all to know that I really value your friendship, so I want to share something important with you. Roughly 2 years ago I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that causes my body to react negatively to glutton. Unfortunately my father is unable to properly accommodate me, so you may have noticed that I suffering some symptoms from my illness, which include weight loss. Please respect that this is something I prefer to not draw attention too in public setting or around people I am not close with. If you want more information about Celiac, there are bunch of useful websites and I can answer any questions you may have.""  There are two key parts to this:   Speak in a calm, serious voice. Your not defending your actions, only imparting information. Talk like you would for a school presentation.  Get to the first. If you get there and they are already there, go first. Say something along the lines that your happy their all there because you having been wanted to tell them something. They will likely let you go first since they think your going to confess.    Also remember that these people care enough about to stage an intervention when they think your anorexic. They will likely care enough to accept this."

Talk them you are under the care of a doctor, you appreciate their concern and thank them for caring.  In another note, is it possible that you do have some anxiety around foods because of your dad that they are picking up on? It's possible you have disordered eating on top of celiac disease.

I have found that it makes a huge difference if people know that I have been tested and am not avoiding wheat on a whim or health food kick. I rarely go into my actual symptoms unless asked specifically because diarrhea is not good casual conversation.

Most people know about it. Just be comfortable with your explanation and don't make it a big deal. If your friend can't explain things for you (why can't your friend explain things for you?) then let them intervene and then laugh and tell them what's up. It seems like you've really built this up in your head due to how your friends and father have reacted but I promise the less dramatic you are, the less dramatic others reactions will be."
relationships,3dz3bf,sugarface8717,21,Tue Jul 21 14:10:38 2015 UTC,"This is actually something I have some second hand experience with.  One of my best friends (Caitie) (and someone who has celiacs) didn't figure it out until 2 years after college but started being picky and losing weight extremely rapidly senior year of college. She was miserable. She had no idea what was going on and she got so so so thin. We ended up living together after college and I have never seen someone so miserable. Binging on foods because she was starving and yet could never feel full. A host of issues including losing her period and bowel/bladder issues. She ate constantly and kept losing weight.  Senior year people were talking about having an eating disorder intervention. Myself and another one of my best friends (Megan) were skeptical about Caitie's supposed eating disorder. Megan is anorexic and has been battling her food disorder for over 10 years now and we saw none of the tell tale signs, so we went to Caitie to inform her of this planned ""intervention"" and give her a chance to figure things out. We weren't aware but Caitie had been going to doctors and therapy to try to figure out what was wrong and no one had helped her. But she knew something was wrong. So her therapist suggested she plan a ""reverse intervention"" if you will.  She send us all text asking us to meet her at her home at a specific time. (she picked her home because it was a place she felt safe and comfortable) She explained to everyone that she was sick, but not mentally and that she was going to the doctor regularly and seeing a therapist and she would really appreciate our support in helping her get well by not making this any harder. She did butt heads with some friends who just wouldn't believe it and that was sad. She set up time to talk to people who had further concerns one on one and spent time explaining her issues. People with active eating disorders DO NOT do this. By nature eating disorders are secretive and compulsive. Often the person knows what they are doing is damaging and does it anyway. They don't calming explain their behavior to their friends. In a way you are better off since you know you have celiac's and have a concrete explanation.   It took Caitie years to figure things out and her intestinal track is just now starting to heal. I think it would be beneficial to have everyone sit down and explain your condition. That celiacs is incredible hard to heal from since it slowly destroys your digestive system over time and needs a period of regrowth. It might help to explain this to them. That any sort of ""danger"" food doesn't just cause you pain like it might for lactose intolerant people, it actually damages your ability to digest food at all, provoking further illness and weight loss. Explain to them that this is more than a fad, that eating things contaminated with gluten during your healing period causes serious long term consequences, which is why you are so vigilant when you are allowed control over your food.  It really sucks that they don't get it, but also it means your friends really do care for you and they are concerned. Celiacs and other digestive issues are so nebulous that it often takes years to figure out, while disordered eating are common in high school and college. It does make some sense that disordered eating would be their first assumption. Selective eating and dieting (e.g. veganism, gluten free, paleo, atkins, etc.) are noted to be telltale signs of anorexia.   Stay strong. It broke my heart to watch Caitie go through all her pain, and even 2 years after a diagnosis she is just able to drink a glass of wine and not immediately feel sick. But people get it. She is always calm and firm when expressing her dietary needs. She is nice, but doesn't apologize for her condition. She asks a lot of questions at restaurants and knows her limits. I'm extremely proud of her and it's the happiest I have seen her in years.  I'm sorry for the novel, my heart goes out to you.  tldr; Similar thing happened to my roomate and best friend.

A (very basic) way to differentiate between allergies and autoimmune conditions is to think of it as allergies are the body attacking the thing to get it out-sneezing and runny noses with pollen, for example. An autoimmune reaction causes the body to attack itself- the villi with gluten in Celiac disease for example.   My sister has had Celiac since before gluten free was a thing, so I've been explaining it/hearing incorrect explanations/rectifying misunderstandings about it for about 13 years now.

I do like the immediate vs eventual explanation, too, though by no means is my explanation incorrect. An allergy is the immune system's over-reaction to a foreign substance. In your example, a throat closing when peanuts are eaten to prevent more peanuts from entering the body. An autoimmune reaction is the body's destruction of itself, whether in reaction to something (gluten in Celiac disease), or for unknown reasons (destruction of the insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas causing type one/juvenile/autoimmune reaction diabetes)."

I would guess that they'll be hugely relieved you don't have an eating disorder, and horrified at your treatment by your ex-friends and your father (as any right minded people should be).  Good luck!"

Say 'yes i am starving, my dad doesn't believe my diagnosis,  my digestive system had shut down as he is sabotaging any form of a healthy diet,  i have a few weeks and I'm free of his abuse'.  Any more questions about your diagnosis : 'yep all of the tests,  i have been sick for years,  when this came up i made sure the diagnosis was verified 100% because i had enough of a run around. I don't want to discuss this further,  this is not the first time the whole eating disorder enquiry has come up, people get bitchy about my answers one way or the other,  and really I'd like it to be dropped.

I've done a bit more research and it seems like one of the big symptoms of anorexia is denying the symptoms, so I think stating upfront that I know I've lost weight will defuse the idea that I'm anorexic somewhat. And I think maybe not naming the disease right away could avoid all the weird connotations of having Celiac. I also liked somebody else's idea of saying that I can't have ""wheat and similar grains"" instead of ""gluten""."

As soon as you get there tell them you are hungry and ask if they have anything to eat. Find a food you can eat and sit through the whole thing staring them down and munching away. Or bring something with you and eat slowly the whole time.   And when they really get to the good parts, and are getting uncomfortable. Interrupt them and say ' oh, that's nice you care so much but Ijust have food allergies and my dad wwon't buy enough of what I'm not allergic to.

relationships,3dz3bf,Astronaut_Panda,5,Tue Jul 21 16:46:15 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have to do this, but once I had to send my boss and colleagues a long email containing links to websites and a description of what Celiacs is and how it affects me. Some of them are still a little skeptical. The gluten-free fad diet and junk science have really put it into some people's minds that gluten-free eating is universally stupid.   Combine this with people's inability to recognize things they can't see, and the combination of seemingly unrelated symptoms of Celiacs, people feel really confused and can't seem to get how serious a disease it is.   It has helped me to describe it as an autoimmune disorder. For some reason that helps people put the pieces together.  I've also started saying that I'm severely allergic to gluten, and then I explain what gluten is and sort of overwhelm people with information.   Basically, you have to stand firm and be your own advocate. If your friends pull monkey business and stage an intervention, be ready. This is a GREAT opportunity to both tell them how hurtful doing such things without having all the facts first can be, and to educate them. Again, it's not your job, but the more people who understand Celiacs, the better. These people are going to host dinner parties and wait tables and have other friends with gluten-sensitivities or food allergies some day.   Print out or find some brochures and fact sheets about Celiacs symptoms, and a picture of the gluten protein, and be prepared to share a story or two of how it has impacted your life. Don't worry about defending yourself, they are just clueless kids who think they are being caring. I can't count how many times I did stuff like that in high school and college thinking I was helping people by judging them and interfering with their life.   I learned my lesson when more mature people listened to what I had to say, then kindly gave me the facts and shared their take and compassionately revealed how ignorant and rude I had been.   Or just ditch your friends. But honestly, unless you learn to communicate with people when they are being ignorant, critical, insensitive, or stubborn, you'll always be leaving relationships behind. We are all raging assholes sometimes, and we are all far more clueless and rude and insensitive than we like to think we are. It's better to be an advocate and cultivate empathy and forgiveness, for your own sake, then to just run away from everyone who acts a fool."

Personally, what I would do (and do frequently as a fellow Celiac) is just bring your own food and explain non chalantly that you have this stupid allergy. It sounds like they are concerned that you are not eating so you can kill two birds with one stone.    You're loading so much emotional weight on the 'reveal' that the only way you can think about it is as some huge deal, with catastrophic consequences.  Try approaching it as 'no big deal' and people will take their cue from you.  If you treat it as some dreadful secret people will tend to react strongly (for good or ill).   Also, life gets easier the further away from high school (and your abusive father). Once you can safely cook for yourself your life will become so much better. Three weeks! Good luck!"

Many of my celiac friends have gone into medicine (mostly RNs) because then you have coworkers that realize celiac is definitely a thing.  Something to think about when picking a career, plus nursing and medicine pay pretty well.  If you go to college, make sure you let them know before you get there.  Register with disability services (in case you get glutened and have to miss class) and contact dining services.  They have to provide you with safe food or let you out of purchasing the meal plan.

Your friends may be mistaken about the source of it all, but their worries about your weight loss and physical health are still valid. Tell them that you have celiac disease, and that you're going through a rough time and that your father isn't being supportive of your disease. Tell them that you've told people about the disease before, but that those people didn't believe you, and that it was very stressful for you.  Your friends obviously care about you - why else stage an intervention. You have a best friend that's part of the same friend circle that can serve as support, and also verify the disease. You have nothing to worry about - just be open with these friends.  Edit: As for your father, you should seriously consider talking to your doctor and expressing these issues and asking them to talk to your father for/with you.

relationships,3dz3bf,princesspuppet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not Celiac, however I do have specific dietary requirements.  I've suffered from migraines since I was 12 and have gone through rough patches where I've gotten them nearly every day and haven't been able to function. I found out that meat can be a trigger due to things like hormones and decided four and a half years ago to go vegetarian. I saw a HUGE change in my migraines, but that didn't seem to matter to a lot of people I knew.   I totally understand why you have not already told these people that you can't eat gluten, because I do the same thing with meat. I don't tell people that I'm vegetarian until I have to because I know I'll face the onslaught of bacon jokes, preachiness about what we're supposed to eat, advice about migraines they read from a cousin's sister in law's best friend's facebook page that says I don't have to do this, blah, blah, blah. It gets really old really fast.   This is a situation, however, where you're going to have to tell them either before the intervention or during since you'll more or less be cornered.  I would approach these people honestly and sincerely and tell them that you know about the plan to have an intervention and explain why you really turn down certain snacks. They may get defensive and they may feel embarrassed, but if they care enough about you to organize an intervention, they care enough about you to listen. You may honestly be able to laugh it off and go back to your normal routine/friendships after you explain that you just can't eat certain foods."

Be so thankful that these people love you enough to confront you about taking care of yourself. They want the best for you, and that is a wonderful thing.  Ok, so you've been prewarned, so now you can sit them down and explain yourself to them. Take information about celiac disease to the intervention (carry it in your bag so you're ready if they ambush you). Take some leaflets, a printed webpage or anything they can read for themselves. Then when they start the intervention, calmly tell them that it's not what they think, and explain it exactly the way you explained here. Show them your information and invite them to ask questions. Don't be ashamed of it. It's a part of your life and so are they, so help them understand. I strongly believe they will hear you out, they clearly care about you. Let us know how it goes."

relationships,3dz3bf,nwpeters,0,Tue Jul 21 03:54:06 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal. These people care about you. They noticed that your health is in decline and and they're willing to do something that's TOTALLY socially awkward in order to help you. So let's proceed assuming that they're on your side and want to do what's best for you.  You could ignore the situation like you're doing now, but the intervention will be really awkward when they stage it next weekend. Think about it - they'll be totally freaked out when you deny having a problem. They'll be worried about you.  Or you could just tell them about it now. I mean... you have a legitimate medical condition.  Look, you roleplay with these people on the weekends, right? They're nerds. They'll be the kind of people who, when you tell them you have celiac disease, they go and look it up on Google. And when they find out what it entails, they take that stuff  seriously.  So just tell them that you have celiac disease and that you don't eat well at your dad's house. Explain that he's very set in his ways and you just want to endure this one last summer with him. You could show them your prescription med bottles as proof.    By the way, the stuff I just said is the best advice I can give regarding this one situation, but it's all just a band-aid being applied to the symptom of a deeper problem.  You need to learn to trust people. Your upbringing probably made that quite difficult, but it's very important to be able to trust others if you want to live a healthy and happy life.  I know this might not be possible right now, but I bet it would be helpful if you eventually found a therapist and tried to process some of the really, really tough stuff you've gone through. (Believe me, I've spent a lot of time in therapist's offices; they get results.)  Best of luck to you!"
relationships,3e2h9b,Muiriko,2,Tue Jul 21 13:21:02 2015 UTC,"You're feeling pretty down and negative about life but this is in fact a huge opportunity for growth.  I'm an overly sensitive person and have in the past been pretty unstable and just plain old stopped giving a fuck after break ups.  Here are the strategies i've learned and used to cope:  *Set goals; and not just big goals, when you're feeling overwhelmed by life like this it's about starting very very basic and chipping away. I make myself ""2 week plans"" - I write down what I want to accomplish over the next two weeks, things as simple as ""lift weights 8 times, go for 5 runs, finish my book"" mixed with tasks that move me forward in life like ""reach out to 3 professionals in my field for a coffee meeting"". I keep score of this, it's a competition with myself (i don't get it all done ever) . It feels damn good ticking something off the last. The whole point of the two week plan is to regiment your life as much as possible, that way you are more present day to day and you find yourself doing alot less moping and you will start to gain confidence.  *Practice meditating, depending on where you live, there is probably free meditation courses being offered. Give it a quick google and see. Lots of people scoff at meditation but it is a very effective tool if you keep at it- helps keep you present and honestly makes you feel pretty happy.  *Even if it sounds like the very last thing you want to do right now, Join a club, sports team, charity.. anything of that sort. The best way to get over the social anxiety is to interact with other people, there's no doubt you'll make a friend or two from this, the help of others is integral.  Basically you've got to find it within you to swim upstream, this is an opportunity to push yourself outside your comfort zone which is how you're going to make headway on your issues.  good luck man   Edit: sry for the long post"

You should lay down the law with him before they get here and say exactly what you will and won't accept, then meet the friends, give him a chance to try and keep things appropriate and not let them pull their BS with you. If he doesn't, you have a choice to make.

I apparently have some news for you: any girl you date and then stop dating, either by your or her decision, will have friends who won't want to be your best friend afterwards. There are also people in the world who will dislike you for something you can't change, or for something you have no idea about. There is absolutely zero reason for you to concern yourself with those things. You can only live your life and you're not doing so at the moment, and you know it.

They stay friends with the ex, try and be a positive support, act super chill when the ex starts going on dates with other people etc. But the reality is they're clinging to this hope that he just needs space or time or to do his own thing for a while before he recognizes that she's all he needs and wants.

The concept of ""Jannah"" as an absolute truth is unlikely to resonate with this audience.  This is the type of advice I would give to someone who is worried about opening themselves up to another relationship at some point after their previous relationship has ended:  Losing someone is hard. You build a life with someone, and you expect that the relationship will sustain you for the foreseeable future. When this kind of thing happens, it crumbles up your social infrastructure.   The first thing is it is okay to feel the emotions that you do. You may be feeling angry, or sad, or be craving intimacy. These are all valid feelings to have.   It's been 4 months, and there may be times when you feel like life is getting back to normal, and then you encounter something that reminds you of your husband, and you get sucked back into those feelings. That is normal too.   Eventually there will come a time when those days get further apart. There will be more days when you are living in the present and not remembering what happened.   There will be  a time when the need for intimacy will be of greater focus than your grief. That human contact is something we all need.   There will come a time when someone will catch your eye, and you will feel so guilty about thinking that way of someone after what happened to you and your spouse.   What do your husband would want you to do at that point?  Would he want you to focus on the technicalities of what happens after our lives are over, or would he want you to find some happiness for yourself and some support for his child?  If he is as remarkable a person as you say, I think he would choose to have you be content with your life than trying to preserve a condition to reunite with him.   Best of luck to you."

Counseling can help you through the grief process, so you don't get stuck in any of the stages.  It is very easy to do that.  Don't even think about another relationship for a year or two.  You need to heal first.  IF you aren't healed, it isn't fair to either you or the person you end up with.  So your first step - healing.   The same basic steps still apply in this case -   Hit the gym - well, maybe not the gym, but exercise in some way - get those endorphins flowing!  You have a child, there are great exercises you can do with small children.   Learn something new - learn a trade, get a masters degree, etc.  Maybe  become a teacher so your schedule will work with your son's schedule when he is in school.  Volunteer - help make the world a better place.  And heal yourself.  Don't push yourself to remarry if you don't want to.  Your child has other family members - your parents, your in-laws, any siblings, etc.  Lots of good role models.   And there is no guarantee that any man you marry would be a good parent to your child.  IN fact, statistics show that most violence against children is done by step-parents."

Have you spoken to a grief counselor?  Or someone in your religion that is equivalent?  That might be a good place to start.  I am not familiar with Islamic traditions or the religion itself, so bear with me, but, from my view, you seem too young to give up on never loving again.  Right now, the grief is still quite raw, since it's only been a few months and it may take a long time until you are ready to open your heart again.

relationships,3dzbya,a_pure_heart,11,Mon Jul 20 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"I'm so terribly sorry for your loss.  I'm very sad for your and your baby.  I'm not Muslim, but I did date one for several years.  We dated each other with the intention of marriage.  We were quite the kindred souls together, for a while, and our relationship was a healthy and happy one.  Oddly, the fact that I was as devoutly Catholic as he was devoutly Muslim was one of the ways in which we were very similar, rather than different.   So, I feel that I may have slightly more capacity than most to understand your deeply held religious convictions.  They are just as much a part of your identity as everything else.  Catholics have the authority of the Pope as the final authority on doctrine, but one of the oft-cited ""problems"" of Islam as a religion is that there is no equivalent authority figure.    This leaves the particulars of Islamic doctrine more open to interpretation.  Having spent more than the half of my adult life trying to conform to infallible rules of Catholicism, I will tell you that having some flexibility regarding the rules of your religion is a very good thing.  In fact, I would even go as far to say that this flexibility is not a ""problem"", but, indeed, a solution for the individual faithful, because it allows the faith of a person to stay strong over time, across different populations, and with the changes and stages that naturally occur over a person's lifetime.   First, I do agree with others that say it is too soon for you to even be thinking of remarriage.  You need time to grieve and heal from the loss of your dear husband.    (As a very general rule of etiquette, a widow/er would typically wait a minimum of 6 months after the death of a spouse before dating another suitor.   Just FYI. YMMV.)  There are resources that can help you with your loss, and I would urge you to seek them out, both for yourself and for the benefit of your child.    A grief counselor with a religious background would be very helpful to you, because they will best understand the importance of your faith.   The other thing you should do is join a widow/widower support group.  They will truly understand your pain more than anyone else, and you will gain some perspective on how grief changes over time and how it changes different people in various ways.  Losing a spouse fundamentally changes you, just as much as becoming a parent does.  A person of faith also changes over time, and this is natural across religions.  Besides seeking out the opinions of your most respected religious scholars, you should talk to others you are close to in your family about _what they themselves actually believe _ in regards to certain specific teachings of your faith.  I've noticed that there seems to be this odd phenomenom among families who practice their religion in that they seem to not share with each other their own personal thoughts and feelings regarding specific dogma and doctrine.  They might talk about the rules, and encourage behavior that strictly adheres to the rules, but they never tell you what they themselves really believe about these things.  It may take some effort to successfully research something as intimate as individual faith, but I think that these honest opinions are the ones that you need to ferret out, because I suspect that these would be the ones most helpful to you in your situation.  Seek and pray for understanding and acceptance, and you will find eventually find peace, whether or not there is another marriage in your future.  (Also, PM me if you'd like to talk some more.)"

relationships,3dzbya,enigma5908,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:27:45 2015 UTC,who said it? Is it a reputable narration?
relationships,3dzbya,LyssaBrisby,10,Tue Jul 21 01:37:31 2015 UTC,"Everyone else's advice about taking time to grieve, and maybe visiting /r/islam, is so wise. I did want to add, however: to me, it seems very likely that when your husband said he would not remarry and hoped you wouldn't either, he didn't for a moment imagine he would be gone so soon. How could either of you have suspected such a tragedy would strike? It's unfathomable and horrible and I'm sorry you have suffered such a loss.  In his mind I imagine he could see being old with you, and maybe passing one day in his eighties! Of course you wouldn't remarry then. But this isn't the situation, sadly, and possibly his statements weren't meant to apply in the sad circumstance you find yourself.  All love and good wishes to you as you progress through this difficult time. You will make good choices for yourself and your son and your beloved husband. ""Yar.hamu-ka-Llâh"" means may god have mercy on you? I hope it is so."
relationships,3dzbya,youmakemeuncomfy,4,Tue Jul 21 01:47:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  Your husband sounds like a delightful and loving man. There is no way he could have imagined dying so soon and so young.  There is no way he wanted to leave you before you grew old together.  And there's no way he'd have wanted you to be beholden to anything that made your life difficult.  Be kind to yourself, love your son and take the future as it comes.  I wish you peace."

I am sure that after some time has passed you will see things clearer.  As far as your son is concerned, perhaps you should seek closer contact with male family members or friends? Do you have any married male friends/husbands of your female friends who would like to take your son out for some fatherly-bonding? If you have brothers that would be even nicer for your son to bond with his uncle."

Why not be willing to accept an alternative interpretation? Or is the mere risk of finding out you were wrong too much to bear?  If that's the case then the concept of relying on the hadith for opinion about how one should live ones's life frightens me."

You don't have to be alone the rest of your life. Research has shown that people who have been in happy marriages are likely to remarry, because they had the gift of a wonderful partner. It doesn't mean it has to happen this year or next year.  You'll likely meet some guy in a while, when you're ready and have properly taken distance of your husbands death. And if you're lucky, he will be just as important to you as your first husband has been. Not in the same way, because you have changed as a person, but similar. And in that case, your first husbands request is unfair.   You are young and a promise to him should not include being robbed of a new family and more chances of love. And it cannot be that your husband wished you to be unhappy in your earthly life, only to make up for it in Jannah. Perhaps you should talk to more religious experts, you cannot be the only widow they meet. You can also consider not to marry according to Islamic ways and only choose for a legal marriage.   It's okay to miss your husband. It's okay to want to keep the promise to him. But don't let this stand in your way if you want kids some day. You can live much of the life you planned with him, and in a way that will honor his legacy."

I think, believe it or not, that r/relationships is actually pretty good at not being judgmental by Reddit standards. But the site is, overall, near-hostile or very hostile to religious beliefs. Have you searched to see if there are support groups or forums for your type of situation? I have to imagine it can't be uncommon.  Also I'd like to echo what others have said: that this wound is still raw. Don't feel too much pressure to plan the rest of your life right now. It'll be a long process, and your feelings are going to change once the sting starts to go away a bit.  Good luck with everything."
relationships,3dzbya,some1v2,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"Like a lot of what people have stated, I would focus on grieving; allowing yourself to grieve and slowly pick up the pieces from there.  You don't have to have any of the answers right now, they will all come.  After enough time has passed, I think the important question is, without minimizing your love for your husband, what is good for your son?  It's tricky, because I do not presume to know much about the Muslim afterlife...but what you have right now, what you have in your control, is giving your son the fullest life you can provide. And you said you wanted him to have a father. And there will be times where you wish to have that intimacy again, you're human, you can never fault that.  Honor your husband by raising your son to be just like him.  If that requires someone to help you, then that's what your son needs.  If you have a close-knit family who can do that, that's an option too.  I had a good friend get married at a young age, and her husband died tragically, in a similar way.  She remained single and heartbroken for many years, and eventually picked up the pieces in her life.  She clung to family and friends and she never forgot her husband.  But in time, she found another person who healed her and completed her again, and they have since gotten married, and they have a son, and her life is restored.  I have no doubt that she still loves her deceased husband, but she has a new family, and love comes in so many different forms.  Your heart will mend in time, and you will find love again. It's not for any of us to say which love of ours lives on in eternity. And I would say this to anyone of faith, but you owe it to yourself to focus on what you can accomplish here and now in life, and let the afterlife sort itself out. If our God deems us worthy of the joy and love that we have done our very best to spread, I truly believe there is no punishment in the afterlife of being separated from the ones we hold the most dear. That is our reward for living the best life."
relationships,3dzbya,wishforagiraffe,3,Mon Jul 20 21:36:32 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry for your loss. I think the most important thing is to give it time. Of course both options are equally unthinkable right now... You are still in a very raw stage of grief. You do not need to--and really should not--make any permanent decisions right now because you are not thinking clearly.  I hope this isn't presumptuous of me, but I am Christian and I think we worship the same god, even if we disagree on some details. ;) My denomination has a similar belief about remarriage.  But I also think we worship a merciful and loving God. Even if it's true that you will be with your second husband in Jannah, don't you think Allah has a plan for these situations so no one is hurt for eternity? Men dying young and leaving young widows and young children in need of support is sadly common throughout history; I have trouble imagining a loving God leaving all those people hurt and lonely forever.  I'm sure your husband would want you to be happy, and give the best life you can to your son, whether it means staying single or remarrying. I think taking to an imam trained in grief counseling is also a good idea. I'm not saying you should shop around to find one who will tell you what you want to hear, but someone with that kind of training and experience may be able to give you more support and help you consider things you haven't thought of. Grief counseling is a special skill, and not all imams are going to be equally capable.  But mostly, be kind to yourself and give yourself time to heal.

relationships,3dzbya,rubberduckclucks,2,Mon Jul 20 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"Sweet girl, im so sorry you're going through this, death is too painful and so unfair. My fiance was killed by a drunk driver and although I am not Muslim, I had some of the same thoughts as you. I remember not wanting to be with someone else, I didn't want to love someone else because he was the one I loved. I wanted to wait to for us to meet again, someday. I wondered how it would get all sorted out if I met someone else, if I loved someone else. For a long time, I knew that if there was an afterlife, I wanted to be with him. Than slowly, the hurt began to heal and I became able to see myself with someone else.   This wound is so fresh for you, your husbands memories so strong, give it time and you will realize a lifetime is too long to wait to meet again. Your husband will always hold a place in your heart, but in a few years you'll know it's ok if you don't meet again. In my heart, I believe, if there is an afterlife, my fiance has also met someone new and is no longer waiting for me. This isn't a decision you need to make today, or next year, spend sometime healing and loving your memories of your husband. When the time comes, I promise, you will move on. You will meet someone new who you'll want to spend the afterlife with, you'll never forget your husband but you'll see a whole lifetime is a very long time and will be filled with new loves, new memories. I know, right now, you want to spend your eternity with your first husband, but maybe the reason the next life is spent with your last husband is because by the time you get there, your last husband is who you will want by your side. I think you will feel the same way when you meet someone new. Your husband's heart will also heal while he's in Jannah, same as yours, and he will forgive you for finding a new husband to share your love with."

And let other people take care of you, too. I'm sure that, no matter how much it may feel like it, you are not alone. You have a family and friends and your child... you even have a bunch of weirdos on the internet who care.

I too did a lot of sh*t while I was a kid and I'm perfectly conscient that I have changed a lot, I've grown up a lot and I learned a lot by all the mistakes I've done.  I believe that she might be like me, I believe that she must have learned a lot with all she's done...   But once again, I totally get you."

relationships,3e2ik4,throwschoolaway123,3,Tue Jul 21 13:32:39 2015 UTC,"23, not in a relationship, but about to move alone very far away from home.    Step 1: Learn how to make friends.  You don't need to stay in the house all the time.  Relying on your BF for social interaction is isolating you too much. Pick up a hobby or take a for-funsies class or organize a study group. Select from there people you would want to spend extra time outside of classes with.  A few friendships can develop from there.  Step 2: If feasable, get a job.  It will net you money that you can use to travel home and visit family.  Step 3: assuming you work on steps 1 and 2, ????.  Time passes here.  Maybe you feel better and less like you're losing your mind.  Step 4: if above steps genuinely failed, go home.  Good luck.  I hope it gets better for you."
relationships,3e2ik4,jjgonya,4,Tue Jul 21 17:12:32 2015 UTC,"I think I can relate to this a lot.   I'm 22F too. Last August I dropped my life and moved continents to be with my SO. By December, I was miserable. I had no friends, no support system : just my SO.   I too like you felt obligated to stay -  I didn't have school or anything like that keeping me there, though, my obligation felt more like to my partner. I also had silly reasons in my head ""it will get better"" and ""I just need to give it more time"" etc. I was miserable, super depressed, and generally not happy with my life.   In May, I decided I had enough and packed my bags and went home. I've been back for almost 2 months now. Since been back, I have realized without a doubt what an idiot I was. My mental health is at a better place now, and I'm happier. My only regret is that I didn't come back home earlier.   What I'm trying to say is, you matter the most. Your mental health is the most important thing. Put yourself first. Stop playing a martyr and continue to ""sacrifice"", if you are unhappy, youre unhappy and that's it. When I quit my job to come back home, my mom was a bit disappointed and said i was dumb, but you know what? She got the hell over it.   It's not anyone else's life. It's your life. Your family and SO might have opinions of their own, but at the end of the day, youre the one in the position. You know better than anyone else what's best for you.   Don't sacrifice yourself or your mental health for anyone or anything else. If you really are extremely miserable and it's been going on for some time and shows no promise of changing soon, then go back. You might feel like you ""gave up"" at first and some guilt and disappointment at yourself, but I promise that feeling soon gets overtaken by the fact you're happier, have your friends again, and no longer a miserable mess. Live for you, not for anyone else! If you need someone to talk to, feel free to PM me, I understand very well how you feel."
relationships,3e2ik4,dubbykinz,3,Tue Jul 21 13:53:45 2015 UTC,"This... every part of this is the answer.  I was in a similar situation to OP's, and I tried to ""stick it out"" for as long as I could. All that happened is I was miserable, started to fail classes, knowing I was doing bad led me to just give up and stop going all together, and I ended up dropping out and just getting a full time job and struggling to make ends meet.  After a few years of this, I finally bucked up, sucked it up, and went back home. I felt like a failure for a while, but finally after 10 years and paying $30 - 40,000 in tuition that gave me no transferable credits whatsoever,  I'm finally back on the path to success.  Basically, no matter what ""obligations"" you may impose on yourself, or your mother imposes on you, the best thing you can do is go back and reset before it sends you into a downward financial and mental spiral you have to spend too much time digging back out of."
relationships,3e2txl,dontidentifymeplease,18,Tue Jul 21 15:05:28 2015 UTC,Stop with the rock crap. You'll be perfectly OK without someone you likely can't trust anymore. If you stay with him it'll just eat at your self confidence and you'll be miserable. The guy has already made YOU feel bad when it was him doing the emotional cheating.  It'll take time but you'll be whole again. Why are you letting him call the shots?
relationships,3e2txl,diego_montoya_jr,8,Tue Jul 21 15:08:43 2015 UTC,"So, he was doing something shady, you snooped and confronted him and now he's trying to make this about what you did wrong? I mean, yeah you shouldn't have snooped but his reaction is some gaslighting bullshit."

Now is the time to set some good habits for future relationships.  When someone flirts with other girls and lies about it by denying or deleting evidence, this means that you can't trust them and they don't respect you.  If there isn't trust AND respect on both sides, you shouldn't date them.  It's unhealthy.  What you do is break up with him, and then call some friends over, eat ice cream and watch some funny movies.  You rebuild your life and focus on friendships, hobbies, school etc.  It will hurt and you'll miss him constantly for a while.  And slowly you'll miss him less, until in a few months you look back and realize how glad you are that you left him.  And you'll take that knowledge into future relationships and know that if someone treats you like this again, you can and will leave them because you know you'll be okay."
relationships,3e2txl,somanynights,5,Tue Jul 21 15:39:55 2015 UTC,"What should I do to keep me sane?   Find a new boyfriend.   You don't trust him, and you have a reason not to trust him. So, while snooping is bad, once the relationship comes to the point where you feel you need to snoop (and especially after you find something wile snooping), the only solution is to break up.   He's trying to make you feel bad about snooping, while he was the one lying and probably cheating. Dump him and move on."
relationships,3e2txl,ed_lv,6,Tue Jul 21 15:16:00 2015 UTC,You are young. He is a lying (emotional?) cheater. Dump him and go and find someone that will treat you right.  His turning his poor behavior back on you is very manipulative and controlling. Not good boyfriend material.
relationships,3e2txl,qsteak,4,Tue Jul 21 15:11:25 2015 UTC,Why is snooping automatically wrong when your shithead of a boyfriend has given you ample reason/suspicion to look? Tell him to take a nice big break with the girl he's texting and don't speak to him again.
relationships,3e2txl,Babu_the_Ocelot,3,Tue Jul 21 15:44:40 2015 UTC,"You don't trust him because there's nothing to trust. Yes, you were wrong for snooping, but you don't want to be with someone that makes you want to snoop!"

You might consider searching your feelings to get a sense of why you feel like this about him (or anyone else).  This type of infatuation is relatively normal for young people, but it's often not conducive to starting a healthy long-term relationship.  If it's primarily a physical attraction then there's nothing wrong with perusing a sexual relationship with him."

If she has a history of being self-centered, than you shouldn't have been surprised.  She wanted the attention and she got it.  You should have placated her and said ""oh, that's a nice ring"" and then continued on with your life.  I know it's hard that this is your mom and you want to celebrate your engagement, but that's just not the person she is.  If you talked to her before and she hasn't changed, I don't think she is going to now.  You can't control her actions, but you can control your actions and expectations."
