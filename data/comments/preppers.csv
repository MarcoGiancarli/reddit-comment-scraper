preppers,3e23cc,edheler,2,Tue Jul 21 11:39:11 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of Jesse Walker's book The United States of Paranoia - it's a super interesting read for anyone who wonders why the US is so obsessed over aliens and conspiracy theories compared to the rest of the world.   In Walker's view, there's a category of conspiracy called ""Enemy Below"" in which the elites of our society always (and rather naturally) fear that poor people are coming to topple their wealth and eat their families. In a similar way, the middle class use this same conspiracy type to believe that immigrants or the poor are going to ""steal jobs"" or ""vote wrong"" or whatever.  It's important to recognize that while elites justifiably have this fear and do act on it, that elites also have the other 4 conspiracies that they fear too, just like everyone does.   We can find evidence of this conspiracy (and the other 4 types of conspiracies) everywhere and from all perspectives of class. Therefore, it's really not necessary to become paranoid about these things or find that anecdotal evidence of these conspiracies existing justifies anything."
preppers,3e23cc,fidelitypdx,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"Normalcy bias is one cognitive bias to be aware of. There's also a bias towards conspiracy, looking for patterns to explain mundane coincidences, which tends to be at the root of most conspiracy theories. One can also be biased towards doom and destruction or biased towards the opposite, assuming or predicting a better world. All of these cognitive biases are destructive, and all of them must be watched. Not buying insurance because you don't think you'll need it can be just as detrimental as spending a large amount of time and money preparing for an apocalypse. The big difference with a doom or conspiracy bias is that there's no rude awakening for most people. The sunk-cost fallacy plays in heavily; you can see this in any of the rapture cults that repeatedly see The End predicted, the date pass, but continue believing in their particular prophet.   Be vigilant in watching for every cognitive bias."

preppers,3e45nl,silverdollars,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:48:11 2015 UTC,I've actually had this happen to me with my dad a couple times. Normally if you're in a town/city 911 is your best option. The times I had to call the FD got there very quickly and the 911 operator asked all the right questions and instructed me what to do until they arrived. Yes it was an extremely frightening experience. The last time he almost died and if I tried to take him to the ER myself he almost certainly would have.
preppers,3e45nl,DreamArcher,2,Tue Jul 21 20:51:22 2015 UTC,"Take a CPR and Basic First Aid Class. Have appropriate First Aid Kit on hand.  Check to see if your community has a ""Vial of Life"" or similar program so that your parent's medical history and current medications / allergies are on hand for First Responders if needed. If not, place a copy of current medical history and list of current medications in a brightly colored envelope on the refrigerator, clearly marked with name and the words Emergency Medical Info.  Call 911 if you suspect a medical emergency. Virtually all 911 centers (assuming you are in the US) have a Medical Dispatch program where they will triage the patient by asking a few key questions while the responders are on the way. If needed, they will provide you with instructions to help manage the patient and provide basic care until the responders arrive. In a true emergency, the intervention provided by Fire /EMS personnel can save a life. You would be much better to use the EMS / 911 system in 99.9 % of all cases. In the rare event that you are an hour away from the nearest Fire or EMS provider, only then would I think about heading toward civilization in a vehicle with an emergency patient. Even then, I would most likely call 911 and arrange to meet the ambulance at a specified location if it truly will be faster to get them to help that way.    edited for typo"

You aren't trained in medicine, and you aren't trained in high speed emergency driving. We can do both.

You may not know where the nearest cath unit is. If they are choking, I can remove foreign bodies from the airway with special tools, and use other tools to support their airway until they regain the ability to use it. If you speed them to a hospital, they will get an anoxic brain injury, and you'll have to wipe their ass and feed them every day.

preppers,3e2c4b,SkaUrMom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:20:56 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty common strategy in the backpacking community. There's a saying that when you come home, never repack the thing at the bottom of your bag. If you really live by this motto, you start to find creative uses for other things already in your kit.   The balancing act for preppers is the whole ""I doubt I'll ever need this, but just in case..."" that we get trapped into. For example, if I carried a gas mask every day, how long would it take before I needed it? Does that mean a gas mask is a bad prep? Well, yeah, it's probably a dumb thing to carry every day, but I do have one in my truck ""just in case."" I also bring a small pistol with me when I go backpacking, never needed it, but I don't want to toss it out.   So, if you go strictly by the mantra of only keeping things that you use on a regular basis, you become more resilient but less of a prepper."

Read as many sources as you can, especially sources you think you'll disagree with. Be realistic about what you're preparing for. Be systematic: sit down with a piece of paper and brain storm every bad thing that could happen to you. Then, prioritize those things by likelyhood and create a top 10 list. Using that top ten list, start building solutions and survival preps for those things. If #1 on your list is ""Zombies"" or ""SHTF"" you should probably rethink the realistic nature of prepping – somewhere on your top 10 should be “medical emergency” and “power outage”.    Next you’ll want to assemble these preps into some kits, I have some guides here: 10 C’s of Survival and Emergency Kit Considerations - Emergency Survival Food Considerations  Lastly, and most importantly, you’ll want to practice the skillsets that you think are important. If the main thing you’re prepping for is the break-down of law with marauding killers (“SHTF”) you should probably focus on martial arts and defensive skills.   The ultimate state of preparedness is near-complete self-sufficiency. So, if you can live off grid, produce your own food and happiness, you’ll be able to weather out just about any storm.

preppers,3e0y1j,isamlegend,5,Tue Jul 21 12:57:45 2015 UTC,"Home Owners Association (HOA) is a neighborhood specific group that often has full legal authority to impose all sorts of insane stuff. The premise of the HOA is reasonable: if your neighbor doesn't mow their lawn then the neighborhood looks worse and therefore property values decrease. Generally, a lot of nicer neighborhoods and apartments in the US have an ""HOA"", large downtown apartment buildings also have a similar associations.  In practice, HOAs are usually run by control freak retirees and unemployable house moms. Through this, they can become quiet the costly nightmare of an involuntary association. They can do things like fine $200 if you paint your front door, forbid children from playing outside after 7pm, create absurd noise restrictions during all hours of the day, mandate your front yard must be green grass only (no tress or vegetable gardens) even during droughts. Often they skew towards creating a paradise for old wealthy people: mandated conformity and pleasantry, nothing radical, unconventional, or artistic. Their end-state is a bunch of beige-colored houses that look the same with tidy front lawns."

If you buy in an HOA area, you give up rights because it's in the deed covenants.  There's supporting law (per state) to regulate how the HOA itself operates, but the key is it's in the covenant.  Don't buy property with such covenants.  They cannot spring up after the fact."

preppers,3e0y1j,fleshrott,3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:24 2015 UTC,"One thing to be very careful is with CC&R or covenants. Most new houses have them and often they are not filed in the same county or state. The best part about those is that often you don't get to see them until the closing and then you are stuck with an unpleasant surprise. You don't need to have a HOA to have a CC&R imposed on your property and they are almost impossible to get rid of. Some states like Wisconsin have sunset clauses in the law so they only last ten years and then they need to be renewed by the community that has them. I would of put CC&Rs in the title of the post, but most people do not know what those are. They are the real power behind the HOAs.

preppers,3dyxih,CaptainCoral,24,Mon Jul 20 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"First, replace your Lifestraw with one of these. That will filter more, last longer with the back flush, and most importantly... will allow you to filter water out into other drinking containers. One of the biggest drawbacks to the lifestraw is that it's fine for drinking, but how do you get water to cook or wash with out of it? Suck and spit? Keep the Lifestraw as a backup, but this should be the go to. Second, pick up some white rice. Like... 100 lbs of it or so. That should be pretty cheap, it will provide calories, can last 30 years if stored correctly, works well with a lot of different flavors and seasoning, and can stretch whatever else you have around the house. If you have to bug in or stay put, it's the easiest prep for food you can do cheaply. Just make sure to keep any propane tanks you have full and know how to cook it. For food on the go, especially prepping for issues with water, look into things like Mainstay 2400 Bars. Fortunately, Walmart also sells these (they're orange on one side) in their outdoor area now for just under $5 apiece. It's 2400 calories per bar that will last for up to 5 years and will survive through +300 degrees F and -40 degrees F. They're actually meant for life boats. The big upshot to these is that they do not require you to have clean water and a way to heat it. I wouldn't want to survive on them for a month, but for a few days until help arrives they should be fine. Just make sure to put each in a gallon sized freezer ziploc bag. The individual bars (400 calories each) inside are not individually wrapped, so you don't want them crumbling everywhere or getting soggy with tainted water. Lastly, if you don't have it already, a tool to shut off your gas line positioned right near the shut off.     That should take care of the most immediate needs for as little money as possible. I'd guesstimate for two people that would come in at under $100 and would put you ahead of the majority of the population, especially with the water filter.  For an expanded version:   Life jackets. If you're worried about flooding, absolutely. Boats are kind of expensive, so I'd target life preserver's first. Extra batteries, extra flashlights, head lamps, and at least one waterproof flashlight per person. Maybe one to attach to the dog's life preserver as well. Going without light would suck, so don't just rely one one or two dollar store flashlights. At some point, a battery operated camping lantern is a not too expensive investment that you don't have to worry about starting a fire with. Water resistant weather radio. Maybe one that can also charge up a cell phone. On a similar note, something like a weather resistant FRS radio. They won't work great at longer distances, but they're cheap and give you options you wouldn't otherwise have had. Weather appropriate gear. Both for cooling off and staying warm, though probably trending more toward staying warm. Mylar blankets are really cheap, and they have sleeping bag versions as well. Arctic Neck Ties help to cool you down in the heat through evaporative action, and they're less than $4 at Walmart. Carbon Monoxide/Smoke Detector's and Fire Extinguishers. You need to know if they air you're breathing is tainted, and if you can't get a fire under control yourself in an emergency situation then it's likely all going up. Lastly, reading is cheap and you're already doing it. Keep at that for a bit and you'll have a whole lot of solutions. Then you just need to figure out which problems need them."

preppers,3dyxih,spork_fiend,6,Mon Jul 20 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, those work. Walmart has some that are cheaper in the store.  First, your starter looks good. I too am on a budget. So I feel you pain. But, as a parent, I know I would not be doing my job if I didn't do at least the minimum of 90 days prep. Here is what we did.  1) We used sales, dollar, resell and discount stores as much as possible. You will be amazed at the finds in those places. Especially, dollar stores. And sometimes it helps get the imagination going.  2) When it comes to food storage, be sure to pick foods you will cook and eat and that your family will too. You can get 24 count ramen noodle cases for like 4$. But useless if your family or you won't eat them throughout the year to rotate your stores.   3) Learn to reuse materials. We use old cat food and litter (plastic) containers to store rice, beans, water ect. Each one of those litter containers properly cleaned will hold 5+ gallons of water. Same with soda bottles.  4) Don't let yourself get talked into expensive gear you won't need, have no practical use, or don't have the skill set to use. That is a waste of your resources. Which brings me to the next pointer....  5) YouTube is amazing! You will be ahead of the gàme if you can take some time for you and your family to learn some skills. Sewing, gardening, auto mechanics, woodworking, blacksmithing, etc.  In our house, we have BOB's for every person including our 6month old baby. Those are cheap and easy to make using dollar and resell stores like I stated before.   Sorry for the wall of text. Hope this helps."
preppers,3dyxih,Mr_Marshmallow,4,Mon Jul 20 18:34:21 2015 UTC,"You forgot the most important item! A knife. It can be used to cut things (obviously). But it can be used as a combat item too. If shit hits the fan people may get aggresive and try to attack you. You'll basically need a knife for every survival task there is. It's needed to cut food and cordage, to build shelters and a lot of other tasks. Which brings me to the next item: cordage. Cordage is very important too. I would recommend 550 paracord.  List: Knife - Hunter knives are great (~30 dollar) Cordage - 550 paradord Water bottle - preferably stainless steel Because you can cook it (~4 dollar) Foil blanket - (~3 dollar or so) Secondary method to make fire - this can be another lighter, a firesteel, lucifers etc (~1 dollar) Ductape - preferably heavy duty (1-2 dollar) Backpack - to carry the gear with you Compass (and the knowledge how to use it) - to navigate yourself (1 dollar) Map of your area -  to use in combination with your compass     A water filter is nice but they cost quite much. If you have the money I would buy it. Gloves are nice when it's cold. Not a priority,, but nice. Same goes for tarp/tent, sleeping bag or hammock."
preppers,3dyxih,altkarlsbad,4,Mon Jul 20 23:29:22 2015 UTC,"I'll take an alternative tack here because people have covered the lifestraw and then some.  I would advocate thinking a step beyond mere survival and consider putting your life back together after a shock (earthquake, house fire, break in, whatever).  You know what you would really appreciate at that point? A fireproof watertight safe with your passports, legal documents, family photos, copies of insurance papers, some cash, etc in it.  Keep an eye on ebay for these things, the freight is painful but you can get a new unit for under $50 adequate for storing all kinds of things. Mine has passports, birth certificates, insurance papers, shot records for the kids, a hard drive with a computer backup on it (safe is 'media' rated), some cash, an actual physical address book and some other stuff.  I have a little nylon stuffsack in there as well, if i'm home and we have to evacuate due to wildfire/hurricane/chemical release, I can just dump everything into the stuffsack in about 10 seconds and boogie on out.  Just a thought to add to the list, I completely agree with the people saying skills and fitness, and practicing your bushcraft as soon as practical. All that comes before what I added, but for a complete plan including repopulating your home, consider the safe."

People that have never spent time outdoors don't have a clue what they're doing and all the kit in the world doesn't help them you need a solid foundation and if you have that you shouldn't need half this crap"
preppers,3dyxih,landoindisguise,4,Mon Jul 20 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"This comment, probably the best suggestion in here, gets downvoted. SMH. Way too many preppers seem to be treating it like ""outdoor gear collection,"" but without the skills and knowledge all that gear is useless.   OP (and everyone else) should remember that the best and most reliable tool in any survival situation is you. I honestly think the most important things for preppers are:   Being physically fit (this is a no-brainer yet many people totally ignore it, or think that lifting soup cans to the shelf = fit enough) Developing relevant skills (which depends on where you are, but might well include things like bushcraft, basic auto or motorcycle repair, basic EMT training, generator repair, etc.) Developing relevant (and realistic) plans. Your bug out bag is useless if you don't know where you're going, how you're getting there, alternate routes, etc. Similarly, your guns are just a liability if you have them because you think you're going to single-handedly defend your home against a band of marauders and you don't have plans for running the fuck away because you're too caught up in the macho bullshit mindset.    /rant  edit: for OP, if I were you the first thing I'd do is figure out what your neighborhood/area is actually going to look like if it's flooded. What areas will be deepest? What roads might still be passable on foot/bike/car? Will a raft actually get you very far? Answering basic questions like this should give you an easier window into what items you really need/don't need and what skills you might also need to learn (or what skills your dog might need...I have a GSD as well but she hates water; getting her onto an inflatable raft in an emergency situation would be a nightmare if we hadn't trained her for it beforehand)."

The point is, OP came in here saying ""I have a very limited budget, and I already have a Lifestraw.""  In an ideal world, would he have bought a Sawyer instead? Sure. But the Lifestraw is fine. OP is preparing for a localized earthquake/flood, where relief is likely to get to him within a matter of days. He is not going to drink through 250 gallons of water in that kind of a time frame.   In the long run, I agree replacing it (or supplementing it) with a longer-lived filter would be better.

preppers,3dyxih,fidelitypdx,2,Tue Jul 21 03:08:38 2015 UTC,"Shout out to /r/CascadianPreppers  Unless you live immediately on the river, there's a very little chance you'll get flooded. The actual earthquake in the valley won't be extremely strong, probably felt as a magnitude 6.0 or so. The major concern is basically brick buildings, especially in downtown Portland, and the risk of land liquefaction. The risk of your house collapsing is fairly slim, especially if it was made after the 1970's. Meanwhile, if you live in a brick 4-story 90 year old high rise in NW Portland, you're definitely going to die.  One of the free things you can do is read through Oregon's report on what the damage will look like. Let's just say you're woefully underprepared because the actual damage is going to be to the infrastructure.   Basically, depending upon the scale of the earthquake, you'll want to have plans to head to greener pastures in the High Desert, Midwest or East Coast. Oregon's economy could be devastated for 20+ years after this quake, fuel prices will skyrocket for the first year, and consumer goods of all sorts will be hard to find for months upon months."

I love zippos for their looks and the cool sounds they make but they lack everything in longevity. When I go hiking I prefer the uglier but considerably more reliable Bic lighter Two, I didn't take the time to read through what others have said in regards to getting a knife but I highly highly highly recommend getting a Mora, this is truly the best and most versatile knife you can spend 12$ on.  As someone who collects knives of all shapes and sizes I still reach for my Mora for everyday use over more expensive knives, they come razor sharp and you can buy 4 for the price of another knife of the same caliber. The worst thing that happens is you spent 12$ on a functional tool that you can get great use out of, there's no way you can mess up with a Mora."

And one for our dog.   Take this with a grain of salt, but I think if you are that concerned that you are going to buy a raft, a much better plan would be to move to an area that can't flood. If you are at work and your supplies are at home, the raft does you no good. Unless you have a raft in every car, it would only help you in a situation where you had enough warning to drive home and get your supplies. In that case, you just pack up what you can take from your house and leave. No raft required."

If you're going to ""bug in"" in your home, why worry about weight?  Get some water while you're there.  You need three liters per day per person.

preppers,3dzm3m,Kevman403,12,Mon Jul 20 20:37:13 2015 UTC,"Man where to start.  Lots of repetition of non essentials.  Remember a bugout bag is supposed to be for a few days max.  This means food, clothes, a rudimentary shelter, and money.  You aren't going to need rope, string, bungees, AND zipties.  Go with a few zipties and some paracord for your tarp if that's all you want to take for shelter.  Several clips and caribiners? What do you need these for?  Are you going to be doing extensive rock climbing in your 72 hour bugout?   Not one small grate (which would be a luxury) but 2?  Are you planning on killing tons of game or packing out fresh meats in your 72 hour bugout, all with no gun?  For fish either spit roast them or hotrock them. You're bugging out, not taking a leisure camping trip.  And what if you aren't near water? Unless you have some SERIOUS trapping skills that will do nothing for you.   Tons of redundancy on blades.  Get on good knife and keep your multitool for versatility/small blade stuff.  2 knives, a machete, and a hatchet is a ton of dead weight.  I might take a hatchet (no machete) if I were going out for something like a month and staying stationary, otherwise a burly knife with a strong tree limb for a hammer will suffice for cutting.    Lighting is good, but not 4 flashlights good, especially not if they are all the handheld type.  I generally roll with a headlamp, a decent compact flashlight, and maybe a key chain LED for low light stuff in tent like finding a water bottle in the dark without getting up.    Lastly, food and water.  Get more/different food.  You aren't going to want to just eat broccoli cheese soup, and something cheese based is probably going to give you the poops.  Get some noodles, some potted meat, a comfort snack or two.  And for water, I'd go with a second bottle at minimum lest you find yourself with no way to hold water if one breaks/gets lost, and a better filter that than life straw.  Personally have heard NOTHING bad about the Sawyer filter and it has something insane like 100,000-lifetime guarantee with proper back flushing.  Tablets are small enough to where I wouldn't ditch them if you bought them already, but I wouldn't seek them out as a bandana and normal filter is TONS more efficient.  Most notably completely missing from your bag is a sleeping bag/pad.  Depending on where you are located not having that could literally be a killer.  And yes, you will need food for your dog.  Though with the proper gear (check out outward hound) your dog could probably carry its food/water itself provided it isn't a little toy type."

For example, binoculars are large and usually rather heavy for what you get. It’s unlikely that you’ll be scouting out things when fleeing from a disaster area, unless the disaster you’re fleeing from is a war zone.  I have a guide here: 10 C’s of Survival and Emergency Kit Considerations that you might find interesting.   I’m also curious about your food choices – as you might want to diversify your options to include quickly-made snacks. Dehydrated food often requires getting a fuel source going, boiling water, and other preps – this can be difficult to do if you’re on the move or exhausted. Some light weight no cook options are worth including.   You might also want to throw in some large plastic trash bags, the more heavy-duty the better. These can be used for improvised shelter and for storing unnecessary gear.   Lastly, a second or third collapsible water bottle are very handy.  Do you have much experience backpacking?"
preppers,3dzm3m,fidelitypdx,4,Mon Jul 20 21:54:50 2015 UTC,"Best advice I could give you is to go backpacking with your dog. The only thing more enjoyable than buying/assembling gear in a pack is using it. You'll quickly learn some things you don't need (ponchos never work) and youll find things you wish you had. Get good at it, slowly buy QUALITY gear. Instead of researching on forums what you should have, soon enough you'll be the guy telling people what's worth getting based on YOUR EXPERIENCE! It's good practice for carrying a pack for miles too!"
preppers,3dzm3m,macgyverwannabe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:04:23 2015 UTC,"Get a couple of these for your secondary bag.  It's not a comfort item.  The filler in your sleeping bag compresses to nearly zero beneath your weight, and you will lose a lot of heat into the cold ground in colder weather.  Also you need three liters of water per person per day.  You need to be able to carry at least that much, unless you're certain you will always be in an environment with a water source every mile or two.  It looks like your kit has one small water bottle.  Maybe get some inexpensive Platypus bags.  Very light and much tougher than they look.  I see you have a compass, but can you navigate in dense woods with just a compass and no map?  You know you're heading north, but is that deeper into the woods or toward a road?  Consider an entry level GPS which has a built in base map, or plan on having detailed terrain maps for every conceivable bugout location.  Keep batteries separate, with spares, in a ziploc just in case they leak in storage.  Also consider extra socks, fleece, hat, and gloves for cold weather.  Could save your life."

Take what you have and walk just a few miles. Maybe some local hiking trails. You might be walking for just 5 minutes and think, ""wow I don't need that second grate"" or in hour into it ""wow, I'm already out of water, and very thirsty."" Even if you plan on bugging out via car, you might have to walk a mile or two here or there because of lack of gas, or too much traffic."

preppers,3dzm3m,piiinche,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"A good thing to consider is the ultimate plan. How far away is your bug out location? If you're hiking more than ~10 miles, you will probably need to sleep, which means packing clothes too. Especially socks. I'm a very experienced backpacker and I can say with certainty that fresh clothes are very important for not only morale but hygiene and health too.   I keep a bug out bag with basically everything I'd need to go backpacking for a week. My bug out location is roughly 25 miles from my house. If I can't get there by car for whatever reason, I would hike it. Compass and map are pretty key tools.   Like others have said, try out that stuff. Take exactly what you have and go into the woods to camp for a night. Do a small hike, maybe 5 miles each way, and camp. That's honestly the best guide you can ever get. Experience is a wise teacher.   Overall, always keep the goal in mind. A bug out bag is not a 'survive SHTF forever bag' - it is meant to get you from home to the bug out location. For a lot of people, that probably means little more than a few gallons of gasoline stored in their garage and some hiking boots. If you know you have to go by foot to your location, then start planning on a backpack. But a bike might work and be quicker. Or a dogsled (who knows?). Or some faster mode of transport."
preppers,3dzm3m,Gravlox15,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:43:29 2015 UTC,"2 pairs of purpose made hiking socks are worth it.  If you are hiking in boots the cotton athletic socks are going to hold moisture and chew your feet up in a day.   Consider packing a 10ft string of 100 LED solar lights instead of 2 of those flashlights. Recharges itself and provide moderate lighting for an entire camp all night.  I don't pack extra zip-locs, already have plenty of them holding food that can be reused.   You didn't specify the type of poncho's, I'm guessing they are the $1 disposable type. Alternately you can pack 4 garbage bags which I find more multipurpose.   Replace the machete, hatchet, 1 knife with a heavy Bowie."

That is not a very good simulation at all. It is meant to be all comedy.   However, some simulation games that are actually based on reality I can get behind. For example, the bushcraft simulation games I like because while unrealistic some of the techniques I have learned. For example, the game Lost In Blue taught me how to make a bow fire starter. It took me a good long while to get it to work but I got it right eventually."

I've worked with radios, went to school for electronics, but had no interest in ham. I decided to go for it and had my license in a few days.  No idea what part of the world you are in, but you have a local ham club. I guarantee it. There is someone there that will take you under their wing and teach you as long as you take care to respect the airwaves and not interfere / be a nuisance to other users."

preppers,3dyouk,retrobuddha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:20 2015 UTC,"When SHTF you need to know how to use it effectively. Something like a handheld with a rubber duck antenna is about as plug and play as it gets, but you get much better performance if you know how to optimize it for the situation you are in. You also still need to know where to look for people and how to integrate into their communications protocol. If you buy a radio, throw it in a drawer and never touch it, you won't get anywhere when you actually need it."

They are independent transceivers, dependent only on other like units to have the same channel capacity and reception proximity. Early CBs had individual channel crystals. Later ones had 23 channels, then 40 channels, then 40+sideband, then FRS. Shortwave outdates them all.

preppers,3dyd7l,psuskifan,4,Mon Jul 20 18:05:38 2015 UTC,I have an SKS with about 2000 rounds currently. I would like to get a bow. I havent done the research yet to find out if I can get away with an inexpensive recurve or not. A slingshot would be cheap and fun either way.  I haven't shot one of these new air rifles yet but at over 1000fps for .22 these things are not red ryder bb guns. I'm not sure you guys are giving them fair consideration.
preppers,3dyd7l,psuskifan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"Do you like the SKS?  Where did you get?  What model. I have it on the list.  Wound up going for a WASR-10 (Romanian AK47) for $425 instead, mostly due to it being new with higher capacity."
preppers,3dyd7l,psuskifan,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:00 2015 UTC,I got it from a friend for $100 because it had feed issues. Just had to bend a part(I can't remember what its called) back into place and put it back to stock configuration and it works like a champ.   Its an early Russian model. I lucked out on that part. I would've paid $100 for a malfunctioning Chinese.  I really like it. Quick reloads with stripper clips are easier to carry than spare mags and it looks less threatening than most comparable weapons.
preppers,3dyd7l,TheWiredWorld,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:48:57 2015 UTC,Thats pretty cool.  I am really trying to save up for a garand but I may just have to get an SKS.

preppers,3dyd7l,andy-the-englishman,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"I have a .177 that shoots 1000fps. The pellet is a fraction of the weight of a .22lr, so the velocity is high but the energy isn't too high. Yes, they are not red ryders, but you're not killing anything much bigger than a rabbit with it."
preppers,3dyd7l,TheWiredWorld,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:28:55 2015 UTC,Squirrel and rabbit was pretty much what I had in mind. But I think I may have been convinced .22lr is the way to go. Realistically good pellets probably cost just as much to shoot from what I've seen.   I still have some pros and cons to weigh though.
preppers,3dyd7l,edheler,2,Mon Jul 20 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"A silenced benjamin 392 pump air rifle is the way to go. I've just added one to my kit recently for small to medium game and it does the job perfectly. With a few replacement parts for the future and a cleaning kit it will literally last more than a life time. With it being pump you can vary the power according to your range and altitude. You can also get a sheath that fits on the side of your bag which works and looks awesome. What you have also got to think about is the rounds that you carry. I have 5,000 pellets and I'm looking to increase this ..... you can't be carrying 5,000 22lr rounds, that would be crazy, so for me that's 5,000 rabbits/squirrels ect."
preppers,3dyd7l,psuskifan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:56:16 2015 UTC,This was kind of what I was thinking. I am still completely on the fence though. My plan for now would be to stay put anyways so carrying 5000 rounds isn't a huge factor.
preppers,3dyd7l,edheler,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:09:10 2015 UTC,"Look into the Savage Mark II. It's a .22 you can get with a threaded barrel. You don't even need ear plugs with it, seriously."
preppers,3dyd7l,TheWiredWorld,3,Wed Jul 22 00:04:49 2015 UTC,"If you really want to go with an air rifle I would look at the .177 caliber models. I would get a pump and not a CO2 model if you're worried about the SHTF. In this particular use I would also not care about it being single-shot. RWS seems to be a good vendor for air rifles but I don't have any experience with them in particular.  On the other hand a .22LR rifle, if you don't already have one, is a very important firearm in a survival battery. It fills an important space between the capabilities of an air rifle and a centerfire hunting rifle."
preppers,3dyd7l,edheler,0,Mon Jul 20 15:53:33 2015 UTC,"To add onto this the downsides of an air rifle are how you power the ammo: either it's a CO2 cartridge (they cost money, you can run out) or it's a pump action.  Try pumping that thing 7 times to get ready to shoot it, every animal in a mile will be on the move.  Likewise the air rifle has limited range and penetration the light weight of the round makes it VERY hard to shoot accurately in the wind."
preppers,3dyd7l,psuskifan,3,Mon Jul 20 15:59:13 2015 UTC,The ones I'm looking at are spring action. I get what you're saying though.
preppers,3dyd7l,psuskifan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:08:55 2015 UTC,From what I've read a .22 air rifle packs more of a punch for hunting than .177.  As far as .22lr I've considered it but friends are telling me they are having a hard time getting ammo.
preppers,3dyd7l,edheler,2,Mon Jul 20 16:07:36 2015 UTC,.22LR isn't hard to find but it is two times more expensive than before. I think the people who grouse about it are looking for .22LR to return to the old prices which I doubt it ever will.

preppers,3dyd7l,TheWiredWorld,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:06:28 2015 UTC,Because for some unexplained reason everyone decided to buy up all of the .22LR ammunition after Sandy Hook. The manufacturers didn't have enough capacity to keep up with demand and eventually figured out that they could charge more than they had before without losing  customers.

You used to be able to get a brick of .22 at any hardware store, fishing shop, etc.  People saying they ""can't get it"" are not looking hard enough.  On ammoseek you could have 20,000 rounds shipped to your door by the end of the week."

preppers,3dyd7l,Ticket2ride21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:31 2015 UTC,That price definitely makes a .22 more appealing than what my impression was. I may see what I can get a savage model 24 for.
preppers,3dyd7l,psuskifan,3,Mon Jul 20 18:50:50 2015 UTC,"If you're going to get a .22LR rifle get either a Ruger 10/22 or a Marlin 795. You won't regret either purchase. The Ruger is the modification champ of the .22LR world and can be customized in just about any way. The Marlin is an excellent, lower-cost semi-automatic rifle. Both can be turned into Liberty Training Rifles and then taken to an Appleseed to learn how to shoot."

If you are trying to hunt a rabbit, scare someone off, etc. you are going to be able to get the job down with 30 semi auto rounds, even at .22.

You can learn to be deadly accurate with these things. They are cheap to shoot. People who say you don't need one and just get a .22 have CLEARLY never had to operate in silence. Even with subsonic ammo my .22 is loud. That Crossman is as loud as a staple gun. It would allow you to take small game QUIETLY. Also, don't forget that it's dirt cheap to shoot (practice with)  I would add, for longer range I do like to use a .177 but for the most part, that .22 does the job well.   Biggest game I've taken was a turkey. That's right, I said a turkey. You'd be amazed what headshots can do. :)   Also, if you are hunting squirrels and rabbits just remember, it's nice to take a shot and not scare everything off. Also, taking said shot wouldn't let people know your whereabouts.   They have their place in the gun safe."

preppers,3dvi38,LinearFluid,8,Mon Jul 20 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"Aquamira is  a Chlorine Dioxide Treatment.  Read up on Chlorine Dioxide and its disinfecting pros and cons.  The big thing to know is that any commercial product like Aquamira is going to overcharge you for something you can get the raw materials for and make yourself.  It is 2 ingredients  Sodium Chlorite 80% Tech Grade mixed in water to become a solution  Part A. The different companies obfuscate this and calls the solution Chlorine Dioxide. Because when mixed with water the PH of the water will create some Chlorine Dioxide so they can get away with it. But Chlorine Dioxide a Gas is very unstable and dissipates in hours. In solution which Chlorine Dioxide gas is very soluable in water will last for a day. so unless you got the part A right from the company just made it is just a Sodium Chlorite 2% Solution by the time it gets to you.  and an acid which you have options on.  The two common ones are Citric acid in USP powder form  or Phosphoric Acid like in Aquamira. I have found it sold as one product and that is from a Company Called Extinct Chemical Company and it is called Acid Phosphate and it was used to make old fashioned Soda Shop drinks like Cherry Phosphates, now it is used by enthusiasts like me for these old drinks or there are some good alcoholic drink recipes for it.  I keep Sodium Chlorite, Citric Acid and Acid Phosphate on hand.  The chemical this makes, when you mix part a and B is called activated Sodium Chlorite which breaks down to Chlorine Dioxide Gas which is what was used to disinfect after the Anthrax attack. It is the Go to for major disinfection.  So learn about it, learn to stock the raw ingredients, Learn to Mix it and learn what to use it for.   Also to answer your question,  Chlorine Dioxide is one of the most powerful sterilization agent that is out there and it is non hazardous and inert to the body and it's cells. In Gaseous form it breaks down quickly, it though is highly water soluble and is relatively stable when in solution but degrades also within a day but this stuff disinfects instantly. The thing is if you put this in the barrel right and sealed it. It can last a very long time as you pretty much sterilized the entire insides of the barrel. The plus side though if you keep it for awhile is that on unsealing you can retreat it, Aerate and filter and it will be good to go.  As a side note the difference between Activated Sodium Chlorite, it becomes activated by adding the acid and the solution of Sodium Chlorite is that the activated creates the Chlorine Dioxide for disinfection. The Part A Sodium Chlorite solution is sold by itself as ""Miracle Water"" OR MMS Miracle Mineral Solution. people just create a Sodium Chloride solution, Part A of Aquamira with about 2 cents worth of Sodium Chlorite and sell it for $5 to $10 a liter. It is supposed to have health effects by drinking it alone.  Those $10 Aquamira drops uses less then a penny's worth of chemicals. The Part A is Easy to Make, Part B if you want Phosphoric Acid you have to go with Acid Phosphate but if you substitute Citric acid which is way more commonly used then you can get the raw powder."

preppers,3dv5r7,Teerlys,2,Sun Jul 19 20:05:20 2015 UTC,"The thing about prepping is that, other than some universal necessities, you're generally wanting an idea of a specific thing to prep for. I'd advise you to not focus on a total system collapse (TEOTWAKI) to start with. Unless you're pretty well off and have a lot of space it's just too much to look at that all at once. Prepare for the most likely things first.   What it is for you will depend partially on your geographic location. e.g. I'm in a more mountainous area, so flooding is far down my list of priorities. Being snowed in however is up there, so I keep cooking and heating options available for if a utility goes out. My neighborhood is pretty sedate, so I'm not overly worried about riots breaking out. However grocery shopping requires a bit of travel other than the local stores that would sell out fast in a crisis, so I keep extra food on hand. Figure out what is mostly likely to occur for you and start prepping toward that. Once you feel prepared there you can move on to the next thing and the next until your money or storage run out. There's overlap for everything, so taking steps toward one problem helps out in others as well."
preppers,3dv5r7,edheler,3,Mon Jul 20 20:21:55 2015 UTC,Get yourself to being able to survive for a week or two without power or leaving your home. Don't worry about power or comfort — just the necessities of food and water. You can cook on your propane grill (if you have one) thus a solar oven is most likely a nice to have. (I still don't have one of those.) Most of my preparation is concentrated on bugging in because leaving is a much harsher option than the romantic notion most people have about bugging-out.
preppers,3dv5r7,kfmoses1,3,Sun Jul 19 20:03:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I just taught a class about equipment and everyone wanted to know about bugging out and my Get home bag.

preppers,3dv5r7,docb30tn,2,Sun Jul 19 20:17:59 2015 UTC,"Start small. The idea of prepping is for when any disaster occurs, including the possible loss of one or all utilities. Humans need food/water, shelter, protection, and social interaction. Priority depends on the location and situation. Fire building using different methods should be learned. Light, heat, water purification (boiliing), and cooking. Water is top priority as people will die from kidney failure after that time. Food should be obtained different ways: food from the grocery and gardening. Protection from the elements: weather appropriate clothing and shelter. Protection also include guns and knives used to kill animals for food. During Katrina, people looted; what's to say that it wouldn't happen to you (worse case). Knives can be used many ways.  Cover your basic needs first. This goes for staying put or having to 'bug out'. No one wants to leave their home for good. As a prepper, we must be prepared in case we have to leave our homes, temporarily or permanently."

Too many people think that if some bad mojo goes down that they will  grab their bag, throw open the door and walk on out.  Most scenarios will dictate a period of time where you will have to bug in.  Prep around bugging in first.  Water and food should be your first priorities.  This can be accomplished a little at a time, a couple extra gallons of water and some non perishable food each time you go to the grocery store adds up over several months."
preppers,3dv5r7,Teerlys,2,Mon Jul 20 19:33:43 2015 UTC,"There's a lot to invest your interest in when you first get started. To answer your question on big vs small... small can serve dual purpose so in general it's better to start there, but do some good reading before jumping in cash first to figure out what it is that you really need and want. Also, bear in mind the priorities. Water, Shelter, Sanitation, Food. Don't forget Sanitation. If something bad really is going on, you won't want to complicate the situation with pink eye or something worse because you couldn't clean up after wiping your ass.   I'm very new to the concept of prepping, don't have a single item yet.   A good cheap starter for most folks imo is:   100lbs of white rice. Stored properly, it can last for about 30 years and provides a lot of calories for the cash.  Sawyer Water Filter. Lots of water filtration, and it allows you to get clean water for cooking and cleaning rather than just drinking, like the lifestraw. Mainstay 2400 Bars. Good for about 5 years, will withstand up to 300 degrees F and -40 degrees F, and doesn't require water and heat to be able to eat.

preppers,3duk1z,Super6Seven,2,Sun Jul 19 16:51:21 2015 UTC,"We may not be asking the right question here.  There's a lot to consider.  Namely, the OP clearly said a ""get home bag"", not a BoB.  A) where do you live? This matters because if you think you'll be fighting in an urban environment to get home, then you're making a horrible decision.   You won't carry either enough ammo, or have eyes in the back of you're head to account for all the ppl. But IF you choose to do so, than a full size 9mm is you're best possible choice. Brand is utterly irrelevant. Every major manufacturer is reliable. No one can tell you what fits your hand just right. They'll only tell you what they carry.  If however, you're in a very rural area, then a 9mm is profoundly stupid. And you'll want a .22lr like a Ruger 10/22, or a Henry AR7. Both break down to about 16-18 inches for easy storage in a bag, are light, and perfect for feeding yourself via hunting small game if you find yourself 50+ miles from home without gas, or in a snow emergency.   B) A gun in a tool. You sound like you wanna get one and toss it in a bag.   No.  Unless you're budgeting monthly (minimum) range time, with the ammunition costs and bullet costs associated with it, then it'll ultimately be a useless tool you don't know how to use.  It's like these people who buy a breathing tube apparatus for their first aid kit, but have never used one in their life, and have no EMT training with one.  C) Weight matters. Remember ounces lead to pounds and pounds lead to pain.  My beretta 9mm compact is 2lbs loaded (a full size will be slightly more, and a subcompact slightly less). Each box of 50 rounds is 1.5lbs.  Where as a box of 100 rounds of .22lr is just 14oz.   Adding pounds and pounds of weight in the form of a weapon and ammo for no defined protocol or need, is a terrible choice if you're faced with a disaster situation."
preppers,3duk1z,TippyTopDog,2,Sun Jul 19 20:39:45 2015 UTC,"You actually have a serious point, and this is a very well thought out response.  To answer the questions you've posed, I live in the metro east of St Louis, Missouri, so there's a ton of people. I'm not trying to grab something and start shooting. I'm not dumb enough to think that I would survive if I start doing that. The scenario that I'm considering is if I can't get back to my actual BOB or my BOL. This is a backup plan to a backup plan, if you will. I'm not trying to carry 1500+ rounds of ammo; anybody who thinks that's a good idea should get a reality check.  B) You're partial correct on tossing it in a bag. This is not a weapon that I will get consistent range usage on; I prefer to actually carry my .45 and practice with that more. The main reason I'm asking for suggestions on this is because I have no experience with those small calibers. I do get to the range about once a month, so I'll imagine if I have the small caliber handgun in my truck, I'll be getting range time with it. I just considered that now.  C) You're absolutely correct that weight matters. I've done 75+ miles in 4 days on foot with a 60 lbs pack. It sucks, and I'd rather not experience it again if I can avoid it."
preppers,3duk1z,otherguy,3,Sun Jul 19 21:07:21 2015 UTC,My suggestion would be to get an M&P shield or compact in .45. I say this because it fits your budget and you already have a .45; so this way you don't have to have two calibers of ammo. There's no appreciable weight or size difference between the compact pistols between the various calibers- just magazine capacity. Glock and Springfield and a bunch of other manufacturers also make decent similar pistols. Rent some and find out what fits you best.   Also consider what you're going to spend on a holster and how much space you really need to save in your bag vs getting just another full size pistol.
preppers,3duk1z,TippyTopDog,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:27:44 2015 UTC,"Good stuff.  I concur then with /u/otherguy. I also have a handgun/carbine combo in same caliber (9mm).  It's cheaper to maintain one round for multiple uses.  Considering your local conditions, the .22 seems definitely out.  You'll lose rounds per magazine with the .45 vs the 9mm of course, but you'll gain commonality.   But if you want like a compact or subcompact in 9mm for a get home bag at least the weapon handling will be similar enough that the skills are transferable. :)"

I've even seem them in the $190 range. They are great and don't have any issues with mine at all. The manual safety was a biggie for me, and this had it.  I will say, I have shot my buddy's Glock 19 and it was more accurate. We both shot each of them and the Glock was making baseball sized groups at 10 yards were the Millenium G2 was maing coconut sized groups. Still, I would not trade my G2 in."

preppers,3ds67j,edheler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:45:22 2015 UTC,Spare car batteries are way down the list of items for most people. You have to really have a solid base to work from before they become an important item in a last minute scramble. I have looked at getting batteries that have never had acid in them for storage but they are a speciality item and most battery companies won't deal with individuals. The ones who will require quantities that really require a group purchase to make it work.
preppers,3ds67j,KnotNotNaught,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:26:21 2015 UTC,What is stabilizer and why would you need a bunch of it?
preppers,3ds67j,edheler,3,Mon Jul 20 01:56:46 2015 UTC,"Gasoline, if stored in a near perfect environment by itself, is good for about two years. (As little as six months in suboptimal conditions.) Eventually, no matter the container the lighter volatiles evaporate. Butane, one of the lighter volatiles, is important in getting a gasoline engine started.  The best fuel stabilizer can not only keep gasoline from going bad but also make bad fuel useable again. I have 4 32oz containers of Pri-G which is good for a bit more than 2000 gallons of fuel. The Pri products are also shelf stable unlike some of their competitors."

preppers,3ds67j,skyroket,2,Sun Jul 19 05:01:25 2015 UTC,"This is from Minnesota Health website and this is what they say on this matter:   Are the plastic bottles safe to reuse?  An issue of concern is the reuse of the bottles. Reused bottles may be contaminated with bacteria and other disease-causing organisms. Reusing the bottles may expose people to unhealthy microorganisms, especially if the bottles are not washed appropriately after each use.  How long does bottled water last?  The FDA considers bottled water to have an indefinite shelf life if it’s produced in accordance with regulations and remains unopened. Therefore, expiration dates on bottles are voluntary, and may reflect concerns for taste and odor rather than safety. Bottled water should be stored in a cool location away from direct sunlight.   edit:formatting"
preppers,3ds67j,rumlivingston,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:43:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. As far as bottled water having an indefinite shelf life -- water is a solvent, even though a weak one, still a solvent, and the expiration dates on bottled water mean that's when plastic begins to leach into the water all kinds of chemicals you really don't want in your system."

So I wouldn't bother with anything like that.   We've got food for about a month and a half. So I'd have to beef up the long term supplies. Lots of rice and beans and canned goods, etc. And water. Though if this is just affecting delivery to the area water isn't an issue because our water is very very local. As in Lake Erie, a few streets over. So I'd be more worried long term about making sure I can purify and make it safe to drink.   Things like soap are iffy. Not my first buy. We've got a lot of bar soap stocked and that will easily last upwards of a year. So things like dish soap, laundry detergent, and shampoo are just nice things to have.

preppers,3ds67j,Way2_Sp00ky,2,Sun Jul 19 21:46:32 2015 UTC,"Refresh things that age quickly such as bleach, hydrogen peroxide, gas (add stabilizer), any OTC meds we use regularly.  If time was ample, I'd blow some credit on beef, chocolate, citrus and such-- perishables I might not see again for a while. A couple cartons of cigarettes (we don't smoke).  Don't buy: any food my immediate circle can't consume before it spoils or is properly preserved (smoked meat). Don't buy more than your vehicle can handle.  You need to be ready before then.   If you're NOT, here are a few ideas of things you can buy at the grocery store to increase your longer range (other than food for a few months) survivability: First of all, minimize number of stops-- go to very big grocery preferably with a bulk aisle.  Buy popcorn; grains (unhulled and not cracked)- wheat, rye; various beans.  These all store well and plan to eat some, grow some. If no bulk bins, get 1 or 2 lb. bag beans (don't forget to check ethnic aisle shelves).  I have started pretty much everything from two different grocery 10-15 bean soup mixes except the split peas (lentils to lima beans).  Good to know if you want to grab bean seed at low cost on short notice. FYI commercially grown for this market the varieties will be bush not vining varieties.  While in bulk aisle, grab some dried fruit, chopped onions, nuts.  Vinegars- white and cider. Pounds of salt & sugar. Mason Jars with lids (can store dry goods in them until you need to preserve by pickling or canning in them).    Wild card: Buy a whole lot of something weird that everybody uses but you have never seen anybody say they are storing. For trade. But only if you can afford it.  At the grocery have a plan what you will say if people notice and remark on your purchases.  Something like stocking up for some home canning classes.  And if they remark on the grains and beans-- ""Oh yeah, you can make all sorts of pre-assembled soups, dinners and baked goods in these jars."" (True, books exist.)  You need to have good footwear. I recommend you have a couple options before last minute. But if not, you should burn some time getting that.  Best plan, break the non-bulk list out for a different person to acquire and add some lighters, charcoal, cooler(s) if available.  Related questions: Can you get your stuff into your house without people noticing?  Are these things the best use of your time?  Will you be bugging in? Should you be bugging out sooner instead? Don't shop too long and get stuck in the wrong place."

Electrical formulas may be particularly useful, if you don't already have them memorised.  You could also print emergency contact details (radio frequencies, telephone numbers, SOS patterns).

As part of a search and rescue team, we print reference cards with phone numbers, radio call signs / names, channel lists for multi-channel radios and use ID Card clips to clip them to the device or devices or in the kits where they may be needed.   When I was part of an emergency response team in a factory, we had all of our reference cards printed on cards that were the same size as the employee ID card. You could ten make a small ""flip card file"" using an ID clip or chain and have quick access to what you needed wearing it around your neck or clipped in with your ID tag.  There was a bell system in the building for emergencies, so the first hing you had to do when the bells sounded was look at the cards to see what part of the factory you needed to respond to based on the bell code. From there, locations of defibrillators, fire hoses, special equipment etc was on the various cards.   Just apply those thoughts to the checklists you have and make your ""reference cards"" accordingly."

The economics are such that paper printing will always win out for any volume, so it has to be something small, and singular. The real benefit the card will have over paper is durability and waterproofing, but again- check your economics vs laminating paper.  I'd say the only thing to consider it for would be a reference card of data that won't change often and that you want to carry with you.  Crypto keys, passwords, and geoloc coords.   Don't do engineering/physics/electric formulas- the formula alone is useless without context, and you can't/won't print the text you'd need to use them properly. Just put the book in a plastic bag."

preppers,3dr6r6,Evoloner,11,Sat Jul 18 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"Bugging in, unless you're faced with an imminent local danger, is likely the best course of action for most scenarios. You're still going to need the same things as everyone else: water, food, shelter and security. If you haven't yet, read our welcome sticky.  Water is very dependent on where you live. If you live in a desert climate where it doesn't rain for 10 months out of the year you're going to have to store an extraordinary amount to survive even short events. The rule of thumb, for people in the US, is 2 gallons per person per day. If you live somewhere with rainfall year round make sure you have a way to divert and store rainwater off of your roof and a means to filter it.  Food is the easiest part to go from zero to 90 days. Just look at your pantry for things that you already eat that are shelf stable without refrigeration. Then each time you're at the grocery buy twice what you would typically. So long as you keep rotating your stocks most families can easily get to over 90 days of food using this method. Don't forget to store what you need to cook that food. Most of us have a propane grill which we could use for this purpose if the power is out. Make sure you have an extra propane tank or two.  Shelter is easy since you're bugging in. I would make sure you have the little things that will help keep you sane if the power is out for an extended period. You might want to invest in a small solar system to keep a few gadgets powered and think about having books and old fashioned games for children.  Security is a large topic that is almost entirely dependent on the scenario. If you have an aversion to firearms I would try to get over it because there hasn't been a better tool invented that helps equalize the playing field between the strong and weak.  Good luck and if you have any questions ask — there are a lot of us here who are willing to help."

You may have the idea you want to have some friends and family join you in your new prepping hobby but think hard about sharing the fact you prep. Not everyone understands the desire or need to prep. Some will look upon you as if you are nuts. Some will look upon you as future victims. Over the years I have had more than one person tell me ""I know where I will be going when the SHTF"" and they were talking about our house because we are prepared.   More than one of your neighbors will turn into marauders when SHTF. Make friends with everyone around you and stay on good terms with your closest neighbors. Strength in community is more important that fire power and dehydrated foods in most SHTF scenarios which are normally over in days, not weeks months or years. Your greatest threat will most likely be local. A starving family can be more dangerous than any natural disaster.  Always start with the mindset of bugging in. Once you feel secure about those preps you can work on bugging out. Make sure your home preps are up to grade and stable before you think about leaving the place. If you have to bugout then most likely shits gotten really bad and you'll need to be properly prepped with a bugout vehicle and location. Those can be your most costly expenditures in a survival plan. You are better off focusing first on self sufficiency and homesteading.  True prepping is a lifestyle, not a hobby. As you progress you will come to understand how prepping changes the way you think about things. Focus on knowledge and not on gear. You can replace the coolest backpack with a garbage bag if you have the knowledge to do so. Education will save you faster than cool gear and gadgets."

preppers,3dn1pa,44Dave,3,Fri Jul 17 17:00:02 2015 UTC,"I've been down this road, and this is my advice for what it's worth.  Krav is great and you should definitely do Krav. But it's hard to train fulltime. It's a very negative midset to keep yourself in training it 3 days a week or whatever. Also there are a lot of psychopaths that do Krav so the chance of injury is high.  I found doing BJJ full time was better. It's a really relaxed and chilled out environment, there is more of a sport element to it so you're not constantly in a state of agitation, while still learing excellent technique that's easily transferable to the real world.

The hiking with a heavier backpack requires getting ""into the zone"", constantly pushing forward and not camparing to your regular time/pacing.

preppers,3dn1pa,MeatCurtainRod,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:00:04 2015 UTC,Over the past year and a half I lost over 50 pounds. I started by just keeping track of what I was eating using MyFitnessPal. After I had lost about 20 pounds I then started working on my cardio in mid May 2014.  The first time I got on my treadmill I was only able to go for about 12.5 minutes at a little under a 3 mph pace. After a few weeks I decided to move to an even slower pace but do it for longer to burn more calories. In July and August I did cardio exercise for over 36 hours each month. That resulted in another 20 pounds of weight loss and at the end of the month I was doing 55 minutes on my treadmill at a 3 mph pace.  Unfortunately I hurt my foot in the fall which put a serious damper on my fitness goals. I wasn't able to really get back on a regular pace until late March. Since then I have primarily worked on shorter but more intense workouts. Today I typically workout 30-40 minutes at about a 4.4 mph pace.  When I started I wasn't what most people would have called overweight. Now I know how far I was from anything resembling a decent level of fitness. I am planning on starting a few new activities soon to start working on adding a bit of muscle while I work off the last of the fat in places that I don't want.  My advice is to get a pedometer of some variety that synchronizes with MyFitnessPal. Also buy a Bluetooth heart rate monitor to use with your smartphone to help you know how hard you're working out. You need to know that you're in a zone where you're improving your fitness and it's easy to go either too hard or too easy.
preppers,3dn1pa,MissTricorn,-2,Sat Jul 18 01:46:04 2015 UTC,"There is a typical fitness standard for hikers and outdoorsman, and specifically a weight training setup as well.  Basically it is about endurance, core strength, and moreso about legs and less so about how much you can bench press."

Every body is different, every person has different needs, and every hiker has different goals.  There is no standard template that you can apply.  There is, however, just as I pointed out, a variation of a common standard of practice by seasoned veterans who hike and work out on a regular basis and do come up with their idea of what you should do.  Some of these people post online, and can be found using google.  I don't speak for google.  Don't ever take their first pick as it shows just how lazy you are, and are bound to fail this endevour.

For example, the drought in the west coast right now is often being blamed as climate change by locals. However, the entire rest of the US is receiving severe flooding this year. How do you prepare for that, and is there any indication that next year we won't receive the floods and other parts of the country will be in drought?  The whole climate change thing is too topsy-turvy to reliably build preps around, because we simply don't know how climate change will actually impact most people.  But, there's a lot of preps that can really help no matter what happens, for example being self sufficient. Generating your own food and power are really good steps. You can also create your own microclimates using greenhouses, so no matter what mother nature is doing you can still control at least some of your land. You can collect your own rain water to have plenty in the event of a drought. These are good steps to take regardless of why you're doing them."

I have worked as hard as I can to put most of my basic needs (food, water, heat, lighting, etc) on a renewable footing that will not require input from elsewhere.     I expect over the next few years we will all see prices for most foods increase steadily.  Local farmers in my region have already noticed this  in relation to corn/beef.  If you can produce either they are selling quite high.    Becoming self sufficient in terms of feeding yourself is not easy.  It has taken me years so far and I still have a ways to go.

Since the problems are location dependent but the predictions are general and hard to prep for I am planning to settle and build a small affordable homestead someplace that is has a moderate climate (high-elevation, but undecided on which one of the mid-atlantic states) and if I can, buy small plots of additional land in several other locations (Acreage in Panama first, then maybe eventually Canada if I can afford it).    We know that there will be sea rise, higher temperatures, more drought and forest fires, more frequent extreme weather events, less groundwater available, a change in ocean temperature and currents, and a solar minimum probably eventually leading to a mini-ice age but we don't know precisely how much or how to quantify the changes in temperatures, ocean levels, ocean currents/winds, and ground water availability in each location or how quickly they will change.   Personally I have settled on improving my current skill set instead of expanding it, so  I'm learning more about gunsmithing , woodworking, archery and herbalism in addition to programming.  Hopefully programming will let me pay for some land quickly and I plan on building log cabins on my North American properties.  Panamanian mountain land is cheap in the off-the-beaten-path locations, so building a very modest concrete-block home there is a realistic back-up plan (Think cinder blocks and a metal roof).  I had been trying to plan for long-term demographic changes so that I would still be living in a rural location 30 years from now, but it seems extremely unpredictable."

Nobody knows what it'll be like in ten years. How do you learn to plant crops in that situation? How do you have any kind of food security? Sure, I could plant fruit trees - but if the climate changes enough, they're going to die. Right now I'm thinking greenhouses, but frankly I don't have a solution."

For example, the coldest winter in the Central England Temperature record is 1683-4, but the winter just 2 years later (both in the middle of the Maunder minimum) was the fifth warmest in the whole 350-year CET record. Furthermore, summers during the Maunder minimum were not significantly different to those seen in subsequent years. The drop in global average temperatures in paleoclimate reconstructions at the start of the Little Ice Age was between about 1560 and 1600, whereas the Maunder minimum began almost 50 years later.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum#Little_Ice_Age"

I think the best tactic would be to have a few of different types.  Regular ink pens usually have a seal that has to be scribbled off before the first use-- so keeping new might help retain good ink longer.  I can't speak to pens brands, but in case this is helpful-- I've had some Sharpies (basic marker and fine point) I use intermittently for events that lay around packed for months in between. I would count on 2-4 years provided they are tightly sealed between uses and of course depending on how many ""yards"" of ink you use up writing with them.  They last a long time at home, too-- I try to store standing point down when not in use.  If your BOB is in your car, that would shorten time with heat & freezes I would think."

Definitely good to know though, will be looking into this further. edit *spelling"
preppers,3d4x58,ZsquaredZ,3,Mon Jul 13 18:20:42 2015 UTC,"As someone else said, 5~ years is ideal as cheeses get sharper. If you're going for long term, I'd start with a milder cheddar as they tend to do well. This only works for HARD cheeses - any hard cheese can be waxed, but as they continue to ripen, it can be quite overpowering if you start with a cheese that is already aged.   Once waxed, keep them in a cool, dark place like a basement or root cellar if you have one, if you don't, I suggest keeping them at the lowest place in your house as far away from any heat source as you can. Checking them for mold is important - I do that every 3 to 6 months. If there's any signs of mold, just cut it away and re-wax that portion. If you've waxed correctly (nice thick layer) you shouldn't have that issue.   When ready to eat, just cut through the block. It should just peel away. If you've ever eaten a round of gouda, it will be like that. Just make sure you are using CHEESE wax - other waxes are brittle or don't come away from cheese as well.  Protip - brush cider vinegar on your cheese and allow it to dry before waxing. It will help keep the bad mold away.   If you're not into waxing, you can also vacuum seal cheese and store it just fine. I've kept a vacuum sealed hunk of cheese for months at a time on my counter and it has been just fine. It never lasts longer than that in my house due to our cheese loving nature, but it works. You can also wax AND vacuum seal if you want to.   Happy cheesing and good luck!"

US Military MRE's being produced today only store for about 3.5 years at 70 degrees. This doesn't mean that they don't retain some nutritional value or aren't physically safe to eat.

preppers,3d0fjl,blueberrysteven,3,Sun Jul 12 19:06:20 2015 UTC,"About 4 years, there was a massive tornado outbreak across the upper south, and I was in huntsville AL going to school. North Alabama got nailed hard. That night, coincidentally the night before finals, the power went out and tornados were dropping all around the town. Cell towers were down, so the only way to get news was tv after people's laptops and smartphones died. The only thing I did right was cook a massive crock pot of chili and spaghetti (chili 5-way, fills you up for hours) since I knew many of my friends hadn't gotten dinner and nobody was leaving the building. We ended up eating under the emergency lights and then headed to bed around 1 AM.     The next morning, the power was still out, and we realized that there was a ton of damage. The campus was ok, but some neighborhoods and small suburbs got hammered. Rumor was that all but one of the high voltage transmission lines into the city were down, and it would take at least a week to turn most of the lights on. Furthermore, there were rumors of damage at the water treatment plants, and we might have to go under a boil water advisory. I had a flashlight with a few extra batteries and about 6 bottles of water, some beer, and a decent stock of groceries that weren't much help because i had no power with which to cook. For a town of 200,000 people, this could make the next week pretty chaotic if everyone was prepared at my level.     A few roads out of town were clear enough to drive on, but I wasn't prepared for that either. I had maybe 2 gallons of gas in my suv, and the few gas stations that had power for their pumps were rumored to be cash only. Luckily, my best friend had about a quarter tank in her 4runner, and her girlfriend who lived an hour away in Florence still had power. Since the school canceled finals, we decided to get out of town that day, because there were rumors of small-scale looting and break-ins. The police wanted to put out a curfew that night, so we left that afternoon. I packed a bag and cleaned out my fridge. I put a few good steaks in an insulated lunch box, and gave the rest to some guys who managed to find several bags of charcoal and were grilling everything the could find and passing it out before it spoiled.     We left in the early afternoon, but the normally hour long drive took 2.5 hours due to the combination of like-minded individuals packed onto very few open roads. We made it to florence, and it ended up being 8 days before we went back to huntsville. Power was still out to parts of town, so leaving was definitely the right choice given my level of preparedness. While the town didn't break down Katrina style, I still remember feeling ashamed that I was that ill-prepared, especially since i didn't even have enough fuel to leave. Ever since then, I keep enough food, water, cooking fuel, portable power, and entertainment to last a long time. My gas tank never gets below two-thirds, and I keep an extra 20 gallons in the shed. Next time, I'll be ready."
preppers,3d0fjl,fcb98292,2,Sun Jul 12 18:50:29 2015 UTC,"Nice account of events. It was the threat of curfew that motivated me to serious action and spending to make my plans both realistic and prepped. Nobody is safe, healthy and in good spirits when they are trapped."
preppers,3d0fjl,CyberMinney,3,Sun Jul 12 19:36:59 2015 UTC,"For me, it was an Ah-Ha moment coupled with good timing. And it's a bit sentimental. I reconnected with a good friend from high school who had moved out of state and got married. Her and her wife were a couple years into prepping, and she started talking to me about her garden, her chickens, canning, etc. I thought it was just a fun hobby. At the time I had been with my now husband for about a year, and we had amazingly high paying jobs. Unfortunately, we were also blowing a lot of money on trips to Disney, dinners, etc. We had nothing in savings, because we were both pretty secure in our jobs. She finally convinced me to start paying down more of my debt than I was, and for a couple months I did. She sent me articles and links about prepping, and while I could see the logic in doing it, I blew it off because, well, I just didn't see anything bad happening. We signed the lease on a new apartment, just the two of us, out of where we were living with room mates for much cheaper. Then I lost my job. We were able to pay the bills with just my husband's (then boyfriend) income, but our ""good life"" was on halt. We were stressed, and inevitably, we fought. My cat, who is my beloved pet, got fleas because I stopped getting her advantage when I lost my job. I had to ask him if I could spend some of our last money before his next payday to get it. This lead to a huge fight. We made up afterwards, but before we did I swore to myself that this would never happen again if I could help it. I looked in her eyes and promised her and myself that I would take care of her, and depend on nobody but myself to do so. Sentimental and silly, but it started something. I went back through the articles my friend sent me. I made my own laundry soap, made meals with real ingredients that were cheaper than the pre-packaged stuff we had been buying that even gave us leftovers. I couponed, made cuts in our spending, and was able to recover the money I spent on the advantage. I felt so accomplished doing it, that it eventually led down the rabbit hole to where I am now. I live in Florida, so I prepare for hurricanes, but mostly I am driven by wanting to be able to take care of myself and my husband, and my cat, without relying on the government or anyone else. And while I was able to find a job about six months after that happened, our entire relationship/marriage has been a constant pattern of only one of us being employed. Even with the drastic reduction in our income, I now have my emergency bags, plans, and more knowledge. I was even able to build up a small amount in our savings, which was fortunate when my car needed a new starter a couple months ago. I was able to save money on by replacing it myself, but without the savings I couldn't have even bought the new starter."

preppers,3cy16e,PabstyLoudmouth,5,Sat Jul 11 23:21:13 2015 UTC,"But this is the thing. You say ""in the last round of rioting"". Are riots considered ""normal"" for that level of civil unrest? I don't think New Zealand has had a riot since 1981 and that was due to a Rugby game.  It isn't the firearms that cause the civil unrest. I think you need firearms because of the civil unrest. But it seems to me destroying things is a sign of showing defiance against the current state of affairs and that wouldn't actually help anything in a likely SHTF situation. Or is increasing civil unrest the type of SHTF situation people are preparing for?"
preppers,3cy16e,Redneckpride99,8,Sat Jul 11 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"I look at New Orleans after hurricane Katrina hit as my SHTF type of scenario. Lots of people (over a very large area) were forced into small spaces because of limited save zones. Those safe zones were poorly prepared for the number of people that showed up and had limited necessary supplies like food, water, and sanitation. Those people then went in a desperate search of necessary supplies. People when faced with starving or dying of dehydration will do anything to prevent it. If you have supplies and don't have a way to secure/protect them, you will have those supplies taken from you (most often to the immediate detriment of your health/life). In America we focus on the guns a lot because without it the rest of your preps can easily be taken from you (if necessary, from your cold dead hands). Also, here in the US we have plenty of wild game and guns can be used to provide food as well. Firearms are the best means of protection (why do you think police carry them?). Bats and such are substandard and require skill, strength, and stamina to use even moderately effectively, and an entire platoon of soldiers armed only with clubs can be easily defeated by a single man with a rifle, distance, and enough ammo (see angry hoard coming, shoot the one that looks like a leader and watch the entire group retreat, repeat as necessary).   Organizing community responses and ""coming together"" are great in concept many communities did just that during Katrina, (however they also organized a community armed security force (also Google Korea town during LA riots)), but what happens when that system breaks down and you can no longer rely on your neighbors (such as communities that aren't closely knit)?"

But doing so will always lead to charges and investigated, and most often one would be charged of excessive violence.

Here, to get a firearm you need to do a safety course, get interviewed by the police, and demonstrate you can store the firearms correctly. There are several licence types, the easiest of which allows access up to semi automatic rifles. Most common are bolt action for big game and shotgun for birds. You can carry your firearm to and from a valid purpose but at no other times. You can get a handgun licence but must be a member of a club and have higher storage requirements. You are allowed to carry your handgun in a locked container to and from the club only and can only shoot at the club. You can get a military-style semi-automatic licence in certain circumstances too. All shootings even defense related assume you'd get charged and self defence is not a valid reason to obtain a firearm. I am just going through the licence process and will probably get myself a 12-gauge shotgun for duck hunting and small game, and a 308 bolt action for larger game.  I'll also join a hunting club to learn from. In SHTF, hunting will probably come in very useful because we have a lot of bush in NZ, but as above, highly doubt I would need it for self defence (never hurts to have it just in case though)."

In fact, recently they were all closed due to flooding for a couple of hours and Wellington was cut off. In addition, our main water pipes into the area run along a known fault line so during a major earthquake we could be out of water for at least several weeks.  We do have a major port and lots of water access so supplies could be shipped in though. My main prepping is therefore first water supply, then food.

An MSSA cannot be used ‘under supervision.’ No one may use an MSSA without this endorsement.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military-style_semi-automatic    So in New Zealand an AR15 that holds more than 7 rounds is an MSSA and requires a separate endorsement."
preppers,3cy16e,Pisciform,2,Mon Jul 13 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"Military-style semi-automatic:       Military-style semi-automatic (MSSA) is a term in New Zealand firearms law. The category was introduced after the 1990 Aramoana massacre, in which firearms fitting this definition were used.  The statutory definition of an MSSA is laid out in the Arms Act. The Act, together with the Arms Regulations  also specifies the controls over possession and use of MSSAs. The Act is administered by the New Zealand Police, according to policies documented in the Police Arms Manual.   Technically, an MSSA is any ""self-loading"" (i.e. semi-automatic) firearm, other than pistol, with any of the following features:   Folding or telescopic butt Bayonet lug Free-standing military-pattern pistol grip Flash suppressor A magazine that holds (or looks like it could hold) more than 15 rounds of .22 rimfire or 7 rounds of any other cartridge.   Possession or use of any MSSA requires a firearms licence with either a ""C"" or ""E"" endorsement. The ""E"" endorsement allows MSSAs to be used with live ammunition; while the ""C"" endorsement is used by museum curators, collectors, film/TV/theatre armourers, etc. MSSAs are often colloquially referred to as ""E-cat"" firearms for this reason.  To be granted either endorsement, the applicant must demonstrate to Police good cause for possessing MSSAs. The application must be supported by 2 referees who are current endorsement holders, serving members of a firearms-related organisation, bona fide collectors or persons able to demonstrate a genuine long-term interest in firearms. The applicant must also demonstrate a higher standard of security for the storage of weapons than is required for ordinary firearms.

preppers,3cy16e,privatefcjoker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:32:07 2015 UTC,"Humans are social beings and we do better in communities rather than solo. This will also be true in SHTF. Working with a strong community will have better results than going alone.     True. Most Americans believe this too.     While there are some psychopathic people out there, a disaster wont cause everyone to become murderers and rapists. The majority of people will still be good-natured and will far outweigh the psychos.     True. In fact, in scenario after scenario world wide this prices to be true. When a disaster strikes, people band together, not form roving death squads.      Even without official law enforcement, rules will still be made and enforced. This is also where a strong community comes in.     Eh... mostly. Unfortunately the ""rules of man"" only work to keep the innocent, innocent. If you already don't care about society rules, thinking those people will adhere any rules after a disaster is won't go well.      In New Zealand we are a net food exporter and you are pretty much never more than 30 minutes to an hours from a farm or the ocean. In addition, our cities and population is a lot smaller. Therefore, even if areas are isolated, gathering food should still be possible.     The US is (obviously) also a net exporter. However we're massive geographic country. Getting to food is a significant challenge for much of the US if the distribution system breaks down.     New Zealand still has that small town community feel in a lot of places. I have been recently involved in community disaster preparations where people meet up and discuss how to respond, what resources we have, and how we can better prepare. One of the key focuses is on helping others, including neighbours, elderly, children etc and how best we can do that.     Being as physically large as we are, and with 320 million people comprised from a melting pot of the whole world, we aren't so much ""1 people"" as a ""collection of large groups"".  We're also human. So we are prone to picking sides, in everything (ps4 or xbone? Florida State or Virgina? Ford or Chevy? Republican or Democrat? Etc). Being 50 States you see a lot of ""my State rules, yours sucks!"" attitude. Which further divides us into camps.     When issues have occurred in NZ (earthquakes, storms etc) you see very little rioting or looting. It is pretty much non-existent. This differs from other places, particularly in the US at the moment where there appears to be quite a bit of civil unrest, and wouldn't take much for a riot to occur.     Two parts:  When a disaster comes, we also have little crime such as looting. You DO see racist reporting tho lol  Can't tell you the number of times I'll see a flood and white people with bags of food and the caption will read ""procuring food"", but same picture with black people says ""looters"". It's kinda funny. You know, if you're white. Less funny if you're black I imagine.   As for riots, we have ruots, in poor inner cities, over police brutality. They're not over natural disasters and such. But remember, poor inner city people loot, burn and destroy their own neighborhoods. For some fucked up reason.  I live in an affluent area of a major US city. If riots started tomorrow, I'd put my feet up or go out to a bar, relax, etc.... it's not like they'll get to me. They'll spend a few days destroying their own neighborhoods, why do I care? So honestly, most Americans could care less about the few riots we've had.    Based on the above, I just can't see things turning into bands of raiders going around killing people. In most cases, I would imagine communities to band together to rebuild, and that would include law enforcement. I am about to get my first firearm, but that is to learn hunting rather than self defence.  Is my reasoning wrong? Do  think because of my location things would be different or do you think humans are naturally violent by nature and will turn that way no matter the social surroundings?     Honestly, the main reason you see Americans think this way?   Hollywood!!  Seriously, we're inundated with shows like:  Walking Dead, Z Nation, World War Z, Fear The Walking Dead, The Last Ship, The Strain, Contagion, and I could name 50 more.  Don't get me wrong, they're fun. I enjoy them. But they're completely unrealistic. However, a lot of people are very impressionable.   The US is rich, and we run out of shit to spend money on, so, we prepare for zombies, aliens, Mad Max, Waterworld.... blah blah blah. Cuz we're ready for everything else.  And it'd be more fun if we weren't protected by the most powerful military on earth. Kinda takes the edge off.  Your outlook is correct. The US is just a bit skewed cuz we're bored a lot."
preppers,3cy16e,Pisciform,3,Mon Jul 13 02:32:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the considered response. In regards to point 3 it depends on your percentages. For example if you have say a 5% criminal element, then you can probably make and enforce rules as you have the power to do so. The higher the criminal element, the harder to enforce rules and therefore the more lawlessness occurs. And in that case, everyone becomes more anti-social, leading to more lawlessness and a downward spiral. If you can establish order again quickly, then you would be in a better position to prevent that lawlessness. That is why things like pre-established community watch groups and community plans are worthwhile I think. Over here, people talk about establishing a ""new normal"" as quickly as possible after an event. It may not be the same as it was, but it is in a new stable environment."
preppers,3cy16e,TheWiredWorld,2,Sat Jul 11 23:25:24 2015 UTC,"That's a very healthy approach.  I know rural people in the US worry about ""hordes of city people"" invading for food, land, etc.   I get the math. I mean, there's more people in my city than 50% of my State. So thinking that there's ""millions of people who will be desperate and need food"" coming to your town of 1000 paints a scary picture. But that's a profoundly unlikely event.  But I still say the US approach to extreme prepping is mostly silly.  Like, I live in a cold ass place sometimes. So of course I have water in, extra food, batteries and flashlights, candels, a generator, etc etc. We lose power often enough.   If you live on a Fault Line and don't have an earthquake kit you're an idiot.  But people here tend to forget how big we are. So I hear people ask what others would do with pets if SHTF and more than a few replies said shoot em and bug out.  Seriously?  What (likely) event can't you escape with a few hours of driving? When Katrina hit, I was 1500 miles away, life was normal.   When California wildfires happen, people just get in their car and drive a little ways to a hotel.  The idea that all of America will suddenly collapse all at once is pretty stupid  :). But I see people spend money (they often don't have) preparing for an event (that won't happen).

My idea of prepping is to see how my family and I can make use of the land around us efficiently, and ensure that we could sustain off it. The basic drill is: in a SHTF scenario, we cannot buy any food in the supermarket.  Now, I'm not particularly worried about looters and raiders coming for my village, as I'm sure they would stay in their towns, and fight amongst themselves, but if they do decide to try starting some trouble, it would be a playing field rigged on my side - I know the land, I've been preparing for the last couple of weeks/months in SHTF for confrontation, and they would only have close-combat weapons.  However, I'm only even slightly worried about the towns - one's a rather rich district, and the other can get a bit... chavvy, as we'd say, but again, I don't think they'd be able to get far after the few weeks in to SHTF."

preppers,3cxkgc,xsunxspotsx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia's article on 1815, The Year Without a Summer about what it was like when one volcano and a quiet sun ruined everything.  North America In the spring and summer of 1816, a persistent ""dry fog"" was observed in parts of the eastern U.S. The fog reddened and dimmed the sunlight, such that sunspots were visible to the naked eye. Neither wind nor rainfall dispersed the ""fog"". It has been characterized as a ""stratospheric sulfate aerosol veil"".[7]  At higher elevations, where farming was problematic in good years, the cooler climate did not quite support agriculture. In May 1816,[1] frost killed off most crops in the higher elevations of New England and New York. On June 6, snow fell in Albany, New York, and Dennysville, Maine.[8]  Many commented on the phenomenon. Sarah Snell Bryant, of Cummington, Massachusetts, wrote in her diary, ""Weather backward.""[9]  At the Church Family of Shakers in upstate New York, near New Lebanon, Nicholas Bennet wrote in May 1816, ""all was froze"" and the hills were ""barren like winter."" Temperatures went below freezing almost every day in May. The ground froze solid on June 9. On June 12, the Shakers had to replant crops destroyed by the cold. On July 7, it was so cold, everything had stopped growing. The Berkshire Hills had frost again on August 23, as did much of the upper northeast.[10]  A Massachusetts historian summed up the disaster: ""Severe frosts occurred every month; June 7th and 8th snow fell, and it was so cold that crops were cut down, even freezing the roots .... In the early Autumn when corn was in the milk it was so thoroughly frozen that it never ripened and was scarcely worth harvesting. Breadstuffs were scarce and prices high and the poorer class of people were often in straits for want of food. It must be remembered that the granaries of the great west had not then been opened to us by railroad communication, and people were obliged to rely upon their own resources or upon others in their immediate locality.""[11]  In Cape May, New Jersey, frost was reported five nights in a row in late June, causing extensive crop damage.[12]  In July and August, lake and river ice was observed as far south as northwestern Pennsylvania. Frost was reported as far south as Virginia on August 20 and 21.[13] Rapid, dramatic temperature swings were common, with temperatures sometimes reverting from normal or above-normal summer temperatures as high as 95 °F (35 °C) to near-freezing within hours. The weather was not in itself a hardship for those accustomed to long winters. The real problem lay in the weather's effect on crops and thus on the supply of food and firewood. Thomas Jefferson, retired from the presidency and farming at Monticello in Virginia, sustained crop failures that sent him further into debt. On September 13, a Virginia newspaper reported that corn crops would be one half to two-thirds short, and lamented that ""the cold as well as the drought has nipt the buds of hope.""[14] A Norfolk, Virginia Newspaper complained: It is now the middle of July, and we have not yet had what could properly be called summer. Easterly winds have prevailed for nearly three months past... the sun during that time has generally been obscured and the sky overcast with clouds; the air has been damp and uncomfortable, and frequently so chilling as to render the fireside a desirable retreat.[15]  Regional farmers did succeed in bringing some crops to maturity, but corn and other grain prices rose dramatically. The price of oats, for example, rose from 12¢ a bushel ($3.40/m³) in 1815 (equal to $1.55 today) to 92¢ a bushel ($26/m³) in 1816 ($12.78 today). Crop failures were aggravated by an inadequate transportation network: with few roads or navigable inland waterways and no railroads it was expensive to import food.[16]"""
preppers,3cxkgc,nonoahah,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:14:30 2015 UTC,"Year Without a Summer:       The year 1816 is known as the Year Without a Summer (also the Poverty Year, the Summer that Never Was, Year There Was No Summer, and Eighteen Hundred and Froze to Death ), because of severe climate abnormalities that caused average global temperatures to decrease by 0.4–0.7 °C (0.7–1.3 °F).  This resulted in major food shortages across the Northern Hemisphere.  Evidence suggests the anomaly was predominantly a volcanic winter event caused by the massive 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), the largest eruption in at least 1,300 years. The Earth had already been in a centuries-long period, since the 14th century, of global cooling known today as the Little Ice Age, which itself caused considerable agricultural distress in Europe as a whole during its onset; the Little Ice Age's existing cooling was solely as a potentially aggravating factor, as the eruption of Tambora occurred during the Little Ice Age's concluding decades.

Ideally you want a base layer to wick moisture, a mid layer to insulate (trap warm air and hold it to your body), fleece or down depending on how cold it is, or a combo of both. Finally a breathable (important) wind proof/waterproof layer, Gore-tex is ideal. Many people go for the thickest warmest jack possible, this is a mistake, layers allow you to regulate your temp by removing or adding based on activity.

For all intent of purposes: You cannot filter out chemicals. You can filter out bacteria and protozoa. The Sawyer filter removes 99.9999% of them or, a reduction of 6 log units, or simpler still: 6 fold reduction of organisms larger than 0.1 microns(µm). You cannot filter viruses, but you can purify the water after it's filtered.  Here, at the sub-micrometer level, we are filtering most organic organisms and some but definitely not all viruses. Virus sizes range from 5 to 300 nanometers, so the Sawyer filter gets any that are larger than 100nm.  For a household, look into Berkey filters. They claim filtration of certain pharmaceuticals and 95% Heavy Metals.   Beyond viruses, it doesn't filter out everything, and there is a difference between a water filter and a water purifier. There are a myriad of forms of filters and purifiers e.g. chemical sterilizers like bleach or iodine, UV pens, or boiling. Context in size helps a lot with conceptual understanding too. Here is a chart of what we are filtering.  Now, a water filter removes bacteria and protozoa (parasites) but it does not remove viruses or chemicals. A water filter purifier however, filters or destroys all the bacteria and protozoa, but also most viruses. Purifiers are usually more expensive and complicated like UV pens I mentioned above, but they don’t clean the water from turbidity, suspended partials or improve taste like filters do. Nor do any of these methods remove or nullify chemical contaminants like gasoline or any street runoff. It’s also important to acknowledge that there is not one “cure-all”. To feel real reasonably confident in drinking contaminated water you should use filtration in conjunction with a purification method or process. Which method or purification process depends on your suspicion of contamination and your means to do so.  Here is a chart by the CDC outlining the effectiveness of different methods with particular contaminants. The very informantive parent page here.

I hope that you have alternative methods of getting water other than bottled water. Iodine and purification tablets can treat water that you get from rain and well-water.

preppers,3coleo,PreppersSurvive,2,Thu Jul 9 15:00:18 2015 UTC,"These are so dumb, sorry. Maybe if you're building an INCH bag, but the whole point of a BOB is to bug out of an area.   I fish somewhat often and many times I can spend all day fishing with my nice rods and reels and catch nothing. The idea that I would be able to catch something with a crappy tin can fishing kit is absurd. Sure it's possible, but if I've fled my home on foot due to some natural disaster the idea that I'm going to stop for a few hours and fish for food is crazy. It's a bug out scenario, not a ""Bear Grylls stranded in the woods"" scenario.   Not only that, but any calories I could get through fishing would be far less than the weight/bulk of food I could take instead of the fishing kit. Four ounces of trail mix is roughly 500 calories, I'd have to catch a pound of fish meat to equal the same amount of calories."

If I need to eat, I'm going to cheat to make sure I do!  This means nets, baskets, and traps / snares.  But more reliably fish isn't going to be a prefered or even likely source of food.  Small game such as squirrels, rabbits, and birds would be a primary protein source.  It comes down to which food is going to cost me the least amount of calories to obtain AND be the most reliable to get.  I can't count the number of times I've spent all day fishing recreationally and come back with only enough fish to justify an appetizer at best.  Also, are you planning on bugging out to an area with a stream?  That's your ""safer"" location?  Wouldn't it be better to just vacuum seal some dry goods that will stay good for years and bury it at your destination location?  That's a sure thing to have food available unless something finds it.  But a fishing kit just seems to be very short sighted."

He then spends all his family's money to expand a shelter that had been in his yard that he hadn't done anything for years with,  all without discussing anything with his wife.  Then to do the job he borrows heavy equipment from his work without permission resulting in him losing his job.  I don't actually recall him even learning skills,  just building out a tornado shelter in his yard and teaching his kid to put a gas mask on.  But all is well because at the end a big storm,  that had oil in it for reason,  does come while his family is at the beach.  So we're to assume he makes it home to the shelter (trying to escape the beach with everyone else).  But I saw it 2 years ago."

preppers,3ckyug,silverdollars,17,Wed Jul 8 19:13:06 2015 UTC,I sort-of figured out what was happening ahead of time in 2008 when Bear Stearns went bankrupt. (Unfortunately I didn't trust my own judgements enough to keep myself from losing lots of money like most of us.) Given the unusual way that it was handled it made it pretty obvious that the powers that be were trying to avoid some much larger and systemic issue without really telling anyone. We all now know what they were trying to avoid since it just happened later in the year. As I watched what happened during the crash and the response it became apparent that our entire system has been effectively hollowed out. Those who have a lot to lose basically propagandize everyone to think that all is well. That is when I became serious about becoming prepared. Before then I just dabbled a little bit in being prepared.  I can't tell you when there will be another crash or what might precipitate the event. What I am planning for is that it will be larger than 2008. It will likely have serious side effects in the direction of totalitarianism because that's all that the people in control will have left to keep everyone in line. Most of the population will probably acquiesce to the demands of those in power believing they want to save us from whatever is happening. The truth will be that they will be saving their power and nothing else. They may be willing to go to war or destroy half the planet in order to maintain their power.

preppers,3ck5wv,sadfister,4,Thu Jul 9 13:58:29 2015 UTC,"Well you gotta consider what you're a cut ally prepping for and how many people you're prepping for. Unless this supply of knives is split up among a large number of locations and people you're probably good to go on knives, you don't need anymore. Bows are good for hunting and I'm sure they could definitely kill a person if that's what you really want, but consider their limitations in a hostile encounter with somebody who wanted you dead. A bow is not a good close in weapon; nor is it good for a stress shoot/reflexive fire.   Focus less on weaponry and more on a broader approach to survival. Instead of lugging around 50 knives, 2 bows, and possibly several firearms, consider what you'll need that doesn't kill people, like prescription medication, or water purification, or maybe an emergency radio, things that you'll want/need when all you can do is shoot and stab.   Besides that you've mentioned that your knives are a contingency so to speak. How does that work?"
preppers,3ck5wv,sadfister,2,Wed Jul 8 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"The knives aren't the contingency, knowing how to make rudimentary weapons is our contingency. We are prepping for two adults and two kids, the knives are split up between out two bug out bags and our jeep as well as the ones we'll carry on our person for quick use. Yes the bows are for hunting, or sniping if we absolutely had to, but yes they definitely not short range weapons, we have a machete for that, if we needed to (but it's not our main plan for its use). As far as Rx, food and other survival supplies, we've managed to save penicillin, vicodin, oxycodine, 800mg ibuprofen, Xanax and Zoloft in decent quantities for the four of us, as well as a multivitamin and vitamin c. We also have aloe Vera, rubbing alcohol, gauze, bandage wrap, antibiotic ointment, and a host of other medical supplies. Rope, water filtration, a water purifier, netting a tent and a couple of sleeping bags, tarps, and blankets are all some of the things we have in our bags. The things that we have been working on recently are our MREs and foraging skills, and our bows, arrows, knives, and guns. So while we aren't done (I don't think anyone is ever fully prepped) we have got a decent start and are just moving to the next step of several.   But yes, great advice. If you don't have other survival gear, your chances are definitely hindered. I always cringe when I hear someone proclaim ""they don't need to prep because they'll just shoot people to get what they need""."

preppers,3ck5wv,PhilosopherBrain,3,Wed Jul 8 17:58:12 2015 UTC,50 knives and 2 bows is more than enough weaponry for prepping.  Focus in getting a decent amount of arrows and various arrowheads.

Lol we have looked into a compound bow, but since we have the recurves and planning on a few guns, it was third on our priority list of purchasable weapons. This is more for our contingency plan than our main plan. The idea being we want to be prepped on two fronts - if we have our preps and if we don't.   Yes arrows! We've been working on those and looking for our states best natural resources for shafts, tips, fletching, and string materials. :)   Thanks!"
preppers,3ck5wv,Slave2theGrind,2,Wed Jul 8 16:31:37 2015 UTC,How often do you practice with the bows?   Do you train in a knife based martial art? You can have all the knives in the world but they aren't going to be any more useful than a big stick if you don't know how to use them as a weapon.

And I mentioned in another post about getting more knife training for use as a weapon, right now we have basic training. Which is why I've said we are looking into getting more. :)"
preppers,3ck5wv,TotesMessenger,2,Wed Jul 8 17:48:44 2015 UTC,That's awesome. You're one of the few who takes the time to practice rather than hoarding stuff. Apologies if I came across as a bit of a dick.

Based on what you've said, an AK variant would likely be better. That and/or a handgun of some kind, I recommend a Glock 19.  Focus on training.

preppers,3ck5wv,Preaalesu,2,Wed Jul 15 15:10:39 2015 UTC,"The AR is more accurate, can be more customized, and is easier to shoot due to the light recoil. It's reliability is decent, under most reasonable circumstances it won't malfunction. It is a typically more expensive weapon though.  The AK is still reasonably accurate, but it is difficult to accessorize. The real advantage to the AK is reliability. This weapon is absolutely insane with regards to how reliable it is. You can take the upper receiver off and pour sand, mud, even cheesecake into the receiver and in the path of the bolt, and it won't jam.   If you want a weapon that you can do anything with and always rely on, the AK is your bet. If you want a weapon that can do almost anything with, but what it can do it does very well, you should get an AR.  Check out the hundreds of torture tests and comparisons between these two online, just be wary that most of these will have bias towards one or the other."

Nuclear war, asteroids, epic epidemics etc. I don't think any other currency would stay afloat either in this case. People aren't going to want to trade gold for gasoline or food in these situations. Realistic currency is going to be weapons, food, energy, knowledge, and other vital survival items. I just don't see any scenario where metals is a viable investment."

Nowadays, people hold ETFs and mutual funds or notable art. We would have to be completely devastated to bring down our internet,electricity to bring down the global economy. So in that scenario, the prime currency is whatever produces electicty. Solar panels, gas, oil, batteries. Historically golds been an awful awful investment if you compare it to the markets. It's not even close. Gold only goes up during economic weakness due to misguided notions.

If hyperinflation occurs, then you would simply exchange your PM for whatever the corresponding market value of $$ is worth. Then quickly buy whatever item you wish to purchase since the price may increase 10 fold in 30 minutes or so.   If barter economy, then it will be worth whatever the individual seller thinks it's worth. They might not even take it. Because the seller will always set the price in that type of situation.   Gold/Silver is a store of purchasing power. Throughout thousands and thousands of years it has remained an absolutely rock solid stable investment --- even Alan Greenspan says so. However, If the dollar is completely worthless and no one will accept them anymore then even an infinite amount of $$$ won't buy you a loaf of bread, but 1/10 an oz of silver might."

As for the US government, I feel they will look to get out of the situation the only way governments have historically done so.  War is the best thing for a failing economy.  Unfortunately, I feel that the war necessary to bring the US back from that situation will be untenable and permanently altering to the fabric of the nation.

I think of it as your $120  1/10th ounce coin may be worth $200+ and your $40 gram may be worth $80. Then I consider how the heck I'd cut those into $5 or $10 pieces for actual bartering for food, water, and supplies.

That said l, short of opening a foreign bank account, saving money in an alternative fiat currency still subjects your money to the decay of value known as inflation. Keep gold and silver so you keep abreast with inflation, but know you will likely need to sell it hot by bit for exchange of another currency.

The Sawyer is smaller, and can filter 100,000 gallons in its lifespan, whereas the LifeStraw only filters 264 gallons. At last check, the Sawyer was around $15 on amazon.  I have been using the Sawyer for almost a year now, and it’s well-made and easy to use."

preppers,3cdfqo,akambience,3,Tue Jul 7 17:56:28 2015 UTC,"Sure, but it’s not actually 0.1%; I should clarify with getting a little technical: I was rounding up when I wrote 99.99%. It’s actually 99.9999% or, a reduction of 6 log units, or simpler still: 6 fold reduction of organisms larger than 0.1 microns(µm). Here, at the sub-micrometer level, we are filtering most organic organisms and some but definitely not all viruses. Virus sizes range from 5 to 300 nanometers, so the Sawyer filter gets any that are larger than 100nm.   Beyond viruses, it doesn't filter out everything, and there is a difference between a water filter and a water purifier. There are a myriad of forms of filters and purifiers e.g. chemical sterilizers like bleach or iodine, UV pens, or boiling.  Context in size helps a lot with conceptual understanding too. Here is a chart of what we are filtering.   Now, a water filter removes bacteria and protozoa (parasites) but it does not remove viruses or chemicals. A water filter purifier however, filters or destroys all the bacteria and protozoa, but also most viruses. Purifiers are usually more expensive and complicated like UV pens I mentioned above, but they don’t clean the water from turbidity, suspended partials or improve taste like filters do. Nor do any of these methods remove or nullify chemical contaminants like gasoline or any street runoff.  It’s also important to acknowledge that there is not one “cure-all”. To feel real reasonably confident in drinking contaminated water you should use filtration in conjunction with a purification method or process. Which method or purification process depends on your suspicion of contamination and your means to do so.   Here is a chart by the CDC outlining the effectiveness of different methods with particular contaminants.  The very informantive parent page here.  Furthermore, Sawyer released its Microbiological Testing Summery found here   I hope that helped."

The best way to go is to carry a Sawyer Mini for primary filtering and carry Aquamira tablets or drops as a backup. If you suspect water contains viruses, the tablets or drops contain a chemical that can destroy viruses when left to treat the water for the recommended amount of time. If you are located in the U.S. a standard Sawyer filter will be more than sufficient to provide safe drinking water for pretty much everywhere as long as you stay away from water sources near industrial runoff that may contain chemicals."
preppers,3cdfqo,edheler,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:32:16 2015 UTC,Both /u/Irishlefty9 and /u/akambience had very good answers. In your situation being able to fill up another container would be more important to me than the filtration lifetime. Older LifeStraws also had an expiration date but they seem to have fixed that issue. I own both the larger Sawyer Squeeze and the Sawyer Mini and both have performed great over time. The LifeStraw will remove more of the 'flavor' of the water you are filtering but the Sawyer's filtration is slightly better rated.

preppers,3cdfqo,adoptagreyhound,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:10:20 2015 UTC,Carry at least one or two dehydrated soup mixes or a couple of those noodle/rice-and-sauce side dish packets and some protein to put in it. Hot food can do a lot to help raise your core temperature if hypothermia is setting in.

The dry bags add another layer of waterproof if you need to cross a river or get stuck in the rain.  Plus I find bags useful, you can gather water in them, pick edibles, scavenge small stuff.  Since they are mostly kept in my bigger bag I don't have to worry about them being visable, plus I find if you have camo or woodsy colors you can miss things in a hurry.  A lot of times you'll be digging for something and put bags on the ground.  It can be easy to miss a camo colored bag, but not a yellow one.

preppers,3c8q99,PabstyLoudmouth,7,Mon Jul 6 02:31:48 2015 UTC,It might have something to do with survivalism but I agree with Pabsty it isn't really related to prepping. He survived by stealth and theft in a prosperous society which had enough abundance that he could use to keep himself alive while most people thought of it as a fairly minor nuisance. If you think that prepping is about running to the woods when the SHTF you're likely going to end up just another casualty.
preppers,3c8q99,edheler,3,Mon Jul 6 11:19:18 2015 UTC,"So what is the guy preparing for? He took a car that was not paid off and co-signed by his brother and left it in the woods and walked into the dense forest to live the live of a pillager. This man did not hunt and trap for his food, he stole to survive. Sure there are some similarities, but he did not prepare for anything."
preppers,3c8q99,PabstyLoudmouth,3,Mon Jul 6 12:12:14 2015 UTC,"Well, no, he lived OFF of modern society.  Without stealing food, clothes, and every single other thing he possessed, he would have died.  He wasn't prepared for anything.  He was in NO way self-sufficient.  He didn't live away from modern society - he just opted not to participate, and live as a leech.  That's pretty much the exact opposite of preppers."

Also, that guy ate 200 grams of almost straight sugar.  That's obviously not healthy.  From the looks of things, he had two pop tarts, 600 ml of pepsi, 250 ml of orange juice and a banana.

preppers,3c8kjd,YDdraigCymraeg,-3,Tue Jul 7 16:26:43 2015 UTC,"Actually you are wrong. The brain works just fine on low carb. I support a ketogenic diet which is low carb. Your brain is perfectly capable of using fat as  energy on a low carb diet. I have no problem with eating small amounts of fruits. I eat berries and cream on keto and do just fine and stay within carb limits. I am more against refined sugars, fruit juices, fake sugars, high starch foods (which do the same thing as sugar in your body), and carb dense foods. Fruits in small amounts are fine. Just don't eat 4 or 5 bananas, or apples. Your statement is moronic as obviously you know nothing about how adaptable the brain is to low sugar and low carb diets. For the purposes of keto you have to take fiber into account as well, ie: if a food has 25 grams of carbs, but 20 of those are fiber, you only count the 5 grams that aren't fiber.  http://www.neurorexia.com/2013/03/24/brain-livin-on-ketones-a-molecular-neuroscience-look-at-the-ketogenic-diet/  http://brighterbrains.org/articles/entry/ketosis-makes-your-brain-work-better-its-why-dave-asprey-puts-butter-in-his  http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/mind-guest-blog/the-fat-fueled-brain-unnatural-or-advantageous/  http://www.ketogenic-diet-resource.com/ketosis.html  Science FTW."

""Science FTW""... you linked to what looks like 4 blog posts, which (at least two) say that there has been no blind study and mostly focus on the treatment of drug resistant epilepsy. One of those blogs even points to the keto subreddit. But let's look at the references of these blogs... They all relate to weight loss or mental illness, not even all with human test cases. But you seem to be mistaking the brain running somewhat (perhaps mostly) on ketones for it soley running on them. Glucose is most certainly required, your blogs even say it is required to some degree. This isn't even looking the non strictly survival based aspects of sugar, it's a moral boost, when your life is going to shit you need more than just keeping your body going. And for the record... I was not wrong at all, glucose is the only source of energy normally used by your brain, keto diets mimic starvation which isn't normal at all."
preppers,3c8kjd,YDdraigCymraeg,-1,Tue Jul 7 17:27:02 2015 UTC,"The key here is normally, because of our carb rich diet, that is what we normally eat. I would argue however that this is a relatively new thing. For the majority of human history we did not persist on a grain based diet. We ate meat, and whatever other foods we could forage. Meat and fat were the primary staple until we started to farm. There were some tubers, greens and berries we foraged for, but the primary staple was meat and fat. It was the only food source available year round, and the majority of vegetables we eat now, did not exist then. They are the byproduct of agriculture and selective breeding. It would absolutely make sense that our ancestors were in ketosis most of the time, and their brains functioned on ketones. Meat based diets are also attributed to the brain growth in homo erectus. http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/04/eating-meat-led-to-smaller-stomachs-bigger-brains/  http://www.livescience.com/23671-eating-meat-made-us-human.html  This high carb diet we eat now is a new thing on the human evolutionary journey.

But in regards to the early humans mostly in ketosis, this has been covered in a /r/keto thread, where this comment certainly stood out.

Mostly Harmless, Douglas Adams, 1992   I found this story to be really eye-opening as far as the challenges involved in trying to recreate even the simplest bits of modern technology from scratch, even with modern resources available.  Designer Thomas Thwaites, inspired by the above Douglas Adams quote, sets out to attempt to build a toaster utterly from raw materials.  He's released a book about the project as well."
preppers,3c935c,34Mbit,2,Mon Jul 6 01:19:32 2015 UTC,"A good book that involves this theme is Earth Abides by George R. Stewart. The following is a bit of a spoiler, but basically the story is about a man who survives a worldwide pandemic that kills off almost all of humanity.  He wasn't preppared for this disaster, but he had his head screwed on and was full of rational plans for the future; educating children, reading about medicine from libraries, etc. Ultimately though he ends up dying an old man as his 'tribe' regresses into a hunter gatherer group, throwing humanity back a few hundred thousand years.  The moral of the story was that he could live a relatively comfortable life off the scraps of humanity (endless tinned food, docile game, comfortable shelter), and his life was good. Slowly though, it becomes apparent that restarting civilization is completely impossible. His ambission of a functional homestead with educated and enlightened residents was a pipedream.  Another good thought is how to make a cheese burger from scratch - from a homestead-style garden it's nigh-on impossible. The ingredients are grown in different seasons, in different climates, and would require a huge amount of effort. That someone can technically work for something like 6 minutes and buy a cheese burger is a testament to our hugely complicated modern economy."

I can regularly contact a repeater in my area that is linked with others and can reach as far as 400 miles+ between towers. A ham radio license is free. the study guide is 20 bucks. It's a really good addition to any preppers gear."
preppers,3c9923,Techrob25,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:22:56 2015 UTC,by the way. That repeater I contact in my area. Is well over the horizon from my house. I can contact it from at least 20 miles away. It is on top of a cell tower (hence the distance). so it makes life easier. But that also means I can have my voice heard across 4 states when I key the mic.

preppers,3c9923,44Dave,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:57:02 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you're talking about the FRS/GMRS bubble packs you find everywhere.  While those are fine for what they are, you will not get 5 miles out of them.  They are a short range, 1-2 mile solution.  Also, if it matters to you, any one else with one of those radios will be able to listen in (and vice versa of course).  But there's nothing wrong with them as long as you are willing to accept their limitations.  It's a nice cheap solution as well.    The guy above who mentioned a car-installed CB is good advice.  You will get the range you need, at the cost of being tied to your car or house.  And, again, your transmissions will not be secure.  It's a fairly cheap solution as well.  $100 should get you a decent car setup.  If you put a base station at your house you could purchase or make a nicer antenna and get better results.    Amateur Radio is the real solution to all of your communication problems, IF you can get your friends and family to go that route as well.  If they're not on board, you're back to square one.  I'm of the opinion that every prepper needs to start off with some kind of monitoring device - a police scanner of some kind.  You need information.  /r/rtlsdr might be a cheap solution if you want to put a little time into it.    Of course, all of my mentions of cost are based on mainland pricing.  I imagine you will pay a premium to get anything out to you."

preppers,3c64wj,more_load_comments,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:13:18 2015 UTC,"As has been said, the Ball Complete Book of Home Preserving is great. However, for most of the things I used canning for I found the tutitorials and instructions/recipes in the Ball Blue Book a bit better/easier to follow. A lot of it is the same information, but presented a slightly different way.   And remember to be clean and thourough with your home canning. Home canning can and does fail from time to time and can have some very bad health repurcussions. Learn (and of course all of this goes for ANY canned good, really) the signs of if your seal has taken propperly or not. Always be sure to inspect your jars, especially the rims for any defects/dents/knicks/breaks before you can. Learn all the signs of spoiled canned goods.   Also, remember that in general, home canning is only recommended to have about a shelf life of 1 year. So it probably isn't the best idea to home can and then leave them alone and hope they'll be your emergency stash 10 years down the road.   Home canning can be fun and also very rewarding. I mainly use it for things like jams, but there really are a ton of uses. Also of note - remember some foods HAVE to be canned with the pressurized system. Others are perfectly fine with the boiling water method. So some items can be canned with quite little money put out at the start up. Just your jars with lids and metal screw tops. And probably a starter kit. I've found mine quite useful for the cost, pretty necessary even. It came with a jar grabber, magnetized lid grabber, headspace measuring tool and a wide mouthed funnel. Out side of that all you need is a big pot really. So steering clear of things that need to be canned with the pressure canner will save you in cost at start up and as you are learning."
preppers,3c6cbx,DrMcAutopsy,17,Sun Jul 5 06:38:14 2015 UTC,".308 Winchester and 7.62x51 NATO are the same thing, that's why you keep hearing things about .308 when you're looking for 7.62x51.  As for your question: No, 7.62x51/.308 and 7.62x39 are in no way interchangable. They are two completely different rounds with different bullet sizes, casing shapes, and powder charges. Just look at the size between the two and you can see a 7.62x51 is much larger than a 7.62x31. The 7.62 part of the round's name comes from the diameter of the actual bullet and the gun's bore - so while they are the same diameter, the bullets are different lengths and the casings are completely different sizes. I don't think you could even chamber a round properly when using the other's ammo. If you did end up chambering a round and firing it you might end up damaging your gun or worse, hurting yourself or someone else.  Firearms are no small thing. Remember that as a gun owner you represent not only yourself but the rest of your fellow gun owners as well, so be sure to practice the proper firearm safety and maintenance to keep you, others, and your gun healthy. I would also suggest checking out /r/firearms for any other questions. I'm a relatively new firearm owner myself (got my first one last year) and the people there are really helpful and (most) are respectful. They can also help you look for a rifle that would suit your needs better. You can also PM me and though I'm still learning myself, I'll help with what I can.  Edit: I took a pic of some 7.62 caliber rounds for comparison... The one on the left is a 7.62x39 (AK round), the one in the middle is a 7.62x51 NATO/.308 Win (M1A/M14 round) and the one on the right is a 7.62x54R (Mosin-Nagant or SVD/Dragunov round). Though they are all the same caliber, the sizes and weights of the actual bullets vary greatly as well as the casings that vary in shape. Trying to put a M14 round into a Mosin-Nagant or AK wouldn't work, and visa versa."

Whenever I see people act disrespectful to someone asking honest and sincere questions about firearms it bugs me because we were all there once, not knowing anything or very little about firearms. What would we be like today if the people who taught us about firearms treated us the same way? Being rude and disrespectful is a terrible way to treat newcomers, especially just because they don't know anything about the subject in question.  I think it's better to help them with whatever they need so that they themselves can become knowledgeable about guns and hopefully they will treat others with the respect and courtesy that they received when they were learning. A community is not going to get anywhere by criticizing newcomers. Instead of dissuading them, why not help them to become better shooters and gun hobbyists?

preppers,3c6cbx,Marksman243,4,Mon Jul 6 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"No, they are not interchangeable. 7.62mm is the diameter of the bullet (.308 inches), and 51mm(or 39mm) is the length of the case. 7.62x51mm is longer than 7.62x39 and neither round can be used as a substitute for the other. As for the differences in performance, the 7.62x51mm has more range, but it's heavier, louder, and kicks a little harder than 7.62x39 (also, 7.62x39 is generally less expensive.)"
preppers,3c6cbx,redditorwhoknocks,3,Sun Jul 5 14:43:03 2015 UTC,"The round are both 7.62, but are very different. The amount of energy and speed of a 308 is much higher than a 7.62x39. Look at these links and look at ft-lbs and fps and you will see how big the differences are. What it comes down to is how hard they hit. A 308 rifle will push a much heavier bullet much faster, resulting in much more damage upon impact. However, 308 could be considered overkill for short range shooting. Having a 308 and an AK would be a good strategy.   http://www.ballistics101.com/308_winchester.php  http://www.ballistics101.com/7.62x39.php"

preppers,3c6cbx,canadiancarcass,2,Sun Jul 5 15:38:35 2015 UTC,"Contrary to what everyone seems to be saying,  7.62x51 uses a .309 diameter bullet and 7.62x39 uses a .311 diameter bullet. So not even that is the same."
preppers,3c6cbx,happyshlappy,4,Mon Jul 6 00:41:05 2015 UTC,"Same as .223 caliber and 5.56x45 millimeter. NATO cartridges are measured using millimeter so a 7.62 mm found is also a .30 caliber.   So lots of things shoot 30 caliber. M14s, mosin Nagant, AK47s, ar15's, and tons of other.  So the 7.62 only means it's 30 caliber but you need the length to go with it to know what kind of round it is. The 7.62x51 is the exact same thing as a .308 caliber cartridge.   In short the 7.62 is only one part of the description of the cartridge. You need the other half (7.62x39, 7.62x51) to know what you're dealing with.   Now to talk about the differences. The 7.62 has been a standard for military rifles a loooong time up until the last few decades when people wanted smaller, faster rounds (like 5.56). The 7.62x39 is a short, slow, fast dropping, cheap, hard hitting, and relatively light weight compared to .308.   The .308 (7.62x51) is a large, heavy, fast, and extremely hard hitting round mostly used for hunting. It will kill anything that walks in North America with relative ease. But this round is also very expensive, loud, very heavy to carry, and less practical for most uses besides a battleground where it was designed for.

preppers,3c6cbx,03fusc8,9,Sun Jul 5 06:50:50 2015 UTC,"Let me link a pic real fast, I'm on mobile.   EDIT: http://imgur.com/btKZuWi  As you can see that's .308 on top and x39 on bottom. If you know almost anything about guns you know you have literally no option but use the correct round in a gun or you can cause serious damage to the gun and yourself. You simply can't use the improper cartridge in a firearm.   Here's a picture a guy posted to /r/ar15 a while back. http://imgur.com/ZVO34H8 He loaded a .300 blackout into his 5.56 gun. The over pressure literally made the gun explode.   Not to be rude or anything but these rifles can kill a man with a single shot easily and it seems you don't have much, if any experience with firearms. They are very serious and I recommend learning a bit more before a big purchase. Maybe start with .22lr. Much more practical in almost every way besides big game.   I'm more than happy to help with more questions and you can also ask at places like /r/firearms and  /r/ak47 that could help out."
preppers,3c6cbx,HueyCobra,2,Sun Jul 5 06:52:26 2015 UTC,Calling bullshit on this! A .300 Blackout would not chamber in a 5.56 gun. The bolt wouldn't lockup and the gun wouldn't fire at all.
preppers,3c6cbx,happyshlappy,3,Sun Jul 5 12:57:23 2015 UTC,It happens. Insufficient neck tension + closing the bolt quickly can allow the bullet to be pushed back into the case far enough to close the bolt.

The XCR-M is heavy as fuck so the recoil isn't that bad. But it's heavy as fuck and so is the ammo. I buy military surplus in bulk so it ends up being around 50 cents per round. The 7.62x39 is a little cheaper, much lighter and probably as effective for what you'll need it for."

preppers,3c6cbx,autowikibot,5,Sun Jul 5 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah overcharged ammo is bad news for your gun. Think about the barrel and of a gun like this OP... it's basically a long cylinder with both ends shut, one end plugged with the casing and the other end with the bullet and add in an explosion happening between them. Too much pressure and your barrel is going to be shredded like the guy' s AR in /u/happyshlappy's pic, and if there is too little pressure the bullet might get stuck in the barrel (called a squib). A squib can be just as bad as firing an overpowered round if you don't notice and end up firing another round with the squib still lodged inside the barrel.  Basically. No, different sized ammo is not interchangable except in certain specific cases like how 5.56x45 caliber guns can shoot both 5.56 and .223 Remington but a gun chambered in .223 cannot safely fire 5.56x45."
preppers,3c6cbx,bradhuds,2,Sun Jul 5 07:20:36 2015 UTC,"[You're correct, I am just adding a bit of detail to your reply.] Strictly speaking, while shooting .223 Remington in a firearm chambered for 5.56x45 NATO may be safe it will have some accuracy issues. This is due to the fact that while the bullet is the same exact diameter the brass is not the same shape. The Wylde chamber was designed specifically to be a compromise between the two and many rifles which claim they are 5.56x45 NATO are really chambered in it."
preppers,3c6cbx,R_B_Kazenzakis,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:19:49 2015 UTC,".223 Wylde:       The .223 Wylde is a proprietary rifle cartridge chamber with the external dimensions and lead angle as found in the military 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the 0.2240 inch freebore diameter as found in the civilian SAAMI .223 Remington cartridge. Rifles with a .223 Wylde chamber will typically accept both .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition. Note that while the .223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO chambers have slightly different dimension, the cartridges themselves are identical in dimension. The chamber dimension differences are often confused with the cartridge dimensions and so it is often erroneously thought that the cartridges have different dimensions. The cartridges are loaded to different pressure levels (with the 5.56 being greater), however. (The NATO dimensions offset the higher pressure with a longer throat - often confusing some to think the cartridge itself is longer).  This chamber allows the use of both pressure levels safely while also increasing accuracy potential across the range of potential pressures.

preppers,3c6cbx,thestevemeistro,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Besides not being able to physically fit the rounds in the chamber, guns are designed to shoot a certain cartridge(or one very close to it).  Shooting a round with a lot more powder in it than the gun was designed for can cause it to go boom.   Or even less powder. Google ""Glocknade"".  Do attempt to to shoot any ammo out of a firearm unless the firearm was designed for it.  It is dangerous for yourself to others.  I would recommend you go take a NRA beginners pistol or rifle course before you make any firearms purchases.  I do not mean to be insulting, but you are making some very ignorant assumptions, which is dangerous, and probably should have formal instruction before you buy a firearm and ammo."

Types of radiation:   Alpha, the most dangerous, this cannot penetrate the skin but is most dangerous if internalized through eating or inhaling.  Beta, can penetrate into the skin up to 8mm.  Gamma & X-ray, significant penetration, only stopped by concrete and lead. Neutron - Also strong penetration.   It's important to keep radiation in perspective: each year humans experience 300 millirem (mrem) of background radiation. A chest x-ray is 10 mrem, head CT scan is 200 mrem, abdominal CT scan is 1000 mrem, and a transatlantic flight is 4 mrem. Living in Denver exposes you to 50 mrem a year. We experience radiation all of the time, and small additional doses are not consequential. A millirem is 1/1000 of a Rem, which is basically a ""Rad"".   Lethal radiation doses of radiation (at a single moment in time):   LD50 - 450,000 mrem LD100 - 1,000,000 mrem   Most exposure to radiation is through ingestion, contamination, or irradiation: ingestion is rare but usually fatal, contamination is when radioactive particles are physically on your body, irradiation is when radiation waves passes through you (like a medical X-ray). You only need to be decontaminated if you've been contaminated with radioactive particles.     Injury when exposed to radiation:   Cutaneous Radiation Injury - this is basically radiation ""burns"" that happen when exposed to Beta radiation. Essentially the skin cells die over time and it looks like a burn, it's very painful and takes several weeks to start showing, with worst results months or years afterward. Surgery and skin grafting are successful ways to treat this.  Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) - This is when your whole body is exposed to radiation. It comes in 4 phases: Prodromal (the onset, which can take minutes to days), Latent (when symptoms improve, lasts hours to weeks), Manifest Illness (the actual problems, lasts hours to months), Death or Recovery can take years. The larger the dose, the shorter you progress through these stages.   Within ARS there are various quantifiers of doses:   Hematopoietic Syndrome - Dose: >70 - Prodome is 1 hour to 2 days after exposure which includes nausea and vomiting. The latent phase is 1 to 6 weeks. The Manifest Illness includes fever, malaise, bone marrow decline, and increased chances of infection and inability to clot blood. Death/recovery: weeks or years. Around ~120 rads of radiation exposure is where death occurs. Gastrointestinal Syndrome - Dose >600 - 1,000 rads - Prodome is within hours, includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Latent is about 1 week. Manifest illness: severe diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance. Death/Recover: Almost universally fatal within two weeks.  Cardiovascular/Neuroogic - Dose >2,000 - 5,000 rads - Prodome is within minutes, latent phase is hours, manifest illness is often within 5 hours of exposure and includes seizures or coma, death/recovery: universally fatal within 3 days.    Treatments for ARS:   Mostly supportive/comfort - providing fluids, nausea medication, pain medication, may need burn unit care. Antiboitics, antivirals and precautionary measures to avoid diseased people. People with ARS are unable to fight infections. Stimulate bone marrow growth and/or marrow surgery.  Psychological support. After a radiation event most people will want to be screened for radiation even though most people were never exposed to radiation. We can look at doomsayers during Fukushima to see how people overreact and also do not understand radiation exposure concerns.    Other concerns around radiation include an increase in cancers, thyroid disease, and prenatal complications. Radiation will not cause mutations except in future generations.    Where can you expect a radiation event?   Medical devices War & Terrorism (Dirty bombs, nuclear weapons) Nuclear Power and nuclear disasters.   Dirty bombs are mostly going to have psychological impacts as their largest impact, the biggest risk would be inhaling or ingesting radioactive elements. The actual blast will probably cause more deaths and damage.  Nuclear weaponry are also likely to be mostly deadly with the actual explosion, however radioactive dust will fall from the sky and dust the landscape. The longer term fallout is less likely to cause problems.    Sorry folks, stopped taking notes. Here's what I have, I'll edit later maybe."

One backpack or big gym bag for each.  31 loaded miles is three days walking if you work out daily, a week if you're just fit, two weeks if you are sedentary. Two weeks is too many provisions to carry, so get fit or ripped. One week of food, water, etc is the max anyone of fit status can do, without killing themselves trying to get home. 31 loaded miles is too far to carry a rifle. You would get it stolen from you, anyway. Conceal carry a pistol or two, with spare clips. Also carry a concealed machete. You must get training for close combat, grappling and/or ground fighting, as those are the likely scenarios for those weapons. If you are not proficient in one or more of these, please do not carry any weapon, as it will be taken from you and then used against you. As to whether the highway or railroad will be less-traveled, only you know the answer to that.  In the cold of Winter or the heat of Summer, you really should re-evaluate your choice to hit the road on foot. I know people who have lost limbs because they got tired of waiting for conditions to improve.  The choice of what to carry is the easy part; it is limited only by your budget and how heavy of a pack you can realistically carry all day long for a week.  Go gear: Food, water, communication, protection and sanitation for a short walk home.  Stay gear: All the above for a long stake-out in your vehicle. Also, double the fuel capacity of your vehicle with a bigger tank ($$$) or fuel cans that you keep full (less $ but unsafe in Summer). An economy car is best obviously, but we use what we have.  Go gear food: 1. MREs with heaters and heater water are best, but don't wait until D-Day to eat your first one. Buy a box or two (12-24) of mixed menu MREs, to find out which one you will eat and which one you will give away. They are self-contained, with cutlery, napkins, drink powder, etc. Amazon has good deals with free shipping. 2. Peanut butter: Only carry a jar of this if your route home offers unlimited access to fresh water. PB is great energy for a survival walk, but not if your only water is what you can carry. 3. Water: You will need water for two reasons: Drinking and sanitation. You must stay clean on your hands and in your mouth, or you will get sick, get stuck, and never get home. You will need one gallon per day, just for drinking. You will need another gallon per day, just for sanitation. We're up to 14 gallons, about 120 pounds of water. Guess what... you're not carrying that much. You will need to buy a personal water filter; something you can stick into a water source and suck on. Amazon has them. Do carry one gallon of water in your pack (8 pounds) for stretched between water sources. This will be the heaviest item in your pack. You must keep your water out of the car when not in use.  Stay gear food: 1. MREs are unneccessary, as real food in cans and jars is preferable. Your Jetboil or other fuel-based camp stove will be fine (crack the window). Can opener, disposable plates and utensils. Garbage bags. 2. Water: 14 gallons plus the gallon for your go-gear. This is a pain in the ass to remove and replace every day in the Summer or Winter. Maybe you have a garage to make this easier. In any case, keep the water in the cabin and not in the trunk.  Go gear protection: 1. You're on foot, so a pistol or two is all you can carry over the distance. 2. Carry concealed. By day three, people on your way home will be hungry, sleep-deprived and thirsty. Dangerous combination. People (who did not prepare) that you knew before will be unrecognizable by day three.   Stay gear protection: 1. Your rifle is fine but keep it hidden and be prepared to leave it behind, should conditions not improve after waiting a week (or when your fuel runs out). There is no need for an arsenal beyond a pistol and a rifle. Such a show of defense will only serve to get your vehicle charged, your weapons stolen and you done away with.  Go gear sanitation: 1. Plastic bags with draw strings to pick up after yourself and when nature calls #2. You will throw these out as you go. 2. Toilet paper: Duh. One roll. You won't be eating that much. 3. Lemon-scented baby wipes: Troops love these for the same reason and purpose. 4. Hand sanitizer: For quick hand work. 5. Waterless hand soap: Hand sanitizer is not soap. You need to scrub with something just like at home, so bring some o' this, and paper towels to dry. 6. Bottle of mouthwash (one with antiseptic qualities). Rinse your mouth with this three times a day. 7. Do not skimp on sanitation. It is not optional.  Stay gear sanitation: 1. Same as above, but add a five-gallon bucket with a toilet seat for #2. See Amazon for these.  Communication (same for go gear and stay gear): 1. Battery-powered radio with shortwave and a headphone jack. 2. Headphones. 3. Batteries still in their retail wrappers. 4. If you're a Ham radio guy, add whatever toys you want.  Sleep for go gear: 1. Pillow and rain cover.  Sleep for stay gear: 1. Pillow 2. Sleeping bag 3. Blanket 4. Teddy Bear  Other: The possibilities of your go gear and stay gear are limited only by your imagination and budget. Y2K gave us tons of things we did not have before, for just this occasion. Watch the weight, though, as you may find the fancy trinkets and gadgets getting left behind or stolen. My advice on these options is to leave them at home and focus on just getting home.  I cannot advise you on walking through the woods in order to get home, as that is not a part of my bug-out plan. Martial law will be imposed after an event so severe (natural or mankind-derived) that the military is called in to control the cities and interstates. Following a declaration of martial law, you will have a handful of days to get home, after which you will be stuck in CAMP. You don't want to go there. You should not wait to bug out. Get out of the city unless depending on government for your Top Ramen and toilet paper is your forte.  Spend the money and prep now. Rotate your supplies. Stack it deep. Semper Fi."

Two weeks is too many provisions to carry, so get fit or ripped.    Check out my post on this thread.  The kit I describe is about $260 and 12 lb dry weight.  A reasonably fit (not obese) person can do 15 miles walking at a casual pace from morning to evening with that weight, so I would call 31 miles a two day hike.  I'm speaking from experience.  I usually carry a little over 20 lb total on my backpacking trips and I'm well into middle age.  I do 15-ish miles in a day with moderate effort.    Based on Rule of Threes I think you may be overprepping food in your kit.  Water ration is 3 liters per day.  13.2 lb for two days.  So the kit I recommended is around 26 lb total.  Also you didn't mention a sleeping bag?"
preppers,3c3vqd,m_jean_m,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:25:15 2015 UTC,"Congrats on knowing your abilities. Most of us do not because we will not take the time to try it out to test reality. It seems that my level of fit is not the same as yours. I cannot carry a 30 lb (listed elements, plus pack) load 15 miles per day without being totally defenseless at the end of that day, which would defeat my purpose of getting home. 30 lbs plus a sleeping bag, for go-gear, is just too much for the average person.  Seriously, there is no way I would set out on a survival walk without a gallon of water in my pack. A survival walk is not a backpacking trip. I have no intention of making that trip more than once.  I am not interested in survival unless it is successful survival. And if I am so wiped out by the end of the day, I am defenseless.  Different people, physical conditions and training all vary one's performance under stresses. I just could not meet the performance requirement you laid out, and still be worth anything the next day or even that night."
preppers,3c3vqd,m_jean_m,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:33:08 2015 UTC,"there is no way I would set out on a survival walk without a gallon of water in my pack.    I recommended six liters (1.58 gallons, weight: 13.2 lb) for a two day walk to safety.  For backpacking I usually carry about 1.5 liters and I refill with my filter when I get to the lake or stream at my campsite (chosen to have water).  Of course you can't count on finding water in a survival situation, hence the six liters.  This is how I store water in my vehicle kit.  I rotate it out by using it at the gym and replacing with fresh bottles.  The corrugated bottles survive freezing solid in winter.   I just could not meet the performance requirement you laid out, and still be worth anything the next day or even that night.   You can probably cover more distance than you think.  If you walk from say 8 AM until 8 PM, 15 miles is 1.25 miles per hour.  The average human walking speed is 3.1 mph so 15 miles per day is actually less than half of normal stroll around the park speed.  Most modern people are not used to walking long distances as you say, but really you just put one foot in front of the other and the miles add up over the course of the day.  It's nothing like an ultra-marathon when you do it.  Humans are designed to be long distance traveling creatures.  The main thing in my experience is blisters, so moleskin is always the number one first aid item in my kit.  Plain old discount store running shoes are a miraculous invention when you're trying to eat up some miles without wrecking your feet.  Of course you walk slower with a pack, but in my experience as a slightly built middle aged man, 25 lb and under is so comfortable you will barely notice the pack unless you're climbing a steep hill.  You can feel 30 lb, but it's only moderately difficult.  40 lb+ will make you work.  That's why I always try to talk survivalists and preppers into deleting some of their axes, bowie knives, machetes, guns, big steel cookpots."

God forbid your in another snowstorm, being stuck in a metal icebox is not an ideal shelter situation. A tarp of some type is a basic option and make sure you have a extra pair of thermals, or what ever you have, for layering(I'm think for cold weather, you seem concerned for that). It sounds obvious but socks,gloves, and a beanie of some sort. Otherwise since you have the option to walk home you really don't need to deck out your card or long term survival. Make sure there's water, some mre type meals, and a way to get fire and  you should be good."

They want to stick with their system of bribery and paying everything in cash under the table. They want to keep on retiring from work earlier than other EU countries, even if they cannot afford it.   Also greece is an EU country and will allways be carried by the other EU countries if things get worse (which is part of the problem at the moment).  And always remember: When an EU country is complaining how awful everything is then it basically means that their living standards are still above those of the standards that maybe a third of the U.S. citizens suffer.

preppers,3bwhm5,HomeGrownFood,9,Thu Jul 2 18:49:49 2015 UTC,"Hi and thanks for doing the AMA.  It seems to me that, in general, edible gardens are an underused resource for healthy and affordable food (be it in a suburban or urban environments) and I’m excited to learn more.  I have two questions that are applicable to the 9-5er who finds prepping in competition for time with picking up the dry-cleaning, doing yard work, making doctors’ appointments, and other grinds of daily life.  1) What are some edibles that are easy to grow (resilient, low maintenance, grow in a wide variety of climates – New Jersey in this case), give a good yield, and are easy to prepare for consumption.  2) When it comes to taking effective measures against raccoon, squirrels, etc. what are your suggestions/ tips?"
preppers,3bwhm5,tyrannosean,11,Thu Jul 2 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"1) Gosh, there's a lot depending upon how much you want to invest initially. For example, you could drop $10k on an aquaponics setup that is more or less self-sustaining and only requires an hour or two each week.   Or, you could spend >$1k and build several garden beds with a self-watering system. Watering is the biggest maintenance process, so if you automate that process you might be in your garden only a few hours a week. Then, there's even methodologies of gardening that use less time than others, for example the Mittleider system is less time intensive than the Square Foot Garden system - but SFG is more sustainable.   Generally though, I encourage people to grow the food that they already eat. Do you eat carrots? Do you eat beets? What about tomatoes? Take a look at the list of vegies that you already eat - start right there - this will keep you enthusiastic and encourage you to keep it up. Expand to new vegies as you feel comfortable. The last thing I want to do is say “Squash is simple to grow”, then you plant some squash, get a huge harvest, and you never eat it. Really, most crops are very low maintenance if you keep them watered.   Otherwise, the lowest maintenance crop universally is probably Dandelions.  2) Depends upon what you’re ethically OK with. For example my preferred method doesn’t sit well with everyone. It’s most important to exclude those animals from your property – you can do this with fencing over and around your crops, you can do this with dogs and cats. For fencing, all of my garden beds have a hoop houses made from 1/2-inch PVC, when the pests become a problem I will put up barriers around the beds. I’ve never seen traps work, nor have I seen companion planting keeping away hungry squirrels. Really, the best thing to do is to introduce a predator like a dog or cat.  Otherwise, most of these critters will go for the easiest available food – so if you feed squirrels/raccoons all year long (including, especially through the winter) they’ll eventually stop digging up your garden. It doesn’t 100% solve the pest issue, but if you’re at your property for the next two decades, a combination of feeding the pests and occasionally exterminating them works. Consistently feed them and they’ll consistently leave your crops alone. You also then have the adorable benefit of fat squirrels to keep you (and your predator cat/dog) entertained."

preppers,3bwhm5,velacreations,9,Thu Jul 2 19:23:55 2015 UTC,"Great question! There's lots of ways to approach this question and a lot of philosophies on what ""sustain"" means and if you're relying on your neighbors and public spaces - there's lots and lots of considerations! For example, does ""sustain"" include animals and animal feed?   However, in general Mother Earth News has suggested time and time again that 1 acre per family is enough. I'm sure someone can track down their diagram, but basically it was some orchards, a dairy cow/goats, chickens & hogs, plus fields for grains, then about 50-100 feet of raised garden beds. Totally do-able.  But, this has enormous time-trade-offs. You could homestead on an acre and probably be just fine, but it's going to be a lot of work.  Meanwhile, if you even just have a small community of people to trade with you have significantly more capabilities through a division of labor. For example, one family raising 50 chickens, another family raising 12 goats, ect."

preppers,3bwhm5,Gravlox15,3,Fri Jul 3 01:48:45 2015 UTC,Can you talk about your business model and start up costs?
preppers,3bwhm5,Gravlox15,6,Thu Jul 2 22:31:09 2015 UTC,"Sure.  So, the model is pretty simple: Home Grown Food provides home and commercial garden services, these services include every element of gardening from construction to maintenance.   My start up costs were extremely low, but I also don’t push for a huge return. I’m waiting for the right business partners to really steam roll this project into the stratosphere. My biggest startup cost was a truck – then I pick up about $1.5k in consumable/operation supplies for the small projects. Otherwise, it’s just like any sort of contracting. If you have the tools you’re fine, my main tools are a level, saw, drill.   To keep costs low I go on several sales calls in one weekend, try to line up 3-4 construction projects, then order the supplies in bulk from my vendors. I do construction that next weekend.   For cheap labor I hire teenagers and train them on the whole process of running the business and how to do gardening. After the first day, if they’re interested in sticking around then I’ll give them a few books to read, show them how I find clients (primarily craigslist, local events, community groups), then I’ll refer clients to them to work independently. It’s a pretty agreeable system because my contractors can easily pull in $15 under the table (though, I’m sure they’re all paying their taxes!). For bigger projects (like commercial operations) I eventually plan to have a few team members as actual employees, but I haven’t yet had the need for that. I had a 17 year old I was working with last year, he was doing about 7-10 hours a weekend with a small handful of clients. With this skill under their belt, they’ll never spend another year unemployed, they’ll never go hungry, and it’s a great way to build communities. The communities that get built of this project are the best return.  The sky is really the limit, I have many ways to make this a very profitable organization, I just also have a very rewarding full time job that pays me more than enough to distract me from this project. I have a variety of diversified revenue models I plan to talk to an investor about, when the time is right and when I have the right partners.  Overall, it’s a very, very simple operation. If you want to get into it, just start by posting on Craigslist that you are willing to help people with their gardens."

For context, what I may like to do in the future is start a project where I am a permaculture design consultant. I could design the space then sub contract the work out. My question is how you validated the idea, on what scale did you start (family/friends) and what level of demand showed you that this was a required service in your area?"
preppers,3bwhm5,PabstyLoudmouth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:15:29 2015 UTC,"My question is how you validated the idea, on what scale did you start (family/friends) and what level of demand showed you that this was a required service in your area?   I sort of just jumped right in after thinking about it for too long. I started out as a landscaper doing volunteer work at community parks. After a few years I found myself volunteering at community gardens and ad hoc garden projects. The activists starting community gardens were missing basic knowledge about gardening, but wanted to do gardening projects, so I ended up helping folks more and more. I was also juggling equipment from craigslist, so when I found a free 55-galon drum or garden supplies, I'd take it and find a project to donate those supplies to. It also helps control the costs of my own gardening hobby through commercializing it.  As for demand, I just posted a few offers on craigslist to see the responses and it was pretty overwhelming. I learned really quick that driving across town wasn't economically viable, so I scaled down to working a small subsection of town only and have been fishing for partners in the community to help me cover other areas.  Finding leads is super easy between craigslist, attending community events, and referrals. Lots of referrals.    I am a permaculture design consultant   I originally thought about going that direction and have taken several PDCs in the past. The majority of my clients already have a vision of a garden in their head, either a raised garden bed or in-ground garden. When I first engage a customer I ask ""How long do you plan on living here?"" If their answer is more than 5-10 years then I talk with them about landscaping, but these projects are usually a lot more labor intensive and 95% of the people I've talked to want the simplest and lowest cost option. That's pretty reasonable in my opinion, as they're entry-level buyers. I have pitched building food forests to clients, but none of them were interested so far - raised garden beds at a low cost are an easy sell though."
preppers,3bwhm5,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Sat Jul 4 00:31:58 2015 UTC,How many seeds do you stock in your bug out supplies?
preppers,3bwhm5,UsaIvanDrago,4,Thu Jul 2 20:37:58 2015 UTC,"bug out supplies   None.  For one, my “bug out” supplies is limited to maybe 2-3 months on the road under the very very best conditions, the fastest edible crops one could establish would be beets and lettuce – both can start being harvested in about 30 days.   I have some pre-positioned in a second area that already has farming activity. My long term bug-out plan includes working that existing farm with volunteers into a sustainable commune, and that process would take a couple months on the agricultural side. Generally, a static seed bank is a silly thing to do. It's a much better practice to save seeds from your harvests each season and continue the cycle of growing food. My problem with static seed banks is that most people who buy them don’t know how to grow the seeds inside, they think you can just go from nothing to edible crops without fertilizer, equipment, or good soil. It was actually this revelation several years ago when I realized “Crap, I’ve got to grow food right now” that really inspired me to get deeper into gardening.   If you've got a seed bank, plant all of it this year, this weekend or as soon as possible. See how much you legitimately get out of it, and reevaluate in October if you want to buy another one."

preppers,3bwhm5,FunkyTreasureHunter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:45:11 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily - you should have seeds from last year's harvest still. So, if my garden was destroyed I would still have enough seed to replant. You shouldn't plant all of the seeds you save."
preppers,3bwhm5,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Sat Jul 4 00:10:27 2015 UTC,"Why do you suggest that people have raised beds, in my experience they just cost more money and require you to water much more often."
preppers,3bwhm5,FunkyTreasureHunter,3,Thu Jul 2 20:56:44 2015 UTC,"Raised beds have lots and lots of benefits. It's true that there is an additional upfront investment, but that investment has returns. I've worked on raised bed projects that were zero cost: left over wood donated from a construction site, donated compost mixed with sand and native soil.  It's true that you can do most things in the ground that you can do in raised beds, but raised beds make some things a lot easier. Perfect example of this is controlling the soil. You dig a 4x8 hole and fill it with Mels Mix and do the Square Foot Garden method in the ground, but it would be a lot more work. Traditional row gardening is best when people have lots and lots of space to work with. My clients are in residential areas with less than an acre of useable space and often much less than that. Using the Square Foot Garden method the raised beds are only 6 inches deep, so all of your plants are using the native soil under them.   To raddle off a couple more benefits of raised beds: the space is optimized and contained, people can’t accidently walk on your crops, the soil warms up faster, it’s easier to install hoop houses, taller beds are easier to work on…. I could keep going, there’s a lot. I haven’t seen a difference in how much water has to be applied.  I’ve met lots of people who think growing in soil is inefficient, and I tend to agree – the most efficient systems tend to be hydroponic.   Hope that helps!"

I can't see the square foot method delivering very good results either, most tomatoes need minimum of 24"" apart (36"" is more ideal). Doing it your way would come to about 1/4 the yield due to overcrowding. I get that it gets people into gardening but it the square foot method is not something that should be taught to preppers. I do appreciate you teaching people about gardening though."

I've only met one other person in my area who grows larger tomato bushes than me, and it's my partner who owns a hydroponic shop. It’s my belief that proper pruning and nutrients is the secret to tomatoes, not necessarily spacing.

Edward Griffin, who at that time was a member of the John Birch Society, an anticommunist group. In the interview, Bezmenov explained the methods used by the KGB for the gradual subversion of the political system of the United States.[4]   I don't agree with this guy at all. Everyone commenting so far has agreed that this is a good find. So why don't you say what parts you agree with and why? What specifically do you believe he is referencing when he says this, for example?   1:14:09  ""And you can see it quite clearly in some areas, in such sensitive areas such as defense and economy the influence of marxist/leninist ideas in the united states is absolutely fantastic. i could never believe it 14 years ago when I landed in this part of the world that the process will go that fast.""  ok, so what happened between 1970 and 1984 in the areas of defense and economy? What marxist/leninist influence occurred in the pentagon and economy during this time, which sent America careening towards imminent communist take-over? He repeatedly emphasizes that a communist takeover of America is imminent and that it will happen all over the world.   ""what actually happens now, that unlike myself, you have literally several years to live on unless the united states wake up. the time bomb is ticking. the time bomb is ticking. with every second the disaster is coming closer. unlike myself you will have no where to defect to.""  That was 31 years ago. He claims in this video that the USA is imminently about to turn into a communist country where everyone will be as oppressed as people were in the Soviet Union, gulags will be set up in Alaska for capitalists to be exiled to, and anyone who uses freedom of speech to express dissent will be killed by the government. He even specifically singles out homosexuals, saying that there will be a horribly oppressive crackdown on homosexuals once the new communist government takes over America, which is very funny in light of recent news. This guy is wrong about everything, why are you all agreeing with him? There are tons of countries all over the world which for 50 years have been further left on the political spectrum than America is and they haven't turned into soviet-style prison states yet."

Even on very cloudy days it chargers but of course much much slower. I wouldn't want anything less than 7-9watts. If your plan is to leave it out in the sun all day 5-7 watts will be fine. If you are like me and want sufficient charging in a couple hours when fishing or sunbathing, I would say 9 watts is the minimum.  edit: remember this formula; P=I*V. P is power is wattage, I is current in amps, and V is voltage in volts. All phones charge at 5 volts. Power is the maximum wattage your solar charger claims to provide. Solve this equation for I in amps and you'll have an idea of how fast you can charge. As a reference the slowest wall chargers charge at 1.0 or 1.5 amps, I forget. The fastest possible chargers charge at 2.1 amps. No phone takes more than 2.1 amps. Therefore a solar charger that can provide more than this isn't going to charge any faster than 2.1 amps, with the exception of a cloudy day when a smaller solar charger won't reach its peak power."

preppers,3bsv9r,hiddenkiwi,4,Wed Jul 1 21:39:18 2015 UTC,"At one time we lived on the very edge of the ten mile evacuation zone of a nuclear plant.   Each year the power plant sent out a spiral bound wall calendar that contained all of the emergency instructions should there be an alarm sounded. If an evacuation order was given, there were 2 signs incorporated into the calendar that were to be used. If you were evacuated or sheltered as instructed, you placed the bright yellow sign in the window that said ""We Are Okay."" There was also a space to write your cell phone number.  There was also a bright orange sign that said ""Need Assistance."" The signs were to be placed in your front window. It allowed for a quick assessment of where help was needed.   What you may want to do in advance is contact your local police station and see if they maintain an emergency contact file for residents. Many do. Give them your cell phone number and the name and number of an alternate contact who will know how to reach you. They typically use this file if there is an emergency at your address when no one is home. This would allow them to contact you if there was concern about your well-being without advertising that you are already gone.   The alternative would be to post a note that says something like - ""Attention Neighbors, We Are Okay. To reach us, call or text xxx-xxx-xxxx.

The best point of this list is that the events to prepare for aren't hypothetical, they are historical. And recent history, at that. So, anyone should be prepared at least for these things, they aren't 'zombies', they are real disruptions that people already experienced and lived (or died) in."

For example, if Russia and China were to return to the gold standard our paper would seem silly. That's why I hold gold and silver. The problem with gold and silver is that you can't use it to transact electronically. Bitcoin is limited in supply like gold, cannot be counterfeited unlike cash, and cannot be confiscated by a government unlike gold."

If you look at Venezuela as an example, their fiat is facing horrible amounts of inflation, but their internet is still working, their cellphones still work. Had some of those venezuelan people purchased bitcoin, they would come out after the collapse just fine.   Also, with financial collapse comes bank account confiscation. Another reason why a cryptographically protected currency is good.  If you keep your money in cash, you're subject to many security failures. Also, If there is a fire you're fucked. The security problems those companies had (Mt. gox) were either due to incompetence, or it was an inside job. The people who lost money on Mt. Gox should never have trusted their bitcoin with them. Those people left their money on an exchange, it wasn't a bank. If you keep your private keys it's very easy to secure them to the point that the NSA couldn't even touch them."

Depends on where you're at and soil content too.  Best thing if you live in an area with sandy soil or a very clay like soil is do raised beds and get top soil in bulk.  If you have good dark soil then you may want to get a soil tester and test the nitrate and mineral levels of the soil because you might need to use some sort of fertilizer to get yourself started.  Prep wise you won't always want to depend on fertilizer so make sure and start a compost heap to add to your garden soil every spring when you till to add nutrients back into the soil.

Add compost to all 3, then when I am ready to grow in the one big pot I have room for I took the soil from one bin and used it for the pot and keep putting compost in the other two. When this plant gets harvested, I'll put the dirt back in a bin, then use the dirt from the next bin for my next plant.

It's usually recommended that it be stored in a freezer because of this. The shelf life wouldn't be particularly remarkable. But the same problems arise with whole wheat because the most nutritious part of the wheat, the germ, will go rancid fairly quickly. Hardtack only became popular for its shelf life due to the advance of white or bleached wheat, which is devoid of the germ and treated to be shelf stable. Then it is fortified to be of some nutritional value. If fat and protein are your main issues, just make pummican in addition to your hardtack.

preppers,3bjchv,Tinman1911,0,Tue Jun 30 05:12:24 2015 UTC,"GPS (and the other orbital positioning systems) are 100% reliant on ground stations to keep them in sync. Those ground stations keep their internal atomic clocks accurate, which rapidly fall apart because of temporal dilation. Aparently they are synchronised every day, and would become wildly inaccurate shortly afterwards.  So if something happened to the ground stations, those GPS systems would fall over."
preppers,3bjchv,34Mbit,4,Mon Jun 29 21:21:16 2015 UTC,"Okay listen up cupcakes, the GPS systems will likely be one of the last things to fail completely.  Schriever and the related groundstations are a major part of the air force infrastructure full of professionals who take their jobs seriously.  The EMP/solar event risks will have been well modeled and it dosen't take much thought to realize significant resources will be spent keeping these assets running.  DOD wrote the book about layered redudancy, otherwise known as defense in depth. Additonaly, most newer GPS systems out there now also have GLONASS capability allowing the average consumer to add another system backed up by another major power.  Now, with that said, all systems can and will fail over time.  In the case of a systemic failure of the GPS system I suspect most people will be done with major movements and settling into a local area around the time it gives out.  The failure will likely manifest itself by reduced accuracy first then a drop in the number of active GPS birds overhead at any given time.  This means you will get a fix but it will be less accurate and/or take more time.  For me, I run with a good GPS and try and have paper topos and a compass around for fun, practice and redundacy.  Really, the problem I see most people having is a lack of proper maps to pair with the GPS.  Take the time to learn how to plot a coordinate fix on a paper map and and keep a good selection of digital topos on your device and you'll be well on your way.    Knowing exactly where you are is only step one.  The rest of the story is knowing how that location relates to your task at hand.  Does it make sense to keep trying for the summit?  You may think you can see it just over the ridge but not realize it's much further than you thought and it would take much more energy to get to it than you want to spend.  This goes to my last shoutout to paper maps.  GPS screens are tiny and I find it harder to develop my own awareness of my location in relation to what I see around me off a small screen.  /rant.  Please try and keep reality in mind a bit while modeling bad things.  Don't throw out a tool just because it may fail."

Banks are closed, but currency exchange outlets (like Western Union) are open and operate normally. I can't say what percentage of ATMs are out of money, but at least restocking goes on, albeit at a slow rate. I saw queues ranging from 3-4 up to like  50 people, most pensioners/elderly people. There was a gasoline run yesterday too, so some gas stations are out of regular, serving only the expensive 98-100 oktan stuff.

Lots of people hoarding foodstuffs, bigger than usual queues at the supermarkets, but no shortages. Public transport is free until the referendum takes place. Toll roads too. Cell operators are forbidden to disconnect people due to unpaid fees, as are public utilities such as power and water. In general, a big segment of the economy is in a frozen state right now.  As for my preps, none used so far. Remember, as bad as it sounds, Greece has seen worse. When we had those protracted general strikes some years ago we ran out of lots of basic stuff, like dairy products (procused mainly in northern Greece), gasoline etc. Things will get bad IF we get out of the Euro, the transitional period to the new currency will be hell, I'm really looking forward to it :)  As for my own preps, no I haven't used anything yet, but I will add some gas to the pile, got me 8x20 lt cans today."

preppers,3bk1ji,snipun,-1,Mon Jun 29 21:57:04 2015 UTC,"What? 1,000 liters is about 265 gallons of water. Even if I was using it for my entire daily water intake it would last far longer than a month... according to the manufacturer it is designed for a year of use.

I still like it because it is super bare-bones and has no pumps or moving parts or anything that can really break. As long as you can suck on it, you can filter water.

My flat is higher than the surrounding buildings and I can see ""over the parapet"" of the roof of a nearby office block.  If anyone was moving around on that roof I would have to regard it as a potential threat. It is the only location that threatens my building. In an extreme breakdown of society I intend to send a couple of fire-arrows over the parapet to eliminate the threat.  Currently, I am able to use the rainwater puddles and evaporation rates on the roof to judge the soil conditions in my gardens which are a couple of miles away.  There is a shopping Mall about a mile away. The reflected sunlight from the roof fittings is enough to cause retina burn when looking out of my kitchen window in the evenings but it also triggers my solar panels to make electricity even though the sun is around the wrong side of the building, so I don't mind so much."

My post suffered from a late edit where I changed the sentence order which makes it seem more more aggressive than I meant.  I would not respond aggressively in a situation where no threat was forthcoming. However I am aware that the roof of a nearby office block offers a vantage point that threatens not only my home but homes across the neighbourhood.  In an extreme collapse of society, with destruction of property rife in the built up city where I live I would be prepared to use fire arrows to remove the threat that exists from this one building. I would not destroy a building that was peacefully occupied nor harm the people in it but I think it would be wise to monitor their activities and have a planned response to any threat."

Keep a cheap folder in your pocket for day to day work? Sure. If it breaks or you loose it no big deal, just pick up another. As for a tool that I could be trusting my life to? No way. These days Gerber knives are not designed to take a beating like that. A good knife should be a ""buy it once"" kind of purchase and for that you might need to shell out a few more bucks which, in my humble opinion, is worth it. Don't get me wrong though and think you need to run out and pick up a thousand dollar custom forged knife because there are inexpensive brands that can hold their salt, Mora for example."

However, I have noticed that Gerber products, for most models, are made to be very cheap. Price is not everything. But, for some tools you can end up spending a lot of money. Or, the exact opposite......  A good example: Gerber machetes have been known to break (Bear Grylls models), and are $35+. But Tramontina machetes will last you a life time. They are dirt cheap, and give fantastic results. Been using them for 10+ years. My father has been using them for double that. Though, be warned, the plastic handled models are not full tang. I do not know why, but that is how they make them."

I've been using these for everything now.  They are much more stable and much better at extreme temperatures.

Another interesting point is that it is very hard for a person who is out of adolescence to gain muscle without a lot of protein and extra calories, which aren't exactly hard to get now, but post-shtf they might be.  However it's much easier to gain back muscle that you have lost.  We're designed to bounce back very fast after a hard winter.

Each piece of paper explains what I need to grab depending upon how much time I have. The first sheet says “10 minutes” so if I have 10 minutes this is what I’m getting. The next sheet says “30 minutes”, and I grab all of the stuff on the my 10 minute list, and it takes me 20 more minutes to grab this stuff. My last sheet says “1 hour”, and it’s 30 more minutes of stuff I’ll load into my truck. The problem with a bug out bag is that you don’t take care of the stuff inside. Medication and food goes bad, batteries die, and you don’t take care of it.   I sort of have a list like that too, but just in my mind. Basically I have a few kits that are already preassembled.   In my bedroom:   Bugout bag Rifle, vest, ammo sling. (depending upon situation) Gas mask and decontamination kit (depending upon situation) Silver/cash/more guns/ammo containers EDC backpack (contains laptop, chargers, IFAK, ect.) Gym bag (extra changes of clothing, redundant to the bug out bag, but hey: more clothing the better)   In the garage:   Mountain House Just-In-Case containers Water bricks Food kit (this is a cooler where I store my colemen single-burner stove that runs on propane, 4 propane tanks, it also has paper plates/bowls, kettle, utensils, cups, a pot and pan.)

(And those are either shit or overly expensive.) or keep your eye on the device you are charging as most will stop charging when the supplied amperage drops.

Generally recommended are fixed-blade knives with full-length tangs (the steel from the blade continues down to the end of the handle). Folding knives or knives where the tang extends just a little way into the handle can more easily fail where the blade connects to the handle. (Mora knives are not full-tang, however they have a pretty good track record so remain popular. Mora owners would probably want to use some other knife, however, for any serious batoning.)  Becker, Cold Steel, ESEE, Gerber, and Ka-Bar are all reputable brands, but even a well-conceived home-made knife ground out of an old axle spring can be a good choice.   I actually prefer cheaper knives (like the Moraknivs) because I have multiple kits where knives are bought, stored, and forgotten. I'll spend more for my EDC."
preppers,3arpae,edheler,2,Tue Jun 23 22:16:21 2015 UTC,My two choices are a KA-BAR and a Gerber LMF-II. You can certainly spend more but this is an area where redundancy may be more useful.

preppers,3arpae,blippityblip,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:34:44 2015 UTC,"avoid the hollow handle ones, as the others have said.  Best case scenario with those is that the blade is welded on by a blind chinese prisoner.  Worst case is that they're simply held on with a nut (the ""tang"" of the knife has been machined to be threaded).  I'd call them not reliable at all - they will fail early and no knife failure is a good failure.  some of the things you're looking for are:   full tang fairly thick blade working length - most field knives operate in the 3"" to 6"" blade.  shorter, thinner knives might not have the beefcake you need, bigger heavier hunks of steel become unwieldy for a lot of close small tasks. how to carry your 'survival kit' - in short - as you get more experience, you'll likely find that your kit becomes detached from your knife.  You'll see sheaths with a spare storage container on it, on some higher end sheaths.  I won't knock it at all - I've DIY'd some sheath/survival kit combo's.    I think it's simply a matter of what works on a personal level, and where you're stashing other parts of your gear.  If you're in the field and you've got a fanny-pack survival belt - then maybe you don't need one on the knife.  but if you've got that knife on your calf during a river trip, and your main gear kit is likely to go overboard - it might be smart to have something there.   Just don't sacrifficce the quality of the knife just to hold more gear.  do some window shopping on the internet.  look at companies like Ontario Knife Company and ESEE (and there are scads more of solid, mid-range, mid-price knives out there - $100 is plenty good many solid knives).   Don't buy from the manufacturer website - too expensive.  shop it around, you'll find retailers selling it at good prices.    As far as sheaths go - if you want to set your fantasy's burning, and you want to put together a wishlist - look into things like Hedgehog Leatherworks and DIY'ing your own kydex sheath, or making one up with pvc."

preppers,3aprp7,madinetebron,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:01:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm sure it works just fine. $350 is an insane price to pay for a solar cooker, though, when you can make one with left over parts, or even new parts from Home Depot for, at most, $150-ish. It's a simple box solar oven with some extra reflectors on it.  One thing that's always kept me away from the Preppers movement, even when I agree with the overall need for preparation (just as a matter of course -- not even for disaster situations necessarily), is how quick these little shops and businesses pop up and sell things that can be fashioned pretty cheaply, for an exorbitant amount of money. Food, filters, gear, and on. This is a prime example.  If it works for you and you got cash to waste, then go for it. I'd be the last person to stop you. I was just pointing out that no solar oven is worth $350. That's a good chunk of change for something that can be built quickly and for much cheaper."
preppers,3aprp7,rednoise,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:16:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but how sturdy is your ""spare parts"" cooker? How hot does it get? Everything I've researched, shows that those DIY ones don't get near hot enough for what I want. I cook all my families food from scratch, including our breads. I need a solar oven that works hard, not some cardboard covered aluminum foil box.  And this company has been around for 28 years, they are hardly a pop up."
preppers,3aprp7,madinetebron,0,Sun Jun 28 01:42:35 2015 UTC,"It was very sturdy. I built it myself, with good wood that I salvaged, and made sure that it was sturdy. It was not a ""cardboard covered aluminum foil box."" If it were, I wouldn't have had to spend any money. Mine got up to about 250 degrees, but I know why that was and it's intentional. It's because there's one reflector on it. The solar oven you bought has four reflectors on it, which allows more light to be reflected into the box, thus created more heat energy within the box. If I wanted to, I could have tacked on three more reflectors to the one I built to get it up to 400*, for not that much money.   And this company has been around for 28 years, they are hardly a pop up.   Well, then it sucks that they've been ripping people off for 28 years and people have allowed them to do that."

Regardless of what type of bag (military surplus, sea to summit, or wally world brand) you use it will eventually leak and or be found by rodents either of which will destroy your cached supplies.

I don't ...good news is that I am able to write again after being down for well over a year and the tumor is getting smaller. So if you what around ...hmmm about one more year...my grammar may meet your standards. Sorry that it is so bad that you felt the need to put it in writing.

preppers,3akei1,adoptagreyhound,3,Sun Jun 21 03:33:17 2015 UTC,"We moved last year about 2400 miles. We used up most of our stored food in the months before the move, and donated what was left to a community food bank.   When you use a mover, weight is what costs the big money, so the more weight you can take out of the move, the less costly the move. Also remember that moving vans get very hot, so anything that will be affected  by heat should either be dispositioned or moved in a manner where you can control it's storage.   I was able to put things like 5 gallon food buckets and water storage containers (all empty) into tall wardrobe boxes to move them Made it much easier than moving them in small boxes.   You may want to store much of your prep stuff in Rubbermaid tubs to keep it organized and easy to move. When moving time comes, drill a hole in each lid and zip tie it to the tub. It eliminates a lot of packing."

preppers,3akei1,di1uted,2,Sun Jun 21 13:37:47 2015 UTC,one of the big advantages of prep supplies is the storage method .... everything for long term storage should be packed that would be uber great for moving ... heavy duty and sealed to the environment containers .... if you are using just $5 Wally World plastic totes - you aren't serious about your prepping ....   moving that often .... buy a box trailer or a full time BOV van/truck - load it up .... find a secure storage location close to your new domain ...

Then calculate total energy required for its running 24/7 on your preferred settings, with all peripherals, even the ones you only use periodically.

As you well know your two key requirements are power and connectivity - once you have all the basic living stuff covered of-course (ramen noodles does not a good prepper make :)  I lived on a boat for a year in Australia the sun was plentafil but I never had enough energy. For you I would look for a good river that you can put a turbine in 24/7 power.. it is always on rain or shine.. rain all the better.   Go for a low power lap top they have been designed to consume nothing.. or as realeyesrealize mentioned you can find specialized machines that are low power. Go for solid state hard drives, and skip any fancy video cards if you don't need them.   Even if you get the power sorted. Connectivity is going to suck the dollars out of your back pocket. You mentioned satellite is out of the question due to cost and I agree. Perhaps you can move to a place where some one has good wifi and come to an agreement on a co-share.   I know your not talking SHTF or other crazy scenarios that this sub normally deals with so expect you are going to be able to continue working on Web 3.0 once the asteroid EMP's the bla bla.

preppers,3ahsvv,danfsullivan,2,Sat Jun 20 08:33:25 2015 UTC,"As a seamstress I approve of this. I sew, a lot. That includes a lot of mending and last minute fixes. A lot of the small kits you can buy are either carrying too much of something you don't NEED or not enough of what you do NEED.   While those little metal needle threaders you find in kits are nice They aren't necessary. What is necessary, especially if you don't want to replace the kit each and every use - is enough thread to really get the job done. Whatever that job may be. A lot of small ready to buy kits will only have a teeny tiny amount of thread. Sometimes kits sold just for buttons will have several needles, pre threaded with just a few feet of many different colors of thread. Not necessary. And not nearly as useful in the long run.   As a seamstress I do tend to add a few bits and bobs to my sewing kits that aren't necsarry, especially not for survival. I like my small foldable scissors. But not at all necessary, especially when everyone should have a knife of some sort anyway.   My barest of bare bones kit I made for my husband that still has enough to get the job done for  many, many, many uses - is very very similar to this. While the felt is not necessary (you can put the needles just through the thread on the card) it is nice and will help keep your needles clean and handy. Felt (originally wool scraps) has been used in this capacity for years and years and years. You can find 18th Century era (and probably earlier) sewing kits with needles handily tucked into a felt piece. It's a sold idea.   TL;DR - Seamstress approved."

preppers,3aea50,edheler,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"But if the tool doesn't do the job well then what kind of trade off is it? How much weight are you really saving by having a screwdriver with two bits and a pliers? Do you really need that can opener, why do you have cans in your BOB? is a two and half inch file really going to do anything for you? You save a few ounces at the expense of poor tools."
preppers,3aea50,monet108,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"FWIW, I agree.  Multi-tools are completely worthless unless you need a crappy pair of pliers or a blade with an unreliable lock.  I guess that I would argue that if you actually need quality tools, then you are probably at your house or BOL, in which case weight isn't an issue because you probably have a workspace there where you can just leave your tools.  If you are on the run then you probably aren't building things, and are better off with an axe or boltcutters or crowbar or masterkey solution for your weapon.  So in either case, the multi-tool is kinda stupid.  And in case any one tries responding asking me how I'm going to open cans of food, try opening a can of food with any knife or even the handle of a spoon.  with minimal practice cans can be opened with almost anything steel.

preppers,3aea50,44Dave,4,Sat Jun 20 02:55:34 2015 UTC,The thing is you have to see the trade offs. If you are going to be using a tool day and day out then you want it to be specifically built for the task you need it for. Think of it this way for instance. While a machete has many uses and can be argued that it is more multi functional than an axe. If your main use with the tool is to chop firewood all day then I would use the axe since it is specifically designed for that job.  I would carry a good solid knife. A folding saw like a bacho laplander and a gransfors bruks small forest axe. Unless you are bugging out to a specific place with all of those things already there. Then I would carry a small hatchet instead.

Not only is it a comparison of cheap radios, but it's not even the modern radios, as the UV-5R isn't their latest model. Where's the discussion on practical useable range, and encryption capabilities? What if you want to listen in on police and emergency channels, which is a very useful thing in emergencies?  In my testing, as an example, the maximum useable distance for the UV-5r is about a mile in an urban space. It's also important to note that all of these radios are currently being used by militia forces on both sides in both Ukraine and Syria – so from a real world tactical perspective there’s lots of lessons learned and none of those lessons are conveyed in this article. For example: the radios are prone to jamming, eves dropping, and triangulation. If you’re looking for radios for a militia team, it’s important to note these problems."
preppers,3ab807,fidelitypdx,5,Thu Jun 18 22:47:28 2015 UTC,"All commercial and amateur two-way radios are subject to jamming,  eavesdropping, and triangulation."
preppers,3ab807,InTherapy,2,Fri Jun 19 01:32:24 2015 UTC,"That's true, even military radios are susceptible to the same, but some much more so than others. For example, if you have a radio that can only operate in specific frequency ranges, it becomes much easier to monitor/jam those frequencies and triangulate the operators. This is especially true if you're dealing with low-power radios that have very limited ranges, because if you're eavesdropping on a guy running a Baofeng, you know he's within a mile, and he can probably hear your gunshots. If you have an adversary with a high end radio, they could be 10 miles away from your position, you don't know."
preppers,3ab807,fidelitypdx,3,Fri Jun 19 02:15:33 2015 UTC,"All radios operate in specific frequency ranges granted the FRS/GMRS type radios have only a specifically defined set of frequencies (channels) they can transmit on which makes it easier to monitor.  The problem with most ""communication guides"" is that the enforce the ""channel"" mentality.  Channels are not a requirement for operating any UVR-? or any of it's derivatives with proper licensing (ham technician) you can use the entire allotted 146-148MHZ for FM voice.  If that seems like a small range I can assure you it's not. Nor is it a trivial matter to scan that chunk of frequency for intermittent signals that may hop from one predefined frequency to another at predefined intervals.  (can it be done yes, but not easily without a firm understanding of radio operation)  As to jamming there are many things that can be done to help alleviate that problem.  Highly directional antennas like yagi or cubical quads and altering your signal's polarization can have a huge impact on how successful or unsuccessful a jamming attempt is against your communications.  Altering the path your communications take can also help.  Using terrain and how it affects radio propagation with a directional antenna is a simple method of hindering triangulation as well.  By reflecting a signal off of a large building or nearby mountain you can hinder the efforts to triangulate your position by ""appearing"" to be transmitting from one direction when you are actually transmitting in the other.  All these things and much more can be learned by joining an active ham club and getting licensed.  Fox hunts (radio triangulation contests) are great fun and teach you how to ""read"" the local terrain in relation to radio propagation."

preppers,3ab807,InTherapy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"You can make some guesses using triangulation and surveillance. For example, you hear radio communication from your adversary, you radio that intel to HQ, HQ then radios other nearby positions to monitor that frequency. Can other receivers also pick up the signal? Is it stronger or weaker for them?  Plus, you can theorize what quality of radios they're using based upon the sophistication of your adversary. If it's a group on unencrypted channels, it's probably a militia. It's probably a militia if they have terrible radio discipline and chitchat too much. If they use frequency-hopping you're dealing with a more sophisticated adversary, perhaps someone who has access to commercial or law-enforcement grade gear. Does your adversary transmit data with a software defined radio?   There's a lot of questions to ask in order to make some assumptions. Certainly they could be running a Baofeng with an amplifier - you never know."

But that’s no longer normal. If we extrapolate it back, we can see that my father’s generation knew even more – and my grandparent’s generation even more.   Not exactly true where cars are concerned. Cars are much more complicated than they used to be, the author's grandparents would never be able to fix today's cars.   But the overall idea of learning basic skills is a good one.    6) The Ability to Generate Electricity    For the long-term, this seems like a waste of time and personal calories, time that could be spent learning how to go without electricity in the first place."
preppers,3a6bu2,crankypants15,5,Thu Jun 18 10:01:00 2015 UTC,"Not to be a jerk, but I totally disagree with you on the electricity point. Taking the time now to understand how to salvage electrical components and build any variety of power generation will save you countless calories in the long run. It's far from number 1 on your list of survival priorities, but there's no question that having electricity makes life much easier in a variety of ways."

preppers,3a6bu2,crankypants15,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, good LED lights will last decades, and lighting is an incredibly good use for electricity.  Even a small amount of available electricity for lights or a radio makes a gigantic difference.  30 watt-hours per day (the equivalent of 15 minutes of light physical activity) would be enough to keep LED task lighting lit to extend the available hours in the day for performing indoor tasks or even just reading.  Where I live, the day is only 8 hours and 50 minutes long on the winter solstice.  And of course the light is poor for the first and last half hour.  Even if you're working hard and need 10 hours sleep, you have 14 hours a day, but only 8 hours of light. artificial light means that tasks like cooking, repairing clothing and tools, etc can take place in the extra ~30% of the day (in the winter) that artificial light gives you.  I have no idea where one would buy a quality wind up flashlight, but it seems to me like in a shtf scenario such a thing would be one of the most valuable tools you could have."

preppers,3a6bu2,throwaway2arguewith,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:41:03 2015 UTC,I strongly disagree that these are lost skills. They are just not skills most people value and so they don't bother to learn them. I was competent at 12 of your 17 by my mid 20s (We millennials are so lazy don't ya know). I have also practiced distillation in Chem lab but am not about to perfect that skill as it is highly illegal. If you want to learn these skills your local college should have extension classes that cover most of them. My college even taught driving a draft team.

preppers,3a6bu2,ArMcK,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:37:26 2015 UTC,"Federal law states that it is legal to own a still of any size. It doesn't matter if you have a 1 gallon still or a 100 gallon still. According to the feds, it is legal to have a still for decoration, distilling water, distilling essential oils, etc. The still does not need to be registered with anyone and no permits are needed as long as it is being used for the aforementioned purposes. However, be advised it is illegal to distill alcohol without having either a ""distilled spirits permit"" or a ""federal fuel alcohol permit."" It does not matter if the alcohol is for personal use only, not for sale, etc.  As a wine maker I would be all over this if it were legal for personal consumption. Having watched a DEA raid and having little kids in the house there is no way in hell I would ever mess with the ""If you get caught stuff"".

I have a pitcher pump on a 110 foot deep well with the static level at 21'.   You can get it primed and pump water, but it is hard.  Filling a 5 gallon bucket will leave you exhausted.     If you run a 20 foot, 1 1/4"" pipe down, you will probably need to seal the top with an airtight seal.  If you don't, you will likely pull that 13 level down to 20' and start sucking air.  No way to know how easily the water will pull from the bottom, it might work without the seal.  Or you could put the 1 1/4 down further.

Of course onine, if you don't spend $400 on a deep well pump then you    If you run a 20 foot, 1 1/4"" pipe down, you will probably need to seal the top with an airtight seal.

Or you could put the 1 1/4 down further.    So what you are saying is that I should put an airtight seal on the 6 inch pipe? Otherwise, I could lower the water level from 13 feet down to the end of the pipe, at which point it obviously won't work since the pipe is no longer in the water? So something like this? How does getting an airtight seal prevent me from lowering the water level? (Edit: Nevermind, I understand what you are saying now. With an airtight seal, it would pull water all the way from the bottom of the 6 inch pipe instead of waiting for the 6 inch pipe to refill naturally. I just had to think about it for a minute.) Sorry for all the question, but I appreciate your help.   As far as priming, it doesn't take filling the whole pipe with prime water, only needs a few cupfuls to make the valve and leather cup seal in the pump to work. Very easy with a hand pump.   Okay, so I'm not filling the pipes but simply getting the leather wet to the point that it seals? That sounds much easier. Sucking that first 13 feet of air doesn't hurt the pump and the water will eventually follow as long as I keep the seals moist? That sounds much better than I was imagining.  Thanks again for the help."

preppers,3a7gso,kylej135,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:08:20 2015 UTC,"I have thought about this myself, but wonder if you would be able to work the pump in freezing weather the 2nd time you use it, due to what little water is in the pump section freezing. You could build an insulated box to put over it and maybe the heat coming out of the ground will keep it from freezing. After thinking about it, a 12 volt submersible pump might do the trick but then there is the power source problem if you can't come up 12 volts, but if that is not a problem you could easily pull it out and store it in the house to keep it from freezing. I thought maybe something like this http://www.amazon.com/Docooler-Diesel-Transfer-Submersible-Stainless/dp/B00F2LANF4/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&qid=1434578665&sr=8-15&keywords=12v+dc+water+pump or this http://www.amazon.com/Ranch-Submersible-Battery-Alternate-Energy/dp/B00F0JDHWO/ref=pd_sim_60_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0PJADSN97YTDJVNJ9873"
preppers,3a7gso,adoptagreyhound,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:21:36 2015 UTC,"That's a common problem, but it also has a common solution from what I've been reading. You have to keep a bucket of water available for priming anyway. The solution to the freezing problem is to just keep a small cup or so inside where it is warmer, and pour that on the leather before using. Evidently, they usually only get a small layer of ice, and this is enough to free it up. It supposedly doesn't have to be hot water, just warm."
preppers,3a7gso,klendathu666,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:25:52 2015 UTC,"We had a 20 foot deep, hand-dug well as our water source at the house where I grew up. While not the same setup you describe, we always kept a 150 watt floodlight burning in the pump pit to keep the pipes from freezing in the winter. You might consider hanging a flood bulb part-way down in a waterproof fixture to keep some radiant heat around the pipe, and insulating the well cover. A flood bulb generates a fantastic amount of heat in a small space of this type and may deter freezing in all but the most extreme temps.   A heat tape may be another option - as you could install one of the plugs that kicks power on when temps hit freezing, but turns it off when temps go above freezing. As long as the fixture is secure and connections are sealed, you should be fine. I know that local farmers where I grew up always had similar setups in the winter."
preppers,3a6iwq,OllyOlly_OxenFree,4,Wed Jun 17 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"Ooh, this is fun. Going way back. This is coming from a major natural disaster perspective, not a total collapse of society perspective.  When I went to university, I had some very general emergency preparedness going on. I live in an earthquake area, so we had water stored in the dorm room, foods that can be eaten without preparation (handy in general), and the like. It was just a very standard emergency kit appropriate for the most likely disasters (earthquakes, wildfire).   We had a SHTF plan (dad drives to pick up, or we meet up in a predetermined rural location, since I had a car), but that was about it. Talk to your family about where to meet you in case of an emergency/disaster. Know how to get there without a map, and will you walk? Bike? Good walking shoes are key, in any case. If you want to get real serious, figure out how to walk home while staying off major roads AND avoiding trespassing too close to people's homes. Consider making your SHTF bag a ""get home bag."" Bugging out to HOME is probably your best bet. Anyway, your bags shouldn't look too tactical, I hear. It could advertise that you're a person to target for resources.     I do wish I had had a minimal amount of camping stuff, but never ended up needing it. Would have been fun to camp though!  Don't store everything in one place, if you can help it. Even different areas of your room would be good. Do store your important documents in an easy-to-grab document holder now and put it in a safe place. I got a cheap plastic accordion-style file holder for my passport, birth certificate, necessary financial documents, etc.   Remember, check your uni regulations about keeping pocket knives, particularly flammable items, etc. in your room."

(First rule of not getting your shit stolen:  if you don't want it stolen, don't leave it unsecured and out in the open).  I don't know what kind of furniture you'll have available, but a place to neatly organize your gear in the corner, or in a wall locker, or somewhere will be infinitely better than ""spread out"".   An added and potentially important bonus to this is that you you might only get  labeled as ""organized"" rather than ... Paranoid.  keep your thoughts to yourself well enough, but I'd be hesitannt about making your paranoia (such as it were) too public.  But ""hiking gear"" hung on the wall for the weekend use is A-OK.    Having a map on your wall of the local area might be useful too, especially as you learn the area.  highlight camping areas, public locales of interest, as well as strategic points of interest, routes, and resources... the first few to obfuscate the other.

preppers,3a6iwq,34Mbit,3,Wed Jun 17 23:51:34 2015 UTC,"Rethink what your biggest risks actually are. In halls and other shared accomodation your biggest risks are more like burgalry, personal theft, being mugged, alcohol poisoning, self-harm and probably food poisoning. SHTF is way, waaay down there.  Go to the chemist and get painkillers like ibuprofen, some loperamide hydrochloride for shits and Pepto-Bismol for sickness. Keep those in your wallet and your room. Work out what works for your hangovers - an aspirin in water before bed is a good shout.  Get a hidden money belt (one that looks like a belt - not an Inbetweeners travel belt) and stuff a few £5's, £10's and £20's, a spare room key and a paper copy of phone numbers in there. If you are ever threatened with being mugged, you have no reason to not de-escalate the situation by just giving your wallet over.  As for needing to get home, the possibility does exist that you'll need to up sticks quickly; to see a family member in hospital for a morbid example. Use a large hiking bag as one of your bags you use to bring stuff to halls (the other container would probably be a suitcase, I suppose). Unpack the rucksack on arrival, but leave a small float of pants, socks, a t-shirt, a jacket and some snacks. Know your local bus/taxi/train situation and just leave the bag under your bed. It'll also be worth keeping a second debit/credit card in your bag incase your wallet is lost. The great thing about the UK is our weather is so mild, there's really nothing stopping you just hoofing the 45 miles home if it came to it.   You'll want to get a proper backing up system in place for your coursework, too. USB sticks and blank CDs are cheap. Buy ten USB sticks and make daily rotating backups, look into cloud solutions like Bittorrent Sync and post a weekly CD-R back home."

Unless you have a baby, or feel comfortable eating infant formula for breakfast time to time, it might not be the best option.  I will say, though, baby food--the kind that comes in the small, glass jars--that stuff is different.  It's got a longer shelf life, and pretty much anyone who can digest can eat it.  It tastes pretty decent because it's almost always nothing but what it says on the front--peas, pears, carrots--just in a puree form.  (And easily digestible means less water used to digest it.)  I've known people who keep jars on hand for snacks, and I ate it after I had some dental work done and couldn't chew for a week.    That downside is those jars are a lot more expensive ounce-by-ounce than most other forms, and they're heavy if you need to carry them.

I remember a research showing infants breastfed longer became had a correlation with being taller later in life. Is it because it sounds a bit like a conspiracy theory? Again, not trying to stir up shit here, I'm just curious."
preppers,3a3fbs,Gollygoshdarnscurvy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:53:38 2015 UTC,"but he made fairly good points.    I don't think so, and I think that poster would have a hard time sourcing any of that data from legitimate groups. For example, why girls hit maturity a younger ages is open to debate, but I've never heard anyone suggesting it's infant formula (the actual answer lies in the high caloric food children ingest, which leads to heavier children at younger ages, and maturity in humans is triggered by weight).   Formula isn't unhealthy, and not all women are capable of breast feeding their child sufficiently, and some mothers shouldn't do it for medical reasons. Hence, throughout human history mankind has had ""wet nurses"" - infant formula was developed as a cheaper alternative than this practice. It's just the reality that a lot of moms can't or won't breastfeed, and those moms have relied on infant formula for about 100 years now. There is no medical epidemic (or even medical controversy) about using infant formula, and it's widely recommend by doctors, academics, and people in the child industry.   Their arguments reads like someone who caught too many radical blogs on new-age health, because I've only come across fringe nutjobs who think formula is possibly a bad thing. If you cross posted this to any sub on parenting or children, they would very likely recommend a combination of breast feeding and formula."

preppers,3a3fbs,Xylord,2,Wed Jun 17 14:55:00 2015 UTC,"Because it provokes a debate on a question that doesn't fall under the purview of prepping. I'm not asking about how he feels about breastfeeding vs. formula or interested in that kind of charged pop political debate. It's whether or not we could use the stuff as a nutrient source. Do I really need to get into why my wife is unable to breastfeed here on the prepping sub? That's why it's kind of a bullshit post. Way too charged around something that is a digression/distraction. Next I'll have to hear about someone's feelings about Nestle's corporate practices in Africa when they talked women out of breastfeeding in the mid 20th century. It's like if a black dude says ""don't touch my head"", don't ask him why just don't touch the guy's head.

preppers,39zm80,canadienthunder,7,Tue Jun 16 01:59:53 2015 UTC,The right rifle is the one that you know how to use and can afford to feed in order to practice. Marksmanship is a perishable skill — make sure your skills are worthy of your rifle.  It also depends on where you are located. If you live in the country with long sight lines or a place with big game you will want a larger caliber. You might also want to consider what rifle others in your area may have. It's important to be able to share magazines if you're expecting the world to fall apart.  I own a M1A and it's a fine rifle but I have moved on to a LaRue PredatOBR 7.62 as my main survival rifle. I also own several AR-15's which may be a better choice depending on what happens. Don't expect there to universally be a correct answer for all situations.
preppers,39zm80,edheler,2,Tue Jun 16 03:04:18 2015 UTC,"I own a M1A and it's a fine rifle but I have moved on to a LaRue PredatOBR 7.62 as my main survival rifle.   For real one should have a sub-MOA rifle, accuracy is no joke in any situation and you better have the rifle tuned in your favor, the M1A  is generally 3 MOA at best while your average civilian AR is around 1 to sub MOA."
preppers,39zm80,howtospeak,4,Tue Jun 16 16:13:26 2015 UTC,"Most recent M1A's sold in the US are sub 2-MOA rifles. Mine is a national match which is just over 1-MOA. Your average AR-15 is usually comparable in accuracy. I don't recommend over-selling the AR platform because the problem usually isn't the rifle. I can tell you that the vast majority of people who think they are ""good shots"" aren't from my time on the Appleseed trail. I am willing to bet that the average hunter in the US today is about an 8 MOA shooter."

preppers,39zm80,deerhunter429,2,Wed Jun 17 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"So I have an AR-15 which i have poured quite a bit of money into, but it has become an extremely accurate, and very very reliable rifle.  I know AR's are generally not considered the absolute MOST reliable guns out there, but mine chews through every single type of ammo I've ever put through it, and has hardly experienced any jams, ftf's or fte's.  Not to mention that it cycles steel cased ammo without issue.  However, I feel that there is a formula you should adhere to, to be able to have a proper survival/wrol rifle.  That formula is accuracy+reliability+common ammo type+ease of use= the perfect survival rifle."
preppers,39zm80,Secretasianman7,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"Of what I have on hand, an AR and a Winchester 94, I'd take the Winchester. For me, it's more accurate than the AR, sturdy, and so far eats any ammo I feed it. Ballistics are fairly close to the 7.62x39, so I'm happy with it.  .30-30 isn't as common as 5.56 or 7.62, but it's only slightly more expensive, and I have enough stockpiled to make up for the ammo being less available."
preppers,39zm80,Irishlefty9,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:24:49 2015 UTC,"My AR15 is perfect for me. .233 and 5.56 ammo is pretty cheap and light. It'll take down damn near anything I'd encounter. Also, I know that rifle inside and out because I built it. My 10.22 would be a nice backup. It's small and light. .22lr is ridiculously light and inexpensive. It's pretty good on small game. It's also a quiet enough round that it won't destroy my hearing. That's something that's important to me. I'd like to get a can for my AR when I can afford to pick one up but it's going to be a couple years."

It isn't a bad rifle, but it's heavy, the ammo for it is heavy...and did I mention it's heavy?  Since you said ""WROL"" rifle, I'm assuming you're thinking in terms of combat.  I don't know where you are in Canada, but in most populated places you don't need a full sized rifle cartridge for ""combat"".  A intermediate rifle cartridge is better.  Here in the States, I would recommend a AR-15.  Going by your user name, I would consider getting a Tavor(since that's unrestricted)."

An AR15 is by far the best choice in North America when it comes to a fighting rifle. I'm an AK guy but if the SHTF and the world fell apart I'm going to grab an AR before I grab anything else."

I have several including a take down, in synthetic stock tactical version it's light and with threaded muzzle you could easily improvise a sound suppressor. Pocket full of ammo would get you along way and it is pretty easy to shoot out a 100-150yds reliably. People will mock the take down power of a 22 but you will be surviving off small game at best, and the lack of sound signature of a 22 is a huge benefit."
preppers,39zm80,Telefrag,2,Tue Jun 16 18:33:26 2015 UTC,"I think the 22 is a major under recommended rifle. Cheap, easy to maintain, available and common ammo...

For hunting small game and general survival purposes it just can't be beat. For self defense most of your encounters are going to be up close and within 20-30 feet at the very most. For that you are better served with a hand gun anyway. I'd say 9mm for self defense, and 10/22 for hunting and other survival purposes. Now only if Walmart started to get some 22 in stock."

preppers,39tdw4,molonlabe88,9,Sun Jun 14 16:19:04 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be honest with you, the whole situation sounds sketchy. They said they had three tents, one was used as a woodworking space, another as a closet for clothes and diapers, and the third as a kitchen. Were the children sleeping under the stars? If there were only three tents and that is how the tents were being used, according to the father, the kids did not have shelter .  Another concern of mine is the fact that there is a 7 month old, and a teenager who has Cerebral Palsy. The ability to regulate temperatures in little ones and disabled people can be problematic. The lack of ability to heat or cool the ones most susceptible is an issue for me.   Diaper rash, really? Let me tell you something. Grab a diaper and sqeeze some lemon juice in it. Attach it to your leg so that the elastic part is by your knees. Tape it on there and go to sleep. At the very least, you will have redness. Most people will have a rash. Urine is acidic and does cause rashes. Yes, if diapers are not changed often the rash can become problematic. Generally, a little bit of Desitin does the trick. Babies pee in their sleep. This happens and is quite normal. Diaper rash doesn't mean a person is a bad parent.   In my opinion, they brought animals into their ""camp"". To me, this means they were looking to be there long term. Without suitable living quarters for the kids, it's wrong. Of course, if SHTF and that's what has to happen it is a different story. This wasn't the case. They wanted to see if they could do it.   Your tagline was incorrect. They did NOT plan to camp for 9 days. They planned to camp for the summer, or until the kidney surgery was scheduled. This was even dumber because who knows what kind of infection or parasite they could contract that would result in the kidney not being suitable for transplant.   People need to thing logically before they commit to doing things. The article said that there was a generator. Generators are good however; the father said he does woodworking. I'm sure he would need the geni for work, unless he does so primate. One tent was a kitchen. Did they have a fridge, stove that needed the geni to run? I don't know. Obviously, they could use flashlights or lanterns for the closet tent.    So, was the 17 year old girl living in the woodworking tent, closet tent, or kitchen tent? I would like to know considering there were only three tents.   I understand thhat they had shower passes however; how far away was it to get to the running water. A little one, or even someone with CP might not be able to make the drive to the facilities to take care of business. Were the children required to urinate and defecate in the woods?   I am all for living off the grid and as self-sufficiently as possible. Sometimes, your circumstances and responsibilities just don't allow for it unless you have the money for wells, septic systems, solar power, etc. Putting your kids at risk is just wrong."
preppers,39tdw4,rolahey,13,Mon Jun 15 03:23:12 2015 UTC,"The cops are completely wrong here. If there was something wrong with the kids (diaper rash is not something uncommon) then leave them the fuck alone. Playing in the woods was cited by CPS as being a reason to take kids away? WTF kind of place is this? I would sue them so fucking hard they would have to go back to patrolling by foot. Fucking ridiculous shit, these people were camping, not living in the woods."
preppers,39tdw4,PabstyLoudmouth,11,Sun Jun 14 18:24:36 2015 UTC,Playing in the woods being supervised by a 15 year old was the reason cited.  I'm assuming that also means they left the child with CP by herself in the tent.

They WEREN'T JUST CAMPING.  They were trying off the grid living, and like it or not, there ARE minimum standard of care.   Running water is a big one.  Heat when you have a disabled child and a baby under 1 years old is a big one.   Like it or not--right or wrong, don't mess with CPS.   Follow through with their orders or don't be shocked when you get your children taken.  If they tell you to go home or get a hotel room, go home or get a hotel room.

Running water is a big one.     Did you read the article?  Sure, they were trying out an extended stay to see if they could live the off-grid lifestyle but at this point they were technically ""camping"".  They also purchased passes for the showers, which guess what, is a facility with running water.  They also had plenty of drinkable water on hand that they refilled on a regular basis.   So 30 gallons on hand, a facility with running water within walking distance, AND they were in Michigan... a state not known for a lack of water.  So that supposed ""standard of care"" was well taken care of.     Heat when you have a disabled child and a baby under 1 years old is a big one.    Well considering...   It was the 17 year old girl with a disability who was cold.  The ONLY reason she was cold was because CPS exposed her to colder temperatures by leaving her tent open for over an hour while not covering her up.  She was ONLY cold because CPS CAUSED IT.    That tells me you didn't even read the article.     Like it or not--right or wrong, don't mess with CPS.    You do realize this is the type of attitude that is allowing CPS workers across the country to take kids away from their parents for little to no reason at all, right?    Just accepting what the ""authorities"" say without question is the first step in giving them ultimate authority without regard to the truth.     This is not the first time CPS somewhere has overstepped their bounds and it wont be the last, saying to just listen to them blindly is as bad as them kidnapping kids because they feel like it.  The kids taken off the streets of Maryland while walking home from a park is a great example of this.     You can be ""right"" but if a judge agrees with CPS, you still won't have your kids with you.    Yes, because god forbid, an organization with as much power as CPS should be held accountable and actually have legitimate reasons to remove children from the care of their parents.  Hell, how many kids suffered ACTUAL abuse inside the foster care system because CPS wanted to play the bigger dick game.    Congrats on being a sheep.   I wonder how that worked out for the Germans between the 20s and the 40s.     EDIT:  OMG... SHE MENTIONED GERMANY IN THE 30S... SHE IS A CRAZY NUT JOB PSYCHO!!!!    Glad to see everyone has the same knee jerk reaction to a simple comparison.  Here's an idea, how about using your brain and actually THINK about the comparison for a spit second instead of ignoring that thing thats 3 feet above your ass.   Gee, how did the Nazi party come into power?  Oh, thats right, by slowly intimidating everyone though use of Government agencies to fall in line with what the party wanted.  By using ""The Children"" to manipulate an entire country.  The citizens of Germany allowed it to happen because they were submissive and were afraid the government would take them away or ""take their kids away"".     Just because you don't understand history does not make someone who does a Psyco or ""conspiracy theorist"".  Though the fact everyone has the same knee jerk reaction instead of actually THINKING about was was written is the single most frightening thing I have experienced in a long time.  The Nazis were SO nuts that even mentioning how our country is slowly starting to act like them makes you a nut job.     Though on a side note I am glad this is getting the attention it is because at least everyone here has seen my comparison.  The more people the message reaches the more people will start to think about it.    Go ahead, bring on those downvotes.    OH, and last but not least.  Still waiting for someone to logically explain to me WHY that makes me a nut job?  No one has yet to argue against the legitimacy of my comparison and instead has decided to make it a personal attack.  Well thats fine, no skin off my back, but its laughable that you can't even come up with a decent argument to answer my question.  THAT should tell you all something.

If the kids were left with their parents the state could use them to spy on their parents.

Please tell me, were did I outright compare CPS to Nazi Germany?  OH WAIT, thats right, I didn't.    I compared the mentality of someone saying to blindly follow what CPS claims regardless of the truth, to German citizens allowing the same thing to happen  in the 20s and 30s.  The point being if we blindly listen to authority without questioning them when they do something like this, removing children in no danger to place them in a foster home, when the government realizes we wont fight back it will be a slippery slope until they have far more authority than we want them to have... just like what happened over 2 decades in Germany.    Calling out someone for rolling over to the government like a submissive dog, and comparing them to the citizens of Germany who did the same damn thing, is NOT comparing CPS to Nazi Germany.  It is warning people that it is a slippery slope and we shouldn't blindly trust CPS because they have been flexing their muscles everywhere the last few years.    How about you think about this.  You automatically discounted a very relevant argument, one you already admitted was in context, simply because I mentioned Nazi Germany?  Shouldn't that alarm you?  That when someone points out a similarity your first instinct is to discount it?  Think about that for a minute and think about why you feel that way regardless of the fact the argument was within context.  Anyone who even mentions the Nazi's is automatically a nut job, almost like society has been made to feel that way.

Lets just ignore the fact that I never invoked Hitler or the Nazi party at all, I simply said I wonder how being submissive to the government because ""they can take your kids"" worked out for the citizens that actually had to live through the Nazi party.

It's the way that conspiracy theorists argue. Next you'll tell us that all the kids cps takes are at area 51.    Again, completely ignoring the context of what was said.    What is frightening is that everyone is convinced when you bring up HOW Germany fell to the Nazis you are suddenly a ""Conspiracy theorist nut job""... think about that for a second and think about your reaction to a simple comparison.

preppers,39q0my,akambience,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:11:51 2015 UTC,You can solve that by using solubility properties of metal in water.  For example lead is not soluble in water below 50F I think.  So chill the water down then also take from the top part of the barrell.
preppers,39q0my,cyu12,3,Thu Jul 2 04:05:13 2015 UTC,"No real need to treat it for flushing unless you are worried about handling it. I would just use a dedicated bucket for that purpose and not use the bucket for anything else, especially other water use - ever. Be sure to wash hands after as you normally would using clean, treated water.   As far as bathing and washing, I think I would just add to my potable water storage for that purpose in order to avoid illness from things like bird droppings that may have contaminated the roof water. Your other option would be some type of treatment system, but that could get pretty expensive.   CDC guidelines say to use roof captured water only for watering outdoors."
preppers,39q0my,adoptagreyhound,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:40:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. How much extra would you suggest for things like dish washing and bathing?  The reason I haven't stored more potable water already is mostly an issue of space for me, which is why I was hoping to be able to use the rain barrels I already have set up. I'm aiming for 30 days of preps for 3 adults + 1 dog + 1 cat. I have 3 weeks now, and I'm running out of places to store all the stuff.  I researched some treatment systems, but decided against them. It wouldn't be cost effective for 165 gallons, and could be useless if the power is out."
preppers,39q0my,adoptagreyhound,2,Sat Jun 13 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"I understand the storage issue. i have the same issue here since we moved to a house without a basement.   I would consider a couple of 55 gallon water barrels or  275 gallon IBC tote sif you can stash them somewhere and use a hand pump to pull out water as you need it. A couple of barrels or totes take up much less room than individual gallons.   If you fill with tap water from a municipal system, you really don't need to treat it. It will get stale tasting, but for washing etc - it doesn't matter.   If you are in an area where temps don't go below freezing, you can even store it outside. Someone linked an article here recently that found no real issues with storing water outside or in high temps.   We are in the desert and people here often store totes of water outside. I am considering doing this in the near future, and just covering with a UV blocking cover to keep the totes from degrading.   One other note, I actually measured water use by our dog (greyhound) and found that he uses more than a gallon a day between drinking and food prep / bowl cleaning. Make sure you add realistic calculations for your pets.   Given the amount of water you need to store, I would strongly consider bulk storage and a Berkey or Large Sawyer filter of some type instead of using retail gallons."

I hadn't thought of that, and I'll be sure to keep tabs on it going forward.  Unfortunately, storing water outside is a no-go for us because of low temps during the winter. But, I did see a guy who set up a row of 55 gallon drums on pallets for water storage, and I might be able to do something like that along an interior wall in my garage using tap water as you suggested.  Lastly, I'll look into bulk storage and a filter. Thanks for all the good suggestions."

I don't recommend using rainwater for drinking if you're in an urban area, because of all the chemicals that will be in it. You can invest a bit more to filter some of these chemicals out but I would never trust it.  As for the storage, the barrels may or may not be okay for storing drinking water. If they're used then they may need cleaning from their previous use. Also, some plastics are not suitable for storing drinking water because they leach chemicals into it. In the UK we have the WARS to be able to label water tanks as suitable/unsuitable for water storage."

It looks like a bit more than I want to spend, but I may reconsider this option if I start collecting more rain water.  Potential chemicals are my main concern. We have a shingle roof, so it may or may not be treated with chemicals to keep moss from growing on it. (I don't know because the shingles were installed before we bought the house.) None of the filters I looked at said whether or not it would filter those chemicals. I'm sure there are some that do, I just wasn't able to find anything specific in the price point I was looking.

Building codes may seem like red tape, until you look at Florida's annual weather and consider the cost to the state and community when someone's house smushes them and catches fire.   The antigovernment/government oppression angle sells, but in this case it's just not accurate.  Edit: went and googled her name, found a nice long report that I pasted bits from below.

preppers,39lc47,illiniwarrior,2,Sat Jun 13 00:30:03 2015 UTC,Here's the post if you don't feel like looking for it
preppers,39lc47,ohsopopularopinion,2,Fri Jun 12 22:09:26 2015 UTC,You got it. I think the one point that most people don't realize is that in Every city you pay a Water Bill. in this water bill is built in the Sewer Charge with the Idea that if you are going to take in  a certain amount of water that you are also going to discharge a certain amount of waste. The  reason is that it is easy to measure incoming water flow while with a gravity fed sewer system it is near impossible to measure the sewer flow. so you can't have one without the other.  With her being hooked up to the sewer system and not the water system she was not paying her fair share.  The second point is that yes you can live where you draw your own well water and discharge into your own septic system.  In areas where that is feasible there is no problem with that. There are no laws against it. In most of Florida it is not feasible for the fact that the water table is so high that you can't have a safe well and septic system. Also if you are in a High density situation like an urban 1/4 lot situation it is also not a feasibility as that many Septic system in that dense an environment it will overtax the resources and not filter out the contaminants efficiently and the water table will not support that much draw and dry up.  So that are a few of the laws she is fighting and wrongly fighting for where she is living.  It is a mater if she wants to live off the grid there are many places she can move where it will not create an environmental impact nor will she end up not paying her fair share.
preppers,39lc47,LinearFluid,-1,Sat Jun 13 03:18:34 2015 UTC,If her sewage is polluting another's property why not sue her for that?  As for the lantern thing...that's just over-officious nitpicking. If her house burns down she either has insurance or she doesn't.
preppers,39lc47,_HagbardCeline,3,Sat Jun 13 12:47:10 2015 UTC,"If her sewage is polluting another's property why not sue her for that?   I was wrong, initially her sewage was being dumped in the sewer that she wasn't paying to use. I had her confused with another story.    As for the lantern thing...that's just over-officious nitpicking. If her house burns down she either has insurance or she doesn't.   That would be fine, except that she's not paying the taxes that fund the emergency services that will have to come put out the fire. If the fire's not put out, the smoke alone is a hazard to everyone else [seriously burning houses are fairly toxic] and the risk of spreading fire means at the very least they'll have to monitor it. I don't know where she falls in the area, but a big smoke cloud can shut down flight paths or major roads, meaning economic impact. I've heard estimates for residential fires ranging from five to twenty-five thousand dollars, sometimes more. If she's injured but doesn't have health insurance, the community will pay for her care and treatment.   If she wants to live in a city, access their services, she'll have to comply with the laws that community sets. If she truly wants to live off the grid, humanure, and run off solar she can do it in an unincorporated area, run her own septic system, and have no hookups at all instead of living in a fire hazard in a crowded community and leeching off of others."

It's easier and cheaper to find a solution before hand rather than trying to find an excuse once you've been caught. There are several ways around this, of course, you can even apply for an exemption from that particular ordanance, which is fairly easy to get approved.

preppers,39lc47,kennerly,3,Fri Jun 12 20:43:36 2015 UTC,"You can't just pick and choose which laws you follow and which you don't.   I guess I just tend to believe that whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it.   Additionally, one has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws."
preppers,39lc47,DenSem,7,Fri Jun 12 20:57:34 2015 UTC,"That's why we have protests and petitions to change laws.  You bring up moral responsibility, but is it really immoral to not hook up to utilities?  They aren't asking her to tear down her solar panels or not collect rain water, they are saying that if her home is to be considered in code it has to be hooked up.  Whether she uses it or not is up to her discretion.  You can remove any home from the utility system by simply turning off the power at the junction box or turning off the water at the supply hookup.  It's not about morals it's about her not wanting to follow laws that existed when she built her house.  It's immoral to decide that you are above a law, especially when that law has no real impact on your lifestyle.    She could hook up and there would be no effect to how she lives her life.  She can still use rain water, still have solar power, still do everything she is doing now except she would be in compliance with city ordinances.  Instead she let's them remove her dog, declare her home as unlivable, and eventually they will seize the property if she continues to break the law and ignore court summons.  It's one thing to stand for what you believe in, it's another to absolutely refuse to work within the confines of the system you call home."
preppers,39lc47,kennerly,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:13:00 2015 UTC,You don't see how absurd it is that the city is forcing her to buy (cost money to hook up incase you were not aware) a product she has zero need for.

preppers,39lc47,kennerly,2,Sat Jun 13 18:11:18 2015 UTC,But why?
preppers,39lc47,jeepdave,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:27:51 2015 UTC,Because those are the city laws and ordinances she agreed to follow when she built her house in the city limits.  If she didn't want to follow those laws then she should have built her house somewhere else.
preppers,39lc47,kennerly,-2,Sat Jun 13 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the law is immoral. I said ""one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.""  If the system to which you refer is unjust, standing up for what you believe means going outside of that system and declaring it unjust. The issue is about individual freedom from the system. If it is unjust we shouldn't have to wait until the system catches up.   Just think about MLK (from whom the ""moral responsibility"" quote comes) and the sit-ins. While this lady may be arrested or have her house condemned, it is getting publicity on an important matter- just like the protests you suggest."
preppers,39lc47,DenSem,3,Fri Jun 12 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"MLK defined a ""just"" law as a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself.  He says that we have a legal and moral responsibility to obey just laws.   Asking a citizen of a county to hook their house up to local utilities is not a unjust law.  Even people within the homesteading community and those who live ""off the grid"" in city limits will still follow these laws, why?  because they don't impede their freedoms otherwise.  Now when a law is unjust it is a law that is inflicted upon the minority that, as a result denies them basic human rights, had no part in enacting or devising the law.  Now in this case the homeowner can follow the law and still live exactly as she wants."
preppers,39lc47,kennerly,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:50:45 2015 UTC,"Fair point. :)   That being said, do you feel she is going about changing the law in the most productive way possible? It seems it could work faster than going through traditional routes."
preppers,39lc47,DenSem,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:55:03 2015 UTC,"True it may work faster, but if she loses her home, her dog, her investment just to ""work faster"" is it worth it?  People looking from the outside just see an entitled resident who doesn't want to play by the rules and get their own way.  Even the police officer interviewed said it doesn't make sense but those are the laws.  There are better ways to get the laws change that don't lead to being potentially homeless."
preppers,39lc47,kennerly,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"Nope. What she's doing is becoming a ""crazy prepper"", conforming to the negative stereotypes that plague the preparedness community.

preppers,39lc47,Irishlefty9,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:31:15 2015 UTC,Not to mention being hooked to the grid with solar panels means you can save money in batteries.
preppers,39lc47,howtospeak,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:18:23 2015 UTC,"It depends why you are using solar panels in the first place. If you are on solar because, for example, you are in a black out prone area or you are fantasizing about some kind of societal collapse, not banking your solar energy would be a bad idea. Not to mention, with batteries, you can store energy during high solar activity and low usage, and then either use it during peak usage times to lower cost or sell the excess energy back to the energy company via double metering. Of course, I would recommend cost/ benefit analysis before you buy panels in the first place, since without careful planning it's very difficult to break even most places."

preppers,39lc47,xdig2000,2,Fri Jun 12 21:52:22 2015 UTC,"Quite the opposite, she didn't have to be hooked up, but she was, wasn't paying her sewage fees, and was using rainwater to flush into a sewer she wasn't helping to maintain. When that was capped, she began throwing human waste in her garbage. I'm not sure if humanure is a legal option there, as there would rightly be some serious concerns with her presenting a nuisance and health hazard if done wrong, especially given FL's shallow water table, but a septic tank is absolutely doable. FL septic systems tend to be build above the water table and then covered with a mound, but require a pump to overcome the uphill flow.   As others have said, there were plenty of ways to do this if off-grid was her goal. Instead, she chose a very pricey house in the center of town and has been stealing from others to make ends meet."
preppers,39lc47,SkepticPrep,2,Sun Jun 14 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"I live in SW FL. I know this story inside, outside and upside down. People in SW FL are allowed to live off the grid. Robin is living inside of a city, the city of Cape Coral. They do have rules.   It is my understanding from many local news articles, that she did not pay her water and sewer, which is why her utilities were shut off. She then began to use plastic bags for human waste (I'm being nice). She put those bags in the trash. This is what gives preppers a bad rep. Most of us pay our bills, and do what we need to do. She did not pay the bills and then claims that she wants to live off the grid. She's crap. She can't pay her bills, so she's looking to say that she is living off grid as a way out. It doesn't work.   She doesn't even have a generator. I'm glad the county took the dogs. If I didn't have the ability to run my air (again, I'm in SW FL) my dogs would be grabbing their BOBs and heading for the door.   I drives me nuts when someone is just to lazy to get a job and pay their bills. If she had a well and septic and solar, I don't think Lee County would mess with her. She doesn't. It's that simple."
preppers,39lc47,rolahey,3,Mon Jun 15 04:06:31 2015 UTC,"Not surprising.  Years ago when the movement for large corporations to have ownership on water, there was a loud but small scare movement that other people laughed away.  Years ago I posted an article about it being potentially illegal to gather rain water on your own property, which people didn't think was a big deal.  Now that the laws were given time to mature and water is now a legal commodity, it actually is illegal to gather water even on your own damn property.  Don't break the law that you helped create, kids."

preppers,39lc47,mikeyo73,3,Fri Jun 12 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"I can shed some light here, if you'll pardon a little pun. Most Amish aren't actually all horse-and-buggy. Many have at least hooked up to the community utilities, even if they do not use them, but because of some of the genetic issues with the Amish community's small gene pool, there's increased incidence of certain genetic diseases. As a result, many communities will hook up to and use electricity and water for things like refrigeration for food and medicine. Modern or semimodern tractors with big steel wheels are not uncommon, almost always with electric lights for safety. Most if not all homes or communities have phones hooked up for emergency use only.   Here's an article that talks more specifics: http://amishamerica.com/do-amish-use-electricity/  Amish lifestyle is less a fear or utter rejection of modern technology and more of a self-imposed restriction on its use. The Amish are more akin to ascetic monks blended with fundamentalist orthodox or Hasidic Jewish communities than the pop-culture image would suggest."

preppers,39lc47,Cytorath,13,Fri Jun 12 19:01:08 2015 UTC,"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-07-10/off-the-grid-in-florida-robin-speronis-fights-municipal-code  Stealing Wi-Fi   Wireless Internet is siphoned from a nearby Tire Kingdom.   Real estate fraud, entering into a mortgage agreement she did not intend to keep.    This included the earlier purchase in 2009 of a $495,000 waterside home on a palm-lined street in Cape Coral. Speronis knew she didn’t have the money to make the mortgage payments, so she engaged in what she called a “strategic default.” Using her knowledge of the real estate industry to delay foreclosure, she stayed afloat by selling off her possessions.   Note that she wasn't paying for her sewer connection.    Her only connection to city services was the sewer: She flushed waste down the toilet, again with rainwater. “I can go weeks or a month without spending a penny,” she says.   According to city officials, what she was doing was not an issue, it was how she was doing it. If you go to the second page of the article, you'll see her fire hazard of a home electrical setup. I don't believe she was paying her property tax bill either, which means a house fire would be paid for by the city.    Cape Coral argued that it had nothing against Speronis going off grid, only with how she’d done so. “There are an awful lot of alternatives out there that meet code,” says Frank Cassidy, the city’s code compliance division manager. “The problem is that she is not using those methods.” He ticked off a litany of municipal resources for cisterns, composting toilets, retrofit grants, equipment, housing assistance, and programs to sell excess solar power to the grid.   City representatives periodically proclaimed their interest in an amicable resolution. “Our primary objective is voluntary compliance through education,” says Cassidy, the compliance manager. “Every house has a story, and we try to find that story to guide them to compliance. We don’t like hearings or escalating remedies.”   More using the grid without paying for it, improper disposal of human waste, etc. The courts did slap the city for charging her with the wrong thing, so the system does work.    “Reasonableness and code requirements don’t always go hand-in-hand,” the special magistrate declared. But Speronis had confirmed at the magistrate’s hearing that she was flushing waste into the sewer with rainwater without paying to use the system, and the city moved against her. A few days after the hearing, city officials showed up at her house, dug up the front yard, and capped her access to the sewer. Then they filed a complaint against her with the Florida Department of Health, alleging that she was creating a health hazard by spreading her waste on the lawn. The charge was untrue. Speronis used a camp toilet with detachable bags that she tossed into the city garbage system—which was a code violation, but not one the city had alleged. The state health department investigated, cleared Speronis, and said the city had committed its own violation and created a “sanitary nuisance” by capping the line.   Alleged title fraud, which matches her previous conviction of a real estate client's deposit money.   And then there was the issue of who owned the house. Speronis maintains that a friend had essentially given it to her—the sale was recorded with the county for $10—because it was vacant and in disrepair and he didn’t like her living in the woods. The friend, a semiretired landscaper named Ronald Mayo, emerged to dispute that, telling police that Speronis had forged his name and a notary seal on the title transfer documents. “She was a friend, and I was letting her stay there,” Mayo says. “I gave her a small piece of paper to go to the county to represent me with the property. Next thing I know, she sold the AC units.” Speronis denies this account. “Men like Ron, they don’t understand me,” she says. “They think I’m doing this because I can’t make ends meet. But it’s fun. I want to do it.”   Another visit, more code violations. Again, she wasn't off in the woods, she was in a neighborhood in very close proximity to others. There's also a running issue of alleged mistreatment of her pet dogs.   “The most hazardous issues were the use of the stove and the propane lantern inside, as well as the recharging of the battery,” says Cassidy. “If she ends up blowing herself up or catching fire in that house, then it’s not, ‘why are you picking on this woman?’ It’s ‘why didn’t you do something about it?’ ”   If you look into the good, full-background journalism it becomes less an issue of the government wanting someone reliant on them, and more an issue of someone with a felony background trying to game the system and leech off others while presenting a major safety hazard to the community. At the end of it, they capped the sewer to keep her from using it without paying, she did some time for an animal cruelty charge, and has stayed out of the headlines since."

preppers,39lc47,SkepticPrep,11,Sun Jun 14 00:28:11 2015 UTC,"In all likelihood it probably stems from a standard of living issue. All properties should be connected to the water/sewage system so that they can have those services when they need them. The option not to use them is fine, but it used to be a major problem when housing developers could build homes without making connections available to public utilities, thereby leaving the buyer to find out if they were even connected and then pay to establish the connection.  With this regulation now all buyers are supposed to have the available connection, or be told that it is not existing and they must build it before moving into the property. It's just to protect the property owner.  Yes, there should be no obligation to use the public services if the property owner has viable alternatives available, but there definitely should be connections available. The public should have the right to access public utility."

preppers,39lc47,Cytorath,5,Fri Jun 12 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's supposed to be a municipal right for every person living in an area that has these services. The government wants everyone to have utility services available, it's a benefit to the public.  Even if the person or family owns the property and is only paying property taxes, with no intention of ever selling it to anyone else, and just handing it down through the family, they still have rights, as human beings, to access public utilities.  I'm all for free will and freedom of choice, so I'm all for allowing the people to opt out of using it, but I do like the idea that it has to be available and accessible to them. I know that's not an idealist libertarian value, but I consider myself a bit more practical than the average libertarian, and I recognize the benefit of the government regulating the availability of services to all citizens.  Having the utilities connected and available at any given time could be considered as a fail-safe for the lady in the article. Assuming any of her independent preps breakdown or something, she at least would have an available fallback to get some running water, or keep electricity going in a storm or something. I understand why they want it made available to her.  Additionally, since the regulation has been in place for a long time, she probably shouldn't be surprised that it's there."

preppers,39n4e2,Davethekid,3,Fri Jun 12 23:42:38 2015 UTC,"AAA is great for when you need them (dead battery, flat, out of gas, locked out etc). Depending where you break down, sometimes it's best to stay in the car and sometimes it's safest to wait away from that car. Learning to change a tire can be misleading because one learns how to do it in a driveway. Breaking down on I-84 or 91 and having to change it on the shoulder (maybe even in the dark) is challenging. Always better to be self sufficient, however, things happen and AAA is well worth the fee for the 3 road calls per year."

Not paying taxes for provided services would work if you deferred your ""tax dollars"" to private organizations that are in competition with each other to provide that particular service for you. But that would be a complete social shift which would take quite a while to achieve. BUT, its also important to keep in mind that there are many ways of doing the same thing. All just as viable. The way we go about it today is to have a centralized entity do it as opposed to competing groups being hired by a community within the market of services. That's what civilization does, It finds a way to do something, and if it's favorable it improves it.  edit: oh yah, and the global economic implications of the federal collapse in such a short period would be tremendous."

preppers,39pl4h,Astroloan,2,Sun Jun 21 07:49:20 2015 UTC,"As an anarchist   I'm a bit off topic, but I'm curious how that plays out...Are there different ""levels"" to anarchy that people subscribe to? For instance, no government at all, or an unofficial government (i.e. strongmen), etc..."
preppers,39pl4h,RedditClone3,3,Mon Jun 29 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"It depends on your flavor of anarchist really. At the core of any anarchist tradition is the belief that government is immoral and should be eliminated. It is not a belief in violence in order to achieve your goals. The exact reasoning for why it is immoral varies between each school of thought. For instance your collectivist types see any kind of power hierarchy as immoral because no one person should be above another. They also reject hierarchical authority in business as well favoring a communal ""ownership"" of the means of production. Your more market type anarchist, of which I subscribe too, see reject the authority of the State based upon the principle of self-ownership. That is, the State cannot rightfully dictate how one can live their life, or engage in practices that deprive them of life, property, or liberty without their consent. So, for instance, the collection of taxes are immoral because they are taken by force and without consent. Of course anarchist theory is far more complicated than this very rudimentary summary.  As for how it plays out in the real world, well, that would depend on what type of anarchist you are. The Marxian types would want to burn the world down and start over from the beginning. Others would see the institution of the State phased out over time. Personally I believe that you cannot just flip the switch and everything would be fine. People are reliant on various State institutions for their everyday lives and if those institutions were gone tomorrow people would panic. Strongmen would rise up with the promise of delivering order out of the chaos and you'd have a repeat of what happened in Somalia.  Anarchy is simply a political philosophy that argues that society does not need a central authority to govern people. I won't speak for the collectivist types but for me an anarchic world isn't a violent world but an ordered world regulated through market forces and the peaceful interaction of everyday people. So to finally answer your question, no there would not be a government. You would live your life much as you do today but without a central authority regulating every little aspect of your life. Everything you need or want would be provided by the market for you to pick and choose how you spend your money. Everything the State does now can, and should, be provided by participants in the free market. There is no reason to use force or violence to provide any service when, if you left things for people to figure out, those things would be provided voluntarily and in greater number.   Edit. I believe you can transition from a statist society to an anarchist one without any violence and little disruption in anyones lives by employing the same method Fabian socialist employ. Fabian socialist believed that you could most effectively achieve a socialist state by gradually introducing more and more socialist policies. This would allow people time to not only come to grips with socialist institutions but also become completely dependant upon them. A free market anarchist society could be created in the same way but in reverse. You slowly divest the state of its institutions and powers over time. This would allow market actors time to establish alternatives to state institutions and give people time to adjust to and become dependant upon these new market provided services. Eventually there would be little support for even the smallest of government and the transition would be complete."

preppers,39kftk,samsqanch5,13,Fri Jun 12 13:40:38 2015 UTC,"Prepping has gotten a bad rap over time. Due to media focusing on the extreme end of the spectrum, most people associate prepping with bunkers, 5 years of food and armor plating an old pickup.   But even the act of storing a couple weeks of food and water, maybe a weapon and ammo, makes you a prepper. You're planning your survival from some unknown threat, and there's nothing wrong with that. You won't get any argument from people on this sub about the merits of  emergency preparedness. If you try to prepare for every eventuality, you'll go broke and/or insane. Just start with simple goals and objectives. Say, 30 days of supplies and make a list of specific threats to your location. Do you get tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, live near a power plant or chemical plant, etc? Plan around what you feel would be most likely to impact your life."
preppers,39kftk,rolahey,2,Fri Jun 12 14:09:18 2015 UTC,"You are so right, Samsqanch5. We all prepare for different reason. Do we all want to survive everything? Of course we do, buy few of us want to live in bunkers for 20 years. lol   OP, prepping is a personal thing. We do it for our own reasons. We prep for what we think will happen, and hope it never does. We are not crazies like they portray on TV shows.   Personally, I would advise that you create a bug out bag, and keep water and MREs in your car. That would be the start. Move on from there. Think about it. If SHTF, you'll be in a mutilated house with some beans and rice maybe. Proactive is where you need to be. How do you get out. Maps (not GPS), and have a place to go.

Go there, meet people, talk to them about conditions under which you should head there. Find out how they communicate with Americans specifically.   Maybe it's a radio frequency, or a TV channel.  Meet the guards on duty, so that if something happens you don't face closed gates and an assault rifle pointed at you while you shout, ""I'm an American!""  Instead they'll open when they see you coming. Etc etc.  Don't expect to save any of the children you're teaching with this strategy, the Marines at the gates won't let them in."

Different coloured clothing may imply different political allegiances. If your clothing is the wrong colour in a crowd of angry people it could end badly for you.

First, it is great that you are thinking about and have the means to store water, be it pickle buckets or whatever else. There are several uses for water besides drinking, and one is the psychological effect of going into a clean toilet. You also don't need potable water for bathing, washing the dishes, watering the plants and garden, and washing clothes by hand. If your prepping goals and means allow you to store water for those purposes than by all means, do it.   For drinking water, you should have one gallon per person per day in clean and FDA-approved containers for however long your prepping goals require. Don't skimp on this shit. I personally am prepped for a two-week stint without drinking water. A gallon of water is $0.88 at Walmart and is good for a year. I keep them in a dark and cool part of my basement, and though it hasn't been a full year since I've started prepping, the jugs are date stamped and I will change them out every year.  I have non-potable water stored in the plastic buckets that my cat litter comes in.  Hope that helps."

preppers,39bu31,thomas533,3,Thu Jun 11 03:31:36 2015 UTC,"Water never goes ""bad"". Most of the water on earth is billions of years old. At some point in history that glass of water you just drank was someone else's urine. It is just a matter of knowing how to make it fresh again. It can become contaminated becasue it wasn't clean when it was stored and bacterial growth has happened during storage. It can absorb off flavors from the containers it was stored in. It can also loose the dissolved air that fresh water normally has and end up tasting flat. The later two are not really issues that effect the safey of the water and the first one is pretty simple to deal with with a filter or chemicals (bleach is the easiest)."

You line the bucket with a bit of kitty litter and do your business in the bucket. You can even get compostable kitty litter, but generally the kitty litter will remove the smell or your body waste (and when it stops removing the smell, you just replace the litter or add more on top). That's a more effective solution, especially if your water is not running then you should save water for drinking.   Plus, if municipal water stops running, likely sewage/waste-water is not working either, and you're just going to clog up your own pipes causing long term damage. Often times (especially when water shuts off) people's toilets and showers will start stinking of sewage because there's not enough water usage to flush items down the pipes far enough."

preppers,398bs3,Mr_Dove,8,Tue Jun 9 23:57:26 2015 UTC,"Generally, bugging out isn't recommended unless you (1) have a specific destination you can feasibly get to, or (2) it's to some type of temporary dwelling, such as a hotel or a shelter. Hiding out in the woods during a hurricane, tornado, or flood is I'll-advised, to say the least. Think modularly. You shouldn't need all the jingle for scenario 2 as you would if you are hoofing it via scenario 1 vs with a vehicle. Flesh out some possibilities or likely scenarios and you will probably receive more feedback."
preppers,398bs3,realeyes_realize_,5,Wed Jun 10 01:10:38 2015 UTC,"The LDS church has a lot of recommendations on this - basically you should have a BOB for each of your kids, even if it's just an Jansport school backpack. For the kids: Change of clothes, extra food, important documents and contact information of the parents, family, and friends. Pack this into a high-visibility backpack your kids enjoy and keep it in their closet. Parents might have the bulk of supplies, but it's very plausible that your children can be separated from you during an emergency.   For example, natural disaster happens when they're at school and you and your wife are working, transportation home becomes impossible. This happens very commonly in large scale natural disasters. Another situation to consider is if there's political instability and you're sending your kids off to stay with other family while you (and perhaps your wife) stay at home to protect it or watch over your property, this scenario happens regularly around the world. What do you pack in that situation?  I met a firefighter who had an interesting concept on bugging out:   Where I would have a bug out bag I have 3 pieces of paper and a duffel bag. Each piece of paper explains what I need to grab depending upon how much time I have. The first sheet says “10 minutes” so if I have 10 minutes this is what I’m getting. The next sheet says “30 minutes”, and I grab all of the stuff on the my 10 minute list, and it takes me 20 more minutes to grab this stuff. My last sheet says “1 hour”, and it’s 30 more minutes of stuff I’ll load into my truck. The problem with a bug out bag is that you don’t take care of the stuff inside. Medication and food goes bad, batteries die, and you don’t take care of it.   I don't entirely subscribe to these ideas, but there's some interesting concepts to take out of it. It's worth having some set-aside kits like backpacks that contain your very basic supplies like the LDS church recommends, this way you and your family can leave in a moments notice. Meanwhile, depending upon if you have 10 minutes or 10 hours, you should probably have a list of things you're loading into your car and a general idea of what your plan is.   I have an in depth guide to bug out kits & considerations if you're interested, it's geared to adults though. I might try to track down some stuff I got from the mormons on kid bugout bags if there's interest (there's probably a lot on google already)."

Having your plastic tubs is still a good idea, but moving to back packs is a great idea in case you get separated from your vehicle. You actually don't need a huge pack to accommodate your goal. Each child should carry their own clothes, a water source, a meal or snack, and a sleeping bag. You can also add more gear depending on the age and strength of your child. I also recommend not carrying a huge tent for your entire family. It adds a lot of unnecessary weight. Having multiple smaller tents or tarps spread out is more effective and easier to carry. You may have to carry more food, which may increase what size your bag is, but you can always redistribute the food after every day to reduce the weight you carry. As far as finding the right size for you the first time so you won’t buy extra packs, get everything you want to put in your bag first, then find the bag that fits all of it. If you have any other questions let me know!"

In the dark at home there is zero chance of collateral damage or bullets going all over the place. People get shot and keep attacking and running and sometimes aren't even sure they were shot right away. You know when you have a sword in you. Looks awesome. Did I mention shiny. Also... Dirt cheap... Like cheaper than ammo cheap. When I see someone sitting on $6,000 in ammo and criticizing a $300 sword, I question their sanity. Nations were built with swords.

At the moment, I always carry with me a slightly-larger-than-average sized first-aid kit, a small knife, a glass punch, a really great multitool, my nunchucks, and I actually cary some throwing stars on me- three hidden in the first aid kit and one hidden in my wallet. I can throw the stars with almost perfect accuracy up to about 10 feet, and I'll hit you 90% of the time from 40 feet. (I also know how to throw the knife, if need be, and I'm extremely lethal with the nunchucks, if I do say so myself.) I think prepping for things like a riot, or a robbery, or a kidnapping or something similar is easier than for the apocalypse. The way I prep, or at least the only way I can as a high schooler pulling in $60 a week, definitely is better for safety in public spaces."

Frankly, the throwing items are kind of silly as well.  Are you trying to stop a threat or piss them off?  Throwing stars and knives do not penetrate deep enough to disable a threat from continuing.  Best case is you hit them in the eye to detour them from continuing the attack.  However if you hit a bad guy in the eye with a lucky shot, he's still VERY likely to shoot you which is generally bad.  During real force on force scenarios, your fine motor skills are shit due to shunting and adrenaline.  The idea is to NOT draw attention to yourself.  The best way to win a fight, is to not be there to begin with.  By carrying unrealistic weapons, supposing it's not a felony like my state of Commie-fornia, is really only going to force you to give up the element of surprise.  Additionally it's going to MAKE you a target because someone who really is a criminal threat is likely going to pick you just to prove a point and have some fun at your expense.  Most likely with a gun in his hand and a bunch of buddies to start with.  For $60 a week you would be better off going to a summer school class to get EMT certification.  Those are skills you will definitely need in your lifetime whereas ninja stars, probably not a good idea unless they're tipped with poisonous frog toxins."
preppers,397gtq,rocntenr1,-3,Thu Jun 11 07:28:50 2015 UTC,"Throwing stars and knives do not penetrate deep enough to disable a threat from continuing.   Have you ever been hit with a throwing knife ow star? I havent, but I throw them too as just a sort of hobby (I wouldnt really use it for defense, its just not practical in modern times) But they will do a decent amount of damage. The way Im picturing this, he throws the stars and knife. Guy gets hit and has a minor freak out ""Holy fuck theres a star in my neck and a knife 2 inches in my stomach wtf"" While he if trying to figure out what just happened, nunchucks.   Correct me if Im wrong, but I believe nunchucks are a surprise weapon. You spin them around and all that shit, the bad guy gets confused as he tries to figure out how to block it and you either get in come good hit or he shoots you in the chest and has a good laugh.  I completely agree with you, throwing knife vs gun, gun wins 9.99/10. But I also know where he is coming from. Ive ben at the point where I can only have blades to defend myself"
preppers,397gtq,mrsir79,2,Wed Jun 10 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"Crack open your history book.  Those thrown items were meant as nuisance and distraction items.  They were more often used as buried items to be stepped on.  I'm a licensed EMT and yes, I've seen injuries from throwing stars and throwing knives.  The starts will puncture and then fall off since the bulk of the weight is on the back end and with the exception of one hand injury, falls out on impact.  Consider that a 2"" penetrating injury is NOT going to reach any vital organs or arteries which is a requirement to stop a threat.  Most of the home invasions involve drugs which also limit the amount of pain and logic the person goes through making those weapons even less effective.  Nunchucks are not a surprise weapon any more than a baseball bat is.  They can't be hidden and spinning them around is only going to give the bad guy more time to decide to shoot you or harm you some other way.  Given a good knife vs. a nunchuck, I'm still betting on the knife.  Even a baseball bat would be better in this instance since you'll have more kinetic energy from that vs. a nunchuck.  Plus you can be seen in public with a baseball bat and only have minor looks and not risk a potential felony.    Going back to the OP, even a sword and machete are horrible ideas.  Given the amount of blood borne diseases in the criminals we have these days, I personally don't want to be exposed to any blood I don't have to.  Getting in a good shot with a machete or sword, assuming you were a ninja master is going to produce A LOT of blood, and probably squirting with some force behind it.  No NO NO NO!  I'm not going to engage a bad guy and stop the threat and then ask him to wait while I put on gloves and face shield before continuing his attacks."
preppers,397gtq,sparkyomattic556,-2,Thu Jun 11 12:53:47 2015 UTC,"So you are saying that a 2"" penetrating wound wont stop anybody? Are you mental? You get stabbed with a 2"" blade and its going to at least slow you down, if the bleeding doesnt stop you. And I dont mean stop you as in bleed out, I mean stop you as in ""Oh shit Im bleeding bad""  Go ahead, carry a baseball bat around everywhere with you.  Have you ever wielded a sword or machete? You dont need a good blow to seriously slice them, assuming that you take care of it and keep it sharp. And if they are bleeding incredibly bad and spurting blood, something tells me they arent going to continue. And even if they do it wont be fore long"
preppers,397gtq,blue_27,2,Thu Jun 11 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"Correct, a 2"" penetrating injury is not deep enough to reach a vital organ that would FORCE someone to stop attacking.  Supposing you happened to nick a carotid artery in the neck which would be incredible luck.  They would still have 15 seconds or more until the oxygen ran low enough or their BP drop would force them to stop.  I've seen people bleeding BAD, not just ninja star bad either.  They've been fine and hold a fairly nice conversation with me on the way to the hospital.  Remember attackers willing to get close enough to get struck by a weapon are likely to also be on drugs OR their adrenaline is so high they're not going to feel a lot of pain anyway.  I've seen people shot multiple times and still continue to fight with no drugs in their system at all.  Most of the time attackers do not realize the extent of their injury until way after EMS arrives.  But still, a sword of machete is going to create a lot of bloody mess that is now a serious bio-hazard.  Why expose yourself to that?  I don't carry a baseball bat, I carry a Glock 30 .45 ACP.  Even with 2 shots center mass, I'm still training to potentially NEED to do a head shot to immediately stop an oncoming threat because they'll have around 15 seconds to continue to try and kill me after completely shutting down their hearts ability to function on impact of the bullet.  2"" penetrations are not deep enough to reach the heart or lungs which would be an injury necessary to stop someone from continuing to fight.  Anything that stops them would be purely psychological."

Can it be used for anything else?  I'm not really convinced that knives or machetes should be considered defensive weapons for an untrained individual.  Both can be easily neutralized by a man with a stick that knows how to use it.  Even if you could justify the weight (which you can't), you can not hunt with a sword.  You can not dress game with a sword.  You can not split wood with a sword (I don't even recommend axes, I'm all about the saw, but that's a different thread).  You can't do shit with it except behead zombies, impale yourself, or attack blackberry bushes.  Are you prepared to maintain such a weapon?  Clean it, oil it, sharpen it?  What about repair it, if need be?  Can you cannibalize another sword for spare parts like I can do with my Mossy 5?  I am no authority whatsoever, but I look at prepping as being ready for bad shit to happen.  This means tools and defensive weapons.  A sword is neither.  /$0.02"

Yes they can be rendered useless by a person with a stick, or staff, but  how many people actually train with staff anymore? How many people know how to effectively use a stick for defense? We arent monks, the people who train with them are far and few between. And they ones that can are the ones that are trained in karate or some other form of hand to hand.  Yes I can cannibalize a sword for spare parts. Grips and sheaths can be used for other things. And once your Mossy 5 runs out of ammo or jams, it becomes a very expensive paperweight that is useless until you reload it or unjam it. And dont even tell me you could just hit me with it. Because theres my argument.   No you cannot hunt with a sword, but you can hunt with a knife. Hell, Ive got training for hunting with sticks  You can also cut wood with machetes.

preppers,397gtq,broscientologist,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:58:26 2015 UTC,"1) I am not untrained, so ... that isn't really my issue.  I am pointing out that since OP is not going to study Japanese sword fighting in JAPAN, that he won't get the training he needs to use a sword effectively.  And a sword is an offensive weapon, so it will simply be a weight issue since survival isn't the act of looking for a fight.  You really don't need to train with a bo staff to figure out how to keep it between you, and a sharp pointy thing.  2)  Have you ever seen a shotgun jam?  Seriously?  I have fired thousands of rounds through it, and Michelle has never had a single failure of any kind.  And if it runs out of ammo, then I use the M-7 bayo on the end, Again, this isn't a combat environment we are talking about.  It's a tool.  It is primarily used to procure food.  No ... you are not going to be able to cannibalize shit, because you are going to be the only fool out there with a sword ... If things go bad, I know where to find a replacement feed ramp.  Can you the same about a sword?  Nope.  3) We aren't talking about knives.  I said sword.  Stop confusing the issue.  4) Sword, not machete.  Again, stop confusing the issue.  But it's still not as effective as an axe or a saw, so ... poor weight management.  5) Nope.  First off, they aren't the same thing.  And finally, a sword simply isn't a tool.  I'm not trying to convince you of anything.  Do whatever you'd like.  Just be cautious in giving out horribly bad advice, and blatantly incorrect statements like shotguns jamming.  It's not an AK-47.  But, you are honestly trying to advocate bringing a katana into a survival situation ... over a Mossberg or a Remington.  Dude, I'm staying far the fuck away from you if SHTF.

I will use my multi use tool  5) The right type of sword is a tool. 6) I never said I was only gonna take a sword. Im not that stupid. Any moron can tell that a gun is superior to a sword. But do you see how the title also says ""hand to hand?"" A gun is not a hand to hand weapon. There is a time and place for it. If someone is shooting at me, Yes. Im going to run at them with a sword because Im that stupid. Of course Im going to shoot back! But if a Hand to Hand situation, as the title of this thread states, Yes. Sword all the way. If someone is coming at me bare handed/with a knife/with a stick/anything except a fucking gun or bow, a sword would be a far better option than nothing or that stick sitting by the fire.

And before anyone looses their shit because of this, I realize that swords have a disadvantage when it comes to guns. Anyone can see that. But at close range when you mag is empty, your auto loader jams because youre using scavenged ammo or you sneak into my camp, am I going to hit you with the butt of my rifle or put a nice slice in your torso? And everyone seems to be forgetting about the fact that bayonets were used for a long time (idk if they still are) for close range. Why waste a shot when I can put a blade through you?Blades are completely silent and if you buy a quality one, you wont break it. I would steer away from a fighting type sword and go with a long machete. Cold Steel has some large ones if youre really looking for length. I personally like shorter blades because they are more maneuverable but its personal preference.   If you are going to buy it to train with for shiggles, go for it. Get a broad sword or something like that. But if you want it for that AND in case SHTF, go with something you can use to cut wood and clear brush as well as for defense. You will be using guns for defense primarily afterall. You dont cut down a tree with a great sword or a katana, but you can with a good quality machete."

I would want to have some supplies for being held over at work to deal with damage, power outages etc. A meal or two, as well as gloves, goggles, flashlights and first aid items, drinking water and maybe a few hand tools could all come in handy should your worksite be part of the damage.

There is a concept called ""bugging-in VS bugging-out"" that is always brought up and debated to no end, because it is about knowledge and threat assessment and all that critical thinking.

And even in the worst tornadoes, the damage path is a small swath of the city (unless it's a tiny city). Unless the tornado hit you or your home, the aftermath will essentially mean you take a detour to get home.  Not that a GHB is a bad idea, but tornadoes aren't really something you prepare to travel for. You just need to pay attention to the weather, have some place sturdy (and preferably below ground) to go to, and mild preps in that sturdy place (protective headgear, flashlight, whistle, enough water for a day or two, maybe a radio)."

Sorry, just couldn't hold that one back any longer . :-)  There are simplistic encryption techniques built into some cheap radios, but all you have to do is guess the right code and you can eavesdrop. The quickest,  easiest and cheapest is wifi or possibly wimax. All you need are some smart phones , the right software and a central hub.  It is possible to purchase commercial radios and programming equipment and setup truly secure communication, but you are looking at $1,000+ per radio and then the rest on top of that (thousands more). And unless you are stealing all of this you will need an FCC license as well. Your best bet to get into this would be to start a legitimate security or radio business and plan to use commercial equipment for private use in a SHTF scenario. Actually, it might well be perfectly legitimate.  I'm going to skip things like building your own equipment and using existing radios illegally on amateur radio or (analog) commercial. It's actually harder than it sounds.  Alternatively just do what everybody else does and use code words or something. Then you can still communicate with others but have semiprivate communication for tactical scenarios (which I am assuming is the point)."

Banks could close on a Friday night and that evening there be a national announcement that they will remain closed. This is one of the less likely but important reasons to keep a healthy cash reserve out of the banking system.  If you want to see bank runs in action in very recent times you need to mostly look at Greece. During the early part of the crisis people were buying gold for cash at nearly twice the average elsewhere in the world.  What happened in Cyprus is another informative example. Banks closed on a Friday and then everyone with balances over a certain amount were confiscated. It is a great lesson that your money is not safe in banks in our current world.  I wouldn't worry as much about non-cash accounts. Certainly they could be confiscated by authorities but if it ever gets that far then it is likely that other concerns will overwhelm all of our decision cycles. A retirement account isn't too useful if you're having trouble obtaining enough necessities of life.  Bank runs won't happen in isolation. A panic takes time to develop and there will be other concurrent and related events. Analyze the events of 2007-2009 for yourself and then compare it to 1999-2001. History doesn't repeat but it sure does rhyme.

What causes a run is loss of confidence in the currency;ie, because it is losing or likely to lose value over time. The threat of a Greek exit from the Euro system is what started the bank run in Greece recently, and I think it's just a matter of time before all nations with fiat currencies experience the same sort of thing.        Although a nuclear war, EMP, major earthquakes or volcanoes are a definite possibility, the only thing that's certain (if history is any yardstick), is that all fiat currencies will eventually fail.

And of course whatever container you use will need to be sealed from water ingress at the very least. Maybe a pelican case would do the job?  You dont want to be digging them up all the time as the ground will become disturbed and the hiding place could become more obvious so it will be vital to ensure that you record their location in great detail (and the contents); dont rely on natural landmarks to guide you as these may be eroded away or destroyed in a bushfire, landslide or other nautral disaster just when you need the contents the most!  One possible solution could be to include a large metal ""whatever"" inside the container. Then you will be able to easily locate the cache again by running a metal dectector over the surface.

I agree with that myself, and own a few, including both the original model and the new Wave. If you want a similar, albeit smaller and less expensive, but still reasonable alternative I'd really recommend the Wingman or the Sidekick depending on what tool assortment you find more useful. They're regularly available for $20 or so near Black Friday, and not much more the rest of the year, which means they're cheap enough to leave in rarely used kits or where they may be lost.  I've used more than a dozen different multi tools over more the past decade, and I have an entire drawer full of them in my nightstand. What really drives it home for me is that if I know that I'm going to do work with my hands, if I'm heading out for a hike, or I want to be sure I can fix things without having to go locate tools, one of my Waves goes on my belt when I get up in the morning."

Really, you can't go wrong with any of Leatherman's offerings.. depending what you need. Skeletool if you want the lightest weight, supertool if you want the kitchen sink. Charge is also really good.   What I really like about the Wave, is there is 2 blades, a file and  a saw that is super easy to get to without even opening it up. Also it has a bit driver, so you can get the bit driver set and have 21 different various bits for all sort of things.   It's a bit pricey compared to some other ones, but if you want reliability and the versatility of tools it offers as well as the optional bit drivers.. and the easy unfolding knife.. the Wave is my top recommendation for sure. I have other Leathermans but they don't get nearly as much use. The Wave is my EDC and I bring it in the wilderness as well."

preppers,38w9m6,R_B_Kazenzakis,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"Why do they resemble typical American cities?   Because typical American cities resemble a lot of coastal areas overseas too?  Not every city out there we may be called upon to intervene in looks like a third world shanty town.  Let me tell you a story.  In the mid 90s I live on the Presidio of San Francisco.  It had recently transitioned to a national park, but at the time the DoD had first call on the housing for any active duty personnel(recruiters, trainers for reservists, etc) in the SF Bay area.    During this time Krulak pushed the ""Forward, from the Sea"" doctrine in an attempt to push the USMC back towards it's expeditionary roots.  In addition, it was during the post ""Black Hawk Down"" era so there was a push to emphasize urban warfare training.  The West Coast Marines didn't have anywhere to do this training.  Then someone realized that there was a national park in the SF Bay area that had a lot of...empty buildings.  Most of the housing was empty.  There was a empty skyscraper on it.  The park was administered not by the NPS, but by a independent government agency charged with being ""revenue neutral"" by an act of Congress.  And in addition the former naval base at Alameda had been offered by the city to be used for the exercise, so the Marines could practice flying over bodies of waters between areas, etc.  So, a major urban exercise was schedule in the SF Bay Area.  IOW, ""typical American cities"".  Of course the people of SF lost their shit about it, and applied pressure to the Presidio to the point that the exercise only occurred at Alameda, but the the caricatures of the ultra-left that are most SF residents remind me of you and the other ""the US is gonna declare martial law any day now LOOK AT THE TRAINING"".  It didn't happen under Reagan when Ollie North ran Rex85.  It didn't happen when a compound full of assholes got set on fire by the ATF under Clinton.  But the NWO types go ""well it's gonna happen any minute now with Obama, just like they've done for every President since at least the 70s.  Tens of thousands of Servicemen have gone through this ""cities"" and forgetting for the moment that not all of the cities ""resemble typical American cities"", and you could count the number of exercise Administrators who seriously think it's all a prep for Martial Law in the US on one hand."

The Marines in 29 Palms since 2003 or so have done some exercises where they drop recon-types into the wildest, most isolated parts of Joshua Tree National Park to practice surveillance by tracking hikers/rangers without being spotted.  Exercise administrators listen to NPS dispatch and know if they failed the exercise when someone calls it in.  A lot of the stuff for the exercises accounts for much of the UFO sightings there(UAVs, helicopters etc).  NPS hates it, but the USMC denies it happens, so there isn't much they can do about it."

The more current MOUT towns extant on most larger Marine and Army bases tend to more resemble developing nations: https://bunkstrutts.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/mout-1.jpg  There's quite a variety, mostly depending on the units that are most often training there, and the major threats when they were built. You'll find that some of the newer facilities are built in a more modular fashion, so they can be reconfigured to match the current theater or training scenario, but those are rather expensive.   Still, that's a very different scenario from having an area several counties wide to use, as there tends to be a lot of administrative work and the locations tend to be small and packed together, making it difficult to simulate larger-level operations, particularly covert or clandestine operations."

If they have as much as has been estimated, it could very well create havoc with the US dollar which could lose value very quickly, resulting in unaffordable food and shelter costs for the poor -- followed by rioting and looting. It would be convenient if the armed forces were already in position to control such disturbances.   P.S. A trigger happy police officer shot and killed one soldier and wounded another because the cop wasn't aware of the military games going on at the time. This was prior to Jade Helm. I don't remember where I read the article, but as a result police who are participating in the ""games"" are now supposed to wear a distinctive uniform."
preppers,38w9m6,SkepticPrep,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:08:26 2015 UTC,I'd be interested to here more about how China's gold holdings will influence the US dollar.
preppers,38w9m6,RKBA,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:27:47 2015 UTC,"What happens if this fall China announces it has 10,000 tons of gold in order to have the Yuan included in the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDR) and that the SDR basket would also include some physical gold?  Any nation wanting to be included in the SDR basket would have to come up with an amount of gold proportionate to the amount of representation it wanted in the SDR. Note: 10K tons may be an exaggeration, but I've heard estimates of anywhere from 5K to 10K.  Now suppose that, as has been rumored, the Federal Reserve Banks have ""loaned"" out US gold reserves or sold most if not all of it (probably to China to hold down the price of gold and silver to mask inflation) and don't have nearly as much as they've claimed (Why has the Fed resisted an audit so strenuously for so many years?).  Suddenly the Fed's lies would be revealed to the world, and the realization that the US is bankrupt would be laid bare. A similar fate would befall other nations with insufficient gold reserves.   This is of course supposition on my part, but I think that at some point as the various nations take turns devaluing their currencies, we will reach a point at which the people will turn to something that doesn't continuously lose value like inflatable paper currencies, and what history shows is that they generally turn to gold. Gold is desirable because it will always have some value, and unlike fiat currency gold has no counterparty risk (ie; it isn't someone else's debt).    The bottom line is that the nations who hold the most gold will make the rules when fiat currencies are finally inflated completely away. As Tyler Perry said: ""He who has the gold makes the rules"""

preppers,38w9m6,rolahey,2,Tue Jun 9 20:02:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not aware that they are, nor can I find any reputable sources talking about specific numbers or motivations. I know Russia has been buying gold to try to hedge against the ruble's losses, but they haven't been buying unreasonable amounts, and it's a viable that's been done fairly often by countries in a similar situation. I don't know how that would be evidence that somehow Russia, China, India, and a handful of scare-blogs [and no major investment houses or economists] would see as a clear sign that there's going to be a global shift back to precious metals.   I think that's my biggest hangup. You, three other nations, and a bunch of low-rent scareblogs apparently see the future in the crystal ball, and the US government response is to spend a bunch of money training US military for a hostile takeover rather than preparing for the economic hit. It's a grand, backwards conspiracy that makes the least sense for the US government and requires the most effort.  I'd start by asking who is planning this? What's their motivation? Where's the evidence?"

I roll with a Coleman Dual Fuel 533.  Like this one here.  I vastly prefer it to any other option mostly because I can run it on unleaded gasoline and, as you may have noticed, that is a rather common fuel.    The only con to this stove is the weight.  Personally my main use of it is for motorcycle camping and that it runs off regular unleaded is a boon. I have a valve on the petcock under my gas tank and I can fill the stove off the motorcycle at will.    If weight is an issue, or I want a backup, I go with one of these.

You do need to change the nozzle in the stove to use jet fuel or kerosene.

Between that and by BBQ grill, I will be able to cook with either propane or kerosene. I live in the woods, so I could also cook with wood but that wouldn't be the easiest thing in the world.

Propane gas is more volatile.  white gas: cheaper, versatile for extreme cold, much more efficient, but a pain in the ass to use.  Their stoves are much more versatile (ie. msr whisperlite international can use several fuels).  Needs to be vapor form to ignite so there are no worries about spillage as evaporation is clean.

preppers,38t7r4,44Dave,0,Sat Jun 6 22:40:46 2015 UTC,I like propane and those fuel cubes. Propane is useful because it comes in small cznisters and can get really hot very fast. Plus it is rather abundant relatively.   The fuel cubes are nee to me but I like thrm so far. They last a good while if you don't use one cube per cooking timr. They can get pretty hot but kind of slow to get going. They can dirty up whatever you sre cooking on because they get squishy and sticky. But that really isnt an issue. What I like about rhe cubes are thr size. You can carry a hundred without adding much weight. Can't reslly do that with propane cans.   That is with cooking. I don't have a lantsrn because I use electric lights. Like flash lights. So can't really healp you there. Sorry.

That mixed with way to many Apocalyptic movies and a father that enabled the idea a little, had me believing that The Road Warrior was just around the next bend.  After I entered the military it wasn't to hard to find other like minded people. We often talked about burying our back up guns in the hills of Montana just to make sure that Clinton didn't take them away. As we all know that didn't happen.  Shortly after that was Y2K where we were all sure that the lights were going to go out forever and it was going to turn into Hell on Earth. Again, nothing happened and life went on.  At this point I had stockpiled enough guns/ammo and provisions to last whatever revolution/end of the word scenario I was sure going to happen. Not long after Y2K came and went I met and then married my wife. She was cautiously a prepper only because I enabled the idea by events like Katrina.  A few years later and keeping a healthy prepping lifestyle the economic collapse happened. We weren't prepared for that. Sure we ate out of stores for a couple of months and used our safe cash to pay some bills but, in the end we lost our.   House Car Business Wife's Job   We moved to Central Oregon to work for a past client managing his warehouse making hunting calls. Signed up for Welfare because we had two kids and could barely make ends meet. This lasted for two year until we were able to pull ourselves out of that hole and get back on our feet.  Here is what is different for us.  We still prep but, for sustainability not for the end of the world. Our prepping is more balanced with an focus on cutting costs and increasing sustainability. We purchased a home that has multiple producing fruit trees, a large garden, the community is on a private Well and Septic. We have 3k acres and 2 lakes as part of the HOA ($16mth).  Our financial health is probably our biggest prep. We have built a 3 month Safety Net, we invest $700+ month into retirement/investment accounts (not nearly enough). We've cut our outgoing down to a bare minimum, and focus on removing external debt even if we have the money.   Our lesson was from all of this is that, prepping isn't just about surviving a disaster it's about being able to live after the disaster."

Finance is something people tend to not talk about in the prep world, if only because most peppers I know are preparing for a world where your bank account, credit cards, etc simply don't matter anymore. The bank can't repo your home if there is no longer a bank.  Though, I think the chances of an event where you would need to ""survive"" for a few weeks and then back to normal are much more likely than a true shtf event, where the rules of society are rewritten, and the record of your bank statement is irrelevant.  Still though, this post got me thinking."

You might say I'm in denial, but anyway, I woke up to the likely risks: that water doesn't come drinkable from the tap, or at all, or that electricity is out for a week and heating becomes an issue. There are no excuses for a household to not be prepared for that.   So I see myself trying to find the frequently occurring breakdowns to prepare for so I handle them without changing my daily routines too much.

Second, why do stock removal? Stock removal for blade-making is fine... if you have a band saw and a belt grinder, and if you don't care about how much steel you waste. But these things probably don't hold true in a survival situation. I'm no expert, but I'd think that hot forging would make more sense. You can make a forge out of dirt, and recycle pretty much anything you can get your hands on.

It just gives the pistol a little home to live in, and most importantly, protects the trigger (I have a Glock, so no manual safety.) I believe the holster has velcro on one side, so that could be useful if the inside of your go-bag has velcro on the inside.  Alternatively, you could also secure a holster in/to your bag ahead of time, then when it's time to go, just grab your pistol and put it in the designated spot. Just some ideas."

preppers,38n9ov,MunkyUTK,4,Sat Jun 6 05:59:38 2015 UTC,"Sounds like things happened even faster than you could have imagined. That one experience will go a long way to helping you figure out what's really important, and what isn't. Great work!   As far as the documents, we try to keep originals in a fireproof box, and keep copies in our every day working stuff to ""grab and go.""  For things like Birth Certificates, it never hurts to have several ""certified copies"" on hand in various places. Many times a photocopy or scan is not accepted when a birth certificate is required.   Just curious if you had enough hose to get where you needed to go and hose things down? One of my neighbors made fun of me having about 400 feet of garden hose positioned around the 3 outside faucets until we had a large grass fire. Then he did the same thing. We also had sprinklers positioned in a plastic tub outside in case we needed to set them up when a corn field or other brush was burning nearby."

preppers,38mks6,TorchForge,7,Fri Jun 5 04:39:43 2015 UTC,"Hey All,   I'm new to this sub and I've been enjoying the material posted here. I wrote this guide awhile back but recently updated it with some new material. I mostly hang on /r/blacksmith and /r/bladesmith but I'm happy to answer any questions regarding simple/primitive forging methods for the purposes of edged tools and otherwise."
preppers,38mks6,Full_Iron_Fist,3,Fri Jun 5 04:43:51 2015 UTC,I want to say I saw some knives that look like your picture on Etsy or a custom site. Are you the dude who forges those railroad spike knives?
preppers,38mks6,SchwarzeSonne_,2,Fri Jun 5 13:44:30 2015 UTC,A ton of people do that. For many RR spike knives are the introduction to smithing.
preppers,38mks6,Full_Iron_Fist,2,Fri Jun 5 13:52:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I guess that's like asking a chef-guy like me can you make a denver omelet??  The real question: how well do these RR spike knives function? Do they hold an edge well? Do they resist corrosion? And most importantly: do you make and sell knives like this? I would rather support a fellow redditor than not."
preppers,38mks6,Full_Iron_Fist,5,Fri Jun 5 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"They work fine for light use provided they go through some form of heat treatment suitable to their carbon content. They won't break easily, but they require a lot of edge maintenance. They don't resist corrosion, but the etching process I use protects against rust. It's kind of weird to think about, but etching creates a fine layer of ""blue rust"" which then protects against corrosive ""red rust"".  Keep in mind that entire nations have risen and fallen to bronze weaponry in the past. Steel, even low carbon steel, is nothing to scoff at when you consider the entire history of man-made tools.  I make a lot of these knives. They sell fast, but I still have some available. See this gallery for current work: http://imgur.com/gallery/Da7Ki"
preppers,38mks6,SchwarzeSonne_,2,Fri Jun 5 15:52:36 2015 UTC,"Beautiful work. I've always been ok with soft steel knives; they sharpen easier and are best when working with meat and soft fruits or veggies. I love the simplicity and utility of such a knife forged from a rail spike. There is no handle to crack, or rivets to fall out, or tang to break or bend."
preppers,38mks6,Full_Iron_Fist,3,Fri Jun 5 16:33:12 2015 UTC,"Most spikes are fairly low in carbon, so they don't hold an edge very well. They are fairly durable though. They aren't stainless, so rust is always a threat, though a coat of mineral oil will keep the blade in order for long term storage.   I personally do not do any smithing, though I hope to start in the near future."
preppers,38mks6,SchwarzeSonne_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:44:11 2015 UTC,I keep a bottle of food-grade mineral oil on hand for all my kitchen knives and it makes a huge difference keeping them rust free it also helps on my sharpening stones. I get that wicked hair splitting edge.

preppers,38o1kj,rocntenr1,3,Fri Jun 5 17:16:07 2015 UTC,"Well then you can invest in personal skills and/or the stockpiling of goods.   Cash is handy in the meantime before a total collapse, and can even help you get the above skills/goods for after a collapse. And buy you a lunch too."
preppers,38o1kj,Darth_Cosmonaut_1917,3,Fri Jun 5 17:44:59 2015 UTC,"Once the US dollar collapses societal collapse will not be far behind. As you probably know, when Nixon severed the dollar link to gold, all the world's currencies lost their status as ""money"" and became fiat currencies with no more real value than monopoly money because they were based on the US dollar (the Euro was created outright by fiat and had never been linked to gold). The only reason we still use worthless pieces of paper instead of money (gold, silver) is tradition and convenience. Recently however, each nation has been trying to depreciate it's currency faster than the next nation to gain a trade advantage for their exports.         As this ""race to the bottom"" continues and ""money"" printing accelerates, eventually confidence will be lost in fiat currencies in general. Once that confidence is finally lost things can happen very quickly because no one will want to hold fiat currency and will try to convert it to something (almost anything) that's real and tangible and can be sold later or used for barter. Once the rush out of fiat currencies starts it will likely accelerate very rapidly (See the bank runs in Greece for example). The 200 Trillion or so of globally linked derivatives could collapse as rapidly as a Jenga tower when one too many support blocks are removed."
preppers,38o1kj,RKBA,11,Sat Jun 6 04:43:06 2015 UTC,"So, absolutely nothing regarding what the OP was asking.  $500 is my ballpark for what I keep on hand."
preppers,38o1kj,mydogcecil,2,Sat Jun 6 05:00:50 2015 UTC,"OP said ""In a collapse situation I don't expect cash to remain useful for long..."" Silverdollar asked why not? I was merely supporting the OPs assertion.       If you look at graphs or charts of the Weimar and Zimbabwe inflations, you'll see that everything went relatively smoothly until 1923 when the Weimar Republic's Marks were worth nothing in that single year. Zimbabwe was similar in that the currency was destroyed in a period of months.        My point is to not keep too much ""money"" in terms of US dollars or any other fiat currency regardless of whether it's being held in a bank or as paper.     P.S.  More specifically, I'm recommending that OP keep considerably more paper currency on hand than most others are suggesting because prices are likely to be much higher when the SHTF than they are now due to inflation and scarcity.  Personally I keep a couple of thousand in smallish bills on hand which I would plan on quickly spending on last minute needful things."

Personally I keep a couple of thousand in smallish bills on hand which I would plan on quickly spending on last minute needful things.   I do about the same.

preppers,38o1kj,jacksheerin,-1,Sat Jun 6 17:12:54 2015 UTC,"My definition of a real major SHTF situation is a full-blown societal collapse.  Anything less than that and I expect businesses within a short drive to be able to take credit cards within the week.  My experience has been a couple days at most.  The same time frame had the red cross and fema show up, not that I would rely on those things happening.   hopefully in small bills   Yes, one's, fives, and tens.  Last hurricane the places that were taking cash were still dropping excess money in a safe, and just couldn't keep change since most other people were breaking out their large bills.   I keep $500 actual cash on hand myself.   Can you say how you arrived at that number?  Having well stocked supplies I never even got close to using $200 in '04 and '05.  PS, edited my original post for clarity on what I meant by SHTF."
preppers,38o1kj,adoptagreyhound,3,Fri Jun 5 14:11:48 2015 UTC,"I would also take your vehicle(s) and fuel into consideration when figuring out how much cash you need. Fuel prices could temporarily spike if refineries are affected by a hurricane, so I would have enough cash to fill both vehicles twice at double the regular price in addition to what you need for other expenses. You could easily spend $ 100 filling up a gas tank on a larger vehicle if there is price spike after a disaster. (I know that price gouging is illegal, but it is possible that refineries will shut down if the path of a hurricane is forecast for the refinery which can cause supply disruptions and price increases.)"
preppers,38o1kj,EvilTOJ,3,Fri Jun 5 17:45:42 2015 UTC,"I try to keep at least $500 in cash. Not just in case of weather/earthquakes, but also for other emergencies like needing a vital (but unexpected) car or home repair, or losing a job."
preppers,38o1kj,g4r4e0g,3,Fri Jun 5 18:56:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think 200 is enough.    You need to think about what you'll need to buy with that cash.  If your goal is fleeing a hurricane, I'd say you'll mainly be looking at: gas money, lodging, and food.  How much is that going to cost?  I don't think 200 would cover it.  Of course you can lessen the need for cash by having some of these supplies on hand.     Refill the car whenever you get down to half a tank, and keep a gas can or two in the shed.  Keep a bug out bag with shelf stable foods and water. Have a bug out bag with personal items and clothes to avoid having to buy those on the road."

preppers,38o1kj,davemchine,2,Sat Jun 6 14:05:18 2015 UTC,I was away from home at a convention when 9/11 occurred. The airports and trains shut down and nobody knew when they would be available. The rental cars disappeared fast. The more affluent people at the conference bought cars to drive home. Ever since then I have thought it would be good to have a couple thousand available in an emergency.

It's also enough to buy food for 3 weeks if I eat like a collage student... Any more than that and I'm just waiting to get robbed... I share your view on shtf... If the supermarkets closed for so long that the week of food I keep in my house is gone, that I couldn't find a supermarket in the 500 km radius of my car or 300 km radius of my motorbike then money probably doesn't mean much to those around me... Maybe that's a risk but I'm happy to take it... If you're talking about prepping for losing a job or something then buy shares or stock or bonds...

As someone who lives in a mostly rural area that level of expense astounds me.  I guess people in cities would likely need more cash than people elsewhere.  What's your plan once you cross the city though?   I share your view on shtf... If the supermarkets closed for so long    Yes.  The times we've had major power (and thus credit card) disruptions here there were very few places to even buy anything on the first couple days and then most places had power after that.   If you're talking about prepping for losing a job or something   Nah, like you I keep money for that in interest bearing accounts, to fight inflation."

The US Dollar is the world's reserve currency, and the backbone of the SDR (the basket of currencies that balance against one another to maintain world trading prices).  The US liquidity well is also 15x larger than #2 (Euro) meaning that if the US went poof there is no other currency or basket of currencies that could step in.  /sigh, no, not China either. Cuz people love to pretend being #2 in GDP and #1 in PPP means they're ""basically like the US"". When in fact china's liquidity well is more than 40x smaller than the US.   My point is even the sudden eruption of Yellowstone, combined with an asteroid hitting the US, still wouldn't suddenly make the dollar collapse.  We're a very, very, very big ship that would take decades to sink.   IE: you have pleeeeenty of time to go, ""Hey, I wonder if I should start buying another currency....."".  The world will beg borrow claw and bite to protect the Dollar, not because they want to, but because they have to.  It may be replaced one day, or diminish in importance, but you'll probably be dead by the time that happens."
preppers,38o1kj,Zoe_the_biologist,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:39:29 2015 UTC,"You realize you're suggesting that a country covering 4 times zones and 4 climate zones with 320 million people, and the largest business reach on earth would systemically collapse, suddenly, and all at once, for your thought that cash will become worthless.   I don't.  Which is why I don't need to hold cash for such a situation.  Any such collapse would happen over time and I'd be able to spend my electronically held money on useful goods.  That's just one more reason I'm NOT ASKING about how much money to keep in case of such outcomes.   My point is even the sudden eruption of Yellowstone, combined with an asteroid hitting the US, still wouldn't suddenly make the dollar collapse.   Was this exaggeration for effect?  Do you really believe that if those two events happened at once that anyone would sell a gallon of gas and take US dollars once they understood what had happened?  So, my actual question was how much short term emergency cash do you hold?"
preppers,38o1kj,SkepticPrep,2,Fri Jun 5 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"Ok. I respect that answer. The problem is you said:   In a collapse situation I don't expect cash to remain useful for long    Yet there is absolutely zero scenario you could possibly paint, at all, which would render US cash useless on any time scale.   Local unrest? Neat. 3hrs north, cash is fine.  Invasion of..... who exactly? What country? China? Fun.... how'd they get here? With all their ships? Wait, they have no blue water transports for millions of humans.  Nuclear war? Cool! From who exactly?  Nuclear nations fear MAD, and terrorists can hit, what? One city? 2? Maybe. Someday.   That's not collapsing the dollar.  So tell me a situation where your statement of:   In a collapse situation I don't expect cash to remain useful for long    applies.   Because nothing you can come up with will render US cash useless.   Because even a 1hr drive, in any direction, puts you 60+ miles from a disaster, where a guy will go, ""Cash for X? Sure!"""

I really think that ""the sudden eruption of Yellowstone, combined with an asteroid hitting the US"" is one such scenario.  There are more.  I think either of those would probably do it.  If we're all in The Road's setting a year from now, nobody is interested in my dollars.  It's fiat money, that needs a backing country to be worth anything for one.  And for two I don't think anyone is going to sell anything at all for money.  The value of gas, food, or weapons will be so high (with no supply on the horizon) that the amount of needed cash just isn't worth talking about.  I only included that part of my question because I didn't want a bunch of doomsday preppers talking about emptying all of one's investment/retirement accounts to put into (inflation vulnerable) cash or silver coins.  Even still I had those answers, and answers from people who missed that I was looking for cash (not money in general).  To be clear, I don't think those scenarios (Armageddon (if they failed), The Walking Dead, The Road, Mad Max, Thread, etc) are at all likely.  It's one of the reason I wanted to avoid discussion on them.  The only ones I'd count even a little likely would be an EMP or solar flare, even those I expect money to continue to be used (maybe with some pockets of chaos where there's nothing to buy).  All of the situations you name, I agree with.  The dollar, and money in general will keep on keeping on.  I also agree with your risk assessment for nuclear war.  MAD works, nobody's invading, terrorism won't scale, etc.  I agree 100% which is why I excluded such things from my question (or tried to).  I probably should've used stronger language, like doomsday or apocalypse or something.  I might try asking this question again in a few months.  How does ""How much cash (currency on hand, not money in general) should I keep to prep for a short term emergency (hurricane's, tornadoes, etc) assuming a worst case scenario"" look?  Anyway.  We mostly agree.  I think I failed to define the kind of movie disaster (that I don't really think is possible, govt will keep working) that I wished to exclude.  If you think money will be used in the movie's I named above, that's cool.  I'm going to disagree.  And I don't think it matters enough either way at that point to really debate.  Edit: I was thinking about my list of movies, and I think walking dead was a terrible choice to include as it's clearly magic and the govt (and armed civilians) would completely avert it.  Hell, the end of the original modern-zombie film Night of the Living Dead showed posses organizing to eliminate the threat.  Also, when I say Mad Max, I mean the later films.  He was a lawman in the first, and clearly govt was around, thus fiat money would undeniably keep working."

The security team never admits openly they were  hacked, but the entire operation is shut down and the feds come in.     The ""state secrets"" they're interested in stealing are intellectual property from defense contractors.   There are only a handful of these companies and you have to realize all of the military  technology and r&d is coming from maybe 10-15 companies.    The Chinese don't create anything on their own, they rely on stealing it from other governments.  They're not interested in stealing government secrets to uncover conspiracies, they're looking for technology.    North Korea has been trained by the Chinese and are now doing the exact same thing"

As a prepper, you should understand the lunacy of not being prepared for things that are at least rather possibly going to happen.  The simple fact is that the Chinese probably don't have the best hackers in the world, but they are at least competent and looking for holes in the security of US entities involved in the government.

preppers,38jjuw,MeatCurtainRod,2,Thu Jun 4 22:00:42 2015 UTC,"I'll have to go axe, perhaps a lightweight one though. While it is not as effective at clearing brush, it can more easily break down a door and chop down a regular sized tree. Longer handle than the other options, so I can have a better grip on my tool."
preppers,38jjuw,Darth_Cosmonaut_1917,2,Thu Jun 4 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"Machete, hands-down.  Machetes are extremely versatile. I do a lot of errands on my land with hand-tools, and I find myself turning to my machete whenever I really need to get something done: clearing brush, snedding limbs, even taking down medium-sized trees. It's my go-to tool.  My preferred machete is one with a long (24"") weighted blade. That means it's very fat at the end, great for chopping, but with enough reach that you can get through tall, heavy brush pretty fast.  I have a kukri machete, which I don't like as much. Great chopping power, but not enough reach to be good on brush. The distribution of the weight on a kukri blade is also annoying -- it's good for chopping things that are on the ground, but it has just a bit too much ""snap"" if you try to clear brush with it -- makes it hard to control and pretty hard on the elbows.  I have a few hatchets, but I don't use them much."

preppers,38jq23,donvito,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"Anthrax:       Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Most forms of the disease are lethal, and it affects mostly animals. It is not contagious but can be transmitted through contact or consumption of infected meat. Effective vaccines against anthrax are available, and some forms of the disease respond well to antibiotic treatment.  Like many other members of the genus Bacillus, B. anthracis can form dormant endospores (often referred to as ""spores"" for short, but not to be confused with fungal spores) that are able to survive in harsh conditions for decades or even centuries.  Such spores can be found on all continents, even Antarctica.  When spores are inhaled, ingested, or come into contact with a skin lesion on a host, they may become reactivated and multiply rapidly.  Anthrax commonly infects wild and domesticated herbivorous mammals that ingest or inhale the spores while grazing. Ingestion is thought to be the most common route by which herbivores contract anthrax. Carnivores living in the same environment may become infected by consuming infected animals. Diseased animals can spread anthrax to humans, either by direct contact (e.g., inoculation of infected blood to broken skin) or by consumption of a diseased animal's flesh.

preppers,38b2pe,doobs2222,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:47:40 2015 UTC,Seems I spoke too soon about there being too few commercial offerings.  Repel makes something called Tick Defense and I've seen it in every Target and Walmart I've checked so far.  After a few days of testing it seems that this and the Sawyer picaridin work extremely well.
preppers,387icv,Starshooter,5,Tue Jun 2 12:15:34 2015 UTC,While I also have water purification tablets in my various bags a Sawyer Squeeze or Mini are better options. They will provide a person with clean water for an extended period of time. You only use the tablets in dire conditions when you can't trust your source to be reasonably clean.  I prefer multi-tools to swiss army knives but it's mostly a question of style. Sadly nearly all windup generators aren't worth owning. I haven't found one yet that can survive daily use for a week. That led me to getting a small solar panel to charge AA and AAA batteries or a cellphone via USB. It is a more robust solution for most of the US.  If you have a disaster happen one of the things you will almost always need are garbage bags. They can also become improvised waterproofing or shelter in dire situations. Contractor grade ones are best for this purpose.  If you're storing normal non-perishable food make sure you have a way to heat it or cook it depending on what it is. The ubiquitous home propane grill is a great option for most of us. I would have a spare propane tank.

I don't know about the solar panels as you're limited by availability of sun?"
preppers,387icv,edheler,2,Tue Jun 2 16:22:59 2015 UTC,Solar panels still work when it is cloudy. You would just need a larger panel for it to have the same output. If you don't mind it being non-portable this panel coupled with a charge controller and a 12 volt deep cycle battery are a very robust solution. Then you just need a battery and phone charger that work off of 12 volts. (i.e. a car charger)

Modern phones need a good bit of juice and in my experiments it required a good bit of effort just to gain 1% on my charge.  Much easier to lay something out in the sun for a few hours and let nature do the work for you.  You should also include a pry bar.   Good for potentially helping people get out of wreckage and also for ""letting yourself in"" to other places."

Then you gather the gear and necessities to make that a success.  Otherwise you'll just end up spending a ton of money on crap that will be never ending and if SHTF, you'll still be scrambling.  Think about what you last took camping, or with you on an extended road trip.  Those are the items you would pack in general.  Everything else is mission specific.  It's also better to invest in training first, and look at what that teaches  you about real needs vs. tacti-cool crap out there.  An EMT course is a good start since even if SHTF doesn't happen, someone is going to need medical assistance in your lifetime as nearly a sure thing."

Skimming through my audible library, I also enjoyed 'One Second After' (EMP), 'Alas, Babylon' (post nuclear war), '77 days in September' (EMP), and 'Lucifer's Hammer' (Comet).

preppers,37zqqs,Zoe_the_biologist,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:17:22 2015 UTC,"Red dot optics are pretty amazing. I like Primary Arm's brand ones because I think they are very high quality for the price. Some red dot's have a fixed magnification (4x or so) that makes them good both as a close in optic, and as a hunting optic, or optic out to 500-600 yards or so. I am not a big fan of changing optics out after zeroing them, but thats jut me.  With asthma, maybe look at training that does not involve to much heavy breathing. Power walking can build up endurance, and weight lifting usually is not to bad either. Also while you can not get rid of your asthma, a suggestion I would give would be to look at environmental factors in your life that might be making it worse. There are internet communities for controlling / mitigating asthma with diet and by investigating the things in your life that aggravate it. I remember reading about even the clothes people wear and the shower curtains etc which could be changed and used to make life better for folks with asthma. You will probably never live life without it but maybe some folks who have been there, done that with your illness can help you fix other aspects of your life and get the asthma to a point where its not as big an issue. I suggest googling forums and communities for it."

There both considered people killers/defenders. Both can be very reliable. However most SHTF situation will have you fleeing rural areas. Most people initially will still be timid and although mass panic will be starting the chances of mass murdering on day 1-3 will be low. This gives plenty of chances to flee to a rural setting. So yes, a assault rifle will be superior in the first week. But afterwards a long ranged hunting rifle that's easy to maintain will become far more valuable via hunting and maintenance."

Especially when the opposition has the stated capabilities. Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it.   If you're far enough away to safely engage, then you're far enough away to avoid conflict. Unless, your goal is an ambush. In which case, 2 4-round magazines STILL isn't going to cut the mustard. But chances are, if you're trying to avoid a fight, YOU'RE the one that's going to get ambushed.

Mags, ammo and a means of carrying them will bring that AK up to over $700, not that $529 is cheap if you make $400 (or less!) a week before taxes. After a few hundred more rounds for training, a light and a mount, a sling, and hopefully a half decent optic and a mount he is easily over $1000.  If you have the means to own some nice kit, sure, get some nice kit. But if you do not have $1000-$2500 to spend on a half decent fighting rig then you work with what you have.

You can make a sling out of 550 cord with a cobra braid. Cheap and easy to do yourself. AK ammo is the cheapest rifle ammo there is, hands down. You don't even need a rifle mounted light. You don't even need an optic, although a Vortex Sparc is pretty cheap too. I went from Um Qasr to Bdad with Iron Sights with Task Force Tarawa as an Infantryman with none of that cool guy crap.    OP asked if he should go ahead and get a different rifle. Considering his highest mag capacity is 10 rounds and the high prices of 30-06 ammo precludes any actual substantial training (again, assuming he's poor), I'd say he'd be a lot better off selling that rifle and picking up an AK. Everything about them is cheap, easy to maintain, and disgustingly reliable.   I'm not over here telling him to pick up a SCAR17, suppressor, PVS14s, Ops Core helmet, or anything of that nature.

The extra $600 gets me a flashlight, optics, and better ergonomics. Is it all worth the price? Meh.

Yes it is the point because currently you cannot rely on your prepper items being secret or private or yours.  This breaks rule #1 of prepping.  2) contrary to popular belief, a gun is the LAST item you really need to consider in a prepper world, so don't sweat what you have, and work with it.  Just stock up on ammo.  3) You can get 10 round mags as others have indicated, and you will not raise any red flags if they are legal in your locale.  IF you choose to import them in illegally, you will raise red flags somewhere along the transaction line and you are again violating the prepper rule of staying off the grid for these kinds of things.  Find pinned mags and unpin them yourself if you must.  The better option is to get a firearm that uses a much more popular caliber.  30-06 is big, and great for long distance, but an issue for close quarters where speed is more important."

Being able to survive means that you need to find unconventional methods to keep your preps fresh. This doesn't necessary mean that you need to by the tiny jars. It means that you need to look at the problem and find a solution. If a person is worried about spoiling a few spoons full of Mayo, they might as well hoard packets that you can get from fast food restaurants. That's not my style."

It is full of calories in the form of fat.  Things like vegetable oil or lard are 100% fat, more calorie dense and will last longer.

Three days hiking and camping and the mayo lasted just fine.  You can tell when it's bad because it goes kinda ""clear"" and waxy.  As long as it's still white and creamy I'd judge it's worth eating."
preppers,380gpd,Mike_Facking_Jones,8,Wed Jun 10 20:44:49 2015 UTC,"The temperature isn't the problem with mayo, contamination is.  It is shelf stable, if you don't contaminate it - it should be good.  Probably not for weeks, but if you used sterile utensils (Spoon held in the fire for a bit) and kept the lid clean - it should keep long enough to choke it all down."

No. Also, I would only use my firearm if I fear for my life or for someone around me, not to protect my property (that's what insurance is for). If you steal my car from my driveway I'm not going to shoot you as you leave. No, however there are many cases of home invasion where a firearm has been needed. None of the above. I own my gun because it's the best tool available for self defense. It's like owning a power tool; you learn to use it safely and responsibly, and keep it well maintained. It's up to each country's citizens to decide what is best for them. I have seen too much violence and corruption in too many countries (throughout history) to believe that disarming the population is ever a good idea. No. Owning a firearm is a very personal decision. If you can't come to the conclusion on your own that owning a gun has clear benefits, and can be done safely and responsibly, then I'm not going to try to convince you or anyone else. If you ask me to take you to the range to try it out I will gladly do it!"

Well, I have more than one TV, and more than one sofa.  I also have a second car.  I own guns because I want to, and because I can.  My thoughts on Australia?  I dig chicks with the Aussie accent.  I think they'd sound downright hilarious, though, if they were all speaking Japanese ...  But, if you are carrying concealed ... you don't take your jacket off.  Ultimately, though, I don't think you can make judgement of one country because of comparison to a completely unrelated one.  I really do not care what you do.  Get one.  Don't get one.  Come spend some time at the range in the lane right next to me, or come and ventilate empties all day at the quarry.   If you want a better understanding, start shooting.

I think it's great that they don't really have to worry about crime, but I feel sad that they will never know they joys of gun ownership. It's not all about defense, shooting is a great hobby.  Even if you never feel you have to use it for self defense, I am all for responsible gun ownership. In the U.S. Cities with significant gun control measures tend to have a lot of gun related crime. The issue generally isn't the legally owned guns. Responsible, mentally stable people should be able to own whatever weapon they feel they need or want."
preppers,37ylq1,xxw4rch1ldxx,8,Sun May 31 15:13:21 2015 UTC,"I live in Canada and don't own a gun but am awaiting my license to do so. We have similiar gun laws, and, for example, can only take a handgun to and from the range and require a special permit to do so - can't even legally stop for gas along the way. But we haven't had the fear mongering over knives that's been seen in Oz/UK so our knife laws are still sane. You mention the homicides rate in the US which is significantly higher. It's higher in Canada than Australia as well - about double. However Australia has a Rape rate that is 17 times higher than in Canada - frankly, if I were a woman, with those rates I wonder if I'd ever go out without being armed, even if it is against the law."

Owning a firearm is like knowing how to fight. You can spend your life training in a martial art (which using a firearm is really) and never use it. But when you need it you'll be glad you have it. Many Australian citizens fought and died during WWII knowing how to shoot a weapon. Disarming  citizens guarantees the success of an invading force or a tyrant.  Why would I bother? Come to the US if you don't like it, we'll let anyone in."
preppers,37ylq1,jackonager,3,Sun May 31 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"1: do you carry every day? If so do you carry extra mags?   Yes, every day.  Currently no on extra mag, but that's a holster issue that I plan on fixing in the near future.  The extra mag will be about dealing with magazine failure, not having extra rounds.   2: have you ever been through professional training on how to tactically use your firearm in a confrontational situation?   Yes.   3: have you ever used your gun to defend yourself in public e.g. To prevent yourself being robbed?   No.  Crime rates are actually quite low where I live.   4: have you ever needed your firearm to defend your home?   No, but with a caveat.  After a hurricane (Floridian here) someone tried to haul away the roof of my carport for scrap.  I had a shotgun.  I do not know if there would've been an issue if I had not.   5: which statement is most accurate ...   None of those are accurate.  I don't actually own a sofa or a TV though.  There's no one reason to own guns.   6: What are your thoughts on a country where ...   Different cultural norms react to different things in different ways.  I'd also point out that you should probably state homicides in rates and not in raw numbers.  Also when you guys had less gun control than now you still had lower homicide rate than America.  We're violent as a culture, have real poverty issues, and issues with our drug policy.  The number of guns in America has only been going up, and in states with registration the number of registered owners continues to rise.  Gun freedoms have been expanding in most of the culture.  During all of this violent crime rates and homicide both with gun and by other means have all been plummeting.  Crime is about culture and poverty.   7: would you convince an Australian to own a gun?   Nah.  You guys do what you want.  I happen to think my culture is great and guns are a positive in it, but I see no reason to push my culture onto other countries.   I'd love to get a better understanding of gun culture   You should know that there are two distinct gun cultures.  I'm going to overgeneralize.  The legal and largely rural culture, where a gun is a food provider, lets your defend your home, and is thee for some fun sports now and then.  Then there's the second and criminal culture."
preppers,37ylq1,fleshrott,3,Sun May 31 16:37:13 2015 UTC,"1: do you carry every day? If so do you carry extra mags?  If I'm not carrying my work gun, I'm carrying my personal gun. Depends on what I'm wearing- hot weather makes guns difficult to conceal more so if I have a spare mag. Cooler weather I carry up to two spare mags.  2: have you ever been through professional training on how to tactically use your firearm in a confrontational situation?  I carry a gun for work so yes.  3: have you ever used your gun to defend yourself in public e.g. To prevent yourself being robbed?  Only drawn my pistol once in a non work capacity, and it was a drunk/crazy guy creeping in the woods outside of the cabin scaring the girls.  4: have you ever needed your firearm to defend your home?  See above  5: which statement is most accurate ""I own a gun like I own a TV or sofa. You just need to have one"" ""owning a gun is like owning a second car, it's nice to have as a defensive option"" ""Owning a gun is only necessary for people who live in particular set of circumstances where self defence is a daily concern e.g. A bad neighborhood""   TV if I had to pick one. It's not a must to own, but it serves a recreational reason and it also serves a useful defensive purpose like having a smoke alarm and fire extinguisher in the kitchen.  6: What are your thoughts on a country where 90% of people don't know what most makes and models of gun are, have never shot one, feel awkward when police walk past with one on their belt. A country where, if you, a rational person in a calm state, took off your jacket to reveal a holster would cause your whole building to be shit down, the police to be called, you to be put in prison. But also a country also that only experienced 235 homicides in 2012.  Similar cultures exist here in states within states that are less gun friendly.  7: would you convince an Australian to own a gun?  I've had Girlfriends that grew up with no exposure and were kind of aghast when they hugged me and felt a bulge and I explained- Never had one that didn't enjoy going to range the one or more times I took them, though all of them wanted to a means to feel safer on their own they weren't ready to move to carrying, instead they listened and did things to be more situationally aware/reduce chances of being selected as a victim."
preppers,37ylq1,niquorice,3,Sun May 31 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"1: No. The laws differ from state to state. Some states allow open or concealed carry while others have a lot of restrictions on who can carry a gun. The same goes for knives. New York, for example, has very strict knife laws.            2. Professional training is required in some states, but not others. Some people grow up around guns, so they learn from their parents/relatives, while others have to learn by taking a course.              3. I've never been robbed, so no. There are a lot if cases where people have successfully protected themselves with a gun while out, but not everyone can because of local laws prohibiting people from carrying guns.             4. Again, I've never been robbed, so no. I hope I will never have a reason to use my gun in self defense, but I have one for the same reason I have an alarm system and why I lock my doors.        5. A gun is a serious purchase. It's not like buying a sofa and not everyone should own one. You should only purchase a gun if          A. You'll take the responsibility of owning a gun seriously.          B. You will actually use a gun in a self defense scenario. If you're not the type of person who can pull the trigger in a life or death scenario, then you're just providing your attacker with a weapon.     C. You use it for hunting or sport.             6. Every country is different and has different needs. Some countries need guns more then others. That said, there's a big difference between people not wanting a gun and a person not being able to purchase a gun. Guns are not just used for self defense against people, but also as protection against animals (bears in the US) and for hunting. There are a lot of people who hunt because it saves money.                7. In short. I wouldn't. If you don't feel like you will be able to use it when you need it, then it's a waste of money. In general there are a lot of benifits to having a gun. In terms of self defense guns are an equalizer. It doesn't matter how big or small you are. You don't have to worry about overpowering someone who's trying to kill or rape you. Gun ownership is a constitutional right in the US because the citizens are the last line of defense against a corrupt government. It is meant to deter the rise of a dictator and so that people can fight the government when all else fails. While this isn't necessarily going to happen in the foreseeable future, you never know what might happen in the future and you don't want to deny future generations from being able to rise up when necessary."

preppers,37ylq1,sturgeon137,2,Sun May 31 17:23:30 2015 UTC,I have carried a 1911 every day for years. Sometimes I carry a backup .38 revolver as well. Carrying spare magazines is not an issue if you wear cargo pants regularly like I do.  Several years ago I defended my life against two armed men while making a withdrawal from an ATM in a bank parking lot. Without my pistol I would be dead.   I also chased three men out of my home with a firearm when i woke up to my roommates being attacked. When you are assaulted all that civilized restraint you have about not harming people goes out the window and your training and instincts taken over.  A gun is like a condom. It's better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. It's really quite a simple concept. I see anti-gun people and people from countries where guns aren't common make a bigger deal out of firearms than is really necessary. They are tools. That's it.

preppers,37ylq1,rolahey,1 point,Sun May 31 21:44:55 2015 UTC,"American here. First you have to remember that the police take about 3-5 minutes to get to your house if you are able to call them. A bullet can inflict a fatal wound in less than a second. It's that time between when the police are called, and when they get there, that self-defense is important.   I don't own or carry a handgun but I can see why people think it's important. If you haven't lived in a place where the police are simply too busy to respond to a shooting, or home invasion, you couldn't possibly understand. The police try their hardest, but they are over worked and under funded in many US cities. Detroit is a good example. It was really dangerous just 10 years ago, and I have family over there. Detroit and Washington DC compete every year to be the homicide capital of the US. It's THAT bad.    Guns are objectively expensive... Couple hundred bucks at least   And a life has no price. It's worth quite a bit more than a gun.    Guns are often quite big... I mean even I would carry a derringer but a glock 19 probably weighs a pound when loaded   A handgun isn't that big which is why they are highly regulated in the US.    People often carry spare mags - this also seems like a lot of effort   Not to save a life.    I personally would have trouble killing a person unless there was imminent lethal threat to me.    I don't want to kill anyone either. The paperwork and liability for me is enormous. A single court case would ruin me financially whether I got sent to jail or not.  And criminals have been know to sue, and win, against self-defenders or police trying to arrest them.  That's what we face in the US.    7: would you convince an Australian to own a gun?   No. You have your culture, which you are used to, and I have mine, which I'm used to. No one is right or wrong here.   In the US, we prefer people to have the freedom to make their own decisions, rather than have the gov't make the decisions for us, implying we are all ignorant children.  A corrupt gov't with too much power, making decisions for everyone, is the whole reason the US came into existence in the first place.   For other people who live and work, every day, where there are lots of poisonous snakes, they need a small portable weapon to shoot snakes. In this situation you better learn to prevent snakebite in the first place, because the US is very short on anti-venom. There is no guarantee you will get anti-venom, at all, if you go to the ER.   In other places in Michigan, black bears are a problem, and they are getting more and more bold. People generally try to make noise to scare them away, and this usually works, but not always. And those few times where noise doesn't work, is when you need to be armed. It only takes one day you forgot your Glock, and then you get killed by a bear."
preppers,37ylq1,R_B_Kazenzakis,1 point,Sun May 31 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"Here's my honest answers.    Yes, I carry my weapon eveyday and I do, indeed carry extra mags. I'm prepared.  I have been through practical training and tactical training. This started when I was 7 years old with a BB gun. I still take courses to continue to improve my skills. Everyone should.  Fortunately, I've never needed to defend myself in public.  Yes, there were 4 hispanic men scaling the walls to the complex. All I needed to do was draw my weapon, and they scaled back over the walls. They were later arrested. I did not have to shoot however; I would have no issue doing so to protect my property.  None of those statements pertain to me. I own a weapon because it is my right to do so. I have the right to bear arms and protect myself, my family, my home, and my property. If you don't have the right to do that, there are things that need to be addressed in your country. I say this because you've said you've been robbed.  The murder rates are low however; the burglary, assault, rape and theft rates are high. Weapons can help people defend themselves and their loved ones.  I can't convince an Aussie to own a gun if it is against the law. It makes no sense. Why would you even ask that question? The whole thing is moot considering the gun laws in Australia.    The synopsis of understanding weapons in the United States is simple. Americans have the right to bear arms. This is the 2nd Amendment to the Constitution. We have the right to protect ourselves and our families and our property by way of weapons. We are allowed to stop a thief from robbing our homes, or eliminate a person trying to rape our daughters. Do you have that right?"

ASF and topside watchstander in the USN.  So the answer is ""yes"".  I didn't go out and get extra training outside of the military, if that's what you're asking.   have you ever used your gun to defend yourself in public e.g. To prevent yourself being robbed?   In public? Yes   have you ever needed your firearm to defend your home?   I've thought so.  I had an incident that made me suspect my apartment was being specifically targeted.  I work mids and I had called out that night, I was goofing around on the computer when someone tried to break into my (top floor) apartment.  Announced that I was calling the cops and he left.  Cops thought it might have just been a drunk/coincidence, but the timing was very off putting.   ""owning a gun is like owning a second car, it's nice to have as a defensive option""   Tens of millions of Americans get by without owning a gun, or carrying with them everyday.  Despite my experience I know they are statistically not needed.  That said, I don't see any reason to limit it if the individual meets his local laws/requirements.  Concealed carry permit owners are less likely than the general public to commit violent crimes.   What are your thoughts   Your decision, but it seems that Australia, as a country, is dead set on having a toothless population rather than a safe one.  You guys have laws against ""fortifying"" your homes for goodness sake.  Not only can't you not own a gun for self-defense purposes, you also can't have strong frames and heavy doors!   would you convince an Australian to own a gun?   Sure.  That said, gun ownership isn't for everyone."
preppers,37ylq1,OccamsRazorShave,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:56:01 2015 UTC,"No, Yes Yes No No None of the above. I own guns because I like owning guns, I have the right to own guns, and I believe it's an important part of our culture to focus on the rights of individuals and the states. In terms of actual utility need, I'd place the gun above the TV in terms of importance.... we haven't watched TV in 6 years now.  Obey the laws of the land. Even here in the US we have places with very strict gun regulation; New York City and Hawaii for example. Most people are smart enough not to carry their guns into these areas. You can't group the entire US in one basket. I live in a fairly rural state where we have problems with coyotes, boar, and other pests on our farms. Owning a gun is natural in this situation, and you see gun owners in Australia when the conditions are similar. The difference here is that the gun culture extends to many more people in the state, not just those with acres of farmland to take care of. Still; not everyone approves of gun owners even here.    If they were in the U.S., definitely. I feel that in countries with stricter laws you really need to make that decision for your self though, due to the time and regulation involved. Do you want a gun? Do you have the time to use it and will it justify the paperwork, cost, and surrendering of some rights? Do you have a place to properly store the gun where it won't get stolen or damaged? If the answers is ""yes"", then you've already convinced yourself. If not, it's your business."

Less guns might mean less murder, but it does not mean less crime.

He ran out of ammo because he had one magazine.  Keep in mind when the shooting starts, you go into a state almost like hypothermia.  Tunnel vision, selective hearing, loss of fine motor control, extreme capillary restriction, adrenaline dumps so hard your tongue becomes acidic and you sometime gag. Serious amounts of disorientation.  It's not uncommon to fire a round and not hear your gun go off leading you to believe it didn't.    The ammo will go extremely quick especially if it's more than one person.  Carry a spare mag.  There is no reason not to."

I plan on carrying an extra mag soon.  Not for extra ammo.  Magazines can fail, or if you have some other failure of the gun dropping mag, clearing, then putting in a new mag (instead of fumbling with the same mag in your hand) will likely be smoother.  Even those that carry for extra ammo though, it's not unreasonable for them to expect multiple attackers and/or poorer hit rates under stress and/or multiple rounds needed per attacker.  Also some folks (like my pocket carry at the office) carry a gun with very few rounds."

preppers,37ylq1,Hybrazil,-4,Sun May 31 17:53:17 2015 UTC,"Gun owners in the United States are a minority. Being a vocal minority makes individuals who concealed carry seem like a much larger % of the population than they actually are. About 10% of people in the USA have cc permits. In my state, one permit covers cc, hunting, and sport shooting. That means a lot people who have the permit got it so that it would be completely legal to transport their hunting and target shooting guns and they don't intend to carry a gun everywhere they go.  You mention gun size/weight. Everyone I know that carries owns a specific gun that is their ""daily carry gun."" It is a lighter, thinner gun that is easier to hide. They carry it in a holster inside the waist on their pants. When weight is carried on your waist several lbs would be barely noticeable, and cc guns would weigh considerably less that average handguns."

The only application I can see is possibly using dye instead of water to easily spot intruders seeing as they would now be coloured in a bright green or blue for example.

I would disagree with this portrayal, in terms of there being many different types e.g. doomers, gun enthusiasts, people that live in potential danger zones getting ready for tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes etc, homesteaders, alternative energy enthusiasts and many others. Another aspect is that it's entirely rational to plan for potential emergencies, and frankly irrational to not prepare. I'm not actually too invested in traditional media that I care either way how preppers are portrayed, I don't see how it affects me either way. Very few people know I have anything in the way of preps and it's going to stay that way.  2) I can't say I'm part of a ""movement"", I don't belong to any organised groups other than my neighborhood watch.  3) I lived through a plague and an earthquake that killed 60,000 people, it was those things that inspired me to get prepared. Although, watching recent riots on TV has inspired me to buy more guns and practice shooting more.  4) There's a spectrum of preparedness. I'm on the low end where it's more like a hobby, there's lots of people more serious than me who are off the grid and a full on sub-culture though. Respect to them, and it's those people that are good to learn from. Hopefully they answer your survey too."

We carefully selected a secure location when we moved last year. We have supplies like water and food to last at least a month if we shelter in place. We can go about 15 meters underground if necessary, or access high ground within a short distance. An easy climb for both of us if we need to get up for some reason.   We both have medical training, and full kits in bug out bags. Our skills would be an asset in any situation if the shit hits the fan.  We are not part of any survivalist movement, we're just prudent and prepared as everyone should be. It's not a sub-culture for us, just common sense, and in no way abnormal to the rest of society.  I don't think the media portrays people like us in a bad way. It's actually encouraged to have supplies on hand, especially if you live in an area prone to severe weather, earthquakes, unstable political situations, or anything else that could be a threat to your survival.

But on the other hand, there certainly are people that take this to the extreme, and those are the ones the media has focused on.  We're normal people, living our lives in a normal urban community. But we are also quietly prepared with supplies and plans in place. Simple things that most people don't have, like where to meet if you can't go back to your home.

preppers,37wd7d,Ihavenofish,6,Wed Jun 17 15:34:24 2015 UTC,"Good questions.  1) The media is there to sell advertising so they tend to try and find the controversial side of any story. In the case of  the prepared they seem to have focused heavily on the lunatic fringe. Like the other respondents I don't physically associate with other prepared folks but in a quiet and unobtrusive way go about being as prepared as I can. Like /u/bimble740 I'm not heavily invested in the media - I think you will find this is a common theme among the prepared, we approach the media with a healthy dose of skepticism so their opinion is of little interest to me/us. Even the terminology surrounding preparedness isn't something I embrace except for the ease of explaining to others why I have 40 cans of baked beans sitting in my shed.  2) I worked with someone who survived Serbia during the conflict there and his experiences and outlook heavily influenced my directions in becoming prepared. I think about history - every great civilization that has risen to prominence has crashed eventually - why would we believe our civilization/society is any different? I'm sure the vast majority of Romans in Rome thought their society was the most advanced, amazing and robust ever right up until the barbarians came pouring through the gates.  3) In the past people were more connected with the land and self sufficient. If preparedness is a reaction to anything it is to the separation between most of our lives and the means of production. As an IT person I'm in a horrible position to survive a crisis where there is no electricity - unless I prepared beforehand.  4) We have particular ways of thinking and a set of values that are unique to us as a group and quite different from the norm. We have a shared language and we also associate - usually online in forums similar to this so I would argue that the prepared in general are a sub-culture but again with reference to /u/bimble740 there are many sub-sub groups, often scenario based and sometimes location specific due to the prevalence or heightened risk of particular scenarios  Feel free to PM me if you have other questions!"

But like everything in the media it is all for show so I don't really care. I don't consider myself to be a survivalist I'm more of a prepper. In fact I can think of a few situations I would rather not survive. I was born into a prepping culture. My parents are Mormon and it is a huge part of the culture. While I left Mormonism the idea of being prepared stuck. I think the number of people will always increase in a bad economy but prepping has more to do with risk tolerance. I am strongly inclined to make a safe choice. I have life and car insurance as well as a 401k like most people. I have just added somethings to increase my safety net like extra food and water, first aid kits, car and evacuation kits etc. Nope lots of people prep and don't even know it. My parents don't consider themselves peppers but they are. So are most parents. I know several moms that have emergency pottys in their car for young kids. Ask a parent what they world do with young kids if the power went out for 24 hours from a storm and I bet you will hear some prepping plans even if it just to go ""visit"" grandma. Personally I think it's the people who don't do anything to be prepared for some basic situations are the abnormal ones. Do you have an extra house key, flashlight,  savings account, or jumper cables in your car? If so then in a small way you are one of us."

preppers,37wd7d,cierbhal,1 point,Sun May 31 01:45:36 2015 UTC,"Spooky Shark, Thanks for your interest in wanting to understand ""real preppers"".  I think most of us will appreciate that.  A little back ground on myself as a prepper; I started out with this endeavor as a survivalist.  That meaning I wanted to expand my knowledge of bushcraft and have a BOB for emergencies.  After I had what I considered a sound knowledge of that I moved into prepping a few months ago after all the riots and what not concerning the race relations in the US.  I had the ability to leave my home and now I want the ability to live for at least a month without leaving my home.  So as far as your questions, here goes:  1.Pretty much the same as everyone has said so far.  Preppers are represented as crazies who perceive an unreal threat to the populace.  Most are considered to be far right wing who don't trust the government or conspiracy theorist who read to much into events. 2. When I was in the military I was part of the Global Response Force.  This meant I had my bags packed at all times and could be anywhere in the world within 18 hours, prepared for whatever situation.  Upon leaving the military and returning to civilian life I felt overwhelming unprepared.  So I got into survival training and bushcraft.  Living in a very rural area of the south eastern US I can bug out to the woods and live comfortably. 3. I believe the prepper movement has been perpetuated from two fronts; first the societal unrest in the US i.e. race relations, police brutality perpetuated by the media, fear mongering from the media and ""prepper"" types (by this I mean people who try and scare the shit out of people by talking about Obama's FEMA camps and using the Jade Helm training operation to try and convince people that the government is about to turn in to some Fascist regime in order to make money) and secondly by all the tv shows on survival and prepping. 4.Yes.  A large majority of the population are not prepared for a 3 day power outage much less a SHTF scenario.  If you compare today's population with that of one 50 years ago, the difference in self reliance is staggering.  Most people today couldn't grow enough groceries to feed themselves if their life depended on it.  I don't know if I see a growing number of people trying to learn self reliance or if it's just because I got into withing the last 3 years.  But I think the awareness is growing. Hope this helps.  Also could you post the essay once it is finished?  I'd like to read it.  Also here are some sources from real situations regarding prepping, buggin out/in: http://www.naturalnews.com/040249_Bosnia_preppers_survival_strategies.html  http://www.themodernsurvivalist.com/forums/general-discussion/12-survival-lessons-from-ukraine"

preppers,37wd7d,crankypants15,1 point,Sun May 31 15:56:52 2015 UTC,"1.How would you say preppers are represented in the media, and if you disagree with the common portrayal how would you like to see it change?  As stated by many others, I believe preppers are generally portrayed as lunatics on the fringe of society. To a certain extent, I don't think this needs to change at all. The less people who are curious about what we may or may not be up to, the better. Sometimes it's a very good thing to be underestimated and/or dismissed by society. Just as Henry David Thoreau took great pride in living a solitary woodland life that his average neighbors found mystifying, so too do preppers take some small pride in being misunderstood by the masses.  2.What made you want to be a part of the survivalist movement?  First off, it's not a ""movement"" in the sense that there isn't any semblance of organization to it. We are merely a loose conglomeration of people who view the world differently, and prefer not to take the comforts of civilized society for granted. Personally, I had to take an unexpected trip to the ER one day, and afterwards realized that I had virtually no first aid in my home. I decided to remedy that situation. After securing more than enough first aid for day-to-day emergencies, I started thinking to myself, ""what else might I need around here, especially if I found myself in a situation of civil chaos?"" At that point, I started doing more research and buying more things. It was only as I embarked on this journey that I gradually began to realize that there are a whole host of people out there who think along the same lines as me.  3.Would you consider preppers a reaction to any societal phenomenon, and if so, how?   In a grand sense (and I'm mostly speculating here), I think this is a reaction to the increased perception of incompetence among our elected officials, and the growing perception that our government may have passed the point of no return as far as issues like corruption, encroachment of civil rights, and a general uneasiness about the direction that our modern society is headed.  Historically speaking, this same general unease was also common throughout the populations of Europe before the outbreak of World War One. In the decade or so leading up to 1914, everyone had a distinct and uneasy sense that a war was looming, yet nobody had anything more than vague speculations as to how it might erupt. (Read ""The War That Ended Peace,"" by Margaret MacMillan for more info.)  4.Would you consider preppers a distinct sub-culture outside of ""normal"" society?  As I stated in Q1 and Q2, I think that preppers are happy to think of themselves as outside the mainsteam, yet I would largely reject the claim that we are an independent sub-culture. As others have already said, preppers come from all walks of life. Some are green enthusiasts who merely care about protecting the environment, while others have more libertarian/ anti-establishment leanings. Still others, and these are sadly the ones who get the most publicity, believe that the world is moments away from an apocalyptic cataclysm of biblical proportions.

If the water was warm enough, I wouldn't complain, but it was cold enough to endanger me.  I've been lost in exploring the woods where I had to find food, but didn't know a thing about it, and berries were not in season.     Would you consider preppers a reaction to any societal phenomenon, and if so, how?   I think there have always been people who think the country is going to shit. We've watched gov't missteps, and corruption get worse over the years.  We can see where the trend is going, and it's not good, but there is not guarantee something major will happen. But with the internet, wider communication with a wider audience has become much more easy, so it's easier to connect with like-minded people.    Would you consider preppers a distinct sub-culture outside of ""normal"" society?   Yes. I'd say most of us either think ahead, can understand why gov't is failing, or have even been on the wrong side of the school of hard knocks, and never want to be there again. Most other people don't want to think about it, or have never been hit in the face with how harsh real life can be.   ""Better to have it and not need it, than need it and not have it."""
preppers,37wd7d,rolahey,1 point,Sun May 31 18:08:12 2015 UTC,"1) Preppers are painted as a fringe element, certainly. I think is mainly because of the normalcy bias the majority of the country has. An example that comes to mind is that of Eric Frein (if you don't recall, he is the guy that ambushed PA state troopers killing one). Frein was enough of a nut simply because of what he did, but the media felt compelled to add on to the story by reporting his background as a survivalist. He did not do what he did because he is a survivalist (prepper).   2) I spent 22 years in the Army and through many years of training for and planning missions and operations, I learned that risk can be mitigated through planning. That's all prepping is really - mitigation of risk through planning. Something is going to happen that will change life as we know it. I don't have a ""favorite"" scenario, but I certainly know that the only person I can absolutely count on to help my family is me.  3) There are some preppers I have met that were enamored by what they saw on TV shows. It could be considered faddish. Some were motivated by incidences either witnessed (watching the relief efforts to Katrina) or experienced first-hand. First-hand experience is certainly a powerful motivator. Not sure it that would be considered a phenomenon. There is a ""fear culture"" of certain doom played out in the media. Just about all news reports deal with something to fear... that could be it.  4) In my eyes, what I do in regards to prepping is perfectly normal. Those that choose to do nothing to prepare themselves are outside of normal to me."
preppers,37wd7d,Bloodmoonwolf,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:03:31 2015 UTC,"Preppers are looked at as crazies and fools, because the media portrays them in that manner. Just watch an episode of Doomsday Prreppers and you'll see what I mean. They look like blooming idiots for the most part. Sorry to my contacts who actually did the show. In my opinion, a prepper is someone who does all they can to ensure that their family will be safe in the event of a horrific situation.  There is no survivalist movement. That's silly talk. There have been preppers for centuries. Just look at the Mormons. They have been been prepping forever. My family, not Mormons have been preppers for generations however; people called us eccentric. Prepping is a common sense thing for those who want to take care of their families.  Did you live in a rabbit hole when Bin Laden took out the World Trade Center buildings? This is always in the minds of Americans. Yes, but that was NOT societal phenomenon. It was a blatant mass murder of innocent people by a group of religious zealots who did not understand the teachings of their own ""good book"". Why do you think more people have concealed carry permits these days. They want to be able to take out anyone who attacks our country.  Prepping is not a sub-culture of normal society. Personally, I consider that an insult and as an adjunct professor, whoever said that needs review. Prepping is simply ensuring that you are ready for the issues that could effect your area, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, etc.  We are not lunatics, contrary to popular believe. We are simply people who understand that bad stuff va happen, and do what we can to ensure that our families are able to survive. It's that simple."
preppers,37wd7d,PericlesMortimer,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:46:16 2015 UTC,"1) Preppers are displayed as crazy lunatics with too much money and time. This is thanks to the Doomsday Prepper show spotlighting a few lunatics and bad media. What I would like to see is how a few preppers survived actual disasters like the flooding in Texas right now.  2) I have always been a survivalist, long before I learned about prepping and what a survivalist even was. I carried survival gear like a knife, and lighter because you never know when you will need them. No I wasn't a boy scout, but I had a purse full of gear for different possible scenarios. Then I started learning about disasters and wondering why these people didn't have what they needed to survive (why would you live in tornado ally without a decent storm shelter?). From there I kinda joined the movement.  3)I believe survivalist and preppers have been around for hundreds of years. However the increase in them started with disaster and end of the world movies and shows like Survivor and Doomsday Preppers. Once media gave a name to what these people did, it became a phenomenon that spread. Fear spreads quickly, especially with access to social media and biased news. I'm sure a lot of people have prepped for riots in their cities due them being in the new a lot.  4) This really depends on your definitions or preppers, survivalists and what is ""normal"". For a lot of us, being prepared for whatever life throws at us is normal. Plus there are many levels to being a prepper or survivalist. Some are at the low end and carry an overnight bag in-case they need a change of clothes or have to stay in a hotel. On the high end, they own fully decked out bug out vehicles that they drive everywhere."

Most importantly here (in my opinion) would be production of alcohol, specifically ethanol. In a survival situation this gives you access to sterile fluids for cleaning/drinking, it gives you fuel, and it gives you the ability to produce something that can be sold/bartered as well.   I may be biased though, since I am a chemist :)"
preppers,37ulto,headhunter_blue,3,Sat May 30 15:23:43 2015 UTC,I could probably Google this but is there a good resource you can recommend for learning this process and what gear to acquire to do so in both static and dynamic situations?
preppers,37ulto,thinkwalker,3,Sat May 30 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"Any general organic textbook has all the correct information in there, but it is just not consolidated into a ""This is how you build a backyard still"" section. I will try to find a good resource online, but I am also a bit hesitant about googling things like ""how to build an easy backyard still""  This actually prompts me to think of another survival skill....The ability to wade through technical diagrams/descriptions and adapt  to the available resources. The MacGyver skill I guess.   Back to the topic at hand, this is almost never something you can do in a dynamic situation. This process is essentially split (very generally) into two parts. The first is making biological molecules produce ethanol, ideal for survival situation because you wait while yeast does the work. This requires a lot of time, and this ""reaction"" would be quite heavy. The second element is distilling the product. This serves to both sterilize/purify the alcohol (higher and lower weight alcohols can be toxic), as well as concentrate the ethanol to make it more portable etc. The gear/timing elements of this part would also not be ideal for moving around frequently. The reason the ATF finds so many stills out in the woods is because they are not very portable, so people try to hide them in very remote locations.   Edit : Stills can also be used to purify water, some people may argue this is also a good use of a still's utility. I forget these things sometimes when I get excited about the idea of making booze."

I sometimes imagine that an upswelling in the mid-atlantic will nudge the US and set off a huge chain of seismic events. It's a ""Look behind you!!"" situation that will begin deep under the ocean where no-one is looking. The clue will be when all the under-sea cables get snapped.  Being in the UK I think about what would happen on this side of the Atlantic. Large parts of Ireland, and Western England would be flooded, in a worse case scenario London would be overwhelmed by displaced water but the European land mass will remain secure resisting movement to deflect it all towards the US. (Sorry folks)  More recently I think the starting point will be more to the south and the UK will escape the worse effects, so South America will be pushed northwards crushing the US and again triggering the fragile areas (New Madrid & Yellowstone)  until all that pent-up energy arrives in California which will then be pushed into the Pacific."

Creek was fine, but ground was so soggy driving nearly anywhere was a gamble.  Even places normally pretty firm were just soft quivering jelly.  Ended up parking at the gate and walking in with cooler and stuff strapped to one of those garden carts/wagons with 10"" tires.  Easy enough.  If I did retire out there, I would have to be at peace with getting mud-stranded from time to time.  The creek does go from 0 to 6' deep torrent in a heavy rain, but it passes just as quickly.  On the plus side the grass is thigh high and my little sunchoke garden looks healthy.  Last fall I planted some tree seeds (monterry oak acorn, mexican plum, and pecan).  Maybe they'll come up.

I've no doubt the media puts a spin on it, but ...  But I personally know someone who has lost her house, dog and cats, and almost her husband to , to the flooding.  The entire stretch along that particular river has, at a minimum, a few score of ruined, demolished homes.   And I know rivers 60 miles in all cardinal directions all have been flooded out.  I don't think a death toll of 30 is ""blown out of proportion"" and I think that if you expect hundreds dead before you consider something bad, perhaps you're the one who has been most affected by the media.  heck, right downtown, middle of Austin, even the common, normally drive dry cricks, nothing more than seasonal streams,  decimated a good stretch of their neighborhood as they flooded over.   The gully directly behind my house is normally a 7' ditch, and I've never seen a lick of water in there in the heaviest rains till it started flowing and nearly overflowing this year, and the same goes for several cricks/gully's I know around the area.  Greenbelts and State Parks are flooded over, and a few low water crossings have been, continue to be, and will be closed for some time now.  There are entire neighborhoods and regions that have been routed ""the long way round"" and will be for a while.   Yes, we needed the rain, can't doubt that - but we're still about 50% below any watermark norm considered ""full"" or ""out of the drought"" - although I've had a few people argue the point on what a drought is.  Anyhow...   you asked how we are and how the preps helped - We're Okay, minus our friends house/family.  A few of our friends had to mop a bit extra, but noone else lost their house.    Preps that helped were the basics - knowledge and awareness and a plan.  I distinctly covered what was happening regularly with the weather, and took a look through the maps / plans to see what needed adapting.    As far as gear, it was update the storm gear - flashlights, batteries.  Pulled out the heaters and made sure I could do the essentials.    If there was an area I lacked, it was fresh water preps.  I've got more than a few gallons stashed, but I get nervous about that, even if it is wildly raining.  I have a friend with a few thousands gallons of rain water catchment, and they've been chuck-full for a few weeks now.  Very jealous.  Anyhow, that's my synopsis.    Good luck out there everyone!"

preppers,37p275,complexisgood,3,Fri May 29 11:37:15 2015 UTC,"I upvoted him. The reason? A .40 is a compromise round that isn't really as good as a 9mm for penetration, and isn't as good as a .45 for sheer knockdown, and has the drawbacks of both.  There is nothing ""wrong"" with 40.....but I can't think of a single reason I'd go with .40 instead of .45acp.  Also lots of cops use .40 and hate it. They have to worry about penetration through the target and hitting other things, and that the .40 doesn't drop a 200lbs man like a .45 does....and at the same time, they can't carry as many rounds as a 9mm that could easily do the same job a .40 could."
preppers,37p275,Zoe_the_biologist,9,Fri May 29 12:25:16 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of good loadings in .40.   There is an argument that shot placement over  raw energy in non magnum pistol rounds wins, but .40 is not in anyway a bad round. I get one or two less rounds, maybe 3 less in some large capacity offerings, compared to 9mm, and I get a larger projectile that transfers more energy into what I shoot.  I like 9mm, but the argument of 9mm being comparable to .40 in power usually relates to larger beaver +p loadings compared to standard pressure .40, and the +p or +p+ stuff is pretty expensive and about as sharp on the recoil as .40.  Ultimately I have 9mm pistols, .40 cal pistols and some 1911s in .45.  I don't feel unarmed with any of them and if you know how to shoot all are good rounds. .40 is a pretty proven round, and I will continue to feel comfortable protecting myself with a firearm loaded with .40"

My 7.62 conversion works great, I wont win any high precision shooting matches but i can hit a rabbit sized target at 100 (i need more practice with it). The easiest way to go is finding a complete 7.62 upper and then some 7.62 ar magazines, ARSTONER sells them. If you want to build your upper then the only things different are the barrel and bolt carrier group.

preppers,37p275,permeithal,3,Fri May 29 12:11:59 2015 UTC,"I love my 10mm too but if that's your primary plan for dealing with Alaskan wildlife you're going to have a bad time.   Edit: Downvote me all you want guys; not gunna change physics. Even a 10mm, even a hand load or Buffalo Bore which are way hotter than you typically find, does not have close to the sectional weight, penetration, or energy even at the muzzle to promise reliable quick kills on brown bears, moose, etc. Can it work?  Sure. You can kill a bear with a .22lr if you hit it in just the right spot. Doesn't make it a good idea. The lower your projectiles energy and and lower its cross sectional weight the less of a wound cavity it makes and the more shot placement matters.  If you're PLANNING on trusting your life against big game against a pistol, any pistol round: You're an idiot. Fact. Backup weapon?  Fine. 10mm is close to your best choice for that at least for semi auto rounds."
preppers,37p275,rocntenr1,2,Fri May 29 09:29:31 2015 UTC,"Any weapon is a last resort. People here seem to have the mentality that as soon as you see a brown bear 500 yards away in Denali, you grab your trusty oper8r SCAR17 and unload 20 rounds into its skull.  Not the case.  I hike and go backpacking all the time here. Bears simply won't attack you if you don't surprise them. A $5 bear bell is infinitely more effective than whatever 20lb rifle you carry while you're backpacking.  At Catmai one time a brown bear was maybe 5-10 yards away. We clapped our hands and it shuffled away...  I trust my life much more on my wits than any materialistic thing.  So, carrying a Glock 20 with Buffalo Bore ammo makes way more sense to me in my experience."

People here seem to have the mentality that as soon as you see a brown bear 500 yards away in Denali, you grab your trusty oper8r SCAR17 and unload 20 rounds into its skull.   I completely concur with this statement.    I trust my life much more on my wits than any materialistic thing.   I also completely concur with this.    So, carrying a Glock 20 with Buffalo Bore ammo makes way more sense to me in my experience. At Catmai one time a brown bear was maybe 5-10 yards away. We clapped our hands and it shuffled away...   Maybe. I've had quite a bit of experiences with bears, moose, and other dangerous wildlife. In general you are correct; noise or other methods scare them away well. I've also seen though that in dry springs Bears and other creatures can come out of hibernation/long winter with a lot more aggression than is commonplace.   While a 10mm is a good backup, my 7lb guide gun is also a good choice and easy to carry in situations which may warrant it.  I'm not against pistols at all and that wasn't my point, I just feel that if you're planning to be able to deal with a truly dangerous situation a rifle is usually the better choice if it is at all feasible. It won't be for some so more power to your pistol."

preppers,37p275,Kidoppay,1 point,Sat May 30 20:16:31 2015 UTC,Glock 22 ( .40 ) would be a good choice because you could put a 9mm barrel in and have the ability to use two different ammo types.

preppers,37p275,FlosCarmeli,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:57:55 2015 UTC,"I will always go for common rounds. When SHTF, you can stock pile as much ammo as you want but if your plan is to bug out, as mine is, it will weigh you down and eventually run out.   The way I see it, scavenging will be a good tactic when it comes to ammo. I would lean to things you are likely to find on people/in abandoned places. Such as .308, .223, 9mm, .45 and even .22"
preppers,37p275,illiniwarrior,2,Thu Jun 4 20:27:54 2015 UTC,That's why I went with 40 for my pistol. On the east coast all the police department that I know of carry. . 40cals so there would be a good amount I would hope. Also I plan on buying a 9mm conversion kit.
preppers,37p275,Jackson3125,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"i agree with common rounds. you don't wanna go trying to find 10mm rounds when the shit hits the fan lol.  i have a .45 pistol, a 9mm pistol, and a .45 carbine with a 4x32 scope, shoulder strap, and tactical flashlight in my gun go bag (it's a canvas range bag). in that bag are all my magazines, and 200 rounds of never-touched ammo.  i feel like a 45 is a good solid takedown round, and i can shoot pretty damn tight with the carbine w/scope up to 75-100 yards. you should have no more than two kinds of ammo, and i like that i have .45 in close or ranged combat (the pistol is pretty accurate, i usually shoot 25-50 yds with it).  more important is making sure you have holsters and/or straps for your arms. surprisingly, a lot of people don't get holsters for their guns. i see a lot of guys at the range just kinda putting their guns down anywhere they can lol. not the best idea if you're in the mud or snow or something..."
preppers,37p275,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:30:46 2015 UTC,Yea I certainly agree with only having a view different calibers. I was thinking of getting the keltec sub 2000 in 40cal and then a 45cal pistol somewhere down the line.  I keep all my pistol ammo and mags in my go bag as well. Makes the most sense. I also bought a holster nearly right away. If the shtf I dont wanna have to throw it in my pocket and hope for the best!
preppers,37p275,GeneralTS,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:50:53 2015 UTC,"the keltec sub2k is awesome. i have a hi-point 4595TS carbine. it's ugly as hell, looks like a planet of the apes gun, but goes bang every single time i pull the trigger. i have a scope that i sighted in, and it's super accurate. it also has picatinny rails all over the god damn thing so you can mount anything you like, basically anywhere (bipod/grip/whatever). lots of gun snobs shit all over hi-point, but i've had mine for years and they've never given me any troubles. i also have the hipoint 45JHP, so the mags are interchangeable from the carbine to the pistol. THAT is important to me. less mag types, less ammo types etc. it's also tough as hell, like AK style tough. you can drop it, throw it in the mud (not barrel first durrr lol), whatever. keep it in the truck, it'll still fire every single time. check out the 4595 TS if you get a chance, you might love it like a lot of us do."

A change of clothes would be helpful.  If she works in heels or dress shoes, a pair of sneakers would be a good idea.  A bag that she could comfortably carry over a long distance would be better than a duffel bag.  Some food would be good, but be sure to rotate out as it expires.

I keep about 8-10 bottles of water in a small cooler that I picked up at the thrift store, in the car trunk year round. I just rotate it out every 6 months or so if it doesn't get used. Since you are on a budget, it might be a good option instead of the expensive canned water, or water in cartons.  The water in cartons (Aquablox) does keep well in a car trunk also. Warm water is always better than no water at all. ( I used a cooler just in case one of the bottles splits or leaks. It was better than having it leak in my emergency kit.)"

In a probabilistic sense, even if you are exceptionally well-armed, physically able, and skilled, the chances of sustaining a life-threatening injury is multiplied significantly if you have to intimidate, hurt, or pursue someone every time you want to score a meal.

Kind of like when Andrew came up and kicked us in the butt.  My main concern with hurricanes is the fact that after Wilma, people were without power for a month where I am. I don't have to rely on FPL, but people if people saw the panels, it could be a problem. I know people who were robbed during that time, simply because they had some cans of food.

preppers,37n3ff,culady,7,Thu May 28 21:07:50 2015 UTC,"I carry one, but literally every time I have seen a car on fire, it was too far gone very quickly for the extinguisher to have done anything. In one case, we were in a rest area on the PA Turnpike, and I had to wake up a guy sleeping in the back seat to tell him his car was on fire.  Fire had already penetrated the passenger compartment through the firewall at that point.  By the time we pulled the suitcases out of the car trunk, the car was totally in flames.   Any consumer store has extinguishers designated as Marine / Auto. You only get a quick blast out of them, and I would probably only use mine if I needed to suppress flames quickly to get someone out of a vehicle. The chances of it putting out much of a fire are slim."
preppers,37n3ff,adoptagreyhound,2,Thu May 28 22:27:20 2015 UTC,That's sensible

preppers,37n3ff,forzion_no_mouse,3,Thu May 28 21:19:56 2015 UTC,This is a good one. It's rated for flammable liquid and electrical fires.  The only use case for this would be putting out a small fuel fire or a developing electrical fire in the engine compartment or something (most common scenarios). Many car fires are electrical in nature and can be stopped early by such a fire extinguisher. Anything more serious means you must abandon the vehicle. Keep your insurance up to date.
preppers,37n3ff,Esotericism_77,2,Sat May 30 04:14:22 2015 UTC,"I keep one that fits under the drivers seat. You don't use it on a full on car fire, or a tanker fire. Just when the cars smoking and you see flames but before it becomes out of control"
preppers,37n3ff,Zoe_the_biologist,2,Fri May 29 02:29:00 2015 UTC,"Two things to think about, if a car is smoking heavily under the hood, don't open it. It can turn a smoldering fire into a full blown one. Second, pit distance between you and the car while still staying around. I can't count the times we would roll on scene and think someone was shooting because exploding tires or tanks would send shrapnel at us."
preppers,37n3ff,Bloodmoonwolf,2,Fri May 29 04:25:08 2015 UTC,"A couple of wool blankets can also buy time. Throw them over the fire, or create a temporary wall. You can throw a wet one over someone in the car while you wait to get them out, but try and keep it wet with a hose if you can.  They will burn eventually, but not as quick as most other blankets, and the wet ones take a long time to catch and even them mostly just smolder."
preppers,37n3ff,Bloodmoonwolf,2,Fri May 29 13:03:47 2015 UTC,"I know some people are saying it's not worth it, but it wouldn't hurt. Who knows what will happen. Maybe you are somewhere and someone drops a cigarette in the dry grass and it catches fire, or a grill or picnic fire gets out of hand."

preppers,37m7iw,Arowx,6,Thu May 28 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't plan on stone-age. There was a great segment on the Skeptic's Guide to the Universe podcast about this, I'll see if I can get permission to clip and share the audio. Essentially the idea was that an EMP or similar crash of all the technology woulnd't send us back to the Stone Age or Bronze Age or Iron age, but rather would shuffle us back piecemeal.  Example: Our medical understanding is still pretty advanced even  if we don't have all the technology, so it's not like we're going back to the Four Humours or Homeopathy or anything, but we also won't have the same access to drugs and higher-tech care. Medical care will be more akin to what you currently see in the less developed areas, at least until power and supply lines can be re-established.   Similarly, a lot of the stuff we had working in the nineteenth century in terms of metalworks, power generation, and communication could be fairly quickly restarted with the literature available at your local library. Most of what will be lost will be the expertise that can't be written down, and must be relearned.   Now the interesting close to the segment was that we would not necessarily go back to the twentieth or twenty-first century as we know it. The big driver of the twentieth century was cheap oil, and secondly lots of war-debt, right, so lacking those two things it's hard to say we'd see the same progression of technology.   So, no, I guess, but some guides on pioneer life, textbooks, and if I can encourage you to start reading up on history and science now, allow me to do so."

preppers,37g1cj,PrepperModerator,10,Wed May 27 10:50:16 2015 UTC,I tested my bread making skills. I was able to make 21 loaves in a day. (Later given to food bank volunteers) Which means that in a short-term crisis I could feed my neighbours as a step towards community cohesion.  I will repeat the exercise a number of times applying restrictions until I have experience mass producing flat bread over a wood fire which is a concept I discussed on this forum a few weeks ago.  I have done lots of gardening and I am on target to harvest a full years supply of a range of vegetables. This years harvest should be the biggest I have ever produced.
preppers,37g1cj,BagOfBrokenBits,3,Wed May 27 16:46:13 2015 UTC,"This is by far one of my all time favorite comments in the ""what did you do this week to prepare"" threads.   It's uplifting to see a comment about someone concerned for the community and how to assist others that will potentially have needs greater than ours in times of struggle. No matter the definition of struggle. And especially when we are in a position to share with the community.   Kudos to you."
preppers,37g1cj,moonpurr,3,Fri May 29 06:37:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you :-) Preppers live in all kinds of situations. I live in a UK city and in any kind of crisis I am staying put. We have no wilderness to run to.  My preps are strong enough that I can give some thought to wider issues without any loss to myself and in my situation that's the pragmatic approach.  I am always aware of my less able neighbours and I also know who the shady characters are, but everyone has some useful skills.  I stay on good terms with all my neighbours in any case but in a crisis life will be better, and the recovery quicker, if we pull together against the greater threat. There is self-interest in this approach as my building becomes a fortress if we work together and if we organise then we can keep the area safe for all of us."
preppers,37g1cj,BagOfBrokenBits,2,Fri May 29 07:40:59 2015 UTC,You have a solid plan indeed.   Some might consider me a prepper but I identify as a homesteader. Our area consists of folks who's generations of family members have all grown up together and we are a very tight knit community.   My family and I focus on sharing our abundance with others. We also volunteer to assist people in our community with setting up gardens and edible food forests and teaching seed saving. Food security is a huge issue on an island.   I commend you for the work your doing.
preppers,37g1cj,moonpurr,2,Fri May 29 18:17:35 2015 UTC,"If it becomes possible I will move out of the city and have a small-holding but I am currently able to produce more food each year than I can eat. I have learned to preserve what I grow so my prepped food stocks increase almost accidentally.  I hold with the concept of ""Tithing"" in the sense of sharing whatever good fortune or good harvest I have with others.  I have one space which is planted with ""Three layers of garden"", that being trees, bushes and ground level fruit. I also grow a ""Three Sisters"" garden which is amazingly productive.  The UK main-stream is currently unable to produce food for its own needs but many people are taking it upon themselves to correct this problem for their own families. The cities here are vulnerable to any world crisis and there will be social unrest in the near future. I have said there will come a time when all the food in the Food Bank is handed out at tables at the doors and we will have a warehouse holding nothing but dust, and people will have nothing to donate."

preppers,37e2eb,shizam99,1 point,Tue May 26 23:15:09 2015 UTC,"IMHO the lean to is a terrible design for a survival shelter. You are open on 3 sides to all the elements, its only water proof if the rain is falling the right way, rain can run down all those support poles and onto you and with strong enough winds, you could lose your shelter.  I always make debris huts. They take longer to make, but they dont  NEED a fire to be warm, because they are naturally insulated. They are protected on all sides from wind, rain and any other elements. The only place they are open is the small hole for the door, and that can be fixed fast. They will also take alot more wind than a lean to. I personally feel like they are better camouflaged than a lean to aswell."

preppers,37h0n4,NinjaSmurf,1 point,Wed May 27 18:23:33 2015 UTC,"Heat is transferred by Advection, Convection, Conduction and Radiation.  Mylar works by reflecting radiation and ever so slightly as an insulator (reducing conduction).   A thermos flask works with a mirror coated vacumn.  The mirror coating reflects radiation and the vacumn reduces conduction and convection (between the inner and outer skins).  My recommendation (albeit 9 hours late), is to wrap the beers in a blanket and then cover that in the mylar."
preppers,37e787,dessertstormmyass,9,Tue May 26 23:51:27 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't think the show is representative of the Average American Prepper. And when people gather (here) to talk about prepping, they like to talk about sexy stuff, like guns and shopping. It's not as sexy to say ""hey, so I bought these new jumper cables and a value-pack of batteries! Oh and rice!""  We have a HUGE country, with every possible combination of weather fuckery, huge areas of economically depressed fuckery in some form, and many people just don't trust the government. And/ or their neighbors. So, I feel like we have such a wildly diverse selection of shit storms to prep for. There's something for everyone. And we want to be able to take care of ourselves. I don't know how to use the word sisu in context, but I feel like it somehow applies. We want to handle whatever life can throw at us, and everyone's preps are different.   I'm in metro Detroit. So I'm prepping for weather-based power outages and my pantry is stocked because food never really gets much cheaper than now, overall, and the employment situation is never TOO secure. I live frugally, have a big garden, actively train my dog and myself for home defense, and sleep well knowing I do my best to be ready. I don't live in a high state of alert, but I'm always aware. I don't own a gun, but I have 180lb dog. I don't worry about water storage, but I've never learned to hunt.   My neighbor is prepping for civil unrest in Detroit heading our way. He's got a huge false closet gun cabinet, 2 caches buried in the yard, and lots of not so nice things to say about non-Caucasians, most notably our President. He thinks someone will knock on his door any day to search for weapons because ""he's on a list somewhere."" I don't think he's right, but I respect that he's ready if he is. We're not friends, but we get drunk and daydream about the end game - a cabin in the woods away from the city.   TLDR - Prepping is a broad umbrella and we're a very large, very diverse country, with our share of problems. Reality TV and Reddit are not representative imo."

Pic at the top of this post. He's  a pretty well-behaved dog, but stubborn and opinionated on things when it comes to training. It's slooow going. He can start barking on command, but won't stop on command. : /  I am so, so very jealous of all your newfies, I would like to sleep in the pile of them. Big dogs are my favorite."
preppers,37e787,PepperPreps,1 point,Fri May 29 10:12:18 2015 UTC,"Don't know why I can't access the pic. Danes really don't have a really long muzzle. Are you sure you don't have something more arrogant like Afghan Hound mixed in? They are relatively tall, lean with thin legs, a long and narrow muzzle and the attitude of a cat. ""I do what I want, when I want, and you can't make me do what I don't want to do at the time"". Most sighthounds have the attitude and long muzzle. I wish I could access the pic.   Just for your knowledge, there are other breeds with webbed feel like the Lab, Portuguese Water Dog, Chessy, and Field Spaniel. It's not only the Newfie with webbed feet.   On the rare occasion, it gets chilly where I am. I am quite grateful for having Newfie blankets, when that happens.   To train stop barking on command, get yourself a spray bottle from the dollar store. Give the HUSH command, and put your finger to your lips as you would to tell a child to hush. Should the dog continue to bark, a quik spritz with water and a firm, NO HUSH is needed. This might take a few days, but usually works.   There are dogs that do not respond to the water bottle technique. Oftentimes, they respond to the shaker can. All you need to do is put some dried beans inside of a cleaned, empty can. You'll need to completely seal the can with duct tape. Dried beans can kill animals as they expand in the stomach. Just a head's up. When you give the  HUSH command and it is ignored, toss the can in the dog's direction. DO NOT TRY TO HIT THE DOG. It is simply a distraction effort and then you give the HUSH command again. With time, the dog will understand he is supposed to be quiet.   Let me know if you need further help with the dog. I'm an AKC Cert  judge and have been breeding, training and rescuing dogs for years.   Hope I helped."
preppers,37e787,rolahey,1 point,Sat May 30 02:53:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe imgur would work - Hamish I think he has some type of hound in there, he's got an amazing howl. Thank you for the thorough response!  The water doesn't phase him, and he's scared of the shaker can (pretty sure he was abused/hit at some point before I got him - I've had him for 5 years, and he still spooks at some loud noises or fast movement. He just runs.)The only time he's been hit by me is when he bit me for trying to take his bone, and I reflexively whacked him to make him let go of my arm. He's never done it again. (thankfully because it scared the shit out of me... my husband wanted him gone that day but I knew nobody would take a giant aggressive dog.)  He responds to treats instantly - just not without the treat in my hand."
preppers,37e787,PepperPreps,2,Mon Jun 1 16:35:32 2015 UTC,"I was able to access that photo now. That is a Mastiff. Generally, they aren't aggressive unless someone is threatening his people. Of course, the breeding is also a variable.  If you want to break a dog from being food aggressive (which includes treats and milk bones), you'll need to start free feeding the dog. When you put the dog in his dish, do so on the counter. You'll need to run your hands through the food to put your scent on it. This way he will understand that all food comes from you. The free feeding method, which equates to leaving food available at all times  will decrease his stress regarding where and when his next meal or treat is coming from. This is a very useful way of breaking food aggression.   It's best to train the dog the ""release"" command. This means that he drops whatever food he has, backs up and sits. This is especially important in the event he gets into some kind of poison. It takes time but it works.   Working with the dog on obedience training can make the world of difference. It allows you to spend time with him, which is what he actually craves anyway. There are cheap classes at a host of pet department stores and even the local community centers. Try it. Believe me; you won't be sorry."
preppers,37e787,rolahey,12,Tue Jun 2 02:07:48 2015 UTC,I think that a fair number of Europeans have an image of what it is like in the United States that just doesn't exist. You see the worst on the news and then extrapolate from there. The number of preppers here is most likely still under 1 percent of the population. Our media however chooses to exploit any interesting demographic that they can and preppers have been 'it' for a while now.  It's remarkable how smug Europeans can be given your continents' history. It seems that most modern Europeans seem to have this feeling that their violent history has ended and everything will be sunshine and rainbows forevermore. The history of humanity as a whole suggests that attitude is naive in the extreme. Feel free to keep taking selfies with the bear next door. Keep us informed about how that works out for you.  It seems to be that you think we prepare because we fear the future. I prepare so that I don't have to worry. It's very liberating knowing that regardless of what the world might throw your way that you can handle most of it. Your discomfort at us American preppers only makes me believe that you're projecting your insecurities elsewhere instead of dealing with them.
preppers,37e787,edheler,1 point,Wed May 27 01:08:19 2015 UTC,"Ya' know what, Ed? I'm with you. None of us knows what the future holds. I do know that each and every one of us wants to ensure that our families are safe.   Being prepared isn't about EMPs, civil unrest, economic collapse or other manmade or natural disasters. Being prepared is about ensuring that your family will survive anything that life throws at you.   There are no guidelines, rules or anything like that. It's all about the primal need to protect and take care if the people that you love, and the continued existence of your legacy. It's that simple.   The way I look at it is that I AM an American. I fear nothing. I will gladly give up my life for my country and countrymen. This is how I was raised. My Dad was Missing and Presumed Dead in Viet Nam. Turned out he was inside of a Tiger Cage for 7 years before our government found him and brought him home. Kind of a difficult thing for a 9 year old kid to understand.... Daddy coming back from the dead.   He never spoke of what went on however; we were only allowed to knock on the bedroom door and run down the hallway to wake him up. He wore T shirts in the pool to hide his scars. That being said, he still adored his country and said he would do it all again to protect us. Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to win but that's another issue.   Point I am going for is that I will die for my country, need be. Attack me on my soil, there shouldn't be any rules with apprehension and dispensing of the body. Just my opinion as an American Patriot."
preppers,37e787,rolahey,1 point,Sat May 30 03:12:13 2015 UTC,"I think that a fair number of Europeans have an image of what it is like in the United States that just doesn't exist. You see the worst on the news and then extrapolate from there.    I agree thats precisely why I'm asking, the thing is it would seem to me most people are also preparing for a collapse in society whereas I'm kinda saying in a collapse of european society case I've thought about it and I think I already am pretty prepared.   Now that I got a few answers I can only compare our state and people to kinda like the Mormons of europe, we really are tight people so I don't see crime and all that taking over and sure you have areas and sates like that too.    It's remarkable how smug Europeans can be given your continents' history   Thats what I was hoping to avoid and I hope I don't give you that impression, I'm trying to compare and see what is different, why you do this differently and so on, One of the things I pointed out that means I'm not that fearful of societal collapse is that the welfare state we live in means everyone has got an equal chance in life, free school, health and so on and it really does mean there is less crime and depravity as a result but higher taxes as well. it's all give and take BUT should things collapse is it pretty likely there will be less career criminals looking for easy pickings,   Can you see how I'm trying to investigate the differences and see how that changes our attitudes toward what preparedness means and what what we should be prepared for, it has nothing to do with smugness or otherwise, just attitudes and reality's on the ground as we percieve them and so far I've only really got defensive answers with little insight which I must say is a bit disappointing and not my aim or hopes. :/   It seems that most modern Europeans seem to have this feeling that their violent history has ended and everything will be sunshine and rainbows forevermore.   Oh no, southern europe is fast turning into a shithole, Russia is a paradise of stability compared to the social problems you see there and in my opinion a breakdown of greater society is much more likely than a war with a neighbour and should it come to that as I told in my post I have a second place in Ireland to take refuge   It seems to be that you think we prepare because we fear the future. I prepare so that I don't have to worry. It's very liberating knowing that regardless of what the world might throw your way that you can handle most of it. Your discomfort at us American preppers only makes me believe that you're projecting your insecurities elsewhere instead of dealing with them.   I seem to be detecting a bit of hostility in may replies so I hope its not my english and sort of frank way of putting things. You see you are kinda missing my question though, I get that you prepare so you don't have to worry but what sort of form does that take?    Your discomfort at us American preppers only makes me believe that you're projecting your insecurities elsewhere instead of dealing with them.   There is something buggng me but it's not that, I am very fearful for collapse in say the monetary system and while it will affect my quality of lifestyle in many ways and we may not be importing stuff I don't fear I need to run to the hills should it happen. I genuinely wonder why (or is) that more common in the states?"

Americans who pay attention are told regularly how awesome it is over there, with your healthcare and free school and whatnot. There's a long and bloody history behind a bunch of small (to us) countries. It's very easy for you to come off as smug. Have you heard reddit talk about how Bernie Sanders Is Awesome, but Wont Win because Vermont is SMALL AND WHITE? Same applies. We have a huge, diverse population with wildly varying cultural beliefs. It's proving hard to make everyone happy. Shit, 150 years ago we were at war about owning other people as property. The country was almost divided. We are large, young, and figuring shit out. We just want to run for the hills because nobody is there yet."

I might thereby be happy, especially if she could be Swedish,  but there are a lot of ifs between here or there that are bigger than the ifs of staying put  Same applies to most any other country that is not your own in my opinion"

It seems i might have strook a bad chord with some people here but I've just never been able to shake this feeling, if I truly was afraid of society collapsing around me and a bit of a max max world emerging I'd probably try and move my life as far north and as remote as possible and integrate in like you say. I'm 29 and well since 2008 happened it's been pretty easy to model my life into a preparedness mode I'm happy with.   I married a woman from Ireland whose family happened to have a farm, own water, good community and so on and so I would be lying if I didn't say I factored that in to some extent too."

You will get a more realistic look at what at what is a more of the American outlook. I live in a place that gets an average of 9 inches (22.8Cm) of rain so water is a problem for me. To me a financial collapse would not change my life that much, we have a community that could keep outsiders out and food would not be a problem.   We have been the worlds police for since WW2 and now that er are leaving that to Russia/China we are no longer the big kid on the block so invasion, oil embargo, large terrorist attacks (chemical, biological and nuclear dirty bombs) and we have the 3rd world brining things that this country has not had to deal with for over 60 years like polio and so many other thing that we thought were eradicated.   I am old ad established but if I were younger I would be looking at other places like the Philippines, Bolivia, Uruguay, Chile, Argentina and Falkland Islands. We do have other problems that you have but all the same dealing with now power or scarce food no mater where you are but our mega cities care in trouble if these bad things happen. We in most big cities only have about 3 days of food. So if some of the bad things happen we would have a refugee problem that would nerve been seen in the past. These are a few of the things that we have to deal with. When we have cities that have almost the population of your country the power goes out it would be nothing but a mass death zones."

Yea you see that's the thing I was thinking about, mass death zones or mass refuge exodus zones. I guess I've always factored in this idea that in the states (which is a huge place) you have lots of countrywise people who can look after themselves just fine and are equally if not more capable than we are but their lives are only made more difficult by the huge amount of supercity folk who would be left with no option but to fight for survival and that tends to make everything very difficult very fast.  if it wasn't for the fact everyone here owns a summer cabin in the woods somewhere I would be very fearful for what city people might have to do to each other but becasue there is that pressure valve so to speak it really does calm me into thinking nobody has any true reason to panic and maybe things wouldn't even break down as bad as they would otherwise.  of course in a total collapse situation our position on the border with Russia is an obvious threat but total collapse for us means the same for them too and in reality they are underpopulated as it is. to me personally it's a played up threat. society here is very close knit so if there is one thing that would keep it together it would be some sort of eastern invasion.  thanks for your input"

Not that the ""I'm calling you out!"" attitude is helping either.   Have you asked yourself why 72 hours? Seems kind of arbitrary if you ask me, why not 48 or 96?   But then...   72 hours is the national average it takes to restore utilities from the onset of an emergency   Oh, so you knew the whole time.    Preppers should start thinking about the mission goal and not the mission gear.   It's hilarious this guy thinks he's the only and first prepper(or person) to adopt this mindset.   Consider small children have been lost in the woods without any supplies, during the cold and have survived.    Oh yes, because they lived through shear luck, we should prepare to bug out with inadequate supplies? What's the ratio of children who lived to those who died? How about those who survived with no medical or psychological issues at all? Especially when you could be moving into a long term event, you really want to handicap yourself out of the gate?   Fact is there’s no “list”    ...Proceeds to make a list...   My experience has taught me that once you go over 24 hrs, you’re cutting into your speed and mobility. Again, if the goal is to get home…. then uh….   Then uh... if I'm more than 24hrs from home, I'll need the bag to support me for longer than 24hrs, no matter if it slows me down.   Why do you feel like brushing your teeth is a priority during a time like this?   Because gumming food sucks, just ask an old person.   Break contact and go home…   What happens if you need to fight into home?   If you feel like you need to have supplies on hand in the event of an emergency, consider building caches.   No guarantee of them being there(animals, construction, etc.) or that I will be able to take the route to them rather than being forced around them.  Now, there are good points.

But it's not a guarantee.   Redundancy is implied    Actually the article plainly says;   If you feel like you need to have supplies on hand in the event of an emergency, consider building caches. This will lighten your carried load, and if you were separated from your BoB you will still have some food and water for the trip.   So it's replacing items from your BOB to save weight, not making a redundancy.    Your feedback is appreciated, thank you.   No problem, and I hope I'm not being too hostile.

This way, if you can't carry a pack or you need to bolt, you can still carry all the important gear without being weighed down. You can even fit lightweight waterproof gear / hat gloves in there.

But the timeline for getting someone to a doctor, even today, can be days or weeks even. I've lived in places where this was the case. A week of tourniquet is going to lead to gangrene. I just thought it might be worth reminding those considering getting a tourniquet that you might be better off using a different method for stopping the bleeding or letting it bleed out a bit more in the short term, to avoid having to deal with gangrene in the long-term or that you will need to prepare the knowledge to do a field amputation.  As to doctors dissappearing,  that might be exactly what happens. Doctors are valuable and they'll be the first moved to secure areas, government facilities and the like. Your group's injuries might not be a high priority to these people, and they'll quite happily let you die if it means maintaining operational security. This happens in warzones today."

This way, we always have some food on hand when we grab the bag. There is also a battery operated blinker for his collar, and a flashlight for walks. Even though we have other flashlights, I like to have everything I need for the dog in one bag, even if there is some redundancy.   Don't forget to include your pet when calculating your water needs.

preppers,377pro,awyeah2,1 point,Mon May 25 16:09:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry this is long, but this needs to be clarified.   Although there is consistency in the messages and the voices used, Weather Radio is just one transmission method to the public on the EAS system. All of the messages are exactly the same because they use the same text generated by NWS so that the weather warning is a consistent message across all channels.   There is actually a highly secure process and digital equipment used to authenticate, receive and re-transmit an EAS message. EAS can't be triggered off of weather radio, however weather radio may be re-transmitted by a local station during weather events.   One leg of the EAS system being down shouldn't impact any other part of the system. Even if a broadcaster is also impacted by the cable cut, they normally have a secondary method of receiving the EAS message. They would only be impacted if the cable cut has taken them off the air also. Then, they have bigger problems to deal with than EAS.   If the local weather service office is unable to perform their duties due to the cable cut, another office in the region has full backup capabilities for that office and takes over their duties. That backup office will also be able to activate the local EAS system.   I've been dealing with these systems for many years, and I just way over-simplified it. Things like this are what keep me up at night - the backup to the backup to the backup.....  Also, if you are hearing a weather radio feed on a local broadcast or cable feed, that broadcaster is usually providing the feed outside of the EAS system as a public service.   Just figured this should be clarified so no one thinks that all warning methods would be down since there is a storm system making it's way across the south."

I think you have all good points I just don't like to limit the framework of the discussion. I do think you are underestimating the value of 22lr though. I can carry 500 rounds to the ARs 120. People underestimate what it takes to demotivated a human. People don't like being shot with hot pieces of lead period. It hurts and very few have the intestinal fortitude to do anything but crumple into a pile of quivering flesh after being shot. That being said. I carry an AR and realize it's value over other platforms but I wouldn't hesitate to throw a 25rd mag in my 10/22 and do very accurate and devastating work if necessary.
preppers,374mwu,RebelRatel,3,Mon May 25 15:57:34 2015 UTC,"I do think you are underestimating the value of 22lr though.   I'm not. .22LR completely fails to stop people 2X more than a .380 ACP handgun, and 3.4X more than centerfire rifles. Likely due to the fact that even out of a rifle, many .22 rounds(PDF warning) don't penetrate the required minimum 12"" of 10% ballistics gel meaning it`s less likely to reach vital organs, .22LR has very little kinetic energy, and it's a small round. Other rounds like .223 have more weight, tumbling or expansion, penetration, and way more energy going for them.   I can carry 500 rounds to the ARs 120.   Not much of an advantage if you have to shoot 500 rounds to do 120 rounds of work. Also consider that .223 will do things like defeat cover and body armour much better than .22LR, and reach much further.   It hurts and very few have the intestinal fortitude to do anything but crumple into a pile of quivering flesh after being shot.   Except we see time and again that isn't true for everyone (Note this was with no drugs in his system), and we can't pretend the person you meet will be that one who quivers. No military or police force uses .22LR as standard issue, and there is a hugely good reason for that."
preppers,374mwu,edheler,1 point,Mon May 25 17:37:00 2015 UTC,"a .22, unless shot placement is PERFECT, is little more than a nuisance. A .22 does not create wound channels that are considered lethal. So unless you hit the heart, brain or spinal cord, then you are not going to score a lethal hit. That means that your attacker can continue shooting.   To expand, there are instances of subjects taking MULTIPLE 9mm hollowpoint rounds before going down. A .22 is NOT going reliably stop an attacker."

preppers,374mwu,RiverRunnerVDB,4,Mon May 25 21:35:43 2015 UTC,You raise some good points but I think that most us realize that not only do we have to have slings but also that magazines are an expendable resource. It's even a fairly common discussion to talk about having spare parts for our firearms as well. My goal is to have at least 20 magazines per rifle and at least 10 per handgun.  There are still too many people who only have the standard strap that was sold with their AR-15 as a sling. More than a few haven't used their firearm enough to determine if it fits them properly. If you aren't an instructor today should you be planning on training anyone later? How many people have received firearms instruction of any kind?  No one should be considering repelling a sustained attack. If you really face something like that you're much better off retreating and attacking at a time of your choosing. Gaining the initiative is likely to be much more effective than nearly any other strategy against an untrained opponent. If you're untrained you're going to lose if your opponent is trained.  If you're not an expert shot then the best instruction you can get is Appleseed. If you're already an expert shot then you should become an instructor because after the SHTF you're going to have lots of people who will need training. Once you have done all of that then you should get off of the couch and go to lots of firearms training classes. By that point you should probably go pick up some martial arts training. If you have done all of this you should be congratulated but you would also realize that you have only just scratched the surface of what you need to know.

preppers,374mwu,Darth_Cosmonaut_1917,2,Mon May 25 02:03:31 2015 UTC,At Appleseed we call it instruction and you should take the whole family if your kids are old enough. :) I have been at events with kids in the 6-7 age range. It's easy enough to keep them safe by strapping a rifle down with bungie cords and having them be the designated sniper. If the only thing stopping you is that you don't have enough rifles post on the Appleseed forums in the section for the state where you would be attending an event. Instructors typically have rifles available to loan out.  Make sure you figure out how to attach a USGI web sling to your takedown rifle. You will learn a lot more if you have one. If you're not using an optic I would highly recommend replacing Ruger's stock sights with tech-sights as well.
preppers,374mwu,SomeTechDude,2,Mon May 25 12:25:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!   My oldest is a really big 3, but still 3, so I may have to wait a few years for him.  I am,  in part,  learning these skills so I can support my children's learning when it is time.   I will look into the strap and sights, I appreciate the suggestion, I currently don't have any strap but do have a little red dot on it.   Do you think the training on the .22 LR will transfer over to my AR, or would you suggest going again with my other rifle?"
preppers,374mwu,Darth_Cosmonaut_1917,2,Mon May 25 12:57:01 2015 UTC,You're going to need a sling. It's a critical marksmanship aide. The problem is that attaching it properly to a base Ruger 10/22 takedown model is difficult. If you have a gunsmith that you trust you might want to ask for their help since you have to drill and attach a rear sling mount in the stocks plastic.  Practically everything that you learn on a .22LR will transfer to a centerfire rifle. Once you can shoot rifleman at an Appleseed you might want to start working on achieving the same result with a centerfire rifle. There isn't a lot of recoil with 5.56 but people do develop flinches from the louder bang.
preppers,374mwu,Ago_Solvo,2,Mon May 25 21:11:40 2015 UTC,"If I am not bothered by the louder bang, would you suggest just going through appleseed with my AR then? I already have the right sights, the sling, and will be using as my main when I get trained up."
preppers,374mwu,PabstyLoudmouth,2,Mon May 25 23:59:11 2015 UTC,"It mostly comes down to what you can afford. If you're already good on all of the basics then perhaps going with the AR might be a good idea but if you have any doubts I would take a .22LR. It's very rare for a student to score Rifleman (210 out of 250 on our AQT target) at their first Appleseed. I believe I have only witnessed one person achieve the feat with a centerfire rifle. Even experienced CMP and NRA High Power competitors have trouble with our target and rules.  It's also worth having good sights and a sling on a .22LR regardless. I have three Ruger 10/22's myself all setup to be used for Appleseed. In fact, every rifle I own is setup with a sling that can be used in a way to assist with marksmanship and has either good iron sights or a scope with good backup iron sights. It was a real challenge to get decent iron sights on a modern bolt action rifle."

Old timers would say it would run for a full day on a soda bottle of fuel - I want to find out myself.  The treadmill motor is large. It is a 15 amp motor and if turned at full speed would produce 90VDC. A larger pulley on the flywheel would allow me slow the engine down (preserving fuel) while still keeping the RPM's up on the dc motor. Today was a very unpolished experiment. I also tested a high output car alternator but I realized I'd have to spin that at about 1,000 RPM just to get a few amps out of it....so that guy is out."

My main issue with Steripen though is that it won't hit water droplets at the rim of your vessel, which means you have to clean it off very carefully to avoid that tiny droplet that could have the one bacteria in it to make you ill. I told them that since they're staying in a good hotel, they should just stick to their bottled water and use it to treat water for brushing their teeth and whatnot while they're in their hotel room.  I generally suggest people to flush them out after each trip they do (or more often if they don't only do day trips like myself). Regular maintenance is key, as well as letting the filter properly drain out and dry, etc. I know I won't be using the filter as often as people in Honduras (probably no more than 100 gallons a year of filtering) so the filter shouldn't deteriorate enough to make it an issue for me.

Blanching is when you boil the leaves then put them in cold water to stop them from cooking further.  the roots can be cleaned and boiled to make a decoction a healthy tea. add honey. The roots can be roasted like coffee beans and you can make Dandelion root coffee (coffee substitute of sorts). I haven't tried this but I plan on trying it out.

If so, then buy the equivalent, and you are good to go."
preppers,36l2fd,IamNabil,4,Wed May 20 13:00:24 2015 UTC,"The entire BCG isn't typically expendable, but the bolt alone is. Most people carry an extra bolt. It usually cracks at the cam pin hole. Your replacement bolt will fit in your old, still good carrier."

An AK will go bang every time you pull the trigger with no cleaning, packed with dirt, weeks after a fancy-pants Tavor or AR-15 already jammed.  Imagine running through the woods with 3 armed men after you. They want your food. You trip and go face-down in the mud. Instinctively, you put your hands out in front of you as you fall. However both of your hands are clutching your rifle, and it gets caked with mud. You quickly roll over on your back to see the bandits running towards you, is your mud-caked rifle going to jam after 3 shots? Of course not, it's a fucking AK."

Of course not, it's a fucking AK.   No, what it will do, even as an AK, is blow up in your face because of the barrel obstruction.  It is not significantly more reliable than the AR, and certainly not more reliable than the Tavor.  Also, not all AK's have a bigger bullet."

Also, all three rifles, with their bolt forward, are reasonably sealed against mud, and all three have been sucessfully used in harsh conditions without major issues.   I can buy 3 WASR-10s for the price of one overpriced Israeli space-gun.   So what? Price has nothing to do with your cry of reliability. You also have a longer gun for the same barrel length, worse balance, worse ergonomics, heavier magazines, less mounting options for optics and other things(not that you should overload your rifle with crap)...  Both are good designs. Both have strengths and weaknesses. Both would serve pretty much equally well given equal training."

That means you can't carry very many of them.  What can you hunt with an AK?  ... Exactly.  If you are running from 3 armed men, you are already dead.  If you think that a 360 noscope headshot is going to save you, then you do not understand the situation you are describing.  I avidly recommend the AR over the AK (at least in America), and I heavily advise the 12-ga over the .223 option.  But that's just me.  I prefer the versatility of a shotgun, and it's ability to feed and protect me."
preppers,36l2fd,blue_27,0,Wed May 20 15:11:52 2015 UTC,".223 is considered too small to humanely put down a deer in one hit. Shotguns are great but they don't hold enough rounds for defense. No one said anything about 360 noscope headshots. 3 armed men probably would kill any one of us no matter what gun we were holding. Yeah, I don't fully understand the situation, and I hope I never have to. I'm just saying reliability is the most important thing to me in choosing a SHTF rifle. ARs are more reliable than most AK guys would like to admit. AKs are more accurate than most AR guys would like to admit."

I won't be taking anything larger than wabbits, and I will be primarily focusing on fish in this region.  I think that 9 slugs are plenty for defense, and I can interchange with buckshot.  I know that rubber pellet rounds exist, but I have zero use for them.   ARs are more reliable than most AK guys would like to admit. AKs are more accurate than most AR guys would like to admit.   I wholeheartedly agree with you here.  I see way too much head-in-sand on both sides of the ball.  I'm a diehard Mossberg guy, so you're both wrong.  :)  Or right.  Cup half full/empty.

preppers,36l2fd,edheler,0,Wed May 20 14:18:18 2015 UTC,"You can.  The AK design is a solid platform.  The new Century RAS 47 shoots a 1 inch moa at 300 yards. Many older ""crummy"" AKs are considered inaccurate because the manufacture created canted sights etc, and the owner never had it fixed.  The point im making is that most guns are reliable and accurate,  provided you know them, their mechanisms, how to maintain them, and you practice with them. The best gun in the world is uselss if you dont know how to run it."
preppers,36l2fd,IamNabil,2,Wed May 20 14:49:23 2015 UTC,"shoots a 1 inch moa at 300 yards   1 MOA at 300 yards is approximately 3 inches. A better approximation would be 3.142 inches if you want a four significant digits of precision.  As for the subject that you were discussing, the average AK-47 with average 7.62x39 ammunition as a platform is typically good out to about 300 yards/meters. One of the major reasons that AK-47's are reliable is because of their sloppy tolerances. The tolerances can be tightened but then reliability problems usually increase. Combine that with less than optimal ballistics and a small powder charge in the round leave the AK-47 with a limited role. I wouldn't let it discourage someone if it was the best battle rifle that you could afford though. There are also plenty of situations where 300 yards/meters is more than enough.  It is unfortunate that so many people feel so religious about particular firearm platforms. It's great to have the luxury of being able to choose the best tool for the job. Too much time and effort is spent trying to find the perfect firearm to cover all contingencies. Such a beast just doesn't exist. In a serious WROL situation most of the time I would choose my LaRue AR-10 variant but I can think of good reasons to choose other firearms from my safe instead."
preppers,36l2fd,loserlaser,1 point,Fri May 22 03:29:52 2015 UTC,What does the RAS 47 shoot? The 7.62x39 itself isn't ballistically stable out that far.
preppers,36l2fd,IamNabil,1 point,Wed May 20 14:53:17 2015 UTC,Yes it is. And the RAS shoots the standard 7.62x39. In the right hand and with decent ammo an ak is as accurate as you would need.  Because if you're bugging out and sniping people... something else is going on.

I would take a full auto M16 over a full auto Ak any day, as the m16 is indeed a far more accurate rifle.  And I wouldnt hunt game with an AK anyway...but if I had to choose, itd be an AR for hunting over an ak. In the line of self defense SHTF end of the world scenario I would take my AK and my glocks over any guns. They just work, you know? They arent finicky or complicated, they chew threw any ammo you can find and require little to no attention or maintenance.

Sure bud, you keep repeating what the Internet told you without proof.   http://www.defensereview.com/the-big-m4-myth-fouling-caused-by-the-direct-impingement-gas-system-makes-the-m4-unreliable/   I fired 2400 rounds of M193 through a 14.5” M4-type upper receiver from Bravo Company Manufacturing (BCM) with no lubrication, and without any rifle-caused malfunctions.  I have shot over 2500 rounds with the FailZero kit with EXO Technology coating on four separate occasions with no lubricant, as well as a ceramic coated rifle (to include bolt and bolt carrier group) from Next Generation Arms that currently has 4000 rounds on it without cleaning or lubricant, and also no malfunctions. I have also routinely shot a Noveske N4 14.5”-barreled rifle over 2500 rds with only 6-8 drops of oil every 500-700rds fired without any issues.  Prior to the test I did the following:  1. Remove all visible oil and lubricant from the inside of the upper receiver.  2. Disassemble the bolt carrier group (BCG) and remove all lubricant inside and out  3. Put a Crane O-ring on the existing extractor spring  4. Use a lower receiver with a Sprinco standard Blue spring and an H-3 buffer (I used an H3 because it was close to the DPMS Extra-heavy buffer I use in most of my rifles.  (*Writers note: A standard rifle buffer is 5.2oz. For a Carbine receiver extension a standard H buffer is 3.8oz, H2 is 4.7oz and H3 is 5.6oz.)  After I had done that, I fired 2400 rounds of M193 through it in six sessions, often shooting it so hot that I could not hold the forend without gloves.   The rifle had no issues other than some test magazines that did not feed the last round properly. Once those test magazines were removed, the rifle always locked to the rear on the last round fired and did not feel sluggish.   Don't get me wrong, I agree with what you say about the Tavor. It is more reliable. But the world's second most used assault rifle isn't that popular because it doesn't work in harsh conditions...  And there is a point to what they are saying; as any rifle can and will break in harsh conditions. And when it does, having one that is very common means you are more likely to be able to repair it at all. Important if considering a long term solution."

The surprise, stabbing pain, and a second of blindness can make the difference between having to shoot someone (loud, uses at least one potentially irreplaceable round but more realistically three to five) and being able to overpower them quietly and non-lethally.  I've had really fantastic luck with Surefire lights, but I don't know if they make anything that mounts to a rifle.  They also take special batteries, which could be an issue.

I got into shooting some skeet with the longer barrel and it's fun way to get good with the gun.  Then strap on the short barrel and tear up some targets for the hell of it, feels straight out of the wild west.  I know I paid less than 300 for mine, but that was years ago.  Seems like it's still along that price point.  May be in the higher range of what you're looking to pay, but you're getting a much more versital gun with the two barrels and different chokes.  Plus the pistol grip if you're so inclined (I personally didn't care for it, but I suppose it could be okay for tight corners)."
preppers,36loqr,AstorReinhardt,10,Wed May 20 08:42:39 2015 UTC,"I think, given your circumstances, learning to cook from basic ingredients (rice, beans, flour, etc) could help on several fronts.   It's a good skill to have if SHTF. It's a good way to save money and get the most mileage out of your food stamps. Once you're cooking regularly, then buying a 25 or 50lb bag of rice is no longer a ""doomsday prepper thing"" but simply being frugal. Cooking is something nice you can do for your parents.

Some foods that I always have stocked: quinoa, lentils, dry beans, rice, cornmeal, canned foods (soup, beans, tomato paste). In an emergency, these would keep me and my husband going for many months, supplemented by fresh produce and herbs from the garden.   I would suggest starting a small garden. It's an invaluable skill that feeds you and your loved ones. Seeds and plants can also be purchased with food stamps if you don't have the cash.

preppers,36kbs0,thecurbstomper,0,Sat May 23 18:53:48 2015 UTC,"The standard is ""don't fucking hurt anyone"". It's covered under the concept of liability.

The courts do, under rules written by the legislature. All the DMV really does is collect money and waste people's time."

We she went in for her driving test, I figured it would just be a practice run since she was not good enough to be licensed, but she passed.

This is indeed a better alternative to original packaging. However, ""air tight"" is very different form ""oxygen proof"". There's only one type of specialty plastic that is oxygen proof and you have to buy it online. Oxygen is what degrades some of your vitamins and minerals. What's the point of storing food if oxygen got in and removed most of the nutrition?    You can make a super simple, super effective improvised arrow or spear head from an old circuit board.    Completely ineffective. Circuit boards are too brittle to stand up to constant wear and tear.    Eyeglasses are essentially a pair of magnifying lenses.    Me and my friends did tests on this. Not all eyeglass lenses will work as a magnifying lens. Test before relying on this. This method also highly depends on how much sunlight is reaching you. Michigan winters are mostly overcast so this is useless for me in the winter."

In all seriousness, it is still a thousand times better to make your own, and get one of those pouches that are already designed to attach to your alice rig (ie. from 5.11 or maxpedition, etc).

preppers,36enl9,jacksheerin,2,Tue May 19 15:05:32 2015 UTC,How often do you need to shear(?) them?   They get sheared once a year.  Ours were done a few weeks ago.  Typically you want to do it at the beginning of the warmer months so they don't have heat problems in the summer.  They go from this  to this.   And how much fiber does an average adult produce?   An average of 4.5 pounds but it varies widely.   My wife tells me 4.5 is the average but a given animal could be anywhere from 2.5 to 10 lbs.

Most preppers I've come into contact with are men, and they are much more likely to focus on the munitions side of it. Some get into medical care, but most do not.  I think, ultimately, it comes down to the approach. What kind of prepper are they? Do they think they can just steal or otherwise 'procure' what they need or are they the type who are more interested in preparing the long haul. Are they buying bullets or learning how to make their own? Are they stocking up on freeze dried and dehydrated food or do they garden and can? These aren't exclusive, of course, but they are pretty good indicators of their style. Personally, I value people who learn skills and seek to be more subsistent over those that buy a bunch and stock up on purchased items only."

preppers,36enl9,vuhleeitee,2,Tue May 19 23:02:44 2015 UTC,"I am good at these things. I do some historic (Viking era) reenactment and so that led to an interest in these things. Many many preppers don't consider such things. A lot of the community is just all about the guns and hoarding. When really if anybody wishes to survive for any extended length of time self sustainability will be the key thing. And that includes such nearly lost arts as you have mentioned. Admitedly that's a LONG term prep though. You don't need these things to survive for a day or even a year or possibly two. But if you're planning on having to survive for 10's or years...yeah....  And there is a large portion of the community that scoffs at the idea that anything other than their super modern way could possibly be best. Yes, that lighter and matches is easier, but if you don't know how to start a fire without such tools and there comes a time when those tools run out or aren't available you're in trouble. Meanwhile I'll sit over here being able to draw on my ancient techniques and survive. Even if I don't prep around them, I still know them. My bug out bag isn't filled with my Viking kit. BUT it COULD be. Because I have the knowledge set to work with it. And I'd survive with it. In some ways my Viking era garments would even do me better than my modern gear. Just an observation.   I take comfort knowing that I'll be able to spin and weave and knit, etc. as well as sew and mend and the list goes on and on. Not only are they rewarding hobbies they are so useful. In some cases knowledge that is being lost. The amount of men and women I know who simply can't even sew on a button with any amount of confidence or skill (so it works and doesn't just fall off) is astounding. Not to even mention the amount of people who can sew a little but in no way could construct clothing or anything else. An immediate need? Likely not. But a worthwile and long term one? Hell yes!"
preppers,36enl9,aboba_,1 point,Tue May 19 05:54:12 2015 UTC,"Knots are also very important.  How to fasten things with rope and with wire.  Braiding is a very basic way to improve low strength cordage.  I do think there will be malls, fabric stores and the fiber items in everybody's homes after TEOTWAWKI.  They may be risky to access and the useful stuff may not last long.  I guess it depends whether you believe SHTF will necessarily include a large population reduction (whether by migration, people shooting each other or other violence, lack of heat, pandemic, lack of food, lack of power/ food safety/ sanitation, ...)"

There are already enough existing durable containers available for the next 50 years. How many households don't have at least a few rubbermaid tubs?   The same really holds true for fabrics, sewing and alteration would be helpful just for repurposing."
preppers,36enl9,aboba_,3,Mon May 18 21:45:33 2015 UTC,Weaving traps come to mind. Do you seriously intend to just carry around a plastic tub if/when SHTF?  Native and Indigenous people have been sewing shelters for a rather long time. Sewing knowledge is also important in first aid.  Not knowing how to repair your clothes and other shelter from the elements is a pretty sure fire way of putting yourself at risk for all sorts of health problems.

preppers,36do0b,fruedain,5,Mon May 18 15:45:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't let One Second After worry you too much. It's great that it got you thinking about preparedness but you can't go from zero to being ready for a nuclear induced high-altitude EMP. You just have too much to get and learn if your goal is to survive that sort of disaster.  Take a few deep breaths, read our welcome sticky and then start to work on the basics. Don't overwhelm yourself with trying to do too much too quickly.  Given what you wrote I can't emphasize this enough: go to an Appleseed and learn how to shoot. Everything that you would learn in the program transfers to other types of firearms. It is also very inexpensive that even a broke college student should be able to afford. You might even have local instructors who would loan you a .22 for the weekend so you wouldn't have to buy one immediately. There are events all over the country nearly year round. I wouldn't buy a handgun until later — it was my first reaction to wanting to become prepared as well but it wasn't the best decision because I just didn't know enough."
preppers,36do0b,edheler,1 point,Mon May 18 16:40:23 2015 UTC,"I know I have a lot to learn. I am taking a class this summer for first aid. Appleseed looks really good. And there's one I can register for in my home town!! Going to register for that. Thank you. I'm going to take your advise and not do too much too quickly. I want focus this summer on learning first aid, getting a Bug out Bag, and canning. For me until I get out of school, I'm going to be doing most of my prepping during the summer as I don't have time during school."
preppers,36do0b,DocTorrFabulous,3,Mon May 18 17:17:05 2015 UTC,"I'll dissent. Don't go to appleseed to learn how to shoot. Take an NRA-certified basic course or find a local instructor. You'll save a lot of time and won't have to listen to a bunch of old guys complain about kids today and politics and a very revised version of history. The autoplay propaganda video on their webpage should be a dead give-away. If the latter is what you want, more power to you, but a CMP or NRA certified coach will be a better use of your time from a skills perspective. They are also less likely to complain if you show up with a borrowed rifle that has -GASP- a scope or red dot on it. You also mentioned shotguns and handguns, neither of which will be covered at Appleseed, but many ranges will have either house or locally-vetted instructors who could do a basics class with pistols, rifles, and shotguns and basic safety and marksmanship in a couple hours, at which point you could spend the rest of the time an Appleseed course would have occupied reading a book about the revolutionary war, if you wanted.   Ed's right about OSA, it's mental masturbation for people of a particular political and/or religious mindset: 'The world is wrong and -when- the Big One happens we can rebuild society the way I want to."" It's fine if that's what you want, but as far as being well-written or an accurate take on the world, it falls flat. It's important to remember that you're going to have to start small and start with the most realistic.   OSA is great at instilling fear, but fear is the mind-killer. If you're going to start prepping, you must put fear aside. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. Look at what your most likely and most dangerous problems are first. House/apartment fires, physical fitness/health, emotional/mental fitness/health, and I'd say job loss but you're in school so making sure you can get a solid career is where you'll want to focus. Don't let yourself get sucked into the spiral of doom-n-gloom. The world's kept on spinning fro a few billion years, and it's going to keep spinning for a few billion more. Focus on getting your life in gear, accomplishing those goals. If you prefer the sustainable living/back to the land lifestyle, that's a good way to go, but I can't stress enough that it's a bad gamble to go into debt or pass on a really great career because it would make surviving a very low probability event harder.   I'll be accused of a bias to normality, but I will point out that we've gone a few thousand years without an overnight EOTWAWKI, whereas millions of people deal with job loss, home loss, and health problems every year.  Edit: Is aw your comment about ""affording a bike"" and your money saving mindset. Good on you, that's a really great way to think about money. Every financial guru I've listened to says ""pay [me] first"" meaning your consider money you're saving for retirement or emergency funds as ""spent"" out of your budget."
preppers,36do0b,edheler,2,Mon May 18 23:57:51 2015 UTC,"You'll save a lot of time and won't have to listen to a bunch of old guys complain about kids today and politics and a very revised version of history.   You have either never been to an Appleseed or had one run by instructors who were breaking all of the rules. We have a rule that we don't talk about politics more recent than the Revolutionary War. Some extend that to the timeframe of the ratification of the Constitution but never anything more recent than 1791. I have seen instructors removed from the program because they wouldn't follow that rule.  The story that Appleseed tells is about the events of April 19, 1775. There isn't any need or reason to revise history because the events of that day really are stranger than fiction. We tell the story at times when we take breaks from shooting. It really doesn't take over the day.   They are also less likely to complain if you show up with a borrowed rifle that has -GASP- a scope or red dot on it.   I often recommend to students that they get optics if it appears that their eyesight will hinder them making progress with iron sights. I don't know any instructors that care if you're using a borrowed rifle — in fact most of us will loan out rifles to students.  Why don't you tell us the event where all of these things happened. I have instructed at Appleseeds in 7 different States and I have never seen anything remotely like what you describe.   Take an NRA-certified basic course or find a local instructor.   The NRA basic courses really are worthless unless you're a complete novice. I say this as a certified NRA Instructor. The NRA does seem to be addressing this problem though but it will take a few years to see if the changes they are making now will really turn things around.  The basic problem with NRA and CMP instructors is that you pay a fee, take a class and so long as you pass a test, which no-one ever fails, you become an instructor. I am planning on getting my CMP instructor certification this year just for the heck of it. Appleseed has a very extensive training program for its instructors and I would hold us up against the instructors of any other program. Locally vetted instructors without even those basic credentials are usually worse — typically they really are the old-boy network that you were accusing Appleseed of being.  Of course there are exceptions but they are usually few and far between. For an adult at $60 a weekend I doubt anyone will find a more reasonable program than Appleseed where you get quality instruction. For the price there isn't a better national program in the US.  Yes, the OP will need to take other classes but learning the basics with a rifle will transfer well to pistols. It will also keep him from developing the typical bad habits associated with starting with a shotgun."
preppers,36do0b,DocTorrFabulous,1 point,Tue May 19 00:43:18 2015 UTC,"My experience with appleseed was that the instructors were okay, but there was a lot of time wasted talking instead of shooting. Some NRA/CMP instructors are subpar, some aren't. It's best to look around a local board and look for someone reputable, and you get to skip all the history lessons.   My first Appleseed was in FL and another in NC with a friend. If you want the entire cultural and historical to-do, okay, but from a prep standpoint you can trim the fat and just take a course from a certified instructor instead and get more hands-on time with a lot less scowling.   We have a rule that we don't talk about politics more recent than the Revolutionary War.   This was absolutely not followed at either event I attended."

preppers,36do0b,ruat_caelum,3,Tue May 19 17:04:20 2015 UTC,"Canning is a great skill to learn, and it is a cost-effective way to preserve the food that you've grown. There are some start up costs, such as a pressure canner or water bath canner (depends upon the food you are canning, and Ball jars. Do yourself a favor and don't buy the Walmart brand of jars. They rarely seal and are a waste of money. Only use recipes that are approved for canning or you can get very sick, or worse.  If the dog doesn't dig inside of planters, you could have a container garden. You don't even need to buy planters. Simply contact some of your local restaurants and ask them for empty food grade buckets. Most will gladly give them to you. You will need to drill holes in the bottom before putting the soil in, but free is the right price.  As for buying soil, it can be expensive however; you can ask Home Depot or other home improvement stores if you can sweep up and haul out any broken bags of soil. Generally, they let you get it free. You will need to bring your own bags.  Watch for BOGO (buy 1 get 1 free) sales at your local grocery stores. Most stores, like Publix will let you use 2 manufacturers coupons and 2 store coupons per deal. Oftentimes, this makes the canned or boxed foods free or almost free.  In my opinion, bug out bags are a very personal thing. We all have our own needs and requirements. Of course, there are things like matches, lighters, water filtration straws, lightweight but high calorie foods that we all need. Take the time to generate a list of items that you believe would be essential to surviving the trip home. Make another one of things that would be helpful. Ponder all of them and read reviews before making any purchases. The beer brewing thing is a good idea however; you would need access to the ingredients if you were to make it during SHTF times. I make Apple Jack all the time, and it's quite good in stressful situations such as after a hurricane.  Knowledge is power. Read up on as much as you can, and learn simple skills that would be helpful. Snaring a rabbit will help you eat and it costs nothing. Learning to tie knots can help you with creating a shelter in the woods, need be. The ability to start a fire in a variety of ways is important. The list could go on forever.  Just be smart about it.Start with trying to be ready for 3 days in the event a storm knocks out the power. Then, set a goal for 3 months, six months, etc. Don't overdo it. Rome wasn't built in a day."

What about a cash emergency fund for say roof damage or if your car throws a rod, or you slide on ice and run into the garage door.  Prepping is fine. A large pantry / growing food is good. Don't start by investing in a  bunker and a 10 kilowatt diesel generator.  What's more likely that you make it to retirement age and regret not having a retirement fund and are a burden on your children / or you need to live through an ariel nuclear EMP that somehow takes out the whole freaking country enough that FEMA and other aid agencies aren't able to support you.  Have enough food and water to do 72 hours, then bump that to 7 days. Beyond that balance your fear of X happening with the probably that it will.  Good finacial planning can help with either retirement or whatever, my suggestion is prepare for the everyday problems and the things that most americans have to deal with. Hows that health insurance you got? The number one reason for bankruptcy in america is medial debts.  You might get hit by a drunk driver or whatever, something not your fault and still have to use up all your savings taking care of medical stuff. so don't go too overboard on the end of the world scenarios until you've got plans in place for problems everyone will face at least once in their lives."

I have about 4 thousand in my savings for that reason and spending $200 of my own money for a Bug out-Bag and for canning supplies isn't going to be a problem at all. I have good health insurance. I am still on my parents health insurance and will be able to get off once I graduate college. I am going to college for Respiratory Therapy, and in my state has a very good job placement.

Prepping scared is almost as much of a bad idea as grocery shopping while you're hungry. You'll buy all the things, which may or may not be what you need, but in the end you're just getting gadgets.

And tripwires are a little limited, both in coverage, the fact it has to be manually reset after every use(enemy trips it, hides, waits to ambush you), and time it takes to set up and tear down.

preppers,366pu9,PabstyLoudmouth,9,Sat May 16 23:05:14 2015 UTC,"Another fit prepper here.  I have noticed this too, massively.  There are some ""big"" guys I have met in the preppersphere that are actually in pretty ok shape, despite being fat.  Most are not.   I did a few hiking camping trips with some folks, we called them ""Mock Bug outs"" even though I have like, 0 intention of running to the woods for 99.9999% of any conceivable disaster, I do like camping and bug out bags are fun.  It was a 18 mile hike over a 4 day weekend. There were 12 of us at the start.  Only 3 of us finished.  Its not a hard trail. Mostly pretty flat.  Some guys gave up before they had walked a mile. Partly because they had way the fuck to much stuff, but partly because they were in really bad shape.   The same guys who buy all this gear, buy all these guns, have these fantastic scenarios in their heads, but can't carry their kit a mile without giving up and throwing in the towel.  Its crazy."
preppers,366pu9,Zoe_the_biologist,2,Sun May 17 11:47:40 2015 UTC,"yep.  I used to train for ultra marathons, all trail running, and every ounce you carry adds up over that 20-30 mile run/hike.    You need to be prepared to train with what you will actually be doing in a real life scenario.    otherwise people will just fail, like you saw."
preppers,366pu9,Arowx,2,Sun May 17 13:31:22 2015 UTC,"Yep.  I don't understand buying thousands in gear, which represents many hours worth of time invested making money, but not investing a little bit in yourself at the gym, and eating just a bit less."
preppers,366pu9,44Dave,2,Sun May 17 14:21:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't see many situations where running is going to help you besides war, and even in war you only run a little bit at a time. I feel hiking is much better training than running and it saves on the knees. Training with tools is what separates us from Monkeys, so to scoff at gear like that is hilarious. Yes, it is a great idea to be in optimal shape but I feel if you can run a mile comfortably you are fine."
preppers,366pu9,edheler,1 point,Sun May 17 21:25:47 2015 UTC,"A mile is a very short distance to run. Being able to run for 5 or 6 minutes strait is not an achievement.   Walking long distances with all your gear on is much worse than running. Running has pretty much no disadvantages for most runners, though heavier people should walk until they get their diet right and loose weight.  There is nothing wrong with having gear, but having gear and not training (and training means more than punching paper at the range now and again or going car camping with your bug out bag) does not make you prepared. At all.  Saying you don't need to train physically to prep is dumb. And there are a lot of preppers who have a lot of stuff and are still not going to be close to prepared because they don't want to put the effort into their most basic and most important prep."

I agree with others that you would probably be better off with a blog but why don't you try building a following with self-posts first. That way when you launch your blog you would already have some people who would follow you. Everyone seems to get marketing backwards — build a following before you try to monetize it.

preppers,366pu9,Hecateus,6,Sat May 16 21:41:15 2015 UTC,I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on his preparations.

Even if I eat enough not to die, I don't want to start looking skeletal and keep myself at a 1200/day calorie intake just so I don't stand out too much."

But rememver fitness for preppers is different then body builders and until we see what he posts you don't know if he is right or not.   You cant be to skinny. But if you are to fat you are going to be just as fucked too. the trick is to already have your homestead of bugout location setup close to what it will be in SHTF and run it regularly. Then you will build the functional muscles for your survival.   But don't be so quick to judge on no information despite the use of language that can anger people.  Wait to see what he says.   edit: on mobile had to fix spacing
preppers,366pu9,broscientologist,1 point,Sat May 16 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"Right on, For a prepper/survivalist training plan, IDEALLY you want strength over size.    Packing on muscle creates a larger size to strength ratio which is actually detrimental, meaning you get bigger but your strength does not increase at the same rate.    This means you are bigger, require more energy (food)  and are now slower, since your mass has increased.    The type of training is focused on strength and neuromuscular training. (ie getting the most our of your existing muscle)"
preppers,366pu9,PabstyLoudmouth,8,Sat May 16 21:21:48 2015 UTC,"But in a SHTF scenario, fat people will drastically reduce weight as each day goes by.

I am not saying being slightly fat is a good game plan, but many of them will be just fine if SHTF."

If you were injured and had to be transported, your chances of being carried miles to safety is lower,  and if you have to join up with other groups, do you think other groups would want heavier (ie more food required) individuals.

preppers,366pu9,monet108,11,Sat May 16 21:31:29 2015 UTC,Most people (even thin ones) have an almost unlimited supply of energy via fat stores.   [CITATION NEEDED]
preppers,366pu9,Arowx,-1,Sat May 16 21:38:34 2015 UTC,"Taking me for example, I am pretty lean at about 10-12% body fat. 178 lbs, which means I have about 21 lbs of fat on my body.  at 3500 cals per lb of bodyweight you're looking at 74,760 cals in fat storage.  Thats about 37 days worth of 2000 calorie days.    For someone whos fatter, say at 16-18% Bodyfat, they are looking at 32 lbs, or 112,000 calories.    While that's not technically unlimited, its a lot."
preppers,366pu9,DocTorrFabulous,11,Sat May 16 22:07:29 2015 UTC,"Your math doesn't hold, because anything below a certain percentage of fat will impede your performance and degrade your health very quickly. The floor for vital fat is at least 5%, so that cuts your fat storage to about eleven pounds or a little over 38,000 calories. Your 2000 calorie day estimates are also ridiculous in the context of survival, as you're going to be moving around instead of sitting at a desk. For instance, when I was deployed and hiking around Afghanistan with a working load of about eighty pounds, I was eating about 3600 calories per day and still lost fat. A full day of walking on a flat, firm surface with no additional weight puts someone with your weight/height around 2000 calories of exertion in addition to your baseline calorie burning. Add in a ruck, a gun, and make the terrain something other than a ash track and your fat storage is depleted in under two weeks.   What you really want to look at is the differences in actual performance in the scenario required instead of punching numbers based on what you burn sitting at a desk all day. Two thousand is what I burn laying in bed."
preppers,366pu9,Arowx,3,Sat May 16 22:37:04 2015 UTC,I have to agree with this.
preppers,366pu9,DocTorrFabulous,-1,Sat May 16 23:13:56 2015 UTC,"MY math does hold actually, and you'd even have longer than the estimated time based on the fact that nothing happens in a vacuum. The body  doesn't just break down fat for energy when starvation occurs, muscle breakdown begins to occur as well, and your body begins using a combination of fat and protein for energey.    My original point is that fat storage is much much higher compared to glucose/glycogen storage.   Roughly 100k calories compared to about 2k-2.5k calories of muscle/liver glycogen.    I understand basal/resting metabolic rates, I'm not trying to have a pissing contest with you, and I agree with you. walking around with 80lbs of stuff will burn fat quick, that's why I program heavy carries into my clients fatloss workouts.  I wasn't saying you should live off fat reserves, you can, yes. Will it be miserable and effect performance, of course.    3% is closer to the vital fat level for men..."

Right now what you're saying is hardly more feasible than supposing that ebola mutates and starts turning people into rage-zombies or that Jade Helm actually was a secret plot to impose martial law on Texas. I mean sure, if you just make up a bunch of stuff, maybe possibly it could be an issue, but the number of things that have to happen before then are about the same as the number of things that have to change before we can have a successful Mars base.   In the mean time, there are disasters that are a million-billion times more likely, and topping the list are health issues, several slots down are all the mundane problems, and two slots above ""rapture"" and ""evil lizard men"" but trailing behind ""cloned semi-sentient dinosaurs escape resort park and begin taking over the world"" is what you've proposed."

preppers,366pu9,Arowx,-3,Sun May 17 02:06:15 2015 UTC,Just cause I'm fat doesn't mean my shooting goes away or the years of experience in survival don't matter. Ain't always gotta run.
preppers,366pu9,DocTorrFabulous,12,Sun May 17 01:14:16 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying I'm not picking on your in particular, but rather the style of thinking that often accompanies such ""I won't have to run, I can shoot"" statements. I dont know you, your abilities, or your relative fatness, nor do I want to turn this into a bullshit FPH fight.  No, your being [I presume significantly] overweight or even obese does increase your risk of diabetes, joint disease, heart disease, and injury in addition to the negative effects of acute strenuous weight loss. Shooting is one of the least important aspects of survival. If you're laid up with a twisted ankle or out of breath from a meager hike, your shooting ability and other skills will e severely limited. Nothing inducing internalization/tunnel vision quite like exertion/pain-induced stress.  Now as to fat vs fit, the honest answer is really neither. Sub-ten percent bodyfat means you have less caloric reserve to work with and means that a short fever or injury that hinders your ability to acquire food will put you at a more extreme disadvantage. In other words, having a six-pack is less than ideal. On the other extreme, being above twenty percent bodyfat puts you a higher risk for injury and illness and reduces your mobility. All the figures above are approximate and should increase about five to eight percent for most women because of physical differences in fat storage. Also because boobies.   So to recap, your health is your primary prep and the one you're msot likely to benefit from. If you're unsure, have someone else who doesn't mind hurting your feelings tape you out for BMI* and/or bodyfat to get a general idea of where you fall along the population. At your next visit to a doctor, ask for a bodyfat measurement, or if you can afford it get a full physical, and listen to what the doctor actually says about your health. Take up some form of strenuous exercise, practice mock bug-outs, and set specific performance goals so you can't lie to yourself about your own fitness.   *I'm going to head the ""but BMI's not accurate because of athletes"" off at the pass. If you think BMI won't accurately place you along the US population, feel free to post a neck-down picture of yourself with a sign in workout gear along with some performance stats such as weight lifting, run distance/time, or some other metric to show how you're a specialized athlete capable of incredible feats and built of so much muscle that your skew the BMI/bodyfat [which are different measurements] readings. I've met exactly one other prepper who was a special snowflake as far as BMI/bodyfat, but as a general rule an NFL linebacker is not a great body type for survival, as it's a very calorie and work intensive bodytype, and very specialized in how it performs."

Also you're prepping for a classic world war II invasion force, when drones are the next invasion force for a non nuclear world war III (or even post nuclear WWIII).  Automated armed drones can fly/drive and potentially shoot while moving at above local road speed limits and be so small they are almost impossible to hit (think flying birds/clay pigeons but armed and armoured) and they don't have the in built human aversion to killing often found on human battlefields (muskets found with multiple un-shot musket loads on historic battlefields, world war II and vietnam era statistics that indicate most human combatants do not aim to take another life).  Armed drones with a handful of rounds could in theory attack in mass swarms (thousands) with facial recognition programs (found in modern mobile phone cameras) that help target their enemy.  OK you probably don't believe me Chris Kyle an elite special forces sniper noted as killing about 160 enemy combatants.

And I have a few bones to pick.   Many preppers recommend stockpiling gold or silver in case of an economic collapse where currency loses its value... he is skeptical about [gold and silver's] usefulness in day-to-day transactions after a disaster. ""Folks can't eat gold and silver,"" he says.    No, folks can't eat gold and silver. But they can't eat a now-worthless piece of paper, either. If the dollar collapses, at least PMs still have value, even if they make a lousy day-to-day barter item. You should still have some sound coin stashed, but this scenario highlights the importance of storing useful barter items that DO have day-to-day trade value. Think of the same prep items you store for your own family and store a surplus to use for barter.   If you purchase a water filter (stuff) and throw it in a closet, you take the risk that the filter may not work, may be damaged or may just plain fail when you need it most. On the other hand there are at least half a dozen ways to disinfect suspect water (skills) if you know how — heat (boiling), chemicals (chlorine bleach, iodine) solar radiation (SODIS), ultraviolet light (UV), etc.   While I don't at all dispute that having skills is of monumental importance, his claim is a little contradictory. All of the methods take some kind of ""stuff"" (albeit some of that ""stuff"" is much more readily available than others). I'm not versed on it so correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't treating water with the Ultraviolet method take just a taaaad more ""stuff"" than a simple handheld pump water filter?  This is a good little intro write-up for somebody completely foreign to prepping, but I think if you subscribe to this sub, even if you're a very novice prepper, there's nothing in here you don't already know. That being said, I'm glad to see articles like this on mainstream sites like Yahoo Finance."

There are quite a few hours of time spent on each pelt to process it properly. There is no shortage of material in most urban/suburban environments. The need for pelts is limited to very cold regions where you actually need a fur coat. You would be better suited to secure some nice long term winter wear. If the time comes that all your clothes are worn and you need to make your own then yes, you can use the hides but you will also need the skills and tools to process the hides into usable clothing.   I would definitely agree that a diversified farming selection is best for many reasons but most of all for variations in your diet. I don't know how healthy one can be living on crickets or insects alone. A variety of protein sources is always going to be your best choice as far as health and sustainability is concerned. A small farm environment incorporating aquaponics, crop farming and small animal production is certainly viable with enough land. You can grow crops to feed the animals and fish. You can use earth worms to break down wastes into fertilizers and use the worms to supplement your feed sources."

preppers,364bp1,affordableweb,4,Mon May 18 14:35:59 2015 UTC,its not land used you should worry about but amount of food needed for the livestock to grow   This is the correct answer here. How much space you have to raise animals is less important as your feed to food production ratio.   There are many in here suggesting rabbits but the feed costs on rabbits can be high unless you have a free or very cheap source of food. If you have enough land to plant alfalfa and/or Timothy hay you can feed lots of rabbits and other small game animals.  Crickets are high in protein but low on the edibility scale. They are not very appealing and have limited options on how you prepare them. Their barter value is reduced when you consider most people have not or will not consume bugs.  I would suggest you look over your land and determine what it might be able to support on its own. Goats are excellent foragers and have low overhead costs if you have the right underbrush and pasture land available. Certain pig breeds are excellent foragers and can convert most waste food products into usable protein faster than other animals.   Chickens are cheap and easy to raise but generally require you purchase feed for them. If you can farm or raise your own food sources like earth or meal worms then chickens are probably your fastest growing food source with only 8 weeks needed for certain breeds to be table ready.  Aquaponics is awesome but once again requires an inexpensive feed source for best value. Fish ponds are nice because they serve multiple purposes including water and food sources but ponds also attract animal and human predators.
preppers,364bp1,tekgnosis,1 point,Sat May 16 00:38:48 2015 UTC,Time also needs to be taken into account with the area figure as something that takes twice as long to produce as another effectively requires twice the land for the same output.
preppers,364bp1,affordableweb,2,Sat May 16 12:35:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Food production time and also food storage capabilities are going to be key to your success. Most crops are seasonal so you'll have to plan ahead for example if you wanted to grow your own animal feeds.   Crops will have to be processed and stored until your next harvest. If a flock of birds or litter of animals all come due for slaughter at the same time you will have to have ways to extend the life of that food as well. You'll have to look at smoking, canning or dehydrating your meats to store up between harvests.   Growing your own food basically becomes a way of life when you consider all that must go into it."

If you have a garden then chickens are easy, you can just give them all of your garden scraps, slugs, and pests you find. Chickens eat relatively little and will forage without running off. Goats are going to eat a lot and require lots of maintenance, rabbits eat a lot but are low maintenance. I have no idea what crickets eat, but I doubt throwing them scraps will work."

preppers,364bp1,autowikibot,2,Sun May 17 07:07:22 2015 UTC,"Cowpea:       The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is one of several species of the widely cultivated genus Vigna. Four subspecies are recognised, of which three are cultivated (more exist, including V. textilis, V. pubescens, and V. sinensis):  Cowpeas are one of the most important food legume crops in the semiarid tropics covering Asia, Africa, southern Europe, and Central and South America. A drought-tolerant and warm-weather crop, cowpeas are well-adapted to the drier regions of the tropics, where other food legumes do not perform well. It also has the useful ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through its root nodules, and it grows well in poor soils with more than 85% sand and with less than 0.2% organic matter and low levels of phosphorus.  In addition, it is shade tolerant, so is compatible as an intercrop with maize, millet, sorghum, sugarcane, and cotton. This makes cowpeas an important component of traditional intercropping systems, especially in the complex and elegant subsistence farming systems of the dry savannas in sub-Saharan Africa.  In these systems the haulm (dried stalks) of cowpea is a valuable by-product, used as animal feed.  Research in Ghana found that selecting early generations of cowpea crops to increase yield is not an effective strategy. Francis Padi from the Savannah Agricultural Research Institute in Tamale, Ghana, writing in Crop Science, suggests other methods such as bulk breeding are more efficient in developing high-yield varieties.   According to the USDA food database, the leaves of the cowpea plant have the highest percentage of calories from protein among vegetarian foods.

preppers,364bp1,mcapello,3,Sun May 17 11:40:20 2015 UTC,"First let's narrow it down: ruminants. Cows, sheep, goats, and so on.  This category wins because it can convert grass and otherwise inedible vegetation into protein, with few if little inputs. Landrace breeds of cattle and sheep can forage on rough country with little in the way of supplementary feed. The resulting meat won't be marketable in a modern setting, but in a survival scenario the animals will survive and so will you.  Now let's narrow it down even more: dairy.  Cows and goats (possibly sheep) that can double as a source of milk will provide even more protein than those merely slaughtered for meat. Being able to convert grass into liquid protein is a valuable trait. The ability to store protein in the form of cheese is also very valuable.  So there you have it: cows and dairy goats probably have the highest net protein per acre. Net is very important, because although poultry, rabbits, and so on are easier in some ways, they require protein feeds in order to give you protein back in a way that is not true of pasture animals."

Most shipping containers are sold through brokers - the brokers will rip you off. If you really want to buy a shipping container you have to buy it at the docks and arrange logistics yourself. You'll need to understand the quality of container you're buying, they come with ranking systems for quality. It also depends upon what coast you live on - on the West Coast in some ports they can be sold for scrap to China easier than they can be sold to a broker, but I understand there's plenty on the East Coast.   People also sell modified shipping container-like facilities that have built in air conditioning, electricity, and cooking facilities. Some are offices, some are for living in, some are bomb shelters. These run for a lot more, but you might have a company in your area that specializes in doing these conversions for you. You could also modify it for your needs, but it may not be up to county code to install it on your property.   Generally though, if you're looking to bury a shipping container, it's typically cheaper to hire a septic tank contractor. Pre-built concrete septic tanks may not be as large in size, but they'll run you $2k, whereas a nice container can cost $5k. Purpose built concrete containers for underground facilities are made by the large concrete builders - just tell them you'll looking to do a wine cellar.

By the time you insulate and modify a shipping container, you're nearly at the cost of buying purpose built anyway. If I was looking to stock a BOL, I'd look at trailers or RVs before a shipping container. Pull-behinds go for under ten grand and are easier to move, and come equipped for temporary living. The septic tank idea is a new one on me, and I like it."
preppers,35zwg9,Juicekid313,1 point,Fri May 15 00:15:43 2015 UTC,"The best deal I found was $10k for an already converted (and hardened) living quarters that was built to fit shipping container specs. It must have been sort of mobile living facilities for oil rig workers or something. The thing was badass with thick metal walls, insulation, wiring, it just needed a new generator and a propane tank: 8 bunks, separate living facilities, kitchenette with fridge, and shower. Like a super hardened RV.  Septic tanks are interesting, I guess the biggest problems are ventilation and the smaller entrance holes (24"" is common). Totally do-able as a storm shelter or for a few days. I think it's a really good ""better than nothing solution"" for the person who wants to make a small investment.   I'm currently most interested in beer and wine cellars. I spent mother's day at a winery that had a underground bunker where they aged the wine, built into the side of a hill. It was 20 feet wide, 60 feet deep, and the ceiling were 15 feet tall at least, one could easily park a small airplane inside. The entrance to the bunker was obscured by a barn, and you wouldn't even know it was back there, but I'm a snooper. I got into a conversation with the vineyard owner who said county code is basically non-existent for wine cellars and that the concrete structure was poured decades ago, has held up with no problems, and way cheaper than anything else. We got into a conversation about preppers and he told me there was another cellar in the main house, much deeper in the ground, with thicker doors, that they use for wine but would double as a fall-out shelter. He recommend building a cellar because anyone can easily get a county permit for a cellar, but a bomb shelter raises alarms and inspections."

There is a reason castles stopped being built as soon as gunpowder became widely available.  If you expect civilization to fall to the point of crossbows and catapults, go with God, but if you think your adversaries might have access to even low explosives, I recommend against medieval fortifications.  Tall masonry walls just make more heavy stuff to fall on your head, when the cannon and mortar are firing.   Edit: Sorry, see apology below..."

I've only opened one of the products so far - the Mint Hot Cocoa.  It was very good, but... well... it's hot cocoa which would be pretty hard to screw up.  One thing to point out about their pails in particular, is that their shelf life goes down to 1 year once you open the pail.  A couple Amazon reviewers have noted finding an open pouch in the bucket.  It seems the company has happily replaced the pouches in those instances of course, but if you can't open the pail to check your pouches...  All that aside, for me the sale price, the food reviews in places other than the Augason site, and the amount of food seemed solid so I bought a few items to give a try.  I wouldn't invest a lot of money in any particular food solution until you've tried them."

Not getting one that's been ragged out by some podunk police department is worth an extra twenty dollars. They're not hard to take down, and they work. For a collector, by all means get the Remington, but for someone on a shoestring budget the Remington offers nothing that the Maverick doesn't.   The purpose of an extra barrel is to have both the short and longer barrels, so for someone on a shoestring budget they can use it as a hunting gun and a defensive gun if they want. It's not about shooting through barrels.   I think you're confusing the target of my advice. For peopel that like guns and have extra crash, this is a great no-brainer. For people on a budget who want a utility gun, the Maverick tends to be a better idea."

Then you go on to compare it to a budget model. No one says the Mossberg is a bad gun, but it's comparable to the express, not the wingmaster, not by a mile.

For comparisons sake, I was looking at what the manufacturers websites posted for the value of two firearms in brand new condition. No, I didn't look at your local Walmart, cabela's, eBay, gunbroker, or pawnshop to find the lowest price and use those numbers, I was looking for a quick number to use in an argument."
preppers,3600tu,latexsteve,1 point,Fri May 15 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"I was comparing the value    Well, I'm not sure how you're doing that if you're not looking at the ""legitimate market"".   Manufacturers stamp MSRPs at arbitrary levels. By not looking at the ""legitimate"" or ""market"" ""value"" of something, by default you're looking at ""illegitimate"" ""inflated"" ""costs"" of something. Cost and value are not related.   For example, look at Desert Tech: sure they're high quality and very high MSRP, but there's lots and lots of high quality items on the market that perform just as well - so how could the value be much different than a Remington 700 SPS with an upgraded stock if they're both shooting sub MOA? One costs $1,500, the other costs $4,500+.    No, I didn't look at your local Walmart, cabela's, eBay, gunbroker, or pawnshop to find the lowest price and use those numbers   Going forward, I would recommend checking Gunbroker or Armslist exclusively - this is because you'll inevitably come across the Desert Tech rifle that's ""$2,000 OBO"", far below MSRP prices, because it reflects the actual market.  Value is in the eye of the beholder, but is relational to usefulness, not MSRP. The real value of both of these shotguns is pretty equal."

Your needs are different from my needs, and things like your driving habits and ""SHTF"" needs will determine what is best. For instance, a family of six that needs to be able to drive five-hundred miles to a BOL will not be able to utilize a two-door light pickup, but a family of two that lives outside the city and drives forty miles to work is going to be murdered by gas on anything with significant off-road capabilities, and the savings in gas would be better spent elsewhere.   For most everyone, offroad capability should be fairly low on the list. Farm roads or other rough and frequently washed out roads would be a great exception, but the fantasy of needing a full off-roader in a real SHTF scenario is as ludicrous as the fantasy of needing an anti-materiel rifle. Sure you can dream up special circumstances, but unless you can pull out google maps and makes a great case for an exact route and why you realistically need that route, the money's better spent elsewhere.   I tend to favor something small, gas mileage and AWD are high on the list, and once cargo is considered something like a Subaru Outback or Forrester is my ideal.

For me personally I live in an area that gets TONS of snow so I can argue that 'offroad' (or 4x4) capability is very important.  No I won't be rock crawling but if there is a major snow storm I need to be able to get around.  A Subi/AWD vehicle would be great in a warmer climate where feet of snow don't pose a threat.

The best and safest thing to do in a major snowstorm is shelter in place. Do you live in a place where it snows that heavy often enough to need that capability in a daily driver, or would a used ATV do the same job in the slim percentage of situations where you need extreme offroading capability?"
preppers,35wjta,Dekans,3,Thu May 14 16:33:32 2015 UTC,To do what?   Go to work.  Notice this post was about daily drivers.  I need to be able to get to work with this vehicle if there is a snow storm.  I still go to work usually if there is a large snow storm.  A foot of snow is no big deal here.  24in?  Sure I'll give it a go.  Not many small AWD cars are going to be getting through that very well.  AWD cars are good for snowy roads but not deep snow.    Now lets talk SHTF situation.  Short term - bug in.  Don't go anywhere.  No car helps in that situation.  Long term I will need to go somewhere and eventually I KNOW there will be a snow storm.  I'm going to need a truck/large SUV with 4x4.  A small AWD car simply will not do here. Lots of people drive them but I assume those also aren't the people with our mindset....  Now I want to make it clear I'm not bashing your opinion.  My first response was 'Very good post. You are very right'.  If you live in a warm weather climate a small AWD hatchback might be the best option.

Do you have enough gas stored to go where you need to go?   I have a few gas cans that I can use to get somewhere in an emergency.  I am going to stay where I am as long as possible because most everything I could need is here BUT in the off chance I do need to get somewhere (lets just say away from a threat (human)) and its very snowy I'll be bombing away in my truck rather than risking getting stuck in car.  Or lets say a loved one is for some reason not at home base during a SHTF situation (maybe at work or long term hunting a considerable distance away) I can easily retrieve them.

Prepare for the worst?????   No, the backbone of prepping is preparing for the likely, the manageable, and keeping everything within reason. Prepping is just another form of risk management, a significant portion of which is recognizing realistic risk, like not driving in two feet of snow when unnecessary and not making up fringe fantasy scenarios to justify a vehicle purchase.   I know plenty of people in both the NC mountains and in Michigan who don't own trucks and do just fine. If you were actively farming, moving cattle, and using a truck as a truck, then yeah, you need a truck. If you're not, then you don't need a truck, especially not as a daily driver.   The focus of this thread was a serviceable DD that would also cover your ass in a SHTF scenario, and now you've whipped out a bunch of highly unlikely ambiguous scenarios to justify buying a truck."
preppers,35wjta,jswck,3,Thu May 14 20:26:52 2015 UTC,I've got both - a BMW and a Chevy Silverado.  The Chevy is my daily driver and SHTF vehicle if need be.  The BMW is a fun toy and if need be I'll leave it behind in a survival situation.    I've lived in MI for 25 years and still have a home there. I am currently spending a few months in NC for work but return to MI often and will be back there permanently.  I guess we just plain disagree here but I think that I require a 4x4 vehicle in my location.  I live in a rural area that gets plowed last.  If I want to call off work all the time and drive a AWD car I could but i prefer to have 4x4 and get where I need to go.    'preparing for the likely' - it is very likely in my area that there will be heavy snow.    This was a IYO thread so i guess were entitled to our own opinions....

Sure it's a fire that you can set ontop of your table, looks great and has a nice glass lantern globe around it but it's a campfire for 80$ that can only burn twigs or other small pieces of wood.

You could encourage the correct freezing ""direction"" by painting the top black the middle gray and the bottom white.  It will then freeze bottom up and as long as it isn't full should just expand into that area.   I'd test this out first, of course, but it should work.

You could build a purpose built water heater into you water storage using something like a copper pipe and a rocket stove. I've seen a solution on youtube when I was looking up DIY water heaters.  Finally, burying your water storage would be the best long term solution. Once you get 5 feet down the earth is a constant 55 degrees Fahrenheit (no idea what that is in non-America).

preppers,35uqdq,edheler,1 point,Wed May 13 21:36:34 2015 UTC,What does your wife have against plastic water containers? Seems like an irrational stance that's only serving to make life difficult.
preppers,35uqdq,rolahey,2,Wed May 13 20:58:17 2015 UTC,"Since we will be using this as a daily water supply, she is worried about leeching of chemicals into the water.  BPA etc.  She is very concerned about moving from a ""safe"" system of municipal water to an unproven system of off the grid with rainwater.  I've found filtration systems (like NBC) that can take care of rainwater and make it drinkable, but it will not take out the leeched hormone mimics - which is what she is concerned with.  Personally, I don't think the municipal system is safe, and I think that a tank (like the one /u/States_Rights linked) is going to be the best bet for a solution.  But if a tank was available that met her needs and wasn't going to break the bank - I figured this sub might know."
preppers,35the3,PrepperModerator,8,Wed May 13 11:14:59 2015 UTC,"Hurricane  season is about to start, well it kinda already started, so I restocked my extra water supply. I also ordered my new emergency radio, stocked up on a few more canned goods and restocked my battery supplies. As the month goes on I'll probably up the water storage and add a few new things to the first aid kit."
preppers,35the3,return_of_Justin_noe,2,Wed May 13 14:37:18 2015 UTC,I don't live in a hurricane zone so I'm curious.  I always see windows boarded up during hurricanes on the news.  Do you keep boards around for this?  Is it even realistically done?
preppers,35the3,battleshorts,5,Wed May 13 19:31:00 2015 UTC,"The boards are used by people who are unprepared.  Anyone who lives in an area where hurricanes are a matter of when not if would be well served buying hurricane shutters. They come in multiple styles and are usually we very easy to put up. They are much faster to put up then boards, don't look like shit and general won't mess up the side of your home like drilling boards in will. They also make what are called impact glass windows that are usually rated to withstand a category 3. You do not want to be stuck unprepared when the storm watch or warning goes into effect and have to scramble to go buy cheap boards that may or may not even be left in stock. Right now I live in an apartment that already has the shutter brackets installed so all I would have to do is screw in the shutters. 20 mins and a ladder and I'm done. Most decent apartments include these down here. To answer your question, yes many people use plywood boards for hurricanes but those are the people who didn't prepare"
preppers,35the3,return_of_Justin_noe,2,Wed May 13 19:39:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!
preppers,35the3,battleshorts,1 point,Wed May 13 19:47:50 2015 UTC,No problem.
preppers,35the3,return_of_Justin_noe,2,Wed May 13 20:21:22 2015 UTC,"The wood drives me nuts too! We live in South Florida and have Cat 5 windows as well as metal hurricane shutters. You can never be too prepared, IMO. The shutters also cut down on the cost of homeowner's insurance so there is an added plus in buying them. You're right, they are easier to put up and don't look like crap as the wood does. Most of the time, people buy pressboard which really isn't going to work in a bad hurricane, and will be useless afterward. It isn't a cost-effective or effective way to protect a home and its residents from a hurricane."
preppers,35the3,rolahey,1 point,Sat May 16 21:51:52 2015 UTC,"South florida for me also. You are right, I didn't even think to mention the insurance savings because I'm renting right now. With florida having the highest home owners insurance rates in the country they could easily pay for themselves. There is no reason to go with the boards"
preppers,35the3,return_of_Justin_noe,2,Sat May 16 22:48:49 2015 UTC,"The boards are so lame. Inside of 3 years, the shutters paid for themselves at my house. Much safer too. I even have then for the garage door. Gotta protect my classic Vette. She's not a prep, she's a family member. lol"

preppers,35the3,theillest723,7,Wed May 13 13:16:32 2015 UTC,Good work! Do you have any outstanding questions about prepping that you've been trying to get answered or that have been on your mind?
preppers,35the3,fidelitypdx,2,Wed May 13 15:29:32 2015 UTC,"well, I live in hurricane alley so that's my main prep goal right now. I think that once I feel comfortable with a 2-3 week storage plan I will upgrade from there for more serious disasters/events.   I guess my first question is how long should I expect these gallon jugs of water to last before the plastic starts degrading. I read somewhere about the plastic cracking after a few months or so. I don't have room for the 80 gal containers. :/  edit - additional questions: where do i start with canned food? I've never been a good chef, nor creative in that dept. Ideally, I'd like to have a variety of meals with healthy options that have some form of meat/greenery"
preppers,35the3,theillest723,2,Thu May 14 00:43:27 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere about the plastic cracking after a few months or so.   You know, I've read that too, but I honestly think it's bullshit. I bought a bunch of gallon jug containers that have sat in my garage for years, freaking 5 years now, and my garage gets cold enough to freeze and also over 110 degrees in the summer. 1 broke during a deep freeze, but also my pipes froze. So, there's the theory that plastic jugs break down in UV light - but, I've used an old 1-gallon jug in my garden (and keep it outside) for about 3 years now. That jug gets strong morning sun light every day and exposed to the elements, plus filled with water by being blasted full force with a hose. Truth be told the plastic doesn't feel as strong as it once did, but it's still fine. Yet, I read all the time that these gallon jugs will break down, crack, ect. I haven't seen it yet, YMMV.   The real concern about plastic jugs is the drop problem. If you drop a jug of water it can shatter. I think it's useful to have a variety of water containers: a case (or 5) of water bottles from Winco or Costco, several 1-galon containers, a couple of the 2.5 gallon containers with the pour spout, and then pick up some of the 5-gallon variety when you see them on sale at sporting good stores (and also sporting teams sometimes offload theirs on craigslist). I really like my Water Bricks, but they're a big investment. In the long term, look for a 55-galon drum or IBC tote on Craigslist, I've scored a bunch of food-grade containers for free just by being willing to pick up someone's old rain catch system. You may not have room at your property, but it's possible you could find a friend who is perfectly happy to put it in their garage or backyard. Prepper meetups are great spots to meet these type of friends.    where do i start with canned food?    I actually recommend you don't start with canned food at all. Start by stockpiling and buying more of the food you already eat. Go with the foods that make you (and your family) happy and comfortable. Most conventional food has a shelf-life of 6+ months, and it's very easy (and also inexpensive) to steadily buy slightly more food at the store than you normally do, and to put that extra food in pantry. You may need to modify the foods you keep in your diet in order to have the preparations to make it off-grid - for example, I love spaghetti, but I need to run two stoves if I want to make the sauce, so I started buying pre-made sauce that I enjoy while also making my sauce in huge bulk and canning it, and now I'll just make the noodles - I can heat the sauce if I want to, but it isn't entirely necessary.  The problem with buying canned food is that you'll never eat it. I did this, ever prepper has: you buy $50 worth of canned food, you put it in the pantry, 3 years go buy and you never ate it, it's expired. Now what? Go waste another $50? Nope - it's a terrible idea. Spend that $50 on buying more of the food you already eat and clearly label the expiration date and just consume it before then.  Here's my thread on food and water preps, feel free to ask questions."
preppers,35the3,fidelitypdx,2,Thu May 14 16:58:23 2015 UTC,First defense weapon? I've been in the market for a firearm anyways. I know for my level of prepping it's not really a necessity.
preppers,35the3,theillest723,2,Thu May 14 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"Depends upon what you want to do with it. I've actually been planning to write out a longer article on this for sometime.  Basically you have the choice between rifle, pistol, and shotgun.   Then you have a couple Use Cases for these weapons:   Home Defense Self Defense Community Defense   If your primary goal is to protect your house, all 3 weapon types are perfectly acceptable. I normally recommend a pistol or shotgun though. It's easier to maneuver with a pistol. A shotgun's versatility allows you to load all sorts of rounds that have advantageous: you can load birdshot that won't go through your apartment wall, or you could load slugs and buckshot that will obliterate things you hit with it.  If you primary goal is to protect your body and your family's body, then a pistol is the best self-defense weapon out there. A pistol can be concealed on you in times of emergency and you can carry it everywhere easily.  If you are most concerned about political unrest or outside violence to your community, then a military grade rifle (like an AR15) is the best option. Any rifle can do the job, even a WW2 rifle. In a community defense situation, a pistol and shotgun are not ideal, because the person with the longer-range weapon will just pin you down with fire. While it's possible to use a shotgun with slugs to aim at targets far away, you have a limited magazine size (usually no more than 6-10) and much slower rate of fire.   For most people, they have no interest in setting up check points in their neighborhood or sitting on roof tops to deter looters, so for most people a pistol is a perfectly fine first weapon. I highly recommend Glocks for a huge combination of reasons, with #1 on the list being extended magazines, #2 being that those magazines can be utilized in certain rifles. Before you buy a pistol, I would recommend you head to your local shooting range that allows you to rent their guns, then shoot every single pistol they have there in order to get an idea of which ones you like. Some guys hate Glocks, for example, and I would hate for you to rush out and buy a Glock only to realize you strongly dislike how it feels in your hand. I also recommend you buy a used weapon and not a new one.  Hope that helps!"

This week's highlights are a 4 mile run in about 35 minutes and a 6 mile hike with my BOB plus extra water and a ten-pound dumbbell.  We bought a metric crap-ton of tomatoes at the farmers market this week, so we've been canning homemade salsa and spaghetti sauce. That, and we experimented with using my grill and the fire pit for all of our cooking on Saturday. I need to start stocking up on either firewood or charcoal for that plan to be viable for longer than two or three meals, though.  Also, my wife and I ran a couple of drills on our home defense plan. It's mostly focused on dealing with a break-in, but I think it'll work against a more severe scenario too."

preppers,35the3,kapolani,2,Wed May 13 16:02:02 2015 UTC,Started working on my first raised garden beds. I'd like to get my tomatoes planted by the weekend!
preppers,35the3,Bjolfr,4,Wed May 13 16:47:33 2015 UTC,"One of the things most folks don't know about tomatoes is that they love to be transplanted really deep. When you do replant your tomatoes, make sure you only leave the top 6” or 1/3rd of the plant above ground: just bury the rest. Tomatoes have a property where the buried parts of the plant will absorb water and nutrients just like a root – so every time you bury it deep your essentially adding on roots to the plant – this will cause the growth to supercharge!  In order to maximize this effect, I keep all of my tomatoes in containers and transplant them into larger and larger containers every few weeks. I have some really deep garden beds and some really large pots, so around early/mid July I’ll actually plant my tomatoes in the beds, until then I just keep transplanting them over and over again. On average I'll transplant each of my tomato plants 3-5 times, depending upon if it was a seedling or start. The biggest containers I'll use are 7.5 gallons, with the plant being 4 feet tall before it even ends up in the ground (and those plants can grow 15-20 feet tall). This is how I grow tomatoes to yield the largest results.   Also, pruning tomatoes is pretty critical – if you haven’t looked into a technique called “Single Stemming” you should! Basically tomato plants will naturally grow out into a bush, this causes them to focus on growing unnecessary parts of the plant instead of producing fruit, but removing these unnecessary branches the plant’s harvest will be 3x-10x the size.   Good luck!"

preppers,35the3,illiniwarrior,1 point,Thu May 14 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"off shoot leaf stems    Yep. Those are usually called ""suckers"" and I re-plant all of mine in order to propagate the plant. ""Single Stemming"" is the technique to remove the suckers so the plant focuses on vertical growth.  Though, you don't necessarily have to prune anything off when you transplant."
