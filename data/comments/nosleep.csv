I think the skinned men are some sort of specter or unidentified boogeyman that roams the woods and makes his/her home at the Treehouse. A serial killer since he/she keeps track of his/her kill count by carving their name on the Triple tree.  And for some reason, carving your name on the Triple Tree saves you because the killer thinks you're already on the tally.  And the metallic sound is probably from the machinery the killer uses to, well do his deed of the day/week/month."

But there's something about that part of the country, the way the forest just seems to drop away into misty ravines, the caves and strange rocks, the old buildings, many of them abandoned, set way back from the road so you can just glimpse them through the trees.

nosleep,3dzfcu,hoodballoon,124,Mon Jul 20 19:50:28 2015 UTC,"In order by date:  A few months ago I received a batch of emails not intended for me. Some sort of glitch. They were dated over 17 years ago, and one day they just started showing up in my Inbox, out of order. The emails were concerning a horror film entitled “Twigsy.”  I’ve pasted them below in the order I received them. In some strange way, I think they were meant to be read this way.    Date: Tue, Jan 6, 1998 at 11:17 AM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: Twigsy  Thanks for reaching out - how did you get my email? We’re definitely interested. Fascinating stuff, very lifelike. Lot of shaky cam, but this may add to realism. May be a little much. Too frightening. I’ll check with Laura.  Talk soon. I really think we have something special here.  Jack    Date: Mon, Jan 19, 1998 at 10:14 AM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: Twigsy  Sorry it took so long to get back to you about Twigsy. Took a look, and we’d love to develop further. First impressions: Plot is a little murky. Some third act problems, but visuals off the charts. Quite visceral. The kid lost in the woods, and stumbling upon the mystery door - right before getting snatched - wow is that tense. Voyeur shots a little out of focus, but Laura loves the realism.  Loved the Twigsy mythos. What else do you have?  J    Date: Fri, March 6, 1998 at 4:07 PM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: New Footage  Lot to say here. Laura and I watched twice. Have some thoughts:       Reveal of the face was brilliant. Just caught enough in mirror to be spooked - did you make that out of wax? Looked partially melted. Love to put you in touch with our wardrobe guys.     Some unanswered questions, but we could save them for sequel. What’s inside the door? How did the nameless become the “gatekeeper?” How many victims does Twigsy require? (It might be okay not to know this right now, audience wise. Just curious for my own understanding.)     Dialogue a little shaky. Woman begging for life - “I’ll do anything” - a tad cliché. Gatekeeper line - “Are you ready to meet Twigsy?” - before bringing victims to the door in the woods is a bit over the top.     Twigsy collectible figure?     Amateur actors are usually dogshit. Yours are incredible. Where did you find these people?   J    Date: Fri, March 6, 1998 at 4:16 PM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: New Footage  One more thing - the school scene goes a bit too long. Filming the kids walking to bus stop, getting on bus, recording entire bus ride, filming in front of school, crawling through the bushes and filming the class from the window - don’t need all of this. I think 30-90 seconds of quick cuts/montage will drive home the point. This gatekeeper is a bad guy. We know this. Don’t want to repulse viewers.  J    Date: Thu, April 30, 1998 at 11:49 AM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: budget  You still alive? Still waiting on new Twigsy cut. Call Stephanie when you drop it in the mail. I’m making it priority one when it arrives.  Potential poster: “You find a cellar door in the woods. What do you do?”  Question from FX Dpt - how did you make Twigsy move like that? Puppeteering or stop motion? The leaves, branches, veins….Tom was fucking giddy about it.  J    Date: Mon, May 4, 1998 at 10:55 AM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: Sent  Spoke with marketing. Maybe push it back to this winter or next spring. Just spitballing: thinking a slow rollout. Heavy build. “Leaked” clips online. Maybe a fake website, interviews with families of the missing, rumors of the alleged mystery door in the woods, “who is Twigsy”? Christ, can you imagine? Give it some time. Real slow burner. So probably not the winter, January is shit. Maybe March or April. Really let the water boil on this one.  J    Date: Mon, May 4, 1998 at 3:31 PM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: Sent  Nothing is set in stone. I may have read your message the wrong way. Sorry if I did, but “don’t fuck with me” is a little unprofessional, don’t you think? We still hope to do this thing. These things take time. Sometimes you have to let the pros handle their own departments. You’re behind the camera, that’s what you do. Let the marketing team do the marketing. It’s their jobs.  I don’t want to be the heavy here. There’s no bad guys. Let’s just keep it civil. We don’t even have this thing locked down on paper, remember.  Looking forward to the next package.  J    Date: Fri, May 15, 1998 at 1:56 PM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: Sent  Are you kidding me with this shit? Is this some sort of a joke? What’s wrong with the other footage? This is unusable. I don’t even think I should have this in my office. If someone saw me - if my wife saw me watching this - Christ. What about the previous footage?  Just some small words of advice: no one in their right mind wants to see a body dragged through the woods for 20 minutes. I don’t care what sickness you have. It’s unwatchable, but worse than that, it’s unmarketable.  And the audience won’t care about victims wearing hoods. You lose the emotional connection. The muffled screams are horrifying, but Christ. We want people so terrified and engaged that they won’t leave, not so fucking mortified they’ll walk right the fuck out.  I know we don’t have a deal yet. Nothing is signed. Think about what you want to do. If it’s with us, we can make it work somehow. If you want to move along, I know a few people. I can make some calls. Wouldn’t be the deal that we’re talking about, but it’d be good for you.  J    Date: Wed, May 19, 1998 at 12:10 PM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: still interested?  The deal’s off. No signatures. I’m washing my hands of this.    Date: Wed, May 20, 1998 at 12:05 PM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: Better?  I’ve cc’ed Laura for some fresh perspective. From now on, go through her.  J    Date: Wed, May 20, 1998 at 6:10 PM  From: j-------@a-------.com  Re: your wife  You wouldn’t dare say that shit to my face. Fucking chicken shit. Say it again. I’ll fucking end you.    Date: Mon, May 25, 1998 at 8:45 AM  From: l---@a-------.com  Re: re: fresh beginnings  Jack is taking a few days off. You can email exclusively with me now.  Laura    Date: Mon, May 25, 1998 at 8:58 AM  From: l---@a-------.com  Re: fresh beginnings  I sat with Jack a few months ago and watched early footage of Twigsy. Scary! Here’s what I’m thinking: the original plan was for a 15-25 minute short, but I think a feature is not out of the question. Jack had some reservations about pushing the envelope, but I think we can go further. I’ve seen what you can do, and I think with some tight editing, this can be something special. The eventual festival buzz will be key. Let’s do this as fast as possible.  What do you think? What do you need from me?  Laura    Date: Wed, June 3, 1998 at 1:26 PM  From: l---@a-------.com  Re: something new  I love it! Allison is faxing over the contract.  Also, you may have heard. Jack isn’t with us anymore. If you try to email him, it will bounce back.  Laura    Date: Wed, June 3, 1998 at 2:16 PM  From: l---@a-------.com  Re: meet?  I think that’s a great idea. Faxes are so impersonal, anyway. Question: I’m looking online, and I don’t see a road there. You may need to clarify. I’ve cc’ed Allison. She’ll be meeting you tomorrow afternoon to talk numbers.  I’m really looking forward to the new footage. Anything else you need?  Laura    Date: Wed, June 3, 1998 at 2:19 PM  From: a-----------@a-------.com  Re: meet?  I’m ready to meet Twigsy! How exciting :)  Best, Allison"

(DMMD is a yaoi game I've played that is basically a sci-fi story with lots of porn. The story is very good though and made me cry multiple times.) The main antagonist of the game, Toue Tatsuo, was looking for ways to control people's minds. As you progress through the routes you find out his methods, from using subliminal messages in music in ads and instilling rage through tattoos to genocide and creating humans with qualities that force people to listen to them by looking at their eyes or hearing their voice. This Dr. Kalivaki is too similar to Toue for my liking, I would keep an eye on him and maybe try to dig into his current research to see if you can possibly stop any heinous plans of his. Obviously most of the ""powers"" in DRAMAtical Murder can be nothing but fiction, but a few are plausible and it would be best if they never become reality. Do what you will given I only have a gay fictional example of possible evils, but every bone in my body is telling me something is majorly wrong about this situation and something needs to change."

nosleep,3e0do2,Mineruler,3,Tue Jul 21 03:24:49 2015 UTC,"Have you considered, OP, that where you exist may not be in this world at all-- that is, OUR world. Or rather, someone else is trying to make you percieve that you live in a ""different"" reality?  I just remember you mentioning the banging, and there being nothing but the computer there. That stuff doesn't exist in the real world, and yet you experienced that, along with the pay phone.  But then, you do distinctly remember someone grabbing you and moving you to this place, so this does beg the question if this is all just a set up by a rich sociopath.   Hm.... maybe this psychopath that kidnap you is making this world feel like another ""dimension"" to you, as you will. An experiment on tearing the human psyche from reality, and thus another dimension.  You only have contact via an old computer, and yet you question if we are real at all. I believe this the psychopaths goal: that even with contact like this, you will still question if whether we are real, or just part of the uncanny environment-- like the pay phone with its weird noises. Please be assured, therefore, that we are indeed real and are trying to help you. Try to fight against the psychological torment this person is throwing at you.  Also, be warned: if this is the only connection you have, he/she whatever may try to manipulate what you're getting off these posts: if he has the money to make such town, he can easily fuck with your internet connection.  I think he's also trying to get responses from people outside and get them into his ""little world"" as well. The fact we can connect to this website is curious, and somewhat dangerous. He may very well be trying to find another victim, or at least flaunting how powerful he is.   Have you tried sending your IP to someone so that they can track you? Can you in anyway use the internet to track yourself or place yourself on the world map? This still might not be possible, though, considering the above. Still, it doesn't hurt to try."

Take knives, put some in broomsticks to make primitive spears (i suppose you do have rope), baseball bats, lighter and combustible with water guns (plus deodorants and stuff alike for less range)...  As in the Mysterious Island (J. Verne, a classic), you have to think less on a short-time escape way and more in a I'm going to become strong here just in the case way.  And as I understand there are plenty of trees in the Black shit island, you could try and find an axe, chop some of them down and use them as a bridge? Or a bridge to the bridge?"

nosleep,3e0do2,staystrong2015,2,Tue Jul 21 09:55:49 2015 UTC,"Just checked it out. I haven't explored it down to the site code but I can give a brief summary. The site begins with a .jpg of a doorway and the word ENTER. the .jpg gets larger and 6 keys appear one at a time. Clicking it takes you to a page of a creme colored 90's computer monitor, which turns on to show a webpage, seemingly about the town that OP ended up at. There are 6 tabs, each one weirder than the last. The Home tab contains a Word From The Mayor, and a Subheading under that labeled Escape. The text starts out like a typical tourist advertisement but quickly turns odd. The About tab details things available to do in the town, but again, nothing is as it seems. The Subheadings are about as normal as it gets, and the text gets rather odd the more of it you read. What's stranger still is that the pictures don't contain anything relevant to the subheading, but rather just a bunch of JPGs of the black sludge the OP was talking about. The RMR Radio tab is a picture (gif?) of an old phonograph. An old 50's song is heard playing. The Shop Quickly tab contains the diary of one Thomas Lee, with the first entry dating back to April 3rd, 2012, and the last dating April 3rd, 2015, three years to the day. The entries start positive, but turn rather tragic towards the end. The Behind You tab consists of what OP was talking about in the first entry regarding the payphone. Shouting, sirens, general chaos can be heard. The Contact tab is the final tab, and clicking it directs the old monitor to what looks like a command line program. You are unable to type anything, but a message it typed out. I haven't read the whole thing, but it seems to be a message directly to whoever is reading it. Feel free to check it out, but I would advise you keep your volume low, and should you choose to turn off the monitor, do so at your own risk.  ~Ra1n"

Every link on that website seems to be trying to warn outsiders away from the town, but that's just me drawing conclusions from the webpage. I've started perusing the site code and this just gets weirder and weirder. For starters on the heading, where there appears to be black ink splattered, underneath it the code says ""PLEASEHELP"". Additionally, In the code for the About page, under the RMR Radio tab there is an addendum:   <!--if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, father matthew wouldn't be dead. Some records were off the air.-->    Another addendum is as follows:   <!--Not the Mayor: scream louder or you won't be heard. More to this place than you can see from here. slash then auntiemay-->   That's all I found in the site code that was odd. I gave a brief summary of the site in a reply to a user. I'll add that to this comment in the event someone needs it.   The site begins with a .jpg of a doorway and the word ENTER. the .jpg gets larger and 6 keys appear one at a time.

There are 6 tabs, each one weirder than the last. The Home tab contains a Word From The Mayor, and a Subheading under that labeled Escape. The text starts out like a typical tourist advertisement but quickly turns odd. The About tab details things available to do in the town, but again, nothing is as it seems. The Subheadings are about as normal as it gets, and the text gets rather odd the more of it you read. What's stranger still is that the pictures don't contain anything relevant to the subheading, but rather just a bunch of JPGs of the black sludge the OP was talking about. The RMR Radio tab is a picture (gif?) of an old phonograph. An old 50's song is heard playing. The Shop Quickly tab contains the diary of one Thomas Lee, with the first entry dating back to April 3rd, 2012, and the last dating April 3rd, 2015, three years to the day. The entries start positive, but turn rather tragic towards the end. The Behind You tab consists of what OP was talking about in the first entry regarding the payphone. Shouting, sirens, general chaos can be heard. The Contact tab is the final tab, and clicking it directs the old monitor to what looks like a command line program. You are unable to type anything, but a message it typed out. I haven't read the whole thing, but it seems to be a message directly to whoever is reading it. Feel free to check it out, but I would advise you keep your volume low, and should you choose to turn off the monitor, do so at your own risk.   If requested, I can do a full breakdown of the page and post my findings to this thread. Cheers, ~Ra1n"

nosleep,3dz8dn,BillyMaysNot,5,Mon Jul 20 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"I have had extremely similar experiences all throughout my life and I know OP is not making this stuff up. It started when I was in high school and I would have reoccurring episodes of sleep paralysis (your mind is awake but your body is sleeping) like what OP experienced. These occurrences would often terrify me and I would sometimes feel people creeping into my room and one time I kid you not there was a small woman (similar to the scary chick in the grudge) staring at me inches away from my face. All I could do was stare back in terror until I finally woke myself up. I have since then learned more about these experiences and how they lead to astral projecting and have tried to practice as much as I can as I think it is an extremely fascinating phenomenon. I have ""left my body"" a couple times and astral projected but it did not last very long and I am also a very frequent lucid dreamer. In one of my most terrifying experiences I could have swore that the being that I sensed in my room said ""The devil is real."" It's crazy what our brains can make us experience, just know you aren't alone OP."

I was literally in charge of the well being of us only at nine years old. Mum wouldn't get out of bed in day time. And the nights were endless with dad being such an drunk ass. Thankfully he is fully recovered. He turned to be a religious man. He couldn't lie himself perhaps no one anymore. I've seen him struggle fighting the damn bottle. He did have his few AA meetings. We all noticed how they began to make an effect on him. We were changing our family situation for the best. Now, here I am an old lady, recalling how sorry he was, confessing me, his eldest, how he almost killed my little brother in one of those drunk rages he had. His dad, my grandad, whom I never knew because he died when dad was 12, almost did the same to him. With my trembling hand I'm writing this, a lump in my throat and hot tears streaming my face with your experience. I know it's you. If dad made his peace with his past, absolutely you will too."

nosleep,3dz99m,Thanatos92,4,Mon Jul 20 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"Thanatos, I can not divulge my alias due to current involvement with the Agency, but I was there. I was the pilot waiting at the Bay of Harbours. When your group came, I thought the looks of morbidity and unadulterated terror were the normal looks after seeing so many of your allies being slaughtered. I didn't say anything, but I looked back after a while into the flight, your faces were still frozen with unspeakable fear. But yours, Thanatos, was the worst. At that moment, after seeing the horror on your face, the severity of what had happened struck me deep within my bones. I knew then why the Agency had called in for the back up extraction; what ever was out there was something not even the Agency's best could over come. Years after your face has still haunted me, along with something else. At night, out side of my location, I hear phantom gunfire resound through the area. I open my eyes and I see something black standing over me, but when I pull my weapon and aim, nothing is there but darkness. This has happened serveral times. Not to mention chairs that are knocked over when I turn on the lights to try and chase the gunfire away, or the table that has been flipped with documents scattering the floor. One night I found drops of blood leading to the outside. I chose not to fallow the trail because I was alone, but now the blood spatters lead to my bed. Thanatos, I think the mechanized unit is watching me. I feel darkness surrounding me as I type this. I'm going to call the Agency tomorrow and inform them that the location has been breached by unknown contact. You are forgiven."

The only reason they bother me so much is that I have had sleep hallucinations it's normally the same thing, which is that objects will turn into snakes. It startled me the first time my pencil turned into a tiny snake, but now I'm so used to it that when it does happen I just ignore it.  Insomnia is a bitch hun! lol  But in all seriousness...I honestly don't know why I see these things, I don't think I'll ever know.   Which might be for the best. O.o"
nosleep,3dz6ce,Anuacyl,2,Mon Jul 20 20:05:38 2015 UTC,"Dude, you saying you don't believe in ghosts is like a camper saying they don't believe in trees. Ghosts are very real, they are like thumbprints on the universe.. only instead of an impression left by bodily fluids they are an impression left by life energy (doesn't matter if they died there, as long as a strong sense of the person is there).   I would suggest try smudging the house with white sage to get rid of any malevolent beings (like the one that choked you). Perhaps seeing a psychic and asking if they can give you training, advice or a talisman to help you control your insight into the spiritual side of things.  Insomnia can occasionally cause people to see more clearly what other people are able to shut out (like spirits, aura's, etc.). Because not everyone can see these as clearly it's called hallucinations. Now while I know you said you've seen hallucinations of like your pencil turning into a snake, not all that you see are just hallucinations.   I know ghosts are real, I've had my experiences. Not all are harmful or scary, and not all are just observers. They are like living people, some are good some are ""get the f-ck away from me* horrible."

I have had these...I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to call them ghost right now, the ""things"" have always fallowed me, sometimes it's cause suffering for others, which is a another story I guess I'll post it?  But...I haven't had good luck with people who, try to help me. My Mother and me went to a flea market, it's a big one they have every summer that's two hours away, it's good for bonding time.   While we were there we bumped into this couple who...forgive me but I'm not sure what it's called? It involves crystals and chakras, that's all I know! lol  So while I talked to his wife he did the...crystal thingy on my mom, after that they talked for awhile about which ones were ""blocked?"" and exercise to help unblock them I guess?   So my mom stands up and pate the table ""you should do this"" I put up my hand and shake my head no, ""Eh...I'm good""  My mom keeps insisting and I keep saying no finally with a dead serious looks she glares at me ""you either do it, or you are walking home""   SIGH  I get on the table and I'm tense...I'm not nervous because of anything bad I'm sensing from the guy, which by the way...that's another issue of mine! So many issues...  As I'm laying there thinking this whole thing was asinine, he's places crystals on me and I'm stiff as a bored, I didn't relax till he put this big ass crystal in my hands. Some kind of quartz?  So he's doing his thing, I kinda blank out, I snap out of it when he shakily says he's done. He takes the crystals off me and as I sit up I realize how much of a mistake this was...  This nice old hippie is shaking, he looks out of breath, and like he's about to cry. In my head I'm like...""what the flaying batman is going on?""  I ask if he's okay, I can see his wife is concerned and my mother is confused. He says he's fine, but ask if he can have a hug, I cover it up, but I feel very awkward, and say of course, as we hug I throw a not so convincing smile to his wife and my mother.   He steps away from me and sits down in a chair pulls out a cigarette and stars smoking like a chimney, his wife and my mother go over to him and talk, I don't approach because I think I did enough damage...I look at all the crystals they have on some tables, his wife comes over to me and starts just putting certain gems and stone in my hands. She tells me what they are all for, but to be honest I was still worried so I didn't pay attention, tried to pay for them but she shook her head , told me to just take them. After a awkward parting...I was just about to tell my mom off for making me do that when I hear his wife, she runs up to me and says to take this as well. It's a big quarts on this cord that is green and purple. She tells me it was the first crystal her husband gave her, she wants me to have it!  I tell her I can't possibly take something so important, she says I can and I will. Says I need it more than her, she walks away.   I still have it, but to be honest I don't wear it much because the cord is a little itchy.   I guess...I honestly don't know if I believe in the ""Supernatural"" I do find it interesting, but generally don't think about it.   I just know that there might be something off about me, and I don't want anyone hurt. You know love?  Also! I'm curious about your experiences, I would love to hear some if you are willing to share?"
nosleep,3dz6ce,dqaf_420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:12:01 2015 UTC,"Those people sound like pagans (being one myself easy to recognize) who seem real in tune to their spiritual side. It's not uncommon for pagans to give gems or charms to people they sense need them. (I use pagan as an umbrella term to cover witches, wiccans, etc.) It also sounds like they did a reiki healing on you or a chakra cleansing.   I would suggest carrying the gem around in your pocket if the cord itches you or perhaps changing the cord to a chain or something. I'm sure you could find a jeweler to help with that for a fee.   As for one of my earliest experiences https://wh.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2azpki/my_ghost_sighting/ this one is the first I had. The one that stuck with me the most."

I also suffer from sleep paralysis and there was actually a time I was having nightmare, I told myself it was all just a dream and managed to wake myself up, only problem was...I couldn't move.   I have also suffered from this since I was little, but it very rarely happens. The first time it happened to me I was so scared because my eyes were open in my pitch black room, the only thing I could move was my pinky on my left hand.  And being a little brat still I was convince that I must be dying and cried my eyes out silently because I couldn't even make a sound. Finally passed back out from crying and woke up the next day fine.  I don't freak out as bad anymore, but sometimes I get this overwhelming feeling that something bad is going to happen, which I hear is pretty common for people suffering from it.  Which makes sense because not being able to move or make a sound...trapped in your body. Ugh...! Gives me the willies!"

Not because I'm afraid of becoming ordinary, it's just strange to think there is something out there influencing the things that happen to me.

I'm not sure the distinction matters. I wouldn't confuse them with ""god"" and ""angels,"" though.  Of course, there are myriad entities that alter the fabric of reality without necessarily interfering with the plan. Dæmons are certainly the most active in this regard, but it must be stressed that they aren't fallen angels, malevolent devils, etc."

nosleep,3duz1g,livensaurum,2,Mon Jul 20 01:14:09 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible that it merely spent time with you two in order to run scans on either one or both of you to determine if either or both of you would turn into VIPs without intervention.

nosleep,3duz1g,livensaurum,2,Mon Jul 20 01:23:12 2015 UTC,I guess my question is whether their goal is to prevent VIPs from becoming such?

The mind's creation of a ghost. Be careful about that ""just hallucinations"" thing though. Hallucinations can be as relevant, valid, and vividly present as the real thing. There will be unique elements when it comes to dream figures, or hallucinations. The important parts are usually in the details though, and less in the broader archetype of the figure/dream. There is potential understanding to be taken from those details, as the unconscious, through the vision, is often attempting to show some truth to the conscious mind...only in a symbolic form which is the only way the unconscious can present it's elucidations."

As far as details. Things like him being wrapped in a blanket, items he may have been wearing, that he wasn't facing you initially, that he was laying on the floor. The significance is difficult to speculate on as it could be nothing...but those details could have significance, particularly if you have a repeated or similar experience in the future.

The best way for me to explain what happen is that i wake up, but my brain is still broadcasting pictures from my dream. First time this happen it really freaked my out. I woke up lying on my side looking toward the bedroom door. The first thing i see is a giant ant on the floor. I mean, GIANT. Bigger then a normal dog. I got real scared and tried to scream but i could not make a sound. Witch was good, because if i could i would wake up the entire neighborhood. I could not move either, and it was like i was paralyzed. But for some reason my bladder seamed to be working just fine because i pissed myself when this huge ant started to make some strange sounds and walk towards me.   Just before it reach the bed i woke up for real. I could move again and the ant just disappeared. I was about 14 at the time so i did not understand what the hell just happen and i was very confused. I also had  to clean my sheets, air out my madras and clean my room after.. Really bad start of the day..  Now however, i'm 28, and i have learned how to control this and i always looking forward till it happen again. Since i can think clearly when my brain is still in a dream state i can to some degree manipulate what shows up in my room. Usually that mean a hot naked girl, but i also successfully got a dinosaur and a pirate with a talking parrot. (I will never grow up).   I have also failed horrible in my attempts to manipulate the few seconds before i wake up for real. Once a black hole spawned up in the far corner of the room and i swear i could feel the bed move a bit while all my stuff got sucked into oblivion.   Anyway, the state between dream and reality is amazing. However i also understand why people can be scared too death. It just feels so real. So for people who are not used to this kind of experiences it can be really confusing and they can actually believe its a real event. I think a lot of people who have seen ""shadow people"" or even Aliens or other creatures in their room actually is just experiencing a strong example of this state between dream and reality.   With that said. I'm not saying this goes for everyone. I believe that anything is possible. Even ghosts and shadow people."
nosleep,3duz1g,VansouI,3,Sun Jul 19 21:58:30 2015 UTC,Sleep paralysis. Causes you to hallucinate (dream while awake) is the explanation for all of this
nosleep,3duz1g,VansouI,3,Sun Jul 19 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"The best way for me to explain what happen is that i wake up, but my brain is still broadcasting pictures from my dream.   This is what confuses me about the stories of shadow people.  Your experience sounds very unique and I'm sure not very many people have dreamed of giant ants.  But to me, the fact that so many people are seeing the same type of shadow figure is strange.  It seems that we are all seeing a specific type of being.  Maybe I just don't understand the psychology well enough, but I don't understand how so many people would be subconsciously projecting the exact same thing."
nosleep,3duz1g,PencilErection,3,Mon Jul 20 00:01:15 2015 UTC,"I've hallucinated skunks with rainbow tails, fairies from The Legend of Zelda, and teleporting babies. Most hypnogogic hallucinations involve people or animals of some kind."

nosleep,3duz1g,RainTea,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:39:36 2015 UTC,"I have experienced this many times on sleep paralysis. All sorts of humanoid figures in the shadows walking, sitting, staring. Male and female, otherworldly and not. It all seems to depend on the particular thoughts and dreams I have at the time.  But, I have never been able to move or talk during sleep paralysis like you stated you did. Which leads me to believe that what you experienced was not sleep paralysis."
nosleep,3duz1g,RainTea,2,Mon Jul 20 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"imagining people where there aren't any is, like, 90% of what your brain does when it doesn't know what's going on (like when things are dark and you're sleepy)  try asking /r/Pareidolia if they've seen anything suspicious recently"
nosleep,3duz1g,brolovejinxs,3,Mon Jul 20 01:09:19 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I experience. It is hypnogogic, certainly, but is different from sleep paralysis. There are some people on here saying they aren't hallucinations, but what we experience is medically diagnosed as such; the definition, for those who are confused, is ""an experience involving the apparent perception of something not present."" You only need seek medical help, though, if they become violent."
nosleep,3duz1g,LoserGhostMachine,3,Mon Jul 20 01:29:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, seeing and hearing things can be a part of sleep paralysis, but it usually involves being paralyzed, and I think OP said she sat up."

My SO is always on call for work, so it's a habit to roll over and make sure he's still there.  And I also reached out to try and touch the shadow, which I thought was my boyfriend.  And then once I realized my boyfriend was laying next to me, I wrapped my arms around him and kind of hid my face from the shadow looking at me.  So I was definitely not paralyzed, although one of my friends has experienced sleep paralysis and it sounds absolutely terrifying."
nosleep,3duz1g,bassgirljc,2,Mon Jul 20 01:54:04 2015 UTC,"Sleep paralysis is different than hallucinations. They are called hallucinations because the person is awake and able to recall seeing objects, people, animals, etc. Episodes can last a few seconds to a few minutes. It can be jarring coming to full awareness from one."
nosleep,3duz1g,NeverDeny,4,Mon Jul 20 01:56:48 2015 UTC,Actually hallucinations are a part of sleep paralysis. The person is either fully awake or partially awake. The first and second paragraph of the article I linked to explain that...unless I'm reading it wrong.
nosleep,3duz1g,bassgirljc,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:02 2015 UTC,"Perhaps we weren't clear. Someone experiencing sleep paralysis can simultaneously experience hypnogogic hallucinations. However, it is also possible to have the latter only, without the paralysis. The danger with that is we can move around or react as though what we are seeing is real."
nosleep,3duz1g,thedogz11,2,Mon Jul 20 01:25:06 2015 UTC,The danger with that is we can move around or react as though what we are seeing is real.   It scares me that I tried to touch what I was seeing.  Luckily I didn't get out of bed but who knows what will happen if this happens again.

I was very obviously terrified.    But I told him I would wake him up next time.  If I see it and he doesn't, then I'll have an answer as to whether or not it's a hallucination or something else.  I've read stories of both partners seeing the same figure at the same time, so who knows what will happen in our case."
nosleep,3duz1g,TehKatieMonster,2,Mon Jul 20 00:32:22 2015 UTC,"I believe you saw something, too! But it's not a ghost or anything. I know I'm just some random reddit guy, but trust me that it is rare enough you don't hear about it from other people but common enough that it is medically diagnosed (though the cause is unknown).  I personally have other sleep issues, such as apnea, sleep talking/walking, and, much more rarely, sleep paralysis. The neural circuit that keeps someone paralyzed doesn't quite do its job with me, or you apparently. But this is not something you'll likely need professional help with unless you act violently during future episodes. Who knows, this could be the only one you ever have."

Used to happen when i was a child my parents would come check on me during the night, id wake up later in the night and see my mom walking towards me ( she wore a white nightgown )  used to freak me out id cry and scream ( i remember it like it was yesterday ) and call for my parents and 5hey come running in and pass through my ""mom"".

Only they follow the way the person moved ( mom walks in and checks pulse, i had a weird heart thing, kisses forehead and leaves, i awake see her approaching me nightgown hollow sleeve raises to my face and SSSCCCCRRREEEAAAAMMMM . ) does your partner kneel at the bedside before bed ( prayer or otherwise ? ) could explain why the image was next to the bed. Im not a disbeliever in unexplained, ive seen my share or weird and odd occurences ( chair where my cat used to sit still feels heavy at night like hes asleep on it .... been dead 10 years now, and quite a few other ...... things ) but i always try to find a "" real "" ( physical observable ) reason for strange happenings. Something cant be explained though and can make people think youve lost it.   My mother and her sisters used to see a man when they were kids, standing at the foot of their bed. Much taller than my grandfather. My uncle would tease them, then  one night they awoke to him knocking on the front door ( my uncle ) he apparently woke up saw a man in his room and jumped out the window. Years later they saw pictures of my grandmothers father ( she moved to canada from england with my grand father and didnt have pictures of her family until when i was born her sisters came to visit). All the kids said the man in the picture was the man they saw..... my grandmothers father. My grandmother had a dream of her dad saying "" just wanted to make sure you were all right, within the month they all stopped seeing it ( my grandmother and grandfather said the kids just had an overactive imagination, but my grandmother would "" eye smile "" ( you k ow that smile people give like a "" shhhh i know "" ) .my mom and aunts are in their 60s and 70s now, they still recount the stories."

When I got up to grab my blanket I saw my dad in the door frame of my room, I asked him if he could come in and grab my blanket for me. He just stared at me and I called for him again. Then he pointed at me and began laughing, no sound however. Then he turned and walked straight through the wall. I freaked and grabbed my blanket and pulled it over my head terrified. I've learned not to look around my room if I ever wake in the middle of the night because I also used to see a man with a trench coat and fedora on at the foot of my bed.

I was looking for something in the guest bedroom when I felt like i was being watch. I glance over my shoulder to see it standing by the door. I did a double take and turned all the way around only to see it glide out through the doorway. I was shocked so I slowly walked to the door but it was gone. I dont remember going into the bathroom or filling up the tub. But I do remember being underwater long enough that I started seeing a white light that seemed to be getting brighter. Then the light started faded away in the distance and I regain my senses and sit up to find out Im in the tub of water. Desperately trying to catch my breathe again, I was so confused. Right next to the tub was a statue of Jesus I guess I brought into the bathroom and I kind of broke down and started crying. I haven't seen the shadow since then."

Symptoms are pain, skin with discoloration, scabs, or ulcers, fever, low blood pressure, blisters, crackling in lungs, skin, or joints, numbness, pus, swelling, and foul-smelling discharge. It may be the mold you cleaned up earlier that's causing it. After doing some research I found an article about a fungus, Claviceps purpurea, which grows on wheat and other cereal and forage plants and can cause gangrenous ergotism. I would see a doctor asap because gangrene can be fatal. Good luck."

I woke up starting to answer.  He wasn't in the room, but he hardly ever is, so I got up to pee and locate him--the question in my head about the book seemed important.   He was dead on the guest room bed, face down, the book open to page 301. I loved him. I miss him, and every morning I still feel this urgency to find him and talk about his question.
