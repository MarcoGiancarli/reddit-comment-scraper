elonmusk,3d8bj0,LOLsim,5,Tue Jul 14 10:21:46 2015 UTC,"He's not the only one thinking about electric planes (though I don't think anyone else is thinking about electric supersonic jets). NASA has been doing quite a bit of research into this lately.  I don't think we're going to see the kind of electric jets he envisioned until batteries reach a higher energy density than they are right now. He's said that you need like 400 wh/kg to get cross country flights with a batter to plane mass of 70% (meaning 70% of the weight of the plane when it's loaded with cargo would be batteries). We'll probably see that in another 5 years if someone manages to commercialize solid state or semi-solid state lithium batteries.  Part of me suspects that he may retire from Tesla and start a new company after the release of the Model 3 that will work on electric supersonic vertical take-off and landing jets. Kind of crazy to imagine him taking on ANOTHER huge project like that, but knowing Elon I wouldn't be all that surprised.  Then again, he might have his hands full with SpaceX at that point. If they can make this whole reusability thing work, prices could come down significantly, and they're probably going to increase overall demand for launches. He's been able to scrape by being CEO there half-time so far, but if they start doing 40 - 50 launches per year that might change."

Airplanes have redundant systems in case something fails. If an airplane were to lose its engines, it could still glide safely to the ground. Without a rudder, the airplane will crash if it loses gimbaled engines."

elonmusk,3d8bj0,DancingDirty7,2,Wed Jul 15 04:54:21 2015 UTC,"Yes. Just like flying a plane with the landing wheels retracted is also more dangerous. But like retracted the landing wheels, there are some major advantages to removing the tail and rudder."
elonmusk,3d8bj0,Quality_Bullshit,3,Wed Jul 15 08:05:01 2015 UTC,"Retractable gear offers a huge advantage vs a very low increased risk, as you can still do an emergency landing without the landing gear.

elonmusk,3d8bj0,eldrich75,2,Wed Jul 15 10:56:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, it would definitely be more dangerous. Just like self-driving cars would be if it is put on the road today. Therefore, the reliability and safety have to be on many factors better than a plane with rudders.  A hunch tells me that the VTOL plane body might just be a large wing for lift at high altitude. It would use electric jet engines (redundant like Falcon 9) to lift off like a rocket, no wings or rudder needed. The faster it reaches thin air high up, the faster it can reach the most efficient operating mode. It works better than a normal jet plane due to air composition of 70%+ nitrogen."

The point is that people around the world often use the same symbols. Symbols have no inherent meaning, meaning must be given to them. Different people often give different meanings to the same symbol. This is a very common occurrence, as the same words can appear in multiple languages because of a common etymology or because of acculturation. Some people outside of the US do consider themselves American. Therefore, there is more than 1 meaning to the word, and no one can deny the existence of the others. However, when a word with different meanings in different countries is used in a place with international access, confusion may arise and context may be required.  An analogy would be the letters of the Modern English alphabet. The Modern English alphabet is strongly influenced by Latin. Other languages, such as Spanish, Italian, and French, share similar origins. Even though much of the alphabet is identical, they are often pronounced and used differently. A Spanish speaker cannot tell a French speaker that he or she is incorrectly using the parts of the alphabet that they share, but only to continue living the way as he or she knows how, and also to learn and recognize that things can be different elsewhere."

elonmusk,3c4ssm,DanAtkinson,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:59:36 2015 UTC,The entire source text is in the video description box! Enjoy!
elonmusk,3c4ssm,DancingDirty7,2,Tue Jul 7 03:41:18 2015 UTC,I think that it would be great if the tube and capsule will be big enough to carry trucks. That would be the cheapest way to transfer a load from one place to another because it would just be loaded and unloaded only once! or at least big enough to carry a container!
elonmusk,3bvof5,finanzas1,11,Thu Jul 2 15:08:47 2015 UTC,"In Vance's biography of Elon, it is mentioned that Elon vowed his kids will never meet their grandfather.  Seems Elon and his spouses think Errol is a pretty horrible person."

They remain tight-lipped about specifics but it is clear that he was psychologically abusive to them when they were growing up.  It was also mentioned in the book that he's a lier and not to believe a word he says."
elonmusk,3bvof5,bittered,2,Thu Jul 2 23:59:52 2015 UTC,Elon doesn't like his dad?
elonmusk,3bvof5,aguywithagoat,10,Fri Jul 3 07:00:08 2015 UTC,"His daughter, Tasko, is a film producer.   Tosca Musk is her name."
elonmusk,3bvof5,secondlamp,8,Thu Jul 2 16:23:04 2015 UTC,They also misspelled Kimbal halfway through the article. Sloppy journalism.
