Windows  C:\%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default  Linux  ~/.config/google-chrome/Default  Edit: It's apparently possible if you open up the History file (an SQL Database - in Linux I just used sqlitebrowser) and run something like:   DELETE FROM urls WHERE last_visit_time < 13081600000000000   That would delete everything in that specific table (urls) before yesterday. There are also tables for Downloads, Searches, etc...  Sadly I know nothing about working with SQL or why the dates strings are so odd (current time is 13081705269868885) so I couldn't go further - but hey, looks like it's possible!

If your chrome is at anything less than version 43, then you have an old version on your system. If you don't have any notifications to update then you probably have malware on your computer which is holding back your version of chrome so it can stay installed.  What you should do (pretty much regardless) is uninstall chrome fully. Then go in and delete your chrome user data folder (you will have to search how to do this on mac as i don't know it off the top of my head). As long as you have your info synced to google, you won't lose any passwords, bookmarks, etc...)  After all of that you should be able to reinstall chrome and hopefully that error will be gone.

I had to delete my browser user profile and I believe that fixed the problem. NOTE: Make sure you backup your current profile before deleting it.  If you log into chrome with a google profile, backing up the profile is less necessary since everything is synced to google servers. But, its always best to be safe than sorry.  In the end, I didn't lose much. I only lost data that some extensions used. For example, I use Session Buddy to save open sessions of tabs. After deleting my profile, all my Session Buddy data was gone. But, since I had a backup of my profile, I found the data and restored it.

I just don't understand why this just recently began to happen. I'll continue to try more things, I don't know if freeing up hard drive space would do anything? I did replace adblock with ublock origin though, and that is a much better ad block extension. I also got the other extension, though I'm not completely sure if it did anything in terms of scroll speeds.  EDIT: I disabled every single one of my extensions, it fixed all of my issues and increased overall speed in chrome dramatically, I'm going to enable them one by one and see what happens."

From here you can see if a specific webpage or extension is responsible for your increased CPU usage; you can then remove/disable the extension or close the tab responsible.  If it is a lot of pages at once then you may simply be loading too many pages at once for your computer to keep up. If they are all from the same site that particular site may be CPU hungry.

Sure, I can play a song on YouTube in a background tab, and with autoplay on, I can accomplish a similar thing to Streamus (I used it briefly when it was brand new), but then I'm complying with YouTube's terms.

It's not exactly a feature but as a Firefox main (web development, sorry Chrome but I prefer Firefox's tools :P) the completely smoothness is something I really appreciate.  The indication of which tabs are creating sound is also awesome. The new tab Wunderlist page is definitely a big reason I've constantly thought about Chrome. Chrome sync is also a big thing, and the little Google now bell that shows email notifications is also absurdly useful. I thought it was just feature creep when it was introduced, but it's really useful. Some chrome apps don't have mac/windows desktop programs, and so having chrome apps is also very useful for me.  The three big reasons I haven't ended up switching to Chrome full time are   1) web development tools on Firefox are better for what I do  2) tab groups are a godsend feature for me on Firefox; it lets me separate work from ""read later"" tabs  3) the way having 15+ tabs is handled; instead of everything becoming really small and unreadable, Firefox has a drop-down menu next to the ""new tab"" + that shows which tabs are visible and has the titles of every tab you have open"

chrome,3d3m79,horrornerd,2,Tue Jul 14 01:27:48 2015 UTC,"From here:   The magic of Junctions! Wewt!  The following solution can be a bit mucky, but is should, indeed, work.  I'll explain the gist of it: What you're basically gonna do is use a ""junction"". A junction is a symbolic file link, meaning, you're gonna make something that looks like a folder on the C drive where Chrome normally should be installed, but it really points to an entirely different location -- in this case, your D drive.  Go to the Microsoft website ""SysInternals"", and download the ""Junction"" file on this page: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx. Junction is a command-line program used to make ""junctions"" in Windows. I'll show you how to use it.  After the .zip file is downloaded, extract ""junction.exe"" in to system32 (C:\Windows\System32). Do it! Don't let the word ""system32"" scare you :]  Once that is done, open up a console window by pressing the Windows Key + R, and then typing in ""cmd.exe"".  You should now see a black terminal awaiting your input. I will give you example of how to use it. I will map Chrome's installation/data directory to a location in the D drive. But first, an example of its usage:   junction.exe <name_of_file_or_folder> <the_location_you_want_to_point_to   I would type this in to the console, with quotation marks included. Also, keep in mind this is for my operating system, and username. Substitute yours as needed :  junction.exe ""C:\Users\Bapa\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome"" ""D:\Data\temp\chrome""  This will effectively map the Chrome home directory to another location. Chrome will continue to function normally, but it won't know it's really on another drive.  Hell, you can even do this without uninstalling Chrome. Just close Chrome, and cut and paste the ""Chrome"" directory I mentioned anywhere you want on the D drive. Then use the Junction program to make a junction labeled ""Chrome"" that maps to where you just cut/pasted the Chrome directory."

What you are seeing is the visual display for “secure, but with minor errors” which is a lock with a yellow triangle, and is used to highlight other deprecated and insecure practices, such as passive mixed content.   Reddit's certificate uses SHA1 and expires in 2016 so Chrome shows the yellow icon. This does not cause any errors and is a notification. Clicking the yellow icon you can find out more information explaining this. For example, it probably says    The site is using outdated security settings that may prevent future versions of Chrome from being able to safely access it.

chrome,3cg64p,Cosmosance,2,Wed Jul 8 11:50:42 2015 UTC,"TL;DR Don't buy this. Go to a local store and try some out. Note the specs and ask questions. Major issues I saw were with printing (oh God the printing is my nightmare), lower cost also means lower quality core internals. Like all systems look at the hardware.  In itself Chrome OS isn't bad and is constantly improving. I recommend users to go down to their electronics store and play around with some for a while. Does viewing a picture album on one page cause it to crash, move to the next one. Have him sit down with one and get his opinion. While people may be afraid of something new, let him decide how it feels for him. Chrome OS, Windows and OSX all have their good and bad but for Chrome OS right now I feel the companies are pushing them out so fast and at such low prices because not everyone is paying attention to inferior hardware crammed into the machine, call it a Chromebook and roll video of all the cool Chrome OS features.  While this a Chrome I use models with Chrome OS daily as well as XP, Windows 7, Window8, iOS, Android and on and on. Chrome OS is charging ahead but still very much in it's infancy in some areas while pioneering others.   I would not get the advertised item in the sale. The reviews for this item and specs initially shown are for the Dell Chromebox i3 which has the lowest Intels 4th generation processor and double the memory at 4GB of the model you are looking at. The version in the sale is for the Chromebox with a Centrino processor and only 2GB ram. Low Hard drive space, means the computer will constantly be taking actions to retrieve, modify, delete file systems. A few Chromebooks I've seen for prices like these were flat out unusable do to their abysmal speed.  Chrome OS has taken the lock the door approach to apps and extensions causing trouble. But you must remember, these same apps you can get on your Chrome Browser, he can to either by accident or just wanted to play around with a game.   This model appears to be geared more towards enterprise users rather than home. It does not come with a mouse or keyboard or monitor and would require the purchase of an adapter for VGA support. A simple USB mouse and keyboard will work but there goes the USB ports. I assume you want simplicity and wireless devices make things more complicated if your computer knowledge is not great.  Printing will make everyone happy  Google says it flat out in a bright yellow notification box on their support page, ""https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1069693?rd=1 ""Don't try to plug your printer into your Chromebook--it won't work!"" Their main solution is to use another computer and share the printer connected to it. The amount of things that can go wrong in this level of complexity is certainly not something the average user would troubleshoot easily.  Consider your Grampa's tech skills and weigh them against the complexity of jury rigging this up someone and know it will never work correctly in the long run.  I've setup printers printers from many different manufactures and getting it setup and working properly is an involved process and users with little computer knowledge run into multiple problems, many understandably not their fault. USB printing is not supported in Chrome OS and you must use Google Cloud Print. Look at the model of your Samsung printer and picture how you are going to set it up. Start here with this quick note from Samsung on Chrome OS printing.   Tried and trust CHROME OS print solutions  None were straightforward and all were time consuming  ex: -  Google Cloud Print Service on a Windows Print Server Classic printer shared via USB into Macbook Pro, share over local network to Windows XP/Windows 7 desktops and laptop.  ex: - Network HP printer through a Apple AirPort Extreme running a switch the router supplied by the cable company and adding Bonjour service to Windows machines. Purchase Google Cloud Print ready printer. That is, printer that out of the box, just connect it to your wireless network and Google Cloud Print will pick it up. Purchase a Brother printer which had cloud support for Google Cloud Print and AirPrint for Apple devices. Not to tricky connected to wireless network, showed user the simple way to print and am happy. An hour later it's not working. The Cloud printer is not showing up. The printer has lost it's wireless connection to the router, literally 3 feet away from it and 5 feat away from the Chromebook.   Manually punching in the wifi password and getting the printer online again, a test print is fine but the wireless continued to lose connection, requiring re-entering wifi security key and setup. It appears the printer only functioned well with a direct line of site 2 inches away from the Chromebook.  (Google Cloud supported printers are sort of onboard. They need to integrate their cloud printing service for anyone to even begin to understand how to configure this.) Theres many Cloud Print enabled printers though right. They advertise them on their site. But there are some quirks. Soon you will learn of HP ePrint, which frustrates users since you have to send the job to HP ePrint, open it and attempt to print. Luckily there are other brands. Kodak lengthy process brings us another new tool, The Kodak Cloud Printing Software Connector. Figure out how to get that set up, why you had to create more email addresses and that these will be used to send print jobs. HP requires you to use their ePrint App. Which means any print request must come from that app. A new app added more complexity to an increasingly frustrating day.  As for alternatives. If you are stuck on Chrome OS look for models with higher specs. Doesn't need to be expensive or to great but the best way to know is take your Grandfather into a store and see how he likes it."

It has an advanced feature that dynamically finds and blocks elements that are being loaded on your browser. You can pick which scripts you want to allow or block.  uBlock's lists are being maintained by popular and large companies specialised in ad and tracker blocking. uBlock team does not maintain any lists.  uBlock lets you ad more HOST files to block ads.  uBlock allows you to manually create rules.  uBlock allows you to manually white-list ads on specific sites, if you want to support the site.  uBlock should be better on memory than AdGuard.  I'm not 100% sure how AdGuard's malware protection works, but I think it sends every single visited site URL to their servers to check for malware. This is a huge privacy issue.  AdGuard is freemium. uBlock is free."

The look is very good, good iconography, good changes to the dev console, but the entire UI chrome is poorly done overall. Also, the refresh button is counter-clockwise which is poor as well. That icon is something that says ""undo"", not ""refresh""."
chrome,3c8e6b,MaxGhost,11,Mon Jul 6 01:15:41 2015 UTC,"Agree! The resources mostly aren't bad, but whitespace that's nearly double the thickness of the address bar bordering it is not a good design choice in any regard.

In some cases you can see single digit cpu usage compared to chrome on an i7 which takes 25-35% cpu usage at higher clock speeds. I don't get what google is doing these days. Its all a mess it seems. Android  is the only thing they look to be focusing on, while the rest of their products decay. Look at hangouts, its horrible. Why do I need to run it as a browser process in chrome?!

It's not been released but from this reddit post, uBlock Origin will be able to turn this off. Slightly related: both extensions are good as the only way before was editing the Preferences file. The more recent versions of Chrome minify said JSON file, making it much harder to do so. (I ended up butchering the Jansson library to make it spit out a ""pretty"" JSON file with exactly the same contents as what went in - Chrome also removed the way of setting a workaround to allow all sites to go into fullscreen mode without the accept/deny prompt so editing the Preferences file directly is, AFAIK, the only way to still do it.)"
chrome,3brlin,Klathmon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:44:44 2015 UTC,"Please just know that if you use this ""fix"" understand that it will break a good chunk of WebRTC functionality.

chrome,3brlin,rentamob,2,Wed Jul 1 18:28:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know about it breaking that much.  All it should really affect are things like local VOIP.  And we have to understand that the Firefox solution is to just disable WebRTC entirely. At least the Chromium solution doesn't do that.  It's a matter of privacy, not functionality. VPN users make up a very small percentage of Internet users, and privacy-concerned VPN users are an even smaller percentage of that. To most people, this is meaningless."

chrome,3bih0z,Thonatron,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:13:33 2015 UTC,"That's odd. Considering you've a Satellite with an i7, I'm figuring you have at the very least 4gb of RAM- which means you shouldn't have the good old ""running out of ram"" issue if you are just running Chrome. Have you tried to disable those extensions, particularly turn off the lights, to see if that improves performance? I'm also gonna assume you've got any intensive processes in the background disabled."

I swear to god, they break the ""disable high-DPI scaling"" every fifth Chrome update and every time they break it you need a different method to make Chrome not look blurry as shit. I never have UI blur issues in Firefox. Why does Google always have to screw with this and make Chrome blurry on my Surface Pro?"
chrome,3bkri3,CarlFriedrichGauss,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"So I never really had the blurriness, just that it wouldn't set scaling to 125%. I managed to get it back to 125% so things are reasonably sized with the help of the last reply here: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=410696  Apparently it is intentional because they don't support 125% properly, and indeed some UI elements appear weirdly/too large in this mode such as the menus of the tray applet, and it won't scale automatically across different monitors that have different DPIs like Firefox will. Basically take the command line piece in the last reply and append it to the shortcut target. Honestly though, it's so uncomfortable that I'm just going to stick with Firefox until it gets fixed - I enjoy having tabs that don't scrunch into tiny unreadable icons and having workspaces anyway..."

chrome,3bfre7,ne02k,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:52:02 2015 UTC,Some things are possible. Although I believe navigator.plugins is read-only and can't be changed. I'm not sure if anything can be done for different events or not.  If you want to change how certain object methods work you can change their prototype. Changing a function on an instance of an object (like the body element) changes it only for body. Changing it on Element.prototype will change it for all elements.  You can change a function you wish to disable to have an empty function body or return a default value.  However you should be very careful doing this and I would think very carefully about including it in an extension if it might cause side effects for other users because it's very hard to diagnose.

chrome,3b9zl6,abqnm666,4,Sat Jun 27 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"Web traffic is forwarded to your computer. (Unless it's blocked in the router from having internet access entirely, but then you wouldn't really have a whole lot of need for Chrome.)   First, as I'll explain below and with no offense to your father, the firewall won't help you with a malicious RAT unless it completely blocks your PC's internet access. (But then you wouldn't really have much need for Chrome, so I don't believe that your PC has no internet access.)  Now, none of this is to say a malicious RAT is definitely what is going on, but it's certainly possible. Though I'm not convinced. If the only thing that you saw was Chrome being minimized and you didn't see any new tabs or other apps opened or see the mouse moving or anything, then this doesn't sound like a RAT.   If a malicious RAT is running as a service or background program, then it would be doing whatever it's doing silently in the background and you'd never seen anything. This is normally how malicious RATs operate. And if it was a RAT that gave the remote connection full control of the screen, then you would have seen more than just Chrome being minimized, as you will see everything that they are doing. And there aren't many reasons why a RAT would minimize Chrome but do nothing else. Usually a malicious RAT isn't going to be using screen sharing because you can see it and also it seems pretty unlikely that someone went through the time to deploy a malicious RAT just to screw with people by minimizing their browser windows.   Now, here is why the firewall is irrelevant when it comes to a RAT (malicious or not).   When a request is initiated from your computer to another server while browsing the web sites, the server sends the page back to your IP and your router forwards it to your PC. And a RAT just has to establish a connection with another server, so it can use port 80 (http) or 443 (https) without the router's interference since these ports are opened and forwarded automatically as needed to enable web browsing. They don't need a dedicated port, but if the router has UPnP enabled, the RAT can simply pick nearly any port and the router will automatically forward it to your computer.   The firewall is meant to block network entry from outside, but because a RAT connection is initiated by the client software from inside the network, the router/firewall won't be blocking anything sent from a RAT."

(There are legit free examples such as TeamViewer.) Some people use trojans to insert some RATs to your computer thru a backdoor or something. And they can control your mouse and keyboard, watch thru your camera and all that crazy stuff you probably don't want to  happen."
chrome,3b9zl6,Admicos,2,Sat Jun 27 05:24:12 2015 UTC,"Remote administration tool:       A remote administration tool (RAT) is a piece of software that allows a remote ""operator"" to control a system as if he has physical access to that system. While desktop sharing and remote administration have many legal uses, ""RAT"" software is usually associated with criminal or malicious activity. Malicious RAT software is typically installed without the victim's knowledge, often as payload of a Trojan horse, and will try to hide its operation from the victim and from security software.  The operator controls the RAT through a network connection. Such tools provide an operator the following capabilities:    Screen/camera capture or image control  File management (download/upload/execute/etc.)  Shell control (from command prompt)  Computer control (power off/on/log off if remote feature is supported) Registry management (query/add/delete/modify)  Hardware Destroyer (overclocker)  Other software product-specific functions   Its primary function is for one computer operator to gain access to remote PCs. One computer will run the ""client"" software application, while the other computer(s) operate as the ""host(s)"".

I recommend signing in or syncing before you do uninstall, though, because then all of your apps and extensions are immediately restored by signing in.  Developer mode shouldn't be causing you to have the dev version, though. That just means you somehow installed from the dev channel instead of the stable channel. Reinstalling should be able to get you back onto the stable channel. My best guess is that the dev channel has something causing extensions to crash."

chrome,3b2y2m,Neolife,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:48:50 2015 UTC,"Is that only possible through the dev channel releases or by having ""Developer Mode"" enabled?  Edit: This suggests that extensions not on the store can be installed on any channel as long as you have ""Developer Mode"" enabled.  The dev channel can essentially be thought of as an alpha release of chrome. It isn't nightly (that's Canary), but it's more frequent releases than the beta channel."
chrome,3b2y2m,iamtheben,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:00:15 2015 UTC,No. You can still load unpacked extensions in developer mode on Windows and Mac.   You can only load unpacked extensions with that method. While it's possible to unpack Chrome extensions it's easier to run the Dev channel and not bother.
chrome,3b2y2m,Neolife,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"Oh. I wasn't aware of that. I know at some point you could drag-and-drop .crx files into the extensions tab to install them. I'm assuming that was disabled at some point unless you're running the dev channel?  Edit: I just did a drag-and-drop install of TamperMonkey on Chrome Stable without even enabling Developer Mode. I got the CRX file from a separate website, and Chrome even warned me when I downloaded the file that it couldn't install from there. But it can install from the extensions page."
chrome,3b2y2m,iamtheben,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:44:28 2015 UTC,Tampermonkey is in the Chrome Webstore and even through you downloaded that file from somewhere else I think you'll find that that extension is still a signed Chrome Webstore extension. The filename gives it away.  If you try with an extension that's not signed or in the Webstore then I think you'll find it wont work.
