Trucking,3e3j9w,TCBloo,9,Tue Jul 21 18:02:20 2015 UTC,"So what made this backing have to be a blind side? Approaching this backing from driver side seem superior given the pictures you presented.  Coming in blind side from the right you have several close obstructions to mind including that air conditioner unit. You also have an irregular curb, compounding with loss of tandem sight coverage due to that wall on your blind side mirror.  Unless I'm missing something in your pictures, you could just have easily tightened up your bridge, then made a set up for a driver side 90."

One of the first things I do when I get a new trailer is slide the tandems forward. I only pass a scale house like once a week.   Edit: I remember that at one store, I had to slide the tandems all the way forward to get around a corner, then all the way back to get rid of the trailer swing so I could 90 it into a corner.

I'm currently parked in a dark truck stop, with about a foot and half gap either side the whole length of the the truck, if I open my door wide I'd smack the guys mirror next to me, and the open space in front to swing the ass end around is just big enough so you get close enough to see the whites of the eyes in the guys parked in the opposite spots as you swing the cab around.

Could you fashion some sort of conveyor or chute where you can just dump a bunch of air filters down it by hand and they land in a pile inside?   Also, even if you had a forklift, how would you get to the pallets behind the first two at the doors of the trailer?   They do make some pallet grabber claws that you hook to a chain to drag pallets from farther back in the trailer to the edge, maybe that would help?"

Trucking,3dzv2e,Bonus77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:08 2015 UTC,"It all started with a vibration in transmission. While they had it they decided to replace the clutch and noticed an oil leak, so with it under warranty they rebuilt the motor (470k miles)... I get it back for 2 days, after 4 months of being in the shop. It constantly lost fuel prime, making it a bitch to start if shut off for more than 30 min at a time, not to mention original problem (vibration in transmission) was still happening, their words ""Just drive it and see what happens."" The 2nd day I have it I notice it's using oil, turns out they screwed up the engine rebuild, so they they sent it to another shop to get rebuilt a 2nd time, and they supposedly addressed the transmission issue. So after a total of 6 months (minus the 2 days I drove it) I get it back and then break down with the lines going to the air tanks plugged up, not to mention their is still a noise in the transmission/clutch every now and then. Part of what took so long was that they had 3 different shops work on it. The Penske in Effingham, IL is basically a service station, they can't do any serious repairs so they have to send it out to other shops. But the 3 shops argued over who screwed what up and who was going to pay for it, causing about a month of delay for me getting it back."

Trucking,3dzln1,scm44,2,Tue Jul 21 03:41:35 2015 UTC,"In some areas natural gas is less expensive for fleet vehicles. For example, in Argentina CNG is available at most stations, and many of the taxis use it, as it is cheaper.  Is it less dense than diesel? Yes, but that's not a big deal for many applications.  I think OTR trucks will be the LAST fleet application of alternative (non biodiesel) energy, simply because of the required infrastructure build out. Look for the tech to go to local fleets first, like the UPS vans that already use it, then maybe LTLs. Really, if the government wants to encourage trucks to use alternative fuels, all they need to do is bump up the weight limit. If CA were to allow vehicles without diesel/gasoline/biodiesel/ethanol engines to haul, say, 90k lbs, the tech would take off quickly, at least in CA."

I think it was an 80 or 82 model, something like that, a long ass delivery van. There was a couple of problems with this alternative fuel and it still persist today. One was we had to drive 25 miles one-way to another town to buy propane and they only open 8 to 5 weekdays. Second, at first it was fairly priced but then they kept jacking the price up! It took more than gasoline and the tank was huge!!!  Beware fuels like natural gas etc because once they get everybody hooked, they might screw you and you wind up paying more than you would for diesel or gasoline.  After that experience and the gas company screwing us at home out of gallons of fuel and jacking up the price, I'm don't want no part of this alternative fuel stuff. It's a gamble and I'm no gambler.  BTU's per gallon, diesel is the clear winner here.  Even an electric car, charging is not free, my light bill is already through the roof at home, and the price of the EV is outrageous (note I never bought but one brand new car in my life and that was a Mustang 5.0). so for this stuff to trickle down to poor working people (the majority) I be long dead. No telling what a new battery cost or what it cost to work on it after it runs out of warranty. Probably never make it to the used car lots and they send 'em straight to the recycle yard.  We wound up running gasoline in the old Ford Propane van. The elon musk fellow and electric cars and trucks, they made to sell to the rich and famous, or investors spending peoples 401k money and politicians who splurge tax dollars.  Let me ask you a question. How much tax dollars has the government spent on space and nasa and how much money did you get? All I got was some fancy computer wallpaper, and satellite which I can do without - wait, somebody else pays for that, me!  What about an endless supply of nuclear power? My light bill keeps going up, takes 50 years to build and approve a nuke plant, and it only supplies less than 18% of the power we get.

We use propane on our farm for our old tractors and heating and it usually ends up being anywhere from 15-40% cheaper than buying it at a retailer. It's not too hard to come out ahead on small futures contracts if you plan to actually take delivery of the commodity.
Trucking,3dzln1,kellanium,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:59:53 2015 UTC,"Not here it ain't cheaper. Propane and home gas is always about $1 above the national average. I look up price on internet and it said $2.35. Call propane company, it $3.20! Add that to the fact he cheats you out of about 10 to 20 gallons every time, then claim the gauge is a little off. Then the gas company goes around repoing tanks that people bought and paid for long ago, they own it but company claim it theirs. Old man finally found the receipt and boy that bastard blew-up and threaten to take it to a higher court, but he never did.

From minute one it felt like a slave mill. The guy running the orientation was one of the most pompous, hot air ego maniacs I have ever seen. Condescending everytime he answered a question, ordered drivers around as opposed to being polite and asking / informing. The people outside the orientation in the surrounding offices all looked like doe eyed kids, likely being paid 8$ / hr to play office dress up, ask them a question on anything and you could see the wires upstairs short circuiting. Add on top of all that the 29 cents a mile start and the notorious reputation of fucking over drivers I was dumb to expect anything different. Day two I come in at 08:02 to orientation because of a train blocking the entrance to the industrial road their yard is off. Orientation guy stops me while I am walking to my seat ""you'll have to leave and contact your recruiter to reschedule another week""...  that was enough for me to say bye completely.   Two weeks later I am in Indianapolis at Schneider orientation, and believe me when I say it was a world of difference.  Nice terminal, smiling faces, everyone friendly and helpful. The guys running the orientation were laid back ex drivers quick to spark up convo and jokes all while remaining super professional.  When they told us info they were strait forward about it, no lies or deception.  Add to that the better pay and them having all new cascadia's in there fleet (i see hardly any of the old remaining century class tractors they had anymore), its no contest.  I got my year with Schneider, even dinged a few things at shippers and once had to call off while under a load and they left nothing on my record besides my employment dates and ""Ok for rehire"".

Trucking,3dxxur,t3traktys,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:13 2015 UTC,I'll have my CDL by this weekend and be headed out to Houston next week to begin company training as a bulk driver for Schneider. They have yet to give us many details about what the training will consist of. Can you give me a brief summary of what I can expect please? What does the training consist of? How long was your training period? How did you get along with your trainer? What regions of the country have you frequented while driving bulk? Thanks.
Trucking,3dxxur,00stephen,3,Tue Jul 21 03:05:08 2015 UTC,"Your training will likely be three weeks, and get paid roughly $400/wk.  The first week is parking and road skills at an Operating Center with a bit of class time on log books and such.  The second week you'll team over-the-road with another, more experienced driver, who will let you exercise all of those things you've learned the first week.  The third week you'll be back at the Operating Center taking a few more classes, computer based training, simulator time (skid control, blowouts, accident avoidance), and a driver's test and assessment.  Then they send you on your merry way.  You may -- I'm not positive on this -- not get the full advertised ""up to*"" cpm rate for the first three or six months.  I've heard (but not personally experienced) that new drivers get paid a reduced rate during that time frame.  You do, however, get a sign on bonus and tuition reimbursement dispensed throughout that time frame."
Trucking,3dxxur,rocknrollskwurl,2,Tue Jul 21 06:09:45 2015 UTC,"Youll be in Houston ~ two weeks doing paperwork,  learning how to do air/pump unloads, driving around with instructors, and doing some classroom Learning . After that you go off with a trainer for aout two weeks,  give or take a few days. As far as where youll run - alot of it will be within the triangle of Houston,  Chicago,  and New Jersey but every now and then you get lucky - I just ran from Texas to Wyoming, then from Utah to New Mexico and back to Chicago."

As far as the atenna is the mount inside the mirror itself?  If so is there only 1 atenna on your truck? Both mirrors on that style of setup have atenna mounts and if you plug 1 atenna into the wrong port your running without an atenna to your radio, and if that's the case you can mess up.your radio."

The left side has the antenna mounted to it, and the passenger side has a satellite ratio antenna that the last guy put in. My company installs CB's in all the trucks, so I don't think they messed up the wiring. They told me there's no splitter, just one straight wire from the antenna to the radio.

Trucking,3dye50,eog_prod,2,Mon Jul 20 16:14:57 2015 UTC,"The truck's factory antenna setup is full retard anyways. They used to actually take the time to set the SWR on every truck before it left the factory. Now they just slap a box in there that dummy-loads the standing waves, and also tunes the cb antennas for am/fm use as well. Those boxes fail and don't work very well anyways. The best way to ensure you are getting out is to mount your own antenna and coax and tune it properly."
Trucking,3dye50,Zarknox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:14:28 2015 UTC,"Its been a while since I've messed with anything like this, but when first look up for sure what means the antenna needs to be shorter/longer. Like the readings and how they relate to length of antenna. Second make sure you put the antenna on correctly. I had like the washer on the wrong side of the mount and that was why mine wouldn't work.  Thats all I can say, good luck!"
Trucking,3dye50,cso,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:19:33 2015 UTC,"If SWR is higher on 1 than 40, start by checking cable and grounding connections."

Trucking,3dye50,voucher420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:33:26 2015 UTC,Sometimes it's worth the few dollars it takes for a good cb shop to tune your antennas.
Trucking,3dye50,northern_crusader,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"It needs tuning. Usually there's a grub screw where the whip goes into the base. Undo that, lengthen the antenna a bit, 1/2"", retest.  Also if your grounding is shit you can have the best antenna in the world and not get 100 yards down the road. Mirror arms are a really really shitty place to mount them.   www.k0bg.com is where you need to go. Its aimed at amateurs but radio is radio and what is on there works for CB. You need to concentrate on the pages on mounting, bonding and grounding."

Sounds like a lack of pre trip error, brakes auto adjust now training should have taught the driver how to do that, and driver should have been doing that. If they're not auto adjusting there's a part of the brakes that are broken and that's something every driver should be keeping track of."

Note there are also tax disadvantages to financing the truck over >3 years.   Granted after the 36 or 60 months you will own the truck, after the lease you will have a balloon payment if you want to buy it, but the final cost will typically not be grossly higher.  Again, I am not advocating for this plan, I am merely pointing out that your arguments are baseless and ill-informed.  Edit 2: Oh, and with the lease-purchase you can walk away at any time. Try to go back to the dealer you bought the truck from and tell them you want out of the deal after a year or so, lets see how well that goes over..."

So many things can cause a tire blowout, but constant ones should be easy to track down.

They may look ok but they could be old tires. There is a date stamped on every tire. Look up how to find the date on the particular brand your using.

Truth is trucking and everything else sucks these days, unless you have the money to run your own company and buy a nice custom rig, haul only what you want and when you want, it's no better than driving a trash truck for the city and handing the wife your paycheck every Friday. I've been in and out of trucking over the years. Started out driving and for the first 5 years the wife and I were on foodstamps. Yeap, it was that bad.  The worse part of trucking is the bullshit regulations and government control. Everywhere you go there's some sort of truck cop trying to take your money because they think truckers have a lot of dough. If people only knew the truth.

It looks like either angular steel, but if you look at the flex in the skateboard I'm thinking it's actually aluminum.   No headache rack, no front bulkhead. The bulkhead would have probably prevented this entirely as it would have prevented all forward movement, assuming the load was butted it up to it.  It's hard to tell with the rotators arm out but the first picture leads me to believe this was probably inadequate securement.  Edit. I think they're resin. The third picture is really telling, it just looks extruded."

Trucking,3dt28m,KingOfSpeedSR71,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:26:42 2015 UTC,"A headache rack will not stop a load that's already moving. A bulkhead at the front of the load with the load butted up against it would likely have kept this from happening, but not a sure fire way. And by the looks of it, may not have had the space on the trailer to make a bulkhead.  As an experiment,  get a straw and a potato. DO NOT PLACE YOUR HAND BEHIND THE POTATO. Hold the potato with your fingers. Take the straw and ram it into the potato.  That fucker will run straight through. Now, place the straw against the potato. Try pushing it through. You'll break the straw before you get it to run through like the first time.  So unless the bulkhead and load are touching,  it isn't going to do much in situations like this. Headache racks are only good for storing equipment.   Edit: About the only good way to secure angle/flat/channel like this is to block between the bundles and belly wrap or wrap each bundle with chain at least once while wrapping two bundles per chain. Wrapping the chain around the bundles will force the chain to roll if the bundles begin to move. A rolling chain will tighten and stop forward motion."

I was ready to just leave but I've felt like this once or twice before during my 12 days in training. I've always stuck it out and it's always been better after. I guess this is just one of those times!
Trucking,3dsd84,vanishing_point,7,Sun Jul 19 16:27:32 2015 UTC,"Agreeing with what rocknrollskwurl said, the nervousness is normal and fine to have.  I don't have massive amounts of experience (6 months oil field water truck) but the nervousness subsides a lot after you get a better feel for things. But you should always stay on your toes. Some of the guys I work with have been driving 20+ years and still get nervous on some of the roads we run.  If you let that nervousness get the best of you and it affects your driving, maybe flatbed or trucking in general isn't for you. Which is nothing to be ashamed of, its a tough industry that requires nerves of steel and long times away from home; its not for everyone. I myself never want to do OTR.  See how you feel in a month or so. Unless you honestly feel you are danger to yourself or others, stick with it for a little longer."
Trucking,3dsd84,TechnoEquinox,2,Sun Jul 19 00:42:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm still in my training portion and was going to stick it out and see if I felt any more confident at the end.  I just want to avoid being in a position where I feel my safety or anyone elses safety is in jeopardy.   Honestly I feel alright right now but I'm still not 100% on my skills and that's a given but I don't know if I'll be ready by the time training is up.   I'd rather be safe than sorry and if it turns out that I still don't feel comfortable, I'll probably get out of OTR trucking. At least I got to experience it. I never even wanted to do flatbed but it was the only option with the company I chose to go with.  Thanks for your reply"
Trucking,3dsd84,marshull,5,Sun Jul 19 00:52:22 2015 UTC,"If you are still not feeling confident toward the end of your training, talk to your trainer or safety guy or whoever about it.

Dont be afraid to ask questions if you are unsure of something."
Trucking,3dsd84,TechnoEquinox,6,Sun Jul 19 01:07:40 2015 UTC,Secure the load so that you'd be fine having your wife/kids/mom/etc on the same road with the load. Underestimate your abilities until you are damn sure what your abilities are. See that orange 45mph ramp speed sign? Try 40 or lower. Holding up traffic being cautious? Fuck em. They'll forget that a lot sooner than they will a flatbed laid out on its side with the load spread all over the road. Err on the side of caution and you should be fine. And learn from everything. Take nothing for granted.

No scales in the fields so the loads so far have been 82k-88k pulling double hoppers, weirdly it's more nerve wracking pulling the empties.

I've only been driving for a couple hears, and have eagerly been waiting for the day I get the naked girl... or at least a shot.  Greenville north Carolina. Medium traffic and this little suv pulls next to me and it's some older guy looking at my truck. He's smiling and looking at my door where there's a cheeky little smart assed graphic there... I wave. And then I stop waving and let off the gas. This guy loses speed with me.  Cause he's got his pants open and is clearly pulling one off while looking up at a shaggywolf of a truck driver.  I got eye raped in north Carolina. Best I could do was keep going, eyes forward, cautious mirror glances until he got off the highway fifteen minutes later.

Kicked on flashers, started slowing down to pull over. Approx 50 mph, crossed the rumble strip and woke the mentor. He pokes his head out and says ""What did you do?""

Trucking,3drvga,JimMarch,2,Sat Jul 18 22:38:00 2015 UTC,"Finally my trainer arrived today. This is my first day on the big road in a real truck! A large almost pink Volvo pulled up and it had the biggest sleeper you ever seen. I had been waiting 6 days in a cheap motel after I got my CDL licences from the company boot camp, and I think it had bed bugs, so I'm itching to get on the road as fast as possible.  I crawled up into the jump seat of my new trainer's truck and introduced myself, then I noticed something that seemed sort of queer as in strange. I said to my new trainer - his name is Jim, why does your truck have a rear-view mirror and non of the other trucks with sleepers have one? He said, that's just in case I need to look back into the sleeper birth to make sure you don't fall out if I have to slam on brakes - it's company policy for trainers now. I thought, well that seems sort of strange, but logical. Then I noticed he had Jorts on and he shaved his legs!  so I asked him about that and he said the hair tickles his legs and he didn't want to get distracted going down the interstate highways. I thought, that seems logical - a little queer but logical. Our instructor warned us about distracted driving.  We drove on a few miles and he asked me did I have a girl friend. I'm thinking, well that seems queer too but maybe he's just being overly friend because he's been driving for so long, 3 months experience and all. That's understandable.  I guess everything's going fine fellows like it suppose to, I never did this before. When me and Big Jim pulled out of the training center in Utah, everybody smiled and waved.  You all wish me luck, because Big Jim said if I wreck his truck tomorrow he's gone F*** me up, but he promised to show me how to talk on the CB radio and give me a handle to play with - that's CB radio talk for you beginners out there in Reddit Land. See you on the flip-flop!"

The Garmin was really easy to do a simple point-to-point, but I never figured out if it had the ability to do a multi-stop.  I did appreciate the hell out of its reliability and the interface was pretty clean, although the speed limits needed updating.  Also the mounting bracket on the Cobra is absolute crap.

Trucking,3dqav2,greasyjohn,2,Sat Jul 18 20:41:25 2015 UTC,"I drive a ReadyMix truck; been driving it since February. Started out at $16/hr, since other than a month of training in bottom-dumps, I was hired on with no driving experience.  The job does include medical/dental/vision, and it's overtime after 40 hours a week / 8 hours a day, and double time after 12 hours a day.  How much work you get a week is entirely dependent on the rest of the construction industry and simply how much concrete is ordered. Average week is 40/hr a week; I've done as little as 25/hr in a week and as much as 80 hours. Keep in mind that like the rest of the construction industry, you work 6 day work weeks, unless it's slow or you get higher up (drivers are ranked by seniority).  Frankly, it's not a bad job. The heaviest lifting you have to do are your chutes, and there's very little tedium, as it's always something different. Of course, that can come back and bite you, because every day is something different, and you need to get very good at navigating a very large and very tall (and thus top-heavy) vehicle, in places never designed to accommodate them.  I'm told doing ReadyMix driving in the city is very different, where you have narrow streets and tons of traffic, but I live and work out here in the Mojave desert. There's no traffic, but our trucks have lockers and axle locks (locks two differentials together) for a reason; there is a lot of off-roading to out of the way construction sites, and even in regular construction sites, you're driving around an area that is entirely dirt, usually with a lot of uneven terrain and soft areas."
Trucking,3dqav2,vanishing_point,2,Sat Jul 18 22:50:12 2015 UTC,A fellow mudslinger eh. I like your summary. Mine was a bit long winded.
Trucking,3dqav2,kw900,2,Sun Jul 19 00:36:03 2015 UTC,"Concrete Ready-Mix Driver here. I started driving a mixer about a year ago.  I make 21.50 an hour (32.25 after 8, 43 after 12hrs - 32.25 Saturdays, 43 Sundays). I lucked out, the company I work for is Union (Teamsters) and like many companies, they were hit hard during the recession laid of some drivers and also lost drivers to the oil-field work. I applied just as work was starting to pick up in my area and was the first to be hired on in a few years. This put me pretty high on the list with all drivers hired after, are below me on the list.    ""What's this list?"" The Seniority list of course! Pretty much dictates who gets to work when there's not much work to go around(even the non-union companies run this way or at least the ones I've spoken with). So that guy you talked with getting 65hrs a week might be their #1 driver, while the new guys are lucky to get 25hrs even during peak times. Also, know that it is seasonal, when it starts getting wet out, say goodbye to working till it dries up a bit.   Even if there is a job here and there in the winter, you won't have first choice.. you will be dead last on that list. It's also possible they will straight up Lay you off for the winter with a promise to rehire you in the order in which you were let go (this is my contract but it didn't happen last winter, I managed to work some most weeks). We all pull Part Time hours in the winter at best. Personally I look at this as perk, who wants to drive in the snow, mud, and rain?   ""Mud, did I say mud?"" Yup, mud. You ever want to go off-roading in a big truck? Now's your chance! Nothing like sinking up to your axles, I've experienced this twice, and once almost slid off an embankment! All three times I was able to be pulled out with little to no issues. This is about the only job that I can think that goes down worse roads has to be Logging, but they only haul heavy going down the mountain, we haul heavy going up. I speak from experience here, as my company is situated in a Foothills/Mountains. Truthfully, I sometimes look forward to being rented out to companies in the valley so I can have an easy day driving on flat land.  Rented out? What's this? Yup, you'll sometimes be slaved off to some strange company who landed a big contract but didn't have enough drivers or equipment. Most of time it's fun... most of the time. Working in a new environments isn't really anything new to an ex OTR driver. Just new faces and new personalities to deal with...   ""Deal with? Like in deal with people?"" Yup, you will be in direct contact with the persons whom purchased the product. As a delivery driver, you are now the last face and representative of your company those customers might see, and they will judge you on your appearance, professionalism, courtesy, and your performance on the job site.  ""Wait, performance on the job site? You mean people will be watching me?"" Shit son, once you pull off the highway you are no longer driving in the sense that DOT can mess with you... you are now a Heavy Equipment Operator(basically going on your work line vs drive line). You will be backing into tight spots, on rough ground, 20ft of chute filled with a 1000lbs of mud, and if the person guiding the chute lets go without signalling you to lock the chute, the chute can swing free and kill someone. (I've had some close calls that would have been bad if I wasn't paying attention).  ""Drive line? DOT logs?"" Nope, well maybe sometimes. Being Local driver you are typically not required to run logs unless you operate outside of a 50 mile radius from your plant or work over 14 hours in a day (I believe as local driver you can work 16 hours in a day as long as you don't drive more than 11). My company has 3 plants within 30 miles of each other and we never deliver more than 50 miles, so we don't run logs. However we have Receipts which log our travel time to and from as well as how long you were on the job site, these times can easily be transferred to logbook if necessary.

Trucking,3dp1iz,NotJohnCalvin,3,Sat Jul 18 05:03:13 2015 UTC,That ain't going to happen at a mega carrier. Worst case scenerio at one of them is getting fired and the incident being on your dac.  At a smaller company they might try to pull that shit but you have no obligation to pay for it. They can fire you over the incident but you would be able to collect unemployment with them being able to fight it of course.  The only advantage coming out of paying for the damages is that you get to keep a job that you really want to keep. Probably because your benefits that you've vested heavily in and you're a few years from retiring.  You do make a lot of ill informed comments and you should probably pull your head out of your ass.

Trucking,3dncf2,AAonthebutton,14,Fri Jul 17 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry this is so long, but there are actually 2 laws to consider when trying to answer your question.   I've looked online and can't find a simple explanation without a formula.   That's because the actual law you are looking for is not the ""bridge law"" (even though drivers call it that all the time). A more correct term for it is ""kingpin to rear axle law"". Use that in your search and you will find what you need. But, this should be good enough for you. It shows those laws state by state... http://www.bigtruckguide.com/kingpin-to-rear-axle/  Now... the real ""bridge law"" actually does the opposite of what you are looking for.  Kingpin-to-rear-axle laws differ by state and set a MAXIMUM distance. This is likely to ensure an appropriate turning radius on the roads/corners in their state.  The real bridge law is a federal law and sets a MINIMUM distance that you can have between your axles. This is so your weight is spread out enough that it doesn't all end up between two supports in a bridge and cause the bridge to collapse. This will explain why  So, the truth is that you need to be BETWEEN both of those laws to be legal. Far enough apart to make sure you comply with the bridge law. Close enough together to make sure that you comply with different state's kingpin to rear axle laws.  Having said that... if you are running the usual semi (a tandem slide on your trailer and a tandem drive axle on the tractor) then you need to make sure that there is at least 36 feet between the driver's front drive axle and the trailer's rear axle. Understand that the position of his fifth-wheel and design of his tractor can affect this distance (but only about a foot or so).  this is the shortest the axles can be  Next, think about where the load needs to go and look on this list and decide how short you need to be to comply with every state on that rout. This is the farthest the axles can be  Get your load legal when the trailer axle's are somewhere between those two points, and your driver is golden.  I hope that makes sense. Please ask if I need to explain something better."

Your kids will grow apart from you and your life itself will have two sides.  That being said, if you are aware of this and can make a plan to get out of OTR and into a local gig in a year, do it. But stick to it.   You'll learn to hate anyone you team with over time. I have my phone, a Jetpack and my laptop.

They make you team with a trainer, you find out then what you want to do. ATT weekly direct deposit. pay fluctuates, so don't count on a set amount. Safety - always park where there are other trucks and you won't have these problems. You will certainly feel stuck after 3 months OTR, at 6 months, and I remember the 3rd year one winter was difficult. I quit and went back 3 or 4 times. Only way to get time off! I wouldn't call 3 days off after being out a month, time off. You probably going to crash and not get anything done at home.   New drivers tend to hit parked objects! Learn all the CDL manual stuff before you leave and watch videos on turning left and right if you go to company school. Last and most importantly, joint bank accounts rarely work. Get your own account that only you have access - if you don't, come mid week you won't have enough money to buy a donut. Better have a couple of grand saved up before you leave out. Manage your money and do not draw any advances. You're not going to make good money until you get experience and get another job. Your $600 per week you make now is about the same as $900 on the road after you take out for expenses and miles varies so you may not even average that much for the first year or two.  As for married with younger children, I don't recommend it. You might make it a few yrs, but you will likely give it up and have to start all over again unless you come back and find a local driving job and be home nights, or at least every weekend.

Personally I would say it is probably the most distinctive new truck on the road.  http://allnew5700.com/  This video really shows it off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH_HMhyzmKo  Edit: I suppose I can see some similarity to the Lonestar, but only in that they are both trying to retain some of the look of a classic truck while still being an aero design. That said, the 5700xe is far more elegant. It obviously was taking lots of cues from the Cadillac CTS in it's design."

Trucking,3djsez,GatorNavy,4,Thu Jul 16 21:02:20 2015 UTC,I work for an LTL and our route guys help unload if need be. Most of our customers have docks and forklifts; but sometimes we need to use our pallet jack or even hand unload. We get paid to deliver freight which includes getting off the trailer. Unless there was a handling fee on the bill that guy was a dick for demanding cash. And if his truck was almost dry that was his own damn fault.
Trucking,3djsez,dangerchrisN,3,Thu Jul 16 21:25:32 2015 UTC,"If the load confirmation I sign specifies that the freight is ""no touch"" to the driver and the consignee demands that I unload it, he either can pay me what I ask to unload his freight off of my trailer, or if he refuses to pay  me the broker gets a call from me asking for a new load confirmation to be sent out with more money on it for the extra work I did not contract for and was not agreed to.  If the load confirmation specifies ""driver unload"" or ""tailgate delivery"", the price for that is then negotiated into the rate agreement and the consignee gets me to unload onto his dock.  If a receiver demands that I have to perform work for him for free that I have not contracted for in any way and refuses to unload it himself or pay me to do so, it will all go to the closest warehouse or cold storage facility where they will gladly unload the freight off of my trailer and he can figure out how to get it from there back to his dock.  Only have had to do that a couple of times.  Since all I do now is reefer LTL and I get paid extra to unload, I'll happily do so.  As long as I get paid, I refuse to work for free for anyone."

Trucking,3djuyj,TruckerToolkit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:21:06 2015 UTC,"2%?  Should be at least 10%.  Consider it this way.  You would like to get as close to your maximum allowable weight on your steers, for reasons of weight balance and traction on your steers.  In Canada that is 5500kg, 17000kg on your drives.  For a maximum load setup you try to get both weights to their maximum.  On my tractor, moving the 5th wheel forward an inch can move about 100kg from the drives to the steers.  The perfect balance point is a kingpin position about a foot forward of the center of the drives.  The way I found out where to set the 5th wheel was by getting a heavy load where I could max out my drives (17000kg) and then move the 5th wheel to a position where my steers were also being maxed out (about 5300kg).  After that, I never change my 5th wheel position.  No matter what size of load I have, the weight on the steers will always be good when the weight on the drives is good.

On the current rig that I am using, the steer axle hits its limit at the same time as the drive with the fifth-wheel only about 4 inches forward (of center of drives). Hence only 2% goes to steers.

About 1/2 of our trucks are bunk trucks that are about 1000kg heavier.  Many of the guys complain about the weight of their loads and how hard (impossible) it is to get them legal.  We arrange it so the heavier ones are moved by day cabs leaving the lighter ones for the bunk trucks.

Trucking,3djxmw,kw900,0,Thu Jul 16 22:22:31 2015 UTC,"Insurance companies require recent experience. Depending on policy 3-5 yrs. It's all about providing cheap labor to the big outfits to cut down on cost of shipping and keep prices down - as a bonus the training companies get that school money from the driver, and the schools get that government and veteran money. So, new drivers are forced to work for Swift, Prime, or CRE for lower wages - some have to team for months before they even get assigned a truck. Once they get the required recent experience they usually move on and the next wave of newbie CDL school drivers take their place. it's a fucked up system. Even if you drove before 10-15 yrs, if it's not recent they want to charge you for school / training again, and get as much money out of you as possible. They claim they pay for it but usually nobody stays that long and they take out $70 a 'week' out of your paycheck for 13 months or more. If you don't pay it off, they turn it over to a collections agency.  There is another problem new drivers don't consider. These companies will screw you on your DAC when you leave. Driver thinks oh well I work for these idiots then go find a good job. Well they gone make that as hard for you as they can when you leave. Something happens, bump a trailer door, fender bender, get stuck? they take it right out of your paycheck. You either sign the paper, or you fired - happens again you fired anyway. No lawyer can help you there, and you likely will never get another driving job. What you thought was gone help you get recent experience, turns out to be your demise."

I would go talk to people at the prospective school as well.

Trucking,3devn3,eog_prod,6,Wed Jul 15 18:54:08 2015 UTC,"I have a similar story while working for Knight Transportation in Katy. Was working there for about 18 months trying to get a dedicated gig in hometown from the start, never could get it. So I was on hometime and I decided I was going to quit and called in letting them know. Truck was parked at our local drop yard where we store trucks/trailers. All legit ass covered, well when I called I let them know I was going to quit and offered to drive truck to main terminal in Katy as a nice gesture I was transferred to the lead driver manager.  So while talking he asked why I wanted to quit, I let him know about the local gig which was the original offer, but filled at time of hiring. So while talking and him basically not giving much care I let him know I was just ""sick of waiting around"" meaning sick of being strung along. Now here is where it goes twilight zone, after saying ""sick"" he then says we need you to visit a doctor before we can let you drive our knight truck back to Katy terminal.  What?  After he says if you don't visit a doctor and get checked up and then drive our truck to the Katy terminal I will charge you with abandonment. I replied with im just sick of bs im not sick physically.   Remember my truck was already parked at our company leased drop yard, I was being a nice guy offering to bring truck to main yard. I was freaked out, could not believe this lol. Anyway the reason he did not charge me was I called back and my original driver manager had been promoted to safety manager. Young college kid, anyway he said he was the one who filled out the forms when people quit and he would make sure this was not put on. That was one good thing.  Anyway just thinking about that day still makes my blood boil. This was 10 years ago, they did put would not rehire, but constantly tried recruiting me back for many years wtf. So now I'm still truckin with nearly 2 million accident free miles, 100% on time deliveries, but companies can do the stupidest shit to anyone. Also this is the reason if I quit a trucking company it's immediate and on a terminal with videos/photos of equipment. When I tell this story even I feel like it's BS, but it surely did happen."

After getting a note from a doctor prescribing  30 days bed rest because of partial carbon monoxide asphyxiation due to an improperly repaired exhaust leak, they fired me for refusing to disobey my doctor's orders. I was rapidly awarded unemployment and temporary disability. It wasn't until a few years later that I was able to get back in the seat for completely unrelated issues. It was at that time I had discovered SRT had put 3 bad marks on my DAC. Load abandonment, equipment abandonment and a fictitious unpreventable accident with over 10k$ damage. The first two I was able to dispute thanks to the anal record-keeping practices of the State of Arizona and a few well-placed phone calls. The third took a nasty letter from an attorney but all marks were removed quickly once they realized I wasn't a sheep who didn't have the balls to stand up for himself.

Trucking,3deubm,ShadowTamer_UO,4,Wed Jul 15 23:52:59 2015 UTC,"I told newbies a hundred times, call the shipper or receive and get directions, if you have Qualcomm the number is right there from your dispatcher. Many have an automated system, hit some number anytime for directions. Others, just write down instructions in a little fat notebook. Yeah that's the old school way, it still works and you get the correct turn by turn directions for a truck route. No, I don't trust GPS, have you on the wrong side of the interstate or worse in a restricted or residential zone!"
Trucking,3deubm,kw900,5,Wed Jul 15 18:52:50 2015 UTC,"This. And to add, if you are unfamiliar with the area it's a good idea to have google maps open when getting directions from a shipper/receiver so you have a reference of what they are talking about."

Trucking,3de6p8,rajia2012,5,Wed Jul 15 15:59:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. But you need to get a massive paper trail. Get in and out times from the dock with initial next to them. Ive seen some carriers with their own in/out stamp for every BOL. Sometimes dock wont initial or sign in and out times. Put it on by hand BEFORE getting signed. Don't point it out to the signer if you know they are inflexible...hope they dont notice. (DO NOT add times after it is signed, this is defrauding paperwork and could lose load pay after they compare copies.) If still wont sign find a lackie or security guard to initial an IN/OUT time. You will also need to make sure and get an update rate con from dispatcher immediately. If they change by hand they did not change in computer. It needs to be remadr and reprinted througg system not added on by hand."

Hunt and our process is as follows:   Detention department must be called within two hours of arrival or appointment time when you arrive and when you leave (if it's an open window it's within two hours of arrival and if by appointment it will be within two hours after the appointment). Time in and time out must be legibly written on bills as well as getting the customer to sign confirming this (if possible).  Invoice must include detention charge for however much you're trying to collect (pretty sure company-wide it's $50/hour after the end of the second hour).    Step 3 is where the majority of carriers mess up... Doing everything correct and then simply not invoicing for it. If the steps are not correctly followed detention will be immediately denied and there is absolutely no chance to collect once denied."
Trucking,3de6p8,TheLighterDark,3,Wed Jul 15 18:30:04 2015 UTC,"It's not the procedure, it's the dishonesty that annoys me.  I notified the rep about detention, he received the email, but never replied. I called later to get a rate con, he said the detention is approved, gave me the exact amount of detention I was going to get paid.  Didn't give me rate confirmation, said that's not their procedure. and that i should go ahead and invoice with that detention amount, and I should get paid.   This is on the phone, so i have no way of proving this.  This is what's annoying, they treat you like an idiot, don't inform you, and are dishonest. It's not just JB Hunt, there are many other shitty brokers out there that are like that. I don't know how these people sleep at night."

Trucking,3de6p8,hermes123456,4,Wed Jul 15 23:16:43 2015 UTC,"I've had JB Hunt pay $500 detention on the shipping and $350 on the receiving end of a single load. JB is the easiest broker in the world to get detention from if you follow the rules.   Call the detention line when driver checks in / Call again when loaded. Once you get your bol's make sure times are marked on it, submit documents with invoicing. They pay in 1/2 hour increments only. Invoice, receive settlement for main load and then like a week or two later get check from accessorial side.   You don't call the rep about detention or that office, detention is handled by detention line. Read the confirmation, 2nd page tells you what's needed."
Trucking,3de6p8,kw900,3,Wed Jul 15 20:18:10 2015 UTC,"Your company should have to pay your driver detention regardless of what JB pays. All those advertisements say detention pay, so pay-up buddy!"
Trucking,3de6p8,kw900,3,Wed Jul 15 17:30:52 2015 UTC,I work for two owner operators. I don't have money to pay them detention. The drivers pay me 8% of what they get from JB Hunt/brokers to find loads for them.
Trucking,3de6p8,colorado_cdl,3,Wed Jul 15 17:35:13 2015 UTC,The way to handle that is to settle all this shit upfront BEFORE you take the load.

Trucking,3dcxy4,adventure_dog,2,Thu Jul 16 08:46:39 2015 UTC,"Their Salt Lake facility is huge.  The facility can house up to 100 people, they also have no problem stuffing 10 people to a room. The rooms have their own shared showers and lockers so bring a padlock and shower shoes ( you don't want to get something nasty on your feet like warts.)  They have a restuarant  and a convenience store inside, with prices to gouge your wallet. You need to take a taxi or their shuttle bus if you want to get to the Walmart or other stores.  They'll make you wait for hours for processing steps, just to watch how everyone reacts. Got a problem with waiting? You're gone.  The more people there are the less time you have to practice or drive. Over 300 people showed up for my orientation.  They'll recruit anyone and everyone it can be sorted out when everyone shows up, and they'll inform the police to people breaking parole or warrents.  The training materials are decent and so were the school instructors. There were a couple of school driving instructors that were terrible though.  They also passed just about everyone on test day. Their instructors are qualified to issue cdl's so ne need to worry about failing.  Both of my otr instructors got caught up in the lease program so I got no back up time until I was on my own.  The first one was decent and the second one drove for 30 days and leased.  The second guy was a nightmare.  They were terrible to me my brother passed away during training.  They treated me like shit over that.  Then they withheld my pay for the last 4 weeks of my contract. My last day there they tried to threaten me to get me to train students, not to mention constant issues with dispatchers.  Prime had nicer facilities and a cafeteria that was cheap and affordable.  Werner also had nice facilities and affordable cafeteria food. I think both also had decent fitness facilities."

Just get your CDL from a third party school or community college and finance via loan and pay back with first years wage / tuition reimbursement (if your first company offers it) or check with your local government's job & family office, they often offer grants or pay for cdl school.

He was taken in by the golden-tongued lease sales guys and went went the lease program. Oh woe is anyone who leases with CRE.   Long story short, he returned the truck in pristine condition, never missed a payment, had a perfect delivery and driving record, etc and moved on to greener pastures. C.R. England did not care for this and decided to put $100,000 debt on his credit report! The hell. Months and many lawyer calls later it was dealt with, but man, they are truly a horrific company.  C.R. England has prison level security for a reason at their main campus offices. They know they are reviled and loathed by drivers far and wide due to their shifty, shady, and unethical business practices.  My husband still keeps in touch with his original trainer who is still with CRE, and who makes significantly less and has many more complaints but he won't leave for some reason.  As for my husband, he has driven for half a dozen companies over the years and none raise his ire more than C.R. England.  Good luck and may the odds be ever in your favor with CRE."

I'm currently at a third party driving school, so right now I'm doing nothing through cr , or at least that's how I'm viewing it. Really concerned with the impact it could have on a viable career if I just finish here, then go to another company.

Trucking,3dajk3,Hard_at_it,5,Tue Jul 14 19:49:53 2015 UTC,"I don't haul, but I used to manage a gas hauling fleet and still dispatch to one.  You get to sleep at home each night, but the days can vary pretty wildly depending on the company you're working for. My guys would typically run 14 hours for 3 days in a row, then come in for a 4 hour shift the 4th day, and then another 14 hour shift the 5th day----then I'd ask them to run a 6th day because they had the hours.  The fuel markets run 23:15 minutes a day, Sunday night to Friday night, and the difference between lifting a load at 5:59 PM and 6:01 PM can sometimes be $1000. Everything revolves around these price changes because you're hauling a volatile commodity (both physically as in it's hazmat as well as economically because the oil markets are crazy).  Depending on the company you might need to learn a surprising amount of loading information---which should accompany each dispatch ticket---but you may have 5 different products from 5 different suppliers at each terminal, and each terminal's load out system is different, and you've got to get every single detail correct.  If you're working 5 days 10+ hours a day, you should be making $50-60k after bonus, to give a range.  Expect to work a lot less in the winter, as Spring/Summer are the busy/driving seasons."

The training is so long because you're usually only doing 3 loads in a day, it takes 3 visits to get a card at a terminal, and you may need 10+ terminal cards to be able to run on your own.

Same site says Costco gas stations average 12m gallons a year, which would make for, what, 6 tanker fills a day? That would jive with what the workers at the Costco gas stations have told me...

Trucking,3dbegw,TechnoEquinox,2,Wed Jul 15 01:30:02 2015 UTC,"Is there a way to garner a map, from state to state, of every Port of Entry?    What's the rule of thumb for those?"
Trucking,3dbegw,TechnoEquinox,2,Wed Jul 15 01:34:22 2015 UTC,"Well, on truck atlases, they are marked with a red arrow. You can find a list of them online too, I just don't remember where. Rule of thumb on those is to assume you're gonna get pulled in. Depending on your company and yourself depends on your actual odds though. I.e, California has checkpoints that every truck goes through no matter what."
Trucking,3dbegw,mrsjacktripper,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:02:28 2015 UTC,"pretty high, depends on how busy there are and it's going to be bad if they do.   you could probably skip one (people do all teh time) but scale after scale, bad.  And some states (midwest, NE) are much more strict about it than others."
Trucking,3dbegw,Cresano,2,Wed Jul 15 18:29:49 2015 UTC,She could possibly get all the way to Mexico.  It happens.
Trucking,3dbegw,mrsjacktripper,3,Wed Jul 15 03:16:25 2015 UTC,"Let's get a bit straight here.   Is she driving commercial, as in dragging product, or is she just some chick in a rig? Cause with a little Not-for-hire flair, she's set, aside from some scales.   My girlfriend can actually drive a big rig. Hell, I've seen that woman navigate a worksite with a big ass Caterpillar. She's 22 and can drive at least as well as I can. But she's half-Country, born next to the tractor kinda country.   In most cases though, unless you have a very particular set of skills, navigating a newer rig is impossible. Most trucks are sat-navved, e-code locked, and slathered in company logos and names, truck numbers, and some are even capable of being shut down remotely. My dispatcher can see exactly where I am at any given time.   Also, I assume you're writing an RP character?"

Basically, if you are in the United States, you can legally make personal use copies of dvd's you own. They have no way to know that you dont own the dvd, and you have a better excuse then most to want a digital backup (in the eyes of the law).  As for encryption, when you set a password, just pick a page from a cdl manual (or something readly available in the truck) and use the first line on that page without spaces or special characters as your password.

Trucking,3d4518,dc3800,6,Mon Jul 13 11:07:18 2015 UTC,Depends on the truck and what's in it. If it's a van or reefer keep in mind you are pulling a 400sqft sail down the road. If it's empty a 70mph cross wind will make your spucter pucker. If it's got a significant amount of weight it's not as bad but can still be two hands full. If you are dealing with gusty wind that can be a lot more dangerous. If you are in a storm with high wind and it suddenly changes direction or you encounter hail you might be near a tornado. Watch for green lightning and transformer flashes. If you are running with super singles you are more at risk of hydroplaning in heavy rain or standing water.

Trucking,3d4518,subhuman1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"Tornados that form in hurricanes are very short-lived and are usually a result of cooler air falling rapidly through a small section of warmer air. The slight spin that results is accelerated by the rapid laterally moving air on each side of the pocket of low pressure. These vortices are usually extremely localized and almost always confined to ""feeder bands"".  Tornados that form from supercells or convergence lines are the result of a large amount of cooler, lower pressure air falling through a gap in a much larger and warmer higher pressure air mass.   So while the two are both spinning columns of air the mechanics vary greatly."
Trucking,3d4518,eog_prod,5,Tue Jul 14 15:11:00 2015 UTC,"Probably the hardest question to get a finite answer to as far as driving conditions, mainly from there being so many factors.  I have heard drivers saying that an empty 53 ft takes little more than 40 mph at a direct angle to tip the wagon and others say they have driven light / empty through 60-80 and made it up right.  I have always wondered what the actual reasonable limit is but I have yet to see an agree'd upon number.  I will tell you that consistent straight winds are easier to manage but driving through a passing storm cell that gusts up from zero to 60+ will make you wanna pull over real fast if you're empty.  When you feel the whole cab lunging to your side and the wheel tugging and you can visibly see lift / lean on your trailer in the mirrors you have to be out right stupid not to pull off.  At that point the rig staying up right is completely out of your control and in the hands of mother nature and that is never a good scenario.   P.S one trick I learned from an old timer was to shove your trailer tandems all the way to your rear to limit the winds effect on your trailer, and it does dampen the effect when I have tried it.  Something with the fulcrum having not as much trailer behind it gives the wind less leverage to shove you over into another lane."
Trucking,3d4518,butternip,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:44:05 2015 UTC,Unsure about the science on this but I have experienced the same thing. It seems more applicable to air ride trailers but I haven't pulled a spring ride box since '03 and I've slept since then.
Trucking,3d4518,eog_prod,6,Tue Jul 14 06:16:58 2015 UTC,"All the weather channel said was gusts up to 70mph.   The faster the wind speed the slower you need to drive, if you're running a van and your load is light or you're empty you may end up having to shut down for the day.  There's company policies that require trucks to shut down if the winds exceed 60 mph as they can blow a truck over.  States like Wyoming will shut down it's borders to light loads and empty trucks if the winds exceed 55mph.  I've got lots of experience with high winds and don't recommend driving in them."

But if you're tight on time there's no reason to waste 3 hours getting it replaced when there may be a more convenient time later on.  For example, if this were on one of my trucks I would be looking to get it replaced. But, I'd wait as long as I could if there was a rain day scheduled 72 hours out, or if there's another tire that's about to need replacing in a few days too, or if I have another truck going in, or for any host of reasons.

It also helps to remind them of how stupid the load is when they send it, for instance when I get one now i send a message that says I will not be on time and the reason is chicago traffic. keep in mind I'm driving in about a 50 mile radius of the city 29 out of 30 days a month. it translates roughly to ""bitch...this chicago."" in the common tongue."

Every agency from local law enforcement, state, and federal will have to draw up it's own rules, regulations, policies, ect and go through all sorts of BS.  What if one is stolen?  I guarantee insurance companies are not going to provide cargo coverage to high theft commodities without a driver in the truck to protect the load.  Insurance agencies will need time to evaluate their own risk based on test groups that run for a year or two, they are not going to want to write policies to anyone otherwise...

Something that helped me was when I realized that your backing the trailer and your truck is the steering wheel, the trainers at whatever school you go to will give you a decent understanding, and the otr trainer should teach you the rest of what you'll need to know. As far as life on the road as a female? I have no clue what you gals are supposed to piss in lol."

For me (and this is only me), the rig just doesn't look as big in my mirrors as it actually is when I'm maneuvering (objects are smaller than they appear?). It's when I walk up to it in profile and go ""That fucking truck is 'UGE!). But even that is no big deal. It's just more tail on the dog."

I personally faced more gender bias/sexism and sexual harassment when I worked in those other industries than I've ever seen in this job.   My job requires me to be in shipping and receiving inspecting freight and it requires to be on the shop floor inspecting parts and doing quality control.   From the customer POV my guys in the back really like the female drivers who deliver our freight because they are often more professional, friendlier, and more customer service minded than some male drivers. Those same female drivers are very respected by their coworkers, from fellow drivers to dispatch. I've been here a long time so I know a lot of the people at our local terminals, some of them personally.   I find that men in this industry really respect women in this industry that can hold their own, meaning understanding and doing the job. If they treat you like a dumbass that doesn't know what you're doing its not because you're a woman, it's because you're a dumbass."

I tell my trainees not to get stressed out, you'll get it, any frustration is just part of the learning process. If you pass the backing portion of the road test you're good to go. Once you're on your own don't worry about how long it takes to back. Better to be safe.  Is OTR your goal or assumed path? If the latter, contact the LTL and other local gigs in your area.

Going into it I was nervous. I think everyone is before they learn. After 3 days in the training, it finally just clicked. You'll be confused as hell, you'll get frustrated, and then suddenly out of nowhere, you'll just get it. After my fourth day, I was backing straight, backing driver side, blindsiding, backing through cones, putting it in real tight spots no problem. You'll do great. And being female wont hurt anything. Depending on where you live (if you're in Canada, especially) it will help as companies are legally required to be 'Diverse', meaning if you're anything other than a straight, white, male, you're in."

Trucking,3cvs5l,vanishing_point,3,Sat Jul 11 13:54:21 2015 UTC,"Because when they get where they are going, they need to be compatible with the temperatures at the receiving facility. I.E. ""Don't bring those 100 degree pallets into my frozen food facility!"""

They get other truck driving work in the off season also.

It's gonna be their unwillingness to work this kind of job for the most part to begin with.   A higher wage for truckers would absolutely help the shortage, but you're talking about companies spending money, and they FUCKING HATE doing that beyond what is absolutely needed.   On the other hand, this industry needs more young blood. I'm 24 and the youngest trucker I'm aware of. Most I've seen are in their 40's or older. And, you know, if truckers were overall treated better by companies and society as a whole, a lot of this shortage would disappear. Maybe not overnight, but there wouldn't be a massive shortage anymore."
Trucking,3cvshi,locoa53l,5,Sat Jul 11 04:46:29 2015 UTC,I'm thinking this might be a left lane restriction problem. Four wheelers don't even see those signs.

So they get stuck behind a car that may sometimes be doing a reasonable  speed but other times because they were with a group of friends or whatever not paying attention and the truck backed up.   I've seen that were one car in the middle lane is screwing up traffic for miles because the trucks can get around. But more than likely it was probably just some assholes, there are some in every profession."

Trucking,3cvshi,Failborg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:09:12 2015 UTC,"They can but the right lane is not for passing. That's why the sign always says ""slower traffic keep right"" and because 9 times out of 10 they are not allowed in the left lane, so the middle lane is our fast/passing lane.

The other part of the reality is you are going to take a 30% cut to your income because you are going to be working a lot less. In most cases truck driving only pays around $40,000-$45,000/year at 40 hours/week. There is nothing wrong with making that amount, but the reason most drivers subject themselves to 60-70 hour work weeks is they want to make closer to the $70,000 mark, myself included.   You have the freedom to work less or work more, you just have to understand that truck driving isn't the hardest or most technical job, so if you want to stay in this field the only way to make good money is to work a lot of hours."

Shippers are constantly looking to cut costs, which forces companies to compete... the largest variable cost per mile is fuel and labor... so it's often the things companies focus on.  I wouldn't expect to make 6 figures as a company driver.. there are plenty of university graduates out there making 50-60k.  The best chance for an driver to make that much is to buy your own truck, dispatch yourself, and do everything solo.  They would also never lower driving hours to 8 hours... Shippers would lose their shit and lobby congress!  As far as being treated humanely?  Sounds like an empty complaint... it's not like drivers are taken out back and beaten with a hose or anything.

Trucking,3cw7ev,doggscube,2,Sun Jul 12 00:12:00 2015 UTC,"1) I'm in my first year making 1200 weekly minimum. I also touch freight. As a veteran, I'm sure you can handle that too. 2) Shop around for mini fridges. I only did OTR for a few months, but from what I've learned, yes, you should invest if that's what you wanna do. Saves a hell of a lot of money and keeps you fit. 3) I touch freight. Staying in shape is no problem. I've actually lost weight since I've joined my current company. OTR is different. I gained weight doing that. From what I've learned, OTR pays less and is bad for your health. Which is bullshit. OTR sucks. No home time, treated like shit. Just a bad experience. Obviously different for some. Just not for me. I never found time to work out. It was mostly waiting for loads and sleeping. Personally, I love my current company. Doesn't take too much experience to get into. Home daily. When I did OTR I made half of what I make now. Coulda been worth it if I stayed out as much as possible and had no bills, maybe. Using your truck as your home. It's depressing, I found. But, yeah. 4 years can be possible if you do it right. Suck it up for a few months with a starter company, don't fuck up, then jump ship and get something that pays more. Your first 6 months to first year is going to be 95% bullshit. But after 6 months (hopefully) you'll find a job at a home daily, +65K a year gig.  Your starter company shouldn't matter too much. I did Schneider. Quit. Two weeks later got a phone call saying the equipment I drove was damaged and that I was ""burning bridges"" and that I was ruining my life. A lot of people here will recommend Schneider. I posted here and that's the response I got. I mean, their training academy was really nice. But the aftershock of quitting was ridiculous. Most starter companies are shit and you should be very cautious dealing with them. Don't stay longer than you have to. If you can, find a very small company that knows you by name.  I know THIS is long, but I'm drunk. And I like ranting. And I was in your shoes not too long ago. Short answer: Yes. Worth it. Suck it up the first few months to a year, and don't fuck up."

Don't shit on our jobs because you're miserable.  Edit: Never gotten reddit gold before! Thanks lol.

Had it to do all over $14 per hour driving a trash truck for the city with retirement and benefits sure sounds better now - home every day by 4pm and off weekends and all holidays with pay. Big cities pay more than that. In NY state a police dispatcher can retire after 20 yrs. Only way a truck driver can retire is if he fails the DOT physical then they gone claim he can do 'other' work."

The guys who hate elogs are gone, and the company runs smoothly. Our safety scores went from shitty to excellent over the past few years, and we can charge higher rates b/c of it. As a dispatcher, it's also a LOT easier to keep track of trucks when I can see their logs real time along with GPS data. Big Brother is watching :D"

Trucking,3ctudi,majinspy,2,Sun Jul 12 12:29:57 2015 UTC,"It took us about a year to go to elogs before it was smooth, and a big reason we went was safety scores. We had bad stats and rising. It was starting to affect the freight we could haul. Now, we have some of the best stats in the business. We haven't gotten a single log violation for years. Even in the rare times a driver went AWOL and drove illegally, DOT just expects elogs drivers to be clean. We used to get stopped for DOT inspections all the time, now we have drivers trying to get them in order to get the small bonus we pay for clean inspections."

Trucking,3ctudi,spectacle13,-1,Fri Jul 10 20:33:16 2015 UTC,"Back when I used Driver's Daily Log for Windows, I loved the idea of a computer program to check my logs. It was very useful and the driver had complete control over his logs. However, tying the computer program to the truck and gps can only get you into some hot water, especially if you had an accident. What if you are only over on the HOS a minute or two, still illegal and your fault!!! So the only way to make sure with ELDs and elogs is to cut everything short and just go ahead shutdown early. eLogs and lack of parking can get you into trouble too.   As it is right now, even a Swift driver can edit his elogs. I expect that will change and nobody, even the safety manager cannot change a driver's electronic logs. Once they let the computers take over, they automatically charge you with a felony? Could happen"

The 2016 DT12 has awesome gear control on grades, and a full jake application kicks like a goddamn pissed off mule. It will even downshift one or two gears if it has the revs for maximum braking.  Driving normally, it will skip 1 to 3 gears and jake the motor down between shifts for instant shifting. I can feather a take off like you would in a manual, a light throttle app padtially engages the clutch.  Nothing wrong with computer controlled manuals in this age."

There are three types of tractors; a mid roof with a nice sleeper, day cab, & the type I've always heard referred to as a ""coffin"" or a ""dog box"". When I worked there (2008-2009) the majority had the coffin sleepers. I'm 5'6"" & 165lbs and I was uncomfortable.   My truck was constantly in the shop for major mechanical problems. Don't ask me what specifically, I've tried to block it out, but it was the type of stuff that leaves you eating stale crackers from a vending machine in a Rodeway Inn for three days. My truck had around 750,000 miles on it when I got out of itin 2009. Last year I was picking one of our O/Os up from a Mack dealer and there it was. Good ol' #5776 in the shop. Again. I climbed the steps and looked in the window and saw it now only had 100,000 miles on it. A miracle!  I got paid by the load and not the mile. I think 28%? I did a lot of deadheading. I mean a lot. Go from Auburndale to Dalton, Ga empty, deliver in Baltimore and then deadhead to Richmond, Va or somewhere in North Carolina.  My biggest complaint was my pathetic pay. I made more money as a teenager. My last check was so hilarious I've had it framed on my wall for the last few years now, I just took it down.   Here's a picture of my last paycheck with ComCar"

Just $350 to get towed out, but they took that shit straight out of my paycheck that friday!!! State trooper acted like it happened every week, didn't charge me anything. I looked and there was a concrete pylon laying in hole, my tire bumped it then slide over off highway - it was wet and raining. Almost looked like a setup!!!

I just called 911 (said no emergency), trooper was very helpful and called a local big truck wrecker for me and gave me a price. Didn't take 40 minutes. I always called receiver or shipper and got right directions, most are automated - hit some number for directions. On this load it was the only way in."

Again, paying attention to time and comparing the mileage paid with the actual mileage shown on GPS with their route chosen.  4) Compare GPS route with low bridge listing in Road Atlas.   5) Once that is all good to go and in the green, hit the road following only the GPS I've vetted to be an accurate route."

If I'm taking an unfamiliar route,  I pull out the big paper atlas and check for low clearances and restrictions.  Invest in an atlas.  If you only use it once,  it's worth it.   If you end up in a jam,  it's never bad to ask for help.  Call 911 and ask for help getting back on the truck route.  I've had to do that once before when someone tampered with a construction detour sign and I ended up facing a neighborhood. They backed me up and even escorted me to the appropriate road.   Google maps satellite view is also useful to see if your destination address will direct you to the right place.

I was backing in between 2 trailers and I failed to step out and look, resulting in me hitting someones trailer. I know 6 other drivers that got their cdl with me, including my brother and they each did something stupid after about 6 months.

The main issue is the organisation, I dont know how its going this time around, but when I was in it there was no supplies (water/food) made available to anyone stuck in it and the police weren't allowing anyone to sleep, they were driving up and down with their flashers on, and if they saw anyone asleep or an empty seat/guy in a bunk, they'd get out and bang on the door to get them up."

That means if any ever get a CDL they can't drive in Canada. That's a small example. I suspect the number of CDL holders who have ever in their lifetime had a DUI including personal vehicles to be much higher than 24%, so fewer truckers can deliver in Canada. Do you know what this means?  It means you pay more for everything!  Higher prices on all goods imported including food and medicine. I know everything is higher there because you have high taxes, but this just adds to the price.  Unless they changed it, drivers delivering to U.S. from Mexico are only suppose to deliver that load to U.S. and not pickup any loads here to deliver here. May be the same for Canadian truckers?

There's a term (can't find it atm) for the how people often don't notice how fast motorcycles approach head on as opposed to larger objects. The difference is exponential and inversely proportional to the size of the object, so the trucker might not have seen how fast he was approaching.  On paper, I'd say the truck driver was at fault but in every other way the motorcycle could have prevented this situation by being a little more patient."

It's hard to tell the speed but if the ramp is like 35 mph and the bike had to slow to 30, they can get over it.  If the ramp is 70 and they slowed down to 30, I can see where the trucker might have been unsafe.  However, it's not exactly easy moving or stopping a truck like that, and it wasn't like it was almost an accident or anything like that.

The group then decided to use their helmets as clubs when the RR decided to stop. Which prompted the RR to run over more people. Of course, when you surround 2 tons of steel on a 500Ib vehicle that you can be easily thrown from, and someone gets hurt for not maintaining distance, the best procedure is to blame the other guy and attack him.

Trucking,3coezb,Isca,6,Thu Jul 9 14:10:14 2015 UTC,$20 an hour is good starting pay. Esp for a new driver. I've known driver's who have been driving for 20+ years only getting 22. Question I'd ask is if you are going to get over time. And if you're willing to take that over time.  Most driving positions pay mileage. Personally I'd rather be paid hourly. Especially if I'm going to be stuck in traffic.
Trucking,3coezb,Isca,2,Thu Jul 9 14:19:52 2015 UTC,They don't pay overtime just straight time. You can work past 40 but most of these guys can't even get 50 hours
Trucking,3coezb,Isca,3,Thu Jul 9 14:34:52 2015 UTC,"My recommendation then would be to put in the 40 and go home. Don't put in more than you want to/have to. If staying longer doesn't get you more money.  You'll be hard pressed to find a company to pay you an hourly wage to drive any distance.   I'll admit I find it a little difficult to believe there's a company that doesn't pay over time after 40 that isn't a salary based pay.  Edit: especially if you've already got time at the company.  They know you, and its familiar."
Trucking,3coezb,Isca,2,Thu Jul 9 14:42:53 2015 UTC,Yeah you're right. It's just local doesn't sound appealing to me. Seeing the same people every day is annoying as hell and driving to the same stores doesn't sound appealing either. I'm sick of a daily routine. Plus I'd have to drive in Chicago almost every day. I wouldn't mind doing it sometimes but every day or other fuck that.
Trucking,3coezb,adventure_dog,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"If local isnt something you want to do then OTR is what you're gonna have to go for.   maybe something Regional? i don't know if that company offers something like that but it cant hurt to find out. sometimes the routes are different every day. but its the same thing every week... Where i Yard Drove for the drivers would do a different destination every day. but every Monday was the same. every Tuesday was the same. as unappealing as monotonous sounds. it is nice to be able to plan things.   esp if you have family/friends you like to hang out with... When you're OTR, you're going 2-3 months sometimes longer before seeing any of them."
Trucking,3coezb,Sternreisender,2,Thu Jul 9 15:26:26 2015 UTC,Yeah no regional. I know OTR is very demanding and hard but I mean I don't have much friends anymore or family. I am good with people but the past few years I've already been distancing myself. I just feel like there's so much to see than this. I live in between Milwaukee and Chicago and being tied down to a house and city just sounds so basic and boring at least for now I'm only 21. But still I have no idea at the same time how OTR is.
Trucking,3coezb,kw900,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:47:25 2015 UTC,"Can't hurt to go for a little while. i did OTR for about 8 months... just enough to get experience for a local company.   I live between Madison/Milwaukee. so i know what you mean. worst case if you choose to go OTR, leave on good terms.   that way there's always the possibility of returning once you're done with OTR. Have you checked out Old Dominion in Milwaukee? I've never worked for them. but I've heard they pay good, and you get to drive a little further depending on what they have you do.   someone else in this Sub might have a better idea about them. i just heard it from word of mouth."

The plant that makes cans in Windsor, co uses them and so does the budweiser in Fort Collins, CO the trailers have a conveyor system in the floor and the docks have a conveyor system.  They set up the entire load on the dock and it gets fed into the trailer, and at the budweiser facility it gets unloaded into the canning machine.   It's rather cool to watch and it loads and unloado 26 pallets in less than 4 minutes. The bars are used to line the trailer up perfectly"

Trucking,3cmz1l,clindh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:29:59 2015 UTC,I have my own already. I'm trying to figure out if it would be wise to keep my own authority and lease to a company.

Trucking,3cmz1l,Offroad_fun,2,Thu Jul 9 06:33:22 2015 UTC,I'd keep it. That's how I'm rolling at the moment. I'm letting my permits get mature so I can start getting offers from companies directly so I won't be leased.
Trucking,3cmz1l,kw900,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:31:53 2015 UTC,"Had a wrecker service back in the 90's. Cost me $3500 per year just for 99 mile radius intrastate only. Can't imagine what your own authority and permits will cost for 48 states today. Most owner ops here have only a 500 mile radius. Insurance too damn high, that's why drivers lease on to bigger companies - that and to get loads. If you have no loads then you have to rely on load boards which is basically backhauls, low pay. Over a few years having your own authority, the insurance will cost more than the truck!"
Trucking,3cmz1l,Harvester913,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:47:10 2015 UTC,"Probably late to the party, but it's the auto liability insurance that keeps your authority active. It costs around 500 a month or so, usually. If you're running leased onto a company you are also paying the company for that insurance.   It isn't financially reasonable to pay both. If you want to lease onto a company and see how it works out,  cancel your auto liability insurance. Your authority will go inactive. If you don't like how it works with the company, you can reinstate your authority with an $80 fee to the fmcsa and start up another auto liability insurance policy. The 80 dollar fee is a lot cheaper than paying the 500 a month for an authority you're not using."

Even the mega companies who train you, they take out about $70 a week out of your paycheck $4500 to $7000, and make you work for cheap. If you stay after you pay them off, they will pay you back so they claim, but I've never seen anybody stick with them that long.

It would be nice to know ahead of time instead of trying to spot the signs on the road.  They are covering all the fines and providing a lawyer on my behalf."
Trucking,3chwwx,ohmygodbees,2,Wed Jul 8 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"Ideally you will be provided a route when dispatched, some loads (explosives, radioactive) will require it be printed on/with the bills. I don't know if routing provided via satellite is legal. But, this link is to a rather cumbersome, but detailed, hazmat route guide via the US Gubbermint and is continually updated. Do you carry a laptop? If not, then get it to your CS/dispatch so they may provide you with legal routing. In addition, get to know the signing and watch for it. You can be pretty sure any large population area will have special routing as well as big bridges/tunnels et al. You're going to come out of this a much wiser driver and I'm glad you're company is helping to bail you out of the mess they helped get you into. Maybe your atty can call them as a witness and keep your record clean, or at least minimize the damage. Good luck, hand, and let us know how it turns out."

Trucking,3chsgv,reid8470,7,Wed Jul 8 00:36:54 2015 UTC,"For balancing tandems I use a calculator and the formula (a1-a2/2)/x  a1 is the heavier axle group, a2 is the lighter, and x is the per-hole change.  That's the difference between axle groups. Now, you need to know how many holes to slide it. For this you'd need to know the resolution of the trailer, that is the ammount of weight shifted per hole. Wabash trailers are usually 250 pounds per hole and vanguard is 500. I don't know about great dane or utility because i've never had to balance one.  Because when you move one hole you take 250 pounds off of one axle, you end up adding it to the other, so in order to get the right number of holes, you need to halve the number or else you'll end up the opposite of what you started.  So if I pick up a trailer that scales at 32,440 on the drives and 35,320 on the tandems, we'd do  35,320 - 32,440 = 2880  Now we take that number,   2880 / 2 = 1440  Let's say for the sake of argument i'm shifting the tandems on a Wabash trailer  So we take 1440 / 250 = 5.76  That is the number of holes we'd have to slide the tandems to make them perfectly balanced, 50/50. Now, obviously we can't slide the tandems .76 holes. Whether you round up or down is really a judgement call, but i prefer, if i can't match them perfectly (and you rarely can, at least on purpose) to make the drives ever so slightly heavier, so in this case, in order to do that, we'd slide the tandems back 6 holes. If it were the drives that started out heavier, we'd slide them up 5 holes.   This ended up being way longer than I meant it to be but I hope it helps someone, at least."
Trucking,3chsgv,kellanium,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:13:20 2015 UTC,"14 years and not once have I needed or used a calculator. BOL weight, length of load on trailer and a weight ticket is all you need. How much weight transfered per hole slid depends on how the load sits  on the trailer more than what brand the trailer is. If you have 45k on the trailer and it's all on and forward from the trailer axle, you aren't hardly transfering anything when sliding the axle back. If you have 5k behind the trailer axle you aren't going to transfer as much as you would if you had 10k behind the trailer axle."

Some companies will have a cutoff weight above which you are supposed to scale. My company says anything above 35k cargo weight.  Below 34K you don't need to scale, there's no way any axle group will be over the limit, barring an incredibly dense load of, say, Californium.   If I'm in no danger of being over axle I usually slide the tandems as far up as they go. Again, that's a judgement call. I know folks who have their own prefered bridge length.

Trucking,3chkfh,Ozdriver,2,Wed Jul 8 14:17:44 2015 UTC,"ah, electric has been the norm here in north america for probably the last 40+ years. air never really was that big.  as for engines, you could get cat or cummins as well, and i think detroit.  However, the only way to get the gold bulldog was to have it all mack (including suspention iirc).    as for trans, mack had all their different ones, from the 6-speed twin sticks to the quadraplex, and the air shifts with basements."

Take a truck down there and get your Class B CDL.  I believe if you need to tote a trailer though you'll need a Class A.

Our terminal manager is a former driver, so is our VP of safety, but I'm the only one in dispatch. We've had a few others come and go, both before I was moved into here and after. A big complaint was the drop in pay. Another was frustration, on the part of the former driver, at the lack of needed office skills. I agree that former drivers make the best dispatchers but many of them don't understand it's not an advancement in their current career, it's a complete change in careers.   Former drivers are more likely than not to leave the office and get back into a truck. Companies, especially smaller ones, would rather lose an office drone than a competent driver. I don't know what the solution is. Groom drivers for the office and transition them slowly? Offer company paid degree programs for drivers and not just office staff?"

Trucking,3ceixp,Clairemeraux,3,Tue Jul 7 12:39:18 2015 UTC,"Ugh. You just gave me a flashback. We had a former driver we called Supertrucker doing dispatch. He was an unreasonable ass. If he screwed up and dispatched a load that was going to be late he'd rant and rave at the poor guy he gave it to that when HE was a driver HE could've made it on time, he was so awesome he could've delivered it yesterday.

Trucking,3ce0k0,george_me25,0,Tue Jul 7 21:43:21 2015 UTC,"Cabovers are still popular in Europe. I think it's because they try to get the best fuel mileage because their taxes are so high.

Trucking,3ce0k0,kw900,7,Tue Jul 7 07:39:13 2015 UTC,It's because of length limitations mostly
Trucking,3ce0k0,Ozdriver,6,Tue Jul 7 08:11:58 2015 UTC,Cabovers generally are shorter chassis so are able to pull longer trailers while still staying within length rules.
Trucking,3ce0k0,kw900,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:07:01 2015 UTC,"Who the hell wants to pull anything longer than a 53 foot trailer! nobody I believe I read that feds do not allow states to set length restrictions on interstate and US highways, so they get round this law by setting kingpin laws they can fine you. stupid, that's the problem. Anything longer is specialized and you get permit, so no need for cabovers in the states. We got rid of them decades ago because they kill more people than conventionals and nobody likes to live in them on the road. You roll into a truck shop in America with a cabover, he gone charge you double!"
Trucking,3ce0k0,Offroad_fun,5,Tue Jul 7 08:15:18 2015 UTC,"The trucks are a lot shorter in Europe. As far as I know they can only pull a 45' trailer with a cabover, the legal overall length is so short. The sleepers are tiny on the European trucks."
Trucking,3ce0k0,sergiogsr,3,Tue Jul 7 09:45:29 2015 UTC,"Probably not in my lifetime, but I suspect they will divide the U.S. into 4 or 5 regions and do away with long haul OTR or coast-to-coast trucking. I averaged 2400 miles a week running SE, TX, and FL and was home every weekend. I always wondered why the big companies can't do the same. If they did, perhaps they wouldn't have 100% driver turnover! The only way to beat the HOS now is to run teams, and even then you run into problems if you never get home."
Trucking,3ce0k0,Ozdriver,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:13:17 2015 UTC,"Well actually, Dirksen does own trailers longer than 53,  which is why they use cabovers. Them and Gardner"
Trucking,3ce0k0,DR_JDUBZ,5,Tue Jul 7 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"If they are getting European cabovers they will need to implement safety features that you don't have in the US, because they are crazy about safety and ergonomics there.  So, you'll be getting equipment like air disc brakes, front collision warning, lane departure and automatic braking features (standard from this year in all heavy trucks).  If you think a big engine (big solid block of metal) or a hood (plastic and fiberglass) is going to protect you on an accident you'll be surprised... Since the engine is not designed to absorb energy on impacts and is going to transfer the force to the cab and most of the time it will get into the driver space, this is what kills the cab occupants (except in the Volvos and newer Macks that force engine into the floor by chassis design).  In comfort maybe you're referring that the sleeper is smaller... But you need to consider that the average footprint of the European truck driver is smaller that the driver in the US... Still plenty of space there."
Trucking,3ce0k0,sergiogsr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:25:09 2015 UTC,"That's the problem with European cabovers, the sleepers are way, way too small. Out of the question when you can get a huge sleeper on a conventional. OK for Europe but no good for countries where length laws are more liberal."
Trucking,3ce0k0,tw33kz0r,0,Tue Jul 7 22:58:14 2015 UTC,"Fuck automatic braking. I know how to fucking drive, keep the goddamn computers out! I'm a truck driver, not a babysitter. Automatic braking is NOT a safety feature. Nor is stability control, nor is abs, nor is traction control. Unless your a fucking incompetent driver in which case you should just give up the job to someone who does enjoy driving."
Trucking,3ce0k0,DR_JDUBZ,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:38:37 2015 UTC,"Just consider that there is already a driver shortage and that not every driver is an expert, joyful driver and fault proof as you are.  From my point of view, everybody makes mistakes, some don't cause any harm but others, depending on the situation and conditions can cause the death of someone.  If myself or my family is on the road and the transport companies are pushing drivers so hard, any help to reduce the risk of having an accident should be welcomed."

I have dealt with loads that originally paid good, then the rate gets destroyed by idiots pulling loads off, then sticking them back up for 10% less.   That crap will cause you more problems than you want to think about.  Also, when using load boards, such as DAT, be prompt in paying on delivery, and have clear terms.

Werner also does the reimbursement program which is something like $50 a week up to $5,000 which actually sucks when they pay you and you have to pay whoever you owe.  Werner also isn't all that great of a company, if you don't have the money or capability to fund schooling on your own. There's lots of companies that offer work contracts free schooling for 6 to 12 months of work, if you don't hold your end of the contract you end up owing them the money.

Do that and go with Roehl if you can stand a bit of hard work doing flatbed for more money, or Schneider.  Maybe Crete if they'll take a new license holder.  If you must get in with a company that will get you the licence, Prime is the only one I'd consider.   Something else...a lot of newbies get steered into reefer (refrigerated) work, which mainly means food.  But the grocery distribution centers you deal with are notoriously abusive to drivers!!!

At a minimum, make sure there's some detention pay so you get something for all that waiting.  My worst was a month ago waiting 36 hours I shit you not, at a Tyson meat plant that Angeles like Cthulu's crotch with VD.  There's less detention in dry-van work, on average.  Crete will pay 45cents a mile for dryvan, 48cents in their reefer division (Shaeffer) just to help make up for that issue, but even that 3cents a mile ain't really enough.  Goes to show though.   Detention is far less of a problem in flatbed!  You generally get treated better by shippers and receivers, paid better. Show up at a construction site with shit they need and they jump right on it once you have the straps off. There's less backing up into right spaces where you could ding something, and the trailers are a bit shorter.  You also get paid to tarp and strap the loads down... but in bad weather that's a major pain, and there's more danger...you can slip and fall off those loads.  But if you're strong, agile and don't fear heights, the money can be very good and this is the path to the big oversize heavy haul loads that pay huge."

Then got a regional lowboy gig from there once I had been doing it for about a year.    Heavy haul is cool but you really got to have your shit together.  $2.5mm machine behind you, several hundred dollars worth of permits sitting next to you, escorts/sherrifs squawking you on the CB constantly...and still stupid ass 4wheelers everywhere doing their best to get themselves killed by you.  Flashing lights, signs, a giant ass piece of equipment...and they'll still merge right in front of you and smash the brake pedal.  Bridges, weight restrictions, curfews, where to park, where to fuel (if you can even fit)- all have to be taken in to account, moreso than just pulling a van.  It's hard, it pays (sometimes) better, it's a lot of work, and a hell of a lot of fun.  I'd never pull anything else, but it's never just ""grab that big thing and go"".  You can never be on auto-pilot and cruise along.  You're tired by the end of the day.  You also have to know how to secure that big piece of shit that needs to be moved.  Once you hit pavement, it's all on you and DOT loves to scrutinize.  They'll pull you in, go over your rig, measure, weigh, re-weigh, page through your logs and books and permits at every weight station.  No such thing as a greenlight or pre-pass.  Overall though, it's a blast.  Try flatbedding/stepdeck equipment hauling to get the ropes down, then find someone who will let you pull a lowboy.  Go from there."

But just look at the names of trucks you see in your area half of them will have phone number on the back of them. Give them a ring and see what's good. A lot of places go by word of mouth and don't really advertise so that's the best way to find more local small firms.  See who's driving in your area get the name and Google or call the number on the back of the truck.

One of my biggest complaints about them (besides slow trucks, miles and so on) was that solo drivers get put in the lightweight trucks. A lightweight truck is a truck basically designed for people who go home once a week, they are very small compared to your normal otr trucks. Having to go out for 4 weeks at a time in a truck where your bed is touching your seat sucks."

Trucking,3c8l55,camostorm,2,Tue Jul 7 12:55:37 2015 UTC,"I went with Prime, I definitely recommend it. Note that I drove in their flatbed division only, I don't know if the reefer side is different but I'd recommend flatbed, either way.   Probably the best starting pay, for companies that train you. As far as I know. They'll train you for ""free"" (sign a contract to stick around for a year, other wise they prorate when you leave. I paid a few hundred to leave a month early) APUs/inverters are standard. Fridges are expensive as fuck but the trucks have a space for 'em Flatbed division: Slightly less pay, but you get the full size truck and you get to flatbed. Tarp pay, the great outdoors, etc. Flexible: I got home when I wanted, if I wanted to get routed through a certain area I generally could. I didn't go home often though, personal choice.  Low pressure: I very rarely got shit from dispatch. I missed like 5 friday deliveries over 2 months, sat for the weekend, and never caught shit. Most of the time I had a somewhat valid excuse. Of course, in all of those situations, my friday delivery was what dispatch/I planned, not set in stone with the customer. If I ever missed a firm delivery date/time there was a damn good reason for it. Basically, if I have all the miles I need for the week, I'll gladly 'pace' my self. Get close to the customer friday afternoon, enjoy a nice weekend off somewhere. Start off monday morning with with plenty of hours and a better load than I would have got friday afternoon (friday afternoon loads are the fucking worst)   Might be that I just got lucky, and I don't doubt that, but my experience was good."

Trucking,3c8l55,Onto_new_ideas,9,Mon Jul 6 09:57:52 2015 UTC,"Actually the speed at which each truck is governed is slightly different. So some might be able to go a bit faster, but not all of them can. And why go slow? Fuel mileage bonuses! You get your best mpg at around 55. So they schedule the loads right, reward good driving, and they save tons off money on fuel.   They have been reliable, don't push you to do illegal crap. They have new trucks/trailers with APUs so you don't have as much time in the shop.  If something happens and you can't make a delivery they re-power it.   If you need home time they try to make it happen. You might not get home on a specific date, but they'll get you darn close.   Are they perfect, no. Are they better than the other mega carriers, I believe so.   My advice? Be professional. Be polite. Do your best. Better to go slow and not screw up than to do something stupid. Be nice to your dispatcher, usually it pays off.  Once you start driving solo go for the mileage bonuses. They add up! 50-200 more a week."

Prime profits, is somewhat safer throwing new drivers into slower trucks, the new drivers make good enough cash... I don't see the problem, from their perspective. If you make more than 45 CPM, you have no reason to go to Prime unless you're going to lease. If you're starting out, that's pretty good pay for a company that's going to train you.  The truck ('13 pete) I had got crappy fuel mileage so i rarely got good enough mileage to get a significant bonus, but I could see it being a regular boost to thet check. The '14 and '15 freightshakers from what I understand do a lot better.  The companies trucks are generally governed at 62 on cruise, 58 on pedal.

Trucking,3c8hoe,vanishing_point,3,Mon Jul 6 19:53:08 2015 UTC,"Lack of flexibility with regulations imposing a hard time schedule that might be ideal for a  factory, but does not translate well to an industry which is subject to numerous uncontrollable factors affecting daily operations. No HOS rule is going to be perfect, the problem now is there was a fairly good rule in place but it was fucked with until it was broken. Now I have to take a half hour break because other trucking companies were running their drivers by the clock and would bitch them out if they stopped for a break. Why should I have to be penalized because there are shitty trucking companies out there abusing their drivers?"
Trucking,3c8hoe,Usernameavailabl,8,Mon Jul 6 14:39:39 2015 UTC,"Best to keep in mind that all the current regs on HOS came from somewhere. It's not like there were a bunch of bored people sitting around with nothing to do, so they decided to come up with a bunch of rules governing how much time truckers could drive their trucks. There is a key point here, and it is very important.  Left to their own devices, truck drivers specifically and the trucking industry in general will not regulate themselves. This has been proven over and over.  So what happens? A bunch of bad shit happens is what. And the people on the outside who have nothing to do with the trucking industry look at the carnage and go ""Someone needs to do something. These guys are out of control."" And you know what? They're right. Because truckers specifically and the trucking industry in general refuses to self regulate.  So now you have a bunch of politicians who have no idea what the business is all about making new rules. And they have to do that because their constituents and the evidence says that we need new/more rules. And why is that? Because truck drivers and the trucking industry, who as a collective claim to know more about this business than anyone, refuse to use that self proclaimed knowledge to govern and regulate themselves. I have seen the enemy, and it is us."
Trucking,3c8hoe,vanishing_point,2,Sun Jul 5 23:22:00 2015 UTC,"This is not entirely true.  The. HOS regulations were not put in place based on scientific research and in depth study on what amount of time driving, on/off duty, was the safest formula.  The 11 hours of allowed driving  is a result of compromise between parties with different agendas.  Other than generic research of sleep patterns and adequate rest periods, nothing can be tied to a true scientific study.  That is why fmcsa is taking a beating over the 34 hour restart changes that were put in place and subsequently suspended due to lack of data proving the change would lead to safer highways.  I would love to be proven wrong on this.    Does the 70% windows regulations irritate anyone besides me?  It is based on a 1966 recomendation from NTSB.   No research, no study on the percent that would be safest, just a recommendation made 50 years ago.  So, the next time you pass a trooper or a d.o.t. Suburban with limo tint on all of their windows and your cab is 95 degrees with the air on full bore, think of the 800 pages of fmcsa regulations that keep you from being put out of service but are based on very little proven safety data."

Something like 2 hours of overclock per 34-hour reset, meaning if I'm out of time on any of the clocks, but absolutely need to be somewhere before I get my 30, 10, or 34, I'll have a max of 2 additional hours per week to handle stuff like that."

Rather than just giving a rant about why I'm just going to say that the only way to fix this industry is to take drivers off of incentive pay. In nearly every industry that utilizes incentive pay as the majority of employee compensation you find corruption/illegal behavior and unsafe or unethical practices etc. You want truck drivers to make the right choice when it comes to being safe then they need to know that at the end of their 70 hour week there will be a fair paycheck for them regardless of hiccups. All of the risk in this industry is placed on the drivers shoulders and the HOS regs only add pressure to push things as far as a driver can.

The HOS regulations don't allow that though.  When I went solo, I followed the regulations. At the end of a 14 hour work day, I was worn out mentally and didn't feel particularly safe driving. Chugging coffee helped keep me awake, but it felt like I was destroying my stomach. I ended up leaving the industry; I do greatly respect those who can handle the long work days though."

I wasn't implying the man needs to be a mobile mechanic that can swap transmission on the side of the road. Regardless, it's imperative to have at least an operational and working knowledge of how a big truck works. If not, he's liable to get screwed over at the mechanic when the inevitable does occur and something breaks, or pay extra for simple repairs he could be doing himself.

A less than 400k mile truck might last you 3-4 yrs, but I would stick to SE or regional - make sure the truck hasn't been in a major accident or totaled & re-certified! In a few years you need at least a 2010 to drive legal in California. 07 is the min right now and make sure it doesn't have an 06 engine or you can't go to Cali. I never liked Mack at all.

Now that I think about it, they just posted it wrong because all trucks do not have same height tires and wheels - how could they know? They have laid asphalt over the old road so much and did not remeasure it, or the road has sunk so that now some 13'6"" trucks can go under. It's posted wrong. Even the CDL manual warns about this, just because you can go under loaded doesn't mean you can go under there empty. Not as prevalent today with air ride trailers but in general it's still true.

The first few days you do A LOT of paperwork, some graded homework, and some graded paper log and safety stuff. You also do a lot of yard work, slow manuevering and backing as well as 30-40 minutes on the road a day. First Friday you have a pretrip/road test just like at the DMV to see if you are qualified enough to go out with a mentor the following Saturday. We lost about 10 on this day. The second Friday (while you're out with your mentor) he submits more grades for you. We lost about 5 on this, mainly people not enjoying the lifestyle. The third and final week is all about the qualcom and logging and bs, finishing on that Friday with a couple/uncouple, backing, road test, paper log test, and qualcom usage test. We lost probably another 5 out of the 10 or so remaining on this day. It was intense three weeks, but I'll be damned if I can't say it made me a MUCH better driver. And on that note, Im very happy I chose Schneider. Safety first safety always.  **Pertaining to that last sentence, their motto, I've had some questionable scenarios come up already, a quick call to my driving manager (they're called DBLs, driving business leader at Schneider) and they will never ever tell you to do something unsafe or illegal, even if it means a service failure or late delivery.

Car insurance premiums are highest for single males between the ages of 16-25, presumably because they are the most ""reckless"" demographic.  We know the ATA is lobbying for it in a last ditch effort to keep wages low.  So let them lower the age.  Teen unemployment is at record highs.  Many are forgoing car ownership and driver licenses because they see it as unnecessary expense.  Let the ATA and trucking companies see how many 18-21 year olds want to give up alcohol, weed, and their social lives to become over-regulated, over-scrutinized, under-appreciated worker bees who may get to see their friends and family for three days every three weeks.  So when that plan falls flat on its face, maybe companies will reconsider the compensation structure of drivers."

Trucking,3bznqd,00stephen,6,Fri Jul 3 13:19:00 2015 UTC,"At my previous IT job, which was eliminated in favor or outsourcing, I was told by my boss ""an eighth-grader could do your job"".  There's a movement afoot where an emphasis is placed on ""thought leadership"". The premise is that smart managers would simplify process and standardize work to the degree a housepainter could do it.  Then they could pay people housepainter wages to perform it.  The problem is often those in ""thought leadership"" positions do not have the cognitive or leadership skills necessary to reduce tasks to the simplest level (or the tasks themselves are not suitable for reduction/simplification).  Sure, the eighth-grader could do my job, as long as my job consisted of deleting emails unnecessarily sent to me and rubber-stamping code promotions.  But when the sh*t hits the fan and there's outage with downstream impact was when my wage was recouped by my value added.  So we see the same thing here with the corporate mega carriers wanting to lower the CDL age, so they can pay the lowest possible wage for the work performed.  They believe ""process"" will ensure driver correction of improper shipper paperwork, timely address of maintenance/safety issues, on-the-road judgement calls that prevent accidents, the individual attentiveness needed to recognize all of the above, and the responsibility to conduct their lives outside of work in a manner that does not adversely affect their ability to perform the job.  Let them lower the age, and see how well ""process"" set in place by a 50+ year old is executed by an 18 year old."

For a lot of people, trucking is a second option, or a second career. Trucking companies can't appeal to high school seniors because as a trucker, you can't really do shit until you're 21. Other occupations that don't have age limits can try to recruit as early as possible. Even if you go to a tech school for truck driving right out of high school, you're still stuck with a cdl that you can't do too much with for at least two years.  I would love to get paid more, but I don't think that will entirely fix the industry turnover rate. Even companies that pay really well still have high turnover rates compared to other jobs.

I've talked to a handful of drivers using the old D12, and by all accounts that was a rock solid motor.  Be aware the injector cups on the D13 are likely to fail right around 500,000 miles... just as the warranty expires.  If your mpg begins to drop, those cups cracking are likely the culprit.    Yes, the dealer network is smaller than competitors.  But aside from the injector cups (400k miles) and DEF doser (500k miles), there hasn't been much that has required a shop's involvement."

I paid cash for my schooling, and there are plenty of starter companies who will pay your tuition back, incrementally.  I chose to drive 1099 for a guy who contracts to a much larger company, in an arrangement that allows you to pick your own loads.  Kind of like Uber, except with 40 tons and 18 wheels.  There are disadvantages to 1099 work, but this arrangement allows me to bring my dog without paying any deposit or fees.  I get to learn what it's like to run one's own business -- at least in a contractor arrangement -- from someone who's been successful at it thus far.  And I have significant say in when I take my time off (eg, I'm off today through Monday).

Those ten year old trucks may the only product he doesn't get paid to endorse. ;-)  Whatever path you choose, drive for someone else for it at least for 6 months to a year before making the financial investment of your own truck.  Once you've done that, you're married to the profession until its paid off (figure at least three years, if you buy new)."
Trucking,3bz3uv,cdnincali,2,Fri Jul 3 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the excellent response. I pretty much assumed the same about buying the truck, but it seemed worth asking. Seems like the universal answer is right in line with common sense.   in an arrangement that allows you to pick your own loads. Kind of like Uber, except with 40 tons and 18 wheels. There are disadvantages to 1099 work, but this arrangement allows me to bring my dog without paying any deposit or fees.   This is pretty much exactly what I want. Sounds like a perfect option for me.  Thanks for your feedback!"
Trucking,3bz3uv,cdnincali,6,Fri Jul 3 20:00:57 2015 UTC,"Would you buy a restaurant if you'd never been a chef?  Would you buy a garage if you'd never been a mechanic?  So to answer your question, no don't buy a truck. Get at least two years of experience. Set your first year to learning how to be a good driver (it's a lot more than driving).   Set your second year to tracking your truck's expenses and researching companies you might lease yourself to. Study the rate they pay, FSC, miles, etc. If you can see a way to have more $ than what you're getting as a company driver then you might read to buy a truck. That would be more $ after you've set aside some for maintenance, repairs, and other non-fixed costs.   Do not buy a truck right off, you're too green."
Trucking,3bz3uv,CatTender,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:14:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the excellent advice. I guess the core of my question was one of economics-- do you make enough more as an owner-operator to justify the extra risk? Based on your answer, it sounds like the answer is ""not always"" even for a more experienced driver. Does that sound like a reasonable summary?"
Trucking,3bz3uv,Kidnya,2,Fri Jul 3 18:26:17 2015 UTC,"The figure bandied about for profit from revenue on a per truck basis is 3%. That is once fuel, driver pay, maintenance, finance charges, etc. are figured for a truck the company is making 3% as profit. That means for an O/O that they'd make that 3% instead of the trucking company. BUT, and there is always a but, a trucking company will most likely get parts (think tires, filters, and the like) cheaper as they are ordering hundreds or thousands at a time. A trucking company has other economies of scale, think fuel discount, that it can use to lower its costs. This profit that a trucking company can may be eaten up by solo operator's higher costs. Additionally, companies have higher reserves and income streams and can weather unexpected events better than the solo operator.   Learn the business. If after a few years you find a niche you could fill as a solo operator, even leased onto a company, then get a good used truck. Be sure you have cash reserves, a business plan, a good contract. And for <insert deity's name here>'s sake, DO NOT lease a truck from CRE or any other company."

Trucking,3bxcd1,Dustin6s,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:02:21 2015 UTC,"Avoid.  I made this mistake.  They're as bad as CR England.  CRST is also losing freight - their safety scores are in the toilet, they lost the CAT contact as a result and some others.  Many drivers are sitting.   If you possibly can, get your commercial driver's license from a non-trucking-company school or a community college.  Get a grant for either.  Then get into Schneider, Prime or Roehl if you want flatbed.  If you have to do company training, no other choice, go with Prime.   The only bad part about Prime is, they want you to do three months of road training.  Which is paid - $600/wk the first month, $700/wk the last two months.  That is more than you'll make as a solo CRST driver, I shit you not.  Then once you're actually in Prime go for the deal where you make 70% of what the truck bills.  Keep your speed down, 60mph or less, keep your mpg up that way, you'll make decent money for a year and then bail for whatever real trucking job you want."

That means if everything is perfect you can reasonably only gain 1-6 minutes within an hours driving eeking out or gaining time.  Why is this important? Because stomping on the pedal and being a jerk on the road to gain precious seconds is amazingly stupid. And most likely even if you succeed in gaining a couple minutes, you'll most likely loss those gained minutes due to traffic flow, construction, in attention to the fuel pedal, weather, wind, ect.... Essentially it'll most likely equal out anyways and you're stupid to put other people's lives at risk for literally the selfishness over a second you may or may not have gained.

Fuel capacity 1800  - 2500 litres. Hours we run are 12 - 14 depending on logbook, but in the NT there are no logbooks and no restrictions. In WA you can run 16 with conditions.  The tri-drive Bulktrans KW had a Cummins KTA19, 19 litre engine. If you watch that  little vid you can see the crazy amount of weight it pulls.

They want you to wait for the Paso paperwork, in your truck that you unhook from and park five feet in front of your trailer.  You get ""written up for a safety violation"" of you roll on green.   This is insane.  They've doubled the chances of a disaster by having drivers do two different things but not having their people operate safely.

After reading posts like this, and others, in forums elsewhere I took a little bit of smug sastifaction from my job.  Most caught on to the program really fast. I would text, or phone the shipping department, and they would get a dock for me ASAP. There were some ups and downs, but a month into it, I could get 20 pallets loaded on my truck faster then I could get a coffee from the Mc d's in the front.   Except 1 of the 30 stores I delt with. That one, decided I was just some idiot in a truck they could treat with utter contempt. And not just me, 300 miles away I would hear people complaining about that very same walmart. The coke drivers, pepsi, the egg guy, dairy, the bread guy... they all got screwed at that Walmart.  Not me. I bumped the dock, got a coffee, and if they hadn't started loading billed them and drove off. Or if they tried, I refused pallets... this this and this, off my truck it's not good enough. Those pallets were truly terrible, and I had a right to refuse them, but I only did at that walmart, because that was the only place that treated me with utter contempt.  I left the job a while ago, but as of 2 weeks ago, there is currently 120 pallets outside awaiting pick up. So if it helps, I screwed them as hard as I could because of their arrogent attitude"

There are signs at least a couple blocks back telling you that you're not going to make that bridge. All you gotta do is get in the left lane and take the other bridge across the river.

Trucking,3br2q9,MKGSticks,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"I don't actually drive trucks, I write software for drivers & dispatchers to use, but my understanding is that there are signs for all bridges saying how high they are, and drivers are supposed to know how tall their trucks are.  In places where bridges are especially low, or if the road makes a U-shape that causes the truck to be higher off the ground, therefore increasing its effective height, or for bridges that get hit a lot, there are extra warning lights & signs, and sometimes even an extra bar that the truck has to pass below before it gets to the bridge.  It doesn't always work though - I once drove by a truck stuck under a railway bridge in Montreal that had all kinds of extra lights and warnings. It was a smaller truck - maybe a rental that the driver wasn't used to driving."

Example...I know I'm getting loaded at 6am, I arrive and park near the gate at midnight, go to sleeper berth, creep in at less than 15mph at 6am so I don't trigger drive mode, do my load/unload and say it takes three hours.

That said, they seem to get more hate than Schneider which is in the ballpark for size and does train newbies.   The best is the one that is the best fit for you. Trucking companies are in the same business and do a lot of things the same, it's the things they do differently that make them a better fit for a driver. For example, rider policy, pet policy, types of insurance offered, cost of insurance offered, mileage calculation, cpm, average miles a week, solo or team driving, type of cargo: reefer, dry van, tanker,  flatbed, etc....  The one thing everyone agrees on is, C.R. England is the company of last resort. If you can't afford to pay for your CDL and CRE is the only company that will take you, maybe, just maybe go there. A lot of drivers and commentators will say, ""do something else if CRE is your only choice."" Of course, this is all opinion.   Be aware that a company sponsored CDL program is a year long (or whatever the length of the contract is) job interview. Every step of the way the company is evaluating you. Many will send you home during the initial classroom stages if your late to class even once.   If you're interested in a company sponsored CDL, this site has a lot of information. Schneider, and Prime are seen as having good programs, and FFE's school gets a lot of positive feedback. Remember, the folks that are negative are the ones that couldn't cut it as drivers.   YMMV, all opinions are opinions so you'll need to find out what suits you and you alone. There are folks that have gone to CRE, put their time in, had no accidents, dodged the lease program and moved on to better things. They did so because they had the grit to be a driver."

Trucking,3br20k,adventure_dog,0,Wed Jul 1 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"That would have been a nice article to find.   Once the truck completely shuts down and the Quallcom powers down the only location that'll pop up on the computer is the last location that the dispatcher pinged. Although some systems are different and will continuously track the truck.  My guess would be that when the dispatcher couldn't locate the truck by pinging it. The dispatchers next step is to call the driver without a response from the missing driver the truck would be reported stolen.  If they have a lot of trucks sitting idle on their property with no one taking inventory at least once a week, the truck could go unnoticed for weeks. I know when I was at Prime they had excess trucks on their property and they'd be covered in snow untouched for the whole winter season.  I do think there is some truth to that story but they're only going to put so much effort into finding someone, which is going to result in pinging the truck, calling the driver, reporting the truck stolen, and sending someone to the last known location of the truck. Fault still falls on Swift because it was on their property.  Then there's this where a driver passed away in his truck in December and wasn't found until the end of March. I found a bunch of other articles so I think we can assume it happens every so often."

On the flip side, I did hear horror stories from people who got shipped off to Kansas city for road training, and those guys apparently didn't teach much of anything.   They told us very early in Millington that this was an accelerated course and they didn't have time to hold everybody's hand.

Trucking,3bq297,DocAuch,15,Wed Jul 1 05:59:23 2015 UTC,"I have great luck using my Qualcomm to navigate to the shipper/stop/consignee. I use my personal GPS to do enroute stops like fuel, shift change, piss breaks. Often times when one GPS unit screws up the other gives me a quick sanity check.   Running two units allows on the fly trip planning or alteration. Otherwise your driving blind or have to pull over.  Plus my personal GPS calculates routing way faster than the Qualcomm. Most companies won't pay their navigation provider for added software features like truck only routing, truck only parking, weigh station warnings, curve warnings, speed warnings, and local business addresses/POI.   Above all I use the companies fuel stop guide and a large format Rand McNally atlas.   On a decent account my partner and I average 4800 to 6200 miles weekly which translates to about 820-1010$ net checks (after deductions/taxes). It's a Conway account.   I'll say this and many people will complain: Invest in a 7"" screen GPS unit and a Large format atlas. I prefer Rand McNally products personally. It's a hard job. These tools make it less hard.   I chose the Rand McNally 750 LM 7"" screen. It's not perfect but it beats the crappy 100-250$ models/makes. It'll set you back about 450$ everything out the door. But! You recoup that cost over time by reducing missed turns, enhanced fuel savings, less fatigue, and audio/visual warnings. All that means it's helping to either make you money or save you money. It took me three weeks for that machine to pay for itself and then some.   The jobs hard. It gets harder the longer you're out on the road. Most people do 3-6 weeks out then home time. We do 8 weeks. Over time it wears on you. Sitting for untold hours, boredom separated by moments of shear terror, then boredom. Lack of sleep. Even sleeping long you'll soon notice you're not sleeping well. That adds up over time until you're just fatigued even after 10 hours of sleeper berth.   I find that after a shift I'll take a non addictive sleep aid and some hot sleepy time tea. After that and one cigarette I'm ready to hit the hay. Drink tons of water and have emergency pee bottles. Keep your area and bottles clean/sanitized.   Basic rule of thumb: piss breaks shouldn't be longer than 6 minutes. The less you pull over the better.   Basic new guy math: 60 mph is a mile a minute. Plan your trips using the 50-55 mph rule. Then do 60-65 mph (or more in a non company truck). For every minute you're stopped expect to lose on average two minutes. 6 minute pee break? You lost 10-15 minutes on your overall trip time. It's not accurate mathematics but it's close enough for new drivers to remember and plan accordingly. It works.   Also: in the beginning: if you can do 350-400 miles a day with no accidents, violations, or tickets, you did a fucking awesome job. Don't let some old salty fucker make you feel shitty or worthless.   Also: be aware your trainer is most likely pulling in 800-1500$ weekly or more while training you. Mine was making 2200-3500$ weekly. Make that fucker earn their pay and teach you. Backing. Navigation. Life style on the road. Budgeting. Family issues. Company policy. All of it. I went through 3 trainers where all they wanted was to strap my ignorant ass to that drivers seat and get free pay without work. A lot of trainers do.   You gotta be the new guy/girl. You gotta learn and pay your dues. But that doesn't mean let some lazy dirty SOB use you to pump miles and get a quick pay boost. Stand up for yourself if you feel used.   ABOVE ALL:  SAFETY FIRST!!!!!! If anything you or your trainer does compromises your safe operation of that vehicle you stop. Don't ever feel pressured to do anything unsafe. That means even you pressuring yourself.   Speed comes with practice and time. Running smoothly is always faster than just speed shifting and driving like a bat out of hell. Smooth equals efficiency which lowers your times, raises your miles, reduces accidents/problems, and protects you, the truck, and the cargo."
Trucking,3bq297,Bounty66,5,Wed Jul 1 09:10:10 2015 UTC,"Well said. All great advice.   My two cents, I balked at the cost of a truck GPS, so when I started out, I used a combination of Rand McNally atlas, Google Maps, and ALK Copilot Truck GPS for Android.   Study your maps! I probably spent at least 30 minutes per day just on route planning for the first 6 month or so of driving. After that, I was familiar with most of the major interstates east of and including I-35. Of course I would double check local routing when I was going somewhere new.   Know where you're going BEFORE you get on the highway. Memorize your intestate interchanges and relevant cities. Don't depend on that damn GPS to wake you up!"
Trucking,3bq297,NotJohnCalvin,2,Wed Jul 1 09:58:19 2015 UTC,"Is ALK worth the money? I've been planning on buying a truck gps, but I'm worried that if it's not good enough I'll have basically thrown $120 in the trash and have to buy an actual unit.   Also, how data reliant is it? I'm on T-Mobile, so signal isn't always usable."
Trucking,3bq297,TCBloo,2,Wed Jul 1 14:05:12 2015 UTC,"You can download map packs for offline access.   I used it back in 2010-2011, it was adequate at that time. I only used it for routing / navigation / turn approaches. I never really used points of interest or anything, so I have no idea how thorough their database is.   That being said, I use the current version of the software, but NOT the truck-specific version, to get a quick ETA to destination. I go to the same places every week, so I already know the route. The biggest complaint I have with the software is that, as far as I know, they don't have speed limits in their map database. You have to manually set the speed limit based on the type of road (interstate / highway / local). This in turn can result in non-optimal routing when, for example, you have state routes that are divided, high-speed highways or Texas two-lane roads with 65 mph speed limits. You get the idea."

Trucking,3bq297,TCBloo,0,Wed Jul 1 17:39:51 2015 UTC,"This is true!!!! Always study!!!! Look for bridge law, restricted routes, and low clearance!!!! Study, set navigation, pay attention.   I might favor the Rand McNally products but to be honest I have several apps for IPhone/iPad. Everyone has their favorite program, tool, brand of doing things.   The idea is have as many different resources as you can afford to navigate. Google maps. Map quest. Trucker path. Rand maps. Personal GPS. Company GPS. Evernote. And the holy grail; your large format atlas with trucking indexes.   The only two other recommendations I could make is:   Ice less 40 qt cooler (to include 1-3 3way powers splitter/ports). It is a luxury. But it opens up the possibility of saving food and shopping at Walmart. I paid 140$ with tax included. Other people hit up the sales or save fuel points. I got the Coleman brand.  A hands free blue tooth headset. Blue Tiger is good (my partner has this and it's actually more comfortable than my Blue Parrot). Blue parrot (mine) is awesome too. Plan to buy a cell phone/smart phone holder as fumbling with your phone defeats the hands free headset safety feature. And opens you up to a 2500-3000$ ticket. I chose the 320 LX and spent 135.00$.  I'm not saying be like me and buy all this stuff at once. I set it up as a reward system for busting my butt. If I worked hard and met my personal goals I bought. If I didn't meet goals I waited.   For most new drivers I'd recommend using your fuel points, wait for a sale, then buy. I see buying tools differently than most drivers as I was a mechanic in previous jobs. I need a tool, I analyze when and how, I plan tool purchase. My goal right now is not to save maximum money. It will be. But not now as I have little problem investing in tooling/supplies."

I've been at it for three years and use a Rand McNally 720m. It's great for highway routes, interchanges, etc.  City streets can be a problem. You've got to keep your head up, look for signs, confirm you can clear the turn well before executing it. Leave yourself an out.  And do all that while driving the thing...

I watched him for a bit trying to see what the hell he was doing, and when he got to about two trucks behind me, working his way up closer, I got the hell out of there to avoid a ticket. Got on CB and told people to stay the hell away from that rest area (probably 30 or 40 trucks were already parked on all the curbs and any other unmarked space they could fit, so that asshole probably made bank off a bunch of sleepy drivers)  Ended up driving the rest of the way to San Antonio to a drop yard we have there with plenty of parking while over my 14. 35 in Texas just really sucks if you find yourself anywhere between Waco and San Antonio after 5pm on a weekday."

I work in diesel truck parts, in a somewhat mountainous area and our customer base is oil field/natural gas/fracking/hotshot/heavy equipment towing. I have seen a lot of RTLO18918 and RTLO16713s over the years. I don't know how much you know about parts but your first two numbers are your torque, the middle number is the engineering level, and of course your last two numbers are your speed, in this case a 10 speed. The ""B"" is your gear set ratio. How old is the truck? Is that the original tranny? Is an RTO16910B the one that comes up when the VIN is looked up? I ask these questions because I have seen cases where a different tranny was put in at some point in the history of the truck and when the salesman sold the customer one based on the VIN the torque or engineering level was not like for like and resulted in a $1000 ""hit"" on the core. Our shop was replacing a tranny once and ordered the new tranny based on either VIN or part numbers and once they got in there they discovered that the clutch and input shaft were all wrong. I think they were going off of BOM. It resulted in an extra five days of down time for the truck and driver. Eaton is a great brand. But you have to research this based on your needs and also find out as much as you can about that truck and the tranny."

My first year driving I made around $15 k with england.   If the company is advertising $40 k your first year don't expect that, that number comes from doing 3 k miles every week which won't happen. Realistically expect $25 to $35 for your first year in a training company.  If you're going into reefer expect to sit around and wait a lot, if y9u end up in a bad area for loads line Florida expect to wait for a load. There's a lot of waiting.

They just want to be treated nice and will do the same most of the time. I have owned a brand new shiny truck and I have driven a single bunk binder with spring ride. Did I get treated better in the new one? Nope, not a single fuck was given. If I was nice to the person, I was treated nice. If I got mad, it was fuck you too.

CA EPA bs says we can't have that stuff shooting into the air or the homeless horny horned butt toed blue jay will become extinct...

Most of my company's newer trucks have the underside exhaust pipe, and I often wonder if those make the air even more hazardous for sleeping drivers in truckstops when everyone's idling since the exhaust is coming out at a lower level."
Trucking,3bl90y,Startide,3,Tue Jun 30 11:16:54 2015 UTC,My personal opinion is yes. It emits the ''harmful'' odors at ground level which rise up through the bottom of the truck at a stop. I would rather have stacks.
Trucking,3bl90y,06Wrangler,3,Tue Jun 30 23:48:40 2015 UTC,My understanding has always been that the grass burners are more aerodynamic and that's the only reason for them. It makes this all the more baffling.

Trucking,3bl90y,wiretapp,3,Tue Jun 30 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"That actually has to do with it though not quite in the way you're saying.   Let's say you're driving a DD15. 14.8 L displacement. Now, not even accounting for the turbocharger, at STP and a cruising RPM of 1350, you're pumping out 705 cubic feet per minute of exhaust gasses. Even without side mounted stacks, a vertical exhaust really fucks with your laminar flow and kills mileage.   That being said I'd much rather have one than a grass burner."
Trucking,3bl90y,kellanium,3,Tue Jun 30 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"Your math is flawed.  Remember that its a 4 stroke engine.  So it has to do 2 revolutions for each detonation. So taking that into consideration 350CFM is a better estimation.  (assuming incoming air is at STP)  When hydrocarbons burn they release energy in the form of heat.  So exhaust will not be at STP.  Now im not a engineer nor a chemist nor a physicist.  Ive sat here for a while and tried to ponder how effectively estimate the amount of exhaust gasses that will be expelled and it is way over my head.  I do not know how much exhaust is created when you burn a hydrocarbon.  I do not know how efficent a diesel engne is (how much heat is tuned into mechanical energy).  There are just to many varaiables to caculate how much exhaust is actually produced.    The solution that I came up with is how much air is being brought into a non-turbocharged engine, not the volume of exhaust."
Trucking,3bl90y,netdigger,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"Shit, you're right.   Though since the EGT of a diesel is ~650 F i think it's safe to say that it'll still be a large volume.  The point I'm making, though, is that the exhaust itself, not just the pipe, interferes with the aerodynamics of the truck. So does a lot of things you'd never even think of, vibration, rivets on the trailer, the size of the gap between your cab and trailer. All of these things affect fuel mileage. It's kinda mind-boggling."

Even if they wave you thru, you still need to stop and get it.  You should already have a DOT #, you don't need a truck for that.  (in fact you can do ti online).     I'm pretty sure you need logs.  I'd do it anyway.  Easier to do them and not need them, then to need them and not have them.    BTW, it might be cheaper to have it transported."

My dad rolled into one or the other of these back about 7-8 years ago in the middle of the day, waiting to pick up a load the next day. About 9:00 that night, he heard a bunch of commotion and opened his sleeper curtain to peek out.   What he saw, near the entrance was a stepdeck and an Allied truck parked next to each other. The stepdeck was in the spot nearest the entrance. The guys in the Allied truck had pulled out the customer's couch, coffee table and grill and were facing towards the stepdeck and entrance, drinking beer and grilling burgers. On the stepdeck, was the driver of the stepdeck in a pink nightie with nothing on under it dancing with two presumed lot lizards. Now, they also had music blaring from somewhere and the stepdeck had all his OSOD lights out on the deck and turned on. They also flashed each truck that pulled into the lot (Including the stepdeck driver) and jeered if they didn't blow their horn  If that's not a party, I don't know what is."

Trucking,3blb7l,Primus42,3,Tue Jun 30 03:41:33 2015 UTC,"Let me tell you my story......I said I would never do otr either when I got my CDL. So the only local company that would give me a job was a beer distributor. I was only 22 years old at the time, so I thought ""oh what the heck, I can handle a little physical work"". Did it for about 2 years and did permanent damage to my knees and back. So I went to haul gravel locally, more damage to the back driving spring ride old trucks. So after about 3 years of local experience and only making about 25,000/year, still nobody would hire me. (Not any decent company anyway). Finally bit the bullet and went otr for a little while. Boy did I learn a lot! Things I never had to deal with locally, but funny thing is, I am better able to deal with a lot of things that I come across now that I am local again. I only did actual otr (48 states) for a few months, then went regional for a couple of years. Now I am in with a good paying local job, home every night and weekends and holidays off. I would not have been hired by my current employer without that otr experience. So sometimes you have to just bite the bullet and deal with it for a little bit, it's worth it.  Anyway, that's my story, maybe you can get into something local right out of school, if so, that's great. I am glad I got that otr experience, I think it makes me better at my job and I wouldn't trade it for anything. Edit: spelling"
Trucking,3blb7l,floydguitarist,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:18:48 2015 UTC,"Take anything you can get. Most local routs will want an experienced driver so they don't have to train you. Remember that cdl school only teaches you to pass a state test. The real teaching begins at your first job.  Take anything you can get because a year down the road, you become a lot more valuable to companies.  In the end you might have to bite the bullet and go otr for a year.

Happens several times a month around White Plains, and I have heard that even without an accident, commercial vehicles on the parkways run the risk of getting $5,000 fines. I don't even want to know how much they fined the Sheaffer trucker who scalped himself under a Metro North (commuter rail) overpass a few months ago, requiring at least three agencies to inspect the tracks....  Also, yes, NY roads suck. Potholes and road quailty in metro NYC are the worst of any area I have seen in the country, outside of insanely rural areas."

Trucking,3bjveb,BarkingLeopard,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:16:49 2015 UTC,"Not sure what aspen inspection receipt is, but that is what I figured. I also assume that any trucker who hits an overpass will pretty much be out of a career as soon as his company hears about it.  I am sure that NYC and Westchester must be like boot camp for bridge inspectors to hone their post collision inspection skills. Guessing things are somewhat routine and relatively quick as often as that stuff happens."
Trucking,3bjveb,BarkingLeopard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:28:14 2015 UTC,"DOT bridge inspectors in NYC are particularly harsh, we had an incident about 2 weeks ago a drive struck an overpass so hard and fast it caused the truck to change lanes and hit another vehicle(parkway in NY no CMV's). In the process he destroyed bridge, guardrail and signs. That goes on the accident report as public property damaged and the company will be getting a bill from DOT. Plus the bill from the heavy duty tow companies to get his trailer unstuck from the bridge, it's a very expensive day to hit a bridge in NY."
Trucking,3bjveb,BarkingLeopard,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:24:02 2015 UTC,"Fudge. The company deserves the bill, though I wonder what happens if they refuse to pay- will their trucks get flagged at a weigh station and denied entry to to state of NY until the company pays?   I know it is an easy mistake to make (my parents drove a RV on a CT parkway once, and had to back up through a red light once they saw the clearances getting tight, though the cop was cool, didn't give a ticket, and the only cost & damage was $300 in trim damage to the RV as it scraped a guard rail), but I don't see why companies do not pound it in to every rookie's head, with a reminder on the QC on every load to the Northeast: You cannot take a truck on a parkway in the Northeast.

There are some big car lots around the Jersey City ports, for I want to say VWs and a few other brands, but I know you don't deal with such plebian brands, and I haven't seen the lots for the super luxury ones you deal with, as I presume they are in under a roof. Guessing there are a few guys who do almost nothing but deliveries from the NJ ports to the Greenwich & Fairfield County area dealerships, as one 3-block strip in Greenwich has almost every ultra luxury brand you can think of, including $300k cars in the front lots with no fences, which anyone can touch."

I had zero issues with the automatic in the 2 years I was with it (besides having to let your tanks build up psi after rig sat for extended period so it can get the air it needs to work properly).  People bring up winter weather and grades but the reality is those automatics can be turned into manual with a flick of a switch and now insted of shifting you simply hit a button and it remains in whatever gear you select and you float down that hill at a nice safe pace."

My experience with them is that they suck on grades in bad weather even worse when you put chains on. They'll slip as slide where a manual won't and backing up sucks as they'll find a way to slam into the dock. I also wouldn't recommend them for dirt road driving.  They seem made for places like California, Florida or anywhere that doesn't see a lot of bad weather, then if you get one that isn't maintained properly it shifts like it was your first time all over again. The only automatic that I've liked so far had a selector for automatic and manual as the auto side of it was so screwed up that I couldn't get it going unless I started in manual."

Trucking,3bgqed,smaagi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:04:17 2015 UTC,"Here are the biggest difficulties with a auto semi.   It is hard to hook trailers because the trans will not engage until you raise the rpm,  so you can either hit the trailer hard, or try to time it right to get the trucks momentum to latch the pin.  When the transmission has a failure you will be stuck in neutral. The work truck I had did this 3 times in a week and required a tow each time.  There is no way to get it in a gear to get it off the road."
Trucking,3bgqed,sledge07,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:08:17 2015 UTC,"I just tap my throttle and the truck happily creeps itself under the trailer. If it gets stuck before it hooks, it just beeps. I pull forward a bit, drop the bags, creep on under.  Heavy trailer and need a little more? I feather the throttle and she sliiiides right under. Since the clutch is already engaged, it doesnt lurch."
Trucking,3bgqed,maymay666,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:28:16 2015 UTC,"LPT: A good way to prevent lurching is also to apply light pressure to the brakes and the throttle at the same time, ""load up"" like you would an auto car at the drag strip and then drive it with the brakes.

Absolute gold for backing exercise though. I know ETS 2 has a backing challenge add on thing and is awesome. I definitely recommend it for that. But pay attention how the trailer reacts to your inputs. Try using the cab camera and the mirrors in game to watch how the trailer reacts. Think of using other camera angle as your GOAL (Get Out And Look) method.  Actual driving? Nothing replaces real world experience. Same goes for backing, but if you've got backing basics down in your mind, then that's one less bit of stress come Skills test day."

Trucking,3bdjm2,Pooborg,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:01:04 2015 UTC,"ABS doesn't attempt to do something I do already.  ABS comes on only when I command the brakes to apply.  I don't like the brakes to go on when I don't tell them because I cannot anticipate it.   This happens in a lot of systems. ESPECIALLY with safety systems. The operator expects the system to act one way, and the system acts another way, causing the operator to over-react, resulting in an accident.  It's called ""normal accident theory""."
Trucking,3bdjm2,kellanium,0,Sun Jun 28 21:32:26 2015 UTC,"The point is not to replace driver input, it's in case the driver does not react.   You're probably right though, let's make sure this doesn't get implemented, and the truck can just plow through the car."
Trucking,3bdjm2,sellursoul,2,Sun Jun 28 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"Back in the 90s, the Federal Aviation Administration implemented a system called TCAS. That stands for Traffic Collision Avoidance System. Essentially the computer monitored the flightpaths of aircraft and yelled a warning if the paths intersected.   This resulted in a net increase in collision near-misses. Because the system could not anticipate the actions of the human operator and the human operator could not receive the workings of the computer, it resulted in human pilots flying far too close to each other.   You cannot design a system to act autonomously and also in conjunction with a human being. Not without a much more tightly integrated human-machine interaction.

Trucking,3bbqab,eog_prod,5,Sat Jun 27 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of RVs are running on marginal tires.  They usually get few miles, but age out the tire date codes.    In addition there's a good chance they may be overloaded and/or underinflated.  Most RVs can blow their weight rating with just a few passengers and some water in the freshwater tank, let alone storing stuff in the basement.  Unfortunately they don't get checked at scales."

Having said that, I have one HUGE caution for GPS users - myself included. If you miss a turn and end up in an out of route situation, your GPS will start doing goofy shit to get you back on route immediately. It will attempt to send you down roads that not only are you not supposed to be on (clearly marked ""no trucks""), but roads where it's pretty much impossible to get on. I've seen it with both Garmin and Rand McNally truck GPS units. Do not trust your GPS unit in an out of route situation. It may work out fine, but it also may bite you in the ass. My suggestion from my experience with these units is to get yourself to a place where it's fine for trucks to be and reprogram your destination from there."
Trucking,3bat47,vanishing_point,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:31:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Using a GPS does not give license to just drop all common sense. There is a learning curve, and there are also clues to the street which you are about to turn on like ""it's too goddamned narrow for a truck don't turn there"" which a lot of drivers seem to not have or simply ignore."

They're nomex and kidskin, form fitting, and tough.  Unfortunately they're really long so unless you keep them cuffed they can be a pain to get on and off, but they're great for detail work while keeping the palm side of your hand protected.  Underarmor made a flight-approved glove, I think it was called Snakeskin or had snakesomething in the name.  I was given a pair by one of my pilots after doing some engine work in the snow stripped down to a t-shirt so I could fit my hand and wrist in a tiny spot in a Kiowa engine compartment and losing some fingertip skin to a frozen oil line.  They get real ugly after awhile, but until I lost them in a move they hadn't started functionally degrading after 4 years of being soaked in POL and diesel, being used at ranges, getting poked with lockwire, and handling piping hot parts and whatnot.  Also good for yardwork.  so go to an army surplus store, or if that's too big an ask head to wal-mart and get the solid leather gardening gloves."

I hope they cover you on rental car but I wouldn't hold my breath on that, unless you can work it out to take it out of your 1st weeks withheld pay or something. The biggest thing to worry about now is finding another company to take you, you'll find one but might be slim pickings, depending on what Werner puts on your report. A friend of mine got fired for the reason he side swiped a car, minor damage but they didn't fire him for that alone, he was constantly giving dispatch a hard time, staying home longer than supposed to and late a lot. The side swipe for him was just the final straw. He ended up working for a small company for a while that treated him like dirt, now he's with what seems a good company.

I went to university to get out of trucking and I'm actually a substitute teacher with two degrees but I mostly truck because of the steady income and the rate of pay. - we aren't all stupid truckers - a lot of people think we are.  I also farm 300 acres cash crop and I've started my own side business. Honestly organizing sounds good in theory but realistically most trucking companies make very little money and most years they barely break even, especially the middle size company with lots of overhead and rates being cut every month. If drivers all of a sudden got paid even 15% more you'd see a lot of unemployed drivers and closed businesses. There is some need for pay increase and comfort bonuses like paid hotels a couple times a month, new microwave, tv, dvd's, cell phone plans etc.. I don't have it bad, actually pretty good as I spend about 3 nights a week in the rig and only work 4 days a week and get paid more than a lot of other guys. some guys are gone for a month at a time just to make ends meet.

Trucking,3b01f9,KingOfSpeedSR71,4,Thu Jun 25 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"Advantages: they are more reliable than electric start as long as you maintain them, less drain on the electrical system so alternators, batteries last longer, simpler wiring, they spin the engine at a million miles an hour so easier starting. If you run out of air, every tyre on the rig is a spare air reservoir unlike if you have a flat battery you are stuffed, the starter motor is very light compared to electric. You can scare the crap out of anyone you don't like.  Disadvantages: they use a separate air tank which is isolated from the main system, but can run out of air if you don't maintain them. They are expensive, but they are still an option on new KWs in Australia. They scare the crap out of people if you aren't careful."

Trucking,3axdz7,Sooper_trooker,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:55:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  It's a great concept,   I'd like to see her present a list of appliances, utensils, and ingredients to bring... and then prepare food using nothing but those items, in the space afforded in a sleepercab, without using amenities unavailable in a sleepercab (such as running water).   I've found living in a truck to be very similar to camping, and thus far the sophistication of the food I've prepared reflects that."
Trucking,3axdz7,00stephen,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:14:48 2015 UTC,Actually  I do use water bottles  and things on my rig. There will  be  more videos  released  by my producer. We tried  filming  in the rig bit the lighting was not right and it is to crowded for a production  crew to get in the sleeper and cab. Also  with a 2000 watt inverter  you can use the NuWave  products  on your  rig. There are episodes  that haven't  been  released  yet that fulfill everything you ask for and I so you how and what you  will need to do it with.

If you have a skylight cover it or get reflective window film to put over it.

Trucking,3aq4y8,er1catwork,5,Mon Jun 22 16:30:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly starting off you'll most likely end up at a mega carrier that receive talks shit about. Put in 6months to a year then either stay or look for something smaller. It's rare but not completely impossible to get on with a smaller company with no experience. Most mega carriers ( swift, Crete, Schreinder, Stevens) will have a contract to get your school paid off. Most people will talk bad about them. Don't worry about what people say. Worry about what's a good fit for you.  RESEARCH RESEARCH RESEARCH"
Trucking,3aq4y8,i_forgot_my_sn_again,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:12:48 2015 UTC,"No tuition reimbursement at Crete. They only accept students from select schools, ortherwise they will take you with 6 months experience if you're willing to go out with a trainer again, they aren't in the same ballpark as Swift, Schneider, Stevens or most other mega carriers."
Trucking,3aq4y8,cr-cr,2,Mon Jun 22 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"First, research trucking schools and see what their payment options are. You may even be eligible for government grants. This will start your journey towards a CDL.   So where to work?   You're first company is going to be either horrible or not that bad. Great isn't an option yet. I've heard nothing good about CR England from lurking here. After a few months of being on the road at your first company (Werner, CR England, Stevens, Prime, Swift, etc) start planning your next step.   Do you want hazmat? Flatbed? Autos? Heavy Equipment? Call up companies, see what they offer, and ask what they desire in new hires. Employment in the trucking industry is extremely fluid, and there is nothing wrong with bettering yourself to move up in responsibilities and pay.   Be wary of recruiters and other drivers trying to earn a recruitment bonus. Silver tongues will try to convince you of whatever you want to hear to get you to sign on.   Most importantly: For the love of God, don't lease and don't owner operate (O/O). I hear VERY few positive leasing stories. O/O is ok, IF you have the experience to be your own business. You have to drive, pay the fuel, pay your taxes, pay the insurance, find loads, and repair the truck. Turbo blows out your engine? That's going to cost thousands while your income goes to zero. Being a successful O/O requires a head for running your business, being mechanically inclined enough to save on repairs and get the truck running ASAP, cash reserves to pay for large repairs and downtime, and staying motivated without a boss to tell you what to do."

If you are on the road and away from home 300 days a year you should at least save all that sweet sweet employment tax. Once you retire after 30 years of no employment tax saving that ~ 8% then you can move to a state that has an employment tax but no sales tax. Or just do what I do and live in Vancouver WA I save all the employment tax and Oregon is 10min away which is a no sales tax state. Best of both worlds."

Most insurance carriers available to small outfits (you mentioned 2 trucks) will require a minimum of 2 years' experience. Progressive will write recent CDL graduates but the insurance will be 2-4x more expensive and usually makes it cost-prohibitive. It would be good to spend the 5 minutes now to find out if it's a legitimate option before you invest the time and money into getting your license.

Trucking,3an0ew,kellanium,11,Sun Jun 21 21:37:45 2015 UTC,"Lesbian trucker chick here!  You'll find that trucking is VERY egalitarian in the way everyone treats you.  If you can get the job done, people respect you. Be prepared for the occasional catcall/creepy old man. When you come across them, call them out and make a big scene of it. There's a lot of decent folk out there.   I've found that most folks don't care about sexuality. I simply great it as a non issue. I don't hide that I'm gay, but at the same time, I don't make a super big deal of it. Not that I think the latter would be a bad idea, it's just not my style.   As for big truck/little truck: I started out driving buses, and there's about as much in common with a straight truck and a semi as a subway and a smart car."

As you're well aware, living in this area is one of the more accepting places for the lbgt community in the country.   Trucking attracts all walks of life. You'll run into all kinds, so as long as you're courteous then they should have no reason to give you any flack.  I think the most common thing you'll get is people not thinking you're a driver. It's simply uncommon to see women driving truck, so unless they see you get in/out of it they may assume you're at your stop for some other reason."

And even those, I have to arrive to the location a day early and take a 10-hour before I go in, or else my 14 would end before they've even touched the load. One time I even spent five days at a receiver. Got $200 that week more than I normally do.

Trucking,3alacj,TheT0KER,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:40:47 2015 UTC,"I wanted to follow up with a better comment, I've been busy with my dad all day. He's done a variety of trucking since he started it. He began his trucking career in an old RD Mack tenwheeler, then moved on to a job hauling coal in an R model Mack to Ashland or Cincinatti, then running sand or gravel back down here for more coal. When him and my mom got married he was late to the wedding because the guy he worked for took him to buy a brand new Western Star, after that guy quit trucking he drove a 369 for a few years before getting in business with the owner of the W900L in the mid 90s. His first truck with him was a blue W900B with a four and a quarter Cat motor in it.  He's had a pretty interesting trucking career and spent a lot of time in one specific truck which is something I haven't seen a lot of drivers do that. He's also a unique case since he was the head mechanic and handled all the upkeep on the four trucks. Most drivers barely know how to change a spare while he's welded frames and trailers, as well as handled all the wiring of lights, and all the other maintenance ( that's such a weird word to spell). Which is why he never bothered to buy the trucks from his boss even though his boss wanted him to, there just wasn't enough money left in coal to warrant buying extremely heavy dual frame trucks. The current company he drives for won't even replace his motor mounts so he told them when the engine falls down on the axle it's their  baby to get it off the job that he's tired of telling them.He's been looking for other jobs that keep him mostly local and has a spot in a lineman class once he gets laid off from his current boss.  On top of the guy not taking care of his trucks the hauls pay very little and their up for bid again in November so they're going to be bid even lower. He's mad about making less money than he has in 22 years as is, so he's looking to step out to other forms of work or trucking."

You won't really learn anything until you get out on the road for real.  Don't worry about it.  Just go slow.  The douche in that BMW can wait.  The first bit is just learning to pass thr CDL test.  You won't really learn anything.  When you're practicing parking maneuvers, do it how they tell you.    When you get behind the wheel in school and especially for the state test, STAY CALM.  More people fail due to anxiety than anything else.   Double clutching is wierd at first.  Don't worry about it.  You'll be floating gears the day you hit the road for real.  When the instructor tells you that you barely need to push in the clutch, he means it.  Try using just enough to get the truck out of gear.  GO SLOW.  Trucks are not racecars and the faster you try to accelerate, the more gears you will miss.    Don't get talked into a lease.   Remember this series of numbers:  3, 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, 45.  Each is a road speed corresponding to a pair of gears.  When you're slowing down and miss your gear, check your road speed and find the the one you should be in now.  Get out and look.  CB radio can be a godsend.  Everyone should have them.  Go slow.  Most England drivers leave after the 9 month contract is up.

I've heard of people doing full time recovery for them to avoid the lease.  Might be an option.  You'd be driving abandoned trucks back to SLC.  Best option is to not get on the bus to SLC and go with literally anyone else.  Find a company that doesn't force all new drivers into a lease.

If your trainer tries to get you to do anything illegal or unsafe get off that truck and report him. Obey traffic laws and Hours of Service as if it were the word of God.

Don't hit anything. Act like a civilized human being. Don't lease purchase. Finish the contract and move on. Learn good fuel island etiquette. Listen to something educational while you drive.

Trucking,3ak25o,rahtin,9,Sun Jun 21 00:09:31 2015 UTC,"It's a 1.25 to $1.50 per mile just to run (on average.  repairs, deprecations, insurance, taxesetc, etc, etc.)  So you need to take contracts that pay more than that just to make money.    Now,  you actually have to deliver on time and the chances are fewer with older trucks.  Sometimes stuff just breaks and sometimes stuff just wears out.   I'm not sure what B50 is anymore, but around 2008, they were saying that B50 was around 750,000 miles.  (B50 is when 50% of the engines are worn out and need to be replaced.  you might do better you might do worse).   Given the 2010 changes, the number has certainly gone down.     There's a reason the mega's get rid of tractors at the 500k mark.  They have thousands of tractors and running the numbers they obviously see it's cheaper to get rid of it than keep it running.   Think about the data they have at their fingertips and why they are getting rid of it.  BTW day cabs usually get beat to shit.  Figure day cabs are running city miles, shifting a million times a day, up and down, hot and cold.  Not running 500 miles in 10 hours but 100 to 200 miles a day.  HARD miles.  Trust me a day cab with 500,000 miles on it is beat to shit.    Every time your truck (or trailer) goes into the shop, it's AT LEAST a thousand bucks.  AT LEAST.   Do you have that kind of cash?   Cash is the big problem.  Also you are little guy, you get last place in line at the repair place and worst prices because you aren't local.  Even if it is your local shop, you have one (beat to shit) tractor, Joe's Trucking has 50.  who gets better service?     nothing ever fails when you aren't busy or on a nice weather day close to the shop.  Oh and plus 1000 to pre 2007, the newer emissions  a.  don't work very well b.  are expensive as fuck to fix.  and freightliners are NOTORIOUS for being rattletraps and eating coolant constantly.      Former O/O (technically private carrier, but costs are the same) who is right happy making bank driving someone else's truck.  ""hey, it's broken, come fix it, I'm getting a hotel room"""
Trucking,3ak25o,LoneCowboy,5,Sun Jun 21 00:25:08 2015 UTC,"All the more reason to be a mechanic, or at least have mechanical ability, and have somewhere undercover to work on the truck. Otherwise forget it imho."
Trucking,3ak25o,Ozdriver,8,Sun Jun 21 01:37:02 2015 UTC,"Three things kill an O/O (figuratively speaking)...a major mechanical failure, a bad crash, and bad bookwork. So you need mechanical skills, defensive driving, and you said you are OK with the paperwork.  I've been O/O for close to 35 years and that's my take on it, occasionally I'll do a trip as a company driver if things are quiet, so I've seen both sides of the fence."
Trucking,3ak25o,Ozdriver,6,Sun Jun 21 01:02:44 2015 UTC,"Buy a pre-2007 truck. Do yourself a huge favor. DPF (2007) and DEF systems (2010) are horribly expensive to fix, and break a lot."
Trucking,3ak25o,ohmygodbees,3,Sun Jun 21 00:09:00 2015 UTC,I'm new too. I've often thought about the profitability of running a used tractor. I think it makes more sense to do local stuff as you save yourself the hassle of ensuring you meet regulations in all states and provinces. I'd really like to hear from a normal person (not the guy driving overweight and running 3 logbooks) doing long haul that is making this work..
Trucking,3ak25o,mtrnka,3,Sat Jun 20 23:44:01 2015 UTC,"My company has a bunch of those +750k mile freightliners, they are constantly breaking down and in the shop, like every other day. A truck with that high of mileage , imo, isn't the best choice for someone to be a reliable business unless you have a full-truck shop thats able to work on your trucks almost daily (like what we have).  As to why not more O/O? Money."
Trucking,3ak25o,Copie247,2,Sun Jun 21 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"Your running costs will be heavily dependant on not only how you drive the truck, but what repairs/work you can do on it yourself, if you have a fair bit of mechanical knowledge already, then it can work out to be fairly cost effective. An older truck can be cost effective, provided you are over the top when it comes to preventative maintenance. I would budget an inchassis rebuild and mid life upon purchasing at a minimum though.   Your other big concern is work, specifically getting regular work that pays the bills, here in Aus general freight pays almost nothing simply because of the competition, US looks to be the same way."

Not terribly twisted, but just enough that the company said I couldn't run it with them anymore. I wouldn't have wanted to anyway, obviously, for safety reasons.  So I sold it at the same auction and recouped most of my money. Made great cash while I was running it, hauling produce. In fact, I was just about to take the wife to Hawaii when it broke down on me...which made its breaking that much more painful."

Trucking,3ajp8c,eog_prod,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:40:48 2015 UTC,Most likely you will still need to go to a driving school and put in your 160 hours before any company will hire you. Once you have your school time in don't expect to get hired by anyone other than megacarriers as they're insurance rates do not differ from hiring noobs. Most megcarrier jobs pay 30k-40k.

Trucking,3ah2nx,sledge07,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:52:11 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, grants are available.  If you do decide to go with a company sponsored program, you should know most big companies have them, and England pays the least of all of those.  $9.25/hr while driving with your trainer for the first month, 12 cents/mile for the first month after that, with a one cent raise every month until your 6 months of mandatory teaming is up.  After that, it's still only $0.20/mile unless you volunteer to be a trainer.   Then you get a whopping $0.30/mile.  If you still go to England, have them send you to Salt Lake.  They have rooms, a barbershop, lounge, decent food, showers/laundry for $2 (total for wash and dry), and a frickin golf course.  Their other schools have motels on the outskirts of town, a 25 min bus ride to the school each way, every day, and will be stuck ordering dominoes all the time.  Yes, I went to England.  I am actually enjoying my time on the road.  The pay sucks but my trainer is awesome.  Bring at least $5-600 to feed yourself for the month and a half it takes to start getting paid.  Go get a Love's rewards card now.  You get a free shower and coffee with every 50 gallons of fuel you put into the truck.  TA has rewards and slightly better showers, and most have sit down restaurants, but they will mail the card to your house."

Basically you tell them upfront, ya, we fucked up, its too heavy, can we have a grace?  They check and see if routes, and weather, etc allow, and will sell you one.  Its usually very low they let you have like 1-3% and the cost of the permit varies based on how much you are over.  The idea is to prepay the road destruction essentially.  Edit:  They also reserve the right to say no to an overweight permit.  Some times conditions just dont allow or they feel it should be on a bigger truck."

The space in front of the door wasn't big enough to park a truck straight at the dock, so no pull ups. You had to get into position (sort of) then angle back around until your trailer squared the dock and your tractor was at roughly a 45 degree angle to the whole mess.

Many of us just want to trundle down the road at the speed were capable of. Sometimes we have to pass each other and you're not losing much by waiting 90 seconds for it to happen. Going down a hill...? Let it ride or get out of the way. We get ONE good chance to build up momentum before climbing the next hill, Give us some room there. Is it tight in town where you live? Give us some room, don't look at us and our turn signal and run all the way up to the line, cause we know that you know that you blocked us. Dawdling in the lane next to us could get you killed. Tire blow out could break your next if that tread goes through your window (mythbusters can't remember which episode). Give us some room. Construction especially. Give us some room. Those lanes get Real tight.  There, have I said it enoigh? It takes a Toyota almost nothing to change course or speed. It takes a Schneider truck forever. And other trucks merely take a lifetime. Just get around us, quickly and efficiently so we can bring the new summer line to old navy for you. Were not nimble, fast or graceful.

Trucking,3aacv0,KingOfSpeedSR71,5,Fri Jun 19 00:31:26 2015 UTC,"There's these nifty lights along either side of the truck that sometimes flash. When they do, that means the vehicle is about to move in that direction. IT IS NOT ASKING FOR YOUR PERMISSION. 80,000 LBS IS CHANGING FUCKING COURSE.  Another often forgotten art is merging. See to pass your driver's test, you came across the situation to merge onto a highway or interstate. There are vehicles at speed on these roads already, so precaution and planning are your responsibility.  Merge into the flow of traffic, speed up or slow down as necessary but do not expect those already on the road to make an effort for you. They have the right of way. So when you ignore all of this and come blasting up the shoulder and cutting in front of 80,000 lbs barreling at 65+ mph, don't be surprised when the air horn gets a workout.  Truck drivers are humans too. We make mistakes or miss signs, etc. If you see a driver slowly moving in one lane with his signal on to make it into the lane to make a turn he almost missed, an upcoming exit or an officer/mechanic/breakdown on the shoulder, please be kind and give him space to get over. 9/10 you will promptly and enthusiasticly be thanked."

H.O.S. and FMCSA regulation represent a formal set of rules, created and dictated by politicians and lobbyists, meant to cater to certain businesses, support industries, and angry mother groups.  As trucking became more regulated, drivers became more concerned about how time is spent and logged than how their actions impact other drivers.  The resulting inconsideration is what happens when people aren't allowed to think and operate for themselves, and have to adhere to a framework sent down from authorities instead."

Trucking,3aa3yw,catonic,3,Sat Jun 20 18:09:06 2015 UTC,That is because most trucks are aligned to drive straight when in the right lane due to the crown in the road on the zipper. Front drive axle dead center. Rear drive axle .05% left and and steering axle .10% left. It works against you in the left lane because the road tilts to the left in that lane. This really sucks in Missouri because their roads have more left-lean in the left lane than other states. There is also almost always no shoulder in the left lane.

Pretty much when I do this it's because i don't need fuel. I either need the bathroom or the store, probably both. I don't want to take a parking spot because I don't intend on being there longer than 5 Maybe 10 minutes and some people are tired or waiting really need that parking spot and you already know what parking is like at truck stops.   If I waited in line like you suggest I could end up being there forever, because and this is no offense but guys who do wait in line feel entitled to take there sweet ass time. I have watched guys take there 30 minute breaks at fuel pumps, cook dinners, showers etc etc and I am trapped at the fuel pump.  I have no regrets and will continue to do this practice. I am not trying to be rude to others in the parking lot and I am pretty quick normally i can get in and out before you are done fueling and cleaning your windows  then I can back out pull a U turn and I am outta there.

There's a concrete plant just like 4 miles away, do you think those guys were getting hourly wages, paid by the trip, or what?"

Mo' wipes, mo' better.   *The most comfortable bedding your budget can take and a mattress topper of some sort; memory foam, egg carton, down, something... If you ever end up in a previously used truck, depending on the habits and hygiene of the driver before you, you might not want to sleep directly on the mattress.   *a home made porta-potty: it's gross and weird, but I used to use a coffee can with a leak proof zip-loc bag. You just sorta put the bag in the can and fold the outside around the rim of the can. If it might be awhile before you can dispose of the bag, a few drops of formaldehyde (RV toilet tank treatment; Walmart & lots of Flying J's have it) will keep it from stinking up the truck.  *foods with long shelf lives that can withstand big temperature & elevation changes. Like the other guy said, granola, fig newtons, etc.  *a winter emergency kit; long life food or non-perishables that COULD eat but won't eat unless you're really starving. Bottled water. Some unscented candles in jars. If you're stuck broken down or otherwise trapped in a nasty winter storm it could be hours before a tow truck or repairman can reach you. With the heavy bunk curtain closed, several candles can heat a truck sleeper fairly well. Again, UNSCENTED and preferably low soot.   *spend the money on nicer shampoo & conditioner. One truck stop shower may have hard water, the next one may have soft water. Going back and forth with play hell on your hair.   *dry shampoo/baby powder, because sometimes lol @ showering  *Keep anything liquid or liquidy in your shower bag in its own leak-proof ziploc bag. Driving from Chicago to L.A. involves major changes in elevation and the same pressure change that makes your ears pop will also pop the top on your fav shampoo bottle and dump the contents on everything in the bag.

Baby powder or gold bond are also nice. Boob and thigh sweat are very unpleasant; especially if you can't get to a shower in the near future. For the emergency bathroom situation, we double bag the trash can. If you're stuck in a snow storm, broken down, or parked in a picnic area for the night, having a semi comfortable sit down option is nice. We have a strict no pooping in the truck rule. Only the dog has violated this rule in our two years on the road.   If there is an emergency bathroom situation, nobody wants to fight with a parking spot- especially at night. Pull into a fuel bay and go inside and do what you need to do. Don't let asshole super trucker give you shit for not fueling. We do not have the luxury of shoving our lady parts into Gatorade bottles while driving at interstate speeds. Politely tell him to mind his own or say something about periods. That always scares them off.   This doesn't really apply to the questions asked but its about team driving. Team driving is very fast paced. There were days when I didn't even see my husband because of how dog tired we would get running cross country. He would try to stay awake and spend time with me only to end up falling asleep in the passenger seat. You are together all the time but you aren't really spending any quality time together. You have to maintain separate sleep schedules in order to run safely and effectively. Its excellent money but it is very exhausting and can get lonely at times, shockingly.   The mattress cover will help with the bumps in the road. Spend the $40 for the down or down alternative cover. Its the best investment we have ever made.  Egg carton covers are dirt and hair magnets. Hopefully you aren't a light sleeper. I can sleep through a tornado but my husband wakes up if I graze the rumble strips.    Hope you don't mind body odor or farts.

Depending on who you work for, they are required to randomly pool a percentage of their drivers each quarter. This percentage is usually based on how many drivers in their company wind up failing. Don't quote me here, but I think the statistics are if less than 10% fail per quarter, only 1% need to be tested(per quarter). If more than 10% fail, than 25% of employees must be pooled/tested each quarter.  Either way, why do you ask?

You get lost in the shuffle and don't make much money. It always seemed like we would run for a day or two then sit for a day or two. It was hell on our sleep schedules and you have to deal with bullshit city work every other run. They only run teams so you get short runs and long runs. We were contract so we made very little money.   Transport America is a company I would go back to in a heart beat. They ran us silly. Long runs consistently and since they also have a solo division, you don't have to deal with trailer jockeying or anything stupid. The people were amazing. They just want you to succeed. We also got an $11,000 sign on bonus paid out over six months. Don't know if that's still a thing. We only left because we liked spending time together and that wasn't really an option with them. They will run you ragged which is great unless you like hanging out with your team driver."
Trucking,3a3wrg,mrburnhollywood,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:43:19 2015 UTC,"Prime isn't that bad, except there's a LONG ass three-month road-trainee period if you've just scored your CDL.  First month you make a flat $600/wk, last two months it ups to $700/wk.  It's not THAT serious a shit sandwich, honestly - you'll make less than that at the worst companies like CR England or CRST once you're fully ""qualified""!  The good news with Prime is this: if you do lease-op you get 70% of the pay for each run - that is, whatever the customer pays.  Plus fuel surcharge, and if you're careful you can get good enough gas mileage to actually get completely free fuel.  They run very fuel-efficient trucks and trailers - DD-13 engines and Super Single tires on both tractors and trailers, plus good aero kit on the trailers.  9mpg or better fully loaded is possible, and in lease-op that makes a difference.  I don't know of any other way for a newbie to get into a percent-of-load pay system.  You can do it with Schneider's Choice (65%) and that's actually nice too because you can pick from a load board instead of grabbing whatever the dispatcher hands you, but they want six months experience first.  They might partially waive that for a team coming in though.  Another thing: on a lease-op deal from any of these companies, what happens is one of you will be the primary lease guy, ALL pay to the truck goes to that guy and then the ""primary"" guy pays the secondary guy.  Now, this CAN work great.  What happens is, the first guy ends up running enough miles to pay for the truck, plus some that would be similar to what he'd get paid normally as a solo, and then every mile the second guy runs is pure profit.  So, let's say the first guy runs 2,800 miles - with Prime that means a take-home pay per week of around $1,500-$2,000 if you watch your fuel economy - don't rush in six hours to a gig that doesn't pick up for eight, fr'instance - slow it down, eat less fuel.  So the second guy runs another 2,800 miles but it's nearly pure profit because the truck is already paid for by the first guy - a bit over $1,000 a week with all the extras and insurance and crap.  You have to figure out how you divide it all up.  All these companies love husband/wife teams because the money all goes in one pot anyways so there's no worries dividing shit up :).  And yes, most are OK with gay marrieds working the same way, just in case that's your situation.  (There's a rare few companies that are...well, ""Jesus freaks"" and might have issues - Covenant might be one, they put pro-life (anti-abortion) stuff on the backs of their trailers plus the occasional bible verse...)  I made the horrible mistake of starting with CRST - don't do that!!!  I'm now in a crappy lease elsewhere that I need to survive for six months and then I'm either going Schneider's Choice or IF I can get in, Mercer.  They don't normally take people with only six months in but my wife is scoring her CDL next month and like I said, all these outfits love them husband/wife teams - we're stable and the financial issues are easy."

Trucking,3a2svm,eog_prod,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:22:32 2015 UTC,"A lot of Canadian companies are much more generous in compensation than their American counterparts.  For example in my case:  I'm paid between 42 and 46 CPM, if I have a trainee on board I get $100 extra flat per day.  Any trailer I hook to pays $7.50 flat this compensate for the pre trip and post trip time.  To cross the border pays a flat rate of $20, if I have any extra inspections like FDA, USDA, agriculture, or random open ups. I'm paid a flat $10 for each of them.  Live loading / unloading is $25 for the first two hours then hourly rate afterwards. Hand bombing is $25 for the first hour then hourly afterwards.   Detention pay after 2 hours, layover pay after 6, and layover pay is it a $175 a day.  Also Canadian carriers are federally regulated so all the bullshit you see from US counterparts won't fly north of the border.  My trainees are willing to work and they pick up on the job quickly it's entirely possible to gross 60 to 65 k in your first year."

I get screwed significantly less running for Wal-Mart dedicated than I did company OTR.  Taking into account the hours spent sitting at the grocery docks pulling stickers, waiting for someone with keys to unlock doors, sitting in traffic in Phoenix during rush hour, and how slow their shitty underpaid unmotivated employees unload the truck (or don't, I unload the entirety of at least 1 stores groceries per day, some days no one will set foot in the trailer but me) I still make at least $11 an hour from the time I start my car 1.5hrs from the DC to the time I shut my car off in the driveway.  Some days i'm making close to $30 an hour, but those tend to be really damn exhausting and stressful.  Couldn't make the drive home 2 nights ago and had to get a hotel, but it got me into a house 15 minutes away from work that will significantly raise my quality of life.  Company OTR I never broke $5 an hour after getting off the initial hourly training wage.  This is a step in the right direction, at least getting how we're paid and how it can suck and be predatory out in front of more eyes, but Wal-Mart compensates its company and contract drivers pretty well compared to most of the big OTR fleets."

They have no clue that it is a separate entity from the retail side and don't know how well paid and well treated the drivers are. It is one of the best places in America for truck drivers. Sam Walton knew his stores success depended on the safe and timely delivery of goods and the Transportation/Logistics units reflect that.  I worked half time and my hourly average was $32.00 ... not bad for a person without a higher education. It averaged out to $.78 per mile.  And I never heard of another company that pays the drivers to sleep in their truck every night; at Wally World the rate is $42 per night.  It's a great place to work ... give it a try!  edit; typo"

To shift any later is counterproductive, unless you are climbing a hill and need some extra time to hit the next gear while accomplishing staying within the power band and keeping the turbo spooled up."
Trucking,39z6o1,eog_prod,4,Tue Jun 16 01:28:18 2015 UTC,"In my truck, (as they are all different).  I have a 2005 MBE 4000, 425hp rated for 1700RPMS.  Peak horse and torque are delivered as low as 1150 RPMs.  I shift at 1200 and catch at 1000.  Running heavier, we have to push more RPMS because they drop faster with heavy weight or grade.  You might go to 1400 or 1350 before shifting.  Once I run through my gears (18 speed Eaton Fuller; there are many types of these with different gearing) My last gear goes from 70 km/h (1000 rpm) to 110 km/h (1600-1650 RPM). (All the gears are to get moving, last one is coast).  So to answer your question.  Yes every day my truck is wide open at max RPMS.  Every time it hits 100km/h or 110 it is right up there."

It sucks when you're driving in a 75mph zone and your truck won't go faster than 60. Its dangerous. Not as many issues in California though, as the speed limit for trucks is 55."
Trucking,39z6o1,kdesu,2,Tue Jun 16 09:30:39 2015 UTC,"Redline (or the limiter) is about 2000 RPM on a Cummins N14 (which is a slightly older engine). You can't really hit it though, because then you can't pull the shifter out of gear. If I needed to get around in a hurry, I shifted at 1900.   When I was fully loaded, I had to floor it to keep my speed up when climbing any sort of hill. Out near Amarillo, I'd pick up speed going downhill (probably up to 70 MPH), floor it at the bottom of the hill, and end up at ~50 MPH when I reached the top of the hill."

Trucking,39s97l,ImagineFreedom,3,Sun Jun 14 09:24:10 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with trying it out.  A CDL is not a huge investment as far as time and money are concerned.  You could pick one up going to class part time on the weekends.  Never driving a stick won't be an issue, it's different enough to where you might be better off with a clean slate anyway.  As far as the stress, it depends on if you ""click"" with the job or not.  A lot of drivers, using BinghamL as an example, are here as a means to an end and ""can't wait to get out of it"".  If you don't love this job it can really wear on you.  I've seen a lot of that especially after the 08 economic crash.  Guys flood in to the industry out of desperation and last a couple of months before burning out.  I've been lucky enough to know that this is what I wanted to do since I was a young kid.  And I love every day of it.  The only way to find out is to do it."
Trucking,39s97l,scm44,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:41:34 2015 UTC,"Nothing wrong with trying it out.   True.  I'd just hate to bounce from career to career, only to get my training done and realize I've made a huge mistake and don't like OTR.  I guess having my CDL could help me at home, though, if I wanted to drive for businesses or whatnot.  I can totally picture myself in Utah admiring the scene and loving life OTR.  And I can also totally see myself in Utah admiring the scene, and just wanting to be home.  I guess it's gonna be one of those decisions that I'll have to make and see if it works out.  I'm not in it for the money.  Sure, money is nice and we all need it to survive.  I can make money.  I want to be in it for a job I love and want to do every day."
Trucking,39s97l,groundciv,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"My advice if you want a stable and consistent homebase, is to find a company that runs daycabs in your area and also takes on new CDL graduates.  Say Ozark for example though I don't know if they do that because they're on the other side of the country.  Once you've picked that company out and talked to someone who isn't a recruiter about how long of a wait it is to get on the dedicated home every night contract they have in your area, treat your training time like you would Basic Training in the Army or something.  You're going to be away from home for long periods with somewhat spotty contact making not much money to hone a newly acquired skill.  Also like basic, it's important that you get that skill down pat because it could mean the difference between life or death that you've already been through a situation with an experienced trainer coaching you so you don't run over a 4 wheeler or lose your brakes on a mountain.  Once you've done that initial investment in time and suckage, and given yourself some time to settle in to the realities of the local or regional job where you get to spend quality time with your peeps, it can be quite enjoyable.  There's nothing quite like running a couple-few tight, short runs at band rate + stop pay and knowing that in a single day you've made more than half of your monthly rent.  The more money I make, the more stressful and long my days were.  Last week I cleared $1300 with 1 day off and 1 really easy 4 hour day.  It also included 2 days where I ran 3 loads and used up 13:47 and 13:15 of my 14 hour clock, respectively, and was worried about my safety on the drive home due to fatigue.  If I'm not breaking $600 on the week, I probably spent a lot of time frustrated at the yard with shitball equipment and crap trailers and wound up taking 2 or 3 days off due to crappy load planning or bad driver management.  This has only happened once, but it was its own kind of stressful.  My average week is about $800-$1000, 1 day off, 1 or 2 easy 4-6 hour days where I'll only make $120, one hair-puller of a 3 load tightly timed no-time-for-backup we're goin' in dry eating is for the weak day where I'll clear $300, and mostly 2 loads per day and at least an hour all up sitting in traffic in Phoenix or Tucson.  Stress on these weeks mostly comes from my long drive to the DC (fixing it this week when I sign a lease on my own grown up house, yay!) and heavy city traffic at the I-10/I-17 interchanges eating up clock I could use to pick up a load somebody fell off of and making more money.  OTR was stressful because I was away from the people I cared about and wasn't making shit for money.  I was team driving, which has its benefits and its drawbacks the main knock being you can't get out of the truck and explore when your shift is over.  On the positive side, when you're doing long runs you're mostly highway driving for 10.5hrs or so and only doing explicitly truck drivery things for about 12, 12.5 hrs.  If you get on with a good company (NOT CR ENGLAND FOR OTR PLEASE BELEE'ME ON DISS) you can make good money doing this, and with a good dispatcher the stress level can be pretty low overall."

I got offered a job as a Wrecker driver, as I have a mechanical background and a CDL in good standing and you don't have to be a diesel mechanic.  I would've been local in Tucson, on call 24/6 with one day with no responsibilities to the company, and averaged the low end of what I make a week now - $700.

However, she plans to stay home to work on the business we want to build, and be there for our child, because our families have failed us so badly over the past few months.   My father is a 15+ year trucker, my high school friend just got into trucking a few months ago – both say it's not so bad, and the company I'm going for (Knight) offers multiple schedules to choose from (home weekly, 14 on / 7 off, etc.).

I have always been local, and am doing it to pay my bills while I go to school in a mostly unrelated field.  That said, I'll lay out what you'll face if you get a similar job to me.  You don't have an ""off time"". You don't know when you'll be off until you are. So if you like drop of the hat randomness in your life, and planning meals, family time, appointments around that then sign on up.  You'll get days where you drive 10 miles to your delivery then bust your ass delivering for 8+ hours, then go wait to get loaded for 3 more hours before going home.  You'll be coming back to the terminal empty, on your 11+th hour of work that day, then they'll ask you to run somewhere real close, but they take hours to process drivers, just to find out the freight isn't even ready.  You'll have to block roads temporarily while you back into places. So you'll eventually need to be good at maneuvering under pressure.  Any paper work or scheduling issues are usually just a few clicks for the office drones to fix, but they easily cost you hours of your time, at no fault of your own.  I'm not trying to scare you off. You will also get good days where it's just drop and hook, or one easy stop where you get to cruise and check out landscape.   I listed those negatives because those are some of (not all) the problems / challenges / frustrations that you'll face and your ability to deal with them will determine if you will enjoy it.  This is all also based on local work, at a company that pretty much hauls anything that fits in a truck. Otr has it's own set of challenges, some overlapping, but I'll leave that to someone who does it to explain.  In your case, it might take a few years to get back to what you're making now, plus you are throwing a ton of your control over your life out the window if you start trucking.  I personally can't wait to get control of my life back and use my brain at work beyond simple routing and un/loading skills. To many companies, you're only a steering wheel holder who has no purpose in life but to hold that steering wheel. Try to avoid them if you go for it, though when you start out you don't exactly have the pick of the litter.  Anyway, this seemed to turn out more negative than I planned. You mentioned being stressed at your current job, I just wanted you to know that trucking can be very stressful as well, and when you have to deal with problems you're usually out in the field which can complicate things. You got to do the nice part, driving for hours looking at scenery. It's everything before and after that part that is going to determine whether you'll like it or not."
Trucking,39s97l,00stephen,2,Sun Jun 14 08:48:41 2015 UTC,"And don't refer to the dispatchers as office drones. If you go in there expecting your manager to be an asshole, you'll probably treat him like he is one. He'll reciprocate and your career will hurt for it. Remember that they're people too, and when they're managing 100+ trucks all day, they usually have something going on that's more pressing than a pickup number or empty trailer location (failing loads, setting up multiple repower relays to get a guy home to his sick kid, rollovers and coordinating with towing companies, etc). Treat them well, they'll treat you well. And don't think for a second that just because they can't drive a truck and work on your sleep schedule that you are somehow superior to them or think that they should kiss your ass and take your insults and complaints about their work the way an Applebee's server will. Many of them studied hard for years to get where they are, and most drivers wouldn't have the ability to perform their tasks or handle the stress of what they put up with juggling that many loads and driver issues either."
Trucking,39s97l,Kenny_Login,3,Sun Jun 14 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should have been more specific. I wasn't referring to the dispatchers as office drones. I treat them with respect, and they do their best to reciprocate. It has to be a 2 way street. Do some crap loads for them without complaining and they'll throw you nice ones here and there.  I was referring to times when someone (higher up) who has supposedly been educated on the shipping process has a shipment they need picked up / delivered, so they get it in the system, prepare the paper work, then give it to dispatch. Dispatch fits it into the schedule, driver spends time getting to the location, waiting in line, just to find out what a phone call could have - that they aren't ready for some reason. In my experience this is usually some ""oh before you go home..."" scenario, so it's cutting into your personal time. Yet everyone who made the mistakes is at home already or off playing golf, etc.  The point I was trying to make is that little careless mistakes upstream can turn into massive time loss on the driver's part. Also, there's enough separation that those people don't see what happens or have motivation to try to avoid those situations. It's a simple phone call or mouse click to them.  You're entirely correct though, you can't always expect to be the number one priority. If a company doesn't work with your schedule then find something else that does. The relationship with your dispatcher is important, you both need to be able to rely on and trust one another."
Trucking,39s97l,Oliwan88,2,Sun Jun 14 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"Many of them studied hard for years    lol cough  ""studied"" what, exactly?  This driver worked in a finance/IT office for 18 years.  Many, if not most, office workers are very much indeed drones... and are plenty willing to defer tasks, shift blame, move slowly or inefficiently, and otherwise prioritize their work in a way that turns a blind eye in regards to impact upon others.  Not all... but many, if not the majority.  That said, be kind those people.  You catch more flies with honey than vinegar."
Trucking,39s97l,AlmightyApkallu,2,Sun Jun 14 17:53:54 2015 UTC,"You may have worked in finance/IT for 18 years, but you know that puts you in a small minority of drivers with office experience and a college education. Whether it's database management, payroll software and simple accounting, load management, or just general management, most drivers couldn't do that. Even Microsoft Excel would be a challenge to most of the the drivers that have to call in every day with questions you would never have to ask. And there is an entire Bachelor's of Science in business administration dedicated to Logistics Management. 20 years ago, even 10 years ago, a dispatcher could get by knowing how to work a phone. Everything is on the computer now, and that means larger companies are hiring more highly skilled dispatchers, specifically young people with college degrees who know how to work quickly much more quickly on a computer than your average 35+ year old dispatcher who learned how to dispatch before all of the technology changed. These days, it's not as simple as pick a load, pick a truck, click the start button. But guys like you are why I said ""most drivers."""

If you like driving you should consider it. You get use to operating a large commercial vehicle on the road although it may seem like at first you aren't so sure what you're getting into.

I've been in the reefer business my whole life. In extreme heat and extreme cold continuous is best."
Trucking,39ryr7,buhrzzy,5,Sun Jun 14 19:30:41 2015 UTC,Always cycle. You use so much less fuel. It also helps it from not freezing up by letting the condenser time to warm up a little bit.

Trucking,39ryr7,socialrage,4,Sun Jun 14 13:24:24 2015 UTC,Leave it on. Especially frozen. Not only do you not have to deal with it starting all the time but leaving it on is a sort of cruise control vs on/off/on/off/on.  Edit - And most customers have a high/low on the BOL's and it's usually a lower tolerance than what cycle does.

Everything with me checks out except that 15+ speeding ticket. As some one else said, once that ticket is 3+ years old and you have a ""Clean 3 year MVR"" a lot of companies will start to hire you. Not all, some want a clean 5 year MVR but most look for a clean 3 year MVR as far as moving violations go. I'm at 2 and a half years now, I have about 6 more months to go until freedom.   Luckily, I found a major company to work for and worked myself into local gigs. That would be your best bet. Look at who has a good terminal and local stuff going on in your area, apply to them as an OTR driver, bust ass and do good for 6-12 months OTR and start trying to get yourself into the local work. It can be done. But yeah, until that ticket is 3+ years old pretty much no one, not even small mom and pop places will hire you, your only bet is the enormous companies you see like Swift, Knight, JB hunt, etc."

Trucking,39qzqf,Startide,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:15:55 2015 UTC,I want to agree with you because Phoenix is the best laid out/engeneered roads of any city of its size. But I-40 has serious issues. Especially between Flagstaff and Kingman. And the fact US 89 took soo long to get fixed is embarrassing. And I-11 has been in the books how long?

Trucking,39o75k,TechnoEquinox,2,Sat Jun 13 15:11:56 2015 UTC,"Neutron generator:       Neutron generators are neutron source devices which contain compact linear accelerators and that produce neutrons by fusing isotopes of hydrogen together. The fusion reactions take place in these devices by accelerating either deuterium, tritium, or a mixture of these two isotopes into a metal hydride target which also contains deuterium, tritium or a mixture of these isotopes. Fusion of deuterium atoms (D + D) results in the formation of a He-3 ion and a neutron with a kinetic energy of approximately 2.5 MeV. Fusion of a deuterium and a tritium atom (D + T) results in the formation of a He-4 ion and a neutron with a kinetic energy of approximately 14.1 MeV. Neutron generators have applications in medicine, security, and materials analysis.

You only get 1 license.  They can and will take it away.  The things you get out of a driving school are well worth it.  They will teach you the current regulations in the various areas of transportation, that allow you to safely and legally operate.  Know what your responsibilities are as a trucker, and where you stand with the law when they pull you over.  A fly by the seat of the pants instructor, is only going to give you what you ask for, and 99% of the time, that is ""Pass the test"" training.  If you can, check with the local community college, and look for a trucking program (I have heard they are way cheaper).  But if you are a seasoned vet, who knows the regulations, industry, where to get the updates, etc, and all you need is a license upgrade and some equipment training, go ahead and use a ""crash course"".  I did.  I had 3 years, 41ft straight truck experience (5Q, single axle drive).  5 years, 2 ton w 40ft goose-neck, and helped run our company for the last 5 years.  They estimated 10 hours.  2 hours pre trip training, 6 hours road training and backing, 2 hours test (use of vehicle).  I paid for a medical (160$), the upgrading fees(Less than 200), 1300$ for 10 hours, and less than 200$ for the roadtest permit + knowledge exam.  So.

Trucking,39kz1i,SHADOWJACK2112,2,Fri Jun 12 22:00:16 2015 UTC,"Used the oil additive in my Binder's N14, one gallon every oil change, but that was with petroleum-based Rotella in the crankcase.  As the motor had well over a million miles on it, using Lucas kept the blow-by down.  In the D12 and running full synthetic, using it defeats the purpose of running the synthetic oil due to it being a thickening agent.  The fifth-wheel grease is pretty good."
Trucking,39kz1i,13speed,2,Sat Jun 13 00:24:49 2015 UTC,"If you use synthetic oil, they make a synthetic oil stabilizer. It's a lot more fluid, and can also be used instead of the thick standard stuff in the winter. Read the bottle. I've been using it in my company truck. The owner and I both swear by it. I'm at 571,000 kms and I still keep 50 psi during the summer during a cruise at 1450 rpm. Going up hills when the turbo spools up and heats the oil, it still keeps good pressure. I had an oil change once with out it cause the mechanic forgot to put it in... Engine sounds like a heap when it gets hot up a hill climb. Else on a cruise on flat areas, the engine noise is almost at a bare minimum.  I use 1 jug with oil change, and as it burns down a bit, I add another 1/4 and after that use oil to top up. I've used mobile 1, with the synthetic oil stabilizer on an import car that use to burn oil pretty bad. I guess the detergents in the oil or something cleaned it right up, and eventually stopped the oil burning all together. Secondly, if you add little glob at a time to the powers steering if it's ATF in the resivoir, it really makes the steering stay easy when your fluid gets hot during a park and its tight or lots of back and fourth turns. I took out maybe 4 Turkey basters worth of oil and added about 3 globs. Drove and see how it does. It was still hard to turn the wheel when it got hot. Repeated the same steps but added maybe 4 globs and did it again. Did that until it never got hard to turn when it was hot and the steering wheel is almost as easy to turn as the old 80's Chevys where you could drive with your pinky finger all day. I never tried it with the PS fluid, but I assume it would be the same."

So out of curiosity I asked, ""What if I don't use the Internet?""   They said I could order one for $5.50 +s/h or go to the library and have it printed."

Now I'm round I g up the few online large city truck route maps, most states will mail you a copy, so I may order them all and scan them in.  CDL links wiki  Oddly enough, some states use third parties for online driver services."

I wonder about how nice it would be to go find a part time, after hours, weekend gig and get my Heavy Duty Mechanic, but I know the cost of things, and think once I got 100k into the tools, I would need to use them full time to make them profitable and not just a money sink that costs more then I save, and eats time too.  There is a fine balance between just enough tools to save money and all in, working for free, just to own tools."

Trucking,39h5q5,Ozdriver,8,Fri Jun 12 01:42:22 2015 UTC,That was nuts. So glad so many drivers pulled over for ya.
Trucking,39h5q5,ohmygodbees,8,Thu Jun 11 20:07:36 2015 UTC,"Really? I'm surprised at the number that drove straight past. Also from what I've read, a lot of trucks don't use CBs your side of the water, don't know how true that is. Guess that guy didn't have his turned on if he had one."
Trucking,39h5q5,vanishing_point,12,Thu Jun 11 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"If they all stopped it would end up being a clusterfuck trying to get emergency in. Crete really blew past the guy though, that was pretty bad."

Trucking,39h5q5,Ozdriver,6,Thu Jun 11 22:05:24 2015 UTC,"Where I live it's an unwritten rule that the first truck drivers stop to help, especially in a really bad crash like that, and I would say most of them do. But yeah, you got to use common sense where you park. But maybe some stopped behind, you can't really tell."
Trucking,39h5q5,Ozdriver,9,Thu Jun 11 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"It shut the freeway down for 7 hours so yeah, most of them did stop. There were 6 other drivers with extinguishers out there helping me put fires out."
Trucking,39h5q5,jcush313,4,Thu Jun 11 21:53:12 2015 UTC,That's good. The way those other trucks were driving past I thought no one gave a shit.
Trucking,39h5q5,Isotopi,9,Thu Jun 11 21:57:43 2015 UTC,"Most of them don't, but the guy that was in front of me actually stepped on the throttle to prevent me from hitting him. Really nice guy named Able. Stuck around for 2 hours to make sure he could help out as much as possible. Some people still surprise me."
Trucking,39h5q5,Hard_at_it,4,Thu Jun 11 22:00:19 2015 UTC,"Most of them don't. But keep in mind that ""most"" is only because of the shear number of first-years that don't have a clue about trucking, or CB's. A lot of schools are shunning CB's and some companies even have policies against them."
Trucking,39h5q5,AlmightyApkallu,5,Thu Jun 11 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"That's crazy because the whole idea of CBs is to avoid situations like this. I saw the vid where all the trucks were piling into each other in the snow the other week. Anyway, glad to see you're OK, and the other driver is lucky because fire and a crushed cab are often a fatal mix."
Trucking,39h5q5,Ozdriver,2,Thu Jun 11 22:04:51 2015 UTC,Yep I totally agree. Thanks brother.
Trucking,39h5q5,Ozdriver,4,Thu Jun 11 22:09:15 2015 UTC,"Used to be everyone had a cb & everyone helped in situations like this but for the past several years its getting harder here to even tolerate the garbage coming through a cb, you got the childish Howard Stern fans saying bababooy out of the blue for no reason, you got drivers acting gay & hitting on other drivers, you got drivers that 'aint wearin no panties', if you ask a serious question, you're more than likely to get a smart ass answer so more & more drivers are turning off the cb. It's sad but true. As far as stopping to help, last time I stopped to help people in a car that had just flipped, as I was going back to my truck I heard a loud crash, turned around and saw a car upside down and airborn because it had hit a tanker that had stopped to help."
Trucking,39h5q5,dubmystep,6,Fri Jun 12 02:08:06 2015 UTC,"Damn, glad you're okay. The person that hit you does not deserve to be driving ANYTHING, including a freakin truck."

Trucking,39h5q5,BlakDrgn,7,Thu Jun 11 19:09:20 2015 UTC,I'm sure if he was bobtail all that dash cam footage would be condensed to the sound of a crash followed by that camera getting some serious airtime.  That cheese saved your life.
Trucking,39h5q5,BlakDrgn,5,Thu Jun 11 22:17:05 2015 UTC,You made me jump out of my chair...   So the first impact was from the actual hit and the second impact that sent you forward was actually from the explosion?
Trucking,39h5q5,BlakDrgn,8,Thu Jun 11 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"The first impact was from the truck hitting the flatbed behind me when he swerved to miss him, and the second impact was him hitting me because when he swerved to miss the flatbed he clipped him with his steer tire, which ripped it completely off...the resulting drag of his bare rim sent him back into the right lane and into the back of my trailer. So when you hear me say ""WHOA!"" that was me witnessing the first impact and watching his tire and passenger door get torn off, seen in my right side mirror. His door flew over the flatbed and landed on the shoulder."

Trucking,39h5q5,kellanium,2,Thu Jun 11 23:11:14 2015 UTC,The left lane was clear. The guy that hit me clipped the flatbed behind me first and ripped his right steer tire off while trying to miss him by going into the left lane. When his steer tire flew off the drag of the bare rim sent him back into the right lane and into me.

Trucking,39fw8a,CptMalReynolds,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:15:26 2015 UTC,"No one knows how to drop a trailer.   When dropping a loaded trailer, lower the feet to the ground.  When the load is removed the suspension will rise back up, subsequently lowering the front of the trailer a bit. When dropping an empty, lower the feet to the ground and then turn back 3 turns.  After the trailer is loaded the suspension will lower and the front of the trailer will rise a bit. When dropping a trailer that is not being loaded/unloaded, lower the feet to the ground and then wind back 1 turn.     In all cases the tractor is supposed to lift the trailer and the feet should be just off the ground after you hook up.  If not, the trailer was dropped wrong.  You can still have problems if the 5th wheel height is not the same for all tractors in the fleet.  Additionally, you can have problems if a shunt driver has dropped the trailer.  I can't help you on that one because shunt drivers are too far too stupid to talk to."

Hook a 10k trailer to it and you are still ok. But add a 14k trailer and use it commercially and now you need a class a cdl.   Needing a dot number and needing a cdl are two different things.    Also lots of people drive very large vehicle and combinations that are rv's and don't need a cdl.

Trucking,39g7z5,ChuckinTucson,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:35:30 2015 UTC,Ime they are much more forgiving of over axle than over gross.   I'm not going to worry about a couple hundred over axle as long I'm under gross. But I could get popped and accept that.

Made a turn and as soon as I did I realized there was no way I could make it down the road with out scrapping cars and taking out power lines. I just popped the breaks and called 911 for assistance. I was blocking the road I turned onto and the one I turned off from but fuck it.

Like block off a 1 way street so I can drive the wrong way for a few hundred yards.  I feel sorry for that driver. He was really dumb, but I've been in those situations and it can be panic inducing.

It doesn't matter if it takes 30 minutes, back it up. What is amazing is that he had a mentor/team driver/other person with him, which makes it incredibly easy. Have your other person get out and kind of block traffic and help direct you back. It's usually not going to be too far before you can turn around or turn back to another street."

I have already given feedback to USA truck that I've been very happy with the training.  Training time is long (I've been in my trainer's truck for about a month) but I really needed this one on one training.   Big companies like USA may hire under trained drivers, but how can a new driver gain any experience?  I consider mega carriers as entry level driving positions.

The trucking industry is in a tricky position: they want new drivers to replace the retiring ones, but insurance restrictions don't allow just any company to hire new drivers.   Thus, only the self-insured (large carriers) can get the new guys.   I've heard the crash rates are higher for new drivers, but maybe that's where a lot more training for them would come in handy."

Trucking,39dbbw,AmeliaP0nd,4,Thu Jun 11 00:17:17 2015 UTC,"Are you OK with doing a year of ""long haul"" (over the road/OTR) with very little home time?   If so you want a company driver gig with at least 40 cents a mile pay, or if you do a lease/operator deal you want to get paid at least 65% of whatever is paid to the truck (plus the standard fuel surcharge).  That latter kind of deal with a ""newbie lease"" on a new or new-ish truck with fixed costs around $1,000/wk can net you $1,500/wk pay or more.  The big, big money happens when you buy your own truck separate from whoever your trucking company is.  There are high-end companies like Mercer and Landstar where you go in with a truck already in hand... either something used and way cheap (and you know how to pick out something that still runs OK, and maybe enough mechanical chops to do most stuff yourself) or brand new with a full warrantee.  You then get the 70% deal but your fixed costs drop.  It's hard to get into that kind of deal with less than a year's experience.   Example - my road trainer just got into Mercer after buying a brand new International Lonestar with a Cummins ISX motor, 13sp tranny.  First 11 days on the road he drove 6,000 miles, a lot of it at the speed limit 75 or 80.  He pocketed $8,000 - and that's with all fuel bills paid for.  His truck payments are around $2000/mo - much less than what a trucking company like Prime or Shneider would lease him a truck for, and those would be limited to 65mph or less.  He's on track to pocket over $20,000 a month.  Fuuuck.  Now, one of the few ways to get percentage pay with no previous experience is with Prime.  The turd sandwich part is, you'll spend up to the months as a trainee paid $600/wk the first month, $700/week the second two months.  But after that you can lease for about a grand a week and get paid 70% plus fuel surcharge.  That's not bad - don't do it for more than a year because after that you can find deals like what my buddy Jerry is doing at Mercer, assuming you don't fuck up in that year too badly :).  Now, I'm already decent with wrenches and I'm reading voraciously on various engines and trucks.  The motor's make/model/year makes more difference than the truck.  An International with a Maxxforce motor stinks, the same truck with a Cummins ISX might be awesome...and so on.  (Same with buying a computer - fuck the brand name, what CPU, GPU and HD does it have?)  So I'm more likely to go used than new.  I may do a Small Business Administration loan or similar, but the truck cash with that, keep some extra as my breakdown padding."

See my post here on that point:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Trucking/comments/39bi59/just_was_hired_on_as_a_fleet_manager_help_me_be/  Note that Crete pays .45cents a mile dryvan, .48cents a mile reefer.

Trucking,39cpt7,hobowithashotgun2990,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"Former broker here.  I used Crete for van freight in Dallas headed to the FL Panhandle and Miami (Non-Haz Chemicals).  I'm not too sure if they're running those lanes anymore.  I also used them from Stuttgart, AR on backhaul into DFW (Rice Oil) pretty frequently.  If I remember correctly I used them on a re-power out of El Paso on a Reefer load.  Decent communication and always on time.  I typically got foreign drivers with them.  Just my quick take/experience with them."

I know that a MAJORITY of my old contacts at Crete that I was speaking with have moved on, leaving my only option to start over again."
Trucking,39cg4z,sky225999,4,Wed Jun 10 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"It's literally the reason these companies can come in and outbid anyone for freight. They can come into a plant and sweep 100 loads a week out because they have the trucks, the drivers are paying them 6 grand for what normally costs 3, and they're paying new drivers half what they would make per mile anywhere else WHILE they're paying that 6k contract off.  Needless to say, you're going to get the cheapest training they can provide. I would wager the training and lease scams alone net them a profit, the freight is just gravy.  ...That's not to say there aren't good programs, but that's the gist of it.  edit: you're often team driving with your trainer at week two or 3, that's scary. Then some force you to team for the first 6 months, like PAM. That way they can run cheaper freight and shorter delivery windows."
Trucking,39cg4z,ohmygodbees,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"The thing about many private or community-college-based schools is that they don't provide rooms, so you're forced to pay for that and food (and whatever else) on your own.  That's at least one thing that isn't mentioned too often when people argue against company training. If you go to school anywhere other than your hometown, you've got to organize and budget for room, board, and possibly for transportation (as well as any costs that the training program doesn't cover, if there are any).  That's not to say these things can't be done, but it's just another thing on a long list to contend with."

Trucking,39cg4z,CafeRoaster,0,Wed Jun 10 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"That's not how maverick is. I'm in their student program and they are sending me to an actual college and putting me in a house. All I have to pay for is food, and they give me $500 to take care of that for the month. Then after all is said and done, I train on time management for a week, then flat bed training for a week, then trainer driving for a couple weeks. When I get hired after school, before any training, my six month repay starts. They seem like a company that prides themselves in quality and aid to its new drivers."
Trucking,39cg4z,LoneCowboy,2,Thu Jun 11 02:54:37 2015 UTC,"Most opinions you see on here about this will be opposite mine, I personally think its a great way to go, if school or a grant are out of reach its probably the only way to go, with the right company. I know Millis is a very respectable company & I hear good things about Rhoel's training program, Schneider I hear has a good one also. The way I see it, its best to stay with your first company for a year anyway, if you can get your schooling paid for while getting that first year experience in, why not? Be careful about companies that have a big lease program, some are known for starving you into a lease and you dont want that, not just starting out anyway. Not at all in my opinion but at least not for a while."

I had a bad time my first 6-12 and if I had been on contract from company training I probably would have blamed it on that but it simply was my not knowing what I was doing.

If a driver calls you up and says ""I have this reservation about this trip"" don't pull the whole ""Well I don't see why you can't..."" bit. It's extremely patronizing and will anger me, at least, faster than being told straight out what you want.   If a driver says they need fuel, they probably need fuel."

Sometimes we have to get away from it for a few days or have legit shot going on. My company has a problem with not giving people time off when they request it, and its running some long time drivers off. That's not acceptable from any angle."

If you have our backs against these bastards we'll have your back on the road and in on-time delivery, in large part because if we're late detention fees are out the window (as they should be, barring weather issues and such).

Trucking,39bi59,AlmightyApkallu,2,Thu Jun 11 01:27:11 2015 UTC,Simple.  Always tell the truth.
Trucking,39bi59,sledge07,2,Thu Jun 11 02:46:26 2015 UTC,"1, Always remember, those drivers make your job possible. Without you, they could still haul freight, without them you would have no job.   There are a lot of nut crazy, whiny ass bitch drivers out there but there are also a lot of very good, honest and intelligent hard workers. It will take working with them both at length to decipher who is who. Treat your drivers with respect, more than anything.   Even if you have to get stern with them, don't be disrespectful. Try to give them the benefit of the doubt when you can and realize most of the time they really aren't lying to you and the only reason they called is because you were their last resort. If something is amiss and you need to call them, always allow them a chance to explain themselves, even if they are full of shit, don't interrupt just listen before you begin to talk.   Don't be scared to be nice some times and change your tone or words enough to make your drivers feel like you're on their side, even when you aren't. It's all psychology and how you deal with them that dictates how they're going to act and what they're going to do.  Once upon a time I had a driver manager who was extremely chill. Always very calm, always proficient at solving issues. He did his best to help me whenever he could, so when he ever needed something I was always way more ready to help him and try to accommodate him as well. He was eventually promoted and moved elsewhere (sadly) but his drivers loved him and he had the most efficient fleet at that terminal. As he did, as a DM leave your emotions at the door and take a trip down psychology lane.  Don't get me wrong, you can't always do everything every driver wants, but as in any aspect of life, when you treat others fairly it comes back to you and when others begin to get irate, the best thing to do is keep your cool, explain your situation clear and firm and what it is you must have."

One thing I've noticed is the condescending tone a lot of our DMs use when talking to truckers, and I'm curious why. I can't figure out if it's what they saw other DMs doing when they went through training or if they think they have to talk that way to drivers to get them to cooperate or what"
Trucking,39bi59,BiWinning85,2,Thu Jun 11 11:14:57 2015 UTC,Because they deal with the backlash of their own behavior every day. Everything they do comes back on them and most of them are too dense to see it. It snowballs and they never escape it. They get pressure from above and below and they get slack even when they don't fuck up. Do it right from the beginning.  Don't ever let the company pressure you into pressuring a driver to do something illegal or immoral.

Trucking,398711,Blendipher,2,Tue Jun 9 23:22:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can get your intrastate CDL at 18. It will be difficult to find a driving position though. If you live in a big (ish) town, go to a local yard and see about maybe being a yard spotter. Some rural states I know will hire youngsters for equipment operations during construction season for mowing, pothole patching, litter control etc and some require a CDL.   However, if you live anywhere in the plains states I highly encourage you to look at custom harvesters. Harvest is already firing up in the southern areas of the breadbasket and these guys can and will hire 18-21 y/o guys with CDLs for equipment operation. As far as driving trucks, some places will let you and others won't.  But, these guys also sometimes run trucks in the non harvest months running grain to elevators/barges/railcars and some stay in state so that's an area of possibility.    Otherwise finding a driving job between 18-21 is hard to come by."

Trucking,397z0a,cdnstuckindetroit,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:17:59 2015 UTC,"Ok... first thing to know about cheap inverters is, don't run them at more than 75% of their stated wattage.  So, a 100w inverter is OK with a 65w laptop for example,  and this is measuring wattage at 110v as opposed to 12v.  If you try and drive a 1000w microwave off a cheap 1000w inverter... yeah... something could go ""puff"" and let the magic smoke out.   Second, cheap inverters suck.  They put out ""square wave"" AC instead of some wave AC.  Now, anything that has an external transformer to turn AC into DC will be OK with square wave AC, including laptops, TVs, cellphone chargers and the like.  My wife's hearing pad on the other hand actually caught fire within Minutes of being plugged into a cheap 1500w inverter supplied by my company.   AC powered electric motors hate square wave power.  My 900w microwave seems to do OK with my crappy 1500w inverter but it takes about 25% longer to cook anything.   The other scary part about inverters is, you have to run very beefy cables between the battery bank and inverter (because they're only 12v) and if those massive cables ever short out, something is likely to burn."
Trucking,397z0a,JimMarch,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:17:55 2015 UTC,because they're only 12v   You lot use 12v inverters? Seems odd is it just cost or do you know why?
Trucking,397z0a,admiralranga,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:38:42 2015 UTC,"The trucks in the US use mainly 12v battery banks.  This is for safety: despite the massive amperage that's well able to kill you deader'n'Elvis, 12v isn't enough ""electrical pressure"" to make it through the high resistance value of normal mostly-dry human skin.  DO NOT whatever you do put your tongue on one end of the battery array while peeing on the other end.  You will die in spectacular fashion.  The downside to a 12v power system is that you need to use really fat wires on the whole thing.  If we were to up the voltage to 48v or more we could use skinnier wires everywhere, but big-voltage DC is some very scary shit which is why electric cars have huge warnings about dealing with the battery packs.  See, big AC voltage has a safety advantage: if you get yourself crossed into it, the alternating current tends to ""shake you"" and jar you loose from the connection, which is why contact with a 110v US household power socket usually doesn't kill you.  Big-voltage DC however will tend to ""freeze you in place"" and seriously fuck you up.  And that's why automotive and even truck DC battery systems for the starter motor and such tend to be 12v, despite the downsides in cabling width needed.  If the power systems were 24v or higher, we'd use inverters with DC power inputs to match, and yes 24v and 48v input inverters do exist for big fixed solar panel or other off-grid home power systems, with massive safety warnings from hell!"
Trucking,397z0a,JimMarch,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:50:26 2015 UTC,"The trucks in the US use mainly 12v battery banks.  even truck DC battery systems for the starter motor and such tend to be 12v,    I thought they were 24v bank of 2x 12v, thats what the Cat 3406 in my boat uses and every truck I've seen. 48v is still mostly safe, you do have to go up a fair way before it starts becoming dangerous which is why it gets used for most telco gear. I have noticed that 24v inverters are expensive as hell tho."
Trucking,397z0a,admiralranga,0,Thu Jun 11 04:05:18 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  Well I've seen nothing but 12v trucks BUT I'm still fairly green to trucking, so...yeah.  The 48v in telco is a data-level signal, no significant amps behind it.  The ring voltage on a punch panel can slightly sting your finger but it won't kill you...been there done that.  A ""stun gun"" with ""50,000"" or whatever volts powered by a small 9v battery also isn't a killer because it doesn't have a lot of amps behind those volts.  Amps is the actual power.  Voltage is the electrical ""pressure"" behind the power.  Resistance is the ability to block the combination of the two.  One volt will push one amp through one ohm of resistance.  Enough amps with only 12v behind it will still bust through human skin-level resistance and if it did the results would be spectacularly bad.  I don't know how many 12v truck batteries wired in parallel it would take to do that, or what thickness cable it would take, but it would have to be really a really big setup :).  (Wired in series the voltage goes up and by the time you have a 48v system powered by truck starter batteries, yeah, it's a killer.)"

When confronting the company on their behavior they called the police on me and tried to get me for stalking and harassment. They then put a false accident report on my DAQ even though I never actually worked for them. Run far away."

When they do your security interview either say you have never smoked in your life or that you tried it once at least 5 years ago. I came from a similar situation to yours.

They put the hair through a molelcular scanner and if thc or other drug metabolites show up, then it comes up as a positive. I wouldn't mention the word pot, weed, marijuana or anything related to drugs anywhere near a trucking company employee. No one cares if you had a card, its still illegal at a federal level and its not a moral judgment. People get sent home for less. Its a federal law and an insurance requirement. There are plenty of jobs that won't hair test you. Also, you could shave your head, arms, etc.  Yes, they would deny you if your hair comes up positive for thc. No fucking question. Its excessive because some companies choose to mitigate risk by screening out drug users."

It's typical for training companies to find reason to take back the truck no matter how stupid the reason is, just so they can lease it to someone else.  If the contract said that all repairs must go through a shop then so they must. If you replace a bulb on your own because you didn't want to wait 5 hours at a shop it's best to say nothing about it and eat the $5 that you spent, save the receipt and toss it in the deductible pile."

There are plenty of clauses in there where you can be terminated immediately.  Example:  You use the truck to make money without being dispatched by Schneider.

It won't get sleepy, it will get better fuel mileage, and it will be less likely to get distracted.  Drivers are going to still have to navigate through cities, back the truck up, and put gas in the tank, take exits, do pre-trips, make adjustments, pallet jack, or take over in bad weather.

Any single issue on the truck, so much as a failing fuel position sensor to a slightly cold 02 sensor that will trip the trucks ECM into thining there is an issue, can cause opti idle to stop working.

I wanted to drive the big euclid trucks on the open pit side but never got the chance.

DON'T let whatever your company is send you out for your first run on a friday. Weekend dispatchers are a disaster and they can't usually help you when you're confused about a process or something.  After that initial mess, I came back at it a couple years later. The transition has been harsh. Lost a significant other to it, changed my lifestyle to match this, make peace with missing a holiday or two, some birthdays, that family event you do every year... might not make it. Having someone to compare notes with on a daily basis is endlessly helpful. Hang out on the phone for a while and bitch about traffic, talk about what yo h learned... Leaned to occupy myself. Laptop is great. Get out... wander around a shippers lot if it's quiet and that's allowed. Look at stuff and think about it.  You're gonna crack eventually. Just have someone you can talk to when you're dying to get home and dispatch sent you 1200 miles in the opposite direction, you're sitting on the side of the highway cause a tire blew, it's hot, traffic Is insane and you're getting twitchy trying to keep an eye on everything like a responsible trucker, there's no where to park cause of that blowout you had made you have to drive until 1am to make up for the time...  The adjustment time, and the getting your feet wet time is really harsh. Remind yourself every day that this shit happens all the time, it's frustrating as hell, it's ok to be mad.

He somehow went from ""gov is evil for allowing beer"" to ""the gov killed my son in Iraq"", and had a speaking style that reminded me of schizophrenics too. If anything, losing his son probably sent him off the deep end. He ended up handing me a pocket constitution with some website scrawled on the back, and kept asking me things in code phrases.

Trucking,38r54s,TCBloo,2,Sun Jun 7 04:14:34 2015 UTC,My last truck was a 2012 T700 and it got terrible mileage and was consistent about breaking down every 6 weeks or so.  I tracked the fuel mileage with the let's truck app. I could be empty and get 4.5 mpg and get 5 or more full. Absolutely terrible.  Now I am in a 2015 T 680 and consistently get over 7. It also uses way more def and has yet to break down. My point is that sometimes there is nothing you can do.  Yeah fuel is expensive and you can agree with the truck owner but do not compromise on climate control. You can get arrested for leaving children and pets in a non air conditioned vehicle. You rate just as much consideration.

Trucking,38prxv,Ozdriver,4,Fri Jun 5 22:08:37 2015 UTC,"If a fleet has 100 trucks the difference between 30k and 15k oil change is about $60,000 a year. For UPS it's a difference of about $55 million.   I'm not sure what it's like now but I remember awhile back that Detroit Diesel didn't have any issues with engine warranties with oil changes at 75k, provided it was Delo 400 oil. Also, Thermo King reefers get oil changes every 3000 hrs which is basically once a year.  By far the best way to determine the optimal oil change interval is by doing oil analysis. I personally prefer Caterpillar's S.O.S. lab. International dealerships provide oil analysis as part of their Performance PM.   We switched from mineral 15w40 to a synthetic 0w40 and through oil analysis found out it wasn't worth the extra cost so we switched back.  The OEM schedules are just recommendations. You're going to want to bring a dump truck in a lot more than a highway tractor. The real problem happens when you do oil analysis and realize you can extend your maintenance interval to the point that the trucks never get looked over and you start running into corroded battery terminals, worn out u-joints and spring pins etc.  I'm a big fan of PM A services where you bring the unit in and look over everything and grease it but don't change the oil. We call this service the turn & burn."
Trucking,38prxv,AnotherIdiotOnTheWeb,2,Sat Jun 6 01:49:10 2015 UTC,"I rely heavily on oil sampling, it saved me an engine when the copper count was 100 ppm and it turned out a main bearing was breaking up (GM 8V92 years ago).  Caterpillar recommend change the oil and filters at 9,500 litres of fuel burn and their SOS oil sampling backs that up. I'm also using Delo 400, it's supposed to be semi-synthetic and I get better results than when I used genuine CAT oil."

Trucking,38prxv,Copie247,2,Sat Jun 6 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"We do D services monthly or 25,000km (30 days) which is a full inspection, on the newer prime movers they run the oil out to 50,000km, older units they change it every 25,000km.  We run auto greasers on everything, and they are anal about everything, no matter how small.  Every 100,000km is an F service which is a full day service which they do the diffs/transmission oils + hub bearings etc.  Seems to work well, we rarely have any come back on a hook, and rare to have breakdowns out on the road.  I personally check all of my S-cams and lashers and adjust them as needed weekly, not that its really needed, since i get 300,000-400,000 out of drums/liners, another neat item for the toolbox i think everyone should have is an infared/laser heat gun to measure tyre/hub temps, can save a lot of headaches."

And yeah there's usually breakdown pay but most drivers would be getting paid what they would be if they were driving instead of sitting and being broken down. My experience with recruiters is they try to play the semantics game with me and tell me what I want to hear. Or they don't know basic things about the job like whether or not the carrier has a pet policy... One recruiter when I asked her about pet policy actually went on a 5 or so minute rant on her personal views about keeping pets in the truck, wtf? Overall don't really care for most recruiters I've dealt with."

Trucking,38oek3,keeperofthelawn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:20:45 2015 UTC,"depends how you are working the clutch. if you use the clutch break while the truck is moving it will wear down the clutch break quicker. if you are going light on the clutch you are slipping the disk as rpm/speed changes, the clutch plate is not fully disengaged causing wear on that while it slips.  if you are climbing a grade you have that accelerator floored. keep pressure on the stick as if to take it out of gear. once you get off the accelerator the stick will pop out of the gear. if you are on the accelerator you wont be able to muscle it out of gear unless you hit an rpm governor. so just hammer down, pressure on stick, let off accelerator (you will go into neutral) goto next gear, when the gate opens (when you reach the proper rpm road speed ratio for that gear) slide (or grind) it in (that is how you float when climbing a grade). when clutching into a gear the clutch just disengages the transmission from the engine allowing you to maintain rpm of the transmission when you clutched (just in case rpm changed after using clutch).  if you have trouble floating you can get an understanding of the concept by doing the following. when bobtail its easy to feel the accelerator and the tension of the transmission and truck frame (the truck frame absorbes torque from the transmission (you can see this when one side of the truck lifts during hard acceleration)). since its so easy to feel when bobtail (the truck lunges forward and backwards) it's easy to get a feel of what is a smooth shift. from a stop go into second and drive at idle rpm (no accelerator). make note of the speed. go into 1st and travel the same speed. hold the accelerator steady as a rock, shift into neutral, take foot off accelerator, once you reach idle rpm slide it into second gear. it should  be so smooth it wouldnt wake a baby. after practice you can do the same as bobtail where you hold the accelerator at the proper rpm for the next gear. for a DD15 on a RoadRanger 9 the gears are spaced 4.5k rpm apart but in the time it takes todo a shift you are looking at 5k rpm between gears (can very depending on high or low side of tac)."
Trucking,38oek3,Copie247,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:36:09 2015 UTC,the idle gear shift thing is like shifting out of 1.2k into .8k rpm or something on my truck. sorry i dont look at the gauges anymore.

Trucking,38nllj,AspiringTrucker,3,Fri Jun 5 21:00:01 2015 UTC,Lower your suspension.
Trucking,38nllj,Ozdriver,2,Fri Jun 5 11:55:22 2015 UTC,I thought that the suspension dump in the truck only lowered the trucks suspension. Does it also lower the trailer suspension?
Trucking,38nllj,Copie247,6,Fri Jun 5 12:02:33 2015 UTC,"Get under the trailer and disconnect the rod that goes from the axle to the height control valve, then lower the suspension manually. Generally you undo a 1/4"" bolt with a 7/16"" spanner or small shifter.  Some trailers have got a dump control on the side somewhere, they can be hard to find."
Trucking,38nllj,socialrage,3,Fri Jun 5 13:17:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip, I watched some youtube videos with examples of trailer dump valves, but I'm pretty sure the one I was pulling didn't have one.  I get driver mail about once a month ranting about how if you don't know what you are doing don't fuck around with the equipment (I'm assuming a lot of guys try to adjust stuff without knowing what they are doing and fuck shit up way worse) so I wouldn't be that surprised if they disconnected them or bought trailers without them."
Trucking,38nllj,toothpick209,2,Fri Jun 5 20:54:37 2015 UTC,Just remember to take note the measurement between the chassis and top of the axle so you can reset it to the right height. Running too high or low will destroy bags.
Trucking,38nllj,Ozdriver,2,Fri Jun 5 16:22:27 2015 UTC,I second this. I use to pull reefer and was hourly. Being hourly I didn't get the lumpers often and had to unload with a hand jack. If it was heavy stuff I would always take apart the air ride and manually dump it. If you have kick stands on the trailer you can't release the breaks until you dump the bags.
Trucking,38nllj,kellanium,3,Fri Jun 5 15:23:37 2015 UTC,"Not all trailers come with a suspension dump. I'm not that familiar with reefers because I am in open deck trucking but if your trailer doesn't have a suspension dump, it really should. It's a lot safer for a forklift to be on a solid surface instead of bouncy all the way through your trailer."
Trucking,38nllj,mega_donkey,3,Fri Jun 5 12:24:20 2015 UTC,"I'll often dump the air on both truck and trailers when I am chaining a load, it makes it a lot easier to throw the chains over."

Trucking,38nllj,planert360,2,Fri Jun 5 14:36:59 2015 UTC,Setting your brakes so the suspension dumps will not damage your trailer.  Infact most recievers and shippers require you to set your brakes. Don't drop your tractor suspension it could actually pitch the rear of the trailer higher. Slide your tandoms all the way up to the front set your brakes so the air suspension deflates this is the maximum drop you can get without damaging anything or taking crap apart

Trucking,38lmng,D_Farmer,3,Fri Jun 5 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, easily. I wouldn't go with a high-rise sleeper or giant stacks though because if you're hauling from farms you may have to get under overhead bins/augers/grain vacs etc. And if you're going to be hauling straight from the field, soft dirt can be hell on the auto transmissions from what I've been told. Also long hoods can be a pain for tight driveways, not for a super trucker though. Any other questions just ask, I pull a hopper bottom and haul a lot of corn and soybeans."

Trucking,38k0t6,cdnstuckindetroit,9,Thu Jun 4 23:41:22 2015 UTC,Short answer: They are off road vehicles.     Long answer:  They now must comply to Tier 4 regulations.

They expect us to pickup & deliver loads on time, every time and I guarantee if you're safety department wants you somewhere on a certain day dispatch can magically make that happen.

Trucking,38l9pb,cdnstuckindetroit,4,Fri Jun 5 00:06:54 2015 UTC,For home time is best to say a day or two earlier than needed if for a certain reason. If it's not important to be home on that day then within a few days isn't that bad. Also don't take anything not headed home. I tell my dm no that's not headed to my home and I have time off coming.   For pay if you're taking advances that's where it went. Also make sure if advances for lumpers or tolls or whatever you turn those in. Are you doing a lease or school being paid back?  There's a reason that money didn't show. Look at your check stub and see why.   Edit: words and grammar

One of the reason I wanted to drive flatbed ever since. Had new pallets and they say my pallets no good, and they don't have lumpers. So I had to restack on their pallets even though my pallets were new, stack a certain way they even had a diagram to go by it was complicated, then you had to shrink wrap it and label each one. After driving 10 hours, had to do all that. Took 6.5 hours!!! Flatbed look better to me now even with the tarp and extra work. Furthermore, a company will pay lumpers $350, but only give you like $50 and they will try to cheat you out of that plus drop pay if it's multiple drops. I know about those crooked grocery companies. they aholes and dispatcher kiss their butt cause they want their biz so he make you unload it.

Trucking,38ivl9,adventure_dog,4,Thu Jun 4 17:16:14 2015 UTC,That's possibly the most b.s. reason I've heard to terminate someone.   Were you still using them for insurance? I've also never heard of a company allowing someone to keep a truck they were leasing after the contract was terminated.

Trucking,38ivl9,sledge07,3,Thu Jun 4 22:06:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not doubting you but I feel like I'm misunderstanding something.  Correct me if I'm wrong:  Schneider terminated your contract because you had a turn signal repaired at a truck stop and paid out of pocket?  How did they even find out?    Just doesn't make sense to me, I've fixed countless ripped wiring harnesses on their trailers, replaced countless lights, usually out of pocket because its a couple dollars and I get on with my life.  When I leased a truck from SNI all the maintenance I did on the truck I paid for out of pocket rather than going through their maintenance program.  Was never a problem.  I can't wrap my head around why they would care, and how they would even KNOW in the first place.  So, Schneider (the trucking company) terminated your contract but Schneider Finance (separate) let you keep leasing the truck from them up until now, right?"
Trucking,38ivl9,00stephen,3,Thu Jun 4 21:32:55 2015 UTC,I told them why I was late.  I paid for it and I replaced it by myself.
Trucking,38ivl9,waldotherogue,2,Thu Jun 4 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, but how does that relate to Schneider terminating your contract?  You said above you fixed a turn signal and that's why they terminated it.  Where does being late tie in to things, were you late for a pickup/delivery?  Didn't let anyone know?  Gotta be more to it."
Trucking,38ivl9,Injectingspores,6,Thu Jun 4 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  They didn't terminate him because he fixed a turned signal, they terminated him because he was late (I would hedge a bet that's not the only time, or the only reason).  You know how in court you're asked to tell ""the whole truth""?  Telling people they fired you for fixing a turn signal is not the whole truth, and is misrepresentation (that's putting it politely).  If your trailer needs a repair, you contact your DBL immediately so your PU/DP/NAT times can be adjusted.  As for the deductible, offer to place $1500 in an escrow."

If I have to take extra days off, then it won't be a problem (the days off would be unpaid, of course).    Can you pick your own equipment?     Yeah, I can pick one of the guys 2 trucks. Or if I had the money, I could bring my own truck (but you can do that with any company).    Can you decide who you team with?     Technically I can, IF I knew someone with a CDL. But since none of my friends have one (not yet anyway- I have one who's working on it), I get to choose between 2 people to team with.    These are all questions that determine the difference between an employee and an INDEPENDENT contractor.  If you get a 1099, you will be responsible for paying ""self employment"" tax which is both sides SS/Medicare which is around 15% (guessing here).     Yeah, he was upfront about that. I'm planning on setting aside 20% and paying quarterly estimated taxes. I've done 1099 work before, just not in trucking, and was wondering if/how it's different.    So your .40cpm just went to about .35cpm.   Isn't that how it is in all companies? You get 40cpm (for example), then you pay taxes on it? The only difference I see here is that i have to do taxes myself now instead of the company doing it (which I honestly prefer anyway- CRST didn't take any federal taxes out last year. NONE. So I owed the IRS a lot of money)."
Trucking,38harv,bigplrbear,2,Thu Jun 4 16:49:03 2015 UTC,"No, you pay your tax PLUS the employers portion. Outside of specific circumstances 1099 is illegal, and being a company driver means your w2; crst not withholding any federal income tax?

If you have other options stay away from 1099's. $1800 can turn into a $4800 tax bill with interest and penalties. Made payments on it for a while and they still kept adding to it!

I can always fall asleep after a long day of driving regardless of time of day so I do feel well rested. It's kind of weird to lose all sense of context with time of day and what it means though. The problem is so many warehouses take refrig'd loads at like 2-5am, then others take them 9-12am it's pretty much impossible to manage if you can't roll your sleep cycle.  I don't really mind it, and I can justify the extra hassle with the paycheck. If I were older and less adaptable it would be rough."

Trucking,38g7ip,spotries,5,Thu Jun 4 19:04:23 2015 UTC,"$18 an hour with no benefits is $36k a year, less whatever you have to pay for health insurance etc out of pocket that would normally be provided at a discounted rate as part of your benefits.  Figure ~$30k a year with benefits is your break even point. I am not a trucker, but from what I understand, you should be able to exceed that in your first year. At Prime's minimum guaranteed gross pay of $700 (if quick internet searches are right) while you are with a trainer, you will make the equivalent of more than $30k a year. At 34+ CPM after that, if you average only 1,764 miles a week with 2 unpaid weeks off you will make >$30k, and (again, while I am not a trainer) that should not be that hard to do, even in your first year.  Hope this helps. Really, you will probably work more hours trucking, but if you can stick with it for just a full year your total income will be higher."

Trucking,38dpg2,sporabolic,3,Wed Jun 3 15:26:12 2015 UTC,Periodically check your equipment.   Look for hot rims and tires.  If one rim is hotter than the rest you are going to have a problem.    I've seen seized hubs come into our shop time and time again.  It's a good idea to check your tire pressure throughout the trip as well.    Also look at the rims to make sure the lugnut aren't causing problems.  You will see wear marks around them if they have loosened off.    Make sure you have good spares for both the truck and trailer.    Keep an eye on your temp guages.  Don't blast the a/c up a hill while the truck is working hard.  Make sure you are in tow/haul mode while on anything other than a flat surface. As long as you keep your fluids in check throughout the trip. Things should be ok.

Trucking,38dpg2,bassnote1,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:51:45 2015 UTC,"Gear down as you go up a steep grade if you have an automatic (you have no choice in a manual). If your tranny keeps shifts you run the chance of burning it up. Then, drop one more gear at the top if you have another grade to go down on the other side, maybe two if it's a steeper grade. This will keep your brakes cool (if you even have to use them) and prevent brake fade or possibly a fire. Also, make sure your brake controller is set up so your trailer comes on a bit faster than your truck brakes. You'll feel them tug on your truck as you apply the brakes."
Trucking,38dpg2,zombie4374,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:03:58 2015 UTC,is this beyond the capacity of electric brakes? the trailer is a triple axel with brakes on each axel
Trucking,38dpg2,zombie4374,3,Wed Jun 3 16:35:43 2015 UTC,"Your brakes will be fine as long as they are in good working condition.  Just don't ride the brakes down the hill. Let the tranny do the work. You will still need to brake, just use them in intervals.  Not the whole way down the hill"
Trucking,38dpg2,zombie4374,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"so gear down and let the trans eat it, and just watch the trans temp? use the brakes second, in pulses?"
Trucking,38dpg2,DR_JDUBZ,2,Wed Jun 3 17:16:12 2015 UTC,Your temp will heat up going up hill. Down shouldn't affect them.  But if you are in the right gear going downhill and if the truck is newer the computer will know it's going downhill and shift accordingly.   You can still use the brakes don't be scared of that.  But if the brakes are on all the way down the hill they will fry.  The truck should do most of the work in the right gear.  Take it for a test drive down a few hills in town before you go.  You'll get the hang of it.    If the speed limit is 60/mph down the hill.  Do 40 to start.  Play around a bit.  Just don't start the hill at top speed.
Trucking,38dpg2,DR_JDUBZ,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:25:12 2015 UTC,"Not pulses really. If you find the truck speeding up. Use the brakes to slow down 10 to 15 mph or so and let off. Once it picks up again, brake again.  If you are constantly doing more braking than coasting slow down and gear down again."

Trucking,38dpg2,dkyleb,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:54:46 2015 UTC,"It'll be fine, just make sure they are in good order and set up properly. You want to use your brakes as little as possible down a steep grade. Proper set up will help keep your trailer behind you in a braking situation. Your trailer, loaded, will out-weigh your truck and it will push it if your truck brakes are doing more work than the trailer brakes, so you 'balance' the braking so the trailer is doing slightly more work than the truck. And watch your speed!"

The data is unlimited but only gives you 2.5gigs of 4G speed then they lower it to 3G. You can buy plans that offer more gigs of fast speed but 2.5 is enough for me.

Sprint gets a bad rap & its mostly unjustified, their service is fine, if it weren't, believe me, I would have jumped ship long ago, internet is too important to me, especially unlimited."

If you leave at some point before X you'll be on the hook for some or all of the company sponsored school's fee.  Typically folks here, and other places, recommend in order: community college, private school, then company sponsored. Community colleges in many states have affordable programs that train you thoroughly. Private schools are variable in their training quality, choose wisely. Lastly, company sponsored programs are quick, and just thorough enough to get you driving and earning for the company. They're not entirely bad, and are a good recourse for folks that may not be able to get the tuition together but can get a few hundred dollars saved to cover the slight expenses that the company does not.

Eases eye fatigue at night, no more turning on the bright white light to do literally anything in the cab, and personally I really feel like they help keep me awake in the wee hours of the night. I can put up some pictures of anyone is interested.  Secondly, a cb. Yes, your phone and gps have traffic and weather updates, but nothing beats the first hand account of just exactly wtf is going on.  Third, if your truck doesn't come equipped with one, a satellite radio. Invaluable piece of equipment in my opinion. No more channel surfing every half hour, many sports programs, and commercial free music.  fourth, if you're going to charge your phone on the road, don't use a car charger as they don't actually give it a full charge. Worst case, get a small power inverter that plugs in to the cig lighter and then plug a house charger into that. Works much better.  Lastly, I highly highly highly recommend getting yourself hooked up with a 1200+ watt power inverter and then outfitting your sleeper with both a true refrigerator and a microwave. make sure the fridge is compete with compressor and refrigerant, not just a thermo electric cooler"

If I would turn the fridge down past 4 out of 10 it would start to put ice crystals in my water bottles.  Might not be the best idea for all, but for me it was beyond expectations. My issue with the 12 volt thermo electric coolers is that they don't cool down as well as a real fridge.

Waiting, waiting, and more waiting is part of it.  And that gets worse when you're trying to meet deadlines and what is holding you up is beyond your control. Annoying fourwheelers are everywhere.  Just go with the idea that they will do the most dangerous, egotistical, and suicidal thing you can imagine and you won't be as surprised as often.  Keep at it, tenacity pays in trucking."

I'm in the same basic type of lease but better, and it's not going well.  You have to get a buck and a quarter a mile (plus fuel surcharge) to make a lease work where there's $1100ish in fixed costs per week.  Better yet, get 70% or so of the money the client pays the truck, plus fuel surcharge."
Trucking,387p5j,adventure_dog,2,Tue Jun 2 17:48:02 2015 UTC,"Good Ol' England my friend and I went there, I went company and he fell for their lease b.s. They gave me enough miles so I could eat, pay my phone bill, and a storage unit because I couldn't afford to continue paying rent. Two months after my 6 month contract was up they told me that I could no longer be a company driver and not train students. My options were to train students or lease a truck, they thought I was still under contract and thought I could be pressured into those options, So I left.  My friend on the other hand leased a truck so he could be a solo driver, he ended up having to borrow money from his parents so he could move back in with them.  As a lease driver his miles were so few that he would be in the negative almost every week unless he trained. When he did train his take home barely made up for the weeks that he ran negative."

Welcome to the world of being an OTR truck driver. It's nothing but hurry up and wait. You wait to fuel, you wait to get loaded, you wait to get unloaded, you wait to sleep, you wait to shower, your wait to eat, you wait to see your family, you wait to get the truck fixed, and unfortunately at England, you'll be waiting on a paycheck.

And sometimes the valves would stick...OPEN! So if you weren't paying real close attention when you pulled a cap off you could get soaked with this shit.

Trucking,386n12,x505,5,Tue Jun 2 05:54:21 2015 UTC,"No, interviewing for local driving jobs are similar to interviewing for other non-driving jobs. If you don't have any experience driving they may be very difficult to land. Local jobs deal a great deal more with backing, traffic, dock parking, tight spots, etc etc... instead of mostly driving on the interstate. So they tend to look for someone who has a year or two of experience under their belt.  As far as questions they will ask, they are mostly concerned with cdl driving experience, driving record, personal appearance (in a lot of cases) and your ability to deal with other-end personnel if you are doing food service or end-drop ltl. If you are doing line haul or warehouse to warehouse they may not be so concerned about your people skills.  Prepare yourself for the good possibility that you might have to settle for 6 months or more of OTR to get your foot in the door."
Trucking,386n12,eog_prod,3,Tue Jun 2 06:16:56 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at two jobs right now. One being line haul (Old Dominion Freight Line) or the other being hauling grease / animal by-product (Valley Proteins).   Other local companies here would definitely need a year or two experience but somehow I stumbled upon these and say they take recent graduates from accredited/approved schools and I'm just hoping mine is one.   I wouldn't be against OTR though, it was actually my first plan but I thought if I could land something local then why not, ya know?  Thank you very much for the reply! I wasn't nervous about the interview but like I said it's good to know what I'd get into beforehand and I definitely feel more confident."
Trucking,386n12,eog_prod,5,Tue Jun 2 07:01:46 2015 UTC,"Old Dominion would be a good starting local program. I've heard nothing but good things about them. Their safety record keeps them well off the ""dumbass radar"" and I encounter very few issues with them personally on the road (14 years). From what I hear they also have excellent benefits and their tractor/trailer experience is transferable. That would be my choice if I were to go local and I had that opportunity."

Trucking,386n12,Nigelpennyworth,3,Tue Jun 2 06:27:13 2015 UTC,Just depends on the company. In my experience with both of the local jobs I've had they ran the hiring process like a company would for otr. The thing with trucking is personality aside they sort of have records of what kind of employee you are so the typical go getter type questions don't normally come up.

Not sure if they take new drivers, but I worked for them before and it's a good company ( just didn't pay well enough for me), but it is local and is easy work(at least I thought it was). Also to answer your question, I never had much of an interview at any of my driving jobs, just how much experience do you have and what's your driving record like.

There's a thousand web pages on how much of a scam lease purchase is but you went ahead and did it anyway, new to an industry you know nothing about, and you still haven't learned your lesson.   There is no good lease-purchase for newbies. The entire idea of lease-purchase is a scam so that Prime, CRE, Schnieder, etc, can write off a bunch of stuff and up their profits.

I do. Leasing in most cases is a no win situation at all for the driver. Go to another lease company and have the same headaches. I saw recently a list of success & completion rates for a lot of companies lease programs and it wasnt a pretty picture. The highest rated ones weren't your typical fleece programs like Prime and CRE but ones where you actually have to put money down & do a credit check, not that credit has to be great as long as your willing to put enough down. Also the people you mention doing $1,500 per week still have to pay taxes and they, as you know have the added risk. My gross pay is $1,500 if I run 2,941 miles which I do regularly and zero headache or worry. Im not trying to knock those that do choose to lease and I sincerely hope it works out for everyone that tries it but the sad reality is, it doesn't in most cases."

Six weeks road training, then either .45 a mile dryvan, .48 reefer.  Dry sounds better actually...less detention.  Company driver, no lease.  Not bad at all.   Roehl will take me as a flatbed guy, pretty quickly.  Fastest path to good money, but 90 days before I could take a rider (wife).  Although, wife is considering spring her CDL this summer... and all these companies love husband and wife teams."
Trucking,385r6u,eloquencefails,3,Wed Jun 3 00:19:45 2015 UTC,"Hey man! Yes, go flatbed, go Prime! It may blow chunks that you'd end up away from your girl (I was too, for the whole training phase, not just the team driving part), but it's worth it a helluva lot more than getting a few weeks in.   In six weeks or less, you see maybe a third of the loads you would get flatbedding otherwise. You may take ten loads of lumber, six loads of steel coils, five roofing shingles, and two pipe in that time. The first day on your own, you'd end up getting a load of Cats, or a scissor lift and truck, or foam insulate. Hell, there's a chance you may only rip your tarps out twice in them six weeks. I haven't used mine in close to seven. I regularly forget they're up there!   Point is, if you're concerned with the whole three month deal, it's actually 30k miles. You may be out for two and a half if you and your trainer get along, drive hard, and make good selective routes. If your trainer is out for money and a power trip, call in and ask for a new trainer. Get a new trainer. Your dispatch might tell you you'll never get one and to suck it up, don't take that shit from him. We have enough terminals that getting a new trainer isn't hard at all.   Anyway, rant. Sorry. Yeah! You'll learn a fuckton more in months than you would weeks. Finish up training, run for long enough to become a PSD trainer, get certed, train your wife, take the TNT class while she's testing out and finishing up her PSD work, train her TNT, and roll in the miles and money. Team driving a lease op would let you guys run a brand-new KW or Pete, it would be easier to pay off your school pay and equipment pay, and you'd get to cherry pick loads more often as team lease.   Think about this too. Running Prime, our rigs are all unique. Fuck going Roehl, or Crete. Prime'll let you customize yours. Especially Lease op (or in your case, you could apply for lease purchase and buy the damn thing, then really pull it in when you finish the payments), you can pick the decals, colors, put your name on the damn thing, anything you want. No two trucks are alike. Sets us apart from the other big guys. You'll see a reefer guy, completely white Freightliner, black Assassin's Creed and Dragon Age logos, red underglow, black rims. Another gal, reefer too, runs a completely purple/pink rig, with multi-color polka dots all over it. Hell, mine is all black with band stickers, Decepticon logos, and pentagrams on it. This makes it yours. When you park out at a terminal, you'll see the variety. It's awesome. :D  Anyway, I'm gushing. Go for it! And if they make you team with ""Team Rob"", tell that guy to fuck off and get someone else. Fuck that guy."
Trucking,385r6u,00stephen,2,Wed Jun 3 03:52:07 2015 UTC,"Do you know what kind of truck I really, really want?  A 2007 Freightliner Argosy full sleeper, with a wheelbase similar to any normal OTR rig, and a secondary sleeper grafted on containing a kitchen, dining room, shower and toilet.  For the bed use the original Argosy bed setup.  The Argosy is the last and best of the American cabovers.  Because the bridge is basically over the motor it's shorter, but instead of running a short wheelbase, run a normal wheelbase and get what is basically a fully self contained RV rig without the overlength, overweight problems those ""extended sleeper"" rigs normally have.  I tend to modify cars, motorcycles, computers and guns in very, very weird ways.  I don't give a damn about the paint job or lights, I care about functionality even if it looks kinda ""Mad Max-esque"".

That can't happen until I get enough experience to go with a company that lets you run ""weird shit"", such as Landstar or the like.  If it passes DOT it's all good there :).  With Prime I have another problem.  I can't pick from a load board...it's normal dispatched runs.  Normally not a problem but my wife will be in California for about four or five months next year finishing a degree.  With something like Landstar or Schneider's Choice, I get to pick whatever runs I want off of a large board, and since Cali isn't real popular I could shift to working there no sweat.  If I finish out the current six-month ""shit sandwich lease"" I'm in now I'd be qualified for Schneider Choice...65% of the line haul isn't quite as good as the 72% at Prime but in my case the extra flexibility might make the difference.  That said, I wish to hell I'd gone to Prime right off the bat.  Seriously.  They appear to be the best starter company out there.  My wife is thinking if I try and run balls-out in the current lease I can pull in enough for us to survive that.  I can also train her on the road towards the end of that, and then ALL these companies have a huge liking for husband/wife teams.  That might actually get us into something really, really cool.  So, I'm going to try and run the current lease hard, turn down every craptastic multi-drop load, see if I can pull 3,100 miles or more out of them so we can survive this turd.  But the reefer detentions are going to make that really, really hard..."

Almost every run they do is from coast to coast so their weekly miles are pretty insane. Biggest downside to that is we do have to set aside a fairly hefty amount for taxes but otherwise it's working out well for us.  I understand our situation is a little different from yours in that you aren't teaming, but just thought I'd share our own experience with one particular leasing route.  Before my fiancé signed on, the guy he's teaming with was solo lease-op and still did pretty well for himself.    Best of luck to you!  Hope you find something that works out better for you."

So that really is a decent setup...only 5% off from Landstar, really, and Landstar is really hard to get into.  If I had six months in I'd probably go with them."

Trucking,385r6u,sledge07,2,Tue Jun 2 12:14:23 2015 UTC,"Where are you located? Are you in the US or Canada?  Can you walk away from your lease (is it short term leasing) or have you signed long term?  If you have signed short term, do walk away when your lease is over. Paying that much is insane.   If it is long term and lease-to-own well, here is what I would do:  1) Ask for the payout, which is the amount you would be required to pay to own the truck today. Hopefully, the finance company will not ask you for full interest + capital but only capital and a penalty.  2) Shop for a loan for that amount. Scores of company will finance you, even if you are a startup. I agree, the interest rate will still be high because you are a startup but at least the amortization will be on 3-5 years, which will reduce your monthly payment. I am not here to make any ad, but if you want some names, I'll give you some.  Note that if you go this way, you will be responsible for maintenance. Your variable fee will be removed but you will need to pay for everything on the truck. That's what you call a lease program without maintenance.  If it is a long term full lease program (i.e. you lease the truck and pay maintenance but won't own it at the end), well look in the contract to see if you have any 'exit door'. Have you personally guaranteed the contract or is it only with your company (assuming that you have incorporated).  Source: I work for a finance company in the trucking industry..."

Trucking,384wj4,eyesofglass,6,Mon Jun 1 21:46:50 2015 UTC,"One of the biggest gotchas is New York City.  A sub-4"" blade pocketknife is ""legal"" but the cops have come up with their own rule whereby if they can flick it open with a very hard (and expert) snap of the wrist, it's a ""gravity knife"" and felony.  The courts have allowed them to get away with this.  Concealed carry of this class of pocketknife is legal so most of us recommend keeping it 100% hidden - if the wrong cop sees a pocket clip and demands to ""test"" it, and he knows how to do a hard snap, you're looking at a felony.  Owch.  By and large though, a sub-4"" (measured as ""stabbing penetration depth"") lockblade with a thumb stud or thumb hole is legal across the US, with very very rare exceptions.  If it is ""spring assisted"" but not a true switchblade the odds of trouble go up - Maryland for example has a problem with those."

Trucking,384wj4,BarkingLeopard,2,Tue Jun 2 00:26:02 2015 UTC,"I am a major, major gun nut.  I'm not taking it on the truck in the situation I'm in now but I have America's weirdest carry gun (and quite possibly the world's most heavily modified revolver, complete with magazine feeding and automatic gas-operated shell ejection).  http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2014/03/03/maurice-frankenruger-magazine-fed-revolver/"
Trucking,384wj4,JimMarch,2,Tue Jun 2 00:52:29 2015 UTC,"Damn. That is absolutely insane. I am not sure I understand the details, but... Revolver in 9 mm, auto ejector for spent brass, and a tubular magazine to add 9 more shots.  Could you take it a step further and add a cylinder on the left to hold 5 or 6 tubular magazines, instead of just allowing for one? The idea would be that once one tubular magazine is emptied, the cylinder that holds the tubular mags would rotate a fresh mag into place. I know that would screw the balance of the gun, and make it impossible to holster, but imagine being able to shoot a 50 round box of ammo from a revolver without reloader.  Thanks, very impressed."
Trucking,384wj4,BarkingLeopard,2,Tue Jun 2 02:01:11 2015 UTC,"The feed cycle is a little bit like a captured Nazi prototype 20mm autocannon that had a five-shot cylinder and single barrel:  http://www.ww2aircraft.net/forum/attachments/weapons-systems-tech-/217211d1354087406t-revolver-cannon-design-canon_revolver_mauser_mg_213_ani-1.gif  As you can see there's a mechanical ""rammer"" that crammed rounds into the back of the cylinder and a mechanical gas-operated extractor.  My design is simpler: I'm using a spring-loaded tube mag to cram new rounds in (two in my short 3"" long ""carry mag"" and nine in my pair of foot-long reload mags).  These top off five in the cylinder and once the cylinder runs dry and an empty chamber passes in front of the mag, mag-feeding begins - with auto switchover basically between normal cylinder feeding and mag feeding.  Ejection uses the gas pressure of the firing chamber to eject the previously fired shell in the sequence - not the firing shell!  One consequence is, I have to carry it ""hammer on empty"" so that on cocking it for the first shot there's an empty chamber at the auto-eject position.  If I had it set up any other way the first firing shot would spit a live shell out the back!  Ooops.  So with the first shot ""dry"" it's still used - that gas pressure causes the upper half of the loading gate to fall down if it isn't already, allowing ejection of the rest of the shells.  (The upper stage of the loading gate is there to keep the last cylinder-fed round in the gun while it's in the holster.)  I was halfway through the build when somebody else pointed out that Mauser design.  After the war the US adopted that design in the autoannons on early jet fighters like the F86 Sabrejet of the Korean War era as the M39 Pontiac.  Like the M39 and the Mauser, ""Maurice"" shows serious reliability as the ammo feed path is dead straight.  I can't get it to jam, it'll feed empty shells no sweat, doesn't care about overall length, etc."

However, there may be some hot shot opportunities available, just look around. Yes, if you go to a good school, they will teach you the basics of driving tractor trailers. Shifting and backing are taught as well as how to properly do pre trip inspections, how to maneuver big trucks in traffic, etc. CB radios are sadly not used as much as they used to be. Everyone has cell phones now and drivers just don't watch each other's backs like they used to. They still sell them though, I have one and will always have one, they are a good tool to get info on weather, traffic, accidents ahead of you and sometimes directions to a shipper or receiver.

There are some trucking companies that have their own schools, but I haven't heard good things about most of them. That doesn't mean they are all bad though. I went to a private school and paid for it myself, through their financing. It was expensive (at least to me at the time) $3,500. But going that route, I wasn't tied to any one company.

It comes across as stupid but it's actually different levels of insanity. Our method of measuring those levels is flawed in the fact that the observations are subjected to the perspective of the observant. There is no offset that can be made for these different levels of insanity except on a very basic level in which only the severely disabled (mentally and physically) and immature are excluded.

Trucking,3819kf,eog_prod,3,Mon Jun 1 15:20:31 2015 UTC,"Also, as a psych hobbyist I have found that driving behavior is seldom a result of lack of intelligence, but rather the result of one's mental capabilities directly relating to the health and well being of the psyche.   I 100% agree.  To counter it, I think we should educate every 4 wheeler, about how it is more of a battle between them and themselves, and to truly reduce collisions and injuries we all need to do better at policing ourselves.  Then once we educate them, we can enforce it."

It was at a local community college and the cost for EVERYTHING including state exam fees, books, medical exam was only about $800. They had a course that was shorter but figured slow and steady would be fine by me.  My response is going to be quite vague but I've seen other posts on here and prices vary greatly. Anywhere from $800 to a few thousand and the time it takes to finish could take anywhere from a few months to a week or two.   From what I've heard, the best route to go through is a local community college."
Trucking,380vxu,x505,3,Mon Jun 1 01:18:14 2015 UTC,"I can't help you on cost because I've been in it over 20 years. Trucks are a hard and thankless way to make a living. And I love doing it. Local is better than long haul in some ways and seems to pay better, but is harder to find. There are so many that would take advantage of you and you have to put up with it for a while. Then, after you have the experience and have a solid history, you can write your own ticket to some extent."

Trucking,380vxu,Timecook,2,Mon Jun 1 02:10:00 2015 UTC,"Cost varies on your area. Try to find a FMCSA accredited school if you can.  Try to avoid letting any company pay for your training. It can range from $1000 to $5000 and take a month to a year. Each state had their own minimum requirements and every school operates differently.   I'll tell you what I tell anyone who includes how they enjoy driving or their past experience towing as reasons they might like the job... You've not yet experienced a shitty dispatcher, shipper, receiver, or any of the thousands of DOT rules and regulations. First year pay is rarely above 35k no matter how much you drive.   But if you suffer through a shitty first year the job really opens up. Just don't hit anything."

Trucking,380vxu,emersonlakeandlagoon,4,Mon Jun 1 02:03:42 2015 UTC,"Well yeah we've all dealt with shitty people. What I mean is, these shitty people directly impact your pay and there's little and sometimes nothing you can do about it. You may get lucky and land a good gig, that does happen also. But you won't escape the shitty shippers and receivers. And you'll be living in a small confined space.  You'll sometimes have to sleep in sketchy places or in a ship yard somewhere. Most times you'll sleep in a piss stained rest area or truck stop (though I do like me a nice new Flying J). You'll be alone and spend a lot of time wondering why people in cars everyone is so incredibly stupid. Radio gets old fast, for me at least, and I've had to get creative to stave off the tunnel.  One of the first things you'll have to kick is the idea that enjoying to drive a car will translate into enjoying to drive a truck. It may work out that way for you, it did for me, but I've seen people who dived in with that mentality only to realize the water was actually silly puddy. You've got to read every sign, especially ones you never bothered to see before like bridge height, max weights, and no trucks. Not to mention navigating the whole thing like an elephant in a slalom race.   I just like to spritz a little cold water on the excitement in hopes of chipping away a bit of the golden veneer some companies, websites, and wanted ads surgically coat this industry with.    It's not a job, really, it's a lifestyle. At least until you get a daycab job."

Trucking,3800hb,f4s1ght,5,Sun May 31 21:01:05 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are doing what I ended up doing, albeit accidentally.  I couldn't find a job either when I graduated, and had to pick between wiping butts at a nursing home, driving a truck, or moving back in with mommy.  I definitely made the right choice - living on the road was probably the most fun I have ever had.  Judging by what you posted, it sounds like you might be able to make a go at trucking.  Even if it is only a temporary thing.    When you are researching CDL classes, the only really major thing to watch out for is the price.  Plus you need to make sure it's actually a legitimate business, as some carriers absolutely require rookies to have a degree from an actual CDL course.  Something something insurance companies require it.  Some do help you with job placement, but most of the time that just involves them handing you a stack of applications to fill out that they will fax out for you.  There is a permanent demand for new blood in this industry, so if you have a clean criminal record and driving record, any company that hires rookies will be calling you.   I'm not exaggerating on that point.  When I went through my class, I filled out 34 applications.  I got 35 job offers.  I guess one of them heard about me through the grapevine!  Just be sure to do your homework and pick a good company to start out with.  Some carriers will expect you to work for pocket change, and they'll convince you that you're being overpaid if you aren't careful."

Everything else went to loans and once I dug in they were gone in a year.  I started with usa truck.  They pay for training, give you some spending money and guarantee a job if you pass.  A lot of guys knock them but they did everything they said they would, went out of their way a couple times to make things work for me, and when something got seriously fucked up I was able to find someone higher up the chain that put in the work to make it right.  They got a new general manager after I started and by the time I left there were noticeable improvements.  biggest thing wherever you go (other than safe and proper operation) is to learn how things work, know when to bite the bullet and when to put your foot down.   I'd say go for it - even after you leave keep your cdl, always keep a clean record.  Play it right and if you move on from driving you can have the assurance that if things go south you can pick up the phone and have a 70,000 dollar job tomorrow."

I think you should go for it.  I've always been obsessed with trucking but kind of fell into normal job and family life.  Unless things change radically in my personal life I'm probably not going to have a chance to try trucking. A part of me will always wonder, what if? and wish that I had tried it when I was younger.  Who knows, it could be a good career for you. Good luck"
Trucking,3800hb,JimMarch,1 point,Sun May 31 21:32:00 2015 UTC,"If you're careful with the company you pick, you can make decent money your first year.  And then you can make kickass money your second and maybe third years, and THEN bail if you want to with as much as a quarter mil saved up if you do everything right, based on a combination of earnings plus selling the truck you bought at year two or three for the remaining equity.  OK.  First thing is, your first year of trucking you're considered a newbie and your insurance costs are higher.  So you get in with a ""starter grade"" company that deals with that reduction in their income by paying you less.  You can't go independent yet (run on your own authority, potentially one of the routes to huge cash) because one, you don't know WTF you're doing yet and two, the insurance costs would eat you alive.  I'm going to post more on what all these options look like in a day or two, to answer some questions from a friend.  One question for you: do you have experience as a mechanic, at least at an amateur level?  Doesn't have to be diesel or big-motor grade - cars, motorcycles, whatever, anything helps.  Helps you two ways actually: makes passing the ""pre-trip"" portion of the license training process easier, and then if you end up buying a truck with about 500,000 miles on it for about $50k or so you can keep it alive longer and cheaper than somebody with zero wrench-turning experience.  You can also understand the technical points as you research exactly what to buy.  Your biggest hurdle, BY FAR, is avoiding being scammed on going into your first company.  There's some bad, bad players out there...serious predator companies set up to eat newbies alive and leave them shattered and broke within six months while they go on to the next sucker.

I've been driving class 4 to 6 trucks for 20 years and never had a mishap that was in any way my fault, and am not scared in the least to drive them. I'm building one of the best trucks in my particular business, and the added safety of a backup camera doesn't make me scared of anything. I can park at a dock just fine without a camera, but I'm not a delivery driver. This will be a working truck and will often be maneuvering in areas with people. A backup camera is totally appropriate.   Seems like there are a lot of old timers here who don't like newfangled contraptions like cameras."

One ""gotcha"" - it will work a bit better if you're doing lease-op or owner-op status as opposed to company driver.  Why?  Because as a company driver you can't go off-route.  And she's going to want to :).  Movie once in a while, dinner at someplace where the plate isn't paper, ""ohhh, I wanna see THAT"" and if you have time and the fuel bill isn't crazy, why not?  I got stuck waiting for a load for five hours in Dodge City Kansas.  Turns out She grew up on ""Gunsmoke"" plus I'm an expert on old-school guns in a weird way so... guess what we went and did?  Etc.  Worth a gallon or two of dead dinosaurs.  From the digging I've done, the only newbie lease-op deal I would recommend is something like Prime - you get paid 70% of the line haul rate and 100% of the fuel surcharge.  Don't get a truck with a Paccar motor from 'em - Freightliner with a DD13 motor rocks for mileage.  You can make $1500 a week fairly easily.  Don't do a lease deal for a buck a mile or less, you'll seriously regret it like I am now.  Sigh."

It's great loading buncha tiny coils right against the front wall of the stepdeck, or taking a buttload of ACs. Pulling outta York always yeilds tiny ACs. :D   Go skate, man!

He's getting 72% of the line haul rate, at 2,800 hours a week he takes home around $1,500...and that's reefer, he can do even better flatbed.  I'd like to run Prime flatbed."
Trucking,37xozw,JimMarch,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:22:44 2015 UTC,"Do it, man! I fuckin' love flatbedding. My TNT trainer is solo lease now, and he turns a fucking awesome profit.   If you came over, especially as lease op, expect to be seated in a 2016 EVO. Mine's a '15, and if I pull Trane or York ACs, M3 or Dow Chem foam, or other light junk, I can usually get +12 mpg. It seriously add up.   And our safety rating usually lets us slide right by scales. I get pulled in... Once every two weeks? It happens so little, I expect I'm being pulled in for a rando and not for weight.   And flatbed works with round numbers and even distribution. 40k on spread axles, center light determines center of trailer, slide your fifth wheel all the way back. I've only had to have my load adjusted once, and it was more good ol' TechEq being neurotic. :D None of that sliding tandems/fifth wheel/getting some filthy lumper pesant to adjust it, pallet by pallet.   All this translates into saving active time for the road, more miles under your tires, and more grease in your wallet than you can shake a stick at.

Unless you can get in with a city and drive the sewage pump truck or something similar you're bound to work from start until whenever. The thing I don't like is just because a driver can work 14 hours a day it doesn't mean he wants to or should have to. Companies just don't get this. Even driving local dump truck you'll work as long as the pits are open and the construction is being done. Power trucks require you to also be an electrician and they don't work normal hours either.

On the trucking side, you've got management pulling their hair out because they have drivers they can work 14 hours a day and are not allowed to. They don't know from compensation. On the other side, you've got management who get paid to control expenses. They are more used to dealing with office and warehouse people.

Stalling is normal when you're first learning but I don't think it should happen once you've got 1-2 years.

I work in freight payment, and as the nerdiest and most insatiatiably-curious person in the department, I am absolutely fascinated by all things freight.

The chain of events will go like this: We cover the repairs, our insurance will pay us back after they go after the insurance of the reefer company who will go after the insurance of the O/O who is ultimately responsible. Once they get a hold of the O/O, the CHP will have a talk with him as well.    Talking to the responding officer, once we get video from Flying J, and if it shows our guy chasing the rig and him blowing at least the stop sign that's within camera range.

Put your emergency flashers on anytime you pull over day or night.  If you are just checking straps, you check them and go.    If you are broke down you are going to put out triangles (day) flares (night).    They put the variable ""night"" in each question. It didn't change the outcome in question 4 but it did in 5 because of the ability to see at night is diminished so you slow down (speed limit changes in some places at night).   Rested doesn't have anything to do with night.  Rested is night or day.  The positive out of this is, you are studying and going back and rethinking the choices which is more than most of the other motorists out there are doing and you will be competing for a lane with them in  traffic every day so you always want to out think them- not the test."

I told them none just the school with a 28ft trailer, they gave me a road test on a 53footer and I guess they felt that I had potential cause they offered me the job. I though that was awesome, no BS questions that other jobs do and It's local too!"

Trucking,37qtpd,twist3d7,7,Mon Jun 1 18:33:49 2015 UTC,"That's going on the extreme side to fire you over that, I've seen people at England smash the nose of their truck into walls on dedicated accounts and keep their jobs.  Had a guy a couple months ago take out a light pole on government property and they still work for us.   ""but we have people do this all the time!""   I get told that all the time when it's actually smaller box trucks going in, last year I had a delivery on one of those steep hills in San Francisco a semi wasn't going to go up or down that hill and they tried pulling that on me.   I Know what kind of places youre talking about theyre doable with a sleeper as long as you use all of the space available to you and sometimes you have to rock your truck back and forth to make the turn. Sometimes the places need a truck to go in during 10 pm and 5 am because there isn't enough room.   I drive nights with a day cab and there's a couple stops that I need to use the entire road to get in and they're not getting a truck in after 6 am.  With that said all the dedicated accounts I've been on the companies have always sent me out to ride along on the first run or two, and I've taken new guys out on their first runs. It's the safe thing to do, talk to your safety department or   aproppriate department because you could still have a job there, if not put in applications you'll get a job somewhere.  I have a friend that gets into at least 1 accident a year he's ripped off trailer doors, set the trailer on fire, ripped off the fairings, and the bumper. Somehow he still drives a truck."

When I first started driving, I did city p&d into some of the worst hell holes imaginable.  Sometimes, it took me a long time to get parked and most of that time I was out of the truck checking my clearance to all of the obstacles.    I've scratched a few poles, cracked a fender on a tractor, put cuts in trailers and one day I also got caught up on a leaning chain link fence (I unhooked and used the tractor to straighten it, and they thanked me!).  I've dropped a couple of trailers, ripped off glad hands, broke the electrical several times on sharp turns, bent the hinges on a trailer door, jumped the fifth wheel a few times, killed several chock blocks, ripped off mudflaps, broke in half many hand cranks.  I've had several tires blow including a steer tire.  Got stuck in the snow/mud many, many times.  One day, I tug tested too hard a very rusty chassis with a really heavy loaded container and broke 2 leg supports and bent the whole leg.  I didn't even need to fill out a cry sheet on that one, a toplift and 2 shunt trucks came and the container was moved onto a new chassis and the old chassis disappeared.  It's been 13 years of mayhem.  This job will forever test you and you'll never know what will happen next.  Don't sweat the small stuff, just keep on truckin'."

I was wishing and hoping that I'd get the other two on my test. I figured I had a great chance of not getting it because 2 beats 1, right?  No. I end up getting the sight side and I knew I was fucked. We had practiced a few days before and I could not get it for the life of me. I felt hopeless and sad at the fact that I just lost my $200.  I had passed my straight line and offset with 0 points so I knew I had some points to mess around with and at least try my hardest and just hope some miracle happened even though I had no idea how to perform it correctly.   Each time I messed up the maneuver, I would pull up, circle around and restart. I learned from my mistakes and tried different things where I knew failed the last time.   I had already used my two get outs so I was feeling really shit out of luck at this point. Must've pulled up 5 or 6 times and encroached once or twice. I knew my points were reaching max but I kept going at it until I was told to stop.   I ended up circling around for what I thought was one of my last attempts and it just worked. I don't know how but I put the truck in the box perfectly. I did not have to pull up or anything. I never knew how close I was to failing on my maneuvers but somehow I passed and I did well on my other tests.

Trucking,37npsx,gnaunited,4,Fri May 29 00:20:36 2015 UTC,"The old saying is ""The best way to earn a million in trucking is to start with two million."" I know guys who make money but they really watch their numbers and make sure everything is done correctly. It's not easy and the market is constantly changing. A good friend of mine has a produce hauling company that he does well with and they've been at it several years. The freight rates on produce has dropped a lot this year though with all the droughts (this is info from him so I don't know first hand) and now they are really penny pinching to make it through.   In the very least you should get a couple more years under your belt before making the plunge. Maybe even try a couple different segments (van, reefer, flatbed, etc.) or at least those you are most interested in. Also pay careful attention to the freight in your area (both ways) and see what sort of niche you can fill. For instance, my company takes a ton of little 150-200 loss no one else wants. They pickup one day and deliver the next with a gob of downtime so OTR drivers want no part of them. We go home though so it works for us and several of those loads a week really add up.   Just my thoughts."
Trucking,37npsx,goldenkazoo,4,Fri May 29 02:05:48 2015 UTC,"Small fleet owner here. I'd say 20k is on the low end of the amount I'd want to start out. Definitely not enough for a proper safety net. Having a new MC number isn't really as bad as people make it out to be. You need to get the in on some local shippers that will keep you consistent with freight at least leaving your home base area. Back loads are almost always from brokers, but you can make so much more finding a few reliable shippers to directly pull for. Insurance costs are ridiculous, so be ready for that. ""Have a business model"" is obviously the textbook answer to what you need, but you'll find that the real-life world of owning a transportation company is anything but textbook.   I'd really recommend working as an O/O for at least a year or two. You'd learn a lot and risk a lot less."
Trucking,37npsx,Steamster,3,Fri May 29 04:18:19 2015 UTC,"My advice - and full disclosure, I work in operations for an owner operator company, but truly think this isn't biased - if youre going to buy a truck, is to come on with a company who specializes in o/o's for a while.  That way you will truly learn first hand what you can expect out of the gig even when you transition to running under your own authority.  You'll learn lanes you prefer, what repairs really look like, what fuel really looks like, what kind of miles you need to earn a good paycheck etc. etc. .. just so many things.  Next I think if you find success in that, then consider maybe working entirely for yourself and you'll need to tackle the question of where to find customers... Can't make a living hauling brokered freight.  This will also give you time to put more money away.  Waiting on payments all while fronting fuel and repairs requires quite a bit of capital."
Trucking,37npsx,loggjammin,1 point,Fri May 29 03:48:06 2015 UTC,"So much this, from what I can tell.   In the best of these sorts of companies (Landstar is a great example but they don't take newbies) you get 70% off the truck's basic income, 100% of the fuel surcharge.  In exchange for that 30% loss you get to use their trailers, a fuel discount, group rates on insurance and a killer loadboard.  I think that stuff is worth 30%, easy.  All you have to do is walk in with a truck and experience.   A year's experience is a must with Landstar, but there seem to be decent smaller alternatives along the same lines. I intend to try for that after finishing a crappy six-month lease I'm on now.   Also - OP, if you're gonna own your own truck or will help I'd you have some chops as a mechanic. Doesn't have to be heavy diesel, anything helps if you can fix minor shit on the road."
Trucking,37npsx,JimMarch,3,Fri May 29 14:49:48 2015 UTC,Down payment? 20k will buy you a decent pre-emissions truck. Another 5 to 10k for repairs and it will make you money for years if you drive it right.
Trucking,37npsx,ohmygodbees,2,Fri May 29 10:05:45 2015 UTC,The first thing you need to start a owner/operator trucking business is work.  Don't buy a truck unless you have work lined up for it that pencils out.  So many bottom tier trucking gigs for o/o are break even at best.  Keep in mind it is easy to spend 10k-25k on major repairs.  Fuel is expensive and you need to be able to cover it. Tires... etc.  Do your math.

And I can't tell him any different because that yearly gross number blinds him."
Trucking,37npsx,adventure_dog,2,Fri May 29 06:37:34 2015 UTC,This is the first question that needs answering before you do anything else:  What is your business model?
Trucking,37npsx,13speed,8,Fri May 29 00:57:10 2015 UTC,GET TRUCK. DRIVE. ??? PROFIT!!!!
Trucking,37npsx,cdnstuckindetroit,3,Fri May 29 01:38:44 2015 UTC,"I know you are being facetious, but that is the mentality of so many who are new to this industry.  Buying equipment is the absolutely last thing to do on the list, as it is almost the easiest thing to do. They sell trucks to anyone with a pulse.  When I decided to buy my first truck and work for myself, I started my business over a year before I made the equipment purchase, building credit, making contacts, saving my money."

Trucking,37npsx,thestraylightpun,2,Fri May 29 03:34:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely have a business model.  It's harder to get the better paying loads if you have a new MC#, and you don't want to run cheap freight all over the place just to break even every month.  I work at a factoring company (yes, the f word) and I see a lot of one truck operations fail, go out of service, or a number of other things because they didn't research what they were doing.  I've also seen a lot of drivers and o/o do a great job, grow their company, and now they're making a lot of money.  It's all about the contracts you can get, the business relationships you have, and if you do a good job or not."

Trucking,37lffb,Isotopi,2,Fri May 29 17:18:12 2015 UTC,"It's a different critter.  Here is a list of some of the things that are aggravating/different.   it takes a while to load since this stuff can't just sit on the dock waiting for you. speaking of docks! most hospitals are poorly designed for trucks.  An example is the VA in Baltimore.  It's the size of two city blocks has a staff of  2K sees 5k+ patients a day.   Has a dock for two trucks. And you have to take a one way alley with curbside parking to make a blind side 90. you won't be working with material clerks, lumpers, or dock managers.  It'll be nurses, sanitation janitors, and safety officers. remember the small docks?  If a food service truck is there before you, you have to wait for him to finish. if the EPA gets a wild hair they can inspect you and they will look at every package and every line on the manifest. despite what the regs say, you are ultimately liable in the event of an error responsible to ensure each package is properly packed, marked, and manifested.  That you have all the correct permits, have notified state DoT (when applicable), and what placards to use. disposal facilities come in two basic types.   One is reckless and haphazard: slinging boxes, wild fork truck drivers, rolling poly drums on their sides, etc.  The other is meticulous and places each package in a portable overpack and unloads one at a time.   Other than that, it's a ton of fun.  Here's a list of the some pleasant aspects.   some facilities use offsite accumulation/storage sites with wide open lots,  excellent docks, and limited public access. it's a niche part of transportation that is essential to hospitals, clinics, universities, and research centers. your trailer will be super clean on the inside. most DoT inspections are short and sweet. most of the customers are happy to see you and even happier to see you go.   A list of suggestions   get a refer if you are hauling bio mass waste.  The stink of rotting flesh still seeps through the most air tight containers. be careful with sharps.  A 6mm syringe will poke through a sharps box. get a good quality dollies, hand trucks, pallet jacks, drum dollies, and furniture carts.  Most large hospitals have these, most small clinics do not. nitrile gloves, goggles, safety glasses, disposable lab coats, chem gloves, puncture gloves, face shields, plastic emergency overpacks, and spill kits are some of the things you never want to be without.   It can be a very lucrative area of transportation.  But it's fairly niche and you'll have to beat out some competition that's been in place for a while.   I would look into the smaller clinics and universities to establish a base and use good customer service/professionalism as a selling point.  Word gets around quick in the med/research community."

Trucking,37eypo,Chidders,6,Wed May 27 03:22:01 2015 UTC,"I ran team with a buddy at SRT for a while and we did pretty well money wise, but you need 7 months experience to get on there. As far as companies that hire straight out of school, I don't know for sure. No matter what company you two go to, both of you will have to go out with a different trainer for probably six weeks.     Once you two are teamed up: Figure out which one of you is better at night vs day and settle on it. There will be some times that you can hang out or whatever (we had a laptop and a portable hard drive full of movies for those nights) but on teams you run run. One of you will be asleep and the other will be rolling.   As far as home time, a lot of companies are similar. A week out = a day off. If a carrier says ""Home weekends"" or ""home weekly"" it means ""In town for a 34 and then back out."" As far as teaming and home time, if you want to make money, don't go home too often. I went home for a week about every six weeks or so.   Be advised that no matter how much you like your buddy, they WILL get on your nerves after a while, even if your interactions are limited to a couple of hours between ""shift change"". It'll be little things, too. Learn to anticipate when that is gonna come and schedule home time before that.   SRT does some runs into Canada (or at least they used to) if you have a passport. Most companies hire Mexican companies to move stuff from Mexico into the US, where you would pick it up.   As far as best home time, food service companies get you more home time and decent pay, but they are exhausting physically and most truckers can't handle it."
Trucking,37eypo,IceDagger316,2,Wed May 27 05:27:30 2015 UTC,"There's an interesting way to do ""team driving"" that involves either a lease or true owner/operator status.  Start by looking at the four basic classes of lease or owner-op here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Trucking/comments/34mee9/thoughts_on_going_completely_independent/  Let's say you get ahold of a decent ""type one"" deal or better yet a ""type 2"" (linehaul based pay).  For purposes of this discussion we'll say ""type one"", total weekly costs are about $1,100ish (truck, insurance, misc. crap) and you're getting paid 85 cents a mile (loaded and empty, the one advantage over the other types where you get paid loaded only most times).  So with just one driver, the first 1,500 to 1,600 miles you run in a week pays for the truck...if you run those many miles you break even, don't pocket a dime.  If you run a hard 2,800 - 3,000 you made decent but not spectacular money - $800 to $1300.  What happens if you have a second driver?  Every mile he/she runs is pure profit, with minor caveats...a lot of these deals cost a tad bit more at the end of the lease if you've run a huge number of miles but this ""penalty"" is generally so minor it ain't worth worrying about.  (Check on this though just in case it's a monster in a particular contract.)  The problem with ""teaming"" this way is that only one of you is actually responsible for the truck, the one leasing it and the one getting paid for all the miles.  Ooops.  So splitting it up is up to you.  There can also be hairy tax issues - it looks like one guy is getting paid mega unless it's all properly accounted for.  For a husband-and-wife team this is an awesome way to go because fuckit, it's all going into the same money pot (and joint taxes) regardless."

Biggest issue was securing a job for the first 2 years after getting his license.  The company they were all driving for folded pretty soon after he got his license and it was damn near impossible for him to get a driving job with less than 2 years experience and no school.  He had to take some really shit jobs for a couple of years.  He actually was working for the original company for about 6 months for $300 a week and the boss had a habit of not paying at all but he couldn't get anything else so he stuck it out to try to put in his time.  Even if the company your dad works for is saying they'll hire you after you get your cdl they very well might not know how expensive it would be to insure you so dont count on having a job with them unless they have a proven history of hiring drivers that they train.

In that situation company paid training is a very good way to go, ive known a few people that have gone throgh Schneiders and did pretty well. Remember, some of us have been out here for a while earning decent money, not very hard for us to come up with some cash, some of these guys/gals asking about finance options are barely making it (not saying thats this op's situation but it is for some).Company paid training with the right company is a VERY good way to go.

You will be their slave after it. No, you are not guaranteed a job. Your criminal record and driving record should be as clean as possible. Also, don't fail drug tests. Look for a company with a good safety score. Look up companies online with sites like truckers report. Find one that sounds good, but remember that you are new and pickings will be slim. You can ask. Doubt it'll help you. But you can still ask. Some companies have dedicated runs, and if one of those is in a place you wanna be in, shoot for that. A company driver does what the company says. They go where the company tells them. They generally don't get to pick loads or destinations. Owner operators pick their own loads. They choose their schedule.

As to lease and owner-op situations, this kinda ""categorizes"" them:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Trucking/comments/34mee9/thoughts_on_going_completely_independent/  There are truck dealers (who are NOT freight haulers at all) that will sell you a used truck worth about $50k with $5k down and payments of about $1,500 a month.  That sounds high but it beats the hell out of about $700 a WEEK which is what it will usually cost to lease a brand new truck from a trucking company.  That $50k truck won't be too bad, either, if you do a LOT of homework.  It will also likely have a 2 year engine/tranny/axles guarantee.  This sort of thing starts to look like an even better deal if you have at least some chops as a mechanic - doesn't have to be diesel-rated or anything.  Four days ago I fixed my APU (""generator"") when the alternator fell off it's mount...took about an hour and a half for the whole job, not bad considering I'd never seen under the cowling on it and had no manual to work from.  I've also looked at things like valve adjustments and they're no different from my old '77 Yamaha XS650 motorcycle, just a hell of a lot bigger :).  Same procedure though.  I'm researching buying a truck in four months when my current six-month new-truck lease runs out...this is where I'm at so far:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Trucking/comments/36rl91/buying_our_first_truck/crhhk99  Next I need to sort out which ones weigh how much.  I intend to seriously modify mine once I own it outright - stretch it a bit and add a serious sleeper with queen bed for the wife and I, shower, toilet, kitchen, etc.  All in a short-as-possible setup....so I need the truck to be as light as possible so I can have all that yet still have a 45,000lb payload on a reefer trailer."
Trucking,37f1pl,IceDagger316,3,Wed May 27 06:21:25 2015 UTC,"1) Going through company sponsored training can work if you have a high tolerance for bullshit because that's what you are going to get from that company. If you are currently unemployed, some states have state sponsored training for truckers (everyone in my class except for one other person was paid for by the state). However what you should never ever EVER do is sign a lease/purchase with any of those companies that sponsor training (or hell, ever)   2) You aren't guaranteed but if your background and driving record are clean, you should be okay.  3) There are only a certain number of companies that take fresh CDL holders that will maximize your pay. The longer you stay out, the more money you make is pretty much a standard across most companies.  4) There are some companies that are ""no forced dispatch"" but you aren't going to find them straight out of school. Other wise you can request to get through certain areas more often, but the odds of them doing that for you are slim, quite honestly. Some companies have ""regional drivers"" but that is determined by where you live, not your preference.  5) Owning your own truck gives you 100% flexibility with your truck. However, you pay for everything...tires, oil changes, fuel (you get a little help from most companies if you lease on with them, but it's not a lot), etc. Owning your own truck with a fresh CDL is not something I (or I would think most truckers) would recommend."

Once you have an inverter, you can cook whatever you want.  I used to travel with a microwave & toaster oven, and i have a 12v crock pot as well.  Just make sure the company you works for has a fridge in the truck (12v ones are pretty good, and much better than coolers), however you can use a 12v cooler as well."

I decided I want to take a small week or two break before I just into another job so I haven't picked yet.  If I was looking for strictly money, I'd definitely call Melton. I looked through a lot of companies and they were the one with the best pay for recent grads by far. I don't think I'd go personally choose them though because they'd want me to be out for 3 weeks and only be home for 3 days. While that's cool, I'm just not ready for that at this point and you never know, they gave me that as hometime because they rarely pass through my city but you may get better home time.   If I was looking for money and hometime, I'd call Roehl because they pay decent. Above a lot of other companies for recent grads and they'd get me home a lot more often.  Old Dominion doesn't really give out much info over phone so I can't say much. I'm sure they pay good for the job and they have a lot of local opportunities so that's why they're a top choice for me.

So just trying to figure out what is the easiest way to do things. When I'm having trouble finding a gear you say I should engage the clutch and then throttle? I've had one guy tell me that too. But the guy I rode with today says he just pumps the gas with no clutch till it slides into gear. I can't seem to find the ""feel"" that they do to get it into gear."
Trucking,379qjm,eog_prod,3,Tue May 26 01:01:41 2015 UTC,"""engage"" means pedal out when talking about the clutch. When the pedal is out the clutch is ""engaged to the flywheel""."
Trucking,379qjm,Herxheim,4,Tue May 26 01:43:07 2015 UTC,"Example: slowing down for a red light and it turns green, I can't figure out how to get it into gear without grinding and looking like a noob.   you need to know frontwards and backwards what speed corresponds to what gear. then when the light turns green, you look at the speedometer and think     i'm coasting on flat ground at 23mph. that's the middle of 7th gear. i'll rev the engine to the middle of the power band and shift to 7th, then wind it out and grab 8th.     or, you might look at the speedometer and think    i'm coasting downhill at 23mph. that's the middle of 7th gear. i'll rev the engine to the bottom of 8th gear, shift into 8th, and let gravity grab an assist.     you need to know the power band of the engine, and then the speed of each gear at the top and bottom of the power band."
Trucking,379qjm,MacuahuitI,3,Tue May 26 03:39:44 2015 UTC,"General rule of thumb, add the two numbers when going X5 and that's what gear you can go into at about 1500rpm  I.e. Up to 25 in 7th, 35 in 8th, 45 in 9th.  So if you're going 30, try 8th gear at about 1200. Etc  That's how I learned anyway."
Trucking,379qjm,buhrzzy,2,Tue May 26 07:01:39 2015 UTC,Yes this. A guy a ride with also told me this. It's helped a ton.
Trucking,379qjm,bigplrbear,2,Wed May 27 04:04:52 2015 UTC,"Use your rpm gauge to guide you when to stick it in gear.  Say you're going 50 mph in 9th gear. You'd be around 1500 rpm. When you get to around 900 rpm pull it out of gear, rev the throttle to about 1700 rpm then stick it in 8th gear. You'll then be running at about 40 mph at 1500 rpm. Or something like that. (Double clutching or just straight shifting with no clutch) I rarely use the clutch."
Trucking,379qjm,twist3d7,2,Tue May 26 02:56:39 2015 UTC,"When shifting, don't put the clutch all the way in like you would in a car- You only want to do that when you're standing still. Only put it in part of the way to shift."
Trucking,379qjm,twist3d7,1 point,Tue May 26 02:58:49 2015 UTC,I've been floating the gears
Trucking,379qjm,zymase,2,Wed May 27 04:02:26 2015 UTC,"On every down shift, notice the rpm, slow it to 1100 with the brake, slide into neutral, hit the throttle and release, slide into the next lower gear at 1500.  Make a cheat sheet.  Slowly accelerate and write down the speed you are going at 1500 rpm in each gear.  Memorize the speeds as they will be the 1100 rpm equivalents for the next higher gear.  If you're going halfway between speed numbers try 1300 rpm.  A little practice and you'll be able to find a gear no matter what speed you are going.  Try this:  Coming up to a red light, brake a little harder than usual, then coast, look at the new speed you are going and using your cheat sheet numbers guess the correct gear and rpm for that speed and downshift 2 or more gears.  Keep coasting, the light is going to turn green, I can feel it.  It's GREEN, punch it.  Bleeding off speed quickly while approaching a red light may seem counter intuitive, but the real truth of the matter is, it is better to lose 3 or 4 gears than having to stop and start off again in 1st.  Good drivers do a lot of coasting well back of the crowd that races up to a red light."
Trucking,379qjm,LoneCowboy,2,Tue May 26 03:23:15 2015 UTC,I have been kind of doing this. I have definitely learned to drive more conservative when it comes to lights. If I am coming up on a green light I start slowing a ways back because chances are I know it's going to turn red.

They tend to have lounges, laundry, driver bathrooms, niche shops, and bigger lots. A well run, clean Petro is the best by far.   Followed by Flying J due to driver bathrooms and laundry and generally nicer than pilots.   Pilots and Loves are about equal imo. A lot of pilots are old and dinky with problem fuel islands but most have laundry. They do at least cater a bit to the truck driver.   Loves is my least favorite. Really just a fuel stop. Yeah they might have a few showers but they kinda begrudge that.  Small loves fuel islands are hellish.   Ambest stops can be really good or really bad. I have to say it's kinda fun checking out all the truck stops.   I like to read the reviews on Trucker Path.   Some have nice big lots for exercise and some are near walking/bike paths.

Cruise control just sets a speed and goes in whatever direction you set steer. This fucker stops at stop signs, passes and slows down automatically, shifts, parks, and backs itself. It can get from A to B and do everything in between that a driver can do, it can do it faster, and it can do it more safely. It's the future of trucking, even if that future is 30 years away.  But we can keep telling ourselves that it's just cruise control if that makes it less painful. Only thing we need people for is breakdown issues, pre/post trip set up, and keeping an eye on the truck. It will have a ton of security on it, the least of which is gps, so don't expect to be much more than a caretaker of the truck and load. The computer is the new driver.

There's yet still a lot of important driving for the driver to do. This includes negotiating surface roads, exits and interchanges, and everything else that's not highway cruising. The human in the seat is also responsible for setting and supervising the Highway Pilot mode, stepping in when conditions (like snow) prevent autonomous driving, and for negotiating the truck into loading bays.""  From CNET: http://www.cnet.com/news/4-things-that-you-should-know-about-freightliners-autonomous-inspiration-truck/  This particular truck has been completely overhyped. It cannot back itself up. It cannot pass other vehicles. It can't get on and off the freeway. It cannot drive around town. Sure, it can shift itself, but so can any other automatic truck. Only two exist in the entire world, and they are only for show-they will not be sold to any companies or people (At least, not yet).   It can stay in between the lines, on the freeway, in perfect weather. That's about it.

Trucking,377yp4,Sensei2006,1 point,Tue May 26 02:13:55 2015 UTC,"It would be a different job, for sure.  If the 'driver' is still required to sit in the seat at all times and the whole operation is still mandated by an 11 hour work day, then I don't see it making sense. It would become even more boring and tiresome just sitting there watching the road go by doing nothing. But if they build in enough fail safes to allow the driver to at least move around the cab, maybe even sleep, then I can see it working.   Even then, though, I think it would be necessary for most of all of the traffic around these trucks to also be automated. I don't see how self driving anything can be safe while using the same roads as humans. At least if everything is automatic they can communicate with each other.   This shit is coming though, albeit way slower than these prototypes would have you believe. My truck has an OnGuard system on it. It's designed to slow the truck down for me in an emergency but ironically I find it more useful for controlling my speed when I want to just follow someone. It will settle me in behind them at a safe distance and maintain their speed. It even shows me how far ahead of me they are and how fast they're going."

Your weekly pay checks will be higher even starting out compared to $17.00 @ 40 hours. Think .30x2500= $750 but you will live all week in a truck, I personally love it. That figure i gave you is also on the low side, it would more likely be closer to .35x2500-3500 your first year. With no verifiable otr experience you would have to go out with a trainer for a while. Start researching companies, get a list of candidates and start calling them to explain your situation and contract, I doubt it would be a problem. Just make sure its what you want."

I've had pay checks up to $700 a week, but that was more hours than normal. This last month it's been $300 a week because they don't have the hours.   I'll call a recruiter and ask them about having to go through their trucking school and about being solo. I don't want to have to pair up with someone.    Again I don't know.

Does breaking a contract like this make you unhireable in this industry?   That depends on the company that you're breaking the contract with ""contract says 6 months or pay back $4000"" you have those options but some companies like C.R. England will act like spoiled children and put b.s. onto your dac report. I signed paperwork for an attorney that working on a class action lawsuit and england reported that I had hit several deer in the course of 8 months, but it won't make you unhireable some hiring companies will ask about it and others won't even care and you'll still get hired.    Some of the drivers I work with stay to just stick in out 1-2 years and then get on with a union local because OTR is absolutely horrible.   I agree with them otr can be horrible and I've had plenty of experiences that were horrid, I've found a dead body and have had a gun pulled on me, and have had plenty of offers from creepy old men, but some people love otr. Your experiences may vary, I was otr from Jan 2010 to Nov 2014 and am local now.   I don't have kids or a wife I could do it.    Starting out that's the best way to do otr, I couldn't have been able to support my wife and a kid with what I made my first year.

Trucking,377pvo,i_forgot_my_sn_again,2,Tue May 26 07:15:13 2015 UTC,"If you are paid by the hour, check your local labor laws. There might be something that says you are guaranteed 40 hours per week. Unless you signed a contract that says you are ok with it. OTR, being paid by the mile sucks because you sometimes have to sit and wait for hours to get loaded/unloaded or just waiting for a load. Plus you will spend money out there to eat, do your laundry, etc. Also, there is weather and traffic delays where you are not getting paid. If you can live on what you are making, stick it out and it will get better once you have experience and you can go work anywhere you want. Looks like you only have to put up with 4 more months."
Trucking,377pvo,mrburnhollywood,1 point,Mon May 25 18:55:05 2015 UTC,"I am otr and wouldn't want to be local. I love it. I am also third generation to be otr. My neighbor at home is local and said he would quit driving before going otr. It is definitely not for everyone.   Pay will depend on what company you choose and if you choose to be company, lease or owner op. Most people will advice against the last two but for me being a lease op at my company it works out great. I learned a lot and I plan on going owner op route so I'm glad I did it quick so I could learn more from the business aspect.   You already did two months and have 4 months left. I'd stick out the four months. I know money isnt there now but it'll look better plus it'll give you a little more experience under your belt. Most otr places you only need about 6 months solo experience to go out by yourself without a trainer. if you left now you may have up to 2 months training at whatever training rate is. My company training rate is 450 for 3 weeks then 50 more per week until 6 weeks when you should be finished.   There are some companies that will hire you under a new contract and give you the money to pay that 4k off if your training was done at a school. But that also means that you may be under a contract now for a year or more.   My advice is first stick it out. If that isn't a possibility then do some research, talk to recruiters, talk to different drivers at the truck stops and figure out and know what you are truly getting into before you quit."

Stick it out but do your research on other companies and then jump ship when your contract ends. OTR can be rewarding but you have to play your hand right. Also remember, SWIFT, Schneider and JB Hunt are shit companies."
Trucking,377pvo,JimMarch,2,Tue May 26 06:25:47 2015 UTC,Any company is a shit company if they don't work out for you. I've talked to people at the companies you listed and it works great for them.

Trucking,375hso,eog_prod,3,Mon May 25 09:19:34 2015 UTC,Mine uses around 5 gallons over 14 hours.

Trucking,374wi1,ResumeKMS,12,Sun May 24 22:19:57 2015 UTC,"if you just want to drive the truck and bump docks, no you probably can't make 80k  BUT  if you are either willing to unload the truck (LTL or food service) OR do something specialized (hazmat comes immediately to mind) there is serious money to be made.  You will earn every penny of it.   There are no 8 hour days, 5 days a week in trucking (Ok, maybe but it's really really tiny).     If you don't make 30's to 40's the first year you picked a REALLY BAD company (see CR england) to start with or you aren't working very hard.    Oh, it's always easy to maneuver the vehicle.  It is however somewhat harder to do so without hitting things. :-)."

Trucking,374wi1,That_Guy_From_,6,Mon May 25 08:24:54 2015 UTC,"I'll answer some of these from a different perspective than the majority of members will have.  I own a local trucking Company. We work in what's called aggregate hauling: sand, gravel, etc. I've made a very, very detailed post on my starting the company that you can find in my post history.  Looking from a driver perspective, it's a sweet deal. They are all employed 1099, which isn't the best from their view, though many of the drivers demand it. They receive no benefits from me. They are responsible for their own taxes. They are their own boss. They set their own hours and their own schedules.   It's a great opportunity for someone just starting out because it allows you to gain experience, test the market out, and either jump to something bigger or drop out (all while staying close to home and your family). Your pay is entirely based on how much you work. I pay some drivers $600 a week and some drivers $1,200 a week. The $1,200 guys start around 5:00 or 5:30 and will drive until 5:00 or 5:30. Most of the guys I hire are from the oilfield and between jobs or just sick of oilfield hours. The vast majority are just looking to spend time with family, make their kids ball games, or whatever."
Trucking,374wi1,86n96,2,Mon May 25 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"So, what do they do about worker's comp insurance? Social security? I get 1099'd, but I'm running my own equipment. Seems like you could be treading in dangerous waters."
Trucking,374wi1,That_Guy_From_,3,Mon May 25 01:47:05 2015 UTC,"I've double and triple checked, they're able to run as 1099 under the way they operate. The key factors being that drivers performance effects pay, they don't have a supervisor, they aren't required to work a certain job at a certain time (set their own hours and get their own work), and make their own repairs, etc.  They have no supervisor. I send a dispatch every day, but they have the option to find their own work and get paid a bonus if they do. They are paid a % of equipment gross. They make repairs, but if they return the equipment to me I make them free of charge. If they go to my part warehouses, I pay for parts.   As far as what they do for all that? Not sure, that parts on them to manage."
Trucking,374wi1,cdnstuckindetroit,3,Mon May 25 02:40:37 2015 UTC,So your top drivers are doing around $60k gross?  5 day work week? Not a bad deal for someone able to manage their money wisely.  What kind of experience does your liability insurer require of your drivers?
Trucking,374wi1,That_Guy_From_,3,Mon May 25 01:38:25 2015 UTC,"Progressive had no requirements, my current insurance requires 3 years. It fluctuates, but I did some serious shopping this year to cut that expense and had the 3 year penalty as a result.   I'd say they average about 50k a year. It slows heavily in Winter and picks up rapidly in Summer.  Edit: and yes, 5 day work week. If it rains, then we don't work that day. So probably less than 5 days a week."
Trucking,374wi1,eyesofglass,5,Mon May 25 02:36:43 2015 UTC,"I've worked for a couple different companies, and as long as I was willing to do CAN/USA they all agreed I would be able to go out for 5 days, be home for 2. It doesn't always work out, sometimes I'm out for as many as 8 days. But, it's better than several weeks out at a time. If you can't manage 5 days out minimum, you won't want to be a truck driver. There are local jobs that get you home every day, but it's usually LTL or positions that go to experienced drivers only.  I made just under $40K my first year, doing 5 day runs. I didn't push myself that hard TBH.  Most companies I've experienced dispatch you expecting you will drive close to your maximum allowable each day...which is 11 hours driving time in the USA and 13 hours driving time in Canada. I try to run my maximum as it means you will get more miles per day, get more money.  I have never heard of PTO, never been offered it except stat holidays.  Health plans all seem to be co-pay, not the greatest deals but better than nothing. No pension plans have been offered to me so far.  Most newer trucks are automatics, but as a new driver you will most likely be given an older truck and it will likely be stick. Expect your first truck to be well-worn, smell like cigarettes and cheap air fresheners, and have lots of little things broken or missing.  Driving is a real commitment. It's very challenging. You get a huge sense of pride of accomplishment as you learn to be good at it, and it's an adventure traveling to new places. But you need to be prepared for what you're in for."

Trucking,373m60,boomboomvroom,14,Sun May 24 15:47:04 2015 UTC,"The ugliest part of the industry in my opinion has got to be how a lot of the big companies have turned it into a low wage revolving door McJob. The big companies will put new drivers into a truck on their own after very little training, unprepared for a lot of things, and horrible pay, and a lot won't make it through their first year. Training needs to be vastly improved, and we shouldn't be letting drivers with only a couple months experience become trainers."
Trucking,373m60,Startide,5,Sun May 24 17:54:55 2015 UTC,"In 1937 the Federal government started to craft things like the 40 hour week, minimum wage and overtime.  They left truckers and agricultural workers out of that system of protections.  We're still left out.  This is why megatruck companies like CR England, CRST, Swift, Werner and so many others can get away with such serious fucking of entry level workers.  Even ""better"" companies have policies that screw workers.  Example: you are leasing OR a company driver for a company that supplies high-dollar complicated trailers like a reefer (refrigerated) that have their own fuel supply and diesel motor to keep stuff cold even if disconnected from a truck.  So the trailer breaks somehow...say, brakes are so fucked up you can't slide the tandems (trailer axles).  You got two choices: call it in for repair OR chock the trailer tires so you can slide it with bad brakes and drive it like that.  A lot of guys where I work take option B, unsafely, because the company will make you babysit the broken trailer while it gets fixed and not pay you for your time doing so, costing you potentially hundreds of bucks.  No other industry could force you to work for free like that, but it's common in trucking.    Other examples of them getting free work out of you abound...fr'instance, walmart and the like love dealing with the cheesy sorts of megatruck companies because they don't negotiate detention fee policies with the shippers...no need because newbie drivers have no clue how vital that is before signing the contract!  So if they want to take six hours to load you, they can and the driver is fucked with no recourse at all.  Great for the shipper, great for the megatruck company because they get that megashipper's business, driver is fucked.  I was delayed 14 hours one time at one meat plant, 11 at another, just in the last month.   Any company that hires experienced drivers has to negotiate detention policies because that's damn near the first thing I for one would ask about before hitting on!!!!  So you don't see Mercer, Landstar, Dart or the like trucks at the sleazy megashippers because they would have to get detention fees to go with their veteran drivers..."
Trucking,373m60,JimMarch,2,Sun May 24 22:56:54 2015 UTC,Carriers(all of them) want compensation for their truck being detained. Typically after 2 hours of waiting a customer has to pay for keeping the truck static. Some carriers pass some of that to the driver. As low as $6 per hour and as high as $20. Layover or breakdown pay is often given as well.
Trucking,373m60,MisterTrucker,4,Tue May 26 11:28:44 2015 UTC,"after all the FMCSA's ""Safety"" measures, the one they don't want to tackle are the standards for driver training.  The part that would have the biggest positive impact on the industry, and the biggest negative impact on the super companies."
Trucking,373m60,knucklebone,3,Sun May 24 21:21:41 2015 UTC,That's what happens when job bidding becomes a race to the bottom.
Trucking,373m60,rahtin,3,Sun May 24 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"Lower standards for training and cheaper drivers are a result of both the job becoming easier with the advent of e-logs, GPS, easier trucks, and the increase in freight while trying to hold down costs. You can also blame higher oil prices, the strain hours of service laws has placed on what a driver can do, the cost of equipment, and insurance premiums. Let's not forget the age old factor of greed.   When you think about it, trucking as a McJob is just inevitable. It's not really in danger of being replaced with driverless robots in the next decade or so but with enough time the job will be either circumvented completely with drones or trains/short haul warehousing, or the driver reduced to a cheap on-board manager.   Trying to get the government or companies to pay drivers a wage closer to the old days would be fruitless. The way I see it, the best way to increase driver pay is to increase what we can haul, which is impossible with out current infrastructure. But it is at least possible to change that specifically, albeit not without major struggles.   A relatively low cost boost (but still ridiculously expensive) is to, instead of constantly replacing roads, build a secondary two or three lane road specifically for trucks along highways where possible. The road would be off limits to cars and designed with our weight and size in mind. This would reduce truck/car incidents, relieve traffic congestion, and increase the lifespan of roads not baring our weight. I'd hope to see these new lanes built with heat conducive material in colder climates to negate the need to plow them and keep us moving."

So long as nobody hits it, my gasoline tanker is one of the safest objects on the road.  To answer the question in the title : The main problem with the trucking industry is the ""churn and burn"" attitude of longhaul carriers.  Rookie drivers are a dime a dozen, and the big players know it.  So they don't worry about keeping the drivers happy, as a disgruntled driver can be replaced immediately with an equally qualified candidate."
Trucking,373m60,Sensei2006,3,Sun May 24 18:04:24 2015 UTC,"Some shippers won't allow the driver to observe the load, and if you hook to a preloaded trailer there's a limited amount you can do to sure the load.

UPS and FedEx Freight are both in the 65-66 ballpark. I blow by them all day running the speed limit of 70. The FedEx Ground trucks are owner/ops or contractors. I'm sorry but UPS trucks can't run 120 mph even though it may seem like it in a 60 mph Prime truck that so many people on this sub are chained to.  Even if they can run faster than most companies consider that they run the same route every day. I run the same lanes a lot. I know where the speed bumps are, where the exits are, where to stop to eat, etc. I run a lot of two lane and have to pass other trucks all the time who want to run 1-2 under the limit in the middle of cornfields.

It only makes sense that these guys would be the most comfortable with their surroundings because they typically drive the same stretch of road every day at the same time of day. They aren't checking their map for the next intersection or Trucker's Path for the next truck stop. Also I meant to say speed trap, not bump so that's my fault.

Drivers who have runs over 500mi get paid mileage rate.  Where I am,  there are around 300 drivers and maybe 80 get mileage rate. Those are generally the speed demons. Partly because they have to be ( we have a few 670+ mi runs) and mostly because they are basically salary. It takes about 20 years to get the seniority to snag one of those runs, so the guys that have them have a good bit of wheel time. They do fly though, I share a tractor with one. Our tractor is governed at 74. He runs 620mi faster than I run 418. Also if someone is passing you in construction or with narrower lanes it is almost always FedEx ground."

But you cannot drive again without 10 consecutive hours off duty and or sleeper berth. I can't remember how the split sleeper berth rule works.    I think in your scenario you could get back 4.5 hrs after another 8 hr break in the sleeper.  Also, yes they sold your company garbage.  But, it's likely very capable of tracking available drive time."
Trucking,3724kw,cdnstuckindetroit,7,Sun May 24 03:59:28 2015 UTC,"Former instructor here. New hours log says once you start your day, your 14 hours starts. Your on duty time cannot exceed 14 hours. You can spend up to eleven hours driving within that period. If you are sitting at a loading dock for five hours(hope that's not the case) then you'll go by you 14 hour clock for remaining on duty time, whether driving or not.  Before your first eight hours on duty is up, you have to take a 30 minute break to finish out your time for the day (only extended by a maximum of eight hours so don't take it too early).  In order to start a new day, you must take a ten hour break. That will give you a new start on your 11 and 14 hour clocks. Split logging (taking an eight hour SB break) will give you what was remaining for your 14 hour clock. So, before your eight hour break, you only had six hours remaining on your fourteen. After eight hours in berth, you'll get six hours drive and on duty time total. In order to get the rest, you must take a 2 hour off duty break before those six hours are up.  The total weekly hours changed as well. The seven day allows 70 hours total on duty/driving. Six days is sixty hours total. Either way, average day can only spend ten hours on duty or driving. Off duty and sleeper berth time do not deplete the seventy or sixty hour, respectively. For the 7 day, you can get back on the eighth day what you worked on the first. May 1st, you put in eight hours drive time and 2 hours on duty time. You'll gain 10 hours to work with on May Eighth at 0001 hours. To get around working on your eighth day clock, you can take a 34 hour reset. Spend a complete and uninterrupted 34 hours off duty and your seventy hour restarts.   If I missed anything, ask away!"
Trucking,3724kw,sstandnfight,1 point,Sun May 24 15:05:50 2015 UTC,"I may have misstated my case. After I cam off a break, I drove about 1 1/2 hours. Got to consignee and hired a lumper and logged time at consignee as sleeper time. It was about 4 hours.  Under the scenario you mention, I'd have 8 1/2 hours to work, but I have only ""worked 1 1/2 hours.   Counting sleeper time as working time can't be correct. It goes against breaking down activities into work and rest related time. Under the real life scenario I mentioned, I had 9 1/2hours (11 minus 1 1/2 hours) drive time and 12 1/2 hours ""work"" time (14 minus 1 1/2).  I am wonderinbg if this is company policy as the DOT rules I read state that On-Duty time (Drive Time and On Duty Not Driving are capped at 14 hours with a mandatory 1/2 hour break to be taken not later than 8 hours be fore driving again. Although you can work longer but not drive until the 1/2 hour break is taken."
Trucking,3724kw,sstandnfight,1 point,Mon May 25 15:54:56 2015 UTC,"Sleeper time doesn't count against your 70 hour, neither does off duty. But once you start a duty day, after fourteen hours you are unable to work more unless you have completed an uninterrupted minimum 8 hours in the berth.  The fourteen hour clock is put in place so as to keep a semblance of sleep cycles. Napping twenty minutes at a time can keep you moving, but your brain does not rest properly. After an extended period, this can cause a state of delirium. The 14 hour ensures you have to sleep during each day cycle, minimum."
Trucking,3724kw,sstandnfight,1 point,Mon May 25 16:03:22 2015 UTC,"So a 8 hour sleeper time gives me 11 minus the hours before the 8 hour sleeper time? And after I use up the 11 hour total, what will 2 more sleeper berth hours do?  I appreciate your feedback."
Trucking,3724kw,sstandnfight,1 point,Tue May 26 01:35:19 2015 UTC,"8 hour berth is for split log. It gives back what was left of your 14 hour when you first hit the SB. Say you had 7 hours left on your 14 hour clock and the next load won't be ready for seven hours. Instead of just eating up your time, start your sleeper time, and you get back 7 hours of drive/ on duty time. To get the rest of a full day's time (11/14) you need to show 2 hours off duty. So instead of taking a 30 minute, it would be a two hour break. Some situations it is beneficial to run a split log, but it's rarely I do. I'll edit in a link to the DOT hours regs. It's wordy. Be forewarned."
Trucking,3724kw,LoneCowboy,1 point,Tue May 26 03:45:25 2015 UTC,"Just thought of a question for you. If during a 14 hour period after I started my work day after 10 hours off-duty and I take a 6 hour sleeper break, it  means that I have only 6 hours left to ""work?"
Trucking,3724kw,CurlyNutHair,1 point,Mon May 25 15:59:59 2015 UTC,"Until you complete a full 8 hours in the berth at minimum, starting your day keeps that 14 hour clock counting down. At least in US. Canada could have different regulations, so I'd have to dig on that."

Trucking,370dfu,Herxheim,3,Sat May 23 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"Moving houses is very common in Canada. Or at least on the prairies. The house in the pic seems to be 1/2 of a modular home, which is a built house moved in sections and assembled on site.  From my perspective, why would you buy a RTM (ready to move) as opposed to a stick build. Well to start every RTM is going to be brand new, built to today's code, and everything in it will be fresh out of the factory.Obviously a stick build (on site) house will be the same, but unless you're building within the city good luck getting a builder to come out to your ""back 40"" anytime soon. Getting a tradesman to leave the city limits for what ever reason, carries a $1000 price tag... then you pay for the work.  If you get a RTM house, everything is done. Plumbing is done, if your on a sewer then the hook ups are there, septic tank, hook ups are in place. The power has been run through the house, all that's left is hooking up the house to the ""box."" Paint... done. Flooring... done. Kitchen... done. Gas lines... done.   Around here they move 2500 sq/ft houses. Pretty often. To the point were most people living out side the city buy a ready to move, and pay to have it shipped. The moving companies pay the telephone and power people to lift, or drop, lines in the way."

They're almost done replacing the entire fleet with Cascadias and most of the trailers were built in the last 5 years. They've bought everything without debt which is impressive.   Their FMCSA rating is the best in Wisconsin in every category and one of the best nationwide.

Trucking,36y1rp,Agamemnon323,3,Sat May 23 05:42:09 2015 UTC,"Quite the contrary.

Trucking,36xvgl,x505,5,Sat May 23 00:54:17 2015 UTC,"You would need to know at what rpm point the engine loses torque and HP, could be anywhere between 1100 and 1300 rpm. When you get to that point do a full gear downshift. You will probably have to use the clutch if revs drop suddenly. If there is a really tight pinch at the top of the hill you might have to drop more than one gear at a time.  If the hill is really steep and you've got a lot of weight on I would change down earlier so you don't lose momentum."
Trucking,36xvgl,Ozdriver,2,Sat May 23 01:15:02 2015 UTC,So it's better to be at a higher gear and be able to downshift than at a lower gear and not able to do anything?
Trucking,36xvgl,Ozdriver,6,Sat May 23 02:18:44 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the circumstances, how heavy the load is, how steep the hill is, how much power/torque the engine has.  If it is a very long, very steep hill I just pick a gear where the engine isn't straining at full power or rpm. On my truck I would rather let the engine sit at say 16-1700 rpm at slightly less than full power than 1300 rpm at full power but every engine is different and I haul a lot of weight.  The idea is not to jerk the transmission with last second panic gear changes. It really all boils down to experience. It's a bit hard to answer your question, but to avoid damage you are probably better off picking a lower gear than you need rather than a higher gear and doing a panic downshift."
Trucking,36xvgl,Ozdriver,2,Sat May 23 02:40:22 2015 UTC,I guess I'll have to get a feel for it when I actually start driving. It's all about practice and experiencing it yourself I suppose! Thanks for answering. I knew it was a bit of a weird question but I just couldn't get it off my mind.
Trucking,36xvgl,lostonyou,4,Sat May 23 03:40:11 2015 UTC,"To cut a long story short, if you stalled it, you left the downshift way too late!"
Trucking,36xvgl,Agamemnon323,3,Sat May 23 03:59:49 2015 UTC,He is completely right.
Trucking,36xvgl,adventure_dog,3,Sat May 23 04:08:37 2015 UTC,"When you're travelling on flat ground the truck has the power to continue accelerating usually until it hits the electronic limiter.  The lower gears pull stronger than the higher which is why large trucks climb steep hills slowly.  The low gears have the power to do it while the higher gears don't.  So if you're driving along and come to a hill that's too steep for your current gear then as you start climbing, even if your foot is to the floor, your rpm and kph will drop.  If you let the rpm get too low the truck will stall. Because of this as the rpm drop you need to shift down to a lower gear.  As a general rule you'll want to be going as fast as possible (limited by your truck, conditions, or speed limit) at the bottom of the hill and then down shift as required.  Every truck is different so you'll have to learn your own but I'll tell you what works for mine.    I haul up to 105,500 lbs total and I like my truck to run between 1300 and 1900 rpm.  So I'll start a hill at the bottom going full speed, 110 kph at about 1550 rpm in 8th over. As the road gets steeper the truck doesn't have the power to maintain speed so both kph and rpm drop.  When it gets down to 1400 rpm I down shift a half gear.  That'll put me at about 1600 rpm in 8th direct.  When it gets down to 1400-1500 I'll down shift.  Repeat as necessary until the rpm no longer drop.  Once they hold you've found the gear you can climb the hill in.    If I was hauling super b's, (140,000 lbs total) I'd down shift a full gear each time it drops to 1300.  Or if it was a hill that becomes steep suddenly I'd do a full gear as well.  Most of the hills I climb become steep fairly gradually so I can usually do a half gear at a time."
Trucking,36xvgl,cdnstuckindetroit,3,Sat May 23 07:54:29 2015 UTC,What's a PDTI ?
Trucking,36xvgl,adventure_dog,2,Sat May 23 10:15:00 2015 UTC,"It's a certificate from the ""Professional Truck Driver Institute"". My instructors say it should count as at least 6 months of experience.  This is from their website:   ""PTDI-certified courses are based on national standards determined by the trucking industry. Since schools  with PTDI-certified courses have voluntarily chosen to have an outside third-party (PTDI) come in and verify  that the course is meeting those standards, you can have some assurances of the quality of the course.   Graduating from one of these courses could also give you an advantage with carriers who recognize that they  shouldn’t need to give you extensive additional training. Also, some carriers cannot hire inexperienced drivers  because of their insurance; however, some insurance carriers may give some credit for having graduated from a PTDI-certified course.   Having a PTDI Certificate of Attainment will give you an extra credential to present  to prospective employers, especially if you can explain to the carrier why they should consider that  accomplishment. Some carriers request PTDI-course graduates."""

Smoothbore is with the can top facing the front of the skateboard, and will roll sideways if the skateboard turns.  Eye to the Sky is loading it with the top facing up.

Relationships are rough, you will miss all kinds of family stuff, and at your age, you need to consider that.  I was almost 40, divorced and no kids when I did it, mainly because the lifestyle is perfect for me.  And it is a lifestyle.  It isn't a job.  So be willing to give up a ton at home.    On the flip side, it is a great lifestyle.  I met a fellow driver, we now drive team.  But we don't have kids and our parents are retired, so it makes it much easier.

Haz mat usually isn't much to worry about, but we have water tight trailers with a spill tank built in. Just make sure to check your load every two hours. I usually just open the doors and make sure the floor's still dry and nothing has moved. With the shit I'm hauling, I am not getting in that trailer.  I've only had one leaky drum in the three years I've been with this company. They basically just asked if it was coming out the back, I said no. Then they told me to sit tight for an hour to let the drain catch it, then sent me to the closest shop for them to deal with it, then sent me on my way again after they unloaded it to find the leaky drum, put it in an overpack, and reload. As for blindside backing, most trucks should have power mirrors at least on the passenger side, so use them so you can see the back end of the trailer at all times, get a spotter if you need it, and get out to look if you're even a little bit unsure of where your trailer's going."

Trucking,36rl91,WritingArmyWife,6,Thu May 21 15:50:21 2015 UTC,"Stop thinking to much about the make of truck and start thinking about the motor and tranny.   First thing: smog controls started getting phased in heavy after 2007.  By about 2010 things got really bad - the DPF (diesel particulate filter) systems were a bad joke with serious issues.  The bugs got worked out by 2012, so one line of thought says get either a 2007 or older OR 2012 forward - nothing in between.   If you need California compatibility, it seems you can run a 2007 for at least a while, especially if you add an aftermarket DPF filter system...that's a $10k expense but may be worth it.  Motors:  If you're going newer, the Detroit Diesel DD-13 motor is a sweetheart but you have to buy a freightliner truck to get it.  The older 12.7 liter series 60 is nice if you're going older.   Volvo brand motors are ok... there are 12 and 13 liter sizes and I can't recall which is better.  Do some research.   The Cummins ISX set up for 400hp is a good long-haul setup.  The older N14 isn't bad either.   Avoid CAT motors...they are out of the truck engine biz now and their later motors weren't all that good.   Avoid MAXXForce like the plague.  PACCAR: I'm driving a kenworth T680 with a Paccar MX13.  Fortunately I have about four months into a six month lease after which I hope I never ever see another.   Paccar owns kenworth and Peterbuilt.  Trannies:  If you want auto you need an Eaton ultrashift, or Volvo' s auto.  Manuals, well, most are nice. A lot of us like 13sp setups and/or something with overdrive.   Other stuff... you really need an engine brake, for sure!  You want a 400hp motor for dry van, reefer or basic flatbed up to 80,000 max total weight.  If you're doing heavy haul or oversize or something.   In other words...a Volvo with a Cummins motor might be a lot better than a Volvo with a lesser-grade Volvo motor."

Those of us that have been out here for a while have found ways to make it work without relying on papa government to force changes.  In regards to shippers and receivers,  laws could be easily passed to streamline loading and unloading processes. This is the biggest bottleneck in the industry. It is also the biggest factor involved in working against a driver's ability to comply with HOS laws. Until laws are passed to make exceptions for situations that occur at either end of the shipping chain which the driver has no control over, and/or legal and/or monetary consequences for issues that result from lack of streamline of procedures regarding shippers, recievers and brokers then nothing will change."

You mentioned NY, when your anywhere east of the Mississippi, the earlier you start your day and end your day the better for limited parking reasons, gets worse the farther east you get. California is pretty crowded for parking also. If your a night runner this wont be a problem. Dont let anyone talk you into a lease. In the rest areas or anywhere really, just use common sense, keep everything locked, make sure wherever you park is ok to stay the whole 10 hours, sucks getting woke up in the middle of the night & told you have to leave, especially on electronic logs. Dont rush anything, mistakes happen when you rush, if you cant comfortably pickup & deliver on time let the company know as soon as possible, preferably before you agree to take the load. I usually start by figuring my total miles divided by 50 mph to see if I can comfortably do it, if its closer than that then I start looking closer at my route to see If its taking me through a lot of cities, back roads, etc.."

Ive met quite a few lease operators in my 10 years of driving that actually owed the company they lease from money at the end of the week, thats a negative paycheck, the driver actually ows the company money for working for them. Do some research & check the success rate, its horrible and I wish it were illegal.

That single person going slow bottlenecks 2 lanes of 70 mph traffic into one lane in a very short distance, which means people are coming over to get around them when there's little room to move anyways.

Trucking,36ks7z,klieber,-1,Wed May 20 16:37:34 2015 UTC,No shit. I said 5 below I was referring to 60MPH limits.
Trucking,36ks7z,FierceUrgency,3,Wed May 20 17:09:13 2015 UTC,"So...driving at 50mph significantly reduces your chance of dying compared to driving 55mph.    Interesting idea.  Can you elaborate on what, exactly, the safety differences are in that 5mph?"
Trucking,36ks7z,Agamemnon323,0,Wed May 20 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"It does. I am in cruise control. First off 55 is the limit which should be an obvious, but clearly most don't understand what LIMIT means. Secondly as I am cruising at 50 people go around me as opposed to ride behind me. This means I am usually alone in my space which decreases my chances of an accident significantly. Also it saves me gas."
Trucking,36ks7z,bigbuzd1,6,Thu May 21 00:36:32 2015 UTC,Forcing people to constantly drive around you actually increases your chances of an accident. It doesn't reduce it. People who drive too fast OR too slow are the main causes of accidents. You going 5 under is just as bad as the guy going 5 over.
Trucking,36ks7z,Agamemnon323,2,Wed May 20 13:47:45 2015 UTC,"The asshat going 5 over is breaking the law, the 5 under guy isn't.  Not paying attention is the cause of lane change incidents, plain and simple.  Oh, and the term is crash, not accident.  Yes, accident is widely used, but incorrect, as it implies it was unavoidable."
Trucking,36ks7z,bigbuzd1,2,Wed May 20 13:51:21 2015 UTC,We weren't talking about the legality of it. Only which action had an increased chance of causing an accident. And I used that word because he did. I didn't feel like being pedantic. And they often are accidents. Not as often it's an accident for all parties but most of the time it's unavoidable for at least one party. Like the accident I was involved in on Sunday. Absolutely unavoidable for me.
Trucking,36ks7z,Agamemnon323,1 point,Wed May 20 15:02:56 2015 UTC,"You're right, my apologies.  I tend to be very specific and can get kinda preachy on driving matters because my job now deals with auto crash claims...and I hope you're doing ok."
Trucking,36ks7z,FierceUrgency,2,Wed May 20 15:36:34 2015 UTC,Ya I'm fine. The woman who caused the accident left the scene unconscious but stable. I have no idea how she's doing. But it usually doesn't go well for you when you drive your suv into a semi doing 110 kph.
Trucking,36ks7z,Agamemnon323,1 point,Wed May 20 22:10:33 2015 UTC,hardly it increases their chances. 5 miles below is not too slow and you will not be ticketed for it. 10-15 under sure.
Trucking,36ks7z,FierceUrgency,1 point,Thu May 21 12:39:54 2015 UTC,And 5 over hardly does anything either. The point was that over or under both increase risk.
Trucking,36ks7z,Agamemnon323,1 point,Thu May 21 14:27:30 2015 UTC,5 over is 10 above 5 below which is significant
Trucking,36ks7z,FierceUrgency,1 point,Thu May 21 00:34:24 2015 UTC,Then 5 under is 10 under what everyone else is doing. Which is significant.
Trucking,36ks7z,Agamemnon323,1 point,Thu May 21 01:24:11 2015 UTC,That is what the passing lane is for.
Trucking,36ks7z,FierceUrgency,1 point,Thu May 21 04:41:14 2015 UTC,There isn't always a passing lane.
Trucking,36ks7z,Agamemnon323,0,Thu May 21 04:46:52 2015 UTC,"Also you are wrong. 5 over increases required braking distance, and changes a multitude of factors as it relates to keeping the vehicle in control."
Trucking,36ks7z,FierceUrgency,1 point,Thu May 21 04:55:51 2015 UTC,Yes those are the reasons increased speed can cause accidents. And you driving below the limit causes accidents because people hit your slow-ass.
Trucking,36ks7z,Agamemnon323,0,Thu May 21 14:24:26 2015 UTC,Hardly. Never been hit or in an accident or had a speeding ticket. Speeders who hit me are idiots following to close who cant see for shit.
Trucking,36ks7z,FierceUrgency,1 point,Thu May 21 01:12:01 2015 UTC,"Hardly. I've been hit, in an accident, and gotten a speeding ticket. Slowpokes who get hit are idiots driving too slow who can't drive for shit."
Trucking,36ks7z,klieber,0,Thu May 21 01:33:34 2015 UTC,If they are driving significantly slower then yes. 5 below no. Speeders are inconsiderate assholes.
Trucking,36ks7z,FierceUrgency,4,Thu May 21 03:31:02 2015 UTC,"It doesn't.  Many (most?) accidents are caused at least in part by lane changes.  You're forcing the majority of vehicles (who are going with the prevailing flow of traffic) to navigate around you, increasing their chances of getting into an accident in the immediate vicinity of your vehicle.    You're not being safer. You're just being an asshole."
Trucking,36ks7z,klieber,0,Thu May 21 04:49:53 2015 UTC,They designed the fast lane for a reason.
Trucking,36ks7z,FierceUrgency,1 point,Thu May 21 06:19:54 2015 UTC,"Again, you're wrong.  You think you're right, but you're wrong.   the probability of being involved in a crash per vehicle-mile as a function of on-road vehicle speeds follows a U-shaped curve with speed values around the median speed having the lowest probability of being in a crash.   source  But, you know better than all that scientific research.  'Cause you're a professional and all."

For example in Germany, your max allowed speed outside cities but not on a highway is max 60 unless specified otherwise by road signs, in the Netherlands it's 80. In France it's max 90. On highways it's mostly 80 in all country's except France and Belgium where it's 90. 1 thing all trucks have in common is that they are limited to 90 kmh by European law. Your employer can set it lower tho if they want to. On most 2 lane highways trucks are  not allowed in the left lane between 6 am and 7 pm, even if there's a car in front of you driving 20 below the speed limit.

Trucking,36jt42,ohmygodbees,1 point,Wed May 20 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"Career mechanic here. You are killing the clutch. Starting out in anything higher than 2nd empty, and anything higher than 3rd bobtail, wears the clutch prematurely. I know you guys don't think about it because you've never had to change one out before. I've done several. Your method also glazes the flywheel and wear the drive shaft ujoints faster. It also wears the pinion bearings, ring gear, and pinion seals faster. It also wears the main oil seals, main bearings, timing gear, rod bearings and piston rings and cylinder sleeves faster.  Whether you realize it or not, the clutch ""chatters"" when it starts to engage the flywheel, even if you can't feel it. That chattering kills everything from the front of the engine to the last differential. It is unavoidable. So the longer than clutch has to rub against the flywheel to match speed the longer it chatters. The longer it chatters the more damage occurs.  The clutch on a truck is much different than a clutch on a passenger vehicle. The clutch on a truck is specifically designed to engage at IDLE SPEED ONLY... and as quickly as possible without jerking or surging the truck too much. If you engage the clutch any other way besides  at idle speed you are causing unnecessary wear and increasing the chances of a break down or a potentially fatal mechanical failure."

When I saw afterward when he put the tire on all I could think was how could you even bend that thing like that you know just seemed impossible like it was literally bent inward onto the tire and I'm just like well none of my thoughts makes any sense how that would happen and you know you might overlooking something sometimes, but this seemed like something you'd surely couldn't of overlook especially checking the trailer out. Though when something happens you're trying to back track in your head. Did I miss something ? Just makes you more aware. Just like a month or two ago I had a blowout on my drives and what happened was the rim split in half. Just got done running a 15 today because of that.

Trucking,36dc8n,allprocro,5,Mon May 18 14:09:13 2015 UTC,"Floating means meshing gears manually. When the speed of the input gear matches the speed of the output gear inside the trans they will mesh. In a car, meshing happens automatically when you shift due to the presence of auto synchronizers. In a truck you must make them mesh manually by adjusting the speed of the input gear to match the speed of the output gear. The speed of the input gear is controlled by engine speed. The speed of the output gear is controlled by the drive shaft or drive axle. So by controlling engine speed while between gears you are controlling the input gear speed.  18wheellife makes a pretty good description on shifting, although revving engines up to 2000rpms to shift is a waste of fuel, doesn't get you going any faster and can make the input gear ""hang"" when trying to pull trans out of gear, and will eventually cause the transmission to start slipping out of gear going over bumps and during times of minimal acceleration.  These engines are designed to operate between 1100 and 1400rpms. They shift the easiest this way, they get the best fuel mileage, and allow the engine to use torque to do all of the work instead of relying on horsepower. There are times when shifting at a higher rpm becomes necessary, such as climbing hills (because of you upshift at 1500rom while climbing a hill you could loose too much speed to make the upshift before engine rpm winds down to the appropriate speed for upshifting. There are other methods people use to overcome this, such as using the engine fan override or using the engine brake, things we can get into later)  First and foremost DO NOT REV THE ENGINE WHILE ENGAGING THE CLUTCH IN FIRST GEAR! Let it out slowly from idle, feel it grab, and as the truck begins to pull forward and match engine speed with truck speed AT IDLE, continue to release the clutch pedal slowly. Not until you have the pedal fully released do you give it throttle.   So, clutch pedal out now, easily give it throttle and accelerate to 1500 rpm. As you are easing off the throttle pull the stick into neutral and WAIT for the engine rpm to fall to around 1100. Easily put the stick into second. Rinse, repeat.  Now, when you are in fourth getting ready to shift to 5th you must ""preselect"" your range shift...which means you will flip the lever on the front of the shifter up BEFORE you shift. Once you have preselected you will want to get the engine slightly faster than  before to accommodate for the range difference. This time you will want to get to around 1700rpms before you shift. You will be going back into the #1 hole, as the range shift makes this the #5 hole. Then go back to shifting normally up to 8.  When downshifting you are doing the exact same thing but opposite from a normal shift. From 1500rpms you will let the truck slow to around 1100, shift into neutral, rev the engine back up to 1500 and then shift into lower gear. Shift, rev, shift.  8LL means ""8speed with a normal low gear and 2 very low gears"". The lower gears are operated by the thumb switch and will make sense to you once you get normal shifting down.   Just remember: all you are doing by controlling engine speed during shifts is doing the work the syncronizers would be doing in a passenger car transmission.  Side note: Speeding up to 2000rpms before a shift is pointless in most situations. It makes the shift more difficult, it wastes fuel and wears engines out prematurely. There are times when it becomes necessary, like when climbing a steep hill, but it does not make acceleration any faster. Besides climbing a grade, the only time you want your engine to get above 1500 rpm is in top gear at highway speed. Keep it under 1700 until you get shifting down good. Good luck brother! :)"
Trucking,36dc8n,eog_prod,2,Mon May 18 17:44:17 2015 UTC,"Fantastic description of shifting.  I would like to add, you need to watch out for road grade.  As you go uphill your truck may need 100 more RPMs or as you go down hill, you may need to shift early.  Truck weight also changes the rolling resistance and you have to make better shifts the more loaded you are."
Trucking,36dc8n,BiWinning85,2,Mon May 18 18:40:58 2015 UTC,"My jaw is literally to the floor that they'd have me jump behind a transmission like this after telling them I have no experience driving these types of vehicles.  Thanks for the advice, definitely reading this a couple of times. Hopefully I can get it together!  Edit-- I'm also realizing how much of a prick the driver training me was. I got on the accelerator as I was easing off the clutch in first gear like you would in your car. It jumped and was jerky every time and I sorts just assumed that was normally and he never said a thing.  Edit again-- so the shifting happens very quick right? And it shouldn't take too much force to upshift? Also when you say increased range going from 4th to 5th (after preselecting) do you just mean the increase distance you have to travel with the stick from the 4/8 hole to the 1/5 hole? So increase the RMP just a little for that?"
Trucking,36dc8n,eog_prod,0,Mon May 18 20:12:04 2015 UTC,"No sir not a quick shift, i.e. slower than a passenger vehicle manual. At first you should be watching the tachometer until it becomes second nature. As to your second question, yes to compensate for the increased shifting difference, but also for the difference in gear ratio from one range to another. Example... In a 9 speed, when going from low to high range, 6th gear was installed to bridge the gap between ranges so the ratio difference is negated. In a 13 or 18 speed the top range is split for every gear so the range ratios are greater, meaning a greater rpm diffrrence between the low and high ranges because 6th gear, which is usually on the high side of 1 is just not there. 6/7 is on the high side of 2 or 2/3 (18spd).  So while this all might be confusing to someone who has no experience with a 13 or 18, in essence there is a greater difference in ratios between the low and high range, so for that specific shift there is a greater difference in rpm. So instead of a 400 rpm difference there might be a 500 or 600 rpm difference. Hope that helps."
Trucking,36dc8n,eog_prod,0,Mon May 18 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"Also, there is a technique called ""double-clutching"". The idea is to unlock the input shaft from the engine in order to smooth the shift. It can help you get the knack of clutch-free shifting until you have it down.  To double-clutch, you briefly and partially press the clutch pedal in to pull the shifter out of gear, and then again to put it back in to gear. Clutch shift release, clutch shift release. A lot of companies want to see you using this technique because it is easier on the transmission, but it greatly reduces the life of the throw-out bearing and the clutch fork and linkage."
Trucking,36dc8n,eog_prod,1 point,Mon May 18 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"This is how I had researched to do it. Does this also work for downshifting? I feel really confident in my ability to up shift without the clutch given the proper supervision and pointers in the cab, downshifting might have be supplemented with double-clutching for a while if that is possible?"
Trucking,36dc8n,TCBloo,0,Mon May 18 22:10:55 2015 UTC,"Double-clutching works for any shift. It especially comes in handy for downshifting on a down grade if it ever becomes necessary. Once you get downshifting, time to start working on the double-down shift... downshifting 2 gears, which can come in handy when getting off of interstates on short exit ramps and  other situations."
Trucking,36dc8n,TCBloo,1 point,Mon May 18 22:31:35 2015 UTC,"Someone else will have to help you with the 8LL but ""floating"" means shifting without a clutch, much easier when you get the hang of it, get it up to around 1600 rpm's, lightly let off the pedal while simultaneously pulling gear shift out of current gear & slide it in to the next higher gear without the clutch. Downshifting this way is harder, let rpm's get down around 11-1300, without using clutch slip it out of gear, hit the pedal up to around 1600 & put it into the next lower gear. Its about the same as clutching rpm wise, just takes practice doing it smoothly. Your knee will thank you for learning to shift this way, especially all the stop and go that comes with driving a dump truck, my Brother used to do it. Sounds like those guys are pricks."

Trucking,36b0lj,Ozdriver,6,Tue May 19 01:07:41 2015 UTC,"Man... this brings back a hilarious memory from when I was full time OTR. So anyway, I was on the truck with my trainer at the time, I was driving and the trainer was asleep. Somewhere in WV, mountainous area. Noticed fuel gauge was a bit low, I woke the trainer up and said maybe we ought to stop and fill her up... look at GPS next fuel stop was 94 miles. ""Yeah we'll make it, I'm goin back to bed""   A few miles down the road red light on the fuel gauge starts flashing and the buzzer comes on. I can feel the rig losing power. SHIT. SHIT.   We're just cresting a long hill and the trainers in the passenger seat  cursing up a storm. I told him I saw a Shell station sign 1 mile out and I told him ""We need to stop there, we ain't got no choice!""   ""We can't stop there, overhang is too low!""   At this point the truck is sputtering, coughing and belching out massive clouds of white / grey smoke. Must have ingested some sediment.... we take the downgrade. Truck stalls on the downgrade but we have plenty of air left.... I brake the truck down and pull off at the exit, still doing about 20-25mph. Get right up to the Shell station and realize that the bobtail will clear the overhang but the trailer won't.   I pull off to the side of the road and unhitch the trailer, crank the truck back up and with it barely running and at this point we're black stacking and throwing small flames out of the stacks, manage to back it in between 2 diesel pumps. We filled her up and I think it must have taken 400-500 pumps of that primer to get it going again.   All the while everyone in that Shell station was looking at us like we were bat shit insane, those slow pumps took a good 40 minutes to fill each 100 gallon tank.   A massive line forms waiting for us to fuel the truck.... people are getting out of their cars and watching... taking videos and pictures... and then...  Cops show up. Trainer has to explain his massive brainfart and gets a ticket for illegally parking a trailer... which ended up being like $400.  We managed another 10k miles before the $13,000 injector pump called it quits, and lets just say he no longer runs low on fuel.   TL;DR, Don't run a big rig outta fuel. You'll regret it."

We went over it so many times, i see slack adjusters in my sleep.  The showers at truck stops are a lot cleaner than our terminal showers. No matter how clean they look, wear shower shoes, and leave a buck or two for the poor soul that has to scrub your ass hair off the floor.  The money so far isn't bad. I'm told it gets better. Your milage may vary.  Backing was a bitch for me, but it gets easier every time I do it. Get out and look every time you back, and you will know what or who is behind you.  As I stated, I'm only a month in, but I have cussed a 4 wheeler, so I guess I'm a real truck driver now. There will be days where you wished you stayed in school.

Trucking,368btg,you-know-whats-up,3,Sun May 17 09:17:01 2015 UTC,"I really know nothing about cars or trucks. The most I can do on my own car is change the oil. Any diagnostics or fixes have been done by my dad who essentially has gasoline running through his veins. How much of a detriment would this be to me if I decided to pursue this? I know they teach you a lot at the schools, but I'm leary of how much information I'll actually absorb based on my history in school.   I was in the same positions. It wasn't an issue. It took a while to learn everything for the pre-trip, though.   What kind of route can a new driver expect? Would it be mainly regional or all over?   Most likely you'll be OTR. I think I went to 43 states or so just in training.   I honestly don't mean to sound like a priss with this next question, but what would I be able to expect in terms of hygiene? Like how often would I be able to shower? And where? I haven't done much traveling and the rest stops on the NJ Turnpike definitely don't have showers.   As long as you can get to a truck stop (petro, flying j, loves, TA, sapp bros, wilco-hess) you can get a shower. You can shower for free at most truck stops if you fuel there and have one of their cards. protip: if you're going to do this, see if you can order a petro/TA card before you leave for training or a company or anything like that. they mail it to your house, you don't want to be on the road without one.. The cost is like $10-13 if you don't have any free showers or points. For times when you can't, I recommend wet ones and baby wipes. It's about as close as you can get to the real thing. (i pulled flatbeds, you get filthy pulling flatbeds, but its fun. i recommend it)   How hard is it to back one of those rigs up? Because I honestly see myself missing my mark and/or hitting something if I tried tha   It was miserable for me, but I pulled a flatbed.. Rarely have to do any kind of alley docking anything. Many shippers and receivers generally operate during normal business hours, so there aren't too many times where you're pulling into a truck stop super late - rarely had to worry about finding a spot."
Trucking,368btg,darthn3ss,2,Sun May 17 09:44:02 2015 UTC,"Hard to say how much you can make. Anywhere from a local LTL part-time job that cuts your hours $20,000 a year to something over the road where your gone and only have a few weeks off a year you could be like $30-60k depending on what your doing and what company.  I'd recommend over the road. I'm local Driver and I'm making a shit low wage and plan to go OTR after my contract expires."
Trucking,368btg,adventure_dog,2,Sun May 17 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"I really know nothing about cars or trucks   That doesn't really matter, you just need to learn how to do a proper pre/post trip check your oil, fluids and tire pressure.   What kind of route can a new driver expect?   Don't count on getting a dedicated run off the bat, most new drivers start off with Over the Road driving and there's good paying companies that look for 2 years otr or people that show they can stick with a driving company.   I be able to expect in terms of hygiene? Like how often would I be able to shower?    most truck stops offer free showers when you fill up with a min. of 50 gallons of fuel. The truck stops have loyalty cards that keep track of shower credits and you can manage your fuel and credits so you could shower everyday if you wanted to.    How good is the money at first?   I made less than $18k my first year with a company that advertises ""up to $40k your first year"" There was a ton of down time due to waiting on shippers/receivers and dispatchers getting me loads.   How much does the money increase as time goes on?   The first year is the worst and it gets better every year but you may have to look for the better pay.   How hard is it to back one of those rigs up?   Don't worry about it, you'll get better over time. It's not the same as backing up a trailer hooked up to a pickup the concept is there but everything is bigger and you do need some depth perception. I personally felt it was easier to back up a semi."
Trucking,368btg,Sensei2006,2,Sun May 17 22:21:08 2015 UTC,"You could do this job knowing absolutely nothing about the mechanics of a truck.  If you can check fluid levels and notice when something is bent or broken, you can perform your inspection duties.  That said, knowing how to fix simple stuff will never be a disadvantage.  Depends 100% on who you work for.  So I have no input on where you may find yourself working.  Most companies looking to hire rookies are wanting them to fill OTR positions.  Regional and local jobs are a bit tougher to find, but they are certainly out there.  Plenty of drivers out there have never slept in a sleeper berth.  With very few exceptions, you should be able to make it to a shower every day.  Sometimes you may skip a shower so you can park at a rest area closer to your destination, but that's your choice.  If you go two days without showering, you or your dispatcher are doing something wrong.  Money varies extremely wildly from carrier to carrier.  I have a buddy that works 80 hours per week for 450$ per week.  Another buddy that makes 1,500$ to 2,000$ per week.  I work 50 hours a week (home daily) for 1,300ish per week.  That's why it is very very very important to do your homework before signing on with a carrier.  Backing up will be both the easiest and the hardest part of the job.  Some places have enormous, well maintained, well lit parking lots with straight line docks.  And some places will expect you to blindside back into an alley dock that was designed for 30' trailers.  Or you'll try wriggling into that last parking spot at the Flying J in Indianapolis between two oversized loads and a guy parked just far enough back for his trailer to be just barely in your way.  It's a skill you'll pick up rather quickly though.  Everyone is scared at first, but most everyone gets proficient at it."
Trucking,368btg,sstandnfight,2,Sun May 17 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"If you're near a truck stop, call and see if they have recruiting booklets in the driver lounge. Currently with a regional company. There is good and bad with everything.

Edit: wife called before I could pitch in more. Weigh the companies carefully and the trucking schools as well. I was able to pretty much carry over my training from the military, so I don't have much expertise with the schools. Just remember you have a right to ask questions. Ask if you will be able to choose the company to go to after a trucking academy. If you go with a company that trains in-house like Swift, ask what your contract obligations are. As another poster mentioned, companies that don't want to answer the questions will only get worse once you are contracted with them. I will answer any questions I can too.

Don't cry you need to be home the next day when your 1000 miles away. Go over everything when you are brought on. Pay, job discription, the truck you will be getting, do you share trucks, and more. It's best to be thorough off the get go. If it's a decent company they won't mind answering all these questions. As for backing up? Practice!!! I know guys who can back up super-b's in one shot, others it's a few tries. But good luck."

Keep in mind that this is a very different type of ""job."" The company doesn't just give you a truck, tell you to drive, and take care of everything else. They give you a truck, give you some dispatch information, and YOU take care of everything else. Mentally, that is. No you don't have to pay for fuel or truck repairs, but your dispatcher is going to get real tired of you calling in every time you encounter a new problem you haven't experienced before. You need to get to know your trainer very well and get his number, in case you run into something crazy. There is so much out there that can never be put into a training manual."

Also I usually recommend people as young as you consider getting established at something else first to fall back on if you want to get out of trucking after a few years. Ive met a lot of older drivers (my Dad included) that get trapped into this because the pay is decent and they dont know anything else to fall back on for comparable wages.
Trucking,367x9k,KingOfSpeedSR71,3,Sun May 17 01:17:19 2015 UTC,"OP, don't worry about autonomous trucks trying to take over. It simply will not happen in our generation. Beyond that though, who knows. I do recommend getting into a niche in the industry like skateboards, tankers, heavy haul etc to ensure both good pay and experience.    Many people on the autonomous vehicle bandwagon like to parade that this tech is only ten years away. Please, as if. We are STILL getting emissions equipment bugs worked out from the past ten years. Not to mention even the most advanced autonomous vehicle today is useless if it so much as sprinkles a bit of rain or flurries a bit of snow in it's direction. Not to mention these things rely way too much on signs and road condition. They lack a driver's intuition, the ability to look into a situation and discern outcomes other than what's obvious, and a driver's self preservation or even self sacrificial instinct/tendencies. Not to mention any other responsibilities that fall upon the driver.  There is a mountain of legal, infrastructure, economic and even moral reforms in the face of autonomous vehicles. They have a lot to prove and a long way to catch up, I would not give them any credit yet. But I also wouldn't dismiss them either."

The models they are talking about being available in 10 years are capable of little more than cruise control.  And that still requires close supervision from the driver.  You won't be turning on the autopilot and going to bed.  Local jobs will stay pretty much the same, since driving the truck is the smallest part of what they do.  Unless the entire transportation industry changes to allow truly driverless trucks, there will always be a human at the helm."

Yes,  the robots are coming,  and there will be a time when the human truck driver will no longer exist.  Thankfully we are just at the beginning of this age.  That autonomous truck that Freightliner has been showing off still needs a human driver,  and I dont think its approved for 48 state use yet,  and who knows how long it will take for that.  And we're still quite a bit aways from full autonomy.  In short,  you probably got anywhere from 10-20 years to be a trucker.  Expect the pay to keep decreasing during this time though.

Trucking,362k0n,JessicaRahbbit,6,Sat May 16 20:14:17 2015 UTC,Claims departments run it through the insurance if product is rejected for damages or any reason. If it is still sellable they find another buyer. If not they say do whatever except sell them. The shipper pays for defects.
Trucking,362k0n,emersonlakeandlagoon,4,Fri May 15 23:27:19 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not a driver for Costco. I drive for a common carrier. That means that we haul whatever freight our customer wants to wherever they want. In this case I was taking the load from the manufacturer to the store DC.   Usually, it isn't the entire pallet that gets rejected, usually just q case or two. In those circumstances, I call my company and they either say take it to a food bank (if it's larger) or ""do whatever"" which is how I once got two and a half cases of Arizona ""Mucho Mango.""  As for who absorbs the cost? Costco doesn't pay. The manufacturer writes it off. I have to send a tax receipt to claims later."

Trucking,362k0n,TechnoEquinox,4,Sat May 16 02:03:45 2015 UTC,A tax write off means they won't pay taxes on that pallet or income from that said pallet.
Trucking,362k0n,MacuahuitI,3,Sat May 16 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"I'm sure certain operations may be different, but in intermodal, often the customer or shipper eats the cost. It's not just the drivers problem. It's an issue that includes the dispatcher, the customer, the shipper, multiple facilities, sometimes restack or lumper fees, the accessorials department and the payroll department. It could also be charged back to the rail, or the previous delivery company. It's a mess for everyone"

Trucking,362k0n,snatale42,4,Fri May 15 20:09:23 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, Costco is VERY anal about shit like that. The shipper will have to put more wrap on the pallet and/or airbags between pallets next time, and if it really bad, they will make their packaging engineers design a better case, one that leaves less empty space on the pallet. If R&D designs a case that leaves 6+"" of pallet uncovered on one or two sides of the pallet, that kind of thing will happen a lot, and Costco will get pissed at the manufacturer."

As a dispatcher its one of my perks, when damages come into the office that we can't donate but are still edible/usable, we pass them out in the office.  It sucks knowing that it's just a small problem that adds up to loss of money, therefore, increase in prices."

I just assume they probably deal with some gross shit. Especially if they also clean the bathrooms and trash bins.   If the room is gross I won't tip obviously.   I don't up the blue beacon people though. They charge 50 bucks for a 5 minute cleaning of the tractor, 10 bucks to spray down the engine bay, and another 5 to spray liquid they claim to be RainX that doesn't work anyway.

Local gigs are not usually forthcoming and I got lucky, I still make less than some companies pay OTR trainees.  I made a laughably small amount with them before this.  I was running a little less than 5k a week team, and I broke $500 once.   Watch out for contract length, force teaming, an emphasis on leasing right away.  Even CRST is a better starter company than CR England.  I hear Western Express is in the same shit boat, although US Express has always seemed competent and I have liked delivering loads for them.

That sums up my downtime.  Honestly? This industry may not be right for you if you plan on making any real money. Theoretically, one could survive in a rig getting by, without a huge visible gain, but not sinking either, but then you'll get itchy and wanna drive more and do shit less.   If you have your little heart set on it, go for a megacarrier Reefer division. A few of my friends are Reefer here at Prime, and they regularly see less than 2000 .mi a week. I Flatbed, which is much busier, faster, and less unstable, so I run as near as makes no difference 3,200 .mi a week.   Reefers sit a lot, primarily due to volume of trucks versus shipping hours versus laziness of loading crew. One of my buddies rolled into Dole once, loaded. It took them sixteen hours to get him into a dock, and three more to unload. He deadheaded eighty miles afterwards to some clothiers, who took another ten to get him loaded.   Twenty nine hours, less than eighty miles."

Thing is, I'm not planning on making ""real money"": I'm currently making enough to keep my head above the water, and if there's any way to do something else (even if it doesn't pay well) and keep the blog thing going, then that would be a pretty good deal to me. My current ""job"" can be done on the go, and I've gone on a few extended trips abroad where I could just ""work"" away in youth hostels and coffee shops. It was a pretty cool experience, since I didn't need to take time off or be accountable to an office back home with a boss and coworkers.  Ideally, I'd be looking for the kind of job that would make most drivers say ""this is bullshit, I have to sit in my truck for hours waiting for someone else to do their job, aaargh"": what would usually be an annoyance to others is a boon for me, since those are hours during which I can do my own productive thing.

Swapping loads and rescuing shit and letting daycabs come sit at a dock for you to meet you at a TA because you're the only guy in Wyoming at the moment who is consistently on time.  Sucks till they stick you in a local dedicated fleet an hour from home, then it just sucks that you make just enough to not seriously consider leaving unless it's for another local job.

Lotta days like today I shut down 5:55pm and I deliver down the street at 8:00 in the morning so thats quite a bit of time to work on a blog plus I killed about 3 hours today getting here. Tomorrow I may get a load that makes me run all my hours out and only have 8 to work with tomorrow so I would have time again to do something. The problem for you might be lack of consistency, every day is different. I maintain a website myself, just a hobby, I don't make any money with it and haven't updated it for a while, not due to lack of time but lack of ambition."

They're more about quantity of loads than quality, so you'll be looking at >$1.50 a mile. :/ After fuel, their awful price gouging, and maintenance, it isn't pretty.   Also, if you flatbed, you pay for your own gear. It comes out in little chunks of $75 a week. It's neat, cause it means you keep it all if you leave, but still... Yikes."

Trucking,35zmx8,eog_prod,-1,Thu May 14 23:38:17 2015 UTC,"It's not that hard to do.  But, you've gotta run Renegade-style.  Think about all the time you waste waiting for an idiot to move out of your way in the fuel island, the morons trying to pass each other at 62 mph on a two lane, the waiting 22 more minutes until your qualcomm or elog says it's ok to drive. The wasted time goes away when you're logging on paper.  Now, pretend you have a company that is OK with running 80 mph when necessary..  6000 mile week is easy. edit it's also probably running on 4-5 hours sleep per day.  edit 6000 isn't easy.  It'll wear you out.  But, it's easy math."

There are some local or regional gigs where you might only haul one thing all the time. You will need to be OK with running illegal most of the time. The only difference in hos is they are exempt from the half hour break. There can be really good money in it if you go hard and get in with the right people.

It's just a different way to do the same thing. Split rims were used because you couldn't bend the tire around the rim.

Put your resume and cover letter UNFOLDED in a large 9""x12"" envelope and SNAIL MAIL the envelope to THAT PERSON you found on LinkedIn, using Google Maps to find the address.

Played with trucks allot growing up. Video games likes GTAV help alot too believe it or not lol. It's the best way I have found to visualize the attack angles and what is expected of the truck in order to pull off the maneuver.   At the end of the day, practice makes perfect. When I studied to get my cdl, I did it on my own. I went out and BOMBED the backing test from the state department. The DOT officer was kind enough to give me the dimensions of the ally dock test. I went back to the yard, found a dozen or so cones and set up the test myself. Spend two entire days repeating the maneuver over and over again. Different angles, different this and that until I was comfortable with what worked best. Went back and nailed it with a 53 ft spread axle flatbed. This was 3 years ago. I started pulling refer in early March. It's been a really good refresher on backing since most of these places I'm sent are total clusters.  Good luck out there hand."

Trucking,35vvuk,admiralranga,5,Thu May 14 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"Buy a toy tractor and trailer.  Ideally one with steer tires that turn.  Do backing scenarios with it so you can see how the trailer responds to what the steer tires and tractor are doing.    Also  imagine an arrow on your steer tires pointed towards the trailer so that when you turn your steer tires the arrow turns with them.  Turn wheels to the right? Arrow points left.   The backs of your steer tires point to where the back of trailer is going.  Goal, goal, goal. Get Out And Look.  Don't be afraid to stop and give things a look over.  I always do it when I'm getting to a dock that I've never been too.   It's saved me plenty of headaches besides helping with backing: canopies, nail boards, places I'd drag my tanks, sheets of ice and the bottom of steep ramps, dock locks that would wreck my lift gate, etc   It's a nuanced thing, just be patient, make note of where you need improvement, and don't sweat it."

A standard 240-250"" WB truck with 48-53' van/reefer is a cinch to get the hang of once you do it enough and get comfortable with it. The two things I always remember is to stay calm and drive the trailer, not the truck. One easy way to do this is to grab the bottom of the steering wheel and whichever way your move your hand is the way the ass end of the trailer will go (N/A to doubles/triples).  Just keep a level head, watch how the trailer is reacting and practice. And GOAL. No one is going to take away your birthday for practing GOAL.

What are you having trouble with specifically?   Here's the ""foolproof"" 45-degree backing technique I still use: drive up along side your parking spot on your left, maybe 6-10 feet distant. Trailer as straight behind as possible. Go past your spot maybe another 6-10 feet and turn hard right. Continue until you are 6-10 feet away from a barrier, or your tractor is parallel to your spot, whichever happens first. Turn hard left, watching for the tail of your trailer to travel past the corner of your spot about 6-10 feet.   Now start reversing, continually checking the tracking of your trailer wheels, the tail swing of the trailer (especially the blind side!), and the tracking of your tractor in all your right side mirrors.   It's hard to explain in text, but look up some techniques on YouTube or something. Practice, practice, practice."

Once you get calm you realize you have as much time as you need, and who cares who is watching...everyone has been there once too. Always try to get set up on your good side. Go super slow with your 4-ways on. Learn, remember how your truck handles tight cuts...every truck is different. Don't oversteer/correct, make small slow corrections. Look for the tire tracks from the last guys who backed there and try to match it. It's like playing pool, you need to learn how the angles feel. Everyone can learn, driving truck has been done for decades by uneducated people. Just stay cool, take your time and watch how your equipment reacts to what you do. Its all about staying cool."
Trucking,35vvuk,Bonus77,1 point,Thu May 14 02:03:12 2015 UTC,It took me a month before it clicked.

I found I had no real strategy to set-up the back and that put me in terrible angles making it harder to do from the start. Once my dad showed me how to set it up more consistently that made a world of difference. For me it was all the things leading up to the actual backing that made it hard.

I would change the views. Birds eye view helped the most because I understood how the directions of the steering wheel affected the trailer.

If you're getting too close to something on the left while backing, turn the steering wheel towards the left to correct it (unless you're almost on top of it, then just pull up instead).   Yous should pull up as many times as you need to. If you're unsure whether or not you're too close to something on your blind side, just pull up until you can see both sides of the trailer in your mirrors. You're not going to ""one shot"" it every time, especially when you're just learning.   Take advantage of all your space. There's not such thing as giving yourself ""too much"" room to work. If you don't give yourself enough space when setting up though, you will only make things harder for yourself."
Trucking,35vvuk,Hard_at_it,1 point,Thu May 14 06:18:56 2015 UTC,"One of the big factors I find with new drivers is the stress and anxiety they self inflict thinking they are being watched and/or judged.  The other problem it's just lack of experience on how your tractor will influence your trailer movements. It will come as sort of an epiphany, and very rapidly you will become much faster, safer, and capable.   I've been doing this for years, and I blow approaches all the time, however I can identify when I'm on a bad track and either make early corrections or pull ahead to restart.   I always preach practice if you see a safe opportunity to back in at a customer, truck stop, drop lot, company yard, ect. Take the opportunity to develop your feel."
Trucking,35vvuk,kdryan,1 point,Thu May 14 11:51:48 2015 UTC,"That bullshit about pulling up only one time is for the test.  Out on the road, take as many times as you need and screw everyone else.  With time you will acquire the skill, but it won't happen overnight or even this month.  It may take years before you're good enough to back into a door on the first time, every time.  One common mistake I see is that when people do pull up, they only pull forward a few feet.  If you have the space, use it!"
Trucking,35vvuk,MacuahuitI,1 point,Thu May 14 22:25:02 2015 UTC,"Heck I had one of those days today.   Driving tanker, I don't normally have to back but every now and then a customers tanks are in a weird spot.  But that wasn't the thing tonight. I had to take an empty to another one of our yards and bring home a full. When I got to where I had to drop this trailer, the only open spot was between two other trailers that were actually pretty tight already and the lot was small. It took me a good 5 or 6 pull-ups to finally finesse it into place.   Anyway, the thing I was going to say is this: There's a few different techniques to backing. There's the ""Steer towards trouble"" the ""Turn in the direction you want the front of the trailer to go"" and the way I learned but haven't really heard anyone else talk about.  The way I do it is take the bottom of the steering wheel and turn it in the direction that you want the back of the trailer to go. Its basically the same as saying to go right, steer left, but for some reason that's the easiest way for me to visualize what to do.  Grab the bottom of the wheel and push it the way you want the back of the trailer to go. And go slow: Stop, visualize, then go.  Maybe it'll help, maybe not, but we feel your pain. When I first started there wasn't a week that went by that I didn't seriously think about quitting. Hang in there, it'll happen"

I have seen some scary shit out of them though.  Was in a tire shop in ontario, canada one day, and a camper dealer brought one in for tires, you could put your hand between the tread & casing, and twist it, and another one, a guy wanted a tire fixed (this is 2008 BTW), and the tires he had on it haven't been made since the early 80's... yeah...

Trucking,35tu7o,buhrzzy,3,Wed May 13 14:01:23 2015 UTC,New truck with a remanned engine so you can avoid emissions pretty much
Trucking,35tu7o,ohmygodbees,2,Wed May 13 15:30:50 2015 UTC,"You're gonna have maintenance any which way you go.  These newest emission standard engines have a lot of bugs worked out, still a lot of sensor issues but most of the major kinks are smoothed out...atleast we aren't still cracking egr coolers and dropping the def comb while we are going down the road.  With that said, trucks are, emission standards compliant or not, a very mechanically complex machine doing a very physically taxing job. If you're planning to let a shop do all your medium/light maintenance you're doing it wrong from the start. The only time you should have that truck in a shop is because you don't have the necessary tools or knowledge to get the job done- and even then you need to pay very close attention and ask the mechanic what he is doing at every step so that you can do this without him next time.  Now with all of that said, gliders running the 12.7 remaned dd60 are alright trucks. Make sure you get one used, or go with a dependable company that will cover any engine issues in it's first year or two. A lot of these remaned engines have problems breaking in, some have even flat out blown in the first several thousand. The signature glider from out favorite scam artist blowing a head before 50k comes to mind.  If you can grab a '12-'14 modern emissions standard engine and grab it for a good price I'd say pull the trigger. If you're finding this is be too insurmountable a task, gliders can fill that need very well.  Go brand new and you can get yourself a 6nz, dd60, n14 or E7. Hell if you look hard enough you can find a brand new of either of the 4 in the back of truck papers."
Trucking,35tu7o,probable_alcoholic,3,Wed May 13 16:04:01 2015 UTC,Fitzgerald gliders come with a 4 year warranty through DD/CAT now.
Trucking,35tu7o,sledge07,2,Fri May 15 01:48:03 2015 UTC,"So my situation is either 5 year full maintenance lease on new tractor or buy a glider and dodge emissions. I do not want to buy a new tractor. We would have 3 tractors in the fleet and one of the drivers would be doing routine maintenance (40 year driver), but that's probably not even the ""medium"" maintenance you're talking about.  So, I do not have the knowledge/tools necessary, it will be going into the shop when something goes wrong. Which is why I'm looking at leasing---but at the same time if I can save $20k up front and dodge emissions issues with a glider kit, that's a very appealing alternative that I'm trying to... talk myself out of? I don't know, that's why I'm asking."

Trucking,35qa97,DorkJedi,2,Tue May 12 18:59:17 2015 UTC,"If you have no responsibilities to the truck or the load/unload, you can go off duty."
Trucking,35qa97,socialrage,1 point,Tue May 12 20:41:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed, if you are responsible you are on the clock. I dropped at Costco and WalMart- neither of which is driver responsible unload. (WalMart allows you on the dock to watch, but it is a major PITA to do, and the company would not hold the driver responsible for WalMart unloads anyway)"
Trucking,35qa97,adventure_dog,1 point,Wed May 13 00:37:03 2015 UTC,The way it was explained to me was if they told you a time then you could log off duty. If you were in a holding pattern then you should be on duty. Me personally when I was otr I'd log sleeper birth when loading or unloading.
Trucking,35qa97,TechnoEquinox,1 point,Wed May 13 01:43:02 2015 UTC,"If I'm not allowed on the dock the only place for a driver to go is in their truck. If I have a sleeper I'm going to log off duty and take a nap, why would you stay on duty if you have no obligation.  If I'm allowed on the dock to oversee or unload I legally have to be on duty and it covers my ass if I get hurt. If you're local and home everyday youre supposed to be on duty your entire shift except for your 30 minute break."

Trucking,35qa97,Earths_Mortician,3,Tue May 12 18:57:14 2015 UTC,My first week as a driver I left myself on duty the entire time. Had to do a 34 hour restart after 5 and a half days so now I put myself off after 5 minutes. Dot wants a minimum of 5 when you arrive and another 5 when you leave. It just sucks basically the only job where you lie about not working so you can work even more.

I only haul between my company's shops across Canada, so I always try to end up at the shop near Toronto at the end of my hours. They'll lend me a pickup truck and let me go hang out with my friends there instead of paying for a hotel room, which everyone benefits from. So, if I need those hours to get there, then I'll mark the other stops off duty. If not, then I mark them on duty.

Trucking,35qa97,Nigelpennyworth,1 point,Thu May 14 02:50:33 2015 UTC,"Late to the party on this one.  You can NOT log off duty while on customer property. You must log the minimum on duty loading or unloading time then either stay on duty or go to sleeper.  If you are outside of your truck on customer property you must be on duty.  If you get hurt while you're there and your log shows off duty, you're boned.  That's by the book.

Averaged about 2200-2300 miles per week.  Trucks are pretty nice.  Nothing top of the line, but definitely not terrible.  There's some rumors going around about some equipment that'll get put in the trucks over the next few years that'll make the trucks a LOT nicer, but being rumors, I'm not putting a lot of credit to 'em until I see it myself.  Entire fleet is automatic, almost every driver I've talked to has had no problem with 'em.  Bunk heaters, power inverters, yada yada yada.  Good stuff.  Another thing.  Broke my wrist a little while back.  Not entirely sure what happened.  Was unloading, then next thing I knew I was flat on my back and my wrist was broken/shattered.

You could certainly do a lot worse for a starter company, but you could do better if you have some experience. THAT BEING SAID, I have seen a lot of drivers who have been with them for 5 years or more. That says a lot in itself.  There is a big push inside Maverick about safety these days (seriously, a ""watch your shit"" message anytime you're going CLOSE to Indiana) and boy do they love to thump their chest about it. I've never cared for chest thumping of any kind, so it annoys me a bit when a company that only ten years ago was still a fly-by-night ish operation is now holier than thou since they are in ""compliance"".  I don't care for Freightshakers of any flavor, but decently specd trucks for a company whip. Most less than 2-3 years old.   Very good securement training and mentorship like training program. I still call my trainer once a week if for nothing else just to shoot the shit. Also, they have a 24/7 securement hotline for driver's to call if ever they have questions or concerns about a load. Always responsive and very courteous, no matter the time.   For the most part, a stand up honest operation. There are times you might need to get antsy with them on something, but they always come through. And they sometimes go above and beyond what you expected/wanted back from them. But they expect the same from you. Be honest and follow through with what you say to the best of your ability and Maverick will be a good place for you.

It totally screwed up the drivers that choose to drive at night and put lots of drivers on the road at the same time.  Also if you keep getting 34 hours out of work why should you not immediately get a fresh 70?  Those drivers that are wicked tired between 1 and 5 am are probably tired because they have crappy, could care less, dispatch and managers. The ones that want you to run all night after you get up drive a few hours, deliver at say a Wal-Mart, sit in the dock for 2 to 4 hours , and now it is midday. Then they want you to pick up a load at say 2300 that has to be delivered early the next day and is 300-500 miles away. It is this kind of crappy pressure.

To answer your question.. A, because of governors which you already learned and B because of weight VS hp. This should be a top post on /r/trucking so visitors can read and educate themselves.   Let's say you drive a 2013 Honda Accord, a low grade model that comes with... oh let's say 200 hp and weighs 3400 lbs with you and your family onboard. You have roughly .058 hp per lb to move your car right along.   My truck is a 2014 Freightliner Cascadia. It's equipped with DD15 Detroit diesel with a whopping 445 hp. Most of my loads have my total gross weight around 79,000 lbs. Sure, we have gearing on our side to help but at the end of the day my truck only has 0.006 hp per lb to move the weight. Not factoring in that trucks are big rolling wind blocks compared to your car as well.  Lets break it down. Your car makes .058 hp per lb where as my truck makes .006 hp per lb. To make it fair, it would be like adding 27,600 lbs BEHIND your car to get it down to .006 hp per lb. That's adding 8 more Honda Accords behind your car. Think your car would be as zippy then? Granted, you don't have gearing to help utilize the power but you should have an idea now as to why it takes so long for a big truck to execute a pass, especially if hills are involved. Governed speeds don't help either.   Weight is also a double edged sword when it comes to stopping."

Trucking,35qpkk,Gum-B,5,Wed May 13 03:14:25 2015 UTC,"Ill give my perspective.  My truck is governed at 62 MPH, many times I'm on a highway where the speed limit is 65.  I will catch other slow moving trucks that are doing an inconsistent speed, sometimes 65, sometimes 57, but overall they are averaging slower than I am going.  Following someone like this is extremely annoying.  I will wait for a break in traffic and attempt to pass.

Trucking,35qpkk,Injectingspores,4,Wed May 13 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"Most companies limit the speeds of their trucks for insurance reasons.  There are many trucks that are limited to 62 mph but there may be slight differences in how each truck sees that speed.  So one truck may be slightly faster than another.  Trust us when we say we hate slow passing.  We want nothing more than to get past and get over but we can't.  Another thing to account for is that trucks can be very heavy, 80,000 lbs in most cases, and that weight is very hard to accelerate in the top of the gear box."

Trucking,35qpkk,DR_JDUBZ,2,Tue May 12 22:53:06 2015 UTC,Most companies are self-insured so that blows that theory right out the window. They do it to save fuel and so first-years run the truck into the ditch at 65 instead of 80. With the dickheads they hire they damn well know that if their trucks could do 80 they would be driving 80 in 45mph construction zones at night in the rain.

Last night was a lot of fun in that we had to turn right from Broadway onto Columbus (on the corner is Lincoln Center).  Just before we got there an event broke and there were cabs parked three deep picking up passengers, some people even standing directly in front of the truck trying to hail a cab (it was crazy).  Then we get to the Javitz Convention Center and an event is breaking there with people everywhere.  This must have been a more expensive event because it was all black cars vs cabs at this event.  Once the delivery was done and then getting back to New Jersey discovered the the upper deck of the GWB was closed (where all the trucks are supposed to be) and only one lane was open in the lower deck.  About a 10 mile backup.  Ended up going north on the I-95 to I-287 (New York Thruway) over the Tappan Zee Bridge and back to New Jersey.  Got into the city at 9:00 PM, didn't make it to New Jersey until 2:00 AM."

We deliver cars and most of the dealerships are on the west side, so getting out we go north on 10th Avenue (which turns into Amsterdam) all the way up to 178th St., hang a left and the GWB entrance ramp is about 2 blocks straight ahead.  Except for last night when there were barricades and a police cruiser blocking the entrance.  We couldn't make a left (I say we because there were two trucks), so had to make a right which put us in a very residential neighborhood.  Ended up doing a three-point turn, coming back to 181st St., making a left and getting on the I-95 north.  What a night!

Want it to start turning left? Turn right. The back of the steers will face your left. Watch your mirrors, look for the inside corner of your turn, and aim your corner near that. The rest of the trailer will follow suit.   Basically, aim your trailer at the cone you're turning into, and guide it along that line. You'll get it. See you on the big road!"

It's the opposite of above, but blind side. Same premise though. One round of right in the wheel this time. Back counting to five. get under it to straighten it out until you locate the right side cone and back around it.  You can also practice your sight/blind side parallels the same way.

Easy yes, but nerves get thin at testing time. With me, they pointed to a few components and had me describe their function.

However, when I got into trucking school I was only about 30ish days clean after heavy smoking, I took one of those store bought tests and the line came back pretty faint(took it the moment I woke up that morning). So I drank some water, went to the bathroom a couple times, took a couple B vitamins, and took the DOT one when I got to school.

If it's drop and hook, great, you don't have to deal with loading / unloading, but the trailer you just swapped for hasn't been serviced in what looks like a decade. Or you drop a loaded and there are no empties, so you get to drive hundreds of pointless miles looking for one.   Crowded, stinky truck stops, no parking spaces available at the truck stops, or no truck stops at all when you need to shut down for the night.   For the first year or two, learning how to deal with all the little problems that no one warned you about.   Now that I'm regional intermodal dry van, home two days a week, pretty much all drop and hook, the worst I have to deal with is the occasional bad trailer, maybe have to get reworked once in a while with paper loads because it's overgross or overaxle, traffic, the clusterfuck that is the NSX Harrisburg intermodal yard on a busy day.   Nowadays, I'm usually doing 2-3 drop and hooks a day, and get 500-600 miles a day. As I did when I was OTR, I stay entertained mainly by audiobooks, podcasts, and music.

I deliver furniture, any where from 1-20+ stops. I usually have to unload or assist in unloading. Some days involve leaving North Carolina and driving 700+miles to get some where to deliver the next day. Some days I wake up at 9am in a motel and make the most deliveries I can while dealing with furniture stores rather limited hours before going to another motel or truck stop until the next day. This year I've only sat in a dock for more than 2 hours once. That's the nice part about the company I work for. They keep us moving."

People seem to think that professional drivers are going to be obsolete within the next few years, and that's simply not going to happen.  Truly driverless trucks are decades away at least.  As a start......  Let's say you have a driverless truck.  You still need to fuel it, inspect it, load it, and eventually unload it.  And that's if we're talking about a dry box.  Flatbeds and tankers are a whole different story.  People seem to think that the customer handles all  that.  Then once it gets to it's destination, it needs to be directed to the proper dock/location to be loaded/unloaded.  In order to automate this process, we'll need an AI capable of passing the turing test... as a start.  We can't even come up with a good AI for reading captchas yet.  And we haven't even talked about what happens when robo-trucker is involved in an accident, or has a breakdown.

No way a computer can figure that shit out.  The amount of math involved in intentionally jackknifing a medium duty single axle in the hood so you hop a curb to leave would defy the logic it runs on.  But it has to be done so you can park.    Then comes the delivery.  What delivers the product?  Can it figure out how to carry 2 liters into a store and navigate tight corners and weak floor joists?  Doubtful.

GPS devices are still a long way off, I used mine for the first time today in awhile (Rand McNally) from Castle Rock, CO to Englewood, CO it wanted me to get off I-25 N four times hop onto the county road that runs alongside the highway and get back onto the highway, when all I needed to do was stay on 25 until exit 196. Now imagine if a computer was running that then they get to the destination the GPS showed that the parking lot was a road the truck would have gotten in there then what? It would need a human in there to figure out what to do, the entrance was off to the left with a small sign barely noticeable.

I can only imagine what it'd be with the transmissions.  Those automatics are garbage.  The aren't horrible in my medium duty, but the OTR guys drive sticks for a reason.  How do they expect to go fully automated when companies can't even get a reliable transmission?  Not to mention maintenance.  Show me one company that takes care of its trucks, and I'll show you a company that owns only Pete 379s and hauls food-grade reefer.

The only major thing that's going to change is the education of the person in the cab, it's going to be more than just a 2 week training program. You'll be looking at an 18 month training program with refresher courses for new tech.   I'm sure someone will come along and give some bullish reason why I'm wrong and the operator will be non existent, and try to tell me there'll be people along the trucks route to do everything  for it at minimum wage. But that won't happen, there's a bunch of legal reasons why someone needs to be in that truck which most likely will never change. For the people that want to argue against that have no idea about the federal laws for trucks or what entails the everyday workings of a truck.

On top of that, these things can navigate meticulously mapped, laser-scanned roads. They can't adjust for construction, incidents, inclement weather, a teen texting who decides to merge into the rig...   Drivers. Are. Necessary.

It can see the teenage and avoid him before a human can.  It can figure out the best way around places by scanning the area. As for theft what about people stealing the load while the driver sleeps.  It also has cameras to record people around the vehicle.  I see the bigger problem being drug smuggling, load a driverless truck up with drugs, if it gets pulled over who's liable for the incident if there's no driver.  I suppose you'd have to follow it until it reaches a destination and arrest the revieve and then follow its route back to find the loader of it.  Driverless trucks will be here in the next 20 years.

They promise that Level 3 autonomy will free up the driver to do things work with shippers and receivers and other clerical work.    Both Schneider and Landstar have arrangements where independently contracted drivers book their own loads. No dispatcher, no fleet manager.  Those carriers do employ business liaisons to work the external customers when the unexpected arises.  As I understand it, many who work those jobs in carrier offices are already overburdened as companies try to reduce overhead.  Throw Level 3 autonomy in the mix, and even those business liaisons will become unnecessary as time is freed for the driver to handle clerical work and communication with the customer.  Jobs may be lost, but it may not be drivers, who will always be needed in a level 3 automated vehicle...  the losses may be incurred by those sitting in offices, who job functions are increasingly handled by the driver.  ATMs, surprisingly, created demand for more bank tellers, including those who could do more complex tasks like process loan apps, etc.  The automation of trucks is not immune to the Law of Unintended Consequences, either."

It sent me through the city one late night and tried having me go under a bridge that I would NOT clear! I didn't see the bridge height until I was right in front of it, as it was obscured by some trees. It was something ridiculous like 9 feet. THANK GOD I was bobtailing because it was a small road with not much room behind me so I was able to back up and turn around. I'd have been fucked if I was pulling a trailer. It was pretty terrifying.   Before that, in Illinois, it kept trying to have me turn down ""no truck"" roads.   The GPS in question was the Rand McNally 720.... An actual trucking GPS.

Taken apart it's pretty small. All my contractor friends did this. Some even decorated them with engraving and scrolling.   But be warned: these are not options for long term sitting. More than an hour and your back/legs start to hurt.   If your searching for a folding chair with comfort and gizmos then Costco or Sams Club have decent chairs of good quality most of the time. The Walmart chairs tend to have the tubing bend or the plastic joints crack fairly quick.   Bass Pro, Menards, and other specialty shops sells chairs. And they are decent. But the prices are too high for me to justify a chair I'll just get dirty, abuse, or have stolen.  Also look at some off road shops and websites.

Trucking,35e8ad,eog_prod,-1,Sun May 10 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"Seriously, go back to physics class. The panels create vortices which curl back into the direction of travel... into the pocket of low pressure also created by the panels, and subsequently into the rear of the trailer. I didn't realize I was going to have to draw you a picture."
Trucking,35e8ad,tsims145,3,Sun May 10 01:23:58 2015 UTC,"It doesn't create life per say, it reduces the drag, thus increasing the lift/drag ratio. This however is only a useful measurement when you are looking at airfoils, that need lift to keep something flying. The truck is only interested in the reduced drag aspect.   Source: I will be graduating in a week with a degree in mechanical engineering and have taken courses such as vehicle dynamics, aerodynamics, and fluid mechanics."
Trucking,35e8ad,eog_prod,0,Sun May 10 04:31:31 2015 UTC,We are saying the same thing. Sorry you can't figure that out. Is it an ego thing? Reducing resistance in favor of direction of movement is 'lift' whether to are lifting vertically or horizontally. That's all airfoils do. They reduce resistance in favor of direction of movement regardless of it's particular design. Ever seen a spoiler on a car? Same principle.
Trucking,35e8ad,tsims145,1 point,Sun May 10 15:52:00 2015 UTC,"By definition, lift is a force acting perpendicular to the direction of flow. Drag is a force acting parallel and opposite the direction of the flow. What this does is reduce that force acting opposite the flow direction. Nothing with the forces perpendicular.   A spoiler on a car is in essence an airfoil, but is meant to do the opposite and create more downward force for better traction/stability.   Didn't think I'd have to draw you a picture."
Trucking,35e8ad,eog_prod,-1,Sun May 10 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"A spoiler on a car produces downward force by slowing the air moving over the top of the car, essentially spoiling the airfoil effect the body of the car produces by moving through air. It also reduces the amount of turbulence created at the rear of the vehicle by slowing the speed at which the vacuum at the back of the car equalizes.  I used the term 'lift' because it best describes the equalization process that occurs at the back of the vehicle, If you are to much of a fucking nerd to be able to apply an analogical process to a different application than what you learn in books I pity you. Sheesh."

Trucking,35e8ad,redeemerspawn,2,Sat May 9 18:47:10 2015 UTC,"It has to do with the laws of fluid dynamics and the speed at which cavitation occurs. But other evidence works in your favor, such as the fact that tails are very common on Prime trailers who's trucks rarely go over 62mph. They would have to have seen some gain on test runs to want to buy into the tail fad."
Trucking,35e8ad,BiWinning85,1 point,Sun May 10 04:25:30 2015 UTC,it has to do with the arodynamics and drag. speed affects how much turbulance is created and how much drag affects fuel efficency. at speeds under 65 there's no net benefit. no real reduction to the drag from the air flow.
Trucking,35e8ad,redeemerspawn,1 point,Sun May 10 06:01:11 2015 UTC,basicly at speeds under 65 not enough drag is created for them to be benaficial.. the faster something moves the more wind resistance and drag the're is. same logic as why a plain has to reach a certain speed before the wings can lift it off the ground. if it's not moving fast enough wings are useless.

They claim to get a 6% fuel savings but that's probably assuming ideal conditions 100% of the time which is dumb.  My company runs these on all our trailers, and claim to get about a 2% increase in fuel economy. It doesn't sound like a lot, but a typical trucker burns up 18,000 gallons of diesel a year so it ends up saving about 360 gallons of fuel a year per installation which covers the cost of putting them on in the first year then it's just savings.  A lot of people don't want to have one more thing to deal with (the extra hassle of opening and closing them), and sometimes they get clogged up a bit with snow so you have to shake them out. The big carriers are adopting them for the most part because saving ~$1000/year per driver. They wouldn't be paying to put them on if they didn't actually do anything it's silly how stubborn people in this thread are."

Trucking,35dx7l,ALXD,7,Sat May 9 12:08:04 2015 UTC,All cars with incandescent lights have used halogen bulbs since the mid 80s. Do you mean HID headlights?

Trucking,35dx7l,ChuckinTucson,4,Sat May 9 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"On cars that come from the factory with bi-Xenon (HID), they have a built-in auto aiming function.  I have them on one of my cars and when they go on in the garage, you can see the light beam go up and then back down to the correct level.  When these morons retrofit them to their POS cars and think they look cool, that auto leveling feature is obviously not there.  They should all get fixit tickets and make them take them off."
Trucking,35dx7l,SaggyBagz,3,Sat May 9 19:58:07 2015 UTC,"The sale of HID's is definitely unregulated.  They even make actual headlamp replacements for the older square headlights of the 80's now.

Trucking,35dx7l,D_Farmer,1 point,Sat May 9 15:00:20 2015 UTC,It's not the bulb that causes the issue. It's the fact that we have people that just slap them in and don't re-aim the lights. When you replace the light with HID you MUST re-aim the light lower.
Trucking,35dx7l,06Wrangler,1 point,Sat May 9 16:32:12 2015 UTC,"While aiming would help, HID headlamps were designed to be put into a projector lens not a reflective halogen lens like 90% of cars have.

Trucking,35dx7l,06Wrangler,2,Sun May 10 12:31:53 2015 UTC,"The DOT had said that they were not approved for highway use, but most states don't have laws on the books about HID conversions so most cops couldn't charge you if they wanted to minus a catch all charge like ""Improper Equipment"" but 98% of cops wouldn't care unless it was them you blinded. The older ""retrofits"" are modified HID Xenon bulbs that go into Halogen refectors are the problem, and the ones that's aren't legal. The newer kits that come with replacement bulb housings and power inverters to stop that pulsating effect ARE legal, but expensive as hell and most people don't buy those."

I've just been told by numerous sources that HID retrofits are illegal. I'm not saying you're going to get pulled over or fined for them as long as you aim the headlights after installing."
Trucking,35dx7l,buhrzzy,1 point,Mon May 11 03:25:40 2015 UTC,"If you find a bulb that has the R in it, such as a H13R, it is designed to be used in reflector housings. Most H4 conversions for HID, come with the special reflector to keep it on the road and out of eyes."
Trucking,35dx7l,bsb2001ca,1 point,Sun May 10 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"It's the worst. They're unsafe as they literally blind the oncoming traffic. I was wondering what can be done about this. Can we lobby the government? Call for a study? I'm notifying my MP (equal to Congressman) this week, I've had enough."
Trucking,35dx7l,06Wrangler,3,Sat May 9 14:51:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like anyone who says this has never used them. They're similar to the cascadia LED's, or the older trucks that use the conversions. There's been many studies, mostly over in Europe where they've seen a dramatic reduction in deer collisions, even when they're forced into an enclosed circuit they stay away from the road because of the colour of the light. Secondly, the colour as long as it's more of the white than the blue, also helps you stay awake. Naturally we want to sleep, especially with the dull light of regular halogen. The white colour actually helps our minds stay awake almost tricking your mind to believing it's not as late as you think. LASTLY, I totally agree. You must aim them properly, or find a bulb that has the ""R"" in it. Such as they have factory D2S bulbs, and D2R bulbs. The factory D2R bulbs have blacked out spots on it so that the light from the Reflector style lense only points down road, the part that blinds you is the lower part of the reflector that bounces the light up. If you have a Coronado or something where you can see your lights closely. Cover the bottom half of your lights and you'll notice the light doesn't bounce up, and vice a versa when you cover the top part, only the signs will light up and not the road. Some acura's and Honda comes with factory his, but non blinding cause of that blackend out spot on them. I cover the bottom portion of my reflectors so they don't bounce up and into your eyes and only on the road, and the type of light that comes from HID bounces well Off signs so I can see the signs good anyways."

I take a few supplements like tart cherry and cranberry, d3, some b b vitamins.  I also mix up some super seeds and raw energy now and again.   It's a bit of a struggle at times to be healthy."

I looked it up, it looks interesting. I'll probably take my perfect pushups with me, along with the jump rope, and a whole lot of walking. I think 33 laps around the truck/trailer is a mile. So I've been told anyways.   Sounds like you have a good grasp on it. Hardest part of staying healthy on the road is staying away from that damn pilot pizza :-P"
Trucking,35bukj,BarkingLeopard,2,Sat May 9 01:42:05 2015 UTC,"I think 33 laps around the truck/trailer is a mile. So I've been told anyways.   That is roughly the equivalent of 70' long for a tractor and trailer together, so it sounds about right."

Trucking,35b0vc,EmptyPocket229,9,Fri May 8 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"People treat this as a big deal because one of the biggest draws to trucking for most people is noone looking over your shoulder, yes i know these are only activated when something triggers it but still, you have a freakin camera lens pointed at you all day. Companies complain about driver turnover yet they take away one of the biggest incentives to being a over the road truck driver so they can get a better insurance rate."
Trucking,35b0vc,adventure_dog,2,Sat May 9 00:50:36 2015 UTC,"Those cameras can actually be live streamed, they only record when an event triggers them to. I've been with three companies that use them and I've been in the office with the cameras being live streamed at all the places.  Tonight my boss and I were watching a driver that was put into one of our camera trucks so we can see why he's not able to make any of his gate times. we watched him sit through 2 red lights at 1am, not doing anything he was just sitting there killing time."

Trucking,35b0vc,ohmygodbees,-1,Fri May 8 20:13:02 2015 UTC,"Why should inside be off-limits? You crash into a schoolbus full of kindergarteners because the bus driver cut you off and brake checked you, What is there to prove you werent distracted in some way?"

Trucking,35b0vc,ohmygodbees,3,Sat May 9 10:05:55 2015 UTC,"I've seen it with three companies I've been with that use them, England said they couldn't watch you unless a triggered event the books about the cameras said the same, but you could walk in on the safety guy live streaming people he got a bigger second monitor to show multiple drivers. The night shift DM's were open about being able to watch drivers.  My friend and I had cameras in our werner trucks both our dispatchers were open about being able to view us live and they would question why we didn't pull into this place or that rest area to answer a qc message.  The place i'm at now is completely open about being able to view drivers live they have two truck with cameras and I've sat in the office with them pulling up the feeds.  Places like England and Werner will give you all kinds of paper work to sign about all sorts of things right down on how to conduct yourself in their cafeteria's but they wont give out any type of paper work for people to sign about these camera's."
Trucking,35b0vc,ohmygodbees,2,Sat May 9 23:05:09 2015 UTC,"It's proven.  My company has them, and they can pull up any driver at any time.  They admit as much, but say they don't have time to micromanage, so they don't."

Trucking,35b0vc,Otsuko,5,Sat May 9 20:25:14 2015 UTC,"I know, the only way to stop it is for drivers to leave, i know of at least 1 company so far that had to back out from putting cameras in all trucks due to too many drivers bailing. The problem with Swift though is so many drivers are new so they wont leave and those that have been with them for years are the kind of people that, if they can stand Swift for that long then cameras wont make them budge."
Trucking,35b0vc,ohmygodbees,4,Sat May 9 20:27:42 2015 UTC,"Well when you are driving, it is a work space and very clearly. When you are parked, the camera isnt even recording. Swift is using Lytx, so no, they can not look in and see you porking that 400 pound lot lizard at night, even if your moves would set off an event."

Then we will need people employed all along the automated trucks route to fuel it, inspect equipment/cargo/securement, maintainance, etc.    It will get very, very good before it gets bad.  And by that time we will all be dead.  In our lifetimes we will see autonomous trucks performing long distance line haul work on well mapped interstates equipped with sensors and the support network needed for automated trucks.  And on either end of the line haul will be terminals where humans perform the P&D work.  And there will be an explosion of these jobs with the increased demand and the aging work force.

Trucking,352e9f,SHADOWJACK2112,1 point,Thu May 7 00:09:48 2015 UTC,It depends on the application. I don't use retreads on my speak axle trailers or tri axle. They tend to get too much sideways wear and come apart. I bought a peterbuilt that had toyo retreads on it and we have over 130k miles on em no problem.  Heavy duty applications are not good for retreads either.   If I was pulling just interstate with tandems there is very little risk with them.  Just my experience.
Trucking,352e9f,five03rider,1 point,Wed May 6 17:10:17 2015 UTC,Thanks. What did you use? I've heard go Bandag if you're going to retread. Is there any other one worth mentioning?
Trucking,352e9f,knucklebone,1 point,Wed May 6 17:39:28 2015 UTC,"screw bandag.  They are fine for a local truck or a dump truck.  The only retreads i will mess with are a Michelin cap on a Michelin casing, or Goodyear cap on a Goodyear casing.  Everything else isn't worth it.  And if your running super singles, i would stay away from caps.   I have done the math, and it's not worth it.  You generally end up paying 75% of the price for a new tire, with 50% of the life in it. Your better off buying new tires, and selling your casings to a recapper."

Large companies will be able to supply unlimited capacity to their customers at a fraction of the cost.  I bet it also hurts brokerages as a whole… With excessive access to large capacity, the large trucking companies can keep customers happy directly.  I imagine these trucks will carry freight over open road to terminals, where local drivers will still do the pick ups and deliveries.  I see these things benefiting nobody but very large trucking companies.  They will drive down rates, and force the little guys out.    It gives shippers what they want:  Lower rates and better capacity."

It will be a very very long time before the truck is driving down the road with no driver in it. For the first ten-twenty years it will just mean the truck will drive itself on the highway then beep and warn the driver when the exit is coming and the driver has ten seconds to take over again and finish the run and back into the dock.  tl;dr there will still be drivers for a long time.

Homer ate the most of pep pills from a bottle in a small shop and then also some sleeping pills to ""balance it out"". However, he eventually fell asleep at the wheel. The truck then proceeded to drive itself. It drove down a cliff and stopped itself at The Gassy Knoll. Next morning when Homer woke up, he was so amazed that he told two truckers about it. They explained him that every truck has the Navitron Autodrive systems installed inside so they can drive themselves. The two truckers then threatened Homer to keep quiet. Despite of his promise, Homer soon told some tourists about the scam. When other truckers learned it, they chased him and formed a blockade. Homer let the system drive, but it told him that the system can't do it and jumped out of the trucker. Homer eventually got past the blockade.

Its the same technology that Daimler has had for a few years in the Mercedes cars. You can get this, its called 'driver assist', for $2500 as an option in the US on a C class Benz. So not likely to be hugely expensive on trucks.  However, this is just a refined adaptive cruise. The Inspiration will just stay in lane and track with traffic up to set cruise speed. It cant read traffic signs, change lanes, or take an exit.  What this translates to is just a little easier life as a driver, thats it. The Mercedes system works very well within its design limitations."

The next 2 weeks is still supervised and trained in a team state. The last couple weeks is like you said, all teams. However their training school isn't bad at all. I've been driving almost a year and have had no accidents, tickets, or bad inspections. I was confident behind the weel after leaving school. To be open about it though, I spent the first few summers of my school life in a semi, and driving things had always come naturally.

Trucking,34z5l3,yismeicha,2,Wed May 6 04:37:14 2015 UTC,"You're confusing the class of the truck with the class of the driver's license.  A is CDL, you can drive BIG trucks (i.e., Peterbilt, Kenworth, etc.), class B is more like school buses (you could or could not have an airbrake endorsement), Class C is an operators license, just what 99% of the people driving cars have.  As long as what you're driving doesn't have a GVWR of more than 26,000#, a C is okay."
Trucking,34z5l3,ohmygodbees,1 point,Tue May 5 23:42:51 2015 UTC,"Federal regulations require a class B or A CDL to drive a vehicle over 26001 GWVR/GCWR, depending on setup/combo. A class C license is required if the vehicle, under 26001 GVWR, is being used to transport more than 15 passengers or a placardable amount of hazmat. All states should have adopted these, but that's the breakdown in my state."

I have my experience written out somewhere if you're interested.  I always end up recommend ing Prime if you're new and having to go into a training company.

Secondly, if the AC has been run, and then someone turns the truck off, now all that water just kinda sits and can sometimes get a tad gross. Best thing to do if your running the AC and you have time, even in your car. After you turn the car off, leave the cold air on and let the condenser dry out.

They specifically run super-single tires on all their units because of superior traction and durability. After testing them for one full winter it was found that the Michelin tires grip better on snow and ice and, because they are inflated to 100 psi, wear better and have less rolling resistance than duals.   As to the ice question, they are great. I was stuck in Alabama this winter during the terrible black ice incidents and found myself on the highway during that time. I was very happy to have those tires and they helped me to get off of the highway safely when everyone else was sideways on the road."

Trucking,34ptqn,Go3Team,2,Mon May 4 03:27:52 2015 UTC,"""Superior traction"" is a very tricky thing.   On dry pavement they will have greater tractive force, but when you put rain, snow, and ice into the mix, it gets tricky.   Tractive force is related to surface area, power, and weight. A SS tire is gonna act like a snowshoe in winter weather, particularly, and you'll be more likely to climb up in the snow and spin out.   My company runs duals and I won't pull a truck with suicide singles."
Trucking,34ptqn,kellanium,5,Sun May 3 23:30:48 2015 UTC,"I ran singles with Prime and Werner, didn't have any good experiences with them. Both companies let the tires be mismatched and it was common to get recapped tires.  The recaps would come off in the heat like whenever I ran through states like Arizona in the summer, stop to get fuel and notice you're running a racing slick or two. In the winter time the traction was terrible I was just sliding all over the place and was better off staying put.  Last week the highway I was on had one lane shut down because there was an England truck that blew two singles on the same side and decided to stop in the middle of the highway to get them replaced.  I'm just going to assume that if you got quality tires and kept them the same you may have a better experience."

Trucking,34nxmi,CurlyNutHair,5,Sat May 2 23:19:46 2015 UTC,"Little to none. Generally drivers are treated as a necessary evil, not as the revenue generators. Transportation requires multiple people, however the biggest variable is paid the least.  Regarding the original question, telling me the truth. I've been lied to numerous times, and the end result is that nobody is happy; if companies and recruiters were brutally honest turnover would be reduced simply because people would have a more clear picture of what to expect. Everything else is superficial."

That raise led to the teamsters getting into one terminal, and the company fixed it with a big raise bringing just about all terminals on the same pay scale.  Now the biggest complaint is that we still work the dock unlike all of our big ltl competitors. There's talk about us going to a drop/hook system but it would require a system wide rework of the freight flow and I'm not expecting anything to change.

So what's the deal with having to have a new(er) truck if you live in California?  I see all kinds of old crap-ass trucks with CA plates quite frequently but I'm told I can't go into California in my '06 which has very low emissions.  Is there some sort of exemption if you live in California to the CARB rules?  If so that might help you out a lot."

Trucking,34iw3y,Kenny_Login,3,Fri May 1 19:35:49 2015 UTC,When you do the math having an old truck makes sense.   This truck is completely paid off.   It doesn't have a huge monthly payment to make so my boss doesn't care if I need a day off or want to take a long weekend.  It gets the same or better fuel millage than a lot of newer trucks.  If it brakes down you can fix it and rig it together to get back to town. Financially speaking your way better off driving an old truck than a new one.
Trucking,34iw3y,Ozdriver,5,Sat May 2 07:05:21 2015 UTC,"If you've got an older truck you want to make sure it's a KW or Pete, their construction is similar to an aircraft with aircraft type hoses, hose fittings, electrics, and the way the cab is constructed, it's all top quality construction and materials.  Only problem with pre-electronic engines is how we go with emissions laws. The CAT 3406B was probably the best of the mechanical engines, only disadvantage it is essential to replace main and big end bearings at around 500,000 kms.

Trucking,34jedk,eog_prod,2,Sat May 2 02:15:40 2015 UTC,I've never heard of that :| it does not sounds pleasant.
Trucking,34jedk,lostonyou,2,Sat May 2 02:45:48 2015 UTC,It's good for a chuckle sometimes but don't ever ask for help.
Trucking,34jedk,doinken,2,Sat May 2 03:06:04 2015 UTC,I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the warning.
Trucking,34jvxn,AlmightyApkallu,4,Fri May 1 19:55:29 2015 UTC,FL=70. CA=55.  FL decent roads. CA horrible roads. CA better pay for otr. FL better pay for local. The Keys will be much more difficult to have a local job without commuting to Miami area. Tampa would be no problem. PS. I've lived in both places. FL blows CA out of the water and the cost of living won't rape your bank account unless you live on the east coast.
Trucking,34jvxn,eog_prod,2,Fri May 1 20:19:03 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, thanks for the pro-tip. As you can see I'm a coastal type of guy. I love scuba diving, surfing, boating and generally anything to do with water. I LOVE California but I definitely recognize that there are other pretty beach places as well. One thing about CA and HI is they don't offer much opportunity for boating where as FL seems like a boaters paradise. I'd like to find a good local job that makes enough that would allow me to afford a nice boat (no yacht, just a new speed boat). FL would also offer great opportunity for SUP and Scuba and as you said, the prices seem quite reasonable.   I'm still curious about the other places but yeah, living some where like Destin or Tampa and trucking around locally, early in the day and going for a spin in my boat in the afternoon would be all out awesome."
Trucking,34jvxn,BarkingLeopard,3,Fri May 1 20:32:32 2015 UTC,"Check out the Tampa area.  On the causeways and bridges there, you see a lot of windsurfers and kitesurfers doing their thing.  Also, if you are home enough to make it worthwhile, boat clubs are a big thing in FL.  Instead of owning and maintaining a boat yourself, you pay $X/month to a club, where you can reserve and borrow any of a number of different types of boats (deck boat, speedboat, sailboat, etc), and they do all the maintenance.  You just pay for the membership fees and for the gas you use, and don't have to spend hours and hours trying to keep a boat clean and maintained.  Just a thought if you want some options for boating and are willing to spend the money on it."
Trucking,34jvxn,BarkingLeopard,2,Sat May 2 00:34:36 2015 UTC,"Oh, and cost of living in Tampa is going to be about as cheap as any similarly sized city in the country.  I imagine you will want to buy a house, but I have a friend who lived in Tampa a very nice (massive) apartment complex for yuppies, in a good neighborhood (not much walkable, but everything < 12 minute drive, and safe, and close enough to the highways and airport), and I think he paid $700 or $800 a month for a 600 sqft 1BR/1Bath.  Go a little more inland or into the burbs and I'm sure you can get something even cheaper.  I have lived in Dallas and Cincinnati and I would call the cost of living in Tampa about comparable or not terribly different to either of those two, espec if you 15+ minutes from the coast.  It's Hawaii, Cali , Chicago, and the DC/Philly/NYC/Boston strip on the East Coast where you get screwed on cost of living... NYC suburbs are 2x the cost of living as mid-sized cities in the Midwest like Cincinnati, for example."
Trucking,34jvxn,lostonyou,3,Sat May 2 00:43:52 2015 UTC,"I've grown up in fl(was not born) and moved to ca just for a change. I was paid 1,300 salary a week and worked local la. And all I can say is its not worth the headache of all the traffic in ca. Fl is a ton easier (except for Miami) and much better beaches in my opinion."
Trucking,34js91,AlmightyApkallu,8,Fri May 1 19:25:30 2015 UTC,If you think a 12 hour day is long don't buy your own truck.
Trucking,34js91,TruMoos,1 point,Sat May 2 03:30:10 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was thinking
Trucking,34js91,floydguitarist,4,Sat May 2 21:50:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's such a thing as 8 hours a day in trucking, at least not anything that pays decent. You get what you put into it, especially as an owner operator. Maybe gravel/ dirt hauling, but that doesn't pay a whole lot and I see those guys working 12+ hours a day/7 days a week."
Trucking,34js91,floydguitarist,1 point,Sat May 2 01:05:23 2015 UTC,"I work about 9 hours a day and am making upwards of 50k a year in a non coastal city. I've had friends who drive fuel tankers in coastal areas that make 70~90k a year and typically have a 8-10 hour work day. I almost got onto an account I knew some people on that made 48k a year and work 6 hours a day 5 days a week. There are a lot of dedicated route drivers who will work a normal 8 hour day and make plenty, it's no really uncommon."
Trucking,34js91,floydguitarist,3,Sat May 2 03:48:35 2015 UTC,"But, as an owner operator ? There is too much responsibility owning a business to get it done in 8 hours. Yes, the actual driving part might be done in 8 hours, but what about maintenance on the truck, paperwork, such as licensing, permits, etc.   Also, not every day is perfect, there is always going to be delays, traffic, weather, mechanical breakdowns, etc."
Trucking,34js91,GuyInAChair,2,Sat May 2 12:55:35 2015 UTC,"The only successful owner operators I know are the LTD drivers, and most of them work out of big cities.  Typically they work for, or contract for a big carrier. Their day will start at or before 6am when the grocers start accepting deliveries. A pallet here, a pallet there. They'll transition to LTD pick ups, and around noon start going to shippers picking up, what ever, to deliver back to the terminal to be placed onto various trucks.  I've known a couple of them, who make great cash doing what they do. But it's far from easy. They can probably back a truck up faster then most drivers can go forwards. They are out the door and onto the dock before the brake pots have evacuated all the air. They work hard for 10 hours per day, and their job is far from easy so they certainly deserve it.   It's possible to do what you're describing. But nearly every one of the owner operators doing local delivery are paid on a per delivery basis.  When you're pay check is based on the amount of work you do, you should do a lot of it, and you should definitely do it fast."
Trucking,34js91,TCBloo,1 point,Sat May 2 00:35:48 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of something where you drive from Point A, to point B, back to Point A and then you are off. I've heard of cattle haulers and various tanker drivers who do this as owner ops. Also, generally any commodity where you begin in a bigger city, go out to who-knows-where to pick up the goods and return it to the big city in a reasonable amount of time."
Trucking,34js91,adventure_dog,1 point,Sat May 2 03:50:47 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, most of that is seasonal, and you need to know people."

They're running for companies like walmart, ups, fed ex, old dominion, target, Lowe's.  They're also buying cheap trucks around 10 k +/- so they don't have to worry about a lease payment that they may not be able to make all the time."
Trucking,34js91,mega_donkey,1 point,Fri May 1 21:29:49 2015 UTC,"Having worked 5/2s with 10 hour days and 4/3s with 14 hour days I will go with the latter all day long.  I would rather have an extra day off every week than work banker hours for 5 days.  I can still gross 1500-1600 a week working 4 days.    As far as 8 hour days my union guarantees 10 hour minimum pay so as you can imagine we don't have many 8 hour days.  It's just a bad way to run trucks, you need 50% more drivers or the equipment sits."
Trucking,34js91,bestcheater,1 point,Sat May 2 11:15:07 2015 UTC,You're pretty much describing the dream for lots of drivers but I'm not sure if it exists. Most o/o's that I've worked work run a full 14 every day and a full 70. Truck payments are like another mortgage or worse.
Trucking,34jhy5,kellanium,3,Fri May 1 18:02:53 2015 UTC,"I had that happen once.  Ever since, I would get out and made sure the pins are locked.

Thought I got rear ended. Thought ""not a-fucking-gain"" called 911, got out an looked at the back, and realized my tandems had slid all the way to the back.   It's one of our older spring lever trailers, I think maybe one or two of the pins werent fully inserted* and it slid when the ABS errored out.   *That's what she said."
Trucking,34jhy5,TCBloo,2,Fri May 1 18:14:39 2015 UTC,I thought I was good with just a tug test once. I got pulled in at an inspection station and given a nice $200 ticket for not having any of the pins engaged.   Funny thing was that it scaled out right and it took me 30 minutes to get the tandems to slide far enough for the pins to lock.

Since there is a 'driver shortage' and truck drivers are in demand, why would they do things that quite obviously would turn drivers away from working with them? Especially the experienced ones in the industry!  I just recieved my license and im looking (Canada), and if this was brought up from a company i was applying to I would immediately turn it down."
Trucking,34i3hd,darthn3ss,6,Fri May 1 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"Because most Americans  (especially truckers) would off themselves before taking part in anything that even looks like organized labor.

He helped me fix (rewrite) a bunch of garbage code.  This garbage was written by arrogant peers and consultants.  On each piece of code, he instantly acknowledged my reasoning as to why the code was so buggy and unmanageable.  A couple of times I got caught for deleting and rewriting other peoples code and this kid became my accomplice for 2 glorious summers.  Everyone else thinks the systems are just settling down to working as they were designed.  Little do they know, the kid and I are deleting and rewriting thousands upon thousands of lines of code written by these fools."

I did my straight back and offset easy and got no points.   My 90* back up was where I struggled. Its funny cause I did it 100 times at the school and nailed it every time. I set myself up and began backing into the wrong lane. I tried correcting myself by jacking it a ton but I encroached the boundaries twice. (that's two points every time). So after 6 pull UPS. I decided to start over. I replaced my truck at the beginning of the 90 and did it in 1 pull up. I thought I failed but I ended up getting 9/13 on my back up.  The part I was worried about ended up fine. I didn't do the best on my drive test by I still managed to score a 17/30.  I'm at work while typing this and realize my format is atrocious. By 86/87 I mean I scored an 86 out of 87 total possible. I scored a 9 on my back up. The max I can score is 13 before I fail. I scored a 17 on my drive test, I could've scored a 30 before I failed.

Trucking,34hyw4,trogg21,5,Fri May 1 08:54:01 2015 UTC,"Given that I am cleared to drive could I immediately go and get my CDL?   You might want to check if you can get a federal medical (fed med) card.  Basically, truckers have to go to a doctor every two years for a physical.  They mostly look for things that would make you ineligible to drive.  I'm pretty sure seizures would be on that list.  Only a doctor could answer this, at least i cant.   Then as a driver are your responsible solely for the transport and delivery of goods or do you also have to load and unload the trailers?   depends on the company and even your specific route in a company.  A lot of companies say 99% no touch freight.  In my experience you touch freight a little more then that.  But you could get a route that is truly 100% no touch.  or 100% you unload by hand.   How does the entire thing work in general? Do I call up and ask for a load or does the dispatcher call me?   I would personally suggest at least your first job should be as a company driver.  The company will do all the work of getting loads.  They will tell you where and when to pick it up and deliver it.   Reading around I hear everybody screaming about not leasing yet no actual explanations besides it is a scam or it sucks or whatever. Anything with more substance?   My take on leases.  The leases they are screaming about are those offered to new drivers through the company.  You can only use this truck for the company you leased it from.  You lease it directly from the company.  They have leased it first, then re-lease it to you, making a profit off you there.  Then they have you take their loads, and pay you poorly for it.  You are financially responsible for all fuel and maintinance on the truck.  But they decide where you fuel and where you get maintinance.  They try to get you into one of their mechanics so they can make money off you that way too.    The companies push these leases HARD, because they make so much money off them and the driver takes responsibility for all the downside of owning the truck.  Truck down for a week?  fuck you pay the lease.  Getting shitty loads that don't pay very well? fuck you pay the lease. (and they decide what loads you get)  The ONLY upside to one of these leases that I have seen, is if you have shitty credit, you can still get a 0% down lease.  Just to give an anecdote about these leases.  A couple years ago I got back into trucking and had to go out with a trainer.  My trainer was behind on his lease because his new truck kept having to go in for repairs.  So while I was with him. he was living on the $100 a week he could get as a cash advance while fueling.  He was working close to 70 hours a week and making $100.  I'm sure you could easily find tons of other stories about the nightmare of leasing from these companies.   What about driving with a partner?   its called teaming or teams.  and yes it is very much a thing.  The companies LOVE teams.  That truck they are paying for is moving all the time, not sitting 10 hours a day while the driver sleeps.  The drivers ussually get paid a higher (VERY VERY small) rate.  You get to live with someone 24/7 in a area smaller then the bed I sleep on. I would guess that some people would enjoy this.  I do not.  IMO teaming sucks.   How do weigh stations work?   The company that trains you will show you how this works.  Every state is different, but all of them go something like this.  If its open, you pull in.  Get on the scale.  They tell you to keep going or pull around back and walk in with your paperwork.  If you run legally, 99% of the time you will just keep on trucking and will have wasted 1-5 mins of your day depending on traffic.    Do American trucks have retarders?   most do.  totally depends on the company.  A lot of the companies out there govern their trucks at 62 mph or 67 mph."

A seizure while driving would be a disaster. I wouldn't even consider it unless you and your doctor know for a certainty that it is behind you.   If you get your cdl, go ltl.

In his case a seizure killed him 1 month before surgery."

As far as the lease from the company, I heard nothing but nightmare stories. If you want your own truck after a year or two of driving for some company, I suggest you buy your own from a dealer. The reason is you can work for anyone without being tied to one place, and you get to control the make,model,and the speed of your truck. If you can swing it buy your own trailer too ,than you become a true independent driver. The responsibility is enormous,but rewarding. Good luck."

Trucking,34hyw4,00stephen,1 point,Fri May 1 16:45:57 2015 UTC,"6 -- Like leased cars, leasing a truck puts a driver in a vehicle he could not otherwise finance or buy outright... at the risk of increased exposure to the lessor.  Most leases shift the burden of ownership (including maintenance and repairs) to the driver.  If you lease a tractor, you are obligated to pay weekly payments on it... regardless if the company gives you loads and miles to pay for it.  As with consumer car leases and mortgage loans, there are many ways of arranging the payment schedule (1year, 3year, 5 year, balloon, etc)... and most benefit the financial institution more than the driver, otherwise they would not be in the business of lending money.  Many companies will lease used trucks, which increases the likelihood of maintenance and downtime... while decreasing the likelihood it would be covered under a factory warranty.  All that said, my advice would be to look for a TRAC lease (terminal rental adjustment clause lease) on a tractor that is new with a factory warranty."

Lots of stops during your shift so there's no time to be learning how to maneuver a truck. getting in and out of places quickly so others can get in too. Once a driver has been OTR, they have learned the basics and can handle situations that a new driver would be slower at. I have seen this first hand, it's obvious when drivers have experience (OTR).

Do it for a couple of years, fantastic experience then buy your own truck or go to another company if you want, but for now, having freshly gotten your CDL he's right, unless you want to live OTR it sounds like a pretty damn good gig. Cut your old man some slack, get out there and work. Who cares if you're the owner or not? If all you are concerned about is owning the truck something tells me you might not have the work ethic to make it successful. Your Dad probably see's this and is trying to teach you how to work hard. Owning something doesn't just mean ""Yay, I own mah' own rig"" it's damn hard work if you want to be successful."

Then, once youre done they say well we have decided apple will give u 35 dollars an hour. will you just be happy?   also ik 100% and i say 100% that im not putting his business in jeopardy. he refused to financially support my mother. i never gotten shit from him, living hungry with my siblings while he has 2m in assets(bought two houses in last 4 years) but not helping a single dime cause he hates my mother."

It's not because he changed his mind,  it's because he changed his mind right when I was gonna start workin on my own and everything I thought was settled.

Also, it's a hell of a lot more noticeable when people are trying to reach into your front pocket and accidentally grope your genitals in an effort to get your wallet than it is when they bump your butt and steal your wallet out of your back pocket.  I switched to a money clip wallet (clip for folded bills, a couple of pockets for cards) a few years ago, and it is great.  Everything I need in a space about the size of a credit card and 1/2"" thick.  Never even feel it in my front pocket, and it's not noticeable as a bulge, and doesn't leave the telltale marks on pants that a lot of guys get from wallets in their back pockets."

Trucking,349t8s,roguedriver,3,Wed Apr 29 22:55:47 2015 UTC,"On the fuel note, my ditch side tank always had significantly more fuel in it than my drivers side tank because of the crown of the road just due to Kenworth's fuel system in my 04 truck. I parked for the night with the truck sloping to the drivers side to try and balance things. Truck ran overnight because it was cold. I woke up the next morning did my pre-trip and hit the road. Not 2 kms down the road I ran out of fuel because the passenger tank was bone dry. I had to siphon fuel into a gallon jug and transfer over fuel then bleed the system to get the truck going again. Pretty bad to run out of fuel yet not be out of fuel...  Second good one. There is a 10% grade to get out of the downtown core in my hometown and an entrance onto the hill at the base of the grade. The corner onto the hill only allows you to have about a 25 km/h start. It was winter and I was inexperienced and had an empty super-b fuel tanker and took this way up the hill and made it about 2/3 the way up and spun out. Luckily the shop wasn't too far away and just had a loader come push me up but was totally embarrassing spinning out on the main route out of town."
Trucking,349t8s,Mongostein,5,Wed Apr 29 19:09:15 2015 UTC,I ran out but didn't run out of fuel when I first started. Waiting in line at a busy rail terminal with 30-40 trucks all around me and suddenly the truck stalled. Another guy got out to help and checked one of the tanks to find that it was bone dry. He started paying out on the idiot new driver who ran out of fuel until I opened the other tank to show that it was completely full. It was a 1970s Atkinson (this is in about 2005...) so mechanics had to spend an hour getting it running.  No one at the company bothered telling me I was driving a truck that would only take fuel from one tank.

So I hook up. Turn on flashers,etc get ready for my pre. Our mechanic shop at the terminal wasn't open just yet. I was checking the tires and one was flat. So I drag it over to the shop which was about to open continue checking things and focused on getting that done.

Trucking,348ot7,eloquencefails,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:38:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did a fair bit of research. I've grown up in a trucking family so I know what it takes as a person to be on the road all the time.   I guess I'm asking what I should expect that they don't say when you start up with a training company. My dad got his CDL moving up the ranks of a company he started with almost 30 years ago, so he doesn't have much advise on starting like this.   I see a ton of mixed reviews for Prime as well as the other starters, some being extremely bad and others full of praise.   I guess I just want to know if this is a good career choice starting with a company like this."
Trucking,348ot7,eloquencefails,3,Wed Apr 29 04:46:32 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  Thanks for clarifying.  I haven't worked for Prime but I went through their application process a while back and ended up backing out at the last minute to go to a private CDL school instead. I learned quite a bit about them as a company and their hiring process though.   There are companies out there that are better than Prime, but there are quite a few that are worse too.  Everyone's opinion will vary depending on their individual experiences, of course.  Prime is a training company, though, and as far as those go, their pay is a bit on the better end (~40cpm, give or take).  Not a bad place to get in your first year or two.  You may know this already but you'll either be doing reefer or flatbed with them, and you'll likely be stuck in a ""lightweight"" tractor, which has a smaller sleeper.   One thing they're picky about is work history. They don't like to see gaps in your employment.  I was unemployed at the time I applied because I was in college full-time, and they made me show proof of my enrollment.  It's probably the same with other companies too though.   Home time can be an issue with Prime. They expect you to stay out for a month or more at a time and then when you do get home, you've only got a few days before they're pushing you out again.   Overall, as far as places to get your career going, you can do much worse than Prime. I myself was initially drawn to their higher pay (versus other starter companies like Swift, CRE, and so on).  I've had a few friends work for them and aside from the lack of home time, they had no complaints.  They're definitely one of the better options as far as company-sponsored CDL training programs go.   Side note:  At some point during your training they may bring up the option of leasing your own truck. Politely decline!  Leasing isn't a bad thing (my fiancé and I are leasing, in fact), but it's not a smart move when you're just getting your career off the ground. You probably already know this (I feel like it's common sense), but just wanted to say it anyway.  :)"
Trucking,348ot7,darthn3ss,3,Wed Apr 29 05:35:03 2015 UTC,"I went through Prime's training last year.  Overall, I had a good experience.  I think a lot of the complaints with prime any other companies, are from people who go into this from a position of desperation. Maybe they don't want it, but it's a job so they think they can hack it. Some are from people who got their CDL and went into leasing thinking they were going to get the independence and freedom of an OO while making weekly payments on a truck (rather than looking at it as an asset your leasing to generate revenue)  I can't think of anything specific to say about them.. feel free to ask away."

Trucking,348ot7,lostthepasswordagain,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:16:10 2015 UTC,"Until you get your CDL you won't be paid. You can borrow $200/week up to like $800 (for meals, etc) while you're on the road with an instructor, it will be taken from your paycheck once you're hired on. $25/week until it's paid. No interest or anything.   3-6 weeks maybe? Depends on how things go and how quick you are to learn. It took me a long time to figure out backing and downshifting."
Trucking,348ot7,lostthepasswordagain,2,Wed Apr 29 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"I actually just finished my training at prime.  I'm sitting in the hotel (that they own) as I type this.  I will be getting my truck either tomorrow or the day after.  Overall I am happy with my choice, though I don't really have anything to compare it too.  In my research of this and other companies, I liked they way their training program is set up.  Luckily for me I hooked up with a great trainer.  I have heard some horror stories from other people who weren't so lucky for many different reasons.  98% of what you need to know will be learned from a trainer, and most of your time will be spent with this individual for the next 3ish months, so if you go with Prime, do your best to vet any trainers carefully.  Honestly the recruiter is probably the last person you want to trust, they want to get you in and are not always as informed as you'd hope they'd be.  I think they try to be honest, but don't always know what they're talking about.   I'm willing to answer any questions I can, and there's a pretty large community of prime drivers on the truckersreport.com forums. There are subforums for good companies and bad companies, and prime entries under both.  Keep in mind a lot of the guys that post in the bad companies sub are guys that couldn't make a lease work, but you do not have to go lease and the company doesn't encourage or discourage new hires from going lease (though other drivers may)"
Trucking,348ot7,lostthepasswordagain,2,Wed Apr 29 06:07:21 2015 UTC,"So I haven't talked with my recruiter again yet, but I checked my email and they are asking for my W-2's going all the way back to 2012.

Trucking,348ot7,lostthepasswordagain,3,Wed Apr 29 14:07:29 2015 UTC,They need proof that you were working/in school/verifibly unemployed in the last 10 yrs for DOT/dept homeland security.  They want to be sure you weren't oversees learning how to wage jihad in a training camp somewhere.

Trucking,348ot7,Virel_360,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"Probably 4-6 weeks, they cover housing and meals the first 5 days during orientation, and will advance you $200 a week for up to 4 weeks afterwards (which they technically don't want you sending home, but it can be done through alternative means if absolutely necessary)  this advance  will be repaid interest free at a rate of $25 a week.  Once you get your cdl and move into the tnt portion of training they guarantee $700 a week gross (b4 tax)  In order to get the guarantee you need to be available for dispatch, so if you manage to arrange home time during this they won't pay for the days you're home."
Trucking,348ot7,redditorwhoknocks,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:04:08 2015 UTC,"The tnt portion will be probably another 6-8 weeks depending on how hard you run.

Trucking,347qx5,Ozdriver,3,Tue Apr 28 23:44:25 2015 UTC,Actually my low rider seat allows me to sit lower which is more comfortable for me and still be able to ride with air in the seat for the bumpy roads of America.
Trucking,347qx5,Doubleover,3,Wed Apr 29 11:52:14 2015 UTC,But aren't there some real low seats that are a fashion statement?
Trucking,347qx5,Ozdriver,3,Wed Apr 29 12:25:55 2015 UTC,I don't know. Every time I get a new truck I purchase a low rise seat base and replace the stock base that came with the truck. It allows me to ride at the seat height of the stock base with no air but with air so my back and roids don't get bothered. As far as the shifter I put a 3 inch extension to make it just a bit taller I find it to be more comfortable when shifting. I don't do it because it's cool I do it because it's comfortable. I can drive a truck with a stock height seat and standard height shifter but in my personal truck it's setup to be most comfortable for me. I'm 6 feet tall and can see just fine with no air at all in the low seat in both my western star and kW but I don't find it comfortable. I have been driving this same way almost 20 years now. I may be biased though because my Harley has apes.
Trucking,347qx5,Doubleover,6,Wed Apr 29 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"Everyone is different I guess. Me, I like to sit fairly high and drop my arm to the shifter. I got a few back problems from when I worked in the mines, so for me this is more comfortable. One thing for sure, buying a good air seat pays off.  I've got a HD also, just low rise bars on that."

Trucking,347o58,scm44,3,Wed Apr 29 04:54:41 2015 UTC,Yep.  $27 per hour but I'm already over 40 so I got 1.5 time all day.  And now I'm sitting at home drinking a beer.  Yet we have trucks sitting at the yard and not enough drivers while people are out there making 10 cents a mile.

They not only pay you next to nothing, but you also have to pay tolls out of your pocket?!?!?  You need to quit working for them right now.  Are you even making minimum wage when you break your pay down vs hours worked??  When I was at CDL school, cr England recruiters came through.  They liked saying ""don't expect to make more than $35k your first year in trucking.""  I refused to accept that.  I made $57k my first year at a much better company.   Fuck that place."

If you want to make a career out of teaming and like your partner, move to LA and drive team for old dominion.  You will each make six figures with weekends off.    If you want to stay in southern arizona then your long term team prospects are limited.  Transition to a solo career with someone who will pay you better, even if it's swift/prime/schneider.

Not a vacation day. .52 split sounds like it's in their range and your other info seems reasonable.   They'll take money out of your pay check if they decide you're idling too much, and they don't care if you're idling because they don't have a load for you and you're sitting in Houston in July.   Other than that, I don't recall any other issues. Unless you have a problem with the the company being gay for Jesus."

I tried to talk a friend out of going to them for his first company but he wouldn't listen. He said he would tough it out a year, he barely made it 6 months, had to bail. He used to read me Qualcomm conversations between dispatch & himself, got to where i looked forward to talk to him to hear those conversations, they were hilarious."
Trucking,345nxa,EmptyPocket229,9,Tue Apr 28 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"Most company trucks are governed already from 60-65, some companies let lease operators run up to 70.  If you own operate you can just go to any mechanic and flash your governor. However I'm sure once this law in enacted, because let's face it, it will be one day  weigh stations you pass through will have some new software that lets them check how long it took you to get from the last weigh station to theirs and if it's over 65, I'm sure it'll be a huge fine.  I ride both ends of the spectrum, a motorcycle and a big rig.  And both groups hate one particular group of motorists the most.  It's the average person driving a 4 wheeler. I don't  hear too many complaints about trucks from bikers, and vice versa. It's always about the asshole in that 4 wheeler."
Trucking,345nxa,DaVito98,7,Tue Apr 28 15:35:46 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the same thing. My buddy drives straight truck and I ride (we're both thinking of driving combo soon here). We both complain a lot about cars (cages/4 wheelers), but never about eachother. It's almost as though those of us who need to pay more attention to the road also respect the other drivers on it."

Trucking,345nxa,ThisNerdyGuy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:54:45 2015 UTC,one day weigh stations you pass through will have some new software that lets them check how long it took you to get from the last weigh station to theirs   They can pretty much already do that with the trucks pre pass and they all log the DOT numbers on the trucks that go through the station.
Trucking,345nxa,adventure_dog,8,Tue Apr 28 22:22:02 2015 UTC,There are actually several large lawsuits rolling through the court now to remove all governing mechanism. They want to push for all trucks must be able to maintain state speed limit to use the highways. If your doing 60-65 in a 70-80 youre just a moving hazard.
Trucking,345nxa,Bigdaddydiesell,5,Tue Apr 28 18:52:08 2015 UTC,"God forbid if we mention the old people driving that should not be driving, but if they slow down trucks that is going to solve the problem.

Trucking,345nxa,Ozdriver,3,Tue Apr 28 21:22:05 2015 UTC,"Same in Oz. It's a pain and dangerous if you want to pass a slow one on a 2 lane road. Lucky for me I've got a pre-limited truck, so it's safer do do that."
Trucking,345nxa,eog_prod,6,Tue Apr 28 21:29:53 2015 UTC,"The government doesn't want trucks governed at 65, the ATA does. The ATA lobbies the government and provides huge campaign funds to the reps and senators etcetc that cater to the ATA's whims. It's funny because most of the trucks involved in accidents are already governed at 65 or less. This will wind up causing more truck related accidents guaranteed."
Trucking,345nxa,Onthegokindadude,2,Tue Apr 28 19:01:08 2015 UTC,"Trucks are always seen as a nuisance, the government wont inconvenience the motoring public. Im afraid we'll  start seeing laws passed saying trucks cant be in the left lane at all in many areas."
Trucking,345nxa,Onthegokindadude,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:42:48 2015 UTC,"""Left Lane"" can be any lane to your left. ""Hammer Lane"" is truck lingo for Fast lane or furthest left lane. If you've never heard this term then you haven't been doing this long or you don't talk to drivers much."
Trucking,345nxa,Onthegokindadude,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:23:19 2015 UTC,"Considering the amount of states that don't allow truckers in the furthest left lane, I've never considered left lane being the furthest. So assuming we all think that is an assumption."
Trucking,345nxa,kellanium,0,Tue Apr 28 18:15:58 2015 UTC,"Left lane/hammer lane, same thing, i just say left lane. I havent seen any signs in Ca saying we cant be in left lane on a 2 lane interstate. I have heard that you only have a certain amount of time to be in the left lane passing, i treat Ca the same as any other state"
Trucking,345nxa,kellanium,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:26:36 2015 UTC,It's not marked in a lot of areas but on a 3+ highway if you're caught in the Hammer lane for any amount of time in California they will give you a hefty fine.
Trucking,345nxa,Gooey_Gravy,1 point,Tue Apr 28 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"Yea i know, i was talking about keeping trucks out of the left lane on 2 lanes when the 65 top speed is imposed.

Trucking,345nxa,ThisNerdyGuy,2,Tue Apr 28 18:33:15 2015 UTC,I think Ohio has plans to make almost all of their interstate routes 3 lanes or more so that's a plus.
Trucking,345nxa,Onthegokindadude,2,Tue Apr 28 20:14:48 2015 UTC,I say shut all trucks down for a week see what happens. Never ending battle with the public. We need you but we hate you battle.
Trucking,345nxa,anontrucker,3,Tue Apr 28 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"I've said this before as well!  Any time I hear someone complaining about ""those damn trucks"" I calmly and politely tell them to point at something, anything, that WASN'T brought by truck and I would whole-heartedly apologize for all truckers worldwide.  Needless to say I've yet to apologize.   If this country were forcibly reminded just how important trucks are to our economy...things may change.   Until then...well...that's why I left trucking."
Trucking,345nxa,anontrucker,2,Tue Apr 28 21:29:36 2015 UTC,I would argue a different approach.  Have all trucks drive the minimum speed limit for a week and watch the roads clog.   Trying to get all trucks to shut down for a week just hurts our pocketbook and would eventually force us back out there anyways.

Trucking,345nxa,spotries,1 point,Wed Apr 29 00:34:15 2015 UTC,"I've always wanted to attend a hearing where they're considering these types of regulations and ask for a show of hands for the regulators as to who has a CDL and how long they were on the road.  I'm wouldn't be surprised if none of them did.    You don't see this type of thing in other industries, i.e., the medical field wouldn't have regulations that weren't decided by doctors or real estate regulations not decided by realtors."
Trucking,346742,mega_donkey,3,Tue Apr 28 16:54:00 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong about the downturn in oilfield. I live in Australia, and there is a huge downturn here, with half the onshore rigs racked and stacked. Some of the supply companies have gone broke, and they were well run as well.  As for O/O, I know there is a difference in our countries but the principles are the same. I've been an O/O for close to 35 yrs, and in my experience you need a base where you can maintain and service the truck, because getting other people to do it costs a fortune, especially for major jobs. But I guess that wouldn't be practical in your case, and from what I've seen operating as O/O is different on your side with leasing etc.  Best of luck anyway, I've been company and O/O and I know which I prefer, but each to their own."
Trucking,346742,Ozdriver,3,Tue Apr 28 21:19:38 2015 UTC,I'm with you there I've thought about o/o but when it comes to mechanical stuff I'm an idiot so it would never work for me.   All id say is make sure that you can work in your rig and get everything they tell you in writing. If you have those two things and the money is better go for it.
Trucking,346742,truckerdust,3,Tue Apr 28 21:59:09 2015 UTC,"You've got to have mechanical ability and book keeping knowledge to run your own truck. Without it you may as well forget it. Like I said, you really need your own workshop to work out of.  Best thing about O/O with your own work is you can go where you want, when you want, and if you don't like what's on offer you tell them to stick it. I like the idea of setting up the truck and trailers exactly how you like it."
Trucking,346742,Ozdriver,2,Tue Apr 28 22:51:12 2015 UTC,How much do you have to put down? What kind of truck are you looking at?
Trucking,346742,TheGr8Carloso,1 point,Tue Apr 28 23:26:40 2015 UTC,That's the hard part right now. I know most places are going to be asking for 15% down. I have 4000 saved so not much. I'm on the market for a decent truck from 2000-2007 pre-emissions with inframes as recent as 250k miles.
Trucking,346742,dfo13,5,Wed Apr 29 00:35:36 2015 UTC,"You have 4000 to put down on a truck or 4000 saved up total?  Regardless of what you put down on the truck, you'll want at LEAST 5-10k set aside just to cover repairs.  I started out with around 7k in cash and you won't believe how fast you'll pour that back into a used truck.  Yeah, I know your company said they would help out with repairs, etc., but at the end of the day it's you're truck, you're responsibility and do you really want to let the company be keeping you a breakdown away from going under if they say ""no"" when something big goes?  You can still find nice older trucks but you will pay a premium for them because most of the ones that are still in good shape are owned by those that know what they are worth these days.    You could always try your credit union.  That's what I did.  My credit union doesn't even do business loans, so I took out a personal loan to purchase my truck.  Interest rate is a little higher with the personal loan but hell it's still much better than what I'd do as a first-time buyer going through dealership financing.  Just make sure you're financially ready to jump into owning a truck.  I bought my truck in October of 2014 and put it on the road at the end of last year.  A quick look at my Quickbooks shows I've put around 7k so far into the truck.  All that little stuff, from brakes, to exhaust, to wheel seals, tires, lights, every little nitpicky thing that goes wrong with a 10 year old truck adds up like crazy.  Don't get me wrong.  I love it.  I'm proud of my truck, love my job and love the freedom that comes with it.  Just make sure you plan it all out, and have a backup plan if things go south.  I didn't start out with 30k saved up, so if my engine blows up tomorrow, unless I want to sell off some of my other vehicles, I'd probably park the truck for a bit.  My payment is stupid low with the loan from the credit union and I could easily let the thing sit and go back to driving company for a bit if I had to.  The situation that you don't want to end up in is having a massive truck payment, a truck you can't afford to fix, and no plan b!"
Trucking,346742,Ozdriver,2,Wed Apr 29 02:36:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you want around $10k behind you when you start up, or at least the ability to borrow it. I always say what kills you for the first few years (not literally!) is an engine blow up or rollover.  The first year I had my first truck, KW with 8V92, I had the engine throw a rod, then the trans broke, and a few months later (1981) ran off the road. That nearly broke me. But after all that, it's been plain sailing. Certainly learned from it."
Trucking,346742,Ozdriver,1 point,Wed Apr 29 08:07:55 2015 UTC,"I figure during startup, I'll get the truck and keep hard at it as a company driver until I can get some decent funds to back me up to get started."
Trucking,345mzg,syruptishus,3,Tue Apr 28 14:23:47 2015 UTC,"Ask all the questions of him that you asked us. Trust your gut. If he's paying you a percentage (a good way to pay), then he may be expecting you to take care of the truck entirely. Ask. Anything you don't like, bail."
Trucking,345mzg,bassnote1,2,Tue Apr 28 15:03:44 2015 UTC,"I know you wont like this but the sooner you're solo isn't going to be better. That's the mentality of the major carriers and cdl mills and it's why there are so many undereducated, reckless drivers out there. Put in the seat time with a GOOD trainer (not someone who cuts corners). There are a ton of things out there on the road that you're just not prepared for being fresh out of school. The more seat time with someone who is going to take care of you, the better off you'll be in the future.   As far as your situation is concerned... the leasing is where i'm turned off. If you sign a contract to lease the truck and you have no work or very slow work like you had mentioned hauling pipe or lumber, guess who is stuck paying the bills regardless? All in all, I'd look at getting on with a good carrier as a company driver that is going to put in the time to train you properly, get you familiar with the obstacles of otr trucking and move into specialized hauling at a later date. Company drivers have very little at risk. You get the miles, you get the pay and don't have to worry about much more from a financial standpoint."
Trucking,345mzg,mega_donkey,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:23:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I agree with you, re: training. Thanks. Although I passed the CDL test, I need more work on things like backing, especially with several months out of the saddle. It was all sounding great until he started subtly emphasizing the lease, framed as a sort of ""duh, this is the only way it can work"" thing..."
Trucking,345mzg,ChuckinTucson,2,Wed Apr 29 15:15:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the help guys. The owner of the outfit got back to me with the following points:    I would be paid under a 1099. I would not be responsible for any fueling or maintenance. [Fuel Card & He handles maintenance requests] We will decide on a set monthly income, until we decide otherwise based on my performance. First two months will be a trial to determine if we work as a team and if we will continue working together.   This re-bolsters my interest, but I'm still confused about why it's a lease. Strictly so he can pay me 1099? I guess in this case I would just want to watch out for:   Making sure all of the above is present in the lease contract. A lease that's overly long or difficult to walk away from. Paying my taxes correctly."
Trucking,345mzg,sledge07,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"Thats a tough one, sounds like a very good opportunity starting out with training in specialized areas but the lease part would scare me. I'd at the very least would have to know the terms before i got too far involved and make a special effort to talk to current drivers working for him."
Trucking,345mzg,Hard_at_it,2,Tue Apr 28 14:48:39 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  The terms of the lease are what is important.  It sounds like you'll be an independent contractor vs. an employee, so getting an accountant that knows the trucking industry is essential.  It also sounds like he's paying you a percentage of the load vs. miles.  If the lease of the truck is also based on a percentage of the load this could be a good deal.    The company I work for has three ways of getting paid.  You can be an employee and make $0.53 a mile.  The company provides the truck, fuel and all maintenance.  You can be a lease operator (sounds like this is what you're potentially getting into).  Lease operators make 53.5% of the line haul, plus 100% of the fuel surcharge and pay 12% of the revenue as a lease.  The lease operator pays for fuel, but all repairs, maintenance, tires, etc., are paid by the company.  The third is owner/operators.  They own their own trucks and are paid the same as lease operators, minus (of course) the 12% lease fee."
Trucking,345mzg,adventure_dog,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:00:42 2015 UTC,Ask to see all details of the lease. Percentage should not fluctuate and if you are buying fuel make sure ALL fuel surcharge comes to you.
Trucking,345mzg,Hard_at_it,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"Being a lease offer changes that from a starting job offer to a starting a business offer. Understand the differences and how they may harm or benefit you.  Becoming a lease operator shift a burden of responsibility from the carrier to you. The truck and business get paid before you do, if the truck in the shop, in an accident, or waiting on a load you are not earning but the bills are still piling up.  I believe the running statistic show 95 percent failure rate of first year lease owners."
Trucking,345mzg,adventure_dog,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:48:21 2015 UTC,"So you have no driving experience and you're being offered a great sounding job that requires you to lease the truck? Leasing the truck with no driving experience should be the turn off, that can easily get a new driver into more trouble that they're willing to handle."
Trucking,345mzg,adventure_dog,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:28:16 2015 UTC,"99.9% of the time I would agree with everything you just said but its remotely possible the OP stumbled upon something good. Either the owner is trying to take advantage of him because he doesn't know the industry yet or the OP made a very good first impression & the owner wants to take him under his wing, long shot I know but possible. Going to require a lot of thought on his part. Talking to drivers & he should get the terms to post here for more experienced drivers in this field to take a stab at."
Trucking,345mzg,BarkingLeopard,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:53:37 2015 UTC,Even such a great offer maybe the OP's boss will let him start out for the first 6 months to 1 year as a company driver. Let him get his feet wet and used to the way of the industry before the financial commitments of a lease ownership.  If he's looking to fill his seats with new recruits Straight outta CDL school. What's the catch?
Trucking,345mzg,dfo13,1 point,Wed Apr 29 01:01:07 2015 UTC,"It sounds like he did find a great opportunity, but op got his license several months ago and has had no drive time beyond the schooling. The owner is going to drive with him for 2 weeks before letting him out on his own. That's just not enough experience for anyone to be jumping into a lease.  If he was going to be a regular company driver I'd be saying yeah go for it. But this may be something that's needed to come back to after getting some road time.  It's also op's decision and they're the one that has the better feel of the situation."
Trucking,345mzg,TruMoos,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:30:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks much guys -- I am emailing now with a request to see concrete lease details outlined.

Trucking,345mod,Ugbee,3,Tue Apr 28 14:21:20 2015 UTC,"Used CMV's have been exported from this country to all over the world for a long time now, Asia, Central and S. America, Africa...everywhere. The increasing economic activity in third world nations has created demand for transport.  I've seen pics of some cabovers from the last company I worked for being used at the Chernobyl cleanup attempt and abandoned in place after being contaminated, and at a Chilean copper mine.    They get used the same way any tractor gets used in this country, moving freight, hauling commodities, construction."
Trucking,345mod,13speed,2,Tue Apr 28 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I've seen old Schneider and England trucks in Guatemala being used as regular old trucks hauling whatever needs hauling. I've also seen old Midland and Erb trucks (large canadian companies) in Cuba. There's little chance freight hauling companies could afford to buy new trucks so buying used at auctions then shipping overseas is a good option as used trucks sell for next to nothing at auction."
Trucking,345mod,buhrzzy,2,Tue Apr 28 18:13:24 2015 UTC,I always wondered where all those used trucks went. Schneider keeps them for like 3 or 4 years and then sells them. That puts like 3000 used trucks on the market every year. We are not the largest fleet and I assume the other major and medium size companies do the same. That would be a hell of a lot of used tractors on the market and I didn't understand how that was sustainable. But I didn't consider emerging foreign markets. That would definitely keep up with the flow.
Trucking,345mod,Bparrett77,2,Tue Apr 28 19:04:13 2015 UTC,A foreign company could buy say 10 at a time. They use 3 or 4 and save the rest for parts.

Trucking,345mod,rocknrollskwurl,3,Wed Apr 29 01:40:13 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Japan and some Asian countries have very strict vehicle age and pollution requirements, so many of their minibuses and small trucks and such get exported used to places like Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru.  If the labor cost of diesel mechanics in a country is much cheaper relative to the price of a new vehicle, it might make a lot of sense to import used (even run down) vehicles for cheap and just hire a few extra mechanics and plan for the extra time in the shop.  Plus, a lot of those countries don't care much about emissions, noise, etc, so anything valuable in those parts can be sold for scrap or parts right off the bat."

After riding the pickup's bumper and flashing his lights for about a minute, the Camaro driver then attempts to pass on the shoulder, which ends in disaster. The Camaro loses control in the gravel and hits the pickup, which then hits the 18-wheeler. All three vehicles left the roadway and came to a stop; Linton says there were no injuries.  New York State Police later said the Camaro's driver, 32-year-old Kiran Thapa, was arrested and charged with Aggravated Driving While Intoxicated and Aggravated Unlicensed Operation Motor Vehicle.""

Trucking,33xc4r,Mrwheeler23,10,Sun Apr 26 15:20:42 2015 UTC,"Congrats on making a big life changing step. And welcome to the family. :) While you're out on the road keep in mind that the longer you stay in Trucking the easier it gets. Also, the longer you stay, the more experience you have which means getting with companies that pay better.  For instance I'm with Combined Transport and I'm making .52cpm and I only have 2.5 years of flatbed experience.   Advice:  Buy camping gear for cooking and use it for as much of your cooking as you can.  You'll eat healthier and you'll save a lot of money.  When parking at Truck stops please take others into consideration. Also use your hazard lights when you're actually backing up, not while you're driving around looking for a spot. Another thing, don't honk your air horn when you're getting ready to back up. It's too fuckin loud for the guys that are sleeping. Specially if you're shitty at parking and doing a lot of pull ups. I see way to many schoolies that can't back up and keep doing pull ups and honking every time they put it in reverse. Just your city horn will do.  Save your fueling points. It's better to save them up to buy something awesome for free than to get 20 cents off your soda everyday.  If a driver is passing you on the highway, slow down a tad if they're going really slow passed you so he can quickly get by and the cars behind them can move along."

Thanks, man. I got respect for truckers and I know a few guys who've done it for 20 years plus but as a driver of a car there is nothing more annoying than having to slow down, sometimes dropping 40 km/h, because of a stubborn trucker who's determined to not slow down, especially when there is another truck passing them."

Trucking,33xc4r,sledge07,6,Wed Apr 29 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"Best advice I have to give.  Don't hit anything.  If you're backing up and you are unsure how close you are to an obstacle, get out of your truck and walk around.  All too often, I see drivers smack into things like tractors, trailers, poles, fences, barriers and miscellaneous dunnage and crap in crowded yards.  Take your time in tight spaces and if possible, get another driver to spot you.  Over the years, I've witnessed tons of needless damage caused by drivers that can't back up safely.  Just last Friday, another retard backed into the front of my tractor.  This kind of shit just pisses me off."
Trucking,33xc4r,emersonlakeandlagoon,4,Sun Apr 26 22:08:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Biggest advice from anybody with a brain in this industry. DO NOT DO A GOD DAMN LEASE PURCHASE FUCKING PROGRAM! Now that we have that out of the way. Ask questions, take advice, don't listen to people in truck stops saying ""oh i make three grand a week bring home"" and all of those fuckers in slippers and gym shorts. Make your own stories and enjoy what you do and take pride in what you do, and for the love of god, buy a fucking CB radio, install it in your truck and learn how to use it. Good luck man."
Trucking,33xc4r,vanishing_point,3,Sun Apr 26 20:38:14 2015 UTC,"Salt and pepper.  Electric razor.  Paper towels.  Etc.  Find out if your truck will have a microwave.  If it doesn't, arrange to have one put in.  Good food and good hygiene make a big difference in quality of life.  Keep enough stock of food and water to last a couple days.  You could end up at a closed truck stop, a rest area that's just a parking lot, or a warehouse that is closed while you wait for a morning delivery."
Trucking,33xc4r,Start_button,4,Sun Apr 26 20:14:28 2015 UTC,"Just understand that your first year is all about learning the process, making mistakes and not having a clue what you're talking about. It's kind of a dicey lace to live, especially if you could do your old job with your eyes closed. Then things start to click and fall into place, one by one. I remember being at one place, and the loader drew a picture of the two ways he could load the trailer (steel rolls) and asked me which I preferred. I had to look at him and say that I was so new, I didn't have a clue. He was good with that and loaded the trailer and even told me how many pin holes to slide the tandems to axle the truck properly. I think the things I get most out of trucking are the feeling of empowerment in having a portable skill that I can take anywhere, and the fact that the only reason I'll ever be out of a job is if I don't feel like working."

We are lucky in that we get to move around the world in relative freedom, while a dock worker resides in a totalitarian hellscape where their boss may come in several times an hour to bitch them out about petty infractions of regulations. In smalller companies the receiver tends to know why they need what I am bringing them and be glad to have it.  Layers of bureaucracy and disconnection tend to give people sour outlooks on life, especially for my customers who are connected to the government, especially public schools and universities. They have no idea what the delivery is to be used for and personally they would have been better off if I hadn't showed up period.

Had a friend work for (but didn't train with) schneider. They were ok. He did a two week on one week off gig. Had some awesome trips.

You will have to get your CDL on your own but they hire people straight out of CDL school and put you with a trainer for 8 weeks. They run a LOT of NE Ohio and may hire you (they're from NC). They're not the greatest company in the world but for some one completely new to trucking they're a better option than most.   Also I see a lot of trucks from Logan trucking which is out of Canton OH. I don't know if they train students of not but I've never talked to an unhappy driver for them.
Trucking,33x5r8,Injectingspores,2,Sun Apr 26 16:06:32 2015 UTC,I worked for Cargo straight out of school. They will lie straight to face about home time and how important you are to them. Which I guess is like most other companies in my experience. They are also hyper safety oriented which doesn't sound all that bed until you realize that there is a camera watching you in the cab and not just when you are driving. There were so many safety systems in the cab they were a huge distraction. Just my experience. Moved on to local. Less money but way happier.

He revs up in front of me, flashes his left signal, cuts allllll the way across the interstate to have a confab with another bear. My truck, without so much as a warning beep, SLAMS my brakes on.

OTR you may only walk a couple hundred feet per day. Thats part of the reason there is a greasy trucker stereotype.   The physical is pretty easy. They'll ask if you snore and put a tape measure on your neck. If you're obese they may ask for a sleep study, or depending on different conditions you may have the doctor can issue med cards with shorter time limits between physicals."

Trucking,33ixej,Candygram_for_Mongo,1 point,Thu Apr 23 06:17:20 2015 UTC,There are times (not often) when we have to walk quite a bit at customers. A few customers ive been to make you park in a certain area to checkin and you walk what seems like a ridiculous distance to check in. Usually though you park pretty close to where you check in. These truck stops do have handicapped spots (doesn't sound like your actually handicapped) that you might be able to take advantage of

There are a thousand variables that have to go just right for us not to be late.  Anything from, like you said, accidents and flats to some dick taking a shower while his truck is parked in a fuel lane when we're needing to fill up to that random traffic jam that appears out of nowhere.  The windows are usually there to ensure that those variables can be, at least minimally, accounted for."

It could be that they get hung up at another delivery or get out of the DC later than usual but they still stop and have a break because they have that window. Sometimes, especially at 3 am you just want to close your eyes for 20 minutes or so and it's best not to do this while driving."

They don't know the traffic on the route, where the exact location of the stores or how to get into the locations, they know how to back up a truck but they don't know the best way to do it at a new place so that they're efficient.

Trucking,33i7db,Nigelpennyworth,2,Thu Apr 23 04:52:18 2015 UTC,"Do you know if you're the first stop for the truck?  If their boss (or dispatcher) knows that you need it early, they should put it in special instructions for the driver.  How else is the FNG supposed to know that you need it at 3am? The seasoned guys might know they have to high-tail to your store and they can take a breather after that, while the FNG might get his paperwork in line at the DC before he starts his first day on the route. Could also be that they are not familiar with the area roads to your location. Sometimes a friendly talk will help. Whatever you do, dont be a jerk about it. We get it about getting stuff done early, but we are not mind readers.  On the other side of the coin, it is the most annoying thing to show up to first stop and nobody is there. Sometimes they'll show up just a bit late to make sure someone is there waiting.   Source: Used to have a local dedicated route"

Trucking,33hr07,FunkyNedAvenger,4,Wed Apr 22 16:53:31 2015 UTC,Go get your permit and the hardest part of the test is going to be the vehicle inspection part. If you've ever driven a large u haul that's pretty much what a class b truck is. The companies that want you to get a class b in so much time do provide the vehicle to test with if you're employed with them.  Or if you know someone with a large pick up truck like an f 250 and can get a hold of a trailer you can test with that as long as everything can pass a dot inspection.

Trucking,33ea57,BiWinning85,5,Tue Apr 21 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"Here is an example, of a multi truck push/pull combination.  I have seen 1 lead truck, and 2 push trucks before.  Where the push trucks were side by side, attached via a ""yoke"" they both push on, that then connects to the load in 1 point.  Kind of like walking suspension on trailers.  These vehicles are extremely heavily specced, with manual transmissions..  The drivers listen to the ""Push"".  The boss.  He listens to the pilots and is usually in 1 of the pilot vehicles.  Loads, that start getting into 18' wide + and 150,000 lbs and more usually dont move too fast though.  I have never been in heavy haul like this, but I did do multi truck co-ordinated winch pulls with ""Bed Trucks"" and they are the same way.  Edit:  Ill add in this picture of a Self Propelled Modular Transporter  They have their own electric power.  The ability to raise and lower ""Tag Axles"" to save tire wear.

I worked on the rig trucks before :)  With them its more of who goes when.  And with the mutli winch pull, who should clutch less/RPM more.  It all works the same way though.  A driver gets good, knows his shit, gets up to push, and runs the show.  It gets pretty complicated with this super haul shit, because they need mathematicians to calculate load stability, weight distribution requirements, etc.  Its not just 1 push being the boss.  He has educated bosses above him.  Edit:  I have been in these before"

Just as the title says. Just finished my first day of training at the Carlisle, PA OC. It was a very long 630am-630pm day of tedious paperwork, paperwork, some simulation driving, lunch, and paperwork.   Expect long days. Our shortest day was 10 hours throughout the whole thing.    So far every one of the trainers is incredible. What a great group of guys that seems to be all buddies with each other, so that instantly makes them like their job more than the next guy. Extremely helpful, sarcastic and friendly.   Same thing at the Dallas OC. The guy that taught the second half was kinda annoying, but he was bearable.    Did I mention we have homework? shrugs    Is it the shift point chart thing? If so, do not forget that shit. It made my life so easy when I was starting out. Learn it, live it, love it.    I'm excited for day two tomorrow, if anyone's considering Schneider or starting soon I can fill you guys in on some of what goes on as I go on.    If you've got any questions for me, AMA.    But I have one question for anyone that has completed training, why do SO many people go home or get sent home? 50-60% of the previous classes went home (16/24 and 10/20).    My class started with about 25 and only 15 finished. Most of them just don't make the cut. This ain't Swift, ya know...    Also how hard is the final test and slow maneuvering?    The way they did it at the Dallas OC wasn't like a final test thing. They just took you out driving and coached you as necessary throughout the week. They grade you appropriately along the way. With the slow maneuvers, use absolutely every bit of space they give you because you're going to need it. As long as you're coachable and don't hit anything, you've got nothing to worry about!"

Trucking,33fhnd,ameashi,3,Thu Apr 23 02:48:11 2015 UTC,"I also went to Carlisle, PA for training.  The trainers (most of them) are pretty laid back and will work with you.    Make sure you're at the top of your game this week.  Week 1 you'll be seeing plenty of people not make the cut.  The 1-2 hour daily drive on the local roads (where you log your miles) will be assessed quite heavily.  If you are lacking in certain driving skills, they will let you know and you better make sure you show improvement the next time.  If the trainer they put you with on your drive today doesn't fit your learning style, LET THEM KNOW.  Mike, the guy in charge is willing to accommodate you  and make the switch.  My first trainer talked too much while driving and they were able to switch me to a quieter trainer.  The class that was a week before mine started out with 25.  By week 1 end there were 11.  Then week 3 only 3-4 were taking the final test.    I really liked Schneider's training, I learned a lot in such a short time. Unfortunately for me I got rusty because I didn't find a job ASAP when I got my class A in Feb.  The guys in my class were a great bunch, they were pretty bummed I didn't make the cut.  I still reach out to a few of them.    Mike recommended to me that I try to find a company that offers training where I'll be with a trainer for a few weeks."

Also quite a few people begin training and realize it just isnt for them. If they would just get through the training and get in their own assigned truck for a few weeks they might find it better. I have no idea if those are the reasons people are leaving   but thats what it sounds like."
Trucking,33fhnd,mediajunkie88,2,Wed Apr 22 15:01:07 2015 UTC,The final test will be a route you've already driven. They may throw some changes into it but if you make it to the final test then you'll be fine. You just have to double your score from the first test. You still have another test after three months on your own. It'll be the same as the first two. The SloMo test won't happen until you actually get your truck. Just do the whole thing in first gear and take all the room they give you. Easy. Make sure your TE gives you lots of backing practice and mountain driving.

It's spring thaw, so there's no overages allowed until jun I believe in Alberta at least. I can't remember else once spring thaw is done . What are you pulling? Also depends on your spread. Can do 43,500# on trip axle with 10ft spread, and 34,000 on tandem, non split.

I would also make sure your cat is microchipped, and get it used to wearing a collar/harness, so that you can potentially leave her in the truck without locking her in a kennel.  Never trucked with a cat, but have moved a few times with them. On the last move, the vet gave me a Rx for a small dose of Xanax for the cat... Thankfully I didn't need to use it, as giving cats pills is not easy, but something to consider as an emergency option."

Upset the tech, my cat and me. Fuck that. We aren't doing the cage, anymore.   She doesn't like moving vehicles. If she can sit with us and get air, she's fine. She hates motel rooms, or moving. She finds a bed and burrows under the covers.  I went on a trip with my daughter who said my cat is neurotic. She asked, ""Has Coco ever been away from you?"" Nope. That cat has been with me, 24/7 since I got her as a kitten. She's about to turn 3. I left the cat with my husband, in March.   Why would I dose my cat, to take her on the truck?

Trucking,33c8mm,GuyInAChair,4,Tue Apr 21 21:06:59 2015 UTC,"I'm echoing some of the other replies but here's what I like from a good guard.   Have a map! Seriously, even if you can see everything from the shack, or you work at a rectangle shaped building a map is really handy.    If nothing else, consider that not everyone in this industry speaks decent English, a picture is so much easier to understand. Or even something simple like knowing where dock 38 is in a big rectangle so I don't overshoot it.   Know what's going to be required. You could say, go over there and talk to reception. But... reception is going to need me to pull onto a scale which I just made 20 times harder because I parked my truck in a bad position because I didn't know that. Know where scales, and truck stops are. We don't, or are probably very unfamiliar with them. Don't be afraid to ask drivers how they are. Tell them, lots of guys hate the Flying J on exit 6 but they have a scale, a little further there's a Loves and everyone seems to like it. Have some sort of plan if and when the load gets screwed up. Lots of time our load info is 4th hand, through your company, to a broker, to another company, through a couple people at our office then to us. Show them on the map, go park here and get on the phone, or turn around here and (related to the previous suggestion) go to this parking area and make some phone calls. Be professional, and don't assign blame. Problems happen, and it's not always your fault, and not always my fault. I've had guards make me sit in ""detention"" because a load was late. I've had guards ask me to park off to the side. ""Guess something got messed up here, my paper work says this was supposed to be here yesterday, park over there and I'll help you figure this out"" Same situation, but both of us probably left in much better moods in the second interaction."

Trucking,33aca9,BiWinning85,2,Tue Apr 21 03:11:12 2015 UTC,"I met these guys at the bar and i guess they said some guy 20 years ago used to go to truck stops   This can be a problem.  Unless you haul your own water on a trailer and pull from a standing water source (better for your pressure washers pump btw).  As well, that dirt and road grime has to go somewhere.  If you are busy/successful enough you may cause them to have back up drains/pipes.  Plus just being on the site is a liability for them.  Its a great idea but there are a bunch of legal things in the way."
Trucking,33aca9,That-one-guy12,2,Tue Apr 21 01:55:17 2015 UTC,thats what im trying to figure out all the legal red tape. should i look up the local laws? what would it be under sewage drainage or something like that?  i got 575 gallon water tank so i do have my own water. I got the rig set up good i just want to find work. its 3500 psi 5.5 gpm hot water
Trucking,33aca9,bassnote1,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:24:42 2015 UTC,"Wow, sounds like a nice rig.  Best ive used was 3.5GPM @ 2500-3000  The problem with this crap is some is local, some is federal.  You have to know where and what to look up.  But the very short of it, is I will almost guarantee any city that has anyone competent running it, will not allow this to happen on a public roadway.  Where I am, you would have to declare your business type, what your equipment is, where you plan to work and operate, and a city street/drain will not do.  (For trucking, you have to show them, you arent parking it on a road or in your neighborhood).  Drainage really is the hard part.  Take a look around in your area.  Ill bet you can find mobile pressure washers, but you either have to have the site to wash on or they have a shop.  This is why they will charge 75$/hr and need 400-800 billable hours (multiple trucks) to stay in business.  If you have the gift of gab, and talked up the owner/manager, you may be able to strike a deal.  I would go this way  ""Having my pressure washer service on site, and comparable to drivers washing their trucks themselves, will draw trucks to your fuel stop.  I have (and prove with paperwork) general liability insurance of 100,000$ and would be willing to sign indemnification paperwork on accident liability only in the event their staff cause an collision/accident with your equipment (you wouldnt be covered.  Reducing their liability).  Leave an ""ace up your sleeve""  If they have to say no (and wait till they say no), offer to wash the pumps once a week and the store once a year?  Right after winter.  If they still wont play ball, tell them it will work against them, if you do this for the competitor, and they are on the  ""no wash on site"" side of the fence.  In the US, there is Loves, Flying J, Pilot, etc."

Before you strike out on this venture I would suggest you wash a few trucks first to see what kind of labor you are up against.    I washed a few trucks for Roma back when they were just a little bitty thing in Dallas in the late 80's. 20 trucks every Saturday, 4 guys with 2 rigs with 2 units on each rig both with hot water and 2 1000 gallon tanks at 4500 psi still took all day. We were eventually driven out if business by the EPA  for washing soap and truck dirt down storm drains even though the soap was designed for it. Many different factors to consider, the biggest one being available water source."

Trucking,33aca9,sledge07,2,Tue Apr 21 14:54:09 2015 UTC,Blue Beacon charges a little over $40 to wash the truck minus the trailer. Pricing wise they are the ones to beat.
Trucking,33aca9,bassnote1,3,Tue Apr 21 00:42:18 2015 UTC,"I also feel like you would have to look at polishes and stuff that can go in with your wash. I've been through a few $30 washes that are a ""truck wash and lube"" place and after the truck dries, there's water spots everywhere, or the same place missed my mirrors and both my door windows. My windshield was not scrubbed enough and still had bugs on it. I feel like blue beacon always gets the job done and I don't usually end up with water spots. So if your quick and cheap to get the basic stuff off, or making it shiny, you'd have to appeal to both and hope you do a good job. If they guarantee a clean and they miss a spot, I ask them to fix it, and I don't go back. I don't have an hour to have to make sure it's clean."

No specific preference. I'd like to start off dry van with 98%+ drop and hook to get experience and used to what I'm doing. From there I may do tanker or flatbed.   Search here in this subreddit about companies that are good to work for. You can look for companies with terminals in your area or for one in another state (assuming you're in the states). Look for a trucking company that isn't the typical starter company (Swift, Werner, etc.) There are plenty!"

Trucking,3371xe,probable_alcoholic,4,Tue Apr 21 03:14:42 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion but I would buy a truck with a very small sleeper for basically two reasons:   They are going to be cheaper than both a daycab or a big sleeper truck. Small sleepers aren't desirable to most companies so you should be able to find one at a reasonable price.  It's nice to have a bed in case you absolutely need it. I run local but have a full sleeper. I've stayed in it 4 nights in the 2 months I've worked here. It's nice to have the option if something happens and you get stuck out or you need to do an overnight load as a favor or you get a little downtime and want a quick nap. A small sleeper won't effect the turning radius much and just a little bit longer wheelbase will improve the ride and comfort for your driver.    If it were me I'd be looking at a Mack but I like Mack trucks. Yes they are owned by Volvo but they still have a good reputation as tough trucks and they are generally cheaper than other ""good"" trucks (Pete/KW) for the quality you get.   Good luck. Let us know what you go with."

Trucking,3371xe,probable_alcoholic,3,Mon Apr 20 23:10:05 2015 UTC,"The issue with the Maxxforce is that it's simply a cat c15 with a common unified fuel rail head. The c15 (ACERT) was so bad, it forced cat out of the class 8 engine manufacturing business for a few years. The main issues with both engines, since they're basically identical, is that they enjoy eating egr valves, coolers and even the casings. Since those ACERT recirculating units run so hot they were cracking heads and destroying injectors left right and center.  There are currently several class action lawsuits against both navistar and cat regarding those monsterous pieces of shit.  Sprinkle in the hugely advanced maintenance cost and average $21,000+ Inframe overhaul costs and you have a recipie designed to put a small owner op into the poor house."

They might look like junk but I know of several hundred pre emission columbias that will be twice as profitable twice as long many brand new trucks.  They're nothing to turn your nose up at. They might be ugly, but money is prettier to me.  And btw the 14 liter dd60 can be modified in two ways: the egr can be nullified safely via a barometric adapter that makes the engine think it's operating above 6,000 feet and this causes the ECM to close the egr, and when the kit is installed properly the valve will stay shut. Removal of the dpf system is a more complex modification but can be done via altered ECM and of course; removal from the truck.  Edit-words"

I've seen halliburton trucks go to auction after a few years with less than 100k miles on them. These trucks may haul a trailer 10-100 miles and then sit for a couple weeks. Some may be a little beat up but you can find some really good ones too. Right now is a good time to find them. With oil prices down everything is slow and these companies are getting equipment off the books.

However many of these trucks have been ran into the ground on their idle hours. The chassis are usually leaving a lot to be desired and on an emissions standard engine, you can for sure kiss the DPF good bye. There's no salvaging it. It's out of warranty. Just yank it out, don't clean it and save yourself the heartbreak. Also inframe will doubtlessly be warranted shortly after purchase (>6 mo.)"

Trucking,3374sl,vanishing_point,4,Mon Apr 20 03:58:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to spend.  The Colemans and Igloos they sell at truck stops are between 109 and 125 but have no freezer. The motors usually start making noise about a month out. On the other hand the Domestic brands get really cold, have freezers usually and are designed to fit upright into those recesses. You're looking at around 500 for those new and they are less readily available. As someone who has used the Igloos and Colemans for 10 years and just recently got a truck with a Domestic fridge already in it, the extra 350 is definitely worth it. I can keep tv dinners and frozen pizza and ice cream. The temp inside stays consistent regardless of the ambient temp inside the truck. Bottled water and soda gets cold in minutes instead of hours. There is also less overall power consumption and a thermostatic control device. I have seen them used at some places for around 350. The last one I saw was at the Iowa80."

Trucking,3376yw,ohmygodbees,3,Mon Apr 20 10:16:53 2015 UTC,"It can be done. I've been doing it for about 4 years now. I've stayed local the entire time, but the first 7 months I worked full time and didn't go to school. I had a job change at that point, and my new job knew that school was my priority (in fact, I'm interning at their corporate office this summer), so they work with me on flexible hours. There was also a point where I was transferring schools so I worked full time for a while, and was able to prove my worth. I think that this helped a lot in my company working with me.  I'd advise you to avoid otr if you want to do school, that is more of a lifestyle than a job. You're also going to probably need to put in some time not going to school, to really focus on proving yourself to the employer. Another factor I'd look for is a company that has a low turnover rate. Are they interested in helping you grow or do they just want steering wheel holders?   There are a lot of part time jobs, but I think you need some experience for most of them. In my experience full time means an average of 10+ hours a day, with no idea what time you're off. Your school will suffer in that situation.  I kind of jumped around on topics but if you want more detail on anything feel free to ask."
Trucking,3376yw,BinghamL,2,Mon Apr 20 16:06:03 2015 UTC,"Ah ok, I was assuming you wanted to start a full 4+ years in school. If you only have 2 classes left just do them then get a job.   It might be worth while to look for a company that will let you go part time or take a hiatus for fall quarter, but you'll be limiting yourself.  Maybe you could find some seasonal job that is busy during summer. Something serving cruise ships, fishing industry, farms, construction? Then when that's over just knock out your quarter of school then get whatever job you want.  You could find a part time job, I just don't see very many of them that would accept a new driver. It's possible, just not likely.  7 on 7 off would be nice. The only concerns I would have are first of all, what school has classes that meet every other week? Also, I would be nervous about them running you too far out, or you get stuck at a shipper/receiver and are late getting back, therefore missing class.   If it were me, I would look for a seasonal job for the summer, then take the fall quarter off for school, then find a job I will like doing for a long time. It doesn't make sense to take a job that you likely need to sacrifice some stuff for (type of work, inconvenient hours, etc) to work with your school for only one quarter. It's like buying a house a month before your budget is doubled. You'll have so many more options if you finish the school up first.   If at all possible you should take those classes summer quarter, then you'll be free sooner.   Anyway, that's just my perspective on it. I think as long as you end up finishing school and get a job you like, then you did it right."

They are 100% living on an outdated legacy, a  legacy that died with the 379 being discontinued. Cascadias are solid with great sleepers and known for having low operation cost. Add in that masterpeice engine and its a no brainer in my book, Freightliner all day.

Most of the trucks that are gonna have diff locks are going to be used in places where they will be on uneven or unpaved roads, ie oilfield, construction.   Locking diff's are used a lot on 4x4 vehicles to gain traction on that axle without needing to engage the front axle.   Here are few links that explain locking diff's. Unless I completely misunderstood your question, these should take care of it.  http://www.offroaders.com/tech/locking-differential.htm  http://www.classadrivers.com/forum/new-truck-drivers-get-help-here/26042-locking-your-differential.html"

I know the inter axle, gets the power to both.. What I was more asking was if its better to have them where 1 of the two drive axles are locked, or to have them both at the same time. Those threads kinda answered my question. The freight I haul can go to oil fields, forestry roads, and mines, so when it gets slippery I lock 'em up and I know I get better grip when I'm loaded. Specifically I was asking is it better to have control over only locking the front axle and having the rear free, or vise-a-versa, or is it better to just lock all 4 with 1 switch. Like let's say you normally go from paved road to slick oil field road, would you always lock both front and rear axles if you have separate switches for each axle, or would you only lock one axle and let one of them be open."

Trucking,332tjf,AkTrucker,2,Sun Apr 19 03:04:59 2015 UTC,"You basically get your authority through FMCSA for $300.00.  Secure a processing agent (I believe that is what it is called.  A third party responsible for receiving information on your behalf and being your official contact).  Usually cost is $30.00.   There are a ton of companies who will try to charge you to do these two things for tou but it is too simple to pay for someone else to do.  As soon as you send your 300.00 you will have dot numbers and operating authority.   Once you do this you have 60 days to secure 750000 liability and 100000 cargo commercial insurance.   The insurance company will file an Mcs-91 with FMCSA and your authority is active and you are legal to obtain loads.   Horizon hauls travel trailers out of Indiana as do a lot of other companies in the Elkhart area if you do not want to buy a trailer and haul freight.   You will get your truck dot inspected just like a big truck (fire extinguisher,  flairs,  window tint, etc...)    Or you can obtain loads off of load boards.   Uship is an option as well but not one I use.  I approached industries directly that had product that fit criteria for fragile ltl shipping such as HVAC, sheet metal products (minimal packaging) plastic pipe, coiled wire (light weight but bulky)."

Trucking,331vp3,mega_donkey,7,Sat Apr 18 18:42:42 2015 UTC,Different construction times and standards in different states. The federalization of the US interstate system has attempted to correct these differences but unfortunately a lot of states are hesitant to jump aboard. It blows my mind to think that there are still states that have exit number systems that don't match with their mile markers. It wasn't that long ago that Florida was still like that.
Trucking,331vp3,eog_prod,2,Sat Apr 18 21:10:58 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Federalism.   Explanation: States have the power to set their own transportation regs unless Congress passes a transportation law which preempts the states, or a state regulation directly conflicts with federal actions. In the latter case, it would invoke the U.S. Department of Transportation, or other applicable regulatory body to preempt.   Source: http://www.dot.gov/regulations/federalism  edit: shorter sentence"
Trucking,331vp3,ShellAnswerMan,3,Mon Apr 20 20:45:36 2015 UTC,"Roads are paid for at the state level through the taxes of that states people, they pay for it so they govern what can happen on those roads. There are some federal limits though, especially in the case of interstates, where there must be a certain level of safe standards. Realistically, it would be best for motor vehicle transportation to be regulated federally but states don't like to give up any power; also most states probably would not like the federal method of deciding which streets need to be replaced/repaired.  There are no 'air roadways' or things of the like with air travel and much larger percentage of it is interstate travel with a much more drastic need for logistic regulation between states due to the severity of air vehicle accidents."
