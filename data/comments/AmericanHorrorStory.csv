AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yxm,newm1070,8,Tue Jul 21 17:01:51 2015 UTC,I would be ridiculously excited.
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yxm,captainfukal,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:42 2015 UTC,Or Finn.  >.>
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yxm,ilovetorunforfun,2,Tue Jul 21 18:59:06 2015 UTC,Omg. We can dream.
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yxm,mansonfamily,18,Tue Jul 21 18:18:41 2015 UTC,I'd really just be happy with more Zachary Quinto in fetish gear...
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yxm,milleribsen,2,Tue Jul 21 19:45:14 2015 UTC,I'll be in my bunk
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yxm,refreshments,25,Tue Jul 21 23:53:15 2015 UTC,I'd honestly just be happy if Hotel was an original story that was scary.
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yxm,clwestbr,12,Tue Jul 21 20:32:40 2015 UTC,There is so much to like about this concept.
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yxm,michaelje0,7,Tue Jul 21 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for it, and if they can avoid forced connections to other seasons (which was Murphy's original plan till online chatter convinced him to connect them all) then I think he can focus and make something great."
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yxm,clwestbr,6,Tue Jul 21 21:04:37 2015 UTC,I wonder how many times that person got hate mail.   Or how many times they just got an email with the subject line 'Who Are You?'
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yxm,Starlite85,4,Tue Jul 21 21:39:08 2015 UTC,It was the ghost of Jimmy darling! Lol..that is an interesting theory though that they may tie that into the new season!!
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yl2,HazyVision,2,Tue Jul 21 15:39:40 2015 UTC,I'd love to stay in there
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yl2,steakquesarito,3,Tue Jul 21 20:03:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair this came from a Russian twitter fan account, not from an official source. For all we know this could be some actual hotel being built, we don't know yet if this is a legit picture of the set."
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2yl2,ahsfreakshow,2,Tue Jul 21 20:44:49 2015 UTC,"I don't see why everything has to be fake, but okay. It probably is real. We've seen this sort of tone in the Gaga teaser."

AmericanHorrorStory,3e3nh1,cosmicpizza666,4,Tue Jul 21 18:30:35 2015 UTC,"same, i honestly don't care about anything but Hotel, at least I'll have scream queens to fill my RM void for a bit."
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2be8,donkeykonga44,5,Tue Jul 21 12:23:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly it feels like you can't even really compare the two seasons, they're so different.  Asylum will always be my favorite season of AHS, but I have to admit I didn't totally hate Freakshow."
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2be8,ilovetorunforfun,3,Tue Jul 21 15:01:55 2015 UTC,"Asylum is my favorite season. Freakshow, however, contained my favorite episode."
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2be8,davis98,5,Tue Jul 21 15:20:16 2015 UTC,I accidentally voted for freak show
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2be8,yourcousinviny,2,Tue Jul 21 12:47:33 2015 UTC,Same. Reminds me of Simpsons joke with voting in the presidential election.
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2be8,HmmmNol,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:02 2015 UTC,So that's where Freak Show's votes are coming from.
AmericanHorrorStory,3e2be8,dandoolan,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:40 2015 UTC,Seasons 1-2 : Gold.  Seasons 3-4: Shit.  Season 5: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GO BACK TO YOUR ROOTS AND BE COOL AGAIN PLEEEEEASE.

AmericanHorrorStory,3dz4kr,alymonster,3,Tue Jul 21 10:24:31 2015 UTC,Yes. This is what I want.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,donkeykonga44,13,Mon Jul 20 21:23:24 2015 UTC,"I know the point of this show is to be scary, and Coven utterly failed that, but I can't seem to help but love it because of this strange ""girl power"" vibe. It was super cheesy and yet I find myself watching that season, or parts of it, more than once."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,Laureltess,3,Tue Jul 21 02:53:55 2015 UTC,"Both are good for me, but I liked Coven more because it was kind of 'fun' with all that bitchery..."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,mistar_z,5,Tue Jul 21 10:08:39 2015 UTC,"I'm biased because I love witches, so Coven was my favorite theme. Overall, I felt the characters were more compelling as well. I also felt like there was more direction in Coven with the persisting question of ""Who is the next Supreme?"" whereas for Freakshow it was more ""What is the central plot?"""
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,LoganBerryz,2,Tue Jul 21 04:41:55 2015 UTC,"As usual, I'm going to be one of the few - if not the only one - to say I loved both seasons. But Freak Show, by far. It is my second favorite season behind Asylum."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,israeldmo,5,Tue Jul 21 08:23:00 2015 UTC,"Mother of god anything but freakshow!!!! The only saving grace was Dandy....  I've watched them all over again except for freakshow, I really hated that one...sorry."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,Masterofunlocking1,3,Tue Jul 21 03:35:39 2015 UTC,"Freak show, anything but Coven. The Halloween 3 of the series."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,forevercurmudgeon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:05:43 2015 UTC,"Funny since Halloween 3 is more appreciated now than it was back then. Halloween was intended to be an anthology movie franchise, something they didn't advertise very well to audiences back then.  Halloween 2 was supposed to be the end of Michael and Laurie saga. Season of the Witch was hated  more for not being related to Michael Myers. It's actually not a terrible movie. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if they stuck to their original plan to keep the franchise anthological . I'd rather watch Season of the Witch over Curse of Michael Myers, Resurrection, or those trash remakes."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,mrignatiusjreily,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:25:45 2015 UTC,"Coven wasn't my favourite by far and wasn't scary or creepy in the sense that the other seasons aimed to be.   I could not watch the intro, and the first few episodes with all the torture I absolutely hated but stuck through. I'm really creeped out by the cruelty and helplessness of torture. It almost didn't gel with the whole theme of the season what with all the witches nonsense which was about as scary as an episode of Selina the teenage witch. There were a few really good characters in Coven that were lost on the show sadly.  So for me, it's Freakshow 100%.  It felt a lot like Carinvale, another show I enjoyed and the freaks were all interesting in their own right. Sure Ryan was a bit OTT with some of the characters like Dandy but it felt right rather than forced in for a bit of drama camp."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,Sideburnt,2,Tue Jul 21 11:28:41 2015 UTC,*Sabrina the teenage witch (sorry)  I feel like Coven would've been more interesting if it had focused on the old creole/carinbean voodoo stuff  instead of the drama's of college girls.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,whatYourMomCallsMe,2,Tue Jul 21 11:39:26 2015 UTC,"I am not going to say that these two were the best. But I've always loved witches and it was really interesting to see them portrayed AHS style. And even though I know the point of this show is to terrify you, clowns are a huge fear of mine so - I'm going with Coven."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,distressedsquib,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:50:23 2015 UTC,christ. coven was such a clusterfuck of random ugly random nonsense. and i was the most excited for coven but it was such a let-down. i stopped after 6 episodes. dreadful.  i actually liked most of freakshow. it had some really low-lows but i felt it was way more cohesive than coven.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dzspf,thequeenofsiam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:00 2015 UTC,"Coven is my favorite season. I don't agree with everyone who says the show is meant to be and has been scary in the past. Nothing in that show has ever scared me. The camp factor in all seasons is too blatant for me to let it scare me. I don't mean that I don't like the campiness,  because I love campy stuff. That's why I like Coven the most. I feel like Coven was the only season that really owned how campy the whole series is and didn't pretend it was anything other than a fun show to watch."
AmericanHorrorStory,3e0mzg,Dagargia,7,Tue Jul 21 01:19:59 2015 UTC,C'mon Netflix release!
AmericanHorrorStory,3e0mzg,sunflowerkz,3,Tue Jul 21 04:00:49 2015 UTC,Said it was available on amazon :( I got my hopes up for Prime.
AmericanHorrorStory,3e0mzg,captainfukal,3,Tue Jul 21 01:44:53 2015 UTC,"AHS, Downton Abbey and Orphan Black are very binge-worthy. HtGAwM is better watched weekly, in my opinion. I haven't watched Bloodline yet."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,donkeykonga44,32,Mon Jul 20 12:33:10 2015 UTC,Asylum.  Always.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,ilovetorunforfun,15,Mon Jul 20 15:13:48 2015 UTC,"You know why because it was American, it was Horror and it was a goddamn good STORY"
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,UmarAlKhattab,12,Mon Jul 20 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"Asylum is near perfection. Lana Banana, Sister Mary Eunice and her demonic possession, the Sister Jude arc, ""The Name Game,"" ""I Am Anne Frank,"" and, of course, PEPPER.  Asylum also manages to throw everything AND the kitchen sink into the story and somehow leaves it feeling coherent. Murder House is an excellent season and coherent as well, but doesn't nearly push the envelope as aggressively or successfully as Asylum.  Here's hoping Hotel outdoes it!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,destinystepchild,6,Mon Jul 20 20:02:24 2015 UTC,Pepper 2016
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,SayceGards,27,Mon Jul 20 20:35:29 2015 UTC,Murder House got me started. Asylum got me hooked

AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,chloeishellahigh,29,Mon Jul 20 15:01:27 2015 UTC,Murder House hands down.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,TimmytheTurtle121,6,Mon Jul 20 15:26:38 2015 UTC,YES. Denis O'Hare is perfection. The fact that you can love and be disgusted with Tate at the same time. Frances Conroy is just awesome. I love that season so much.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,distressedsquib,5,Tue Jul 21 02:47:03 2015 UTC,Damnit Charles are you in the basement again?!
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,ndsl33,4,Mon Jul 20 18:38:07 2015 UTC,"Can we talk about how amazing Lily Rabe is in Murder House? She's amazing in everything she does but in Murder House she made me hate, love, loathe and sympathize with her character. And - all the crying she did and managed not to make it look fake?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,distressedsquib,10,Tue Jul 21 02:43:46 2015 UTC,"No comparison it'll always be asylum,  even compared to all 4 seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,squidperior,11,Mon Jul 20 17:16:33 2015 UTC,"Murder House was SO good. I mean, it made me feel sorrow and depression and despair. No other show has done that to me, so I'd say Murder House was the best."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,surfinbirdjessie,4,Mon Jul 20 17:41:14 2015 UTC,"Any season with the devil, aliens, random musical numbers, and serial killers is an amazing season of television. Asylum wins."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,davis98,5,Mon Jul 20 22:37:26 2015 UTC,"I do love Murder House, but my vote goes with Asylum. Honestly, the only season I was satisfied with the character arcs."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,alucidexit,4,Mon Jul 20 17:34:42 2015 UTC,Asylum of course.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,kinkuagesimo,2,Mon Jul 20 15:52:21 2015 UTC,Does anyone have a high-res version of the Asylum image here?  I haven't found one.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,wish_to_conquer_pain,4,Tue Jul 21 02:56:04 2015 UTC,"Murder house! I honestly was really disappointed with all the seasons after murder house. I hope Freak show turns that around for me!! I am also considering binge and watching them all again, might change my mind on my initial thought."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,Cmonnayyy,3,Mon Jul 20 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"Murder House! I love the mix of feelings in Murder House, and system of all the ghosts co-existing in scary, funny, sad, and hilarious ways. Asylum had some great characters but the ending was disappointing. I hated the bit with the aliens. And lots of build up to nothing with Kit's kids just being smart in the end. MEH."

AmericanHorrorStory,3dxtif,Guckalienblue,2,Mon Jul 20 20:50:36 2015 UTC,"I loved Murder House, but I loved Asylum even more. I feel like Murder House creeped me out the most because I've always been creeped out by paranormal shit (and it was the first season I watched, so my virgin eyes were weaker). But Asylum was SO freaking good."

AmericanHorrorStory,3dw0xr,donkeykonga44,3,Mon Jul 20 00:21:19 2015 UTC,There should be a head to head vote pairing each season against each other.

AmericanHorrorStory,3dw0xr,destinystepchild,-1,Tue Jul 21 07:50:29 2015 UTC,"Freak Show is the weakest season by a landslide.  I think Asylum > Murder House >>> Coven >>>>>>>>>>>> Freak Show, but you can make a case for Coven based on the camp, and even though it's all over the place, rewatching it reveals a certain method to the madness. Freak Show was a hot mess."

AmericanHorrorStory,3dw0xr,grumblebuzz,0,Mon Jul 20 11:00:14 2015 UTC,I would have pitted Freak Show against Coven instead since the general consensus thinks they're the worst two seasons.

AmericanHorrorStory,3dto8i,mansonfamily,3,Sun Jul 19 18:29:29 2015 UTC,I agree.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dviqa,beatlebug23,3,Sun Jul 19 21:45:09 2015 UTC,I think Shachath will show up
AmericanHorrorStory,3dviqa,theahsfan,2,Mon Jul 20 14:43:27 2015 UTC,I would love any cameo of Frances Conroy. In my mind she shows more versatility in her acting than Jessica Lange(whom I adore).
AmericanHorrorStory,3dviqa,grumblebuzz,3,Mon Jul 20 17:34:13 2015 UTC,Calling it now:  Lots of connections to Murder House and Constance will show up in the later half of the season for an episode or two.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dviqa,ahsfreakshow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:41 2015 UTC,"That season two connection is a real stretch. It was never rumored to be about aliens, it was just fan speculation. Ryan debunked all space/alien theories way back while Freak Show was airing. People were picking up on clues that weren't clues."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dviqa,ahsfreakshow,-1,Mon Jul 20 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"But it's still plausible, last year Ryan said  there would be no carnival circus or freak show. Side note  its annoying when I work hard making a list and all you do is correct one mistake."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dviqa,israeldmo,3,Mon Jul 20 01:25:04 2015 UTC,"No, Ryan only said ""it's not a circus"". And it wasn't. He never denounced carnivals or freak shows specifically. He's very careful with his words, and he meant what he meant. Dude don't take it so personally. My correcting you did not diminish all the work you put into this list."
AmericanHorrorStory,3ds32l,DonatedPizza,6,Sat Jul 18 22:33:54 2015 UTC,"I think they will be possibly doing something similar to the 1408 storyline in regards to the time repeating part of it..I read somewhere on Twitter where Michael Goi was talking about Hotel being filmed in a way that time is always on a loop making it appear as though the viewer and central character is trapped in some kind of nightmare they can't escape.  Im not saying this is official or confirmed or anything, just something I remember reading about that reminded me of what you are speaking about!"

AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,bwood16,42,Fri Jul 17 23:39:04 2015 UTC,Glad for the nominations but also glad that outstanding writing isn't on the list.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,IAmThe6thDJ,5,Sat Jul 18 05:33:12 2015 UTC,"I think Monsters Among Us deserved a nomination for writing. Well, that's my opinion, though."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,israeldmo,7,Sat Jul 18 11:15:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, it was an excellent opening episode"
AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,mansonfamily,3,Sat Jul 18 15:30:19 2015 UTC,"Almost none of these awards have anything to do with the story or show itself, most of them are just design awards and casting awards."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,Gogohax,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:03:58 2015 UTC,Exactly. I would have freaked if they got a nomination for it.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,IAmThe6thDJ,2,Sat Jul 18 17:24:51 2015 UTC,"Except Coven, AHS never received nods for writing. It's a shame, there were a lot of brilliantly written episodes."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,israeldmo,2,Sun Jul 19 00:11:49 2015 UTC,I thought Orphans was a beautifully written episode. One of my favorite Ahs episodes of the entire series. But usually the season opener receives the nomination.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,fueledbyburd,12,Sun Jul 19 14:04:03 2015 UTC,"Love AHS, but this blows my mind when shows like Orphan Black get less recognition."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,israeldmo,3,Sat Jul 18 17:14:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's because Orphan Black is Canadian. Hardly we've seen non-American shows get a lot of recognition.

AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,israeldmo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:58:23 2015 UTC,"Ahs also competes in the limited series category, which is far less competitive than the drama category. Ahs would not receive nearly as many nominations if it competed as a drama series."

But I doubt it wouldn't receive all those nominations for technical categories, it's too gorgeous to ignore."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dokqs,israeldmo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:38:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely. If AHS was competing as a drama series, the technicals would still receive many nominations. The set of Freakshow was one of the most fantastic on tv this year. As far as acting nominations- I think Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates would definitely receive nominations, as well as possibly Sarah Paulson.   I just couldn't see the academy overlooking Oscar winners Bates and Lange even in the more competitive categories."

AmericanHorrorStory,3dmiir,SmashingLumpkins,19,Fri Jul 17 21:23:40 2015 UTC,"An alternative to Jesus Christ. The H is added due to numerous reasons. Some say it stood for Holy, some say it stood for Harold because of, ""Our Father, who art in heaven, Harold be thy name"". Other theories about the origin of the H. is:    H stood for Haploid since Jesus has no human father.  The truth is no one really knows for sure so a lot of people just put their own spin on it and take it the way they want."

C. As soon as Campbell had read the proofs, he swept indignantly into the shop and commanded McCormick, ""So long as you live, don't you ever diminish the Savior's name again. Put it all in."" The puckish McCormick obeyed, and then some: he set Jesus H. Christ and printed up all the pamphlets.[5]"""

People in this fandom make shit up all the time, usually for attention, and because they know a lot of fans are gullible and will believe anything. You weren't around last year when an entire production company put together a fake teaser called Fallen Angel and duped everyone, including reputable news sources. They had no reason to do it other than that they were fans of the show. I mean just in the span of this past week we've had the fake news about them filming in the Murder House, and I saw a fake tweet about Lana Del Rey joining the cast. So yeah, people can and will say anything just for the sake of it. This is the internet, don't believe everything you see."

AmericanHorrorStory,3dl609,Sanlear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:01:07 2015 UTC,"Murphy also had a similar instinct with actress Sarah Paulson, who started off playing Southern psychic Lana Winters on Season 1 of American Horror Story and graduated to the challenging role of Siamese twins Dot and Bette in Freak Show.   Um. No."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dir9e,AmbPlays,33,Thu Jul 16 16:32:46 2015 UTC,So excited Finn Wittrock was nominated! I was hoping he would but thought it was a long shot.  His performance was straight-up amazing.
AmericanHorrorStory,3dir9e,charbok,4,Thu Jul 16 16:56:17 2015 UTC,Agreed.  He totally owned that role!
AmericanHorrorStory,3dir9e,ilovetorunforfun,14,Thu Jul 16 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"I really, really think this is Sarah's year.  She had to portray two characters sharing the same body.  She had to convincingly give each of them a personality, learn how to be ambidextrous and do different things with each hand, do double the amount of scenework/takes and remember each mark and movement from previous takes... and she nailed it.    Honestly, if she doesn't win the Emmy this year, she will absolutely be robbed.  She should have won with Lana Winters, but the amount of work that she put into this role alone should have the award just handed to her."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dir9e,TheStarsDescent,5,Thu Jul 16 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"I agree that her Lana Winters was a winner, she's already been robbed."

AmericanHorrorStory,3dir9e,wildcosmias,7,Thu Jul 16 17:19:43 2015 UTC,"I think Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson and Finn Wittrock all have really good chances of winning. Also, let's be real, they can just HAND OVER the cinematography Emmy right now."

AmericanHorrorStory,3dir9e,mansonfamily,5,Thu Jul 16 17:07:05 2015 UTC,Amazing 19 Emmy nominations-Second only to Game of Thrones. Surprised to see Denis O'Hare there over Michael Chiklis. Finn Wittrock and Angela Bassett are surprises too. Amazing
AmericanHorrorStory,3dir9e,bwood16,6,Thu Jul 16 20:49:54 2015 UTC,It would have been nice to see Naomi Grossman get a nod for Pepper. She campaigned really hard for it and deserved a nod.

AmericanHorrorStory,3dir9e,bwood16,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:12:28 2015 UTC,I think there should be an Outstanding Guest Actor/Actress in a Limited Series category. Naomi definitely deserved a nomination.

AmericanHorrorStory,3dir9e,mki401,20,Thu Jul 16 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, the writing is only one of the many things that can be considered for nomination.   AHS has four things going for it:    First, it happens to have fantastic acting, from both seasoned veterans and outstanding newcomers.  Second, it has fantastic production. Some of the best set design, costume design, and art direction on television.  Third, it pioneered and continues to lead in its category (horror). Much like Glee in its heyday, it gets recognition simply for being completely different than any show ever produced. Lastly, and probably most importantly, it's an anthology series! That means it can reinvent everything and stay novel every season. Other shows are limited by the look, feel, story, and cast that they set in the pilot."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dir9e,busmans,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:36:11 2015 UTC,"Fifth, and, in my opinion, most importantly: it's a great show."

In interviews, it's been confirmed that the series was moving to LA for ""creative,"" not financial, purposes. Of course, some people suggested that that may just be because of the need to film on FX stages in LA."

AmericanHorrorStory,3dekt0,beatlebug23,2,Wed Jul 15 18:37:12 2015 UTC,They have been known to film on location at restaurants and stuff. I believe the diner in s4 is a real diner.

AmericanHorrorStory,3dezll,beatlebug23,5,Wed Jul 15 21:02:00 2015 UTC,"My hopes: -Both Gaga and Peters are supernatural beings, Gaga as a demon and Evan Peters as a Poltergeist/Ghost attacking on Room 64. -Kathy Bates and Sarah Paulson get to play very different serial killers/psychopath, with Paulson being a hardcore drug addict. -A cameo by Jessica Lange's Constance checking in the hotel with Michael, to provide continuity to the Antichrist plot yet leaving the end to the last season. -Classy Jump Scares... I want the hotel to feel like a claustrophobic nightmare for all of us, everyone getting lost into their deepest fears. -A Detective plot involving a non believer official which will start beliving as he experiences paranormal events."

AmericanHorrorStory,3dezll,Sexy_Lovecraft,3,Thu Jul 16 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I like the thought of Gaga as Myrtle 2.0, but let's face it, no one can out Myrtle Frances Conroy.  As for what I'm excited/hoping for:   Frances Conroy.  Period. Sarah Paulson's character ""Hypodermic Sally"" has me the most excited.  I'm a huge fan of hers and that nickname evokes so many things.  Could Sally be an intravenous drug addict?  Or is she a homicidal nurse?  Or something else entirely?  Too excited to see how SP does as a villain. The Finn/Matt/Gaga love triangle.  I just...whew, I need a moment to cool off. The prospect of characters from past seasons checking into the Hotel.  Constance is my biggest hope (let's face it Jessica Lange needs to at least make a cameo), but it would be incredible if they some how bring people from Asylum.  I mean, what if SP reprises her role as older Lana Winters? Room 64.  One of my favorite things about AHS is how it continues to push the boundaries of what appears on TV.  If Room 64 is really a homage to the infamous Room 64, I think we're in for seeing some crazy, debauched stuff on screen. I'm hoping to see them explore how terrifying isolation can be.  A creepy hotel is the perfect setting for that--be it with the hotel getting cut off from civilization or even someone getting trapped within one of the rooms. I hope the show touches upon that urban legend/superstition about elevators and not having a 13th floor. Another Redditor posted about the public awareness of witchcraft established at the end of Coven being part of the canon setting of Hotel, and I'd love to see that. The Hotel itself being a character of sorts.  It's a self aware entity that everyone within its walls are helpless to. Think Monster House.  The hotel consumes bad people that come to stay in it, or on the flipside, destroys those who are good."
AmericanHorrorStory,3dezll,oscarguy484,3,Thu Jul 16 14:13:06 2015 UTC,"Those ideas are very interesting, I must say. I like the idea of getting trapped within one of the Hotel rooms! I hope Frances cameos as Shacath: Angel of Death, I really liked that character. I don't think an older Lana would feature though as Paulson is already playing a character in Hotel, but I guess it's possible."
AmericanHorrorStory,3df2nw,grumblebuzz,12,Wed Jul 15 19:41:43 2015 UTC,I don't like the sound of this idea personally. I'd prefer it if she was playing a fictional character.
AmericanHorrorStory,3df2nw,theahsfan,2,Wed Jul 15 19:54:01 2015 UTC,"I'd rather her play a fictional character too, but they've been pretty guarded about her character so far and the whole ""we want her to look a certain way"" comment just kind of struck me as ""Oh, they want her to look like Lady Gaga because she might be playing Lady Gaga."""
AmericanHorrorStory,3df2nw,israeldmo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:59:20 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we know so little about all the characters. We heard virtually nothing about Sevigny's role."

AmericanHorrorStory,3df2nw,Mattchu922,4,Thu Jul 16 20:59:20 2015 UTC,I think he meant that Gaga wont look like what we expect her to.  I have high hopes

AmericanHorrorStory,3df2nw,Androuv,5,Thu Jul 16 14:27:03 2015 UTC,"Id be very disappointed seeing as this is meant to be her breakthrough role, all her other acting roles have kinda been exaggerated versions of herself so I really want a character that is fictional and unique"
AmericanHorrorStory,3df2nw,mrignatiusjreily,5,Wed Jul 15 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind it too much, but Id much prefer her being a brand new character. I'm not sure if she'll be a staff memeber or a guest, but the new teaser suggests guest. She could be a supernatural entity like a sucubus or maybe possessed."
AmericanHorrorStory,3df2nw,cosmicpizza666,2,Wed Jul 15 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"I hope not. I mean, maybe in another season she could play herself but I wanna see how she is as somebody completely different. I'm not shutting down your idea because that's actually kind of a clever idea. I would have never thought about that."
AmericanHorrorStory,3df2nw,ReaganSMAASH,2,Thu Jul 16 23:13:19 2015 UTC,"My best guess would be no, based on the fact that we know she's not doing music in the show. I can't see how Gaga could be Gaga without music."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d9hp2,theahsfan,11,Tue Jul 14 15:31:16 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for a look similar to the teaser, I imagine lots of deep warm tones, soft lighting and dusty lamps and fireplaces. I didn't like the comic con set, too stale and lacking any emotion. I want something that looks like it's been lived in and seen things."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d9hp2,Androuv,7,Tue Jul 14 21:29:59 2015 UTC,Agreed. Also all the white from the comic con one also reminded me too much of coven

Pushing star power is a good way to get the show viewers and keep it running from year to year.  If the trailers are going to affect your reception of the show it's obviously your call, but I recommend letting the episodes speak for themselves when they start premiering.  :)"

And finally we have a teaser that makes sense. The fuck was that monster hand teaser from Freak Show?? She's a villain. Paulson is a villain. Tons of new blood and not overused blood. I'm stoked. Your fears only exist because of the let down that was Freak Show.

AmericanHorrorStory,3d5ky0,spent9109,4,Mon Jul 13 20:32:11 2015 UTC,No you're not. I really don't see how this can be a decent season. The show has been straying further and further from its high point in the first 2 seasons. Ryan Murphy loves running his shows into the ground by making them progressively more over the top to the point that they become a shitty parody of what they were.

AmericanHorrorStory,3d7zwz,itsthe90s,6,Tue Jul 14 05:48:08 2015 UTC,"I have been thinking about this as well. They have to address that in some way, whether it being the Hotel universe admitting they exist or not. Another issue they might have to address is the disappearance of Madison Montgomery, who was a Lindsay Lohan/Amanda Bynes inspired character. Young and poular Madison for sure had a decent  fanbase. She was in a pop culture magazine and received two Teen Choice Awards. Madison was either 19 or 20 by the time we meet her in Coven. Hollywood would notice the disappearance of the once promising starlet, and since Hotel is set in L.A., it'd be wierd to not mention it. What's neat about the ending of Madison was she wasn't killed by the witches, and they seem to have no knowledge of where Madison went after she failed the trials. I feel Madison should make an appearance in a flashback scene or line of dialogue or something."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d7zwz,mrignatiusjreily,5,Tue Jul 14 06:10:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Madison was totally the first character to come to mind when I read the OP's post.  Especially if witches being renown is part of the Hotel canon.  It's never addressed in Coven where she runs off to, and given that Emma Roberts has been confirmed for a limited role, who better to have her play than the undead Madison?  Perhaps Hotel will provide the closure to Madison's storyline.  EDIT: I'd totally forgotten she'd been strangled at the end (thank you /u/janetwastaken).  But, maybe he didn't do a thorough enough job... ;)"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d7zwz,ilovetorunforfun,3,Tue Jul 14 13:13:31 2015 UTC,Wasn't she strangled to death in the season finale by frankenstein evan peters?

AmericanHorrorStory,3d7zwz,ilovetorunforfun,3,Tue Jul 14 16:10:59 2015 UTC,I was thinking a flashback of Madison checking in and adding backstory to some characters during her short stay. Or a funny True Hollywood Story styled TV special playing in the background of a scene.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d7zwz,mrignatiusjreily,2,Tue Jul 14 22:39:55 2015 UTC,She could have stayed there after/before one of her rehab stints. That could actually be pretty interesting....not sure what's happening while she's all messed up on something.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d7zwz,ilovetorunforfun,3,Wed Jul 15 05:11:25 2015 UTC,"Ooh, yes, I think this is much more plausible if she's to appear on Hotel!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d7zwz,danielsk1,7,Wed Jul 15 12:09:35 2015 UTC,"They could easily just mention it as a ""nonsense witch thing that is going on on New Orleans"", just to provide continuity to Coven."

AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,AIJOS,10,Mon Jul 13 23:04:26 2015 UTC,"Favorite is Asylum. It kept me interested the whole time, had great characters, and great pacing. Least favorite is coven. I didn't mind the comedy, and really liked the characters, but the plot holes and constant ressurections got on my nerves."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,davis98,3,Mon Jul 13 23:57:40 2015 UTC,"agreed! with coven i think they failed a lot of the characters. there was potential to develop interesting character arches, but alas it was all about fiona."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,nativveson,7,Tue Jul 14 00:52:41 2015 UTC,"I think season 1 is still my favorite.  My fiance prefers season 2 however.  We both agree that season 3 is our least favorite because we thought some of the characters were too useless and they tried to jam too much into it.  We loved season 4, but I don't think either of us loved it enough to make it our favorite.  I'm a sucker for ghost stories and I think season 1 did the best of all the seasons so far for wrapping up all of the plots that were introduced.  I don't feel like I was left hanging by any of the threads they weaved.  I have no idea why fiance likes 2 so much more specifically, I just know that he's not as big a fan of ghost stories as I am.  Season 4 is a close second though, I just feel like they tried to do a little too much and didn't resolve enough things personally."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,axel_val,6,Mon Jul 13 23:53:47 2015 UTC,"Asylum is, by far, my favorite. And out of all the seasons, it definitely deserves the most respect, in terms of putting things on TV that haven't really been done to the length it was, as well as helping set the definition of ""American Horror Story"" in place. It improved upon every aspect of Murder House: character development, shock value, interesting arcs, atmosphere -- while also exploring a whole new set of horror tropes, improving on the cinematography (which gets better each season -- love you Michael Goi & Co.!), and turning viewers on their heads. People tore themselves over Tate and Violet, but the shock from seeing Sister Jude and Lana trade positions was so much better, gripping, and got me to feel such conflicting love-hate relationships for those characters. AHS really hasn't done anything that great since, in terms of character writing (I think Elsa Mars comes close, but she just wasn't as sympathetic as Jude).  Murder House did the same things, but Asylum upped the formula by 200% -- unfortunately, to its downfall. Where Murder House fizzled out to the point where people stopped caring, Asylum fizzed so much that people... stopped caring.   Coven and Freak Show were very much like Murder House, in that they both seemed to fizzle out, via Coven's dropped plot, and Freak Show's lack of suspense-building and general slowness.   To this day, Asylum has been the only season that made me feel such intense fear, love, and anticipation for each episode.  Here's hoping Hotel gets us back to that dark craziness that made Asylum so great."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,simserasera,5,Tue Jul 14 13:41:32 2015 UTC,"Murder House= Asylum= Coven= Freak House And for different reasons  Murder House  was such a different piece of television. I imagine watching MH was like people back in the day watching Twin Peaks. Constance was this show's first scene stealer and my heart was aching watching Tate and Violet.   With Asylum, they upped the craziness of MH by 100. So tense and gripping. I still remember how my heart was beating out my chest when Mary Eunice locked Sister Jude in the office with Crazy Santa. The sounds of her getting beat up sent chills down my spine. Lana trying to get away from Bloody Face was one of the most gripping storylines I've seen from modern television. And the Name Game still makes me smile.   I adore Coven for it's kookiness. It was macabre yet glamorous, borderline nonsensical and just fun to watch. I loved the style, characters, and cinematography. Madison and Misty in the graveyard still makes me want to choke Madison my damn self, though I've come to find Madison a very miserable and sad character. A good pick-me-up season for a bad day.  Freak Show was amazing just because of Dandy. He stole that show from damn near everyone. I loved how melancholy it was, and the set designs were beautiful from the hot gritty Freak Show to the pristine and polished Mott Mansion. Whenever Desiree collasped into Jimmy's arms and cried after the ""Freak Show Massacre"" I wanted to cry too.  And Dandy and Stanley share the title for ""Most Desvered AHS Death"".  Im waiting on that one truly bad season that doesn't have enough good qualities to outweigh the bad. Hopefully Hotel won't be that season. I've been dying for a cool horror Hotel show. That Apartment 666 show a few years back was so disapointing. That show somehow managed to make Vanessa Williams look bad."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,mrignatiusjreily,5,Tue Jul 14 02:48:14 2015 UTC,"Least favorite is Coven because of the abundance of plot holes everywhere. It was still entertaining though and I do love some of those characters.   Favorite is Asylum for many reasons: the tense, truly scary atmosphere; the gripping story line; all the religious symbolism; the truly deep and developed characters; the gorgeous cinematography.  Asylum felt like it was deep and meaningful in a way that AHS never has been since."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,grumblebuzz,4,Tue Jul 14 11:48:55 2015 UTC,It seems to me like im the only one who doesnt like season 2! Its been wonderful hearing your opinions. My favorites (in order) are 1. Coven 2. Murder house 3. Freak show 4. Asylum However i enjoyed watching all of them but i felt that a few of asylum and freak show's episodes were a bit boring. I put coven at #1 because of the plot.

Freak Show was a disaster on a magnitude I can't even fathom. It was just boring at least when coven was boring shit was happening. Also full disclosure I watched Coven first. Had I watched asylum I probably would've killed myself seeing what they did to Peters"

AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,carr0ts,7,Tue Jul 14 10:52:00 2015 UTC,"Same! I feel like I get a lot of hate from having this opinion, but Freak Show was like a bland CW drama dressed in American Horror Story costumes and settings. Like way too many stupid personal things and crazy whackadoo plots. Characters went from enemies to allies to enemies for NO REASON and somehow it was still so boring that it couldn't hold my attention at all."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,whokilledmurph,3,Tue Jul 14 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"I always say i think FreakShow would have really benefitted from being an 8 or 10 episode long season. Think of episode 1-4 with Twisty - though still not AHS's best material, it was really good. And with the final 3-4 episodes, the season picked back up. It was everything in the middle that screwed the season up IMO (looking at you, Grace Gummers storyline)"

I love MM (I named my cat after her) and the storyline is fun and easy to watch.  Second is Murder House. The story is amazing and I love how it all explains itself the further into the series it gets. So clever.  Freak Show is third. I wasn't a fan of the plot so much, but I loved the characters.  Asylum is last, just because I still don't get the aliens."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,grumblebuzz,3,Fri Jul 17 13:14:05 2015 UTC,"I must say that it bothers me that no one ever seems to be able to give a substantial reason as to why Freak Show was ""awful"" other than they got bored or that the musical numbers existed.  Does anyone have a valid, articulate reason as to why Freak Show was so terrible that doesn't have to do with it not holding your interest or pissing you off because people dared to sing in it?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,madeyegroovy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:23:07 2015 UTC,"Surely not holding someone's attention would be a valid reason? Like others have said, they just couldn't seem to make their mind up on where the plot was going unlike with previous seasons. (Even Coven had a fairly solid plot!) Chester and the doll were quite intriguing but were brought in far too late to make a lasting impact.  There was also too much focus on Elsa that detracted from the present story."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,carr0ts,2,Sat Jul 18 01:01:51 2015 UTC,"Season 1 is my favorite. Season 2 is my second favorite. Season 3 was my least favorite until I saw Season 4. I hate to say this, but I really disliked Freak Show. I liked the first two episodes. Around the time that the guy from American Beauty showed up I was no longer interested. Season 1 is best because it is complete, Season 2 I feel like they opened a lot of threads but ended up focusing on Lana, which was good for me because her story was the most interesting. Season 3 they opened a lot of threads again but focused on drama that I was not interested in- I felt like it had CRAZY potential and fell through hard. Season 4 was the worst offender of this- first two episodes are strong, really strong- Twisty is terrifying. Everything looked so gross and beautiful at the same time- and the Twins were FANTASTIC. But what the fuck happened after that? Just nonsense. Weird drama love triangles, too many people trying to trick other people, ridiculous betrayals and then characters becoming allies straight after. Not one plot line made it to the end. And Frances Conroy was soooooo good and was removed way too fast. The end was garbage. I was interested in the Neil Patrick Harris episodes, they were ok. But other than that Season 4 totally disappointed for me."

And it's American Horror  Freak Show is by far the worst season. The singing felt out of place (This isn't Glee!) Emma Roberts' acting was abysmal, Evan Peters again had a love triangle storyline, none of the plot really went anywhere. I felt like they built up to something, ran out of time, and just had Finn Wittrock's character go around the camp shooting people.  I thought the whole season was one big joke."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,jeromerules,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:55:49 2015 UTC,"My favourite is Murder House. I just found it a simple story originally that developed in such a way that it kept me hooked throughout, and I became very attached to the characters. (It helped that there wasn't such an abundance of them unlike in Freak Show)  Asylum is fantastic, but I thought it was let down by the slightly overwhelming subplots, and I didn't like the aliens. In fact I could've happily seen Evan Peters' character cut for that season. But it did have my favourite characters of Jessica Lange and Lily Rabe, and it was also great to see Sarah Paulson take the lead role when she'd been such a tiny part of S1.  I watched Coven after I'd heard all the bad reviews (not official, just from friends and online comments) but I ended up enjoying most of it. Yes, it wasn't as mature as its predecessors but it was still entertaining.  So I guess that leaves Freak Show last. I enjoyed that too, to begin with, but it spent far too much time focusing on Elsa Mars and her backstory, which I honestly found super tedious. I didn't like the lacklustre way that Stanley and Dandy were taken down. (They were intelligent characters that were duped far too easily) Chester and the doll were good additions, but they should've been brought in earlier."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d6o10,carr0ts,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:45:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like freak show had a bad ending because of the many characters only the twins, jimmy, triple tits, elsa and pepper ended up leaving the freak show and at the very end elsa died.

I will say it is probably the most special, though.  After quite some deliberation, my favorite is Asylum and Freak Show -- equally. For a few reasons. AHS has an unparalleled knack for producing period pieces, it's impossible not to appreciate the labor put into those absolutely gorgeous set designs and pitch-perfect outfits. Freak Show's set designs are one of the most fantastic things ever put on television (The Mott Mansion was a pure work of art). Even more visually seductive, though, is the cinematography in these seasons. While I commend Coven for some of its fantastic imagery, it doesn't even lay a finger on Freak Show or Asylum. But, best of all and most important of all, they had the most interesting, grounded, and fully-conceptualized story lines (as someone who has re watched Freak Show 3 times, I can solidly say that it has the most solid writing, and most of the ""omg so many plot holes"" complaints on this sub are 100% BS from people not paying attention), the characters were the best (Dandy and Bloody Face!), and the dialogue was the most meticulously written and delivered.   Coven on the other hand.... Uhhhhh. I guess it wasn't as bad as most of us think, but it's certainly my least favorite. It's pretty much a mess. Kudos to Angela Bassett though -- Marie Laveau is the best AHS character of all time."

Remember at this time that Ben doesn't know Constance is Tate's mother (and at this time neither do we, which is why a rewatch helps to sort this out). Constance wanted Tate to see Ben so he could get better, so she wanted to punish Violet for getting in the way of Tate's treatment.  Moira was always benevolent to Vivien, she never would've put her in harm's way. So she did just do it for the health benefits. I think Moira's initial thought was that Vivien might have lost the baby because she knew the Harmons had been through so much pain already, and didn't want to see anyone else suffer in this house."

However it doesn't make much sense logistically. We know she dies in LA in Westfield High, so she had to have been at Miss Robichaux's before that. Why would she be an ""out"" witch practicing with the coven and then go to a boring random high school in Los Angeles? And there's a theory that witches don't become ghosts when they die, which explains why Fiona, Misty, and Madison were sent to hell while Spalding and the Axeman became spirits. So if Stephanie was a witch, how would she be able to appear as a ghost later on to haunt Tate? Unfortunately both Murder House and Coven are over, so there likely won't be any concrete confirmation on this, unless Stephanie returns in a third season and she's able to link those three stories together. So for now it's just an interesting fan theory and possible link."

AmericanHorrorStory,3d1ykv,ThatsSoRonan,6,Mon Jul 13 11:09:10 2015 UTC,Why does no one ever mention Hans Gruper as a connection? It's only ever Pepper!
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1ykv,LHarkins,63,Mon Jul 13 11:12:55 2015 UTC,"I really don't like this idea. It's blatant, unneeded fan service.  The appeal to me of American Horror Story being an anthology is the fact that it gets rebooted every year so it always feels fresh and storylines don't feel dragged out or tacked on just to get another season out of it. I mean we've gone from a haunted house to an asylum and then a witches coven to a freakshow, the locales and folk lore in themselves are rich enough to inspire storylines without requiring character cameos. Freakshow would have been just fine without Pepper, although looking at her big episode as more of an extension of Asylum than an actual part of Freakshows softens the blow a bit  If they start connecting lines I know there will be a ton of plot holes and stretching to make it fit. I understand 5 seasons in creating completely new characters for the actors who have been with the show for a while is difficult, but I'd much rather a retread than ""Hey look someone from another season turned up lololol!""  Obviously we know nothing about the season yet and I will still go in optimistic, I just wish we were getting a completely new crop of characters for this new premise."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1ykv,ARTNK,28,Mon Jul 13 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"I agree completely but I figured this would eventually happen . Adding Pepper in Freakshow was obviously leading to this . The storyline they created for Her in Freakshow actually made sense though and wasn't just thrown together .  So I'm a bit hopeful that they know what they're doing .   It's definteley fan service and of course there will be plot holes , this show is full of them . I think they know this and this is sort of a way to fill them ."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1ykv,IBMflamingo,7,Mon Jul 13 01:42:44 2015 UTC,So much negativity on this sub...
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1ykv,simserasera,2,Mon Jul 13 19:16:19 2015 UTC,"In no way does it imply that the connections will be large. I think a lot of people are overreacting. If Murphy & Co. keep it subtle, and don't add in any excess plot threads that haven't been covered within each respective season, it works, just as it does with the Montgomerys*, Pepper, etc."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1ykv,pinball-wizard91,7,Tue Jul 14 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"Aren't they quite limited to who could reasonably show up in the hotel? If its set in modern times I'm thinking the only rational options are Constance, old Lana, Cordelia/Zoe/Queenie or maybe one of the surviving freaks much much later on in life."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1ykv,SimeonsDilemma,7,Mon Jul 13 13:00:57 2015 UTC,"-misc spoilers ahead-  I really like the small connections they are doing. I understand that a huge part of the show's appeal is that it is an anthology series but the Asylum/Freak Show connections were pretty small in the grand scheme of things. Some people's reactions make it seem like they're thinking Ryan's going to bring the entirety of Miss Robichaux's academy to the Hotel or something. I bet anything it's gonna be smaller characters or references. With the knowledge that the season will be set present-day, that means Murder House/Coven crossovers are possible. Think small characters from those seasons- Black Dhalia, the family that the Harmon's scare out of the house in the finale, the realtor- these are the types of small crossovers I'm thinking are possible. In Coven there was the bit where Hank killed Kaylee in the hotel- maybe you will see more of that? I dunno, I like the small nods to the other seasons and I think it's really cool. I think a lot of people are overreacting or thinking that it's going to be something that it isn't.   And it's so crazy to me that so many people are ragging on this idea, yet praise the Pepper episode of Freak Show as the best of the entire series.... like, clearly it was well-received, and I read a lot of praise for the Dr. Arden reference in Freak Show as well.   And for those who are saying that Ryan is reneging on his words, I don't really think he is. He isn't bringing major characters back for elaborate arcs or anything like that- I really don't think we are going to see more of the ghost Harmons or Lana Winters or anything like that. Each season will still have it's own story and characters and it is still an anthology in that way. I think these connections are just like little Easter eggs for the fans and things to make you go ""oh!"". If you never saw Asylum and watched Freak Show, not knowing who Mary Eunice, Pepper, or Arden were before the season did not affect your understanding of what was going on. In that way, these crossovers haven't affected the sanctity of the anthology."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1ykv,TheStarsDescent,2,Mon Jul 13 19:30:59 2015 UTC,"When Hank meets with his father, doesn't his father scold him and say that a ""maid"" and another employee at the hotel lost their lives because he was sloppy?  (I don't remember the job of the other employee - I'm going from memory.)  How cool would it be if this season is set around the same time as Coven and we actually see two characters from this season meet their end due to Hank's sloppiness in season 3?  :)"

It's just a collection of stories in america in which multiple characters coincidentally intersrct."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1ykv,TheStarsDescent,3,Mon Jul 13 06:48:15 2015 UTC,"Anthology doesn't mean that it has to take place in separate universes.

AmericanHorrorStory,3d1s2g,ubermatze,30,Sun Jul 12 20:43:34 2015 UTC,"My guess? This season takes place in a Modern Day hellish limbo. Gaga is a minion of the afterlife, fucking with these people for misdeeds done while alive, and everyone plays a character they previously played.   The kicker? All of them are so far gone into denial that they believe they're someone else. The moment they realize who they are? Check out time from the hotel, and check in straight to Hell.   My reasoning? A hotel is a place you stay, not a place you reside. It's loosely analogous to purgatory."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1s2g,CraftyAitrus,26,Mon Jul 13 03:42:10 2015 UTC,"Im guessing season 1 & 3 characters since we have already been given an asylum and Freakshow connection!  Obviously the Harmons are dead..im calling it now..Constance Langdon returns in this!  Ryan even said ""it gives you the power to leave and come back...like Jessica Lange!"" Her and her grandson Michael..maybe Zoe or Queenien from Coven? Lol I really don't know but of I had to bet Id say Constance!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1s2g,Ey3z0nF1rE,13,Sun Jul 12 20:46:52 2015 UTC,The very final scene in Murder House takes place in 2015 so if anyone from season 1 comes it'll definitely be Constance.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1s2g,Gogohax,5,Mon Jul 13 03:10:52 2015 UTC,"Someone actually had an idea that since Tate (Evan Peters) was Michael the Antichrist's father and Evan Peters was playing a bad guy this season, he could be playing Michael the adult this season, and it would work great because obviously the genetic features would look similar.  Of course, that can't actually work out unless a season of AHS was set in the future.  But now I'm thinking that maybe we'll get a continuation to season 1's final cliffhanger and see what Constance and little Michael are up to."

AmericanHorrorStory,3d1s2g,theahsfan,21,Sun Jul 12 20:58:30 2015 UTC,"Shacath   They could use her in the present too.  She's the Angel of Death so I'm sure she's still in existence.  If any of the Coven witches check in, they could also tie her to one of them since they can be linked through the supernatural.  Then they'd be connecting seasons 2, 3, and 5 pretty easily."

AmericanHorrorStory,3d1mg8,thepalexmperor,2,Sun Jul 12 21:46:01 2015 UTC,"So  much stuff about scream queens! I hope they reveal more about hotel, since we know so much about SQ already and next to nothing about hotel."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1mg8,j-dawgz,2,Sun Jul 12 20:11:52 2015 UTC,Ryan names Halloween and Misery among his favorites   Of course he would say that.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1mg8,j-dawgz,2,Sun Jul 12 22:39:43 2015 UTC,I feel like i'm the only one saddened by the fact that i'll never get to hear Kathy Bates sing Doll Parts OR Bad Romance.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1mg8,Zinthaniel,2,Mon Jul 13 00:29:20 2015 UTC,"Lady Gaga asked to be on the show?  I'm open to her being on Hotel and everything, but I'm really hoping Murphy made sure she can actually act/was fit for the show rather than just accepting her request on the spot. He should've made her run lines at least?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1mg8,Zinthaniel,2,Sun Jul 12 21:17:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you and even posted a similar comment a few minutes ago!!  Murphy spoke about how he locked down the series lead star Lady Gaga (who was a no-show at today’s panel, in addition to Scream Queens pop star Ariana Grande, who’s on tour). Gaga’s character won’t be singing, which has been largely known.  Murphy explained that he often receives phone calls from actors pining to be in the show. Gaga wrote to him about whether she could appear in it, and Murphy said “I responded YES — CAPS CAPS CAPS.”  Gaga phoned Murphy. “The best words you can ever hear are, ‘Please hold for Gaga.’ She was lovely. She told me she had an acting background. She told me she wanted to play someone evil. I said, ‘OK, you came to the right place.'”  Gaga, who has a zany schedule, cleared a wide portion so she could focus on AHS: Hotel. “She is very collaborative, incredibly fun,” said Murphy. “Part of her role involves fashion. You want her looking a certain way. Designers have been coming out of the woodwork.”"

AmericanHorrorStory,3d0b7d,ubermatze,4,Sun Jul 12 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"When the interviewer said that they ""both"" are gonna be bad guys, did he mean Sarah and Angela or Sarah and Matt?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d0b7d,Ey3z0nF1rE,5,Sun Jul 12 13:20:53 2015 UTC,"No im almost positive he was directing it at Angela and Sarah..Angela shook her head as to motion ""yes"" when answering the question...I think he was referencing the tweet about Angela causing trouble for Gaga in the ballroom and elsewhere, but i could be wrong!"

AmericanHorrorStory,3d4cwn,beatlebug23,4,Mon Jul 13 12:58:58 2015 UTC,the teaser wasn't referring to slender man.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d4cwn,Zinthaniel,3,Mon Jul 13 19:17:03 2015 UTC,"The teasers aren't always literal, in fact most of the time they're representative of future events in that season. There are a lot of different interpretations out there about what the Extremes teaser could be referring to. But it was never supposed to be Slender Man. It looked like him, but that was never their intent."

Denis did say he was having ""body work"" done this week before shooting, maybe they're refitting him for Larry's burn scars? It would be neat to see him escape from prison and lay low in the hotel for a bit while he's on the lam."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d2czx,ahsfreakshow,2,Mon Jul 13 00:06:05 2015 UTC,That would be a pretty good spin..didn't even think of him at all!

But because of the Art Deco design of the hotel, there are potential flashbacks going all the way back to the 20s. I have a feeling we'll see season 1 minor characters, or just more fan favorites like Pepper"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d2czx,LoganK36,2,Mon Jul 13 03:21:52 2015 UTC,isnt she dead though?
AmericanHorrorStory,3d2czx,beatlebug23,2,Mon Jul 13 00:08:11 2015 UTC,"It's totally possible that it could be in some sort of flashback. If the story is taking place in LA, she could've been staying at the hotel when she came to visit Ben."

Something that comments on the nature of the country and society. Hmph. But that's just a wild guess."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d25wl,ahsfreakshow,5,Tue Jul 14 13:50:20 2015 UTC,"He also said that there's a reason why Pepper was in two seasons. I don't know if he's saying there's a reason it was Pepper or if there's a reason it was two seasons, but either way there's definitely some grander scheme going on here than we initially thought."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d25wl,israeldmo,2,Mon Jul 13 00:03:10 2015 UTC,"Hotel is the fifth installment of Ryan Murphy's American Horror Story franchise, this time taking place in a hotel in Los Angeles in 1935.   Is this accurate?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d25wl,ahsfreakshow,6,Sun Jul 12 23:18:42 2015 UTC,"No, DP Michael Goi already confirmed it's taking place in the present day, and so far LA hasn't been confirmed as the location."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d25wl,israeldmo,3,Mon Jul 13 00:00:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know it. But I never read anything about it taking place in 1935 nor did I watch the Comic-Con panel so I wasn't sure whether or not this is true."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d25wl,ahsfreakshow,3,Mon Jul 13 00:21:15 2015 UTC,I got ya. They didn't say anything about the setting at the panel. So I have no idea where that article got its info from.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d25wl,Ey3z0nF1rE,2,Mon Jul 13 00:36:30 2015 UTC,No
AmericanHorrorStory,3d25wl,aphidkid,-1,Sun Jul 12 23:41:21 2015 UTC,Whatever it is it will be a mess. It could have worked if he had planned it from the start but everyone can tell that trying to link the seasons together will not end well.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1t0y,Ey3z0nF1rE,5,Sun Jul 12 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"that's great it would suck if season 5 was the end of it,I hope he doesn't get to caught up in his other projects to let ahs become sloppy  or whatever"

AmericanHorrorStory,3d1qcc,theahsfan,3,Sun Jul 12 20:47:06 2015 UTC,"no what you posted is not what Ryan sAid.  It's what the blogger who was relaying what Ryan said wrote.  What RYAN officially said was ""This season you'll see more and more of that. Characters from other seasons will check into the hotel. It's part of a connected universe, which I think a pretty cool thesis statement at the end of the run."""

A deranged wanna be nurse that could never pass the exams so she lurks through a hotel doing her own ""procedures"" on people..lol but seriously who knows..I was just making a guess off context clues but to be honest their names most likely ARENT mr. March and hypodermic Sally..it is or prob something close to them..like last year Ryan have clues or bits and pieces..ie edward Mordrake was ""eddie"" and jessica is ""practicing her German accent"" and so forth.."

AmericanHorrorStory,3d1tg2,theahsfan,3,Sun Jul 12 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"You don't know that Jessica won't check in for sure.  I Would say there's over a 50% chance that she returns.  During an interview with The Wrap, Jessica now says she would ""absolutely"" come back if creator Ryan Murphy offered her ""a small character for a couple of episodes."" ""This was a great collaboration,"" she continued, ""so I would love to keep working with him.""   It's also worth noting this is also just about exactly the scenario Ryan Murphy described in an interview with TV Line last fall. ""It always starts with a character for Jessica, so I think I'd have to present her with something she was very interested in,"" he said. ""I really want her to keep her hand in. Does that mean 13 episodes? Does that mean six? Does that mean one?"" Who knows but nothing's impossible..she would ""absolutely"" return for the right character and amount of episodes..and Ryan absolutely loves her..so regardless of whT she said 8 months ago..she most Likely will be back on the AHS set at some point!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1tg2,Ey3z0nF1rE,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:56:35 2015 UTC,I was pretty sure she wouldn't return until the AHS panel at Palayfest this year. Then I became suspicious.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1tg2,israeldmo,-1,Sun Jul 12 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"No I don't, but I don't (personally) think she will because Jessica is very final with her word and I think she just wants a break."
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1tg2,Ey3z0nF1rE,3,Sun Jul 12 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"If she is final with her word and wants a break then why did she go public 3 weeks ago and say she ""absolutely"" will return?  She isn't even taking a break.:she is the lead in a Broadway play.:that is also being directed by guess who? Ryan murphy"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1tg2,Ey3z0nF1rE,-2,Sun Jul 12 21:02:25 2015 UTC,"a) I think she meant other seasons after Hotel  b) That's not AHS, that's a Broadway play."

Just like she was saying she was going to leave after season 1..and then 2..and then 3...and then ""FOR SURE"" after Freakshow..she doesn't know what she wants.  She'll be back sooner than later in my opinion, I'll agree to disagree with you!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1tg2,Ey3z0nF1rE,-1,Sun Jul 12 21:06:12 2015 UTC,"I really hope she does, don't get me wrong. I'm just saying I doubt she'll be back, but like you say I'm not gonna rule it out because there's a good chance she might!"

AmericanHorrorStory,3d1tg2,ahsfreakshow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:09:40 2015 UTC,And just so you know a Broadway play is much more physically demanding and technical to do compRed to filming a TV show with the magic of editing..so to want to take a break..but then take on a harder job makes no sense.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1tg2,ahsfreakshow,0,Sun Jul 12 21:07:05 2015 UTC,Maybe she just wanted to take a break from AHS because to be fair she had done 4 seasons. But yeah I don't understand why she's taken on a Broadway play straight after saying she wanted a break.
AmericanHorrorStory,3d1tg2,Ey3z0nF1rE,2,Sun Jul 12 21:16:06 2015 UTC,yeah Jessica and ryan are being very coy ryan also said previous ahs characters will return for hotel hopefully Lily and Frances will have a minor one episode story arch like Mary Eunice

AmericanHorrorStory,3d0mxc,mariecblue,7,Sun Jul 12 14:51:22 2015 UTC,"Moira doesn't age. She has two appearances, but she doesn't age. None of the ghosts do. Moira's older appearance refers to her ""old soul""/the multi-faceted nature of her character. There's more to her than meets the eye. She's not just a sexy maid. During the course of the show, Moira talks with Vivien about literature and medicine. That's not something that just any maid would know about. Despite being pretty, Moira is also intelligent. Early on in the show, she tells Vivien that women see the true essence of a person, who they really are, and that men just see what's on the outside. The reason Moira has that second appearance is because she's more complicated than most of the female characters on the show. If you look at a lot of the women, their through-lines are pretty easy to follow. Constance wants a picture-perfect family and resents the world for not getting it. Hayden is the scorned mistress. Vivien is the wronged wife. Violet hates everyone and everything. Nora is a stuck-up socialite. None of these ideas are all that complex, so they get that simple characterization, that one ""appearance."" Moira works in shades of gray, which gives her the dual images and looks people see her by. When a person dies in Murder House, their essence/soul is preserved. Usually that includes their appearance. But since Moira was more than just a pretty face, her apparition has more mystery to it."

It was so obvious who the new Supreme was going to be from episode 1, but they tried so hard to pretend it wasn't by blatantly lying to the audience. That's shitty writing, objectively."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Riseagainstyou,12,Sat Jul 11 18:49:10 2015 UTC,"I just now finished it for the first time binge watching the last few days on Netflix.  I thought it was terrific and darkly humorous.  Great performances all around.  Fun to watch.  I had seen negative chatter about it so was surprised to learn Coven received lot's of acclaim.  I just saw why people loved it and why it has an 87% approval rating and heaps of nominations.  I watched Season one and enjoyed it alot,  much better then I thought it would be.   I had trouble getting past ep 3 on Asylum, maybe because I worked in one for 20 years....skipped to Coven and loved it once I got past the fake seriousness and realized it was just a funny, gory, comedy with a bevy of twisted and lovable characters.  It does get a little much at times, but it's a tour de force of style.  Now I can start Season 2 and not get mired in it's grotesqueness.  It's a warped comedy too.  Also waiting with baited breath for ""Freak Show."" to show up on Netflix.  Like other great shows, I can't imagine watching it with commercial interruptions and waiting a week to see the next installment.  That would drive me crazy. Binge watching is the way to go.  So glad I didn't watch it when it was broadcast."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Kelpszoid,2,Sat Jul 11 08:29:13 2015 UTC,Season 2 is great Lana banana.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,-MangoDown,4,Sat Jul 11 23:49:22 2015 UTC,"Saw the entire thing today, it defies description, quite a masterpiece of grand guignol.  And yeah Lana Banana!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Kelpszoid,12,Sun Jul 12 04:01:14 2015 UTC,I didn't like it all that much on first viewing but I went back and watched it again after Freak Show finished and it was alot better the second time around. I think it works alot better without the week gap between episodes. There are a lot of really good moments that happen quite closely together but having a gap in between episodes just makes it feel boring imo.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,freeebbo,84,Sat Jul 11 08:44:17 2015 UTC,"Besides the uneven writing, poor character development and anticlimax season arc, the season just felt so odd and out of place with the first two seasons. It was super campy and clearly directed at a different demo.  Also, the fact that Ryan Murphy is pretty much doing it over as its own series with 'Scream Queens' shows (to me at least) that it should have been its own thing to begin with, not shoehorned into the AHS series."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,ZomNoms,26,Sat Jul 11 04:46:12 2015 UTC,Fingers crossed Scream Queens becomes the outlet for this stuff for Ryan and AHS returns to the same dark and twisted style of Murder House and Asylum. I enjoyed Coven and all but it was definitely a different season. Freak Show wasn't great either though.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,mrignatiusjreily,2,Sat Jul 11 14:34:27 2015 UTC,"I actually find Coven more contextually disturbing than Murder House. I never was scared of this show but Murder House pulled me in because of the creepy weird tone, a tone that has remained in each season. I don't watch this show to be scared; I watch for the weirdness and great acting, which Coven for sure had."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,velmax,17,Sat Jul 11 20:23:31 2015 UTC,"I personally love it too, but ppl have different tastes, and that's okay. I personally love the one liners and the humor."

AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,GSKashmir,19,Sat Jul 11 05:38:01 2015 UTC,"Coven is a big departure from Asylum.  Not as scary at all, it's more like charmed than AHS.  That's not a bad thing, it's just not horror."

AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,_silentheartsong,10,Sat Jul 11 12:21:29 2015 UTC,"If anyone says season1 wasn't campy, they weren't paying attention."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,The_Real_Expert,4,Sat Jul 11 12:49:12 2015 UTC,Murder House was an actual soap opera; Ryan and Brad said so themselves in all the videos for that season.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,tclovescheese,2,Sat Jul 11 20:27:28 2015 UTC,I'd say it was more Shock than Horror. It had some disturbing sequences but in general the tone was not horror. It was very unbalanced which is part of why the season is so disliked imo.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,SomeRandomBuddy,17,Sat Jul 11 17:42:22 2015 UTC,A lot of characters were seemingly useless and had subplots that went nowhere; main characters got killed off simply because they didn't know what else to do with them (ala Misty); some stories got dropped altogether (like the Madame LaLaurie or whatever her name was redemption thing); Zoe ended up being rather unnecessary; a lot of the time the girls don't seem to care when they murder people....
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,_silentheartsong,0,Sat Jul 11 05:07:25 2015 UTC,"True, but on a whole it is a very enjoyable season and is very gripping imo"
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,cyruscg,8,Sat Jul 11 05:16:58 2015 UTC,How? You aren't explaining
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,israeldmo,3,Sat Jul 11 12:57:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know. For me it's the idea of witchcraft and magical aspect that I find intriguing, along with the characters and plot/storylines. I didn't like the Fiona/Axeman storyline though I admit, and I thought Evan could have played a bigger character than Kyle who barely speaks."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Goggles_Pisano,4,Sat Jul 11 13:00:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting concepts =/= successful storytelling. I agree that, on paper, Coven sounds awesome. But Murphy and his team did a real shit job of writing a cohesive season of television.  I think it's fair to say that Coven is objectively bad. You can like something that's bad, and that's totally fine -- but, taken as a whole, the season is not very good."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,ahsfreakshow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:59:07 2015 UTC,"Bruh just because the big names had lead roles in past seasons, you expecting it to be the same way in Coven is a classic case of YOU letting yourself down. Not Coven."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,prettylittlepumpkin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:20:47 2015 UTC,"I've actually not seen the first two seasons, and therefore had no expectations from anyone in the show, let alone the leads."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Shloop_Shloop_Splat,5,Tue Jul 14 03:32:06 2015 UTC,"I thought it was an overall interesting season, but I was waiting for the shocking plot twist that murder house and asylum had... And then it never came, which left me feeling disappointed.   The writers using rebirth to fill in plot holes was annoying, and the season was overall anticlimactic.  I thought it was good, but not AHS good, more just something to throw on while doing something else."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,prettylittlepumpkin,3,Sat Jul 11 09:30:22 2015 UTC,"If it didn't have many plot issues, it could have been the strongest season yet. But, in my opinion, everything else compensates it. It may be the weakest season (I'm still deciding if I like Murder House more or not) but it was still compelling television."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Shloop_Shloop_Splat,4,Sat Jul 11 11:46:05 2015 UTC,"I don't hate Coven. It was however AHS weakest season by far. It was a decent enough story, but it lost momentum as it went along. It ended up being a bunch of women who could do magic and who could be the biggest bitch and anti-bitch.  Coven is the perfect example that AHS needs to be binge watched to get the best viewing experience. As it neared the end I began to feel sympathy for those who had to watch it one hour per week. I don't think I would have ever finished Coven if that is how I had to watch it.  (While on the subject - I don't know how anybody can watch any series one hour per week, especially AHS. The wait between episodes kills any built-up suspense, and commercial breaks totally ruin the viewing experience. Breaking Bad was the last series I watched weekly, and the last [half] season made me realize that I won't watch TV like that any longer. Now my wife and I wait for Bluray/Netflix for any series we want to watch, then binge watch 3-4 episodes an evening until we complete it. Then we move on to the next season or an entirely different series.)"
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,prettylittlepumpkin,7,Sat Jul 11 13:44:34 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of a lot of things: several plot holes, no primary villain, unexpectedly dropped story lines and characters that had a lot of potential, and just an overall sense that the writers were sort of making stuff up as they went along. Compared to Murder House and Asylum, which represent the pinnacle of continuity and cohesive horror storytelling, Coven just paled in comparison. And don't get me wrong, I still loved it and by no means ""hate"" it, but in my opinion and I'm sure in many others', it's just not as incredible as other seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Kelpszoid,10,Sat Jul 11 04:29:27 2015 UTC,"For me it is because the first season was sooo good, perfect really in how it played out many different possible murders in one house and then in modern day connected them all...anything after that wasn't going to compare. It was decent though.   Another aspect...it's because Coven could have played up the voodoo/witch background aspect more and made it less about the Supreme, more about the history of the school, about fleeing the witch trials in Salem, about the voodoo culture in New Orleans. It was sad because they had a lot of potential story lines to play with in general, with the broad topic of witchcraft.   edit: Theory going around that people's favorite season depends on the one they start the show on. You catch that thrill and associate it with that season and the rest won't be as thrilling as the first one you saw."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,theroboticdan,9,Sat Jul 11 04:29:49 2015 UTC,"I started with Murder House, and it's probably my least favorite. I'm sure I'd be considered an outlier for the theory though, as a lot of fans cite the first season as their favorite.  For me it would be (from favorite to least favorite) Asylum > Coven > Freakshow > Murder House.  Coven had it's issues, but there were so many things I liked that I could kind of ignore the stuff I didn't."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,MaximumHeresy,6,Sat Jul 11 05:27:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't get me wrong, I love AHS...I don't even like horror movies but I'm addicted to every episode and every season, whether or not I dislike certain things. (Aliens in Asylum kind of ruined the whole vibe of it for me)"
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,AnnyongFunke,4,Sat Jul 11 05:39:26 2015 UTC,"I'm a sci-fi buff, so the alien stuff in Asylum was pretty cool to me. That season had a little bit of everything."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,shadowdra126,2,Sat Jul 11 06:03:11 2015 UTC,And hands down the scariest exorcism scene I've ever seen...I think they found me in the fetal position crying after that. Didn't sleep for days.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,laurandisorder,4,Sat Jul 11 06:26:06 2015 UTC,"Seems to me that the different season might require breaking down existing expectations and avoid trying to tie each season together, just because there are a lot of the same faces.  I like this approach.  It's clever."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,ZeroNBC,2,Sat Jul 11 08:51:46 2015 UTC,too many resurrections made it feel like there were no stakes
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,jor1ss,2,Sat Jul 11 13:13:01 2015 UTC,"I liked Coven. I thought Freak Show was the worst season (they reused too many previous themes, and they should have had a better villain)"

AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Foot_Fetish_Fred,2,Sat Jul 11 21:27:41 2015 UTC,It's my favorite season but I will admit it was not scary
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Ranger5052,2,Sun Jul 12 02:30:38 2015 UTC,"I loved the season.   Don't get me wrong, I like my AHS dark and brooding (Asylum is my favourite to date), but I liked the total departure from the moody vibe to something that I almost equated to Buffy for grown ups.   The dialogue was snappy and though the overall arch was a little disappointing, the season had plenty of redeeming qualities; Bassett was brilliant, Bates was part comedienne and part atrocity and Misty and the Fleetwood Mac/Stevie Nicks fan-girling was right up my alley. I was raised on those jams!  I loved the season for completely different reasons as to why I loved the first two seasons and I guess that is why it gets a bad rap. Coven was cheesy, bright and kind of in your face. There was nothing subtle about it.  It doesn't mean that the season was bad, it was just different."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Zebradoodle,2,Sun Jul 12 03:04:14 2015 UTC,"I'm about halfway through Coven and I love it, but I definitely see how people don't like it. It's got a completely different vibe from Murder House and Asylum,  and the people that were expecting it to be like the first two seasons were probably disappointed. Like other people said on here, it was too campy compared to the other seasons. I wouldn't say Coven is my favorite season as of right now, but I do really enjoy it."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,hairypolack,3,Mon Jul 13 01:37:20 2015 UTC,Coven is my favourite after Murder House. It was definitely a lot better than Freak Show.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,nicollewx,3,Sat Jul 11 12:08:54 2015 UTC,"As a writer, the characters just didn't arc as much as the first two seasons, and it was disappointing."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,Synchrox,4,Sat Jul 11 16:43:01 2015 UTC,The only thing I liked about Coven was the history they tried to tie into it.

AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,GDDesu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:56:08 2015 UTC,"Coven is my favourite season BECAUSE it's so unlike the others. Murder House is my second favourite but I couldn't sleep for weeks after because of Thaddius! He creeped me out so much more than any of the other characters, and I don't even know why. It's not even that he's reanimated, it's just his face that scares me. I enjoyed Asylum but the aliens were strange and not explored more (which would've been so much more interesting if we found out more about their purpose) and Thredson's mother issues were absolutely terrifying, ESPECIALLY because on the outside he's a fully functioning seemingly healthy (mentally) human being; I trusted him!   Coven was so easy to watch and follow (I had to google what was going on in the first two seasons, especially murder house, cos I just couldn't wait till the end to find out, which was when all the loose ends were tied) and I genuinely loved all the characters. The contrast between some of the characters, such as Fiona & Madison being so corrupt and mean but Misty & Cordelia being genuinely good, was so entertaining and balanced out the whole dynamic. I felt relief every time someone was resurrected because I like them all so much, and it didn't wear on me at all. I thoroughly enjoyed the Supreme storyline and I thought it fitting that Cordelia ended up being the Supreme after a lifetime of living in her mother's shadow; she can finally outshine Fiona and be the Supreme that the coven will remember for all the right reasons. I'm admittedly disappointed that they didn't show Kyle being reunited with Zoe after her resurrection after he was so distraught by her death, and that he killed Madison because she was one of my favourite characters, but that's probably my only qualm with this season. But the thing I loved most was the fashion; every outfit was iconic and it made the entire season drip with glamour.  I suppose I'm just gentle and can't deal with content that's too strong and horrific! But Coven was SO GOOD and I think it's really undeserving of all its bad press, but we all have our preferences. (Note: I'm yet to watch Freak Show as it isn't on Netflix yet, but I'm staying open minded!)"
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,mepat1111,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:29 2015 UTC,I absolutely LOVE all the seasons. Coven was my favorite though because it was just... fun and the concept of witches was interesting. The cast were fantastic too.

AmericanHorrorStory,3cvo68,lawlwaht,-1,Sun Jul 12 07:23:11 2015 UTC,I feel like Coven relied more on shock than keeping the mood creepy.  There were a lot of emotional swings but it was hard to care about most of the characters when you got to see them back stab each other.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cu7ci,theahsfan,34,Fri Jul 10 20:30:13 2015 UTC,I agree wholeheartedly. Sister Mary Eunice is actually one of my favourite characters from any television programme.

AmericanHorrorStory,3cv76f,ahsfreakshow,0,Sat Jul 11 22:35:04 2015 UTC,Why bring up the Cecil Hotel? They look nothing alike; the Cecil is brown and neoclassical; the Oviatt Penthouse is gray and art deco.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cv76f,ahsfreakshow,2,Sat Jul 11 20:19:10 2015 UTC,"I wasnt speaking of color I was talking about the structure of the building..and yes the Cecil Hotel also has the ""colonial"" Art Deco design as well...Google ""hotel Cecil Art Deco"" and there are over ten pages talking about the Cecil being built and carrying the Art Deco design.  Also, the interior design for the comic con hotel, (and it's been said the replica hotel will be close to resembling the actual hotel) used a similar interior as the Hotel Cecil and the exact same flooring pattern.

But again I ask, why bring up the Cecil? The story's not actually taking place there."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cv76f,ahsfreakshow,5,Sat Jul 11 22:52:28 2015 UTC,"I was just saying that the Hotel Cecil had a resemblance to the Oviatt building which is new to me..the reason I brought it up is because some people have theories that some of the happenings at the Cecil will be tied into the AHS hotel storyline..the filming address leaked so I googled the address, saw the Oviatt building come up..looked at s picture of it and it has a very similar structure to the Cecil...(if you painted the Oviatt building brown and added red shutters over the windows you almost can't tell a difference between the two).,.and I noticed the Cecil's lobby uses the same flooring pattern as the comic con replica hotel so i figured it was worth mentioning..didn't think it would be made into a big deal!! Lol the only thing ""neoclassical"" about the Cecil is the galvanized metal roofline."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,theahsfan,4,Sat Jul 11 01:51:30 2015 UTC,"That number makes absolutely no sense either. The whole season will cost $9 million? That's almost what the cost per episode is. Don't believe this crap, it's just a Gaga fan account and it literally has a poop emoji as its icon. I just came across a Twitter account that claimed to have known all 13 episode titles of this season and Michael Goi had to step in to confirm that absolutely none of them were accurate. People make shit up all the time to feel special, especially AHS fans, so just ignore them and wait for the actual info from actual sources."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,ahsfreakshow,-5,Sat Jul 11 02:15:47 2015 UTC,I hate seeing those Twitter accounts who think Gaga will be the lead in Hotel. She'll most likely be in a few episodes as a special guest star! Same with Ariana Grande in Scream Queens.. gawd she's probably the first to go.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,ahsfreakshow,5,Sat Jul 11 02:19:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, I highly doubt that. Ryan wouldn't have announced her first or allowed her to reveal the subtitle of the season if she was only in a few episodes. Plus we know she'll be making trouble with Bassett and that she's stuck in a love triangle between Bomer and Wittrock, so it sounds like she's got plenty of story line ahead of her. She won't be the singular star but she likely will be prominent."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,ahsfreakshow,-7,Sat Jul 11 02:26:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah but think how hard it will be to get her on the show for one episode alone, she's worth $230 million! I think she's gonna be a reccuring character personally and those story lines don't necessarily have to last the whole season."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,ahsfreakshow,5,Sat Jul 11 02:32:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but that's honestly an absurd excuse to back up your argument. Her net worth has nothing to do with this. Ryan and the cast have been talking nonstop about what it's like to work with her, they wouldn't be blowing this so far out of proportion if she was only going to guest star in a handful of episodes. Also why do you think it would be hard to get her on the show? I'm sure she wanted to be on it just as much as Ryan wanted her."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,Ey3z0nF1rE,-5,Sat Jul 11 02:42:56 2015 UTC,"If you say so. She probably won't guest star, more like be a special reccuring character, of course with several story lines surrounding her."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,israeldmo,4,Sat Jul 11 02:52:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I'm 100% right, I'm just saying I've been around this show for quite some time and I know how Ryan operates. The first people he casts are those who will have main roles. There's a reason why Jessica was always the first one confirmed each year."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,ahsfreakshow,-5,Sat Jul 11 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I probably over reacted lol. It's fine. I just don't think that Gaga will have the main role, idk."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,israeldmo,2,Sat Jul 11 03:12:18 2015 UTC,"She will have a main role..that's what Ryan means by ""her part is huge.."" And trust me $230 million...that all may be true...but I highly doubt this show is about money to her.  It's her first major television crossover so I inagine she is willing to sacrifice a little for the show..what im saying is this seems to be more of something she is passionate about rather than strictly business, Ya know?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,Ey3z0nF1rE,-7,Sat Jul 11 03:51:50 2015 UTC,I hope she doesn't have a main role personally but like you say she probs will. I just hope she doesn't fuck it all up.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,Ey3z0nF1rE,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:54:43 2015 UTC,"$230 million is ridiculously high. I mean, I hardly see the highest-paid actors in Hollywood receiving more than $80 million to do a blockbuster movie, let alone a cable TV show. And Gaga is not an A-list actress."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cvamk,HuntyZombie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:22:54 2015 UTC,"I think you're mistaken, $230 million is Gaga's net worth, it is not how much she's getting paid to do this show. That's why I said that number has nothing to do with this."

AmericanHorrorStory,3cpp8h,Tobias_you_blowhard,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:21:32 2015 UTC,"It has to be pretty close to the real set because Ryan said for the interior of the hotel he replicated the designs and colors of his real life home kitchen and bedroom, which matches what I see here.  The black and white is the color of his bedroom and he has a beautiful all white everything kitchen.  It looks good except I was hoping it would look more old/run down and kind of dungeon-y looking!"

AmericanHorrorStory,3clkbj,Zinthaniel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:21:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand your contention with what should or should not be at comic con. It's first convention ever did not only include comic books either. It has alway been a multimedia gathering for comic, film,  and game aficionados. The events that took place during it's modest beginnings did include film screenings and has acted as the blueprint for all comic-cons that came after.   As television programming has involved into the pioneering beacon that so often creates large communities of fans obviously it's presence at comic-con was a no brainer. Television series in many ways are similar in their way of creating a strongly binded fan base that you often see with comic books. Think Doctor Who.   From day one the goal has been for the convention to eventually become a much bigger and larger event that it now is.   So this set being there as a promotion for a show and it being an immersive set piece for guest there to actually walk around in is very analogous with what comic con has always been about.   You can read the history in the following links -   http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Learn-History-San-Diego-Comic-Con-Just-4-Minutes-66353.html  http://www.comic-con.org/about  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International#History_and_organization"
AmericanHorrorStory,3clkbj,clwestbr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:53:15 2015 UTC,"It was meant to involve things of the comic-book medium. In 1970 there were a few films and television shows, as well as a dedication to sci-fi that inspired a lot of the comic book notions.  Now, shit, everything that wants it has a panel. There are smaller booths from Image, from Boom, from IDW, but for the most part its film promotion and television stuff. Hell, Horns had a damn panel. There are just things I'd like to see get more prominence if we're going to shove everything and its cousin's dog into the Con, and one of those things is actual comics."

I didn't like season 2 at all and had issues with 3 and 4, but I see so much continued potential that I stick around each season to see if the show achieves the greatness its capable of again. And the last 2 seasons weren't awful, just hard to sit through for some bits of dialogue. It was still fun to watch.  You don't have to love every instant of every episode to be a fan of a show."

That's probably a very good clue that they're going to be partners in crime, something like Bonny & Clyde, maybe.   I just want to see outstanding character development. One of the best things in AHS history is Asylum's characterization of Jude and Lana. Both characters start in one place but end up in opposite positions. The sympathy and hate cards were played extremely well, and it's amazing to think that we cheered Lana on in the beginning, only to hold a good amount of resentment towards her at the end, in addition to despising Sister Jude but feeling compassion towards her by the finale. I want something similar in Hotel--complex, engaging, something that turns the audience on their heads. That's been missing in the last couple of seasons (well, in all characters except for Lange's. I feel that Ryan Murphy & Co really tried to play the Jude card with Fiona and Elsa by having the latter two replay the astounding contrasting traits in Jude's character, but to a degree that just wasn't as effective.)  They'll have the dark and grim atmosphere this time around. Let's hope they can make it better with outstanding character writing."

For one she would have been too young..elsa was older and the entire reason she came to America with her FreaKshow Dream was because of her history in eastern Germany and her connection to Hans Gruper along with her unfortunate ""events"" (amputation/dominatrix stint)  Plus I don't think Ryan would have done FreaKshow without Jessica.  For one, the entire freskshow/traveling carnival troupe premise was based on HER idea to do so.  Jessica is a photographer by hobby and one of the many things she likes to explore is ""the forgotten"" and she pitched the idea of Traveling carnival or freaKshow troupe to Ryan and he loved it.  She actually presented it to him before season 3 took place but he was already pretty much set in stone to make season 3 eithe Coven or Hotel (yes Ryan has stated he has been sitting on the hotel idea for a couple of seasons..and with hotel taking place in present-day he could've gotten away with setting it as season 3!). He also felt that, due to the dark nature of Aslyum, he had to present a more campy season like Coven!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3cgt07,Ey3z0nF1rE,-4,Tue Jul 7 20:23:07 2015 UTC,It could've worked if things occurred differently and the Elsa storyline was completely different.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cgt07,PotatoesMcLaughlin,7,Tue Jul 7 21:06:06 2015 UTC,Nope. I don't think anyone else could have played her.
AmericanHorrorStory,3cgt07,OMGshNicholas,20,Tue Jul 7 21:40:13 2015 UTC,"I think it parallels a lot with who gaga is anyway. The need to be famous. The desire to be on stage and be in the center. It wouldn't have been awful. I'm sure she could have pulled off an accent. The old thing is probably the biggest ""nah"" I could think of."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cgt07,Ey3z0nF1rE,2,Tue Jul 7 20:28:40 2015 UTC,"Yea of course they could pull it off.  But the age thing would have been tough..they would have had to rewrite some things which would've complicated connecting season 2 to season four with the Elsa mars/Hans Gruper storyline.  Also a lot of people are thinking that gaga was brought in to replace Jessica which Ryan has said it isn't like that by any means.  He often Casts whoever he is obsessed with at the time (Levine, lupone, labelle, NPH, bates, bassett, gaga.) but again... I don't think gaga is being brought in to replace Jessica and in my opinion as of right now I think they are planning to use her for this season alone I don't think that she will be on every season as a returning character..I mean we have to be realistic and think about her career and all of the touring/recording/promoting and Publicity she has to do there's no way she could take six months out of every year to do a TV show unless she wants to cross over into that world and put her music stuff aside for a few years!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3cgt07,OMGshNicholas,5,Tue Jul 7 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"Oh most definitely. I 100% don't think she will be on any other season. At all. She's far too busy, and will be having a cd coming out soon(ish)."
AmericanHorrorStory,3cgt07,israeldmo,2,Tue Jul 7 20:37:40 2015 UTC,"Neither do I. It was probably a struggle to get her on AHS. I bet she won't even be able to play a huge character, I think Paulson will play the center character."

AmericanHorrorStory,3cgt07,doomsday1216,6,Wed Jul 8 10:44:20 2015 UTC,"People have been saying it didn't do well, but its not that. It just didn't do as well as her other cd's. I mean, Artpop sold a ton, but it didn't break records like her other music has. Plus she was going through a ton of legal issues during Artpop. But her career is still non-stop. She's been touring forever, she did that sound of music performance on the grammy's, was recently in another movie, going to be on one of the most popular tv shows. Girl is still going strong."

Lana's a lesbian, and I'm sure that--at that time--having a baby seemed an impossibility/taboo.  Or, knowing Lana's personality, having a baby probably wasn't ever in her plans.  She stands at the cusp of having an abortion but there's a shift when she tells the abortionist ""No more death."" That's a sign of her (at least to some extent) experiencing motherhood.

They are given their access IDs and keybadges.  Have a meeting.  They are given a tour of the different sets they will be working on.  Ryan presents his basic vision for the show.  They are given their charActer assignments and start coming up with ideas/creating how they will present their characters, character development and story arcs.  They familiarize the first couple of scripts/episodes.  Ask background questions, etc.  Meet the production crew, film staff, makeup and prop artists, etc.  Basically it's all of the pre production stuff that gets all of the actors on the same page and gives them General knowledge of what Ryan is ""going for"" with this season, while also getting them familiar with who they will be working with wether it be the actors they film with or the make up and wardrobe artists that get them ready to film."

AmericanHorrorStory,3cgcmj,beatlebug23,4,Tue Jul 7 18:19:31 2015 UTC,Now that's a possibility. She doesn't have any projects filming currently according to her IMDb so I don't see why she'd say no if Ryan asked her. There's still time for some last minute announcements I think too. Prays

If you look at Howard in his older days (mid 40s-early 50s) there is a striking resemblence to Denis when in character as stanley with the mustache and slicked back hair.  Id love to see Denis doing Howard Hughes and Evan taking a role that is based on Richard Ramirez, especially with how Ryan said he is going back to the home invasion stuff which scares the shit out of him more than anything he's done on the show.  He actually said that while writing episode 2 of season 1 ""home invasion"" he had to get up and leave the writers rooms a couple times to collect himself.  He said he didn't want to go too much into detail or we would figure it out but based on the context of that I would say it's something related to or based on the Ramirez storylines.  Ryan spoke about how staying in hotels can be very unsettling because you have to sleep there and people have access to your room via room keys or whatever else and I just don't see although it is possible the actual hotel rooms being invaded..I mean I'm sure it will happen once or a couple of times but my money would be on betting that Evan will be camping out in my hotel room stalking guest of the hotel as well as sneaking out at night and breaking into houses and killing innocent victims!"

But the way he keeps talking about this personal phobia of his which he hasn't covered since episode 2 of season 1, home invasion really makes me believe that there will be a heavy emphasis on the richard Ramirez story..being that he was a serial killer known as the night stalker or night prowler who was infamous for going out at night and committing home invasions followed by brutal murders.  He was also a satanist!"

Sorry for some broken english."

At the Emmys in late September, Ryan said Eric would be coming back for just one episode to play a killer who would be sharing scenes with Paulson. This was supposed to be the man who picks Lana up from Thredson's house and kills himself and crashes the car. Ryan never said he would be a ""serial"" killer, and the person he killed would've been himself. This news broke after they had filmed half of the season already; Zach was ALWAYS meant to be Bloody Face."

AmericanHorrorStory,3c3r5h,theahsfan,7,Sat Jul 4 14:07:50 2015 UTC,They always starts around July. They film well into the season. They let the seasons evolve organically while they are filming them. They probably only have the first six or seven scripts completed too.
AmericanHorrorStory,3c3r5h,av1153,2,Sun Jul 5 00:35:22 2015 UTC,I guess that means they'll start writing it on Sunday night!

They've been hyping this show with previews and hints for the last 3 and they're only filming now? Doesn't that mean like another 5 - 8 months before we actually see this show? I guess this is how it always is and I just never noticed because I had the luxury of back to back Netflix episodes and seasons since I came to this show late.
AmericanHorrorStory,3c3r5h,davis98,22,Sat Jul 4 16:30:45 2015 UTC,They usually start filming around this time. It's still being filmed while the season is airing.
AmericanHorrorStory,3c3r5h,DA-numberfour,10,Sat Jul 4 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're correct. Cable & Network Television is different in that you don't need all 13 episodes at the ready. Most shows start production a couple months ahead of their premiere so they have a few episodes ready ahead of time and still have enough time to shoot and edit the rest. This is nothing new and different from other shows. I believe this is what The Walking Dead does.  They've always began production in July so this is no different. Don't worry about it, /u/Mordit"

As far as aliens I don't know if they will be back or not... it's always possible but I don't see how they could tie into the hotel plot  but then again before asylum I couldn't have understood how they would've tied into that either.  And in relation to Jupiter, FL there was also Elsa Mars..i'm not sure if there's any relevance towards foreshadowing in the future or if it's just something Ryan came up with when writing!

AmericanHorrorStory,3bz79a,oStorMx,17,Fri Jul 3 09:59:37 2015 UTC,"I believe it was to do with how different people specifically saw her. Yes she died young, and as we could see from Constance's husband she was mostly just seen as a sex object whilst alive. And after death that is what she's still seen by the men that visit /live in the house. Young and attractive.   The women see her as older because her soul now feels old, weak, and beaten down.   So you'll notice that generally it is only the males in the show that see her as young, attractive, and seductive. With the exception of the gay couple, for obvious reasons. Whereas the women see her older.   TL;DR She isn't older. Females see her as she truly is on the inside. Males just see her appearance as her defining feature."
AmericanHorrorStory,3bz79a,Bedlam_,7,Fri Jul 3 10:55:57 2015 UTC,"Moira doesn't age. She has two appearances, but she doesn't age. None of the ghosts do. Moira's older appearance refers to her ""old soul""/the multi-faceted nature of her character. There's more to her than meets the eye. She's not just a sexy maid. During the course of the show, Moira talks with Vivien about literature and medicine. That's not something that just any maid would know about. Despite being pretty, Moira is also intelligent. Early on in the show, she tells Vivien that women see the true essence of a person, who they really are, and that men just see what's on the outside. The reason Moira has that second appearance is because she's more complicated than most of the female characters on the show. If you look at a lot of the women, their through-lines are pretty easy to follow. Constance wants a picture-perfect family and resents the world for not getting it. Hayden is the scorned mistress. Vivien is the wronged wife. Violet hates everyone and everything. Nora is a stuck-up socialite. None of these ideas are all that complex, so they get that simple characterization, that one ""appearance."" Moira works in shades of gray, which gives her the dual images and looks people see her by. When a person dies in Murder House, their essence/soul is preserved. Usually that includes their appearance. But since Moira was more than just a pretty face, her apparition has more mystery to it."
AmericanHorrorStory,3bz79a,signu1230,2,Fri Jul 3 20:45:06 2015 UTC,That would explain why Elizabeth still looks beautiful: because she wanted to be a Hollywood starlet.
AmericanHorrorStory,3bz79a,ness1215,5,Sun Jul 5 04:06:25 2015 UTC,"I think the ghosts in the house are perceived how they want to be. Elizabeth has no signs of mutilation, even though her body was cut in half. Vivien doesn't have the belly bump even though that's how she died, and that shit doesn't go away that damn fast. Along with others who want to be seen as ""normal""."
AmericanHorrorStory,3bz79a,TEXASJerome,3,Fri Jul 3 20:19:59 2015 UTC,"Men see her as young and sexy, the same way she looked when she died. Women see other women for who they really are, so the women in AHS see Moira as the way she would look if she was still alive (around the same age as Constance)"
AmericanHorrorStory,3bz79a,bwood16,3,Fri Jul 3 21:03:17 2015 UTC,"If your asking for the reason why she can change her age, the most predominant theory is that it has to do with the fact that her body is still buried in the backyard. Her body is keeping some part of her still involved in the house, so her spirit ages as the house does. If this is true, then we could also expect Violet and Hayden to age since their bodies are also on the premises."

AmericanHorrorStory,3btjnv,Starlite85,0,Thu Jul 2 20:47:48 2015 UTC,Hasn't it been said that Hotel will be present day? I may be wrong but the home invaders died in 2011.
AmericanHorrorStory,3btjnv,catzzzzzzzzzz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:08:59 2015 UTC,"I know they said it was set in present day,  but we don't know if they mean present day 2015, or present day like this decade.   I mean wouldn't you consider 2011 as present day time frame when speaking about today's society.   It's not like it's the 50's like with freakshow or asylum."
AmericanHorrorStory,3btjnv,Starlite85,4,Fri Jul 3 13:31:07 2015 UTC,why are you apologizing to yourself lol
AmericanHorrorStory,3btjnv,crossdogz,4,Thu Jul 2 05:44:01 2015 UTC,"I think we have all pretty much moved past it. That's probably why you're being down voted. It really doesn't matter anymore, and I highly doubt Ryan would ever consider that scenario if it was a much larger deal. I don't really care for her too much since it had happened. Hitting someone in the face is still domestic violence."
AmericanHorrorStory,3btxpt,sarahpaulsonspiglet,6,Thu Jul 2 03:08:36 2015 UTC,"I've seen the video and its extraordinarily creepy and weird. I think it would be perfect for AHS Hotel! One of the plots in AHS could even be police trying to figure out what happened to her. Supposedly Elisa Lam was taking meds for bipolar disorder- I always thought that AHS could do a really freaky and scary scene depicting someone tripping on drugs, like acid or shrooms. That would freak me out haha"
AmericanHorrorStory,3btxpt,bwood16,2,Thu Jul 2 05:03:37 2015 UTC,I've always found this case to be super interesting and I'm really hoping this is the direction they take.
AmericanHorrorStory,3btxpt,jiggyazalea,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:28:01 2015 UTC,"I would not be surprised in the slightest if AHS Hotel creates a subplot heavily inspired by this creepy story.  Perhaps even as the background 'lore' to establish the creepy reputation that the show's hotel has.  Beyond Elisa Lam's story, however, I do hope they do something epic/scary involving an elevator shaft.  The potential for horror with those is so great!  EDIT: I LOVE your username, OP!  Huge SP fan here ;D"
AmericanHorrorStory,3btxpt,ilovetorunforfun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"That story properly creeped me out when it happened. I've seen most of the weirdness addressed to my satisfaction since, but it doesn't make the case any less disturbing. They might- and actually, probably will- use it as inspiration, but I can't imagine them name-checking something like this when she's still got family out there that would probably feel a little exploited. I remember some episodic TV show not long ago that had a murder-of-the-week that was definitely inspired by Elisa Lam."

AmericanHorrorStory,3btxpt,danielsk1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:52:02 2015 UTC,"This case is super interesting to me. Just to add some insight, many people speculated that she had a queue set up on her blog so I wouldn't look too far into that. Her blog did have some interesting content, though. The Cecil has a really dark past and was residence to some very shady people. I have recently read that it's been shut down, so that's interesting... The issue I see with ahs using her as a story line is that it was a relatively recent event and it just seems insensitive to do that. Something inspired by her? Sure. But I feel like getting too close may get a bit sticky. I'm hoping Hotel does feature something interesting like this, though."
AmericanHorrorStory,3btxpt,catzzzzzzzzzz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:02:42 2015 UTC,"Excellent post! Very well written and informative on the case. Great job.  I would like to add, regarding the fact that she got on the roof without setting off any door alarms. It was investigated by following the direction she went when she left the elevator. They found a window leading onto a fire escape to the roof at the end of that hall. They believe that is how she got onto the roof without setting off the door alarms. So that mystery has been solved.  As for the elevator not working. This too was investigated and they found if you push all the buttons (as she did), this fail safe kicks in and holds the elevator there for some time. Someone actually went to the hotel and tried it. That mystery solved, but brings up another point. If someone was chasing you, wouldn't you want the door alarms to go off? Why climb out a window?  However, another eerie point is they do not know how she got into the water tanks as they are too tall with no way to climb them. At first it was speculated that she climbed the ladder that was leaning on one, and then climbed over to the one she was found in. They then realized the ladder was not there. It actually was left there by workers who were called after she disappeared to investigate a water leak up there. The ladder was not there before then.  Love that you pointed out the Lam-Elisa TB. It has been speculated that the homeless in that area would go into the hotel for a drink and use the bathroom. That they contracted the TB by drinking the water her body was decomposing in. It was all hushed up of course.  From all I have read, she was bipolar, and most likely on a manic. She took this trip kind of spur of the moment. Usually when they are on a manic, they will befriend just about anyone. Very outgoing and friendly. I think she met the wrong person. I'd love to see this mystery solved. I too would also love to see AHS do something with it."

Mary Eunice - the fact that she kept fighting with her inner demon (literally) was what killed it for me  Pepper - her backstory made it 100x sadder  Adeline - She truly was a pretty girl  Myrtle - she was a good person and the fact that she was the only one who saw past Fiona's lies and deceit is what sealed her fate. That sucks.   Ma Petite - nuff said  Maggie - she made amends for her sins and was killed in most brutal way in AHA history....horrible  Judy - she truly turned herself around.

The fact that it can seem fresh while bringing back so many actors is quite the accomplishment!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3btu1u,TheStarsDescent,2,Thu Jul 2 18:02:36 2015 UTC,"Meh. Freakshow definitely did have a lack of substance, but from what we've heard, Hotel is going to be more Asylum-esque. I'm looking forward to the return to more concentrated horror. As for the casting thing- while I agree that I would like to see some more of the veteran actors return, perhaps they casted people who fit the story. Just throwing that out there. Dunno. I'm a bit more concerned about having too big of a cast. It worked in Murder House, for example, because of all the story lines that played into the main story line... but for Freak Show, it messed a lot of stuff up and made it choppy, for lack of a better word. Re: the switching genres thing, I think Scream Queens will take the place of the campy horror show. Hopefully, at least."

AmericanHorrorStory,3bv4en,beatlebug23,6,Thu Jul 2 12:04:53 2015 UTC,"Highly doubt that holds any relevance..but no offense.  Two more theories that may hold a little more water are 1)the hotel may only have 63 rooms, therefore room 64 would be a secret/hidden room and 2) There have also been rumors that Evans character may be loosely based on Howard Hughes.  Howard's penthouse/suite at the Chateau Marmont (which was also an ""Art Deco"" style building like Ryan has confirmed they are replicating for this season's hotel.    Backstory:  Room 64 was a 2 bedroom suite/penthouse used by Howard.  He wouldock himself in the room for months at a time, surviving on chocolate bars.    It has a marble hallway and an enormous wrap-around terrace overlooking the StriP.  Room 64 also backed up to the pool, and was used by Howard so he could spy on the Hollywood starlets in the pool"
AmericanHorrorStory,3bv4en,Ey3z0nF1rE,3,Thu Jul 2 12:57:59 2015 UTC,"I'm loving the ""art deco"" design - I remember seeing recently that the season will be primarily set in present day... but with the mention of art deco design, I'll be shocked if there aren't a lot of flashbacks to the 20s and 30s.  And if the season is, in fact, set in LA... then we'll also get a lot of Old Hollywood which opens the doors to other types of mysteries, tension, and horror.    I was initially skeptical about the setting/theme this year... but the more information that comes out, the more excited I get!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3bv4en,TheStarsDescent,3,Thu Jul 2 18:10:15 2015 UTC,"Yep I agree with you.  But I'm wondering if the hotel they use is going to be an original fictional hotel that Ryan creates himself or if it's going to be an existing hotel with a lot of history behind it.  Especially if they're basing it off of Los Angeles Art Deco style hotels & the  story is tied to LA ...then there are  so many possibilities ..,but the two that really standout to me are the Château Marmont and the hotel Cecil!  Both are structured with that late 20s and early to mid 30s Art Deco style architecture!  And both of those hotels have so much history...The Black Dahlia murder which obviously is related to season one...The girl that died in the water tank(Elisa lam) of hotel Cecil..Richard Ramirez the Nightstalker camped out in the hotel Cecil...Howard Hughes and a lot of early Hollywood stars such as Marlene Dietrich and F Fitzgerald stayed at the C.M and I'm almost positive it's even where John Belushi overdosed and died!  I imagine that Ryan will create a hotel but it will be loosely based off the top three or four hotels & their history within Los Angeles!!  Below I have included a couple pictures of both hotels for those who are not familiar with the ""Art Deco"" style/design.  The Chateau Marmont:  http://imgur.com/vPnA7u0  The Hotel Cecil:  http://imgur.com/t5mWSyX"
AmericanHorrorStory,3bv4en,Ey3z0nF1rE,3,Thu Jul 2 19:27:45 2015 UTC,"I agree!  I think that the hotel will definitely be be influenced/inspired by the hotels mentioned and the stories/mysteries that happened in each one.  And I'm sure that there will be a historical figure (who actually existed) involved at some point as this has been the case in every season so far.    I was really hoping for a 20s/30s time period this season so I'm hopeful that they will do flashbacks.  And if it's set in LA, The Montgomerys could make an appearance.  Hell, if the hotel has a long history, other characters could have checked in and out at some point.  Constance mentions coming to LA with aspirations of being an actress.  Even Elsa Mars could re-appear at some point in her history.  Of course, those last two are contingent on Jessica wanting to reprise either of those roles for an episode.  (Based on her recent statements that back peddle from her being ""done,"" though... I have a feeling she was already offered the opportunity to either reprise a role for an episode OR play someone new and already accepted.  I think she and Murphy are just being coy.)"
AmericanHorrorStory,3bv4en,TheStarsDescent,3,Thu Jul 2 20:07:12 2015 UTC,"I gotta agree with Ya even more this time around.  Everything you said is on point and I like your thought of Jessica & Ryan sneaking around and having a couple tricks up their sleeves.  Since her recently retracted statement like you mentioned, I also believe that she might already have something ""worked out"" with the show.  I mean we could be completely off and she might pop up next season or not at all... or we MIGHT  be going in the wrong direction and who knows ..maybe she shows up for one of the Halloween episodes or maybe even at Christmas time or even the last episode of the season as some people have been theorizing.  (Rumors are floating stating ""jessica will appear in the last episode as the older version of Gaga."" But I highly disagree with that theory and think that it's a little silly ...for one Jessica said IF she does return it would have to be for the right character and knowing how she is in real life and her personality, I don't think she would want to play the ""older version of a Gaga"" to be honest..I think she would only want to play something original that Ryan specifically wrote FOR her..and it wouldn't be logical for her to be the ""older"" version of Gaga as the show is set in present day so there's no way she could be the older version of gaga unless the show drastically fast forwards into the far future lol).  As far as historical figures go...again I agree with you and think that would be a safe bet.   Every season so far they have included some type of historical figure (ie-richard speck/R Franklin; Elizabeth short/back Dhalia, edward moredrake, etc..)at first I was really hoping they would run with the HH holmes stuff but again, the timing of it all wouldn't make sense (unless he is a ghost trapped in the hotel lol).  All I know for sure is that I CANT wait for two more weeks to come around when they're supposed to reveal a good amount of details about ""Hotel"" at the upcoming comic con event!!(I think it takes place on 7/17 but I will have to double check.

""Yeah, we want you to come back and we want to really drive home the fact that you're OLDER than this young pop star that we cast...""  I don't think either side would be down with that LOL.

The interior was Stephen King's inspiration for The Shining, there is even a large black and white photo of real guests enjoying a party in a ballroom that is eerily similar to the final shot with Jack Nicholson. The Biltmore is also often rented out as a set so it might easier to film there since the process is already established.  Biltmore Lobby  p.s. I don't recommend staying there. Sure it's creepy, but the rooms are very run down, noisy, and the staff is exceptionally rude."

AmericanHorrorStory,3bt6as,velmax,2,Wed Jul 1 23:05:07 2015 UTC,Ahhh :) Ok thanks :)
AmericanHorrorStory,3bt6as,anandamidetrip,6,Wed Jul 1 23:05:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like no one has completely explained this, lol. AHS is an anthology series, meaning that every season is completely different then the previous, but they do use the same actors to play different characters. The seasons are Murder House, Asylum, Coven, Freak Show, Hotel (2015)."
AmericanHorrorStory,3bt6as,sammer87,2,Thu Jul 2 00:23:35 2015 UTC,"When the show started, I believe season 1 was a new regular series with multiple seasons taking place at the house (by adding new central characters to following seasons). At the end of the season 1, they announced that each season would be a self-contained story. I'm not sure if they knew this from the beginning, considering the cliffhanger with the little boy, but now it's been changed to where all seasons are connected in some way.  So far they are just little Easter eggs. Nothing big. The little boy could show up in future seasons; some suspect he will in Hotel. As of now though, it's a cliffhanger.   Constance is portrayed by Jessica Lange. In season 2 Jessica plays Sister Jude. She has been the central figure for 4 seasons (usually the antagonist) but she definitely plays a different character for each season."
AmericanHorrorStory,3bt6as,davis98,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"Every episode is a different story, time, and characters. Now, Ryan Murphy has come out and said that all the stories are connected but while the theories are abundant no one knows for sure. As you progress you'll see some connections. But as far as the little boy and Constance, well she probably raised him and helped him along with his ""devilish"" ways."

AmericanHorrorStory,3bt4wu,PeterPanoKing,7,Thu Jul 2 20:04:20 2015 UTC,Laverne could easily pull a role in AHS.  Caitlyn though...She doesn't have an acting experience at all. So nope.

AmericanHorrorStory,3bt4wu,Supreme000,0,Thu Jul 2 18:13:02 2015 UTC,"Enough already. I'm so tired of hearing how Caitlyn looks like Lange. No, she don't. I believe Jenner was going for the Julia Roberts look, because she even sang the song ""Pretty Woman"", in her interview with Diane Sawyer. Lange basically made this show what it is by playing such strong roles flawlessly. Now she is gone, so let's just leave her up there on that pedestal where she belongs. Stop trying to compare her to Jenner.  I applaud Jenner, but let's be honest here. She did not do this with ""courage"", like most transgenders have to. No, she did it while disguised as a married man. I can remember the Kardashian family photos, where people said Bruce needed to lay off the plastic surgery because he was starting to look like a woman. Who knew he was trying to look like a woman. Courage would have been had she come out and admitted it back then. The most of the transition was done while hiding behind his wife and kids, and being thought to just be addicted to plastic surgery like the Kardashians. Let's not even get started on the Kardashian family, which does reflect on Caitlyn. That's the truth. This was not done with bravery and courage like most transgenders DO have. Nor do most transgenders have the money Caitlyn has to transition so well with plastic surgery and top make-up, hair and fashion artists.  When I heard Ryan said he may put Caitlyn in AHS, I had enough already. I have so admired how Ryan has brought on great gay and lesbian actors. Actors who achieved their status by their acting abilities. Their talent and skill in acting, not sensationalism. They reflect a positive onto the gay and lesbian community. I did not even know Amazon Eve was transgendered until after the season. When I found out, all I could say was, ""Wow, she is a good actress"". That's the way it should be. That is what changes minds in a positive way. Not this sensationalism.  So enough of the sensationalism. Ryan is trying to turn the show into the most flamboyant float in the Gay Pride Parade. That does not reflect the LBGT community well. It makes a joke of them. Keep the show at good acting and good story writing. That's what made it what it is....."
AmericanHorrorStory,3bt69e,anandamidetrip,3,Wed Jul 1 23:03:42 2015 UTC,omg that would have been great monster mash has sorta that old timey jukebox rock and roll feel i think i would have been fine if jimmy sung a man who sold the world as the nirvana piece because its another david bowie peace the other songs didnt seem to out of place for the time period but come as you are defiantly did
AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,nativveson,16,Mon Jun 29 18:49:32 2015 UTC,"It is always very possible.  I would love to see her reprise Constance and hopefully that would go back a bit and tie up the Michael Langdon/antichrist storyline to hotel..i've been saying for a few months now that that would be the absolute shit!!  Let's all keep our fingers crossed because with her saying she would be willing to come back for smaller appearances, it would definitely make sense for her to take back on a roll such as Constance!  And yes we are aware of this season being filmed in Los Angeles although they have not yet announced where the story will actually take place..I would imagine and have personally been thinking that they are going back to Los Angeles not just for filming but for the story as well...which would be another puzzle piece for connecting season one to season five.  But. On top of all of that there was a post a couple months back about somebody who drove by the actual Rosenheim Mansion (the murderhouse) well at that time, the house was for sale (I think it has been purchased since then) but this person claimed that there was some type of letter or sign on the property stating that it was soon going to be used for some type of movie or television show...so I am really hoping that it is reprising it's legacy as the murderhouse instead of being the Rosenheim mansion or whatever it was called when it was used as the frat house in Buffy the Vanpire Slayer!!"

AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,Ey3z0nF1rE,6,Wed Jul 1 04:39:25 2015 UTC,I hope not.
AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,rathebold,2,Tue Jun 30 12:59:44 2015 UTC,Highly doubt it. The talk of her returning in future will probably be after season 5. She's flat out said no to season 5 and they won't want to overshadow all the new talent they've got in by having her return.  Also she's said in interviews she would never play Constance again. So there's that too.
AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,AlfieBoheme,5,Wed Jul 1 05:43:23 2015 UTC,"No, they made a pretty big deal about freak show being her last season."
AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,squidperior,15,Mon Jun 29 23:28:34 2015 UTC,They could always just get Caitlin Jenner. No one will know the difference
AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,Arbitrary_Cleverness,-4,Tue Jun 30 10:28:26 2015 UTC,I don't know anyone who would confuse the two.
AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,squidperior,4,Tue Jun 30 18:38:03 2015 UTC,"It being filmed in los angeles is not a fact worth looking into. Being shot somewhere and taking place somewhere are very different. Theres a lot of speculation going around right now. Sure, she could. But we have no real evidence that points to that aside from hopeful fan theories and stretches of possibilities."
AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,doomsday1216,7,Mon Jun 29 19:29:28 2015 UTC,"Being shot somewhere and taking place somewhere are very different   Exactly. Freak Show took place in Jupiter, Florida but was filmed in New Orleans, Louisiana."
AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,Gliiitterpop,2,Mon Jun 29 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"Coven  and Freakshow were both shot and filmed in New Orleans although only one took place there.  Murderhouse and hotel obviously are Los Angeles..and asylum was filmed between Los Angeles and Boston.  I'm not saying that hotel will take place in LA just because it's being filmed there..however Ryan did recently mention that while writing the premise for hotel he was mainly researching the horror stories of old downtown LA hotels.  Which again, may or may not mean anything.  But with the filming location, his and the other writers/creators statements regarding LA, the LA hotel(s) references in freakshow, as well as Sarah Paulson flat out and downright saying that season 5 is ""linked to Los Angeles,  at this point, if I were a betting man using context clues, my number 1 guess would have to be LA.  However, I would really like to see a midwest city as the location at some point.  Maybe St. Louis, Chicago...or my biased favorite, Indianapolis (me and Ryan Murpheys hometown!)  I wonder why they are waiting so long to announce the location for the setting?  My guess is to build the season up as much as possible and to keep the fans speculating and theorizing.  Another reason, is because if it is something obvious, like say Chicago..people would most likely Automatically figure out it would be HH holmes and the murder castle. (Not literally..obviously as a hotel is very different than Holmes murder castle..im just using that as an example..if one particular city is famous or infamous for one major hOtel incident, the location mAy give it away.)"
AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,Ey3z0nF1rE,3,Mon Jun 29 21:55:01 2015 UTC,"True, but the initial reports about the filming location and Sarah's interview with The Wrap suggest that the story will be somewhat linked to LA. Maybe not necessarily take place there, but LA is involved somehow."
AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,ahsfreakshow,2,Mon Jun 29 20:36:30 2015 UTC,"And again, yes it's a hopeful fan theory that she returns.  But saying there is no real evidence is a little off.  Ryan repeatedly said at the end of FREAKSHOW he was going to do any and everything in his power to keep Jessica around and to create characters for her that she likes.  She stated that she at first was flat out done after season 4, but towards the end of it she told Ryan ""let's keep talking.""  She then again changed her mind and called it quits.  Ryan then tweeted ""thank you jessica...thanks for everything"" and said in interviews she would still always be welcome to come back in the future.  She wanted to take a break from acting and focus on photography as well as her grandchildren.  But now, she is starring in a play, being directed by Ryan Murphey, and within the last week she has said that ""if Ryan had a small role for just a couple of episodes and a character I really like, then yes I would absolutely love to come back.""  So with knowing she has said she is willing to come back if offered the right character..she loves the characters Ryan creates for her..and Ryan has always said she is always welcome and apart of the AHS family..it would be safe to say it is more evident than not evident she will be back at some point in the future seasons to come.  Maybe not as Constance, but if Ryan tried to include her in this season, which IS somehow tied to LA..Nd the seasons are being connected now..this season would most likely be the best bet to bring her back as Constance like he did with Lily Rabe and Sister Mary EUNICE in FreaKshow.  (Which she wasn't announced to be returning as her season 2 character, until after the show had already premiered if I remember correctly) PLUS it doesn't hurt to dream:D"

AmericanHorrorStory,3bjgb7,theahsfan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:19:42 2015 UTC,"No, she won't be. Jessica Lange has made it very clear that she would come back only if she was presented with a fresh and Titillating role.   She has also said numerous times that she enjoys playing new characters and that is what initially drew her into the franchise and kept her coming back.   Rehashing an old character runs contrary to what she has established is her interests in regards to AHS."

No there’s no supernatural element…well a little bit. ""It’s very much in that Asylum world."" There’s no sort of Elizabeth Montgomery/Bewitched stuff going on. This season, once you die, you’re dead. There’s no supernatural thing to bring you back like last year. It’s just completely new. It feels completely new. I’m shooting it in a different style. It sounds different.  So he didn't quite say that it's going to be dark like asylum or even darker than it but he did say that as far as the horror element it would be more psychological horror rather than supernatural for in the same way that asylum was!"

AmericanHorrorStory,3b9rvi,Doctor_Arkham,12,Sat Jun 27 06:26:57 2015 UTC,Wait..what? There have been 4 seasons. Meaning that we can't have had 3 in the present and 2 in the past. How would we be due a season in the past?

AmericanHorrorStory,3b7vn1,BlkWhiteSupremecist,28,Fri Jun 26 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"The aliens were used for two purposes.  The first being that Kit and Alma Walker were based off real life couple BArney and Bettey Hill.  A 1960s interracial couple who claim they had an experience/were abducted by aliens.  The writers of the show wrote the aliens into the script because of the time setting and era.  The mid 1960s was the first time that people really started claiming to have UFO/abductions/ET experiences.  The second reason they were used was to compliment the underlying theme of the show.  Ryan always writes an underlying theme into the show that is something that is close to his heart and touching to him.  You will notice from season to season he constantly focuses on things like infidelity, oppression, racism, gay and lesbian sexuality rights, etc.  One of asylums main themes was ""science vs faith."" The aliens in that case, are an obvious metaphor for God.  They fit very easily inti the world of a Catholic sanitarium asylum.  If you think about it the aliens were the closest thing to Angels on the show.  They were super advanced and had the ability to capture and ""correct"" people or ""fine-tune"" them to the way they wanted them.   You can read more about the aliens here.  This is a look at the shows creators/writers talking directly about the use of the aliens and why they were added into the show.  http://www.blastr.com/2013-10-3/american-horror-story-producers-finally-explain-what-was-aliens"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b7vn1,Ey3z0nF1rE,6,Fri Jun 26 19:48:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I didn't realize that they were based off of real people. I realized that the UFO/alien theme fit in with the '60s, but I didn't see any plot purpose. I picked up on a few other real life cases besides the  Columbine shooting/Josef Mengele inspirations, but I can't remember any specific ones. Perfect answer though, thank you."

I was certain that she was going to be the secret big villain in Freakshow because her acting felt kind of fake, like she was hiding true bitchiness. I've only seen her in one other movie (It's Kind of a Funny Story) and I felt the same way. Buuuuut I think she's awesome as bitch characters. It makes me wonder if maybe she's just super mean in real life so that's all she can play convincingly."
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,mamzellepeepee,-1,Thu Jun 25 18:42:46 2015 UTC,She is supposed to be a birch in real life though wasn't there some domestic abuse scandal there a while back where she was beating the bf or something

AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,HazyVision,5,Thu Jun 25 14:33:27 2015 UTC,Yes.  About a month ago Emma was doing an interview about scream Queens and was asked about her involvement with season five American horror story and she said at that point she was talking to Ryan about possibly doing the end of hotel --maybe the last couple episodes or something along them lines -..and apparently her wishes coming true.  But here is also  a second source...  http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Emma-Roberts-Joins-Cast-of-AMERICAN-HORROR-STORY-HOTEL-20150625
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,xxxlostprophecy,3,Thu Jun 25 14:50:04 2015 UTC,Nice! I only asked because I'm a part of an brazilian AHS fan page. I have always to check things like this before sharing xD
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,gaarasgourd,4,Thu Jun 25 14:53:42 2015 UTC,No problem at all and I agree that it is always in our best bet to double check the sources when it comes to this show in particular I pretty much don't believe anything I hear about the show or even read about it unless it has come straight from Ryan Murphey hinself!!)
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,Imogens,87,Thu Jun 25 15:13:02 2015 UTC,"If this is true, it's super unfortunate because I am really excited for this season and she is pretty much the worst, no matter how small her role."
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,squigglecakes,30,Thu Jun 25 14:40:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, unfortunately its true :/  I know that Evan and Emma recently called off of their wedding and engagement plans...i'm really hoping that Evan gets to do something like decapitate Emma or give her some other insanely sadistic and cruel death!! lol"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,Imogens,33,Thu Jun 25 14:45:56 2015 UTC,"They have the worst on-camera chemistry, which is odd because they are/were a real couple lol"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,Violetly,15,Thu Jun 25 19:45:16 2015 UTC,"Reportedly a terrible couple though, weren't there rumours that they were constantly arguing on set?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,Violetly,18,Thu Jun 25 20:03:26 2015 UTC,I think she was physically abusive or something? I vaguely remember reading an article about it many moons ago
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,janna_,12,Fri Jun 26 01:00:05 2015 UTC,They had a fight and she was arrested for DV I believe but Evan Peters chose not to press charges. It just sounds like a volatile relationship all round.
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,AlfieBoheme,6,Fri Jun 26 01:01:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, apparently they were constantly either making out or fighting. And they had an altercation in a hotel room, in which she gave him a bloody nose and a bite mark, but he declined to press charges."
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,ahsfreakshow,15,Fri Jun 26 01:45:08 2015 UTC,Did they call it off because she's violent and abusive?
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,AlfieBoheme,14,Thu Jun 25 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"Ever since Evan Peters and Emma Roberts became involved and she's been on the show, she's ALWAYS somehow connected to his character, usually romantically. The creators try to shove her and Evan down our throats because they're involved romantically in real life. Creatively, they shouldn't be. I liked Taissa and Evan's on-set chemistry, and I think the creators should experiment with that more than what they half-heartedly gave us in Coven. Stop trying to sell me on Emma, the only character she can actually act in is the bitch character I'm supposed to hate!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,AlfieBoheme,4,Fri Jun 26 01:43:47 2015 UTC,"Well I was hoping that since emma and evan are now split they wouldn't tie the two of them together this season..but Ryan confirmed that emma will ""be back at the end involving a storyline with evan"""

AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,AlfieBoheme,11,Thu Jun 25 17:47:30 2015 UTC,"You're not alone, I think she's great. What would make it even better is if her Hotel character gets to interact with Denis' again, those two work so well together."
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,planethorror,2,Thu Jun 25 18:45:04 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree, though I've never been a huge fan of O'hare. As much as people deride her, I honestly think Maggie was one of the best parts in Freakshow. I just think the writing wasn't amazing (like most of that season) and people seem to blame her for her characters problems"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,iamcarlbarker,3,Thu Jun 25 19:24:58 2015 UTC,"I felt like her storyline was rushed and that they truly Didn't know what direction they wanted to go in with her..so at the very end when they brought in Chester they just killed her off as part of his character development..I was still thinking up until that episode that her and Jimmy were going to somehow work things out and eventually ""get away"" from the troupe."
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,NotKateBush,8,Thu Jun 25 22:29:36 2015 UTC,"I felt her death served the point of her storyline. While the Freaks were the protagonists, if we look at what they do they really are no better than anyone else. Like the townspeople discriminate against the Freaks, they discriminate against non freaks. They never truly accept Penny until her transformation, and never accept Maggie at all. The brutality of her death (one of the goriest and most painful to watch in AHS history)  emphasises this, as does the fact its a performance with others watching.   Maggie agrees to perform in the magic act as the Freaks are really the closest thing to a family she has ever had. Knowing she can never truly be a freak, her one feature she can use to be useful is her beauty as the magicians assistant. The Freaks watch as she dies, never attempting to stop Chester despite Maggies slow death. Her death embodies her character arc. She attempts to redeem herself but can never truly gain acceptance as she's not a freak."

AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,unicorns69ng,12,Fri Jun 26 01:44:01 2015 UTC,Nooooo. Hopefully she doesn't get much screen time.
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,violetgranger,8,Thu Jun 25 16:59:14 2015 UTC,"Guys who make fun of Emma for ""always playing a bitch"" might as well take a stab at Taissa for always playing a meek and awkward girl or Gabourey for playing a sassy but strong willed character."
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2q20,flamingpaulie,2,Thu Jun 25 23:36:36 2015 UTC,Gabby's character wasn't sassy in Freak Show.

AmericanHorrorStory,3b4k69,morpheusmade,3,Thu Jun 25 22:28:52 2015 UTC,"Also after thought, season 4 there is a fake marriage.  Another after thought on this season explains why so many of the male actors are gay, while being gay itself isn't a sin, denial of this attribute of yourself by presenting yourself as heterosexual is a type of fraud that (according to my theory of Ryan Murphy's universe) could land you in this particular circle of hell"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b4k69,Ey3z0nF1rE,3,Thu Jun 25 22:39:16 2015 UTC,"I've looked into the Dantes inferno Theory and just about all of the other theories when I heard the seasons were connected..but honestly I don't think it's going to be as deep as people are looking into it.  (Just my opinion of course.) I think it's going to be just like it was on Freakshow and how it tied into Asylum with the Gruper and Pepper connection.  I think a lot of people are expecting something huge to be revealed that when you look back on it at its end, it all ties together In some crazy ""outside of the box"" way..but honestly I think Ryan will just continue to throw in a connection or flashback from a previous season to tie it to that present season.  Also you talk about the asylum aliens and how they were treated on the show as divine..that's because they were!  Ryan said the aliens on the show were literally his interpretation of God in that universe!!  Also, I agree with you that Elsa was very self-centered and very much out to take care of herself and fulfill her destiny..but I also think that she really WAS the protector of her family and she genuinely did love her monsters and it wasn't just a masquerade as you say...things just didn't work out in the end because of her past coming back to haunt her but at the end of the day she absolutely loved and adored her freaks!!!    You also have some valid points as far as the underlying themes of each season but IMO I would say that the underlying themes Ryan mainly tried to touch on each year were as follows:  Murserhouse-Infidelity.  One single act of infidelity, literally ruins the lives of an entire family.  Not to mention the countless other times this season shows acts of infidelity..Constance/moira/Constance's husband..lArry harvey..old and young moira..tate..Chad and patrick...Travis wanderly, etc.  Asylum-Sanity.  Pushing the limits of the human brain and mind.  Cruel experiments, etc.  Pretty much everything on the show was bending the human mind in a way that was either ""make or break.""  The second underlying theme was definitely ""science VS religion"" and that came straight from Ryans mouth.  Coven-Oppression.  Specifically, the oppression of marginalized groups and female empowerment.   Freakshow-Discrimination, particularly people who are classified as ""freaks"" by the public.   Each season had a different, yet very relative underlying theme at least in a way that presents a harsh reality of how human beings can have a very negative side..especially with Opression/racism/sexuality/discrimination and the judgment of it all from anybody who was considered ""outside the norm"" and I love how the show stayed true to each specific time setting and the era it took place in!  Just my two cents of it all"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b4k69,happyclownbot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:27:41 2015 UTC,"I really like what you are saying, a lot of valid points for sure. I am a hopeless idealist so I'm always going to root for a bigger cohesiveness and arching theme, more than the show probably merits... Now with that said, and taking your counter-points into account, I still think both are reconcilable. Elsa does love her freaks, in fact most of the characters do feel love and like emotions for eachother, but in Dante's Inferno the corruption of love is what creates these circles of hell. According to the epic, Gods love is perfect and without sin, but because mans flesh is tainted so too can our love be. Each layer of hell is designed for a specific type of that corruption.   While infidelity is a major part of season 1, infidelity is only commited by the lustful. Lust as defined within the Middle Ages poem, isn't when someone doesn't love, but rather when they have an excess of physical love.   And within each season, even if the themes are more interconnected and complex, the initial event that triggers all that is to come within the season is a single act. Season 1- the abortions of the unwed. Season 2- Divine intervention is unbelieved by those who supposedly believe in such miracles. 3- first hypothesis- Salem witches betraying their sisters who are accused. Second hypothesis- Young Fiona betraying the supreme and killing her. 4- A clown is falsely accused of pedophilia (but he never actually was accused, the carnies simply decieve him. Dante says this circle of hell is reserved for liars as well as frauds)   For season 3 race relations and female empowerment are big arches without a doubt, but couldn't it be said that man betrayed himself when enslaving his own kind? -I know I'm grasping at straws- but even madam lalaurie, who at first I thought was only betrayed at the end, was first betrayed when given a potion she believed would give her beauty and youth. Ryan Murphy could have just as easily had the potion slipped into her food by a slave working for the voodoo clan. Instead he chose to have her be betrayed. The same is said for the Minotaur man, betrayed by his lover and his owner.   I think you are correct with the aliens from season to being an actual metaphor for God. When you replace the alien story Kit tells with the word God, the disbelief exhibited by all in the asylum takes on an incredibly blasphemous tone. The only people who believe him are redeemed from the asylum in the end. And even though the events aren't related to the aliens, their 'faith' in his story does help them.  I also aggree asylum deals with religion vs. science. But it's not science like penicillin or curing cancer. The type of science done is unnatural and twisted. The children born from the aliens are also scientists, but of a completely different kind. I think this may actually enhance the concept from the Divine Comedy.  All of these circles of hell have very similar qualities. But I think Ryan Murphy does a good job making a distinction between them. If season 3 is about treachery, then why aren't the events of season 4 about treachery? Clearly there is still lying and betrayal in both. But season 3 they must trust eachother and can't. In fact the circle of hell for treachery is called judecca after Judas. Cordelia is betrayed by her husband and he kisses her. Season 4 they love eachother, but not enough to be honest with them. They lie and Deceive to make ends meet. They misrepresent themselves. They hide, they don't actively seek destruction, but in avoiding truth find it.  I really like your ideas, it's fun being able to bounce ideas around. Hope you know I don't disagree with what your saying, I just like discussing them and even if I'm way off base, we both have insight into a type of thinking we didn't have before 😁"

AmericanHorrorStory,3b2wri,anandamidetrip,5,Sat Jun 27 00:58:10 2015 UTC,I really hope some of the actors/actresses are only in a couple of episodes. It would be nice to see a season without such a bloated main cast.          Especially since in a hotel setting it would make sense to have certain characters check in and only stay around for a few episodes.
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2wri,etv123,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:53:10 2015 UTC,"True.  I don't think Greenfield or Roberts will be around for long..but Ya never know.  Right now it's looking like the show is going to feature (as of now) Two main storylines:  1)Gaga/Bomer/Wittrock triangle with Gaga and Bassett clashing somehow.  2)Peters/Paulson being villains, victimizing the people of the hotel. (I have a feeling Bates and Ohare will also be involved with this storyline)  I am really quite curious how Bentley, Jackson and sevigny sill tie into the show!!  Will Detective Jack Colquitt appear this season?  Or maybe one of the Goodmans?!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2wri,ilovetorunforfun,4,Thu Jun 25 22:56:53 2015 UTC,And a maybe for Jessica Lange!  I hope so. I hope so soooooooo much.
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2wri,Horrified101,3,Thu Jun 25 21:14:10 2015 UTC,"Most excited for this weird love triangle and ""the baddest bad girl of them all"". :D"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2wri,helltothenoyo,4,Thu Jun 25 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"Im definitely excited to see Peters as a villain again.  Im also very anxious to see what Sarah does with her role as well..in my opinion she is a great actress and I can't wait to see how she presents herself as a villain this year!!  I'm also curious about Cheyenne Jackson and why his role is being kept So secretive...he said he is not even allowed to tell his own mother any of the details about his character!'  They are also keeping bentley and Sevignys roles on the DL quite a bit too, so naturally, that has so been drawing people's curiosity as well!!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2wri,weavves,2,Thu Jun 25 17:43:39 2015 UTC,I read somewhere that Bentley's role is going to be really important in the show

AmericanHorrorStory,3b2wri,fightmefgt,2,Thu Jul 2 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"Is O'Hare officially confirmed now? I remember he jumped the gun in talking about it.  He's persistently my favourite male cast member in each of his seasons (and one of the best parts of Coven), so I'm really hoping to see him again."
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2wri,Rivley,3,Sat Jun 27 18:11:39 2015 UTC,Yes he is confirmed!!
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2wri,Khaleesimom,2,Sat Jun 27 20:32:19 2015 UTC,Darn still no Lily Rabe. I am still hoping!
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2wri,theahsfan,2,Tue Jun 30 14:26:16 2015 UTC,a man can dream
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,whokilledmurph,42,Wed Jun 24 20:53:29 2015 UTC,i think if there was ever going to be a show for her this is it - shes a performance atrists and im hoping and preying she brings something new and interesting to the show and it translates
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,chloetee,5,Wed Jun 24 21:08:39 2015 UTC,"And if a bunch of fans come galloping along with her, all the better, no?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,ratbastid,6,Thu Jun 25 15:40:46 2015 UTC,yeah the more people interested in the show the less likely it is to get cancelled :)
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,chloetee,16,Thu Jun 25 16:30:50 2015 UTC,"As you said, she hasn't acted much so I'm not sure of how she'll do it. I am just worried because I don't want the season to become Lady Gaga's season. I mean, she's a big pop star so they will give her a big part and a lot of screen time, and I'm okay with that. And I think that she'll be good, I trust Ryan Murphy. But I don't want them to be more centered in Lady Gaga's part than in the story itself. I mean, I don't want the season to be just like ""let's watch Lady Gaga do stuff!!"". I hope this season's story is as good as the others.  (Sorry if I didn't explain myself clearly enough, english is not my first language and I struggle with it)"
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,paulasol,6,Wed Jun 24 23:07:19 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this.   And by the way your English is fine, really good in fact- better than a lot of natives I know!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,shitsnacksandcracker,4,Thu Jun 25 09:24:51 2015 UTC,"Same here! If she can legitimately add something to the show/story line then I say welcome to the family! The only thing I'm afraid of is it becoming an extension of her already flamboyant career. I really don't want it to turn into the ""Lady Gaga Weirdness Hour""."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Echo5582,2,Thu Jun 25 11:20:21 2015 UTC,Her cameos in Machete Kills and Sin City were atrocious! I just hope she got tons of help from coaches and such for this season.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,cosmicpizza666,15,Sun Jun 28 01:52:53 2015 UTC,If she got a main role I certainly hope she has the acting to back it up.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Foot_Fetish_Fred,23,Wed Jun 24 21:04:41 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think she's going to fuck this up.   She's amazingly talented and I have faith that she'll be a good actress. I think she's perfect for the show.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Sydviciouz,6,Wed Jun 24 22:39:25 2015 UTC,She was a theater major
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,KatzVlad,4,Thu Jun 25 13:20:47 2015 UTC,"I think that we just need to have faith that Ryan Murphy wouldn't cast a pop star who can't act in this show.  The show is pretty notorious for it's amazing acting - putting someone who can't hold a light to Sarah, Kathy, Angela, Dennis, etc would be suicide, not just for the show, but for the pop star's career."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,TheStarsDescent,9,Thu Jun 25 15:31:50 2015 UTC,"I like her music (most of it) yet I'm not a fanatic, what I think she will contribute to the show is the visual effects; wherever is she or her designers but she does have a really interesting creepy persona and I think that her style can be easily integrated into our favorite horror show; personally I'm relieved that there is no musical numbers this year, and counting that Lady Gaga will be able to do anything I think it will be an awesome season."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,danielsk1,27,Wed Jun 24 21:05:12 2015 UTC,She studied at Tisch School of Fine Arts in NYC. They specialize in both acting and music. I'm confident in her acting abilities. Especially if you've seen her music videos.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,EraticA,8,Wed Jun 24 22:30:20 2015 UTC,She also acts really well in the music video for Marry the Night.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Horrified101,-1,Wed Jun 24 23:09:54 2015 UTC,"Well the only major there that would train her in both is musical theatre,  which I don't believe she majored in."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,kylepierce11,7,Thu Jun 25 03:08:09 2015 UTC,That's true. But still. You don't get into Tisch as a High School student early admit just by accident. I'm pretty sure you have audition for both.  I used to stan for her pretty hard.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,EraticA,1 point,Thu Jun 25 08:04:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have to have a good audition and academic record to get into any program at tisch."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,MikiClash,2,Thu Jun 25 11:56:18 2015 UTC,"Recent Tisch grad here (she actually lived in my freshman dorm). It's very likely she majored in Drama at Tisch. All drama students take acting and theatre studies, and there are specific ""studios"" you are put in that emphasize different skills or acting techniques. She might have been in the studio that trains for musical theatre."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,MikiClash,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:52:12 2015 UTC,"Huh, I'm looking all over google to see what her major was there but can't find it. Only finding that she dropped out.   I wasn't trying to be negative or aggressive, just genuinely curious because I'm in a Musical Theatre BFA program right now."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,kylepierce11,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:51:03 2015 UTC,"Of course! No problem. :) was hoping I could shed some light. And yeah, i remember hearing that she dropped out also."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,MikiClash,28,Tue Jun 30 02:21:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly we don't know very much about Hotel, but I'm excited because I believe she is a good actor. Most of her videos are basically short films, and she does great in them."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,davis98,3,Tue Jun 30 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"As true as that may be, you get no insight into her actual abilities in regards to dialogue or really anything but facial expressions and general body language. There are plenty of actors with well directed music videos who are ass at actual acting. Just saying. I have no expectations in either direction"
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,doomsday1216,5,Wed Jun 24 21:38:30 2015 UTC,She was a theatre major before she was anything so we should be fine.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,owlsareahoot91,5,Thu Jun 25 11:33:49 2015 UTC,"See, that's cool, I didn't know that. This is why I'm staying neutral, because I don't know shit about her. I will let her performance speak for itself.   Besides if it's true there won't be musical numbers I'll be on cloud nine."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,doomsday1216,5,Thu Jun 25 12:17:34 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of people defending Gaga here, but it seems like your question was more 'why are people so defensive,' not 'why is Gaga going to be good.'  In answer to that question, there is a trend with a lot of people to hate on pop stars, because there's a stereotype that pop stars (especially female ones) are derivative, stupid, and untalented people who are only famous because of X (pretty, shock factor, etc.)  However, these women are very talented and work very hard.  They do appeal to specific audiences, and not everyone is a part of that audience, but that doesn't mean they are incapable of doing other things as they're frequently accused of.  With that history in mind, sometimes fans can get very defensive very quickly when someone they're a fan of branches out to a different audience; because there's a long history of people's work being spoiled before it even starts by this kind of thinking."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,LSunday,9,Thu Jun 25 12:28:31 2015 UTC,"I've always loved the concept of Gaga, not as a Little Monster who can see nothing wrong in her, but i admire that every time she appears in public, she is in character. She is the same when performing on stage and when walking down the street been chased by a paparazzi or in the airport catching a flight. Lady Gaga is a character and she never let us see the person playing it. Even if she is dressed down to wear glamour designer gowns she never loses her Gaga persona.  If she is talented enough to live in a constant performance i trust her to pull this off. Don't be surprised to see her winning an Emmy or a Golden Globe for this.   That said, do not expect she will be Jessica Lange 2.0 because she is not. This will be something completely different but amazing by itself."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,kinkuagesimo,5,Fri Jun 26 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"As a huge fan of American Horror Story, I am incredibly excited for her performance in the show, and I think it will become an iconic television performance, very post-modern and unique. I can totally see this as a natural progression for both the show, and for her career. Can't wait to see what happens, I bet it'll be psycho."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,yung9tales,8,Thu Jun 25 13:19:48 2015 UTC,"I was worried up until yesterday when I heard that Ryan Murphy said there would be no musical numbers and it would feature an ensemble cast. I could do without her on the show honestly, but I'm curious to see how she will do.  When the show started out, it was excellent, serious and compelling television; I'm worried that the addition of Lady Gaga will draw in a crowd of people that don't like ""good"" tv shows, but instead like popular tv shows."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,bwood16,3,Thu Jun 25 04:42:12 2015 UTC,"I'm worried because it seems that the rule is she can either only be amazing or downright terrible. I think she will be decent, but because that's not good enough to be amazing, it has to be terrible. Some people are just too hardheaded to get over it."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,LoganK36,8,Thu Jun 25 00:18:11 2015 UTC,"I don't really know if Lady Gaga would do well on American Horror Story. All I know of her is that she is a singer, and I don't give a shit about music.   I sort of hope that her role would be small."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Spookychilies,5,Thu Jun 25 06:32:08 2015 UTC,I agree with you (although I like music but don't follow her). Don't know why you were down-voted. I am indifferent to her personally. I hope the show doesn't revolve around her. She should be an equal character and I hope not the star.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,sungenie,2,Thu Jun 25 01:30:45 2015 UTC,"I recall Murphy stating that they're going back to a more ""ensemble"" plot where there isn't a specific lead. I think it was in the same article where he said there wouldn't be musical numbers.  So I'd say that Gaga is going to be on an equal playing field with the other actors/characters."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,TheStarsDescent,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:30:18 2015 UTC,"Haha. I am deaf, so I don't find music enjoyable when I can hear it. :-P Most of the times songs are like fingernails to a chalkboard for me.   Anyways, I agree. I can't really see Lady Gaga being a great actor, but I noticed that most singers can't act, so that's probably why I feel that way about her."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Spookychilies,5,Thu Jun 25 15:37:17 2015 UTC,Im fine with her being on the show I'm just a little worried that they will focus on her way more than the other cast
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,tree71,2,Thu Jun 25 05:32:29 2015 UTC,"^ This.  While I don't doubt she's got some acting chops, I'm hoping that she's not the focal point of the season.  Though from RM's recent interview, it sounds like Hotel's main protagonists will be male."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,ilovetorunforfun,3,Wed Jun 24 23:37:31 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it was in that same interview that Murphy stated that they're going back to a more ""ensemble"" plot this season.

AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,TheStarsDescent,5,Thu Jun 25 14:10:08 2015 UTC,I feel like Ryan wouldn't just cast her on a whim. She must have had some sort of audition process. I enjoy her music but don't listen to it on a regular basis.   Can't wait to start getting some teasers!
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,asiankim,5,Thu Jun 25 15:38:22 2015 UTC,"I don't know why some folks are defensive about her involvement as far as her performance will go. Clearly, she's able to act and I suspect she will do fine.  However, you brought up the Little Monsters. I know nothing of them and am a bit wary of the unknown. It's reasonable to expect them to come here and show up during the weekly threads. Will they be awesome additions or will they represent of mire of comments only about her?  There has been some wonderful, thoughtful discussion inspired by the show in this sub. Every season has come with real world topics that deserve reflection. That's what happens when a show is so loved. Will the Little Monsters love AHS enough to contribute or will they love Lady Gaga so much that they bury the rest of the discussion?  I don't know how big that fan base is or how they typically behave. For all I know, they could already have been here since go. But it is a concern. The sub is going to change due to her involvement if the fanbase is avid and big. I do have a little apprehension about how the two communities will get along and if they will merge well."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Imnother,5,Thu Jun 25 00:54:10 2015 UTC,"If the Little Monsters were to start flooding this sub by only glorifying Gaga and not contributing any real discussion regarding the show, themes, etc... we can gently suggest that they move their Gaga discussions to a more appropriate sub dedicated to Gaga and mention that this sub is more directed towards discussion of the show (and its themes)."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,TheStarsDescent,5,Thu Jun 25 06:11:52 2015 UTC,I agree that being gentle if there is an issue is apropos. And who knows? They may be great.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Imnother,6,Thu Jun 25 15:35:32 2015 UTC,"Like any fandom, some of them can be rather fanatical and rabid... I mean, we have those people in this sub, don't we?  ;-)  If those types of ""Little Monsters"" appear, we'll just have to deal with them as gently as we can.  I often lurk this sub without commenting (as I do in many subs for the things I love) - but I appreciate this one because of the wonderful discussions that are had regarding themes, relation to real life, etc.  I like that, for the most part, when there is a disagreement on something it's usually a civil debate and doesn't dissolve into typical internet cattiness and trolling.  :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,TheStarsDescent,2,Thu Jun 25 17:57:39 2015 UTC,Maybe I only speak for myself and my friends but I think there is a lot of crossover between both fandoms. Gaga and AHS have similar styles at points.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,BoysOnTheRadio,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:12:24 2015 UTC,That's very good to know. Perhaps that will bode well for a great season in the threads. I hope so. That would be awesome.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Imnother,2,Sun Jul 5 02:42:07 2015 UTC,Honestly I think she's a wonderful fit style wise. They're both very whimsically and artistically dark while still having room for comic relief. And we know she can act at least to an extent. Emma Roberts isn't the best by any means but Ryan Murphy & co know how to play up type casts and a particular actors strengths very well.  Also want to put out there that I worship gaga. Not everyone who loves her is going to automatically love her acting. Definitely trying to judge it separately than her music and persona.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,BoysOnTheRadio,3,Sun Jul 5 03:36:59 2015 UTC,"If they do, we use our downvotes!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Violetly,3,Sun Jul 5 11:12:28 2015 UTC,"im hoping she has more acting skills than i assume, but shes just chosen to follow music more.  i also hope ryan murphy and whoever else is involved in casting has good judgement and casts people based on their abilities, not their names.  going into it with an open mind - hoping for the best, won't be shocked if disappointed (after i was for 80% of coven).  i think a lot of people are already negative towards the idea due to other musical artists in the past wanting to jump over the acting and the outcome generally being less than stellar."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,infantata,3,Thu Jun 25 09:24:15 2015 UTC,"I saw her perform once, and while there was lots of the over-the-top showy stuff, she also did a couple of really genuine segments where she spoke to the audience and sang different songs in a different way. I think she's a lot better than people give her credit for.  Also, I'm happier to have her than Emma Roberts, who apparently is physically abusive to her partners, so."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Violetly,2,Thu Jun 25 02:00:16 2015 UTC,"What divide are you taking about? The majority of this sub just sucks her dick, all you're going to get is a Gaga is an acting messiah circle jerk and those who don't agree will be down voted to hell."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,unicorns69ng,4,Thu Jun 25 09:25:27 2015 UTC,"Personally, I classify LG as little more than a pop star that gained notoriety off cheap shock factor. Ryan Murphy's decision to involve her kinda spoils it for me. I'm going to give it a try as I might end up surprised and love every second of it but for now, eh we will see. Just really thoroughly relieved that there will be no music numbers"
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,belugabreezy,2,Thu Jun 25 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"What separates her from other ""shock value"" artists is that she has the talent to back it up."

AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,davis98,-3,Thu Jun 25 22:20:14 2015 UTC,"If that's how you classify her, then you know very little about her and shouldn't be classifying her. She is an artist in various senses of the word. You should research her a bit, she's rather fascinating! And full of talent."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Jump_The_Canyon,2,Thu Jun 25 22:40:30 2015 UTC,vomits  You assume my dislike comes from a place of ignorance. You assume.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,belugabreezy,2,Fri Jun 26 04:02:11 2015 UTC,"I am so excited.  As much of a fan of both hers and the show, I find it much better that the musical numbers are not happening.  As good as she is, I would actually like it if she didn't sing one song at all... this way she could spend the entire season showing America all of her batshit crazy creativity!  I heard she inked a contract for 3 seasons recently, this would be epic!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Cejers84,-2,Fri Jun 26 04:41:12 2015 UTC,"First of all, Gaga is not JUST a singer. She is a songwriter, performance artist, and visionary with many more tools under her belt than just some girl with a good voice. In terms of acting, many singers/musicians can't act, because they are solely musicians and have no experience in acting. But Gaga comes from a theatre background and has studied both acting and music; she just happened to have gained notoriety from a music career (so far!) I'm excited to see what she brings to the show, because her artistry extends beyond your average Top 40 radio star."
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Jump_The_Canyon,-20,Thu Jun 25 13:27:05 2015 UTC,shes the worst thing to happen to the show since tate singing nirvana that one time.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,cfunkhouser,8,Thu Jun 25 06:54:57 2015 UTC,I'm interested to hear your specific concerns
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,Semenslayer,8,Wed Jun 24 21:36:04 2015 UTC,Nothing is worse than all the musical bullshit I had to go through in freak show. Tate singing nirvana is when I officially lost interest. But I think lady gaga is already more talented than a lot of people give her credit for so I'm excited to see her acting chops. And if it blows then at least I know I can scratch AHS off my list for real.
AmericanHorrorStory,3azu9i,amandahayman,0,Wed Jun 24 22:01:42 2015 UTC,I just woke up to a vivid dream of me watching Hotel and seeing Matt Bomer chew off lady gaga's arm....so if that happens....lol
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2ly0,Cejers84,2,Thu Jun 25 13:44:18 2015 UTC,It sounds to me (through the little plot information that's been released) like a lot of AHS: Hotel will be grounded in urban legends/actual creepy events that have occurred in hotels.
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2ly0,ilovetorunforfun,2,Thu Jun 25 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of guest's physical appearance changing once they check in (esp. having hollowed or black eyes - very creepy). The season Hotel could either use the supernatural explanation of season 1 by having the location itself be a malevolent force that feeds off fear and paranoia like you suggested, or the season could go for some primal, human horrors by setting up a murderous cult or even a prostitution ring.  If they go with the paranormal this season I'm thinking Evan Peter's character will be a malicious spirit trapping people in room 64 a la Room 1408 and that the writers will tie in a Murder House connection.  But I also believe they'll use Sarah Paulson as the ring leader of a prostitution ring considering the shows track record of combing sex and horror."
AmericanHorrorStory,3b2ly0,anandamidetrip,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:12:56 2015 UTC,Cereal Convention?
AmericanHorrorStory,3aytm5,emergenceoffour,18,Wed Jun 24 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"The only real connection we have been given so far is how season 2 ties into season 4 with the Pepper storyline/backstory as well as Hans Gruper aka Dr. Arthur Arden.  There are rumors and speculation that the upcoming season, Hotel will somehow connect itself to Season 1, Murderhouse, and a good start for that could possibly be the michael langdon/antichrist storyline (which as of right now seems to be the most popular theory) but again this is all just pure speculation and we won't truly ""know"" anything until we witness is with our own eyes!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3aytm5,Ey3z0nF1rE,6,Wed Jun 24 17:00:29 2015 UTC,What if it is the hotel the mistress stayed in before meeting up with the husband?
AmericanHorrorStory,3aytm5,idontgetbacon,-11,Wed Jun 24 18:42:24 2015 UTC,This is unrelated but I thought this was a thread in /r/orphanblack regarding our recent season finale and was so confused when I started reading this LOL
AmericanHorrorStory,3b0uxl,MongooseJowls,7,Thu Jun 25 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"I think I hope this will never happen. It's an anthology series, maybe a little cameo of some characters and easter eggs from other seasons like we had on Freak Show, but that's all."

This series is an anthology and they should keep that premise until the end.
AmericanHorrorStory,3aszwn,lollipoplickers,20,Tue Jun 23 07:11:22 2015 UTC,"I really hope Jamie Brewer is back for Hotel; Nan was both demented, scary & just a little bit camp - impressive acting for a role as a wooden doll."
AmericanHorrorStory,3aszwn,lughnasadh,10,Tue Jun 23 10:29:52 2015 UTC,I think you're talking about Majorie.
AmericanHorrorStory,3aszwn,israeldmo,7,Wed Jun 24 07:07:35 2015 UTC,"You missed the perfect opportunity to say ""I thought her delivery was a little wooden."""
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,Horrified101,23,Tue Jun 23 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"It's probably up to her, whether she just wants to be acknowledged as ""Lady Gaga"" since that's how pretty much everyone knows her, or if she wants to keep her music and acting careers separate and use her actual name. I'm assuming she'll just stick with ""Lady Gaga""."
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,ahsfreakshow,10,Tue Jun 23 02:58:55 2015 UTC,Imdb.com has her credited as lady Gaga. Seems likely it'll stay that way.
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,raspberrykoolaid,10,Tue Jun 23 05:10:27 2015 UTC,"She's credited as Lady Gaga in Machete Kills, so I think it's safe to say she'll be Lady Gaga for Hotel as well"
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,kindergartenc0p,5,Tue Jun 23 14:08:02 2015 UTC,It'll be Lady Gaga. Plenty of actors use stage names. It's just that Lady Gaga doesn't use a traditional name.
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,mikewoj,11,Tue Jun 23 07:14:41 2015 UTC,It will depend on how she has registered with SAG/AFTRA
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,milleribsen,16,Tue Jun 23 03:24:46 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the show will be more professional and use her real name but then again this is the same show that credited ""the mexican"""
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,javiayer,2,Tue Jun 23 02:05:18 2015 UTC,who was the mexican?
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,beaglemaster,8,Tue Jun 23 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"The character in Asylum whom Sister Mary Eunice stabbed to death with a pair of scissors right before the nor'easter. We never learned her name but she was referred to and credited as ""the Mexican"". But to be fair that is a character name and OP is asking how they'll reveal Gaga's name as an actor in the main title sequence."
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,ahsfreakshow,2,Tue Jun 23 02:48:50 2015 UTC,Totally agree that her real name would be more professional
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,whokilledmurph,4,Tue Jun 23 05:03:36 2015 UTC,Lady Gaga is her professional name.
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,Kattastrophe,7,Tue Jun 23 18:12:52 2015 UTC,"I meant that American Horror Story is a show that boasts its actors' names in bold letters in your face at the beginning of each episode. The credits are especially proud of each of its distinguished actors involved in the show (Lange, Bates, Bassett, O'Hare, Cromwell). I just think using a stage name would diminish that. It's just an opinion."
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,whokilledmurph,2,Tue Jun 23 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"Helen Mirren, Michael J. Fox, Demi Moore, Olivia Wilde, and Natalie Portman all use stage names. Among others."
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,Kattastrophe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:27:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah but those all sound like real human names.  Side note: why is this Sub so defensive over Lady Gaga's involvement? I am really interested and even optimistic about how she will perform in the show, but any time I see anything trivial about her casting in Hotel (ie: this back and forth) it gets attacked. She's never seriously acted in television or film (stop using Machete Kills as an example, people, that was not a serious movie), so to be a little nervous about her portraying a main character in your favorite show is fine. I get that she is a theatrical person, both in her music, music videos and public persona, so let me say I am optimistic she will do a good job, but this is definitely a different medium for her to be trying out. No harm, no foul people.  EDIT: Prob just going to post this  as a topic because I am genuinely interested in what the Sub thinks"
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,whokilledmurph,2,Wed Jun 24 20:46:39 2015 UTC,But that's her professional name. Why would they credit her as anything else? That is her name as far as anyone who doesn't personally know her is concerned.
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,Kattastrophe,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:20:42 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is that using her particular stage name seems gimmicky - almost as if each time LADY GAGA jumps into your face during the credits, they're saying ""look who we got!"" Just think it would be cool if she used her real name, like this serious acting gig differs from her celebrity personality and music career. May I ask why you would rather her be credited as Lady Gaga?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,whokilledmurph,3,Thu Jun 25 02:19:11 2015 UTC,Because that's the name she chose to be called by in her professional career. That should be respected.
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,Kattastrophe,3,Thu Jun 25 22:35:50 2015 UTC,She goes by Lady Gaga so most likely she'll be credited as such.
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,FiftySixer,3,Tue Jun 23 05:28:50 2015 UTC,"Lady GaGa has said many times that she will always use her stage name for everything in the entertainment industry. She even goes by Gaga in her personal life. I'm not against it because that's who she is, it's her name, real or not."
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,crunkpocalypse,2,Wed Jun 24 22:09:51 2015 UTC,It will be LADY GAGA with all caps
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,unicorns69ng,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:48:51 2015 UTC,"Probably Lady Gaga. It's what she most goes by everywhere, as I can see."

Or Stephani ""Lady Gaga"" Germanotta!  =)  I'd like to see her invent a character with a strange accent (her accents, and ability to speak many other languages is incredible) and portray something or someone the furthest from the Lady Gaga persona possible.  She is an insanely talented actress/performance artist.  Can not WAIT!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3arz5r,Cejers84,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:47:34 2015 UTC,"Like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.  When he first got into acting it was always ""The Rock"". Then Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Now he's usually credited as Dwayne Johnson.  So I think you'll just see ""Lady Gaga"" unless her career takes her to a place where she's known more for her acting."

If they know someone who's a clown, this is an awful tribute to them, maybe they conquered their fear of clowns? but why remind yourself of that shit all the time?  plus, as you said, it's not exactly the sharpest of tattoos. especially the lines above the right eye....ouchies."
AmericanHorrorStory,3ak273,doomsday1216,12,Sun Jun 21 16:24:49 2015 UTC,"Not every tattoo needs to hold a special meaning for everyone. Some people get tattoos because they simply like the design, or just want a tattoo. That may not be why you personally would get one, but that's your right to decide what and why you get a tattoo. Different strokes for different folks.  But the tattoo is poorly done. They should seek out a better artist to fix the glaringly obvious issues."

I like the idea of having them all connected in a few ways, for example I loved Peppers story arc in both Asylum and Freak Show.

AmericanHorrorStory,3agjbo,thesecoloursdontrun,3,Fri Jun 19 23:58:11 2015 UTC,"This is currently at the top of the subreddit, but yeah ok."
AmericanHorrorStory,3agjbo,davis98,-12,Sat Jun 20 01:22:46 2015 UTC,"we’re building this incredible six-story Art Deco hotel   Art deco really? This show has become ridiculously overly-designed and its overwhelming the story. Its become style over substance. What's wrong with a basic hotel with really simple lines? That would be chilling - less is more. Sparse, empty hall ways for a creepy little girl to be playing, singing a nursery rhyme while she plays with her ""invisible"" friend. More chills, less ""fabulous!"".      Like Asylum, going back to something stripped back would be really refreshing after the crazy baroque style of Freak Show. Elsa's ""temporary"" tent bedroom was like the most lavish Hollywood film set, let alone her immaculately dry cleaned costumes that would have cost a fortune for a show running on the smell of an oily rag apparently . They ran the beautifully lit Ferris wheel all night apparently giving priority to ambiance over the generator fuel economy.  I loved the mix of style and substance of the first two seasons but  the set and costume designers have got out of control. The gay aesthetic is out of control. I think its to cover up a lack of depth in the stories.      Instead of spending so much time set and costume designing and dressing, they should focus their energy on coming up with a great twisting-turning, unified story."
AmericanHorrorStory,3agjbo,girlsjiggle,14,Sat Jun 20 02:33:52 2015 UTC,Holy shit. This is the biggest overreaction I've ever seen.
AmericanHorrorStory,3agjbo,davis98,-14,Sat Jun 20 03:14:22 2015 UTC,No I think yours was
AmericanHorrorStory,3agjbo,girlsjiggle,5,Sat Jun 20 05:37:46 2015 UTC,It has nothing to do with what you are saying.  Art Deco just signifies the building was built in 1920-1930..letting us know it an old hotel with history.  Ryan had already said he has searched old hotels in la with history where terrifying things Happened..like garden of Allah or chateau Marmont..
AmericanHorrorStory,3agjbo,Ey3z0nF1rE,-2,Sat Jun 20 05:25:43 2015 UTC,"Are deco is a beautiful, elaborate, geometrical style of architecture - google it. I love it but it gives licence to go quite overboard with the hotel design. I think the design is increasingly used as a crutch to cover weak narrative. If they put enough eye candy on the screen - set design, costumes, all the pretty boys cast this year- everyone will ahhhh and awww enough so they don't see the emperor is wearing some pretty flimsy plot clothes.  Sometimes limitations can be an artists best friend. Having a stark, minimalist hotel design would mean Murphy and Falchuk couldn't hide behind gorgeousness and gorgosity and have to come up with a really strong story to pull viewers along like S1 & 2.      Are they slaving away to break strong stories utilising horror tropes to explore powerful archetypal themes or is Murphy more concerned with how beautiful his art deco hotel looks or the how adorable the bellboy will be in his lovely little outfit? The last couple of seasons they have pumped too much energy into design at the expense of story. Style without substance is superficiality."
AmericanHorrorStory,3agjbo,girlsjiggle,4,Sat Jun 20 06:44:15 2015 UTC,"art dec·o ˌärt ˈdekō/ noun the predominant decorative art style of the 1920s and 1930s, characterized by precise and boldly delineated geometric shapes and strong colors, and used most notably in household objects and in architecture. They don't have to do anything else to get new viewers and make anything flashy. American horror story is already the single highest rated show in FX history.."
AmericanHorrorStory,3agjbo,Ey3z0nF1rE,-5,Sat Jun 20 07:03:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you could still have an older, plain hotel that isn't Art Deco and uses whatever histories or tales you like. The sumptuous over-styling can kill sense of grounded reality."

AmericanHorrorStory,3acs0v,FogSeeFrank,7,Fri Jun 19 13:41:19 2015 UTC,"This is great, personally I think that the musical numbers were kind of justified for freak show, and the one for asylum was perfectly for sister Jude's going loco... I personally believe that Scream Queens will be everything that RM wanted to do after season 2, bitching divas, musicals, comedy and more, and will leave AHS into a more season 1 and 2 kind of setting, I think this season will be great."
AmericanHorrorStory,3acs0v,RedditMayne,22,Fri Jun 19 20:48:13 2015 UTC,"Normally I'd be okay with this, but you're gonna cast Lady Gaga and THEN take out the singing?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3acs0v,Henry_Burris,18,Fri Jun 19 05:58:26 2015 UTC,"Good for them--it's always interesting to watch comedians (Whoopi Goldberg, Robin Williams, Patton Oswalt, etc) take on non-comedy roles and do fantastically in them. Casting Gaga is a non-music role will be interesting. I would also love to see famous singers in dramatic roles--Annie Lennox dabbled a bit in this in the '80s."

AmericanHorrorStory,3acs0v,Tobias_you_blowhard,16,Sat Jun 20 06:39:28 2015 UTC,"Meh. I think the numbers got far too much hate last season. They were appropriate to that season. It was called Freak Show, they had to put on a show.   The only reason Asylum had one was to personify the madness which Jude had slipped into. Besides, AHS has always been about mixing lots of themes together on top of the horror. Straight up horror would be straight up boring and predictable."
AmericanHorrorStory,3acs0v,sadovsky,7,Fri Jun 19 16:32:08 2015 UTC,I didn't have a problem with them at first. I really liked Jessica Lange's performances because they felt relevant to the story. But all the other numbers felt unneccessary to me.

We have a great cast and it'd be amazing to see how a new dynamic in the ensemble resonates. That said, she will most likely get a role now...

AmericanHorrorStory,3acn3b,Ey3z0nF1rE,30,Fri Jun 19 02:48:52 2015 UTC,Actually her coworkers said the exact opposite and that she is absolutely amazing and brilliant to work with and that they feel like more improved actors after working with her!  I don't think she has a ego at all or that any of her characters were tuned to make her godlike as you say..and I also don't feel like her characters were the same person every season like a lot of people claim... her character depth was so crazy she showed so much range from season to season..to absolutely hate Jude at the beginning of season two but then have the ability to make people cry when she died at the end of the same season...or how put off people were by her character in season one but how much they love Fiona good in season three just shows she can do pretty much anything & she is a true veteran and definitely a staple for the show ..she built it!!!  Yes the show will go on without her but if she wants back please believe Ryan will put her back!!!

Aliens are always seen as technological advanced beings, while God and religion is seen as something Divine, two completely oppposite views about something that may or may not excist.   So as some people may see aliens, others think it's God's work? Anyway, that was my view on the whole thing. :)"

AmericanHorrorStory,3aemlm,Ey3z0nF1rE,8,Fri Jun 19 23:09:40 2015 UTC,I agree with you minus the part about the aliens in asylum..that storyline served a meaningful purpose as well!!
AmericanHorrorStory,3aemlm,Ey3z0nF1rE,4,Fri Jun 19 14:44:50 2015 UTC,"I thought the whole aliens thing worked for getting him into the asylum but then they kind of didn't do much for the rest of the series, sure they were there but if I were making it I would have made a lot more of grubers monsters (which also kind of faded into nothing).  I felt both of them were half told because they tried to get too many storylines on the go at once."
AmericanHorrorStory,3aemlm,whokilledmurph,13,Fri Jun 19 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"It fit the era for that particular setting.  Abductions first started happening in 1964..Barney and Betty hill were kit and alma.  Ryan Murphy: “For me, [aliens] were always an obvious metaphor for God. It fit very easily into the world of a Catholic sanitarium asylum... It was also about science versus faith so it made sense to me. The show is a show that pays tribute to a lot of horror masters. We take that seriously, so I always loved the alien idea of it, I loved what it was, I loved what it was about.”  Tim Minear: “The Betty and Barney Hill story of the fifties, sixties, was one of the first abduction stories. It was an interracial couple, we weren’t taking from that specifically, but it was in the water, in our experience, the stories that we all knew. When Ryan first pitched out that first story, he pitched it in that order, and he was like, ‘And then we meet him at his farm, and then he’s abducted by aliens.’ And my jaw was on the floor, but it felt exactly right to me for the period. If you think about it, those aliens are the closest things to angels, on our show about sort of religion versus science, there was nothing incongruous to me about any of that stuff.”"
AmericanHorrorStory,3aemlm,happyspeck,2,Fri Jun 19 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I thought it was entirely appropriate to put the aliens in it but I didn't think there was a satisfying beginning, middle and end for them. I didn't feel with the amount of screen time they were given that they should have been there. To me it felt like he went ""I've got a lot of good ideas that I want to implement but can't decide on the best one. Oh well, I'll just put all of them in"""
AmericanHorrorStory,3aemlm,truecreature,3,Fri Jun 19 15:43:05 2015 UTC,"I always interpreted the alien storyline's lack of beginning, middle, end as purposeful. Humans have fought forever over who's God is right and who's is wrong, without actually having any proof over who is right. Arden's science was his religion, and it directly conflicted with Jude's religion. Much like we as humans will never know what power is in the sky, the audience never really knows the full story behind the aliens, as they are as Murphy said an ""obvious metaphor"" for God."
AmericanHorrorStory,3aemlm,itsbaaad,9,Sat Jun 20 16:19:07 2015 UTC,Coven was definitely my favourite season!
AmericanHorrorStory,3aemlm,jonjawnjahnsss,4,Fri Jun 19 15:51:19 2015 UTC,"For me it was just that I found most of the cast irritating for some reason. Madison is an obvious one, the bitchiness of Jessica Lange's character was turned up to 11 that season and there was less to sympathize with her about to help alleviate that, and I think every witch there ended up murdering somebody at some point. Whether the murder-ee deserved it or not, young girls being able to just off them like it ain't no thing rubbed me the wrong way.  It was still a good series and I enjoyed watching it, that's just what sends it to the bottom for me."
AmericanHorrorStory,3aemlm,bluntsarebest,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:55:34 2015 UTC,"Another possibly controversial opinion here: I haven't liked any of Jessica Lange's characters. I don't know if it's just the fact that she was given particularly nasty characters but in each series, I've hated her character.  In fact, coven was the one series where I almost liked her character, she seemed less evil and more just a bit of a bitch."
AmericanHorrorStory,3aemlm,malv0,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:30:13 2015 UTC,"I've always believed that if a writer can make some one truly hate a character in their universe, then they're definitely doing something right.  You don't like people for the horrible things they've done or say in real life, so why not create those kind of people who incite the same emotions and reactions into our various forms of art?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3aemlm,Ey3z0nF1rE,4,Wed Jul 8 02:47:00 2015 UTC,"Coven is the only one I have on DVD. I like tbh, but Asylum is a close second for me. It's like a turducken of a season, it's great but at some points it could have some stuff taken out. There's just a lot of stuff jam packed in there sometimes it can get a bit overwhelming, but it's all good elements."

AmericanHorrorStory,3aavjw,Ey3z0nF1rE,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:19:29 2015 UTC,"No he is not confirmed or even ""unofficially"" added (yet).  About a month ago, while Denis was performing in a play in Cairo, Egypt, he did an interview with a newspaper agency in Cairo, and he claimed he was indeed going to be oerforming in season 5, Hotel.  The word quickly spread around here, facebook, Twitter & other social media outlets..but when Denis realized the shitstorm he has created by making these claims before actually being given an offer from Ryan, he got on Twitter and apologized for climbing he was going to be a part of the cast without actually being offered the position yet.  He said he is still in high hopes of joining and would love to take any offer they give him as far as characters.  I think his confusion came from the fact that before Freakshow was filmed, Denis signed on to a 2/year deal with the anthology series.  But realistically, the contract May not be back to back.  2 years could mean Freakshow and then hotel..or it could mean FREAKSHOW, skip hotel and instead do season 6."

AmericanHorrorStory,3ahm67,etv123,10,Sun Jun 21 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"It's interesting how everyone sees things so differently. Viva la difference!  It probably depends on how you much you dig Murphy & Falchuks style because they are not exactly subtle. There stuff is brash and bold with a scatter gun approach. But when they are on song they layer in fantastic themes with real depth and richness. It's like drama-horror using horror tropes exploring psychological, sexual and societal themes.      You can see the actors are really encouraged to really swing for the fences. It always borders on campy with a fair bit of scenery chewing. But it works almost like a stage play with some really nicely written pieces that you can see the actors really enjoying chewing on. There is real authenticity between Ben and Vivien, Violet and Tate, Constance and the maid.  To me the show captures the power of horror the way Polanski, Kubrick, Hitchcock and DePalma used to do it. Its not just about scares or twists but a blurring of inner and outer realities and uses Joseph Campbells ideas of the descent into the unconscious to face terrors and monsters to become more whole, more real.      The house is the very symbol of family. On the surface it is beautiful and everything looks great. But then the horrors lurking away under the family's happy façade show themselves. Things repressed come up from the unconscious and force themselves to be faced.   I loved the ending. I thought it was really clever resolution where the family finally finds a togetherness.   You might like Asylum (s2) better. Its a bit more twisty-turny thriller-like but still has incredible thematic depth exploring religion, sex, memory, reality, destiny and individual responsibility."

AmericanHorrorStory,3ahm67,israeldmo,3,Sun Jun 21 09:07:58 2015 UTC,"I can somewhat relate to this. But overall disagree. Personally, I loved the whole season except for the very last episode. There were some things they could have fleshed out better.   I binged watched this over the weekend. Watched all of season 1 in one day. Probably helped that I started watching the first few episodes at night which added to the atmosphere. Found rubberman to be really freaky. That was probably what got me hooked.   But I do agree with you on the ending. It felt really camp and didn't go with the overall tone of the show. Most people loved Constance, but she wasn't for me. Don't get me wrong. Jessica Lange played her brilliantly. But something about her character just rubbed me the wrong way.   I started Season 2 Episode 1 straight after. It definitely feels like another show. Will probably watch Episode 2 tonight, but so far it hasn't grabbed me as much as Season 1."

And the acting!- Jessica Lange won a Golden Globe, Primetime Emmy, SAG award and a Saturn Award for her part as Constance. Connie Britton, Denis O'Hare and Frances Conroy also received Emmy nominations. The show itself received Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy nominations. Maybe you weren't that impressed, but the critics and people who give out the awards were.   You really should give Asylum a try, because overall it is better than Murder House."

We're here because we love the show, so you're not going to get an unbiased opinion.   That said, it's an incredibly complex show and each season has multiple plot lines and characters woven in. Yes, there is plenty of supernatural/impossible elements, but that's not to reduce the show to some dippy fantasy or sci-fi show - it kind of includes everything. There are plot lines for romance, mystery, horror and humour. It's a totally unique show - nobody can decide if you like something but you, but I would encourage you to give AHS a decent try. Watch a few episodes back-to-back and things will start making sense and grabbing your attention. And if things are still confusing you, ask us! We don't bite... :)"

AmericanHorrorStory,3a9m61,BlkWhiteSupremecist,5,Thu Jun 18 20:47:20 2015 UTC,"I just began watching it, finished the fourth episode. The first two episodes were confusing, but it's smoothing out. I know why many of the characters are so erratic, but I'm not quite sure on what their purposes are yet. Like you said, it's interesting enough to finish until the end of the season, but in my opinion it's not really interesting enough for me to say I'd want to watch another season yet. I think it seems pretty drawn out, and there's a lot of cheesy dialogue and some drama that's already old (think Walter and Skyler - that shit got annoying fast too). The plot is still pretty interesting, but the backstory is what I'm really interested in. Hopefully it ends up being worth the watch."

AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,mansonfamily,23,Mon Jun 15 19:47:43 2015 UTC,Yeah but the article is saying that freak show on average was the most viewed show in FX history..beating out all other seasons of AHS...sons of anarchy..the shield..justified..etc
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Ey3z0nF1rE,21,Mon Jun 15 20:26:53 2015 UTC,AHS Hotel will blow the Freak Show figures out the window.
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,mansonfamily,9,Mon Jun 15 20:35:06 2015 UTC,Oh I absolutely agree with you on that
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Ey3z0nF1rE,6,Mon Jun 15 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"I also think Scream Queens is going to do very very well, I understand why it doesn't appeal to all of the AHS viewers but that's kinda the point."
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,mansonfamily,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:45:52 2015 UTC,Yeah..Inthink it will DefinItely draw in the AHS coven audience as well as people who like the campier horror stuff..plus with the good looking boys and girls of the show..and vet actress jamie Lee cutted I think it will do with older and younger crowds
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Ey3z0nF1rE,2,Mon Jun 15 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"Exactly. A lot of people might misinterpret ""rated"" to mean it's on some scale of how good it was; ratings as in TV ratings are just based on how many people tuned in. As great as it was, Asylum was actually the lowest rated season of AHS simply because it was much darker and not as many people were into that."
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,ahsfreakshow,3,Mon Jun 15 23:50:30 2015 UTC,"When your job is reliant on the media, any attention is good attention. That's how shows like ""2 and a Half Men"" get so many seasons. Whether people loved it or hated it is irrelevant, they're still making money off of it because it was watched. Personally, I think Freakshow was the worst of all seasons and that AHS has only declined in quality since season 1 (I still like season 2, but I like 1 better). But people watch it anyway so it doesn't matter."
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Gogohax,22,Tue Jun 16 02:07:46 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it's because it aired when the show was most popular.  The good stuff happened before it ever got viewership.  I call it Arrested Development syndrome.
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Onlythefinestwilldo,118,Mon Jun 15 22:37:25 2015 UTC,"An in my opinion, it was the worst season."
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,diegojones4,63,Mon Jun 15 19:31:03 2015 UTC,It started off so well. Lost hope when they killed off Twisty and added in the useless magician. Also killing them all in 10 mins is just such a copout!
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Fairylin01,4,Mon Jun 15 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  The second half of the season was just as good as the first.  And I wouldn't say Chester the magician was ""useless.""  The whole purpose of him being added was to show that Elsa was moving on to Hollywood And leaving the freaks behind..and with ETheL being gone there wasn't anyone else fit to run the show so they brought in Chester to buy the show from Elsa.  Also I don't think the freak massacre at the very end was a copout...Dandy was originally only to appear in a few episodes but after him quickly becoming a fan favorite, Ryan wrote him into the rest of the series. Him killing off the freaks was to show his character development/transformation and the monster he has truly become"
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Ey3z0nF1rE,12,Mon Jun 15 20:38:56 2015 UTC,"To show the monster he had become? It's not like he was a half-decent character at the start, He was an evil monster to begin with and he was an evil monster at the end.   I understood why Chester was there - I should have made it more clear; I hated the elsa/Hollywood storyline.  On another note; Dandy was only supposed to be in a few eps and twisty was killed off in ep4 (I think) who was going to be the baddie then?"
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Fairylin01,4,Mon Jun 15 21:34:55 2015 UTC,"The Elsa/Hollywood storyline was the single most masturbatory thing that show's done. Lange had a great three season run, and then she spent season four taking a bow.   That aside, the fact that they switched Dandy's fate with Stanley's was one of the biggest missed opportunities of the franchise. At least this season had Chiklis acting his ass off."
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,aDildoAteMyBaby,2,Tue Jun 16 06:54:42 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry if this is a dumb question, but has it been confirmed that Dandy and Stanley's fates were swapped? I've always thought it would've made more since if they were the other way around, but didn't know whether or not that was the original intention."
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,ticktock_heart,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:04:07 2015 UTC,"They weren't actually swapped but they should have been, AFAIK."
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,aDildoAteMyBaby,-1,Tue Jun 16 22:00:54 2015 UTC,At the beginning dandy was a spoiled brat/petulant man child but had not evolved into a deranged mass murderer so it was charzctsr development/transformstion..and it took twisty to make dandy realize his murderous outlet!!!.  Im not sure why they rewrote the scripy and added/took out certain things..maybe stanley was supposed to be worse from the very beginning but too many people assumed that he himself would kill off the freaks and sell them all to the morbidity museum? Im not sure lol but I agree that it would have been nice for twisty to be around a little longer
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Ey3z0nF1rE,-6,Mon Jun 15 21:53:51 2015 UTC,This comment is full of shit. You're telling me that AHS season 4 was all set to go in a different direction but then after the first half of the series Ryan got all of the actors together again and rewrote and refilmed the second half of the season just for Dandy to appear more often just because he became a favorite character. Let me see where you read that. I'm pretty sure you just made that shit up and pulled it out of your ass while you were on opiates.

AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Ey3z0nF1rE,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:40:16 2015 UTC,"And no he just rewrote part of the script and added/took things out (like more songs..extra scenes..we never saw the ""you better run ima"" scene or Gloria holding a pistol to retinas head..but we saw them on previews..AHS like to use deleted scenes as trailer for the next weeks episode...They wouldn't refilm..and just so you know Ryan only writes the script an episode at a time..not the full season.  He may have it laid out in his head but do your research..and like I said no they wouldn't refilm..when an episode premieres and is new to us..they are only filming 2 episodes past what we are seeing.

AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Ey3z0nF1rE,-1,Tue Jun 16 02:47:04 2015 UTC,Filming for FS began in March of 2014 and ended by the end of that summer. Idk where you read that they were still working on new episodes while the season was airing but that's something that hardly ever happens with TV shows.
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Gogohax,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:23:24 2015 UTC,"You're crazy and full of shit. In November 2013 they announced there would be a fourth show but didn't even reveal the theme or setting until Marc 2014 when you claim filming began.  Filming began in July and ended in December..the show aired in October and finales in January..I don't know if you were just making up stuff for you believe what you were saying or if you were just trolling some more but you can go right to the Freakshow Wikipedia page and look under production to see the facts I am posting  At Paley Center for Media's 2014 PaleyFest event, Ryan Murphy announced that the season's filming would take place again in New Orleans, Louisiana, although the show's setting is in Jupiter, Florida.[39] The premiere episode was directed by co-creator Murphy, his first effort since the pilot.[40] Principal photography for the season began on July 15, 2014,[41] and concluded on December 19, 2014.[42]  obviously hotel DOESNT even start filming until July..the show premiers in oct and ends in January..there's 13 episodes a season..so if they didn't continue to film while airing new shows means they would record 13 episodes between July and first week of October..that means they would film episode a week.

And extactly what i said was FINN was only offered a couple episodes but later asked to do the WHOLE season..so yes they changed the second half of the season in some way to account for Dandys storyline continuing on..So im pretty sure I didn't make anything up and you just showed everyone your an idiotic pansy trying to judge somebody U don't know:) damn it feels good to be a gangsta (on opiates!!!!)
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Ey3z0nF1rE,-1,Tue Jun 16 02:30:58 2015 UTC,"You said that Ryan went back and rewrote episodes to include Finn AFTER the first episodes aired BECAUSE he was a fan favorite.

AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,hfist,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:00:54 2015 UTC,"I actually agree. Coven was bad too but at least it had a fast paced story. Freak Show in my opinion tried to blend the darkness of Asylum and the campiness of Coven and ended up with just a really weird mess. They started by making things more realistic, but that realism was totally abandoned once it should have mattered (why didn't the police keep chasing Bette and Dot? why does Jimmy instantly get over committing a murder? why is the entire police force universally corrupt? how did 2 women murder the head of a popular museum and take part of her body all the way back down to Florida without getting caught or even investigated?) If the show had spent more time focusing on the simple, logical things like that, and spent less time on pointless drama, I think it would have been better."

I am personally fascinated with those subjects, and I noticed that more people are usually eager to discuss about the history of freak shows even if they only know of the usual cliches such as the bearded lady and fattest person in the world.   I am speaking from my personal experiences though."
AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,Spookychilies,3,Tue Jun 16 04:41:35 2015 UTC,I know most people love asylum...But i think to the general audience the overall look and feel was to dark and didn't stick around see the season progress...

AmericanHorrorStory,39y4d4,kylethewild,2,Mon Jun 15 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"FX consistently puts out good shows. Comedy and drama. But this makes no sense to me. I think Freak Show brought in a younger, more easily pleased audience. The artistic, dark, and truly well written seasons (1 & 2) drew in the usual FX fans: the ones who can appreciate it. Unfortunately, there weren't too many of those fans, hence the lower ratings."

They were basically getting paid to do what they already did. I'd love for them to be at each others throats...maybe kill each other one season. Though the split was amicable.

For me, it's pretty hit or miss.  I loved ""The Name Game"" and Elsa's ""Life on Mars"" number, but the other songs were kind of cringe-y.  I especially didn't care for Jimmy's ""Come As You Are.""

The name game, life on Mars and heroes were fine but all the other ones were completely unnecessary. Apparently there were supposed to be more musical numbers in freakshow but they were written out- so I hope they learned their lesson. Sorry but musical numbers just take away from the horror aspect."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,Ey3z0nF1rE,6,Fri Jun 12 19:52:54 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I understand why they did the name game..I realize that freak show performers actually do song and a lot of the songs performed on Freakshow were related to that particular characters backstory...and Stevie nicks was a guest star on coven so yes they got away with her piano renditions..so I'm hoping that if they do anything this year it's maybe a single performance from gaga for the first time we are introduced to her character or something As long as it is somehow related to the storyline

I'd like a hallucinatory musical number like ""The Name Game"", but rather the subject hallucinating is actually involved in some gory activity that we learn about in a later episode.

AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,CoffeeCandle,9,Thu Jun 18 17:47:04 2015 UTC,"I HOPE NOT. having Elsa sing Life on Mars and We Could Be Heroes was great, and made sense. But then Ryan brought the season into Glee territory with Bette and Dot singing Criminal and the rest of the musical numbers.   I hope they don't do the same this year. Maybe one lounge number, but the horror diminishes with musical numbers in my opinion.  If Lady Gaga wants to be taken seriously as an actress, I think she could do something interesting and not sing. Her character could easily not have to sing. Because she ends up singing, it will take away from her being seen as a character and it'll just be lady Gaga in another costume."

AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,Zinthaniel,4,Fri Jun 12 20:26:32 2015 UTC,"I don't enjoy it and echo sentiments. Season 1 & 2 had no singing, aside from season 2's totally in context name game song that fit well into Jude's psychosis, and they were great for it."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,LSunday,9,Fri Jun 12 18:14:50 2015 UTC,"i don't understand why people are more okay with Name Game in the middle of an asylum but seeing musical performances from aperformance trope who make their living through music and performance is so out there.  Fine, if you liked Name Game more, that's cool, but just admit it doesn't fit so much more than the Freakshow performances."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,Zinthaniel,6,Fri Jun 12 19:00:28 2015 UTC,"Why would I admit to something that isn't true?   The name game was directly related to Jude's psychotic break. It held a double meaning on one hand it represented that in her subconscious her memory held the information she sought, that deep down in the wells of her mind her sanity was still there -  while on the other it reflected her broken psyche. The song fit because it established in that bleak environment what kind of nuanced and convoluted psychosis brings about in a patient that has lost grip of reality. Unlike - freakshow, it wasn't a shout out to some random fandom and their ideological artist. The Name Game has a place in the story that very astutely characterized Jude's character arch.   None of the songs in freakshow held that sort of context."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,LSunday,4,Fri Jun 12 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"So the fact that Life on Mars was simultaneously speaking to the egotism of Elsa's character, singing a song focused around her own name, while touching on how entertainment and movies cover up the gruesome, persecuted lives of the Freaks for the entertainment of others?  Or her rehearsal later, again showing how she viewed herself as the angel surrounded by monsters?  Bette and Dot's song, where Dot started to finally accept her role in the world that accepted her?  Jimmy's anthem that he refuses to change even in all the hardships and how tempted he is to run away, along his path to where he eventually chooses to get his freak hands instead of becoming 'normal' like Elsa did?  Not to touch on the fact that they were all musical performers.  Why would you expect the writers to have a bunch of singers and musicians as characters and never have a musical performance?  it's an inherant piece of the setting.  And yes, they wrote a very well-crafted arc around why The Name Game was placed in season 2, but the fact still stands there is no reason for a song in dance number in the middle of a mental institution; they had to write an entire arc essentially justifying it's presence, and it couldl easily have been replaced by any number of psychotic break scenes.  But singing and dancing was as much a part of the carny world as knife throwing and escape tanks and magic acts.  How much you liked the performances and songs they used doesn't change the fact they fit the world."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,KaineCloaked,6,Fri Jun 12 21:39:22 2015 UTC,I don't think he hates what the songs bring to the characters but how forced the songs began to feel. It was more appropriate and subtle instead of dedicating too much screen time to musical numbers.
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,Zinthaniel,2,Sat Jun 13 00:28:12 2015 UTC,Thank you. You understand perfectly.
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,beholdtheheart,4,Sat Jun 13 00:51:13 2015 UTC,I agree with Zinthaniel. The Name Game placed neatly in the theme of Aslyum. It wasn't some out of place pop song from an era unrelated to the on in that current season. It was pretty obscure - most people didn't even know what the song was. I liked that and it made perfect sense.   It played out creepily. It didn't remove the viewer from the atmosphere. In freak show it simply became cheesy and it wasn't creepy at all.
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,Zinthaniel,3,Sat Jun 13 00:56:24 2015 UTC,"You can technically put a song in any show for any reason at any time.  That is true.   The distinction between season 2 and that of season 4 is that in season 2 the musical wasn't simply to pay homage to some artist or to simply placate ryan's taste for musicals.   The name game fit the era of that season - but even more so it played well into the atmosphere that is an asylum. Could they have demonstrated Jude's broke Psyche without it? I'm not sure they could. If you take a look at film and television history typically randomness of that nature is how a psychotic break is depicted.   Sure they could have played it straight and narrow and simply had her go catatonic, but then that would be a very boring way to depict something that in regards to the inner working of a dilapidated mind is actually very colorful and tragic.   In freakshow - that never was the case. First of all  - historically freakshow were not concerts where people would sing. Singing wasn't really all that common ata  circus at all. Furthermore - they kept using songs that had no relation to the musical history of the era that Freak Show was part of.   Season 2 had one musical - it fit perfectly and that was it. Enjoyable. Freak Show lost focus of what kind of show it is. Ryan seemed to want to create a Glee 2.0 with a morbid spin. The songs came across as frivolous and unnecessary. In these instances the songs seemed to play to a theme regarding the character - but they could have written those character revelations or nods in a more entertaining and dark way that would befit a show that prides its self in the disturbing and grotesque."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,TheStarsDescent,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:20:03 2015 UTC,"Without agreeing or disagreeing with your sentiments regarding how the musical numbers fit (thematically) in season 2 and/or 4, I want to point out that you're incorrect in saying that there were not musical performances in these types of atmospheres.  Also, please keep in mind that there is a BIG difference between a carnival or a freakshow and a Circus.  This was not a circus.  Carnivals and freakshows used/borrowed elements from cabarets and vaudeville.  There were, in fact, people singing, dancing, etc.  There was music.  The entire show wasn't musical, but musical elements did exist.   Therefore, having musical numbers in Freakshow was contextual and fitting with the theme/era.  The way many of the musical numbers were executed, however... that's a different story.  I will say that having Elsa be an aspiring singer did make sense of her musical numbers.  And they weren't totally shoe-horned in... her first number was her performing at a show [and it was even addressed that it ""wasn't all that good"" by Gloria], her second number was at the Halloween rehearsal [which was necessary to bring Edward Mordrake into the picture], and obviously ""Heroes"" made sense because she was on her show.  I'd even defend the Bette/Dot number as it was the catalyst for Elsa becoming jealous of them.  Jimmy's ""Come as You Are"" was absolutely unnecessary, though, as his character was never established as being a singer or a performer in that capacity.  The musical numbers in Freakshow weren't the best, but they at least fit the Freakshow theme and (most) made sense as far as plot was concerned.  The Name Game also made sense in this context.  Honestly, I do really wish they'd abandon any singing.  I love Stevie Nicks, but that Seven Wonders music video made me cringe.  As did ""Come as You Are"" and parts of ""Criminal.""  And, honestly, I LOVE Jessica's rendition of ""Gods and Monsters"" but her attempt at hitting those high notes in ""Life on Mars"" made me cringe as well.  I think they're better off leaving them out all together.... however with people like Gaga, Cheyenne Jackson, etc coming on board... I'm thinking there will be some singing.  :/"
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,TheStarsDescent,2,Sat Jun 13 17:06:12 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add (instead of doing an edit) that I'm one of the people who REALLY wished they'd used songs from the time period.  I honestly think that if they had done this, people wouldn't have been nearly as offended or upset by the musical numbers in Freakshow.  As I said, I love Jessica's version of ""Gods and Monsters,"" but only to listen to.  When I'm watching the show and she's referencing Jim Morrison in 1952.... that's ridiculous."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,Zinthaniel,1 point,Sat Jun 13 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I do really wish they'd abandon any singing.    ok. Well ultimately is boils down to taste. Some people can see the charm and the value of the musicals and some can not. In freak show I just felt they all were flat.   I do agree 100% with what I quoted above."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,Middlefingahz,2,Sat Jun 13 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"And yes, they wrote a very well-crafted arc around why The Name Game was placed in season 2, but the fact still stands there is no reason for a song in dance number in the middle of a mental institution; they had to write an entire arc essentially justifying it's presence, and it couldl easily have been replaced by any number of psychotic break scenes.   they did not have to write an entire arc to justify it. T Hey could have done it for any character. An asylum is full of patients and inmates with minds that are so far gone that it's believable that they may think that they are in a musical.   It makes since. It ties into the theme of that season. It's insane. What you just said is in fact true for Freakshow. That season not only kept shooting it's self in the foot by using musicals, it kept using numbers that had no cadence or style befitting of that era. Random songs from the 90's and the new millennium - is was disjointing and on top of that none of them had any creep factor.   THe show is at least disturbing, if not scary. That is what is set out to do originally. Freakshow kept pulling viewers out of the suspense it would build up by throwing them into this random and jarring and totally out of place musical number that had no scary effect."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,thefamoushipster,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:03:51 2015 UTC,I've got a feeling we won't be seeing any singing this coming season. He created Scream Queens to cover the horror/musical thing he wanted. I think this season will be going back to it's season 1/2 roots

AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,ajax0418,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:22:04 2015 UTC,"I hope not. I've not enjoyed most of the singing as I felt it didn't make sense. It was especially jarring in Season 2 with the Name Game, although I love that season the best. I get that it makes sense in Freak Show with Elsa's character but I just don't care for Lange's voice, if it was hers. It also bothered me that they used contemporary songs that weren't around in that decade. It was like a half assed attempt at what Baz Lurhman (sp) did in Moulin Rouge, except he nailed it. If they had used time appropriate music, then maybe it wouldn't have bothered me so much.  I'm sure Lady Gaga will sing and I do like her voice. I just hope it appropriate to the time the season is set in. I'm not holding my breath though."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,Jarfy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:31:59 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Jessica singing in season 2 because it was random and fun, but then they kept doing it in season 4 (Jessica did do good covers though) and it felt out of place even though her character was meant to be a singer. So I prefer little singing or none at all."
AmericanHorrorStory,39m2ni,Ey3z0nF1rE,1 point,Fri Jun 12 20:26:36 2015 UTC,I would be willing to bet money that Lady Gaga and Cheyenne Jackson both perform at least once next season..and I don't know if Angela Bassett can sing but if she's supposed to be causing trouble for gaga in the ballroom it's either going to be singing or dancing I would assume..but we know where assumptions can get us sometimes;)

It's actually really good IMO..and it is period piece that stays true to its actual time setting..people forget horror ISNT just monsters and jump scares..it's an intense feeling of fear, terror, shock or disgust and freakshow captures all of those elements.  The underlying basis of the entire show is to shed light on the fact that human beings and the human mind can be the biggest monster of all..definstely some good psychological stuff on there!!"

AmericanHorrorStory,39g1al,MikeArrow,0,Fri Jun 12 16:26:14 2015 UTC,It sucked that every character (especially Madison Montgomery and Myrtle Snow) were reduced down to a series of giffable retorts by the end of the season.

She was an actress on the show, she left, new actors are coming on per usual, however the new actors purposes is not to replace Jessica.

AmericanHorrorStory,39lzwc,Zinthaniel,3,Fri Jun 12 18:16:56 2015 UTC,I thought I was the only one.
AmericanHorrorStory,39lzwc,TEXASJerome,8,Sat Jun 13 14:41:47 2015 UTC,"The fact that you don't consider Kathy Bates or Angela Bassett ""big veteran names"" kind of makes me discredit your entire viewpoint here.  Let's keep in mind that, prior to season one, it's not like everyone knew of Jessica Lange or her body of work.  The same can't be said for Kathy and Angela.  They're both veterans, amazing actresses, and big names.  At this point, with Kathy, Angela, and Sarah... I don't think there's a need to ""replace"" Jessica.  You have three phenomenal actresses right there.  In fact, with Jessica gone, the three of them will have the opportunity for better, meatier storylines.  I love Jessica and I'm sad that she's gone... but the over-glorifying her really invalidates the immense accomplishments and talents of the rest of the cast.  They'll be fine without her, I promise."

AmericanHorrorStory,39iq5t,mistar_z,10,Fri Jun 12 00:13:18 2015 UTC,"None of the characters were ""directly"" based on any real life historical figures, but many of them were inspired and influenced by others throughout time..mainly the freaks.    Elsa Mars was inspired by Marie Magdalene better known in the United States as ""Marlene Dietrich,"" but her character wasn't directly based on Dietrich.  When Ryan originally started dropping hints about Freakshow, he said that ""Jessica has always wanted to play a Marlene Dietrich type figure, and now she gets to.""  Both were aspiring actors/singers, very similar in appearance (blonde, lots of make up, & lots of feathers)..  Twisty was loosely based on John Wayne Gacey.  Both suffered from ""Peter Pan Syndrome"" (the inability to mature emotionally) and both lured children in with toys or by offering to play with them, and both suffered psychological abuse thus turning them into cold blood killers, although actor John Carrol Lynch (twisty)  said JWG's story was ""less pure in nature.""   But there are plenty of differences between Twisty and Gacy — none of Twisty’s murders seem to be sexually motivated (thank god), and Twisty targets adults, not children..more so like Pennywise the clown from Stephen Kings ""It.""  Edward Mordrake was reportedly an heir to an English peerage who had an extra face on the back of his head.  The first known description of Mordake is found in an 1895 Boston Post article authored by the fiction writer Charles Lotin Hildreth, and as ahsfreakshow mentioned, there is no real confirmation he ever existed.... His unusual case occurred too early in recorded medical history and is referenced only in tales handed down. The story of his life has become so muddled through the passage of time that no solid date of birth or death is evident to modern researchers.    Pepper was inspired by Schlitzee Surtees (who was actually a man) that was an early 1900s sideshow performer with microcephaly.  Jimmy Darling was influenced by Grady Franklin Stiles, Jr in the sense that he had ectrodactyly and was forced to become a sideshow act at a young age, later becoming an abusive alcoholic -- just like Jimmy.  *There is actually a picture of Grady, the professional ""Lobster boy,"" on the opening introduction of Freakshow. http://imgur.com/zMCa2DS  Obviously Norman Bates was a fictional figure who inspired Patrick Bateman (Christian bale in american psycho) and Dandy showed traits of both of these characters as well!  Also many of the characters shown on the opening intro were based on real life people as well.

AmericanHorrorStory,39iq5t,ahsfreakshow,5,Fri Jun 12 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"There's not enough evidence to prove he was an actual living person. There are no birth or death dates, and the first record of his story came from a fiction writer in an article published for a nonexistent scientific society. There are no photos of him either; the image you'll commonly see of him online is actually a wax rendition of what he would've looked like. So it's still open-ended as to whether or not he was real."

AmericanHorrorStory,39aup0,pailblusea,7,Wed Jun 10 19:50:33 2015 UTC,"I can't really comment much beyond the cast choices, since there isn't much else verified information.  I love that Sarah Paulson is still in it, along with Kathy Bates, Evan Peters and Angela Basset.  Gaga will be fun, I bet.  But my major dislike is, of course, the lack of Jessica Lange.  (And no confirmation from Lily Rabe!)"
AmericanHorrorStory,39aup0,ilovetorunforfun,4,Wed Jun 10 17:33:52 2015 UTC,"Well really only the title, filming location and casting choices have been revealed so there's not awhole lot to go off of but I will do my best.  Likes: the cast (never seen Max greenfield act so im hoping he's good)..I don't care much for Bomer as an actor to be honest I don't think he's that great but he will get the job done.  Im really excited to see Cheyenne Jackson, Cathy bates, evan peters and sarah Paulson in something completely new we haven't seen from them yet.  Im kind of indifferent about Gaga/Bomer/Bentley and Savigny..but like I said I think all of the cast members will do just fine as far as pulling off the roles they are given.  I also like the idea of the main setting being a hotel..I have heard that it's going to be this absolutely beautiful jaw-dropping stunning hotel..which is okay I guess but initially I was hoping for a very dark mysterious kind of rundown place that contains many secrets and awful things that have happened in there in the past...I guess this could be the case even if it's a pretty and glamorous Hotel but I was really looking forward to them going back to an asylum type vibe but within the hotel!!  Dislikes:  the idea of a ""ballroom showdown"" between Gaga and Angela Bassett.  I also dislike the idea of singing/dancing/etc.  Although im certain the writers could get away with revolving a dark-horror story around a hotel that hosts guests who are there or practicing/performing song and dance numbers, I just don't like the idea of it.  For some reason, I have this idea that angela Bassett and Gaga will both be aspiring entertainers who are good at song and dance..I have a hunch that angela will be well/known around th hotel and city they are in...but I think gaga will be the ""new sheriff in town type person"" and Angela will become jealous that gaga is stealing her shine.  I think Matt Bomer will be either a staff member/guest at the hotel or even. dancing coach..and he will work with Gaga to help get her to the top..falling in love with each other/dirty dancing style.  Angela may be tight with cathy bates who is running the hotel so they may try to run Gaga out of the hotel altogether.  Also with Cheyenne Jackson being a real life beyond  talented singer/songsWriter/dancer/musician I think he will somehow tie into that storyline as well ...IDK..maybe him and Angela are on sides while Matt Bomer and gaga are in cahoots...Again this is just my own personal theory from using context clues based on info we have been given by Ryan.  And I'm not trying to be a big complainer and say oh this is too much like glee because even the performances ok freaksHow Werent glee like  but for one I think the song and dance stuff presents a happy element to the show and kind of takes away from the dark vibe that I like so much about it..Plus I don't see why they would do something like this again after just doing so on freakshow unless Ryan is out of his mind or just flat out doesn't care what the fans want?    My expectations/hopes for the future:  *Less song/dance  *Impeccable jaw dropping acting from the casting members.  *some form of return to their early season 1&2 roots!!  *darkness.  I hope they record this season on film like they did with asylum.  When it comes to horror, FILM is the way to go.  For flashbacks/found footage stuff I hope they use some real old school  hand-crank cameras..ibjust love that dark vibe of it.  *hoping for a connection/cross over to either Murderhouse/coven..if they do end up doing this I think it would be awesome to see a recurring character from the previous mentioned seasons IR Constance and michael langon (and yes I know what you were thinking about Jessica being gone oh well I'm sure they can work something out)..maybe show Luke or Marcy..or hell maybe there's something mysterious about the hotel where the dead can enter it..like tate and the Harmons..or MAYBE tey do a 3 season crossover between hotel, Murderhouse and coven and the coven witches BRING EVERYONE IN THE MURDERHOUSE BACK TO LIFE and then go to the Hotel to have a ""Back to life partty!"" IT COULD HAPPEN! O_o haha  *Both Supernsturnstural AND psychological horror/terror/fear aspects/elements!  *FLASHBACKS...found footage..and at least ONE who dunnit situstion!!!  *stand im still hoping for a few additional casting announcements..mainly just Finn wittrock, Lily Rabe, & Denis O'Hare.  Oh yeah, I wouldn't be mad if james Cromwell, frances Conroy, Alexandra Breckenridge, Zach quinto, Eric stonestreet, Connie Britton or anyone else blew off their current projects and returned to AHS;)"

AmericanHorrorStory,395tyc,Lyco_499,4,Tue Jun 9 16:22:56 2015 UTC,haha yes. The people in this show are the absolute worst. But I love them.
AmericanHorrorStory,395tyc,mrignatiusjreily,7,Tue Jun 9 16:54:37 2015 UTC,"Voted, but I'm a bit confused by some of the option choices. No Constance, Adelaide, Fiona etc but Billie Dean Howard is included? Ah well."
AmericanHorrorStory,395tyc,mrignatiusjreily,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, I understand the confusion and how I left out some more important characters then some of the ones I put up..that is mainly because I made these polls well I was bored at work today and was doing them at red lights while I was driving..lol. I gathered my character bank from the AHS wiki site! So my bad for the confusion  EDIT: I guess it can go both ways..but wouldn't you count Constance and Fiona as more of a antagonist rather than a protagonist??"
AmericanHorrorStory,395tyc,Lyco_499,2,Tue Jun 9 17:41:34 2015 UTC,"Fiona is a villain protagonist, like Daniel Plainview, Water White(season 4 onwards) and Lorne Malvo. The story revolves around her and she drives the plot more than anyone."
AmericanHorrorStory,395tyc,Bruntaz,3,Tue Jun 9 19:34:24 2015 UTC,"True..I guess I was looking at it like she also created problems for the coven and almost tore it apart a few times (but also saved its ass ie-Madison/Zoe's incident with the police) and opposed some of the other protagonists (Cordelia fox, myrtle snow, etc) so I was looking at it s bit differently i guess!  But the way you compared it to Walter white makes ALOT of sense..the same can be said for the guys in SOA (Jax teller, chibbs, Tig, etc) they were also villain antagonists!!  Either way though, the character bank i used for the polls Werent my personal preferences..I just searched AHS antagonists and protagonists and used the names they had listed under each on the AHS wiki site!  Fair enough though;)"
AmericanHorrorStory,395tyc,TheoX747,2,Tue Jun 9 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"Regardless, she is indeed a villain and my favorite tied with Bloody Face."
AmericanHorrorStory,395tyc,mistar_z,2,Wed Jun 10 01:55:47 2015 UTC,"I guess that's true, regarding Constance. Fiona swings too far into protaganist imo though. No matter, I get an odd amount of enjoyment out of doing polls etc so I voted on all the ones you posted lol."
AmericanHorrorStory,395tyc,israeldmo,4,Wed Jun 10 12:12:55 2015 UTC,I'd say the best character has to be Dandy Mott. Paul the illustrated seal boy is a good shout as well

AmericanHorrorStory,395tyc,AlkalinePacino,0,Thu Jun 11 01:50:14 2015 UTC,Would it not allow you to do all of these polls on one page? Seems excessive and unnecessary to have all these posts if it could have been possible to do them all under one item
AmericanHorrorStory,395rup,Ey3z0nF1rE,6,Tue Jun 9 13:29:45 2015 UTC,I don't know if I'd class Jude as an antagonist but she got my vote anyway. One of my all time favourite fictional characters

She was essentially the leader of the coven and the supreme, as well as s central character who drove the plot foward..but she had many flaws and negative qualities about her that would make her considered a villainous protagonist"
AmericanHorrorStory,395rup,bacchianrevelry,3,Tue Jun 9 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"yes, being silly. I understand the difference between a main character and the hero/protagonist. I loved her though, and kinda wanted to see her and Marie win and go do amazing (though undoubtedly evil) things."
AmericanHorrorStory,395rup,bacchianrevelry,4,Tue Jun 9 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"Lol gotcha!  I was just having a conversation with another user about Her because I had caused some confusion..some people thought she should have been a protagonist and some thought the opposite!  I liked her character too..out of all of Jessica's characters Fiona was probably my favorite..she showed the most ambition and was the most powerful and strong willed...she was also funny as shit at times!  One of my favorite lines Jessica had in the whole series is when she's stuck in her own hell and she sees the walls at the house she is stuck in..""this god-damn KNOTTY PINE!!!"""

AmericanHorrorStory,395v2j,Ey3z0nF1rE,21,Tue Jun 9 13:55:48 2015 UTC,Asylum was hands down my favorite. It had an interesting story and a great twist and was (IMO) the eeriest of the seasons.
AmericanHorrorStory,395v2j,britchesss,6,Tue Jun 9 14:27:31 2015 UTC,I got to agree with you on that..I Voted asylum number 1 for the horror aspect of it and it storylines...as well as the cinematography and how dark it was overall.  I liked murder house for its characters..I also really enjoyed the characters in coven along with the whole bitchiness aspect of the show and comic relief it presented!  And as far as Freakshow I liked the setting and time era along with the colors and music/soundtrack of the show they had some decent storylines too!!!
AmericanHorrorStory,395v2j,ilovetorunforfun,10,Tue Jun 9 14:34:42 2015 UTC,Asylum.  Always Asylum.
AmericanHorrorStory,395v2j,Manthejelly,3,Tue Jun 9 14:59:25 2015 UTC,"Strange...asylum depressed me, i just didn't like the hopeless vibe. Ep after ep, i binged watched it so that might have something to do with it."
AmericanHorrorStory,395v2j,THEDUDE33,3,Tue Jun 9 18:39:52 2015 UTC,Isn't that kind of the point? I didn't watch this show to make me happy.
AmericanHorrorStory,395v2j,Manthejelly,3,Tue Jun 9 19:59:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think the point of ahs is to depress people lol, i watch it for the storyline and acting and i enjoy the horror genere....none of the other seasons had such a hopeless vibe at least thats i how i feel. Most people hold it to really high regards."
AmericanHorrorStory,395v2j,TheStarsDescent,3,Tue Jun 9 20:15:30 2015 UTC,"If it depressed you that much then I'd say the story was doing its job and doing it well.  It's a horror show - it's going to be bleak and hopeless at times (or in the case of an anthology series - for an entire season).   But as for matters of opinion... some people prefer camp horror to realistic/bleak horror.  I love both equally, but I still list Asylum as my favorite because of how engaged it kept me.  Every episode pretty much boiled down to me and my friend repeating this mantra: ""Poor Sarah Paulson.  Poor, poor Sarah Paulson.""  But that's not everyone's ideal viewing experience.  So, I get it.  :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,395v2j,LSunday,6,Wed Jun 10 12:31:28 2015 UTC,"I don't get why freak show is below Coven, honestly.  I thought coven wasn't particularly well liked, and after re watching all four seasons recently, I feel like freak show was significantly better.  (Even if not on the level of Asylum and Murder House)"
AmericanHorrorStory,395v2j,TheoX747,5,Wed Jun 10 15:47:07 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion and do not understand WHY you could possibly have been downvoted at all in any way, shape or form for what you said?!  That's what kills me about this particular reddit..it seems to be all 15-19 year old kids on here, who if they have a different OPINION about the show than someone else, it is necessary to downvote somebody!!  Im giving you a vote back up!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,395v2j,TilapiaRealness,3,Thu Jun 11 22:18:43 2015 UTC,Agreed; Freak Show really impressed me.  It got me to CARE more about the characters than any of the other seasons (though Asylum is still my favorite for other reasons).

She tells Elsa that a dark-haired impresario is coming to make her a star, and while she was referring to Stanley, Edward Mordrake ended up being summoned. She told Jimmy that his future is bright, but she's not in it. And of course, she died and he went on to live a happy life with the Tattlers. She told Desiree that she and Angus would live a long happy life together, which they did. In that same scene she said love would eventually tear them apart and ""gut them"", and ironically that happened to her, literally. She tells Dandy that there are dark clouds on the horizon, but it will pass and he will go on just as he did before. Regina threatened to get him arrested but he ended up taking care of that and he continued his reign of terror (also Dandy literally took over the freak show after that storm hit, so rain really did pass). So while Maggie wasn't actually a fortuneteller, her prediction did foreshadow later events in the story."

Sometimes even in that order. I personally loved all 4 seasons for different reasons and rate them all evenly.  It's worth watching all seasons to make your own judgement. You might love something about the series that other people either might not like or even understand.  Also worth noting that Freak Show is directly linked to Asylum but takes place a few years beforehand. You don't necessarily have to watch those in chronological order. I prefer to watch them in the order they were made."
AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,iamkentish,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:45:21 2015 UTC,Was Murder House more loved because it is the one that stayed more true to horror? It seems like Coven is more of a teenage girl show.
AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,floiancu,6,Sun Jun 7 23:48:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not a huge fan of Coven, but I kind of like the way the producers went all out exploring all genres, demographics and possibilities. It is definitely a question of taste, but in my opinion AHS caters to all tastes and all the seasons are worth watching. Another reason is the much speculated global connection of all the seasons. When the picture is complete, having all the pieces of the puzzle will be awesome."

AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,israeldmo,-1,Mon Jun 8 14:51:22 2015 UTC,"They're all true to the horror genre in some way or another. Coven and Freak show have just incorporated the campiness of modern horror, rather than the classic horror that the first 2 seasons went with.   I think the popularity for Murder House comes from the fact that it is so different to anything on TV. It's pure horror and it remained pretty unpredictable throughout. Sadly, the seasons have increased in predictability as they've progressed."
AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,iamkentish,0,Sun Jun 7 23:52:59 2015 UTC,I honestly thought Murder House was campier than Freak Show. Not necessarily a bad thing.
AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,BionicFunhouse,2,Mon Jun 8 20:06:03 2015 UTC,"I know people who agree with you. Even I do to an extent. They're probably both equally campy, but in different ways (if that even makes any sense?) Campiness and horror go perfectly together so it's definitely not a bad thing."
AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,ilovetorunforfun,6,Mon Jun 8 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly the third was by far my favorite, and the fourth was my least favorite. It depends on your tastes."
AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,HazyVision,6,Mon Jun 8 05:26:32 2015 UTC,"Asylum will always be my favorite, and I definitely recommend you watch that season first before starting Freak Show.  Otherwise, s1 and s3 can be watched independently."
AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,ilovetorunforfun,10,Mon Jun 8 12:47:41 2015 UTC,"Even my least favorite season (Coven) is really better than a lot of other horror shows on TV. So, you should watch all the seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,theonewiththev,6,Mon Jun 8 00:48:19 2015 UTC,"Was just about to say this.  For all of its faults, Coven still makes for better watching than a lot of shows.  RM decided to add more campiness to s3, then dial it back a little bit for s4."

Coven is my least favorite, but it is good, it is not really scary, but it has its special touch and amazing acting, Jessica Lange for example has a very badass role, and Kathy Bates is also amazing, the characters are original.  I think the most loved is Murder House. There is people that hates Asylum, and people that totally love it. This is my favorite over all.   I hope this is helpful for you."

And a lot of them seemed silly (Anne Frank, aliens) If they'd stuck with mainly the asylum, like they stuck to mainly the Murder house, it would have had a nicer more cohesive feel. I just rewatched it and liked it much better the second time around, but it's still my least favourite. In part because of the potential an asylum had, there was so much more they could have done with it...."

AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,TheoX747,2,Tue Jun 9 19:10:52 2015 UTC,"Generally Murder House and Asylum are seen as the best, Coven and Freak Show lag behind. Although I have to say that this is all subjective and don't let this influence you. In reality most fans liked Freak Show and Coven and many will say one of those two is their favourite. Personally my top two are Coven and Asylum.  Definitely watch season 3. As I've said Coven is one of my favourites and regardless, general consensus puts it above season 4. The thing about AHS is that every season is so different not only in terms of plot, but also in their style and tone. A lot of people dislike Coven because they see it as less horror, more teen angst. While this is true, it is still AHS, just in a different way. In fact, I'd say each season embodies a different form of horror:   Murder House is the traditional haunted house mystery Asylum is more psychological. While their are supernatural aspects to it the appeal on first watching is more 'is this actually happening or is it in their head', 'is X really Y', etc. Coven is the high school horror, more angst and teen drama but still some horror moments. Think The Craft, I Know What You Did Last Summer, etc. Freak Show's harder to place but I'd say it the closest we've had to 'torture porn' (aka all out gore). Whether it was the scariest season or not, it was certainly the gruesomest.    Basically every season is different and its all down to personal opinion. I'd give every season a go. Even if you watch the first three episodes then give up."
AmericanHorrorStory,38ypcr,chloetee,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:30:03 2015 UTC,"Im loving your analysis. I wonder what type of season will Hotel be. I predict it will return to the ""traditional haunted place""."
AmericanHorrorStory,38rhku,cosmicwhore,49,Sat Jun 6 04:40:37 2015 UTC,"Just Murder House, I would really like to know more about other ghost in the house. I think the others were perfect, of course I would want all of them to have more, but I think the stories fit perfectly in that timing."
AmericanHorrorStory,38rhku,theonewiththev,9,Sat Jun 6 04:52:28 2015 UTC,"Yes! It was clear they had other ghost ideas in mind, if they could redo it and include all the plots they wanted to it'd be so much more interesting. That house has a ton of history, you can't tell me there weren't more horrifying events happening in there."
AmericanHorrorStory,38rhku,BlueStar428,7,Sat Jun 6 19:44:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe they had enough ideas for two seasons on Murder House, but had to pare it down to one. They used their best ideas, not their only ones."
AmericanHorrorStory,38rhku,cailihphiliac,7,Sat Jun 6 21:20:15 2015 UTC,"If they left something out, it's probably because a season can only have so many episodes and somethings can't air on basic channels. So the network makes them toss stuff out. They can't have a season go on and on and on. In a hypothetical world, it would be interesting to see all the ideas Ryan Murphy had if he had the time and the free reigns to do so."
AmericanHorrorStory,38rhku,BlueStar428,71,Sat Jun 6 22:26:02 2015 UTC,I think it would've been interesting to see what happened with the school after Coven ended.

I don't know if the timeframe would've worked out but imagine if lobster boy and the bette&dot had  a daughter named Viven Darling who later on would become Vivian Harmon?!  ShE DID say her family roots were from Florida and she also had twins:.:....and with American horror story I don't rule anything out because I think with this show anything is Possible?!
AmericanHorrorStory,38rhku,Ey3z0nF1rE,-7,Sun Jun 14 05:13:28 2015 UTC,I believe it was confirmed that the doctor from freakshow was somehow related to Vivian
AmericanHorrorStory,38rhku,alazyrebellion,5,Sat Jun 6 05:16:08 2015 UTC,"Comfirmed? I know it was def a theory but I personally never heard about any confirmation!!!  BTW: are you talking about the doctor that ETheL and desiree visited?  Or are you talking about the psychoanalyst that Glorida hired to evaluate dandy?

AmericanHorrorStory,38rhku,BewilderedFingers,6,Tue Jun 9 01:05:20 2015 UTC,"Coven. It would be interesting to see what happens next while they explore its mythology a bit more. Murder House, maybe, but I think it wrapped everything up nicely and, honestly, it wouldn't make sense to see these characters again. But a whole season about the antichrist could be great."

AmericanHorrorStory,38rhku,SimeonsDilemma,23,Sat Jun 6 18:05:14 2015 UTC,The aliens are the reason Kit was involved in the story at all. They're definitely crucial to the plot.

AmericanHorrorStory,38pjck,davis98,24,Fri Jun 5 19:24:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how you can call episodes 5-9 fillers but not say the same about ""Orphans"". I get what your point is, and don't get me wrong it's my favorite episode too, but if anything ""Orphans"" was the biggest plot filler of them all and hardly advanced the story. A lot of stuff did happen in those episodes (as you mentioned, lots of deaths), so just because you personally may not have preferred them, doesn't make them invaluable to the story."
AmericanHorrorStory,38pjck,ahsfreakshow,7,Sat Jun 6 01:19:04 2015 UTC,"You have a point. I guess I just liked that it diverged from the main plot, which I felt was dragging on."
AmericanHorrorStory,38pjck,iamcarlbarker,2,Sat Jun 6 07:35:06 2015 UTC,"just because you personally may not have preferred them, doesn't make them invaluable to the story.  Essentially my sentiments. It's fine the way it is. All the deaths were to further the plot even if it was very slow meep. I think the pacing was just purposely slow- which may not be for some people. Like Orphans purpose was to create that connection to Asylum,  Frankly, this season would have been more worth the slower moments (that weren't bad, but that's my opinion) if the finale didn't give Elsa some happy ending despite her not deserving it. It was obviously written as a Swan song to Lange which is why I'm a bit happy she's gone because now it put the AHS team in a position to create a new dynamic and much needed new archetypes for their main characters. But I have since learned to this show at face value as nothing besides entertainment and camp."
AmericanHorrorStory,38pjck,bwood16,7,Sat Jun 6 13:25:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like episodes 1-5 were really good, then 6 and 7 were slow but still had some good moments), it picked up again in episodes 8 and 9, then episode 10(Orphans) was probably the best AHS episode ever, the last 3 episodes were pretty good."
AmericanHorrorStory,38pjck,Calfredo,18,Fri Jun 5 21:37:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, however, I felt like there were too many plots going on. They felt the need to make most characters all super important, which hurt it in the long run considering the characters weren't very likeable."

AmericanHorrorStory,38pjck,alo81,5,Fri Jun 5 21:36:38 2015 UTC,"I can't tell you to skip any of them, because there are a few moments that are important to the plot. Maybe just fast-forward whenever somebody is making a speech, crying, or singing."

AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,CoffeeCandle,53,Fri Jun 5 21:00:15 2015 UTC,"Here's the bit that everyone always forgets (and I don't know why because it's literally the most important line that makes sense of everything): when Cordelia is talking to Myrtle in the finale directly after Zoe dies, Myrtle realizes it's been Cordelia all along. Delia was suppressed, doubted, and ignored by everyone around her, (especially Fiona) and so, according to Myrtle, her innate abilities sought out other vessels in all of the other girls in the coven.   So you know how it seemed like Zoe, Madison, Queenie, Nan, and Misty were all somehow getting stronger at the same time? That was because they were all harboring power that wasn't really theirs; it was Cordelia's. But once the Seven Wonders came around and Fiona died, Delia started to step into that role and take her power back. That's why Misty couldn't get back from hell after descensum. That's why Zoe suddenly failed transmutation, even though she was doing just fine moments before during the game of tag. That's why Queenie suddenly could no longer perform vitalum vitalis, even though she just did it on Misty in the previous episode. These girls never could do those things, they were only able to in those moments because they were serving as placeholders for Cordelia's Supreme abilities, which were slowly but surely making their way back into their rightful host."
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,ahsfreakshow,13,Sat Jun 6 01:26:33 2015 UTC,"I wish, I wish, with all my heart, that there was a way to broadcast this message to everyone who watched Coven.

AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,SimeonsDilemma,5,Sat Jun 6 21:34:44 2015 UTC,"Along with any and all Moira questions, please."
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,signu1230,0,Sat Jun 6 22:19:30 2015 UTC,That's not fair. I still don't understand why Moira aged ...while everyone else who died in the house stayed the age they died.
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,Supreme000,8,Sun Jun 7 14:20:13 2015 UTC,"Moira doesn't age. She has two appearances, but she doesn't age. None of the ghosts do. Moira's older appearance refers to her ""old soul""/the multi-faceted nature of her character. There's more to her than meets the eye. She's not just a sexy maid. During the course of the show, Moira talks with Vivien about literature and medicine. That's not something that just any maid would know about. Despite being pretty, Moira is also intelligent. Early on in the show, she tells Vivien that women see the true essence of a person, who they really are, and that men just see what's on the outside. The reason Moira has that second appearance is because she's more complicated than most of the female characters on the show. If you look at a lot of the women, their through-lines are pretty easy to follow. Constance wants a picture-perfect family and resents the world for not getting it. Hayden is the scorned mistress. Vivien is the wronged wife. Violet hates everyone and everything. Nora is a stuck-up socialite. None of these ideas are all that complex, so they get that simple characterization, that one ""appearance."" Moira works in shades of gray, which gives her the dual images and looks people see her by. When a person dies in Murder House, their essence/soul is preserved. Usually that includes their appearance. But since Moira was more than just a pretty face, her apparition has more mystery to it."
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,signu1230,3,Sun Jun 7 17:51:47 2015 UTC,Ooooh. That makes sense. Moira was never just a dumb pretty maid...she was highly intelligent also. An old soul so to speak. Thanks for explaining it.
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,Supreme000,5,Sun Jun 7 23:35:30 2015 UTC,I can't believe I missed that. I want to watch it again now. That's pretty amazing.
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,Kattastrophe,7,Sat Jun 6 06:53:21 2015 UTC,"I'd say Misty just couldn't get back because she was weak.  And Madison was never shown to be able to preform divination, but after Cordelia came into herself, Madison wasn't even able to light her cigarette (pyrokenisis being a power she developed within the show)."
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,LoganK36,2,Sat Jun 6 01:40:08 2015 UTC,Didn't they say in the show that the reason the coven was getting stronger was because there were so few witches left and so much danger surrounding them at the time that they all gained extra abilities as a sort of defense mechanism?
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,Gliiitterpop,3,Sat Jun 6 19:48:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, Cordelia did suggest that their powers spike during times of crisis. But following that logic, you would expect them all to be most powerful during the Seven Wonders, since that was when the coven was Supreme-less. And the opposite happened: all of the girls either died or got weaker. So perhaps that was just Cordelia's theory to make sense of it, and so it may not necessarily be true."
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,ahsfreakshow,2,Sat Jun 6 20:36:26 2015 UTC,Zoe didn't fail transmutation.  Madison said if Zoe was brought back she'd still be competing in the wonders.  It's more like Zoe was hit by a car after passing her driver's test.  She still passed and can still drive... If she were alive to do it.
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,LSunday,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:00:34 2015 UTC,"Your metaphor doesn't really apply to this situation. If you're hit by a car, it's not your fault, the blame falls on the other driver. The gate didn't magically appear in her way, she landed there because she screwed up. It was her fault. Had she been able to properly perform transmutation, she would've ended up where she intended to, not haphazardly on the gate."
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,ahsfreakshow,2,Wed Jun 10 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily.  You can be at fault in an accident and not lose your license.  She didn't die because she couldn't transmute: she died because she misused her ability.  And as both Fiona and Madison proved, being Supreme isn't based on how you use your powers: it's if she can use them at all.  But, if you want in-universe reasons, Zoe passed the test because A) Cordelia was calling for the end of the test before Zoe died: Tag was them having fun, not the test and B) If Zoe were alive she would have continued in the 7 Wonders, which means she clearly couldn't have failed transmutation."
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,LSunday,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the point of this discussion is. I feel like the only thing rubbing you the wrong way is that I'm using the word ""fail"". I think it's rather ridiculous to argue who's at fault in a car accident or whether the game of tag was considered a proper test. If we can both agree that she made a serious error while transmutating and that, regardless of how you look at it, she never was and never would be the Supreme, then all is fine."

For example, everyone knew that Madison could perform telekinesis considering that was her strong suit, but they still made her perform it on command during the Seven Wonders."
AmericanHorrorStory,38px52,MaryJaneHolland88,3,Sat Jun 6 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not totally sure, but it could be because of Misty's resurrection powers, maybe it only worked with her because she wasn't doing all of the work."

I occasionally identify with horror characters, but it's rare that I actually care about them.  I felt the same way, although to a lesser extent, about season two. I haven't seen four yet, but three didn't do it for me. It may have been because I'm a guy, but mostly I just couldn't take it seriously. It seemed a lot campier than the others to me."
AmericanHorrorStory,38n55m,Franco_DeMayo,5,Fri Jun 5 13:23:19 2015 UTC,"From the title, I was expecting the bajillionth ""why does Moira look old to women and young to men?""   And not much to say beyond AHS seasons generally end in a way that can be seen as happy, but also not. I don't know if S1 is all you've seen so I won't mention anything about other seasons, but (S1 spoiler) the Harmons all ended up dead, forever trapped in a house full of hateful, twisted ghosts. Look at it this way and it isn't very happy. But they're all together, they're finally happy and they love each other. So it's a mixed bag imo."
AmericanHorrorStory,38n55m,Lyco_499,2,Fri Jun 5 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a few episodes into season 2, so I appreciate not spoiling it :)  But yeah, that's why I say it ends happy-ish. Like you said, they're dead and all, but it's almost a ""better"" ending for them than if just the dad had gotten out. Plus, I had a good laugh at them scaring the new family out of it :)"

AmericanHorrorStory,38mhkv,ddddamn,5,Fri Jun 5 04:16:09 2015 UTC,Just gonna co-sign on the OP.  This is a really good show that takes some of our classic horror imagery and turns it on its head.    Some very good acting from some well known (as well as not so well known) artists helps sell it and keeps me coming back every week.  Also . . . Rose.
AmericanHorrorStory,38mhkv,Sparklebutt69,3,Fri Jun 5 08:07:52 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say there are two things that keep me watching. The first being that Penny Dreadful's acting is SUPERB, especially Eva Green's, she definitely creeps me out a lot, which is intentional, of course.  The second...ROSE.

The setting could be 1920s--1940s Oregon..the villain lives in a cabin in the woods outside of s remote village with a population of 50-60 people and the children..also festures an old witch/fortune teller/clairvoyant type woman who tries to warn the people of the town..maybe she is the villains mother and the townspeople don't know?  Add some relationship turmoil inside the town..accusations of people abdicating the children..kind of a whodunnit deal..maybe even throw a deranged serial killer somewhere in there..but make him:her the person Everybkdy least suspects...the villain could have once been a decent young man who was wrongfully accused of kidnapping and molestation..so they burned his cabin down and beknownst to everyone he actually survived..baring an appalling and gruesome face..to shameful to show..so he murders the children's family before capturing the kids and keeling them for his own company in an underground cellar near his cabin.. A select group of townspeople team up to get the kids back..while another village short on supplies attempts to take over the village near the cabin..so there is a civil war deal going on along with the main villain..the clairvoyant and problems within the small community!!

Other interesting themes I would like to see in a season:   Camping   These season could include serial killers and lake monsters to frighten everyone. There could be some romantic stuff too with a couple that meet while camping.   Hospital   I think it would be GREAT if it was something like the user ilovetorunforfun described. But everything happening in a hospital, obviously. With some misterious doctors and nurses.   War   Something about concentration camps, people being mutilated or being used as guinea pigs for war experiments.   Movie set    This last one (MY PERSONAL FAVOURITE) could be about the shooting of a horror movie in which the set (and also the actors, producers etc) starts being ""affected"" by the things that were supposed to happen only in the movie. I really like this theme, it could be really interesting."

AmericanHorrorStory,38jwy2,Aus23,3,Mon Jun 15 15:53:00 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think they'll probably do a school, town, and a theater.  The school could have myths like Bloody Mary, or more on Tate's shooting. It could also have one of those creepy pedophile teachers by bringing on Pablo Tell Schreiber.  The town would be based on Glasgow or Chelsea, (but of course in America) and have lots of Chelsea smiles, possibly a possessed mayor played by Lily Rabe or Angela Bassett. Taissa Farmiga would be a great innocent girl to be in trouble.  Theaters can just be old and creepy, but what if the shows were cursed? Musicals would be a great way to incorporate song. Actors to play actors could be Finn Wittrock, Lizzie Brocheré, and if she'll PLEASE COME BACK Jessica Lange."

AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,rammaam,7,Wed Jun 3 15:35:13 2015 UTC,Ghosts. It'll need lots of dead people. The 1920s have a lot of cool clothing fashions too- the flapper dresses and hair style.
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,abnorml1,8,Wed Jun 3 15:37:53 2015 UTC,And have Al Capone (or a crime boss based on him) involved?  That would be bad ass.
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,SailorDeath,14,Wed Jun 3 13:58:44 2015 UTC,I'd love to see an AHS season take place during the colonial times.  We got a little of that with some of the flashbacks in Coven but a whole season would be kinda cool.
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,S31A,10,Wed Jun 3 13:42:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it takes place in LA, so, I think colonial times might be too far back (I think it officially became a part of the US in the mid-1800s), but as far as a dream plot, that'd be neat!"
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,Ey3z0nF1rE,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:22:34 2015 UTC,No it doesn't take place in LA. It is being filmed there. They haven't said anything about where it will take place.
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,S31A,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:51:26 2015 UTC,"Actually, yes they have.  When asked about the show moving filming location from NOLA to LA they said it was  creative reasons, & not economic factors, that were the deciding key since Hotel‍ '​s story is connected to the city.  So maybe not 100% confirmed that LA is the location, but at least confirmed that LA is connected to the Hotel story."
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,mikewoj,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:47:14 2015 UTC,"There is just no way they'd have the central location be Los Angeles again when there are so many other cities with rich histories in the United States. Murder House admiteddly didn't explore the history too well, but still. I guess we'll just have to wait and see."
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,rammaam,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:35:36 2015 UTC,"I would love to see a future season take place far back in time, like colonial times as you mentioned or perhaps the 1800s. I think the scariest scenes in Covens were the flashbacks to Delphine in the 1830s. For this season, I think colonial times would be a bit too far back with the theme being hotel, though."

The vibrant fashions and colors would be an interesting contrast to the macabre subject matter, especially with Lady Gaga making an appearance.

AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,BasketeerOverHere,4,Thu Jun 18 18:00:25 2015 UTC,"i think 1900-1920 would be awesome. In Arizona theres an old western mining town called Bisbee, and theres an old Hotel, Copper Queen Hotel, that was built 1898. Was quite a popular Hotel, President Teddy Roosevelt stayed there. Been there a few times, considered haunted, has some creepy vibes. would love something like that!"
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,AHSHotel,3,Wed Jun 3 19:05:33 2015 UTC,"My guess is it will be present day. Ryan Murphy has revealed they're alternating between past (1900s) and present (set in the day they're filming). This would be one set today, since Freak Show was in the 50s. However, they also always have flashbacks to a different time setting, and those will likely be in the 1900s as they seem to be continuing through the seasons. Murder House had flashbacks to the 1920s, Coven's relevant flashbacks (not general witch hunt or slavery info) was closer to the 1940s and 50s, so the flashbacks will probably be to the later 20th century when the Hotel Cecil (a likely setting built in 1926) was renovated."
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,BasketeerOverHere,3,Wed Jun 3 18:19:26 2015 UTC,I'd like it to be in the 1950's like Freakshow. There was just something with that era that makes it so much more creepy.
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,S31A,3,Wed Jun 3 18:43:19 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking 60's, Psycho era, with appropriate music, similar to season 1's. I've missed that score. However, I can see how that setting has become a little saturated, with Asylum, Freak Show, and Murder House all having parts there."
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,Ey3z0nF1rE,2,Wed Jun 3 20:09:03 2015 UTC,"I would love to see the season take place in the 1920s. Alternatively, I think the Hotel setting could really make good use of Murder House's formula. It takes place in present day, but with flashes in each episode to the treacherous things that happened in the past. Haunted with ghosts from different time periods."

AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,BasketeerOverHere,5,Wed Jun 3 14:42:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's an infallible rule or anything. IIRC, someone involved said they think it will be in present day, because of the odd seasons pattern, but nothing has been confirmed."
AmericanHorrorStory,38d5qf,Ey3z0nF1rE,2,Wed Jun 3 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"Ryan Murphy did say they planned on continuing the alternation. Also, I'm embarrassed to ask and new to reddit, but what does IIRC mean?"

Yet millions base everything from school homework to corporate presentations using facts and figures they have gleaned from the site.  A study into, specifically, company information on the massively popular website discovered 60 per cent of articles had factual errors.

Fiona spit in the cops' water and made them drink whatever magic she was putting in them to make them obey. That's not quite Concilium; as we saw in the finale, the girls didn't spit in any drinks to get each other to slap themselves or pull their hair. But you are right, her spit did whatever it did to leave a long-term effect on those cops. I suppose Fiona could have done that to get a higher dosage."

AmericanHorrorStory,37mg8i,whatevskiesyo,3,Fri May 29 08:09:03 2015 UTC,Jessica Lange is made for the stage. I saw her in The Glass Menagerie as Amanda Wingfield back in 2007 and she was incredible. It was a perfect role for her and despite some of the cast being less than great (mostly because Brits doing Southern accents are hilarious) it was one of the best stage productions I've ever seen. Mostly because of Jessica. She owns the stage.

Nuclear testing/radiation victims, spies and intrigue, plotlines about the moon landing/a secret apollo mission.  Gravity-esque horror.  Government psychological experiments.  AHS: Campground  Pretty basic setting, but given AHS's fondness of using tropes one that we're likely to see eventually.  I'm also just going to call the new campy show AHS: Sorority in my head."

We've seen a lot of corruption in the past three seasons (Asylum- Monsignor Timothy being corrupted by Arden; Coven- Fiona obsessed with her power as the Supreme; FS- Dandy bribing the Officer), so why not a whole season of it?  Another theme to add is Disorientation. Much like insanity, the slaves are overworked or drugged to sedation, impairing their judgement and making it difficult to resist their owners."

This could present then with a bunch of great options as far as storylines go.  The complex could be ran by a crooked staff/military officers/MPs and I would like it to be in the middle 1900's so let's say right after the 2nd world war -1947/1948- Include a couple of nuns/priests..some are good, some are bad. The facility would be made up of different ranges, pods/dorms, include a death row, a secret/hidden torture chamber in an underground shelter..it could have tormented souls of past military personnel and their famiies...all of the places used to execute inmates who were on death row; gas chamber, shooting range, electric chair, the hangmans spot, etc.  Fill the compound with prisoners of war, awol military guys who got caught, terrible inmates, innocent inmates, etc.  Mainly focuses on a cruel staff, some supernatural spirits from the past, terrible criminals/prisoners of war, etc.  Another possibility could be some type of Satanic church or organization/church that is really a cult of some type...i'm imagining an isolated facility possibly somewhere in the desert...an old rundown building that is used as a meeting house to build the call fallowing and carry out all of their rituals/sanctions...it could also include a ghost town.  As far as outdoor venues go..maybe focus on a group of 5-7 people who set out on a camping trip for hiking trip somewhere in the Rural Mountains..they could have a cabin in the woods type approach with a serial killer on the loose or some creatures that they make up for their own story..I also like the idea of a group of people being stranded on an old rundown island that is mysterious and contains lots of secrets..I don't know Ryan is absolutely brilliant when he thinks these things up so I'm sure he could take just about any setting and make it interesting with a little bit of creativity and imagination!"

At least there's no ""zomg Dandy and Thredson are the same person"" ridiculous claims, I can definitely settle for them being half-brothers after reading the reasons for it.   (Though I still don't agree with the Montgomery theory. Charles can't be a warlock if he's a ghost after his death.)"
AmericanHorrorStory,375hwf,ahsfreakshow,3,Mon May 25 03:40:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd be very surprised if the Dandy theory wasn't true."
AmericanHorrorStory,375hwf,davis98,2,Mon May 25 15:22:25 2015 UTC,"Was it ever established that witches/warlocks can't be ghosts? I can't remember exactly. I think the Montgomery theory seems legit, too many coincidences to not be imo.  On the other hand, Massachusetts and Jack Colquitt seem like just that to me; coincidences"
AmericanHorrorStory,375hwf,AlfieBoheme,2,Mon May 25 18:03:46 2015 UTC,"It wasn't stated outright, but it can be easily inferred. Fiona, Madison, Misty, and so on all died in the house but never reappeared as ghosts, instead their souls were sent to hell. Spalding and the Axeman, two mortals, were the only ghosts in the academy. So it's implied that witches don't become ghosts. Granted Coven was all over the place with their mythology (that season had ghosts, zombies, and souls trapped in hell) so who knows.  Regardless of the warlock thing, the Montgomery thing just doesn't make much sense to me. Montgomery is an extremely common last name, just like Howard (Billie Dean and Monsignor Timothy both share that name, but no one ever mentions them). And Charles and Nora only had one child, Thaddeus, who died, so if they are related it's probably some ridiculous brother's-nephew's-cousin-twice-removed relation that would just be pointless IMO."
AmericanHorrorStory,375hwf,ahsfreakshow,1 point,Mon May 25 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"I could see it happening. If I remember, the deaths in Coven may have been shaped by their cause of death. Fiona, Misty and Nan went to hell because they were sent there (Fiona made a deal, Nan was collected as a soul and Misty died in hell). Madison complicates that but perhaps Fiona did something to prevent her from coming back? Or maybe the negative energy that produces ghosts is not as strong in the Roubichoux (sp?) academy and that's why we don't see her; Spaulding couldn't leave the attic and needed others to help him and the Axeman was stuck there but could not make physical contact like the ghosts in Murder House. Madison may not have been able to come back because the energy wasn't allowing her to and her spirit or soul was not as strong as others meaning she couldn't come back.   The mythology is really loose in Coven as you've said, but it's not impossible that they are related. If Charles was able to bring a dead child back through pure science then surely this would be a more common well known thing by the time of Coven? Or even Murder House? If it was possible, and so easy that a deranged doctor could do it then how have greater scientific minds, like say Arden, not figured it out? With the location connection, their similarities in appearance (hair colour) and name, I think it makes perfect sense that he could have been a witch. Maybe Necromancy was his gift (like many of the girls manifest), and without anyone to come collect him he was left experimenting. To a scientific mind like his own, the idea of magic and necromancy must have felt alien so his delusions (which we see he has) make him believe that it is science, not magic, he is performing."
AmericanHorrorStory,375hwf,AlfieBoheme,5,Mon May 25 19:53:43 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, there's a certain threshold a house has to reach in order for those who have died to be preserved as ghosts.  In other terms, there is the requirement of ""at least X number of terrible things/deaths have to happen and this house will be irrevocably changed into a haunted house.""  Considering Charles and Nora (the first owners and the family the house was originally BUILT for) were ghosts, that means running the underground abortion clinic helped them reach that threshold even before their murder/suicide.  We only saw bits and pieces of the past of Miss Robichaux's Academy, but it's possible that not enough death/tragedy happened in the house to cause all spirits to be permanently trapped in the house.  Someone who dies can become a ghost if they have unfinished business.  The Axeman was enraged at being tricked by the witches when he ""fairly"" warned the town of his demands and Spaulding was unhappy at being separated from Fiona.  I think they were able to preserve their spirits by refusing to fully accept their deaths.  Let's assume Charles is an undiscovered warlock.  Even if he was unaware of his own talents, we've seen magic in Coven be almost equal parts of knowledge and intent.  Even though Madison and Zoe didn't really have any idea what they were doing, they were still able to bring Kyle back from the dead.  That's two witches who have been in the academy for all of eight minutes.  Charles had to go through medical school and training.  That's at least SOME knowledge of how the human body works.  Distraught with grief and most definitely tripping balls on his addiction du jour, he may have been able to work some severely messed-up resurrection magic."

That said, Murphy changed his vision part way through. He originally had zero desire for the seasons to be connected, and stated so. Then it took off online and he rolled with it and now he says they are. Also, each season theme has been predicted online months in advance.  The creators are very active in the online community surrounding their show. I like that, but it also leads to things like all this."

When we know more details about the plot and the time periods involved, it will be more fun to guess what historical people they may use (if they do use any); at this point it's just as likely that they'll use Abraham Lincoln. Also keep in mind that Naomi probably doesn't know any actual story details since so far she isn't involved. She's just speculating like we are, don't read too far into what she's guessing at."

Thanks for the reply!!!  Or what if they put a spin on the HH HOLMES storyline, but based Sarah Paulsons character off of holmes!  A female carrying out his actions..wether shes a copycat or just a remake of the original!  Now that would make her the baddest bad girl of them all!!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,374fqb,ahsfreakshow,4,Sun May 24 22:09:01 2015 UTC,"I personally think that they'd do someone based off of Holmes and not necessarily Holmes himself, otherwise they're locked into a time period and location and that could restrict the story. Then they could do something like make Sarah the killer, which is an extremely likely possibility.   There's actually more characters inspired by historical figures than there are actual historical figures on the show (Oliver Thredson and Ed Gein, Lana Winters and Nellie Bly, R. Franklin and Richard Speck, Grace Bertrand and Lizzie Borden, Dr. Arden and Josef Mengele, Elsa Mars and Marlene Dietrich, Twisty and John Wayne Gacy, Jimmy Darling and Grady Stiles, Pepper and Schlitzie, and countless others that I can't really think of at the moment)."

I did know a lot of the character basis' that you mentioned with the exception of Lana being based on Nellie Bly..never heard of her.  I'll have to look her up.  Same goes for Josef Mengele and Lizzie Borden!  How did you acquire all of that information?  Was it something you dug up yourself or did the creators of the show mention it at some point?  Either way, thank you for sharing!  And I also agree that it would be better to base a charafter off of HH holmes rather than actually including him in the story, because, as you mentioned that would limit the show to the 1860-late 1890's Chicago time era!  I really hope they shock us this year and give us the best/scariest season to date!  Follow up:  @AHSFREAKSHOW..I found a few more interesting tidbits to share!  You mentioned Lana winters was based on Nellie Bly! (Lana was also loosely based on Shakespear's Hamlet, in the sense Hamlet feigned madness in order to speak freely and gain revenge!)! Did you know that Jack Nicholsons character, Randle PAtrick McMurphy in ""One flew over the Cuckoos nest,"" was also based on Nellie Bly who was also widely known for her record-breaking trip around the world in 72 days!  After researching her Wiki-page, I am highly intrigued by this woman and strongly encourage others to read more about her..she had an interesting life to say the least!!"

AmericanHorrorStory,374fqb,cailihphiliac,4,Tue May 26 01:39:05 2015 UTC,"Elisa Lamm?  With the camera footage where it apprears she is talking to somebody, and if I remember correctly she even looked like she was trying to hide at one point while on that elevator!!  This occurred at the Cecil Hotel in LA (LA is the town they are shooting in this year, still no confirmation on the season 5 setting however). Cecil hotel was also rumored to be one of the black dahlias last known locations..there are a number of startling similarities between her story  -- and Elisa Lam's."
AmericanHorrorStory,3726zq,Supreme000,17,Sun May 24 04:15:07 2015 UTC,No because sister Jude had real legs..not prosthetic ones like Elsa was given!!! If anything at all it would be more likely in my opinion that they are twin sisters if we were going to go that route..but I probably wouldn't look too much into that either!!
AmericanHorrorStory,3726zq,Ey3z0nF1rE,0,Sun May 24 04:38:26 2015 UTC,"I thought that too. The legs. The only time they really show Sister Jude's legs is when she is singing ""The Name Game"". But that was just a dream. Also, there are many scenes of Else with a short dress on and her legs look real too. I'm keeping an open mind to it. It could be possible."
AmericanHorrorStory,3726zq,StalkingInsanity,6,Sun May 24 04:58:08 2015 UTC,"No, that's not the only time... And Elsa died in 1960, at that time Jude was already a nun."
AmericanHorrorStory,3726zq,Ey3z0nF1rE,-2,Sun May 24 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced Mordrake killed Elsa. He don't take anyone who don't fit the profile...and he told Elsa ""You don't belong with us"". I don't think he stabbed her. No wound...no blood. You could see Twisty's wound and blood.  I think she may have had a heart attack and fell."

Something like, ""you can't run from who you are"".  That's why I try to remember, and consider everything. Because if I don't, I'll miss the point when he does show the connection. Just like I didn't remember Arden cut off Shelley's legs too. So much to remember. LOL."
AmericanHorrorStory,3726zq,LSunday,9,Sun May 24 13:47:38 2015 UTC,"Jude at one point goes on a long, drunken rant about a squirrel dying. She does it in a very distinctly American accent and includes her mother calling her Judy. Elsa may have been a good actress at times, but I doubt she'd drunkenly slip into an American accent and tell a story that's completely contrary to her actual past (at least not at that particular moment).  At most I'd be willing to bet that she has a doppelganger and that Pepper latched on to her as a familiar face. Sister Jude liked loyalty and having power over people, so she may well have encouraged Pepper's enthusiasm about her.  Also, Jude started drinking super heavily because her husband left her after an STD he gave her made her infertile. Elsa and her husband were both screwing a bunch of other people and each expressed no interest in having kids.   They each may have lied about even more than we saw on screen, but their personalities and confessed time lines don't match up from what I've seen.   The single noteworthy throwback I saw was that Elsa was apparently far too much of a fan of Sign of the Cross"

AmericanHorrorStory,3726zq,Ey3z0nF1rE,0,Sun May 24 04:58:21 2015 UTC,"It's called writing retroactively, and all writers do it.  Murphy is a very skilled writer, but he wasn't sitting around planning Freakshow when Murder House was written.  There are fun references, motifs, and character references he puts in every season.  Jessica Lange always played ruthless characters yearning for glamor and power.  They're not all the same person; Ryan Murphy just knew fans of the show would notice references, and certain aspects of characters are even more interesting when looked at through the lens of what the same actor did in a previous season.  There is coincidence in the world.  It's like the people who think Elsa calling the freaks 'Monsters' was an explicit reference to Gaga being in Hotel."
AmericanHorrorStory,3726zq,Ey3z0nF1rE,2,Wed May 27 16:33:19 2015 UTC,"I can believe that while Ryan was writing Murder House, that Freakshow had not entered his story yet. However, ever since he said the seasons are connected, I do believe he is possibly putting things in purposely. He's said he has season 6 already in his mind.  I have to believe ""monsters"" was deliberate towards Gaga. A little too obvious. Even when Elsa first said it, I thought of Gaga. Ironic, Gaga signs on for the next season.  I completely agree with you that there are coincidences in the world."

AmericanHorrorStory,36sr9a,frenchieRU,8,Thu May 21 23:25:06 2015 UTC,"Related is the key word there. They definitely fluff it up, which I believe is the worry with the new show.

AmericanHorrorStory,36sr9a,clwestbr,3,Fri May 22 02:10:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, but there's a difference between a show like AHS and one like ACS. Besides, the writers of The People vs. Larry Flynt are responsible for the writing so I highly doubt that."

AmericanHorrorStory,36sr9a,clwestbr,1 point,Mon May 25 01:31:13 2015 UTC,"To be completely honest, this doesn't make sense to me. He did very few straight dramas that are somehow based on true events. Most of his shows/movies are comedies or have a very thin line between reality and fantasy. Actually, The Normal Heart, Eat Pray Love and possibly ACS are the exceptions."

Lol  But to answer your question this is Ryan's other project he is working on besides American horror story and scream queens..Think of American horror story being a mini series and how it reinvents itself each year in terms of cast, setting, storyline, etc...this is the same format it is called American crime story and each year it will focus on a different true crime story from American history this year obviously is the OJ Simpson case.. Imo it is at least worth watching the premere!!  Ryan is a good writer and always uses a group of good writers/directors/producers and cast..and since it is based on actual crime stores and real events/occurrences, I don't see how it could be that bad.  However, if you know you are not interested in the OJ case..the show probably won't interest you..if for season 2 they did, a charles Manson story or something and that's something that draws your interest than you will probably like it.  It all comes down to (imo) the story thy are focusing on and the cast they are using!!!"

I wanna scare some people.

AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,Whedonculous,20,Thu May 21 16:04:47 2015 UTC,I can't agree with you about Tate being a hero.
AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,bwood16,11,Thu May 21 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't really assign the word ""hero"" to a rapist/murderer.  I do agree that there's some similarities between characters the same actors play, most notably everyone complaining that Jessica Lange always plays an elitist bitch with a cigarette.  I forget exactly where I read it, but the writer of an AHS review/article referred to Evan Peters as ""the perpetual fuck-up with a heart of gold.""  I think that's more apt."
AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,signu1230,25,Thu May 21 19:13:08 2015 UTC,"Calling Tate part of the Hero archetype is waaaaay too much of a stretch for me, given that he's the primary villain of season 1 and violet's entire storyline is about seeing through her infatuation with him."
AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,LSunday,4,Thu May 21 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"I think a huge theme that continues to play in the series is women being oppressed by men. Murder House, Vivien is oppressed by her cheating untrusting husband. Violet is manipulated by sociopath. Moira is seen as nothing but a sex object. In Asylum we see Jude oppresed by Monsignor Timothy Howard, Shelly by her husband and the Dr. Arden. Lana and Bloodyface. Coven we see this more with the witch hunters and to a certain extend the axe man. Papa Legba towards Marie Laveau. Lastly in Freakshow we see Dandy control not only his mother but also Bette and Dot. Dell with Ethel and Desiree. Also the way Stanley manipulates Elsa. There are also smaller examples throught the series like the Black Dahlia, Sister Mary Eunice (to some extend), Misty Day, Madison, Kaylee."
AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,nativveson,3,Thu May 21 22:12:29 2015 UTC,"Eh I think you're possibly on to something but some of the examples you gave are a bit of a stretch. Let me explain.   Tate trying to escape death by falling in love with Violet   I don't think this was ever stated as his intention. I think he just genuinely fell in love with Violet while being dead. I don't think it was ever said that by loving someone alive he could somehow become alive himself.    Kyle trying to escape life (being undead and such) in coven   Kyle actually died in the bus accident. He didn't willingly die as a means of becoming an undead. I don't think he was trying to escape life necessarily.   Again, I think you're on to something because I, too, have considered the whole archetype connection. I think two of your cases make sense but the other not so much. Just my opinion"

AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,josephdean21,3,Sat May 23 12:11:42 2015 UTC,"A metaphysical commonality between characters over the seasons is definitely a cool theory but on a more practical level it really could just be as simple as playing to the strengths of the main ensemble actors themselves.  Perhaps to RM, Sarah Paulson can depict a character that endures despite having the worst luck in the world more convincingly than say, Evan could.  I could be totally wrong, and in Hotel the aliens return and there's a moment where Evan Peters character has a flashback (or premonition) of Tate's life.  Cool AHS food for thought!"
AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,ilovetorunforfun,2,Thu May 21 17:13:50 2015 UTC,"Once I heard the seasons were connected, my immediate thought was aliens. However, I do not think they are reincarnating souls. Some of your idea definitely makes sense, but I think you are stretching a little too much with some of the connections, namely Tate being a hero, and Jaime Brewer and Naomi being the same soul"
AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,whokilledmurph,2,Thu May 21 19:57:31 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. There is certainly something going on here. Each character each season plays similar characters. Things are certainly repeating. Kathy Bates chops the head off a chicken in Coven, and Meep bites the heads off of chickens in Freakshow.  I don't think the writers are that lazy....it's being done for a reason. I thought exactly what you did. That this will end up in some alien thing....because the Alien aspect was never really explained in Asylum. Everyone complained about it saying it didn't fit in and made no sense. That's just the type of thing Ryan would pull back out later."
AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,Supreme000,1 point,Sun May 24 03:46:43 2015 UTC,"Also I think that this is not going to be some abstract conceptual connection. I think it's going to be more practical, something we're not considering.   For example Aliens as a primary plot point of Asylum was never addressed. Therefore, it's a possible plot device that could be used to connect all of the seasons in some way."

AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,JasonStevens,1 point,Fri May 22 04:18:51 2015 UTC,"Tate would be a hero in his own mind, not necessarily to the world around him. It's been a while since seeing the first season but is that not how he saw himself? Trying to be a hero to violet. Stop looking at it from the outside and put yourself in his shoes.   And as far as intent goes, we do things all the time we don't intend to. For a ghost to fall in love with someone alive, on some small level, he would have to know that that's impossible.   I'm not saying my theories are concrete But some of you on here are taking things too literally. Change it up, turn the concept into something better. I binge watched AHS in less than two weeks, except the first one, which I watched a while back. I just definitely think there are connections between certain Characters consciously and subconsciously. How and what those connections are, idk, but like I said, I don't think it's a random choice.   And btw, just because I say someone has the ""hero"" archetype about them doesn't mean that makes them a hero. I just mean it in that the characters share a certain amount of personality traits, consciously and subconsciously, that leads me to belive their are connected on a higher level. Not tryin to glorify rape for anyone who was thinking that. Cmon now."
AmericanHorrorStory,36rna9,ahsfreakshow,1 point,Thu May 28 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"I was sort of with you until you said that Nan and Pepper would be the same soul. So which is it: characters portrayed by the same actor are the same soul reincarnated, or characters with similar archetypes? And who's to decide which archetype is the common thread amongst a set of characters? Vivien and Lana were both victims of rape which led to a pregnancy, could I argue that this would be their shared archetype? But Lana is also one of Sarah's characters which all have survived, so she also belongs to that set... so then there's a conflict. This theory is too open-ended for me to subscribe to, it sounds like it's all up to individual interpretation and therefore probably not what Ryan has in mind. (Also I really don't agree with all of Evan's characters being a hero or escaping from something... wouldn't it be easier to assume that Evan's characters' archetype would be that they all revolve around monstrosity?)"

AmericanHorrorStory,36mmmu,EveryOfTheTime,10,Wed May 20 16:05:16 2015 UTC,"Every time I re-watch this trailer (and I've watched it a LOT so far), I always catch something new.  If you freeze the video around 2:33, you see the dead 1995 sorority girl in the tub.  Take a closer look.  No wounds, no visible bruises, all the blood on her dress is waist-high or lower.  This doesn't look like a murder.  Maybe death by difficult childbirth?  But she's still pretty skinny.  Even if she was pregnant, there's no way she was nine months along.  Assuming this dead 1995 sorority girl is the mother of Skyler Samuels (the girl who said ""I joined that sorority to feel close to my Mom, she died when I was really little""), then we may be looking for an avenging ex-lover or maybe best friend of the sorority girl as the killer, or maybe even a vengeful half-sibling (a la Scream 3).  Addendum:  This theory is assuming the trailer hasn't been edited at all to conceal any violence/gore.  I could be totally wrong.  Extra addendum:  Considering they later show a security guard with a bloody knife through her throat, the trailer can't have been edited too much, but you never know.  EXTRA EXTRA ADDENDUM:  Baby confirmed.  Check out 1:42 of the new video!  Doesn't really explain lack of pregnancy belly on the dead 1995 sorority girl, but a baby is definitely in play here."

Lana also wore ruby slippers during the Name Game, which hinted to witches in the Wizard of Oz.   In Coven, Fiona tells Myrtle that ""life is like a carnival"".  In Freak Show, Stanley tells Elsa that his cousin works at the Garden of Allah Hotel in LA, and Elsa also clipped the film review for ""The Garden of Allah"" in the diner."

AmericanHorrorStory,36ecnh,Ey3z0nF1rE,7,Mon May 18 21:48:54 2015 UTC,"""If I'm not mistaken, the only thing that can be considered a clue at this point were the various top hats found throughout the series. This alluded the film ""Top Hat"" which was set at a hotel. Additionally, this clue alluded to Lady Gaga's involvement, as the song ""Cheek to Cheek"" is featured in the film and is subsequently the title of the album that Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett released together. As we learn more about the season we will likely pick up on a few other clues from Freak Show (or if anybody can think of any now, let me know).""  CORRECT.  Also, in freak show Stanley and Elsa both made a reference to the garden of Allah hotel!"
AmericanHorrorStory,36ecnh,blaqkaudioxd,3,Mon May 18 20:11:15 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that this is a coincidence, but if you watch the music video to Applause, it's circus themed and it also shows Gaga inside a top hat."

I'm not sure if anyone's figured out what it is (if anything), but it may be a hint like the centaur and clown face shots.   To me, the large section of grass towards the right of the picture looks somewhat like the red devil from the previews we've seen of Scream Queens (horns and a beard). Or, when flipped upside down, the same section of grass looks a bit like a side view of a dog-like creature's face, with the white barrel-like object serving as an eye. If it is a clue, we probably won't know until Hotel."
AmericanHorrorStory,36ecnh,Ey3z0nF1rE,5,Mon May 18 22:22:07 2015 UTC,Flip the picture upside down and you will also see it as a TOPHAT!
AmericanHorrorStory,36ecnh,AlfieBoheme,2,Mon May 18 22:25:28 2015 UTC,"Garden of Allah was a big clue towards Hotel. Also I feel like it may be set during the Cold War maybe? We paired Top Hats and the Nukes as Operation Tophat but there were many references to nuclear explosions (such as the mushroom cloud pictures in the tupperware house), so maybe this is another minor clue like the references to religion in Murder House."
AmericanHorrorStory,36ecnh,nativveson,3,Tue May 19 00:05:40 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that that would have to do with an alien themed season. In Coven and Freakshow I think they hinted at it. Coven with the theremin, Cordelia's interview. All the Freakshow mushroom clouds and perhaps the Jimmy dressing up like a soldier bit. I mean they have to tie in the aliens from Asylum somehow. Most likely season 6. AHS: Roswell?"
AmericanHorrorStory,36ecnh,mommy2libras,2,Tue May 19 01:37:01 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I hope not. The whole alien thing spoiled that entire season for me.

I think all season's have hinted to showbiz to a certain extend as well. Constance, Jude, and Elsa all had dreams of being stars. Also in Coven Fiona had mentioned how she was in Los Angeles and there was no glamour left. Elsa was fixated with glamour and opulence. Maybe goes hand in hand with Hotel, Hollywood in the Golden Age?

I didn't do it because it was more of a ""look what I found"" post rather than a discussion thread. I will post it here. It's kind of long though...  No matter what season it is, I always watch the intro. I always get something new out of it with each view.  So I'm on the last episode of Coven and I caught something I never noticed before. After Evan's name you see the typical witchcraft shots and then for a split second, you see a woman walking with heels that look about 8-9 inches... Just like the shoes Lady Gaga used to wear (I think it was in the Born This Way music video or Bad Romance). I tried to get a screenshot but it goes away so freakin' fast.  Then after Kathy's name is shown, you see a woman with a black leather face cover thingy which covers half her face and has spikes on it (like the kind of thing you'd see in Hot Topic). It practically screams Lady Gaga. I was able to get a screenshot of that. Sorry for the crappy quality.  Here it is - http://imgur.com/MG6CBLG  I was wondering if this was deliberate.

For the male star I would like to see Finn come back..I think he really earned a follow up spot and deserves another shot at a second season...Id love to seem him do something different...maybe play the good guy/hero this time around!!

However, unfortunately..he has stated that he loves working for Ryan but he sees more movies in his future than television shows.  And with each new season of AHS taking up 6 months of the year, that kinda limits what he can do and ties his schedule up!  It's a big commitment.  Kudos to paulson, evans, bassett and the others who pull it off each yesr and still maintain theI availability to work on other projects at the same time.  It would be cool to see John Travolta get sucked into the AHS world, even if only for a guest appearance once he finishes up ""the people vs. oJ simpson,"" for Ryan."

He looks one way and it's like a gardening claw type thing...when he looks the other way, you can see a toy shopping cart with the dolls in it.   I always kinda thought the scene with Kathy cutting the chickens head off was a clue. The dress she was wearing looked like a clown dress. I understand it was supposed to be from that period in time, but I don't think anybody's sleeves have ever been that puffy."
AmericanHorrorStory,36dr7a,ccarsonberry,2,Wed May 20 00:29:14 2015 UTC,"Someone posted a long time ago after Ryan said all seasons are connected. They pointed out if you look at the characters, they've all kinda played the same role in each season. Evan Peters was a poor misunderstood character who was dead in Murder House. He was a poor misunderstood character in Asylum. He got cut up and turned into a zombie in Coven. He was a poor misunderstood character in Freakshow who ended up getting his hands cut off.  Sarah Paulson's characters have all been the underdog...who rose up. Twice ending up on TV...and in Murder House she was to get a TV show.   Lily Rabe's characters have been good women who can't seem to catch a break.   Jessica Lange characters have all be strong women.   Denis O'Hare is always twisted or maimed in some way. Murder House face burnt.....Coven, tongue cut out.... Freakshow, a large ..well you know.   So could the ending of Freakshow be a huge hint. Elsa ends up dying and going to Freakshow. Her happiest place.   Anyway, someone posted that, suggesting will this all end up a type of reincarnation type thing. They have all relived some of the same things they went through in the previous season. That we are seeing the same people in different lives each season.   It was a very interesting theory if you think about it."

AmericanHorrorStory,36amsc,fatfoot2,39,Sun May 17 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"I think it's something to do with kits (alien) children healing/correcting her.  Think back to Pepper..we know her bsckstory from Freakshow..we see her at the asylum with her mental disorder due to being microcephalic ..then the aliens abduct her and when she returns she is corrected and extremely intelligent.  I think the same thing happened to Jude  EDIT: sorry, I didn't see ""mixedWithFruits"" reply until after my response.  So yeah..his answer or mind should work!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,36amsc,Ey3z0nF1rE,2,Mon May 18 00:35:37 2015 UTC,i'm sorry I've seen it all but i don't remember smart pepper please tell me more or a link to something so i can remember!

AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,fatfoot2,47,Sun May 17 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"Old Moira: ""I'm not naive to the ways of men. Their need to objectify, conquer. They see what they want to see. Women, however, see into the soul of a person."""
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,rammaam,7,Sun May 17 14:58:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, by the end he sees her as the old woman, and she says something about how he's finally beginning to understand."
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,kissmyleaf420,64,Sun May 17 22:35:55 2015 UTC,"Tate also has no bullet holes.  I feel that all the dead in the house look convenient for the story.  Tate looks normal, no bullet holes so Violet thinks he's alive.  Moira is aged, but not around Dr. Harmon and her eye is only white when she's aged (btw, Frances Conroy has a glass eye).  Hayden looks dead and dirty (but only sometimes and only slightly).  Nora has a hole in the back of her head which we only see for shock value.  I don't think it's really fully explained, but I took it as the ghosts have some control over their appearance but only to the extent that they maintain it for their psyche and story.  As in Tate can't have bullet holes because he doesn't remember what he did.  Nora can't see her bullet hole so why get rid of it?  Hayden, needs to look attractive, but also kinda dead at the same time to piss off Dr. Harmon.  The gay couple need everything nice and tidy and happy family looking so no bullet holes there either. And Moira obviously changes her look depending on situation and who is looking at her."
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,CurlyPants,18,Sun May 17 13:25:23 2015 UTC,"Definitely a valid assessment.   Also according to a couple things I just found from a Google search, Frances has had eye surgery but doesn't have a glass eye."
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,ILOVEBOPIT,2,Sun May 17 18:20:56 2015 UTC,Oh I knew it was something like that.  If you see pictures of her normally you can see there's something off about her eye.
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,CurlyPants,3,Sun May 17 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"I always took it as the ghosts can alter their appearance depending on whether or not they recognize/accept that they're dead.  Tate not only manages to cover up his bullet wounds, but he also has different outfits over the course of the season.  Hayden grew to accept her death which is why her appearance changed gradually.  Those who don't accept their deaths are stuck in the forms they had at the time of their passing.  Examples:  the ginger twins, Larry's wife and daughters, the nursing students killed by R. Franklin, among others."
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,signu1230,1 point,Mon May 18 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's kinda what I was trying to get at.  I don't think I did a good job.  Although it's not totally consistent.  Tate didn't seem to accept his death, but was hiding it the most, but in part he was hiding it from himself.  Whereas say Nora, there was no change, and yet she was completely oblivious to her own death."
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,CurlyPants,2,Mon May 18 20:33:08 2015 UTC,"I think Tate accepts his death, but he doesn't accept the events that led up to it."
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,LSunday,1 point,Wed May 27 17:10:43 2015 UTC,Well the gay couple where beaten and drowned. Not shot. So they wouldn't have bullet holes
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,LordDVanity,1 point,Thu May 21 23:47:56 2015 UTC,they were shot once they were dragged into the basement. Made to look like a murder suicide
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,vulgarx,1 point,Wed May 27 03:24:40 2015 UTC,Oh right. Forgot about that
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,LordDVanity,28,Wed May 27 08:40:27 2015 UTC,"Moira doesn't age. She has two appearances, but she doesn't age. None of the ghosts do. Moira's older appearance refers to her ""old soul""/the multi-faceted nature of her character. There's more to her than meets the eye. She's not just a sexy maid. During the course of the show, Moira talks with Vivien about literature and medicine. That's not something that just any maid would know about. Despite being pretty, Moira is also intelligent. Early on in the show, she tells Vivien that women see the true essence of a person, who they really are, and that men just see what's on the outside. The reason Moira has that second appearance is because she's more complicated than most of the female characters on the show. If you look at a lot of the women, their through-lines are pretty easy to follow. Constance wants a picture-perfect family and resents the world for not getting it. Hayden is the scorned mistress. Vivien is the wronged wife. Violet hates everyone and everything. Nora is a stuck-up socialite. None of these ideas are all that complex, so they get that simple characterization, that one ""appearance."" Moira works in shades of gray, which gives her the dual images and looks people see her by. When a person dies in Murder House, their essence/soul is preserved. Usually that includes their appearance. But since Moira was more than just a pretty face, her apparition has more mystery to it."
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,signu1230,10,Sun May 17 17:02:19 2015 UTC,hence why Moira is my favourite AHS character thus far. She's just that bit more complex.
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,electricAquarius,2,Sun May 17 21:46:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  She's an ""old soul,"" apparently. That's how I've seen it explained, though I think the writers are trying to make a point that comes across a little contrived.  Moira told Vivian and Ben that men see things the way they want to see them (presumably as objects, like her young, sexy self), and that women see things as they really are (deep inside to the true soul of a person). Ben eventually sees old Moira and she tells him that now he is starting to see things as they really are."
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,Ey3z0nF1rE,18,Sun May 17 23:08:03 2015 UTC,"I kind of figured that the ones who can change their appearance are the ones who accept their death. Nora keeps forgetting she's dead so her appearance didn't change, the two little girls and their mother might have the burns because they are too afraid to show themselves. They don't use their powers so they might not be aware they can change."
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,Audgy,3,Sun May 17 13:37:28 2015 UTC,I always thought she aged because her remains were buried on the Murder House Property. I always assumed that given years Hayden would begin to age as well.  Every other corpse was removed and buried elsewhere locking them in whatever age they were when they died.  Just my take on it I guess.
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,spent9109,1 point,Mon May 18 01:01:39 2015 UTC,"Her looks depend on who is looking at her. The main guy was a superficial hornbeast so he saw her physical beauty, while usually the women saw her personality, which was the not so attractive appearance."
AmericanHorrorStory,369ajs,WeaselSlayer,1 point,Sun May 17 17:59:34 2015 UTC,"Moira does confuse me, I thought she really was killed when she was still young, but she wasn't wearing the stockings and wasn't acting provocative, so it doesn't make sense to me why she aged."

I can't see anyone other than SP playing Lana, and the same goes for Lange.  The roles practically seemed written for them.  The casting across the board was on point, IMO.  (Now, some the characters themselves being too big or too little involved in the plot?  That's a different story)  I do wish ZQ was cast in Coven and Freak Show to some capacity.  God, I love him."
AmericanHorrorStory,36bmef,wish_to_conquer_pain,3,Mon May 18 11:18:30 2015 UTC,Zachary Quinto would have made a better witch hunter than any of those fools in Coven.

AmericanHorrorStory,368c80,SugarandSass,8,Sun May 17 04:08:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I literally just watched this scene like two days ago, so it's fresh in my mind. You can't really see the device but you can clearly see her pouring the bleach in a funnel which connects to a hose. It cuts to him from the waist up and then you see her holding the hose up so the bleach doesn't pour out and she tells him to drop his pants which were just boxers. Then it cuts to the next scene but it hints that it's an enema rather than him ingesting it orally."
AmericanHorrorStory,368c80,MaryJaneHolland88,3,Sun May 17 05:59:39 2015 UTC,It also shows him sticking the hose inside himself reluctantly and her beginning to squeeze the fluid into him. The scene cuts off when he screams.

AmericanHorrorStory,363r8i,almightyjebus99,2,Sat May 16 23:02:28 2015 UTC,They instantly settled the dispute and she was released after a few hours. They got engaged a few months later. I honestly think it was an argument that got too heated. I've seen no source saying that she regularly abuses him.

AmericanHorrorStory,363r8i,lemmiwinks73,6,Fri May 15 22:55:44 2015 UTC,"Thats kind of sad, the first Scream movie was the first movie that terrified me. Looking at it now its not too scary but it was just feels so nostalgic to watch. The knife through the ear scene just makes me cringe. The sequels got weird if I remember rightly and I don't think it needs a TV reboot. I wouldn't mind a film reboot though with cameos from the originals. If they made it seem like a documentary about the original movie which inspires a copycat killer."
AmericanHorrorStory,363r8i,Imogens,10,Fri May 15 22:59:29 2015 UTC,Scream is one of my favorites. Scream 4 was good for what it was. The tv show however....If its anything like their Teen Wolf show if won't be very scary. But a girl can dreammm.

AmericanHorrorStory,363r8i,Imogens,6,Fri May 15 23:05:48 2015 UTC,Most of them were jealous. Emma Roberts in Scream 4 was jealous of her cousin Sydney (Neve).  Edit: changed 5 to 4

Also if they do another song on the show I would only accept Lady Gaga's rendition of Hotel California by The Eagles because the ending line ""you can check out but you will never leave"" seems all too fitting."
AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,Crookedtree1,11,Fri May 15 13:47:15 2015 UTC,Definitely.  Being in a microcosmic environment like a hotel with a bunch of different archetypal characters could be a recipe for good scares.  I'm with you on Hotel California.

My favorite film of all-time is Halloween and one of the reasons that it's so scary is because it's completely plausible. A dude dressing up on Halloween and murdering people isn't too far outside of the realm of possibility. My favorite season of AHS was probably Asylum because that's really the only one where I sat there and had to ask myself ""wtf is going on"" and in all honesty.. the show just isn't scary. It's called American ""Horror"" Story but it doesn't frighten me in the slightest. However, I love horror as I'm sure most of us here probably do and it takes a lot to give me the creeps, let alone scare me so maybe it's just because I don't scare easy. I don't know.. but I'd really like to see a season that's legitimately scary and I think we should ground it in reality and do away with the supernatural elements."
AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,AlfieBoheme,7,Fri May 15 16:28:23 2015 UTC,"Well the definition of horror is ""fear, schock or disgust,"" so at least they have the shock and disgust part down!  Now they just need to work on the scariness!!!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,beeasaurusrex,6,Fri May 15 18:02:10 2015 UTC,"Tate fit that bill pretty well.  The title is meant to be inclusive of the fact that all the tropes involved are pretty clearly American in nature.  This isn't just the main 'scary' plot points, it's also the real horrors that happen to people every day - Ben cheating on Vivian; Vivian losing her baby; Violet committing suicide; Violet's awareness of the person she loves being bad for her and having to cut off their relationship; Constance desperately wanting to produce healthy, stable, beautiful children and constantly 'failing' as a mother; Larry falling in love with someone who is only using him...these are the real horrors; the tropes are just there for shock value."
AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,AlfieBoheme,2,Fri May 15 18:35:45 2015 UTC,"I hope they get back to the whole 'real horrors' aspect this season. They've been in every season, but got a bit repetitive with Coven and Freakshow. Murder House was the horrors of family and suburban life. Asylum was the horrors of mental illness and religion. Coven and Freakshow have both pretty much just been about the horror of being an outcast, which while good, is a bit meh."
AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,beeasaurusrex,1 point,Mon May 25 18:07:39 2015 UTC,"I thought Coven was more about the horrors of responsibility and power and the inherent threat of abusing them.  Also, racial and cultural shit."
AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,AlfieBoheme,1 point,Mon May 25 18:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah true to the racial and cultural shit, I counted that as being an outcast though. I always found that Coven tried to paint it as being about racism but really was more likely homophobia (similar to how X-Men use racial allegory but it works better as a metaphor for homophobia). The Voodoo aspect was more a backdrop to that I thought. And true, I do see the parts about responsibility now you mention it.  I guess Freak Show could also be seen as the danger of family as well? I just hope theres less of the racism/homophobia/outcast parallels this season because I don't want AHS to become about that, much like Glee became about it."
AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,HeyR,1 point,Mon May 25 18:30:58 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think if the intention was to make it about homophobia, it would've been more overt.  Ryan Murphy doesn't shy away from homophobic beration in his work.  I didn't watch Freak Show past the second episode; I'm waiting for it to pop up on Netflix since I missed it on TV.  :(    I don't think he'll make the same mistake in Glee.  I do think it sorta makes sense how that came about, because he REALLY wanted to push gay acceptance at his target audience - high schoolers and young adults.  AHS isn't about that at all, though, and I think we've had enough of the 'think about this and be scared about it later' tones in the past few seasons that it's time to work back around to the more skin-crawlingly spooky stuff like we had in Murder House."
AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,Echo5582,1 point,Mon May 25 18:46:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like he didn't want the homophobia metaphor to be too overt because Coven would already draw comparisons to Glee, but I just don't want the whole outcast from society theme to be prevalent in another season. One of the great things about horror and monsters imo is that there is often more to it then just scaring you; the supernatural often represents something to do with society or philosophy, etc. I just want Murphy to find something new to discuss.   (side note: I just want to clear up that I'm fine regardless as long as it's written well. The issue with late Glee was that the script and characters weren't as polished as the first season which made it come off too preachy. I love early Glee, but as a gay guy, found season 3 onwards to be kind of condescending ngl)"

AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,chornu,4,Fri May 15 14:13:16 2015 UTC,Yeah it's been awhile but Ryan is also known to go back on what he says quite a bit!!  He also gives unecessary spoilers sometimes as well!!  Is like to see more of the demonic possession/demons/devil/antichrist related stuff!  Itd be cool to see Michael Langdon grown up and reprising his antichrist role and revealing himself..maybe taking on a cult following of some type!!  I was also a fan of the raspers..and it was creepy as hell seeing Shelley from asylum infected with the tuberculosis/psyfalis(sp?) virus!  ID like to see cromwell and Danny Houston back at some point in the future!!!
AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,samanthahazard,19,Fri May 15 14:36:41 2015 UTC,I'd like it if they referenced the Chinese girl that trapped herself in the hotel water tank. I think that would be an interesting plot point.

AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,frenzyalexis,10,Fri May 15 18:41:32 2015 UTC,I'd prefer things that genuinely creep me out and keep me up at night rather than cheap jump scares. Something like It Follows or The Babadook. At first they were kinda creepy but after the movie was over I actually realized how genuinely creeped out I was.

I am unsure if that'll happen because period pieces require a much greater budget. But if it does, I would like a much more mental fuck-uppery in it.   My favourite season is coven (because I'm still in shock over that monster Madame LaLaurie) but would be happy with bypassing supernatural stuff for serious, bone-shaking psychological thriller."

AmericanHorrorStory,3623u5,Canines_and_Cards,7,Sun May 17 01:30:53 2015 UTC,"Perhaps something more realistic. Murder House was more in the realm of realism, despite the ghost-aspect. The aliens from Asylum took it a little supernatural, but I still loved it. Witches? Not my cup of soup. I'm not well-versed on Freak Show.   Just the kind of horror that can really fuck with you. Realistic horror is pretty terrifying, because people can relate to it over Satan possessing you."
AmericanHorrorStory,3610nc,Jump_The_Canyon,26,Fri May 15 04:42:51 2015 UTC,"As far as classic scary, I'd have to pick Murder House. There were quite a bit of jump scares. But as far as actually scaring me, it's Asylum, hands down due to the ""real life"" disturbing nature. First time I watched Asylum, I felt ill at certain parts. The creatures scared the shit out of me and seeing Shelley's progression into one was sickening. When she first saw her amputated legs, I had to pause it because it was so disturbing. And don't get me started on when she was at the schoolyard trying to get up the steps with her still healing amputee legs and wheezing. Ugh. Nasty.  I had the same reaction to Penny in Freak Show. When I heard the tattoo gun, I felt nauseous and when we actually saw her, I couldn't finish the episode for days. How someone could do that to another human being, let alone your own fucking daughter, is appalling. I know it's just a show but those ""body modifications"" to those two characters were incredibly sickening.  These are the two scenes that were scariest to me because it could actually happen. Not that it would, but it's more applicable to real life that some murderous ghost taking its grudge out on me.  Edit: words"
AmericanHorrorStory,3610nc,MaryJaneHolland88,8,Fri May 15 06:18:36 2015 UTC,"In Asylum what sickened me the most was Lana's capture, rape and all the times she finally thought she escaped, either from Briarcliff or Bloodyface."
AmericanHorrorStory,3610nc,ijustneededaname,11,Sun May 17 15:43:02 2015 UTC,"I agree with asylum.  It covered serial killers, raspers, devil/possession, rape, psychotic experiments, inhuman medical practices, mental manipulation/abuse, and some of thencharacters were just down right cold!  Freakshow was more of a psychological thing that showed the negative side human beings can be capable of so that's scary..I still enjoyed coven and murderhouse but nothing really scared me on either of them.  I would say they were just more twisted than scary!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3610nc,Ey3z0nF1rE,9,Fri May 15 11:43:55 2015 UTC,"Asylum.    Hands down the scariest of the seasons.  So many terrible, uncomfortable and disturbing moments in every episode.  There's hardly a lull, and it's just an all out assault from the very first episode to the finale.    As for Hotel, seeing as it's centered on a building there might be a push to bring the series back to what made Murderhouse so great."
AmericanHorrorStory,3610nc,ilovetorunforfun,4,Fri May 15 12:34:24 2015 UTC,"I think Murder House was the most consistently scary, but Freak Show had the scariest moments.  Twisty in the first episode was super stressful and scary to watch, and ""Penny, Penny, open your eyes"" gave me nightmares for days.  Plus the Pepper plot was pretty stressful just before the end.  Not nearly as scary as the other two, but I wouldn't call it easy to watch. I didn't really find Asylum all that scary.  I mean, it was decent, but it wasn't the best.  Although it was miles beyond Coven."
AmericanHorrorStory,3610nc,HelloMyNameIsChivers,8,Fri May 15 20:59:04 2015 UTC,Just re watched Asylum.  It gets my vote.  It simply shocked me more than any of the other seasons and was just incredibly morbid.

Murder house though she loved because to her ghosts arent as real lol I think I agree that asylums and serial killers are the scariest for the real factor, though I wasnt too keen on the aliens thing but whatever, for some thats real. I loved Murder House the best, Asylum second. Circus was creepy... though not frightening and Coven was like a horror version of Mean Girls. I liked that season for the fashion ;)"

AmericanHorrorStory,3610nc,AlfieBoheme,1 point,Sun May 17 12:17:39 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say Asylum. As you've said, the real life horrors just made the season scarier, and it has the growing tension and claustrophobia that Coven and Freakshow lacked.  My opinion might change though. AHS is much better when it's binged than when it's watched week to week. When Freakshow is on Netflix, that might actually end up being the scariest when binged. Twisty and Dandy are two of the scariest villains in AHS and besides them, the show had so many horror moments that were much worse than anything in past seasons imo. Honestly two of the scariest moments in all of AHS for me are Maggie's death and Dandy's death (I know we weren't meant to like the two, but being forced to watch them be slowly murdered as opposed to a shock thing was much worse. Same for Matt Bomer)"

It's completely different form other TV shows, so it presents an interesting challenge to plenty of actors.

AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,ilovetorunforfun,36,Thu May 14 16:57:39 2015 UTC,And then spent years neglecting and emotionally abusing that child.
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,al343806,52,Thu May 14 21:09:34 2015 UTC,That looked really campy and disingenuous.
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,Scoop_Life,19,Thu May 14 16:56:49 2015 UTC,I learned nothing from that promo.
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,aa4ve_eve,5,Thu May 14 17:08:23 2015 UTC,For real. I can't tell if that's how the show is supposed to be and it will be great or if it's just gonna suck. I want to like it.
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,Jeremywarner,3,Thu May 14 21:54:30 2015 UTC,So like Glee and American Horror Story got drunk and had a child
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,Gpr1me,8,Fri May 15 12:07:14 2015 UTC,"Is that the same house from some other season of AHS? It kinda reminded me of Coven, but also reminded me of the spiral staircase from Freakshow"
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,pitabread58,1 point,Thu May 14 20:28:04 2015 UTC,I think they did film some of the interior inside the coven house
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,salemthewitch,21,Mon May 18 03:25:47 2015 UTC,"""From the makers of Glee, and American Horror Story""  Those two could not be MORE opposite."
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,SackOfHellNo,8,Thu May 14 20:22:00 2015 UTC,"Lol I agree. Glee is, in my opinion, one of the worst shows on TV while AHS is one of the best. Them having the same creator is a testament to Ryan Murphy's versatility"
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,thegreenmachine90,18,Thu May 14 20:50:22 2015 UTC,"I think they are merging more than we would like to admit. Season one and two of AHS were incredible, focussed and actually scary with likeable characters. 3 and 4 have been a mess, just like the later seasons of glee. There is too much going on and Im not so sure there were even any likeable characters these past two seasons. I don't root for anyone like I wanted Violet to sort out her life or for Lana to escape or for Jude to be able to find happiness. I just didn't care about anyone these past 2 seasons. If AHS hasn't found its way back this season then I don't think i will continue to watch it. I really hope there is no singing too. I can handle one song in context if someone is a singer but if its shoehorned in like last time then I am done."
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,Imogens,10,Thu May 14 22:00:02 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed season three (I'm really into witchy things though, so I have a bias) but for me the ending really let me down. I do agree about the characters though, for me it was really hard to find even one character that I really cared about in season 4. And I don't like the singing either. It made sense for the characters in season four, but I don't feel like they should have included as many performances as they did. The only character that made sense for was Elsa. Jimmy's singing scenes just felt like they were trying to fill their time slot because they were running out of ideas."
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,thegreenmachine90,3,Thu May 14 22:06:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like S3 had the potential to be great but it had too much going on again which got confused. They could have done an amazing witchy season without having the whole race war/who will be the new supreme/everyone keeps murdering each other but its ok we can bring them back. I like the premise and the show, I just feel like Ryan Murphy and the team are letting us down."

AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,SackOfHellNo,1 point,Thu May 14 20:52:27 2015 UTC,I don't watch Glee but for a critically-acclaimed and award-winner show it got a lot of hate.
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,israeldmo,32,Sat May 16 08:56:35 2015 UTC,"I'm actually really looking forward to watching this now. Sure, it looks pretty cheesy, but if it maintains Coven's camp dark humor style I think it could work very well.  My only concern is that the series will resemble a Madison Montgomery spin-off..."
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,larssonsmith12,12,Thu May 14 17:11:42 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely plan to tune in.  I agree, the Coven campiness was great!  I just hope it's not too grating--100% agree on hoping it's not a Madison spin-off.  Lea Michele though...those pictures of her with the brace crack me up!"
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,ilovetorunforfun,24,Thu May 14 18:25:44 2015 UTC,Only because Emma Roberts can't act.
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,CaldwellCladwell,15,Thu May 14 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that, I just feel like she plays the same character over and over again. She was the same ditzy teenage girl in Unfabulous and a lot of teen b-movies, but I really liked her turn in AHS. When she plays a villain, I like her a lot more."
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,thegreenmachine90,2,Thu May 14 20:49:20 2015 UTC,"I actually really liked her in The Bling Ring, granted she played a very ""Madison"" character. I guess that's just her niche though, bitchy characters. It's kind of like how you see other actors only doing action films or always playing some ""forever single 20-something"" or the perpetual stoner..."
AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,Alexa-the-hexa,5,Fri May 15 11:18:52 2015 UTC,She wasn't in The Bling Ring. I think you mixed her up with Emma Watson.

AmericanHorrorStory,35xuif,Catryna,7,Wed May 20 01:27:03 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty stoked for this, it looks surprisingly fresh. Most of my distaste for Coven and Emma Roberts was that it was replacing what I loved about AHS, but this looks like a fine, designated place for it. If Scream Queens looks like this, and AHS: HOTEL remains dark and twisted, I'm really looking forward to this Fall."

We know she can play an elitist out-and-out mean girl as Madison in ""Coven"" (an attitude she seems to be reprising as Chanel in ""Scream Queens"" and I COULD NOT be more excited), as well as a ruthless con-artist-turned-nice-girl as Maggie in ""Freak Show.""  If she has a part in ""Hotel,"" however small, I'd like it to be an intentional step off the beaten path from her previous roles.  Like maybe a good girl caught in the wrong place at the wrong time."
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,signu1230,8,Wed May 13 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"Her character showed a lot of depth, probably the most of any of the characters, on Freak Show. The character was a huge step away from her other characters in Coven, Scream Queens, and We're the Millers. I wouldn't even go as far to say that Maggie was ever 'ruthless.' At most she was cold."

AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,samantha721,8,Thu May 14 19:57:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I've found Jessica Lange played nearly the same character each season. The strong but seriously fucked up woman who plays everyone around her to get what she wants."
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,EraticA,9,Thu May 14 01:53:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, Jessica Lange DID play the same part every season except for MAYBE the first. I'm glad to see her go, AHS was just becoming the Lange Diva Vehicle."
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,samantha721,8,Thu May 14 17:39:04 2015 UTC,It's because I didn't also say that Jessica Lange is hands down the best actress on AHS. She is. No doubt about it. But she still played the same character every season.
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,IDGAF1203,3,Thu May 14 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"She is. No doubt about it.   Eh. There is some room for debate there. Kathy Bates can keep up (Misery, anyone?). From a more objective view Lange isn't head-and-shoulders above as some would demand you say."
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,samantha721,3,Thu May 14 18:11:51 2015 UTC,"That's true. We have seen Katy Bates with more versatility in her two seasons, from a psycho racist to a deeply loving mother.. It just makes me wish Jessica Lange had played a wider variety of characters even more."
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,EraticA,1 point,Fri May 15 19:28:01 2015 UTC,I agree with that as well. I wish we got to see more of her range as an actress.
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,israeldmo,2,Fri May 15 20:19:02 2015 UTC,"Her more prominent roles are the stereotyped preppy rich girl, like Regina George or Alicia Silverstone's character in Clueless."
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,LittleStarkBitch,10,Thu May 14 18:12:40 2015 UTC,Thats unfortunate.  I really think she's terrible compared to the caliber of actors on the show. It must be in her contract to light up a cigarette.
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,Ey3z0nF1rE,13,Sat May 16 08:40:02 2015 UTC,I hope not!  Not to be negative or a hater but they already have a really talented cast and I just don't see what she could add to the show to make it better or improve it!!  From pretty much everything I've read the last two seasons she's not a very big hit with the show and more people dislike her than like her!  Maybe I'm wrong but I could think of 1001 actresses that would be a better pic to fill that gap if needed..again that's just my opinion!?
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,prettytiedup763,15,Thu May 14 06:06:26 2015 UTC,I thought since she had her new show now that she would leave AHS. I guess that was wishful thinking.
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,Scherzyh,2,Wed May 13 22:10:30 2015 UTC,I love her so much i really hope she's on the season <3
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,israeldmo,2,Wed May 13 22:31:38 2015 UTC,I'm still surprised she turned down the role of Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad to do Scream Queens.

AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,falcon4287,6,Wed May 13 22:47:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I thought she was great in both seasons she was in. I could personally do without Taissa Farmiga in any more AHS, and I thought Emma Roberts showed way more range as an actress.    Also, I didn't know who she was until after finishing all seasons of AHS, and honestly didn't realize that Maggie was the same person who played Madison (I watched the seasons in the order of 2, 3, 1, 4, so I didn't see her back-to-back). I think it's worth mentioning that I also don't find her extremely attractive.    Whatever the reason, some people are strongly opposed to her as an actress, but I think she's just fine. Not incredible, but better than many of the others on the show."
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,SimeonsDilemma,5,Wed May 13 21:40:34 2015 UTC,"Emma's acting was the best of the young witches at Miss Robichaux's Academy, hands down. I'd take her over Taissa any day. (Edit- I am excluding Misty here, she wasn't really part of the academy.)"
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,hottoddy4me,2,Thu May 14 05:00:57 2015 UTC,I kind of have to agree here. Taissa Farmiga is the same character in every season. She is either not that great of an actress or the writers do a terrible job with her characters. I honestly think Emma is a better actress.
AmericanHorrorStory,35vjgt,reenieho,1 point,Thu May 14 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know... A lot of the character-actor seems to be about the same. Lange as diva misunderstood mom. Peters as twisted knight in shining armor. Farmiga as dark brooding teen girl. Roberts as the spoilt rich but deep teen girl. O'hare as random guy who always wants to ruin current situations lol and somehow always flirting with Lange...   You can't really blame certain actors for not being versatile in this show. I used to hate Roberts because she always plays the spoilt rich bitch... The girls we are shown in movies who bullies normal girls bla bla. and that sort of stuck to her even as an actor. She becomes related to that kind of character that we all despise, so we despise her.   But like a lot of actors, she's moving on to different roles and expanding it. I'm still not a fan of her but I can see improvements. Farmiga is also improving...   I can't wait to see these two grow in their acting careers. And I can't wait to see what she'll play in the 5th. Hopefully she'll be a non-human character. That would be fun."

AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,itsthe90s,52,Wed May 13 03:36:06 2015 UTC,"Mystery. I love every season, but mystery is what has been missing from Coven and Freakshow."
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,davis98,5,Wed May 13 04:19:01 2015 UTC,I'll slightly disagree in that I think one of Coven's strengths was the carry-through plot mystery 'who is the next supreme?' - But I think they strayed from this plot at least twice unnecessarily (awkwardly long and drawn out diversion of killing all the witch hunters for example).
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,dilplunk,5,Thu May 14 01:21:30 2015 UTC,It got to the point where I didn't even care who the supreme was
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,spelling88,2,Thu May 14 17:14:35 2015 UTC,Yeah I think it was drug out a little too much. Another reason I would advocate for 10 episode seasons instead of 13. Cut the BS and focus on something good.

AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,reenieho,36,Thu May 14 01:17:13 2015 UTC,My main hope is to bring back the horror from the first two seasons.
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,Zombieimp,6,Wed May 13 14:42:18 2015 UTC,Same here. I want it to really feel scary. Not just weird.
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,ilovetorunforfun,3,Wed May 13 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"I can see like a nice pattern forming actually... Murder House take a typical jump scare old skool twisted horror.   Then Asylum is morbid, grotesque, gore, sci-fi-ish, psychological horror.   Then Coven is disturbing, gothic, comedy, campy horror (oh god the zombie episode and Zoe with the chainsaw... Loved the campiness).   And then Freakshow was natural horror, psychological, weird, disturbing, twisted horror. And I love how Freakshow was showing how people with disabilities sometimes are less of a 'monster' than regular people... (As a person with dwarfism, that was fun to watch lol)  It reminds me of old horror movies... It's like each of the seasons pay homage to classic horror from different genres of horror... It'll be nice to have Hotel be a homage to horror classics like The Shining and stuff... Mmmm... Here's Johnny!"

AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,israeldmo,25,Wed May 13 15:57:52 2015 UTC,"I have a list, actually, after the last 2 Seasons:  1.) No Jessica Lange, or at most, a cameo.   2.) Sarah Paulson as the bad guy, hasn't really happened, yet.  3.) A Character that Evan Peters can portray who's emotional depth goes beyond the soft haired pretty eyed bimbo's well being.  4.) A Coherent, planned, and well thought out story. Haven't really felt this since Murder House.  5.) An actually Horror Story Ending.  6.) No Gimmicks. Season 4 tried to make the Horror Story a Musical. It was cool the first time, maybe even the second time, but by the third time I was done with it. That being said, When they cut it out and reintroduced it in the finale, I was pleasantly surprised and blown away by it."
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,Lecter07,6,Wed May 13 17:17:48 2015 UTC,2 and 6 for sure!

AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,stonerbonercloner,10,Sat May 16 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"My biggest hope for season 5 is that they go back to the roots and focus on a strong, well written premise that presents an actual ""horror"" story (IMO, even though I enjoyed Freakshow and coven, they didn't include a whole lot of horror, mostly ""twisted"" stories with more shock value than anything) that includes jump scares, good villains, organized sub-plots with a number of plot twists the audience does not see coming..im looking for both supernatural and psychological horror elements this coming season. In order for them to accomplish this feat, they must do a number of things.  The first comes down to writing.  I am really hoping that they limit the amount of writers this season and it goes back to more of a Ryan Murphey/Brad Falchuk story than anything else.  If you look up the writing credits for season 4, you will see that Ryan wrote the first episode and main plot, and then passed the gavel on for each new episode allowing a different writer to do the details/sub-plots/side stories and I didn't think that worked as well.  If this show is truly Ryans baby, he needs to go back to his roots and bring his vision to life.  Yes it's more work for him in the long run, but it's also better results and happier fans (IMO).  He can't just come up with the overall plot for Hotel, and write episode 1 and episodes 7 and 13 and pass the gavel to a different writer for the remaining episodes.  It's his vision, therefore he must bring it to life!!  I understand why they include love stories and the happier side of the show..it creates range..when emotions get involved it presents the human side of things that can then be wiped away with his twisted, psychotic Characters and story-lines.  As mentioned above, it would be refreshing to see Evan Peters take on another villain role, along with Sarah Paulson.  I hope they do something very different with Kathy Bates and show a side of her we have not seen yet!  Im still keeping muh fingers crossed for Denis Ohare and Finn Wittrock(Even if they only get small roles or cameos..hell just make another 2 part halloween episode and include the 2 of them in it, working together. Let them work together as detectives or something..then take them away and bring them back as needed with limited roles) I agree they shouldn't use as large of a cast as they have in the last few seasons..but they can still get away with a larger cast and pull it off this year with the setting being s hotel.  People check in, check out, die, come up missing, etc.  If they want to use a larger cast, they need to rreally focus on the writing and use characters together more so than having a different bsckstory for every character.  They could write the overall story-line..and then write in a few side stories for the characters coupled up.  IE..kathy bates is running the hotel..create a storyline for her..is she struggling..or rolling in dough?   Create what villains lurk around the hotel..IE Sarah Paulson/Evan Peters.  Then decide who the guests could be and present the problems and solutions for them.  Bomer/Gaga could work together as a couple at the hotel...Angela Bassett could be a star at the hotel who's shine is being taken by Gaga.  Bomer and Gaga work together to overcome Basset.  Sevigny/Bentley could work together..have a couple staff members with a deep past (Cheyenne Jackson/kathy bates).  I guess that's long enough for now lol if I didn't lose everybody a long time ago!"

AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,TheoX747,1 point,Thu May 14 01:31:22 2015 UTC,I felt like Kathy Bates played the perfect role that I didn't expect in Freak Show.  I don't know what other side to her I'd expect to see.
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,Echo5582,6,Sun Jun 14 06:05:59 2015 UTC,I really just want a more cohesive storyline with less subplots and less extraneous characters. The seasons tend to become overstuffed with as many characters as possible. Season 4 ended up making the overstuffed season 1 look positively Spartan in comparison.
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,bwood16,4,Wed May 13 16:24:09 2015 UTC,"I agree. It becomes tedious to watch and try to keep up with. Like what's the point of all this complexity? Oh, there is none."

AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,Twintails18,16,Thu May 14 01:26:36 2015 UTC,"My number one hope for Hotel is a clearly defined, utterly wicked antagonist.  Someone (or something) that we'll be talking about for years after the season ends.  (Still bitter about Twisty being killed off midway through Freak Show)  The previous seasons either had several antagonists (like bloodyface 1.0 & 2.0 and Sister Mary Eunice in Asylum), 'decoy' ones that met their demise early, too many plot lines, or some that kind of came off as antagonistic but were likely just terrible people.  Give me one big bad villain to last the entirety of the season, whom for the most part, seems indomitable, and the hero(es) have to overcome incredible odds to defeat them."
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,GamingTatertot,2,Wed May 13 12:22:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in that. Don't have to be one of these slasher serial killers (e.g.: Jason, Freddy, Leatherface, Michael Myers), especially because we already had Bloody Face and Twisty, but a main antagonist would be nice."
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,TEXASJerome,1 point,Sat May 16 07:48:55 2015 UTC,Good point. I think this ties in with a smaller cast and a tighter plot. They're trying to squeeze too much into 13 episodes. Let's be simply horrifying!
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,theDoomguy2011,1 point,Thu May 14 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"What kind of deeds would an antagonist have to do for you to consider him truly wicked and memorable?  I personally think that if an antagonist seems like a good guy for most of the show, then is revealed to have been using everyone, that might be a good start.  The audience feels as betrayed as the characters.  Griffith from Berserk is a really good example of this, but only people from the anime crowd will know this reference unfortunately."
AmericanHorrorStory,35sj9d,recovering_spaz,5,Sun Jun 14 06:11:42 2015 UTC,I completely agree! More time needs to be spent on deepening the story line and less time on expanding it and creating new ones. The more characters they introduce it seems as though the story integrity suffers.

AmericanHorrorStory,35mo7e,ilovetorunforfun,4,Tue May 12 21:16:42 2015 UTC,"Asylum was great.  I watched half of Freakshkw before powering through MH, Asylum and Coven thanks to Netflix.  I thought MH was my favorite..until Asylum And then I thought nothing could ever top it.  I read such harsh reviews about Coven and how terrible and poorly written it was and I just didn't see it.  I think each season is great in its own way.  A part watching and understNding AHS in my opinion is each individual viewer must know how to ""take it"" if thT makes sense.  The movies Anchorman and Anchorman 2 are great comedies in my opinion.  Not everyone will agree and that's mainly because people don't know how to take it.  If you are planning to watch anchorman for the first time, and go into it with the mindset that it's a comedy people can relate to based on real-life/everyday events then of course you won't like it or be able to get into it. On the other hand, if you have the mindset that it's more of an improv deal, and has an ""ANything goes, no holds barred,"" attitude and understand that it's meant to be ""stupid"" and ""insane"" then I think most people would enjoy it.  The same goes for AHS from season to season.  For murder house I didn't really know what to expect I had heard good things about American horror story and wanted to give it a try..so I watched a clip if murderhouse (Connie Britton/jessica langes introduction to eachother) and immediately knew I was going to get into it.  Asylum was a much darker season and had a lot going on I really got into most of it minus the aliens but after watching it a second and third time even that grew on me..but going in the coven I had read some reviews and knew if I was going to get into it I had to have the right mindset and in order for me to do that I had to realize that coven wasn't going to be as dark as asylum and murder house and was going to be much more Campy with a bigger cast and storylines that probably weren't going to be as deep as the first two!!  The same with freak show if you're going to watch each new season of American horror story and expect it to be murder house or asylum you're not going to get into it and if murder house and asylum aren't your thing and you watch freak show and coven first and expect the first two seasons to be like them you're not going to get into it once again.  AHS is an anthology in the miniseries and that means with each new season they reinvent themselves in terms of tone setting cast etc...and I think to get the most out of the show it all comes down to your own mindset!!!  With all of that being said, and after watching each season 3 times each now(but have only seen freakshow twice) I still to this day can't pick a favorite.  There is just too much going on, imo, which is what makes it so great.  So I would say that I have favorite things about each season that might not relate to say the other seasons.  Murdehouse-great storyline, highly detailed..dark with just the right amount of relief.  Viewers are able to relate to it..i'm sure everyone has a scary story from when they grew up or something relating to the house they lived in where something freaky happened....The show touched on infidelity and cheating in a dysfunctional family..so it gave the fictional show a realistic tone as well!!  Asylum-very dark..awesome plot..they did a great job with the ending and tying everything up/together.  The way it was written was brilliant..the show was able to grab power over its viewers.  A majority of people couldn't stand sister jude at first, but by the end of it I think most people felt for her situation and didn't want to see anything bad happen to her.  I had awesome special-effects...amazing flashbacks..IE:when we are first introduced to young dr. Arden played by james cromwell son, they did a flashback to world war 2 era using an old hand-Crank camera in black and white..just one of many brilliant ideas the production staff came up with.  Coven-good storyline as usual..awesome cast..at the time it was the most powerful in terms of visuals and fx..it was campy..has comic relief but was still able to maintain its serious storyline, etc.  Freakshow-AMAZING cinematography/lighting/colors...powerful back stories(episode 10 pepper...chesters backstory..elsa and her stint in Germany, dandy/Gloria..Dell/desiree dell/jimmies bsckstory..just little details that surfaced throughout the show that tied it into what was currently happening at that time and it worked great).  Twisty was off the hook..people say they should've used him more but I think they did it just right sometimes less is more and I think that's what they were going for with twisty and the Edward morDrake storylines!!!"

AmericanHorrorStory,35nv4s,1dra7,7,Tue May 12 01:04:19 2015 UTC,"Obviously, every season has a ton of different plots, but what determines the 'main' antagonist for me is the one whose defeat/victory ends the story: IE, it would be the antagonist of a finale plot line.  In that case, I'd say season 1 was Tate, as the antagonist in the pregnancy/rape storyline AND the abusive/toxic relationship with Violet.  Season 2 was Bloody Face, in both incarnations.  Season 3 was Fiona.  Season 4 was Dandy, but the awkwardness of this season is largely due in part to the shared antagonism of Dandy and Stanley."
AmericanHorrorStory,35nv4s,LSunday,-1,Tue May 12 04:42:24 2015 UTC,No but Tate is cute and sweet. If Disney has taught us naything attractive people aren't evil
AmericanHorrorStory,35nv4s,MyChiefConcern,6,Mon May 18 14:59:14 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say Tate is the main antagonist in Murder House. Hayden may have haunted the Harmons and she was unhinged, but she did nothing compared to Tate, who was responsible for over twenty deaths, raping Vivien (and attempting to rape her again), drugging and attacking Ben, setting Larry on fire, and so on.  I agree that Sister Mary Eunice did more harm than Bloody Face. She was literally the devil.  I don't think Coven really had one main antagonist either. In the beginning it was Marie, then it was Fiona, then it was the witch hunters, then it was just every girl for herself. That season just lacked a lot of direction and tried to go in all of them but failed.  I don't agree with your reasons for Stanley being more of a villain than Dandy. I agree that Stanley was evil, but he was a lazy evil. Ultimately he was only responsible for one death, Ma Petite's, and even then it was Dell who committed the act. Dandy meanwhile killed Paul, Penny, Eve, Suzi, Toulouse, Ima, and the other workers, not to mention Dora, Andy, and the women at the tupperware party. How could you possibly say that Stanley was responsible for more deaths? Also I think Dandy was only absent for one episode while Stanley was absent for three total, but I'm not sure what episode appearances has to do with being the better villain. Stanley was definitely the main threat to the freak show up until the very end, but if you're just comparing what they did then Dandy's kill list far surpasses Stanley's."
AmericanHorrorStory,35nv4s,ahsfreakshow,3,Tue May 12 05:14:09 2015 UTC,"S1 - Tate, and the House itself S2 - Bloodyface and the Devil S3 - Fiona  S4 - Stanley (with Dandy, Elsa and Twisty being used as tools along the way)"

AmericanHorrorStory,35nv4s,pat_4599,1 point,Fri May 15 02:15:55 2015 UTC,"I would say in MH and Asylum that the locations are the main antagonists. MH's core story seems to be the Harmon's becoming engulfed by the house and turning into ghosts. The same with Asylum. Three people dealing with their mental illnesses that stemmed from their time at the Asylum.  I don't know if Coven really had one. Fiona would be the strongest contender. She was the only villain there from start to finish. Same with Freakshow. I think an argument can be made for Stanley or Dandy. Stanley spent more time at the Freakshow, but in the end Dandy seems to be the main characters along with Elsa."
AmericanHorrorStory,35nv4s,anandamidetrip,1 point,Tue May 12 02:36:43 2015 UTC,"Murder House: The House itself. Asylum: I would say Briarcliff itself, as well.

AmericanHorrorStory,35mkzh,ilovetorunforfun,2,Mon May 11 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"To answer your first question, I highly doubt it.  And touching on the musical numbers, I too hope they keep it to a minimum this year..not so much that they actually bother me, more so because of how much it makes everyone complain.  Last year people griped about the musical numbers SO much yet they still tuned in the following weeks after just to continuously complain about how bad it was.  However, Im guessing this year that we see, as many, if not more musical numbers than Freakshow.  The obvious reasons being cast-related..Lady Gaga obviously is a singer/musical artist & im not sure how many people know this..but newcomer Cheynne Jackson is a highly-talented and very gifted singer/vocalist/musician.  Im not saying either of them WILL perform but it would make sense if Ryan were ever going to do it, this would be the season.  There are already rumors that Gaga and Basset are both playing singers/artists on the season to come..I don't know how much this is worth looking into but here is something I came across this week:  ""To date, no further details have been provided about how exactly Bassett is going to create trouble with the internationally famous pop star but Bloody Disgusting reported that she will be taking on the role of a ""jazz singer who regularly performs at the bar of 'Hotel."" The details of the upcoming season's plot remain unknown but Independent confirmed that it was partly inspired by a famous musical comedy in 1935, titled ""Top Hat."" This comedy reportedly had a hotel setting - a concept that is pretty much fitting for ""American Horror Story: Hotel.""  Moreover, since ""American Horror Story"" is quite known for its musical numbers as of late, it is believed that Gaga's participation in the show will involve music in some way. Last season's special renditions of David Bowie's ""Life on Mars"" and Lana Del Rey's ""Gods and Monsters"" were praised on social media.""  The same article claims that Angela Bassett and Lady Gaga will play ""Lolita Jones"" and ""Elisa Starr,"" both of which are jazz musicians battling for the Spotlight within the hotel.  However, I pretty much know this is bogus and would encourage everyone to debunk it.  Most of the information they are reporting was gathered from an IMDB page by a user named ""ACrazey57"" who is notorious for making up and spreading rumors Over IMDB/facebook and reddits.  Which is annoying because people don't fact check/source check and then spread his false/made up plot/cast and now there are tons of people convinced his season 5 cast and plot lines are factually correct and confirmed.  This is the same guy posting ""the official season 5 cast"" which is really his/her own PREDICTIONS..he/she is claiming donald Sutherland/michelle Pfeifer/aleksandar skegard, Lily rabe,  Tammy Blanchard And others will be on it."
AmericanHorrorStory,35mkzh,Ey3z0nF1rE,2,Mon May 11 20:46:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thorough response!    I definitely did not know that about Cheyenne Jackson.

AmericanHorrorStory,35fr5t,davis98,6,Sun May 10 18:27:39 2015 UTC,"In Chattanooga, TN, the Read House is notoriously haunted and the story is that during the Civil War the hotel was used as a hospital for soldiers and a lot of them died there. The biggest haunting is a certain room where a soldier brought a prostitute and killed her. Now her ghost is angry and is known to harass whoever gets that room.  No one knows for sure if it's really haunted but it is a big hotel that was prominent during the Civil war and Chattanooga would be a pretty cool setting for the next season."
AmericanHorrorStory,35fr5t,mad_specialist,3,Sun May 10 01:24:23 2015 UTC,"You know, that could be perfect for this season - modern day with the Civil War era as a second timeline a la Asylum. My only concern is that we've had a similar storyline in Freak Show with the soldiers making a snuff film using Elsa - a prostitute. There are lots of ways to make this story feel different, though!"
AmericanHorrorStory,35fr5t,starsurfer9,-6,Sun May 10 02:30:46 2015 UTC,I hope not. A horror setting in a hotel must be in the 1920s. any other time period is a waste.

AmericanHorrorStory,35fr5t,Doctor_Arkham,-4,Sun May 10 19:59:17 2015 UTC,It was a deconstruction of 1920s hotel horror.

I should imagine that they could easily replicate a Hotel set in Louisiana, so the only reason I can see relocating is to go back to the Murder House. Maybe the Black Dahlia as everyone has said"
AmericanHorrorStory,35cx9f,AlfieBoheme,5,Sat May 9 14:20:53 2015 UTC,"i don't really care, but I wish they would do more other locations, they've been in New Orleans twice now, and this would be the 2nd time in LA.  There are plenty of other states to use for a setting."

Maybe it's surgery, maybe it's makeup or maybe im crazy.  I remember a thread somebody posted on here last month with an old school picture of her and Id say 90% of the people agreed that she is prettier on AHS than she was on the OP's picture he included of her from 1979!  I know she is 65 years old now and if you watch murder house there is a VERY Noticable change in her aging from then (summer 2011) to say FreaKshow (summer 2014)..im sure the chain smoking doesn't help her case but whatever floats her boat!!  Either way, her axting is impeccable!!  She truly is a goddess and she stole the show from American horror story!!  And murder house she was originally casted as a supporting actress that was only supposed to be in a few episodes but later down the road Brad and Ryan rewrote almost the whole script to accommodate her being on the show and to change her into one of the lead roles!!!"

AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,TheGoldfishesKeeper,87,Tue May 5 21:35:12 2015 UTC,"Definitely Misty. She was one of the more innocent characters in the series, and she could not catch a break. She was burned alive by her family. Then she comes back and just wants to find the place where she belongs - her real tribe. All of the witches took advantage of that. Zoe used her for the first half of the season, asking her to take care of Kyle and then breaking promises to visit. Fiona and Madison got into her head later on, building up her ego and faking friendship. And in the very end Cordelia forced her to take part in the Seven Wonders for a position she didn't want in a coven that didn't accept her. That earned her in an eternity in Hell. Andd I'm still not over it :("
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,starsurfer9,32,Tue May 5 23:04:28 2015 UTC,"The fact that she was in tune with plants, animals, and nature in general, as well as being lonely yet not bitter about it. The fact that she was so humble and innocent made her super sympathetic."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,ness1215,10,Wed May 6 01:55:02 2015 UTC,"Weird that Cordelia was so sad but she made her do it, she wasn't even part of the Coven."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,logangrey123,7,Wed May 6 13:04:10 2015 UTC,you think they could've saved that test for the fucking end.   put some tests beforehand that aren't deadly and save the most dangerous ones for last.   fucking writers.

AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,logangrey123,9,Thu May 7 21:46:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said, except I don't feel that Cordelia made her attempt the Seven Wonders. Misty started to enjoy the idea that she could be the next Supreme, you could tell that when she was talking to Madison in the graveyard.   I think she liked the idea of being the next Supreme for much more innocent reasons though. Whereas the others wanted power, praise and a chance to rule, Misty just wanted friends/family and to be loved and accepted. I think she saw it as a chance to find her tribe by ruling it.   Now that I think about it, it's kind of Cordelia's fault in a different, indirect way. If Cordelia hadn't doubted herself and her power so much, she would have realised her own potential which would likely mean people wouldn't have pushed and convinced Misty so much. I feel Misty wouldn't have participated if it wasnt for everyone telling her she is the next Supreme.   Sorry, I could write an essay on AHS characters lol. In fact, I almost just did lol."

She went through so much from the beginning to the end of the season. She was forced into the asylum, raped by Thredson, had bloody faces child, escaped the asylum just to end up back in, and then had to shoot her own child. Lana by far went through the most shit imo."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,lurkingphoenix,22,Tue May 5 22:29:14 2015 UTC,Lana is my personal hero from all of the seasons. It'll be tough for them to make a character that's more bad ass than Lana was.

AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,Ximmyy,16,Sun Jun 14 13:41:36 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. I feel like the only reason she's not everyone's #1 answer to this question is because of how she turned out in the end of Asylum. Just because she became kind of selfish and cocky does not mean she deserved the imprisonment, rape and torture."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,whokilledmurph,17,Wed May 6 19:43:32 2015 UTC,"She didn't become selfish and cocky, though.  She bullied an innocent nun into letting her into Briarcliff, and then she wandered off on her own in a dangerous asylum with no idea where she was or what exactly she was looking for.  I'm not going to say that all of the terrible things that happened to her were her fault, but I'm definitely going to say that a lot of the shit that happened to Lana was because she was selfish and cocky to begin with."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,wish_to_conquer_pain,6,Wed May 6 20:11:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah her ambition was definitely her downfall, no arguing that. I just think the way she treated Kit toward the end really turned people off from her"
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,whokilledmurph,46,Wed May 6 22:31:42 2015 UTC,"Pepper will always be number 1 for me and it honestly has nothing to do with her being one of my favorite characters. She had a hard life and everyone just brushed her away as being ""stupid"" and ""simple-minded"". Jude and Elsa knew what was up. They knew that Pepper could still understand exactly what everyone was saying, despite the fact that she could only speak a few words.  Misty: she was probably the most innocent character in the whole series of AHS and she did not deserve that kind of ending.  Violet: I'm probably going to get a lot of flak for this but hear me out. I'm mainly referring to her as how the audience felt for her and not her actual fate in the show. I don't understand the Violet hate at all. Sure, Taissa isn't exactly an Oscar-worthy actress, but she isn't terrible. 90% of comments I've seen about Violet was that she was attention seeking, an idiot for loving Tate, blah blah blah. I guess I feel like I can relate with Violet. I do understand how she could be annoying but look at all she had to put up with... Her dad cheated on her mother multiple times with a woman not much older than her. She hated the fact that her mom was an idiot for staying with him. Then she falls in love with a seemingly perfect boy that actually understands what she's going through and then he goes and rapes her mother, gets her pregnant, and lies about it until she has to pull it out of him. Then she finds out he has an even darker side when he murdered those kids in cold blood. Not to mention the cutting and her suicide. Sure, her agony is NOTHING compared to most of the other characters, but as someone suffering from depression, I really identified with her the most out of any character on the show ever. I just feel like her pain is totally overshadowed by the other gruesome stuff that has happened on the show, and it makes people a little jaded about her. She's just ""another whiny teenager"" but she's so much more than that."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,MaryJaneHolland88,19,Wed May 6 01:03:55 2015 UTC,Your explanation of Violet's character is absolutely perfect
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,orbitorstride,7,Wed May 6 05:25:20 2015 UTC,Thank you :)
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,MaryJaneHolland88,14,Wed May 6 08:31:37 2015 UTC,"I'll probably get hate for this as I've never been a teenage girl (I'm a gay man, it's the same thing half the time :P) but I feel Violet was a very apt portrayal of a certain type of teenage girl/teenager in general.   Everything is super dramatic, first love (which always feels like some ledgendary affair that no one can understand) etc. Add to that, that she was obviously depressed (whether clinically or in a teen, emo way is up to you) the problems in her parents' marriage, moving to a different state, no friends, bullying and then the home invasion followes by violent, murdering, scheming ghosts. It's no wonder she is the way she is.   As for loving Tate after everything he did, I obviously don't agree with that but I understand it. Not only does it happen in real life (women who fall for and marry incarcerated serial killers for example) but look online and you'll see a bajillion teen girls crushing on Tate themselves.   I need to get out of this thread, can't stop writing essays lol."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,Lyco_499,33,Wed May 6 13:54:37 2015 UTC,"Kinda surprised nobody has mentioned Twisty. He was originally a really nice man who just happened to be dumb (possibly/likely mentally handicapped), and was taken advantage of by pedophilic midgets. Then he went on trying to live his life, but everyone shunned him until he finally had a mental breakdown and became a psychotic killer.  But even then, he was only doing what he thought was best for the kids. He was definitely one of the most tragic characters, IMO."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,amopeyzoolion,23,Wed May 6 04:34:54 2015 UTC,"I agree Twisty was the most tragic character. He was (in my opinion) mentally handicapped, manipulated and easily frightened. I do not believe he had a break down. I believe he was acting to the best of his abilities to do the right thing, but his perception of right and wrong was impaired. The people he killed were the misfortune few who got in his way.  I do not believe he killed out of desire or enjoyment."

After that she begins to like the freaks, and even fell in love with Paul, and standing by his side when Elsa threw a knife in him. That relationship was frowned upon by her father, but she still supported him. Then, of course, there's the tattooing and head shaving, making her a freak. To top it all off, she's shot by Dandy. I didn't like her at first, but seeing her develop from somewhat of a freak hater to one herself, made her one of my favourite characters in season 4.

She knew he was a bad seed and she still coddled and petted him, which helped to shape him into the monster she knew he was already. She helped him hide the bodies, for goodness sake!   As a mother though, I do feel for her reality as a mother. All mothers love (or damnit should love) their children with every fiber of their beings, but I don't think I would go so far as to help my child cover up something that messed up.

Maggie: she was a bitch at first but then ended up sympathizing with the freaks. Even wanting to perform on stage besides her fortune telling tent. She didn't deserve to get killed by a psycho.   Lana: she went through so much shit she didn't deserve  imo the best hero of AHS  Kit: framed for killing his wife and others, being racially badgered by racists, pretty much not deserving any of what he went through.

AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,AlfieBoheme,1 point,Wed May 6 02:02:39 2015 UTC,"Maggie's death was one of the biggest ""holy shit"" moments for me in the whole series!"
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,SimeonsDilemma,7,Sun Jun 14 06:33:48 2015 UTC,"Hard to say since I feel sorry for so many of them. If I had to pick a top three though:   Jude - While she didn't have it as hard as others in the Asylum, and perhaps deserved some of the stuff that happened to her (she did the same to Lana after all), watching her change from one of the show's strongest characters to arguably the weakest was heartbreaking. Even more so when you watch Kit and his kids try to help her and the love and family she got through them. I have to say her death was perhaps the saddest in all of AHS, and there have been a lot of deaths Lana - For similar reasons as above, suffering again and again and gradually being broken. Her whole character arc is heartbreaking (up until the final episode but shush), and the fact that she kept on fighting despite escaping and ending up back in the Asylum or Threadson's basement over and over made it all the worse. Also the conversion therapy storyline gets to me as a gay guy and I feel awful that anyone had to go through that Maggie - So probably not a popular choice since many feel she got what was coming to her (including the freaks) but Maggie lead an awful life and had an awful death. She grew up as a homeless orphan, true she conned people but it was to survive. She then gets taken in by Stanley, probably the closest she's had to a father figure in a long time and someone who promises to help her. While she does agree to go along with his plan, she's clearly reluctant and fails to follow through on pretty much everything. The only thing she's actually guilty of is not outing Stanley's plan, which she eventually does. I feel like Maggie wasn't developed fully, a problem with Freak Show characters in general, but all she ever wanted was a family. She finds that in Stanley, and then the Freak Show. When Chester arrives she is only trying to be useful and gain respect from her new family, who she has just saved by betraying her past family, and they give her no respect whatsoever, even in death. I dunno I know a lot of people hated her, but I really do feel sorry for Maggie and feel like had she been written better so would others   Honourable Mentions: Moira, Mary Eunice, Misty Day and Chester"
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,AlfieBoheme,2,Wed May 6 14:43:29 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more about Maggie. But of course most/many on this sub won't care just because they dislike Emma Roberts. I felt so badly for her ending :(
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,spelling88,5,Wed May 6 19:56:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like she's portrayed her characters pretty well. Madison was mean to be a cold bitch, and I don't think anyway would disagree that that's what she was.   She was cheated a bit in Freak Show because Maggie had bad writing in my opinion, as did many characters. But I believed in her acting and, and as I said, her death scene was brutal. While the shooting of that was very smart (no music, the magician act then the big reveal, and ofc. the gore) I don't think it would have had any impact if Roberts didn't play the fear well."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,queueingissexy,4,Wed May 6 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"Misty for obvious reasons. But also Bette and Dot because their whole life their mother neglected and abused them, and when they finally get free they end up in a freak show with a bunch of psychos."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,slipkid092,3,Wed May 6 01:09:13 2015 UTC,Yeah but Bette and Dot escaped and had an amazing life. I can't feel bad for them because they actually got a happy ending. Did I forget something?
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,papenurmoller,4,Wed May 6 11:27:42 2015 UTC,"Sister Mary Eunice. Poor girl never fit in with the other girls (as we see in her pool party flashback), and then she gets possessed by the Devil!! There is a scene where Devil Eunice is talking to Jude, and the real Mary Eunice comes out and pleads for help or to be put out of her misery. I felt so bad for her the whole time, even though on the outside she was doing terrible things."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,Ximeri,6,Wed May 6 17:40:51 2015 UTC,"Madison Montgomery. That line where she talks about loving boys that'll never love her back :'(. She also had a shitty life with her parents and stuff.  Also at the end when she was killed by Kyle, a boy she loved, was so sad. :( imo just artistically tragic"
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,aotedm,5,Wed May 6 04:56:06 2015 UTC,"Madison is a complete bitch and is very nasty but I guess it's a result of her spoiled childhood. IIRC, she was on stage from a very young age and so never really got to be a kid. She would have been introduced to the party scene at a young age also. I feel like she's such a nasty person because she never really got to let out all of her frustration at her life while she was young and so it comes out as her entitled, high-and-mighty personality."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,bacchianrevelry,3,Wed May 6 07:51:18 2015 UTC,"Most definitely Maggie for me.  Because of Stanley she was corrupt, and it was pretty clear to me that, in the end, she stood with the freaks.  Didn't deserve to die by halving. Also, Desiree's comment about stealing her jewelry was a bit unnecessary lol"
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,OhDear3,3,Wed May 6 10:23:05 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree with you about Jude. Before she became an alcoholic, she said that all she ever wanted was a family. Becoming sterile put her on a downward spiral for almost the rest of her life. But at the very end, when those kids call her Grandma, she felt such a complete happiness that very few other characters in AHS are ever allowed. To me, her death is the most beautiful and best end of anyone.   The character I feel the worst for is Sister Mary Eunice. Just the picture of sweetness and childlike innocence. It wasn't her choice to be taken over by the/a devil! And AND her consciousness is awake and helpless the entire time it does such evil in her body! Just torture and pain until her fall, which didn't even kill the devil."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,mrrobopuppy,2,Wed May 6 17:22:09 2015 UTC,"Mary Eunice, I feel that the poor girl was basically doomed right from the start, it especially hit me when she meets the angel of death and cries out to her, and for obvious reasons, Misty."
AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,ilovetorunforfun,2,Wed May 6 17:57:00 2015 UTC,"Other than the already mentioned Misty, Addie, and Moira..........I strangely feel sorry for Dr. Thredson's son, Johnny. I know he's a complete psychopath but, I really think he's just a victim. He has the same murderous thoughts as his father and it is most likely a genetic mental illness that passed down from father to son. He has terrible mommy issues since miss Lana Banana couldn't be a parent to him. He isn't the experienced, collected killer that Thredson was. Thredson had the tools and knowledge to do extremely terrible things but Johnny was inexperienced. Especially his last scene with Lana makes me think there was an incredible innocence to what he did. He was literally like a lost child."

AmericanHorrorStory,34zkwa,Bijanadactyl,1 point,Wed May 6 14:35:18 2015 UTC,"I think the most tragic character was Jimmy. One after another, he suffered tragedies. Not sure how he made it out. He was born a freak/reject, his Mother was murdered (though he thought she killed herself), his Father was murdered, his girlfriend was sawed in half, he was convicted of a crime he didn't commit, his hands were cut off, and then all of his friends were shot to death. I didn't really feel bad for him though because I found him annoying and didn't care what happened to his character."
AmericanHorrorStory,3546mu,sierrandsuch,2,Wed May 6 23:26:07 2015 UTC,Great depiction of why people went to Freak Show's during the 1920's and 30's. And an amazing short film!
AmericanHorrorStory,34xnom,Gjaxxx,5,Tue May 5 12:35:42 2015 UTC,Season 3 became available on Netflix in December (the 6th). So Season 4 will probably have roughly the same timing this year.

But honestly, don't get too excited (I'm assuming you haven't watched it by the way your statements were worded) - season 4 does not measure up to the other seasons, in my opinion at least. It had a weak storyline and just felt messy."

AmericanHorrorStory,34xnom,jeromerules,1 point,Wed May 6 07:14:58 2015 UTC,"Freak Show and Asylum are my favorite seasons; a lot of the Freak Show detractors come from brand new Coven fans.... and if you could make it through Coven, you've already seen the worst of AHS."
AmericanHorrorStory,34xnom,Ey3z0nF1rE,1 point,Fri May 8 04:33:02 2015 UTC,If your really eager to watch it it's avaikable to buy on Amazon Prime for around 22$ after tax..or you can buy the individual episodes for $2.99 or HD for $3.99.  But if you don't want to pay to watch it it will most likely be out in the first week of December...The way they did it last year was they released coven on DVD in the United States on October 7 and I'm pretty sure they let the DVD sell for 60 days before they release it on Netflix which was October 6 last year!  So whenever they announced the release day of freak show on DVD I would imagine it would be within 2 to 3 months after that!

AmericanHorrorStory,34vq3n,davis98,8,Fri May 8 13:22:17 2015 UTC,Rottentomatoes tends to rate an entire season over the first episode or two. So I'd keep that in mind when viewing them.
AmericanHorrorStory,34vq3n,forshow,6,Tue May 5 01:27:45 2015 UTC,"In general, it's a well written and daring series.  The ensemble cast with changing plots each season makes it so addicting."

AmericanHorrorStory,34vq3n,MatchEntry,2,Tue May 5 04:00:00 2015 UTC,Because it's a good show when you respect it for what it is... lots of people here want (for some reason) for it to be a typical serial but it really isn't
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,Doctor_Arkham,28,Mon May 4 02:24:46 2015 UTC,The intro to Coven is probably my favorite TV show opening. So deliciously macabre
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,tiddlytapestry,7,Mon May 4 07:51:05 2015 UTC,"Too bad the show didn't live up to the opening. From the opening, I thought this season would be the scariest season. But I barely was able to get through season 3."
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,beans26,50,Mon May 4 14:45:09 2015 UTC,"1-.Definitely the best plot in my opinion. It really built and developed. 2. I would say this probably had the best cinematography. There was a dark presence that really carried through. The tones could be seen throughout and the movement through the scenes were consistent. 3. The dark humor in this season is what did it for me. I didn't enjoy it as much the first time watching it week to week but when I got to watch it straight through on Netflix I got to really feel the cadence of the humor and how twisted it really was. 4. The use of color in this season was very much enjoyed. Whether it was Elsa's eyeshadow, Mordrake's green smoke, or the blood that Dandy bathed in, color gripped this season. It a world so blah it pulled your eye to these freaks and demanded your attention."
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,thedeadlylove,21,Mon May 4 02:58:57 2015 UTC,"Murderhouse- Tate/Violets love story, Constance!, Moira, How each episode showed the past residents of the house.   Asylum- The grisliness, plot, Sister Jude's arc, Lana Winters! Dr. Thredson.  Coven- The humor, Misty Day, Marie Laveau, Fiona, Spalding.  Freakshow- Dandy, Twisty, Desiree, the character back stories. Freakshow brought back some of the horror that was missing in Coven. The music- not the musical numbers and singing, but the background music. It was very creepy and unnerving."
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,bwood16,6,Mon May 4 04:43:02 2015 UTC,"BUT HE RAPED HER MOOOOOOM  Ok but yeah, it's a great relationship. Just wish Tumblr-ites would realize that he's not the perfect guy before they post how their relationship is goal-worthy haha."
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,Hipashia,2,Mon May 4 15:11:45 2015 UTC,Lol I know what you mean they're ratiionship is definitely not goal worthy! I just liked how they were perfect for eachother but Tate was such a psychopath.
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,bwood16,11,Fri May 8 02:17:36 2015 UTC,One thing that remains consistently delightful in each season is the cinebuttography. Evan Peters's ass is my favorite recurring character.
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,bacchianrevelry,5,Mon May 4 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"don't forget Ben.... I find myself fantasizing him taking advantage of my naive boy demeanor,  freshly showered by the window and doing it to me..   Then Moira can come in and clean up afterwards.  question: How do gays see Moira? do they see old or young her?"
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,mistar_z,2,Tue May 5 05:32:09 2015 UTC,"Assuming you mean Chad and Patrick, I would guess they'd see her as an old woman since they're not sexually attracted to women.  After all, both Vivien and Violet (two other characters who are also not attracted to women) saw Moira as her older self.  Violet even saw Moira, as an old woman, in Ben's lap while Ben saw her as a young woman."
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,signu1230,6,Tue May 5 19:06:40 2015 UTC,it was so awkward watching old  Moira on Ben.
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,mistar_z,12,Wed May 6 04:52:31 2015 UTC,"Murder House - the sense of hopelessness we the audience had for all within. By midway it was clear that all connected to the house were doomed, even as they struggled in the spider's web to escape.  Asylum - Sister Mary's transformation. Hands down made me fall in love with Lily Rabe as an actress.  Coven - This one was more Spoopy than anything, but I still had a fun time trying to figure out who they would deem Supreme by the end. I had an inkling but there were still a few moments they mislead. Also, Boardroom scene. Just too good not to mention. Best intro video as well. Oh, and... BALENCIAGGGGGGAAAAAAAAA!  Freakshow - Dandy, Dandy, Dandy. Oh, and NPH. I also really enjoyed the split screen for the twins, and though i did not like them in the beginning I was rooting for them by midway. Jimmy running into the forest to help complete strangers. The revenge for Ma Petite and Ethel. Oh and Amazon Eve. I found myself cheering every time she did something awesome. I also found the music from this season to be the most pervasive in my life outside of watching, I can still hear the lilting strings. Also, PEPPER! ""The Orphans"" was a very exciting episode to me because we finally start connecting some strings.   I can't wait to see what comes out of Hotel."
AmericanHorrorStory,34s4zk,Hipashia,4,Mon May 4 15:10:59 2015 UTC,Orphans was one of my favorite episodes of all time.

I enjoyed the little things and learning about the ghosts background. also Moira x Elizabeth.   nothing that I disliked about this one, everything wrapped up nicely I guess.  Tie for favorite finale with Freak Show.    Lana banana.. and Evan getting hazed.. I also find that Asylum has my favorite Villain in it.    Very depressing half way across the season, last two episode was kind of crappy and really didn't resolve anything.    Shade , share throwing everywhere. One of the more 'fun' tongue in cheek seasons, I really love balenciaga. also incest and head bashing.    what I didn't like, Spalding's Nails.    Best cinematography so far, very diverse cast and lots of Dandy x Twisty scene. I can't control it, I'm fangaying over them. Also Lana Del Rey song and Desire nuff said.   least favorite thing, Maggie and Jimmy's arc getting drop like a sag of poop, not knowing what Stanley's peen looked like and ""where's my mother'. the dora part was a waste of time that could've used to develop other characters instead.   Mommy Issues seem to be very consistent throughout all seasons."

Coven: So damn campy and so damn fun.  And Coven had MISTY DAY <33  Freakshow: The visuals.  The plot got stretched in way too many directions but GOD it looked gorgeous.

Taissa's acting was weak in my opinion, didn't do much to separate her from Violet. The only difference was she lost majority of Violet's attitude and depression and BAM, you have Zoe.

AmericanHorrorStory,34iho9,Spk5126,9,Fri May 1 13:07:25 2015 UTC,"Gaga will appear first. Angela and Kathy will be ""with"" and ""and"" respectively is my bet."
AmericanHorrorStory,34iho9,Androuv,18,Fri May 1 20:06:59 2015 UTC,"Why the Gaga hate? She's easily the biggest name ever on the cast with the exception of Kathy Bates and Jessica Lange. I'm including people like Angela Basset, James Cromwell, Zachary Quinto and NPH there.  No, her stature isn't for acting. But that doesn't matter. We have no idea one way or the other how her acting will be. It could be awful, like Gabourey Sidibe. It could be great, like Jessica and Kathy and Sarah and Denis. It could be passable like Emma Roberts or Dylan McDermott or (don't shoot me) Evan Peters. We've had all of the above before.  But she's absolutely deserving of an ""and"" or a ""featuring"" credit, at least as much so as Kathy Bates. Like Elsa and the Freak Show, you don't necessarily put your big guns as the headliner. You put the name. Lady Gaga is the name to put on the marquee. Saying otherwise is silly."
AmericanHorrorStory,34iho9,weavves,13,Fri May 1 22:06:14 2015 UTC,"I mean, we DO have an idea how her acting will be. She was a big theatre kid in high school, and studied at NYU's CAP21 program through the Tisch School of the Arts.  If you're looking to actually judge her acting abilities, she's been acting on TV/Film since around 2000. Sopranos, Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, The Simpsons, a bunch more. Sure, these were small roles, but you can't rightly say we have ""no idea""."
AmericanHorrorStory,34iho9,AlkalinePacino,-1,Sun May 3 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"Did someone mentioned Lady Gaga?    Lady Gaga was originally given the role of The Blue Fairy in ABC's  Once Upon A Time. But producers never heard back from her.   Additionally, Lady Gaga claims she does not accept acting job offers. Instead, she would like to be offered the possibility to make an audition for a character and earn the job.  GagaFactsBot."

AmericanHorrorStory,34iho9,ness1215,4,Fri May 1 22:17:21 2015 UTC,"Why would Adam Levine or NPH get the ""and"" for their respective seasons when they were both guest appearances? You don't put guest stars in opening credits, no matter how famous they are. That's like having Stevie Nicks and Patti Labelle in the opening credits of their respective seasons. I don't remember NPH being heavily marketed also. They heavily showed him in the episodes featuring him because his character was very important to the last act of Freak Show. Adam Levine was put in the Asylum promo because it was the sophmore season of this show and they wanted more viewers."
AmericanHorrorStory,34iho9,mrignatiusjreily,-3,Sat May 2 06:01:24 2015 UTC,".....that's my point. I doubt theyd put Gaga in that opening. Maybe she'll appear in the opening. But I doubt she'd be an ""with"" or ""and"""
AmericanHorrorStory,34iho9,ness1215,4,Sat May 2 07:31:25 2015 UTC,"Why do you doubt she will be in the opening? She will; she's a confirmed leading lady, not a guest.

It's like they were already preparing for that by doing it that way last year. Lady Gaga might get the first billing at the beginning. The ""with"" and ""and"" spots are always reserved for the veterans and legends (Denis, James, Kathy, Angela, and Jess), so it doesn't seem right for Gaga to be put there."

There are plenty of beloved and acclaimed shows out there that only lasted for just a few seasons or even just one (Twin Peaks, Firefly, Freaks and Geeks, etc). And to counter that there are plenty of shows that just won't die but are god awful. Doctor Who is designed to last potentially forever since the main character regenerates into a new actor every few years. And likewise, AHS also has the potential to last forever since it too is designed to reinvent itself each season (not saying it will but it's formatted to allow for that to happen)."
AmericanHorrorStory,34fwfe,ahsfreakshow,-2,Thu Apr 30 20:38:05 2015 UTC,Twin Peaks had two seasons but Season 2 was unremarkable.

Doctor Who has been on longer but in it's time it's had some pretty shitty episodes and seasons. Also, if you watch a lot of the older episodes, they are nowhere near the standard of tv we get today; while that's not its fault, just because something's older doesn't make it better.  If we're going by that logic then something like The Big Bang Theory is better than Arrested Development, Community and Parks and Rec. So arguably the worst sitcom of the past decade is better than three of the very best.  Length of the run has no regard for quality, just popularity."

AmericanHorrorStory,34bjnn,thegreenmachine90,1 point,Mon May 11 19:22:43 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree with this statement more. I think AHS should start a few weeks earlier and do one long consecutive run instead of breaking over the holidays. (i.e. run September - November). I feel like there's a ton of hype and then it's all lost after the Halloween episode and then they break for several weeks for Xmas and New Years. The pacing is just off and people get lost. Then you see it all together on Netflix and realize it was actually great.

I don't think either season was bad, I think AHS is kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel for characters. By the end of Freak Show, I looked back and realized how tired I was of watching Evan Peters be the good guy who's tortured by circumstance. Tired of watching Jessica Lange play the bourgie woman who hates getting old and is obsessed with being the center of attention. Tired of watching Sarah Paulson be the flawed, but ultimately safely moral center of the show.  I really hope they can dig in and create a more focussed narrative with stronger, more varied characters for Hotel. They have it in them, we've all seen what AHS can do. We've seen some of the incredible characters the series has created. I'm just tired of watching cookie cutter characters and stories in different settings."

AmericanHorrorStory,34bjnn,redditknowsimafreak,2,Wed Apr 29 23:22:42 2015 UTC,"I thought Freakshow started out ok, but squandered all potential of being a truly horrifying season. It had a few great moments (Twisty episodes 1 & 2, making of lizard girl, and Stanley's death) but the other ""horrifying"" moments came from wondering who will be murdered next. Not only did they stall these moments with fake-outs in the first half, but each week was just speculation on who will be murdered next. And then it ended with all the villains getting their comeuppance. Bleh. This isn’t fun or interesting to me. Especially since every season has ended with the villains being punished. I didn’t even care about Ma Petite, Meep, or Salty dying because we knew about them as much as the townspeople did.  And then they focused so much on the drama of the Freakshow, but that was terribly executed. The freakshow was failing but no one expressed any troubles beyond “the townspeople don’t accept us”. It felt like all the freaks did was complain. Their personalities were whip-lashed in favor of the plot of the episode. And so many plotlines went nowhere. IMO the twins had some of the worst. Like Dot wanting to separate her and Bette. It ended right where it began and was never heard of afterwards.  I think one of the biggest problems of the season – and the show by extension – is that most plots run parallel to one another. The subplots and main plots rarely build on each other. And Freakshow didn’t reach any main plot/rising action until the last 2 episodes. And by then they had already recycled and thrown out so many plots that I couldn’t care about what happens; the show would just pick and choose the one’s it wants."
AmericanHorrorStory,34bjnn,anandamidetrip,2,Thu Apr 30 02:02:31 2015 UTC,"This isn't just a Freak Shows issue, it's an AHS issue, in my opinion. The only season that I felt pulled it off was Murder House. After that, it felt like Ryan Murphy just didn't know to tie up all his loose ends once he had made them.   Like, for me, the last couple episodes of Asylum felt like he had made a few bad decisions for shock value, and now had to make a couple more bad decisions to bring any sort of resolution to certain characters' stories. Which, ultimately, created this weird ending where all of the characters do things that are just uncharacteristic. It made the ending feel extremely forced for me.   Coven had a great ending, but the body of the season was so convoluted. Like they tried to keep it a guessing game as to who the Supreme really was, that in the end it could have been any of them. And though, I loved the ending, they made up some bullshit excuse as to why it was none of them, despite that all 4 girls had shown, at some point, that they were capable of performing all 7 of the Wonders.   Freak Show had the best ending comparable to the seasons writing since Murder House. The loose ends were all tied up, there were just a lot of them that felt really unnecessary.  And some that wrapped up in really anti-climactic ways."
AmericanHorrorStory,34bjnn,Lecter07,3,Thu Apr 30 10:58:23 2015 UTC,"I always thought Asylum's ending showcased how deep the writers could actually go. I don't like the strange tonal shift but it was a good way to let in some catharsis and resonance for the characters. IMO it offered some sort of meaning to the erratic events at Briarcliff.  I agree that Murder House had the tightest story, but they still added ghosts and patients into the mix for an episode, then never brought them up again. A lot of subplots were unimportant. IMO each season has too much excess. That might be AHS's biggest problem."
AmericanHorrorStory,34bjnn,anandamidetrip,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"Right, exactly. The whole series has this issue. Murder House WAS the tightest (Huehue), but that was because it was so consistent. One true villain and everything was connected to him.  I've watched Asylum twice through, now, because I hated it the first time, but I liked it more when I watched it the second time.   I see what the point is, definitely. Like... The whole season was about people losing their minds, and that can often just happen. People snap and kill people like that. But, in the narrative for the season, I felt it was so out of character and unexpected and sloppy for Alma to just decide to kill Grace without even a single discussion on it, and to me, made it feel like the writers realized how tight of a corner they had placed themselves (With having him fall in love with Grace, then resurecting her because fans loved her, and then revealing that Alma was still alive, and the three way relationship), and rather than come up with a logical way to make things less ridiculous, they chose to come up with a ridiculous shock moment that sort of didn't feel genuine, to me."
AmericanHorrorStory,34bjnn,Lecter07,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:01:16 2015 UTC,"I'd argue Constance and Hayden were villains just like Tate. And that Nora, Miora, Ben, and Denis O'Hare were antiheroes as well. Hayden, Miora, and Denis had nothing to do with Tate.  I'm pretty sure that the writers wanted to walk into that corner with Alma. Alma murdering Grace is another way to show how these characters couldn't run away from their mental illness. The last few episodes were meant to prove this (like with Lana having to face Johnny). That's why I believe the last few episodes had some depth that the series has never reached. Although I agree these episodes weren't always fulfilling."

AmericanHorrorStory,34bjnn,TheBaconator666,0,Fri May 1 19:06:30 2015 UTC,"Freak Show is my favorite AHS season. It was scary, with lots of high tension. It also had many touching moments that made it easy to relate to the freaks despite their disabilities. It was also mysterious as you never knew what was lurking around the corner."
AmericanHorrorStory,34bjnn,Ey3z0nF1rE,-2,Thu Apr 30 09:24:01 2015 UTC,I liked it an didn't see why it got such harsh criticism from a lot of people..but every year and new season people complain about how it's not as good as the season before.  I originally thought freskshow was my least favorite season when I watched each episode on a weekly basis when it came out..but upon buying the entire season and binge watching it for the second time I felt it was much stronger than I originally thought..i'd give it a slight edge over coven...

I think she is kind of bland and usually speaks in monotone and i just can't get into her characters. She did okay in Coven I suppose but from everything else I've seen of her I am just not a fan.  However, Danny Houston, frances conroy and Connie Britton are amazing!  And I would especially LOVE to see more of Erika Ervin AND also Mat Frazer.  Out of all of the ""freaks"" I thought they had the best acting chops.  I know mat Frazer supposedly has some more stage plays lined up by Ryan Murphey for the future..along with Finn Whittrock but I'm not sure anymore details than that.  Im happy with the way the hotel cast has turned out so far but I hope we get another 2-3 surprise actors or at least ""guests"" for the halloween episodes or something like that!!!"

AmericanHorrorStory,34b1zq,Androuv,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:02:01 2015 UTC,"I think theres already 8 regular cast members; getting to the upper limit of what would work well IMO. I'd expect 1 more person (i still think they have one huge casting announcement they want to save for last) and that would take us to 9, anymore and its getting into problems of too many characters with not enough time to get to know them. So unfortunately many people will probably not be returning for regular casting roles, although they may have guest appearances. And i would really enjoy Lily, Frances, Finn, Angela."
AmericanHorrorStory,34b1zq,ahsfreakshow,2,Wed Apr 29 21:30:34 2015 UTC,I was skeptical about this season having a larger cast as well..I felt freak show had too many people on their cast and it caused problems in The storylines and overall plot but if there were ever a season that they could get away with having a large cast this would be the season since it's a hotel and they could have guests coming and going..one nights stays..extended stays..cast members being fired and replaced by new ones..characters coming up missing or being killed off.  I think 9-11 regular and reoccuring cast members is a sufficient amount of people imo for this season!!!
AmericanHorrorStory,34b1zq,Supreme000,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:11:07 2015 UTC,"Well no one said all of these actors are going to be in main roles. We can assume that, but we can still certainly get more casting announcements for the lesser roles too. This time last year we knew about a lot of the cast for Freak Show, including Sibide, Gummer, Bentley, JCL, LaBelle, and Bomer, all of whom were in very minor roles. Getting more cast announcements doesn't mean there will be a large main cast."

AmericanHorrorStory,340cyg,StalkingInsanity,5,Mon Apr 27 08:21:16 2015 UTC,"A cool idea, but I think an AHS comic book would almost HAVE to be in color, otherwise you lose a lot of the vibrant shades in the show, like all the blood, Moira's hair, and a lot of the settings.  Depending on the gradient scale, you could stand to lose a lot of detail, too.  I could see a purely black-and-white scheme working for some places, like Thredson's basement lair or most of the rooms at the Coven academy, but the thought of a colorless Murder House makes my heart break."
AmericanHorrorStory,340cyg,signu1230,8,Tue Apr 28 00:22:46 2015 UTC,I want AHS to go back to crazy stuff like this that was intense! I feel like the show is so good but nothing so far has compared to seasons 1&2
AmericanHorrorStory,340cyg,BuzzTheToy,2,Mon Apr 27 14:38:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe it will, maybe the past two seasons were to introduce people to it and get them to like it and not think it's as scary as it sounds.  I first heard about it from the season 2 teasers and watching parts of it but I thought it was too dull looking and scary so I didn't watch it.   The season 3+4 teasers weren't that scary, just creepy, so I watched the full seasons and now i'm a fan of AHS.   Maybe RM thought about it like that and is going to go back to scary and intense moments for season 5 now that it is one of the most popular shows on TV."

AmericanHorrorStory,343gx4,Zinthaniel,3,Tue Apr 28 03:45:43 2015 UTC,"I think the Howard Hughes/Peters rumor got started from room 64 being the penthouse for Howard Hughes at the Chateau Marmont.  http://davelandweb.com/chateaumarmont/rooms.html  BACKSTORY: The Chateau has been the site of many famous incidents with movie stars, artists, and musicians, most notably the death of John Belushi in Bungalow 3 on March 5, 1982. Some of the other oft-told tales include Led Zeppelin riding motorcycles through the lobby, Jim Morrison jumping off a bungalow roof into the pool (or off a terrace onto the ground...the story varies!), and Natalie Wood, James Dean, and Dennis Hopper doing their script readings here in director Nicholas Ray’s Bungalow (#2) ffor “Rebel WIthout A Cause” (1955). Movie studios rented rooms for their stars so that they could “get into trouble” away from the watchful eyes of the gossip columnists and the law. The most famous quote about the Chateau comes from Columbia Pictures studio head, Harry Cohn, who told William Holden & Glenn Ford: “If you must get into trouble, do it at the Chateau Marmont.” The two shared a room at the Chateau (paid for by Cohn) and took turns using it as a private getaway."
AmericanHorrorStory,343gx4,smish_smorsh,3,Tue Apr 28 03:53:08 2015 UTC,"Howard Hughes is a VERY interesting man and I cannot even begin to summarize his crazy life and his importance to technology/cinema/pop culture (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes). But, I'll share about the part of his life that I assume will be relevant to AHS hotel. Howard was a very very wealthy and smart man who lived a very glamorous life. He dated movie stars, flew planes around the world, won academy awards and  he also suffered from some form of mental illness (I don't think he ever let himself be officially diagnosed). Towards the later part of his life, after a few near death experiences, Howard moved into the Beverly hills hotel where he occupied a few rooms and probably suffered some sort of mental break. Howard stopped wearing clothes, only cut his hair and nails once a year, watched the same movies over and over, became very worried about germs, and subsided on a diet of chocolate, chicken and milk. He started to move from one hotel to another, always staying in the penthouse, he became a recluse and would make very outlandish requests to his staff and they were always granted cause he had the money to back it up.  Soooo If Evan Peters is playing a Howard Hughes inspired character I assume this is the side of Howard that they will be showing, which in my opinion has the potential to be really interesting."

AmericanHorrorStory,33qc4g,Cr3amy_cr3ation,6,Fri Apr 24 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"Howard Hughes, film maker, aviator, philanthropist, and aerospace engineer, used to stay in Room 64 at the Chateau Marmont. He used to watch the starlets in the pool down below.   Wikipedia on Hughes: ""In 1972, Hughes was approached by the CIA to help secretly recover Soviet submarine K-129 which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier. Thus, the special-purpose salvage vessel Glomar Explorer was born. Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story""  Possible connection to government conspiracy and Operation Tophat?"

AmericanHorrorStory,33qc4g,atson,9,Fri Apr 24 17:24:35 2015 UTC,I hope it's not prostitution. That would be another season of Evan Peters' character basically being a sex toy.
AmericanHorrorStory,33qc4g,ahandfulofbirds,2,Fri Apr 24 17:32:05 2015 UTC,"I would prefer it not too, though I wasn't a fan of AHS doing ghosts either.

AmericanHorrorStory,33qc4g,davis98,0,Fri Apr 24 17:48:58 2015 UTC,There was a freakshow orgy in the first episode...

AmericanHorrorStory,33qc4g,ahandfulofbirds,3,Sat Apr 25 01:56:05 2015 UTC,"It wasn't important. The fact that they had an orgy could be completely removed. They never do it again, there's nothing that required that situation to happen. Literally the only thing important in there was that Penny met Paul, which absolutely could have happened hundreds of different ways. It was a shock scene, to make the freak show seem more initially repelling."
AmericanHorrorStory,33qc4g,mrignatiusjreily,3,Sat Apr 25 02:00:42 2015 UTC,"I took the orgy scene as an example of how sexually liberated the freaks were compared to the normal people, like Penny. Not to make them seem repelling"

AmericanHorrorStory,33o1ec,theonewiththev,3,Fri Apr 24 03:26:02 2015 UTC,"Despite all its flaws, Coven had a great one. The hooded cultish figures, the skinny demon thing, the occult and creepy feeling to it. If the producers had made that the season, set in the past and revolving around a town full of people caught up in witchcraft, instead of this ""who will be the chosen one"" shit. The teen with magic thing has been done to fucking death.  Freak Show did a good job of expressing itself and what it wanted to be(and ultimately was) in the intro. In a lot of ways, that season's overall theme was judgement, and how we take things based on appearance, and unlike Coven, Freak Show's intro perfectly captures what the season was.  Murder House did a really cool thing with their intro. Instead of showing the house, which we would spend all season with, or showing the ghosts, who we would spend all season meeting, they instead went and showed all the babies, which was creepy for a reason I couldn't explain. And then my cousin explained it to me, that back then, most families would only pay for portraits like that postmortem. Those babies looked like statues because they were dead. And that just adds a new level of terror, and a perfect metaphor for the residents in Murder House.  Asylum, as the prodigal second season, was a return to terror and a great season. The casting was amazing, and the horror was, for the most part, about the psychological aspect of fear. Sister Jude's past and her internal struggle, which comes to a head when she ends up in the same position she put upon others, Lana's rape was played much less traumatic than having to carry and deliver a rape baby, and the calmness of people like Thredson and Arden really add to the disturbing implications of their own sanity. The intro fails to showcase any of this, though. It just decides to show gore, and filth, and shock value. It felt more like the intro Lana would use for her documentary rather than the one for the show. It was underwhelming."

AmericanHorrorStory,33kdhb,dcagslift,23,Thu Apr 23 05:43:38 2015 UTC,"I think Lana is definitely our hero character, but she is very Slytherin — self preservation is most important, so she takes some pushing to make the right choices if they could make her go through something considerably hard, and with her apparent post traumatic stress, I can hardly blame her or call her a bad guy. With the aliens, well, I think the idea we're supposed to take from how they worked was that they're slowly manipulating humanity in certain evolutionary directions. Kit was their subject because they believed he was the best basis for the future of humanity, i.e. Selfless and good hearted. They studied him, and those who had biological contact with him. It was, imo, very well handled without overshadowing the rest of the series."
AmericanHorrorStory,33kdhb,ahandfulofbirds,2,Thu Apr 23 13:10:37 2015 UTC,I like the idea of Lana being in Slytherin
AmericanHorrorStory,33kdhb,MatchEntry,13,Thu Apr 30 22:41:00 2015 UTC,"I mean I always felt that Asylum is above all a season about ambition. Lana, Jude, Arden, Timothy, Thredson - they all have a goal that drives them to do (at best) morally questionable things. Do I think lana is villainous because of her actions at the end of the season? No. But I think her tale is a cautionary one (just look at the way she treats Kit toward the end)  As for the aliens, Ryan Murphy has said that they were always a metaphor for God. The season goes back and forth between science vs religion, though each ""practice"" shows some really terrible flaws. Much like we as a human race will never know what power truly rules in the sky, we as the audience never know what/who the aliens are. We can assume that the aliens are good (or at least better than science or religion) because Kit is the only one to get a peaceful ending (his children say he died happily) when his body is taken back by the aliens."

AmericanHorrorStory,33kdhb,Kiss_Me_Im_Shitfaced,3,Thu Apr 23 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced that the aliens knew about (spoilers) the prophecy in Season 1, and that they always had some gifts of future sight and the like. Like, their whole species did. And they foresaw the creation of this prophecy, and they tried to stop it by finding places, like the asylum and the Murder House, where evil was strongest, and kind of ""screened"" all pregnancies in those areas. That could explain all the miscarriages, all the weird baby shit, why Tate Jr didn't have the hooves that the nurse saw, and even the existence of our friends from Season 3. My crazy theory is that somehow, the aliens were able to replace these babies with normal, artificially created human babies, giving them their gifts, and that for some of them(like Tate's baby or the Son of Bloody Face), their fake minds couldn't handle the gifts and they went psychotic. I believe these aliens stopped the literal end of the world by containing the demon baby at the end of Season 1.  Also, those two home invaders from the Piggy Pig episode are the Monsignor and the Minotaur from the future in disguise. As long as I'm bullshitting."

Season 5 of American Horror Story will be a/n fifth season filled with American Horror Story, the aliens from season 2, and don't forget the hotels! oh my!! Our story stars Lady Gaga as Drake Bell, a murderous, loving hotel heiress (and a skanky boner killer). She keeps her own secrets, as do the guests of ""Hotel Hockey"" as it is nicknamed its sleepy home town. Finn Wittrock stars as a singing, dancing bellhop. He is required to beating off the guests furiously and often, a job that he doesn't mind a bit. But how does he fund his homoerotic hobbies and 0 children with this job? With his job helping the heiress of the hotel smoke her joints of course. Needless to say, their dumpster is a colorful place to be! AHS: Hotel also stars the dog from season one as Rame Jr, a badass Nazi hunter who dabbles in twin gold plated swastikas that are also shurikens; he performs both of his jobs slowly and quite deliberately. He is in love with Gaga's character, but the two are also entangled in a romantic affair with a beautiful stranger, played by Lily Rabe, a white chantause with her own black secrets. Another guest of our hotel is rock star God of comedy Pauly Shore, played by Jessica Lange. Staying over for a quick getaway from fans and recovering from a divorce, our star discovers a gun in the room that could lead to some surprise sex later in the season. After befriending a greasy little girl across the hall and dreaming of screaming through the hotel together, they uncover dangerous secrets and find a few Jonas Brothers along the way. Finally (though new guests are emerging every day), our hotel is visited by a newlywed couple, played by Evan Peters and Bill Cosby. They are deeply in love and into some large, larger sex. wow! that's fucking large!! When their buttoned-up neighbor downstairs, played by Stevie motherfucking Nicks, discovers their martial and sexual bliss and disapproves, they discover THEIR neighbor is actually the leader of the perfectstrains, a cult that worships pot by smoking the finest herb 420 joints every night by firelight. Talk about a surprise! Holy damn I'm high!! This will surely be a metal season. Guest numbers include Rush and Nicki Minaj performing the Misfits cover of the monster mash in mermaid drag. But will there be MURDER, TOO? Holy shit, y'all."

I'm interested mostly in analyzing how the afterlives connect. If AHS = 1 universe, then do our friends live in a world with ghosts, Nazis, aliens, demonic possession, serial killers, witchcraft, voodoo, resurgence, hell, Papa Legba, Finn Wittrock's white underpants, AND knotty pine? Because that is just so much to handle in one lifetime."

AmericanHorrorStory,33g6sg,thegreenmachine90,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:26:39 2015 UTC,"Hit and runs are nothing compared to the number of lost babies. Lily Rabe, the mom(2-3 times depending on how you judge losing the kid), the mistress, Constance (3 or 4 times and at least one for good, but considering Tate I bet she wished it was 2), Lily Rabe again(granted she stole it), the gay guys(granted the stole it), and then season 2 is full of them, only none of them actually die. All the dead babies in Season 2 come back to life but at least 3 or 4 from the first season died for good. It's kind of morbid, even for a show like AHS. It's just ""hey, look at all these babies, so cute, these babies are dead now"". We need to create tension? We need shock value? Kill one of the kids. No kids to kill? Impregnate a character, toy with the idea of abortion to show how much they love the kid and then fucking kill it off."

AmericanHorrorStory,33eh2o,IamLegba,7,Tue Apr 21 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"This is what I was thinking as well. Because the ghosts came back from the school shooting and they were not killed in the murder house. And they could've been haunting somewhere else. I think that spirits walking freely on Halloween is based on it being Halloween and not ""rules"" by their own haunting grounds if that makes sense."

I think that soon enough all seasons rules will be the same."
AmericanHorrorStory,33eh2o,danielsk1,3,Wed Apr 22 02:17:25 2015 UTC,I hope so! I would love for future seasons to revisit places cursed in former seasons. In general I would love some overlap.
AmericanHorrorStory,33eh2o,Casualdancemonkey,3,Wed Apr 22 06:51:29 2015 UTC,"Halloween doesn't just apply to Murder House. If it did, the kids who Tate shot, who had no affiliation with Murder House, wouldn't have come back for that one night. Addy said it herself, Halloween is when the dead can walk among the living. As for the house, it's likely that the tragedy of the first occupants spawned the evil grip on the house and as time went on, each new resident was exposed to the ghosts and subsequently met an end or killed someone, strengthening the grip. Like pushing a snowball down a hill."

You can't start a season and know how it's going to play out. It's a ride you just have to sit down and keep your arms in the car. You can't ever really anticipate anything.   I didn't expect that in the beginning. The show just looked like something new that I'd not already seen 100 times. (Plus, it was early fall and I get in the mood for ""spooky"" crap ever fall.)

To me, it just seems too impossible. If I were to experience anything supernatural myself, I might doubt it, but I will be a lot less sceptic about the whole thing.  I'm the same with things like aliens and hypnosis. I'm willing to believe it's real, but I need to see it all myself. I need to be the one seeing the blinking lights and the cow being abducted. I need to be the one being hypnotised. Then I'll believe.  Long story short: send me your ghosts to make me believe. I already tried Bloody Mary and I was extremely disappointed.

The only tv shows that my belief really affects are those ones where a group of people wander around a building in the middle of the night with the night vision cameras on asking 'is there anybody there'. I imagine if I completely denied the paranormal, those shows would be boring/irritating. As it is, I love them :D  I will say though, I am largely sceptical. I will always search for a logical explanation first. But some things just don't have that reasonable explanation you're looking for without some serious reaching (which counters the logic imo!). Either way, ghost stories have always got to be taken with a pinch of salt, especially if they're on tv where all manner of things could be going on between the recording and the broadcast, even if the show is live.   ...went on a bit of a tangent there, huh. Sorry :)"

I am a very evidence oriented person in most cases and there's just nothing that supports it, or rather, everything can be debunked.

AmericanHorrorStory,33ch5c,mistar_z,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:08:08 2015 UTC,"I've seen some decently concrete evidence. I suffer from enough deja vu, usually things I've seen in dreams, to suspend my disbelief and reason myself a mild case of ESP, and for all the hoax psychics, I've seen firsthand solid proof that at least one had a real ability to sense things most people couldn't. As for ghosts, I logically believe that there are still traces of a person after they die, brain activity and such, and that strong enough will in the person could lead to a semi-perceivable apparition."

AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,HooolySmokes,11,Tue Apr 21 08:10:36 2015 UTC,"I liked Season 4, however, I feel like Season 4's Main story could have been told over like 8 or so episodes without all of the side crap that made the story feel like... well, less of a story. The character's are lovely and so well performed. There are some really scary moments and some really sad moment and even a few memorable moments. But... they gave us a really great beginning and then ruined it by giving us a heartfelt story instead of giving us a real horror story. Such a waste."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,Lecter07,2,Tue Apr 21 13:28:29 2015 UTC,"I think the characters were great but I didn't connect with them this season. This was the first season that I didn't really care about the main characters fate. None of them were really ""good"" this season though. They all did horrible things. The previous characters were more likable to me because I was able to root for them. I think the season got progressively lighter as it went on, which is disappointing."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,lurkingphoenix,16,Tue Apr 21 18:45:54 2015 UTC,"Without giving away too much, the main complaint I hear about season 4 is that it lacks an overall plot and has too many characters.   I, however, enjoyed season 4. I thought all the characters were well developed and likeable, some (of the many) story lines were very strong, and the cinematography was magnificent.   Season 2 is also my favourite. This season is not as dark as asylum, but is still dark. While season 4 is not my favourite season, I would say my favourite episode from the entire series (all 4 seasons)  would be s04e04."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,HmmmNol,6,Tue Apr 21 08:46:24 2015 UTC,Season 2 was by far the best season! Was actually creepy.
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,horselover03,8,Tue Apr 21 16:30:20 2015 UTC,"I actually really enjoyed season 4, and I think once people have a chance to binge watch it, not wait from week to week, more people will come around to how good it actually was."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,seanrjones,4,Tue Apr 21 19:22:22 2015 UTC,I totally agree. I recently binge watched it and found it to be 100 times better.
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,jeepersmuggins,4,Fri Apr 24 10:41:52 2015 UTC,People felt it was boring and way too draggy. In Murder House and especially Asylum there was twist after twist. Every scene had a purpose and one sick thing happened after another. In Freak Show there was so many filler scenes that dragged on. A lot of people did not feel compelled to keep up with the show. All of my friends who are typically on top of AHS and discuss it a lot were episodes behind in Freak Show because they weren't hooked.
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,ExploreMeDora,1 point,Tue Apr 21 21:23:33 2015 UTC,"I'm currently binge watching the season with one more episode to go, having started less than a week ago. While it wasn't perfect... boring? Really?!"
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,alina_314,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:09:44 2015 UTC,Perhaps you have different taste and you are engaged differently. The majority of people like this show because of the feeling that Season 1 and 2 had. Each scene was important. Each scene had something sick. Each episode had new twists. In season 4 there was so much filler. Line delivery was so slow. It was not as shocking or surprising. Even if you were not personally bored you must admit that it was much slower than the other seasons.
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,ExploreMeDora,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:13:58 2015 UTC,"For me, many of the scenes were absolutely shocking. Like I would regularly have to pause scenes because I needed a moment to process what happened, and these scenes play out in my head throughout my day and disturb me. Can't say the same for Coven or Murder House."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,alina_314,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:48:54 2015 UTC,Different stuff scares different people and different stuff engages different people. Maybe the fact that you are binging instead of waiting a week and sitting through commercials made a difference. Also when it was airing there was so much hype because there were rumors about a circus season for a while and people really wanted it to happen.
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,ExploreMeDora,3,Mon Jun 8 13:57:40 2015 UTC,"I found the first half to be relatively scary and gripping, primarily because I have a fairly healthy fear of clowns. The main reasons to watch are definitely Twisty and Dandy (who needs to be in every season of AHS going forward, Finn Wittrock is fabulous!). I found a lot of the main players shoehorned in without actual plots or real storylines. Also, I was remarkably irritated that the actors playing 'freaks' ended up with a ton of monologs and passionate speeches to the other actors who are actually 'freaks' (I use the word in the context of the show). I still think it was worth the watch (if only for Dandy), but it definitely faltered, which bummed me out because I love circus freaks as a topic in general and the potential was real."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,ChickenChic,3,Tue Apr 21 21:15:16 2015 UTC,"I loved season 4. I binged it, so that might have something to do with it. The things that dragged it down were the music numbers, and Elsa Mars. I didn't find her as intriguing as the other characters that Jessica Lange has played throughout the season. I loved the characters and the overall plot. Dandy was fabulous."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,Casualdancemonkey,3,Wed Apr 22 07:04:26 2015 UTC,"season four was slow on a couple episodes, but in all i thought it was beautifully done."

AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,israeldmo,-1,Tue Apr 21 18:10:21 2015 UTC,"Oh, Jesus..."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,israeldmo,4,Wed Apr 22 09:39:41 2015 UTC,"Season 4 started off REALLY strong in my opinion.  I was really hyped up going into the season, I thought the Freak Show concept was awesome, and I saw a lot of potential in all the characters.  That being said, I felt that most of the second half of the season was just lackluster.  I wasn't obsessed with any of the characters like I was in previous seasons and I honestly just stopped watching.  When I did finally binge watch the rest of the season, I found myself bored and calling out exactly what was going to happen.  One of my biggest complaints was the amount of characters that were in the show.  Yes, I understand that freak shows need a large amount of freaks, but I felt that I never connected with a single character because so much time was being spent giving all the freaks their fifteen minutes of spotlight.  Don't get me wrong, the acting and the cinematography were brilliant as always, but the writing just did not measure up to previous seasons (Season 2 will never be topped.)"
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,SweetDisarray,2,Wed Apr 22 10:20:50 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you got downvoted, I absolutely agree with you. Freak Show was the last season of AHS I'll watch. It sucks because the production is great and the show has an amazing cast, but they're wasting it by giving them nonsensical storylines and irrelevant subplots.  The writers just seem to add scary shit after scary shit for shock's sake but it never goes anywhere. I know I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but now that Lange is gone I'm done with this show."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,vespo,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:54:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you!  I agree with you on Lange leaving too.  I'm going to give the next season a shot, but I'm not going to invest the time if I see it going downhill again."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,SweetDisarray,4,Fri Apr 24 03:22:57 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Freakshow is better than Coven. Freakshow has some genuinely scary and memorable moments but the overall story is slow at times. Dandy (Finn Wittrock) made the season for me. Twisty is the most horrific thing on any season of AHS. There are 2 episodes in particular that are among the best of the entire series- Edward Mordrake Part 2, and Orphans."
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,bwood16,1 point,Sat Apr 25 11:18:42 2015 UTC,I thought the Edward Mordrake episodes were the best from the entire series. It was so good!
AmericanHorrorStory,33c0mt,Casualdancemonkey,1 point,Sat Apr 25 12:23:43 2015 UTC,It was a mic check to see if the producers could still do scary after pulling that fucking Harry Potter shit in Season 3.

AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,CaptainDyslexia,83,Mon Apr 20 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"I loved the formula of showing a flashback in the beginning, and having the episode be about that particular ghost. Plus it was so simple and straightforward. Every season since has had a ton of different storylines that didn't really go anywhere"
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,Supermant,32,Tue Apr 21 00:08:24 2015 UTC,The flashback formula in Asylum made me feel like I was.just as crazy as the characters. I really enjoyed that. Cause you see a flashback and assume it's the true story and then find out it wasn't.
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,2edgy420me,6,Tue Apr 21 03:09:42 2015 UTC,This hits the nail on the head. They really need to get back to a central theme and have all the characters be somehow connected to the central theme.
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,forshow,47,Tue Apr 21 13:56:46 2015 UTC,"The main thing for me was that I got attached to the characters. When the season ended it felt like I got to know all the characters and now I had to say good-bye. A lot of people call Violet just an ""angsty teen"", but I thought she was a pretty complex character emotionally. Tate was also very complex and well-developed. He was a psycopathic rapist murderer, all while being a charming, sensitive, emotionally hurt teenage boy. The relationship between Ben and Vivien had multiple layers. I think the characters and the relationships between characters having multiple dimensions and layers made them seem so real. Violet hated her parents, but then sometimes she would cry for their help and they would all be together happily. Ben and Viv seemed happy together sometimes, then other times they were sick of each other. Tate had his evil side, but he also had his caring and sensitive side.   Then there was the excellent use of cognitive dissonance that made the show so entertaining. There was so much circumstantial evidence that the house was haunted, but the Harmon family were rational people, and circumstantial evidence wasn't going to be enough to prove the house was actually haunted. That cognitive dissonance, partially believing the house was haunted, but also believing it's not, drove the story in my opinion."
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,kenbrellfan,28,Tue Apr 21 01:09:57 2015 UTC,"My friends and I still refer to them as ""Violet"" and ""Tate"", regardless of which season we are talking about."

AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,Voldewarts,62,Tue Apr 21 20:19:16 2015 UTC,"It was the first of AHS. As a viewer, we didn't know what to expect.  Also, it had supernatural elements to it instead of crazy psychotic killer or deformed characters."
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,aids_bot,27,Mon Apr 20 23:20:35 2015 UTC,"The supernatural is what makes it the best for me. I love supernatural Horror. The other seasons have been interesting in their own way, but just for me personally the super natural elements are what make it scary."
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,littleotterpop,14,Tue Apr 21 01:02:38 2015 UTC,"What I personally enjoyed as a viewer was figuring out what was happening throughout. The mystery, the excitement, the plot twists & all that. It felt more real (if that makes any sense) which made it a lot more creepy to me. The writing was pretty great throughout & the build up was intense. It wasn't predictable & you never knew what was going to happen."
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,GrumpySatan,11,Tue Apr 21 01:09:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. The mystery was such a big part of Murder House, and has been lacking somewhat in later seasons. There were mysteries throughout the whole season that kept people invested and interested. Who was the rubber man? Was Violet dead? What happened with Constance and the other ghosts that made them hate her? What will happen with half the family dead and the other half alive?  The mystery was more prominent, the main characters were largely unawares and skeptical, and this was the driving force behind the season."
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,waaarg,11,Tue Apr 21 02:02:52 2015 UTC,"Seriously, the ""Violet is dead"" twist still stands as my absolute favorite part of any season of AHS."

When she OD'ed on the pills and Tate had her throw up in the tub, my wife and I were like ""ok is she really still alive or what?""  And from then on we kept looking for hints that she was either dead or alive and then when the big reveal came it was still such a shock!"

I loved the feeling of creepiness that you get from Murder House.  Asylum was the same way.  Coven and Freak show were good but they didn't have the suspense and intensity the first two seasons had
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,hot_toddy_2684,5,Tue Apr 21 02:20:46 2015 UTC,"With Murder House I couldn't wait until the next episode...with Freak Show I thought ""well, I owe it to the series to get through until the end"""
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,alwaysfrombehind,5,Tue Apr 21 16:38:17 2015 UTC,"The storylines all played on each other. There were mysteries that built up, and then were resolved. There was pay off.  Things didn't feel abruptly ended after being shown as a big deal. There seemed to be decent rules and they seemed to be followed, so it made sense in it's own universe.    Plus all the things people said about it being a new kind of show, first of its kind, etc."
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,RedditMayne,8,Tue Apr 21 07:40:34 2015 UTC,Subtlety.   After murder house they have just thrown everything and the kitchen sink at you along with spelling everything out.
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,nunswithknives,4,Tue Apr 21 07:39:23 2015 UTC,It wasn't about any one character's personal journey--the house was the main character from the start. I would welcome a return to Murder House in a future season--there are just so many more stories that can still be told. Remember the awesome back stories from FX's defunct www.youregoingtodieinthere.com?
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,Tatemylove,7,Tue Apr 21 00:11:08 2015 UTC,"It had a lot of shocking content without trying to outdo itself. It felt natural as opposed to ""OMG look at this weird stuff we're showing you! Aren't you disturbed?... please?...."""
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,Casualdancemonkey,4,Tue Apr 21 04:56:50 2015 UTC,"Probably because there has never been a show like this before. From the way it was shot, to the supernatural aspect. I think the originality of it was what made us hooked on AHS."
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,seabiscuits89,2,Tue Apr 21 04:11:47 2015 UTC,"I really felt for the characters of Murder house, all of them. They all had something unfortunate happen to them and now they were stuck. And besides the theme of the house, there was the underlying theme of family and motherhood. All of the characters were struggling with some aspect of family, and it held it all together on another level. Subsequent seasons haven't had this underlying sorrow lingering through."
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,mclovinsgirl,2,Tue Apr 21 03:04:52 2015 UTC,"for me it was Connie Britton's hair. And also the way Lily Rabe yelled ""Chaaaaarles!"" for half an episode. And the opening credits gahhhhh.  p.s. The piano music throughout Halloween: Parts I & II and the DBC. So devastating. And my favorite AHS moment of all time.... ""I didn't lose my baby"". God the tears."
AmericanHorrorStory,33af4u,Voldewarts,3,Wed Apr 22 06:58:12 2015 UTC,"I think the storyline was easier to follow because it wasn't all over the place. I feel like the subsequent seasons (specifically Asylum and Freak Show) had side storylines that were never really fleshed out and just took away from the overall story of each season. Plus, because the plot was simpler and there weren't as many main characters, viewers got to really know the characters."

AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,davis98,10,Sat Apr 18 23:56:43 2015 UTC,"And i think what made him so scary was that they didnt keep him around for so long, it kinda gets less scary if a character is around for 9- episodes it makes you familiar with the character and makes him less impactful"
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,MyNamesNotObama,4,Sun Apr 19 00:07:51 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons he was so scary was because he had no humanity. When he was given a humanizing backstory, the ""fear of the unknown"" aspect about him was lost."
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,ynmsgames,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:06:26 2015 UTC,"He wouldn't be scary if they kept him around for 9+ episodes, but he didn't make much of an impact of the overarching narrative because he was only in 4 episodes."

AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,MyNamesNotObama,3,Mon Apr 20 01:24:16 2015 UTC,I completely agree with your sentiment.  I think Twisty was one of the strongest characters in Freak Show and I really wanted to see him used more.  I would have loved to see a showdown between Dandy and Twisty.  I feel like they just rushed his story while everybody else's was slowly drawn out through the entire season.

AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,SimeonsDilemma,15,Sun Apr 19 08:06:53 2015 UTC,"Stop obsessing over having multiple ""popular"" guests stars. It makes the show cluttered and not enough focus is put on them.  Ex: Neil Patrick Harris and Matt Bomer in Freak Show, both actors played interesting roles, but we're not given a chance to develop as characters. Make the audience care about the characters. The only character I really cared about was Seal Boy last season, other than that I found everyone else kind of annoying. We need more Lana Winters, more Tates,  more Violets, and Foina like characters that we can really connect with.  (Spoilers) Storyline. We need a complex and interesting storyline. In Freak Show I felt like it was all about how many people can we cram on camera and in order to axe out everyone's unfinished storylines they massacred all the freaks, this is not good writing. I feel like the writers really need to sit down and write a great simple plot like back in season 1 for Hotel and not focus on big name guest stars, they already have Lady Gaga, I can't imagine them needing anymore big names than her!"
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,amandahayman,3,Mon Apr 20 05:49:49 2015 UTC,"Season 1 had a lot of plots on the peripheral that were replaceable (Piggy, Piggy; the Black Dahlia) but at least there was a core story. Season 4 summed up to nothing more than vignettes. The theme, ""the real freaks of society are those considered normal"" remained the same from the first to last episode. If the show wants to have guest starts, they need to be there to enhance the characters arcs, not add another element to it.  The writers need to decipher who the main characters of the story are (no more than 3 or 4) and who the secondary characters are."
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,anandamidetrip,0,Sun Apr 19 13:59:55 2015 UTC,Well Freak Show was rewritten to take out many parts that included singing because there were so many negative reviews. It's kind of hard to rewrite a show on such short notice and make it good at the same time.
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,blaqkaudioxd,4,Sun Apr 19 23:11:35 2015 UTC,"I think that is indicative of the biggest problem with this show, they need to just write it and shoot it true to their vision, not change it after every review. No one is ever going to be 100% happy with every element, but we might appreciate those less appealing elements later when we see how they helped move the story to a satisfying end. If there is no end in sight when writing begins, then what is the point of the story?"
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,psychobirdgirl,39,Sun Apr 19 19:30:05 2015 UTC,No alien subplots in Asylum. It was a creepy enough season without that. To me it was the most useless story.
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,MissSolo,9,Mon Apr 20 00:21:20 2015 UTC,A big theme of Asylum was science vs religion and unless I'm mistaken the aliens were supposed to represent the two intersecting.
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,kalila855,2,Sun Apr 19 01:27:01 2015 UTC,"I personally liked the alien subplot but wouldn't mind seeing Asylum without it. It didn't add anything but it was pretty entertaining for me, at least."
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,babyvomit,2,Wed Apr 22 03:15:05 2015 UTC,"At first glance, I did not appreciate the alien plot line.  Rewatching it for the third or fourth time, I saw the aliens more as an omnipotent presence that mirrored God.  Once I saw that connection, everything involving the aliens took on a new meaning for me.  Asylum was all about crashing science and religion together.  Aliens and the existence of God are two of the biggest unknowns for mankind, and seeing those two forces at work in Briarcliff gives the season an extra layer to soak in."
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,SweetDisarray,6,Tue Apr 21 16:30:02 2015 UTC,The aliens were one of the best parts!
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,mrrobopuppy,7,Fri Apr 24 03:39:54 2015 UTC,"I disagree. To me, Asylum was about how horrific people can be, and having aliens in the season detracted from that."
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,bcapiro,12,Sun Apr 19 15:51:14 2015 UTC,"To me, Asylum was how humans react to unbeatable odds. All of the evils: Dr. Arden's office, the Asylum, Bloody Face's dungeon; were ""unbeatable"" scenarios. The Aliens were a perfect representation of something so beyond us that we can not possibly defeat it that has mysterious or malicious intent."

AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,GamingTatertot,2,Sun Apr 19 19:02:00 2015 UTC,The only thing I liked about the aliens was that it showed a parallel to the experiments in the asylum.
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,Casualdancemonkey,2,Sun Apr 19 19:17:27 2015 UTC,"Every season has been about how horrific people can be (although you're right, Asylum definitely emphasized this).

There are so many elements that feel unnecessary and need to be taken out. They end up destabilizing the core (if there is one).  Take away the melodrama. It only felt appropriate for season 3.  And they use the explanation ""some people are evil"" way too much. I'd like to see a more grey area for character motivations (like Lana Banana)"
AmericanHorrorStory,3321gv,anandamidetrip,2,Tue Apr 21 06:21:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the ""grey"" characters.  I think that's why I loved Asylum so much.

I do like how they kept it dark, though. But I really wouldn't change anything.  Season 2: No Grace. I can deal with the aliens, but I felt like the time spent on Grace or Kit/Grace could have been spent elsewhere.  Season 3: Hank Foxx needs to go. What an uncharismatic tool. Another waste of screen time. The other males on this season couldn't even SPEAK and they were more interesting than him. I have a hard time believing that Cordelia/Sarah would want to make a baby with this dude.  Season 4: I hated how"

I know not everyone will agree but in my personal opinion, it could have been done a little better!!  It wasn't the worst it could have been,  but it Definately wasn't he best either.  And if I couldn't change that then I would have changed Misty Day or Dandy's endings.  By this I mean I would have changed the way Dandy killed the freaks, as well as the way the freaks killed Dandy.  I felt like Misty Day had such a brilliant, well written character but she got the short end of the stick and an undeserving ending.

Papa Legba noted that Nan wasn't completely innocent, but he specifically mentioned the place he was taking her was full of treats.  He has no reason to betray someone he hasn't dealt with before.  Although Nan was part of the bargain that Fiona and Marie were trying to strike, Legba realized Nan was their pawn.  She's linked to him because Fiona and Marie were trying to summon him, but now Nan is under his jurisdiction and it looks like he's going to take good care of her.  As for Fiona and Misty, they are truly in their own personal Hells.  According to Wikipedia, Papa Legba is the intermediary between the mortal world and Guinee, the spirit world of Vodou.  He is part of a group of Loa, and not immediately responsible for people in Heaven or Hell.  He may have contact with them, but he has little influence over where they go and if they come back."

AmericanHorrorStory,32uiz6,ZomNoms,11,Thu Apr 16 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"Well tbh they're so cold and isolated with each other because the only thing they have in common is that they're all witches, but they all come from very, very different backgrounds and don't appear to share any interests. To make matters worse they didn't seem to care as much about the Coven as they did their own personal issues (Zoe's focus is mainly on Kyle, Madison wanting to be the next Supreme, Misty finding her ''tribe'', Queenie feeling like an outsider because she's black and traces her roots back to voodoo, unlike the others, Fiona obsessed with not dying and killing her replacement, Myrtle bringing down Fiona, Cordelia feeling useless and powerless, Nan on Luke) and this prevented them from banding together to protect the Coven, and that almost ended them."

In 1868, Marion Warton, The Supreme, the most powerful witch of the generation and a prominent socialite back then, reclaimed the building and reinstated it as a school as a cover-up, but in reality turned it into a safe haven for young witches to learn and hone their powers. Due to many women of the bloodline choosing not to reproduce, the population dwindled from at most 60 in the academy, to the present of just four girls."

AmericanHorrorStory,32uiz6,xx_lilbbygrl_xx,8,Thu Apr 16 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"I felt like season 3 tried to do too much, and never really settled on a plot/theme. There were so many interesting ideas that were never really explored. I wanted to see more of those stick creatures in the woods during the opening credits, as well as the hooded people. And the main character's whole 'kills boys she sleeps with' power never gets explored again. There was a bunch more, but my point is that they could have done so much more with it."
AmericanHorrorStory,32uiz6,goonglasses,8,Fri Apr 17 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"i liked coven until towards the end of the series and i started to think about it. it was the first season with no clear direction. in the first episode you think it's gonna be about her black widow style sex powers. then it's the witches vs the voodoos, then witch hunters, then the racist chick (i forget her name). the only continuous thing was jessica lange's mortality and her struggle to be immortal. yeah it was a weird series  THEN THERE WAS THAT STUPID LAST EPISODE THAT STARTED WITH LIKE A STEVIE NICKS MUSIC VIDEO!! why was stevie nicks there? it was so stupid. then zoe died stupidly. like they're teleporting everywhere then she's impaled. what!?"
AmericanHorrorStory,32uiz6,signu1230,3,Fri Apr 17 11:07:13 2015 UTC,I love Stevie Nicks but her inclusion in AHS was bizarre. Just completely forced. I feel like it's one of Ryan Murphy's pitfalls
AmericanHorrorStory,32uiz6,goonglasses,3,Fri Apr 17 19:57:15 2015 UTC,"I think this is somewhat explained in the show; Fiona was supposed to be their teacher and mentor, but instead did nothing but try to hold on to her power. They even say throughout the season that she had failed the coven, and that she isn't even around most of the time. In the flashbacks, it looks like more of an actual school because they have a Supreme who cares about the girls. Same with Cordelia at the end of the season. The lack of education rested entirely on Fiona."
AmericanHorrorStory,32uiz6,pukey-beautez,2,Fri Apr 17 21:05:22 2015 UTC,"I think Cordelia's relationship with Fiona put her into a gray area when it came to the coven.  Due to feeling neglected and unwanted for most of her life, Cordelia was afraid to take bold measures or make big decisions.  She was the headmistress of the school, but Fiona was the Supreme.  Whatever decisions Cordelia might have made could have been easily undone by Fiona due to the simple fact that she outranks Cordelia.  When she first meets the other girls, Fiona even tells them ""You're never going to become great women in our clan sitting around here at Hogwarts under the confused instruction of my daughter.""  Although Fiona didn't really care about the school, she certainly had opinions about Cordelia's capabilities of running it.  With the leader of their organization largely unavailable, Cordelia couldn't really do much aside from looking for other girls to join the school.  Early on in the show she states the witches of Salem are a dying breed.  Even without knowing about Hank using the coven's resources to systematically hunt down other witches, Cordelia was struggling to find other students.  There can't BE a school without students, so Cordelia's main focus was looking for fellow witches."

Just in case there is some reference to it in season 5. As for the Elisa Lam story. I thought that too. I agree with you, and I don't think you are grasping at straws.  There is also a story behind Lady Gaga about this up and coming singer named Lina Morgana jumping to her death from the roof of a hotel in NY....  Some say Lady Gaga copied her style and rose to fame. That Lina's death opened a door for Gaga. As the story goes Gaga was hired to write songs for this Lina... when she died Gaga stepped in. So I read up on that story too.  One never knows where AHS will go. They seem to touch on many real life stories in each season."

That American Horror Story is coming out? Well yeah, it sure is.

My guess would be no, just  because after seeing what it's like to  be a ghost bound to the house, and realizing adelaide is better off dead than ghost, she'd want her life to end in peace and just be over."
AmericanHorrorStory,32pba4,doomsday1216,20,Wed Apr 15 17:20:03 2015 UTC,I think Adelaide's perspective is a deal breaker. She wouldn't want to die in the house. She would be with a lot of ghosts who hate her or she's done wrong also.
AmericanHorrorStory,32pba4,Guckalienblue,8,Wed Apr 15 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"She hung around plenty of ghosts that hated her in that house during season one. If they wanted her dead they could have easily killed her, as the ghosts seem to be corporeal inside the house."

AmericanHorrorStory,32pba4,mrrobopuppy,11,Thu Apr 16 00:27:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think Constance would want to be stuck in the house.  There's plenty of people there who don't like her and even if she didn't socialize with them, they're basically her only option for companionship until a new family moves in or Halloween rolls around.    Considering how many terrible things have happened in the house, up to and including the Harmon family, Constance could probably buy the house for a song, but she hasn't done it.  She even refers to the house a lemon when she speaks to the real estate agent once it's put on the market again."
AmericanHorrorStory,32pba4,signu1230,4,Wed Apr 15 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"I think she likes to exercise a certain control over the murder house and its inhabitants, she doesn't want to be the ghosts equal she wants to be their master."
AmericanHorrorStory,32pba4,Olly_Olly,7,Thu Apr 16 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"That's exactly it. She likes being the living one who gets to make jabs at the ghosts, then leave. At the same time though, I'm not sure that would be enough to stop her if she was actually dying.   Other comments mention Ade and how she was happy not to be stuck in the house but Constance is the ultimate when it comes to being selfish and youth obsessed. She wouldn't want to sink to the ghosts'  level but I also don't think she would give up the chance of having that pale imitation of immortality."
AmericanHorrorStory,32pba4,Lyco_499,3,Thu Apr 16 10:59:53 2015 UTC,"Very good question. Don't think I've seen anyone ask this one before. I'll say ""no"" because she will have to take care of her grandson. He will outlive her. Plus I don't think the ghosts would want her there. I can't imagine her returning now. The Harmons, Hayden and Moira surely hate her. And  the house has nothing for her except Tate(who despises her) and Beau (I don't think Constance cared for him as much as she think she did)."

AmericanHorrorStory,32pngc,thegreenmachine90,19,Wed Apr 15 18:24:50 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't ever recall Moira giving a specific number of ghosts, and I've seen this season at least a dozen times so I think I would've caught that. I think you just imagined this or saw a similar number elsewhere, but no one ever gave an exact number on the show.  Regardless there are 25 ghosts in the house by the end of the season: 1) Charles Montgomery, 2) Nora Montgomery, 3) Elizabeth Short (Black Dahlia), 4 & 5) Maria and Gladys (the nurses), 6 & 7) Troy and Bryan (the redheaded twins), 8) Moira O'Hara, 9) Hugo Langdon, 10) Lorraine Harvey (Larry's wife), 11 & 12) Margaret and Angie Harvey (Larry's daughters), 13) Beauregard Langdon, 14) Tate Langdon, 15) Chad Warwick, 16) Patrick, 17 & 18) Fiona and Dallas (two of the home invaders - yes, Dallas died in the house too, they were both seen multiple times as ghosts; Bianca was the only one who got out of the house), 19) Hayden McClaine, 20) Violet Harmon, 21) Travis Wanderly, 22) Phil (the exterminator who discovers Violet's body, everyone forgets him but he does show up as a ghost in the finale), 23) Vivien Harmon, 24) Jeffrey Harmon (Vivien's stillborn), 25) Ben Harmon  Also note that the Infantata is NOT a ghost. Thaddeus died outside of the house and was later brought back to life thanks to Charles. He is still very much alive and aging in the basement."
AmericanHorrorStory,32pngc,ahsfreakshow,4,Wed Apr 15 19:06:02 2015 UTC,I don't know if we can count him but there was Constance's albino son.
AmericanHorrorStory,32pngc,israeldmo,1 point,Thu Apr 16 04:49:20 2015 UTC,The albino son?
AmericanHorrorStory,32pngc,ahsfreakshow,7,Thu Apr 16 13:17:55 2015 UTC,"That's true. In the second episode Constance says she had four children, but we only ever met Tate, Addie, and Beau. The fourth child was supposed to be an albino who was also a ghost in the house. He was meant to be included in the story and they even filmed scenes for him to appear in the first episode but at the last minute they cut him out entirely. So I guess technically you could count him, but I was just counting the ghosts that we've for sure seen in the house. Obviously there's bound to be more that we don't know about."
AmericanHorrorStory,32pngc,ahsfreakshow,4,Thu Apr 16 13:57:25 2015 UTC,I always wondered about her fourth child. I didn't know they actually filmed any scenes with him. Do you know where I could find those deleted scenes?
AmericanHorrorStory,32pngc,ahsfreakshow,4,Thu Apr 16 14:13:26 2015 UTC,"Sadly I don't think any full video exist anywhere, just a few screencaps of him in that one scene with Tate. They likely cut him out of the story after the pilot was filmed because he didn't appear anywhere else. Just that one scene is all that we know of."
AmericanHorrorStory,32pngc,ahsfreakshow,3,Thu Apr 16 15:56:19 2015 UTC,I think it would be interesting if he moved to New Orleans to work for Myrtle Snow. Remember the guards that came with her to get Zoe? They were albino.
AmericanHorrorStory,32pngc,Zinthaniel,0,Thu Apr 16 18:12:31 2015 UTC,"That would be cool. Except, you know, he's dead and trapped in the house, so..."
AmericanHorrorStory,32pngc,Tehddy,0,Thu Apr 16 20:14:05 2015 UTC,Where does it mention either of that?
AmericanHorrorStory,32pngc,bwood16,2,Thu Apr 16 20:22:07 2015 UTC,"That scene he was in takes place immediately after Ben catches Tate in Violet's room and tells him to leave. Tate goes on about fear of rejection and storms out, and he's supposed to find himself in the nursery, where his brother has hung up all those creepy headless dolls that you see in the screencap. The brother then sneaks up on Tate and scares him. So unless this fourth child also had the ability to break into the Harmon's house and put up that whole display, it's pretty safe to assume that he's also a ghost. If you want more information then watch Ryan's pilot commentary on the DVD, I'm pretty sure that was where he confirmed the fourth Langdon child."

AmericanHorrorStory,32kr5l,hfist,0,Sun May 31 23:45:43 2015 UTC,"Freakshow was really good- I think there were a lot of people that didn't care about the show after Twisty was gone, but thats a shame because it was a good season."
AmericanHorrorStory,32kr5l,mrignatiusjreily,4,Tue Apr 14 20:21:57 2015 UTC,"I bought the season on Amazon Prime and binge watched it last week...it was much better watching it over a short amount of time as opposed to a week to week basis!  Plus the second time around you catch things you didn't necessarily pick up on the first time around.  I think Murderhouse was the best written along with Asylum..they had good stories and character development.  Coven and Freakshow imo were the best theatrically..the best settings, characters, etc.  And yes...a lot of fair weather fans copped out after the twisty story took its toll, but it was still well done as far as im concerned.  I didn't really like the ending but it wasn't terrible I guess!  Edit: let me clarify..I bought the Freakshow season on Amazon..I already had the first three seasons thanks to Netflix!  I imagine Freakshow will be on netflix some time around December like a Coven was last year!!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,32kr5l,Davidoff1983,3,Tue Apr 14 22:33:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you- Freakshow certainly gave us some great characters: Dandy, Bette/Dot, Elsa, Edward Mordrake for example. The plot of Freakshow wasn't always so clearly drawn out, and I don't think it was as entertaining as Coven. But what I liked about it was how dark and grisly it was despite the bright carnival colors. Twisty genuinely gave me nightmares and there really were some great moments- Dandy's puppet, Penny's face tattoo, Maggie's death and Matt Bomer's death stand out as some of the most horrific and iconic  in the entire series."

AmericanHorrorStory,32kr5l,iamcarlbarker,3,Wed Apr 15 04:08:55 2015 UTC,"A bit late to the party, but I really enjoyed Coven. I started watching Murder House a long time ago and just couldn't get past the first two episodes. A month ago, I decided to give AHS another try and started with Coven and really enjoyed it. I then watched Asylum which helped me appeciate the re-occuring actors, then started Murder House again with a new appreciation for AHS in general. I actually watched the entire season in a day. I definitely don't see how people could dislike Coven as much as it seems because it's the season that got me hooked on the show in the first place."

A while back some article was run on her being crazy and that is where these rumors come from. She is indeed reclusive and had always been known to be odd, but that whole aliens thing is crap.

Have that social commentary backed up by strong characters, and the idea that our system of justice is corrupt. You can show how not all police are bad, but the pressure is there to be complicit, you can show that struggle, and the violence that comes with it. I think it could work. Find something supernatural to mix in maybe."

AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,bwood16,24,Mon Apr 13 16:05:21 2015 UTC,"You're exactly right. So many people overlook that crucial scene after Zoe's death when Myrtle finally realizes it might be Cordelia. Myrtle says that, because Delia was undermined all her life, her innate abilities sought out other vessels in all the girls, which was why it seemed like they all could've been the Supreme. And, just as you say, that's why those two scenes were juxtaposed; Madison is drained of her power (which is really Cordelia's) and becomes defenseless, while at the same time Cordelia performs the last of the Seven Wonders."
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,ahsfreakshow,9,Mon Apr 13 17:27:55 2015 UTC,I really always wondered why they had ALL the girls in the school try to perform the 7 wonders when they knew they could very well die in the process. Why kill off the whole squad? This explanation makes more sense though - they all just weren't that magical. Thanks!  Except Queenie... being a human Voodoo doll is pretty awesome.
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,LadyLunchable,8,Tue Apr 14 15:52:06 2015 UTC,this guy knows his shit^
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,ness1215,11,Mon Apr 13 22:52:19 2015 UTC,"My interpretation was when the reigning supreme was dying all the other girls' powers spiked and were overpowered. Madison had a huge arsenal of powers. But once Delia was chosen through the Seven Wonders, their powers went back to normal. Maybe she wasn't as powerful as before."
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,kyroko,8,Mon Apr 13 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"Madison had powers way before Cordelia became supreme or Fiona really started to fade. I think it's more about vulnerability, particularly an unexpected vulnerability, that witches have. Look at Marie Laveau when Hank was about to shoot her, she could have destroyed him and her power had nothing to do with the white witches. Cross apply to when LaLaurie was chopping her to pieces, she still had powers then but was vulnerable."
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,isabell_lovely,3,Tue Apr 14 20:39:39 2015 UTC,Thank all of you for pointing this out.  It had never occurred to me Cordy becoming supreme sucked the excess powers out of the girls.  Just figured it was one of those tv mishaps.
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,tinyshroom,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:27:33 2015 UTC,"why do you assume her powers disappeared? i believe her failing at magic before her death was because she was defeated. she let kule strangle her, imo - it wasn't worth trying to fight it, she just didn't care anymore after realizing she couldn't be supreme"
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,anandamidetrip,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:10:35 2015 UTC,"At the very least, Madison lot her pyrokenesis ability- This is evident when she struggles to light her cigarette with a lighter. Earlier she could light a cigarette with her mind, but in that scene they show her struggling to actually use the lighter. This is because she lost the powers she had during the 7 wonders once Cordelia became supreme."
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,mrignatiusjreily,0,Wed Apr 22 15:24:11 2015 UTC,Personally Ive always understood what they were trying to do with Madison's death - show that the supremes power jump from witch to watch. But it's synonymous with Lalaurie revealing that she was always racist; it undermines any chraracter development.
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,recovering_spaz,10,Mon Apr 13 19:26:24 2015 UTC,"It doesn't since one of Coven's themes was second chances. If you noticed all the characters that survived changed into different people. People like Madison, Delphine, Marie, and Fiona had many opportunities to change their ways, but were all too stubborn and actually got worse, especially Madison and Fiona. Since they could never learn their lesson, they all died."
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,mrignatiusjreily,3,Mon Apr 13 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"Nice.  I never really looked at the character transformation that way but upon reading your theOry, I couldn't agree more!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,anandamidetrip,5,Mon Apr 13 22:53:46 2015 UTC,I thought Marie was damned after she gave Papa Legba that first baby.
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,mrignatiusjreily,2,Tue Apr 14 14:18:35 2015 UTC,Marie was a hypocrite. She called Delphine a monster but she was an annual baby killer. She also didn't care about the white people she killed on Halloween night. She had every opportunity to do the right thing and stop killing babies but she didn't. That's what I meant. Sorry for not being clear on that.
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,anandamidetrip,-1,Tue Apr 14 15:06:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing about the themes. My problem with these situations, and coven as a whole, weren't the ideas but the execution. Saying the girls powers weren't theirs takes away a large part of their characterization. They set up Lalaurie's arc to move towards one of redemption, and after being tourtured and seen crying over roots, it seemed as though she realized the tourture she put her slaves through was wrong. They took back what was already established. Considering she was a sociopath, it makes sense she still loves torture, but instead of just blacks she should have tortured all races."
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,mrignatiusjreily,2,Mon Apr 13 23:35:08 2015 UTC,"Taking away the girls' powers doesn't undermine their development. Their increasing powers inflated their egos, hence them wanting to become supreme.  Since only Zoe and Queenie survived, they learned more about becoming stronger, more solidified witches, regardless of the powers they lost at the end of the story. She tortured blacks because she saw them as not really people, but she obviously had no problem killing white people. She was about to kill her husband and the house tour lady. She just preferred killing blacks.  You are right when you say Delphine's arc was one of redemption, but failed to understand the theme that her storyline fit under. Almost every character had a redemption storyline from Zoe to Cordelia. They made up for their past mistakes and came out stronger because they represent the future. You may have wanted Delphine to change, but she represents history's past, which can't be changed. Delphine was tortured by her longtime black enemy. Why would that make her realize racism is wrong? She liked killing blacks because she saw them as not human. She had no problem killing white people, like her husband and the house tour lady."
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,anandamidetrip,0,Tue Apr 14 01:52:41 2015 UTC,"Their increasing powers inflated their egos   That's why I found the young witches to be boring. They got random (and inconsistent) spikes of powers and then proclaimed they're the next supreme, never really showing that power again. It would make more sense if they experienced moments of weakness and used their powers from within to fight their enemies. Then their use of powers would fit the theme of woman empowerment. Instead they bitched and fought each other after gaining powers.    Almost every character had a redemption storyline from Zoe to Cordelia   These were a hodgepodge of a mess. From episode to episode their story's and motivations changed. Fiona sided with the coven, changed sides a few more times, then decided she loved her daughter. Queenie and Zoe didn't really have much of any - they did some stuff in the season (Mostly backstabbing and switching sides - Zoe with Madison & Kyle, and Queenie with Marie) and were given spots on the council because they made it out alive? Cordelia was given supremacy as well. She wasn't a very good headmistress (married Hank, witches died under her care, she never taught them) yet got her title. Myrtle burning herself at the stake didn't make much sense since the people she killed murdered her first.  LaLaurie almost killed her husband (you said that she almost killed him then said she did - from what I remember Marie hung her whole family in the streets) and tortured her daughters for vengeance. She killed the house tour lady because she wanted the house again. But she never tortured them. If she experienced torture she could understand what she put her slaves through. Queenie was putting her through ""the black experience"", teaching her that her race isn't subhuman. They could have both developed LaLaurie's character and kept her arc consistent by having her torture freely since Lalaurie's a psychopath and have Queenie show her that black people are human.  The girls empowering themselves with their powers was a good idea. Same with Fiona killing the girls, Cordelia being supreme, and LaLaurie torturing again. It's the execution that left more to be desired."
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,mrignatiusjreily,2,Tue Apr 14 02:53:05 2015 UTC,"The little witches gaining powers were not inconsistent. They gained them through times of stress and being young witches. The girls rarely showed their powers because they all knew Fiona was trying to kill them. Its why Fiona brought in Stevie Nicks to convince Misty to compete in the Seven Wonders trial. The witches gained their powers but were immature and used their powers unwisely because, duh, they are highly emotional teenage girls. All that estrogen was going to lead to infighting eventually. It didn't help that Fiona's dark  presence in the house affected them negatively.   Zoe began to redeem herself for being formally weak when she saved the house during the zombie invasion. Onwards, she became more crafty and aware of the dangers to her life and clan. She never switched sides. She was actually the most loyal little witch to her coven. She killed Spaulding to avenge Madison, she was ready to retaliate against Marie after the zombie attack, she was ready to kill Fiona. Her conflict of finding her strength started when her frenemy Madison came back from the dead and attempted to push Zoe back into the sidekick role by forcing herself into her and Kyle relationship. Zoe kept cool about it out of respect for Madison but it clearly bothered her. She never backstabbed anyone.   Queenie was clearly a confused young woman. Pretending to be tough but was easily misled by people who could manipulate her insecurities, like being the only black witch in a witch house and wanting to feel empowered(her Hell of being an irrelevant manager at a chicken place). Both she and Zoe were elevated to council because of the unnecessary insanity they went through in that house.  Cordelia was an obviously bad headmistress. She was never empowered (though she believed she was at the beginning). She was teaching her girls incorrectly in two ways: in actual classes that were mentioned by Madison and by being a poor example of a leader. Her ultimate moment of weakness came when she begged Fiona to help her deal with the witch hunters after she previously attempted to kill her. Her coven was falling apart from dangers on the inside and out and she naturally didn't know how to handle it. Cordelia from episode 11 to  13 more than proved her capable of being a good leader.  You misunderstood Fiona's arc. She was always out to kill the coven from the beginning. It was the sparse moments of kindness and love that confused us into whether she could change for the better. She carried on a romance with the axeman to validate her reasoning in killing the coven and she killed the witch hunters to get them off her back, not so much the coven's.  Lalaurie did torture white people. She was planning on torturing the house tour lady definitely, she locked up her daughters for a year( breaking one's leg and stuffing another's mouth with shit) and her party guests with her Chamber of Horrors. We don't really know why she cried during the TV scene. She claimed she did because she was ashamed of America for treating black people equally. At that point she was finally free of her enemy Marie and the house, so more than likely she was going to regress back. Delphine is a murdering racist who prefers to kill blacks over whites. Most serial killers have a preference for their kills. She even explained why she liked killing blacks in episode 11. And sorry for the bad wording. I meant to write she almost killed her husband and the tour guide woman, so she has no problem killing whites.  You missed the point of Coven on their idea of female empowerment. The little witches all represented bad examples of female empowerment, like Nan being more interested in Luke than her dying clan of sisters. Cordelia had the most realistic struggles of becoming empowered and she actually overcame it. The point of the story was just because a bunch of powerful women have to live under one roof, doesn't mean they have to be catty and tear each other to bits (figuratively and literally lol)."
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,anandamidetrip,2,Tue Apr 14 05:43:35 2015 UTC,"The ""time of stress"" rule was confusing, probably intentionally so it could be changed on a whim. The girls never gained power when in danger from a real threat. The witches talked about how they were in a war (and danger) but never battled. And their powers were certainly inconsistent. Nan gained mind control just because it helped the writers have her do somethig in the episode. Zoe gained vitalism vitals bc she needed a reason to return.   Zoe switched sides from being Madison's friend to not, and all over a boy. Same with Kyle. She was going to kill him and literally 5 minutes later when he tried to kill himself he tried to stop him. She was loyal to the coven but after knowing Fiona wanted to kill them and tried to do the sacred taking, she let it go (Cordelia says she keeps Fiona around for a witch hunter bc they don't know the next supreme but if they killed the next supreme, wouldn't they figure out whose the next one since she has all the seven wonders?)  Everyone experienced insanity in that house. Myrtle even called them all psycopaths, because in a lot of ways they all ended up acting that way.   All Madison did was talk about classes. None were shown. I still think they misused the the boarding school setting. She did become a better leader. But I still think her telling the world about the coven would end up hurting them more (even though the show insinuated all was good because of this)  And axeman was nothing more than filler, dragging out Fiona's storyline so she had something to do while she was off not killing the girls. She was always a bad person, her caring about her daughter was shown in a few fleeting moments but they always emphasized her wickedness.  She never even talked about tourturing the house lady from what I can remember. And she said to her daughters that the bowl of eyeballs was a test to see if the boys were man enough for her daughters. Again, emphasizing her psychopathy. And you're right we didnt really know, but the show insinuated she was changing. When they revealed she was tortuirimg for racist reasons again, they took back the arc they were establishing. It wasn't a twist, it was a change of course.   And Ryan Murphy stated before the seasom that coven would be empowering for woman. Instead it was mostly pseudo-feminism emphasized by the catty fights. The girls fought each other over supreme until the last episode when they teamed up to fight the axeman. And they only fought him because he killed Fiona (the one who tried to oppress them and kill them)"
AmericanHorrorStory,32gdb5,mrignatiusjreily,1 point,Tue Apr 14 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"All of the little witches were stressed: Zoe was dealing with crazy Madison and Zombie Kyle, along with her dying clan. Nan was stressed over Luke being abused. Misty was stressed by too many things to list. Queenie was stressed over delphine and crossing sides. The witches weren't officially in a war with the voodoos until the zombie attack. But then it was revealed Fiona was Madison's murderer, so all the attention was focused on her suddenly. It would have been cheesy and predictable if the girls were put in a life-or-death situation constantly to find a new power. They did it twice with Zoe and Queenie. They didn't have to keep doing it.  Zoe never stopped being Madison's friend. It was Madison who had it out for her. You got it twisted. Zoe was about to kill Kyle because she thought he was a thoughtless killing machine. Him attempting to kil himself was a sign he understood the concept of guns and suicide, proving he still had a mind. I don't understand what you mean about the witch hunters. Fiona was the only one strong enough to ""handle"" them, so Cordelia let her stay to help. Zoe probably followed Cordelia's orders about leaving Fiona alone so she could fight the hunters for them. If the witch hunters killed everybody, the clan would have been wiped out. If they killed everyone but Cordelia, she still might not have realized her destiny. I don't understand your question. Cordelia revealing witches to the world did more help than Fiona murdering the council. Since witches and hunters are now exposed to the world, we as society are now able to judge them according to their actions. Think about this: if witches are so bad then why didn't they just expose witches to the entire world?   The classes were described by various characters as pointless and irrelevant. All Cordy was doing was telling the girls to suppress themselves. Who wants to see that really? After Madison's disappearance, the zombie attack, and Cordelia's blinding, it's safe to assume that classes stopped well into the beginning of the story. And that didn't need to be mentioned either.  The axe man was not filler. He was a love interest, albeit a crazy one. His purpose was to inflate Fiona's ego even more and validate her reasoning for killing the girls. He was also yet another pawn in her game.  She didn't mention her intentions of torturing the house lady. The fact she didn't kill her right away would suggest she had more sinister plans for her. You can't blame the writing for making Delphine a monster. She really was one in real life. Its like making a fictional Hitler redeemed. The question of Delphine's arc was will she be redeemed? The answer was  no. Why are you so hung up on her redemption? She deserved her death and she could have never repented for her sins anyways.  Coven was true feminism. It showed women of different shades on the morality scale. You seem to have a narrow idea of feminism. It a not just weak innocent women overcoming men. It's showing women as normal people, capable of doing good, bad, and questionable things, which Coven did. The little witches killed the axe man because he had no right to kill her. Fiona was bad but her situation was a fucked up one, something only a witch(woman) could understand. They understood her dilemma better than he. That's why they killed him."

AmericanHorrorStory,32d4pe,bwood16,6,Thu Apr 16 22:42:27 2015 UTC,"Well to be honest, I didn't like Madison Montgomery, so I don't think I'll be watching this.  Between Scream Queens, American Crime Story, and AHS, one are all of these shows will be shortchanged due to time and effort with the production crew.   He's doing too much and the shows will suffer because of it."
AmericanHorrorStory,32d4pe,n_alvarez2007,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:14:09 2015 UTC,I just hope its not AHS that suffers.. The cast is too good!
AmericanHorrorStory,32duir,anandamidetrip,17,Sun Apr 12 23:46:27 2015 UTC,M. Night Shamalamadingdong twist. They are the ghosts. gasp
AmericanHorrorStory,32duir,nocchisus,13,Sun Apr 12 23:49:49 2015 UTC,Holy shit. That's how all the seasons are connected. O.O
AmericanHorrorStory,32duir,karleequeue,13,Mon Apr 13 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"I love supernatural Horror. I know murder house has ghosts, but I'd seriously love if they were incorporated into season 5 too."
AmericanHorrorStory,32duir,littleotterpop,9,Mon Apr 13 01:07:38 2015 UTC,"I have this theory that if you fuck with the balance of life and death, as in bringing a soul back from death, you curse the land and that's why there are ghosts in Murder House and Coven. It's probably not correct at all but I think that would be clever."
AmericanHorrorStory,32duir,DA-numberfour,2,Mon Apr 13 20:51:35 2015 UTC,I agree! Personally it makes more sense than a bunch of abortions keeping them trapped in the house.

AmericanHorrorStory,32duir,mermaid_quesadilla,-6,Mon Apr 13 22:39:50 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, there is no confirmation if she's returning at all. But considering she will be staring in another show, I think a small role might be the best option, and reprising Billie Dean could work perfectly, especially if they need an exorcism, connection to the spirit realm, etc.  Edit: Guess I spoke too soon"
AmericanHorrorStory,32duir,caravax,-7,Mon Apr 13 19:30:02 2015 UTC,I kinda don't want to watch because Sarah Paulson isn't in it 😞

AmericanHorrorStory,32egjt,theonewiththev,16,Mon Apr 13 03:03:05 2015 UTC,"A lot of weird characters, a lot of cool revolving door scenes, a lot of murderin, a lot of weird sexual scenes."
AmericanHorrorStory,32egjt,mrignatiusjreily,15,Mon Apr 13 06:26:24 2015 UTC,I don't know why but I think a broken elevator will be included. Just sayin.
AmericanHorrorStory,32egjt,jenniferamber,6,Tue Apr 14 06:38:14 2015 UTC,I think thats a good idea. Getting stuck in an elevator or an elevator falling is a pretty common fear- I could definitely see AHS tapping into that fear.
AmericanHorrorStory,32egjt,bwood16,5,Tue Apr 14 15:38:12 2015 UTC,"I predict something along that too, maybe a magical floor number? Something cool like that :)"

AmericanHorrorStory,32egjt,jenniferamber,7,Wed Apr 15 00:38:44 2015 UTC,"I think its going to be similar to Murder House in that it will feature stories that took place in the Hotel in both the present and the past. I don't think they'll do the ghost story again, instead I think it might involve some sort of cult staying at the hotel. I think it will feature real life hotel horror stories like HH Holmes' Murder Castle, and maybe even Elisa Lam, whose video in a hotel's elevator went viral for her strange behavior right before her death.   As for plot, its always so difficult to predict with AHS. Every season of AHS always turns out so different than I would have ever thought."

Action and possibly some supernatural elements from the past!!  Maybe a connection or two tied into a past season like last year...maybe Kathy Bates is Stanley's cousin? (Lol joking, I know this is most likely NOT the cAse since were probably going to see a present day timeline and the garden of Allah was torn down in the late 1950s but hey you never know right?!)"
AmericanHorrorStory,32egjt,mrignatiusjreily,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:37:48 2015 UTC,I have a feeling the connection for Hotel to a previous season will be Coven or Murder House.
AmericanHorrorStory,32egjt,baeanddot,2,Tue Apr 14 03:01:31 2015 UTC,There are rumors that they are filming at MH next year.
AmericanHorrorStory,32egjt,mrignatiusjreily,3,Tue Apr 14 10:39:41 2015 UTC,"Ooh hope it's true, but I do feel they need to touch up on the fact that real witches have been exposed to the world. Hopefully they could tie in both. A hotel setting is capable of pulling that off."

AmericanHorrorStory,32dh3b,PandoricaOpened,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:28:21 2015 UTC,I'm pretty that's the case they're following in the first Season of American Crime Story. Nice catch!
AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,davis98,19,Sat Apr 11 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"I love Angela and Frances too, but I don't want the cast to be too big. Coven and Freakshow had the problem of too big of a cast for 13 episodes"
AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,bwood16,16,Sat Apr 11 20:40:36 2015 UTC,"The Hotel setting will be really easy to have a big cast without overdoing it, though. Hotels have such big staffs, and there is a constantly changing group of guests. Not everyone has to be in the main cast."
AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,saxman481,19,Sat Apr 11 23:19:49 2015 UTC,"Coven didn't seem like too big of a cast as far as I can remember. Murder House, on the other hand. That cast could populate a small nation."
AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,BasketeerOverHere,15,Sat Apr 11 21:17:00 2015 UTC,The cast has been large each season. The difference between the first and last 2 seasons is that seasons 1 and 2 had a large cast that added to the established story. The characters in Coven and Freakshow mostly added new plots that ran parallel to each other.
AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,anandamidetrip,10,Sat Apr 11 22:07:56 2015 UTC,"Murder House's regular cast was just six people. The rest was primarily ghosts of varying importance, and I don't think they ever ""stole"" screen-time from more important characters, nor were they ever around when they weren't needed.  Frankly, I think Murder House was the only season that didn't do anything wrong at all with its cast-handling. Though I didn't have a real issue with Asylum, either."
AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,ViciousMihael,6,Sat Apr 11 22:35:40 2015 UTC,"Murder House had a lot of minor characters, but the main cast was only 6- Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, Dylan McDermott, Evan Peters, Denis O-Hare, and Taissa Farmiga"
AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,bwood16,2,Sat Apr 11 22:53:00 2015 UTC,"Murder House focused on two families, one crazy, one not.   Coven on the other hand had four witches in training, one supreme, one headmistress, a voodoo queen, an ancient racist, a frankenstein lover, a hippie woods witch, a guardian of veracity in the vernacular, and the Axeman. That cast was huge!"
AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,busmans,3,Tue Apr 14 00:33:10 2015 UTC,I agree wholeheartedly! Those are the only two I'm waiting for at this point as well. It would be nice to see Finn or Lily as well but I'm not gonna hold my breath for either.
AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,SimeonsDilemma,3,Sat Apr 11 21:10:19 2015 UTC,If they just stopped the gimmicks and focused on a good story I'd be happy.

AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,mistar_z,8,Sat Apr 11 20:18:58 2015 UTC,"Franny is doing the hulu show, but I'm sure there could be time for both. The angel of death was a smaller role, but it's my favorite of hers. I would also like to see Finn back, but maybe in a different type of role?"
AmericanHorrorStory,329gp0,BasketeerOverHere,2,Sat Apr 11 20:31:46 2015 UTC,I agree I think Ryan can always work something out in his favor..The angel of death roll was my favorite of hers too but I think she hit all of her characters right on the head and did a great job with all of them she was hilarious as Myrtle and as Gloria Mott!!  And yeah I'd like to see fin do something different he could maybe play a heroic type character this season or some type of police investigator or something like that

AmericanHorrorStory,329av7,Doctor_Arkham,11,Sat Apr 11 19:16:21 2015 UTC,"Ghosts can alter their appearance. Tate isn't ridden with bullet holes, and Black Dahlia doesn't always sport a Glasgow smile. It can be assumed that she aged intentionally. She wants men to ""see her as she is"" before revealing her age."
AmericanHorrorStory,329av7,davis98,5,Sat Apr 11 20:08:59 2015 UTC,"Then I wonder why Nora had the back of her head blown off, if ghosts generally don't have their wounds on them in the afterlife."
AmericanHorrorStory,329av7,BasketeerOverHere,7,Sat Apr 11 21:02:33 2015 UTC,"I also think it was implied that Nora's ghost didn't know she was dead? Or maybe I'm wrong. idk, Murder House was a long time ago."
AmericanHorrorStory,329av7,Pidgeysus,5,Sat Apr 11 21:13:31 2015 UTC,I think she just sort of slipped in and out of awareness of her situation.
AmericanHorrorStory,329av7,BasketeerOverHere,6,Sat Apr 11 21:14:21 2015 UTC,I think it's implied that because she killed herself she wasn't always fully aware of her situation. Like how violet didn't know she was dead either.
AmericanHorrorStory,329av7,Raddpixie,2,Sun Apr 12 00:30:42 2015 UTC,"You have a point, but I think that rule in the show's universe is kinda backwards. If you killed yourself, wouldn't you have more awareness that you're dead? Because you actually have time to prepare for it and you can see it coming, and make a definitive decision to make it happen. As opposed to being shot from across the room, where everything happens so fast that you don't have time to process it. Not necessarily in Violet's case because hers was an overdose that could have easily been unsuccessful. But Nora shot herself in the mouth, which is virtually impossible to fail at. Also, why does Tate not know he's dead if he was killed, not by suicide? I don't think this is actually a rule. I think every ghost is different and people just either know or they don't, and there's no reason for either of them. One just sort of...happens to you. I don't know if I'm making any sense though. I'm a couple drinks into the night."
AmericanHorrorStory,329av7,BasketeerOverHere,2,Sun Apr 12 00:37:09 2015 UTC,Maybe Tate counts as suicide by cop? Lol or maybe there aren't any rules.

AmericanHorrorStory,329av7,BasketeerOverHere,2,Sat Apr 11 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"As Moira, the maid, had said in the third episode of the first season, ""Men, they see what they want to see. Women, however, see into the soul of the person."" Ben had an affair with a younger girl, Hayden, while married to Vivian. Ben is a sexually active man and constantly throughout the season characters remark about his sexual fantasies and urges. In result of his personality and cravings, he sees Moira as a sexy and flirtatious young maid as the ghost of Moira is also enchanted to the house like the other ghostly character.   Plus the ghosts can only be seen by the living when they choose to be seen.  Remember after Vivien first died, her and Moira were talking in the kitchen and Viven heard been coming so she was about to try to hide and that's when Moira told Viven to calm down and that she could only be seen by ben if she so chose to be seen by him!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,329av7,theonewiththev,2,Sun Apr 12 16:55:49 2015 UTC,"I think the ghosts in the house are divided according to their personality. Moira does not physically ages, she shows her young being with the men to manipulate them, and she appears to be old Moira to keep control over the house. (Let's remember that since she has been a maid for other owners, she cannot show herself young with Vivien."
AmericanHorrorStory,329av7,CarpeRetractum,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:31:59 2015 UTC,"I think that Moira ages because she's a lot of time ""visible"" to other people (she's the maid of the past owners) so she also ages, but other ghost such as the black dhalia don't age because they are not always interacting with people.

I think that the Infantata could be an exception here: I think that the Infantata was kidnapped and killed off of the property, but Dr. Montgomery (perhaps with the assistance of the House) was able to bring it back to life--it's continuing to age (or at least its head is) because it's not a ghost but rather a re-animated corpse."

AmericanHorrorStory,327e5k,BasketeerOverHere,8,Sat Apr 11 21:19:36 2015 UTC,"So are you saying you dislike him or the characters he plays?  I personally think he is an amazing actor anyone who has the ability to make you dislike them because of the character they play is a good actor..A couple examples are Jessica Lange playing Constance, Finn Wittrock as dandy and Denis as stanley..they all gave amazing performances with very unlikable characters!!  Hell even the lady who plays the wife on breaking bad..I absolutely could not stand her character on that show but that makes for a good actress in my opinion!  A lot of times people forget to separate the actor themselves from the character they play and sometimes people take it out on the actor but in my opinion that's them just doing their job and a damn good one at that!!"

But as time went on she kinda came around after awhile.  But I will never forget the ""I _____ Ted"" episode lol!  I was mad at her for punishing her husband that way, becahse everything he did was truly for his family."

I expect to be scared, like legitimately scared, and no season aside from MH has done that. Sure, the others have been entertaining, but I have never had to check twice to make sure my doors are locked or laid in bed thinking about some crazy scene. That is what I want, to feel the same way the first time I saw the gimp or the crazy lady and Twins in the basement. Unfortunately, it will probably never happen again and I will likely find something else to fill the Wednesday night TV spot."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,ViciousMihael,5,Fri Apr 10 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"Watch Bates Motel, it has all of that tension and more. Personally, I found Murder House the least scary. It's all visual scares, very little disturbing stuff to back it up. I feel the other seasons are much better in the deeply uncomfortable horror."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,Atrumentis,2,Sat Apr 11 00:28:21 2015 UTC,"I felt Asylum had the scariest feeling to it.  I also was really digging the fact that they recorded all of Asylum on film as opposed to digital...and when they did flsshbacks, like with HAns Grouper they used an old hand crank camera!  But I still think murderhouse had the most jump scares...one of my favorite AHS scenes is when tate had violet Bring her high school junkie classmate over to the basement to scare her..and they shot the scene in the dark with some strobe light FX and it was the first time we really got to see Thaddeus/Infintata in action!!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,mommy2libras,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right! I agree, it had the most visual scares. I just don't get affected by them, so most of the scary stuff fell totally flat for me."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,Casualdancemonkey,4,Tue Apr 14 01:21:59 2015 UTC,"I understand how you feel. I absolutely love Murder House, Asylum, and Coven, but when I watched Murder House for the first time... almost every episode had me on edge. There was so much suspense and terror that I sympathized with, whereas in the show's other seasons, there's plenty of horror and some tension, but I can't put myself in the characters' shoes for the most part. In Murder House, I was scared for myself, not just the characters. It would be great if Hotel could feature that kind of suspense again."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,Tehddy,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:50:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah because all the characters are weird and unrelatable, where as in MH its a fairly normal family that are trapped in a house thats trying to kill them but they don't know it."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,Tehddy,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:31:38 2015 UTC,"That's why MH and FS are my favorites. MH was, like you said, the story of a (relatively) normal family who got into a scary place. In FS, while the story was outlandish, it was still plausible, especially for the time period. I enjoyed Asylum up until the whole alien or whatever bullshit and after that, it felt like a Stephen King ending. Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King but his endings suck- last minute supernatural explanations to an otherwise ""weird but could possibly happen to a normal person under certain circumstances"" are something he's known for. And Coven just didn't sit right with me from the get go. I plan to watch it again but am not sure what it is I'm looking for."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,grumblebuzz,1 point,Sat Apr 11 05:22:59 2015 UTC,"I was, and still am, completely in love with Murder house. It's one of the best horror stories I've seen on television. Probably the best. Everything was just delicious. And the rest of the seasons have fallen flat for me after that. I like them fine enough, but Murder house was magic."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,Tehddy,5,Fri Apr 17 08:27:22 2015 UTC,"For me, it's Coven. For me, FS had really rich subject matter that the let fall flat in order to celebrate Jessica Lange, who was leaving after the season was over. They sacrificed a lot of cool moments and opportunities to make it the Elsa show, which - for me - made the majority of other characters feel hollow and undefined. I loved the variety of the characters in Coven, and how well defined they were, even when they were small parts they felt like they had unique voices and it was really clear what everyone's purpose was, for me - aside from a few iffy places, but every season of AHS has them so, meh. Out of the two of them, I'd pick Coven, it was just more exciting and entertaining for me :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,grumblebuzz,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, also! Elsa and Fiona were both terrible people who did terrible things. Both got opportunities that made them ""human"" but didn't make them less terrible... But in the end, Elsa kind of got rewarded for her awfulness, whereas Fiona's stuck in hell forever, which just feels better to me. When Elsa was going to ""That Big Freakshow in the Sky"" I was hoping she'd be forced into a negative position to work off her murder and betrayal, someone who'd never get to be on stage, would always be second banana, but instead she was rewarded, and forgiven by her victims for no reason and it felt like ""We need to give Jessica an awesome send off!"" instead of ""This is how these people would react to Elsa's actions""."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,Tehddy,7,Fri Apr 10 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"Fiona never did anything to redeem herself though except revive a random baby.  She was completely rotten to the core; Elsa did have good qualities, she was just selfish and delusional."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,mommy2libras,-3,Fri Apr 10 19:53:28 2015 UTC,"I never said she was redeemed... I said they humanized both of them. -___- Completely completely completely different things.  Elsa murdered her best friend, attempted to murder another close friend, arranged a gang-rape (and then blackmailed and gaslit the woman afterwards), and was happily complicit in the murder of many others in her care whom she convinced she was protecting. She was an awful human being whose only ""goodness"" was what she perceived in herself. Every one of her actions was purely selfish -- and in the end she got to go to the Big Freak Show in the Sky and happily perform with people she betrayed and in some cases murdered (also abandoned in the hands of Dandy who, if she listened to the people around her, she'd have known was dangerous... She's the reason Dandy got that ""in"" that let him so easily murder EVERYONE).  I have never once said Fiona was good or redeemed or anything. Both characters are ridiculously awful human beings who are humanized by the storytelling - that is what makes them interesting. They are evil people. Here's the difference, Fiona wasn't flip-flopped back and forth and the narrative NEVER tried to sell us that she was a good person, and she got her just desserts. The narrative of Freak Show tried to sell us that Elsa was a good person (and apparently some people bought it) despite every malicious, evil, awful action she took, and that spin-doctoring of her actions was enough that they gave her a happy ending. She gets to perform to a full house every night, and got forgiveness from the people she destroyed.   That's why I prefer Fiona in Coven over Elsa in Freak Show. The writing surrounding Fiona makes sense, and supports her actions. The writing around Elsa is flip-floppy and centered around celebrating Jessica Lange as opposed to writing a consistent and effective character.  For me."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,bwood16,4,Fri Apr 10 22:01:03 2015 UTC,Basically everything you just mentioned can be summed up by saying what I said in my comment except that you choose not to see Elsa's good qualities and have a personal preference for the Fiona character.
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,Casualdancemonkey,2,Fri Apr 10 23:36:00 2015 UTC,"I don't like either of them, they're both terrible people? I just like when writers cop up to what their characters are doing, and don't let them do things without lasting consequences, it's boring to me. Elsa stabbing Paul and then pretending to call a doctor while he was dying and nothing ever coming of it? He just heals up and it's never mentioned again? That's boring, it's not good writing."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,tits_hemingway,2,Sat Apr 11 00:35:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't get that they tried to convince everyone that Elsa was a good person, just a human being. Granted, her good and bad qualities were both amplified but that's expected to make it more dramatic. And in FS, many of the characters had done some horrible things, or did them during the progression of the show."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,AHSfan23,2,Sat Apr 11 05:13:32 2015 UTC,"And what about the bull's-eye episode on freak show?  Remember Jimmy and Ethel (along wih others) started to suspect that Elsa was up to no good?  And everyone started to notice that elsa was growing  jealous of anybody who was becoming bigger than her and her own show?  The reason I'm bringing this up is because..,elsa and Paul were friends with benefits..and she had Paul sneak into her room for the second time of the season..and he was having some ""male issues"" (getting it up) and Elsa asked him what was wrong and he said the truth is he's in love with somebody else and she called him out for smelling like Venetian romance!!  And he told her it was none of her business to which she replied it is her business and then she went on a temper tantrum and a wild tangent and Paul finally called her out about the twins and her jealousy and how he think she would be willing to do anything that she had to in order to become successful in her dreams!  So she flipped out and told Paul to wake everybody up and they went into the room that had the wheel on it and told somebody that if they all want to prove their trust to her somebody must get on the wheel...so Jimmy volunteers and then Paul steps up and says no it should be me..and when he gets on the wheel ...obviously we know what happened when she threw the third knife at him.  I have watched this scene three times now and still can't figure out if I'm overthinking it or what but ..,was that truly an accident or did she really mean to stick him with the knife and then acted like it was an accident?   Remember everyone told her to call the doctor and the  ambulance and then they never showed up?!  and Eve pulled the knife out of his stomach and he began to lose a great amount of blood..then she finally took Paul back to her tent and was smoking opium with him and he asked her if she even called the doctor and she said why yes of course I called the doctor but if you died I wouldn't care one bit because you betrayed me.  So my question is was she being deceitful and did she really mean to stick him with a knife and have bad intentions or was it really an accident and she was just being hateful adding insult to injury?!"

AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,kenbrellfan,2,Fri Apr 17 08:30:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like they were a tie.  They kind of had opposite problems. Coven had such boring scenery and the problems seemed super petty and stupid, but it was interesting in the moment and usually funny and witty. Whereas Freak Show had great atmosphere and settings and the problems all seemed big, but the plots dragged on for ages and the dialogue wasn't as good.   If I had to pick, Dandy would be the tie breaker in Freak Show's favour."
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,Gogohax,2,Sat Apr 11 18:42:11 2015 UTC,I prefer Freak Show. Because of Dandy. And Edward Mordrake. But especially Dandy. <3
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,davis98,2,Sat Apr 11 22:07:52 2015 UTC,I prefer Coven because at least Coven was trying to be funny. Freak Show didnt accomplish what I think it tried to  Nothing touches Asylum for me though. It ended so beautifully.
AmericanHorrorStory,325be2,mewmaid,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:10:10 2015 UTC,"I prefer Coven. For me Freak Show lacked any real direction. Coven wasn't as good as the first two seasons but unlike at the end of Freak Show I was mostly satisfied. At the end of Freak Show I just kept thinking of all the storylines that where sort of picked up and dropped or just didn't go anywhere. I haven't watched Freak Show a second time. I usually wait till it comes on Netflix or free with Prime, it gives me some distance from my original feeling. I feel like the show lends it's self to a charitable opinion on the re-watch. I was adamant that Asylum  was a bunch of nonsense when it ended on the broadcast run. When I watched it again I did a 180. Murder House is my undisputed favorite season on all accounts but I recognize that I will likely change some of my harsher ideas about Freak Show when I watch it for a second time."

When Stevie was on S3 it made all of us music fans respect the shit out of the producers for honoring Nicks like they did but for keeping it in the story in a way that fit Stevie good. She was accused of witchcraft her whole career, ever since she discovered the god damn Rhiannon story and turned it into inspiration. And the idea of the dad, or even the mom, going fucking insane and killing the children is something I wanted out of Murder House, from the first time daddy deadest took a snooze cruise to the fireplace and showed the world his man buns. No homo, although there has been at least one gay character in every season. I'd love to see King as a writer, maybe he could consult with the cast on the spoops they're facing. But the producers of my beloved AHS need to grasp that the reason The Shining worked and, say, Maximum Overdrive didn't is that Kubrick took a big step from the source material, did what he knew how to do and let himself fucking strut. As long as they keep their traditional AHS spirit alive, they could do fucking Teddy Rex and make it scary and cool."

AmericanHorrorStory,31zziw,danielsk1,17,Thu Apr 9 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"I hate the idea of blunt connections to previous seasons. I prefer each season stand alone and if any connection is made I would prefer it be one that is small and inconsequential to the story of the season.   AHS's appeal is that it entirely reinvents it's self every year. It success in upping it's viewer rate every year is because any one can start watching any season, without watching previous seasons and not be lost. If seasons start referencing older seasons in  a way that is pertinent to the central plot it will. at least for me, ruin the uniqueness of the series.   It will also mean that new viewers would then have to watch previous seasons to understand context and meaning of lines and references that point at previous seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,31zziw,Zinthaniel,6,Thu Apr 9 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I like that they want to connect the seasons, but I think small Easter eggs or character cameos are more effective than straight up connecting the plots."

AmericanHorrorStory,31wqm3,ink1026,2,Thu Apr 9 02:32:46 2015 UTC,Frances signed on for a hulu show so I don't think were gonna see her this season unfortunately :(

I would love if she's a bit like her Misery character. Seemingly all nice and friendly and easy going. But then we start to see there is something a bit off about her. She has a passive-aggressive approach with people staying at the hotel a bit like Basil Fawlty with a dangerous edge."
AmericanHorrorStory,31wqm3,girlsjiggle,4,Thu Apr 9 12:42:53 2015 UTC,I was kinda hoping she'd be more of a background character this season to let some new talent shine but she's been good in every other role so I really can't complain.

AmericanHorrorStory,31xnd0,lumosmaximus72,2,Wed Apr 8 23:41:28 2015 UTC,"Nope! Ryan Murphy confirmed on twitter that she's going to be in Hotel and that she's playing the ""baddest bad girl"""
AmericanHorrorStory,31xnd0,monkeysrule123,2,Tue Apr 14 00:10:27 2015 UTC,This cant be true. It says she announced it To the audience even though we watched the whole thing. She never said that. She just drank alot
AmericanHorrorStory,31xnd0,HmmmNol,17,Fri Apr 10 15:18:47 2015 UTC,This isnt confirmed.  She's capable of filming 2 shows at once.
AmericanHorrorStory,31xnd0,davis98,8,Thu Apr 9 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, cool. So you know her exact schedule and limitations? Or maybe you had a personal conversation and she told you?"
AmericanHorrorStory,31xnd0,falcon4287,5,Thu Apr 9 07:30:35 2015 UTC,"So you're saying she won't be on American horror story because she has other projects going on? Let's see..during the filming of freaKshow, Evan Peters was also filming the Lazarus effect, elvis and Nixon, and safelight.  So 3 movies and a TV show.  Ryan Murphey said last year that sarah loves her season 5 character so that alone show it's possible.  Not to mention Ryan will be working on American crime story, American horror story, and scream queens..so if he can be involved in three projects I imagine she could be involved in two or three herself.  Also here is a quote from Lily rabe about her involvement with AHS FREAKSHOW... ""LILY RABE: Basically I got a message that they had written Mary Eunice back into this season and we were gonna do everything to work it out, and they did. We were able to shoot on a Saturday. It’s such an incredible thing. I’ve had that experience time and time again with Ryan [Murphy] and with the show, where with most things it would be impossible to work something out, and they find a way. He really moves mountains."". So you're speaking your opinion as if it is a fact but in the world of TVs and movie and editing anything is possible so I would say that most everyone disagrees with you judging by your down votes and no evidence to back what you are saying!  Kathy bates will be a series regular and she has FIVE projects coming out over the next 15 months...the great gilly Hopkins, michelle Darnell, the death and life of john F. Donovan, untitled Joshua marstln project AND Moose."
AmericanHorrorStory,31xnd0,goldfishinparadise,5,Thu Apr 9 14:52:06 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Working 2 shows at a time is tough, but it's certainly been done before. When those two shows share writers and producers, balancing them becomes necessary regardless of having a shared cast member.    How many shows does Gordon Ramsay run at one time? While also promoting and running multiple restaurants and publishing cook books?"
AmericanHorrorStory,31xnd0,thegreenmachine90,2,Thu Apr 9 20:06:02 2015 UTC,I really hope you are joking.

AmericanHorrorStory,31wyay,The_Adamator,2,Wed Apr 8 20:25:30 2015 UTC,Four veterans and two newcomers. I like it.
AmericanHorrorStory,31wyay,davis98,3,Wed Apr 8 22:29:50 2015 UTC,"Barely veterans, which is what I'm worried about. One of my favorite things about the show has been the recycled actors for each season. It made each season seem familiar, while the new story made it fresh."
AmericanHorrorStory,31wyay,LoganK36,3,Wed Apr 8 22:48:59 2015 UTC,"I'm actually more excited about this. I mean Season 1 -> 2, Jessica and Evan kept similarly sized roles, but the other returning actors got placed into different parts - Dylan who was a lead becomes a recurring character, Sarah who was recurring became a lead. I think that's what made that transition really strong, so I'm actually super excited about the prospect of taking some actors who previously had smaller/recurring roles - Bomer and Sevigny and Bentley - and shooting them up into the larger roles, with presumably Kathy (having been a lead in 3, and basically recurring in 4) probably having either a lead or a major recurring role. It's still recycled actors, just not the exact same people we've seen in those roles 4 seasons in a row. Honestly this transition is a lot closer to 1->2, than 2->3, and definitely 3->4 which was the most 'everyone's coming back' season."
AmericanHorrorStory,31wyay,Tehddy,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:44:33 2015 UTC,Most likely evan peters. I've read that he was confirmed but nobody really knows yet. Pretty likely though
AmericanHorrorStory,31wyay,monkeysrule123,9,Wed Apr 8 21:01:39 2015 UTC,"Evan did an interview for some magazine and according to the interviewer he was coming back (Evan himself never said that in the interview, the interviewer just assumed that apparently), then later at Paleyfest Evan said he didn't know if he was coming back. So I count that as unconfirmed so far."
AmericanHorrorStory,31wyay,ahsfreakshow,0,Wed Apr 8 21:31:30 2015 UTC,If he doesnt know then he probably is coming back. They wouldnt just throw him away. Also they lost at least two regulars(lily and jessica) and part of the shows appeal is that its all the same people. So i think its a pretty good chance he will return
AmericanHorrorStory,31wyay,monkeysrule123,3,Wed Apr 8 21:42:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I get that logic. He legitimately doesn't know if he's coming back because he hasn't been approached yet about the new season, so that makes you think he's coming back? They've already said that they're doing a cast reinvention, and so far none of the five actors who have been in every season (Jess, Evan, Sarah, Lily, and Frances) are coming back."
AmericanHorrorStory,31wyay,ahsfreakshow,-2,Wed Apr 8 23:36:05 2015 UTC,"When he says he doesnt know he will come back i think of it as, he was asked but is just waiting to see if any bigger projects come out for him. Or it may be he legit doesnt know ryan murphy wants him back"
AmericanHorrorStory,31wyay,monkeysrule123,3,Thu Apr 9 00:58:52 2015 UTC,"Evan, Denis, Finn..they all said they would like to come back but simply do not know or have not been approached.  I don't think it's a matter of them waiting to see if any bigger projects come their way or not...fin said he was approached by Ryan about doing a play in the future and he said he would love to perform on stage again he also said feels like he is part of the AHS family now and he is open doing something completely diametrically different than before.  I think it's a matter of Ryan still writing the basic plot along with developing characters and deciding who will play them...I don't think he ever sits down and picks what actors will be on the show and then writes a character for them I think it's just the opposite.. I think he comes up with the characters first and then offers them to whatever actor or actress he thinks would be good to play that role!  And just because they don't come back this season doesn't mean they won't be back for future seasons I think they are experimenting and like we have been told there radically reinventing themselves!!  With a new tone, new setting, new cast etc."
AmericanHorrorStory,31wyay,ahsfreakshow,3,Thu Apr 9 20:28:01 2015 UTC,"Ryan never said he wanted him back, why do you assume that's true? You can't just say Evan's going to be in it because he's been in every other season. Once again, they're doing something different this year, and so far it looks like those main five actors won't be in it."
AmericanHorrorStory,31xbly,AntiSemiticLefty,2,Wed Apr 8 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"After watching season 1, I started season 2 and felt bored, cause I was used to ghosts and that kind of stuff but the second one is a really horror story, although you have to watch more episodes in order to understand it better"
AmericanHorrorStory,31xbly,CarpeRetractum,2,Thu Apr 9 16:01:19 2015 UTC,Keep watching it. It gets better and the ending is captivating. That's all I'll say :)
AmericanHorrorStory,31xbly,sc13998,2,Thu Apr 9 16:05:26 2015 UTC,"thanks, I started liking the second one a little more I think I'll power through"
AmericanHorrorStory,31xbly,davis98,2,Thu Apr 9 17:00:13 2015 UTC,I personally think if you don't like a season it's not worth finishing - just move on to another season and come back to it if you are desperate for more to watch. Season 2 really didn't do much for me but I think fans are divided about if it's good or not
AmericanHorrorStory,31xbly,Kiimblee,2,Thu Apr 9 16:59:30 2015 UTC,Yes! It's my favorite season.

AmericanHorrorStory,31xbly,GamingTatertot,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:55:29 2015 UTC,"Season 2 is all about the psychological spooks, the mind terrors. You've gotta give it time to really flex on that. It isn't a slasher, Bloody Face doesn't even have that big a role. He's more the vehicle that the story is told with, he does something in the present day that links back to the actual story."
AmericanHorrorStory,31xbly,anandamidetrip,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:06:49 2015 UTC,"Season two is worth watching IMO. It's the best in terms of quality (although Season 1 will always be my favorite). Just push through it, hopefully the bloody face premise will get better for you."

AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,matyooow,71,Tue Apr 7 07:39:45 2015 UTC,"I think I read somewhere that her death is what ultimately prevented her from being the supreme. Cordelia was always destined to become the supreme as Fiona stated that her health started to decline as she was born.   Just as Cordelia was destined to be the supreme, Zoe was destined to make a mistake which would never lead her to that position.   I couldn't imagine the coven with Zoe as their supreme. I don't think she was anywhere near ready even at the end of the season. She was still too immature to take on the responsibility. Cordelia, being the polar opposite to Fiona is what would make her the perfect leader."
AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,iamkentish,12,Tue Apr 7 10:07:29 2015 UTC,This sums it up perfectly.
AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,bakedNdelicious,11,Tue Apr 7 10:47:01 2015 UTC,Misty FTW!
AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,mittensquish,6,Tue Apr 7 18:58:08 2015 UTC,but remember queenie brought misty back to life and herself but she couldnt do it in the 7 wonders? that bugged me. but oh well i guess
AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,iamkentish,7,Tue Apr 7 22:33:28 2015 UTC,"Misty was still alive during the 7 Wonders. It was her soul/conscience which was stuck in her idea of hell. She needed to reattach her soul to prove she had full control over her body and mind. Had she been physically dead and her soul attached, she would have been able to be brought back."
AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,mittensquish,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:48:51 2015 UTC,lol sorry i wasnt clear i meant she wasnt able to bring zoe back during the 7 wonders but was able to bring misty back outside of the 7 wonders when she was in the coffin
AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,iamkentish,3,Tue Apr 7 22:50:29 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. Ignore all that then. That's something I didn't quite understand either. I think the focus on Madison was a bit forced in that scene. Any one of them could have brought Zoe back at any point, but for some reason, it just had to be Madison. Queenie, Cordelia or Myrtle could have also done it (assuming Myrtle could).  Some of the writing was a bit weak around the 7 Wonders. As fun as some of the scenes were to watch, there were some simple mistakes which the writers somehow managed to overlook. That was one of them. Whether it was intentional or not, it was a silly mistake."
AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,NonfatGranola,2,Tue Apr 7 22:59:50 2015 UTC,"A few episodes earlier, Misty says that she has a plan to bring herself back to life if something were to happen. I think that's a part of the reason why Queenie was able to ""resurrect"" her"
AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,iamkentish,2,Wed Apr 8 00:32:42 2015 UTC,"I vaguely remember that scene. It's been a while, so am rusty on the details. You're right though. Misty somehow managed to use Queenie to bring herself back. It's a shame Misty couldn't reconnect to her body during the 7 Wonders though."
AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,mrignatiusjreily,2,Wed Apr 8 01:22:14 2015 UTC,"Myrtle doesn't have the power of resurgence, and Cordelia still saw herself as weak. They asked Queenie first to bring back Zoe, already knowing Madison's answer."
AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,iamkentish,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:58:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing up the Myrtle part. I couldn't remember whether she had that power. It's been a while since I last saw Coven, so I'm a bit rusty on the specifics. The reason I mentioned Cordelia being a candidate to bring her back is because she had resurrected the plants successfully (If i remember that correctly), despite her lack of confidence and faith in herself.  I definitely need to watch through again to remind myself of the specifics. Although some of the writing is bad toward the end, I found it to be quite a complex season."

AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,iamkentish,3,Thu Apr 9 04:12:22 2015 UTC,I think I've confused the plant scene with an episode of American Dad. The two shows aren't even close to being alike! Must have watched them both at the same time. Thanks again for correcting my mistake :) I'm planning another Coven marathon soon to avoid making these mistakes again.

AmericanHorrorStory,31q4pm,mrignatiusjreily,2,Fri Apr 10 01:45:29 2015 UTC,"Cordelia was right next to her when she brought back Misty. She believed in Queenie, thus her power channelling into Queenie for that one time. It didn't work again on Zoe because Cordelia's powers were tired of finding outlets(the little witches) to express itself. This is why rewatching Coven is essential. From the beginning you have to assume all the powers the little witches gain throughout the season is not really their own truly."

AmericanHorrorStory,31j7t0,MiNiMaLHaDeZz,5,Sun Apr 5 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't watch the video, however I know Richard Ramirez was a guest at the hotel. I did a quick google search just to make sure I had my facts correct, and he did stay there. A website said that he called the hotel ""home"" so maybe he actually lived there. Not sure.  I would LOVE to see an actor playing Richard Ramirez as a guest there. That would be so fucking cool! I have a weird fascination with serial killers, particularly Manson and Dahmer. I'd really love to see them elaborate more about the Black Dahlia. I really love Mena Suvari. I feel like she's a very underrated actress."
AmericanHorrorStory,31j7t0,MaryJaneHolland88,3,Mon Apr 6 00:17:34 2015 UTC,I still find it hard to classify Manson as a serial killer tho.  He didn't actually kill anyone himself.  My favorite killer has to be Ed Gein tho.  Kind of a sad story that one.

AmericanHorrorStory,31ld1t,israeldmo,9,Mon Apr 6 04:01:53 2015 UTC,Lots of theories behind the title floating around. Mostly relating to known Hotels with haunted/crime filled history. Cult and secret societies is definitely another popular theory. We will just have to wait and see and hope it is not something too far from left field.

AmericanHorrorStory,31ld1t,freedomfists,4,Tue Apr 7 06:00:39 2015 UTC,"There's some solid hote based horror films that aren't ghost based (psycho, Rosemary's baby). I'm sure there'll be some sort of ghost/possession stuff but hopefully they get really creative in a good way."
AmericanHorrorStory,31ld1t,girlsjiggle,4,Tue Apr 7 02:12:00 2015 UTC,"The theme will be internal emotional emptiness, or vacancy if the AHS: Hotel/Vacancy titles have any correlation.  Thats my guess, it feels like something the show would be about, plenty of horror in being completely void inside."
AmericanHorrorStory,31ld1t,BasketeerOverHere,4,Wed Apr 8 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that Hotel is any different than the other seasons. They all are classic horror settings that have tropes and themes that naturally come out of them. For hotel that will undoubtedly be creepy deserted corridors, rooms that should be empty having voices, voyeurism, strange reception clerk, that weird transient, neither here nor there feeling of hotels, the idea of a welcoming, seemingly straight ""front"" but dark secrets hidden away in rooms and weird people. They may use ""Vacancy"" and ""Hostel"" type torture porn stuff but I hope not - that's so overdone and not what AHS is about - its much more mythological with emotional stories.      The story that weaves everything together is another element and is harder to guess because that's where the writers creativity comes in. The last two seasons have really pushed the theme of how outcasts are treated (as a metaphor for the LGBT community) and I could see them doing it again with Gaga as a Dionysian/Frankenfurter type running a sexually decadent hotel with strange patrons who are creatures of the night. Maybe Gaga will be demonic (the trailer indicates that a bit). People come to stay who seem quite straight, but  begin a descent into depravities and perversions. She tempts them with being able to act out their wildest, repressed desires in exchange for their souls. Hotels are renknown for affairs because people are away from their normal confines (physically and psychologically).   Madness could be a theme as well ala The Shining. The idea of hotels having so many rooms reflects the hidden terrors in our subconscious."

AmericanHorrorStory,31ld1t,falcon4287,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:27:20 2015 UTC,I dont know about any themes but I'm betting we will see: * The hotel used like a brothel * Secret passages in walls * Said secret passages lead to torture chamber type spot * Lobby boys being treated like dirt and then taking revenge * The hotel will be threaten to sell to a developer. * Hoping for 1 episoder side stories about random guest in the hotel. Similar to the scary little girl or Santa Claus in asylum.
AmericanHorrorStory,31ld1t,Clumpy,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:32:07 2015 UTC,"Normally, each season touches on more than one aspect of horror. Season 1 had ghosts, but also included serial killers and themed heavily on infidelity and family. Season 2 touched on a lot of horror aspects ranging from aliens to satanic possession, and still themed on family as well as feminism and religion. Season 3 ventured into the occult, but still included ghosts and themed around a power struggle, racism/bigotry, and a reluctant leader. Season 4 touched slightly on ghosts/occult while focusing mostly on psychopaths, and themed around bigotry and family.    Based on the wide range there, I would imagine that Hotel will involve ghosts as hotels often do, serial killers, and may involve the hotel owner holding customers captive. I'm sure that the theme will work around family somehow, as that seems to be a recurring theme in the seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,31i09a,OnPlanetVenus,22,Sun Apr 5 06:49:57 2015 UTC,Maybe the dentist died outside of the house or maybe he just moved away. And for example Constance or Larry Harvey got out of the house alive.

They're both still so tied to the house that it's almost like they died there, too. Maybe I should revise it to, ""Did anyone get out of there unscathed?"" Sure, Dr. Curan murdered someone, but he didn't lose his entire family in that house like Constance and Larry Harvey"
AmericanHorrorStory,31i09a,signu1230,8,Sun Apr 5 07:46:59 2015 UTC,"No, there are others who have survived the house.  When the R. Franklin murders were being committed, the house served as a sort of dormitory to nursing students.  Before R. Franklin arrives, Gladys and Maria speak with a few of the other girls who are leaving for a concert.  We never see those girls again, so they survived.  And even though she doesn't technically ""survive,"" Bianca (one of the murder re-enactors from ""Home Invasion"") is never seen as a ghost, despite her friends Dallas and Fiona being present to hang Ben in the finale.  After being struck with the axe by Tate, Bianca must have stumbled out of the house because the police report to the Harmon family that Bianca's body is found six blocks away.  They are mistakenly under the impression that Fiona and Dallas must have attempted to kill Bianca in a manner similar to the Black Dhalia death since their R. Franklin reenactment failed."

AmericanHorrorStory,31i09a,LSunday,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:30:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone lived there in that period.  Remember in the first episode, it was an abandoned house when the ginger twins went in and smashed everything up?  The realtor then says the 'gays' fixed it all up.  I take that to mean there was no one living there to become ghosts during that time."
AmericanHorrorStory,31i09a,dymphnawolf,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"The ginger twins smashed it up in 1978, when Addy was a kid. And the realtor sounded like she had sold it to people other than the gay couple, though that may just be how I heard it. Though it is possible that it was empty for all that time and then the gay couple fixed it up again, since we don't know how long Constance stayed there after the events in 94."
AmericanHorrorStory,31i09a,LSunday,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"I just remember she does explicitly say that they were the ones that fixed it up... though it's possible some people moved in, it fell into disrepair, and was repaired again."
AmericanHorrorStory,31i09a,dymphnawolf,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:47:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because the Langdons and Larry were living there in 94 and probably moved out by 95. And it's a house with a bad history at this point, so it is likely that no one bothered to move in.  It seems there's a pattern with the Murder House: new owners, repairs, an exit (one way or another) and then disrepair. After the nurse and student were murdered, the school probably got the rest of the residents out and it fell into disrepair because no one else wanted to live there after the murders  According to the supplementary material (a website called You're Going to Die in There, which I read up on in the AHS wiki), someone lived in there during the early 2000s, though how canon it is may be dubious. Even so, a few years might be all it takes because in tv land, vandals like to mess with haunted houses and the ghosts could break stuff for the lulz."

Speck, a seaman from Texas, broke into a Chicago dorm filled with nurses and viciously tortured, raped, and killed eight of them in one night!; Kit & Alma Walker..they were inspired by a couple named Barney and Betty Hill, some of the first people to ever claim to have been abducted by aliens in 1961. Their experience was widely publicized and became a bestselling book called The Interrupted Journey and a 1975 TV movie The UFO Incident. Just like Kit and Alma, Barney and Betty were a mixed-race couple, an integral part of the story line on Asylum; A handful of main characters from Coven were based on real people, but none as chilling as Madame Delphine LaLaurie.

AmericanHorrorStory,317xuq,Imnother,2,Thu Apr 2 21:45:05 2015 UTC,I don't know that Funko sells stuff directly. I do know that it usually takes months between concept art being released and the actual figures coming out (sometimes ages--the last Game of Thrones series kept getting delayed) so these are probably a ways away yet.

AmericanHorrorStory,3174tf,bwood16,11,Thu Apr 2 16:31:08 2015 UTC,Who's to say its Adelaide. Just because she's wearing a headband. It could just be a younger Nan? Her characters really don't look very different in Murderhouse and Coven.

AmericanHorrorStory,317mc2,anandamidetrip,5,Thu Apr 2 17:09:31 2015 UTC,"Right, Fiona blames it on Marie, which makes the council think that the truce was broken by Marie, which erases all the good-will the truce brought."
AmericanHorrorStory,317mc2,janus_geminus,1 point,Thu Apr 2 20:21:07 2015 UTC,But the truce lasted until Fiona broke it again decades later. The council from the 1970's asked young Fiona (I believe) what happened and she said it might be Marie (after the truce was established).
AmericanHorrorStory,317mc2,janus_geminus,3,Thu Apr 2 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"I interpreted it this way:  Fiona killed the old supreme and blamed Marie, which broke the truce, so the coven and the voodoo witches stayed in their truce-established areas but didn't interact, didn't mingle and didn't venture into the other's areas."
AmericanHorrorStory,317mc2,janus_geminus,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:36:41 2015 UTC,"""I mean, after all, your kind and my kind have been going after each other for centuries"" This is an excerpt I got from the 2nd episode between Marie and Fiona. From what i understand the truce is what stopped the battles from continuing. Otherwise why is a truce necessary if it's not defining boundaries or keeping fights under control? And why wouldn't the coven strike back if they assume Marie killed their supreme?  While it doesn't make sense to me, I can see some people believing that Fiona unburying Delphine was enough to provoke Marie into suddenly caring. Thank you for offering your interpretation."
AmericanHorrorStory,317mc2,janus_geminus,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:28:06 2015 UTC,Those are good questions
AmericanHorrorStory,317mc2,bwood16,1 point,Fri Apr 3 03:30:44 2015 UTC,"I did a little more research, and I came up with this. It's from episode 4  ""She's still alive. She has to be. We all grieve Anna Leigh, Fiona. But, together, none of the witches or warlocks of the Council can detect her life force. We must assume the worst. You say she was heading somewhere when she spoke to you. Did she give you any indication as to where? But she took a fine bottle of wine with her. She said it was a final peace offering. Anna Leigh recently negotiated a truce with Marie Laveau, the voodoo queen. You don't suspect the colored witches are involved in this? I couldn't say. Gather yourself, girl. You need to reach deep and exercise your strength now. We have something to tell you. In loving memory of our lost Supreme, Anna Leigh Leighton, we announce her posthumous selection of the witch she believed to be her trueborn successor, Supreme Elect, Fiona Goode.""  So maybe finding the new supreme distracted them from Marie, and Fiona stopped the council somehow from furthering their investigation/fight after she was crowned supreme? This is all just a guess, but maybe the show planned to answer why the fight never continued but they never made time for it? Whatever the answer is, its just TV and I'm probably looking into this way too much."
AmericanHorrorStory,317mc2,bwood16,2,Fri Apr 3 03:47:52 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. And I'm sure by then they knew Marie was immortal, perhaps they didn't want to mess with someone who clearly had more magical knowledge and power."

The constant resurrection of characters was another big problem. Death is scary because it is permanent and final, and being able to undo death takes the horror right out of the show. But I could have easily dealt with all of that if it wasn't for the god awful and completely unnecessary addition of Stevie Nicks."
AmericanHorrorStory,314zgp,mrignatiusjreily,0,Sat Apr 4 12:42:10 2015 UTC,The Ramseys added character development to Nan and to showcase Misty's gift to Fiona. If you think the  resurrection theme had no purpose then you  don't get what Coven is really about.

Her first appearance was essentially a trick from Fiona to inspire Misty to bring out her full power. The only person Misty ever trusted in completely  was Stevie. Stevie, obviously unaware of Fiona's ulterior motive, thought she was helping a young witch find her confidence and strength to become a supreme. Her second appearance in the finale was her showing up to wish the girls good luck. She believed her friend Fiona was murdered, so she was trying to cheer the house up with a song.

AmericanHorrorStory,30zc80,LustySailors,11,Tue Mar 31 23:52:32 2015 UTC,"You should watch True Blood. He plays the Vampire King of Mississippi, and the Season 3 Antagonist. He was pretty much my favorite character in that series. The level of his ruthlessness knows no bounds."
AmericanHorrorStory,30zc80,Lecter07,9,Wed Apr 1 13:43:23 2015 UTC,"It's Larry Harvey. Not trying to be rude, just correcting ;)  But I totally agree. I feel like he is the most overlooked character on American Horror Story. I LOVED him as Russell Edgington on True Blood but he pretty much kicks ass in anything he does. I'm so excited to see him in The Comedians. I don't see him in too many comedy roles, despite the fact that he's very funny so I'm super stoked!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30zc80,MaryJaneHolland88,3,Wed Apr 1 02:54:35 2015 UTC,No it's totally fine! I knew it was either Larry or Harry....
AmericanHorrorStory,30zc80,enterthecircus,3,Wed Apr 1 03:05:12 2015 UTC,"He is such an incredible actor and if you ever get the chance you should see him on stage.  Also, I know this might sound strange but for some reason I find him very sexy."
AmericanHorrorStory,30zc80,israeldmo,2,Wed Apr 1 11:05:46 2015 UTC,"Besides True Blood and AHS, I've seen him in a quite few minor roles in movies (some doctors) but strangely I've never seen him in a leading role. He's great, deserves more recognition."

AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,CylonCounselor,11,Tue Mar 31 15:25:17 2015 UTC,"In season 1, the Montgomery's baby was referred to as Thaddeus within the show even when he dies and is brought back to life yet he is referred to as Infantata outside the show."

AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,TTHtv,5,Thu Apr 2 18:45:43 2015 UTC,How did I never realize that Meep and Thaddeus were played by the same person?
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,Lester_Knopf,19,Thu Apr 2 21:18:51 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think anyone did. That's why all those rumors were going about Dandy taking his mask and becoming the really scary clown named Twisty Ryan Murphy told us about."
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,ahsfreakshow,13,Fri Apr 3 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"Even Dandy just called him ""the clown"". Twisty is just the name Ryan gave him and it stuck."
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,AlfieBoheme,14,Tue Mar 31 16:42:10 2015 UTC,"I believe Dandy called him Mr. Clown, which honestly is a hell of a lot creepier than 'Twisty'."
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,k0ala_tea,5,Tue Mar 31 17:49:13 2015 UTC,For the first half of the season I just smiled and nodded whenever my friends mentioned a character named Twisty because they never actually said it on the show and I had to pretend I had an actual clue as to who the fuck any of them were talking about
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,risefromruins,4,Tue Mar 31 20:17:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that his character's written name on the scripts and whatnot was ""Twisted Clown"", and then Twisty was just a nickname from that.   No source and I don't even remember where I read it, but that's the explanation I'm going with."
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,IamLegba,2,Wed Apr 1 04:13:49 2015 UTC,"Kind of similar to your question, but I was wondering this about season 1. Did anyone ever really refer to the rubber man with that name in the show or was that just what people called him?"
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,mrrobopuppy,17,Tue Mar 31 21:48:52 2015 UTC,Maybe not but that's less of a leap since...he's a rubber man. Twisty isn't one of those little ties in the produce section at your local supermarket.
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,minze,5,Tue Mar 31 18:19:26 2015 UTC,or a nickname for someone who makes balloon animals by twisting them into shapes.
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,thegreenmachine90,9,Tue Mar 31 18:42:07 2015 UTC,"When Viven spoke to ben about being raped she said ""I was raped by a man in a rubber suit,"" and a couple other times to the Security Guard/cop and also while she was in the looney bin she referred to him as ""the rapist in the rubber suit"""
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,GamingTatertot,-5,Tue Mar 31 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"I always failed to understand why Vivian said she was raped by him. In the scene, she is clearly consenting (only because she thinks it is her husband). Anyone who has been in a long term relationship (and especially a long term marriage) would know the feel of their partner's body (rubber suit or not).  It's like all of a sudden when she finds out that Ben isn't the father, she's all like ""But I was raped!"" I might make this a thread just to get other people's opinions"
AmericanHorrorStory,30xl74,kaulbars,-6,Tue Mar 31 19:06:18 2015 UTC,It also makes me wonder did anyone refer to Bloody Face as Bloody Face in Season 2...and was calling the Supreme the Supreme only an audience thing?  Clearly joking just saying
AmericanHorrorStory,30yy4x,Shannenlois,2,Tue Mar 31 20:53:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but I hate the Dante's inferno theory- It just doesn't make sense. I think when they said the seasons were connected they meant like small subtle character/location connections."
AmericanHorrorStory,30yy4x,bwood16,3,Sat Apr 4 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"There's another theory that each of the actors represent a soul trapped in hell. That's why many of their characters share the same flaws; they are being punished for their sins. It's a bit iffy but you can see similar sin in a few characters. Jessica Lange could represent many, but I guess the most prominent being either Envy or Greed. Each of her characters are desperate for something out of their reach (Stardom, Success and Beauty usually). After Lange the theory gets a bit stretchy but you can read into it and see more.  Evan Peters may represent lust. While not as prominent as Young Moira or Shelley, each of his characters become involved in some form of love triangle and adultery. Similarly, his relationships tend to be the undoing of him in some way: his relationship with the Harmons lead to his secret being revealed, Alma's abduction leads to his incarceration and then her and Grace kind of wreck his life indirectly later, Madison killed him and then her and Zoe put him back together making him a tormented zombie and finally in Freak Show, Maggie helps Stanley which leads to Jimmy's depression and alcoholism. Obviously a lot of this lust could be argued as minor which might be why he lives in many seasons; his punishment is not as extreme.  Pushing for more you could link Sarah Paulson with Pride, Kathy Bates with Gluttony (alcohol and torture), etc.  Honestly I find the whole thing a bit stretchy but some people buy into it. I'd rather just continue to see the show as a collection of stories with little to no real link but whatever"
AmericanHorrorStory,30yy4x,AlfieBoheme,1 point,Tue Mar 31 23:07:11 2015 UTC,"Probably watching a little bit too closely..while there are parallels between the seasons, with Easter eggs here and there and a couple of revealed connections so far..I think a lot of us have become bored between the seasons are are digging too deep for a lot of stuff that's probably not there.  I've also read the Dantes Inferno theory but I don't know if that's the angle they are really coming from and I doubt it!  But ya never know until everything is revealed i guess!  As far as more theories..you can find plenty of them on here or by simply googling ""American horror story theories.""  EDIT: To poor spelling"
AmericanHorrorStory,30yy4x,baileath,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:06:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you for responding, yeah I thought I was probably watching a little too closely. I've read every theory Google has to offer and I think they're all either a little complex or from people who haven't been taking notice of the series, new to reddit so was just seeing if anyone had anything to offer that I hadn't read on Google :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,30yy4x,HmmmNol,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:10:50 2015 UTC,That Dante's theory is interesting.  Haven't really heard much about it.  Have people come up with good guesses for which season is which circle of hell?

AmericanHorrorStory,312dz1,Dead_Like_Me,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:55:53 2015 UTC,True and I wonder what would have happened if they had not made it on to the property before halloween ended? Would the spirits expire?
AmericanHorrorStory,312dz1,ahsfreakshow,3,Wed Apr 1 16:54:03 2015 UTC,They sorta showed that with Hayden. She was in Luke's cop car but the minute the sun rose she disappeared and her spirit automatically returned to the house. So they can make a conscious effort to get back or they can just be forced back I guess.
AmericanHorrorStory,312dz1,Dead_Like_Me,2,Wed Apr 1 17:14:07 2015 UTC,Perhaps they simply would have been forced back to the house? Much like Violet couldn't leave it just kept transporting her to another door to go through.
AmericanHorrorStory,312dz1,bwood16,1 point,Wed Apr 1 18:46:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't even put together the whole Hayden thing..I always assumed she just got out of the cop car to flee!!  Good points though!!
AmericanHorrorStory,312dz1,seanrjones,2,Wed Apr 1 19:35:30 2015 UTC,"Direct quote from the show- ""The dead can walk freely on Halloween"""
AmericanHorrorStory,312a2t,thegreenmachine90,29,Wed Apr 1 14:56:40 2015 UTC,"She consented to having sex with her husband, not to Tate.   IIRC she hadn't slept with Ben in a while, plus why would it cross her mind to think about whether it was her husband or not. Either way, it doesn't matter as she didn't obviously consent to Tate. It's why 'yes means yes' is a more powerful campaign than 'no means no'."
AmericanHorrorStory,312a2t,Tyler_Owens,19,Wed Apr 1 15:50:02 2015 UTC,"This. She did not consent to sex with Tate, she consented to sex with her husband. If you're pretending to be someone else to take advantage of someone, it's absolutely 1000000% still rape."
AmericanHorrorStory,312a2t,Tehddy,6,Wed Apr 1 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"She assumed her husband was wearing the rubber suit, she didn't know it was Tate"

AmericanHorrorStory,312a2t,bwood16,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:35:10 2015 UTC,cuz he was only wearing a rubber suit. she couldn't see his face lol
AmericanHorrorStory,312a2t,ahsfreakshow,7,Thu Apr 2 00:40:15 2015 UTC,"Actually she started claiming she was raped way before she found out that the twins had separate fathers, so to accuse her of claiming rape once she learned that isn't fair or true. If you recall Ben told her that the twins had different dads when she was in the mental hospital, after being convinced she went mad after claiming she was raped."
AmericanHorrorStory,312a2t,Zinthaniel,4,Wed Apr 1 17:18:36 2015 UTC,That isn't how consent works buddy.   You can not pretend that you are a girls husband or boyfriend or mans wife or girlfriend by somehow obscuring your body with a costume - to whom she or he will consent to have sex with - and then claim you didn't rape her  or him when she/he founds out that you were not the person they consented to sex with.   Rape is any form of nonconsenual sex. If woman or man does not consent to having sex with YOU specifically then you are raping them.
AmericanHorrorStory,312a2t,EasternZone,-5,Wed Apr 1 19:11:20 2015 UTC,I'm aware of that fact. I'm merely expressing disbelief that she didn't know it wasn't Ben after years and years of marriage.

AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,AlfieBoheme,30,Mon Mar 30 19:57:51 2015 UTC,Well her fight with Madison when they did the seven wonders seemed like the original Misty to me.
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,thegreenmachine90,12,Mon Mar 30 20:34:50 2015 UTC,Agreed!
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,AcceptThisUsername,31,Mon Mar 30 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"I was very disappointed in what happened to her. I'm guessing that she was otherwise the shoe-in, so they had to give her the abrupt storyline. Murphy loves doing the shock-out-of-left-field crap with his beloved / redeemed characters. The season that didn't really do that was Season 2, which I think is part of the reason why people are so satisfied with it.  Also, I really liked the Misty Day character, and the singing, and the obsession with Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks, screw the haters."
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,peterkeats,9,Mon Mar 30 21:48:07 2015 UTC,"It really pissed me off that they never really welcomed Misty into the coven, and held her at arm's length up until the end. Especially after  1- headmistress seeing the story of her death and saying that she wished Misty could have been safe with them  2- Mistys whole schpeal about how Stevie got her voice after finding her tribe"
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,peanutbhudda,3,Tue Mar 31 00:14:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I understood why Zoe didn't bring her back when she was healing Kyle, but even after Kyle is discovered living in the school, she still doesn't go get Misty"
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,dejour,10,Tue Mar 31 19:18:49 2015 UTC,"I mostly agree with you.  I suppose it's possible that in her world Misty is extremely strong.  But maybe she's quite delicate mentally and if you put her in the school/coven, she becomes a lot more fragile.  There are some people like that in real life."
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,OjamaKnight,3,Mon Mar 30 23:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, she barely knew these people who were dragging her into a complex Supreme war, and could feel that the house was bad. (Presumably because of the Axe Man.) I don't blame her for feeling out of her element despite her trying to be decent and kind. Well, up until Madison screwed her over."
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,Davidoff1983,10,Tue Mar 31 04:16:33 2015 UTC,Seemed like a really bizarre ending for such a strong character. It was nearly hateful to leave such a positive character in hell for what seems like no reason or benefit to the storyline. The amount of times I've rewrote that part of the story in my head is scary.
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,Supreme000,4,Mon Mar 30 23:23:09 2015 UTC,"I thought her death had huge meaning and reason. Each had to visit the worst moment in their lives. Misty's was that day in school with the frog. Each candidate overcame their horrible day, except for Misty. She could not get past the pain of it. The moral of that storyline to me is if you can't get over past pains, that essentially IS hell. That's just the way I took it.  I do like what you pen as well, though."
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,Davidoff1983,2,Tue Mar 31 19:45:11 2015 UTC,"This was roughly my interpretation also. Sometimes in AHS I get the feeling different people are writing different parts of a characters storyline (might they switch around per episode ?) so while all the ideas are splendid within themselves sometimes they clash with the overall arc of some characters. On a totally unrelated matter, am I the only one who felt the Twisty the clown arc should have been the finale rather than Dandy's tantrum ?"
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,Supreme000,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:56:04 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. I have at times noticed characters acting in a way that is uncharacteristic of the character. You are probably right. Different writers input.  I also have to agree with the Twisty arc. The whole Twisty story was the only disappointment I had in this season. Perhaps they just didn't explain his story enough. I mean like did he go back and kill the little clowns who lied to him and ruined his life? Cut off ones scalp and that's what he was wearing on his head? There was just so many holes in his storyline left unexplained. Him kidnapping the children to save them from their parents made no sense. So the children didn't have to brush their teeth and do chores. That just didn't make sense to me. I liked him, it's just I felt the storyline could have been better."
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,GamingTatertot,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:32:31 2015 UTC,What did you rewrite it as?
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,Davidoff1983,6,Tue Mar 31 01:23:17 2015 UTC,I mostly pen her in as more of a positive influence on Sarah Paulson's character and have her becoming more of a white witch (which I feel makes sense as she idolized Stevie so much). Really too many variations to name. In general I'm not against her dying as giving her a 'genuine' death would be very symbolic. In my schmaltziest of moments I would have probably liked Cordelia to realize that the Black magic her mother used to control and abuse people all her life is actually harmful to those who practice it and have her destroy the school and set off to learn white magic with the girls. Maybe have Misty sacrifice herself for the good of the girls (Collapsing building fighting with Fiona maybe). Then before the credits roll have a long panning shot of the destroyed school months after the fact still a grey charred mess completely leveled to the ground. Right in the middle of this depressing scene a small flower is sprouting with some unusually lush greenery surrounding it. Cue Landslide by Stevie Nicks. Fade to black.
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,finding_jay,6,Tue Mar 31 01:50:47 2015 UTC,"I always saw Misty as being unable to handle people very well. She's a very lonely person (see the whole Kyle mess, especially when he's returned to his mother), but because she was literally burned by people, she doesn't get along so well with them. Part of the reason I imagine she got along so well with Cordelia is because Cordelia was equally harmed.  She's also the one most attuned with nature. She brought the alligators back to life because they had been killed- just like she had. And gators gonna gate, so when they attacked the poachers, she accepted that was the role they played on Earth."
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,Supreme000,3,Tue Mar 31 01:56:24 2015 UTC,gators gonna gate.....lmao love it!
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,saveusnck,5,Tue Mar 31 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"I kind of saw her bringing the alligators back to life as an act of flower power, save Mother Earth, live and love again gator brothers kind of act than an act of vengeance.  Nothing more than an extreme act of righting a wrong.  Meh...that's just me."
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,Supreme000,1 point,Tue Mar 31 00:28:15 2015 UTC,"True I do get that, but then why have her say ""it will be the you who'll burn"" to her murderers. It leaves a huge Chekov Gun unfired; if they were never going to follow up on that then why use that line, especially when it seems so out of character in retrospect"
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,Whimsiguy,2,Tue Mar 31 19:20:55 2015 UTC,"You make a good point. I never thought of it that way. I guess I just figured that Misty was angered to the point of batshit crazy when an animal was harmed. Maybe because she fell apart over the frog in biology class back in school. She had matured by the time of the alligator poachers, and reacted strongly this time.  I do like your idea that it would have been cool to see a more brutal Misty......but then again, the sweet Misty made that scene where she gets stuck in hell all the more sad."
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,signu1230,2,Tue Mar 31 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do understand the animal thing, my issue though is the Chekov's gun left when she tells her murderers 'you will burn'. It's just so out of character I don't understand why they would put it in unless they were gonna do something with it"
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,Supreme000,7,Tue Mar 31 20:15:13 2015 UTC,"I think that comment is saying ""youll burn in hell for harming one of god's creatures"""
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,dntbstpd1,3,Tue Mar 31 21:37:27 2015 UTC,"I think Misty probably meant something more along the lines of ""you will burn in Hell for what you're doing to me because it's wrong.""  I highly doubt Misty would actually go after them.  Considering these people burned her at the stake, it's no surprise she wouldn't want to see them again.  If she went after them, there's the chance she might be spotted or recognized.  Then everyone would start to wonder why and how the burned girl came back to life.  Misty really had no option BUT to go into hiding."
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,anandamidetrip,2,Wed Apr 1 20:06:01 2015 UTC,Very good point.
AmericanHorrorStory,30ucsk,anandamidetrip,4,Tue Mar 31 22:34:04 2015 UTC,"I had a different take on her.

AmericanHorrorStory,30tkhy,PhillyPride,10,Mon Mar 30 16:29:48 2015 UTC,..true!  It's also not too far away from Jupiter!!  I don't know if it's true or not but I have read on here that somebody thought it was a nod to freak shows location!!
AmericanHorrorStory,30tkhy,ahsfreakshow,7,Mon Mar 30 17:00:04 2015 UTC,Well the inclusion of Orlando was most likely used to hint at Freak Show's setting being in Florida.

AmericanHorrorStory,30tkhy,davis98,-27,Tue Mar 31 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"Is this a joke?  Edit: Ok, while we are noticing clever things in Coven why don't I submit some things I have noticed.    ""Myrtle"" is the name of a Harry Potter character, Harry Potter takes place in a magical world.  The Magic Bus is a song that was featured on ""Driver Ed"", an episode of the television series Veronica Mars (I'm not making this up, go ahead and google it). The producer of the above song's name is Kit. The Magic Bus is also the nickname a character in the film ""Into The Wild"" (made before Freakshow's release) gave to a run-down bus he dwelled in. Looks a bit familiar, no?  The song was released in 1968.. Asylum started during 1960. This song was 25th leading in the US when it was released, ""American Horror Story Asylum"" has 25 letters."

Nora never killed Thaddeus, she even says ""she tried to but he clung to life"". Ryan confirms that the Infantata is not a ghost here, he says he's still alive, living in the basement feeding off anything he can find, which was why he killed Troy and Bryan in the first episode. That's why the Infantata is all wrinkly and old-looking, he's literally been alive since 1926. He's not a ghost. As you said he died off the property, so even if he never was brought back to life, his ghost wouldn't be in the house."

AmericanHorrorStory,30r5gb,whokilledmurph,4,Mon Mar 30 00:22:49 2015 UTC,"A)Favorite villain from each season would be as follows:  Murderhouse: Tate Langdon.  Why?  He was a psychopath that went on a couple of murder sprees as well as raped his love interests own mother, possibly bringing about the Anti-Christ and future end times (depending IF/how that story-line plays out in the future, IF they even cover it again or connect it to one of the future seasons!)  Asylum-This is really probably the hardest season for me to choose a villain from.  Leigh Emerson killed 18 people as we know, along with people in the Asylum, however we don't know the majority of his victims, so even though he was a terrible, vile culprit, he really didn't take anyone away from us to make him the absolute worse villain from this season.  So for me it really came down to Arthur Arden and Bloodyface with my final answer being Bloodyface.  Why?  He was an evil man, serial killer/rapist, blackmailing monster,  James Cromwell as Arden had the ability to genuinely make me dislike his character for the way he treated people, his acting and dialogue, his experiments, blackmailing, threats, etc (which makes for great acting) but it was Bloodyfaces actions that really floored me.  The first time his identity was revealed, and we saw he had turned his basement into a replica of Lanas bedroom and then how he rAped her in her love interests skinned face, keeping the teeth--left me with cold chills.  He was DefinAtely a monster on a whole other level!!  Coven-For me, this is hands down, an EASY one: Madame Delphine LaLaurie.  She was sinister, cold, and heartless.  The way she tortured and treated her victims; the way she treated her own husband and daughters; her racism; crazy blood fetish; she was responsible for the death of a prego-woman..as many more terrible occurrences.  Freakshow-While Twisty and Dandy were great villains to begin with, I felt as though Twistys backstory made him a little more likable along the lines of understanding why he did the things he did, in a way, some of us couldn't help but feel sorry for him.  And Dandy, well he's just Dandy!  A sociopathic/psychopathic spoiled brat as a grown man responsible for many murders including within his own family..but again, at times I found myself rooting for him(sounds crazy, I know!).  He was a likable character to me, at least in the since That he had charisma and a certain level of charm about him.  But the best Freakshkw villain IMO would have to be Stanley.  In writing this, I have noticed that I pick my favorite villains based on each character and cast members acting ability and how much the actor makes you actually despise their character.  For me, Denis O'Hare did an awesome job as Stanley.  I absolutely hated him and could not stand him at all what so ever.  The type of guy I would like to strangle if I ever met him in person.  He was cocky, manipulative, deceiving, cowardous, blackmailing jerk that backed up a good amount of his threats wether it was in a sneaky way or not!!  B)My #1 best vlllain of the entire series goes to: Stanley.  He was so Unlikable and if his character didn't exist it would have changed the entire premise of Freakshows storyline.  He was a snake, a sneaky cowArd.  He actually made me hate and despise him for the things he did to the freaks..how manipulative he was with his bribes and blackmailing.  The scene where he pulled his big wang out in front of Dell Toledo and did a lewd sexual act made me despise him especially while he was doing so the faces he made !  Out of all of the villains, he is the one I couldn't stNd the most. And again, he may not be the worse of them, but like I said, I am judging these characters off how much they were able to make me dislike them and have a genuine resentment towards them, Denis O'Hare did an incredible job with that!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30r5gb,OhDear3,6,Mon Mar 30 00:55:13 2015 UTC,Answer for all: Papa Legba Why? His accent I think is enough reason
AmericanHorrorStory,30r5gb,ananolasco,3,Mon Mar 30 02:58:38 2015 UTC,"Murder House: This is obviously Tate, there's a cult of fangirls gloryfying him everywhere on the net and it's for a good reason. Honorable mention goes to Nora & Charles Montgomery, though they're not exactly villains. Asylum: Sister Mary Eunice takes the cake here for me, she's one of my most favourite characters of all the seasons, she was so beautifully played. Coven: Fiona Goode, the Supreme! Fiona was a goddess and every scene with her was pure gold, Coven was super fun because of the awesome characters and she was their queen. Freak Show: In the beginning, I really thought Maggie has some potential but then she was just dull. I think it's a toss up between Dandy, Stanley and Penny's shitty father, propably just Dandy cause that's the most obvious choice here. And for the all time favourite, Sister Mary Eunice! She was just so lovable and not just as a villain. The character really made Asylum for me."
AmericanHorrorStory,30r5gb,Toby631,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:03:59 2015 UTC,I will have to agree with Papa Lemba for all.
AmericanHorrorStory,30r5gb,Toby631,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:10:06 2015 UTC,"-Murder House: I'm going to go with the fan favourite of Tate on this one. Why? Because I both hated him and rooted for him at the same time. At the end of the season ""I wanted him and Violet to be together so badly, yet the school shooting scene is probably the most haunting scene of the entire series""  -Asylum: This is the hardest one for me to decide, but I am going to have to go with Dr. Oliver Thredson/Bloodyface. I may be biased because Zachary Quinto did such a phenomenal job acting. At the beginning of the series ""I was so convinced that Dr. Thredson was one of the good guys, and when he takes Lana down into the basement it's one of the biggest shocks of the season. For me he was also the most satisfying villain to see get destroyed. The scene when Lana holds up with tape and gives him the finger through the cab is so awesome.""  -Coven: Papa Legba. ""You do not fuck around with that guy.""  -Freak Show: I don't know if this really counts, but I would have to say Edward Mordrake. That green mist is so freaking creepy. I may also be biased because Edward Mordrake  ""is responsible for revealing Twisty the Clown's true story, which is just so so sad.""  Of all the seasons? Oliver Thredson.  ""I'm clearly insane""  EDIT  - I edited this for spoilers. Sorry didn't notice rules until after!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30r5gb,AlfieBoheme,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:37:55 2015 UTC,"Well since this thread didn't have a very much feedback or interest lets just do the Heros thing on here too! Mine would probably be slmething like  Murderhouse-Old Mora.  Idk why but I just think she is lol!  Asylum-Lana Winters.  Nuff said  Coven-I guess Cordelia? She always stood up for her people..she was loyal..honest..and the new Supreme!  Freakshow-Ethel Darling.  A martyr lol.  No but seriously I think she was the biggest hero on the show.  She was loyal and had a big heart..she really helped the freaks out.  Also, how she stood up to Elsa for the greater good of Everybody around her and lost her life makes her a hero in my book."

AmericanHorrorStory,30qhe7,pcKid2,12,Sun Mar 29 20:55:44 2015 UTC,Each season is a different story with quite a few of the same actors playing different roles.  It isn't clear whether or not all the events are occurring in the same universe.  I only just started Season 3 but I'd say I like Season 2 the best so far.
AmericanHorrorStory,30qhe7,busmans,8,Sun Mar 29 20:59:48 2015 UTC,"I would say Season 2 is generally considered the best on this sub and in critical circles.  Season 3 was the most popular and most accessible.   Season 1 is the most contained and least complicated.   Season 4 has the highest production value, and its two main ""villains"" are arguably the best in the series (a series that has quite a few fantastic villains)."
AmericanHorrorStory,30qhe7,Cafrilly,3,Sun Mar 29 22:45:40 2015 UTC,"Which 2 villains? Twisty and Dandy? Or Stanley?

AmericanHorrorStory,30qhe7,TheTipsyChicken,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:51:56 2015 UTC,"No, this isn't true. We first heard about Pepper from a leaked call sheet over the summer and then it was confirmed later in September in an Entertainment Weekly interview with Ryan. And Lily's return was announced just before Halloween. None of this was revealed at Paley or the premiere. And even if it was announced at the premiere, the premiere was like three days before the first episode aired, not 60 days."
AmericanHorrorStory,30qhe7,TheTipsyChicken,3,Sun Mar 29 23:02:41 2015 UTC,"It is an anthology series, meaning each season has a different setting, tone, story, plot, characters even though the show like to use recurring cast members a lot of the time.  Murderhouse-the story of a haunted house in LA, which also focuses heavily on infidelity.  Festures ghosts, murders, blackmailing, etc.  Mostly supernatural occurrences.  asylum-the story of briarcliff asylum, an east coast tuberculosis ward bought by the catholic church to act as a sanitarium.  Features a serial killer, the devil/possession, secret experiments, raspers, the angel of death and more! Psychological/supernatural   Coven-the story of Robicheaux Academy..a a boarding school in Now Orleans for a group of witches known as the coven.  Features more serial killers, witches and their hunters, and other things I won't go into so i dont ruin it. ""Campy""  Freakshow-Jupiter Florida, the story of s traveling freakshow troupe and their fight to remain in business during the time freakshows were dying out and the TV era was taking over.  More of a psychological season than a supernatural one.   Season 5-hotel-so far we only know of five actors who will play in the season and that it is based around a hotel!  Ryan has said all of the seasons are connected..well at least season 2 is connected to 4 which is connected to 1.  So far, we have only been given a couple of connections for freakshow and asylum. youll have to watch them to see what they are for yourself!  Id say give each season a chance..I really liked Murderhouse..continued on to asylum and I honestly didn't think I would like it too much but after watching it it is definitely one of my favorite seasons..I then had seen a bunch of negative reviews on coven but I still gave it a chance and thought it was better than people were giving credit for..by that point freak show was airing last October so I watched it on a week to week basis and was happy with it overall for the most part!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30qhe7,TheTipsyChicken,1 point,Sun Mar 29 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"I did not watch these in order, but how is Season 4 connected to Season 1? I noticed 2 connections between 2 and 4 (Pepper and Hans Gruber) but those were the only connections I've noticed between any seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,30qhe7,TheTipsyChicken,6,Mon Mar 30 01:36:43 2015 UTC,"Every season is telling its own story, but since season 4 they changed the rules and are now saying each season will be connected SOMEHOW. The whole thing is vague but so far the connections have really just been easter eggs for fans They've only shown that season 2 and 4 are in the same universe. Were in the dark on how any of the other seasons are connected. You've just opened the Pandora's box of this sub. It really depends on your taste in horror. Season 1 has a good amount of conventional jump scares, but focuses more on the drama of the family. Season 2 is mostly psychological but throws in demon possessions/aliens. That particular season is a mixed bag for fans. Season 3 is best described as a black-comedy. And season 4 follows the theme's of exploitative horror films."
AmericanHorrorStory,30qhe7,TheTipsyChicken,2,Sun Mar 29 21:34:57 2015 UTC,"I really don't think they are all connected as I haven't seen any of the seasons make a nod towards another, but only the creators of the show really know. Each season tells a completely different story with some of the same actors playing new characters.  Same with this. They all span somewhat different eras so it's possible but I doubt they are all in the same reality.  I loved season two and three. Season four didn't do it for me as much, but I'm excited for five.    Hope you're loving the show!"

I recall Pepper (didn't know they called her by the same name, but may have missed that) but I don't recall the others. To your credit, I watched Freakshow in a yawn-filled haze, so if they were later in the season I'd given up by then.  Mostly would like to see Ryan's statement."
AmericanHorrorStory,30qhe7,TheTipsyChicken,3,Sun Mar 29 21:48:34 2015 UTC,"And yes Pepper is called by the same name.  The actress that plays Pepper is Naomi Grossman and she was the first character (along with Lily Rabes, Sister Mary EUNICE McKee to appear in multiple seasons).  Peppers makeup and costume is so well done, I have read many peoples account of her character and some people ACTUALLY thought Naomi grossman/pepper really was a microcephalic woman that appeared on 2 seasons, but long alas, she is just a woman in outstanding make up and hair!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30qhe7,Feedy92,3,Sun Mar 29 21:43:50 2015 UTC,"Yes I've seen a photo of her outside of it, and it's really incredible what they can do with prosthetic makeup now days. It was actually Freakshow that pushed me to really look up the actors, and theres a wonderful documentary of the girl who plays Ma Petite. I'll have to find it, but that poor girl (age about 20-21 now) has been walking on two broken legs since 16 due to a hormone issue which prevents bone growth. Something I'd never know if not for AHS.  Freakshow does a good job of making the actors intriguing while not making them a joke. :) While I didn't love the season I did love how they respected the actors they brought in."

Very confusing. And yes, Mat Frazer is actually a wonderful performer and comedian. I saw a picture of his junk when I looked him up on Google....that was odd...   And Erika is just gorgeous. Such a beautiful woman I can't imagine someone calling her a freak.   That's the most redeeming factor I think about Freakshow. The freaks are the 'normal' folks with horrible secrets and motives, whereas the 'normal' ones are those with the physical disorders. Makes you really analyze your humanity. :)  And gosh, I just love Jyoti. She's so enthusiastic about life, and I loved listening to her talk about clothes and music and being a movie star. Makes you realize that America, UK, India, Africa, wherever...teenage girls all love the same things lol!"

It just so happened that Ben and Tate both impregnated her."

If she was, that's At least 3 sets of twins featured on that season and that is the underlying theme I was speaking of, even though it probably has no major barring on the show, it's just odd to write twins into the season 3 seperate times!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30o3a5,ahsfreakshow,10,Sun Mar 29 04:58:27 2015 UTC,Hayden was only pregnant with one child; season one's theme has a lot to do with infidelity so I think she was a foil to Ben's (failing) attempt to start a new life in the Murder House.

AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,brokenpenisagain,55,Sat Mar 28 16:33:11 2015 UTC,We should consider that they altered episodes in the second half of Freakshow to remove musical numbers. They are aware that we didn't like them.

AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,n_alvarez2007,12,Sat Mar 28 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"EXACTLY!  I mean people made a much bigger deal out of the musical performances than it should've been.  For one, there was what? An ENTIRE 7 minutes of combined musical performances over a 13 episode season?  Secondly, people at freak shows really DID perform in these ways..:and finally the musical songs had a purpose and acted as a part of character development..fiona Apple, kurt cobain/nirvana, Lana del Rey and David Bowie all considered themselves as freaks and if you look at the lyrics for each song, it ties into that character who is performing the song.  For example Evan a.k.a. lobster boy performs to come as you are by Nirvana..""come as you are as a friend as I want you to be take your time hurry up the choice is yours just don't be late"" that entire song is talking about being the person you were born to be and not trying to conform to the patterns of society...elsa Mars sang gods and monsters and heros..both songs that lyrically tie into else's character and what she was going through on the season...bette and dottes version of criminal..""I've been a bad bad girl.."" Those lyrics kind of tied into the storyline of the Tadler's killing their mother & then joining the freak show to fit in with people like themselves and gain acceptance!!!  And YES, originally others were to perform songs, IE Kathy bates but they removed it after seeing how much fans were bitching about performances and comparing it to glee, so they cut out some musical numbers and are adding them to the freakshow DVDs special features!!! And as far as GaGa being cast as a stunt ornANYTHJNG else..its like Ryan Murphy said...""  ""I haven't seen her [acting] yet. But she studied acting and I think in many ways that's what she wanted to do first,"" Murphy told Entertainment Tonight. ""I think she's been looking for some outlet to really dig in there and create a character. I guarantee the role will shock people. What's she's playing.""  The 49-year-old Primetime Emmy-winning director also explained why the casting of the 28-year-old singer was not leaked until the Mother Monster herself announced the news last month via Twitter.  ""It was just something that she did very, very privately. It was sort of a creative investigation,"" Murphy said of the ""Born This Way"" hitmaker's decision to star in the next season of the horror anthology series. ""My favorite thing in the world would be when I would, of the blue, get a call from her and they'd say, 'Hold for Gaga. Lol"". So I think Ryan is well aware that although she hasn't done a whole plethora of acting appearances she did attend acting school and originally set out to be an actor before making it as a musician!  If he has faith in her then I do too!!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,thegreenmachine90,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:25:17 2015 UTC,"I LOATHE Glee, but I didn't mind the musical numbers in AHS. The one in season 2 with Jessica Lange seemed really random, the one in season 3 with Stevie Nicks worked because it involved a time lapse of them practicing for the seven wonders, and season 4 worked because--like you mentioned--it was true to the life of a carnie. I've actually enjoyed the musical numbers they had on the show. I felt like in season four they really did enhance the story and tie back to what was going on."
AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,anandamidetrip,-1,Fri Apr 10 18:02:12 2015 UTC,"An ENTIRE 7 minutes of combined musical performances over a 13 episode season?   Literally your whole argument is completely invalided by that sentence when you consider that they allegedly took out about half of the musical number because the audience didn't like them.  Besides, I'm pretty sure there were more than 7 minutes of performances. I mean: Life on Mars (twice), Criminal, Gods and Monsters, Come as you are, September Song - and each number was about 3 minutes, so that's about 18 minutes already. And now you have to consider that it wasn't just ""narrative content > sing a song > narrative content"". There was a set up and a set down before and after each musical number, adding to the ""wasted"" time."
AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,anandamidetrip,3,Sun Mar 29 00:38:06 2015 UTC,"Please show me where I said they took out ""half"" of the musical numbers because I def NEVER said that.  I said ""ORIGINALLY others WERE TO perform and that they took out ""some musical numbers"" but AS FAR AS I KNOW, the only one they removed 100% for sure was Kathy Bates performance of a song she did by the group ""hole"" or ""garbage"" (can't remember which band exactly).  And again, this is what im speaking of when I say that people make a bigger deal out of it than it really is..everybody knows Ryan Murphy created Glee and we all know he has a passion for music and entertainers!  Also likes to cast musicians and entertainers on American horror story but that does not necessarily mean that they will perform on that season!    Evan peters: come as you are 2:17  Jessica Lange:Gods and Monsters 2:55  Jessica Lange: Heros 2:47  sarah Paulson: Criminal 2:12  Ok so 9.5 minutes of performances..and go ahead and look at how long each episode ran for without performances..and you will see that the episodes that featured musical numbers, along with peppers episode were ""extended"" episodes which were longer than the ""regular"" episodes.  I feel like if people were so put out by the musical performances last year and they're afraid that this year is going to be the same way because of Cheyenne Jackson and Lady Gaga then the best possible solution is to not watch..Ryan is going to do his thing and follow his heart and go in whatever direction he wants to it's his cell he's the boss all we can do is hope that it draws our interest in the best possible way and nothing turns us away too much.  I for one am not somebody who is going to freak out if a song pops up every once in a while like the name game or something like that..however if they had been pulling that shit on asylum or murderhouse, then okay I could see why people make the argument but fbut for a freak show?! come on thats a little different story. And anybody trying to compare American horror story to glee is flat out just looking to argue because they are nothing alike in anyway shape or form!! I however am done with this discussion goodbye!!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,anandamidetrip,1 point,Sun Mar 29 01:01:29 2015 UTC,Ryan is going to do his thing and follow his heart and go in whatever direction he wants to it's his cell he's the boss   If he's following his heart then why did he cut musical numbers from freakshow? Murphy has always been easily influenced by fans.
AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,Iamdarb,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:17:44 2015 UTC,"Well freakshow had a different writer for each show, that's why I personally feel it was poorly written at times and had an""thrown together"" type feeling towards the middle and end..(and maybe all all of the other seasons had multiple riders per episode but I feel that the past two seasons were just a little bit more poorly written and then the first two again that is my own personal opinion and doesn't mean shit).and I wasn't aware he cut musical numberS from the show, I had only heard he cut the one kathy bates performance from the show..it was supposed to air on the ""fat lady sings"" episode but they killed Ethel off so I really don't know to be honest.  I have a big feeling that the original script was adjusted and changed many times throughout the season and that's why inthink it was kind of sloppy..too many writers on board..Id be happier if it was mostly brad and Ryan doing the majority of the writing and directing.. And yes, Murphey is easily influenced by fans...that could be taken as both good and bad i guess.  But if you're not keeping the fans happy you're not getting ratings and if you're not getting ratings you're not getting another chance to produce for the future so I wouldn't say he is a sell out or anything I would just say that he is a smart businessman and does what he thinks he should do at that time to keep the fans happy.  They could've taken the basic plot for freak show and made 10 different scripts that all had different beginning middle and end's and no matter what people would bitch about each and every script..it's the burden of the beast!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,Iamdarb,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:13:48 2015 UTC,"Well freakshow had a different writer for each show   I believe every season has been like this. In fact its pretty common for shows to do this. I personally don't think this is the reason the quality of the show has gone down. I think its bc they don't plot a full season ahead of time. It seems like they initially start out with characters/events that kick off the season, then write the rest later on. Some of the ideas they banked on playing out for the latter half can't be stretched into full episodes so they just throw in another character/subplot to kill time, leaving a butchered/messy story.    that is my own personal opinion and doesn't mean shit   Opinions aren't shit if they're well-backed :P Not blaming you but people on this sub/site can easily forget this.   I wasn't aware he cut musical numberS from the show   I can't seem to find the article but I believe Dandy and/or Ima were supposed to have one. And I think Elsa had one more too.   no matter what people would bitch about each and every script   I think every show with a hard-core fan base has this problem. But speaking from personal experience a lot of people who watch this show are horror fans, not Murphy/Falchuck fans. It seems like with each seasons the writers focus is turning away from horror and more towards the campy, theatrical, diva-worship that the pair are known for. I'm not saying horror is absent, but the writers seem to care MORE about the latter than the former, disappointing a large part of this shows fanbase."
AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,Snork_Nork,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:20:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with Ya, especially on the writing part of it and not being all the way plotted out!  I'll have to see what I can find about Dandy having a song cut..I know ima/Chrissy Metz didn't film anything (although she should have, if anyone did because Chrissy is an amazing singer in real life!!).  If the songs hadn't been put in the show, As in ANY of them, i don't think it would have had a negative effect on the show..and I understand why it upset people.  My only realistic argument in favor of the songs, were it was a freakshow..if tate or ben Harmon had busted out a song in the murderhouse basement , or dr. Arden or oliver thredson had performed ""do you really want to hurt me"" by boy George on the Asylum staircase I would have been pissed (lmao)!  And I also just checked and you're right about each season having a different writer for each episode!  It's crazy thenway TV stuff works compared to movies, especially with editing and how scenes are filmed!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,littleotterpop,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:50:08 2015 UTC,"I wish Ima was fleshed out more. She had an intriguing character. I've wondered whether her character was ashamed about being fat or if she accepted her freak self. So much potential! And I thought that one episode called ""The Fat Lady Sings"" was going to have her number in it before it was cut, no? I guess Kathy could of been the ""fat lady"" singing but Ima deserved more!  You're right most freakshows included singing. I personally didn't like them, and agree with the sentiment that they made the show feel more like Glee bc of the anachronism. If they were songs from the 1940's/50's that would be fine! Partially what made ""The Name Game"" so successful was that it added to the vibe of the era. But including songs from this era felt like Murphy wanted another reason to include his favorite pop hits in another one of this shows, rather than reinforcing the theme's of the show. I know the songs were picked bc the artists who originally performed them at some point called themselves ""freaks"", but that doesn't actually reinforce any theme's WITHIN the show. It's the same thing w/ including Stevie Nicks music bc she's a rumored witch, it will either be a hit or a miss."

Just because Gaga made it as a talented singer does not mean she is unable to act, plenty of singers transition into acting and do great I'm sure Gaga can pull it off this will really be her first starring role in anything so let's wait til October to judge her!  Ps, another good video to watch to consider her acting is her opening monologue at the 2011 VMAs when she played her Male alter-ego. Really shows her potential IMO.  2011 VMA link: http://youtu.be/WUNCkw6OeOY"

AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,sighcology,9,Sat Mar 28 20:39:35 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed that - Gaga did a great job. Thought provoking, beautiful and arty. Although its one thing to do a monologue, another to have to bounce off other actors to simulate genuine interaction.      My worry is casting Gaga is that she's basically be going to be the replacement Diva obsession that Murphy had for Lange the last couple of seasons. I can see them going down the road of making the Hotel a giant metaphor for the ""closet"" with very heavy LGBT subtext. Gaga will be protecting her ""little monsters"" in the hotel perhaps literally as vampires, werewolves and ghouls who all the ""normals"" misunderstand ""It is not them but You who are the true monsters!"". But they over did that in Coven and Freak Show and its trite and boring.      I think Murphy indulgently projects himself into these roles - Ruthless Glorious Queen Bee Bitch of the entertainment industry who promotes and protects the LGBT cause. Its admirable but its death to the art and interesting story."
AmericanHorrorStory,30lytz,dis0riented,2,Sat Mar 28 22:04:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I think your worry for next season is something I would actually enjoy! ""American Horror Story"", at least in my opinion, doesn't just represent scary elements like ghosts and monsters, but I also feel it incorporates real-life ""American Horror"": American society's ills. In season 3, that woman cutting down her son from a tree after he had been lynched really stuck with me. This was a TRUE ""American Horror Story"". Slavery, racism, divorce, miscarriage, domestic violence, cheating/affairs, rape, discrimination towards those with disabilities and mental illness, dark parts of Catholicism, WWII....all ""real"" issues that have been dealt with on the show. I think incorporating the struggle for gay rights on the show would be a fantastic addition, as this is something that modern audiences can relate to more."

I know his words Don't mean much and are subject to change but as of right now that is what he is saying!  And as far as gaga goes and with your idea of her being a diva that is possible..but I'm thinking she's going to be a villain..or a good character that we later find out has been a villain the entire time (similar to other seasons ie: Tate, THREDSON, etc).  I think this because Ryan has stated ""we will be very very shocked by Gagas character.  Not who she is but rather WHAT she is!"""

At the start of the series Cordelia was letting herself be hindered by her lack of confidence; Fiona herself says that Delia never reached her full potential, as does Myrtle.  Once Cordelia begins to become the Supreme and become powerful and regain her eyesight, her husband (I want to say Johnny?) has already been outed as a witch hunter. I'm guessing she doesn't have sex with him between then and the end of the season.

But I think they could get away with casting Finn as a guest star like for the halloween episodes..or the last couple episodes similar to Neil Patrick Harris...and with the hotel setting they could actually GET AWAY with having a larger cast..I mean it's a hotel!

AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,RoseBladePhantom,29,Fri Mar 27 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"You wanted the screaming clown from the poster? Well, obviously, the problem here is that you are too literal. You don't seem to understand abstract symbolism. The posters, the trailers, the teasers, the opening are not literal summations of what we will see. They are abstract clues of what the theme, the essence, and the plot will be. They hint delicately at aspects of each season - there is no heavy handed meanings any on the teasers. They serve mainly as an artistic representation of each tale to come."
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,Zinthaniel,23,Sat Mar 28 00:04:37 2015 UTC,"They have everything to do with the show. They are clearly not directly translated into the show, but they hint at situations and themes throughout the season."
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,IamLegba,16,Fri Mar 27 22:06:11 2015 UTC,I think what OP means is that the teasers and opening credits are way more creepy than the actual show. I 100% agree with OP. The teasers and credits just don't fit the tone of the show.
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,anandamidetrip,11,Sat Mar 28 01:49:37 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with that at all, mostly for coven and freak show though. I think season 1 and 2 did a good job of using the promos to build the atmosphere that we were given during the season. I'm simply pointing out that the promos and intro do in fact have something to do with what we see as the season plays out."
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,IamLegba,-9,Sat Mar 28 15:17:03 2015 UTC,"Having just finished binge watching Freak Show, what in the world did that intro have to do with the show besides it having deformed people and clowns?"
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,IamLegba,18,Fri Mar 27 22:20:13 2015 UTC,"SPOILER warning!!! The obvious one would be the clown hinting at twisty, the lobster boy toy points to Jimmy, the spinning wheel with the daggers hints to the scene with Elsa stabbing Paul, the 3-legged doll represents Stanley's endowment, the dolls switching heads point to Dandy attaching another head to his mother's body. So while it does not blatantly show you what's going to happen, they symbolize and hint at things that do happen in the show."
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,IamLegba,-30,Fri Mar 27 22:33:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, I feel like at least half of this a stretch. I'm legit about to watch the intro again to make sure, but how do the dolls switching heads have anything to do with Dandy attaching a head to a body? That's definitely a stretch. And the 3 legged doll hinting that Stanley has a big dong, come on. And Jimmy is clearly a lobster boy from the very start so that's that.   And after watching the intro, the spinning wheel only alludes to the fact that there's a spinning wheel. On it are conjoined twins and I don't even think they got hit, so I don't know how any of that hints to Elsa stabbing Paul.  In any case, I was talking more about all the stuff in the trailers/teasers/ads/intro that don't show up at all or have anything to do with the plot."
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,davis98,18,Fri Mar 27 22:43:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly,  they're not going to openly put obvious pieces of the plot in the intro,  so instead they use things that will pop up during the season, themes, hidden easter eggs, and hints. And this is across all seasons. Coven's title sequence basically states who is going to end up the supreme. There's a video, which I'll attempt to find, with the creators of the title sequence and the promos and they talk about how they put them together and what goes into them and why.   Edit: it's not the video I was looking for,  but check out this article. Murphy talks about how they put in stuff from the season in them. And don't get me wrong, I agree that some of the seasons haven't lived up to the creepiness and atmosphere that the promos create,  but there's definitely a purpose to what we see.  http://www.ew.com/article/2011/09/28/american-horror-story-opening-credits"

AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,mrrobopuppy,9,Fri Mar 27 23:43:10 2015 UTC,I like the beginnings because they give me an eerie feeling to get me ready and excited to watch.  I don't think any season's opener had hints to the plot.
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,IamLegba,6,Fri Mar 27 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"All the intros had hints at plot points, I think the vaguest was Coven's out of all the intros."
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,absquatulating,6,Fri Mar 27 23:19:50 2015 UTC,Both the promos and the intros definitely hint at plot points.
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,israeldmo,0,Fri Mar 27 22:07:58 2015 UTC,what
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,anandamidetrip,6,Sat Mar 28 01:06:38 2015 UTC,"Hey! Graphic designer here.  The problem is that you're looking at the situation from the ""general public"" angle. You seem to think everything is made by the producers and everything was properly thought of by the same people. It's not. It's literally always like that - in every single show or movie.  The team doing the production of the show is completely different than the team doing the marketing, the graphic design and the publicity. These people are in no way affiliated with the production - they've been vaguely briefed and that's it (like, they are told the general story, the main roles, and the general feel).  There's a lot of thought that goes into marketing and publicity that the producers of the show don't really have the capabilities to handle. Sure, they're going to input some ideas here and there, but they don't make the ad campain. Conversely, the marketing team doesn't have a say in the production either.  So it's quite normal that the promo posters, the trailers and everything are basically completely different than the show - unless the trailers are made of actual pieces of footage (and even then, you'll find that there is often footage in a trailer that somehow never actually makes it past post-production into the actual show/movie). The people making them simply don't have any idea what it's actually going to be like.  Plus, you have to remember making a opening sequence is really time-consuming. It can take months. Shows like Freakshow are usually still in production when the first episode airs and often don't have finished scripts - so even the actors don't know what's going to happen next. How can you expect a team of people generally completely unrelated to the production team to know any more.  Besides, history's best opening sequences have always been art pieces completely unrelated to the actual shows/movies. Just look at True Blood's opening sequence. It's considered a masterpiece, but it's nothing like the show. There's plenty more like that: True Detective, The Affair or Masters of Sex."
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,Canines_and_Cards,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:14:50 2015 UTC,The opening credits from HBO's and Showtime's shows are usually fantastic.
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,Atrumentis,7,Sun Mar 29 00:58:11 2015 UTC,"OP I 100% agree with you. The teasers and opening credits are 10x times scarier than the actual show. The tonal shift is jarring. Real shame. They do relate to the show however, as most people have stated."
AmericanHorrorStory,30jcnq,falcon4287,6,Sun Mar 29 06:37:41 2015 UTC,"I think Coven had some good teasers that had some good symbolism. Let me point out some:   The girls being burned at the stake This teaser symbolized the fact that characters may not be really dead even if they're assumed to be (idk like all of the characters besides Fiona and Cordelia were brought back from some sort of dead state). What is also symbolized here is that those who are brought back from the dead are also back with a vengeance (zombies release by Laveau, Misty's catfight with Madison).  The buried lady Delphine LaLaurie The students walking to Miss Robichaeux's Academy Another teaser with a farily good amount of symbolism, the students walk over a minotaur, a cross between a man and a bull, an animal that symbolizes power and virility. The fact that these girls are ignoring the beast somewhat shows female freedom/independence from man. When the girls walk into the house, a stag is standing next to them as they look up at the three elevated figures. The stag symbolizes royalty wisdom, and superiority, hinting at the concept of the Supreme in the season. Also there is a cat that walks across the floor. Another bit of symbolism of females. And a pentagram on the ceiling to go with the demonic themes throughout Coven.   -Screaming-Spinning Girl  Tying in with voodoo doll teasers, the teaser shows the manipulation theme in the season. Marie and Queenie inflicted pain through their voodoo abilities, and characters were constantly manipulating each others to get what they wanted (Fiona's curiosity about Madison bein the Supreme, Marie telling Queenie that she's on the wrong side by being at the Academy).  This teaser's comprehension may be a stretch but it does show a rather exaggerated form of manipulation.   The others I really don't see much symbolism besides hinting at demonic and magical concepts used in the season.   -Well maybe the snake teasers had a bit of significance because the snake usually symbolizes danger and deceit. There was a fair amount of lies scattered throughout the season, but perhaps it ties in with manipulation between characters."

The cast change from season one to season two was pretty drastic. Jessica, Evan and Dylan were the only actors to maintain a starring role from MH to Aslylum. Everyone else either had a small role in MH (Paulson, Quinton), or was a completely new addition. I think keeping that same basic cast on Coven and FS played a part in why many people seem to have gotten bored with this season. Hopefully Hotel will reinvigorate the series."
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,ahandfulofbirds,7,Wed Mar 25 20:17:24 2015 UTC,"It's really just that Lange, Peters, and Paulson have kept major roles in the last three seasons. The casts around them have been pretty varied."

AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,israeldmo,4,Sat Mar 28 15:21:04 2015 UTC,"Lily had a recurring role on Murder House, but a relatively big one. I disagree about Coven.

AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,sozar,4,Thu Mar 26 03:16:26 2015 UTC,Dylan was only a guest star in Asylum. Only Evan and Sarah were regulars in both MH and Asylum.

Idk how the scheduling for filming will work out, and it's possible he returns but I think the ""radical reincention"" FX CEO John Landgraf was speaking about was the cast.  So far we have Gaga, Bomer, Jackson, Bentley and Savigny..official and confirmed.  We know that lange is done by her own choosing.  We know that BAtes, Bassett, Peters, Paulson, O'Hare, Wittrock, Conroy and others all said they would like to return.  And finally we knkw that Paulson, Farmiga, Roberts, Peters, Conroy, Chiklis, Britton, are a involved in other projects.  So I imagine in the coming future announcements for the rest of the cast to be filled we will see a few more new Faces with a couple reoccuring cast members taking smaller roles.  I think it's POSSIBLE the final s5 cast looks somethjng like this:  Lady Gaga*  Matt Bomer*  Cheyenne Jackson*  Wes Bentley*  Chloe Savigny*  Kathy Bates  Denis O'Hare  Grace Gummer  Finn Wittrock  Mat Frazer  Featuring POSSIBLE special guests: Angela Bassett Michelle Pfeifer (Ryan said he'd love to cast her if possible) Taissa Farmiga Evan Peters Sarah Paulson"

AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,Malarkay79,5,Thu Mar 26 06:40:12 2015 UTC,I think Evan's neck needs it's own square.
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,Jashinist,2,Wed Mar 25 23:03:40 2015 UTC,I came here looking for a comment like this. I can't believe it took me so long to find it. Dat neck doe.
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,lucy_inthessky,6,Fri Apr 3 06:03:07 2015 UTC,"Wes Bentley was Edward Mordrake, right?"
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,iTiffany,3,Thu Mar 26 02:18:24 2015 UTC,Yep.
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,iTiffany,5,Thu Mar 26 02:21:23 2015 UTC,"Strange there's so many men, AHS is usually very woman-heavy in casting."
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,FMM08,9,Thu Mar 26 08:29:40 2015 UTC,What is happening with Evan's neck in that picture???!
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,Tehddy,5,Wed Mar 25 19:01:08 2015 UTC,Come ON Ryan. Give me Finn Wittrock!!
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,DawnKit,2,Thu Mar 26 04:58:08 2015 UTC,He really is! I hope RM doesn't pass him up this season. He could be a really creepy bell boy or something.
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,EraticA,20,Thu Mar 26 14:50:05 2015 UTC,I really hope the writers don't let me down again. I stopped watching Freakshow about 4 episodes in.
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,DawnKit,13,Thu Mar 26 15:35:20 2015 UTC,"Same. I like the idea of more new/less-used faces this season, so this casting is promising?"
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,EraticA,7,Wed Mar 25 17:49:30 2015 UTC,You guys missed an epically creepy finale.
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,Tehddy,14,Wed Mar 25 19:39:16 2015 UTC,The finale was maybe the least creepy episode of the season and not satisfying in any way shape or form.
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,DawnKit,13,Wed Mar 25 21:07:43 2015 UTC,"How could you even say that? Dandy confidently walking around, no music playing in the background, shooting everyone in sight...it's literally the shit that can happen in real life."
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,EraticA,12,Wed Mar 25 22:57:31 2015 UTC,That was actually the scene I think was the LEAST satisfying. In my opinion having Dandy kill them all off like that was a writers cop out. Like they suddenly realized they needed a conclusion for all of these characters but couldn't fit it in - so just have dandy kill them!
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,DawnKit,5,Thu Mar 26 00:48:27 2015 UTC,Finn Wittrock even said he felt a little it ripped off with the season finale ending with him shooting everybody he said he didn't understand why the entire season they let him do more intimate murders like stabbing and decapitation but then ended it with a shootout!!
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,Tehddy,2,Thu Mar 26 01:26:08 2015 UTC,Completely agree. They were like ohhhh crap we have too many open plotlines :/// I guess we can just kill everyone we don't want to wrap up and then we can manage to squeeze everything into the finale in the most unsatisfying way possible...
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,ahandfulofbirds,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:06:30 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree with that, I hated how they just killed 'em all off. They did it in a fucking magical way, though.   ...I'm a bit weird I guess."
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,Iamdarb,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:40:20 2015 UTC,I think you're glorifying Dandy or something dude. If it had been any other character that killed them like that would it be as cool to you?

AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,SlumberCat,8,Thu Mar 26 02:53:39 2015 UTC,"Wes Bentley is awesome, and I felt kind of cheated out of his character last season. He's a good actor who was given kind of a lame, one dimensional character, so I'm hoping they give him a little more elbow room this time around."
AmericanHorrorStory,309wev,bwood16,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:59:57 2015 UTC,Lame. What do you mean lane. Next to twisty he was the coolest damn character.

AmericanHorrorStory,30bzf1,Androuv,9,Thu Mar 26 03:04:59 2015 UTC,"If my counting is correct, based on opening credits, each season has had 6,8,9,10 series regulars respectively. Right now we have 5 so I think we can expect about 3 more, I imagine they don't want as large a cast as freakshow as it made the story lose focus.  The cast for Hotel still needs a strong female, so I'm thinking either Kathy or Angela has to return, if not a new face. Speaking of Grace Gummer, what are chances of AHS snagging her mother Meryl Streep? That'd be huge...  Unless they're doing it purposely the cast is also missing a younger face, along the veins of Emma/Taissa. My bets on a newcomer. (Would love Grace Gummer!)  Lastly, Ryan usually strives for diverse characters, I'm hoping for some people of color or just someone not white. Angela Bassett seems obvious pick, but we will see.  And that rounds out the 3 remaining slots I think should be filled!"
AmericanHorrorStory,30bzf1,IamLegba,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:20:28 2015 UTC,"I would love to see Grace Gummer on the season too!

AmericanHorrorStory,30bzf1,bwood16,4,Sat Mar 28 06:46:52 2015 UTC,"I would be REALLY IMPRESSED if he managed to get James Cromwell and Joseph Fiennes back on board, if even for a limited role.  Imagine if he could get Bates and Cromwell on board together, an old creepy couple who know the history of the hotel, keeping its secrets!  Joseph Fiennes and Denis O'Hare playing completely DIFFERENT brothers...Finn Wittrock and Grace Gummer as a celebrity couple..who knows!!?! lol.. idk why I even bother posting all of this crap that I spend time racking my brain on.  NOTHING is EVER concrete with this show, & i think Ryan can be overly-creative at times --sometimes too much for his own good --that he gets sidetracked and forgets what he initially set out to do!! Lol"
AmericanHorrorStory,30bzf1,smellsliketatespirit,2,Thu Mar 26 03:15:18 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. Cromwell, Fiennes, or even Danny Huston would be awesome as regulars."

AmericanHorrorStory,30a8vn,SimeonsDilemma,10,Wed Mar 25 19:10:15 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you! I'd love if each season only had that small handful of major roles (like season one) with more people able to recurr in minor and one-shot roles. Way more exciting. I think in addition to the current casting, and where we see the old repertory cast going (Frances being cast in a Netflix sitcom, Taissa on a new show, ACS and Scream Queens folks) what you're presenting is incredibly likely. :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,30a8vn,Tehddy,6,Wed Mar 25 20:06:21 2015 UTC,"It's a shame about Conroy, I was kind of hoping now that Jessica Lange's left she'd get a lead role. The closest we've seen to her being a main cast member was Moira, and even then she had to share that role"
AmericanHorrorStory,30a8vn,AlfieBoheme,7,Thu Mar 26 18:14:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree. She's drastically underused in AHS. I was so disappointed with how pointless Gloria ended up being. :/"

I'd love to see Frances Conroy back though, she kills every role and I think she's shown the most range out of the regular cast. I could take or leave O'Hare, but I do like his past involvement.   If I could only pick one vet to come back though, I think it would be Angela Bassett. She just does it for me."

I absolutely adore Chloe Sevigny and have been keeping up with her career for decades now. She is a great artistic actress that is not afraid to push boundaries, so she will definitely be a force to be reckoned with in AHS as a main character. If her script is good I really think this can be a special season, as I am loving the new cast."

The assassin is immortal and had commit every murder.   Setting: 1963 DC, except for flashbacks and the eventual Dallas scene.   Actors: Evan Peters as JFK, Denis O'Hare as the main society leader and also Abe Lincoln, Lily Rabe as a white house worker who tries to reveal the plan and dies in the process, Sarah Paulson as Mary Todd Lincoln, Finn Wittrock as Lee Harvey Oswald/John Wilkes Booth/Leon Czolgosz, Katie Holmes as Jackie Kennedy, Ashton Kutcher as Bobby Kennedy, Jon Benjamin as William McKinley, Frances Conroy as a society member, Taissa Farmiga as the society leader's daughter."

She learns of a separate world of goblins, sprites, elves, etc. She becomes engrossed in the politics of a coup happening in the hierarchy of that world while being seen as mad by her loved ones in the real world.  cast: not sure, but definitely Kathy Bates, Even Peters, Sarah Paulson( as an elf?).

It basically follows hopeless journey of an American astronaut crew to the moon after they are steered off-course and the events that happen on Earth. This would be an opportunity to explore some pretty cool special effects.  Cast:  Sarah Paulson as Crew Member- The aggressive and distant Flight Engineer.  Evan Peters as Crew Member- The lovable, joking, pilot.  Finn Wittrock as Crew Member- The upbeat and morale boosting mechanic.  Lily Rabe as Crew Member- The professional and constructive co-pilot.  Wes Bentley as Crew Member- The ship's captain, a natural leader.  Dennis O'Hare as Mission Control- The man at Mission Control who guides the crew after the accident.  James Cromwell as Director of CDC- The Director when the CDC claims that contaminants infected the mission.  (I can't think of any more. Reply if you think of some names for the characters!)"

Constance was a terrible person but Lange's portrayal made her one of my favorite characters of all seasons. I don't even know how to explain Jude. She went from being a horrible person that I hated, to one of the characters I was rooting for. Her descent into madness was believable and made me feel something for the character."

AmericanHorrorStory,30247l,LinzDarling,5,Tue Mar 24 08:02:03 2015 UTC,"That's a hard question.  I'd say Sister Jude. There were just so many facets to her. You went from hating her to loving her.  A close second for me would be Elsa. It's hard to decide whether she's a good person, or at least  whether she really does love her monsters. I think it was obvious she was narcissistic and self-serving, but she did seem to have at lease some level of love for the freaks.  Constance was great, too. Just not as much of my favorite as the other two. I didn't care for Fiona, but then again I didn't care for Coven as a whole."
AmericanHorrorStory,30247l,silverse,5,Tue Mar 24 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"Constance, she was (in my opinion) her most three-dymensional character. You'd know what her motivation was and knew of the sorrows of her life, this woman that was raised to be beautiful and famous and rich but ended up being mediocre and having this children she loves but also hates at the same time and blames for ruining ""her chance"". You could see and feel the ambivalent feelings towards both Tate and (especially) Adelaide and could move from ""what a total bitch worst mom ever"" to ""poor woman, her life couldn't have been easy and you can tell she cares about them deep down"" in a matter of seconds. Even at the end, when her selfishness in wanting to raise a ""beautiful child"" will probably bring nothing but doom, you can't help but feel sorry for her"

She did A tremendous job with all of her characters but I think her second best performance was as Elsa Mars.  Like Jude, Elsa had a lot of depth and we saw all of the different sides of her!  Fiona and Constance both had the similar ""bitchy"" attitude and the whole ""IFGAF what your saying, it's all ME, ME, ME!"" Down to a tee which is cool because that's where they wanted her to go with it but like you said..the overall character transformation of Jude was amazing.

The only two known connections are (1) Pepper going from the freak show to Briarcliff and (2) Arden cutting Elsa's legs off. These two instances actually connect the stories together; these other things don't. How do you propose that the ""Sign of the Cross"" connects the two seasons? Does Elsa lend her personal copy to Jude that night? Come on. Also you say you're asking for others' opinions but I shared mine and now you're attacking me for it? All I'm saying is that now that the seasons are connected we can't confuse things that Ryan just puts in there for shits and giggles and the things that actually tie the seasons together."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zz00u,ahsfreakshow,2,Mon Mar 23 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I can agree with that.  And I wasn't attacking you for your opinion, just saying that there may be more on the table than we know of so far!!  Could it be possible that there is a connection between Jude and Elsa though?  In any way, shape or form?  Some people think they are the same person but I don't find this to be possible.  However they could be sisters or cousins!  One website says ""Elsa Mars and Sister Jude: Before Sister Jude became a nun to repent for a hit-and-run accident, she was a nightclub singer. Does that sound like any other glamorous blonde we know? Elsa and Sister Jude even have the same favorite movie, The Sign of the Cross! All signs point to Sister Jude being deeply connected to Elsa"" ..Or like you said, I could be way off and overlooking things and Ryan added that as a fan pleaser!"

AmericanHorrorStory,2zycua,tylos89,27,Sun Mar 22 23:23:22 2015 UTC,"Moira doesn't age.  She has two appearances, but she doesn't age.  None of the ghosts do.  Moira's older appearance refers to her ""old soul""/the multi-faceted nature of her character. There's more to her than meets the eye. She's not just a sexy maid. During the course of the show, Moira talks with Vivien about literature and medicine. That's not something that just any maid would know about. Despite being pretty, Moira is also intelligent. Early on in the show, she tells Vivien that women see the true essence of a person, who they really are, and that men just see what's on the outside. The reason Moira has that second appearance is because she's more complicated than most of the female characters on the show. If you look at a lot of the women, their through-lines are pretty easy to follow. Constance wants a picture-perfect family and resents the world for not getting it. Hayden is the scorned mistress. Vivien is the wronged wife. Violet hates everyone and everything. Nora is a stuck-up socialite. None of these ideas are all that complex, so they get that simple characterization, that one ""appearance."" Moira works in shades of gray, which gives her the dual images and looks people see her by. When a person dies in Murder House, their essence/soul is preserved. Usually that includes their appearance. But since Moira was more than just a pretty face, her apparition has more mystery to it."

AmericanHorrorStory,2zycua,mansonfamily,3,Mon Mar 23 02:59:16 2015 UTC,This is a brilliant response I might save this and quote it for every time someone asks the question
AmericanHorrorStory,2zycua,ahsfreakshow,6,Mon Mar 23 08:47:47 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, Tate had just spoken with Ben earlier that day at the park and Ben went into this crying spiel about how Violet is his little girl and all that, so that could've thrown Tate off a bit. Keep in mind that Tate and Violet do end up having sex in episode 8, so it's not like he only got it up that one time for Vivien.   Regarding Moira, the prevailing theory is that it had to do with the fact that her body was still on the property (buried in the backyard), so there was still some part of her decaying alongside her spirit, which allowed her to age. By that logic, we could expect Hayden and Violet to age over the coming decades as well since their bodies are also on the premises."

AmericanHorrorStory,2ztly1,OhDear3,44,Sat Mar 21 18:42:28 2015 UTC,I think she really takes the cake. She just feels like she's on another level. There is no psychological trauma(that we know of) like Thredson. No genetic issues like Dandy.  She just got off on torturing unwilling people.

I wouldn't say maybe that one Mongol back in the day was a psychopath because he started crucifying people.   Nevermind... as I was typing I just realized I couldn't devil's advocate her and not feel bad.  She's really evil for what she did to her daughters at least and trying to be ahead of the game in skin care products.

Everyone else is stating the obvious,  but what if tate wasn't just a psychopath? He shows traits of a sociopath at best at different times with different people. He manipulated violet, raped her mother, caused most of the problems in the house which led to the deaths of most characters.   Not to mention the NERVE of him lying to the kids he shot in the library; after their confrontation.... he defnitely knew who he was and what he did.   Tate Langdon is glorified in this fandom; which in itself reiterates what I mean when I say: Tate is the biggest psycho of them all, even when he does all that evil shit  his character is still able to gain sympathy/empathy from everyone else simply because he can confuse your reactions to his creations."

AmericanHorrorStory,2ztly1,derby_girl2z19,-5,Sat Mar 21 23:06:23 2015 UTC,"I disagree that he's a psychopath or sociopath. The fact that he freaked so hard when Violet committed suicide,  and his efforts to save her show he truly had the ability to love another person, something a psychopath or sociopath would be unable to do. I mean, if he was only interested in her for sex or attention, he would get that with her death."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ztly1,Henry_Burris,-2,Sun Mar 22 01:17:01 2015 UTC,Please read my answer below.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ztly1,violetgranger,-8,Sun Mar 22 01:18:29 2015 UTC,"Nah I disagree. He is a teenager in life and death. He's a whiny bitch most of the time on screen. He hides his face and rapes Viv, he hides his past from Violet. He's a coward and being that self aware is not in the MO of a true psychopath."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ztly1,Buffythevampireslaya,9,Sat Mar 21 23:44:46 2015 UTC,"Nope, dude, he's a psycho. I'm a teenager and I dont know anybody that does fucked up shit like that. Doesn't matter if he's dead he's got the traits of a socipath as well as psychopath, and while sociopaths are very suave in the way they manipulate people they do have weaknesses and do not want to be shown as weak, hence ""he hides his face"" and hides his past from violet. Tate inexplicably knows what he did to Violet (and her mother) was terrible, and, in the second to last episode he says something along the lines of ""You're all I want! You're all I HAVE!"" Is he regarding Violet's feelings there? nope. it's all about him. me, me, me. He doesn't give a shit about anyone or anything as long as he gets to control it.  Yes, he's a whiny bitch. But he's also a whiny bitch who is so hell-bent on having Violet all to himself, and if he cares about her SO MUCH why wouldn't he tell her that she was dead, at first? Oh yeah, he wanted to make himself seem like HE was the hero for saving her from dying (what she originally believed) instead of actually saying to her ""you're dead like me now"" again, for the satisfaction of whom? him.  TL;DR: Tate Langdon is a huge sociopath/psychopath and he would rather pretend that he saved a girl's life to get more intimate with her rather than tell her the truth so her family can be saved. If he cared for her really, he'd do everything in his power to get her to live. But...noooooope."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ztly1,violetgranger,7,Sun Mar 22 01:14:08 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but what seperates a psychopath and sociopath from an asshole is an inability to care about another. Her suicide meant she would be with him forever, but he didn't want her to suffer that.  Edit: you make a good point in how he breaks the news to her, but that could also be explained as him just being an immature, rageful soul.  But it could also be an inconsistency in writing  Either way, i def see your viewpoint!"

Hands down. He feels no remorse. He only regrets his actions because they push Violet away, which ultimately drives him away from what he wants; what he thinks should be. We know he views himself as a bit of a vigilante because of how he describes his decision to kill his classmates in 1994. He visits Dr. Harmon not because he wants to reform, but because his mother wants him to. Instead, he uses the opportunity to probe Dr. Harmon for stories told by other patients about death, vices and sexual affliction .   In fact (spoiler), we find out in the end that he does in fact remember everything he's done, unlike he's expressed to Violet and Dr. Harmon. He had originally lied to him because it was part of the manipulation. He needs them to see him the way he wants to be seen. He knows the hard facts of his actions and can recite them stone faced. He knows, but has not learned. He's not vengeful like Hayden, or simple like the Infantata. He manipulates those around him to serve as a cast to his distorted vision of what the future and the ""good"" really are. He is tortured by the effect his own logic and thoughts have had on him. He manipulates even himself in order to satisfy his desires and actions. He wants the Harmons to accept him and love him, but he gives no promise to change or to alter his behavior.  I suppose its a lovely sentiment, wanting to be loved and accepted as you are. I suppose, even serial killers need love too. But none the less, I don't think it would satisfy Tate to receive.

Coven had a lot of flashbacks like that and I really enjoyed them. Whether it be New England colonies, western mining town, etc.  2- something involving American folklore? Monsters, Bigfoot, native American legends etc.  3- A boarding school with something freaky happening.  On another note, not sure if any of you read A series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket. But each book has great ideas with lots being AHS seasons. Book 9 was about a carnival, book 12 a hotel, book 8 was a hospital which was similar to asylum."

AmericanHorrorStory,2ztwt1,acivodul,2,Sat Mar 21 20:56:54 2015 UTC,Season based around Edgar Allen Poe and his various stories. Each episode could focus on one of his original horror stories while blending scenes of moments from his life.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ztwt1,zbreeze8,0,Sun Mar 22 00:42:28 2015 UTC,I have so many ideas about this but I narrowed it down to my top 3.   something to do with cats that get up to stuff at night. something to do with tiny little people who live in the walls that get up to stuff at night. A cheese factory in West Virginia.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zsgs2,joheli,3,Sat Mar 21 08:29:48 2015 UTC,"In the documentary, it showed a clip from the expose of Willowbrook- the words and camera angles, lighting etc was is remarkably similar to that of Briar Cliffe"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zsgs2,Titdick_McAnusbutts,11,Sat Mar 21 08:31:45 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it was deliberately done. Lana shows shades of a young Gerlado with her determination to break a big story.   My girlfriend and I had watched Cropsey a year or so before season 2 aired and we both lost our shit at how Ryan incorporated it into the story."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zsgs2,Echo5582,3,Sat Mar 21 15:37:03 2015 UTC,I second this! I recognized it instantly that they copied a lot of the images in the original footage! I love how they took that real life situation and molded it for AHS! I can really see how the story line for Asylum was taken from Willowbrook and Cropsey...although I'm a bit ashamed to say that I didn't fully realize that until I saw that article...
AmericanHorrorStory,2zsgs2,MyLittleStoney,2,Wed Mar 25 05:58:26 2015 UTC,"Yes! I just saw Cropsey the other day (I thought it was really good), and when I saw that part I was like whoa, this is the Lana documentary exactly!

AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,suzepie,34,Sat Mar 21 05:43:04 2015 UTC,Whatever. Bringing her on is a sure sign of jumping the shark. Last season was so terribly below average that I fear for the next. And not the good kind of fear.

Musically speaking, she has managed to turn everything she touches into gold, but I am curious to see wether she can pull this off."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,lovewd,7,Sat Mar 21 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"I know I'll get downvoted for this, but it won't stop me from voicing my opinion. I don't want lady gaga on this show at all. I don't think she's going to be a good addition. She does have the ""horror"" factor, but something inside me just doesn't want her on the show. Oh well, there's nothing I can do about it anyway"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,potterhead16,15,Sat Mar 21 18:45:54 2015 UTC,He doesn't even know what her acting abilities are! Am I the only one that finds it extremely odd to do this?? I know he wants her celeb credibility but you could write her the most amazing character and she could still blow chunks.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,Infersader,8,Sat Mar 21 16:08:45 2015 UTC,She could surprise us but it's pretty obvious he did it for the attention. There's plenty of much better actresses out there that would have loved the opportunity.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,HmmmNol,2,Sat Mar 21 14:50:09 2015 UTC,I found this strange but I'm not worried.  She studied acting in University and she did really well on SNL.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,Infersader,6,Sat Mar 21 18:16:42 2015 UTC,Given that Jessica Lange is gone he probably invited Lady gaga on for the extra attention...and the musicals...
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,maikelg,2,Sat Mar 21 23:14:40 2015 UTC,Oh my god.. You're right. This could possibly mean more musical numbers and am not sure I like that idea.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,HmmmNol,3,Mon Mar 23 17:20:33 2015 UTC,"He's already stated that there won't be musicals this season.  Musicals were in season 4 because it was about a performing Freak Show.    IMO they could/probably will throw one in, but itll make sense to do so (similar to the Name Game)."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,Infersader,5,Sat Mar 21 23:12:28 2015 UTC,In what world do people go to a Freak Show and expect a musical performance?
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,Lindsay_Blowhim,3,Sun Mar 22 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"Well, you can't expect the ""Freaks"" to just know how to do well on stage. But you can fake them playing music.   That's the reason I think, they had the musical numbers. Just so that the Freaks will be able to do something on stage."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,rdxxy,2,Mon Mar 23 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"She'll either be really good, or completely suck imo"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,atson,4,Mon Mar 23 17:31:22 2015 UTC,The fact that he's never actually seen her in any of the few roles she's played is odd. kinda seems like he's just trying to get the younger audience back from Coven.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zrdb4,maikelg,4,Mon Mar 23 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"Here's hoping she gets crushed by an elevator within the first five minutes. Everybody gets their publicity, and we'll never hear from her again.  Edit: Calm down people, I don't mean she should be crushed for real, it's just television, it's make believe. But anybody who thinks this isn't a publicity stunt is incredibly naive. I think we all know Lady Gaga and AHS could both use a little boost."

AmericanHorrorStory,2zmfux,agentbueller,11,Thu Mar 19 23:26:13 2015 UTC,Season two was my favourite season but I think the ending was the weakest part of it. I kinda wish we would've stuck to one timeline.

AmericanHorrorStory,2zmfux,javiayer,2,Fri Mar 20 02:12:16 2015 UTC,Ah that was really well done. I thought you meant a twist like who ended up being the supreme in season 3

AmericanHorrorStory,2zmfux,IamLegba,4,Fri Mar 20 02:07:26 2015 UTC,"I've found every season finale apart from the first to be quite weak. The problem is they need to keep the tension going by creating new mysteries each week, so by the time the season ends they don't have time to wrap everything up satisfactorily. Some things seem to just get forgotten completely. It's really noticeable if you binge-watch a series."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zmfux,lovewd,2,Fri Mar 20 11:11:57 2015 UTC,... unless you're Sarah Paulson.

AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,I_am_Norwegian,8,Fri Mar 20 07:48:17 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I'm a lover of all things magical - so naturally I was ecstatic about Coven. So I started watching it, and I think I got to the third/fourth episode (around the time Misty was introduced) and I hated it. Left it for ages, then one day I just sat down and finished the whole season; it really picked up and I was like dayum this is good.  Season 4, started of the same for me I didn't like it. This time, however, I thought I should stick it out because it took a few episodes to get into Coven. But it didn't get better. At all. I was so disappointed.   I think I've come to a conclusion that when I'm intrigued/excited by the theme of the series/season, I have expectations and they just are not met. The story line for Freak Show was just poop and I was happy it was over.   My favourite seasons in order are 2, 1 and then 3. 4 doesn't make it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,x-l-v,5,Sat Mar 21 11:02:06 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with Freakshow is that none of the characters seemed essential to the plot. There are always plotlines in AHS that can be taken out of the season and it won't really affect the outcome of the storyline. But Freakshow seemed to be one pointless end after another. Twisty, NPH, Dell, the freaks themselves... it just seemed pointless and I felt cheated. It could also be one of those seasons that you just need to binge watch. I think if you tried Coven again and binge it, you might change your mind. I found myself frustrated with Freakshow because there didn't seem to be much of a draw to bring me back to watch the next week, but I did because I kept hoping for something spectacular."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,awkwardskribble,5,Mon Mar 23 06:38:46 2015 UTC,"I personally liked Coven more.  To me it seemed like they tried to get back into horror taking the prominence once again, but still not getting away from the drama-centered/""campy"" feel of Coven."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,baileath,11,Sat Mar 21 03:40:03 2015 UTC,"I think it is; however, I loved Freak Show almost as much as Asylum right up until the last episode, which nearly ruined the whole season for me.  I hated how Freak Show ended."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,grumblebuzz,4,Fri Mar 20 15:03:18 2015 UTC,It's ironic bc most of the fandom is exactly the opposite
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,israeldmo,9,Fri Mar 20 18:24:44 2015 UTC,"In my opinion? Yes. One of the strongest seasons of AHS, for sure. But hey, I loved Coven. Watch some episodes. If you don't like it, don't worry, TV is full of great shows right now. :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,mtwestbr,7,Fri Mar 20 09:00:04 2015 UTC,I did not finish season 3.  Liked it but it did not keep my coming back the way 4 did.  Four is a dandy of a season in my opinion.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,Wheatiez,6,Fri Mar 20 20:22:05 2015 UTC,four is a dandy   Heh
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,doomsday1216,17,Fri Mar 20 20:52:11 2015 UTC,"Listen. I gotta be honest here. I absolutely hated it. The entire season was so OBVIOUSLY lange-centric, there were so many musical numbers, elsa mars just feels like they ran out of new character traits and combined lange's characters from seasons 1-3. I'm fine with her being the center of attention but seriously, she doesn't even have a good singing voice and by the second musical number I was absolutely done. The character is just so obvious and archetypal. Nothing interesting or new about her. In season 1 as we're learning a lot about the house we also learn a lot about her, in season 2 obviously our opinion of sister jude fluctuates. Even in season 3 the way we view the supreme changes as things are revealed about other characters. Elsa Mars is boring and obnoxious in my opinion.  It had much less of the ""oh man that's so gross I can't handle it"" and general unexpected twists than the other three seasons, in my opinion. I was disinterested in 3 but actively dislike season 4. Just felt forced and very little of it felt scary at all, in any sense of the word.  And in reference to the music/cinematography, nothing special.  This doesn't mean you're going to dislike it as well, this is just how i felt."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,mtwestbr,5,Fri Mar 20 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with the entire post, but agree 110% that one musical number was fine but after that there was no rocking, just eye rolling.  Would have much rather seen other parts of the story that got short changed expanded on."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,doomsday1216,1 point,Fri Mar 20 20:26:12 2015 UTC,"Totally! I realize many don't share my dislike for the season, but I'm glad we can find a middle ground in that we weren't looking for a musical horror fest.   So true, so many stories could have used that time so much more effectively....."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,psyko-byte,5,Fri Mar 20 20:31:25 2015 UTC,"Personally, Coven's better than Freak Show. Despite the messy plot, it was still entertaining to watch unlike Freak Show. It was just hit and miss after the Halloween arc."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,noel-13,14,Tue Mar 24 16:15:08 2015 UTC,After the Halloween episodes it just went downhill for me. The final 2 episodes were somewhat redeeming though.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,jonjawnjahnsss,6,Fri Mar 20 12:13:10 2015 UTC,"Season 3 was my favorite season. It was the only one I purchased. All of them are great in my opinion, I've seen them all at least twice but Coven really appealed to me. I'm probably on my own here."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,awkwardskribble,8,Sat Mar 21 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"Season three is my favorite, too. I don't understand all the hate. I will admit that I stopped watching a few episodes in because of life getting in the way, but I binged watched it just before Freakshow was going to start and I absolutely fell in love with it. It is the only season I've watched multiple times and I have a Myrtle Snow Funko Pop doll. You're not on your own."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,jonjawnjahnsss,-5,Mon Mar 23 06:34:33 2015 UTC,"How could you like season three? So many plotlines that don't go anywhere. All of the weird ""girl-power"" and evil witch-hunter men that only worship money, but still want to hunt witches for some reason. I don't remember much of that season though, it wasn't very memorable. It was more ""We're a group of teenage girls, and also witches!"" than it was horror."

Watch the first episode, see how you feel. If your gut says keep going, do it, if it says 'oh god no turn it off' do that.   (For me personally, I loved Coven, and hated Freak Show. But you have every chance of feeling the exact opposite, and no reason to miss out on TV you might adore)."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,Henry_Burris,7,Tue Mar 24 17:36:53 2015 UTC,Lots of people hate season four but I absolutely loved it. It is my favorite season. It was very scary and mysterious. Freak Show really reminded me of Asylum in so many ways.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,bwood16,4,Fri Mar 20 10:07:05 2015 UTC,"I loved Coven more because I love magic and witchcraft. I also felt that the characters were a bit more flushed all around where Freak Show only flushed a few, but hey thats my opinion.  Freak Show was not bad, i have never not liked a season yet, just some more then others. I will say that Freak Show had more ""horror"" in the horror story, Coven felt a bit campy sometimes, especially cause every third word was  either ""supreme"" or ""bitch""    My list of preference from greatest to least: Coven: Asylum, and Freak Show and Murder House tie for third. But in all i would rate none of the seasons below a 6/10 on any scale.   This is all my opinion and welcome constrictive criticism."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,CanEHdianBuddaay,6,Sat Mar 21 02:51:16 2015 UTC,"I was absolutely into it as it was going on, and think, on it's own, it's actually pretty good, but season 3 was too ""light hearted"" (if that makes sense) comparatively speaking. I think i enjoyed it better than Freak Show, but probably only because of the music and some inconsistencies (the blackmail orgy in the first episode, but after that, the freaks never acted in such a way)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,isabell_lovely,2,Fri Mar 20 13:05:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, overall Freakshow is better than Coven. If for no other reason, Freakshow is better because of Twisty, Bette &Dot and Dandy. Dandy made the season completely worth watching for me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zog79,psyko-byte,2,Sat Mar 21 21:27:00 2015 UTC,I stopped watching freak show at episode 7 (forgot why haha) but up until that I thought the show was pretty solid. All of the characters you mentioned were awesome I thought and really made the season ( especially dande) the edward mordrake episodes were probably my 2 favorite episodes of all of AHS. Can't wait to start watchin again .

All the seasons kinda fizzle out in the end, but three was just ugh. 4 starts out good and has so much potential, and it fizzles out faster than I recall any other seasons fizzling out. It just stops making any kind of sense. There's hardly an overarching plot. 1>2>4>3 And I only really think the first two seasons are good.   edit: Honestly just remembered the whole  SEASON TWO SPOILER:   alien thing in season 2. I think it's safe to say season 1 was way better than season 2."

AmericanHorrorStory,2znqim,weavves,4,Fri Mar 20 13:01:27 2015 UTC,"Evan Peters might work for a David Koresh type, just obfuscate it enough by not basing it on the whole big Waco siege in '93 but on the earlier power plays against the older preordained cult leader (maybe played by Denis O'Hare?) who had mainline support in the cult.   But then everybody is a bad guy, and you're rooting for truly despicable characters, which could raise some eyebrows."

AmericanHorrorStory,2znqim,Titdick_McAnusbutts,5,Fri Mar 20 02:42:37 2015 UTC,"I think the black dahlia was my favorite use of a historical figure, but that's probably because of the mass amount of mystery around the actual case."

I'm hoping for a season either centered around the civil war, or that takes place in the early 19th century during a lot of the Indian wars and associated atrocities. War is one horrific aspect not yet touched upon by the series."

AmericanHorrorStory,2zngw5,JsDJssMrtnz,7,Fri Mar 20 01:15:01 2015 UTC,Best pilot - Freak Show  Best Finale - Asylum
AmericanHorrorStory,2zngw5,whokilledmurph,17,Fri Mar 20 06:41:12 2015 UTC,"I think the best pilot would be Bitchcraft, from Coven. I think that it did a really good job at introducing the audience to the world of witchcraft, and setting up the ""rules"" of that universe.  The best finale in my opinion would be Madness Ends, from Asylum. Mostly because I view Asylum through rose-tinted glasses, but I think how expansive it was and how it tied up all the loose ends was perfect."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zngw5,davis98,20,Fri Mar 20 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"Let's break it down.  Finale- I would consider the worst to be coven. It's finale left loose ends open, and created new plotholes. And I thought it was way too happy.  I would put murder house next. There was a lot I liked about it, but I thought it was pretty dramatic and cheesy overall. Asylum is next. Pretty great job of concluding things. No real complaints here. Freakshow was my favorite finale. This season had a few shaky episodes in the middle, but the last few episodes were great. The finale was dark, twisted, and did a great job of bringing AHS back to its roots.  Pilot- Again, I will start with the worst. I thought Freakshow's pilot focused too much attention to Bette and Dot. I like the characters, but they were absent for a lot of the season. I think it should have focused more of the Freakshow itself. Second to that is Murder House. I don't think it did a great job of representing the rest of the season. I didn't enjoy the show until it's amazing second episode. Next would be Asylum. Again, no real complaints. I wasn't a fan of Kit's story in the beginning, however. It grew on me later. I think Coven had the best pilot. It introduced likeable characters and an interesting plot. It differentiated itself from the previous seasons and had its own unique vibe."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zngw5,bwood16,3,Fri Mar 20 01:22:54 2015 UTC,"Oh this is tough! The pilot episode of each season was so good in its own way. I think the best pilot was Coven (which is interesting because overall it was my least favorite season), followed by Freakshow (Twisty!), then Murder House, then Asylum (which is my favorite season, but it got so much better towards the middle/end.)   For finales- First place is Asylum, then Muder House, then Freakshow and lastly Coven. I felt Coven's finales was good but a little underwhelming and messy."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zngw5,israeldmo,5,Fri Mar 20 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"Best Pilot: Monsters Among Us. Bitchcraft is a close second.  Best Finale: Madness Ends. Wow, just wow."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zngw5,OhDear3,2,Fri Mar 20 08:42:28 2015 UTC,"Actually I think Freak Show had both the best pilot and finale, it might have got a bit slow in the middle, but the last couple of episodes were awesome."

Elsa's making it big in Hollywood and still hating herself was boring and Dandy shooting up the Freakshow showed that his character hadn't developed beyond being a psychopath)"

It had it all, great atomosphere, fleshed out back story, brought hightlight to one of the best characters of the series (dande)had some great tension and genuine horror. just overall they were both really great episodes. Its also great that Wes Bentley is joining the next season as he really is a great actor and has a ton of potential for the series, he also made Mordrake a fairly compelling character imo."

Tl;dr Maybe this vision was more of a metaphorical one to give a little more mystery to the storie-line, but I think it was meant to be a real vision and not some power change"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zlcv7,Musain,4,Thu Mar 19 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"It puts things in a new and interesting perspective, but I hope they didn't include it just for that.

AmericanHorrorStory,2zlcv7,Musain,5,Fri Mar 20 02:27:24 2015 UTC,"I think it served the purpose of showing Fiona's true intentions in a gruesome way and in a way empowered Cordelia a little bit more, after all, they were having a bonding moment right up until the vision, showing that when the current supreme has a weaker moment, the next supreme suddenly has an important power boost. I think Coven had many plot issues but I really enjoyed this part"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zlcv7,IamLegba,3,Fri Mar 20 03:15:32 2015 UTC,"I thought the scene was really cool too, but I would have preferred consistency over one touching moment. Two sides to every coin I guess."

AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,israeldmo,3,Thu Mar 19 06:45:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, don't be to bothered by it it happens a lot.  Legend of Korra Season 3 was bombed with low ratings like sometime after the finale aired even though the season was fantastic. One of the seasons of The Shield has every episode sitting ~5 due to apparently someone sabotaging it.  Then you have other shows where each episode is rated ridiculously higher than it deserves.  Overall user scores really aren't something to take seriously most of the time, especially when it comes to sites like imdb and metacritic."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,Rytlock,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, true. Season 4 of The Sopranos received a lot of 7.0 ratings and Whitecaps, one of the strongest episode of the show, got a mediocre 5.5 rating."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,S31A,5,Fri Mar 20 07:54:08 2015 UTC,"Those scores aren't that bad, and often this show doesn't deserve 10/10s. It's a very good show, but it does lack tact a lot of times so I think that turns many people off. Take a show like the walking dead, which lately utilizes lots of strong pacing, foreshadowing, symbolism, and realistic characters. Now take some episodes of AHS which have a lot more crazy situations, shock value, less realism. Some episodes (orphans!!!) are worthy of 10/10 but not all."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,wish_to_conquer_pain,3,Thu Mar 19 12:24:30 2015 UTC,"How is Orphans worthy of a 10/10? It's a filler episode about a minor character who no one would care about if they hadn't watched Asylum. It uses cheap tricks to drag emotional reactions out of the viewer, and relies on viewer attachment to Asylum to seem worthwhile."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,monkeysrule123,2,Thu Mar 19 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I never understood the point pf orphans. Besides the very end(which in all honesty was not that important) nothing happened. Its just pepper screaming for half the episode about salty( a character who we knew nothing about and died literally  out of nowhere). I never understood the obsession with pepper. She did nothing all of freakshow. All that happened was she went to briarcliff. I dont feel bad for her because her entire backstory is told in 5 minutes and before that, we knew barely anything about her. Its not like they kept pepper a mystery and made us wonder who she really was, they never even used her."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,wish_to_conquer_pain,3,Thu Mar 19 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and to never use her or Salty throughout Freak Show and then suddenly reveal that they were married and in love and Ma Petite was their pseudo-baby was just downright insulting and offensive."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,monkeysrule123,1 point,Fri Mar 20 00:09:11 2015 UTC,"I thought i missed something about salty dying. Nope. He just dies out of nowhere. Everyone was talking About how they cried when they learned about peppers life but it was jist a filler episode. It spoils the ending that elsa becomes a tv star. It was really a pointless episode and was only there to show us how the seasons were ""connected""."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,wish_to_conquer_pain,2,Fri Mar 20 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"It was doubly pointless because we already knew how Pepper ended up in Briarcliff.  We didn't need it to connect shit, because if the same character is in both seasons, obviously those seasons are connected.  They could have just invented some other reason for Elsa to take Pepper to live with her sister, and left it at that, leaving us with the knowledge of what will come.    But no, we had to see Mary Eunice again.    Don't get me wrong, I love Mary Eunice, but that was a waste of a cameo."

Then we find out fucking elsa will be a star. Other then the whole freak heaven and the deaths, we practically knew the ending. I guessed the Mordrake return weeks before"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,S31A,2,Fri Mar 20 01:18:22 2015 UTC,It's very well written and paced. OTher episodes may relate more to the central plot of freak show but Orphans had the best emotional appeal and dialogue.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,wish_to_conquer_pain,2,Fri Mar 20 01:25:58 2015 UTC,"Orphans had emotional manipulation.  ""Let's take these characters even we didn't care about last episode, kill one, and spend the rest of the episode trying to make people care about this one.""  I agree that it's well-written in spite of that, and the dialogue is good.  I just really wish the writers put the effort they put into this episode into the Freak Show episodes that actually mattered."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zk7xl,davis98,2,Fri Mar 20 01:41:00 2015 UTC,Orphans is mostly appealing to people who were already fans of Asylum.

I mean honestly though, did Freak Show even have a point, other than ""let's find the most depraved thing we can show on cable"".  I love AHS and all, but last season was a giant mess.  It had so much potential, but they just threw it away with messy plotlines and characters no one cares about."

I've only seen they trying too hard to be complex (something they've been doing since it started), let alone the uneven pacing. I mean, they wasted a lot of episodes to reflect about nothing in particular. At least, these recent episodes in Alexandria have been great and much better than almost everything that came before (a sad realization, it really had potential).   no one cares about   I cared."

AmericanHorrorStory,2zjnt0,ynmsgames,2,Fri Mar 20 02:14:52 2015 UTC,"I assume now that she's Supreme, Cordelia could have a baby...if she wanted to.  I think she's moved beyond that now, however, especially when we look at how many new girls have come to the coven.  Since Fiona left behind a terrible legacy as the Supreme, Cordelia is probably going to work double-time to wipe out all the damage.  She's basically re-establishing the coven as a place of learning, as well as handling the public side of things now that the witches have ""come out of the cauldron.""  If she were to have a child, I can't say whether or not it would be the next Supreme.  There isn't much in the show about how the position of Supreme passes, other than the fact that the title is inherited upon the predecessor's death.  Quentin is the only male witch/warlock in the entire show, so we have no idea if there's a separate organization for male witches or if Quentin is just a supernatural rarity.  Depending how rare male witches are and if Cordelia slept with someone magic or mortal, a son probably wouldn't be the future Supreme.  If Cordelia's hypothetical child is a girl, there's still no guarantee she would be the next Supreme.  After all, Fiona inherited the position of Supreme from Anna Leigh Leighton, someone she wasn't related to at all."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zjnt0,signu1230,2,Sat Mar 21 19:08:47 2015 UTC,the one thing that bothered me about that ending was that queenie was able to come back from the dead and bring back misty but she couldn't do Zoe in the 7 wonders? the only closure i have is cordilia saying 'you either are a supreme or you're not' so is that why she couldn't do it during the 7 wonders?
AmericanHorrorStory,2zjnt0,mittensquish,4,Thu Mar 19 15:09:13 2015 UTC,"Cordelia says in one of the final episodes that witches' powers spike when they're in danger, which is one of the reasons (besides Cordelia's powers manifesting in others because they can't manifest through her) the girls get new powers they might not be able to use again.  I'm guessing in that instance, Cordelia's powers manifested through Queenie, but for some reason chose not to do so through her again when Zoe was in trouble."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zjnt0,OjamaKnight,1 point,Sun Mar 22 17:04:05 2015 UTC,That's assuming she had any fertility problems to begin with. Did the doctor ever say it was her? It could have been Hank who was infertile.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zjnt0,pastacelli,-10,Tue Mar 24 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"Well first, Cordelia got her sight back from Myrtle not from the wonders.   She is probably fertile now she has embraced her supremacy.  As for her child, who knows, and it doesn't matter. At all."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zjnt0,Glizzard,8,Thu Mar 19 04:42:40 2015 UTC,"So in the last episode,  after she brought zoe back and she collapsed on the floor,  she stands up and her vision had been restored (again),  that was myrtle?   Really?   Are you sure?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zjnt0,Lecter07,5,Thu Mar 19 11:31:04 2015 UTC,"No, this jackrabbit is loony.   Cordelia's sight was restored when she accepted herself as the Supreme. It is likely that she can now have children. However, I don't know if she would. It has to be VERY hard being clairvoyant like the Supreme is, and therefor having a relationship with someone would be impossible. Everyone deserves to keep secrets, and with someone like her, there would be absolutely none. I can't see her following in the footsteps of her mother, running around with strapping young men and getting pregnant. Maybe she'd hire someone, or just use her powers to coerce someone.   I'm a firm believer that Coven would have fared better with a sequel season."

AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,ilzr,8,Tue Mar 17 20:33:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, and Sarah Paulson having nearly identical endings to seasons 2 & 3. I also have a feeling the guy who played Dandy will be naked half the time (women deserve eye candy too, but holy shit)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,Henry_Burris,18,Tue Mar 17 22:10:38 2015 UTC,"That's your opinion, but to me (and many others) she was the face of American Horror Story. She simply can't be replaced."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,doomsday1216,13,Tue Mar 17 20:18:47 2015 UTC,"I felt much more positively towards her before season 4. Season 4 was so obviously built around her, and the volume of musical numbers alone began to leave me with a sour taste in my mouth. It was just one rehash too many. I wouldn't mind seeing her again, but they gotta take a rest with Langeomania."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,Big_Pan_Pan,8,Tue Mar 17 21:30:41 2015 UTC,"Freak Show flopped majorly, especially after all the hype they built around it (calling it the scariest season ever and crap). It's definitely my least favorite, down there with Murder House. But the final episode of Freak Show was phenomenal to me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,primetimemime,2,Tue Mar 17 22:11:24 2015 UTC,Not a fan of Murder House? Can I ask why? I loved seasons one and two almost equally. They actually lived up to the title of the series. Seasons 3 and 4 were goddamn jokes. I only finished four because I had invested so much time into the series. I don't have high hopes for 5.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,lepride,3,Tue Mar 17 23:17:58 2015 UTC,"Story wise, Murder House and Asylum were the definition of perfection. Still, I'm not the biggest fan of Murder House and I don't know why. Coven and Freak Show really disappointed me (I had such high expectations for them. ESPECIALLY COVEN). I think I'm just a sucker for a show about witches :D   1-Asylum  2-Murder House and Coven  and then there's Freak Show..."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,RestrictedAxcess,7,Tue Mar 17 23:26:54 2015 UTC,I've already come to terms with the fact that they'll never top asylum.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,The_R4ke,3,Wed Mar 18 00:08:36 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way but about Murder House. That one felt the scariest to me, simply cause it seemed the most real. Moving into a new house because of a bad financial situation? That could happen to me...  Plus I connected to the characters in that one more than any of the others... Tate's still a good guy to me damn it!"

I had such high expectations, but I feel like they tried to do too many different things. I think the basic concept of Possession / Mad Nazi Scientist / Serial Killer (&Son) was enough to sustain a season. I feel like Aliens would have been better left for it's own season, since there's a ton of material there."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,ohwowcanyounot,1 point,Wed Mar 18 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I dunno. I liked all of the storylines in Asylum. The aliens thing was very well done in my opinion, but I'm SURE aliens will get their own season sooner or later because... why not? :D And even though Asylum had tons of storylines, I felt like they were all executed pretty nicely, unlike Coven and Freak Show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,beholdtheheart,0,Wed Mar 18 18:04:01 2015 UTC,"Oh god, did they seriously try to hype up season 4 as the scariest? ...HOW?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,ohwowcanyounot,0,Wed Mar 18 04:52:27 2015 UTC,There's this thing called differing opinions. It is quite possible that for some their opinion on what is scary differs from yours.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,beholdtheheart,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:18:22 2015 UTC,"No shit?  That doesn't mean that it isn't a popular opinion that Freak Show was a pretty big departure from the ""horror"" genre that AHS was originally known for (from the first couple of seasons). The majority of people I've spoken to, critics I've read, and posts I've seen on this subreddit have leaned toward that opinion.  I tend to avoid the ""hype train"" for upcoming seasons, as I try not to read too much about them, and I don't have cable (so no commercials or anything of that sort). But if I had heard hype about Freak Show being the ""scariest"" season before watching it, I would've been pretty damn disappointed.  That being said, I have zero problems with differing opinions. My favorite season is Murder House, and I'm well aware that many people dislike that one, and it's some people's least favorite.  My personal opinion of Freak Show is that Twisty, Dandy, and Chester just didn't do it for me ""scary"" wise as much as, say, Bloodyface. Twisty left too early to leave much of an effect on me, and I found many of Dandy's actions to be predictable once I knew his character well enough. I thought that Chester was the creepiest of the three, but he honestly wasn't that integral to the story-- his character felt more like an afterthought, imo.  I'd still be curious to hear from people who feel differently. Hence the ""how?"" from my previous comment."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,doomsday1216,1 point,Wed Mar 18 14:47:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't know how, nor does the how matter people don't have to explain why they feel a certain way. And you phrased your question in such a way that it was condemning in it's approach.   Oh god, did they seriously try to hype up season 4 as the scariest?   Yeah they did seriously do that - to which my question to you is do you seriously find it surprising that people can have an opinion that is contrary to the one that is ""popular"".   It's kind of how you delicately put it. No shit - welcome to the real world where not everyone sees things eye to eye."

If I saw someone comment that they thought Freak Show was the scariest season, I'd still respond along the lines of ""whaaaat, seriously!?"" That doesn't mean I'd make fun of them for feeling that way, or that I'd be disinterested in hearing why, or that I somehow believe that my opinion is the only correct one just because it's popular.

To me, they way it was read in my mind - your question was laced with disdain for someone's opinion opposite of yours.   ""I was pretty damn surprised that the season was apparently marketed as ""the scariest season."" ""  Well that is your opinion and you are entitled to it. But for some people apparently this season was scary - and their opinion is just as valid as yours.    ""From an advertising standpoint, that's just super weird to me, and sounds like it was a pretty bad move imo.""  Well it was never their marketing strategy. The term scariest was simply a response given to questions directed at those involved. The comments reflected the actors experiences on set -which in person, may have been the scariest thing yet for them. They had no idea, when making those comments, what the final product would look like."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,beholdtheheart,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:50:25 2015 UTC,Do you know anyone whose opinion is that season 4 was the scariest?
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,silverse,1 point,Fri Mar 20 16:36:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do actually. Quite a few of my friends - and there have been redditors in this sub who have claimed such.

If you're able to respond without assuming a bunch of retarded shit, that'd be great.  I didn't assume anything - the word ""If"" from my prior rebuttal is the operative word. I was simply being preemptive - there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.   and my asking that question was ""somewhat based on a mistaken belief?  Do you struggle with reading comprehension? When did I say you had a mistaken belief? One I never claimed that and two, again, the operative word is ""if"" which means I was not speaking in absolutes and pigeonholing your intent I was simply extrapolating on what you could possibly be aiming at.

Not me.   what mistaken belief? you assumed that I was expecting you to say ""no"" and use that as a point in some argument about our opinions, but that wasn't the case, because arguing about whose opinion is the best is very stupid!  On the contrary, the only stupid thing here is that you have misunderstood my rebuttal to you and have, ironically, gone on the defensive. I never assumed anything.   Nor have I ever claimed one's opinion, such as my own, is better than someone else. Not even once. What we have established is that you are only good at putting words in my mouth and are incapable of refuting them as they stand, undistorted.   I was trying to participate in this as a discussion.

AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,ThatDirehit,0,Tue Mar 17 18:58:46 2015 UTC,I agree with you completely.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,ThatDirehit,8,Tue Mar 17 20:19:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The notion that she is being replaced relies on the premise that the show revolves around her. There are so many other great actors - and the Diva worship of jessica lange, for me at least, has got in the way of the writing for the seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,ThatDirehit,-1,Tue Mar 17 20:22:14 2015 UTC,Disagree. She brought something to AHS that no else can.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,abot1,3,Wed Mar 18 04:31:23 2015 UTC,"No she really didn't. She brought to the table what every other great actress would bring. commitment to her characters, charisma, and conviction.   Many actresses have this ability - not just Jessica Lange."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,beholdtheheart,-2,Wed Mar 18 12:12:59 2015 UTC,You think any other actress could have played her parts and it would still be the same? I don't think so.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,rdxxy,2,Wed Mar 18 14:13:57 2015 UTC,Yes I do. That is what acting is meant to do.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,lovewd,-2,Wed Mar 18 16:11:05 2015 UTC,Well then you don't know much about acting...or logic.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,jacobneiswender,2,Wed Mar 18 18:51:05 2015 UTC,I know more than you apparently since you seem to be unable to differentiate  your obsession with an actress from reality.   That's logic. Try it sometime.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,jacobneiswender,-1,Wed Mar 18 19:53:51 2015 UTC,I'm not obsessed. But what you are saying is basically every actress is the same. It's moronic.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,jacobneiswender,5,Wed Mar 18 20:00:05 2015 UTC,No that's actually not what I am saying.  Try rereading my post but using this skill that is obscure to you - it's called comprehension.   What you are saying is that only one actress can carry a character in the typical manner that any good actress should be able to do.   That is moronic. That is your obsession talking. Totally void of logic.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,Zinthaniel,-2,Wed Mar 18 20:08:25 2015 UTC,"Actually it is, because I said ""You think any other actress could have played her parts and it would still be the same?"" to which you answered YES.

AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,Bears54,4,Tue Mar 17 20:26:58 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure she can be replaced. There is a long list of beautiful actresses who can act just as good if not better than Jessica Lange. I never viewed this show as being about her - though as it went on it became apparent that every season was being written to idolize her characters. I didn't like it though. Diva worship is a succubus on good writing. I have always been a fan of AHS as a series and show not just the actors therein.
AmericanHorrorStory,2zdghq,everythingispancakes,5,Tue Mar 17 20:31:16 2015 UTC,I think it'll be nice having a replacement. Having the same type of character every season gets stale

AmericanHorrorStory,2zgw4d,ThatDirehit,5,Wed Mar 18 14:31:03 2015 UTC,"No one is ""Hating"" Jessica Lange. What people are doing is rejecting the notion that She made the show what is and it needs her to survive. Also rejecting the notion that she is the only actress that has deep wells of emotions and range. Any good actress can do what Lange has done. Lange is a great actress and woman but she is not the only actress that is great.   I believe some fans are annoyed with the so called fans who claim that they will stop viewing the show once she is gone - to me at least that establishes that they where never really a fan of the show but rather a fan of one of it's actresses and nothing else.   The show is so much more than just Jessica Lange - and it has so many other great actresses and actors who have managed to do the exact same thing she has done every season.

We don't have many leading characters in television, especially in a show that I love as much as AHS. More representation is a fantastic thing."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Titdick_McAnusbutts,20,Mon Mar 16 17:45:06 2015 UTC,"This is so awesome. I'm gay and the fact Ryan always manages to represent the community, always makes me happy. I've seen a few people complain about it and how ""why's there always have to be a gay character?"" but it's always straight people who don't understand how awesome it is to have these rich complex lgbt characters represented on television.   The next season is gonna be amazing."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Titdick_McAnusbutts,9,Mon Mar 16 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And then people bring up the handful of gay couples that exist on television and be like ""SEE?! HERE'S YOUR GAYS STOP COMPLAINING!!"" and it's like... I'm sorry, there's hundreds (if not thousands) of television channels each with many different shows and at least 90% of all couples featured on these shows are straight. I have literally never seen a gay couple on television that I could relate to- two gay men who aren't the ""token gay"" ala Kurt on Glee (sorry Glee fans- nothing against this variety of gay as that would be silly and it's definitely important to represent this variety as well, but it just isn't relatable to gay men who aren't like that). Patrick & Chad were about as close as I could get, the couple from Murder House- but they were villains and not relatable in that way. I've had enough straight couples and feminine gay couples to last a lifetime and I'm hoping he can give us something fresh here!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Titdick_McAnusbutts,13,Mon Mar 16 21:41:49 2015 UTC,"Being a lesbian, it's nice to see a character like Lana Winters.  Season 2 was great to see because of the time period (when homosexuality was believed to be a psychiatric disorder).  It shows the history of what people had to go through.   I grew up in the 80's and 90's when there were no gay characters or if there were they were terrible examples or stereotypical characterizations. Then Ellen had her coming out episode and then Will & Grace, and then Queer As Folk.  But those were shows specifically ""for""  gays. Which was nice but at the same time kinda reinforced the idea we had to have our own shows.   American Horror Story is awesome because it features lgbt characters without the feeling of ""here look it's a gay person! Token gay person!"" Instead, they're just simply characters who happen to be gay. No big deal. It shouldn't be a big deal.   It's just mice to see the progression from absolutely no representation to bring represented not as a minority but just another rich character in a tapestry of characters."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,mrignatiusjreily,2,Mon Mar 16 22:06:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly! She wasn't defined as a lesbian but instead by her strength, perseverance and cunning.  She's one of my absolute favorite characters from the series."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,sapandsawdust,5,Mon Mar 16 22:35:55 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. However, as a bisexual, it upsets me that Ryan Murphy has yet to make a rich bisexual male character. He even seems prejudice against bi men, having Kurt proclaim there is no such thing as bisexual men. And the whole mess with Blaine being ""confused"" with his sexuality in season 2 of Glee was upsetting to watch. He gave us straight(Rachel, Finn, Ben),  gay(Santanna, Lana, Kurt), asexual(Misty) and transgendered characters(Unique). He apparently believes women can be bi with Brittany and Madison but not guys. I was hoping that Dell from Freak Show would have been bisexual, but that turned out to be another boring closeted gay man storyline. I just want some genuine male bisexual representation on one of Ryan's shows, since he is hailed a hero for the lgbt community. Seems like he forgot the ""b"" part even exists."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,UnBec,2,Mon Mar 16 23:02:17 2015 UTC,"Gosh, I really want more bisexual characters in everything- not just people saying, 'oh I just like hot people', or characters who are just 'confused' or 'barsexual' or 'curious'. It should be treated like an actual, concrete sexual orientation because it is, and we need representation, too."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Henry_Burris,7,Tue Mar 17 04:37:41 2015 UTC,"I read an article about how Lana's character arc is culturally groundbreaking because the horror genre forces the viewer to identify with the victim in order to be effective. People who might not otherwise be sympathetic to her plight as a lesbian are kind of coerced (in a way) into feeling allied with her by being afraid on her behalf.  In Asylum, her horrific experience is a direct result of her being gay, so as a viewer you kind of have to make your peace with that in order to understand why it's so terrifying for her."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Sideburnt,1 point,Wed Mar 18 07:14:56 2015 UTC,"Lana Winters is my favorite character of the series for exactly the reasons you listed.

AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,xsebs,-1,Tue Mar 17 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"I appreciate what you're saying and I don't doubt society has a way to go as far as representing the gay community on television. But saying that 90%of couples on the TV are straight is a pretty accurate portrayal. Also, TV rarely if ever shows heterosexual couples in an accurate light, because it's TV and TV is about large characters and drama."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Sideburnt,2,Wed Mar 18 12:51:52 2015 UTC,"Gay people will have a different vantage point than straight people (I don't know what your sexual identity is but I'm just saying). Most television couples are between a man and a woman and that is a fact. I've clearly not seen every television show but If I had to guess, the number of heterosexual couples shown on television since the beginning of time is probably in the high thousands, maybe even the tens of thousands. Think about every TV show you've ever seen- you can name the ""main"" couples but when you start including short character arcs as well, these numbers pile up. The number of gay/lesbian/trans couples ever shown on television is probably in the mid-high hundreds (when you're including minor character arcs as well). Again, this is just my approximation.  This list shows every LGBT character in television and radio. While it may be a long list, if you held it up to a list of straight characters in television, it would be like comparing a handful of pennies Harry Potter's Gringott's bank.  I think you meant ""a pretty inaccurate portrayal"" but I beg to differ. You may be thinking of television now, where ever other show has the token effeminate gay male. Television has been historically a lot more willing to show lesbian relationships and characters (which isn't surprising because lesbians are fetishized by the straight men that run these stations and companies so it's totally cool to see two pretty girls kissing, but until the last ten years or so there were far less gay or bisexual male characters on  television).  TV may not always show heterosexual couples in an accurate light, and I completely appreciate and understand that. However, I have personally never thought TV accurately portrayed a gay male couple that I've seen. I don't watch Logo or ""gay shows"" like Queer as Folk, and I know a lot of people love some of those shows and I'm sure that they have some good relationships shown. But I feel like I shouldn't have to watch a show focused on gay men, entirely comprised of a gay male cast, to see a gay male couple that are leading characters. A lot of times it feels like shows will have a gay male character just to have one and then they don't really do much with them. Maybe I just need to watch different television but simply more representation in popular or mainstream series would be nice, and that's all I'm really trying to say."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,xsebs,2,Tue Mar 17 17:24:40 2015 UTC,"token effeminate gay male.   Ugh, yes. The 'gay boyfriend' trope is so played out and ridiculous, as if gay men don't have anything better to do than be an accessory and cheerleader for a female lead."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Titdick_McAnusbutts,2,Tue Mar 17 18:38:23 2015 UTC,"Right? I will never forget, one time in high school this girl that sat in front of me in my American History class (whom I had spoken with before but we were far from friends, barely even acquaintances) found out I was gay and she was so excited like ""YES! I need someone to go shopping with, I really want a Nirvana tshirt!"" And I just gave her the emptiest stare.... bitch, I don't even like shopping for myself lol. Stereotypes are dumb."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,SamuraiFlamenco,0,Wed Mar 18 07:19:08 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just not seeing it. It's pretty different in the UK, being gay isn't portrayed as a fetish quite as much, so we get storylines that are handled pretty well and shows like Queer As Folk. I see what you mean I think, American TV its like everything's turned up a notch.   Really I think  that inaccurate portrayal of people on television is a current product of our times, it's not an exclusive problem.  Edit: I don't mean to say that shows need a storyline to include gay people."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Henry_Burris,1 point,Wed Mar 18 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"Although I disagree with you entirely, I'm just going to comment on one thing - the idea that straight characters are not accurately portrayed on TV shows due to the drama involved. Straight characters are portrayed as wise, dumb, strong, weak, stoic, emotional, leaders, followers, pilots, nurses, doctors, fathers, sisters, rich, homeless ... literally every characteristic of a human being has been portrayed by straight characters at some point or other. With minorities, on the other hand, it's almost like the producers come together and say, ""Because he's _, he should be/say/do _."" Examples - ""because she's black, she needs be the sassy, witty one!"" or ""because he's Asian, he's going to be the one that controls all of the gadgets and understands technology the most!"" or ""he's gay, so obviously he's going to have a ton of girl besties."" They're tropes that countless characters fall under that limit the variety of people we see on our screens, which does not happen (as much) when, say, a gay producer (Ryan Murphy for instance) decides to have a gay character on his/her show."

AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Adderex,7,Thu Mar 19 09:06:59 2015 UTC,Same way. I'm just glad to see them on the show. Cheyenne played a hilarious straight character on 30 Rock.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,madwithin,3,Thu Mar 19 14:04:06 2015 UTC,"God, Chester was so creepy. After the first episode he was in I was like 'eeehhh I'm not feeling this living doll thing' then after that second episode I was just so weirded out by Chester... gaaah just thinking about it gives me the creeps. NPH killed it (heh), his character was a great addition last year."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,annarchy8,1 point,Mon Mar 16 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"His performance in Gone Girl was absolutely jaw-dropping because it was so unlike anything I've ever seen him in. When he does creepy, it does it really well."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,al343806,-1,Mon Mar 16 19:03:58 2015 UTC,"I don't speak for everyone,  but it's not the fact that there are gay characters as much as the fact that the show seems to linger a bit too much on ""wow, they're different, feel sorry for them"". Lana's girlfriend was perfect in season 2. Either be outed and lose your job, or commit her. Absolutely heartbreaking.   Season 3 with the witches being persecuted, felt forced as hell, as the actual persecution happened very little. It was just ""be afraid, everyone hates you"", outside of 2 episodes and THEN they come out and the world accepts them. Okay?  As for homosexuality in this previous season, it was as overdone as ""Lobster boy sleeps with a lot of women"". We got it. This character is gay, so is this one, and that's fine. They did a piss poor job with the strong man, and it felt contrived, like it was thrown on just to have an angle to have him kill somebody. None of the freaks would have given a shit, anyway. And that's not even touching on the fact that the whole ""the world is out to get us"" mentality was more maddeningly inconsistent than season 3.   TL; DR, gay characters are fine, Ryan Murphy is just getting lazy with his writing. VERY LAZY"
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Zinthaniel,35,Mon Mar 16 22:32:15 2015 UTC,"Until Zachary Quinto comes back, it won't be that gay.  He has been my favorite of any AHS character I think."

AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,hotsauce_shivers,17,Mon Mar 16 23:27:32 2015 UTC,"I'm shocked that people are excited, this news is horrible. None of these people are notable for the horror genre. This show used to be about pushing the envelope and being absolutely horrifying. The last two seasons have been anything but. I'm incredibly disappointed in the show.   Note: this is simply MY opinion. Not saying the show is objectively bad, just subjectively bad from my view."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,spelling88,14,Mon Mar 16 23:38:38 2015 UTC,"Hey man, to each their own! Although I will say that just because someone isn't notable for the horror genre doesn't mean they won't succeed- Sarah Paulson and Lily Rabe didn't have noteworthy horror experience prior to AHS either :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,mansonfamily,4,Tue Mar 17 01:13:34 2015 UTC,"Aside from Kathy, Emma, and Zachery - there have been no notable actors from the horror genre.  The first season was compromised of actors not known for any work in horror.   Most Horror movies cast actors not known for their work in Horror.   I'm not following your logic. That's not even a hollywood tradition. An actor - acts - and they transform into what ever genre they are needed for."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,adamsandleryabish,3,Mon Mar 16 19:00:09 2015 UTC,Why does it matter what genre they're known for? A good actor can do any genre.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Henry_Burris,3,Mon Mar 16 22:07:43 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty impartial to the casting news since I don't really know much about either of the new actors,  but I definitely see what you're saying. I love all seasons in their own right.  But for me, the charm of season 1 was the horror factor and that charm has faded as the seasons have progressed. I'd love to see some more actors that are staples to the genre,  but other than Bates, have there really been any other actors that are notable due to their work in horror?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Henry_Burris,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:31:57 2015 UTC,Most of the actors on this show has never been associated with horror really. From Evan to Lily to Connie.  What are you talking to about?
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,Rastakate,13,Tue Mar 17 16:09:17 2015 UTC,Honestly I could care less what sexuality or nationality an actor was as long as their acting was good and the season was good.  They could hire a pansexual schizophrenic homophillic Asian woman priest and that wouldn't matter to me if she was a damn good actor.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,jacobneiswender,6,Tue Mar 17 06:22:15 2015 UTC,"Acting skills are definitely important. I sort of hope that Matt & Cheyenne are the young couple that will come to the hotel (even if that leaked info isn't true, I'd bet near anything that AHS will have a focus couple) because I guess that's what I meant in terms of representation- not only gay actors, but gay characters as well. Someone's sexuality definitely doesn't make or break them, it just makes it more relatable to me to have a gay male lead. We have had gay characters in each season (I think? Quentin is who I'm thinking of in Coven) but there has never been a gay couple that were both leads. I'd definitely like to see this route explored. Matt is a fantastic actor, and I don't really know Cheyenne but others seem to like him. Hopefully they get good roles :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,bwood16,3,Mon Mar 16 23:00:56 2015 UTC,"...there has been gay couples, actually. The reporter lady in season two that got trapped in asylum was blatantly lesbian, and she was a main character. And Evan Peter's dad in Freak show was closet gay, as well as one of the main bad guys (and those were big roles)."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,HaughtPockets,10,Tue Mar 17 04:46:18 2015 UTC,"I actually said gay couples where both were leads, and this would be the first inclusion that meets that criteria. I know that Chad & Patrick were in season one, but they weren't major characters. Lana & Wendy of course in season two, but Wendy was a plot device and had maybe 20 total minutes of screentime? That's including her corpse. Dell was a closeted homosexual and I enjoyed that storyline. Stanley's homosexuality wasn't very relevant, which is nice to see as well because being gay isn't a defining trait.  Compare these few inclusions to the following list of straight couples featured on AHS: Ben & Vivien, Constance & Larry, Constance & Travis, Ben & Hayden, Violet & Tate, Charles & Nora, Kit & Alma, Kit & Grace, Hank & Cordelia, Zoe & Kyle, Madison & Kyle, Fiona & Axeman, Nan & Luke, Dell & Desiree, Elsa & Massimo, Jimmy/Dot/Dandy/Bette, Paul & Penny. & that's just the ""main"" couples, there are many more.  So yeah, I'd say another gay couple that are both main characters would be nice."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,lovewd,4,Mon Mar 16 19:02:10 2015 UTC,"AHS has always appealed to gay actors- Sarah Paulson, Zachary Quinto, Denis O'Hare for example. I'm very excited about the additions of Matt Bomer and Wes Bentley. Never heard of Cheyenne Jackson (actually thought it was a woman) and not sure how i feel about Gaga. I hope you learned your lesson Ryan Murphy- please no musical numbers, thanks"
AmericanHorrorStory,2z8vfu,jwgarcia82,3,Mon Mar 16 20:38:50 2015 UTC,I didn't know who Jackson or Bomer were until I googled them... they're easy on the eyes.  I approve!
AmericanHorrorStory,2zeb8a,IamLegba,3,Tue Mar 17 21:34:16 2015 UTC,Couple questions.  Where did you see that Paulson said she loved her season 5 character? And where did you see that they are going to be filming in LA?
AmericanHorrorStory,2zeb8a,IamLegba,2,Tue Mar 17 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"Although Murphy previously teased E! Online that Paulson “really loves” her Season 5 character, it’s not official that the vet will be returning. She’s currently linked to another one of Murphy’s projects – “American Crime Story.” The fifth episode of AHS is set to return in October.  The entire season, which will be filmed in Los Angeles, will reportedly run for 13 episodes."
AmericanHorrorStory,2zeb8a,ImVotingForDukakis,6,Tue Mar 17 22:15:42 2015 UTC,"I think I'll be around,"" said Denis O'Hare, who seemed to be most confident of all the cast. ""I think I'll be in the sandbox. I don't know anything until I know it.""  Michael Chiklis admitted that show co-creator Ryan Murphy is an ""old friend"" and that he would definitely come back if he needed him.  ""Such a great cast, how could you say no to that,"" Chiklis added. ""I don't know. They're very, very quiet about these things!""  Finn Wittrock certainly made an impression as Dandy in Freak Show and he said he would be interested in exploring a new character if he came back.  ""No idea. I honestly don't know,"" he admitted, when asked if he would return. ""Maybe I'll find out tonight. I would definitely be interested.""  Evan Peters, who is the only male actor to appear in all four seasons so far, said that he would ""love to come back for another season,"" but he too could not say anything.  Sarah Paulson is set to star in another Murphy production this year called American Crime Story so she may be too busy with that to play a major character in Hotel. However, she would still like to be in AHS.  ""I am not at liberty to say. I wanna stay in the family absolutely,"" she said. ""Until Ryan Murphy makes certain things things I have nothing to say.""  Finally, legendary actress Kathy Bates said that nothing has been confirmed as far as her returning for Hotel.  ""Umm no. I can't tell you. I'm not confirmed,"" she said. ""I would always be interested 'cause I've had so much fun the last couple of years."""

AmericanHorrorStory,2z7zja,hawkedriot,2,Mon Mar 16 14:30:20 2015 UTC,Thank you! I know what I'll be doing when I get home from work! :D
AmericanHorrorStory,2z79ws,Mrowl7,7,Mon Mar 16 04:48:07 2015 UTC,"Though Andy is just a cameo in Freak Show, Matt Bomer's acting is phenomenal. It's great to have him on the show. Also, is Frances Conroy coming back? I didn't see her in the Paleyfest and I'm a little worried."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z79ws,blue7blur,5,Mon Mar 16 05:12:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if Franny passed on coming back this year.  She was kind of wasted in Freak Show.  The writers set Gloria up as this very uptight, repressed character with lots of outer layers and tons of potential, but then all she really ended up being was a companion piece to Dandy's character for a few episodes."

AmericanHorrorStory,2z76l4,Zinthaniel,5,Mon Mar 16 04:11:48 2015 UTC,Tbh I'm kinda mad that no one confirmed if they were coming back or not...
AmericanHorrorStory,2z76l4,TommySovereign,0,Mon Mar 16 05:07:18 2015 UTC,I am too tbh. But part of me feels like no one knows if anyone is coming back. Like how Jessica and Kathy were describing changing the scene as they were filming it. Like it feels like a very work in progress thing. Like oh you're the lead just kidding you're DVD extras that's showbiz.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z76l4,jonjawnjahnsss,3,Mon Mar 16 06:46:57 2015 UTC,Sarah Paulson endorses this message!
AmericanHorrorStory,2z76l4,jonjawnjahnsss,3,Mon Mar 16 04:22:23 2015 UTC,This moderator is sub par
AmericanHorrorStory,2z76l4,brthmrk,3,Mon Mar 16 04:49:55 2015 UTC,I want to like formally thank you for posting this. I'm sure if I was on here more I would have seen it. I've never heard of Paleyfest before. And the AHS panel was simply amazing! And I saw the Glee panel for their last time and I know that's whatever here but RM is amazing and it was right before the series finale premieres Friday and I'm just emotional like that girl in mean girls and I just wish we could go back to when we were in middle school.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z76l4,jonjawnjahnsss,2,Mon Mar 16 06:44:12 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Paulson and Lange are drunk. o_o

AmericanHorrorStory,2z76l4,mikewoj,1 point,Mon Mar 16 09:14:53 2015 UTC,jessica lange just confirmed she is not coming back. Though it was a very elongated explanation.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z76l4,Snork_Nork,2,Mon Mar 16 04:40:52 2015 UTC,Oh and Matt Bomer has just been confirmed to be the star of AHS hotel
AmericanHorrorStory,2z76l4,girlsjiggle,1 point,Mon Mar 16 04:41:51 2015 UTC,Was anyone else underwhelmed? I think the panel sufferred by not having Ryan Murphy there. I actually cringed at some of the producer Tim's answers. He wouldn't even confirm that it was titled Hotel which has already been anounced and seemed pretty condescending towards the audience members. I was just hoping for some new information on the upcoming season like at past Paleyfest panels. Oh well.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z76l4,mikewoj,2,Mon Mar 16 05:34:46 2015 UTC,well at least he did mention that Kathy's cover or Courtney Loves song (which wasn't mentioned by name) would be included in the dvd extras.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z7k97,israeldmo,8,Mon Mar 16 06:59:44 2015 UTC,"Honestly...that's it. Like bam you covered all the bases. They made a bunch of light-hearted jokes about Finn Wittrock not talking much ""Stop talking so much over there,"" etc. It was just really enjoyable. The most significant thing you missed I think was the various fan questions and being able to see Paulson and Lange be tispy.  Edit: also no one cared that Finn killed a bunch of people because if you killed Ma Petite you can't come back from that."
AmericanHorrorStory,2z7k97,jonjawnjahnsss,3,Mon Mar 16 07:08:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I'm gonna watch it when someone upload it on YouTube. Who was there?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2z7k97,jonjawnjahnsss,2,Mon Mar 16 07:36:38 2015 UTC,"Chiklas (horrible spelling error I refuse to look up), lange, Paulson, finn, bates, evan, O'Hare and some others I'm blanking on. Not everyone talked equally. It's definitely worth a watch!  Edit: someone on the team that wasn't RM. Forgive me for being the worst informant."

AmericanHorrorStory,2z7k97,Snork_Nork,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:04:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm actually really disappointed about that. She's everything to me.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z7k97,Snork_Nork,2,Mon Mar 16 20:16:15 2015 UTC,"lots of humor, laughter, ""wine is great"" added by Sarah Paulson. A few questions answering avoided. Tim Minear pretty much saying that Kathy Bates cover of Courtney Loves song (no actual name of song mentioned) was indeed cut but would be in the season 4 dvd when out. Jessica asked about twice if she would be returning. Once, Sarah Paulson answering ""YES"" for her, followed by a ""yes, I am done."" followed by a small story from her. But there was still something funny about it all. No concrete or confirming answer from Tim Minear is AHS season 5 was filming in Los Angeles when asked. He just said, ""YES it is being filmed."" again. Not clear. Evan Peters also not directly confirmed being on AHS season 5. Tim Minear, once again saying.. ""I dont know are you in season 5?"" leaving it up in the air.  Announced and confirmed were clearly Matt Bomer and Cheyenne Jackson. Matt Bomer played with a ""Maybe"" as to his character being romantically involved with Gaga's character. It was entertaining to watch overall but like I mentioned lots of humor. Nothing that most of us wanted a direct and sincere and firm answer to was addressed as such really."

AmericanHorrorStory,2z48oq,SimeonsDilemma,39,Sun Mar 15 16:41:37 2015 UTC,I'm hoping since this looks so teenagey and camp that it gives space for season 5 of AHS to get a bit darker again like with Asylum

AmericanHorrorStory,2z48oq,Requiem45,13,Sun Mar 15 15:36:56 2015 UTC,There's no guarantee of that. She could still very well be in AHS. That's like saying Sarah Paulson won't be on AHS because she's in American Crime Story.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z48oq,OvernightSiren,27,Sun Mar 15 18:34:35 2015 UTC,Why does everyone hate her so much? She isn't that bad.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z48oq,davis98,4,Sun Mar 15 19:50:52 2015 UTC,"She has decent comedic chops but needs work on her dramatic acting. She played to her strengths in Coven, but was kind of flat in Freak Show."

They were a lot more inebriated than the other panels I watched (I watched one other one) but I still thought it was fine. I thought the comments at Finn were light-hearted. I enjoyed it.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z7ctu,Zinthaniel,0,Mon Mar 16 08:45:17 2015 UTC,I saw no problem with how any of them acted. They were having fun. They have to suffer the fans every year - and they always ask dumb creepy questions and want to give them things.   I can understand why they most likely didn't want to be there . Girls want to hug and touch evan - it probably weirds them out.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z7ctu,Snork_Nork,2,Mon Mar 16 16:39:48 2015 UTC,apparently JL wanted to hug and kiss Evan tonight too. HAHA that was adorable.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z7ctu,Zinthaniel,2,Mon Mar 16 05:30:26 2015 UTC,Yeah that was cute. But they know each other. At the end of the panel when all the fans ran to the stage like a bunch of desperate lonely women and boys - it just made me feel for them.   I would hate to have to deal with that.

AmericanHorrorStory,2z1t33,KometBlu,1 point,Sun Mar 15 00:55:31 2015 UTC,usually they'll say like one sentence giving  a very vague description of the season. like last year the only thing they mentioned about freak show was the it was in 1950s florida telling the story of freaks in a freak show- they also announced that everyone there was returning
AmericanHorrorStory,2z1t33,spelling88,1 point,Sat Mar 14 21:14:20 2015 UTC,I am hoping we will all get some clarity or closure as far as JL goes. Now that she is part of the panel.  Am hoping for something out of left field since they went with that sudden Gaga and Hotel theme tweet release.
AmericanHorrorStory,2z1t33,Snork_Nork,1 point,Sat Mar 14 21:28:32 2015 UTC,"True that kind of seems like something they'd save for a panel.

AmericanHorrorStory,2yzggd,davis98,15,Sat Mar 14 03:19:02 2015 UTC,"I actually really like that idea. And it makes sense.

AmericanHorrorStory,2yzggd,ahsfreakshow,4,Sat Mar 14 03:47:50 2015 UTC,The whole Joe Escandarian plot line sorta confirmed that if the house is knocked down then something bad would happen to all the ghosts inside. Remember that Constance came to say goodbye to her children in the house once she thought there was no persuading him. If the building is replaced by another then I don't think the ghosts would be around anymore.

AmericanHorrorStory,2yzjim,davis98,35,Sat Mar 14 03:49:55 2015 UTC,"I actually think its a pretty meaningless description at this point in development - its probably just something Murphy threw out there to the CEO. However things they could do to be really mix it up:   Use found footage - cctv in hallways, elevators, ghost hunter show does a doco there and they disappear Blair Witch style etc Focus on one character from one room each episode and tell their story Go backwards in time from the end at Ep 1 to the beginning at Ep 13 Ep 1 is set on floor 1, Ep2 on floor2 and so on until we get to Ep and floor 13 where a big secret is revealed. Give it a Noir feel (including shooting in black and white) rather than the usual Southern Gothic Use almost all new cast Make it a sci-fi horror by having the hotel as an alien experiment kind of thing with invasion of the body snatchers feel Give it a surreal, David Lynch feel - strange rooms with dancing dwarfs, rooms that go back in time, rooms that lead to other dimensions Every day a person wakes up in the hotel is the same day ground hog day style and he needs to work out why Do it as a very early period piece - say 1800's when people were fascinated with the occult Have characters from S1 and 3 staying at the hotel Set it in a skid row hotel and make it really gritty and dirty Set it in a futuristic time with a 1984 type despot government and the hotel is a sanctuary for dissidents. Use a mostly black cast No killing season"

AmericanHorrorStory,2yzjim,thetokenblackfriend,3,Sat Mar 14 19:56:02 2015 UTC,What hotel doesnt have a 13th floor. Do they skip them due to superstition or are they just not high enough
AmericanHorrorStory,2yzjim,monkeysrule123,9,Sat Mar 14 22:26:34 2015 UTC,"Skip them. Usually they just  go 11,12,14"

AmericanHorrorStory,2yzjim,burntliketoast,6,Wed Mar 18 12:06:13 2015 UTC,I think giving the show a noir feel for this season would be a great idea! Flashing in and out of black and white would give horror scenes more edge and style.   I think using a more elegant and diverse wardrobe would also make it interesting. Although it does depend on the time period. If it were in the 20's show girls and fancy-ladies with big hats would add a very interesting feeling.
AmericanHorrorStory,2yzjim,VantablackRoses,3,Sat Mar 14 15:45:53 2015 UTC,Great ideas!
AmericanHorrorStory,2yzjim,spelling88,15,Sat Mar 14 16:38:39 2015 UTC,they say that every season... except its always true. coven was all about modern music (except for stevie nicks) crazy camera angles and shifting time periods. freak show was shot almost like an old hollywood movie with very big exterior shots so usually what RM means by that is the style of shooting. things that are always present are strong/sassy female characters and witty one liners
AmericanHorrorStory,2yzjim,DireShinx,10,Sat Mar 14 21:16:44 2015 UTC,Of corse it will be different. Every season is a different genre of horror entirely. That's why people favor differ tent seasons over others. Because there all a different type of horror.

Maybe Have the show on TV and have it be the normal format, but there's a few different characters in different rooms. Similar to what someone said with different shows following different characters - have digital content to support the show. The digital content will be features that fans can make customizable. Each off-air feature will be about a different character and be very RL Stine-esque - you pick the ending, or beginning."

I haven't heard Ryan say anything about it yet. Inquisitr and the sites it claims to have gotten its information from aren't exactly reliable sources, they pretty much just scour the internet and see what the buzz is. They're gossip sites. Like I just saw Enstarz post an article about that supposed ""insider info"" that's been circulating lately, even admitting that they found it on this very subreddit. They're not the sources that talk directly to Ryan and the network, they just pick up what they hear and use gimmicks in their titles to trick people into thinking it's all legit."

In the 70s, she avoided wearing black for two years in order to distance herself from the crazies, but started wearing it again. Probably because she looks awesome in black."

She doesn't practice magic of any sort or follow the wiccan religion. It's like being inspired by the hippie fashion but it doesn't mean you're a hippie. (: I'm glad she gained a lot of fame after Coven. She's an amazing artist. Fleetwood mac reminds me of car ride with my mom when I was little. Bring back some good memories.

AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,Des0lat10n,11,Tue Mar 10 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"Ryan said that season four would be connected to season one way back in October. And obviously no such connection actually happened on the show. Either they cut it out of the story or they couldn't get it to work canonically. At this point all four seasons are done and over with so it's impossible for the show to confirm any more connections among them (unless a future season reveals a connection between itself and two of the seasons), so everything we come up with now is just fan speculation. Right now the only two seasons that we know are definitely connected are Asylum and Freak Show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,ahsfreakshow,-6,Tue Mar 10 15:16:51 2015 UTC,"Well, characters sharing names is an obvious connection. Madison and Dr. Montgomery both have a way with dead things."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,davis98,3,Tue Mar 10 17:03:43 2015 UTC,"The shared names are not a connection. Again that is fan speculation. Ryan, prior to season 4 confirmed that he and the writers liked to throw in Easter eggs. Just a wink wink* at a previous season. Madison having a way with dead things is not a connection since every witch had a way with dead things. It wasn't something unique to her."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,Zinthaniel,-7,Tue Mar 10 17:13:55 2015 UTC,Why couldn't that be a connection? Why are you so sure of yourself?
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,davis98,3,Tue Mar 10 17:16:22 2015 UTC,"The Montgomery's would be a connection if it was firmly established in the show that they were related, but it hasn't. So far it's just a theory with frankly very little evidence to support it, and most likely just a parallel as previously noted. It's pretty foolish to assume that everyone with the same last name is directly related, especially with such common names as Montgomery and Howard."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,ahsfreakshow,3,Tue Mar 10 17:42:25 2015 UTC,"People having the same last name isn't even remotely indicative of a connection. There are plenty of people named ""Montgomery"" who aren't related, it's incredibly common. Surely you can see how this makes it difficult to believe that they are definitely related. Or, really, even probably related. At best, they're possibly related. And it's not even a very likely possibility."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,doomsday1216,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:06:12 2015 UTC,"Unless it's confirmed then it's not a connection. It's really just that simple. What you are doing is by definition Speculation. Madison and Charles were never confirmed as related nor is their any evidence that they would be related.  You are free to speculate that they could be related that is your choice, but again that is just speculation."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,Zinthaniel,-3,Tue Mar 10 18:53:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, but if this is ever confirmed, the ""I told you so's"" will reign down upon you."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,davis98,2,Tue Mar 10 19:35:37 2015 UTC,People just like to shut other people down to make them feel good about themselves. I've seen theories that make zero sense that are upvoted. If you want to believe it's a connection then you believe it.
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,Lecter07,3,Thu Mar 12 11:58:45 2015 UTC,And I will gladly accept them.
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,Zinthaniel,2,Tue Mar 10 20:09:22 2015 UTC,This sub is filled with connection speculation. Just search 'connection' you'll find some theories but unfortunately most of them are not well thought out and the ones that seem plausible are still only speculations at this point because RM and BF haven't given us anything solid besides pepper's story.
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,jtyler27,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:13:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think they should make some a bit more obvious so all the annoying speculation will die down."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yk7qx,Doctor_Arkham,2,Fri Mar 13 05:18:37 2015 UTC,Honestly any large connections between the seasons will feel cheap and gimmicky at this point. Little ones like Pepper are fine but for the most part I feel like these seasons should stay separate
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,Henry_Burris,20,Tue Mar 10 04:57:18 2015 UTC,Murder House is a god compared to Freakshow.
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,jacobneiswender,16,Tue Mar 10 23:07:30 2015 UTC,"Nope, I'm still really glad I got to meet all of the characters this season introduced, and I loved spending time in Jupiter, Florida. It was slow at times but it was always beautiful to watch and very well acted. My friends and I love watching AHS together and this season was no different."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,movieguy0621,5,Tue Mar 10 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the season was great, but that it was too long. There were things in the season that just didn't have to be, and they detracted away from the overall story because they had to fit 13 episode worth of content into it.  If the season had had 8 or 9 episodes, and cut out a bunch of stuff like Lizard Girl, her father, and the Seal Boy's relationship with her. It's kind of irrelevant, and it definitely lead to nowhere. As much as I loved Twisty the Clown, his entire role could be cut down to a couple of scenes to show who inspired Dandy. The Chester storyline can be cut completely, and his entire story and point (Killing Maggie) can be done in a single episode.  There's so much more, but I'd need a refresher to to list it all. I just felt like the season was great, but it could have been spectacular if it was shorter, and well paced."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,Lecter07,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:25:03 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree, although I think putting all of Chester's shenanigans into one episode would have kind of been a disservice to all the characters he interacted with. NPH is fine, but admittedly, I think I'd have a hard time squeezing him in even if I were the showrunner. Sadly, I think we could have done without NPH completely. I don't really need cheap celeb cameos to make me interested in the show(fucking gaga). I assumed Maggie was going to die for awhile, as Im sure most did, it was just so eye-rolly to me in the way it all played out the last few episodes."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,limeade09,6,Tue Mar 10 19:37:18 2015 UTC,"It was like they wanted a GREAT way to finish her off, so why not bring in Neil Patrick Harris to murder her shockingly. But it came off distasteful. She had become a good character, and it seemed like they were trying to paint her as a new protagonist.   Not to mention, after it happened, the other characters who had spent the entire time rallying around her, and had gotten their retribution because of her, were just like, ""Oh well"". Definitely didn't sit right with me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,Lecter07,3,Tue Mar 10 19:49:59 2015 UTC,"""Let's steal her jewels""  Seriously?! I hated Desiree's character because she was such an instigator."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,ness1215,3,Thu Mar 12 04:54:37 2015 UTC,"What the fuck was up with Elsa having working, normal legs in the finale?!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,mrrobopuppy,7,Wed Mar 11 07:26:10 2015 UTC,"I haven't rewatched it since Freak Show ended, though I didn't think it was as bad as everyone else thought. Wait till October when it goes on Netflix; people said the same about Coven, but when they binged it it got a lot better. AHS is the perfect show to binge, if anything it's improved by it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,AlfieBoheme,6,Tue Mar 10 09:56:28 2015 UTC,People hated seasons one ending and thought season 2 was sloppy and all over the place.
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,lurkingphoenix,5,Tue Mar 10 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"Yep. Everyone on this sub is going to hate season five and wish it was more like season four. Then, the next year, we will all hate season six and wish it was more like season five."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,davis98,0,Wed Mar 11 21:07:15 2015 UTC,I never said they didn't. I just said people thought Coven was awful but binging made it better. I guess the same could be said of the other two as well
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,AlfieBoheme,8,Wed Mar 11 10:13:11 2015 UTC,I feel like the last two episodes were the best in Freak Show. It was intense and kept me wondering what'll happen next. I wasn't like that for the majority of the season.
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,blaqkaudioxd,6,Tue Mar 10 05:53:15 2015 UTC,I liked it.  I don't know why people can't just enjoy the ride.

AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,davis98,3,Wed Mar 11 21:07:57 2015 UTC,I loved it up until the final episode.  I still think it was a very sloppy way to end everything.

AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,jackanthonyfernandez,0,Mon Mar 16 00:13:38 2015 UTC,"have not rewatched due to my lack of interest, I barely made it through with week by week hype.  I still rank it under every other season, just for the simple fact that I could keep interest, and they at least had a major theme in the others(what I mean is we only seen about 1-2 real freakshow acts, the rest was a solo glee reel).  I feel like the freakshow really could have shone bright, but it lost me after 4 episodes when everyone started killing eachother for no rational reason."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,AChickenTender,0,Thu Mar 12 21:50:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly,  it seems like, since season 3, they've been really pushing for a female demographic, which is absolutely fine, but they've cut back on the horror and added music and glamour,  so it seems like they want a wider range of women watching, not just horror fans. Too much attention was given to dandy (over the top acting) and interpersonal relationships over real horror.   Basically,  they sold out, in my view"
AmericanHorrorStory,2yizxj,AChickenTender,2,Thu Mar 12 22:00:39 2015 UTC,"I really believe you,and never looked at it that way.  It went from scary situations to mostly drama(Ima murder other witches I don't like even though we are in a coven and supposed to protect each other from hunters) real quick after season 2."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yh0kg,Androuv,18,Mon Mar 9 19:20:17 2015 UTC,I would love it! Love Nashville but think it'd be more interesting to see her return to AHS

AmericanHorrorStory,2yh0kg,Ranger5052,-6,Sat Mar 14 01:23:42 2015 UTC,"If she did it would probably be in a very limited capacity. For example, maybe she reprises her role as Vivian and checks into the hotel for a night."
AmericanHorrorStory,2yh0kg,davis98,4,Sat Mar 14 04:13:23 2015 UTC,Why would it be limited?  She has already finished filming the first three seasons of Nashville and nkthing has been signed or confirmed for a fourth season so right now she is available to work!!!

AmericanHorrorStory,2y200l,Sabretooth24,3,Thu Mar 5 19:46:13 2015 UTC,"I feel like Freak Show would have been better if they kept Twisty around. Dandy was a great character and I understand what happened to Twisty was necessary in the way they made his character evolve, but dammit, Twisty was the most ""horror"" element of the series. Freak Show I definitely enjoyed, but I felt it actually went kinda down-hill as the series went on. Whereas Murder House felt like a mystery we were unraveling and Asylum felt like a struggle where every step forward was two steps back. Freak Show felt like they didn't quite know exactly where they wanted to go with the plot but nailed everything else (sets, theming, characters). I think it was definitely a step up from Coven but still not really my favorite. There were no ""oh shit I'm gonna crap my pants"" moments in each episode like there were with the first two, but it felt more spread out and ""AHS lite"" since the show gained so much mainstream popularity. That being said, it was still a good season and keeps me hopeful for season 5."
AmericanHorrorStory,2y200l,mrrobopuppy,2,Wed Mar 11 03:59:42 2015 UTC,Definitely with you on twisty!He was my favourite horror character and really hoped he would play a more central role to the whole story ark
AmericanHorrorStory,2y200l,ahandfulofbirds,10,Wed Mar 11 08:06:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Freak Show is my favourite season, because of the characters as you said, who were almost all developed to a point where you felt for them. There were a lot of different internal arcs going on in Freak Show, but the main reason I love it is because of the themes. Isolation, homophobia, fear of being outcast, and guilt were really strongly present throughout the series, and with that we got some great acting (despite what everybody else thinks, I found Jimmy to be a great portrayal of a guilt ridden, depressed alcoholic). The horror in Coven and Freak Show is definitely less supernatural and freaky or gory, and more ""what are people capable of given the right circumstances"" sort of horror. It's morbid watching Dell feeling conflicted as he snaps Ma Petite's neck, and it's disturbing the lengths Stanley and Zelda take to make Ethel's death look like a suicide. Even the good characters do totally fucked up things, Dandy's final scene being my favourite horror moment from the season. All in all, I think it's really well put together, and while not really scary, I hardly blame it. Asylum is the only season that scared me at all, and there's so much else in this season to hold it up I didn't mind too much."
AmericanHorrorStory,2y200l,terriblemothra,1 point,Thu Mar 5 20:15:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah you hit the nail right on the head!  Couldn't agree more and I think freak show had plenty of horror in it maybe not along the lines of asylum and murder house or even coven because those were more supernatural horror compared to freak show which was more of a psychological horror.  The entire purpose of freak show I think was designed to step away from the supernatural realm and step into the psychological horror field..in the whole purpose of the show was to shed light on the fact that human beings can be more monsters then anything we create or make up in our minds...there was some supernatural horror with Edward more Drake I don't think that storyline was really scary but it at least touched on the supernatural aspect of it..and as far as psychological or everything about it from twisty to dandy to Penny's dad to the overall cast of freak show outside of the freaks everyone from the police to the townspeople to the family members of the doctor...it showed that society can be very cold and cruel to anyone who is different..only thing I dislike about freak show is I felt like episodes one through six were completely different than seven through 13 it was almost like two different shows from the beginning to the middle to the end...I didn't really like the way it ended but I watched it on a week to week basis I think my feelings on it will change once I can sit down and binge watch it from beginning to end like I have done with all the other seasons.  I've seen murder house and asylum four times each, coven three times, and freak show once (except for the last five episodes of freak show on my DVR I have seen them all two times each!)"

Throughout the season, the Aliens represent a synthesis of the two: God-like creatures from the realm of science; objective Beings guiding the season's action through a sort of Divine intervention. I would argue the Aliens were the most brilliant aspect of Asylum, not the ""unexplained, unnecessary secondary plot line"" that a lot of people claim it is. The dramatic irony of the character's dueling out the supremacy of science or religion while actually being ruled by both simultaneously, represented in the Aliens, was a fantastic touch on the show's theme."

AmericanHorrorStory,2y2gkx,thecuntmagician,6,Thu Mar 5 21:45:41 2015 UTC,His name is Dr. Feinbloom
AmericanHorrorStory,2y2gkx,ahsfreakshow,7,Fri Mar 6 03:08:31 2015 UTC,"The psychiatrist was played (voiced) by Danny Huston. He essentially confirms it in this interview (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OqJKv_z7oQ). So that basically explains everything. Most likely they just reused Danny for the part since he was already on set for Massimo's scenes and so that they wouldn't have to go through the casting process for such a small part. And obviously if they showed Danny playing two characters in one season the AHS universe would explode, so that's why the psychiatrist's face is never shown. So there is no deeper meaning behind it, it was just a technicality on the production end of things. I don't doubt you for questioning this though, a lot of people picked up on it and tried to spin theories off of it. But there are the facts, so do with them what you wish."
AmericanHorrorStory,2y2gkx,Cduns112,2,Fri Mar 6 16:32:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty legit.  I actually was thinking along the same lines, that's why I was asking if I may be overthinking it!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2y2gkx,xotacoxo,5,Sat Mar 7 07:52:30 2015 UTC,"Although it can be fun to look for deeper meanings in this show, my money would be on that it was simply a cinematographic call. It is an interesting angle to film a scene from and ahs is big on their cinematography and use of unique lenses/angles."
AmericanHorrorStory,2y2gkx,iamofortuna,3,Fri Mar 6 01:37:27 2015 UTC,Yeah I was kind of thinking along the same lines that's part of the reason I was asking I know sometimes things really get overlooked with the show and people make something out of nothing a lot of times so I was wondering if I was doing that or if I had a legitimate  Theory going about the psychiatrist
AmericanHorrorStory,2y2gkx,Dad_Jokes_Inbound,4,Fri Mar 6 01:49:06 2015 UTC,"Alright so two scenes with the psychiatrist. In the first one, when he's talking with Gloria, she addresses him as Dr. Feinbloom, and he writes these things on his paper while she talks - 1, 2 He writes ""Hospital Dr. Winters"" right as he's reassuring Gloria that no one is suggesting Dandy be institutionalized (clearly he's considering it). The second scene with Dandy doesn't really have any clues as to what connection he might have with anything else. Since Freak Show takes place 12 years before Asylum, I think Ryan Murphy is just trying to irk us instead of giving us anything cool. I remember overthinking about how the psychiatrist's voice sounds a whole lot like Danny Huston's but it's probably nothing."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,smellsliketatespirit,104,Wed Mar 4 21:44:51 2015 UTC,Prays he doesn't play the troubled heart throb again
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,baileath,32,Wed Mar 4 23:11:58 2015 UTC,The troubled heart-throb that multiple female characters swoon over - he does bad things but really he's a good kid deep down... retch
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,Jashinist,5,Wed Mar 4 23:52:18 2015 UTC,"It makes both you and I sick to think of it happening again but it gets a large majority of the fandom moist, there's a decent chance it will happen."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,clwestbr,7,Thu Mar 5 12:29:28 2015 UTC,"But now everyone has Dandy's actor to tingle over, so we might get some variety :D"
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,Jashinist,4,Thu Mar 5 12:37:40 2015 UTC,You know I didn't think he was that impressive. Outside of being man-pretty I thought the character was pretty one-note.  Sort of shows you what kind of overall fandom we're really dealing with...
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,clwestbr,17,Thu Mar 5 12:40:32 2015 UTC,"Well it's pretty well-known that Ryan Murphy's shows tend to cater to the girls and gays - I tend to look on the positive side of it all. Now instead of the vast majority of media where it's 90% male characters with a token pretty girl with cleavage to ogle at, now we have 90% female characters and token butt shots and pretty boys to tingle over.   Is it progress? Probably not, but it's a nice change."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,Jashinist,6,Thu Mar 5 12:42:32 2015 UTC,"It definitely mixes things up with the cast, I just wish that the plots had been worth keeping an eye on lately. I thought season 1 had a great one (not perfect) but since then they've been a jumble. I honestly with most shows would worry about casting and diversity after they get a plot nailed down, this one is no exception and in fact is more guilty as it seems to focus more on cast than plot."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,clwestbr,0,Thu Mar 5 12:45:15 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad I'm not the only one. Don't get me wrong, Freak Show was a huge improvement over Coven, but Everyone was bonkers for Dandy Mott, but he was so simple.   ""I don't get my way, so I'm gonna kill anyone and everyone who says I can't do what I want."" And that was his ONLY motivation. Sure, he had one of the most shocking, disturbing, and disgusting scenes of the entire series. But his depth stopped at Mommy Issues."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,Lecter07,12,Thu Mar 5 19:42:50 2015 UTC,"It makes me sad because if you watch him in anything that isnt ahs (especially the third and fourth seasons) he really is a talented actor, the show just keeps handing him shit roles."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,The_Adamator,-13,Thu Mar 5 02:12:39 2015 UTC,"I thought his best role was in Freak Show. In Coven he barely has any lines, in Asylum he looks like he doesn't wanna be there and his performance is bleak, and I don't remember enough about Murder House to judge."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,agentbueller,11,Thu Mar 5 04:21:48 2015 UTC,in Asylum he looks like he doesn't wanna be there   Isn't that kinda the point?
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,kaleilubov,3,Thu Mar 5 22:39:05 2015 UTC,I seriously have had enough of Evan peters to the point where of he's gonna be playing the same person if rather not have him show up at all

AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,reddit_greenit,6,Thu Mar 5 15:27:14 2015 UTC,"Paulson isn't coming back? I know she's starring in American Crime Story, but I heard those two shows don't have conflicting schedules and that she'll probably be back?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,Ranger5052,6,Thu Mar 5 17:42:44 2015 UTC,"Ryan said in an interview that Sarah liked her part for Season 5, basically confirming that she was already included in the cast"
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,KaineCloaked,22,Fri Mar 6 02:05:45 2015 UTC,I am really over him. I would much rather see Finn W. take over as the male lead or at least introduce a new actor. This is even sadder news after hearing Zachary Q. won't be returning.
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,MyNamesNotObama,22,Thu Mar 5 00:49:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like that's not an appropriate mindset to have with Evan Peters. He's a decent actor, he's stuck with the show and has improved massively over the four seasons, and he's done everything they wanted him to do and works well with what he's given. He's really given this show his all, so now you're ""over him"" like he's you're high-school crush you've gotten too close to and they turned out to be sort of an ass? Just because you're used to seeing him on the show, this isn't ""sadder news"", it's completely unrelated to Zach Q! They only have announced 2 cast members as well, and he's the first one to confirm he's returning. Unless you have concrete reasons for not enjoying what Evan Peters has brought to this show, that is just such a childish statement."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,jhenderson3209,12,Thu Mar 5 13:36:59 2015 UTC,"He is still a great actor, and he's been sticking with the show for so long i coulden't picture it without him"
AmericanHorrorStory,2xyara,kaleilubov,8,Thu Mar 5 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I really want more Finn! Even Peters always plays the troubled heart throb and I'm tried of it. Maybe if he at least played a different type role, it won't be so bad."

I was hoping I would do it slowly to coincide with the summer premiere, but it only took me a week and a half....  That said, season 2 is stunning. Michael Pitt as Mason Verger is one of the best portrayals in recent TV history. And seeing as they introduce his pet moray near the end, makes me think they are going to follow the book more closely. Which will be absolutely insane."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxxfd,konfetkak,6,Thu Mar 5 01:54:18 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, prepare to have your mind melted. It has its issues (like all shows) but season 2 is just plain amazing tv. The finale is probably the best season finale I've ever seen, I don't know how they'll top it."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,thepalexmperor,11,Wed Mar 4 18:33:15 2015 UTC,One idea I can see would be a character going insane and seeing like a bunch of portraits on the wall come to life and start singing or something. Just as a homage to previous seasons.
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,S31A,19,Thu Mar 5 00:06:36 2015 UTC,"It's refered to Top Hat because Cheek To Cheek was in it, and Gaga recently covered that song with Tony Bennett. It was just a hint at Gaga."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,JolteeKun,11,Wed Mar 4 18:28:29 2015 UTC,"Both actually. It referenced that the film was set in a hotel, and that Gaga had covered it recently. It was a toofer hint!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,Tobias_you_blowhard,4,Wed Mar 4 18:36:47 2015 UTC,Maybe but it doesn't mean we will get a musical this season.

AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,IamLegba,27,Wed Mar 4 20:30:56 2015 UTC,This will probably get downvoted because unpopular opinion but if they cast lady fucking gaga and don't have her sing at least once I'll be disappointed
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,mansonfamily,4,Wed Mar 4 19:57:44 2015 UTC,"If it's not out of context, musical numbers are actually good for the show, but freak show was too much. And remember, Lady Gaga has a lot of potential in terms of creepiness."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,BartuHTC,4,Thu Mar 5 15:34:40 2015 UTC,I agree 100%! I may not be a fan of hers...but I'll admit that she does have an amazing voice! I'd be up for a song...if it's done tastefully and meshes well with the story line.
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,Echo5582,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:58:58 2015 UTC,"As a fan of hers, and her voice, obviously hahahaha. But, if they don't showcase her talent, I'd be okay with that. Right now I'm mostly curious about her acting talent, not what she can do with her singing talent."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,idwthis,5,Sun Mar 8 10:15:44 2015 UTC,"While I do hope she sings something at some point, they've also had Patti Labelle and Patti Lupone with no singing from either. Also Adam Levine."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,Ryguylv,20,Fri Mar 6 04:23:54 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree. ""You Don't Own Me"" in Asylum is an exception, but Jessica Lange's singing in Freakshow was not enjoyable for me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,jacobneiswender,14,Wed Mar 4 21:41:09 2015 UTC,"I doubt it will have much singing, if at all. I think Gaga's role will be purely acting, like Patti LaBelle's was. And since Murphy pays attention to to what fans say online, I'm sure he's aware the musical numbers weren't very well-received."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,Tobias_you_blowhard,13,Wed Mar 4 18:39:24 2015 UTC,Considering they cut out two musical performances that we know of in Freak Show I think RM got the hint
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,mansonfamily,5,Wed Mar 4 20:01:24 2015 UTC,"Patti sang one song in the hospital, intentionally badly of course, but she still sang something.  I think he'll stop doing the ""song per episode!"" thing he tried to do with Freakshow - to him even that's probably a massive concession, considering he's used to Glee where there's like 5 songs an episode."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,Jashinist,7,Wed Mar 4 23:54:18 2015 UTC,"I think you're thinking of Patti Lupone. Patti LaBelle was Dandy's maid. But yeah, I agree that we're mostly done with the songs."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,Tobias_you_blowhard,3,Thu Mar 5 01:18:36 2015 UTC,"Oh whoops you're right. Dang it, what are the odds of Ryan getting two well-known singers on the show named Patti."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,Jashinist,1 point,Thu Mar 5 01:35:54 2015 UTC,"Because of Gaga being cast, I feel like it that means it's a sure thing there will be musical pieces."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,broadsweetbullies,3,Thu Mar 5 02:01:04 2015 UTC,"But that to me just seems too...obvious. As much as RM loves his musical numbers, he seems to try and get people you wouldn't expect to sing them. Adam Levine wasn't the one singing in Asylum, Jessica Lange was. Coven had two singers; one sang once, but that was more of a dramatic scene than a musical piece. The other was Stevie Knicks, and that bitch's life is just one big music video, so they were pretty true-to-life there. And this season pretty much every cast member sang except the one who was an actual singer. But who knows, maybe she will sing this season, but I think we are over the full on musical scenes."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,Tobias_you_blowhard,6,Thu Mar 5 02:56:05 2015 UTC,"They cut Ethel and Ima's musical numbers from freakshow last season, so I think they know that the musical numbers were not well received. This isn't glee.. Musical numbers will ruin this show if they choose to include them again this year."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,bwood16,5,Thu Mar 5 00:10:23 2015 UTC,I have no doubt there's going to be a fair amount of singing. I think that's what's going to get me to stop watching. Shoehorning musical numbers into a horror show is silly. I really hope I get proved wrong though.
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,NotKateBush,4,Wed Mar 4 21:49:44 2015 UTC,"Considering how her latest projects have been pretty jazz-oriented, I bet we get an awesome, somber piano song at some point that'll go really well.  But I'm with you, don't want it as loaded with songs as it was last year."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,baileath,6,Wed Mar 4 23:42:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I only got a couple episodes into Freak Show before I just quit that season. The season was eh for me already, but then the covers were just... ugh."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,mymidnightmelody,9,Thu Mar 5 02:00:50 2015 UTC,I absolutely agree. The past two seasons have been really very disappointing...and it keeps getting worse. I stopped watching part way through this season and had to force myself to get through Coven. I feel like the writing has been declining; too many story lines and unnecessary characters.
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,shakespearesister319,3,Wed Mar 4 21:43:44 2015 UTC,"I really loved Life on Mars, Gods and Monsters, and Heroes from last season, but once everyone started having musical moments I was kind of annoyed with it. I liked that they cut it off and then the last scene brought it back kind of like a tribute to our distaste.   However, I really am hoping that Hotel bring us back to the real horror of the series even if it's too much like Murder House, it'll be scary. So, please no musical moments."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,Lecter07,3,Thu Mar 5 15:36:58 2015 UTC,Agreed. The announcement of Lady Gaga is the ONLY thing that is going to make me tune in after the last train wreck of a season. I had high hopes for freak show and I was left with shitty covers and absolutely NO horror. I watched freaky glee for 13 episodes. I fucking hate Glee with a passion. So very disappointing.
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxi5u,lickable_wallpaper,6,Thu Mar 5 17:03:27 2015 UTC,Their musical renditions are always fucking terrible(with gaga I'm sure they'll be great) but after the last two seasons who really gives a shit anymore?  The show is absolutely terrible now.

AmericanHorrorStory,2xxh5z,mansonfamily,5,Wed Mar 4 19:02:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can definitely see them getting back to an Asylum-esque season, with all these different types of horrors happening at the same time, and though different time periods."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xxh5z,Tobias_you_blowhard,6,Wed Mar 4 19:16:15 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly and I'd really love that. A hotel is a great device for this because pretty much anyone can be checking into a hotel (well, that's how I'm seeing it)."

They used the quote that he gave them months ago,  which only describes the clue and confirms nothing.

This article provides nothing new and no evidence that Murphy confirmed anything."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xsjz8,lolbroken,32,Wed Mar 4 01:42:58 2015 UTC,"I think a hotel is swinging back around to a setting where horror is innate. The last two seasons have had character, rather than location, based settings. Coven was about the coven of witches, Freak Show about the freaks. Asylum and Murder House were about the locations, and the past/present interplay of the location. The characters, too, but the core was the building.  With Hotel, we're getting back to that. A setting that can work as a character. A setting with its own history and quirks and innate terrors. The last two seasons have existed without that, the characters kind of existing wherever.  Think of The Shining, or of 1408. The hotel is a character in and of itself.  I have high hopes."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xsjz8,weavves,5,Tue Mar 3 23:34:43 2015 UTC,"if it goes shining or 1408 direction wouldn't it just be going back to the same trope of season one and some parts of season 2, another ""haunted"" place and the horrors that happened there? If they go in a direction of a murder mystery or something kinda like clue, with hidden passageways and weird stuff then maybe it can be pulled off."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xsjz8,gittlebass,31,Wed Mar 4 00:14:18 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I wonder what you moaners on this sub actually want. The last two seasons were nothing like the first two, so they suck! The new season can't be like the first two, that's treading old ground! Honest to goodness, folks, make up your mind.  I have enjoyed every season of AHS. It's a good show. The acting and the ensemble cast are phenomenal and I've found something to like about every season.  If they tread old ground with the haunted/cursed/doomed building trope then I'm fine with it, because it'll be a new story. Tropes don't mean that it can't be done again. That's why they're tropes. It's a good trope. Tried and true. And the writers can inject new ideas into it. I mean, Violet was a ghost for several episodes before she, or anyone else, realised? That was a nifty twist!  If they go the whole film noir route like you're suggesting that's cool, too. Pull in some Old Hollywood glam, why not. Give Lady Gaga hair like Veronica Lake and Lauren Bacall. Whatever. I don't care, at the end of the day.  I just dig this show, and I don't understand why this sub rips apart every little detail they might not be 100% sold on. Just be happy these people, cast and crew, are making a show that you dig. If you don't dig it, just tune out."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xsjz8,hotguysandpizza,2,Tue Mar 3 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"I love the show still even after the last two seasons, but they really fucked up with Coven. In Murder House and Asylum there were main characters, and you followed them along with side characters in their adventures. In Coven, they had too many people and stories to follow at once. And then they repeated it with Freak Show! But at least Freak Show made up for it with really endearing characters, i.e Dandy and Twisty. I'm really hoping for this one we follow like Sarah Paulson as someone who checks into the hotel and it's about her adventures through it. And Gaga is perhaps the creepy owner. No more of this ""Lange is our leader and everything is connected back to her"" stuff they've been shoving down our throats for three years."

It wasn't announced that she would for sure be leaving, it was announced that Freak Show would LIKELY be her last season. In fact, Ryan said that Jessica was set on leaving after season four, but as he continued to talk to her about season five and her potential character, she seemed to be at least open to the idea of returning. In what capacity this is, nobody knows- could be a minor role. Nobody knows if she will accept his offer or not. This was the most recent news we have heard about Lange's potential involvement with season five. Yes, he sent that tweet to Jessica the night of the finale which made it seem like she wouldn't be returning, but maybe it's still unknown if she will return or not. Don't make statements like this as if it's fact. That's how false information spreads. Until it is announced that Jessica Lange will definitely not be returning for Hotel, it is a viable possibility. I'm sure we'll know by the end of Paleyfest.  For the record, I hope Jessica does leave- at least in terms of being a leading character. A minor role for her would be cool but I don't feel like AHS absolutely has to have her to continue being good. Someone else deserves a leading role for sure."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xva24,Ehlak,1 point,Wed Mar 4 17:38:11 2015 UTC,She announced this long before freak show. There have been rumors that she'll return- but they're just that. Rumors. She even said that whole thing a while ago about how she wished people would stop asking her to come back because that chapter of her career has ended. Is it possible that will change? Yes. But it's been made pretty clear that she doesn't plan on returning.
AmericanHorrorStory,2xva24,TheGreaterFool_,5,Wed Mar 4 21:54:17 2015 UTC,"1-22-15 But in 2014, Lange seemed to have changed her tune when she revealed to E! News in November that perhaps her spooky gig wasn’t quite finished. ""You know, I told him (Ryan Murphy) that we would sit down and have a long conversation when this was over,"" Lange stated, adding that she had no idea how the showrunner could possibly create a better character for her than Elsa Mars, the beloved owner of the Florida-based freak show. ""I really—in deference to Ryan, who I love dearly and who I respect beyond—I have no idea at this point."" Although Lange might not know how to top her ""Freak Show"" character ... Murphy might! The showrunner revealed that he would do everything in his creative power to keep Lange hooked on “AHS” – even if that meant daily bribes!  ""[‘Freak Show’] is her favorite season without question,"" he said during an interview in October. ""She said that to me, she has said that publicly, that she feels really reinvigorated in some regards. I really want her to keep her hand in. Does that mean 13 episodes or six or one? What does that mean? She and I will probably have a dinner date over the holidays. We always start with the character and she decides from there. Before I was met with a really quick no and now I'm hearing, ‘Let's keep talking.' So that's a promising sign ... I think if I presented her with the right character, it could work. That's my hope. I'm sending bribes every day!""  But it looks as though Murphy couldn’t entice Lange with his whimsical gifts. When the final episode of Season 4 aired, the creator took to Twitter to thank his star for bringing his show to life. “Thank you Jessica … for everything,” he shared his gratitude through a tweet. “Always.”  This is why I think she will at least make an APPEARANCE this season wether it be one episode of a small handful!"

The element of horror in windowless rooms, sound-proof rooms, and doors that open to nothing sounds awesome. Plus, we saw a crazy doctor in season 1, and that whole plot was very interesting, IMO.

AmericanHorrorStory,2xqamb,Wubbledaddy,9,Tue Mar 3 03:05:11 2015 UTC,"Make use of the hotel setting and associated horror tropes Long spooky empty corridors, voices coming out of unoccupied rooms, small girl playing in the corridor alone, sleazy voyeuristic reception clerk, quiet but knowing bell hop, people trapped in rooms experiencing paranormal things, mysterious residents, slasher shower scene, ballroom that goes back in time, hauntings caused by murders and suicides,  elevators with a life of their own (""I wish to complain about the elevators. I pressed my floor but the elevator would only take me to level 13. And I must say I thought you would have sealed off that floor after what was obviously a fire in it."" Receptionist: ""But sir, this hotel only has 12 floors"" Da da dummmm.      Noir Hotels lend themselves to film noir, the most American of all cinematic styles - staring moodily out the window at the city at night, private investigators poking around, sexy lounge singers, gangsters and crooks, cheap affairs with dangerous dames. A noir feel would some great atmosphere and give a different vibe.      Found footage I feel like they could incorporate some found footage style bits in the season for something different. Some CCtv footage of weird, blurry things in the elevator and corridors. A mysterious man has a bank of monitors voyeuristically feeding in vision from the cameras in the rooms. A bunch of community cable tv Ghost hunters stay at the hotel. They mysteriously disappear leaving behind the video footage they shot.      The hotel to have an ominous presence The Murder House and the Asylum were always a haunting presence in the first couple of season and I'd like the hotel to cast that same, daunting shadow over its inhabitants. I'd like a really run down hotel full of dodgy characters.  Maybe the hotel could have a purgatory kind of feel (as hotels often do), the people living there slowly begin to forget where they came from or who they are. They get more and more cut off from the outside world and everything they used to be.      Mystery Lots and lots of mystery. Lots. Just lots.      Sample story A private investigator is hired by the wealthy parents of girl who died in the hotel, officially by suicide but the parents suspect foul play. While staying in the hotel, the PI becomes smitten with the gorgeous resident lounge singer in the piano bar. She is engaged to the strange, old owner of the hotel. He seems to have some sort of hold over her. The PI sees the suicide girl appears in his room pointing at a painting. When he looks behind the painting he sees a peekhole and through it see the lounge singer and the hotel owner in a weird act. The PI gets to know the residents at the hotel. There is a mysterious woman who dresses all in black and orders the same drink at the bar at the same time and listens to the same song on the jukebox every night. One old man can't remember how he got there or where he came from. When the PI says he'll be staying another night the reception clerk says ""Of course. Many of our guests stay longer than they initially intended"" and leers. He views the CCtv footage from the elevator and corridors and sees a flash of a strange slenderman type blurry figure lurking in a dark corner. The PI hears a loud argument from a couple in the room next to his at night. When he complains about the noise the next day the receptionist says that room is not occupied. And other creepy stuff."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xkday,Waldszenen,10,Sun Mar 1 22:03:59 2015 UTC,Surely it would have been British Horror Story? Or English Horror Story? Us Brits are barely even part of Europe anymore...
AmericanHorrorStory,2xkday,Jarrrp,1 point,Sun Mar 1 17:52:12 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not entirely clear on the separation from Europe. I'm assuming it's the same issue as Canada, The United States, and Greenland being part of North America, but everybody just says America to refer to the US?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2xkday,Jarrrp,2,Sun Mar 1 18:12:24 2015 UTC,"Well, not really. There are a few people who believe that the way Europeans can move freely between countries in Europe is having a negative effect on the UK. Some people believe we should leave Europe and close our borders, so to speak. But then there are plenty of other people who'll tell you there are infinite benefits to immigration, for Britain. We're heading towards the point where, with our current government and their actions, we could well end up leaving Europe in the next few years. They want us to vote on it, like a referendum...at some point."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xkday,OhChickenBalls,0,Sun Mar 1 18:15:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Thanks for the info! But for all intents and purposes, I just think European Horror Story flows a little better than British or English Horror Story."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xlvnm,Drunk_CrazyCatLady,5,Sun Mar 1 22:54:59 2015 UTC,I came in here to post this! I think it will most likely be inspired by the cecil hotel since the season is meant to be set in the present.
AmericanHorrorStory,2xlvnm,maddrag,6,Sun Mar 1 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"I stayed in that hotel about 8 months before this happened.   That hotel is big, but each room is pretty small. So there must be a significant number of rooms. I can imagine it being very easy to murder people in there and not be caught. Every floor looks the same and halls wind around all over the place.  For some more background; The hotel seems to be ""split"" off into different wings, like the letter E if you were looking down on the hotel from a crane. The front part faces the nicer part of downtown. The back part faces skid row. Even though they are split, it's all accessible. You all take the same elevators to get to the floor and then the back and middle people would need to follow a passage heading behind the elevator. The front people would stay in this front area. I have this feeling that the hotel has put tourists in the front, but the back (and middle) is for long term  residents, though I don't know for sure.  All I can say is that if I was a serial killer, that would be the ideal location. You could slip around corners and down stairwells with no problem. I hardly ever saw anyone in the halls. And that elevator was so loud that you'd know when someone was coming up."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xlvnm,ernestborgnine2013,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:23:55 2015 UTC,Yes! I was hoping they would take a look at elisa lam. Cause it's kinda unsettling the whole circumstances
AmericanHorrorStory,2xlvnm,Sugaredvenom,3,Mon Mar 2 01:10:15 2015 UTC,It could be. It is rumored that the Black Dahlia was on the Cecil Hotel right before her death.

AmericanHorrorStory,2xlvnm,Sugaredvenom,-1,Tue Mar 3 02:47:57 2015 UTC,"This is too fresh and would be disrespectful to the girl's family to include it in the show. There have been talks of a horror movie based on this and they've been slammed for poor taste, with good reason. What should be a serious consideration of young people with mental illnesses is getting sidelined for paranormal bullshit."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xlvnm,periodistabarista,2,Mon Mar 2 05:15:13 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you. Do you think the hotel itself would be disrespectful to use as inspiration? Also I'm pretty sure there is already a movie about this hotel/story, Dark Water, like the video said. This kinda thing is right up AHS alley."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xlvnm,achele,1 point,Mon Mar 2 05:53:59 2015 UTC,That movie was made before the woman's death. Quite a few people believe that she was murdered and that it was inspired by that movie.

AmericanHorrorStory,2xlvnm,mishlove18,1 point,Mon Mar 2 18:18:52 2015 UTC,"While I agree that it'd be disrespectful and in bad taste, from what I understand there were plenty of other curious deaths in that hotel before Elisa. I would think, given AHS fashion, if they were to reference it her story/the hotel in general it would be the smaller details rather than include the whole story itself."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xla0y,millertimebaby,2,Mon Mar 2 02:03:25 2015 UTC,"I did like murder house. Even though there were a lot of jump cuts, there was occasionally a really cool shot. Like the scene with Violet and the mean girl at the skate place."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xla0y,KaineCloaked,1 point,Mon Mar 2 02:32:23 2015 UTC,"There really weren't a lot of jump cuts at all, I mean a few times but even Coven and Freakshow has a few. And honestly Asylum had some of the best shots, including that long take using the mirrors in the hotel."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xla0y,Zinthaniel,2,Mon Mar 2 22:07:41 2015 UTC,I really liked the direction they went with Asylum and hope they gl back to it as far as cinematography and filming goes.  They recorded the asylum season on film..it gave it that old school creepy vibe with lots of darkness..deep blacks...contrasts and dim/dull colors..alarmist giving it a lifeless feeling.  Freakshow was a lot flashier and flamboyant and it was great as far as visual detail..im just personally hoping it's more murderhouse/asylumish again as far as filming goes!!
AmericanHorrorStory,2xla0y,kmadover,3,Wed Mar 4 22:55:16 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't they be able? Most of the seasons are filmed primarily in one pivotal building or, in season 4's case, confined area."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xkat0,HmmmNol,11,Tue Mar 10 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"Freak Show was less cohesive than Coven, since it didn't at least have the holding power of 'all of this has to do with who the next Supreme is.' FS was just a bunch of sad character portraits loosely tied together by location and time.  Maybe if watched consecutively it'll hold up better than it did with week-long gaps in between, but it had nothing on seasons 1 and 2."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xkat0,israeldmo,3,Sun Mar 1 15:48:57 2015 UTC,"I thought it was very very good. A lot of fans disliked it because it feels like there is a lack of one major plot. It's a lot of little stuff going on with a lot of characters, with new characters and plots being introduced in the last 3 episodes. That being said, it was entertaining the whole way through and the characters were very lovable. And despite all the plot line havoc going on, I feel like all the stories were tied up and not just left as a loose end."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xkat0,recoveringdropout,8,Mon Mar 2 06:55:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, too much negative response here. I thought it was fantastic. Definitely my second favorite season behind Asylum."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xkat0,Doctor_Arkham,2,Sun Mar 1 18:31:40 2015 UTC,"Fairly new obsession with the series, I binge watched the first 3 seasons then watched Freak Show weekly. I will say watching them all back to back gives the seasons so much more, like any show. I am one of the few viewers who loved Coven though it was a tad over dramatic at times due to the all female cast, as most my favorite season is Asylum of course. Freak show started out a bit weak,there is simply too much cast and back story for each episode to keep you on the edge of your seat the first half of the season. When certain new cast members were introduced (last few episodes) I felt like the season really picked up and got back to its original flair, overall I enjoyed it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xkat0,davis98,2,Tue Mar 3 00:57:28 2015 UTC,Better than people will say.

AmericanHorrorStory,2xkat0,bwood16,2,Sun Mar 1 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"To rank it against the other seasons I would put it in 4th place but agree with some other folks who have said if you get the chance to watch it all together and really binge I think it would be worth your time. There's a lot of great moments and overall it's of course well-made, it's just not really 'horror' so if you're expecting that you will be disappointed."

The backstories and plot around each character was so brilliant,it's easily the best story in any season in my opinion (it also relates back to Asylum to some extent).So in terms of story, it's really gripping,but horror not so much.My advice - stick with it a few more episodes."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xiru1,mrglow,4,Sun Mar 1 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"Might be interesting if they were subtle with it and only hint at it instead of spelling it out. Eg. a woman checks in with a baby and the reception clerks leers at the baby ""Oh he's so young and innocent. A young, uncorrupted soul is just what this place needs"" - cue devilish grin.     What if there is a subtext of the hotel being this kind of battle ground between good and evil. The people on the bottom floors are devilish, dionosyian types - parties, loud music, orgies, revelry and merriment, live for today. The people on the top floors are angelic, Apollonian types, living the quiet life, trying to do good things and help people. The hotel manager has to try and keep the peace between the two as they clash (""Can you please keep the music down!"" ""Shut up you sanctimonious po-faced bores and live a little""). There are hints about what is in the basement (hell) or on the rooftop (heaven).      A young Stephen King type horror writer comes to stay at the hotel in a creative block.  He trys to check out but finds he has no money to pay for the night he has stayed.  He is instructed that to met his debt and leave he must write a story that the owner of the hotel thinks is worthy of his talent. The devilish try and tempt him into a Faustian deal to write the great American horror novel telling him he must revel in the sensory delights of the material world to know what it is to be truly human. The angelics tell him the transcendent is the only true reality that lasts and he should keep his soul pure and untouched by the base senses. Cue the fight for his soul."

It also gets a few facts flat-out wrong, or implies things incorrectly.  I'd recommend the book Devil In The White City by Erik Larson.

AmericanHorrorStory,2xf4ap,sirxaviergaga,1 point,Mon Mar 2 01:12:17 2015 UTC,I chose Jamie because she hardly got any screen time last season. Alexandra can always play a prostitute maid.
AmericanHorrorStory,2xf4ap,itsthe90s,9,Mon Mar 2 02:13:38 2015 UTC,"I like the vibe of it.  I especially like the idea that the story has a nice timeline. As we all know, this show has a way of going off the rails quite quickly ha.   If the show makes it a priority to remind the audience (more so themselves) that there's a finite amount of days (or hell even hours!) to the plot, it will help keep it on the rails.   You know, what if goes all '24' and each episode will be one hour. 12-13 hours total! That'd definitely be a departure in structure for the show. Might be interesting to explore."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xf4ap,chattypenguin,5,Mon Mar 2 02:30:57 2015 UTC,"I considered making it a few hours. But since fashion is a large component of this show, I think the characters need frequent wardrobe changes."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xf4ap,chattypenguin,4,Sat Feb 28 03:11:04 2015 UTC,"I love the fashions, too, but Asylum's wardrobe was very basic with habits, hospital gowns, doctor's coats and prison garb for the most part save for a visitor or flashback here and there."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xf4ap,cosmicpizza666,2,Sat Feb 28 03:16:16 2015 UTC,"Asylum was really cool in regards to fashion. It had black and gray overtones, so certain characters tend to pop on screen."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xeqsj,victoriascissorhands,13,Fri Feb 27 23:43:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's a great movie. They could definitely incorporate that idea. The Murder House and Asylum felt like living, breathing presences compressing down on their inhabitants, splitting them open at their weakest points and letting all the crazy out. They represented the unconscious terrors and powers dwelling in us - both terrifying but also liberating. I'd like to see the Hotel have that sort of presence, almost alive, trapping its inhabitants so they must face their fears.  Hotels have a feeling of isolation and temporariness.  a kind of transient state, neither here nor there. Not at home, but not homeless either. Your identity becomes a bit more fluid (which is why people carry on affairs there) You are pressed up to strangers (literally separated by a thin wall) which puts you on edge but is also exciting and novel."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xc499,Zinthaniel,51,Fri Feb 27 09:13:21 2015 UTC,"In other words, those ruing her inclusion and her integral role in the upcoming season have really no reason to doubt her.   I mean just her music persona alone is theatrical. She, like an actress, knows how to transform into other characters convincingly."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xc499,Gogohax,37,Fri Feb 27 09:17:30 2015 UTC,"I dont doubt her acting skills, I doubt the writers ability to nonchalantly include her into the show. NPH is a good actor but he and Dave sucked shit in season 4 and it wasn't even their faults. The writers of AHS have a tendency to shoehorn pop culture celebrities into the show and thinking that's all they have to do is include them and the show will magically be good, which is not the case. What I'm afraid of is that it'll basically be ""Here's Lady Gagas character, look its Lady Gaga, on our show, here she is doing cool looking stuff that's completely irrelevant to the plot or development but hey its Gaga!"""

The last three seasons of American Horror story have featured musical numbers and while I'm by no means a fan of them I feel like a lot of people are going to unfairly blame Gaga for this if there's one when really it's just a fact of American Horror story
AmericanHorrorStory,2xc499,oscarguy484,1 point,Mon Mar 2 14:59:13 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, and I was probably too vague, but what I was essentially meaning was that if they find excuses to make her sing, it will be easy to write her off as a gimmick. Imo, they don't deserve the benefit of the doubt, given how ""poppified"" they were last season with the music, and that wouldn't be fair to her.   In season 2 the music was PERFECT,  given how it contrasted how horrible everything else was going on, season 3 probably wasn't needed, but being a Stevie Nicks fan I loved it, and last season they went for too many contemporary songs for the excuse of ""they sang all the time in  shows back then"" to hold water.   It's a horror show, showing music for the sake of showing it is a bit hacky, and introducing a well known singer when that has become your trend isn't going to inspire much belief that horror is the main basis for the show"

In the first season I could agree yeah, but it's veered off far more in the direction of a straight up drama with some elements of Horror.  And to be honest most of it's ""horror"" comes from gore rather than true scares"

I'm hoping that they can either write her something she can believably portray or figure out how to edit her scenes so it seems like she's good"
AmericanHorrorStory,2xc499,Tobias_you_blowhard,31,Fri Feb 27 11:18:28 2015 UTC,"Snl is a joke show, it's not supposed to be real acting. Machete Kills was supposed to be super cheesy.

I'm just hoping they don't shove her into the role of a movie star staying at the hotel. I'd like to see her portray somebody who isn't all glitz and glam, she's already like that 98% of the time."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xc499,cowheart,12,Fri Feb 27 17:42:24 2015 UTC,This a million times. Have you seen any of her music videos? Most of them could be elongated to like feature films. I do enjoy her music profoundly but I've always considered her a performance artist. I feel like this will fit her like a glove.

So you could get emotionally invested while actually learning what some characters a truly like. Too many characters and you just remember simple things, even with the flashbacks going in depth the length of there time makes it hard to pick a winner. the last season was like that, and i couldn't get passed the heads."

AmericanHorrorStory,2xft1g,jhunt0,-3,Sat Feb 28 08:20:33 2015 UTC,"JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, ANOTHER MOIRA QUESTION!  I AM ABOUT TO LOSE MY GODDAMN MIND!  First of all, “Murder House” started in October 2011.  It is now 20-motherfucking-15.  It’s been almost four goddamn years since the show came out.  I can practically guarantee you there is no question or concept you can come up with about “Murder House” that hasn’t already been picked to death in this sub.  A quick, simple search would’ve shown you that everybody and their mother has already asked about Moira.  Did everyone here just collectively decide to skip the day in English class where symbolism and metaphors were discussed?  If something isn’t spelled out to you in giant fucking neon letters on a highway billboard, is it just an utter mystery?!  We are gathered here today to lay to rest all the mystery of Moira O’-fucking-Hara as a character because I’m going to spell it out in the simplest terms possible.  This response might as well be posted on r/exlainlikeimfive.  In 1983, Moira worked as maid/housekeeper for Constance and her first husband Hugo.  Hugo had a one-time fling with Moira.   She admitted to feeling lonely at the time, but she realized she had made mistake.  Hugo wanted another go and was in the process of raping Moira when Constance shot them.  Like every other person who has died in the Murder House since the Montgomery’s in the 20s, Moira and Hugo’s souls/spirits/essences/whatever-the-fuck-you-want-to-call-it were preserved in the house as ghosts.    Moira’s two appearances come from the concept of how men and women can view the same person in different lights.  Constance would never have hired Moira if she thought it would result in her husband having an affair.  You don’t hire someone if you think they’re going to fuck your spouse.  That’s why old Moira is the one with the messed up eye.  Constance was shooting the person she thought was her friend, someone she could rely on.  Constance saw Moira as someone trustworthy, much like how Vivien only saw Moira as an elderly woman.  These appearances are not something Moira can control.  This is proven when Violet sees Moira (as an old woman) sitting in Ben’s lap.   Moira had no idea Violet was there until it happened.  ‘But then why is she old?’ you might ask.  She isn’t.  She doesn’t fucking age.  None of the ghosts in the house do.  The elderly side of Moira’s appearance is the old part of her soul.  Even though she may have been hot while she was alive, Moira wasn’t a bimbo.  Over the course of the show, Moira has conversations with Vivien about philosophy, literature, and medical health.  That proves she’s more than just a foxy thing in a short skirt and a garter belt.  She’s intelligent, she can hold a conversation.  She’s complex, she’s multi-faceted.  Or at least she was until people started posting about her endlessly."

It could also be because I'm mesmerized by the way that Angela Bassett says ""bullshit.""  But I think the moment that made me laugh the hardest was either ""KNOTTY PINE!?!?"" or when Fiona tells Delphine that there have been African American poet laureates and Delphine hisses ""LIIIIIIIIIIIES!""

AmericanHorrorStory,2xe9a1,blaqkaudioxd,8,Fri Feb 27 22:22:00 2015 UTC,I hope there is no singing. I barely made it through Freak Show.
AmericanHorrorStory,2xe9a1,davis98,4,Sat Feb 28 03:20:40 2015 UTC,"Considering they literally changed the plots of later episodes to cut out the music, I don't think they'll go that route again."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xe9a1,Blatboy,2,Sat Feb 28 00:50:45 2015 UTC,I agree..maybe one solid performance throughout the season or occasional highlights of rehearsals if its in the storyline..but I'd rather it stick to the storyline like in asylum and murderhouse!
AmericanHorrorStory,2xe9a1,bwood16,2,Sat Feb 28 00:02:11 2015 UTC,Lmao. What fucking time was taken from Freakshow?
AmericanHorrorStory,2xe9a1,iamtomm,2,Sat Feb 28 22:53:38 2015 UTC,"The musical numbers, especially ""Come as You Are"" were just too much last season. I really liked Heroes and especially Life on Mars, but other than that, it just felt too much like horror glee. I agree, I think they learned their lesson about the musical numbers because they took out Kathy Bates' number and a few others. Just because Lady Gaga is a singer doesn't mean she has to sing on AHS. Hopefully they use Gaga as a vehicle for some real mind bending horror next season. I'm cautiously optimistic, especially interested in seeing what they will do with the hotel theme."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xe9a1,DressingOfRanch,1 point,Sun Mar 1 17:32:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly think, like Rihanna, Gaga wouldn't be into playing musical acting roles. Nothing she's done so far would suggest that.   Rihanna has always said she would never want to play a pop star or sing in her acting projects because that's a part of her life. More specially playing Rachel Marron in the Bodyguard, it wouldn't have been a challenge for her. I suspect it's the same with Gaga.   And anyway I'm sure they would have heard the fans voices when they said there was too much music in Freakshow.   The Name Game was genius, Seven Wonders was fabulous but there were too many sub par ""performances"" in Freak Show"

AmericanHorrorStory,2xajfj,nativekitten,1 point,Sat Feb 28 23:35:47 2015 UTC,"First off, they aren't going to base an entire season of a movie. The top hat was just a clue as to the premise, not the entire plotline of Season 5. Also, The setting of London is completely irrelevant. It's a hotel. I'm sure Ryan Murphy wasn't digging that deep like ""Well London isn't America so that might confuse people."" You are way overthinking it, which exactly what Ryan Murphy wants. An answer so simple that it makes people like you dig into every little detail even though the answer is right at surface level."
AmericanHorrorStory,2xajfj,mrrobopuppy,0,Fri Feb 27 01:00:30 2015 UTC,"It might not have to do with season 5 at all.

But I love the idea of him being Dandy's brother. I always wanted them to be related somehow because they both made their seasons IMO. :)"

I've lost faith in the show to really dig into these horror tropes anymore."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x9vda,ahsfan666,5,Thu Feb 26 20:53:54 2015 UTC,I want to see an actor that previously had a minor role return. Like suddenly we see the albino dude from Coven as a bellhop.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x9vda,davis98,8,Thu Feb 26 22:21:36 2015 UTC,"I've had a few ideas since this announcement, but the one that I like most is a sort of ""princess and the pauper"" storyline with Lady Gaga.  A famous movie star comes to stay at the hotel.  While there, she discovers a maid who looks just like her.  They decide to switch places.  The celebrity is tired of being followed by photographers and having no private life.  The maid is sick of working her fingers to the bone and barely scraping by.  So they swap lives.  But things go off the rails.  The celebrity realizes she hates being ""normal.""  She gets none of the respect/pampering she's gotten accustomed to.  Meanwhile, the maid loves being famous a little too much.  She develops an addiction to drugs and becomes paranoid about being the best and staying on top.  The two women meet in secret once more.  The movie star wants her old life back.  The maid refuses.  There's a struggle and suddenly the movie star is dead on the floor.  The maid hides the body and continues on with the life she has stolen.  What I'm really looking forward to is Gaga's character and where she fits in with the world.  And if her character dies, you KNOW it's going to be something crazy!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x9vda,signu1230,7,Thu Feb 26 23:28:56 2015 UTC,"As far as casting goes I would like to see Kathy Bates, Finn Wittrock, Dennis O'Hare, Danny Huston, patti lupone, Evan peters, james Cromwell, angela Bassett, lily rabe and sarah Paulson.  I know a lot of these actors have other commitments going on but those are my personal favorites.  Can't really speculate on who they would play for the simple fact that I only know the theme and that the storyline but if we're going to be creative I think it would be cool if James Cromwell and Kathy Bates played an old married couple who run a haunted hotel...Evan peters could play there troubled son who makes appearances to the hotel and stalks the visitors..Finn Wittrock could play a bartender at the hotel or maybe a security guard who is lily raves love interest.. of some sort...I really don't know LOL the suspense for the season is killing me though!!"

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,Tobias_you_blowhard,36,Wed Feb 25 16:50:00 2015 UTC,She had a small part in Sin City 2 which was actually a pretty decent role for her.  Here's the scene for those interested  EDIT: Totally forgot about this but she was in Machete Kills too! Also highly recommended!

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,CherryLax,16,Wed Feb 25 17:44:21 2015 UTC,I'm also pretty sure Monster is about A BIG ASS DICK. STANLEY WAS A HINT TO SEASON FIVE.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,anandamidetrip,3,Wed Feb 25 20:20:45 2015 UTC,Monster is about Lady Gaga being raped. :'(
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,DanyaRomulus,5,Wed Feb 25 23:11:28 2015 UTC,"No Monster is about her being afraid of attachment, and its actual meaning is about a dude with a BIG ASS DICK. Swine, however, is about rape."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,lasagnaestranja,4,Thu Feb 26 00:13:44 2015 UTC,Wow yeah that's crazy
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,MultiTwentyOne,46,Thu Feb 26 02:39:59 2015 UTC,"I'm sure she's better than most people would expect but I don't think I'll be able to wrap my head around seeing ""Lady Gaga"" in the opening credits."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,punkbrad7,64,Wed Feb 25 20:32:59 2015 UTC,Hopefully she'll be credited as Stephani Germanotta.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,neutronstarneko,28,Wed Feb 25 17:07:15 2015 UTC,I think in all of her fairly recent cameos she's credited as Lady Gaga so it's probably unlikely
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,Maeby78,4,Wed Feb 25 17:11:52 2015 UTC,It only makes sense to help sell her music as well.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,whokilledmurph,4,Wed Feb 25 17:34:10 2015 UTC,"Her other actual straight up acting role had her credited as Lady Gaga, so it's probably just her preference.  As far as I know, she really only goes by Stephani to her close friends out of the public spotlight; she's definitely not the only one to do that."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,EliSon,6,Wed Feb 25 20:10:06 2015 UTC,"I hope they will just use Gaga as in the announcement vid, find it pretty powerful to be honest."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,chirgalfrog,5,Wed Feb 25 19:41:26 2015 UTC,I suppose it's her job to change that opinion.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,EasternZone,28,Wed Feb 25 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"This is going to be very good for the show or very bad. I'm going to stay tuned, for sure"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,mcgani,6,Wed Feb 25 19:29:20 2015 UTC,"It will definitely be either really good or really bad, or just ok."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,mariespunk,2,Wed Feb 25 16:51:30 2015 UTC,Could even swing slightly one way or the other
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,maskedhero,50,Wed Feb 25 23:53:38 2015 UTC,"Lady Gaga is a Jack of all trades and I think she'll be a great addition to the cast. I'm not a big fan of her's or anything, but this news definitely has me pumped. If her Oscars performance taught viewers anything, it's that she has much more to offer than most people think."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,ihate_myusername,33,Thu Feb 26 00:19:46 2015 UTC,"Every time Elsa referred to the freaks as ""her monsters"" last season, Lady Gaga immediately jumped to mind. I never expected she would actually be cast though! I thought it just fit in with the theme of referencing music stars who were self-professed ""freaks"""
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,christinax,18,Wed Feb 25 17:03:40 2015 UTC,"Me too! She even said ""little monsters"" a few times (I believe) which is exactly what Lady Gaga calls her fans."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,yhiv,25,Wed Feb 25 17:58:50 2015 UTC,American Horror Story: Hotel. So much potential with this.  Kinda bummed it's not the apocalypse setting a lot of people were hoping for though.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,autowikibot,4,Wed Feb 25 18:51:45 2015 UTC,I think Apocalypse would make for the perfect final season. Bring back the little antichrist from Season 1 and complete the loop. The show comes full circle and ends with everybody dead.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,punkbrad7,7,Wed Feb 25 16:58:26 2015 UTC,"I can't listen to the video because I'm out without headphones, but a hotel feels like it could be a setting for anything? Like a hotel could be a pretty decent place for survivors of nuclear war/epidemic/natural disaster/et cetera for a large group of people to convene/try to survive/build some sort of community."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,wish_to_conquer_pain,30,Wed Feb 25 22:45:04 2015 UTC,"The MO of the show so far has always been to feature 'classic'/traditional American horror tropes and stories/settings: a haunted house, a school shooting, witch burning, an oppressive asylum, a travelling freak show. Just based on what they've done so far I think a HH Holmes style murder hotel or even a Shining style haunted hotel are both more likely than a more modern fantastical setting like a post-apocalyptic world.   Could be wrong, though, and kind of hope I am; I think a Cold War nuclear-war setting full of fallout and radiation sickness could be fascinating, as could a plague theme.  I would really love to see a scenario where the United States is ravaged by disease and radiation, 99% of the population dying. With the cities barren and vacated, and the people traumatised, lives destroyed, cults rise up and become successful. 20 years on, the people who have grown up in this world, lifelong members of Jessica Lange's/Lady Gaga's cult, are shocked when the US is deemed safe again and people/troops/settlers/??? from foreign countries begin arriving and trying to establish a new society there. That would be a fascinating story, and while it's far from traditional/classic, you could easily fill it with American themes like the Cold War, doomsday cults,  etc. Maybe the hotel could be a gigantic LA skyscraper hotel like the Westin Bonaventure which is occupied by a cult with the bizarre charismatic-tyrant leader on the top floor."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,punkbrad7,7,Wed Feb 25 18:02:20 2015 UTC,"H. H. Holmes:       Herman Webster Mudgett (May 16, 1861 – May 7, 1896), better known under the name of Dr. Henry Howard Holmes, was one of the first documented serial killers in the modern sense of the term.   In Chicago at the time of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, Holmes opened a hotel which he had designed and built for himself specifically with murder in mind, and which was the location of many of his murders. While he confessed to 27 murders, of which nine were confirmed, his actual body count could be as high as 200.  He brought an unknown number of his victims to his World's Fair Hotel from the Columbian Exposition, which was held in Jackson Park some five kilometers (three miles) to the east.

I would love to see Gaga as a manager or like a maid or something as the lead.  OR.....  As overdone as it is, think how awesome it would be for the story to be a haunted hotel with a ""Paranormal Investigation Team"" looking into it, with flashbacks to what they were looking into at the time."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy,3,Thu Feb 26 03:04:07 2015 UTC,I just want to know what time period this season will take place in. You can't run a successful murder hotel these days thanks to those meddling consumer review websites. TripAdvisor is a dream killer.

Also I have Hotel California stuck in my head, and it's driving me crazy because of the line ""You can check in anytime you like / buy you can never leave!"" kinda fits AHS: Murder House."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,bwood16,3,Thu Feb 26 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"I keep imagining the voice on the coven promos singing ""there is a house in New Orleans...."" But only with Gaga singing all creepy-like ""you can check in any time you'd like... But you can't ever leave.."""
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,teresathebarista,11,Wed Feb 25 20:04:53 2015 UTC,Hm...this seems like it could be interesting. A hotel seems like a very claustrophobic place for a whole season but I like that kind of feel in a horror setting.   I won't judge Gaga until I actually see her on the show.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,falconbox,5,Thu Feb 26 08:08:31 2015 UTC,"So did murder house...or an asylum for that matter.  ""Hotel"" could really mean anything."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,Tobias_you_blowhard,5,Wed Feb 25 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"Ok, I am cautiously optimistic about the hotel theme, but Lady Gaga..idk. I seem to be in the minority here, but I just fail to see what the pop singer will bring to ahs is terms of both quality acting ability and horror. I could deal with a small cameo, but a starring role has me very concerned. Stevie Nicks' Coven cameo was unnecessary and the musical numbers in Freakshow added nothing to the show (except Life on Mars, which I loved.) I just cannot deal with any more musical numbers in AHS. This is not glee, this is an Emmy winning horror anthology series, so I don't see how bringing in Lady Gaga is a good thing.. There are so many excellent, talented actors already on the show who deserve the starring role. Lady Gaga is just a gimmick to boost the ratings. So idk :/   Sorry for bitching. I will absolutely 100% be watching anyways, because I want to atleast give it a chance"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,MsMNnice,2,Wed Feb 25 19:31:56 2015 UTC,I agree with you 1000%.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,EmptyStar12,14,Thu Feb 26 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"wow... I am speechless (in a good way). This casting took me completely by surprise! Ryan Murphy keeps impressing me with his great casting choices, as per usual. Very much looking forward to see Lady Gaga in AHS, I'm fairly sure she will be great and can't wait to see her in action."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,unicorns69ng,7,Thu Feb 26 19:16:36 2015 UTC,Now all they need is good writing...
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,teresathebarista,13,Wed Feb 25 17:27:37 2015 UTC,"Really glad she's blowing up again! And maybe this means next season will be more dark and surreal, David Lynch-style."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,thelastdancer,14,Thu Feb 26 00:26:47 2015 UTC,I'm actually excited to see what Gaga brings to AHS. I CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,Henry_Burris,9,Wed Feb 25 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"I have no qualms against lady gaga, her music's cool and I liked her Oscars preformance, and I'm sure he'll be fine in the role.    But a starring role? That's too much imo. I'd begrudgingly accept her with a smaller cameo role or something, but a lead role? Too much. The show's already been criticized by part of the fanbase for turning into this ridiculously oversaturated and over-the-top production recently, and this is definitely gonna add fuel to this argument."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,BlackSparkle13,5,Wed Feb 25 17:24:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really think its a slap in the face to Kathy, Angela and Francis to hire some singer to fill Jessica Langes shows instead of one of his already hired talents."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,ProfUzo,2,Wed Feb 25 20:47:08 2015 UTC,Thank you! When they introduced Angela Bassett in Coven I assumed they were setting her up to take over the starring role when Jessica left.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,punkbrad7,2,Wed Feb 25 22:13:57 2015 UTC,But why exactly does that means she is replacing Jessica?
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,LittleRed88,18,Thu Feb 26 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"The show has already turned into the pop version of horror the last 2 seasons, so I'm skeptical"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,mansonfamily,0,Wed Feb 25 22:19:31 2015 UTC,"I'm really pretty bummed about this. I didn't like the singing being added in at all because on a horror show, that shit doesn't belong there.    And honestly, I can't stand Lady Gaga. I might be out next season."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,Fairylin01,12,Wed Feb 25 17:47:48 2015 UTC,"A very fitting addition. As much as i'm sad that Lange won't be returning, i'm excited to see what new blood casting Ryan can bring."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,joeq1159,3,Thu Feb 26 02:06:31 2015 UTC,"I also really want to see her interact with such equally big voices and scenery gobbling as Frances Conroy and Kathy Bates. If they use her right, she'll fit right in."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,TheStarsDescent,3,Wed Feb 25 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"Murder House has been my favorite so far and IMO more solid (overall plot, story telling, fear factor) than the other seasons. (Please don't kill me Asylum buffs, it's my close close second.) So if Hotel is anything like MH or if they're going back to their roots, I'm all for it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,joeq1159,17,Wed Feb 25 19:38:31 2015 UTC,Losing. My. Shit. This is HUGE and SO COOL I CANT HANDLE IT.

I would even go as far as to say I dislike most of her music, but I'm willing to give her a chance. I'm a little worried though, there are some really talented actors on the show so I hope she can step up to the plate."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,takev9393,12,Wed Feb 25 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen of her acting ability in the past... she will certainly be better than Emma Roberts and Gabourey Sidibe (who I adore but seemed like she was reading off cue cards in Coven).  So I think that she'll be able to hold her own.  I mean, we put up with Emma Roberts' bland acting all through Freakshow... personally, I can deal with Gaga for this next installment."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,falloutforari,8,Wed Feb 25 18:19:31 2015 UTC,And if it doesn't work out you can kill her off inexplicably and never talk about it again or address it in any way.

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,GigglebangsRiceball,9,Wed Feb 25 20:31:22 2015 UTC,OH MY GAGAAAA.  I am thrilled! I wonder if they are going to take a Stephen King or a Twilight Zone approach? It should be great guys!
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,snowiscold,12,Wed Feb 25 17:00:14 2015 UTC,"If this is going to be another musical season, as huge a fan I am of AHS, I sadly will not be watching this. It was barely tolerable in Freak Show.  Edit: Then again, Lady Gaga's performance at the Oscar's did blow me away. So, maybe i'll give my favorite show a fair chance. :-)"

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,GingerbreadKlansman,6,Wed Feb 25 19:09:24 2015 UTC,I am pretty excited to see how she does but I also hope that hotel isn't filled with musical numbers. Freak Show had a little too much singing for my taste.

I'm only a few episodes in, but there doesn't really seem to be any supernatural forces.

Her acting (I think) is just as up to par with her talent in singing! Videos like Marry The Night, her Jo Calderone performance at the VMAS... how could you NOT think she's got a knack for it?! I have super high hopes for this season, especially with this much eerier setting! And if there are musical numbers... then that's just a plus for me. I don't know why, but I just love them! Now all I'm holding on to hope for is Jessica Lange making at least small appearances rather than a huge one (seeing as there's been talks of her ""leaving"".)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4iz5,LiteCoinProphet,2,Wed Feb 25 23:08:27 2015 UTC,"Lady Gaga is a musician, not an actress. Everyone who likes this show better hope that she is actually very good, has very good coaching, or that the writing can pick up the slack.

AmericanHorrorStory,2x6x9l,SuzieG,-7,Thu Feb 26 03:52:09 2015 UTC,He was also a Kindergarden teacher. I know it's AHS subreddit but it's really inappropriate to mock somebody's death just because they played a character on a show.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6x9l,Slopbear,4,Fri Feb 27 07:49:53 2015 UTC,Who is mocking his death? This is an article about something really nice that he has done. He saved people's lives. What are you on about? I did not know he was a teacher. That makes him an even cooler guy.  What is it with you people lately?

AmericanHorrorStory,2x64f6,lurkingphoenix,18,Wed Feb 25 23:32:41 2015 UTC,"I also want to see Frances in a lead role. In my opinion, she is phenomenal every season. A lot of characters have one season that outshines the others. She has a broad acting range and is consistently great."

I can't see Area 51/Operation Top Hat happening this season. Also not sure what Lady Gaga will bring to the table. Please for the love of christ no more musical numbers!
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4mna,2manygigs,1 point,Thu Feb 26 00:33:19 2015 UTC,"I would be pleasantly surprised if Holmes is a key feature; one of the most fascinating serial killers of all time. I don't have faith in Murphy though, not after the past couple of seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4mna,mrignatiusjreily,5,Thu Feb 26 03:26:58 2015 UTC,"I just hope this season takes place in a different time period. Season 1 and 3 were present time, and season 2 and 4 were in the 50's/60's. I think it'd be so cool to have something set in the 1800's or something."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4mna,bwood16,6,Thu Feb 26 05:47:30 2015 UTC,"Ryan Murphy continues to show his genius and remain true to  the show's title  AMERICAN horror story. I know it's been said plenty of times already, but as a huge Hitchcock fan and a scholar of Kubrick, I for one am ecstatic about this seasons theme in hopes that it will pay tribute to both Psycho and The Shinning, arguably the two greatest American Horror Films. Now television and American Horror Story have their opportunity to tell  a story in one of the scariest places  in the world for many people, a hotel ( motel in Norman Bates case). I can't wait to see how RM incorporates the various styles and techniques of creating horror used by Kubrick and Hitchcock in this upcoming season.   Edit: I love the HH Holmes angle as well. By far one of the most disturbing and terrifying serial killers in American History. And FYI many pictures portraying Holmes show him in a TOPHAT. I'd  love it if RM could somehow bring a character of that nature into the show. He could be the natural, real life villain to compliment the  supernatural villain (maybe? Maybe  anti-hero?) who I've read from casting rumors will be the ghost of a girl from the 20's that will be possessing GaGa's character. It may be difficult considering the time period in which HH Holmes was active if in fact this season takes place in the present, but it's certainly doable and if anybody can put it together right  it's RM."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4mna,str713gzr,3,Thu Feb 26 09:27:46 2015 UTC,"Of course, we're just assuming ghosts. They haven't confirmed ghosts yet.  EDIT: Just saw the casting call. Ghosts confirmed."

So that's out in my mind, unfortunately. Real ""American horror stories"" that featured hotels would be the Biltmore and the Cecil, so perhaps one of those? I started thinking about Elisa Lam, and then the Hotel California song...so many possibilities. This is too much to chew on."

SO a combination of the two is an absolute winner for me, as long as she doesn't accidentally fuck it all up! Hotel seems a very plain title, which makes me think it's either gonna be super good (Murder House) or super lame (Coven). I think it's gonna be more The Shinning, fairly similar to Hostel series of films, perhaps. I imagine that aliens might turn up at some point on the way, but beyond that, I think it'll be your standard AHS type deal.  Anyway, Lady Gaga and Evan Peters? I'm SO glad it's only on once a week!"

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4mna,Mathy16,2,Thu Feb 26 19:46:54 2015 UTC,"Name is a little underwhelming. But sometimes its best to keep the expectations low, so we shall see.  Thinking of it now there are a lot of clues to this. There are the freaks that are viewed as ""monsters"" and Elsa who takes them in and tells them how beautiful and fantastic they are for just being themselves (Mother Monster). Elsa was also a singer with a crazy performance art element (the freaks) to her work. She wore over-done makeup and gender-bended (with the blue suit she performed in). She had big Hollywood dreams and when she finally left the freak show, she was heartbroken she couldn't take her wardrobe. I think there's a lot of Gaga in there.  I don't think it has anything to do with Aliens. Remember, this was kind of done already in season 2. I do think though that the idea of a hotel with a lot of guests coming and going allows for a lot more guest-stars (ala Patti LuPone, NPH, etc.) and more of a non-linear plotline, throwing us back to the construction of season 1. I like it :)"

That being said, I can't believe the gall of Murphy to think he can do it justice. The people saying he should replicate The Shining is ridiculous. He would never do it justice, Kubrick himself had to use all his talent to make the movie we love, and Murphy is no Kubrick. Psycho already has its series, Bates Motel. So where the hell is Ryan going to go with this? Call me negative, but what a horrendous theme after a mediocre season at best. Should have gone for something original, he will never live up to the expectations of the classics here. Very disappointed."

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,megdonalds,38,Wed Feb 25 16:32:46 2015 UTC,My hope is that it will take place during the early 1900s. Similar to Disney's Tower of Terror. Gaga has the jazz chops to be a performer during that time.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,Kendow,25,Wed Feb 25 16:50:57 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for a season about H. H. Holmes, America's first serial killer with a ""hotel of terror"""

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,stephwilson,2,Thu Feb 26 01:40:20 2015 UTC,Yes that was the point
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,chattypenguin,21,Thu Feb 26 02:15:19 2015 UTC,Pleasantly surprised at the theme! I am really hoping Gaga will be on longer than just 1 or 2 episodes (a la Adam Levine in Asylum). has the potential to be pretty great.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,SilverKnot,7,Wed Feb 25 16:49:20 2015 UTC,She is going to be one of the leads which is great!  I think she is going to pull off ala-True Detective where she will just appear one season but with a starring role.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy,8,Wed Feb 25 16:56:52 2015 UTC,EW confirmed she is a part of the main cast
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,victorbelli,2,Wed Feb 25 16:59:09 2015 UTC,Yeah hopefully that means she sticks around for most/all of the season!
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,SilverKnot,15,Wed Feb 25 18:41:30 2015 UTC,If this means shes in season 5 I'm going to piss I'm so excited

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,mejj,21,Wed Feb 25 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"At first I thought it was a promo for something she was doing that was AHS themed but it looks legit -- Season 5 could be American Horror Story: Hotel!  This is a great theme with so many different options: famous people who stayed there, suicides, hauntings, showing the hotel in its current state VS other time periods (a la Murder House)...  UPDATE  Entertainment Weekly has confirmed GaGa will be a main cast member."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,DA-numberfour,6,Wed Feb 25 16:39:19 2015 UTC,Ryan Murphy just retweeted it. I guess that's a confirmation.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,DA-numberfour,6,Wed Feb 25 16:34:19 2015 UTC,I really hope it's based on Murder Castle. That would make my LIFE.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,asliceofkiwi,7,Wed Feb 25 16:54:57 2015 UTC,This would play into the top hat clue. H.H. Holmes is believed by some to be the same person as Jack The Ripper.

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4is9,baileath,2,Wed Feb 25 17:01:37 2015 UTC,I'm with you! Stick to a (hopefully better than freak show) story! Cut the filler episodes and make the payoff worthwhile.

I'm ready to get back to the tone of those seasons. Also, I feel like Coven and Freak Show lacked shocking twists, which made the plot seem a little weak to me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5cvr,ryang805,15,Wed Feb 25 21:48:37 2015 UTC,Asylum was a great mix between sexy and fucked up.

AmericanHorrorStory,2x5cvr,Soccerdweebz,5,Wed Feb 25 23:45:28 2015 UTC,I thought of the Hotel episode of Doctor Who and got really excited. A horror version of that would be amazing.

AmericanHorrorStory,2x5cvr,israeldmo,7,Thu Feb 26 19:51:16 2015 UTC,Freak Show wasn't exactly campy.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5cvr,S31A,24,Wed Feb 25 20:49:02 2015 UTC,"yes it was. It had darker subject material but it was still totally campy in the writing. Characters were so dramatic and extreme, none felt like real people like Ben or Vivien did, they were just sort of charicatures of 50's people and carnies. It was a good season but it was extremely campy because it wasn't realistically written."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5cvr,mrrobopuppy,9,Wed Feb 25 22:39:53 2015 UTC,"Freak Show was a pretty middle-ground season between the campiness of Coven and the horror of Asylum. It definitely fell more towards campiness toward the end but Twisty was a great villain and I wish he stayed longer. It had some really good episodes that, imo, makes it better than the straight camp of Coven"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5cvr,Cduns112,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:42:50 2015 UTC,"You touched on a point that I think explains part of the contrast between seasons 1&2 and 3&4. That being the characters from the first two (especially MH) were much more realistic/relatable than the previous two. Seeing the characters as average, vulnerable Americans allows for empathy and therefore the horror aspect has that much more of an impact. I truly hope the campiness is left out of this season and we get a realisic set of characters like we did in MH."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5cvr,chattypenguin,2,Thu Feb 26 03:53:45 2015 UTC,Hotels are interesting because its this place where people do forbidden things that they can't do at home. Not to mention the creepiness of an empty hotel. And how weirdly artificial everything seems. I'm excited.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5cvr,Tobias_you_blowhard,3,Fri Feb 27 22:48:47 2015 UTC,"For some reason I feel like a Lovecraftian theme would work really well in a hotel setting. Add in some Lynchian style, and it would be an awesome season."

AmericanHorrorStory,2x5cvr,jonjawnjahnsss,1 point,Thu Feb 26 13:25:05 2015 UTC,Creepy time-related things. Like someone painting a portrait of someone that eventually becomes a resident at the hotel and be like oh that's from 1956. Or make a relationship with a regular character with a guest star and be like where's the old lady from 634? And the girl working the desk being like oh no one has lived in that room in 20 years since a nice old lady was murdered there.  These are super cliché obviously there's probably tropes about them but I was just fantasizing.

I'm not sure when my opinion of her changed -- I always thought she had an amazing voice but somehow, she seemed to be more of a flash in the pan with the meat dress and the over-the-top antics.  Her performance at the Oscars was really amazing and now this?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4qe1,Warlizard,16,Wed Feb 25 18:23:57 2015 UTC,"Well, Lady Gaga has been around for a long time. She was writing songs for other artists years before she started performing herself. I think she did all the crazy outfits at first to get people's attention, while at the same time sending a message that it's okay to be ""weird"". Now that she has a well established career as a performer she can tone it down a lot more and explore differet types of music and entertainment. I'm very excited to see her in the next season."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4qe1,Taylor_Satine,6,Wed Feb 25 18:58:10 2015 UTC,True. And she succeeded in becoming world famous because of it.  I guess time will tell.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4qe1,Warlizard,2,Wed Feb 25 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Everything she's done to this point has made her a well-known performer, and now she has some freedom to be an artist in whichever way she pleases.  I think it's awesome.  Cannot wait for AHS"

This article says that it is 'Hotel,' but I wonder if that is confirmed?  Also, I am really excited to see how she performs in the show.  She has such a wide array of costuming that it's hard to imagine her as 'normal.'  I can see her as being a pretty strong actress, so I'm definitely looking forward to the new season!"

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4yr2,heidismiles,11,Wed Feb 25 19:07:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like this season will have more of a Murder House feel to it. Going back to the straight up haunted house feeling.  Before I read about the casting calls being about an Upstate NY hotel, the very first thing I thought about was the Cecil Hotel in LA for some pretty obvious reasons. Two high-profile serial killers lived there, it's one of the last places Elizabeth Short was seen, and that Canadian student looked like she was possessed in the hotel elevator before being found in the water tank just a couple of years ago."

This video makes me think that Gaga will definitely play Carla (mentioned in the casting call), and that the black mask/cover represents the evil ghost, which is possessing her/taking her over.  The pure white of Gaga and her hair (which we know could be any color) vs the blackness made me immediately think of good vs evil. (Though I doubt Clara will be all ""good"")  Also, the mask looked pretty H.R. Giger-esque to me, but I doubt we'll be seeing aliens again.  Edit: words are hard."

AmericanHorrorStory,2x5c8k,surfinbirdjessie,16,Thu Feb 26 19:09:43 2015 UTC,No one should care about the cast. They need to care about Ryan Murphy not screwing this up and letting it become Coven 2.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5c8k,Capt-Murphy,8,Wed Feb 25 20:09:51 2015 UTC,I have to disagree with you... I think the cast is one of the most important aspects. It's one thing to have good writing but you have to have good actors who can play the character well. I'm not sure if Lady Gaga is much of a TV actress but keep in mind she is a wonderful performer. I have faith she'll bring some of that much needed star quality to this season.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5c8k,sammieshiksa,5,Wed Feb 25 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but none of the cast really acts terribly. Only when they are written terribly do they sound bad."

I absolutely respect yours and everyone else's opinions, the same way I would hope people respect mine.  All I was saying was I'm frustrated with all of the hate, I think too many people try to read between the lines instead of just enjoying the show for what it is, fiction; a magical world where anything can happen and plot holes don't need to be explained.  Every season is different and that's kind of the point, I fully expect people to like some better than others but I feel like instead of dumping all over one in particular people could tune out for that season.

Who are not pop stars on a television show that used to be well known for its amazing cast.   2) He casted Emma Roberts.....  3) I will only tune in if she has a very very very little role where you only see her twice (like that Maroon five douche bag)"

AmericanHorrorStory,2x4tlo,wish_to_conquer_pain,10,Thu Feb 26 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"Gaga could be either Carla or Elle, I see it going either way. Most of the other actresses who fit in that age group are doing other shows this season so I expect another new cast member for whoever Gaga doesn't play.  Evan Peters could be Elle's unstable boyfriend, a return to Tate-like behavior perhaps (maybe connections to murder house in this season)  Finn Wittrock as Danny. Finn has said he wants to play a very different character from Dandy if he was to return.  That being said, I'm expecting this season to be loaded with 'The Shining' references. Possibly 'Psycho' as well"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4tlo,Bane_Meatball,6,Wed Feb 25 18:40:59 2015 UTC,"Psycho, The Shining, 1408...lots of horror hotels to borrow from or pay homage."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4tlo,YesHunty,5,Wed Feb 25 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"Elle is probably going to be a flashback-only character that gets very little screen time, given she's possessing Carla's body. I kinda see them giving this role to Gaga."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4tlo,blahblahblahdkjdfgj,4,Wed Feb 25 21:57:20 2015 UTC,I don't think they'd be auditioning for characters written for already-on-board cast members. These three characters will likely be new additions. Which makes me wonder who's leaving and who's staying.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4tlo,kbslasher88,2,Wed Feb 25 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"Finn definitely fits the article's description of ""a boyish, man."""

AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,ccarsonberry,11,Wed Feb 25 22:12:38 2015 UTC,casting predictions:  carla will probably be either sarah paulson or lily rabe   danny will most likely be evan peters although there's a slight chance it could be finn.   elle will most likely be lady gaga because she loves old-timey style and such and the role will most likely just be a series of flashbacks to the 20s.  what do you guys think and what are your predictions?
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,smellsliketatespirit,11,Wed Feb 25 22:24:32 2015 UTC,I think Danny will be Finn
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,DandySandMan,15,Wed Feb 25 23:10:09 2015 UTC,I hope so. Lately Evan Peters characters seem to fizzle out. He became downright annoying the last two seasons.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,SnackieOnassis,8,Wed Feb 25 23:17:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Love him as an actor but Jimmy was such an annoying, whiney bitch last season. Still wish he died."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,DandySandMan,12,Wed Feb 25 23:21:23 2015 UTC,Its a shame too cause Kit and Tate were both great characters.

AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,ControlBear,0,Sat Feb 28 23:18:58 2015 UTC,Yeah its like Daryl in the Walking Dead. Sexy but not the only reason why I watch. It's just a great bonus.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,TheBaconator666,5,Sun Mar 1 21:57:34 2015 UTC,This is actually a really good prediction with the whole flashback situation! It could turn into something similar they did with Adam Levine.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,tinyshroom,3,Wed Feb 25 23:30:05 2015 UTC,if lily rabe comes back i can see her as elle and gaga as carla!
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,lurkingphoenix,9,Thu Feb 26 00:16:37 2015 UTC,I was set on the idea of the bell boy being Finn and then I remembered Evan Peters. sigh  I think Sarah Paulson will be Elle and lady gaga will be Carla.   I want to see someone (Kathy bates?) as a maid that slowly losses their mind and we get to see her descent into madness.  I also want Frances Conroy to play the owner of the hotel who keeps its dark past a secret.   Edit: I can see Denis O'hare as H.H.Holmes. (In the Halloween special?)
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,lurkingphoenix,3,Wed Feb 25 23:01:16 2015 UTC,"When Ryan Murphy announced the seasons being connected, it would be cool if there was something with the maid from the murder house working here before she came to the murder house."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,RussellManatow,4,Wed Feb 25 23:31:23 2015 UTC,I just remembered this season is set in the present. This ruins my H.H. Holmes theory. I'd prefer for it to be set in the 90's. Sometime recent but not as recent as today.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,tinyshroom,3,Wed Feb 25 23:39:28 2015 UTC,It still could be an anthology based season like murderhouse where it takes place in present AND past times..they could have a current setting that takes place now that and for the halloween episodes flash back to the history of the hotel that could've been built by HH Holmes who could be now haunting the hotel or whatever other storylines they think up!!

She is doing american crime story, and im aware it's anlther of Ryan murphey a show and he can't ez the filming schedules to accommodate adding and pulling off previous members..but this year will be radically different.  I'm thinking Kathy bates, evan peters, lady gaga, Dennis O'Hare, patti lupone and I HOPE LILY RABE.  I dlubt Zachary quinto will return to AHS anymore, based on HIM saying that."

AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,hospitable_peppers,3,Thu Feb 26 09:35:48 2015 UTC,This whole thing just seems very fan-fictiony to me.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5ule,Tobias_you_blowhard,6,Thu Feb 26 15:21:49 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like this ""Carla"" may be modeled after ""Caril"" Fugate. She and her boyfriend Charles Starkweather killed her parents and went on a killing spree. Natural Born Killers movie was based on them.  Also, an earlier movie, ""Badlands"" was made modeled after these two. In the movie, the guy's name was ""Kit""."

AmericanHorrorStory,2x6t8i,uglytwink,3,Thu Feb 26 03:20:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know it's not fake. I'm just saying, interesting to note that it's a bit different now. Especially since Art Deco influence is in the new font (particularly the E is very deco), which is pretty common in 1920s architecture."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6t8i,RussellManatow,1 point,Thu Feb 26 06:04:27 2015 UTC,"Would you say it could be late 1890s architecture, building design to me has similarity's with that and 1920s stuff, but you seem to know what your talking about so what do you think?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6t8i,RussellManatow,1 point,Thu Feb 26 07:22:37 2015 UTC,"Uhm, not really. Art Deco is a very distinctive style and while the font isn't necessarily deliberately Art Deco (though it's derivation from the Charles Remy Macintosh font is notable), the style originated after WWI, in the late 1910s, and was most popular in the U.S. in the late 20s early 30s. I'm not particularly familiar with art and architecture, I'm sorry, I'm just particularly interested in Art Deco and Art Nouveau as movements, which happens to include stuff like this. I'll try and do some more research about architectural styles from like, 1880—1940ish, and see, but my immediate thought was deco."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6t8i,RussellManatow,1 point,Thu Feb 26 08:36:03 2015 UTC,"okay, yeah because the current rumor is that season 5 might be about H.H Holmes and his ""hotel"" in Chicago which like 200 people died, then there was mysterious fires and he was haunted by the devil and whatnot. so just looking for any evidence to corroborate that theory, anyway thanks for your help :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6t8i,Snork_Nork,2,Thu Feb 26 08:44:05 2015 UTC,"Not so much a rumour, but a theory. I personally hope it's not true. I much prefer psychological horror to shock horror, and I feel like Holmes would be a gorefest. I've really enjoyed the move away from shocking, sexualised, and super violent stuff (Personally, Murder House feels weakest to me), and I'd like to see it continue in Hotel. Strong overarching themes, interesting character arcs, some twisted moments, and a healthy dose of vintage horror styling and a little bit of black humour and irony."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x8h2s,perthtemp,8,Thu Feb 26 14:35:41 2015 UTC,"Each season has a different take on the horror genre. Coven was campy/dark comedy, which isn't for everyone. Most are hoping that Hotel goes back to pure horror rather than a drama, thriller, etc."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x8h2s,DrRustles,2,Thu Feb 26 14:56:39 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping hotel is a psychological thriller at least for the first few episodes. I try to forget the previous seasons and just start fresh like it's a new show, it worked for coven and freak show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x8h2s,lurkingphoenix,2,Thu Feb 26 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"If catty bitchiness and dark comedy aren't your thing, there really is no redemption for Coven.  I liked it okay, but it is my least favorite for most of the reasons you stated."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x8h2s,grumblebuzz,2,Thu Feb 26 14:40:54 2015 UTC,"Coven did have some gore, but it really felt more like a teen movie."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x8h2s,greyconcepts,2,Thu Feb 26 18:14:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't think Coven was necessarily bad, I think the individual viewer just has to understand how to interpret the show and what to expect. Asylum and murderhouse tie for my favorite as they both have their own insividual uniqueness.  Where murderhouse was more of a supernatural story with different blends of horror.  Asylum had some supernatural in it but focused more on psychological horror.  Freakshow and coven were both campy..where coven was more comedic relief witcha decent storyline, I felt it lacked in overall substance.  Freakshkw had the same comedic value, but was more theatric, obviously since it was a period piece.  I really hope season 5 returns to the vibes of the original 2 seasons!!!!!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,amusebox,29,Wed Feb 25 17:08:21 2015 UTC,I think theres a lot of genuine hints towards this in Freak Show but none of us could ever see this coming because its so damn huge. Top hats off to RM for this im super impressed.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,mansonfamily,5,Wed Feb 25 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"Is this what he meant by people's reactions would be ""that motherfucker"" or something similar?  It makes sense in context and nobody saw Lady Gaga coming."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,HollasaurusRex,6,Wed Feb 25 17:51:32 2015 UTC,"I always thought of Gaga when Elsa referred to the freaks as her monsters, but I never thought it'd be a clue."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,RoachGirl,5,Wed Feb 25 23:58:49 2015 UTC,So is Gaga gonna take Jessica Lange's place as the lead role?! I'm excited. You made a great point! I didn't actually think anything of that.   good catch!
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,cosmicpizza666,13,Wed Feb 25 17:23:20 2015 UTC,"I think she'll play a key part in the story, and may even be the focus, but I doubt she'll take Jessica Lange's role as ""the glue"". This is mainly because it's LG's first huge acting commitment. She may become ""the"" star if she stays on for more seasons though."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,EasternZone,3,Wed Feb 25 17:43:17 2015 UTC,Totally agree. I wish Jessica would've came back. I would love to see a dialogue between her and Gaga. sobs
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,cosmicpizza666,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:29:42 2015 UTC,"Agree. I feel like Jessica Lange truly didn't take her role as ""the glue"" until Coven. She was still a key player in MH, but wasn't quite as important as the Harmons, whereas Sister Jude, Fiona, and Elsa were very very important in their seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,MikiClash,-12,Thu Feb 26 18:25:11 2015 UTC,I think she's replacing Meep.  Meep was cuter.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,bmlangd,2,Wed Feb 25 18:45:23 2015 UTC,"We survived The murder house, we made it out of the Asylum, we protected the coven, attended the freakshow but nobody checks out of the hotel!  I don't think season five will be titled hotel..Think that is just a promo title like in prior seasons when they referred to freak show as carnival or circus before actually dubbing it freakshow.  Also..I have an idea that this season will be another anthology season similar to murder house that takes place in the present as well as past times.  Think this season will be used to connect it to the other seasons as well as tying in storylines with a hotel that could or could not be haunted..a ghost from the 1920s as been mentioned, I think they will Tie in HH Holmes to this season.  For example the timeline could take place in the present but during the Halloween episodes they could flashback to the 1800s when HH Holmes built the hotel in tortured/murdered people in it..some of those victims could potentially go on to haunt the hotel and the current inhabitants of the hotel.  Again this is just MY personal hopes and theory. I think Danny Houston would make an amazing HH Holmes OR Dennis could too!  I really hope to see sarah Paulson, lily rabe, Dennis O'Hare, Evan peters, Finn Wittrock, Kathy bates, patti lupone, taissa..but I doubt we will see emma Roberts, jessica Lange, Sarah will prolly have a limited role due to american crime story..taissa just signed on to a new show..I haven't heard Anythkng as far as angela! What does Everybkdy think??"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,caravax,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:18:28 2015 UTC,Then why all of Elsa's dialogue about her 'little monsters'?
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,caravax,2,Thu Feb 26 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"Because she didn't like calling them freaks none of the people within the group like being labeled as freaks so she referred to them as monsters..The whole purpose of the entire show was about not judging a book by its cover...and one quote from the show that I really liked was ""every monster is human"""
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4no7,davidward94,1 point,Fri Feb 27 03:30:52 2015 UTC,It's still eerily similar to how Lady Gaga refers to her fans as 'little monsters'.

AmericanHorrorStory,2x5kr0,paolocase,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:51:15 2015 UTC,I am so angry that the new season might not be about H. H. Holmes.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x5kr0,DanyaRomulus,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:23:43 2015 UTC,The way they've set up this franchise makes it perfectly tailored for clickbait. It's not going to be about the Garden of Allah Hotel just because it was mentioned once. No clue for the next season has ever been that specific.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4tiz,Trailkeep,3,Wed Feb 25 17:50:24 2015 UTC,were there other Garden of Allah clues besides Stanley's reference and the Dietrich connection?
AmericanHorrorStory,2x4tiz,ewhitney,1 point,Wed Feb 25 18:38:27 2015 UTC,I think it was mentioned in the finale too.

AmericanHorrorStory,2x72d4,brucewaynes,2,Thu Feb 26 03:58:51 2015 UTC,"When I heard it, I immediately thought of H.H. Holmes and his ""murder castle"", too. I do hope he makes an appearance."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x72d4,xMermistax,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:31:40 2015 UTC,"If its going to be about a hotel, maybe we'll get a vampire tie in? Most of the story would be happening at night I imagine, since thats when most guests spend their time at a hotel. Just think of all the poor innocent newly weds! MUHAHAHAHA! But I agree H.H. Holmes would be a PERFECT fit for a Hotel-season."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x72d4,kikikyami,1 point,Sat Feb 28 17:41:28 2015 UTC,"I thought of that too. In fact I thought of it back with the top hat. He wore a top hat. I could see it. Secret torture rooms.   The only problem is HH Holmes was in Chicago. They kept mentioning the Garden Of Allah in Freak Show. Which was a famous hotel in Calif back in the day. It was demolished in 1957. Big stars use to frequent it. Towards the end though, it went down and stars were going to another, more private, hotel.  It was said the Garden Of Allah was frequented by transients at the end there.   I kind of wonder if we are going to see something like the movie Hostel. It was a twisted movie about wealthy men bidding on kidnapped women...then going to this Hostel to kill them. Hostel in German, is Hotel."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6hd1,anandamidetrip,6,Thu Feb 26 01:03:40 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion: Honestly? I'm not that excited about Gaga, just because I don't think throwing big names and stars around is the way to re-invent the show. I'd prefer they'd put more effort into the narrative and plot. I like that the hotel theme seems to be going to integrate different time periods (murder house time-jumping style), but I'm not sold on the idea yet. I'll still give it a chance and who knows, maybe I'll love it"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6hd1,Musain,5,Thu Feb 26 01:34:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I fear that Gaga was cast to draw publicity. Murphy loves his diva's. I really hope she doesn't sing. I know some people are OK with the musical numbers but I just think they should be left off a show that's supposed to try to scare you (I think Glee fans have bleed into this show so its perceived to be a popular opinion outside of reddit).  I'm holding out hoping that they already have the season written (especially since Murphy has a lot of big projects coming up) or that somebody else is lined up to write it (he made Tim Minear head of the writer's room for Asylum only, I wish they would give him the position back)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6hd1,Tesatire,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:03:59 2015 UTC,I like the musical numbers when it's natural. Freak Show seemed like there were a lot of forced numbers though. But I loved Jessica Lange breaking out the name game in Asylum.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6hd1,israeldmo,0,Thu Feb 26 17:00:01 2015 UTC,How can you say they're not putting much effort into the narrative and plot just because Lady Gaga joined the cast?
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6hd1,Musain,2,Thu Feb 26 02:51:48 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Murphy seems to care's more about having fun with his character's rather than developing a structured and cohesive story. I definitely see your point but I wouldn't be surprised if he focused's more on casting than writing at this time."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6hd1,Musain,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:12:41 2015 UTC,I did not say that they're not putting effort into the narrative BECAUSE Lady gaga joined. I said they're not putting much effort because the narrative in Coven and Freak show was for me much sloppier than in seasons 1 and 2
AmericanHorrorStory,2x6hd1,israeldmo,2,Thu Feb 26 20:58:50 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more. I'm hoping Gaga turns out to be a supporting character and actually serve the storylines and not just Lange's publicity-stunt replacement

Hostel I, II, and III. They are very twisted movies. Premise of it is women are kidnapped and taken to this hostel. Very wealthy men then bid on them. Then the man goes there to this hostel and kills the girl any way he wants to. It's like a secret society. One must kill the girl though, to insure nobody ever tells.  I would not be surprised if we see an element of that in AHS Hotel. You'd never look at the word Hotel as ridiculous again."

It also, obviously, depends on her acting skills... in interviews she's weird as hell. If she's the same weird on the show its not going to go down well. It'll end being the Gaga Show.

For example the timeline could take place in the present but during the Halloween episodes they could flashback to the 1800s when HH Holmes built the hotel in tortured/murdered people in it..some of those victims could potentially go on to haunt the hotel and the current inhabitants of the hotel.

In Chicago at the time of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, Holmes opened a hotel which he had designed and built for himself specifically with murder in mind, and which was the location of many of his murders. While he confessed to 27 murders, of which nine were confirmed, his actual body count could be as high as 200.  He brought an unknown number of his victims to his World's Fair Hotel from the Columbian Exposition, which was held in Jackson Park some five kilometers (three miles) to the east.

And in the teaser, Lady Gaga is credited simply as ""Gaga"", while on the poster, she is listed by her full name, Stefani Germanotta.  In addition, the poster lists Sarah Paulson's name first in the credits at the bottom. Posters like this usually list actors in order of ""importance"" (notice how Jessica Lange is listed first on the official Freakshow poster, while Patti Labelle is last). Paulson was confirmed to already be cast in Murphy's new show American Crime Story, which means that if they did fit her in season 5 somehow, she most likely wouldn't have a starring role. And with the absence of prison-themed clues in Freakshow, I have to take Murphy's word for it.  It is a beautifully made teaser poster, and if it wasn't too similar to Asylum, I definitely wouldn't mind a penitentiary theme in the future, though."

For 4 seasons now the licensed and official AHS font has been ""Rennie Makintosh"" The font in her promo is ""Strong Glasgow""  You can get that font for free here: http://www.dafont.com/strong-glasgow.font Why would the producers let her put out a promo that isn't true to the show?  From a business standpoint the last thing you would EVER change about a product would be the font.

Reason #2  Up until yesterday no one had opened their mouths about plans for next season.  STILL no one with any credit has uttered a word about next season.  Ryan Murphy only re-tweeted a video.  That to me means nothing and is simply a nod to Gaga, like saying ""hey that's pretty cool"" but neither Murphy nor Falchuk have gone on the record(as of this minute) to announce her involvement in the shower the concept of ""Hotel"".  I don't doubt that she's IN the show, but I doubt anyone gave her permission to launch her own campaign, and if she IS involved I think she's  gonna get some serious shit for stirring up trouble.  #3  I don't think it's really that unusual for someone to use a stage name for one persona and their real name for another.  When she sings, she's Lady Gaga.  Now that she's going on to acting, her real name might just be more subtable for the task.  The Rock goes by his birth name when he's in films.  I would take a film more seriously based on the soul fact that he's willing to leave his alter-ego behind in order to pursue something he's a little more serious about and use the name Dwayne Johnson.  4  This is Gaga's FIRST serious acting role.  Which is exactly why she's listed at the end of the credits with the very specific words ""introducing Stephani Germanotta"" NOT as the headliner for the show.  5  American Crime Story has more than likely already begun filming.  Which leaves more than enough time for Sarah Paulson to be in AHS when primary photography begins (usually the end of spring/beginning of summer).  Listing the names of cast members by levels of importance is not always the case.  Just because Jessica Lange was listed first in Freakshow does not make her the most important character in the show.  In fact, I would argue that Freakshow was not her story at all.  I would also argue that this past season didn't have a protagonist to speak of.  Whatever.  Argument for another day.  As for the rest of the cast members(especially the new ones listed) I'm super pumped! C'mon, Nebula from Guardians of the Galaxy??  That's awesome! The guy that played Prince Oberon from Game of Thrones?? The dude that played Nucky Thompson's brother in Boardwalk Empire??  (Eli)  sweet!  These are some serious players and if it's all true I think we're all in for some good television.  And why does everyone feel this idea is too similar to Asylum?  I don't see it.  If you're referring to the fact that all the action takes place under one roof, than yes it's a lot like Asylum.  But…  Hasn't that been the case for every season so far?  Murder House took place in a house.  Asylum duh!  Coven took place MOSTLY in the house on Jackson Ave in the garden district of New Orleans, but even New Orleans itself could be considered a single location.  Freak show took place primarily on the grounds of the traveling side show. All of these locations are just that, locations!  And their setting is a pivotal part of telling a story.  That's my rant. I for one think that Gaga's stunt is just that, a stunt.  Another way for her to draw more attention to herself. I desperately hope this poster is real and look forward for some ACTUAL announcements from the producers of the show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x7tg3,suspect86,2,Fri Feb 27 05:56:50 2015 UTC,"Well, your argument is certainly... in a large font.  I'd like to emphasize that Murphy has always left subtle clues to the next season's theme in the one that precedes it. There were multiple references to the Garden of Allah Hotel in Freakshow, which makes the ""Hotel"" theme difficult to question.   Whether or not you consider Murphy's retweet ""official"", I fail to understand why you think an anonymous Reddit user is more credible than the creator of the show itself."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x7tg3,Sneavile,0,Fri Feb 27 08:06:59 2015 UTC,I think I'd rather take the word of an anonymous Reddit user over Lady Gaga.
AmericanHorrorStory,2x7tg3,suspect86,1 point,Fri Feb 27 18:33:24 2015 UTC,"I agree that they wouldn't change their font when doing any promotional items, that is their logo. If we can bring up that the poster could be fan made then can't we say the same for Lady Gaga's video. From a top hat to a bell boy hat seems to be quite a difference too. Wouldn't Gaga be better suited for Freak Show act then a chambermaid in a hotel."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x7tg3,propmasterKK,0,Fri Feb 27 16:06:17 2015 UTC,Is there a source to confirm this?

Hotel is a genre that has been absolutely covered and perfected by Directors 100x more talented than Murphy. Penitentiary would still be a bit close to Asylum, but still far more original for story lines."

AmericanHorrorStory,2x57er,Supreme000,2,Thu Feb 26 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"WARNING: SPOILERS FOR FREAK SHOW AHEAD  Kind of in a different vein, but NO SPOILERS FROM RYAN MURPHY & CO. I like to browse this subreddit and I don't want to avoid it just so I don't read spoilers. Some examples:   When we knew Pepper was going to be in Freak Show When we knew Lily Rabe was coming back as Sister Mary Eunice ""All seasons are connected"" Hyping up Stanley's dick Twisty & Mordrake returning   You get the point. I would LOVE to see more surprises - I would've shit my pants seeing Pepper, Sister Mary Eunice, Twisty at the end of Freak Show, etc. if I hadn't known. I hope S5 has plenty of surprises that he doesn't give away."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x57er,mariespunk,-1,Wed Feb 25 19:54:21 2015 UTC,"I totally disagree. Twisty's storyline was so short and confusing, I'm not sure I would have stuck around unless I knew Twisty would be back. So I was glad to read that he'd be back. I was more disappointed that he came back and nothing more was explained about him.  ""All seasons are connected"" is not a spoiler. We still don't know how they are connected. KNOWING now that they are, makes it fun to try and find the ways and guess at it.  Just because he says something, like Sister Mary Eunice is coming back, does not mean we know what she is going to do. I don't see these as spoilers."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x57er,Supreme000,-1,Thu Feb 26 02:46:22 2015 UTC,"If you stuck around just because of Twisty, no wonder you were disappointed. He was a very minor character, although one of my favorites, and that became glaringly obvious towards episode 3/4. His return was very anti-climatic - I wish RM wouldn't have said he was coming back because it created all this hype over 1 or 2 small lines. I also disagree that his story was short and confusing. I thought it actually tied in nicely and was explained very well. I don't see what else they could've done with that character's back story - we got everything we needed to know. At first I wanted him to stick around longer than 4 episodes because he was so interesting, but then Dandy took over and I loved that.  ""All seasons are connected"": Sure, it's not exactly a spoiler, but he announced it in the middle of the season and it seemed so.. random, especially because this show has been classified as an anthology for 4 seasons. I just don't understand why he felt the need to put such a crazy, random statement that kind of changes the entire show if he wasn't really going to do anything with it but touch on it in 1 episode (""Orphans""). When he said that Lily Rabe was coming back as Sister Mary Eunice, it didn't take much to realize there was going to be an asylum connection especially because Pepper was in ""Freak Show"". I would have much rather not known that Lily Rabe was coming back at all. That episode was already amazing, but it would've been better if it was a surprise."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x57er,mariespunk,0,Thu Feb 26 17:15:37 2015 UTC,"I said ""I'm not sure"" I would have stuck around. I did not say it was the reason I stuck around. Yes, they could have explained more about Twisty. Like why the hell he was wearing someone else's scalp on his head.   All seasons are connected. To me, this is just something Ryan JUST decided to do. I mean he never comes out and reveals these ""hints"" he says are in the shows. The fans just guess at it. Hell, I could tell people Bates Motel is connected to AHS...and I'll bet you fans would start finding connections. It does not mean they were put there. It just means we can connect everything if we look hard enough. Just like finding shapes in clouds.   As far as browsing this subreddit and don't want to see spoilers. I just don't get it. That is what this site and others like it are for. For people to discuss the show.  What would you have people do? Come on here and post ""oh I love the show""....""Oh, me too"".  ???  Why would someone come to this site if they don't want to know anything about the show?  Getting people to talk about it actually promotes the show a bit."

AmericanHorrorStory,2x0jpt,ahsfreakshow,3,Tue Feb 24 18:45:34 2015 UTC,"I like your theory, there's a lot of backing to it and I think you caught a clue nobody else has. The only thing I disagree with is them using the word ""monster"". I think Elsa used it to separate her from the freaks. To make a distinction that she is above them. They also used the word ""freak"" in Asylum so I think the word just worked with the context of both seasons 2 and 3.  But again interesting theory! Since people are guessing operation top hat/mutants, adding other old-school horror monsters would make sense."
AmericanHorrorStory,2x0jpt,anandamidetrip,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"Monsters is one of my theories.   As I said here I think a monster season could work. If we never saw it, just the devastation it left in its track. How a small town deals with suddenly being preyed upon and terrorised, the power structures and raw fear of the unknown murderous beast. Could even throw in the surprise halfway through that it's a changeling, and someone in the town is responsible."

AmericanHorrorStory,2wwyr2,Canines_and_Cards,11,Mon Feb 23 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"Here is my opinion on the matter:  If Jessica Lange does indeed leave AHS I fully want Kathy Bates to take the leading role in S5. I have nothing against all the other actors, I just think that she is truly a phenomenal actress that was born to be the lead in AHS. You just need to see her performance in Misery to understand my point: she desperately needs to play some sort of similar disturbing horrific/evil character that will make your skin crawl like she did in Misery and in Coven.   Hell, call me an optimistic, but I think that the reason Kathy Bates never really had such a pivotal role in Freakshow could be because Ryan Murphy is saving her for S5 as the leading character.  As for newbies actors: I desperately want Michelle Pfeiffer to join the AHS cast. Ryan Murphy himself stated that she was in her top wish list for AHS, so here's hoping she comes, even for only a guest appearance. I know this is unlikely given her high demand, but it's worth considering.  Additionally I also agree with giving Francis Conroy a bigger part next season. I absolutely loved her in every season she's been in and think she deserves a bigger role."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wwyr2,IamLegba,3,Mon Feb 23 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Pfeiffer would be amazing. Similar to what you said about Bates, I think Pfeiffer would kill it in a really dark and evil role."

I'm hoping to see a well-balanced cast rather than someone in the lead. I think Murder House was extremely successful partially due to its small core group of characters (Vivien,  Ben, Violet,  Constance,  and Tate) and the balance the writers distributed between those characters. It would be a huge change to revert back to that format after 3 seasons with a fairly distinct lead. Having said that, I think Conroy is overdue for a bigger part. Her performances have been phenomenal but I'm ready to see her in something other than a supporting role."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wwyr2,taintlangdon,8,Mon Feb 23 22:13:11 2015 UTC,"I personally want to see AHS move towards an ensemble cast now that Lange is gone.

They served as a catalyst for Kit's storyline, of course. They fit the time period. There was also this ongoing conflict between science and religion, so the aliens represented a third dynamic. A higher ""truth"" than human understanding of science or religion. And then the Nazis had an interest in aliens, so it was appropriate that Arden was so fascinated by them.  I'd love for a future season to explore them in greater depth, and perhaps revisit Kit's superchildren. If there is a huge series finale, I sort of want THEM to lead the charge against Michael from Murder House."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wsmmu,starsurfer9,1 point,Sun Feb 22 22:23:23 2015 UTC,"I really liked the aliens too. I agree they fit in very well with the other themes. And I'm not very good at explaining myself but i was thinking my proposed story would show religion and science as the tools we use to understand our world (and thus our ability to stay sane), but the real truth behind understanding our would (the alien experiments) is so unfathomable that the tools we have could never lead us to that conclusion. Although I do feel like this story is borderline Matrix contrived."

AmericanHorrorStory,2wo97p,NocturnalSignal,52,Sun Feb 22 00:06:35 2015 UTC,"I would love an Orphanage done as a gothic period piece sometime in the 1800's - creepy young girls singing nursery rhymes, dark hall ways at night, a strange gardener and his shack of secrets, girls disappearing, cliquey cruel games, authoritative vicious matron but seems to be protecting the girls from something with her strict rules, kindly but slightly off cook, outside woods at night with ghostly visions luring the girls, basement/attic that is off limits but strange voices, creepy old portraits, wise old but slightly sinister benefactor of the orphanage visits, an old diary found telling of strange rituals.      As much as I have enjoyed the American Southern Gothic vibe from all 4 seasons, I think a 1800's gothic piece would mix it up a bit."

Hide things away from me and hint at dark things so I'm chewing the t.v to see what is in the basement, why they are told never to speak of that girl who disappeared ever again, why at 3.00 am there is a strange, slightly demonic shaped shadow that passes over the girls while they are sleeping, who is that little boy a girl sees late at night in the library but runs away when approached and disappears etc."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wo97p,OtakuLover7100,3,Sun Feb 22 01:34:11 2015 UTC,slightly demonic shaped shadow that passes over the girls while they are sleeping*   It is a demon who has repented and wants to return to Heaven so is acting as their guardian?

AmericanHorrorStory,2wo97p,Chelchan,20,Sun Feb 22 04:49:54 2015 UTC,A Cult; Manson themes and Jonestown themes. Although I would want Jessica Lange to be the leader
AmericanHorrorStory,2wo97p,matheusSerp,10,Sat Feb 21 20:05:50 2015 UTC,"Setting: Late 1880s/1890s New York City, Late 1820s upstate New York, 1830s Washington DC  Themes: Demons, Freemasonry, Illuminati, Occult, Science, Industry, Spiritualism  Characters: Nicola Tesla, Thomas Edison, William Morgan, John Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, JP Morgan, Jay Gould, Jack the Ripper  Groups: Freemasons, Anti-Masonic Party, Illuminati, Tycoons, Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing, General Electric  Events: Death of William Morgan, Erie Canal, emancipation, subway opening, Sing Sing Prison  Just spitballing. The main story would focus on the rivalry between Tesla and Edison, Tesla's struggle with JP Morgan and the rest of the Illuminati. Backstory would be the Freemasons summon a demon to kill William Morgan because he was going to expose them as a secret society. The Freemasons go into hiding as the Anti-Masonic Party forms. It's legacy passed down to JP Morgan.  Jack the Ripper would be a side character and an obvious play at the theory he traveled to America after the events in London. Yes, it made me think of Sanctuary, but given the setting and tone it could easily differentiate itself, and it's been awhile since the series. Maybe he is a demon and the Illuminati summons him to force Tesla to do as they command or kill him."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wo97p,jangobotito,3,Sun Feb 22 06:37:32 2015 UTC,"That's really cool.  I'm wondering how emancipation plays into this plot.  The only issue with this one is it's so heavily male-centered whereas Seasons 2,3, and 4 the focus was mostly on the female characters.  That's something I've really liked about this show is the strong emphasis on the female protagonist/antiheroes."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wo97p,irishwoody89,2,Sun Feb 22 18:40:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Admittedly this is very white male heavy and strong female characters are something I love about the show as well. IDK where female characters fit in but I am sure a little more research would turn up some notable female figures. Off the top of my head, maybe a freed slave girl (Angela Bassett?) grows up and becomes a madam and starts a high-end brothel which serves the rich and elite, including the Illuminati. And Emancipation could of impacted the Freemasons economically, leading to their decline and unpopularity during the 1820s/1830s.   I should mention that I don't know much about the Freemasons or these figures. I just had the idea of 1800s New York and started googling. I do know a bit about Tesla and Edison, mostly from a PBS show (NOVA? Probably.) Ignoring my other ideas, I think Tesla vs Edison and 1890s NYC would be a great foundation to build a season on."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wo97p,sgntpepper03,12,Sun Feb 22 19:21:47 2015 UTC,I think I heard something about possibly next season being centered around Area 51? Aliens / nuclear testing / mutants? Just a rumor though. Not confirmed.

Asylum/Freakshow are actual parts of American history. Not saying that haunted elements and witchcraft weren't but it's easier to exaggerate them. Adding a horror element to present time things in the United States is a little more difficult.

AmericanHorrorStory,2wfvhm,luxlisbon_,8,Thu Feb 19 17:03:23 2015 UTC,"Murder House Freak Show Coven Asylum   Murder House seemed to have the most consistent story. Everything felt like it fit together and was all related to the house. I also really like a good ghost story, and Murder House was the only season that focused on ghosts.  I know that there's a lot of love for Asylum, and while I did think it was a great season, I just didn't enjoy it as much as the others. There were too many horror elements that felt unrelated to one another: aliens, serial killers, cannibalistic zombie creatures, demonic possession, and so on. Any one of these things could have made for a good horror topic, and trying to squeeze all of them into one season with little to connect them other than that they just happened to take place around the same asylum seemed too contrived. To be fair, the writers did as good of a job putting them together as they could, but I didn't get into it as much."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wfvhm,crono09,2,Fri Feb 20 23:14:52 2015 UTC,"ugh. every single season pays homage to horror film and tropes that have existed for the last 80 years! asylum was just as guilty (less than others...) of having a mix-mash of those tropes stuffed together. if anything i think asylum contained it all much cleaner than, say, coven or murder house (basically a rosemary's baby tribute piece). this show has never proven itself to be truly original in terms of ideas.  also keep in mind the asylum was basically the only setting we got in season 2. it feels like the characterizations and tropes come out of nowhere but it's because we are introduced to them in the asylum, or the characters actually enter the asylum and share their story. many times they were in and out in a few episodes because the characters died or left the asylum."

AmericanHorrorStory,2wfvhm,blaqkaudioxd,4,Sun Feb 22 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"Coven, Asylum, Freak Show, and Murder House. For some reason, I just didn't care for Murder House, it was still good, but if they hadn't announced asylum I probably would have just stopped watching."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wfvhm,ladyhobbitlady,13,Thu Feb 19 23:43:20 2015 UTC,"1) Asylum  2) Murder House  3) Freak Show  4) Coven  This is the clear order IMO. I enjoyed all of them though.  Just curious, what makes Coven your favorite season?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2wfvhm,ik1020,4,Thu Feb 19 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"I think that Coven is my favorite season because of the characters. I didn't like the story line all that much.There were holes, and I felt like the whole dilemma with the witch hunters was half assed. The rivalry between witches and voodoos magically ended. I felt like there should have been more tension between Fiona and Laveau when she moved went to the witches. Basically after episode 9, it was half assed.   The characters in season 3 were what really got me. Fiona, Marie Laveau, Delphine, Madison, and Myrtle were all characters with huge personalities. I think Myrtle Snow will always be my favorite character. She is larger than life, so dramatic, and such a bitch to Fiona."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wfvhm,ik1020,2,Thu Feb 19 16:58:43 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree I really enjoyed the first couple episodes of Coven as they introduced the setting/characters. But it really piddled out towards the end, I kept waiting for everything to tie together but it never really did. Freak Show was similar in that regard.   Also, in Coven, it was annoying that many dead characters kept coming back alive. It really took a lot away from the character development in my opinion."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wfvhm,lurkingphoenix,2,Thu Feb 19 18:54:46 2015 UTC,I think Freakshow was the opposite. Almost every character got some form of closure. Instead Freakshow had the weakest characters. I cared more fore the villains and extras then Jessie Lange for once.
AmericanHorrorStory,2wfvhm,ik1020,2,Thu Feb 19 20:29:39 2015 UTC,"I somewhat agree, though the character arcs were resolved I still did not like the ending. The first 4/5 episodes were much better than the rest of the season in my opinion. The ending especially felt like a cop out, they added a pointless character (Neal Patrick Harris) who took up too much screen time. Don't get me wrong I loved the Chester character but it felt like they added him only for the star power. The finale episode was decent at best, I did not like Elsa's ending at all I really felt like she didn't deserve happiness. Dandy's was the only storyline that truly gripped me."

That may not be fair, because I just couldn't make it past episode 5 of Coven (I never got into it enough and lost interest in keeping up with it halfway through), but the first two were, to me, game changers in the ""horror story"" genre."
AmericanHorrorStory,2wfvhm,malestraum,3,Thu Feb 19 16:32:38 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, because I think the biggest reason Coven sucked was the last few episodes.

Coven was, alright. I enjoy camp but Coven just seemed like it didn't have enough focus to pull it off the same way something like Bayonetta could. Asylum was fantastic, I think the aliens actually made it better. But there were a few episodes here and there that were a bit dull or didn't seem like they developed the plot or characters. Murder House was my favorite all the way through. Every episode had me tense and excited. As someone who usually hates horror it was a surprise and I guess I might like it best simply because I saw it first, but it's still fantastic."

A little more horror-y than I like, in a creepy-things-in-the-basement sort of way, but full of interesting characters and a few twists. Freak Show.  Almost too predictable.  I would have liked to have been shocked and surprised more.  Also, not enough Twisty.   I'm anticipating that Asylum will come in as one of the top two.

AmericanHorrorStory,2w7oeq,SharkBites90,2,Wed Feb 18 00:36:11 2015 UTC,"Me too! She's the Supreme's only child and a more than capable enough good teacher and mentor to be head mistress of the most renowned witch school in that worlds history! They wrote her too naive, she should have been a bit more fierce."
AmericanHorrorStory,2w7oeq,tropic0,7,Wed Feb 18 00:45:05 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem like being Supreme is hereditary - it doesn't seem a common enough occurrence for Fiona to suspect her. And while Cordelia was the best leader, she was considered a weak witch and the power of the Supreme doesn't always go to the best leader. (Case in point, Fiona.)  It makes total sense why Cordelia never thought herself to be the Surpeme: her powers were suppressed to the point where it hurt her health (I'm guessing that's the reason why she couldn't have kids), and was seemingly emotionally abused by Fiona all her life to the point where she had little self-esteem.   and what would the perform vital vitalis on   Presumably on a housefly; it's an easy life that would be less problematic than a more sentient being, and Madison was able to prove her skills by bringing one back."

AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,ShaftGlutton,12,Sun Feb 15 19:32:28 2015 UTC,"They didn't do anything with it? I stopped watching when there were about 4 or 5 episodes left, but I was positive that the last shot of the show was going to be his freakish penis in a display jar in the mesuem."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,thethreadkiller,3,Sun Feb 15 23:54:01 2015 UTC,Why would you stop watching...?
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,miles197,6,Mon Feb 16 07:55:55 2015 UTC,"I stopped watching too at around episode 10, and this is something i've never done with a TV series before, not even LOST.  I just found myself incredibly uninterested in the characters arcs and the story line, to the point where i couldn't even justify giving the show 3 or 4 more hours of my time (yet i take the time to come here and comment haha). I just really couldn't give two shits what became of any of the characters, even Dandy who I initially found quite interesting (before he devolved into cheesy monologues, weekly tantrums and underwhelming violent scenes).  Here's to the next season recapturing the magic from Season 1 and 2 again"
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,Ruination94,7,Mon Feb 16 11:51:26 2015 UTC,"I just was never into the show. I honestly have not liked the show since season one. Season 2 was OK, but I still didn't love it. Why would I keep watching a show that I didn't like? It was a tradition that me and my girlfriend had. We are both huge fans of the horror genre and it was always something to look forward to. She was always more into the show than I. But when we missed two weeks in a row due to random reasons, we both realized we didn't even care what happens so we didn't waste our time.   Have you noticed how many people hate this show yet still subscribe to this subreddit, and still watch the show? I think it's because we are all in love with horror. Horror is a really hard genre to do well. How many terrible horror movies have you sat through? So so many. But we refuse to give up on horror. I will continue to watch all horror movies and shows with the hope that maybe I'll enjoy one every now and again."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,thethreadkiller,2,Mon Feb 16 13:27:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, season one is the best one. It is so much more focused and I feel like Ryan Murphy spent more time developing that one (obviously since it was before the show was popular and he started throwing everything but the kitchen sink into the new seasons).   I was holding onto some hope for this season. I loved Twisty and he was definitely as scary as I wanted the show to be. But the big mistake was getting rid of him. The show did become more of a ""waah we're freaks"" drama that really was like beating a dead horse. I didn't care about Jimmy, I didn't care about Esmeralda, I started to not care about Elsa. I just kept watching because I HOPED the show would change. And also because Finn Wittrock was incredible.   I have the feeling that if season five has the same problems, I'll lose interest officially and stop watching. Season five needs to be drastically different.   Does Ryan Murphy even look at this subreddit and these posts? He totally should. It's a good idea to listen to the fans."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,wexiidexii,-1,Mon Feb 16 14:13:17 2015 UTC,"Uh, season one had everything but the kitchen sink as well. Although it was the most focused of the 4 (but that isn't saying much). And Murphy is definitely to some degree influenced by fans but I'm pretty sure it's mostly the twitter followers."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,anandamidetrip,2,Tue Feb 17 18:02:19 2015 UTC,I don't think it had as much as say season two.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,wexiidexii,3,Tue Feb 17 18:12:59 2015 UTC,I cannot believe they left that story out. I have never been that hyped to see a penis.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,BocoCHutternut,22,Tue Feb 17 12:56:54 2015 UTC,"Wow! I think you hit a lot of really good points, especially the ones about Maggie (so very, very underdeveloped), and Stanley's penis. I mean, come on! I waited all the way to the finale to see the big reveal on his monster dick.   Your suggestion about Jimmy's development is a splendid idea. I didn't really think about it until you mentioned it, but it does seem like his turn from hot guy to hot mess was sudden and sort of unbelievable. It just happened way too fast, I guess. It seemed exaggerated at times, now that I think about it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,mamzellepeepee,6,Sun Feb 15 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"Jimmys story would pretty much be the same except he would go through very slight and discreet changes. Instead of suddenly becoming a drunk he'd isolate himself and be a negative Ned. Constantly talking about how the ones we love the most die. He reconciles with Maggie since he had a crush on her as kids (I'll get to that in a second) only for the attention to be shifted to the new fortune teller (Alexandra Breckenridge), who's working with Stanley.   Stanley's story: same as always except more explicit sex scenes. Murphy kept saying how much of a sleazy character Stanley was and how they'd push the envelope. I'm gay, but I'm not saying this for titillation. I'm saying this because we never really got a clear definition of what was up with his penis. Nothing explicit. Maybe show him choking Thor or a show silhouette. Or an sex scene with the male hooker crying as he's taking Stanley's cock. Only for Stanley to say something like ""haha no matter how big and strong they are...they always cry after the tenth inch"" or something pertaining to his sleazeball character.   Maggie: the most changes. I saw so many potential in her. Mostly as a way to show the goodness in people who are ""bad"". But....she started out in the freak show and grew up with Jimmy. Her grandmother raised her, who was a full fledged Russian fortune teller. Unfortunately she never developed any powers and felt like an outcast within outcasts. Not willing to give up she became the show's trapeze artist and assistant. She would've been a sympathetic character who left the circus to become a dancer. Until people found out she's a ""witch"" and ran her out of town. It wasn't until she came back her powers developed and she started having feelings for Jimmy. She would've died the same way. Except more tragic. The episode prior, she would've seen them all perform and would want to go back on stage. Seeing that as the perfect chance..."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,javiayer,20,Sun Feb 15 22:22:14 2015 UTC,I really wish Twisty remained the main villain and his storyline played out throughout the season with a vendetta against the freaks
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,krrt,15,Sun Feb 15 21:19:45 2015 UTC,These are good changes but they don't go deep enough. Freakshow just felt like it wasn't going anywhere. There were loads of subplots but no strong central plot. There were some shocking scenes and some interesting themes but nothing particularly clever plotwise. Episodes and characters felt disconnected from each other. Too many dead wood characters. Characters that seemed like they were going to be important but weren't.  It felt like an anthology series in an anthology show. Each episode was a different story...
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,pastacelli,3,Sun Feb 15 21:20:32 2015 UTC,The change would've made Twisty the main villain.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,jeffshaught,12,Sun Feb 15 22:04:48 2015 UTC,By and large the biggest problem with the show is that Ryan Murphy invites anyone who wants a role to stay and that's how we wind up with a million inconsequential characters. He did it on Glee too. The cast is way too bloated and we need some new blood.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,tinyshroom,1 point,Mon Feb 16 04:28:15 2015 UTC,True.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,dis0riented,9,Mon Feb 16 05:13:23 2015 UTC,"There were so many missed opportunities in this season, honestly. I feel like they started out with so many grand ideas that completely collapsed as they hastily wrapped up the season with ""everyone got shot."""
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,monkeysrule123,2,Mon Feb 16 04:50:33 2015 UTC,Originally it was supposed to be a carnival on its last legs. What happened to that?
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,mikem004,2,Mon Feb 16 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"i have read through the grapevine that jessica lange has no enthusiasm about the show anymore (hence her leaving) since she conceived the idea of a traveling circus and, i believe, the character of elsa mars. i can see how her expectations for quality in s4 have dissipated. she had such high praise for murder house and asylum, too."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,monkeysrule123,2,Wed Feb 18 07:12:27 2015 UTC,She wanted s4 to be when Freak shows were at their peak (late 1800's-40's)
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,monkeysrule123,8,Wed Feb 18 13:54:22 2015 UTC,im pretty much done with ahs after this season. They just make the plot and subplots a complete mess. If they dont get better writers im not watching next season.

AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,TerrorEyzs,12,Sun Feb 15 22:05:44 2015 UTC,"The simple answer is ""better writing"""
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,fajinalickn,8,Mon Feb 16 03:26:18 2015 UTC,"Also, have Chester be mentioned in early episodes. Like ""that Damn ventriloquist keeps leaving his doll everywhere"" and we'd see a shot of Margerie. And they'd make allusions to him being a bit off. So he's not so random coming to town."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,anandamidetrip,-4,Sun Feb 15 22:23:54 2015 UTC,So just have a damn doll lying around. Also the point of him coming to town was so he would buy the show. It would be stupid to have him there the whole timr
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,MatchEntry,5,Mon Feb 16 02:34:16 2015 UTC,Dandy ended up buying it anyway. His character made no impact whatsoever. They could've just had him appear later on yet introduce him early as just a passing comment. Leaving his top hat or Margerie lying around and people mentioning him.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vzrht,anandamidetrip,3,Mon Feb 16 05:02:21 2015 UTC,"Mentioning someone once or twice in a tv show doesn't make for a character introduction, it would be quickly forgotten."

AmericanHorrorStory,2w1pgg,miles197,12,Mon Feb 16 05:09:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah ""Freaks"" is an actual movie. The movie doesn't directly reference anyone specifically in the show, like there is no normal trapeze artist or a sideshow midget involved here, but the stories are somewhat similar, mainly in Stanley's demise. In the movie, Cleopatra takes advantage of one of the freaks to get his money, just as Stanley utilizes the freaks to make money of his own. The freaks in the movie turn on her with knives at a big feast, just as the freaks do to Stanley. Cleopatra's lover is chased under a caravan in the rain, and Cleopatra is eventually turned into a half-bird freak, and both of these things happen to Stanley. I think you're trying to read too far into the specifics of the plot, that's all that they were homaging."

AmericanHorrorStory,2w1pgg,MatchEntry,3,Thu Feb 19 14:42:42 2015 UTC,"Man the first and second episodes were so much better tributes to freaks, and didn't have to be explained. We even had a few posts here showing side by sides and comparisons of characters.  However! it was not until like 8 episodes in we realized Dell was not the one referencing Hercules.  Maggie was Cleo though, even in the first episodes. I'm not sure how to make a saw joke in reference to how maggie did actually get dealt with, but they definitely didn't save her?  Penny however, was never in their eyes a bad person. She got a little crazy with Pseal which ended up more than expected on film I guess. But they were definitely in love, and Penny did re-enact the tar and feathering like in freaks.  So yea, references were made. To everything."

AmericanHorrorStory,2vwc6k,derka_derka_dueces,21,Sat Feb 14 21:07:20 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that likes all the seasons despite each of their flaws?
AmericanHorrorStory,2vwc6k,Canines_and_Cards,42,Sun Feb 15 02:19:47 2015 UTC,"I may be the only one, but Coven was by far my favorite season. I couldn't really get into Murder House for some reason and while I liked Asylum, it drove me crazy with how all over the place it was. I liked Freak Show up until about the halfway point and then it all just went downhill for me.   Coven may not be scary and it may be laughably bad, but that's what I love about it. I'm a huge fan of horror-comedies and B-movies and Coven was like one long, beautiful, hilarious, god-awful B movie for me. It was pure entertainment and that's all I wanted from it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vwc6k,Chocolate_Sushi,29,Sat Feb 14 21:25:41 2015 UTC,"I'll second this, I am also in the minority group whose favorite season was Coven. I absolutely adored Coven's hilarious dark camp humor and thought it was a refreshing season that contrasted very well after Asylum, which was much scarier."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vwc6k,Quackimaduck1017,13,Sat Feb 14 23:22:26 2015 UTC,"The only thing I didn't like about coven was Misty being stuck in her own hell. That really killed it for me  I loved Murder House, very dark and very original.  Asylum...had an awesome main story line but I could have done without the 39748392 extra subplots (and as a mostly closeted lesbian with conservative/homophobic parents the thought of conversion therapy turns my stomach so I actually had a breakdown when they put Sarah Paulson through that)  Coven was awesome. Right amount of cheesy/poking fun at itself, solid plot, snarky comments, the works. Was less than stoked with the ending, except that Sarah Paulson came out on top  The best thing about Freakshow was that fact that everyone got their just ending IMO. I enjoyed it while it was on, but doubt I'd seek it out to watch over again  I also really liked that Freakshow featured real people, rather than having makeup artists transform people"
AmericanHorrorStory,2vwc6k,sgntpepper03,10,Sun Feb 15 00:46:30 2015 UTC,Her hell was terrible to watch :(

AmericanHorrorStory,2vwc6k,Quackimaduck1017,7,Sun Feb 15 06:56:29 2015 UTC,yeah that's true  I dunno for an undead guy he must have strong opinions about...the undead basically
AmericanHorrorStory,2vwc6k,ttll2012,7,Sun Feb 15 14:47:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call Murder House original since the idea of it resembles Shining a lot, which is dead people ""live"" on in a particular building. Still great in a lot of ways, especially how it touches a lot of the social issues, like infidelity, depression, mass shooting etc."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vwc6k,Quackimaduck1017,9,Sun Feb 15 03:35:52 2015 UTC,"I think it was original for a TV show and the way in which they presented it, not so much in concept  that concept ages back as far as myths can lol"

AmericanHorrorStory,2vwc6k,ElevenOwls,13,Sun Feb 15 00:54:01 2015 UTC,"Although I didn't like Coven nearly as much as the other seasons, it wasn't bad at all. It was just for a different demographic. People are so quick to turn up their noses at things aimed at young teenage girls, but that's a demographic, and it's OK. Jesus."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vwc6k,CaptnAwesomeGuy,5,Sat Feb 14 22:19:46 2015 UTC,I think there were different aspects of it that were aimed more at women in general.  I could relate to the Cordelia-Fiona storyline a lot.

AmericanHorrorStory,2w23t0,ratbastid,6,Mon Feb 16 15:10:04 2015 UTC,"They're all separate characters played by the same actors. The exceptions are Pepper and Hans Gruper (Dr. Arden). Think of Pepper and Gruper as walking, talking Easter Eggs. They were placed in Freak Show simply as a way to make reference and connect the Freak Show to Asylum.   Elsa is not Jude, Elsa died on camera in Hollywood while Jude was rotting away in a cell in Massachusetts. Bette & Dot were starting their lives with Jimmy while Lana was becoming famous from her exposé about Briarcliff and Bloody Face, and Kit was raising his kids with Alma and Grace."
AmericanHorrorStory,2w23t0,ace_VXIII,6,Mon Feb 16 20:58:22 2015 UTC,"No, the actors/actresses are not connected. It's an anthology, they won't get new people every year."

AmericanHorrorStory,2w23t0,JP_SHAKUR,1 point,Tue Feb 17 20:53:07 2015 UTC,"Aside from the already established connections, no other character connections exist between characters across the seasons. The way I look at it is that the different characters portrayed by the same actors are faceless. We just see them as looking similar because of the actor. I like to think that Sister Jude, Constance, Fiona and Elsa bear no resemblance, but we only see that they do because of the conscious, artistic choice in re-using familiar actors.   Hope this makes sense!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2w23t0,mikem004,-2,Fri Feb 20 04:33:36 2015 UTC,"I thought they were setting elsa up to be sister jude pretty hard, that she was going to get fired, become an alcoholic then the whole killing the girl becoming a nun thing would happen."

If its got a Rocky Horror vibe combined with slasher stuff and good songs (originals?) it could be cool. New shows seem to energise Murphy and Falchuk and bring out their fearless creative and ground breaking best. I like they way the trailer indicates - you think this is going to be just bubblegum tv. - think again - SLASH! BLOOD!      Someone should start a Scream Queens sub otherwise this sub will be inundated with all these.

While it'd be interesting to see how we can use science in a horrific way, I'd like to steer clear of that since I'm really interested in all of the good things the future of gene therapy can offer to society, and would not like it to be shown in a bad light. Plus, there are already a few good shows that have shown the horrors of genetic modification (Helix, Fringe, etc.)   A world full of Dandy's.   By far my favorite part of this post lol"

The next and bigger problem is originality; while the carnival scene has not been explored much, science and the abuse of it has been shown multiple times in different shows. I don't know about insane asylums, but haunted houses and witchcraft have been shown many times in shows.  What I would like more than any theme and concept is for the plot to become more solid even when laced with subplots."

U.S. Route 41 currently runs through the center of the community. The population was 14,234 at the 2010 census.   Gibsonton was famous as a sideshow wintering town, where various people in the carnival and circus businesses would spend the off season placing it near the winter home for Ringling Brothers Circus at Tampa, Sarasota and Venice in various times [(http://www.sarasotacircushistory.com/articles/circusinvenice.php). It was home to Percilla the Monkey girl, the Anatomical Wonder, and the Lobster Boy. Siamese twin sisters ran a fruit stand here. At one time, it was the only post office with a counter for dwarves. Aside from the agreeable winter climate, Gibsonton offered unique circus zoning laws that allowed residents to keep elephants and circus trailers on their front lawns.

Great job!  I would absolutely love a AHS season based around an isolated community like Nevada, and would love to see some Corn Fields as the main scenery, as I am a big horror fan and would enjoy AHS replicating Children of the Corn. However instead of freaky children they could use mutants that have perhaps escaped a government experimentation facility and proceed to terrorize the town.  PS: I completely forgot that Chloe Sevigny was in Boys don't cry, she was amazing and I just think it's a shame how little she has been used by Ryan Murphy in AHS. She is extremely talented and would add a nice edgy vibe to the cast as a regular."

There's a big-10 university and the Capitol.  It'd be unrealistic, is all.  Still, many Lincoln residents have ties to small towns - a character studying at UNL could definitely have a cult at home.

AmericanHorrorStory,2vouia,Supreme000,3,Thu Feb 12 22:21:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I just keep looking back to what Ryan Murphy said about the top hat clue, and I think maybe people are digging too deep. He said people are going to find it clever, but I feel like most people watching the show have probably never heard of things like Operation Top Hat, so unless it's mentioned directly in the show, it's not going to seem clever at all.  So I started thinking of the top hat as a symbol, and to me it suggests either wealth disparity or Abe Lincoln. It's all but confirmed that the next season will be in modern day, so I almost wrote off Abe, but then I thought ""Lincoln Nebraska"" and started piecing things together from there."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vouia,quarrystone,1 point,Thu Feb 12 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"I see exactly where you are coming from. I've been going back and forth with the op top hat and government theories. There's a ton of convincing connections but like you said,  not a lot that I think would be clever in the way Murphy implies. I think you're on the right track.  For the sake of discussion,  my only question is what are your ideas for what a title could be? All the seasons so far have had locations as the subtitle and I've seen a lot of great ideas but not too many have suggested a title that includes a location."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vouia,oath2order,2,Fri Feb 13 00:10:31 2015 UTC,The titles are something I've been keeping an out for too! I did see a cult theory on imdb where the poster used AHS: Commune as their guess.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vouia,fajitafridays,2,Fri Feb 13 00:14:24 2015 UTC,"Well, Asylum had a double meaning. It of course refers to Briarcliff, but I remember Ryan Murphy also talking about it meaning safety or solace. Coven also wasn't so much a place as an idea, and the same could be said for Freak Show in a looser sort of way. So I imagine it'll be something along those lines, maybe something like American Horror Story: Isolation or American Horror Story: Heartland. Depends on what the core theme of the season is."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vouia,chattypenguin,2,Fri Feb 13 00:15:30 2015 UTC,"When Murphy announced that the top hat was a hint for next season, he described it an an ""arcane"" clue.

AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,Kittygus1,38,Thu Feb 12 22:13:22 2015 UTC,I prefer Asylum.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,Zinthaniel,21,Thu Feb 12 22:49:02 2015 UTC,"I personally prefer Murder House out of pure nostalgia, as the Tate and Violet story-line was one of my favorites out of the entire show. I also really liked the cast, especially Dylan McDermott and thought that Evan's performance as Tate was sublime and criminally underrated, by far his best character performance in my opinion. He just showed so much emotion and passion in all his scenes. It's a shame that Ryan Murphy has given Evan Peters less challenging roles recently in S3-S4 that didn't live up to his true potential: here's hoping he's given a decent character next season.  However I also really enjoyed Asylum, and it is my second favorite season of AHS after Murder House. Zachary Quinto and Lily Rabe were amazing!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,israeldmo,3,Thu Feb 12 23:02:16 2015 UTC,I think Ryan gave him proper material to work with in Freak Show. Jimmy was just annoying as a character.

AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,MatchEntry,25,Mon Feb 16 01:26:42 2015 UTC,Asylum. Mary Eunice made my heart melt. Favorite interpretation of the devil.  Murder house is a VERY close third though.  Freakshow and coven were kind of tied for me until freakshow ended and I rewatched it in binge form. Haha freakshow is actually (don't hate me for this) my top favorite season. I know it has its faults.. Jimmy Cobain.. I really love twistys story and I love dandy's story and how it all branched off of twisty. Dandy's story was almost like a continuation of twistys story. I also really loved the freak cast. This season had so many new faces!

I stopped watching it halfway through and came back to it a few months later, but I binge-watched Asylum. It's hard to compare the two.  I think at this point the order for me is Asylum, Murder House, Freak Show, Coven.   Coven was cute and campy but ultimately a little too contrived for me. If AHS is the Fear Street saga, Coven was Goosebumps: fun, and I totally feel preemptive nostalgia for it, but it's a little young for me."

AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,MatchEntry,2,Sun Feb 15 15:39:08 2015 UTC,"I liked Murder House, because the alien plotline bugged me so much. It seemed like an easy cop-out. ""How will we kill these characters without killing them? Aliens, yes"" I've never really been a fan of aliens though."

AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,MatchEntry,2,Mon Feb 16 21:27:53 2015 UTC,"Asylum, definitely- Sister Jude is my favorite AHS character ever and I loved how she came full circle antagonist to protagonist.  The main players all got exactly what was coming to them as well.  I liked the exorcism and moderate supernatural abilities of possessed Mary Eunice. Bloody Face and Son of Bloody Face were very well played out  I actually liked the aliens and their ambiguity, but ONLY because they also had angels in the season.  That reminded me of some things I've seen where people theorize that some major religious stories regarding angels or divine contact might actually be contact with extraterrestrial intelligence or UFO sightings- Like Ezekiel's wheel, or some of the things in Genesis referencing ""giants,"" things in the Mahabharata, etc insert ancient aliens dude meme here  If the aliens in Asylum had been presented like star trek where you could see everything going on with them it would have been hokey ino.  Kit and Alma getting ""explored"" in a spaceship version of Dr Arden's lab would have maybe been ok to establish parallels (maybe).  The way it played out, if the same thing had happened to Kit in 450 BC he might have thought he had contacted God or some angels or something."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,OhItsPatrick,3,Thu Feb 19 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"Rewatching Asylum the aliens made a bit more sense. The horror of the season revolved around losing control of your body and being subjected to the will of others, whether through punishment and regulation (Sister Jude, Briarcliff), invasive surgery and mutation (Arden), rape and mutilation (Bloodyface and killer Santa) or possession (Mary Eunice). The aliens, who swoop down at seemingly arbitrary times and subject people to tests and experiments they can't begin to understand, fit well thematically. It's ironic that in the Asylum universe the only person who allows you free will is Death."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,inphinitfx,2,Fri Feb 20 16:47:51 2015 UTC,"thank you!  lots of people say aliens ""don't fit the theme"" but I think you've brought in a great point up in your post.

AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,Enkiae,4,Fri Feb 13 21:18:16 2015 UTC,"Murder House was far more watchable for me. Asylum felt like it dragged at times, and I found it more frustrating with the way parts of the plot were handled. Perhaps it's partly that MH was the first season, and got me into the show well, but I actually gave up part way through Asylum and ended up revisiting it just before Coven started, so I didn't feel like I was 'missing out'. It ended fairly strongly, but yeah, just felt like it got itself lost midway to me."

AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,baileath,1 point,Mon Feb 16 19:57:18 2015 UTC,The reason Murder House is the best is because everything revolves around these two questions: is this family going to stay together? (And) will they survive? all against the backdrop of the fact that they live in a haunted house that is haunted by -every one- who has ever died there. Everything that happens is connected to these unifying themes.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vp5rc,maxabat,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:03:52 2015 UTC,"Murder House. It was more fast paced, it felt like something really important happened every episode. More focused, tighter plot. I really liked the love story between Tate and Violet though I understand that's not everyone's cup of tea. I loved the dramatic irony throughout the season. The Harmons didn't know what was going on but the audience did, at least to some extent. The Harmons + Tate also seemed like such real people. Yes most of the people outside the Harmons felt far-fetched and ridiculous at times, but having the central characters be very real and relatable made the show great. I developed more of a connection to the characters in Murder House than I did in other seasons."

AmericanHorrorStory,2vmj8c,tinyshroom,28,Thu Feb 12 05:54:05 2015 UTC,Interesting theory. But I kind of like the idea of him just being corrupted by the church and hunger for power as a regular human being better.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vmj8c,Snork_Nork,4,Thu Feb 12 14:40:43 2015 UTC,I posted a similar theory on /r/fantheories here: http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/2v3yhp/american_horror_story_asylum_was_the_monsignor/  But I think the Angel of Death saying she's taking the demon (which I had forgotten about at the time) kind of sinks this theory.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vmj8c,DavidLovato,2,Thu Feb 12 20:49:42 2015 UTC,"I was watching episode 10 yesterday and googled ""Monsignor Timothy possessed"" because it dawned on me like wow okay he's beig super sadistic, and your post showed up from 5 days ago. I left this post as a comment on your post! But yeah, if that's really what she meant, then our theories are null and void. All of the evidence suggests he's possessed, in my opinion; his character totally does a complete 180 after Mary Eunice dies. Maybe he was corrupted by ""power"" but he doesn't get the cardinal job offer until episode 11. Like you said, his lie to Jude and her reaction (""nothing more cruel than false hope"") seems sadistic. Jude knows he is possessed when she tells him she finally has the gift of total clarity and sees him as he is."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vmj8c,DavidLovato,4,Thu Feb 12 21:07:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's a fun theory, but it's more likely he was just corrupted. I think it's also a more powerful story arc that way: here's a guy chosen directly by God to do a task, and even he can be corrupted by power, to the point of being as cruel as the devil. Says a lot about society/power/organized religion, whereas if he's actually possessed it's still a great character story, but one that's not quite as clear or strong."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vmj8c,davis98,5,Thu Feb 12 21:11:12 2015 UTC,What about when Eunice raped Timothy?
AmericanHorrorStory,2vmj8c,leahhhhh,9,Thu Feb 12 15:51:03 2015 UTC,"I think that showed a clear corruption of the Monsignor's purity, having effectively given himself to whatever evil she had inside of her. Before her death he is kind to Jude and they share a moment; after Mary Eunice dies he becomes cruel towards Jude in a way we hadn't seen before."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vmj8c,suppositoryofwisdom,2,Thu Feb 12 18:20:01 2015 UTC,"I think he was possessed by the devil - figuratively. In Catholicism, choosing to sin is choosing to let the devil into your heart. This concept is especially powerful when juxtaposed with the beautiful, kind, and pure Sister being literally possessed by the devil against her will. So here we have an innocent woman of God who has involuntarily become evil; meanwhile we have the Monseigneur, who was a holy man but slowly descends into evil completely by choice."

AmericanHorrorStory,2vloio,mpenturff,15,Thu Feb 12 03:10:53 2015 UTC,Psssst.... it's actually someone's job on set to focus on outfits and what pair of heels a character would wear.  That's the costume designer's job and this video was likely documenting that person's creative process/job.  I didn't watch it but they do this a lot for DVD extras.  Don't fault the costume designer (who has always done a stellar job) for subpar writing.  That's like blaming the waiter when your meal tastes bad.
AmericanHorrorStory,2vlr76,b1tchcraft,6,Thu Feb 12 01:39:01 2015 UTC,"Top Hats and Tales  This is the entire history of top hats. I found this part quite interesting:  ""The top hat may symbolize elegance, but it is also a symbolic locus of class warfare and, more generally, of social conflict between the powerful and the powerless. Track the life of the top hat and you'll find yourself in the middle of the most dramatic tensions in the history of the United States: British versus Americans, colonists versus Indians, whites versus blacks, men versus women, Wall Street versus Main Street. The top hat is like a shuttlecock batted between the sides. As a symbol, the top hat forces you to consider contradictions: respect/disrespect, ambition/humility, art/business, capitalism/labor, highbrow/lowbrow, superior/inferior."""
AmericanHorrorStory,2vlr76,thecuntmagician,3,Thu Feb 12 06:41:47 2015 UTC,"This is very interesting. We observed the very literal battles between men-vs.-women and blacks-vs.-whites in Coven, but after reading this, I think there are a lot more plotlines that can arise from this concept of picking sides. I would accept a season with this kind of theme if it used those not seen in Coven."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vlr76,Canines_and_Cards,2,Thu Feb 12 14:37:52 2015 UTC,"We definitely saw social conflict between the freaks and non-freaks in season four. There was also a lot of tension between the freaks and authorities, including police brutality and corruption.  Dandy was shown to have a lot of privilege and sway over those who are in power (authorities) and the freaks were powerless against both.  I think a class warfare/police state season would be fitting. It would definitely be a commentary on the times."
AmericanHorrorStory,2vlr76,thecuntmagician,5,Thu Feb 12 17:06:19 2015 UTC,"The problem is its hard to know exactly what Murphy means by arcane when he's shooting his mouth off in an interview. And we are so spoilt now with the internet that you can find nearly every known link to top hats in just a couple of hours of googling so nothing really seems ""hidden"".      I think ""Operation Top Hat"" is hidden away enough to fit into an ""arcane"" definition. I did some googling but didn't come across it. A mutant/area 51/chemical/atomic testing/aliens grouping I think would work well. I've found it hard to think of where else top hats could be a clue to a horror setting. If the clue is the coffee linking to the campfire coffee bit rather than the top hat then Summer Camp is a possibility. Formal hotel doormen wear top hats and a hotel is an archetypal horror setting from the Shining to Psycho to 1408.      Its easy to get carried away with top hat references throughout history (Abe Lincoln - civil war, stockmarket, Freemasons, stage-magic, Jack the ripper etc). But the vast majority don't lead to the strong, classic base for horror that AHS has always used."

I have a feeling next season will be set in modern day. Wish I could find the interview; the guy didn't give an absolute 100% but he said something like ""That's the plan.""  Edit: Found it! It's FX president John Landgraf, and he says ""that's my hope, yeah."" What's interesting is he says this after he says he already knows for sure, lol.

I suppose if one's religion is voodoo (vodou) and they see it as true across the board, then Papa Legba would technically oversee Mordrake and the gang."

He stands at a spiritual crossroads and gives (or denies) permission to speak with the spirits of Guinee, and is believed to speak all human languages. In Haiti, he is the great elocutioner.

AmericanHorrorStory,2vbxz1,ZomNoms,3,Mon Feb 9 20:54:04 2015 UTC,There was an interview with Ryan Murphy where he stated that Coven was his second choice of setting for season three. He originally wanted to do an entire season based on the Manson family but went with Coven instead due to the amount of work it would take to do it right and out of respect for the real life victims or something.  I don't have the source handy but you should be able to google it.   I think it's something they may tackle in American Crime Story later on.

AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,ness1215,44,Mon Feb 9 07:14:01 2015 UTC,A season loosely based on 'The Lottery' would be INCREDIBLE.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,AuroraMFCharming,23,Mon Feb 9 08:18:49 2015 UTC,"It would go something like it starts with the main character (Rabe) living normally until she meets ""outsiders"" and when telling her friends (Roberts, Peters, etc) she's chastised by the town and her husband (Wittrock). We slowly learn the disturbing ways of her society. It isn't until the very end that we learn the town is the one 'The Lottery' is based on. :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,AuroraMFCharming,4,Mon Feb 9 09:16:42 2015 UTC,Yessssss!
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,Canines_and_Cards,6,Mon Feb 9 10:34:24 2015 UTC,"The concept of 'The Lottery' is one I hope AHS does in the future. I think some of the season should focus on the officials of those communities, and the guilt and trauma they go through when they have to put loved ones in the horrifying consquences of the lottery. A lot of survivors' guilt themes would bore me, but using it once, and adding more themes (rebelling against the community, higher authority/government intervention, etc.) and mixing them up would make a solid, dark, and thrilling season."

AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,GamingTatertot,3,Mon Feb 9 09:48:30 2015 UTC,"My God, yes! That would be fantastic! Someone make this happen!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,3meraldArcher,25,Wed Feb 11 23:00:09 2015 UTC,"I feel like penitentiary would be to similar to asylum to keep viewers entertained. Abandoned would be to much to comprehend with stories spanning over 70 years, unless maybe each episode follows different character with a new story each week. I'm kind of over cults after watching coven. What I think would be best is a mix of fallout and in the deep. Not only could you have cannibalism and a hidden society of freaks but perhaps a sea monster that was created from the nuclear testing. I think an actual ""monster"" would bring a fresh aspect to the show. All your ideas are great tho."
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,3meraldArcher,4,Mon Feb 9 08:01:27 2015 UTC,Abandoned would take place in the 90's but would have flashbacks showing the decline and fall from grace of the hotel.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,3meraldArcher,2,Mon Feb 9 09:02:42 2015 UTC,Yeah. Idk still not feeling it. Just my opinion tho. I would be more excited about the monster thing. I would want it to have an old school monster movie vibe and show it in black and white. If you combine that with a great story I think it could be a good season.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,neutronstarneko,3,Mon Feb 9 09:42:13 2015 UTC,"Interesting. The monster from the black lagoon meets the hills have eyes, Pretty much?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,JackofDaniels,3,Mon Feb 9 09:44:00 2015 UTC,Maybe not full on the hills have eyes but some psycho hillbilly cannibal would be pretty cool since there apparently has to be at least one serial killer per season.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,schmassani,2,Mon Feb 9 09:51:10 2015 UTC,I thought you were talking about In the Deep. Lol  But yeah. The whole hotel thing is supposed to be realistic. More into how human greed and depravity can destroy the human psyche.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,JackofDaniels,17,Mon Feb 9 18:20:56 2015 UTC,"Cool ideas, am interested in In The Deep, especially if the community is sacrificing people to deep sea monsters and trying to raise it, very Cthulhu."
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,mountainmanballs,4,Mon Feb 9 16:45:05 2015 UTC,Yuup. People disappear because of sacrifices. maybe Hive and In the Deep could be blended. a cult town that worships an ancient deity revered by the natives the settlers met. Something like that.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,wallybinbaz,17,Mon Feb 9 18:23:21 2015 UTC,"I would like to see the next season along the colonial/settler times. It could be something like 'AHS: Colony' specifically referring to the Roanoke colony which is also known as 'The Lost Colony'.   As one of the first colonies in US, its residents disappeared when more colonists came to check up on them three years later. They could have so many ways to make them all go missing. Shaman magic, native wars, unknown creatures, religious fanatics hellbent on controlling others etc.   Edit: Grammar"
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,Canines_and_Cards,6,Mon Feb 9 17:33:38 2015 UTC,"My neighborhood bordered an area called the Great Dismal Swamp, which was the backdrop for a lot of colonial and Civil War-era spookiness, so we had a lot of actual history mixed in with our ghost stories. the Lost Colony was one of my favorite stories growing up, and it would make for a really great season (along with a few other tales thrown in)."

AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,kenstern2,13,Mon Feb 9 18:15:25 2015 UTC,Really good ideas - Abandoned sounds too similar to Murder House to me though.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,signu1230,12,Mon Feb 9 15:58:12 2015 UTC,I dig Noire.  Shoot the whole thing in black and white.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,circlemirror9293,4,Mon Feb 9 14:15:33 2015 UTC,"The concept of shooting the whole season in black and white sounds quite artistic, but I doubt Murphy would want to do the whole thing as such. We've seen B&W in Coven and Freak Show, and we'll likely see it again. I'm still waiting for a good show that does complete monochrome, and AHS would be the perfect candidate for this hope. Oh well."
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,Canines_and_Cards,5,Mon Feb 9 18:21:41 2015 UTC,"it would be perfect to have full monochrome.   Just an idea:  set in a big city (Chicago, New York, Philly, etc.) during the mid-40's and a class of college students set to go on their seperate ways (Rabe, Wittrock, Peters, Roberts, Breckenridge, and Graziadei) only to be brought back to the city and experience terrifying events. Someone dies in a horrifying fashion (their professor or a student) and they're all suspects. Wittrock as the protagonist. Peters ends up being the antagonist. Monsters (spring-heeled Jack, Mothman) and killers (Dennis O'Haire as the Bunnyman murderer) are the real culprits."
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,MissKatieMae,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:24:27 2015 UTC,I think that storyline is great :D but personally I'd like a season in the 1980s
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,CPTNBob46,7,Tue Feb 10 04:40:52 2015 UTC,AHS: In The Deep sounds awesome! I've always loved those kinds of settings.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,badwolfx,4,Mon Feb 9 11:05:30 2015 UTC,I like this one too. AHS with a little H.P. Lovcraft  would be awesome
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,Lecter07,1 point,Mon Feb 9 19:36:55 2015 UTC,Let's hope they do some of these at least. Haha
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,C_y_anide,6,Mon Feb 9 18:21:17 2015 UTC,"As cool as some of these ideas are, I think we can eliminate the ones that take place in the past for the time being.  Since its inception, AHS has followed a pretty consistent pattern for its settings.  It's been present, past, present, past.  Both Murder House and Coven took place in the ""present,"" a.k.a. the years they came out.  Asylum and Freak Show took place in bygone eras.  Every season has done a little time traveling, either into the past to explain some history or into the future to show how a character's story ends, but they stay in their own respective time for the most part.  Considering that Freak Show was set mostly in the 50's, I think we're due for a present-day season this time around.  Now, obviously, there's no hard and fast rule saying that Ryan Murphy absolutely HAS to set the latest season of AHS in the present.  It's his show, he can do whatever he wants.  I'm just going by the patterns he himself has set so far."
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,eiddieeid,2,Mon Feb 9 15:57:20 2015 UTC,So essentially....something like   In the Deep would be the only contender.   Someone mentioned Colony. That sounds Badass.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,miked00d,2,Mon Feb 9 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"Although even though Murder House was set in the present day, they had a lot of flashbacks to older times when previous residents lived there, so a lot of your ideas could still definitely be incorporated. Same thing happened with Coven and Madame Lalaurie."
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,GogNMagog,1 point,Mon Feb 9 23:57:01 2015 UTC,"Good thing the thread is about season ideas the OP would like to see happen in the future, and not about S5 speculation."
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,mrglow,6,Wed Feb 11 19:55:47 2015 UTC,Area 51 would be a wicked ass idea. Not sure what he could do for a present theme.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,mrglow,1 point,Mon Feb 9 18:46:11 2015 UTC,Area 51 would 99.99999% tie in with Asylum.   The problem with that theme is how would it be implemented. Maybe have the event unfold throughout episode 2 or 3. Then everything else is the army seeing and communicating with the aliens? Idk.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,CesarDaPig,4,Mon Feb 9 19:14:56 2015 UTC,A Charles Manson-esque cult from that time period could work really well written right.

AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,aa4ve_eve,3,Mon Feb 9 18:15:01 2015 UTC,It would be awesome if they did a season based off of the shadow over innsmouth.
AmericanHorrorStory,2va1xi,Canines_and_Cards,3,Mon Feb 9 16:12:44 2015 UTC,"Hmmm. How about American Horror Story: Legends.   Taking place in Modern Times. A paranormal investigator goes on a hunt for people who have been affected by Urban Legends. As he meets them, he realizes they all have something in common: A single nightmare about Alien's that abducted them and performed strange experiments on them.   So, it's up to our paranormal investigator to get to the bottom of the Urban Legends and unravel the truth about the victims nightmares. The truth will shake you to your very core!  American Horror Story: Legends  It makes a lot of sense for Ryan to bring even more connections into the small universe he's building. So, the return of Alien's as a very minuscule character with influence wouldn't surprise me. I also had the idea of the Alien's being a brainwashing tool used by the Government to cover up their own horrifying experiments. It could even lead to the mountains at one point and there can be where the whole story is uncovered when they meet the monstrosities that live out there.   They could even link it back to some nuclear weapons testing. And of course, the Cameo of the season can be the ever so lovely Jessica Lange as the head of command overseeing the experiments."

AmericanHorrorStory,2v2kp5,mommy2libras,2,Sat Feb 7 15:51:41 2015 UTC,I agree. I know people think it would be a lot like Asylum but there are definitely plenty of differences between a prison and an adylum. The entire psychology of each place is completely different. It could be a very interesting season.
AmericanHorrorStory,2v2kp5,TwistedLuck,9,Sun Feb 8 00:27:27 2015 UTC,"Just to name a few things:  1) Inmates are fucking engineers.  You see stuff in tv shows and movies about them making shanks out of spoons and sticks and stuff.  That's easy.  One of the shanks we took at the prison I work at was toothpaste and soap.  The basically mixed the two in the creases between the bricks in the wall (which are painted white).  He'd add a coat, let it dry and repeat.  When the whole thing was said and done he essentially had bar that was a little less dense than PVC.  But sure enough he filed it down to an ice pick.  Tattoo guns made from CD players, guns made from scrap metal they somehow always manage to find (if someone leave a bullet for them by the fence), brass knuckles with nails in them, stun guns made from disposable cameras (which they're allowed to have), whips with razor blades on the ends, pipes (for smoking whatever), radios (communication radios, not music radios), hell...I've even seen a grappling hook and a ghillie suit. These guys have nothing but time, imagination, coordination and communication skills that rival Spec Ops (and that's not an exaggeration by any means).  2) The numbers are always in their favor.  Take the prison I work at.  Its a minimum security prison.  That being said, the bays are open, much like boot camp barracks.  The higher the level the more isolated they are, but where I work.  You have a desk dead center in the middle (not a walled off bubble with shatter resistant glass or anything, just a desk thats elevated about 8 inches off the ground with a wall that comes about chest high that covers 3 sides of it.  The other side is completely open) of the housing unit.  The inmates are locked in said housing unit except for time in the yard, med appointments, chapel, meals, etc.  But the average is about 95 inmates in each housing unit with one officer (male, female, old, young, doesn't matter).  The odds are heavily stacked, and they can pretty much roam freely through the building until lights out.  Then its just to the bathroom (one bathroom that right by the officers desk, so they're always around us).  3) What they did to get into prison doesn't mean shit.  Sure the higher security levels exist for a reason but thats circumstantial.  There are plenty of guys who stay off the radar, stay out of trouble and work their risk level down to get to the easier prisons.  We have inmates ranging from child molesters, rapists, assault with a deadly weapon, arson, not paying child support, DUIs, Multiple homicide and everything in between.  And unless you go out of your way to look up what they're in for, you'd never know.  4) The system isn't like media depiction.  The Correctional Officers are ""in charge"" but the fact of the matter is, especially in a minimum security prison.  There is little to nothing we could do to stop them from flat out taking over.  The only thing that really stops them from doing that is knowing that they'd get a longer sentence if/when it didn't lead to their immediate escape.  5) as u/mommy2libras said ""the entire psychology of each place is completely different"".  Which is true, but the entire psychology of how you interact with each offender is different.  Some want to be your friend to get special treatment to just wanting to be your friend for the feeling of humanity. Others want absolutely nothing to do with us and don't even acknowledge our existence unless its something that could potentially lead to some level of punishment.  But there are plenty of times where they act as though we're ghosts just drifting through in their confined lives.  Some are all about respect, and carry that in from their status outside of the prison in varying gang affiliation.  And they want you to act like they're the superior despite the positional authority difference with their current situation.  6) They train to be better than us.  They work out constantly because a lot of the officers are fat/lazy fucks that don't understand that they work in an environment where they're locked in with a bunch of felons and are outnumbered about 100 to 1.  They start fights just to see what our response time is, how we react to varying situations, to pick out which CO's are weaker, slower, more skittish, unconfident, fold under pressure, fearful.  I've even seen them practicing spinning around 180 and swinging their arms down so that if someone yells Taser they can hopefully react fast enough to deflect the projectiles.  There is little to no limitation on what these guys think of in order to keep the edge.  7) The system is designed to protect them, not us.  Media depiction of asshole CO's being sadists and taking every opportunity to make the inmates lives a living hell has give us a bad reputation.  And in order to try and fix that and keep things up with modern times.  Tons of policies, laws, acts have been put in place that make it to easy for them to manipulate.  Case and point: the Prison Rape Elimination Act.  Great thing, I completely support it and what it stands for, but its flawed.  Example: the inmates in our segregation unit with make false claims of officers sexually harassing them or making sexually explicit derogatory statements to them so they can have the officer put under investigation for a P.R.E.A violation.  That being said, the officer gets temporarily barred from working in segregation.  They did this to about 9 officers in 1 month in order to weed out the more strict officers and make sure they had the lazy overly friendly ones that let them get away with pretty much anything.  And there is no ramification to these false claims.  No extended time in segregation, no charges, not even a slap on the wrist.  So when that officer gets off of investigation it happens all over again.  And yeah, this is a long post but I'm just trying to make a point.  TLDR: Prison isn't to similar to an Asylum and hasn't been for long time.  The problem is that common knowledge of what really goes on is minuscule at best and the media is biased.  Even shows like Lockup where they take cameras in are edited to make it look a certain way.  But AHS: Penitentiary would hold a lot of potential.  At least in my opinion"
AmericanHorrorStory,2v2kp5,mommy2libras,1 point,Sun Feb 8 03:35:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'm not sure how they would work it, being a co-ed cast and most prisons being one sex or the other. Maybe it could be some death row type deal, where people are just waiting to fry. One thing that might be tough to get round is the solitariness of a place like that though. Or maybe it would be a women's prison and the guys be guards? I just don't see there being a mostly female staff at a men's prison, even if there are some. I would be interested to see how they would work out a lot of the details to make it work but I've known a few people who have been in and out of those places and agree absolutely that it would be nothing like Asylum, other than that they are locked up."

It's set in a fictionalized ""gothic-punk"" version of the modern world, where players assume the roles of vampires, who are referred to as ""Kindred"", and deal with their night-to-night struggles against their own bestial natures, vampire hunters and each other.   Several associated products were produced based on Vampire: The Masquerade, including dice, collectible card games (Vampire: The Eternal Struggle), video games (Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines and Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption), and numerous novels. In 1996, a short-lived but successful television show loosely based on the game, Kindred: The Embraced, was produced by Aaron Spelling for the Fox Broadcasting Company.

BTW I completely agree with your point, I really want AHS to bring back a darker thriller tone to it. The only way I think they can achieve that is by cutting down the cast and keep it on level with Murder House, as Freakshow had too many useless characters that didn't contribute much to the story.  PS: Big fan also of Bates Motel, I especially liked season 2."
AmericanHorrorStory,2v1i3m,KristenWiigsTinyHand,6,Sat Feb 7 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"Vera is utterly brilliant. I love how they've done Norma. You would have thought they would have made her a haranguing, cold, distant, matriarch type. But having her as a seductive, hysterical, clingy drama queen is a stroke of genius, making you appreciate why Norman is so screwed up."
AmericanHorrorStory,2v1i3m,Supreme000,2,Sat Feb 7 01:04:28 2015 UTC,Norma is the best.  Here's a compilation of her best freak outs from season 1. Hilarious!  http://youtu.be/cgGd3oieuPE
AmericanHorrorStory,2v1i3m,Supreme000,2,Sat Feb 7 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"I see it different. I don't think Norma made Norman so screwed up. I think he is part of the reason she is so neurotic. She knows what he's about, and she's always trying to be one step ahead. Babying her son because she loves him, but she knows what he is capable of. She would also cover up anything he does. Part of her clings desperately to denial. Pretending life is perfect there, when she knows it isn't.  I see her a bit like Gloria Mott. How she babied Dandy in hopes of keeping his bad side quiet. Catering to him so he don't have a reason to get mad. Norma does the same thing with Norman.  Let's face it, Norman can do crazy all by himself. I don't see mommy completely to blame."
AmericanHorrorStory,2v1i3m,ahandfulofbirds,1 point,Sat Feb 7 04:27:49 2015 UTC,"Good points. Which came first the chicken or the egg? Norma's behaviour is often extremely inappropriate - getting into his bed and cuddling like a lover. She seems to not see Norman as a separate individual at all, more an extension of herself which is classic narcissism or possibly borderline personality disorder. Her other son believes she make things up as well and creates drama. Even if Norman had inbuilt ""tendencies"" I find it hard to believe he isn't developing the way he is because of his mother's seductive nature, not setting proper boundaries and creating a strong incestual vibe. At this point with Norma/Norman (even the names merge!) its almost impossible to talk about who is affecting who as they are fusing into a single, dangerously sealed off, psychological entity. But I will admit the show is doing a great job of showing that's its a perfect storm of factors (his sensitive nature, his mother and other love interests, the weird immoral environment of the town, particular incidents) that are forming Norman not just one thing or person. Its interesting too that we really only know of the couple of big ""incidents"" through Norma's version. I think the writers have left some wiggle room to debate exactly what Norman has or hasn't done (I don't want to spoil anything but I think you know what those incidents were). It would be easier for Norma to pin all the problems on Norman rather than face her own inner demons."
AmericanHorrorStory,2v1i3m,anandamidetrip,1 point,Sat Feb 7 09:21:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting points. I did not see Norma getting into bed with Norman and cuddling him as ""sexual"". I saw it as a mother who doesn't want her child to grow up. To always be that little boy she cuddled.  I do see borderline personality traits in Norman. The ""I hate you, don't leave me"". He seems to have deep resentment towards his mother, but when she starts liking a man, he gets clingy. Jealous even. The question is why. Does he just want to be the center of her world, or does he resent her so much that he can't stand to see her happy?  I think Norma would be happy with Norman dating Emma, the good girl. Norma gets unraveled when Norman likes the bad girls. Isn't that any mother though? It's not jealousy. It's wanting the best for your son. I think the incestual vibe is on Normans part. He is a young man now. Mom is still treating him like that little boy, and it's getting twisted in his mind.   On top of that, she seems to know something about Norman. At times it's almost like she wants to protect him. At times it's like she wants to protect others from him.   I think when Norma sang that song at the audition for the play, we got a glimpse into who she is. It was quite sad. I think she is a broken woman who came from a very unfortunate background. I think she would be happy with the hotel and happy little blue birds on the window sills every morning....but these horrible things keep disrupting that dream for her. She fights back I think, because she has been use to fighting back much of her life.   True we only see certain incidents from Norma's point of view. However, we have gotten a hint from the brother when he said ""I couldn't protect her"". So something did happen to her. At the very least, part of her viewpoint must be right.   I don't see Norma pinning all the problems on Norman. I think she really wanted this fresh start, and Norman keeps getting into these messes....and blackouts.  I think Norma tries hard. When Dylan called her ""mom"", she was deeply touched by that. That also told me she's not that horrible a mother. I think Dylan just has issues with her for abandoning him. Let's face it, he showed up demanding her help, and punishing her for leaving him. Not like he has made the best choices in his life either. That's not Norma's fault, but he seems to want to fault her. Yes he said she makes things up....but that was before he talked to her brother. He seems to have softened to her since then.   We saw this in Gloria Mott as well. She began to question herself. Blame herself. In reality, she did all she could for her son. Probably too much."

AmericanHorrorStory,2v1i3m,anandamidetrip,4,Sat Feb 7 21:28:35 2015 UTC,"Really? I feel like Freak Show and Murder House were at least equal on the cluttering of characters (I actually feel like Freak Show did more with what it had). There were just so many ghosts, they'd introduce something new every episode and it just all got a bit too much in my opinion. Freak Show did have a lot of characters, but I feel like they were more naturally integrated into the story. Murder House used cold opens to introduce characters, whereas Freak Show just had them around, and they would occasionally come into focus. There are obviously some exceptions. I though Freak Show had enough tension as a thriller. I was always worried about who Stanley would go after or manipulate next, or when Dandy was going to come back to the freaks. It felt very neat in comparison to Murder House, where a lot of the ghosts, even major ones like Thaddeus, didn't really do much, despite having been teased consistently throughout. Freak Show, I don't feel, introduced anything major and then left it without a payoff. Murder House did with a few things."
AmericanHorrorStory,2v1i3m,jafolk,4,Sat Feb 7 04:20:44 2015 UTC,"I whole-heartily agree with you except on Freakshow being a thriller. Dandy killed Dora, the gay prostitute, Gloria, Gabourey Sidibe and the Tupperware party ladies. But they executed them to follow an exploitative theme rather than one of a thriller. It was pretty easy to guess Dandy's next move. And he didn't hold any weight to the freakshow storyline until the last 2 episodes. Stanley was only able to have Ma Petite killed. And Salty died on his own. I thought Stanley taking Jimmy's claws in episode 11 was amazingly well-done but it wasn't suspenseful since we knew what had already happened. Freakshow just laid things out. Murder House, while only adding ghosts that could provide exposition on the house, at least had me guessing what would happen next.  Also, Freakshow did suffer from leaving plots with no payoff. Jimmy never mentioned getting revenge on the police after episode 4. Stanley's big dick amounted to nothing more than a gimmick. Ima never affected the story. Cheester's only purpose was to kill Maggie. Dandy's cop never came looking for him. Bette immediately stopped caring about becoming famous. And the cops completely forgot about Jimmy supposedly killing those Tupperware ladies. I know I'm being hypercritical of the season but i'm just trying to point out that it isn't free from faults."
AmericanHorrorStory,2v1i3m,Cduns112,3,Sat Feb 7 07:19:08 2015 UTC,"That's also fair. I have to admit, I was totally uninterested in Murder House, the only twist that really got me was Violet being dead. I didn't see the Rubber Man twist coming but it was more of a disappointment to me than anything else (it felt very out of character and too much like a cheap shock value thing). I absolutely think Freak Show has its flaws! I agree 100% on Chester, he felt like a very rushed addition. Ima I didn't really get bothered by because it felt like she fitted into the desperation to keep the Freak Show going, which played into the themes of the series well. She also interacted with Jimmy's plot. I agree that they shot the reveal of Jimmy's hands down prematurely, but I liked that they followed it through with the prosthetic hands.  I think Jimmy's distrust of the police was still around, he just didn't take revenge. He still opposed them whenever he had interactions with them, and it did sort of come to a head with his arrest later.  It certainly did have its cheap moments and plot holes, but I feel like they impacted it less than any other season (except Coven, but that was very light on the Horror). Asylum was able to put the horror in the forefront because one of the major themes was questioning reality, so that played very well into the elements of horror they had going on. I didn't feel like Asylum had quite as much internal struggle and development as Freak Show though. I love all of American Horror Story (Murder House is my least favourite, but it was still fantastic), I just feel like people seem to overlook what problems Seasons 1 & 2 have, and focus in on every detail of 3 & 4."
AmericanHorrorStory,2v1i3m,Canines_and_Cards,3,Sat Feb 7 07:54:51 2015 UTC,"As someone who loves seasons 1 and 2, we do lol but the writing has suffered even more these past 2 seasons. I enjoyed Freakshow but it lacked any subtly with its theme (although this has always been a big problem in Murphy's show). Beyond ""the real freaks are society"", they never delved further into their theme's of acceptance, rejection, exploitation or self-worth. They only hit the tip of the iceberg but there was so much there to explore.   I really disliked the Rubber Man reveal. Personally I saw it coming (they showed Tate in the suit many times beforehand) but I really thought the twist was going to be that it wasn't the sociopathic school-shooter of the house. I agree that it was used for cheap shock value. MH was fun but they stretched out a lot of plot points (Vivian wanting to leave the house was by far the worst) and the character's didn't act like real people (have the Harmon's ever seen a ghost movie?). They should of kept it as a movie.   Also I didn't like Jimmy as a character. Turning him into a sob, then a drunk, was just so boring. If that was supposed to represent desperation, it was kind of lazy. They should of played with the freaks trying to impress the town and the town trying keep its distance, only to have their curiosities force them to give in and show their true freak selves."

AmericanHorrorStory,2v1i3m,Henry_Burris,3,Sat Feb 7 19:57:36 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, Coven had the potential to have a good amount of thrillers, but it wasn't used. For example, when Cordelia and Hank had weird voodoo sex, a wicked voodoo spirit would grow inside of Cordelia leading to mysterious events in the Academy that would bring about the need for the Council and even an earlier cooperation between the Voodoo practitioners and the white witches. To be clear, this would not be demon-possession (like in Asylum), but more along the lines of a baby-with-voodoo-powers kind of thing, and unlike Murder House, the white and voodoo witches realize they need to kill the child (which is a concept too horrific for even me). Maybe if they didn't place Stevie Nicks so much throughout the season (because I think the Axeman set some events in motion), the story would have some more thriller aspects."

Also that scene takes place about 50 years before Coven or Murder House--not many characters that would fit that age either in either of those seasons. And Bette/Dot would probably be alive and make some sort of appearance at some point in those seasons. Sorry, but the seasons being connected isn't going to be as cut and dry as that--it creates far too many plot holes for even Ryan Murphy to fall into."

AmericanHorrorStory,2v3jjb,monkeysrule123,2,Sat Feb 7 16:22:58 2015 UTC,It'd be cool if this was true.
AmericanHorrorStory,2v3jjb,ahsfreakshow,4,Sun Feb 8 10:08:02 2015 UTC,"They start filming in July. There wouldn't be a notice on the property saying that they will be filming there in five months, that's just seems absurd. If you're trying to convince us that you're telling the truth, then you're gonna have to provide some concrete evidence, word of mouth just doesn't count. Did you or your friend happen to take a picture of whatever source said that AHS was going to film there?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2v3jjb,monkeysrule123,3,Sat Feb 7 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"In OPs defense, people do live in the house. Its a real house. Im sure they were told when they bought the house that ahs filmed there and to expect fans to show up or possibly filming would take place. That being said, if you live next to the house, its possible that the neighbors are friends and said that they wont be there for a while due to the filming. You cant go knocking on their door the day before filming and say get out. You let them know te house will be used. Not saying op is correct, just saying it is no impossible"
AmericanHorrorStory,2v3jjb,monkeysrule123,2,Sun Feb 8 01:04:12 2015 UTC,"Last I checked, the Rosenheim Mansion is still currently for sale. And even if someone does currently own it, it doesn't necessarily mean that someone physically lives inside it. Nowadays the house is literally a celebrity and is a prominent filming location for all kinds of shows and commercials and music videos and what not, so it would probably drive that family nuts having to constantly deal with film crews coming in and out. Also I hope you're aware that they never actually filmed inside the Rosenheim mansion. They used the interior of the house as a model and built sets on a soundstage based on it; the only scenes filmed on the property were the exterior shots."
AmericanHorrorStory,2v3jjb,ahsfreakshow,1 point,Sun Feb 8 03:42:27 2015 UTC,I was going to write how i heard they only filmed the pilot there but i wasnt sure it was true.

AmericanHorrorStory,2v3jjb,BartuHTC,1 point,Sun Feb 8 04:07:30 2015 UTC,Also Lots  of famous houses are owned by people. Some are museums like the Christmas story house. Some totally have owners like father of the brides house(i think).
AmericanHorrorStory,2v3jjb,Sugaredvenom,1 point,Sun Feb 8 04:09:23 2015 UTC,"I know, that's the point I was making. Keep in mind there's a difference between simply owning the property and physically living on it. I'm not saying it isn't possible for the house to be lived in, I'm just saying it's totally possible for someone to not live in it and just profit from it being used for filming. And like I said, last I checked the house was still for sale, so regardless I don't see anyone being on the property in the first place."
AmericanHorrorStory,2v3jjb,CustosClavium,-2,Sun Feb 8 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"They probably have to reserve the property in advance for filming... and yes, I know they don't film in the house. They need exterior shots though..."

AmericanHorrorStory,2uxm0s,rachel_5199,5,Fri Feb 6 16:41:22 2015 UTC,It would have been similar but you lose the entire story arc of Mary Eunice when she starts flaunting her innocence around she really comes into character. Even if it is a possessed nun
AmericanHorrorStory,2uxm0s,TenaciousD3,3,Fri Feb 6 16:47:46 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting, but Jude isn't ""pure"", or weak enough, so it would never happen."

AmericanHorrorStory,2uxrib,ImFunnierInRealLife,2,Fri Feb 6 01:37:11 2015 UTC,"Is it the little whistling noise that accompanies Tate Langdon and the Antichrist at the end?  Then it's actually been around for a while. There was an old movie called Twisted Nerve (1968) and that's where the song comes from- and it's been used widely, including in Kill Bill."

AmericanHorrorStory,2uxrib,Snork_Nork,2,Fri Feb 6 14:24:32 2015 UTC,"Nope, not that song.  This was the scene I was referring to, it sounds very similar but not quite the same.  It plays again a little further into the film, too. Doesn't seem to be on the official soundtrack though."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uxrib,Snork_Nork,2,Fri Feb 6 14:47:32 2015 UTC,"oh. that also plays in the end credits. Waaaay different. Its called Gyroscope, by Boards of Canada. It does show up on youtube under the soundtrack list for Sinister."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uxrib,3R1C,1 point,Fri Feb 6 14:52:48 2015 UTC,Yeah BOC is a noise/sound art/experimental group that has a lot of similar sounding pieces. I believe the effect comes from a certain kind of field recording. Not sure.

AmericanHorrorStory,2ux706,lurkingphoenix,2,Fri Feb 6 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"Also there was supposed to be what looked like multiple scenes in the first of half the season involving Dell and a gun and some internal issues.  I forget the exact episode but Dell didn't have a major role in the final cut.  Looking back, this scene would have made a lot of sense now that we know his full story.  EDIT: Found it; it was Mordrake part 2."

AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,drflanigan,26,Wed Feb 4 22:58:41 2015 UTC,"I've got a love/hate relationship with FF. When its done well and genuinely feels like FF, like Blair Witch and the first Paranormal Activity, it can be absolutely chilling particularly when they use the ""less is more"" approach to showing the scary stuff that lets your imagination run rampant. 13 hours would be way too much FF for AHS though. Maybe if they embedded FF in the show like a private investigator investigating the disappearance of young girl. He learns of  accounts of a Slenderman type figure lurking near children that go missing. He comes across an abandoned house of man who has stored videos murkily showing this strange figure. Or he has to collect all the videos scattered about to piece together what happened to the girl. Or maybe he is anonymously emailed a video with weird Ring type imagery that he has to decode. And they could incorporate a website which has more FF on it and links to other websites deepening the mystery for viewers to hunt."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,girlsjiggle,6,Thu Feb 5 00:42:38 2015 UTC,Best FF movie to me was As Above So Below.  Woked out so well for me.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,JonnyBrah,5,Thu Feb 5 01:06:15 2015 UTC,Some of the clips from VHS/VHS 2 are genuinely terrifying. SO and I watched it and I had nightmares and felt a little unnerved by some of them.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,islandeyes,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:23:37 2015 UTC,I feel like that movie could have been just as awesome if they were just searching for treasure and not trapped in Hell.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,PoopySmellyFartButt,2,Thu Feb 5 05:22:10 2015 UTC,I agree. Paranormal Activity was the only horror movie that genuinely scared me. The Blair Witch Project is also very good.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,israeldmo,0,Fri Feb 6 05:03:32 2015 UTC,Can you explain your opinion on the first Paranormal Activity? I saw it in theaters and was literally laughing the entire movie. To me it was the horror version of Snakes on a Plane.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Soccerdweebz,5,Thu Feb 5 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"I guess I can see how a door opening slowly, nothing happening and then closing again could be seen a laughingly simplistic and boring. I know people say similar things about Blair Witch ""Nothing happens!"". But my psychology finds that sense of something entering the room that you can't see absolutely chilling. It lets my imagination go into overdrive - less can be so much more in horror. Its like when I was a little kid with the covers pulled over me (with only a little breathe hole for air) - nothing was more terrifying than what could be on the other side of those blankets. And the simplicity of it lets me buy into it. I could really see that sort of haunting taking place rather than a big special effects driven drama."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,girlsjiggle,2,Thu Feb 5 21:41:38 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for the response. I can totally see why that would be scary to some people.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Soccerdweebz,27,Fri Feb 6 12:39:10 2015 UTC,"That could be awesome. It could also be horribly, horribly bad."

AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Siri0usly,37,Thu Feb 5 11:48:08 2015 UTC,"Meh, I've never really been a huge fan of the shaky, first person video style of those types of movies. I have to strain to make sure I don't miss anything. Although the Paranormal Activity movies did it well by having some scenes with a stationary camera. But to each their own I suppose."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Taylor_Satine,14,Wed Feb 4 23:25:27 2015 UTC,I get motion sickness and always find myself getting nauseous watching found footage  films. I usually just avoid them. I had to turn Quarantine off when I tried to watch it. A bit here and there might be ok but I couldn't watch a whole series of it.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Kaka__,2,Thu Feb 5 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"Oh god Clover Field is the worst, if you haven't seen it don't bother. Apart from the fact that it's a shit movie, it gave me the worst motion sickness. The first real still shot happened near the end and I've never been so happy to stare at footage from a camera dropped in the grass."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Laur-Ent,2,Thu Feb 5 02:44:38 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely. It always gets such praise, but I found it horrendously boring with horrible quality. I even tried to watch Blair Witch Project and wasn't very impressed (much better than Cloverfield, but not too good)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,RestrictedAxcess,2,Thu Feb 5 05:22:07 2015 UTC,"Just really terrible. But the scene where they were in the subway tunnel and they turned on the night vision and saw all the alien things did kind of make me pee my pants a bit, I have to admit. But that was the only part that I even slightly enjoyed. Blair Witch Project was probably the scariest movie I've seen, but I was also really really high when I saw it. I basically had PTSD afterwards."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Laur-Ent,2,Thu Feb 5 06:56:11 2015 UTC,I was terrified of the facing the corner scene when I believed it was real.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Soperos,12,Thu Feb 5 11:16:07 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be an interesting direction, but I've always felt cinematography was an area that AHS excelled in. I feel a found footage season would kill that element."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Mushroomer,6,Thu Feb 5 02:00:10 2015 UTC,That would be exhausting for 10+ hours of television. For a 90-120 minute movie it can work but it would probably get old quickly in a TV series.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,leftshoe18,1 point,Thu Feb 5 01:44:49 2015 UTC,What about if it was like that vantage point movie?  12 perspectives of different cameras of the same event. Each showing new things.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Snork_Nork,10,Thu Feb 5 02:24:02 2015 UTC,Kind of like the pouchkeepsie tapes?  that would be slightly interesting if so.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Soperos,2,Thu Feb 5 00:25:12 2015 UTC,That might be the worst movie I have ever seen. No serial killer would ever be like that ever.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Snork_Nork,2,Thu Feb 5 11:16:54 2015 UTC,"really? the worst? HAHA  not going to side track the topic but, am sure there is faaaaar worse out there."

AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,dailyblumpkins,-2,Thu Feb 5 16:14:42 2015 UTC,no. I like american horror story because it's not actually all THAT scary
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Snork_Nork,1 point,Thu Feb 5 00:46:41 2015 UTC,haha... in the found tapes and scenes aspect. Am not fond of the cloverfield shaky type of effect.   But found tapes... recorded in a location with a sort of a message from the dead type of deal would be cool.

AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,gaarasgourd,6,Thu Feb 5 05:48:10 2015 UTC,I think that would be really interesting but the cinematography in this show is one of the reasons I love it so much and I feel like a found-footage style would sacrifice it for a more realistic approach which in my opinion wouldn't fit well with the show but maybe a couple seasons down the road?
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,AmericanHorror_Story,0,Thu Feb 5 00:38:54 2015 UTC,It might work. Think about all the cameras we have everywhere. If it was government based they could have different types of cameras everywhere.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,lexiiluther,5,Thu Feb 5 00:43:47 2015 UTC,The season would be cancelled by episode 4

AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,Dreadzy,3,Thu Feb 5 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"The concept is pretty cool, but found footage style is literally just shaky images or very long still shots. You'd get a headache within 2 episodes. So nah..."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,signu1230,1 point,Thu Feb 5 08:44:20 2015 UTC,"If they incorporated it into bits and pieces it might be cool. Like only really use it in certain parts or incorporate it into the story line, but I agree that an entire season of it would be a little too much."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,newo_kat,2,Fri Feb 6 23:25:29 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be awesome. One of the plot twists could be finding out who was taking the footage, if it's a serial killer or some sort of murderer."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,bloogun,2,Thu Feb 5 00:44:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would work terribly well.  AHS as a series is a very visual show.  It takes great pride in its settings and costumes.  Having a found footage styled show would skip over that, unless the characters panned across the room every time we had a scene change.  Also, a lot of the violent/gory scenes that make it a horror show would be blurred through shaky cam."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,cosmicpizza666,2,Thu Feb 5 05:31:16 2015 UTC,"I think found footage elements would be awesome! I think one person's story could be like that, though I do agree that a while season would be overkill.   Personally I'm hoping for a Pacific Northwest season with a bigfoot, summer campers,  and creepy cults in the woods. I also think that a Southwest season that incorporates Navajo and other Native American traditions would be cool (skinwalkers anybody?)."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ut359,lurkingphoenix,2,Thu Feb 5 13:44:44 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I wanted. Set in a small Twin Peaks like town with creepy things going on and no one knows whether it's because of the cryptid or a human killer.

AmericanHorrorStory,2usz3o,chattypenguin,12,Fri Feb 6 03:20:26 2015 UTC,I think Murphy and Falchuk got fixated on playing out the image of Lange as kickass Queen Bee bitch to the detriment of variety and an interesting horror story. Constance and Sr Jude were brilliantly realised characters but she doesn't always have to be the leader. Some variety would have been nice.
AmericanHorrorStory,2usz3o,girlsjiggle,8,Thu Feb 5 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"She's a good actress, and her characters were all awesome...but I would have enjoyed seeing her play more characters than just the badass bitch who calls the shots."

I agree that everything kind of focused on her and I think the show will be a lot more balanced now. While I know she makes the show popular and I don't want her fans to leave, nor do I have anything against her or the fans, but I just don't think she was as talented as don't of the others in the series and I'm content with her exit."

Hannibal brilliantly covers a lot of that ground as well. I thought Freak Show would have worked really well as a murder mystery with deaths popping up after the freak show rolls into town - it would have given the viewer some intrigue and mystery. I could definitely see Evan playing a cop - he's got that tenacious look about him. Maybe he starts a new job as a cop in a small town where things don't seem quite right and the town has strange, creepy secrets he starts to uncover."

Or maybe the Operation top hat created mutants living near, and feeding off, the camp. Definitely in the running."

AmericanHorrorStory,2up09h,EverydayCynic,1 point,Wed Feb 11 23:40:51 2015 UTC,"or maybe mix both ideas & have the summer camp be some sort of human behavior experiment inside area 51 (sort of like a truman show thing) where the people holding the experiments release the monsters/whatever they're testing unto the camp to see how people/test subjects interact with each other, and when everything inevitably goes wrong and the monsters kill everyone/whatever they evacuate the camp into the ""town"" Massimo said he built and they then blow everything up using atomic bombs and keep the murders/test a secret and name it Top Hat?   sorry if I keep spewing shit out i'm kinda bored atm"
AmericanHorrorStory,2un4ys,what-3,9,Tue Feb 3 15:17:51 2015 UTC,"I like this concept, except maybe more of a gated community setting. It might sound a bit trope-y for a horror setting, but I think it would fit nicely with your concept. There would be the conspiracist-crazy neighbors, and the psychopathic white-collar neighbors who commune with aliens/abduct neighbors for hostel-themed parties with other crazies."
AmericanHorrorStory,2un4ys,Canines_and_Cards,7,Tue Feb 3 18:41:36 2015 UTC,i really hope they don't do anything with aliens. just my preference.
AmericanHorrorStory,2un4ys,the_pissed_off_goose,7,Tue Feb 3 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"I think this would be a really cool season, similar to The Cabin In the Woods but more drawn out and dramatic"
AmericanHorrorStory,2un4ys,thisisusandme,3,Tue Feb 3 16:03:21 2015 UTC,"This is actually not too crazy of an idea. This makes the cult theory possible, while also incorporating elements from the Top Hat theory. Experiments could occur by Truman Show-like scientists, cult-inspired. Then when all else fails, people start to realize, then it ends with a countdown to nuclear demolition.   Also, if its a town like this, what if the aerial shots (commonly linked with the following season) represents a map of the town? http://i.imgur.com/MdHu1Wu.png?1"
AmericanHorrorStory,2un4ys,kevintom,1 point,Fri Feb 6 17:05:27 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping it's about nuclear testing/human experimentation/area 51 stuff. I have a feeling aliens will be a big part of it so they can link it to Asylum.

AmericanHorrorStory,2um71e,-DD,11,Tue Feb 3 17:23:27 2015 UTC,A few of the episodes in Freak Show had some of the highest ratings in AHS history. I think they're doing pretty well with their number of viewers. :-)

AmericanHorrorStory,2um71e,mistar_z,1 point,Wed Feb 4 03:55:23 2015 UTC,Watched that. I'm not interested in a documentary. I'm curious to see how Ryan may spin his twisted mind on a porn horror :)
AmericanHorrorStory,2um71e,Canines_and_Cards,3,Wed Feb 4 05:44:59 2015 UTC,"I think Law and Order SVU has enough disturbing themes revolving around primal sexual appetite and those that support it. If AHS delved into this, they could probably reuse the nymphomania that Shelley (Sevigny) had in Asylum. They could also include the female empowerment themes from Coven. For example, the prostitutes who are there against their will (immigrants and such) rise up against the mob bosses. Of course, the theme of police tyranny from Freak Show; those working in law enforcement having connections/protecting the mobs and their brothels."
AmericanHorrorStory,2um71e,chattypenguin,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:56:53 2015 UTC,Yeah cool ideas. I'm really hoping they would delve into that subject matter. But I doubt Ryan would though

AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,saveusnck,3,Tue Feb 3 23:58:29 2015 UTC,"So why was misty allowed to go on when she could barely move the candle. Everyone else could do it flawlessly. Also they weren't supposed to be playing tag with transmutation, they just did. What if the each did it once so zoe never got hurt?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,monkeysrule123,5,Wed Feb 4 15:20:48 2015 UTC,She didn't transmutate onto the fence she transmutated into the tree onto a branch that couldn't support her. That's why you hear snapping branches. She was obviously quite good at transmutation and bad at judging the potential load-bearing qualities of branches. I don't think that disqualifies a witch from the supremacy.   Keep in mind that there's a supreme in every generation and there were three generations of witches in the coven. It's highly likely she was the next next supreme since she completed all the seven wonders over the course of the season.
AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,diabolic_nachoes,1 point,Wed Feb 4 06:55:35 2015 UTC,"That makes me wonder, can the council perform the seven wonders at the next rise of the supreme? Could Cordelia have put Zoe there to protect herself in thirty years?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,kyroko,1 point,Wed Feb 4 13:24:29 2015 UTC,"I think typically the council was always a group of ""elders"" who'd already had the chance to prove themselves so it wouldn't have come up previously. Theoretically the supremacy could've skipped Zoe when she died or else Cordelia would have a very short reign.   Either way I don't think Cordelia would ever knowingly put herself first at the expense of the coven"
AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,diabolic_nachoes,1 point,Wed Feb 4 13:44:52 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought as well.  Zoe, despite being the newest member of the coven was able to do a lot of stuff beyond her initial deadly lady parts.  She was able to work with Madison to bring Kyle back from the dead, she was somehow able to find the right spellbook to get the Axeman out of the house, she was able to restore Spalding's tongue, and she was able to perform most of the Seven Wonders.  And this was all without taking any classes or guidance from the leaders of the school.  Had Zoe been the Supreme, she would have been even younger than Fiona, who was already the youngest Supreme in history.  I wouldn't be surprised if Zoe became the Supreme in the future, but not now."
AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,signu1230,0,Mon Feb 9 04:58:53 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean she failed.  She did the transmutation.  She just died in the process.
AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,Innunim,4,Wed Feb 4 14:27:38 2015 UTC,"That's why she failed. She has to master it, and by dying, she didn't perfect it"
AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,mistar_z,5,Wed Feb 4 16:00:17 2015 UTC,I don't understand how more people don't get this.
AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,AChickenTender,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:03:51 2015 UTC,"She didn't exactly pass then...  Figuratively if they brought misty back and she completed the last trials,she still failed,and probably would fail again if tried."
AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,SimeonsDilemma,2,Sun Feb 8 09:34:40 2015 UTC,It is heavily implied that Cordelia's suppression of her powers channeled them into the other girls. Zoe probably can't do all of the seven wonders on her own anymore.
AmericanHorrorStory,2unv38,yer1,1 point,Wed Feb 4 14:36:36 2015 UTC,"It's a head canon of mine that Zoe could very well end up being the Supreme that succeeds Cordelia. She was at one point or another able to perform all seven wonders during the series, she just hadn't mastered them yet as a teenager. Since we know that it was out of the ordianry that Fiona ascended so young, I wouldn't be surprised if Ryan Murphy one day revealed that say 10 to 15 years down the line, Zoe becomes the Supreme when Cordelia's powers begin fading."

AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,girlsjiggle,9,Mon Feb 2 05:40:30 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this, actually. Many of the characters have more in common than just the recurring actors who play them. Jessica Lange's characters are the most obvious examples of this: strong-willed, cunning, morally-ambiguous matriarchs desperate to keep hold onto power, beauty, fame, or love, but she's far from the only one. Evan Peter's characters are sensitive, tragic romantics with savior and victim complexes. Sarah Paulson's characters (with the exception of Billie Dean, I guess) have been plucky, underestimated heroines who always manage to get out alive. Emma Roberts has played a beautiful but self-centered girl, and Taissa Farmiga has played sullen teenager. Denis O'Hare plays a strange man who always ends up disfigured somehow. I'm sure you guys get the point.  Maybe it's just sloppy writing, or limited range in the actor's abilities, but I don't know. I do kind of feel like the 'connection' between all the seasons is that the characters are basically the same people, with new names and backstories, plopped into various scenarios throughout history. Like someone is testing them..."

Somebody also posted a picture not too long ago that showed a close up of Madison's corpse when she was discovered in Spaulding's attic and Maggie's corpse when she was sawed in half--she had the exact same drop of blood trickling down from her mouth in both scenes.  Maybe it's fanservice, maybe the writers are out of fresh ideas. Or maybe it's all intentional. Who knows!  edit: sawed, not sewn"
AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,the_skeleton_queen,1 point,Tue Feb 3 01:41:32 2015 UTC,"This really has me thinking now! This is a valid possibility!  I mean I was complaining they kept chopping off Kathy Bates head....but maybe this has all been intentional! It makes sense! ...I'm connecting soooo many things now. Yes, you're so right...motherhood, pregnancy and birth. Also...children killing parents... Kyle killing his mother. Penny killing her father. Cordelia basically killing Fiona....and Myrtle, (a mother figure to her). I'm sure there is more. There has also been mother's killing their children repeated each season. Mass murder repeated...Dandy shooting at the freakshow and Kit's school shooting. As well as Kathy's head getting cut off, Spalding/Stanley both times tongue cut out."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,Supreme000,2,Tue Feb 3 02:39:14 2015 UTC,plus Bette killed their mother too. did I miss something? idr ethel having her head cut off...

AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,Supreme000,2,Tue Feb 3 05:38:02 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I'm so glad I finally can discuss this with somebody!   So much of the show is centered around family, and especially perversions of motherhood, that I don't think it's unintentional at all. I hadn't thought about the children killing parents (don't forget Bette and Dotte killed their mother, too!) or parents killing (or attempting to kill) their children. But they tie into the theme perfectly. Too perfectly, maybe!  I think the last theme that really convinces me that karma/reincarnation is the tie between each season is resurrection, or rebirth. The Infantata, Kyle, Zoe, Madison and Misty were all brought back from the dead in a literal way. The victims in Murder House were able to come back as ghosts and long to fulfill unfinished earthly business, and ghosts played a small but similar role in Freakshow.  Then there are the symbolic resurrections or rebirths, also known as those killer redemption arcs. Many characters redeem themselves only to end up dead. I kind of feel like each of the characters are being tested, and whenever they finally 'pass' that test, they are somehow killed. If the karma theory is true, maybe that is their reward for redeeming themselves so that they can have a go in another life.  I don't know... there's probably a lot more solid evidence but I can't think of any right now. Looks like I've got some binge rewatching to do.  as if I'm upset about that..."

AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,Supreme000,1 point,Tue Feb 3 02:42:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe another way of looking at Sarah Paulson's characters is they have all been very trusting, almost niave. Lana could have never seen the horror she faced as she went in to make a story on the asylum. She was too trusting, or she could not comprehend the real danger her job could put her in. She walked out of there wiser and stronger.   Cordelia was very trusting. Had a husband who was cheating on her and killing witches, while she was making magic potions and refusing to use her witchcraft. She too went through hell and walked out stronger and wiser. The Supreme.    Ironic that in Bette and Dot, you have those qualities all at once. Bette being niave and trusting, while Dot was cynical and stronger."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,Supreme000,2,Tue Feb 3 05:55:34 2015 UTC,"That's very true--definitely a better way of explaining her character than what I came up with!  Interesting also that, with the exceptions of Bette and Dot, her characters also end up with TV appearances. Her characters don't have the desire for fame and adoration that Jessica Lange's characters possess, though. Her characters seem to be the most complex and widely-ranged, out of everyone's."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,the_skeleton_queen,2,Wed Feb 4 01:30:18 2015 UTC,"Actually it was your definition of their characters that made me think deeper and come up with that Bette/Dot theory. lol  OMG you are right. Her characters end up on TV. Yet another great connection. You are so right about her characters being more complex. Almost like ying yang. Both good and bad.  Oh, and another connection of the themes. Misty Day was such a sweet soul. Then of all people, she got stuck in hell because she could not get past her hurt.  Sister Mary Eunice was such a sweet soul. She got possessed and dies. Both characters good and sweet, yet end up in a form of hell.  You are so right. There has to be a connection."

Only because that all sounds very sci-fi not horror. I really hope they keep it more horror than sci-fi."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,MissKytten,3,Tue Feb 3 22:17:14 2015 UTC,I wasn't feeling it either. until I did some research on Project Top Hat. Also Project Paperclip. There were a lot of little secret gov't projects then. They brought over the scientists from Germany after the war. These were some sicko guys. One was known for sewing people together to make a Siamese twin. Another one would operate on people without sedating them. Just to look around and explore the human body. A lot of human/animal DNA testing trying to make a better human. Like putting cat DNA in humans to make humans with night vision. Stalin was big on making a human chimpanzee hybrid. To make the perfect soldier. These were his and Hitlers scientists.  There is a lot of horror in the experiments they did in those projects.

Nope, this stuff really happened. A lot of scientist escaped to US rather than face war crimes. US actually recruited them. How did we not know this stuff. They never taught me this in History class."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,Supreme000,3,Wed Feb 4 02:13:55 2015 UTC,"I like this theory. It's almost like my theory except that this is a lot more believable.   Basically, what I think is that the aliens from season 2 will play a bigger role in the future of the series and what their role is that they ""change rolls"" or consciousness of the characters to be someone else in different timelines/dimensions. A sort of Twilight Zone-esque type of season: not necessary horror, but more of a terror/weird theme."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,TallDarkAndOkay,4,Thu Feb 5 13:53:48 2015 UTC,"Very well thought out. I like it. It could also simply be a very poetic tribute and good bye to Jessica Lange, from the show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uhm0u,Supreme000,2,Mon Feb 2 15:23:05 2015 UTC,"One thing I've noticed is Sarah Paulson's character cutting her finger. I know it's not exactly groundbreaking but she cuts her finger on a flower Pepper gives her in Asylum, and she cuts her finger in Coven when she's frantically searching for clues from Misty's disappearance."

AmericanHorrorStory,2um4x4,drflanigan,8,Tue Feb 3 07:21:37 2015 UTC,From the wording to refer to him and the hierarchy he served within the coven the viewer is lead to believe/assume that Quentin is in fact a male witch/warlock without it being openly said. I think it was just one of those things RM left without actually saying in the season.   Remember the witches in Coven (even a male witch) mastered a specific craft and seemingly knew others but were not masters of it. Perhaps he needed the supreme to help him accomplish his fame. Only she mastered the 7 wonders.
AmericanHorrorStory,2um4x4,Snork_Nork,13,Tue Feb 3 20:25:36 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure Ryan Murphy referred to him as a warlock.
AmericanHorrorStory,2um4x4,BionicFunhouse,7,Tue Feb 3 14:36:22 2015 UTC,"He is a warlock, that is very clear. The witches were entirely concerned with secrecy,  until Cordelia's reveal.  Why would they bring a human man to serve a prestigious position on the witches council just because they like him? Fiona doesn't say anything alluding to him being human,  she simply states that it was her magic that made him and his book famous."
AmericanHorrorStory,2um4x4,IamLegba,0,Tue Feb 3 18:55:03 2015 UTC,"You make good points but I disagree that it's made ""very clear"". Very clear would be some form of explicit proof (him exhibiting powers or it being said) which we didn't have.   As for the whole secrecy thing, you're forgetting Spaulding who knew all about the coven and wasn't magical himself. He even stated that the men in his family have always served the coven, so they must have all known. Oh and Myrtle's albino body guards, male, didn't exhibit any powers explicitly (can't be sure who or what was allowing them to transmute, ie appear and disappear, with Myrtle) and obviously knew all about the coven (they were kind of the coven's henchmen, bodyguarding a council member and physically burning the condemned at the stake).   Oh and even though not all witches have the same powers, surely he could have done the book thing himself via a spell if he was magical? Zoe and Madison used, basically a resurgence spell (badly) but that spell existed.   The thing is, we never see actual evidence of a male witch. Ever. The closest link is Laveau stating Tituba learned her magic from a Shaman (who typically are male). Then we have the fact that Murphy was working off of the Salem witch trials where only women were accused. And though the school was a girls school, even the witches we see before the school existed were only women.   We have other things like Zoe's mother saying magic effects some of the women in her family etc. I think it would have come up if there were male witches. But this is just my opinion, I'm not saying anyone is definitely right or wrong.   It could just be that male witches are super rare though and I'm totally wrong."
AmericanHorrorStory,2um4x4,Lyco_499,-1,Wed Feb 4 22:13:27 2015 UTC,"Ok maybe not very clear, but very heavily implied by the way they explain the coven and the council. Yes there were other humans involved with the coven,  Spaulding and the henchmen most notably, all of which are basically involved with the coven by their servitude... far off from leading the coven as a member of the council. Also, there were plenty of men accused of witchcraft and even tried during the actual Salem witch trials,  so I'm not sure what you mean about only women being accused. Either way,  if you read the articles with interviews from Murphy that another user posted below,  you will see that there are in fact male witches in the coven universe.  Quentin included."
AmericanHorrorStory,2um4x4,IamLegba,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really don't know why I said only women were accused, that was a mega stupid thing to say. I'm blaming the fact that I'd been drinking lol."

Do you really think that every witch has the ability to make themselves famous? Fiona was the most powerful, she clearly demonstrated her ability to influence others to her will, and she wasn't afraid to use her magic for personal gain. Is it really that hard to believe that he was a warlock that just didn't have the right power to get himself ahead?"

But the story felt meandering to me, they didn't utilise the freak show or other horror tropes much, everything was layed out for the viewer instead of keeping some intrigue and mystery, I didn't find the characters authentic or believable, and whilst there were some interesting themes it felt half-baked and in desperate need of rewriting."

They need to get back to working their ass off to develop a strong story - Stanley, a small conman, twiddling his moustache as he runs off to commit mass murder after a wink wink from the nice middle class museum lady to make some money just doesn't make sense as a plot. All it leads to is the somewhat tedious ""who gunna die this week"" thing. They need to utilise the horror tropes that come out of the setting instead of indulgently pursuing these soapy type stories and then throwing in lots of killings and pseudo-shocking gore to bump up the horror quotient. I just doubt they are willing to do the back breaking writing work anymore. It all comes from that."

The rest of the cast is rather dull, however. I find the twins the most annoying.    It's still not ""bad"", technically, but the other seasons were better. Murder House and Asylum were my favorites though. Coven was good as well. I hope they return to their former glory in the next season. If there is one.    But who knows. Others might love Freak Show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ujinj,OhItsPatrick,2,Sat Feb 21 13:16:56 2015 UTC,I'd have to choose Murder House. :S I love every single season equally but I didn't connect with any of the characters in MH like I do with the rest of the seasons.

AmericanHorrorStory,2ujinj,Princessluna44,1 point,Mon Feb 2 23:37:57 2015 UTC,Asylum. I felt there were too many subplots. Anne Frank and the little sociopath weren't needed. I'm not sure what Dr. Harden's Nazi past really did for the show. I also kind of hate the possession arch. My favorite part was the Bloody Face arc.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ujinj,jonjawnjahnsss,1 point,Sun Feb 8 17:57:22 2015 UTC,I agree with you with the fact that Asylum felt very packed with subplots but have you seen Freak Show? One of the things you mentioned does get elaborated upon.

AmericanHorrorStory,2ufizc,treslor,7,Mon Feb 2 02:56:45 2015 UTC,Wow!  That makes the ending better. I thought her going to the Freak Show in the Sky was a little generous considering what a turd she was.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ufizc,jumped-up-pantry-boy,8,Mon Feb 2 02:22:54 2015 UTC,I disagree.  I think her life was shitty enough; she did not need to be eternally punished.

AmericanHorrorStory,2ufizc,jumped-up-pantry-boy,6,Mon Feb 2 13:43:36 2015 UTC,"There's a fan theory that all the seasons of AHS are just different iterations of the same souls going through cycles of life and death in hell à la Coven, so some people went a little farther and projected that  as the show goes on, the fates of the characters will get lighter and lighter, mirroring the progression of Dante's Divine Comedy (Inferno, Purgatorio, and then finally Paradiso).   Obviously the show doesn't fit perfectly, but I was rather pleased to see the ending that we got rather than an ending with everyone burning in hell/Elsa being tortured in her own individual hell/Elsa staying with Mordrake forever. I think that it can be interpreted as either Heaven or Purgatory- the Elsa Mars that wanted fame and glory would've seen it as Purgatory, stuck working at the freakshow forever, but Elsa at the end, having learned that fame isn't worth anything without loved ones, sees it as a Heaven. I think everyone pretty clearly acknowledges that they died in various ways (particularly Ethel), so it's definitely not a reset as we saw with Misty Day's hell."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ufizc,notyetadoctor,1 point,Mon Feb 2 06:34:04 2015 UTC,That would interesting. Would the events play out like in life? Like with the freaks dying off and her going through all that?

Used to be obsessed with them in high school. Conspiracies and cryptozoology. I can't deal with Mothman though. The idea of a gigantic furry flying man is just too terrifying to me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uiq79,amelia84,2,Mon Feb 2 21:15:42 2015 UTC,"Conspiracy would be a rather loose concept, mostly because we want to see something new. By new, I mean people who aren't just insane or truthful about what they see. For example, we observed Kit being picked at and experimented by aliens, but no one else really sees them (up until Sister Jude sees 'em). In FS, Chester claims that Marjorie is a real woman who talks to him and not just a puppet, whereas everyone else in the camp know that he's delusional.  I can't see how Conspiracy would really bring anything new outside of government conspiracy. No cryptozoology and the characters that take part in it would amuse me, personally.   I can't deal with Mothman though. The idea of a gigantic furry flying man is just too terrifying to me.   Agreed, just reading that name brought back teenage nightmares."

I believe the supreme is the top witch in general, but I could be wrong.   I think witches as a whole are dying out, not just that coven.  Still, it's been a year since I've seen any of Coven, so I could be way off."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ueyc5,smewchies,4,Sun Feb 1 16:20:47 2015 UTC,I think being able to do seven wonders technically makes you the best because you can do everything anyone else can so ypu understand how it works and you can do more than them by default of being supreme.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ueyc5,asuka_is_my_co-pilot,7,Sun Feb 1 20:25:27 2015 UTC,"The impression I got was that the Supreme was the top witch in that coven.  The existence of Marie Laveau as a ""Voodoo Queen"" (What I interpret to be just a different brand of magic/witch), and the conversation she has with Fiona in the salon about Tituba and her gifting some aspect of her magic to the white witches makes me think that the world of witchcraft in Coven is much more complicated than just ""She's the most powerful witch of all, anywhere"".  What I think is that witches are a dying breed, but there are many covens in the world, each (potentially) with a different supreme.   They talk about family lines at several points in the series, too, and that leads me to believe that the members of the covens are connected through family lines in some way.   That's just my pet theory, I don't know if it's disprovable or not but it's how I look at the series when I watch it.  Also, Coven is my favorite season. I've watched it 4 times at this point."

AmericanHorrorStory,2ueyc5,AgentVague,6,Mon Feb 2 07:11:12 2015 UTC,"Different strokes for different folks.  It has a lot of the things I like a television show to have: 1) Magic 2) Strong female leads 3) a dark / visceral sort of feel to it  I really like the way they handled their lore surrounding magic. It's twisted, and involves a lot of pain and hardship to do anything substantial. It's dangerous. I think a lot of supernatural shows that incorporate Magic make it too fluffy. Too easy.  Overall I really enjoyed the ambiance of the show. It captures a certain type of wonder and fear. Like if Harry Potter had been a girl and had been thrown into a magic school that doubled as an insane asylum / was filled with murderers."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ueyc5,Molag_Balls,6,Mon Feb 2 19:05:13 2015 UTC,"As the next Supreme comes into her powers, the current one gets weaker until she eventually dies and the next Supreme is then at full power. Every Supreme to date has been able to complete the Seven Wonders without dying, and that's how they figure out who it is but it's possible she and other witches can have totally different powers than the seven they test for.  The Supreme is basically queen of the witches, and it's not just a title either, Fiona is supposed to have duties but she's left them all to the council and spent her time enjoying only the benefits of being the Supreme.  Witches, in the US at least, are dying out."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ueyc5,ZomNoms,4,Sun Feb 1 17:59:02 2015 UTC,I think this sums it up the best. Fiona shirked her responsibilities as the Supreme to the coven and just enjoyed the benefits of her station instead.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ueyc5,scarymisscarrie,3,Sun Feb 1 22:42:25 2015 UTC,"The new supreme is kind of complicated. But it's generally accepted if you can complete the 7 wonders and the previous supreme is dead, you are the next.   Top witch. Period.  And witches as a whole are dying out, or so it seems."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ueyc5,CoalmineXIII,3,Sun Feb 1 17:17:25 2015 UTC,I don't think the witches are dying out... But I can't really say anything as you haven't finished it yet!   I think it's more that witches are more suppressed and don't embrace their powers.

AmericanHorrorStory,2ueyc5,_Lady_Deadpool_,3,Sun Feb 1 18:58:06 2015 UTC,"The supreme is the most powerful witch and can perform all the 7 wonders. There can only be one (possibly only one in total, or maybe one in every coven). The supreme begins to lose her powers as another younger supreme rises to takeover.. The witches ARE dying out- due to obvious persecution and human fear of them. Because they are dying out, the coven here most likely believes there is only one supreme in existence. If another appears, maybe things will change... ;)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ueyc5,leftmeow,2,Tue Feb 10 16:09:43 2015 UTC,"There is a council and a convention that they mention later in the season. Fiona gets reprimanded for not attending the convention and I believe Myrtle said something about Fiona being an ""awful leader"" to all witches. Maybe Fiona leads the witch summit because she is the supreme."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ueyc5,AlyxFlux,2,Mon Feb 2 04:45:34 2015 UTC,"I took it to mean she is just the head of the Salem witches coven.  They never explain if magic is truly a genetic thing or more angel/demon based, only that it combines some aspects of innate internally driven magic (basically everything the 7 wonders involved) and externally driven magic (incantations, potions, rituals).  The voodoo witches were their own thing because their magic descended from west africa which has a different concept of magic traditionally involving pleas to certain god/demigod intermediates like   The only time I remember any kind of plea to a higher power (from the Salem crowd) was the money ritual used against the Delphi corporation which starts with a plea to Hecate, who is an ancient Greek goddess, and to me signified there was an element of Hermetic practice with the Salem crew  I felt like in general witches were dying out as the world is getting more reliant on science and technology and witches have had to be extra ""in the closet"" because the world is developing increasing scrutiny- YouTUbe, twitter, etc like Fiona says in the first ep  And I really liked this series because I've always had an interest in the occult, magical practice, and pagan religious practice.  I would consider myself a pagan/kind of a witch too.  I liked that they let the magic aspect unfold naturally, it was powerful but all the time kind of mysterious, like there wasn't a big montage of ""Ok here are all the possible magic powers ever"" which I thought would have been very reductive.  Even at the end of the season there is an idea that the witches still have unnamed magic in their bag of tricks which is cool, it helps make all magic seem like something more grand and powerful than just what's going on with a dozen witches in new orleans.  I liked the many plot twists, I liked Cordelia and how she went from wimp to HBIC back to wimp then supreme  I liked Marie Laveau and her strong black woman-ness even though sometimes it was very campy and Pam Grier-esque (Love me some Pam Grier)  I liked that they could make LaLurie totally terrible but at times sympathetic.  I liked how Madison was a terrible person but you got glimpses into her being very vulnerable and extremely insecure that made you understand how she ended up how she was.  I also loved everything about Myrtle Snow.  Fran Conroy stole the season.  I think she just eked past Jess Jange, who was just this fabulous boss bitch witch that was Machiavellian as hell (literally)"

Madison, Misty, and Fiona all died in the academy but we never encountered their ghosts, because witches and warlocks don't become ghosts. If Charles was a warlock, and if your claim that warlocks are the male equivalent to witches is true, then why did we see his ghost in the Murder House?"

AmericanHorrorStory,2ubpll,Fiend1138,1 point,Sat Jan 31 23:23:42 2015 UTC,"It's a good observation, but I'm pretty sure I heard that this was supposed to take place in present day. Nuclear testing and the threat of nuclear disaster hit it's peak in the 1950s, and since then we've been disarming nuclear bombs and decommissioning nuclear power plants pretty steadily. If it is supposed to take place in current day, I don't think people in 2015 would find the idea of nuclear testing that menacing considering the technology advances in science and chemistry that make testing out in the desert obsolete."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubpll,jeffshaught,3,Sat Jan 31 21:40:12 2015 UTC,"Yeeeeeah... We still have nukes today, and Iran and North Korea are constantly doing tests. I mean, the bombs didn't just disappear you know."

And the major events of the atomic age in America (like the nuclear testing in Nevada and the Cuban Missile Crisis) all took place in the 1950s and early 1960s, it doesn't seem plausible for a modern day Nuclear theme. North Korea and Iran are no Soviet Union. No one today is as scared of them as they were the USSR during the 1950s - 1980s. That being said, I would absolutely love for another time-period piece set around this idea though."

I'd love to see Nicholson go batshit insane. I hate to say it but I think its time that they mixed up the cast and gave Lange, Paulsen, and Peters at least 1 season off to shake it up a bit and force the writers to strengthen the story.

The show is more about Murphy pandering now, and they want more Paulsen and Peters. I don't think we'll ever have a season without them, but I'd love to see a full-on new cast.

AmericanHorrorStory,2u8cvq,JTtheLAR,4,Sat Jan 31 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"If, for one season, they could have AHS revolve around old-time radio and hosts/readers reading horror-suspense works, with the cast acting each story out in each episode, I'd be so happy.

AmericanHorrorStory,2ubwzn,Stunobo,11,Sat Jan 31 19:24:42 2015 UTC,"Moira's appearance isn't based solely on Male vs. Female, it's whether they see her as a sexual object. That's why in the finale, Ben sees old Moira as he's past his cheating, sex addict phase, and is faithful to Vivien. It's also why Chad sees her as old, since he is gay and has no sexual attraction to her. Hence if the black dahlia would have got with young Moira anyway, she would see young Moira as she is attracted to women. Just what I always thought."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubwzn,AlfieBoheme,1 point,Sat Jan 31 20:41:42 2015 UTC,Ahhh..... Thanks very much!
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubwzn,AlfieBoheme,2,Sat Jan 31 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"No problem, it's a common question on this reddit tbh!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubwzn,Lyco_499,1 point,Sat Jan 31 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly! It's not that men see her one way and women another, it's dependent on their sexual desire. Hence, women are more likely to see her like Vivian does and men like Ben does originally (because people are more likely to be heterosexual).   An alternate explication of course is that Moira has some control over how she appears (similar to SPOILER the very end which is very Beetlejuice in that the ghosts change themselves to scare that family away)."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubwzn,AlfieBoheme,2,Sat Jan 31 21:20:45 2015 UTC,"True, but I think if Moira had control she would have appeared young to Constance just to spite her for trying to hold onto her youth"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubwzn,Lyco_499,2,Sat Jan 31 22:09:05 2015 UTC,"I suppose but the two Moira's really were like two different people, or two representations of different facets of her personality.   On the one hand you have the naive, nymphomaniac trying to seduce Ben. And then on the other you have the motherly lady who was very protective of Vivian (while also trying to sleep with her husband but still, she seemed to see that as a service she was doing her, like to show her how weak men are).   (Understandably) Moira's problem was with men. She tried to seduce them or use them for gain. She was good to women unless she had a reason not to be (she hated Hayden because she was protective of Vivian, and Constance, well, you know).  And I just typed all that out and realized you specifically said Constance, so my apologies. Maybe she thought it pointless, as Constance would know it was an illusion and wouldn't care?   Either way, call it a plot hole (as people are wont to do with this season) or otherwise, but at the ending the ghosts are shown to be able to change their appearance at will. Unless, like Vivian and Ben violently attacking each other, they set it all up and someone carved up Elizabeth Short again etc. To be fair there seems to be a lot of inconsistencies between the different ghosts (Elizabeth Short looked fine because her injuries were post mortem maybe, but she later had her wounds. Moira's whole young/old thing with only a ghostly eye in her old form when surely she should have no eye at all. Tate's lack of bullet wounds when Nora had one. One of the nurses were drowned and always appeared wet yet one of the gay guys was drowned and didn't. The other gay guy was beaten to death but had no bruises/marks while Hayden had bruises from the shovel etc) but that's neither here nor there (and honestly doesn't both me at all, I love the season but it is true)."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubwzn,xotacoxo,5,Mon Feb 2 16:47:05 2015 UTC,"Btw, the woman who wants to be famous is Elizabeth Short, the famous IRL ""Black Dahlia."" Two explanations I thought of:   Anyone who is attracted to women sees Moira (the maid) as a young woman. So it's possible that the writers decided to make Elizabeth Short bisexual. However, the real Elizabeth Short was apparently homophobic. Elizabeth wanted Ben to treat and diagnose her. Moira needed Ben to finally give in to temptation. So, perhaps Moira told Elizabeth about the illusion (edit: or that Ben would be hella into an old lady making out with her), and Elizabeth decided to do it so they could both get what they want from Ben."

AmericanHorrorStory,2ubsb5,SimeonsDilemma,7,Sun Feb 1 01:55:31 2015 UTC,"If you are a fan of horror movies I definitely recommend AHS! Every person has differing opinions on each of the seasons, so as far as that's concerned it would really be something you'd just have to watch and see if you like it. I personally like each of the seasons, they each have a different feel to it. Season one has a seemingly typical haunted house type of setup, but it does a good job of setting itself apart from other haunted house flicks. Season two is a psychological thriller, lots of suspense and darkness to this season (and my personal favorite). Season three is a campy southern gothic style, basically the complete opposite of season two but still a fun watch IMO. Finally, season four had a very noir feeling, kind of slower in pace but everything comes to a head in the final episodes. I highly recommend all of them!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubsb5,statueofmike,5,Sat Jan 31 20:14:53 2015 UTC,"AHS is not very scary, but has more of a campy horror tone and atmosphere.  If you're looking for something to give you chills or nightmares, you probably won't find it in AHS.  If you're looking for more of a light and fun drama, or interesting characters and tragic stories, you'll probably like AHS."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubsb5,statueofmike,6,Sat Jan 31 18:56:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks mate. Iam not looking for anything really scay. Iam searching for a dark/mysterious atmosphere. But what you said sounds good, I think I'll check out the pilot later."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubsb5,jtyler27,4,Sat Jan 31 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"Try to stick through the pilot, it's a lot more jump scary and slasher-flick-like than anything else in the show.  Maybe even watch a season other than 1 first."

AmericanHorrorStory,2ubsb5,panandacub,4,Sat Jan 31 19:20:41 2015 UTC,"You'll find debates on that questions all over this subreddit. The one with the most support is probably season 1, but you'll only know if you watch them yourself.  The first two seasons are darker. They feel more like films. The second two are more expansive and mysterious."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ubsb5,bwood16,1 point,Sat Jan 31 19:23:46 2015 UTC,"From my experience, when people watch season 2 before season 1, they tend to not like season one as much. Season 1 is kind of confusing and takes about half of the season to establish the ""rules"" of the world that it takes place in. I definitely suggest watching from season 1 though. Watch the first five-six episodes and you should be hooked. :)"

AmericanHorrorStory,2uaf9w,abradolph,2,Sat Jan 31 08:17:41 2015 UTC,"ok really theorizing beyond the OPs post to Coven....  If Charles is a witch (which i love the idea because he put his kid back together much like Kyle was made as stated in another comment) then it is very possible it is in his family line and Madison is a decedent.    but my twist is, if Charles is a witch, and expanding on the ""permanent vitalum vitalis"",  Madison is brought back to life in Coven and after Spalding is killed, he can be seen as a ghost by the living residents of Robichaux's Academy.   Too far of a stretch??"
AmericanHorrorStory,2uaf9w,iamofortuna,2,Sat Jan 31 19:01:00 2015 UTC,I think it fits nicely with my idea actually.

AmericanHorrorStory,2u9vz6,Henry_Burris,7,Sat Jan 31 04:15:18 2015 UTC,"I'm going to respectfully disagree.  The cast is constantly evolving with the perfect blend of new faces and familiar faces.  I love seeing the ""regulars"" in new roles each season and every season has plenty of new actors to keep the show fresh.  It's true that many of the regulars have the same type of role in multiple stories, but the show's only had 4 seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u9vz6,regents,15,Sat Jan 31 07:31:27 2015 UTC,"I certainly think Murphy's Lange idolatry reached ridiculous proportions on Freak Show to the detriment of the story. I thought Elsa would have been a wonderful side character but wasn't suited as the leader of the freak show. It became all about her and her pursuit of fame which I found pretty boring (and implausible).      I find it interesting with Murphy and Falchuk that when they start out on their shows they are so inventive and creative. There are no limits to where they can go. They lost the three focuses of Murder House - Connie, Dylan and Taissa - but drafted Jessica, Sarah and Evan into the leads for S2 and it felt fresh. But after some success Murphy and Falchuk seem to become very fixed in their ways. Unfortunately money and success often kill risk taking creativity.      Personally I don't see much changing with the show from here in no matter how much they change things. The show has found a level. Unless you have show runners who will push with superhuman effort to get great writing and storylines it doesn't matter who the actors or staff writers are."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u9vz6,girlsjiggle,4,Sat Jan 31 05:09:34 2015 UTC,"That's very unfortunate, and a better insight into the show than I thought of. I probably have 2 more seasons in me, but if the same characters have the same personalities, and the ones who always live, live, I hope the fanbase will put Murphy on blast.  Also, do you think there's gonna be continued singing bits? I know they cut some out of freak show, but I'm worried they'll find a way to keep having a few each season"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u9vz6,girlsjiggle,6,Sat Jan 31 05:23:08 2015 UTC,"I don't really dig that Baz Lurhman style out of context music but I do admire the ambition of them trying something like that. I think when you feel unsatisfied by the show people tend to really latch on to things like that as if they are a cause rather than a symptom.      The much more fundamental issue is shown in the pattern of Murphy's shows of two great seasons and then the depth originality and magic just seem to go. Whether he and Falchuk need a rich reservoir of ideas to draw from that runs out or whether some of the passion drops I'm not sure. But what jumps out to me is that so much of S3 & 4 came across to me as first draft writing. If you want to create art you have to be your own worst critic, constantly tearing down what you just built, to build something better, more urgent, more authentic, more essential. I just think after a couple of seasons, Murphy and Falchuk no longer have the stomach for that kind of back breaking digging into the depths that is required to break strong, coherent story lines with mystery and thematic depth. They want to get home at a normal hour and enjoy their families. Fair enough too. I think its best to just to enjoy the show for what it is now. I've got a couple of masterpieces seasons that I can enjoy the rest of my life. That's better than most shows will ever have."

AmericanHorrorStory,2u9vz6,Canines_and_Cards,2,Sat Jan 31 23:29:30 2015 UTC,"I think you began to touch on an important point that can explain the seemingly stark contrast between the first two and previous two seasons. I believe this may account for that: the first season Murphy and his team introduce a true horror genre tv show. They write the show and characters to win over the die hard horror fans. They want to capture this demographic first and foremost. Obviously making attempts to get broader audience appeal, but it makes sense that they wanted to secure a solid base of true horror fans. Second season is similar, insofar as they realized they captured a solid audience number of fans who want a truly scary show. Then comes the audience feedback that asylum was too dark. Couple that feedback with FX's pressure on Murphy to boost viewership, and you get the black comedy Coven.  Without a doubt less ""scary/horrofic"" than the first two. They were successful in gaining a wider audience, and so continued in season four to solidify the newly captured moderate demographic that joined ahs in season 3.   So, will we see seasons akin to the first two again in terms of the darker tone and setting? I really hope so. Hopefully the next season or two Murphy will convince the network he's solidified his wider audience and will let him go back to a darker scarier tone."

The show does tend to cater more towards women as well, and it would just be better business to not have a main protagonist be male."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u9un4,Henry_Burris,8,Sat Jan 31 04:19:26 2015 UTC,"This makes a lot of sense. Now that you mention the women empowerment concept, I remember that scene between Fiona and Hank when she asks him why she got a female dog.

It allows you to draw your own connections, theorize, and have more fun with your viewing experience.  I also like that each season is its own story.  I don't want big, glaring connections but subtle things that make you go ""Oh, crap, that's COOL!""  I guess my brain just works in the more ""subtle theory"" way.  I'll admit, though.  The Hans Gruper connection had me borderline rolling my eyes... but that's probably because it wasn't really all that surprising and partially felt shoe-horned into that episode.  Also, I will gladly accept hypothetical/imaginary gold.  It's the thought that counts, right?  ;)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u7obg,samanthahazard,2,Fri Jan 30 18:52:05 2015 UTC,"I was indifferent to the Hans Gruper nod in Freak Show, but I felt like it would have been better had they left the name ambiguous. He was played by the same Actor from Asylum, so they could have just said he was a Nazi and people would have been able to put the pieces together themselves."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u7obg,Lecter07,1 point,Fri Jan 30 19:11:21 2015 UTC,Actors change roles every season. And some people (my mom) didn't recognize the actor from Asylum. If they didn't say who he was I'm sure many people wouldn't have gotten it.

AmericanHorrorStory,2u7obg,AlfieBoheme,3,Sat Jan 31 09:45:49 2015 UTC,"""Leaving your body"" is a thing that a lot of conjoined twins are able to do.  I remember seeing a pair of conjoined twins on tv and one of them was a country singer named Reba.  She would be in the bathroom singing and the other one would just look like she was in a trance.  While your line of thinking is interesting, I do think you're reading too much into it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u7obg,cosmicpizza666,0,Fri Jan 30 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"Technically, anyone can leave their body with enough meditation and practice.  There's the whole concept of ""astral projection""; many accounts of people claiming this happens after they've ""died""/had a near death experience; etc.  Hell, meditation is technically a form of leaving your body too.  So it's not just a conjoined twin thing and perhaps it's not connected to anything.  I'm sure that I'm reading too much into it - I tend to overthink and overanalyze many things - but they're just small things that I picked up on that could lead to a bigger picture.  If they don't, I won't be disappointed.  I just figured it was something interesting to point out.  :)"

AmericanHorrorStory,2u7obg,TallDarkAndOkay,1 point,Sun Feb 1 05:07:26 2015 UTC,"I like this, maybe all of the seasons have a link to the girls in Coven and that's how they're all linked? If this is true, and it seems to work, we could say that Freak Show links to Nan (or maybe Zoe, but we see her parents so it seems less likely). Also, Murder House links to Madison as Charles Montgomery performed Necromancy, one of the sevon wonders.   Someone would still have to find the link in Asylum, but I like the idea that all the seasons are linked by the Coven than all the other bs flying around. Off the top of my head I can't find anyone in Asylum that have witch-like powers besides maybe Kit's children with the aliens and semi-healing Jude. I don't know"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u919i,girlsjiggle,3,Fri Jan 30 23:23:17 2015 UTC,"I can't stay on one side of the fence! At first, I just couldn't get behind all the government conspiracy and top hat theories. Then a few different redditors came out with some pretty convincing reasons as to why the theories are correct, and I even found a possible link on my own. Now, your post really puts it all together and I'm starting to doubt the theory again. Your cases against bullets are actually pretty striking. Mutants and aliens were already touched on in season 2. Will they really rehash those themes? Are all the hills have eyes references actually hints, or are they actually an homage? And another case against for me is the ease in finding all the alien and government references; did the creators really put all this stuff in freak show to give us an idea to season 5 or are they trying to throw us off by basically handing us the ""clues""?  Edit: by the way, the way you wrote it out sounds awesome for a season's theme, even if I may be questioning the validity of the theory."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u919i,IamLegba,2,Fri Jan 30 23:43:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is definitely a lot of next-season cat and mouse going on with Murphy now for sure. Even Mossimo's comments about nuclear testing seemed too obvious. I think he was definitely in that freaks/mutant head space before deciding on S4. Whether he would go back to mutants I don't know. I still see it as the strongest contender if you mix in the x-files like alien plot. They would need to shoot a fair bit of stuff on location in the desert you would think which would give it a different, open feel to the rather claustrophobic, heavily designed sets of the first four seasons."

I've been rewatching the first half of Asylum, and I hate to say it because it goes against my own theory, but I don't think they're going to do mutants or aliens next season. Season five would be just way too similar to Asylum. If they do, I think it will be for a brief story arc, like Sister Mary Eunice & Hans Gruper were for Freak Show, just something to tie the seasons together. I wish they would do the mutant/aliens thing... to me, those were some of the scariest elements of season two.  Absolutely awesome sample plot, by the way! Got me all excited for season five!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u919i,ace_VXIII,2,Sat Jan 31 02:01:13 2015 UTC,"Possibly but they've reused ghosts/spirits, serial killers, evil doctors playing god with human bodies etc. 'Free range' roaming mutants ala hills have eyes and Wrong Turn are kind of their own subspecies. And the aliens in Asylum were used very enigmatically and symbolically that a lot of people didn't get (as displayed by all the ""what was with the aliens"" comments). The biggest problem is if we're a bit sick of deformity horror after freakshow.   p.s. I see a pug dog with a top hat in the reddit ad block on this page now. Coincidence?"

So much potential is being trashed. The ONLY thing I can even grasp at that is happening here is they are trying really very hard to make it more authentic. In real life everything is a lot more boring and pointless and a let down.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u75hc,ahandfulofbirds,3,Fri Jan 30 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think a single storyline this season had a satisfying ending. Like, literally not one single storyline. This was similar to Season 3's storylines--probably why both seasons are so polarizing to people. Seasons 3 and 4 had just about as many storylines as seasons 1 and 2 (maybe a FEW more) but 1 and 2 tied their stories together with satisfying ends for the most part."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u75hc,OvernightSiren,1 point,Fri Jan 30 17:55:32 2015 UTC,"See I disagree. Season 1 didn't tie anything up in a neat or satisfying way. Everybody just died and then there was ghost Christmas. Antichrist subplot was entirely inconsequential. The entire romance between Tate and Violet was tossed because of it. The only thing that felt satisfying to me was Larry's ending. Season 2, 3 and 4 didnt open as many things up, and felt like things closed off a lot tighter. They had a central question, they had overarching themes, and all of those things pulled together to give pretty satisfactory endings.  Asylum played with the ideas of what makes up reality, and did an amazing job of showing the difference between a struggle with illness and a disconnect from reality. We saw Jude's transformation, we saw the darkness that crept into Lana, and we saw how Kit learned to trust himself again. Coven took on the dichotomies of race, sex, and threw them into a massive play for power, drawing on black comedy and a very subtle horror of selfishness to contrast Asylum. By the end, we had some resolution to the fighting between voodoo and witchcraft, we had the emotional journey of Queenie learning to own her identity as a black witch, we had Zoe coming into her own and taking control of things. We saw Cordelia gain her confidence and rise to her potential. Freak Show has so much going for it. The overarching themes of acceptance and freedom were really nicely tied in with the characters. Dandy and Stanley came to wonderfully morbid and fitting ends. Bette and Dot grew closer and understood each other, Jimmy and Desiree came to accept themselves as they were, even taking pride in things they previously considered their flaws. I also thought there were plenty of horrifying moments. Murder House has some themes, but they're not as visible. Family is a theme, but they don't really play with it enough. There should have been more contrast with the Harmons and Langdons. The emotional aspects of family were very hamfisted, with Ben and Violet both going from 0-100 in no time, and then suddenly everybody reconciles in the last episode. I also think that the story romanticises Tate too much. There's a lot going on in Murder House, but it's all external. It doesn't affect the characters enough. There's not enough change. I feel like there was very little change in the characters from the start and the characters by the end. It ended with a bit of ""what's the point"" feeling. None of the other seasons had that for me."

They just kept adding more and more ghosts and it felt cluttered to me. None of that went anywhere. Freak Show, even if it did introduce the same amount or more plots, didn't leave anything undone. All the named characters had some backstory or plot going on, and tied into things. If Freak Show was like Murder House, we'd have gotten a new freak every episode before the opening."

She could have been the balance point for the viewer between the comfortable but stifling conformity of the small town and the alluring, exotic weirdness of the freak show. You could have had a great beauty and beast story line going on too. My idea before this season was to have the protagonist as the town sheriff in a similarly conflicted role investigating murders that cropped up when the freak show rolled into town but was also smitten with Bette and/or Dot.      IMO they didn't really take advantage of playing up the conflict between the small town values and the wild, sexual, uninhibited nature of the freak acts. I would have loved to get more of that sense of the town inhabitants being both terrified of but also fascinated with the weirdness and novelty of the show, drawn to it like moths to a flame despite themselves. Maybe the show almost has an almost supernatural power that changes the small town audiences subtly - they become wilder, more sexual, more open - bringing their inner freak out.  Maybe the audiences find strange little deformities on their bodies or get tattoos and crazy haircuts. Other people in the town think they are possessed or becoming commies. Lots of things they could have done."

AmericanHorrorStory,2u635p,girlsjiggle,9,Fri Jan 30 13:39:15 2015 UTC,"How good would an anti parallel transformation of Desiree Dupree have been? She starts out as a strong, confident freak, finds out it's correctable, and is transformed to a ""normal woman"". In the process, she loses the one thing upon which her resilience is built and turns into a demure, submissive housewife under a controlling man. A transformed Desiree killing Petite to please her man would have been devastating."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u635p,mistar_z,5,Fri Jan 30 12:33:28 2015 UTC,"I really like that idea about Desiree debating a comfortable, buttoned down suburban life versus the wild, poverty stricken life of the carnival. There could be an almost cult kind of thing with the suburban house wives where Desiree is inducted in by being told its her duty to be compliant and do everything to please her husband. They could even have hinted at the house wives being robots ala Stepford Wives or maybe they seem to have been partly lobotomized - staring mindlessly at t.v soapies and with a glazed smile telling Desiree ""Become one of us and all your problems will be over""."

I definitely would have loved to see this happen, because this whole season felt like a jumble of mess until it finally ended. Usually the finale's for AHS tie up all loose ends and give you a sense of closure, which this season did, but it wasn't as satisfying as usual"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,n_alvarez2007,22,Thu Jan 29 17:44:37 2015 UTC,that's creepy!!!!
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,MedusaSeducia,19,Thu Jan 29 18:03:01 2015 UTC,Interesting. I want to say S4 has at least a couple overhead shots like that.  Be cool to see stills of them now.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,HedgeKnight84,11,Thu Jan 29 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"With all the people trying to guess Season 5 from Season 4 clues, I've wondered if there were clues in the previous seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,DanElHombre,21,Thu Jan 29 18:42:43 2015 UTC,"I have this theory that Murphy just says 'there's a clue in this episode' and then scours the net to see what the most popular theory is and goes for it.  People were talking about Witches, Louisiana, and Voodoo during season 1. People were spouting Asylum halfway through season 1 as well. They've been talking about Freak Shows and scary clowns since season 2 premiered.  I don't know if there really are clues, I think he just does stuff and then sees what happens."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,clwestbr,3,Fri Jan 30 00:18:22 2015 UTC,Tons. There have also been threads on this sub discussing them all. Kind of interesting to think about
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,littleotterpop,2,Thu Jan 29 23:23:03 2015 UTC,"Asylum had a lot of references to magic once Sister Jude became a patient at the asylum, people were able to guess asylum, coven and freakshow before Ryan confirmed them"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,IRob92,5,Fri Jan 30 03:42:44 2015 UTC,This means we need to look for large overhead shadows in season 4!
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,arkansatan,16,Thu Jan 29 23:45:21 2015 UTC,I dont get it :/
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,popcorn8123,50,Thu Jan 29 18:21:59 2015 UTC,I think either the shadow is the Minotaur from season 3 or either devil Horns after sister Jude said about looking into the face of evil
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,Trisluxxx,33,Thu Jan 29 18:25:26 2015 UTC,This is definitely a clue to season 3! I remember Season 3 had a similar visual clue in regards to season 4 (overhead shot depicting the face of a clown)

AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,daryldickin,4,Fri Jan 30 07:19:55 2015 UTC,I'm rewatching it but I have a horrible eye for these type of things.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,Re-toast,1 point,Fri Jan 30 08:19:21 2015 UTC,Just any type of aerial shot would suffice I think. I remember some going over the tents..maybe the tent layout is something?
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,MattehPee,10,Sat Jan 31 03:01:13 2015 UTC,That's a Jude reference. It isn't even from the episode he said a clue would be in.  I fully believe that he just says 'there's a clue in this episode' and then waits to see what his fans see. He then selects the most popular theory and goes with it.   Digging deep for stuff on this one...
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,clwestbr,6,Thu Jan 29 23:41:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed, there's no way Ryan Murphey is that smart. Not after watching Seasons 3 and 4."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,Gogohax,9,Thu Jan 29 23:57:39 2015 UTC,"I'd have argued that after season 2. The performances were great, the way the sets were put together and what they for visuals with a television series budget was great, but the plot was an absolute clusterfuck. And not in a 'it feels crazy, like in an asylum!' way but in a 'sweet mother of god what is the point of this nonsense' type of way."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,clwestbr,5,Thu Jan 29 23:59:11 2015 UTC,"Ryan Murphy is intelligent BUT sometimes he gets enamoured with his stars (Lea Michelle and Jessica Lange) and tries to please fans waaaaay to much (Darren Criss and Evan Peters), which is why his shows are better before they become extremely popular (Glee Season 1, Murder House and to an extent Asylum)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,IRob92,3,Fri Jan 30 03:45:33 2015 UTC,"Ironic, he tries so hard to please his fans that he loses them."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,Gogohax,2,Fri Jan 30 03:47:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, he tries to please the wrong kind of fans, while ignoring the fans who actually like great stories"

AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,glassonion34,6,Thu Jan 29 19:03:20 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, the Minotaur. I thought you meant this."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,Darby300,5,Thu Jan 29 21:58:39 2015 UTC,That's what I thought too!
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,bentwhiskers,3,Fri Jan 30 04:59:19 2015 UTC,"I thought it was just referring to Sister Jude's final statement, plus the whole Sister Mary Eunice ordeal"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,lekkerekkel,2,Fri Jan 30 00:00:49 2015 UTC,I'm sure it serves dual purposes. There's no denying a connection between this and Sister Jude's final words in the season. But it's also hard to not connect this to the Minotaur in Season 3.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,clwestbr,1 point,Fri Jan 30 00:03:03 2015 UTC,It was more of that than a connection to season 3.  This fandom sometimes...

AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,TheQonCue,13,Fri Jan 30 03:22:54 2015 UTC,season 5 is my favorite season!!!
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,DA-numberfour,2,Fri Jan 30 03:41:28 2015 UTC,It's totally the best season.  I don't understand why Murder House gets so much love when season 5 was clearly the be all and end all of American Horror Story.  They should have just ended it there.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,HandbagofRainbows,2,Fri Jan 30 18:16:29 2015 UTC,Season 6 gets too much hate on this board... I thought the Gay Bar setting was executed really well.

AmericanHorrorStory,2u3nzt,NorthernRealmJackal,1 point,Fri Jan 30 15:25:09 2015 UTC,"This is AWESOME!  I'm not sure if they knew about the Minotaur yet when they did this - but if they did, good for them.  This was really clever and I never even noticed it.  I'll be paying a lot more attention to the aerial shots from now on, even if this wasn't a clue.  The cinematography on this show is like none other, I swear.    Really, I think this shot is more symbolic.  The asylum was a place that contained a lot of great evil - so I see it as more of a devil or demon head at the entrance to the evil place.  Furthermore, if you were standing on the upper floors and looking out the window, you'd be ""staring in the face of evil,"" and the face of evil would be ""staring back at you.""  Seems like a symbolic thing that ties into the season as a whole.  And, I just have to say, that last part of Asylum when Jude delivers that line... I get chills.  Every. Time."

AmericanHorrorStory,2uaddz,Capt-Murphy,5,Sat Jan 31 07:46:50 2015 UTC,"Asylum was a masterpiece. The writers set the bar so high for themselves with that one. I loved Coven, although I did see how the fans became discouraged. The season did take a scattered, hurry up and throw everything together air to it. Still, they pulled it all together and drove it home perfectly.  I'd like to think it's all the other projects. Let's face it, Glee had it's final season right around the same time Freak Show was moving along. I just figured more energy was given to Glee as it was their end. Now I see they are coming out with two new shows. Scream Queen and American Crime Story. You know what they say. You spread yourself out too thin, something has got to give. I fear that something is AHS.  I am not even interested in American Crime Story. Especially since the first season is going to be about the O.J. Simpson murders. I think we all heard enough of that story already. Movies already made from every angle of it...etc."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uaddz,Supreme000,2,Sat Jan 31 13:44:55 2015 UTC,"I think masterpiece is an overstatement. It was by far the best season IMO. But I wasn't remotely interested in the alien plot and after the season finished the popular opinion was that Asylum was a mess and couldn't compete compared to Murder House. Each season appeals to different types of horror, too. Coven was more comedy, which is what Scream Queens will likely be. I'm probably going to watch American Crime Story because Sarah Paulson is in it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uaddz,lurkingphoenix,1 point,Sat Jan 31 16:51:56 2015 UTC,Uhhh glee is still going. Their last season is on tv now.
AmericanHorrorStory,2uaddz,jtyler27,3,Sat Jan 31 17:10:33 2015 UTC,Uhhh yeah and last July (which is when they film AHS) it was announced that Glee would end because of rating woes. So I was saying maybe Ryan threw more of himself in the last Glee season to try and save it this last season. Which may have taken away from AHS.
AmericanHorrorStory,2uaddz,Supreme000,1 point,Sat Jan 31 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"Meh, while I wasn't the biggest fan of Coven and Freak House, they both have their moments.  I'll continue watching because there is no show like it as long as people like Frances Conroy, Sarah Paulson, Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates, etc are on board. Sucks losing Jessica though :( Hopefully Finn & Michael Chiklis come back.  I hope it does get better but of course it's all subjective."
AmericanHorrorStory,2uaddz,Rytlock,1 point,Sat Jan 31 10:25:53 2015 UTC,"A lot of this is obviously in the eye of the beholder but for those of us who loved S1 & 2 and 3 & 4 not so much, I think its best to let it gooooooo, let it goooooooo. The pattern of Murphy & Falchuks shows is two great seasons and then they seem to lose that ruthless and driven passion required by show runners to make great television art. They only way I could see it getting some of the depth, mystery and inventiveness back is if they gave it a hiatus for a year to let their ideas fully germinate. But while its rating well I don't see that happening. I think their heart will be in their new shows. But hey - you got two masterpiece seasons right? Always look on the bright side of life. Let it goooooo...."

Why build it out there? and for what purpose? The resort was abandoned but purchased and re-built by a multi millionaire tycoon in the 1970's where it takes place. The rich, the famous and even the corrupt all go here to get away or make money. The natives are restless and want they're home back but are in servitude to the island owner and they work with they're old gods to exact revenge on those who ruined there garden of eden.   While that is all in the background other entities have come to run amok, drug dealers and organ harvesters. Mad scientists experimenting with animals and even creatures from the deep who once ruled our world.   Its an idea but I think the owner of the Island should be none other than.

So many stories to be told; Misty Day's return from hell (maybe as a villain driven mad by her torment), the other family's of witch hunters would be riled up from the academy going public, and a whole school full of young witches leaning their powers and getting to know their new lives.  I would love to see this."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5eri,007pizzaman,3,Fri Jan 30 13:02:29 2015 UTC,"I really wanted them to finish Coven, because I feel like a lot of the story's were either cut short or never resolved properly and it felt like they were planning for a sequel season.  I'd like Queenie to be a teacher in the academy and teach Voodoo. Because it seems the tribe has died out after Coven and she would understand the importance of it's survival among the witches magic.   I really hope that Zoe and Kyle just left. I hated their dynamic in Coven, and I thought she was one of the weakest characters.  Cordelia would be like the ""Dumbledore"" of the Coven. Claiming ultimate Supremacy.  I think the story needs to be a little more focused than Coven, though. It needs a magical central antagonist. An Evil Warlock or maybe someone wielding a new kind of magic that we weren't introduced to in Coven."

I think the creepiest parts were probably surrounding Spalding and Delphine - the straight up torture and creepy dolls put me on edge.  But it didn't have any jumpy scenes, or really heart pounding moments.  In that I agree it was missing.  I just have trouble comparing the seasons to eachother because they're all so different.  I thought the acting was done really well and I liked the new plot, so I think that is why I really enjoyed it!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5eri,stanleythemanley44,1 point,Sat Jan 31 06:58:13 2015 UTC,I personally thought this season was awful. It seemed more like a show that should be on AMC family or something. Maybe it's just that i was more light-hearted and less horrific. But I also feel like the storyline and acting has gone downhill as well.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5eri,laurenannebuckley,3,Sat Jan 31 06:00:43 2015 UTC,"It was for sure more light-hearted, and it did not have a lot of the utterly terrifying moments the first two seasons did.  I think I just really liked the plot, it was a good twist on an old story."

I don't think its anything like this though, I think its because the show, while entertaining, wasn't that great technically. The plot was a bit all over the place and the character writing was not terribly consistent. I liked it, but I wouldn't give Ryan Murphy an award for the show. No-one stood out as giving an incredible performance to me apart from Finn."

AmericanHorrorStory,2u5zp2,-DD,1 point,Fri Jan 30 22:10:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. I enjoyed this season but you have to remember,  this show has a very niche audience. The winners are much more popular overall than AHS and its cast. Not to mention that FX isn't one of the most popular cable networks, not by a long shot. And you're right about the performances- I enjoyed the hell out of the show but no one was given a really strong character or performance. I would think OPs idea would actually be backwards- if they could have gotten the cast from this season there, they would have lived it, if just for the attention it would have gotten them."

AmericanHorrorStory,2u5zp2,bwood16,4,Fri Jan 30 14:15:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think it had anything to do with the actors being shunned by anyone. Horror is already a difficult genre to get recognized. The acting, set and costume design were amazing this year, but that's about it. The writing was decent, but it didn't compare to most of the other nominees or past AHS seasons. Another thing is that Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates were nominated. I've seen interviews with both of them, where they say that they are not really concerned with the awards. I recall Lange specifically saying that going to award shows is not her thing; she doesn't care about the fashion and she doesn't care about the speeches. She even went on to joke about the actors that get up on stage and thank God, and their kids, and whoever. If she doesn't care about the award, or showing up to the show, why would any of the other actors?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5zp2,SpitefulPuck,2,Fri Jan 30 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"to answer your question, I think people are only at the major award ceremonies if they are up for an award. For example, Jessica Lange was up for an Emmy last year and so was Kathy Bates. Jessica may have invited co-star Danny Huston as her guest/date. Murphy and Falchuck were there because AHS Coven was up for outstanding miniseries. If the show was up for outstanding cast/ensemble then all of the supporting cast would be there to accept the award if they won"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5zp2,bwood16,0,Fri Jan 30 21:13:21 2015 UTC,This season doesn't deserve any nominations or rewards. It was fun to watch and probably the creepiest/bloodiest but like the ending felt rushed and not well written imo sorry
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5zp2,bucknasty219,3,Fri Jan 30 08:49:15 2015 UTC,"Critics loved it, just like they loved Coven. Thats really at that matters  during award season. It will likely be nominated for many Emmys this year just like it has been for the last 3 seasons. Jessica Lange will be nominated regardless."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5zp2,bwood16,-5,Fri Jan 30 21:08:16 2015 UTC,"This show isn't good enough to be winning awards, I think any nominations are quite generous."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5zp2,NorthernRealmJackal,2,Fri Jan 30 16:55:45 2015 UTC,"AHS has won 8 Emmys, which is way more than the vast majority of shows on TV. It has received 17 Emmy nominations for each of its past 3 seasons for acting, directing, sound effects, special effects, makeup, hairstyling, costumes, etc. So clearly the show is ""good enough"" to win awards.."

AmericanHorrorStory,2u5ubd,breakyourwings,2,Fri Jan 30 13:43:06 2015 UTC,It was designed for her so you won't find a real one if that's what you're after. What I can say is it's designed to be an old carpet bag so you would have better luck finding an old carpet bag that looks closest to t and maybe paying someone to do the needle work of the devil yourself? Just my thoughts.

AmericanHorrorStory,2u5ubd,-DD,2,Fri Jan 30 14:02:32 2015 UTC,"the bag was commissioned for the show. it was made by my friends, Bobbie and Jen at Quarter Stitch, 629 Chartres St, New Orleans, LA 70130, 504.522.4451 i think they were given 48 hours to complete it so it was worked on around the clock, in shifts."

I thought about it myself. It's a thicker material,  looks maybe like canvas? (which would be great because it's white and canvas is easy to waterproof/stainproof) and the design is cross stitch."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,jtyler27,18,Thu Jan 29 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in watching something similar now, Black Mirror on Netflix instant is phenomenal. There's just not enough of it, unfortunately."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,Spokemaster_Flex,3,Thu Jan 29 22:48:39 2015 UTC,I have tried it and liked it but I have not watched all of it. Not enough horror to keep me interested
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,Spokemaster_Flex,3,Thu Jan 29 23:24:01 2015 UTC,The last episode of season 2 would suit you nicely.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,Spokemaster_Flex,3,Fri Jan 30 00:19:17 2015 UTC,I just finished rewatching season 2. I really like the setup of the final episode
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,amantelascio,2,Fri Jan 30 00:20:38 2015 UTC,When it was ending and it was all revealed I was so upset. She didn't even know she'd done anything wrong anymore noooooo.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,keejee,2,Fri Jan 30 00:27:23 2015 UTC,"White Bear?  That was my favorite episode, I think.  Definitely the one I felt most surprised by the ending of."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,CaptionClosed,2,Sat Jan 31 23:11:02 2015 UTC,It's not meant to be horror.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,Spokemaster_Flex,2,Fri Jan 30 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"I know, that's why I'm not very interested"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,treyokay,3,Fri Jan 30 04:04:53 2015 UTC,"That's an anthology series like Tales from the Crypt, Twilight Zone, etc?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,CaptionClosed,1 point,Fri Jan 30 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"Each episode is a completely different story, in that sort of sense. They're all based in the ""near future"" and focus on potentially dangerous places that modern technology can take us. As another user said, they do sort of bang you over the head with ""technology can be dangerous,"" but I always thought of the ""black mirror"" of the title as a turned-off computer screen and so thought ""well what did you expect."" Maybe I'm stretching with the title, I don't know. But it is very good! I would just recommend not bingeing too hard, first because there aren't that many episodes, and second, watching several episodes in a day can mess with your head a little (or at least it did for me)."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,treyokay,1 point,Fri Jan 30 15:27:40 2015 UTC,It's fucking amazing.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,CaptionClosed,2,Sat Jan 31 00:21:26 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really answer the question lol. If it's like the shows I mentioned I can watch an episode, but if it's a full series I don't have the time for that atm."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,treyokay,2,Sat Jan 31 21:00:57 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I figured someone had already responded. I was just adding my emphatic support for ""Black Mirror"".  You can absolutely watch a single episode at a time. They are not connected.  It really is wonderful though."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,CaptionClosed,1 point,Sun Feb 1 02:15:48 2015 UTC,So it's procedural?
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,treyokay,1 point,Tue Feb 3 19:37:00 2015 UTC,"No... I should have just answered your actual question and said it's like The Twilight Zone.  Sorry for being so unclear. The episodes are completely unrelated to each other.  Unless of course there's some deep mythology to the show... Which would be an interesting thing to consider.  I haven't seen a lot of The Twilight Zone, but something I noticed from what I have seen is that the episodes seem to focus on the person in the story rather rather than the conceit of the episode.  Black Mirror is like that.   For instance, there's an episode where the conceit is that there is a technology that allows anyone (who can afford it, presumably) to record their memories and be able to re-watch them. But really the episode is about how precious a gift the ability to forget is and what the burden of remembering everything flawlessly would do two people in a relationship.  That episode is my favorite. It has a quality of magical realism. Everything about that world is basically the same as ours... except for that one thing. The writers don't feel the need to pile on flashy gadgets or CGI gimmicks and turn it into a commercial for all the shit we'll all want to buy in the future.  Sorry for the ramble. Stoned and tired."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,KatzVlad,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:25:52 2015 UTC,"I think I understand now. The thing that threw me off was the picture on Netflix showed a guy and a girl so I assumed it followed two main characters.   I'm not familiar with the term conceit when used in this context. So when you say the conceit of the episode, I'm not entirely sure what you mean.   For it to be like Tales of Crypt, Twilight, Tales from Darkside, it would have to have new characters each episode, otherwise it sounds to be more in the vein of X-Files or Doctor Who.   You didn't really go off topic except for the end and only for a second, but even that gave a more detailed description of the show, so I wouldn't even call it rambling. Just passion for the show for the show if anything.   If it's different characters each episode then I'm going to watch it today."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,CaptionClosed,1 point,Fri Feb 6 18:18:57 2015 UTC,"It means something along the lines of ""premise"" in this context, but they're not exactly synonyms.  Yes, new characters each episode.  I promise you won't be disappointed."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,BasketeerOverHere,1 point,Fri Feb 6 23:29:20 2015 UTC,"I watched black mirror. I liked it but it was a bit heavy handed in the ""we are too attached to electronics"". I felt a bit spoonfed."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,BasketeerOverHere,3,Fri Jan 30 14:47:48 2015 UTC,I think that would probably end up being a lot better than the actual show since it seems they only have enough brains/story to write 4-6 eps before completely fizzling out.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,mythosopher,2,Fri Jan 30 14:57:48 2015 UTC,"I think this is an awesome idea, but it doesn't really fit the structure of AHS. Maybe they should have some of the creators of AHS set up a new show, and it would be your idea, and then also have the original AHS still going."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,b1tchcraft,1 point,Thu Jan 29 23:54:15 2015 UTC,But this show doesn't really have a structure. Every season can be completely different from the previous one.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u48ha,BocoCHutternut,2,Thu Jan 29 23:57:20 2015 UTC,"In plot, yes. But the common structure is that each season contains one main story. Like I said, I would love to watch a ""story of the week"" anthology like you said, but it would feel weird coming from AHS."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,OjamaKnight,15,Fri Jan 30 06:39:42 2015 UTC,Coven. The ending felt like the first season finale of a show.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,mrignatiusjreily,5,Fri Jan 30 07:01:35 2015 UTC,Yeah :(. can you imagine the epicness of another season focusing on a witch vs the corporate witch hunters?  The plot with the witch hunters didn't really end as killing the men they killed would simply have their positions filled in by the next in order. ÷_÷
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,mistar_z,2,Sat Jan 31 12:21:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Thanks to Cordelia, witch hunters are now exposed so it would be interesting to see how the world would react to real witches and witch hunters."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,mrignatiusjreily,1 point,Sun Feb 1 19:56:44 2015 UTC,So much potential for a sequel.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,mistar_z,3,Sun Feb 1 22:49:45 2015 UTC,"Definitely would like this to be a thing. Maybe they can branch out and do a novel? American Horror Story Seminary. Witch school. Somebody is messing up in Queenie's class so she slaps her own hand with a ruler. Cordelia dealing with the pressure of the whole world knowing about witches, and what that brings on them. Independent hunters trying to get in and bring them down. Of course, it would take a bit of work to get all the themes working nicely without retreading things too much."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,ahandfulofbirds,7,Mon Feb 2 15:30:39 2015 UTC,Yeah Coven would probably be the best. I'd like to see Murder House though I'm not really sure how it'd be done.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,kenbrellfan,10,Fri Jan 30 08:13:48 2015 UTC,I didn't want Coven to end. It was my favorite season.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,MissKaciChaotix,3,Fri Jan 30 12:30:47 2015 UTC,"With Murder House, they could follow a new family that moves in, and the Harmons trying to protect them. Maybe this time the family would actually be able to free the spirits somehow."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,cocobeannns,5,Fri Jan 30 16:48:35 2015 UTC,"Coven. It was the most open-ended finale. A lot of potential for character development with the addition of the all the witches. Not to mention more storylines for Cordelia, Zoe, and Queenie."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,Oddbaugh,4,Fri Jan 30 14:56:32 2015 UTC,Murder house. Definitely.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,taintlangdon,4,Fri Jan 30 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"Murder House. I want to see the full dysfunction of the Langdon family, the fourth child, and everything that led up to Tate and the school shooting.  edit: fourth child. HOW COULD I?!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u69v5,LeynaF,3,Fri Jan 30 23:58:45 2015 UTC,Coven and Murder House.

Dot had feelings for Jimmy since day one because he was the only one who was kind to the girls. Dot is the more serious one and the ""main"" head while Bette is the dreamer who's head slants a bit. In the last episode, he was definitely sitting on Dot's side while Bette read a magazine."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5uqz,alextr0n,2,Fri Jan 30 06:17:36 2015 UTC,"OK let me try again. If you are standing in front of them looking at them. The one on the left is who liked Jimmy. Yes, the serious one who hated everything until she saw Jimmy. The one on the left. The mistake I mention is because when they had the little moment I spoke of, right after he was beginning to like Maggie. It was the head on the right they used in that scene. Wrong one."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5uqz,alextr0n,2,Fri Jan 30 13:02:43 2015 UTC,"Ohhh okay it's because in your post you said Bette liked Jimmy, that's why I got confused"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5f2d,Phonochirp,10,Fri Jan 30 01:48:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I would consider AHS a drama of sorts with dark features. Most of the seasons are just dark, no pop outs or extremely terrible stuff. Season 2 had some horror to it, so I'd look out for that."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5f2d,maxabat,6,Fri Jan 30 02:09:49 2015 UTC,"I think most that watch the show have a higher tolerance for horror. AHS has some bloody moments and some jump moments but I think the ones that resonate and fuck with me the most are the moments that leave you feeling violated. Incest, rape and fucking to death and the dead kinda get to me. It isn't an element seen as often in the horror movies I watch either. (Which are generally ghost or possession movies.)   If she's squeamish about gore it's an easy show to prewatch and fast forward and close your eyes if need be and still get a great plot. If it's suspense or the twisted and fucked up she doesn't appreciate then another show may be a better choice."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5f2d,solongandthanks42,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"Are we talking jump scares, or long lasting suspense that doesn't get resolved?

AmericanHorrorStory,2u5f2d,treslor,2,Fri Jan 30 02:29:13 2015 UTC,"Season 2 had genuine moments where I had to turn away because of what I call ""mind fuck"" horror, which I feel is what Saw was going for.  If she can last through season 1 and can sit through Saw or Scream, she should be good with the rest of the series.  Others may disagree though..."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5f2d,chattypenguin,2,Fri Jan 30 02:28:30 2015 UTC,I don't really watch it for the horror.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5f2d,BasketeerOverHere,2,Fri Jan 30 01:59:26 2015 UTC,"It's mostly drama. Season 2 probably has the most horror though, but even then it's not super scary. Season 3 is more of a black comedy and has minimal horro, and season 4 is kind of twisted at times and a little disturbing, but not very scary, except for the first half of the season, which does have a bit of horror. I don't know how sensitive your girlfriend is to horror, but I think she'll be fine watching it. But whether it's both of you or just you by yourself, enjoy! It's a good show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u5f2d,Zenabel,1 point,Fri Jan 30 02:31:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm loving it so far, basically she can handle dark themes but not stuff that's lasting horror. Like all of season 1 she would be fine with (after the first episode at least). What would have scared her to death though is if the ""here piggy"" guy was actually killed by a pig man in the shower, and this pig man became a standing character. or if the creature in the basement continued to murder people without being explained."

Season 2 is the scariest and I had to look away sometimes, but I watched it by myself and didn't lose sleep over it.

But I would also add that each season is much more creepy than it is scary, but can have a few gory parts at times.

AmericanHorrorStory,2u0flk,panandacub,6,Thu Jan 29 04:37:25 2015 UTC,I love her! She's a great actress!
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0flk,_silentheartsong,3,Wed Jan 28 23:11:53 2015 UTC,I enjoy Jamie Brewer a lot and I hope to see her in other stuff as well as AHS.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0flk,bwood16,3,Thu Jan 29 00:40:16 2015 UTC,yes she was amazing this season
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0flk,lalagonegaga,2,Thu Jan 29 00:11:23 2015 UTC,"Nan was one of the most endearing characters on AHS so far (and one of the few I genuinely liked in Coven) but Marjorie is definitely Jamie's greatest performance so far, imho."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0flk,alixinwonderland,0,Thu Jan 29 00:26:41 2015 UTC,Really hoping they bring her back in series 5 and give her a bigger role. She does such a good job!
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0flk,Apple_crisp12,0,Thu Jan 29 00:41:03 2015 UTC,I loved Jamie Brewer in every season of AHS that she has been part. I think she is just a wonderfully talented actress.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0flk,lanadelrage,-1,Thu Jan 29 00:50:15 2015 UTC,"I think Marjorie was her best character yet, I loved her. That whole storyline was a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing season for me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0flk,milfboyd,0,Thu Jan 29 11:33:52 2015 UTC,Oh my gOd she was so good as Marjorie she dragged me so hard with her terrifying rendition as a ventriloquist puppet! Reminded me of R.L. Stine's Goosebumps novels/episodes about ventriloquist acts coming to life lol
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0flk,cvfoo7,-1,Thu Jan 29 04:13:42 2015 UTC,she was great as Marjorie... i loved her on the first season. was very sad ahe didnt come back as a ghost though for that first season

AmericanHorrorStory,2u413b,popcorn8123,7,Thu Jan 29 19:20:42 2015 UTC,I don't think anything was confirmed. But I did read some fan theories and speculation that it could have been Vivian saying she had relatives in Florida and that twins run in her family. Which isn't really that solid considering those are very vague and I don't think the timeline fits.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u413b,possessednayru,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:04:07 2015 UTC,"I never saw season one (I just couldn't get into it) but I've seen all the other seasons. On one website, I don't remember which, someone left a comment saying they thought Vivian might be Jimmy and Dot/Bette's daughter since on the last episode of Freakshow, he rubs their belly and says ""how are my girls?"" I can't give much input on this because I don't know anything about Vivan but I thought that would be interesting"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u413b,alextr0n,1 point,Fri Jan 30 06:20:49 2015 UTC,"I believe her was referring to Bette and Dot when he said ""How are my girls?"""
AmericanHorrorStory,2u413b,Princessluna44,1 point,Sun Feb 8 18:15:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah that could be it. I was just repeating a comment I read on another website. Now that I've seen Murder House, I don't think Vivien is their daughter, and it didn't even seem plausible at the time I read it, but I had just barely been getting into the show when I posted that other comment"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u413b,alextr0n,4,Sun Feb 8 18:29:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone knows for sure. There has been a lot of speculation, but we don't have anything as solid as connections between S4 and S2"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u413b,treslor,3,Thu Jan 29 19:40:44 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it was made known. If it was, it was very subtle and noone has caught onto it yet."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u413b,cocobeannns,2,Thu Jan 29 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"Nothing solid has been officially revealed as of yet, but there's a lot of good and potential theories... The two main theories I have seen all over are Vivien's family being from Florida and the doctor's daughter was from Boston, like the Harmon family. Murphy says in his interview about the connections that the theories he has seen online have been completely correct, so very possible it's one of these."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u413b,IamLegba,2,Thu Jan 29 21:25:25 2015 UTC,"I was expecting Jimmy to say, ""Have you thought about names?"" or something, then Dot would say, ""I like Constance,"" or something. But no connection was ever really shown."

AmericanHorrorStory,2u1cbq,ReginaldFarnsworth,12,Thu Jan 29 04:12:15 2015 UTC,Apparently in American Horror Story Jessica Lange IS David Bowie.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1cbq,pacmangod777,4,Thu Jan 29 02:59:51 2015 UTC,I love how her first and last performances that we saw were both covers of David Bowie songs

AmericanHorrorStory,2u1cbq,MKoz628,6,Thu Jan 29 17:41:01 2015 UTC,Well neither is the shot of Bowie so it kind of works.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,b1tchcraft,10,Thu Jan 29 16:43:03 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's going to at all, at least I hope not. I don't see the need for them to do that. There are plenty of people in the real world that claim to be witches and the vast majority do not take those people seriously. Unless Cordelia went on to show people and prove that she has powers, I doubt many people would be buying into the whole witches and magic exist story she was talking about in the interview."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,IamLegba,3,Thu Jan 29 17:29:20 2015 UTC,Well enough girls believed it I uproot their whole lives and move to New Orleans.  I doubt it'd be newsworthy if some random lady claimed to be a supreme witch without some kind of proof.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,IamLegba,3,Thu Jan 29 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"We didn't see her show any proof and it wasn't implied that she did. We did however see girls lining up to join the coven. I personally assumed that they were all girls that were witches and had a reason to listen to Cordelia and to go to the academy. I think that is more likely than a bunch of normal, non-witch girls that saw some lady claiming magic is real on TV and decided to forget their lives to go to New Orleans."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,IamLegba,3,Thu Jan 29 20:04:07 2015 UTC,I guess that's what I'm trying to understand.  Why would the news care that a lady thought she was a witch and that other people thought they were witches?  Why else would that be news?
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,Re-toast,3,Fri Jan 30 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"Nobody can answer that question because we don't see it happen. Either way, if season 5 does take place after Coven, does that mean that the characters will need to acknowledge magic and talk about it, does their story need to include something about witches? No. Could it? Absolutely. I'm just saying that it's not something that I think is going to be featured in other seasons in a direct way."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,Doctor_Arkham,2,Fri Jan 30 02:58:09 2015 UTC,Which is fair.  That's basically what I was wondering too.  I'll have to rewatch that finale to see what I think.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,OjamaKnight,3,Fri Jan 30 03:03:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I brought up this same thing to my girlfriend after the season 3 finale. Its clear that they broadcast to the world that witches are real. That's pretty major imo. I don't think they can just gloss over that.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,LeynaF,2,Fri Jan 30 08:40:17 2015 UTC,"I doubt it; if anything they'll probably reference a ""cult"". I imagine that's what the outside world sees them as."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,S31A,2,Fri Jan 30 00:10:55 2015 UTC,"I would find it really funny if most people just dismissed Cordelia as  some sort of Chris Angel-esque trickster and almost all those girls were simply people who desperately wanted to feel special. As others here said, they don't have to acknowledge or involve magic, but it would be easy for them to go either way with this and either embrace it or ignore it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,jarmon505,2,Fri Jan 30 06:54:06 2015 UTC,I could see Ryan Murphy putting something very subtle in an ep or two.  Maybe Cordelia on the cover of a magazine or newspaper that is laying on a table.  Or her face on the TV in the background of some scene.  Not sure it would be part of the story.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,baeanddot,2,Fri Jan 30 16:48:17 2015 UTC,"I think many people already believe in the supernatural and magic on some level. So I don't think it would really intersect with the story much at all. One way I could see it doing so is if a character was talking about supernatural powers, then another mentioned 'those witch covens' or something."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,playthewayyoufeelit,-1,Sun Feb 1 04:56:56 2015 UTC,You're assuming all seasons take place on the same version of planet earth.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3fk1,baeanddot,5,Thu Jan 29 18:19:04 2015 UTC,Yes.  ...?
AmericanHorrorStory,2u6pbw,glassvase22,3,Fri Jan 30 10:35:19 2015 UTC,"plus at one point during dinner they do the famous ""gooble gobble"" chant scene."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u6pbw,noel-13,2,Fri Jan 30 13:59:24 2015 UTC,Why are you assuming? The creators have been very vocal about their love of the movie Freaks since Coven wrapped. They even mention the movie in the finale as they basically reenact the final scene.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u2ynm,Ras-Algethi,3,Thu Jan 29 14:22:18 2015 UTC,Reading back through a Price Peterson review when I realized Ryan Murphy was foreshadowing her death in the last episode. That clever bugger
AmericanHorrorStory,2u2ynm,MC_Carty,-2,Thu Jan 29 14:23:51 2015 UTC,Wow. Did they just take tumblr images and write an article around them? That was painful.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,MsMNnice,9,Thu Jan 29 04:50:20 2015 UTC,"Well I've heard Paulson's been confirmed and O'Hare said in an interview that he'd love to be in season 5 and he's just waiting for the call. Also Farmiga has always been in every odd numbered season so it makes sense, this might be legit"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,AlfieBoheme,17,Thu Jan 29 14:25:02 2015 UTC,Glad Taissa is coming back
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,malv0,9,Thu Jan 29 12:27:26 2015 UTC,I've heard Sarah Paulson has signed on for S5. Idk about Farmiga and O'Hare.  I'm worried about Taissa coming back because I feel that her characters in Murder House and Coven were wayyyy too similar. They really need to mix it up and give her a completely different character and please no Taissa-Evan romance story for a 3rd time..
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,bwood16,15,Thu Jan 29 18:08:20 2015 UTC,"Imdb can be pretty unreliable, but I definetly wont be mad if these three are in as main characters. Love all three and I'd like to see how the Dennis and Sarah combo would work."

But like wiki, wikia all it takes is an account and it can be updated,edited. I am totally fine with these names for season 5 if and when confirmed officially though. =)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,Snork_Nork,3,Thu Jan 29 19:48:53 2015 UTC,"I'd really like for Taissa to come back for S5.  Although I didn't like her as Zoe in S3, I thought she did an awesome job as Violet in S1. Some people have said that her performance wasn't up to par in Coven, but she's in quite a few high profile movies coming out in 2015 so she must be doing something right.  She was also really good in that thriller movie."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,reddit_greenit,2,Thu Jan 29 21:29:07 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. Zoe was such a boring character that barely did anything. Granted, she could be more of a focus in Murder House, since it was mainly about Violet's family, but the Zoe charcter still kinda sucked to me. Even her romance with Kyle wasn't really needed."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,Princessluna44,3,Sun Feb 8 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: From what I can see, since this was posted, they removed Sarah Paulson and Dennis O'Hare from the cast list, and only Taissa Farmiga is still listed. Also, under the trivia section, it says that it will be about government testing and Area 51, and will tie back to the aliens from season 2. As many have pointed out, IMDB isn't always a reliable source, but I just thought I'd update you guys on what they added or have taken away since OP made the post, which at the time had 3 cast members listed, and nothing noted über the trivia section."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,BasketeerOverHere,3,Fri Jan 30 09:28:30 2015 UTC,Thanks for the update! Just noticed Taissa Farmiga is no longer listed. I guess IMDB doesn't know either. lol
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,lekkerekkel,9,Fri Jan 30 18:38:58 2015 UTC,Unpopular opinion: I don't like Taissa
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,AlfieBoheme,22,Thu Jan 29 09:12:50 2015 UTC,"She was good as Violet, awful as Zoey. I feel like she needs the right character. I'd be happy to see her back though, I like when the actors take some time off and then come back, it makes the season seem fresher"
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,kenbrellfan,2,Thu Jan 29 14:23:57 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. And it wasn't just that I liked her character more, she actually seemed like a worse actress in season 3."

AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,kenbrellfan,6,Sun Feb 8 18:19:20 2015 UTC,"She's one of those AHS actors that the fan base is split on. I personally think she's amazing, but many people on here don't like her."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,playthewayyoufeelit,8,Thu Jan 29 13:13:44 2015 UTC,"Nor do I. I don't know if it's just that she's been given very drab characters to play so far, but I've never understood the appeal. Hopefully she won't reprise her role as 'generic teen who wants to jump Evan Peters' bones'."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,Innunim,3,Thu Jan 29 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"To me, her tone of voice is do monotone, that even if she can portray her characters well, I don't hear a lot of emotion, so it kind of throws me off. I will give her that she's above Emma Roberts and Gaborie (?) in terms of showing emotion."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,MrsVoorhees,3,Thu Jan 29 15:20:03 2015 UTC,Me neither.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,torchdexto,2,Thu Jan 29 10:12:35 2015 UTC,"Same here. She is such an unconvincing actress, and I can't stand any of her stupid, edgy, stereotypical characters."

I know some people are not fond of him on this subreddit but I think he is great actor. He was great as Tate and Kit! Kyle and Jimmy were just alright but I blame that on the writing really.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,BasketeerOverHere,2,Fri Jan 30 03:24:17 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard many people call him a bad actor. Most of the people who say they don't want him back (myself included) admit he's a good actor, and have enjoyed all his roles, but don't want him to dominate the show. He's had very central roles in every season so far, and I'd love to see some them go out with the old and in with the new."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u1smg,prettytiedup763,2,Fri Jan 30 09:26:23 2015 UTC,I see your point. But it maybe risky losing Jessica Lange and Evan Peters both at once.

AmericanHorrorStory,2u3kou,jonjawnjahnsss,4,Thu Jan 29 20:20:49 2015 UTC,"Asylum stays pretty up there for the most part. There's just a lot jam-packed in that season, specifically. But I guess it really depends on your opinion, really. I've heard literally opposite and contradictory opinions of pace in the plots of seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u3kou,anandamidetrip,0,Thu Jan 29 17:26:37 2015 UTC,"Episode 6 is one of Asylum's really boring episodes, but you can't exactly skip it. I'd say the momentum falls in that episode, picks back up in the next one, then things drop again around episode 10. After that you'll either hate or love the ending. The last few episodes are very emotional and some of the best of the series in terms of depth, but it changes pace/tone and always throws off viewers their first time watching it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u2nz5,NorthernRealmJackal,7,Thu Jan 29 12:09:24 2015 UTC,"seeing as how the season ended, it would' ve seem more interesting to have followed that dream sequence. it's rare you get to see the bad guy win. so far all 4 seasons have ended with at least 3 major characters have a happy ending. where are the tears? where's the horror? i wanted to see those heads at the morbidity museum, i wanted to see elsa's freak out as she found out stanley was BSing, and i wanted to see an even bigger freak out from Dandy after finding out the twins were dead! just imagine him going even crazier than he already was and actually stealing the heads & stitching them to his mother & the other lady's body and having the legit twins at his necrophiliac disposal! the season had so much potential but oh well, i guess it was an okay ending, could've been much worse. also elsa totally nailed Heroes."

AmericanHorrorStory,2u2nz5,noel-13,2,Fri Jan 30 12:31:22 2015 UTC,"Flash forwards are an interesting but somewhat gimmicky device. Initially the flash forwards on Lost were pretty intriguing (""We have to go back!"") but I found them and the flash sideways more and more tedious and confusing as it went on. ITs such a powerful device you can feel very disorientated as a viewer and almost like the writers are cheating because they can do anything they want. The fake outs in FS just felt very manipulative and cheap. If you're going to do something like that you have to be so much more clever with it. It felt very clunky and a cheap way to throw the viewer off.      I thought they could have done a bit more with Maggie playing as a clairvoyant. Maybe she is looking through an old trunk and finds an old gypsies crystal ball. In it she sees surreal, horrific visions. Eg Stanley is crushing a lobster with a big hammer with a creepy smile on his face. She sees Jimmy sitting in a chair with his back to her with blood running from somewhere. She walk across to him and as she touches his shoulder he turns around and he has no face. Or she has surreal Lynchian dreams like the backwards talking dwarf in Twin Peaks."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u2nz5,girlsjiggle,2,Fri Jan 30 11:04:42 2015 UTC,"So funny you should say that. I just started watching Twin Peaks for the first time in my life (I'm 25 and I have no idea why I haven't gotten around to it before.).  I just saw the dancing dwarf-scene yesterday, and everything about it creeped my the fuck out (""I feel like I know her. Sometimes my arms bend backwards""). So far, that series have had some of the most unsetteling and outright disturbing elements I've ever seen used in film, without even closing in on being 'horror'.  Like you said - more Lynch and less classic horror would maybe have suited a season like 'Freakshow' really well. It does have it's unsetteling moments, though."

I also always put the well being of my friends before mine, which really only ends up hurting me. (Which then hurts my friends) Like him and Violet.

Jews were viewed as ""sub-human,"" if that. They probably didn't see it as any different than injecting a rabbit for medical breakthroughs.

So many books/shows/films try to do the whole Daria Morgendorffer thing but it's done to death and rarely comes off as ""cool"" as they want it to.  Also on a totally superficial note, I was really annoyed that they basically changed nothing about her hair or dress sense since Murder House.

AmericanHorrorStory,2u2d5t,Drwatson186,2,Fri Jan 30 01:38:08 2015 UTC,Like the people who burned misty? And yeah I totally agree with you.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u2d5t,chattypenguin,2,Fri Jan 30 05:08:23 2015 UTC,"Least favorite actor is Taissa Farmiga.  I just don't like either of her characters.  I don't hate them, but I don't like them.  They're just not very memorable to me.  Least favorite character was Madame LaLaurie.  She was just so over the top evil and disgusting.  And I love Kathy Bates, but I just couldn't with her in season 3.  Completely vile."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u2d5t,Malarkay79,2,Fri Jan 30 05:34:02 2015 UTC,S1: The mom. She was annoying to me.  S2: I can't say I didn't like anyone. At least I can't remember not liking anyone.  S3: Kyle. He didn't talk for like half the season.  S4: I didn't like Dell at first. Same with his 3 boobed wife. Didn't like her too much but I came around later.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u2d5t,Re-toast,3,Fri Jan 30 08:50:05 2015 UTC,Taissa — both of her characters. Evan — all except jimmy. (He just doesn't act very well IMO). Larry Harvey. Gab Sidibe — Regina. Dell Toledo.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u2d5t,lekkerekkel,6,Thu Jan 29 09:17:44 2015 UTC,I completely disagree with Larry and Dell. They were probably my favorite parts of their seasons.

AmericanHorrorStory,2twvw9,chattypenguin,21,Wed Jan 28 02:36:38 2015 UTC,One of those moments I internally screamed so loud that I might have actually screamed already.
AmericanHorrorStory,2twvw9,BocoCHutternut,9,Wed Jan 28 10:18:38 2015 UTC,"Having my friend watch Asylum for the firs time was so much fun. This scene had her yelling ""GO GO GO GO BITCH, GO!"" And I was laughing hysterically. I rarely see her get invested in TV shows that intensely, but it's always amazing when it happens.   ""I KNEW he was Bloody Face!""  ""How did this show make me love a character that I hated so much?"" (Referring to Sister Jude)  ""Aliens? Motherfucking ALIENS? This show has everything and I love it!"""
AmericanHorrorStory,2twvw9,torchdexto,11,Wed Jan 28 16:27:36 2015 UTC,"My first reaction to all the different plot lines had me going ""okay this is way too much bullshit happening all at once""  By the end I had done a 180 and was loving all the different horror elements involved.  The Sister Jude storyline really got me at the end.  I went from completely hating her, to pitying her to feeling sad when she finally passed."
AmericanHorrorStory,2twvw9,SailorDeath,8,Wed Jan 28 17:54:31 2015 UTC,Sister Jude is one of my all time favorite AHS characters. Her character redemption was beautifully done.

AmericanHorrorStory,2twvw9,GamingTatertot,2,Fri Jan 30 04:24:17 2015 UTC,Seriously? That can't be true. Asylum is easily the best and Coven the worst. Wow.

AmericanHorrorStory,2u4gmp,Snork_Nork,1 point,Thu Jan 29 23:39:57 2015 UTC,"The Axeman:       The Axeman was a jazz musician who played saxophone in various clubs throughout New Orleans. After the city was rocked by a 1919 killing spree, the Axeman typed up a confession naming his murder victims and intention to kill again, which was delivered to and printed by the local newspaper. The manifesto promised amnesty to those residents who played jazz music in their homes. However, further murders were prevented as the Axeman was lured by the defiant opera emanating from Miss Robichaux's Academy. Within, he is baited into a room by the witch Millie who, with the aid of magic and a knife in the hand of every one of her coven sisters, puts an end to his reign of terror over their community. His spirit secretly remained behind as a ghost confined to the school.

AmericanHorrorStory,2ty8t3,abcdefgrapes,23,Wed Jan 28 10:35:50 2015 UTC,"I remember the false head being really quite visible in the last couple of episodes. I seem to remember noticing it far more when they do those awkward shots to make it seem as if her twin is there, without having to do the CGI. I dunno if they just used it more often but there were shots of the back of its head and stuff, where you could clearly see it was false. I must have missed this frontal shot though...those dead eyes are creepy!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ty8t3,Jarrrp,7,Wed Jan 28 17:29:26 2015 UTC,It was more creepy in these forward shots because they tried to make it look like the fake head was blinking but god it was so off putting.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ty8t3,HarleyQ,5,Wed Jan 28 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"I agree. I wasn't sure if I noticed it more because I saw a short clip on how having two heads was accomplished, or if they just got lazy at the end."

It was probably an absolute chore planning and shooting scenes including Bette and Dot. Writers for other shows simply wouldn't have invented such a character (or characters) due to that.  Once I got over the obvious camera trickery, I bought the characters. Sarah Paulson is just a great actor."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ty8t3,krrt,6,Wed Jan 28 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"The other scene that stuck out to me that I can't find a cap of, was when they were tied up in the tent and they tried to conceal the fake head with the pole they were tied to but it just wasn't happening."

AmericanHorrorStory,2ty8t3,greatredpie,8,Thu Jan 29 00:34:34 2015 UTC,"Well if we're going to be technical, Sarah filmed her scenes for Bette and Dot separately. When she was playing one character, the fake head was added for reasons. On TV, it's just the best damn CGI I've seen on a TV show."

It deals with morals, psychology, religion, and so many other things. I feel like the following didn't really take the topic seriously enough. The entire murder cult idea got stupid after every other person was in the cult. And the Edgar Allen Poe riddle was so goddamn cliche. Sarah Paulson would be a great cult leader (I've seen her play a sociopath before, she nails it.)   American Horror Story could pull off a cult very very well. Like Emmy nominations well.

Binging makes the story feel tighter and helps to keep you from forgetting things that happened in the last few episodes.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tywhw,clwestbr,1 point,Thu Feb 5 06:30:31 2015 UTC,"I think it's because there is sooooo much happening, that it's easy to lose track.  Kind of how I feel about the hiatus that Lost took in their last season.  I tapped out."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tywhw,eleventwentyfourteen,1 point,Thu Feb 5 14:44:47 2015 UTC,Yes! I binge watched murder house and it was great
AmericanHorrorStory,2tywhw,solongandthanks42,1 point,Mon Feb 16 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"It is, but I think some things can't be fixed. I think Coven is better binged, so is season 1. Freak Show is still uneven and Asylum is still...well I won't discuss what I think of it, I just get horrible things sent to my inbox."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tywhw,crazzybabby,-4,Thu Jan 29 00:01:58 2015 UTC,"No, the older seasons are just better. They started off really strong with Murder House and then got a little goofy (but not too much) with Asylum and then tried to appeal more to the Twilight crowd with Coven and finally just didn't know wtf to do with Freak Show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tywhw,treslor,1 point,Wed Jan 28 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"As someone whose favorite was coven this may be a cultural thing. I grew up in the Deep South and the tie ins to the paranoia and superstition that's here is amazing. For me, this is the stuff I warned of as a child.   And freak show. Clowns terrify me and I could barely watch some of it. AHS I think knows how to play with everyone's various fears.  I am waiting to see if he does something involving aracnaphobia sp? I know so many people that can't do the spider thing and feel like this would be a hell of an episode to fuck with someone."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tzoqc,IeatDogfood,15,Wed Jan 28 21:14:16 2015 UTC,"Probably because it's a question that gets asked, at minimum, every other day and we all wish people would use the search function.  ¯_(ツ)_/¯"

AmericanHorrorStory,2tzoqc,LeynaF,5,Wed Jan 28 21:39:14 2015 UTC,Why does it bother you so much? You were new to Reddit one day. It bugs me that people have the time to be hurtful but not helpful.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tzoqc,IeatDogfood,-1,Wed Jan 28 23:51:51 2015 UTC,Fair point.  I'm not sure why it annoys me.  I usually ignore it or link to the original thread if it was recent.  I don't downvote.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzoqc,LeynaF,3,Thu Jan 29 00:48:52 2015 UTC,Maybe they are new to Reddit and don't know about the search function. Don't downvote them and make them feel dumb. It's rude. Just tell them to use the search function.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tzoqc,davis98,2,Thu Jan 29 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"Probably because he is a fan of the show? I'm a huge fan of the show, and I like contributing to this subreddit, and I like the nice people that I talk to on this reddit. But its more annoying when you see people being dicks about people asking questions when they're new to the sub. If they feel like the question is too stupid to answer, don't answer it. That doesn't mean they have to be down voted. Just let the helpful people who like informing people answer."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzoqc,Oddbaugh,1 point,Thu Jan 29 19:51:38 2015 UTC,"It's not that the question was stupid, it's that it's asked constantly. The downvoters want a better quality sub, which the above user has already judged as ""nasty."""
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzoqc,davis98,2,Thu Jan 29 21:01:54 2015 UTC,Being snarky is what makes this sub a bad place. How ironic.
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0h0b,Kaiji420,10,Wed Jan 28 22:19:43 2015 UTC,"It would be very similar to Freak Show though. Stage performers, likely misunderstood, a dying attraction."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0h0b,S31A,-2,Wed Jan 28 22:40:00 2015 UTC,Yeah that's probably true.  It would be modern day magicians though.  Modern magicians are more the douchey David Blaine/Chris Angel type so maybe it'd be different.  Maybe some type of endurance stunt gone wrong?
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0h0b,nastylep,2,Wed Jan 28 22:57:15 2015 UTC,"I think those would still likely be classified as ""dying attractions""."
AmericanHorrorStory,2u0h0b,Snork_Nork,1 point,Thu Jan 29 14:23:09 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind seeing something along the lines of The IBM(international brotherhood of magicians) or (S.A.M) Society of American Magicians. The mentions of Houdini throughout the season and  him actually have being international president in 1916-1927. It could leave room for secret society's in older times leading to modern times. Beyond tricks and illusions and what we think we know. Catches my interest more than chemical warfare anyway.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzg7g,MarkoNeroo,4,Wed Jan 28 17:54:11 2015 UTC,"it sounds like it was taken from  http://youtu.be/4jYMHb1mtvw (Twisty's theme, opening scene when the twins first arrive at the Freakshow). My guess is that it is an AHS version.   Love the original theme."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzg7g,Snork_Nork,3,Wed Jan 28 22:04:43 2015 UTC,This theme is awesome but sadly not this! I found this http://elizarioux.tumblr.com/post/107717559957/what-a-sicko-tell-me-how-did-they-die its a close remake but not the original!

AmericanHorrorStory,2tzg7g,grumblebuzz,1 point,Thu Jan 29 06:04:41 2015 UTC,I completely missed this in the show. I thought this was the first time I've heard it. It's an amazing theme. I personally feel as though this piece is more relevant to the show than some of the other pieces used this season. Thanks for posting this!
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzg7g,Bosskid3,3,Sun Feb 1 01:18:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry I can't help you with finding the tune (I've been searching for it too) but I just wanted to say that they used that tune so cleverly on the show!! It starts off as Twisty's theme, then gets transferred to Dandy after Twisty leaves. And then after Blood Bath where Dandy goes off the deep end the same theme plays but in a much more distorted tone. By the final episode the theme is completely distorted and barely recognizable, and then goes really slow during the final Dandy scene. Anyone else notice this? I thought it was brilliant."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzg7g,Infersader,2,Thu Jan 29 14:24:39 2015 UTC,"YES I DID! It was used to perfectly, I hope one day someone out there is able to scoop it up and release it online. It made his character seem twice as terrifying!!"

When Massimo mentioned the fake towns it made me think about maybe an Area 51/cold war/alien type of American Horror Story."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tyo3l,B311,4,Wed Jan 28 18:28:28 2015 UTC,"Lots of mushroom cloud and nuclear weapon imagery, the massimo mention of the towns, and top hats make me think that present day aliens will either be attempting to stop or cause a nuclear war, with flashbacks to the 50s nuclear testing."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tyo3l,bwood16,3,Wed Jan 28 16:27:53 2015 UTC,Garden of Allah   Enlighten me? What's the significance of this? Hotel?
AmericanHorrorStory,2tyo3l,Ridicvic,5,Wed Jan 28 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"Its a famous hotel in hollywood. Stanley mentions his cousins works there and in the first episode Elsa has a newspaper movie review of Deidrich in the film, The garden of Allah. I don't know if it has any significance, I just picked up on it being mentioned twice. I believe we found out the theme for S4 was going to be a freakshow in March, so hopefully we only have to wait a few weeks to find out for season 5"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tz6px,itwhom,4,Wed Jan 28 16:43:22 2015 UTC,Yes. They mentioned it when Jimmy tried to stop them from killing Elsa. If I remember correctly.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tz6px,BigStupidBai,3,Wed Jan 28 18:52:56 2015 UTC,He was told by Eve before they went to kill Elsa I thought.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tyodp,kenbrellfan,3,Wed Jan 28 14:07:43 2015 UTC,"Coven was definitely the most gory and violent season, but aside from what LaLaurie did in the past, much of the shock and horror of the brutality was taken away by Misty being able to revive people and also by Marie and Delphine being immortal.  It became more of an episodic, ""Welp, let's tune in and see who dies this week so we'll know who comes back next week"" kind of thing.  I mean, Kathy Bates' disembodied, decapitated head was on a table singing ""Dixie Land"" at one point.  The violence was definitely meant to be over the top and funny."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,SkunkyDunk,5,Wed Jan 28 19:26:58 2015 UTC,It was a goodbye to Jessica Lange...
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,Milfhunter420,8,Wed Jan 28 23:50:58 2015 UTC,"Did anybody else think the ending could've have been bad? SPOILERSS Just like Misty Day in season 3. It ended as soon as she started singing maybe she's doomed to be forever booed off the stage, but she gets to be with her Freaks. Which is still alright, but that's kind of what I got from the ending. I'm sure other people have thought the same."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,elektroloop,5,Wed Jan 28 21:04:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, I thought that too. The whole scene, for me, was about leaving to the imagination what really was happening there. We don't know if that place was heaven or hell."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,Milfhunter420,3,Wed Jan 28 21:19:36 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm glad somebody thinks the same way about this. I haven't seen anybody mention that on this subreddit yet. It was totally an Inception ending.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,elektroloop,3,Wed Jan 28 21:31:51 2015 UTC,I guess people are too worried about how it could have been instead of enjoying what it was.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,Chase615,1 point,Wed Jan 28 21:38:58 2015 UTC,I don't think it was. She seemed perfectly happy to be where she was. She did not deserve a happy ending
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,Milfhunter420,1 point,Thu Jan 29 14:25:32 2015 UTC,"They didn't show us her singing on stage. Everybody probably thought she sucked like in an earlier episode. You never know. It ended like that on purpose. I'm sure she's still kind of happy because she's with her freaks, but that could still be her hell and we'll never know."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,Malarkay79,2,Thu Jan 29 21:25:59 2015 UTC,"I just watched the finale, and I thought that was a possibility as well.  They definitely left it ambiguous so that we could fill in the blanks, ourselves, whichever way we were hoping.  I'm kind of okay with thinking it was a happy ending.  I don't think Elsa was nearly as bad as Constance or Fiona, so I don't mind her finding happiness in a modest afterlife, especially after her coming to the realization that love and friendship did mean more to her than fame and fortune."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,mikesicle,12,Fri Jan 30 05:41:18 2015 UTC,"My take on it is the reason she got to live is because her evil was a direct result of what Dr. Gruper did to her. She did horrible things, but it was the product of her being turned into a ""freak"" thats to blame.   At the end, Dell wasnt anywhere to be seen in the tent, because his evil came from his hatred of himself, who HE was. Dell killed because he was ashamed of himself, Elsa killed because she would do anything to get back in the spotlight, a spotlight that was ripped (or should I say sawed?) away from her by the evil doctor.  That being said, Im looking way too far into all of this and its probably just some bullshit decision in the writers room to give Jessica Lange a nice sendoff."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,monsieurxander,3,Wed Jan 28 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"Dell's hatred of himself came from how the world viewed people like him, though. It's more of a slow burn than getting your legs chopped off, but it's still an external source warping your sense of self."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,anandamidetrip,9,Thu Jan 29 05:37:42 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem is whether you define Elsa as a bad guy or not. Deep down she did love her freaks, but they constantly whip-lashed her personality in favor of the events in a particular episode. So it a lot of ways she was a good guy and a bad guy.   Also considering the freaks were happy to see Elsa, and the crowd was cheering for Elsa we can assume she got what she always wanted, so essentially it's a happy ending."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,Oddbaugh,2,Wed Jan 28 20:04:58 2015 UTC,"Eh, she wasn't much worse than all of the other freaks. They all had a murderous streak. When you think about it, Elsa wasn't that bad of a person. She only killed ethel out of self defense, she only killed dell because he killed ma petite, and she only sold the freaks to dandy because they were all coming after her. And I believe she really did care for her monsters. The only things I can remember that was super bad of her was all of the stuff she did to the twins out of jealousy, and stabbing paul."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,imthebar,3,Thu Jan 29 21:18:35 2015 UTC,"I agree it wasn't a happy ending, in the conventional sense. That being said, I loved it. I thought it was perfect. Weird as hell. Thanked god it wasn't another cookie cutter finale like Coven had - sometimes justice isn't served."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,Majestic87,3,Thu Jan 29 03:58:45 2015 UTC,Thank You!! No one seems to be with me on this one! It makes me so frustrated.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,SimplyComplexx,1 point,Wed Jan 28 19:43:03 2015 UTC,i don't like the whole happy ending/justice served ideas in tv series and films I'd prefer a ending that has the most likely outcome even if it doesn't satisfy me as a viewer. I was rooting for dandy to come out on top eventually and how he was dealt with really annoyed me. Personally I didn't view Elsa as a 'bad guy' just a selfish person.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,Malarkay79,1 point,Thu Jan 29 13:19:10 2015 UTC,"I expected Dandy to end up with Mordrake.  I was wrong, which I'm kind of disappointed about."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tzt3s,mistar_z,1 point,Fri Jan 30 05:44:19 2015 UTC,"It was more like a goodbye to Jessica, seeing as this is her last season. Like she was playing a roll in her past life."

AmericanHorrorStory,2twdbf,prettytiedup763,3,Wed Jan 28 00:07:06 2015 UTC,I Love it too :)  people just rag on it so much
AmericanHorrorStory,2twdbf,prettytiedup763,2,Wed Jan 28 00:10:10 2015 UTC,I guess it's because we wait so long in between seasons that people get super high expectations and end up disappointed in some ways.
AmericanHorrorStory,2twdbf,baileath,1 point,Wed Jan 28 00:24:41 2015 UTC,I think it's because people like what they're familiar with. MH and Asylum have been around longer and use pretty familiar horror story elements; Freak Show just finished and utilized pretty unfamiliar horror themes.
AmericanHorrorStory,2twdbf,monkeysrule123,5,Wed Jan 28 00:54:45 2015 UTC,Its also the fact that the seasons are on  netflix. Coven was only put on about a month or two ago and now people are posting saying it isnt all that bad. Freakshow gets hate because it tried to sway away from what the show normally does. Once its on netflix it will be the favorite.
AmericanHorrorStory,2twdbf,Uldyr,4,Wed Jan 28 01:29:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think the show is meant to be watched on a week-to-week basis. I recently got into the show last spring and watched through the first two seasons and loved them (as did everyone). After watching other shows and whatnot, I watched Coven as soon as it went onto Netflix as that's when I had an opportunity. I freaking loved that season. A lot. Then with Freak Show, I watched it with my friends when the episodes were released and I started to dislike it. It seemed to slow at times. But now having finished the season and seeing that amazing ending, I looked back and realized that had I watched all episodes in a shorter amount of time, back to back, it would have been much more enjoyable. But that's my opinion, others may think differently."

AmericanHorrorStory,2twdbf,lurkingphoenix,5,Wed Jan 28 00:03:42 2015 UTC,That's cause the last season is on Netflix and by then and everyone is able to binge.
AmericanHorrorStory,2twdbf,MakeYouThink,8,Wed Jan 28 00:05:56 2015 UTC,"that's a good point, I think there is a difference binge watching versus watching with a  week or gaps in-between.... people really forget shit in the course of a month or two that they don't when they've just watched the episode a few hours ago  everyone is so quick to assume that something that doesn't make sense is a HUGE PLOT HOLE when sometimes it's just viewer error......."

The fact that those who die in the house turn to ghosts and haunt it is pretty elementary stuff. As for the seasons being connected, their connections are extremely minor and aren't even important. I think the connections are more of a fun Easter egg for the fans than anything else. Don't spend much time watching the show and wondering about the connections to other seasons, because it's not really important. Just enjoy each season completely on its own. Also, have fun! Season 1 is probably my favorite."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv0x9,Taylor_Satine,3,Tue Jan 27 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how I see the ""connections"" too, as fun Easter eggs. I get excited when I recognize something that was in another season, but some people seem to be obsessing over it."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tv0x9,MatchEntry,2,Wed Jan 28 01:09:45 2015 UTC,"yeah, the ""connections"" are fun easter eggs for the diehard fans.  I think most of it is retconned stuff anyway, I don't think they were planning on that from the beginning."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tv0x9,Bruce-Vain,8,Tue Jan 27 19:02:43 2015 UTC,"In terms of theme, it's the most American of all of the seasons.  It's a parody of settling down, getting that perfect home, living the American Dream, except oh shit the past never really goes away and American culture is really good at avoiding accountability and making the same mistakes over and over again.  The other seasons take place in distinct US locations (except maybe Asylum), but that's about it.  That's honestly why I prefer the title American Horror Story over Murder House, but it helps with clarity."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tv0x9,Bruce-Vain,1 point,Wed Jan 28 04:18:42 2015 UTC,"When I meant Asylum wasn't distinctly US, I only meant that Briarcliff didn't have a specifically American feel.  I knew it was New England, but Coven has the Southern racial tensions and Freak Show has the weird corruption of the upper class old money thing with the Motts; but Asylum could have been any Gothic asylum in the world.  Could have very well been in England with almost no plot changes."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tvi9b,kenbrellfan,17,Tue Jan 27 19:46:44 2015 UTC,Coven was definitely campy and was horror/comedy. But that was the intent. Part of the horror genre is embracing the campy-ness and ridiculousness of it all. Coven played on that perfectly and is no way an insult to the season. It is my favorite season because it played into the camp and did it so well.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tvi9b,jtyler27,31,Tue Jan 27 22:06:51 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong  with horror comedy. Coven is one. It's one of the most popular and respected subgenres of horror and has been around for centuries. It's the people on this sub that try to make it seem inferior for it being so, that it has no depth. I looked at Coven as more of a absurdist southern gothic styled horror comedy."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tvi9b,mrignatiusjreily,5,Tue Jan 27 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know I just don't see it like that. Sure there were comedy elements, but there were comedy elements in all seasons. I'm not saying you're wrong, but Coven never struck me as a comedy."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tvi9b,mrignatiusjreily,28,Tue Jan 27 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"It's a black comedy because it follows large patterns in that genre. Such as:  Taboo subjects turned into a funny aspect: Making light of taboo and serious subjects, such as death, rape, slavery, murder, and racism.  Fatalism: Coven had a domino effect in its story structure. Kyle dies and his body is brought  to the morgue near Misty's cabin. Zoe and Madison bring Kyle back and Zoe meets Misty through Kyle. Madison is killed, her corpse later found in terrible condition, but luckily Zoe now has a friend who can bring back the dead.   Extreme or cosmic irony: Fiona is facing death no matter what but is forced  to watched her clumsy young competition, enemies (Marie and Myrtle), and other random people (Delphine, Joan and Kyle) cheat death with relative ease.  The real problem with Coven is that people see it as not as meaningful as the first two seasons because of how silly it seems on the surface due to it's comedic overtones and snappy dialogue, but I think it's just as thought-provoking. A lot of people still didn't get what the story was really about in the first place,  so, at best, they'll say it's a dumb story that at least has funny moments to make it ""watchable""."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tvi9b,mrignatiusjreily,2,Tue Jan 27 23:40:17 2015 UTC,"The difference with the other seasons is that they build themselves around different genres. Murder House was a soap opera, Asylum a psychological thriller, Freak Show a melodrama. It's okay that you don't see it as a comedy, but it sort of is. Lol"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tvi9b,Malachim,12,Wed Jan 28 02:37:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think Coven was campy per se, but it was definitely a black comedy. Just look at Nan's death (""she killed the neighbour, but the bitch had it coming"") (""We have to say good-bye to Nan, who fell in the tub."" ""Amen."")  All of the serious scenes were inter-cut with death-related humor."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tvi9b,jackanthonyfernandez,5,Tue Jan 27 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I took it as a way to demonstrate their ruthlessness and lack of empathy. Someone you know well just died and instead of being sad and somber, you crack a snarky joke. I don't think they were intended to be comical to the audience. More of a snarky, bitchy remark to show a lack of empathy, and also the lack of cohesion within the Coven."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tvi9b,Enkiae,15,Wed Jan 28 19:46:33 2015 UTC,Having the central character be a youth-obsessed witch who's past her prime is about as campy as you can get.  KNOTTY PINE?!
AmericanHorrorStory,2tvi9b,noel-13,4,Tue Jan 27 20:11:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why you think calling something campy is selling it short. Sure some people use that adjective in a negative way, but a lot of people enjoy camp. And something can be campy but still have moments of genuine amazingness, which Coven does have (in fact I'd argue that something that tried too hard to be only camp isn't actual camp)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tvi9b,Bruce-Vain,6,Wed Jan 28 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"""Campy"" isn't just an adjective, it's an actual technical term used in the tv/film/theatre world -- there are probably people who have done master theses on what camp is as a theatrical element, what it means, and what its parameters are. ""Campy"" doesn't just mean ""over the top"", and campy isn't a bad thing in the entertainment world, either. The parts of Coven that were campy were deliberately designed that way. So, when people call Coven campy, they're likely not writing it off as an unintentional farce (maybe sometimes they are, but basically, calling Coven campy isn't an insult)."

AmericanHorrorStory,2twtu8,monkeysrule123,8,Wed Jan 28 01:31:05 2015 UTC,"You kinda answered it yourself; people were frustrated with the narrative difficulties. I don't think that was because Freak Show had a different setting, rather, people felt that it wasted the potential the setting could have brought. On the contrary, I think radical changes to the show are welcome, provided that its supported by tight writing and development. All in all, I do think many people really enjoyed Freak Show (myself being one of them), but reddit is used as a vehicle to get involved with a show people are very passionate about and express how they'd do things if they were a part of the creative process."

I still kind of enjoyed Freak Show, but the Horror part felt like it only really applied to Dandy, Stan and Neil Patrick Harris's character (I forgot his name). I got tired of the musicals very fast (again I'm in the boat that the songs weren't era appropriate), but I enjoyed the Name Game in Asylum because of how absurd it was and it showed how far down the rabbit hole Jude went once they started medicating and shocking her.  I want next season to go back to Asylum and Murder House quality, super dark and fucked up without much humour. I liked Coven too, though, particularly Delphine and Marie, especially Delphine, even the mute Spalding was seriously fucked up in a fantastic horror way. I'm hoping that since Ryan is getting Scream Queens done, he can play out his horror comedy there and bring AHS back to what it was a few seasons ago."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,ZomNoms,3,Tue Jan 27 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"I'm only part way through Coven, but if it stays as exciting and wild as it is where I'm at, then it'll probably be my favorite.  Great premise, none of the subplots feel like fluff, and every once in a while there's actually a legitimate scare (which, honestly, nothing in the show has scared me since the early Rubber Man scenes.  Asylum did a good job, but I wasn't personally scared).  The scene that made my spine crawl the most so far in Coven was when The Axeman sat down next to Fiona and they both smiled.  Simple and effective, because the buildup was so fantastic and I cared about the characters.  EDIT: Also, I thought Murder House was very campy at first.  Not comedic, but very over-the-top.  I mean that in a positive way."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,ZomNoms,5,Tue Jan 27 19:41:48 2015 UTC,"Even as a fan of Coven I will say that the plot kind of falls apart a bit somewhere after the halfway point, it's still entertaining with some fantastic and unexpected moments though.

I can see how all the focus on different theory and hints post can get repetitive, but I hardly think they are unnecessary or stupid. They engage the audience and keep long-time AHS fans on their toes. I don't see how they could possibly take away from a good story or plot, considering anyone could watch any of the seasons without knowledge of any hints or Easter eggs and the story would still have the same effect. You also say that the appeal after season 1 was that we'd get new stories, locations, plots, etc... That is exactly what we've gotten. Every season has been a new theme, new location, some old faces and some new. There was a minor connection to season 2 in freak show, but again, somebody could watch season 4 with no knowledge of asylum and the story still makes sense."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,lurkingphoenix,3,Tue Jan 27 18:33:06 2015 UTC,"But the problem I'm having is Murphy has suggested these connections will become even bigger in the future.  In his EW interview, he claimed his goal was to eventually connect every season.  That's stupid.  I'm not sure how far along he really was with prep for season 5 when he said that, so he could be talking out of his ass.  But you are right.  So far they have stayed true to their formula (for the most part), but we're getting hints that maybe that's going to change."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,ZomNoms,4,Tue Jan 27 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"This is a good point, but I'd recommend you take his words with a grain of salt. He could end up coming back saying that only 2 and 4 connects. Who knows? As long as they keep each season and story isolated, I don't see an issue with the connections. The seasons need to operate as their own entities, the moment that you'd be required to watch a previous season to understand a current season is the moment that AHS will lose its novelty."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,lurkingphoenix,4,Tue Jan 27 20:22:01 2015 UTC,He hyped up Twisty for months to kill him in an early episode and then hyped his return to have Twisty say one line. I wouldn't take anything at face value.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,ZomNoms,4,Tue Jan 27 20:43:58 2015 UTC,"That's Ryan's problem really, he gives away so much and really hypes up certain things he shouldn't. He even gives out total bullshit at times, like he said there wasn't going to be anything supernatural about this season and if Edward Mordrake and the souls of dead freaks hanging out with him and collecting the souls of the living wasn't supernatural, then what the fuck does he call it?"

AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,rcinmd,4,Wed Jan 28 02:03:01 2015 UTC,"I wish so much they hadn't spoiled Lily's cameo, I was really looking forward to it when I heard about it, more so when it was Sister Mary Eunice, but I can only imagine how much happier and excited I would have been if it was a complete surprise, and there was no avoiding the news either, you could unsub but then you've got EW and other places posting it on FB and stuff, it sucked."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,BasketeerOverHere,2,Wed Jan 28 02:08:09 2015 UTC,"I'm always late to the party regarding tv and didn't stumble onto AHS until the 2nd or 3rd episode of Asylum. It reminded me of the first season of Twin Peaks a million years ago; odd, quirky, excellent cast and writing, different from the usual crap. Six Feet Under was another show that caught my interest for the same reasons. But much like Twin Peaks and SFU, AHS has declined in quality over subsequent seasons.  I rewatched Freak Show during this blizzard and while it had its' moments, AHS def derailed this season. Next season could be amazing or it could totally crash and burn. I will watch and hope the writers can step up their game to match the quality of the cast. However, w/out some tlc and focus from RM, imo it'll fade away."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,MakeYouThink,5,Wed Jan 28 06:41:01 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it but for AHS to be ""not stale"" they have to dump the cast and start fresh. I feel like Murphy has fallen into that trap of writing for the actors. While they are all phenomenal it doesn't help the story when you force a story along because you know a particular actor will give an Emmy worthy performance for X conflict, and that's just what it seems has happened here."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,BasketeerOverHere,5,Tue Jan 27 18:53:57 2015 UTC,"I think ratings would drop immeasurably if they did that. So many of the viewers only tune in because they've fallen in love with their favorite actors from previous seasons. They already feel a bit attached to the show because they already have an emotional attachment to the cast. In fact, that's one of the defining qualities of AHS. It wouldn't feel the same at all with everyone gone. However, if they go with a rolling cast, where the actors can stay, but only for two or three seasons, and then they need to be replaced, then we get the best of both worlds. We still get to keep this fun AHS trademark, but at the same time they wouldn't be able to stay long enough to dominate the show. As much as I love Jessica Lange (in fact, she's the primary reason I watched the first season!) I think it's good she's finally moving on. I suggest the same for Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,BasketeerOverHere,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:16:36 2015 UTC,Aren't they though? We know for a fact that Sarah Paulson won't be in AHS but instead the spinoff American Crime Story
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,Dilly_bar,3,Wed Jan 28 05:13:35 2015 UTC,"IIRC the filming schedules are shot at different times of the year, so they aren't gonna conflict. So she is able to be in AHS again, and RM will probably invite her, but I don't think Sarah Paulson has said anything about what she plans to do yet. I could be wrong, but I think that's what I've heard."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tv40f,Yokui,2,Wed Jan 28 05:56:10 2015 UTC,"That's a little extreme.  AHS should develop over time, not just burst all at once."
AmericanHorrorStory,2twsgm,abcdefgrapes,5,Wed Jan 28 01:20:06 2015 UTC,"To be fair in regards to Edward Mordrake, he spent so much time hearing all their stories in the beginning because he hadn't heard them before. Elsa already told him her story, so when he showed up again on Halloween he already knew her and they didn't need any introduction."

AmericanHorrorStory,2txv7g,nocchisus,7,Wed Jan 28 08:08:48 2015 UTC,That was confirmed?
AmericanHorrorStory,2txv7g,abradolph,-1,Wed Jan 28 08:10:49 2015 UTC,Not really. But a fellow redditor bartended(?) some staff and one of em said that the next season is about magicians
AmericanHorrorStory,2txv7g,nocchisus,12,Wed Jan 28 08:13:41 2015 UTC,"Wrong. /u/Gummp's quote is as follows:   ""One guy also made jokes about the fake head that was very noticeable in the signature Dandy scene in the finale, and we were laughing about how it blinked its eye and all. I also asked what they thought season 5 might be about, and one guy excitedly said ""Magicians!!""""  It's an unnamed, unconfirmed idea from an excited, tired, and possibly drunk crew member. In any case, I highly doubt that Ryan Murphy would tell camera crew what Season 5 is about. Actors get the details first, and even Jessica Lange and Sarah Paulson get only the smallest of hints for their characters.

AmericanHorrorStory,2ttztt,jaystyler,7,Tue Jan 27 12:03:29 2015 UTC,A logical guess is yes.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttztt,Cordicuss,3,Tue Jan 27 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"I'd say no. The others released the day after and it's been almost a week, now.   My theory? I think Ryan Murphy wanted to put another song in without making a big deal about it. We knew all of the songs before the episode they were in aired, but we had no idea there was going to be another song in the finale. So I doubt Heroes will get a release due to the poor reception to the music in the season in general."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttztt,Lecter07,5,Tue Jan 27 16:18:19 2015 UTC,I really liked it though. ):
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttztt,cosmicpizza666,5,Tue Jan 27 16:22:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't get me wrong, it was season defining, in my opinion. I thought when the music started playing and all we saw was Elsa standing against that beautiful light was the moment the season became AAA material. But, a lot of people hated the musical bits and so they probably won't release it. :("

AmericanHorrorStory,2tsmbv,MsMNnice,14,Wed Jan 28 05:51:11 2015 UTC,"I think people are missing the point of this show. Yes, it is a semi-spinoff of AHS but it's meant to be a horror-comedy. Also judging from the premise and name (Scream Queens, a horror comedy starring Emma Roberts set on a college campus), it seems aimed more at a Mean Girls/Clueless sort of vibe. I think Nick Jonas certainly works for that"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tsmbv,AlfieBoheme,9,Tue Jan 27 16:01:19 2015 UTC,Seriously people are totally missing the point and it's just another circle jerk now.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tsmbv,mansonfamily,8,Tue Jan 27 16:25:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Let's be honest, just because you like one Murphy show doesn't mean you'll like another. Glee is the polar opposite of AHS and even if we look at similar genres, Glee is completely different to The New Normal. People need to stop getting upset that they don't like the casting when the show clearly isn't aimed at them."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tsmbv,AlfieBoheme,7,Tue Jan 27 18:02:09 2015 UTC,"Thank fuck someone else sees this. ""poor casting"" actually for the kinda show they're going for that's pretty accurate and impressive casting"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tsmbv,mansonfamily,4,Tue Jan 27 18:12:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly, if Nick Jonas was cast for AHS I'd be a bit confused but for this it makes perfect sense. In the same way that I wouldn't want Kathy Bates in a high school teen-comedy but she works for AHS"

AmericanHorrorStory,2tsmbv,luxlisbon_,15,Tue Jan 27 06:14:19 2015 UTC,The problem is that bit of casting is enough to get me to want to watch the pilot at least. I feel like Murphy knows hard core horror fans have a deep love for Curtis in the genre and he's abusing that.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tqdp8,Swamster,7,Mon Jan 26 20:46:20 2015 UTC,"Season 15, Episode 5. It's on Netflix!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqdp8,megapewpie,4,Mon Jan 26 21:46:13 2015 UTC,I just saw this too and got way too excited seeing him. I thought about posting it here but really who HASN'T been on SVU?
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqdp8,Bailey3475,2,Tue Jan 27 02:57:49 2015 UTC,No kidding. The other day I was going wait they were on OITNB and they were on AHS they were on....   Six degrees of separation with SVU is more like 3  *edit due to terrible autocorrect and lack of proof reading
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqdp8,islandeyes,3,Tue Jan 27 14:48:27 2015 UTC,I love his disposition in this episode...... I love him in general.

AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,TyGunth,48,Tue Jan 27 05:55:15 2015 UTC,Everyone complains about the most recent season. When 5 gets here everyone will complain and say it's nowhere near as good as 4
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,abradolph,21,Tue Jan 27 07:32:56 2015 UTC,"I've found that a lot of people hated season 4 because it didn't have a strong central driving plot and was more just vignettes week to week about the Freak Show and those connected to it.  Also, I know I'll get downvoted to filth, but the show picked up a lot of younger female and gay male fans during Coven who weren't necessarily into the horror genre and they seemed disappointed that it was a little darker and less bitchy/funny/fabulous in tone."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,grumblebuzz,4,Tue Jan 27 14:25:00 2015 UTC,Dude I made that same comment as you about Coven picking up gay/young female viewers and I got downvoted into oblivion. I'm glad I'm not the only person that felt that way. (And I'm gay myself).
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,OvernightSiren,3,Wed Jan 28 08:32:51 2015 UTC,"I was getting downvoted too until I edited my post and added the ""who weren't necessarily into the horror genre"" part.  People accuse you of generalizing if you don't break it down to the smallest denominator possible. As a gay guy myself, all I know is that last year all my gay and younger female friends on social media were constantly posting ""On Wednesdays we wear black!"", ""Surprise bitch!"", ""I'm the next supreme!"" over and over, but this year they were ""Attending the Freak Show!"" for about 3 episodes and then the posts stopped and the complaints started: ""I don't like it this year. It's not fun like Coven was."", ""I miss Coven!"", etc."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,grumblebuzz,1 point,Wed Jan 28 14:03:41 2015 UTC,"I thought Coven was much darker than Freak Show. Madison and Fiona were utterly ruthless, cold killing murderers who were also somewhat normal people. Dandy was more messed up than both of them, but it for some reason wasn't as horrifying as Madison or Fiona, at least to me. Maybe I'm just weird but there was something about Madison guzzling down drugs, murdering people, putting Kyle back together as her personal sex toy, and all the other crazy shit. And when she had her monologue, everything just hit really hard."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,kenbrellfan,3,Tue Jan 27 19:38:35 2015 UTC,"Coven's darkness was always done with a wink though.  It was black comedy, even in its most serious moments. Freak show was more tragic in tone and without much of the comedy element. Sure, Dandy or Desiree might make you chuckle at a line here or there, but the tone of that series wasn't meant to be funny."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,grumblebuzz,10,Wed Jan 28 14:07:06 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the first season was the best, but the fourth is a close second. I like what they did with the Freakshow. I thought season two and three were ok and I only watched them because I'm a fan of the show and the actors. I just wish Frances conroy would start playing larger roles..."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,Brass_Gears,3,Tue Jan 27 06:04:25 2015 UTC,Asylum and Freakshow seem to be the most polarizing seasons.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,nastylep,9,Tue Jan 27 15:38:48 2015 UTC,"I think 3 & 4 were both relatively poorly done, personally.  Coven did not hook me in nearly the same way Asylum & Murder House did. It seemed like they tried to expand their audience by pandering with a ""tweeny"" dynamic, to me. It was not scary at all.   Freakshow, I thought was poor for different reasons. Most of which have been said on other threads. Too much that did not make sense. Too many characters just thrown into the pot without being properly concluded. Too many loose ends. Seemed like poor/lazy writing."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,nastylep,1 point,Tue Jan 27 15:34:00 2015 UTC,I feel the same way.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,Riekopo,6,Tue Jan 27 17:48:23 2015 UTC,"The same thing was happening to me with Coven. I always used to say it was the worst of the 4 yadda yadda yadda, but when watching Freak Show (episode 6 and beyond) I noticed I got distracted easily, started using my phone, talking with those around me, etc. and really it didn't matter because I didn't miss anything too important or awesome. Yesterday I started rewatching Coven and I'm asking myself why did I think it was bad. I'm loving it! Fiona's badassery, Queenie keepin' it real every now and then, and Madison's straight up bitchiness is great! fuck Zoe, she's a whale dong, but yeah so far I like it! The only thing I really didn't like was the cliché zombie chainsaw bloodfest, but overall it's really entertaining and touches a real dark theme! While Murder House is personally my favorite season by far, Asylum and Coven are the darker of the four, with Freakshow being ironically the least entertaining (except Dandy, his character & portrayal is unreal)  tl;dr:   S1 > S2><S3 > S4"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,noel-13,5,Tue Jan 27 12:29:35 2015 UTC,"For me, I enjoyed Coven the least. It was entertaining and I liked the story but this is American HORROR Story and I was never scared for the characters. I felt like there was nothing at stake."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,fshklr1,6,Tue Jan 27 14:02:07 2015 UTC,"I have only seen season one and Freakshow. With Murder House, I couldn't wait to start the next episode. I didn't have that this season. I watched it just to finish it. I didn't feel that there was a direction or plot to this season."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,Bruce-Vain,3,Tue Jan 27 16:18:08 2015 UTC,"That's probably my biggest complaint as well: Freak Show is totally aimless.  Swerving from subplot to subplot, only occasionally connecting,  plots of varying quality and concern, and (worst of all) having major characters pretty much disappear for long stretches of time.    I blame it on bad editing; this season wanted to have it's cake and it too without any concern as to whether the whole thing was baked through or the layers were evenly frosted. (/cake metaphors)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,fantasmas05,2,Tue Jan 27 20:07:00 2015 UTC,"Same here, after about 5 episodes I was in no rush  to watch the next one. Often would leave it for days."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,babyvomit,2,Wed Jan 28 03:28:54 2015 UTC,Definitely check out season 2. You'll love it as much or more than Murder House.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,OvernightSiren,2,Tue Jan 27 18:30:17 2015 UTC,"""Serial killer on the loose? Not to worry, they're witches""....well, in season 4 it was ""Serial killer on the loose? Oh he can just conveniently and un-believably buy out the cops with a single sentence and then not have any risk of being caught all season"". Every single character in Freak Show made one unbelievable decision after another, plot lines were thrown at us and abandoned at the drop of a hat, there wasn't a single thread that ran through the season as the end goal (at least Coven had ""who will be the supreme?"")."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,Ehlak,2,Wed Jan 28 08:31:57 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I think Coven had a better story, but I don't think it was AHS-like material"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,cakepurge51,2,Wed Jan 28 14:06:24 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed this season. It still doesn't come close to S1, but S3 was by far the worst in my book.  My personal ranking goes: S1 > S4 > S2 > S3"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,BionicFunhouse,1 point,Tue Jan 27 07:59:19 2015 UTC,"My opinion was the character development came much too slow, I wasn't left feeling complete horror at the end as much as the other seasons. I never was able to really attach a feeling to any certain characters, but I'm guessing that's because so many were involved. It just felt cold and distant the whole time. I did feel something at the end, though.  I honestly think the only episode in this season that actually honored the original feeling of AHS is Episode 10: ""Orphans"" It had a perfect mix of cleverness, twists, a feeling of absolute sorrow and horror at what happens throughout the whole episode. Maybe it's because it honored two former episodes from my favorite season, being Asylum. Just my opinion though! I'd like to hear about other people's opinion on what made this season great."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,ssj2preston,1 point,Tue Jan 27 20:59:23 2015 UTC,"Well a lot of people have different opinions. Coven is actually my favorite, and Freakshow is third right after Asylum but I still really enjoy it.  Also, because the seasons are spread out over two months, it gets people to lose interest and hype for them."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,Re-toast,1 point,Tue Jan 27 23:18:33 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed Coven. Great story, compelling characters. It just didn't get me to fear for the characters lives, considering they could be brought back to life and that they all have powers anyway."
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,castro1987,1 point,Tue Jan 27 23:31:01 2015 UTC,"It's just that american horror story starts so strong but finishes weak like coven. I agree it has to go back to being darker like asylum and murder house, less humor like stated above. That being said its still a fun time throughout the season and the Halloween episodes are always great"
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,CustosClavium,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:31:56 2015 UTC,I loved this season. The acting was great imo. Unlike 3 were the acting got pretty bad. Dandys character was amazing. The actor who played him got that role perfectly.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,SGT_BUTTSTICK,1 point,Fri Jan 30 09:13:40 2015 UTC,Season went down hill fast around the time ma petite died.
AmericanHorrorStory,2ttagn,monkeysrule123,1 point,Fri Jan 30 16:02:12 2015 UTC,"I just can't get into the whole sideshow thing. I couldn't help but let this season remind me of all the high school juggalos I went to school with who were obsessed with being freaks and going with that whole spooky circus freak theme in fashion and accessories (only with the attitude of a drooling idiot, unlike the show). I like to imagine a room full of juggalos chugging Faygo and smoking meth during the opening credit music like ""Aw yeah dawg, dis is my shit!""  It was hard for me to get over that to then get into the show. But I liked the 4th season. I won't be re-watching it like I have Murder House and Asylum, though. Might give Coven a second watch...maybe."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,islandeyes,73,Mon Jan 26 18:17:56 2015 UTC,"You know why I loved Coven? The setting (pristine white house in New Orleans), the outfits (black, so much black!), the music (those haunting but also slightly plucky female vocals), Myrtle Snow. Coven was probably the weakest in terms of horror, but I think a lot of its good points get overlooked.  Frankly I think the worst part was the bizarre shoehorning-in of Stevie Nicks."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,rosylux,18,Mon Jan 26 20:15:45 2015 UTC,I loved the scenery and costumes contrasting so much. I looooved it. It was seriously perfect. It had a modern day witchy feel to it.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,The_mrs,9,Mon Jan 26 21:19:01 2015 UTC,Yeah but without that we wouldn't have known eminem was a witch.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,_Lady_Deadpool_,0,Mon Jan 26 23:24:49 2015 UTC,Wizard?
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,The_mrs,4,Tue Jan 27 06:24:50 2015 UTC,"Coulda been warlock even, but the guy on the council was never called anything different, was he?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,KingWormKilroy,7,Tue Jan 27 14:04:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I didn't understand that at all.  Does Stevie Nicks have anything to do with witches?  Did she write a song about them or something?  I'm just ignorant as to what the connection is.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,mrignatiusjreily,32,Mon Jan 26 21:09:56 2015 UTC,"Stevie Nicks has been accused of being a witch since the 80s.   She fought those rumors very hard. They put her on the show as an actual witch(Misty claimed her music is magic that speaks to all witches, and she apparently has telekinesis, the way she  closes the door behind her in the Finale opening). Fiona brought her there to inspire Misty to compete in the Seven Wonders test, since she was hesitant to try it before.  It made sense plot wise, but was ultimately a funny tongue-in-cheek wink to fans who remember the real witch accusations Stevie faced back in the day."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,mrignatiusjreily,2,Mon Jan 26 21:30:02 2015 UTC,"That's why I said her appearance was a clever wink to people who really knew their Stevie trivia. Coven was watched by everyone, not just teenage tumblr users. People say that just because they hate Coven for being the most watched season so far. The whole Stevie Nicks influence on the whole season drew in Fleetwood Mac fans of all ages. My friend's mom started watching Coven just because of Sara (her favorite song ) playing in episode  3 and Misty going on and on about Stevie."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,MatchEntry,1 point,Tue Jan 27 11:57:47 2015 UTC,"they knew her as ""that chick from american idol""  and yeah, Stevie Nicks is incredibly witchy and is a big idol to a lot of chicks that want to be ""pagan"""
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,SimeonsDilemma,6,Tue Jan 27 16:13:47 2015 UTC,"There have, for many years now, been rumors/accusations that Stevie Nicks is a witch. They definitely could have left her out of the season though."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,Kendow,9,Tue Jan 27 23:38:23 2015 UTC,"No, I didn't get it either. I liked it that misty was obsessed with her, I thought that was really cute and definitely a character trait that a lot of people can relate to, passionately loving a celebrity, but her coming in was just strange to me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,lsirius,24,Mon Jan 26 21:22:58 2015 UTC,"Loved coven for it's campy-ness, humor and wit. Hardly any horror but definitely a fun watch. The story could have been better (strong start, weak finish)."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,deliaaaaaa,10,Mon Jan 26 21:20:18 2015 UTC,"I just finished Coven, like literally 30 mins ago, and I didn't have high hopes because of seeing how much yall didn't like it.  I liked it a lot though, and also didn't care for Asylum. I think if you're doing a lot of discussing about a show while it's going on, it takes some of the surprise and fun away from it.   I heard yall say that the story line was convoluted, but I disagree. I mean, yeah we all have like 6/7 powers at the end but sometimes witches get extra in times of great stress.  So, yeah, it was fine with me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,Skellynelly,9,Mon Jan 26 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"I loved Coven as well.   I loved how true it was to the feel of being in New Orleans, surrounded by so much magic and so many dark pasts.  I loved the usage of so much real NOLA history mixed in with the fictional story.  I didn't see very many plot holes or inconsistencies that everyone is always complaining about (at least no more than were in the 1st or 2nd seasons). The story made sense to me and I even loved how they ended it.  Maybe it helps that I never found AHS to be ""scary"" so I don't expect that from any season.   It's always been horror/comedy in my eyes."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,Teaas,4,Tue Jan 27 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"Some of the imagery is pretty creepy, but I agree with this entirely!"

AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,MatchEntry,8,Tue Jan 27 17:32:55 2015 UTC,"I hated Coven at first because I loved Asylum and saw season 3 as pandering to the Twilight demographic, but in retrospect it really wasn't any worse than the other seasons, just the same fun campy horror.  It took me a little while to come around, but I totally admit that Angela Bassett and Kathy Bates nailed it and were a real treat to watch.  I also really dug the voodoo dude's style and associated cinematography, use of shadows, etc..."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,daryldickin,10,Mon Jan 26 23:19:32 2015 UTC,"Jessica Lange was much better in Coven than she was in Freakshow, for me at least."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,DanElHombre,5,Mon Jan 26 21:15:56 2015 UTC,Kathy Bates being cast was a bit shocking for me and at first I think I was annoyed with her character but I actually came to really love her and I think she genuinely cared for the girls.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,nmoline,6,Tue Jan 27 00:23:29 2015 UTC,"I love it. It is a different kind of horror. Campy, over the top.   It even references Evil Dead in the way Zoe goes crazy with the chainsaw. Evil Dead is the pinnacle of campy horror.   Coven is a gay man's wet dream"

AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,RestrictedAxcess,10,Mon Jan 26 18:42:45 2015 UTC,Asylum was by far the weakest season. Too many convoluted plot lines all over the place and half of them didn't go anywhere interesting.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,chattypenguin,17,Mon Jan 26 20:30:08 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone who ranks Asylum as my third favorite season, I'll tell you what I liked about it.   I really felt for the characters. Kit, Lana, and Grace especially. They were written in such a way that made me emotionally attached to them. I still think Murder House did that better, but Asylum did do it very well. I thought the Thredson/Bloody Face twist was one of the best I've ever seen in television. Zachary Quinto was so good, probably my favorite performance in any season of AHS."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,Doctor_Arkham,7,Mon Jan 26 20:38:18 2015 UTC,"Seriously, couldn't look away during any scene with Zachary Quinto."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,Notwhatitlookslike22,12,Mon Jan 26 20:55:04 2015 UTC,"Asylum is my favorite season and I really didn't like the Sister Mary Eunice subplot. I'll admit, the whole thing about the aliens was really weird and probably not needed, but besides that, I thought it was amazing. Mostly, I was actually scared of Bloody Face. He felt like such a ""real"" killer (y'know, 80s slasher) that I was scared for Lana. It just had a very dark tone to the series while still being very grounded in reality (as in, I can believe Lana gets trapped and no one cares for her/ Kit gets framed for murders he didn't commit)."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,mrignatiusjreily,2,Mon Jan 26 21:10:47 2015 UTC,Yeah Sister Mary Eunice is literally the whole season for me.

You can't just make this statement without first saying ""In my opinion,"" or at most, say it in a way in which it doesn't sound like you're saying it as a fact. I say this because I just realized it wasn't the opinion that pissed me off, it was how you said it.   Just replace the words with something else.  ""Obama was by far the worst president. To many policies and speeches.""   or  ""Soccer/football is by far the worst sport. Too much kicking and time on the clock.""

If you say Asylum is your least favorite, prepare for at least 6 responses from fans demanding an explanation on how someone could possibly hate it.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,mistar_z,1 point,Tue Jan 27 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"I like all the seasons so far, but I can see how some people wouldn't care for certain seasons. To me, each season being so drastically different from one another is a good thing. It shows that the writers of this show have a bigger palette for horror than us, something I feel we take for granted."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,_Lady_Deadpool_,7,Wed Jan 28 23:45:27 2015 UTC,yup me too!!  asylum is my least favorite season!!
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,MatchEntry,9,Thu Jan 29 05:32:23 2015 UTC,I don't think slavery is a controversial issue. And without Delphine there would have been almost no horror during coven.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,MC_Carty,3,Tue Jan 27 01:09:35 2015 UTC,"I don't say it was controversial in a bad way, but that's what AHS is known for, really. Seeing how far they can push the boundaries of whats okay to show on tv. And in a lot of ways, the torture scenes could be viewed as controversial."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,xoticrox,3,Mon Jan 26 18:23:35 2015 UTC,"AHS hardly pushes the limits of what can be shown on television. Tons of shows have featured far more graphic depictions of violence, incest, discrimination, etc."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,RestrictedAxcess,6,Mon Jan 26 21:23:24 2015 UTC,AHS is a prime time show on a major network. There is a huge difference between what can be shown on syfy and what can by shown on FX. The demographic is different for different networks.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,drewcarreybitch,6,Mon Jan 26 22:23:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I don't think that they REALLY push it but for the network, its definitely breaking some boundaries.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tqsqv,ChildishElephants,3,Tue Jan 27 12:22:08 2015 UTC,"I loved coven - not so much as a ""horror"" show but more of a ""superpowers"" show with horror aspects, if that makes any sense. A bit like xmen with voodoo, and I liked the whole seven wonders and eye gouging and burning thing.   Murder house was by far the best and most refined. I can't say I'm too much a fan of asylum. Freak show I'm eh on, the story is really weak with it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,DanMcMissile,2,Tue Jan 27 02:19:58 2015 UTC,"it's like in buddhism, trying to appreciate the present because the past is over and the future is unprocessed.  Elsa spent so much time focused on her future stardom she didn't get to enjoy her time with her real family- the freaks.  I think it was playing on the idea that the afterlife is a ""coming home,"" and we saw where elsa's true home was"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,MatchEntry,10,Tue Jan 27 02:42:50 2015 UTC,"Well she was very selfish even willing to kill and person like that would deserve a punishment. But: 1. Her life was a punishment itself 2. She didn't actually kill anybody who didn't deserve it as far as I can remember (She did kill Ethel, but it was in self defense and Ethel wanted to kill her for something she didn't do) 3. Elsa really did save many of her ""Freaks"".She really did love them, she just loved herself more. Especially touching is Pepper's backstory where Elsa gave her everything she wanted (family, child, husband)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,Behe464,3,Tue Jan 27 23:58:02 2015 UTC,"That's true, I had almost forgotten why Ethel tried to kill Elsa, it feels like so long ago haha. These are some really great points!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,MatchEntry,2,Tue Jan 27 03:46:40 2015 UTC,She was just really Machiavellian
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,RogueVenus,10,Tue Jan 27 05:54:28 2015 UTC,"I think that her character was so much more complex than she's given credit for.  She had severe trauma, fell in love with the man who saved her, and then he LEFT.  In my mind, this led to a woman who wanted to be loved, but didn't want to give anyone a chance to love her back in case they chose to leave.  I think she truly had affection for her freaks, but also had these emotional scars that led her to build up ridiculous walls and force people away - She was the kind of person to hurt someone before they had the chance to hurt her.   Ever with poor Pepper, she loved Pepper - But when Salty died, I felt that she came to the realization that Pepper wasn't going to live a long life, and therefore had to send her away before she died and left her hurt.  And so, in the end, sending her to heaven, with those she loves, in a place where no one can leave, seems kind of sweet and fitting.  OF COURSE, I could be an optimist. OR, I could be projecting my own trust issues onto the character."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,MatchEntry,-1,Tue Jan 27 23:58:55 2015 UTC,read about borderline personality disorder- Elsa was the total textbook case.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,theactualstephers,9,Tue Jan 27 06:09:22 2015 UTC,"I do not think she should have gone to freak ""heaven"" it should have had a twist like when the curtain opened for her show the whole audience just laughs at her and throws stuff at her. It would be her own version of hell every night. I just don't like that she was two faced to the freaks, all she cared about was her self."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,absurdistance,3,Tue Jan 27 23:59:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with what's already been said, that really she was vain, and with Ethel it was just self-defense. Paul is a different story, but I found that entire arc to be uninteresting and out of character for both Paul and Elsa.  All that aside, I'd like to point out an interesting parallel between Fiona Goode and Elsa Mars. Fiona was a very bad person who, in the end, repented and was willing to confront her wrongs and reap what she had sown, and even then, she was cast to her own hell. Elsa Mars was also a pretty bad person, but she never confronted her wrongs. She ran away constantly, until finally she ran away from life, and SHE was sent to a personal heaven. This, along with Jude Martin's interactions with the aliens and Shacath set up an interesting (and very specific) motif, where [Lange], after much physical and emotional turmoil, finally resigns to her own demise, and is taken away by [supernatural being]. You could probably also set this up with Constance and the anti-Christ but I won't go into that."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,Oddbaugh,3,Tue Jan 27 12:18:00 2015 UTC,"I think she cared very deeply for her monsters. She had to kill Ethel because Ethel was going to kill her, she killed dell because he killed her favorite, and she sold the freaks to dandy, but only after finding out that they were all turning on her. She has her faults, but I don't think she's any worse of a person than the rest of the freaks. (Other than the pure pinheads and ma petite. Ma petite was a little angel.)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,Riekopo,3,Tue Jan 27 05:17:59 2015 UTC,I don't understand why she was let off the hook and rewarded in the end. She did horrible things and deserved to be punished.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,MatchEntry,2,Tue Jan 27 05:34:27 2015 UTC,"I think she was punished enough in life- she got the thing she was hustling so hard for (being a star) but honestly it sucked- her marriage sucked, doing commercials sucked, she seemed really lonely and over all of it, drinking really heavily and being a huge cranky bitch.  I feel like by the time she died she'd been punished enough and learned her lesson.  to contrast, and bring in a reply further down, Fiona only really surrendered when she had absolutely no other choice and it never seemed to me that she was very sorry for all the awful things she had done including lying to her daughter's face and telling some voodoo deity that she'd cripple her daughter for immortality."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,baileath,1 point,Tue Jan 27 17:45:36 2015 UTC,"I think it leaned a little too far into the cliche happy ending department.  I loved the character of Elsa- genuinely loves the freaks, but can't ignore her ambitions to become a star- but to me the ending should have been more ambiguous to fit an ambiguous character.  I felt like she got her ultimate wish and gets to reap the benefit for all of eternity, though people have posted things to make it seem like it isn't really a ""heaven"""
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,grumblebuzz,1 point,Wed Jan 28 00:06:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think Elsa was ""evil"" really, just selfish and delusional.  Yes, she killed Ethel but she did it in self defense and I do think her big wailing, sobbing ""I COULD HAVE HELPED YOU!"" production out at the faked car crash site had some truth and real emotion in it.  As for selling the twins and injuring Paul, that's where her self-centered nature came into play; she didn't want to be upstaged by the twins on stage or Penny in the bed, so she lashed out. I feel that Elsa paid for the crummy things she did and that she did love the freaks in her own way."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tslwd,MatchEntry,1 point,Tue Jan 27 03:40:05 2015 UTC,Pink Cupcakes' only high point (for me) was elsa coming out of her tent to Bowie's Fame and seeing the twins leave with Stanley.  The song totally fit because of Elsa's fame obsession and that triggered her to sell the twins which led to the freaks turning on her and Elsa losing the closest thing to family she knew
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,maemoon,18,Tue Jan 27 01:47:04 2015 UTC,"What I noticed when I re-watched Murder House is that the season takes one horror trope and runs with it.  Subsequent seasons haven't had quite the focus.   Also, I feel like it is more gritty than the rest (except for maybe Asylum).  Murder House deals with affairs, abortion, and school shootings (among others) which all seem to be a distinct part of our current American society (just look at the news). These are all very real and current things to us as a society."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,BathtimeSharkFriend,31,Tue Jan 27 06:37:18 2015 UTC,"While Freak Show and Murder House had a similarly big cast (the ghosts & the freaks), what I really liked about Murder House where the flashbacks detailing the ghosts background before each intro. The Black Dahlia, The Montgomerys, etc. But hey, that's just me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,noel-13,9,Tue Jan 27 02:45:39 2015 UTC,I liked that a lot too.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,cocobeannns,7,Tue Jan 27 03:07:36 2015 UTC,"I love murder house. It's by far my favorite season, and part of that is everybody's story through out time ( I'm a total history buff).  So far it's the only season I've really enjoyed, all the way through, every single episode, and I do think that every major characters story being explained helped make it a better season. I kinda think that's part of the reason I've maybe not liked other seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,mysterynmayhem,4,Tue Jan 27 03:10:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. The plot in the first season was much more cohesive and well thought out. Although I enjoyed the last three seasons, they just sort of feel as if they were written as they went along without much forethought as to how all the loose ends would be tied up. I didn't really identify with any of the characters or understand their motivations in the others quite like I did in murder house."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,THEDUDE33,9,Tue Jan 27 06:33:51 2015 UTC,"Murder House uses traditional horror techniques and not much more than that. Asylum was more of a psychological horror. Coven was hardly a horror, but was closer to what people usually watch on TV (more comedy, not much weird shit). Freak Show is Freak Show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,BionicFunhouse,11,Tue Jan 27 02:28:23 2015 UTC,Coven is a black comedy. Pretty well executed IMO.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,Soperos,1 point,Tue Jan 27 05:38:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree, but I'm open minded. Can you explain how it was a comedy? I like black comedies but this wasn't funny at all."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,BionicFunhouse,6,Tue Jan 27 20:19:29 2015 UTC,"'It's a black comedy because it follows large pattern in that genre. Such as:  Taboo subjects turned into a funny aspect: Making light of taboo and serious subjects, such as death, rape, slavery, murder, and racism.  Fatalism: Coven had a domino effect in its story structure. Kyle dies and his body is brought  to the morgue near Misty's cabin. Zoe and Madison bring Kyle back and Zoe meets Misty through Kyle. Madison is killed, her corpse later found in terrible condition but luckily Zoe now has a friend who can bring back the dead.   Extreme or cosmic irony: Fiona is facing death no matter what but is forced  to watched her clumsy young competition, enemies (Marie), and other random people (Delphine, Joan and Kyle) cheat death with relative ease.  The real problem with Coven is that people see it as not as meaningful as the first two seasons because of how silly it seems on the surface due to it's comedic overtones and snappy dialogue, but I think it's just as thought-provoking. A lot of people still didn't get what the story was really about in the first place,  so, at best, they'll say it's a dumb story that at least has funny moments to make it ""watchable"".'   -/u/mrignatiusjreily  Just saw this in another thread, and I thought it was a great explanation. ALSO, all those hilarious and snarky one liners"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,Soperos,-2,Tue Jan 27 23:08:51 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the well thought of response, although I still don't see it as a comedy personally, I respect and do not disagree the individual points.   They have had one liners in every season though, if you go back and look for them specifically you will see them."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,grumblebuzz,1 point,Wed Jan 28 00:26:41 2015 UTC,"I think that must be it. It just feels so different watching it, it's like a totally different show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,littleotterpop,6,Tue Jan 27 02:41:15 2015 UTC,"Both Murder House and Asylum truly do feel like stand-alone series with completely different themes, character types and general tones; however, Coven and Freak Show share similar DNA as far as character types and storytelling go.  I hope with season 5 we get some new writers and hopefully a lot of different actors in there as well to return us to that ""different year, completely different story"" feel of the first two seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,Riekopo,4,Tue Jan 27 16:43:14 2015 UTC,I love murder house. I could rewatch it a million times and still enjoy it thoroughly.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,xxgothicxx95,5,Tue Jan 27 12:09:10 2015 UTC,Season 1 was the best in my opinion.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,akellar,5,Tue Jan 27 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"I feel that Murder House was a much safer season in that it did not have as much gore and horror as we have become accustomed to in later seasons. You must remember that Murder House was the first season and so perhaps the writers felt that by formulating it the way that they did, they could get a broader audience with a relatively light amount of horrific detail. I have often pondered this myself, so I'm glad others have taken my interest."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,RedditMayne,2,Wed Jan 28 00:10:57 2015 UTC,"I didn't ever realize how less gory murder house is than other season, good point! I think that's why I found it creepier, I'm so into gore and more into just weird shit."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,Soperos,6,Wed Jan 28 05:37:22 2015 UTC,Because it had an actual plot from beginning to end.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,VanDroombeeld,3,Tue Jan 27 18:29:43 2015 UTC,"In S1, the house was the main character...not the Harmons, not Tate, not Constance, etc.  In S2-S4, the asylum, mansion, and freakshow camp were merely sites where the main characters resided/interacted."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,Soperos,2,Tue Jan 27 23:50:28 2015 UTC,"Murder House had believable and relateable characters. You could almost believe that could happen (minus Infantata the stupidest part of the entire season). And instead of getting rid of the stupid stuff, and continuing to focus on real people, real struggles, and real horrors (lots of people fear ghosts, they also fear clowns which is why everyone thought ssn 4 was the best until Twisty died) they started focusing on this horror fantasy comedy bullshit that has become more prevalent since season 3.   Season 2 was similar to the 1st in terms of the realistic people, but it started going off the ledge with Satan and alien abductions, and mutants, and famous people from history, and Nazi doctors, and killer Santa's.    The show will continue to go off the rail in this direction. For many of us it's bad, but for a lot of people they prefer it. Personally, I think season 1 was the best, but sort of a fluke. I don't think the writers or the team making the show have enough talent to produce anything as good as season 1 again, especially with now 3 other shows they are using their ideas on (possibly more).   The thing about horror is you need someone ""new"" to the situation. They started that with Taissa Farmiga's character in 3, but she apparently thought everything was normal after episode 2. There were no characters like that in season 4 at all, except for Twisty's victims.   Let's not forget the mystery of season 1, similar to Lost almost in the ""what is the house, exactly?"" question. There was some of that in season 2, but not nearly as well written and preserved. Season 3 had none. Season 4, none."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tshp8,lickable_wallpaper,1 point,Tue Jan 27 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"The primary reason season one is better, is because the entire script had to be done all at once, for the network to green light it. After that, there is a very noticable messy feeling, a little incohesiveness if you will. Ryan has said they go into production, and he still has no idea where things will go. So they might have the script for the first two episodes, and they start filming, and he has no full thought out idea as to how the story will progress. He is literally making shit up as the story progresses. It happens with all his shows, and its super noticeable."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tw58o,coolcater,11,Tue Jan 27 22:29:02 2015 UTC,Amusement park would be way to similiar to Freakshow. Magic is used in coven and the whole campy amusement park carnival thing literally JUST ENDED
AmericanHorrorStory,2tw58o,monkeysrule123,3,Wed Jan 28 01:32:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting and it seems like a pretty logical route but one thing that I've heard is that they're going: present, past, present, past so the next would be present. I wonder what horror concept can be done with a modern amusement park?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tw58o,AbnormalDream,3,Tue Jan 27 22:43:07 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of amusement parks still around, but I feel like if they did go this route then they would end up following a sort of ""Night at the Museum"" kind of plot line where things come alive.

Freak show had something great going for it after the first couple episodes, with elsa's wanting to be a star and all those recurring themes of people stuck at home who are bored enough to watch a freak show being the 'real freaks', but by the second half I felt like the writers were just throwing characters in the trash finding colorful ways to kill them and then just about forgetting they even existed in the first place, it's almost like it became Falchuck and Murphy waving halloween decorations in front of the camera and going ""Oooooh!  2spooky4u!!"""

I think we all kind of wanted something even more grand in horror and scare from this season to make up for Coven but it didn't deliver that. Regardless, I rank this as my second favourite for a reason, it definitely had some great moments and made me think a lot about human nature and how people treat others. :)   Murder house Freakshow Asylum Coven"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tppwb,BellaFiat,2,Mon Jan 26 18:16:39 2015 UTC,"Murder House Asylum  Coven Freakshow   Asylum used to be last on my list.  Between demonic possessions, serial killers, aliens, Nazi's, etc.  It just seemed they were throwing everything into it and not being selective.  However, Coven had promise until the HEA ending....and Freak Show didn't seem to have much meat either and Elsa getting a HEA ending didn't seem right when she lied, cheated, and almost killed to get what she wanted.  To me, Murder House was the best.  It went back and forth in time.  It had plot, twists, freaky moments, sick moments, and freaky-sick moments that made you kinda scared because you liked them so much, and it had HORROR.  There was no HEA for Murder House, and that's how it should be IMHO."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tppwb,numb_doors,2,Mon Jan 26 20:23:43 2015 UTC,"My ranking would be   Murder House Coven Freakshow  Asylum   Asylum was the creepiest but it was sort of boring without the whole nun-satan thing. Freak show's psycho was better. Coven's witchcraft theory and characters were more fun  (sort of like Gossip Girl). Murder House is a very well rounded season. I don't really get why people love Asylum. It's alien concept was weak, the characters were weak and it's just sort of messy."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tppwb,Canines_and_Cards,2,Mon Jan 26 21:12:03 2015 UTC,"Oh god, ranking personal AHS favorites?! This is a new kind of evil....   Asylum I found this plot to be quite enjoyable. The use of aliens was questionable at first, but I thought their presence in Kit's life really shaped other characters to believe that he was crazy, and that he was a serial killer that deserved to be placed into an asylum for a while.  The theme of Questionable Sanity kept showing up throughout the season (Oliver Thredson's necrophilia and psychosis, the woman insisting to be Anne Frank, the murderous girl, Dr. Arden's lack of humanity), and I felt that was good. Murder House Slapping the haunted house trope on this season would be unwise. The use of ghosts to tie stories of past occupants was somewhat predictable, but the theme of infidelity threaded throughout the season was intriguing, to say the least. Not being able to explain the weird occurrences, as well as a resistance to, becomes Ben and Violet's downfall, and, to the audience's chagrin, a somewhat happy ending for Constance. Coven I was studying the Salem Witch Trials in my senior year of high school when I watched this season. While I understand that the central theme was supposed to be about Oppression of marginal demographics in society, I found that Coven's theme was about Corruption (Power corrupts, and absoulte power corrupts absolutely. - Lord Acton) We watch the women using their powers for their own needs (Fiona's desire to keep her Supreme privileges, Marie Laveau's punishing her enemies, the corruption of the students of the Academy).  The use of Vodou and witchcraft stood out to me. Having figures like Papa Legba and Marie Laveau made this season really memorable. Reanimation in the form of Evan Peters and Laveau's zombies was a nice touch to this season. Freak Show I got so hyped for this season, with all of these interesting concepts of anomalous, deformed, or disproportionate bodies depicted in the teasers. Then came the singing. Elsa's cover of ""Life on Mars"" and ""Gods and Monsters"" was borderline acceptable, in my opinion, because I had already heard ""The Name Game"" by Lange.  Having Evan Peters and Sarah Paulson sing may have been appealing to some, but during those scenes I checked my other networks to pass the scene (actually, bar Jimmy's scene, because other things were being shown during that number). Then they killed off Twisty. Right after we suffer through the tear-inducing backstory of this guy, Edward Mordrake kills him.  The psychosis starts from there on as Dandy begins to find out his inner passions of such repulsive things. Then, the writers say: ""Ah, screw this, we'll just kill all the Freaks (well, not all). In my opinion, the whole season didn't feel memorable. Besides Bette and Dot, Desiree, and Twisty, nothing else really stood out to me :/"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tppwb,bladebreakers,2,Tue Jan 27 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"I know this is somewhat of an unpopular opinion, but I think the finale was extremely underwhelming. My biggest problem with it was just how much they built up on Dandy - his evil, his insanity, everything - and I loved it, I loved him, I love Finn Wittrock, but it never really delivered. The shootings all just seemed predictable and an easy cop-out to get rid of a whole bunch of characters. Dandy's death (if they absolutely had to go that route) could have been done much, much better. In fact, if punishment for his actions was the goal, he deserved far more agony that he got, and maybe they could have done something interesting there.  Plus, as much as I liked Chester and as much as I love NPH, I don't see what his character had anything to do with...well, anything."

Even now, I feel like they're both great and both deserve Number 1. But I also know that's not the most popular opinion around here. I just really like the characters and all of the storylines. despite being EVERYWHERE, had really great resolution. I cared about the character's that were still alive after Dandy's Rampage.  I also am a big book reader and loved The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and the movie was a big inspiration for me to get my life together, due in part to that song. The day of the finale I was talking to my friend and I said, ""There's going to be another song, it has to happen."" He said that it'll be Dandy's Swan Song, because he had yet to sing one.   But never in my weirdest theories would I have thought they'd have Jessica Lange do a cover of Heroes. It was her swan song and it felt like it was resounding through all four seasons where all of those characters were the underdog and it was a great wrap up for the Era of Lange. The end of Elsa's Story helped me realize that Jessica Lange is gonna be gone, and that's ok."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tnjfw,13thestrals,3,Mon Jan 26 02:47:41 2015 UTC,"She has stated before that the voice she uses in interviews is a higher pitch than her natural voice. She alters her voice and speaks almost in falsetto to protect it. Of course, that probably means she would be likely to use that voice while acting as well."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnjfw,andrewm4930,1 point,Mon Jan 26 13:56:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, OK then. Because when I hear people say they hate her speaking voice, they normally mean her voice from the TV show."

I know that a lot of people don't like Coven, but I really hope that Murphy tries to take this series in that direction. I would consider Coven to be a horror-comedy, personally. It had the best one-liners of any AHS season. My ultimate wish is that RM uses Scream Queens as his outlet to write that kind of comedy-horror so that we can leave the true horror to AHS.   As for the cast, some excite me and some I'm indifferent towards. Hopefully some other good actors get added!"

That was my first thought! Coven was not well received, by most counts, and Freak Show moved us back towards a darker tone. I'm hoping he uses Scream Queens to enjoy his Horror-comedy side, and keeps the really fucked up stuff on AHS.  On the other hand, jesus Murphy, three anthology shows at once?"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnjfw,suppositoryofwisdom,2,Mon Jan 26 08:45:09 2015 UTC,"I think anthologies are best for Murphy because, IMO, in his other series it starts getting very tired after a few seasons. This way he can keep things fresh!"

AmericanHorrorStory,2tnjfw,gartertrap,6,Sun Jan 25 23:46:02 2015 UTC,I think she'd be spectacular in AHS and for that matter her husband could also be very good. They're super new York though so you'd have to find the right parts for them.

I love that clip of her being given the total brush off by jessica lange at the freak show premiere ( she tried to say hi and jessica just compleley ignored her!)

I've no idea who Ariana Grande is so I've no idea what all the hate is about, but I'll be going into it without bias so, I'm cool with that. I'm excited for Jamie Lee Curtis and Joe Manganiello, I couldn't care less about Emma Roberts though, she was kind of boring in Freak Show (that's probably the fault of the writers though) and too bitchy-stereotype in Coven for me to care for her either way. I have no idea who the rest of the actors are, but I want to say Glee cast members? They kinda look it."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnjfw,drunkwithlust,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:37:42 2015 UTC,"Lea Michele was the lead in Glee for a while. I watched seasons one and most of two before I got sick of it. Her character was sooo annoying to me, but I've not seen her in anything else so I don't know if she's just a really good actress or if her Glee character is the whole annoying package. I'm definitely interested to see what RM writes for her!  Abigail Breslin was the little girl in Little Miss Sunshine, if you've ever seen that (highly recommend if you havent!) I'm sure she's done more than that but LMS is what I know her from. Keke Palmer was a Nickelodeon (I think?) star when she was younger, but I've never seen any of her work so I'm indifferent towards her.   To be totally honest all I know of Ariana Grande is her music, which isn't to my taste. I have no clue how she is as an actress. Other than that all I know of her is her absolutely terrible older brother because he was on this past season of Big Brother US (it's my number one guilty pleasure in the summer... no judgement pls) and he was all-around grotesque. Granted, that has little to nothing to actually do with her, but it (admittedly, unfairly) makes me like her less."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnjfw,drunkwithlust,1 point,Mon Jan 26 00:50:11 2015 UTC,"Ariana is actually a pretty good actor, the annoying roles she plays are completely different from how she actually is (I've met her before) but I'm not quite sure how she'll do in a more serious/horror role. Her brother is annoying as hell though and I'm not sure why she likes to keep him around when it's very obvious he's using her for her fame. I can't stand the guy"

AmericanHorrorStory,2tnjfw,rosylux,12,Tue Jan 27 00:23:16 2015 UTC,"Before glee she originated a very interesting and complex character in spring awakening on Broadway. I think she can be good, if she can get over herself and just act"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnjfw,jenandthemisfits,4,Fri Jan 30 07:21:32 2015 UTC,"She's great on stage, not so much on screen. It's like she can't tone her theatrics down, and you just don't need that on TV. Performances have to be way more nuanced. I'm not optimistic about this at all :("
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnjfw,SayceGards,2,Mon Jan 26 00:46:42 2015 UTC,"Glee is all about over the top theatrics, especially the character she plays. What are you judging her screen acting skill on side from glee? I thought she did really well as the voice for Dorothy and in the New Year's Eve movie... I am super interested to see how she handles it. This is very different from anything we've seen her do thus far."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnjfw,aymalah,2,Mon Jan 26 02:41:54 2015 UTC,"This! I think people judge her based on Rachel Berry whose character is over the top, dramatic, selfish, and annoying. Doesn't exactly mean she's like that in real life. I'm pretty excited to see her in a more serious role"

People are upset over Ariana Grande and granted I have no clue who she is but if this show is true to the scream queen formula of the horror genre, she's gonna fit in perfectly.   Think about a movie like say Black Christmas.  You have an older female in a maternal/authority role, hot young coeds, a deranged killer and lots of screaming.   It's gonna be good."

They could split it up between earth and space, sure, but I'd rather not see aliens again this soon. They were one of my favorite parts of Asylum,  and I'm afraid they're serious about making a shared universe and I like the aliens as the mysterious god-like beings that they were."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tpwu3,Bruce-Vain,3,Tue Jan 27 18:18:34 2015 UTC,"That's been the argument against space yeah (American Horror Story), I think Murphy himself said it when the Space rumour took off too (though I suppose it could work if it was only party in Space or was on a US ship/space station, just for arguments sake. Though that would stray from horror with sci-fi elements to full on sci-fi imo and it's not American Science Fiction Story). It doesn't put the kibosh on Aliens though. I don't know how I feel tbh, I started watching half way through Asylum and am magic obsessed so Coven sounded awesome but Freak Show sounded awful to me as a concept but I still enjoyed it. I'll still watch no matter what it ends up being and shall hopefully enjoy it.   Oh and side note, you're the first person I've seen on this board who didn't hate the aliens in Asylum. Asylum is still my absolute favourite season but I don't feel strongly either way on the aliens, people here do though apparently lol."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tpwu3,Lyco_499,3,Wed Jan 28 17:11:12 2015 UTC,"I love the aliens! They contrast perfectly with the religious characters as very involved givers and takers of life. They weren't overused or underused (Mordrake was VERY underused). Plus at the end, when they take Kit at the end of his life is possibly the most beautiful moment in all of AHS."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tpwu3,Bruce-Vain,2,Wed Jan 28 23:15:24 2015 UTC,"Oh, so it's gonna be set in present day. Well, I wonder how the Op Top Hat spec is gonna fit into this time period."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tpwu3,Canines_and_Cards,2,Mon Jan 26 23:40:24 2015 UTC,"They often do more than one time period though. Murder House had flashes back to various periods, Asylum was the 60's and present day, Coven was present day amd the 1800's, Freak show was the 50's with a little 40's and 60's.  If they are doing Op Top Hat, it could relate to something happening in ths present and do flash backs."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tpwu3,Lyco_499,1 point,Wed Jan 28 17:03:31 2015 UTC,She seems like a fun person to be with. Haha! I love her!
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,muststayawaketoread,12,Mon Jan 26 00:25:43 2015 UTC,She is going to be in the second half of the walking dead season 5 so if her character lives in to season 6 she may not return.
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,lurkingphoenix,1 point,Mon Jan 26 01:37:49 2015 UTC,Minor spoiler  Her character doesn't become part of the main cast. She's done either at the end of season 5 or the very beginning of 6. So she could come back to AHS.
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,tierillo,3,Mon Jan 26 04:02:15 2015 UTC,"Um it says that Alex's role is recurring in season 5 with an option to be a regular in season 6, so if you could provide sources for the spoiler, it'd be greatly appreciated. http://screencrush.com/the-walking-dead-season-5-alexandra-breckenridge-samantha/ EDIT: why am I getting downvoted for providing a source"
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,johnny0929,-1,Mon Jan 26 04:19:17 2015 UTC,"The comic book. She's playing Jesse (they might change the name), a mother with a young son. She has a relationship with Rick but she ends up dead."
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,tierillo,7,Mon Jan 26 04:23:57 2015 UTC,"Her character's name is Samantha. It might be based on Jessie, but so what? Carol is still alive and she was dead in the comic series."

AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,Titdick_McAnusbutts,1 point,Mon Jan 26 15:30:02 2015 UTC,"I know they change some things from the comics, but Rick is a main character and keeping her alive would mess up his character arc. The link above says Samantha is a placeholder name, not her real name."
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,tierillo,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:39:21 2015 UTC,"Doesn't mean they're going to have ""Samantha"" enter a relationship with Rick. They didn't do anything between Andrea and Rick either and Andrea is dead in the show already. The comic book is just a basis and if they want Alexandra to be a series regular, they'll find a way lol. Seeing how good of an actor she is, they probably will pick her up full time. As a fan of both shows, I hope that she would be able to go on and have a larger role in Walking Dead because I feel like she's undervalued in AHS."
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,johnny0929,4,Mon Jan 26 04:43:17 2015 UTC,"I like her too, but if they use her as the character everyone thinks she's going to be, I hope they keep her ending the same. It's kind of a major moment when Rick lets go of her to save Carl and he feels guilty about it later. I just think the writing would have to get weird to keep her around. Maybe everybody's wrong and she's playing a character that's not even in the comics, but that's a long shot."

AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,rcinmd,5,Fri Jan 30 15:51:49 2015 UTC,"She played that part well. If she came back, it'd be interesting to see her play a villain."
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,BasketeerOverHere,2,Mon Jan 26 00:42:45 2015 UTC,Agreed!
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,rimjob_nazi,3,Mon Jan 26 07:52:22 2015 UTC,"She's already been back once, she was banging Cordelia's husband in S3."
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,iClubEm,2,Tue Jan 27 18:59:46 2015 UTC,Yeah but that role was too short to be satisfying for me :/
AmericanHorrorStory,2to34t,jtyler27,6,Tue Jan 27 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"Moira has been stuck in the Murder House for years and years, since she was a young adult. So any flashback would have to take place before then, and one of the showrunners said he's not 100% certain, but it's looking very likely that season 5 will take place primarily in the present day. I love her as an actress, and I would love to see her return, hopefully even as a main cast member. But I'd like them to keep Moira retired as a character. Personally, I'm not a fan of all the seasons being connected. I want them to all stay as far away from each other as possible, so even thought Moira was easily in my top five AHS characters of any season, I hope we never see her again. Her character arc already seemed well explored, and there's not much else we can get from her by bringing her back."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqmop,The_mrs,3,Mon Jan 26 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"There's definitely two sides of the story.. Kind of how someone born into a family with a present mother and a person born into a family without a mother present can never truly understand eachother, or when the person with the mother loses the mom, they don't share the same pain. Someone once had a taste of what it was like, and the other person always wondered. Kind of a confusing metaphor but that's what instantly came into my head. I think becoming a ""freak"" would be harder myself personally because you had a taste of a life of not having to deal with the problems associated with it, not everyone in the world is sympathetic or has the ability to look past physical appearances. The shock of the contrast in how people treated me and how I viewed myself would be the hardest."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqmop,jenniferamber,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:14:07 2015 UTC,"In the beginning it seemed her dad was overprotective but loving, and she was perhaps a bit of a wild child. They only reference the mother being upset when she disappeared, but since we never see the mother does that mean they weren't close? Then, even though she was the rebellious one, her father (who are supposed to love you unconditionally, went totally bat shit crazy. That I felt would be the hardest to adapt to on so many levels."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqmop,Lyco_499,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:19:31 2015 UTC,"You also have to factor in possible psychological trauma. Like if you were drugged and had your legs painfully cut off for the amusement and gratification of others. That's obviously traumatic and likely to cause emotional/psychological scars just from the event, add having to adapt to your life being forever different in many ways.   Someone like Paul, who was born with a defect (hate that word) would not have that event. But would still face similar experiences to the person who became a freak. Bullying etc. Paul would likely also struggle with blame. Blaming God, his parents, the doctors, the company that made/allowed the use of the drug that caused the deformation (a real drug btw, prescribed to stop pregnancy nausea that caused lots of awful damage)."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqmop,Lyco_499,2,Wed Jan 28 17:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yes. In his interviews, he seems fantastically well adjusted, and gives a lot of credit to his mother. I love when he said he knew he had to be really good at two things ""fighting and shagging"". (His words). Suzy is also similar in attitude in her interview. Choosing to have kids, not knowing if she would survive, living a normal life. Have you ever s en the interviews with Nadia Comaneche's legless sister who was given up for adoption and is a star gymnast? Her adoptive parents never put any limits on whatever she tried to do. On the flip side there are plenty of very bitter, angry, hate the world people in every form ( physically healthy, born with a disability, born without but developed later, etc). It almost seems to me that if you are born that way, it's all you ever know, so (and especially with supportive family) you just learn to work around it ( I think that's where the term differently abled comes from). I surely couldn't use my upperbody the way Suzy can, for example. Another point of view though would be from Erika Ervin ( Amazon Eve). She is incredibly well spoken and well educated (I know she went to law school, not sure if she ever worked as a lawyer) but when she told her family she was transitioning they told her to basically fuck off and never contact them again. Her mother had been a nurse who died from AIDS after an acciddental needle stick in the very early days of the disease, so perhaps they were bitter about the entire culture but how horrible to turn your back on someone when they need you most. She is someone who I'd expect to be angry and unhappy, but in her interviews she comes across as an amazingly well adjusted person just living her life. Now maybe she puts on a front, who knows, but she comes across very confident and together.  I suppose the moral is that it's different for everyone."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqmop,plasmaticriver,2,Wed Jan 28 17:40:37 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you, and I did love those little interviews with each of the main ""freaks"". Hearing their stories and seeing how strong they are was incredible. I have the biggest respect for them, because although they've always dealt with who and what they are, that doesn't always make someone a good person.  A friend used to work in a care home and the amount of people (ranging from young to old, minorly to majorly mentally/physically disabled etc) she worked with who weren't so much bitter, as they were goddamn entitled. They'd obviously gone through life with so much, maybe too much, support and help that they point blank refused to support themselves. I mean, we're talking people in their 30's, with full use of their upper body who would refuse to dress themselves or make a piece of toast. Their attitude was ""why do it myself, when I can have someone do it for me"". It's understandable to a degree, some people are obviously struggling emotionally and plays out in different ways, or were just raised badly, but still. It truly makes me respect someone like Suzy, who does everything for herself with no legs. I don't think I would have her strength of will, mind and fucking arms lol."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqmop,plasmaticriver,2,Wed Jan 28 20:59:34 2015 UTC,"It seems like some types of physical issues should be paired with at least some psychological therapy. As it stands now, they are not treating the whole patient, just parts of them. It's well known the effect of depression on living a contend, happy life, and I can't imagine that someone going through something like this WOULDNT be depressed or anxious."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqmop,plasmaticriver,2,Wed Jan 28 23:43:00 2015 UTC,I have some thought but want to see how others feel. Do you think it informs their choices and decisions in life? Is one set more emotionally damaged I'm specifically thinking of Penny.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqmop,plasmaticriver,1 point,Mon Jan 26 17:35:29 2015 UTC,"I'd say be born. If you've been a freak from birth, you've had to live your whole childhood, adolescence and adult life as one. That probably means not having many friends and being shunned and shamed by virtually everyone. If you become a freak later in your adult life, at least you've had a partial life of not being treated differently."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tqmop,plasmaticriver,1 point,Wed Jan 28 05:29:48 2015 UTC,So do you think all your friends and family would treat you differently or shun you? Would it depend on if it was caused by accident/illness vs by yourself ( like body modifications).

AmericanHorrorStory,2tnt5k,mindjyobizness,5,Tue Jan 27 09:22:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't. I'm just basing this off the fact that I've never really seen her act (most of her lines as Pepper are small and insignificant), and I don't think she's been in many other films or TV shows. I'm not sure she could pull off a bigger role."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnt5k,kenbrellfan,13,Sun Jan 25 23:27:24 2015 UTC,"She had a monologue scene in Asylum??? Granted she was still in Pepper's character but she was good when I watched it. She has potential and if she's not good, Ryan wouldn't have asked her to return."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnt5k,johnny0929,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:29:55 2015 UTC,"She's good as Pepper. I personally don't think she'd be good as something much more complex and significant than Pepper. But I don't know, maybe she would. I just have no interest in seeing that when we have better actors who could play those roles."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnt5k,kenbrellfan,3,Sun Jan 25 23:39:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe use her as a role that could've been played by an extra, such as the museum curator this season or something."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnt5k,johnny0929,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:42:31 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely. She could definitely play something like that. I thought you meant what OP was saying, like a Paulson or Peters type role."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tnt5k,kenbrellfan,7,Sun Jan 25 23:44:38 2015 UTC,"Acting is a lot more than just dialogue, she's shown how great an actress she is even when she's only saying 1 word."

Second, that article is from October 2014 right when Freak Show started. She has since been very firm about NOT returning, other than that her final choice will depend on having a very long conversation with Ryan Murphy about it and how he could possibly make her a pitch she could not refuse.  We've talked about it enough in other threads, so don't go posting misleading information for upvotes."

I wouldn't want to hang with her forevs either.  But Elsa wasn't like Twisty or Mordrake (don't know about the rest of his entourage) in that she was at least somewhat aware of her own actions and how they would be perceived. Twisty thought he was doing the right things and was astonished when he was perceived as anything negative. Mordrake's other head has its own mind and perceptions that he could not control, and he thought he was doing the right things too. But Elsa knew when she was being sketchy.   Perhaps Mordrake's standards for ""pure freak"" have more to do with what is in the heart and mind vs. what society will accept as normal."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tpax9,Jakwalter,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:26:47 2015 UTC,I think its because he is the leader of his freaks and he realized that Elsa was a leader and he sent her to her freaks. She wouldn't fit with his group cuz she had her own
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmreb,Strife86,36,Sun Jan 25 18:04:04 2015 UTC,"A good chunk of the Pink Cupcakes episode also contains foreshadowing, especially in the scene where Elsa and Stanley talk about the rise of TV.  Elsa says 'she'd rather be dead than being on-screen advertizing instant coffee' (which is what ends up happening in the finale).  Likewise, Maggie's prophecy for Jimmy in that episode comes true in its entirety, even though she's not a psychic."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmreb,quarrystone,19,Sun Jan 25 21:23:13 2015 UTC,Definitely didn't pick up on this irony while watching the episode but thought about it later. I was a little disappointed they killed her off like that though.   I'm not a huge Emma Roberts fan or anything but she was becoming the only moral compass for several people. When they were going to tar and feather Lizard girl's dad I thought her little monologue was her one defining moment this season.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmreb,itsthe90s,10,Sun Jan 25 18:57:01 2015 UTC,"Frankly I found her monologue quite hypocritical, I mean, she's like ""stop killing this awful man it's not fair"" while she's helping Stanley killing innocent people."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmreb,TheLostNights,14,Sun Jan 25 19:01:28 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, but she was at least making an effort to change. This monologue came on the eve of her telling people what Stanley was up to. She also saved Ma Petit when she had the chance to kill her and despite some shitty actions she really did love Jimmy.   Simply calling it hypocritical because she did some bad things means that Elsa needed to end the same way and really so does everyone else haha."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmreb,itsthe90s,-1,Sun Jan 25 19:07:21 2015 UTC,Elsa really should have. :/

It would just further prove to him that he was right, freaks are terrible, and that stereotype is perpetuated."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmreb,itsthe90s,2,Sun Jan 25 19:08:37 2015 UTC,She also foreshadowed the pot roast.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,baileath,6,Sun Jan 25 18:31:16 2015 UTC,"I come here to talk about how much I love AHS because I started annoying my friends with how much I talk about it (they're not really into it lolol) Also, there are some really great ideas found here. Little things that I may have missed.  With that being said, yes, I hate the hate. If you have a problem with it, go find a site dedicated to hating the show and stay out of here with your petty issues."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,SkunkyDunk,8,Sun Jan 25 18:39:14 2015 UTC,This is so true. I love every season and I can't stand it when people just want to sound like they like the older seasons more for the sake of sounding like hipsters.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,Doctor_Arkham,5,Sun Jan 25 22:53:49 2015 UTC,"It's generally knick-picking because the season is a newcomer and seems to have to updo everything before it. I disliked Coven initially, and thought a story about witches would fail to be ""horrific"". But I thought Asylum and Murder House were great. And Freak Show did just fine; the story was a little all over but it had a good setting and great characters.  American Horror Story earns this because they're an anthropology series so its a fresh start every time. I rarely, if ever, see any complaints over seasons with The Walking Dead --- it's mutually agreed some seasons weren't as good as the others, but the story hasn't ended and theres more to come. In AHS, the story is done, and its got to be rated in comparison its sister seasons.  It's annoying, I agree, but this is reddit and people like to discuss disdain for things here, so I don't imagine hate trains stopping anytime soon."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,janna_,7,Sun Jan 25 17:55:08 2015 UTC,"anthropology   lol. I think you mean anthology. I mean, since the shows are about humans (for the most part?) it is an anthropology show. I took an anthropology course on magic and witchcraft and we actually learned about a lot of the things that happened in the third season."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,The_mrs,4,Mon Jan 26 01:00:41 2015 UTC,"I see this cycle with any series (TV, video game, etc). It's a mixture of band wagon hopping and trying to compare something new with the old.  I will admit, I was on the Coven hate band wagon, even though I didn't finish the season as I was proclaiming its shittiness. It's not as bad as I thought, and was actually somewhat entertaining.  I think the best way to avoid this cycle is to just let the season run its course, wait a month or so and binge watch when possible. That way the plot may seem more coherent and viewers could maybe see something they didn't before."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,Innunim,3,Sun Jan 25 21:47:57 2015 UTC,"Binge watching vs watching as it goes is such a completely different experience, I can see people changing their minds. Plus people often enjoy arguing for the sake of arguing, it's the nature of the internet. I like what I like and don't really care too much if someone else feels differently. We all come with our own unique history, pathos, experience, etc, so of course we are going to have differing opinions. When you are watching as it goes, there is a lot of time to think about ( and forget some if ) the last episode. That does make it feel draggy sometimes in the middle. Plus many of us have insanely high hopes for a ""perfect"" season, but my idea of perfect may not be yours. I'd just let it slide off your back and not let it bug you."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,The_mrs,3,Mon Jan 26 01:05:41 2015 UTC,Tbh I've enjoyed every episode of this show and I dislike comparing them. I can't wait for next season and until then I will rewatch all seasons.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,BartuHTC,4,Mon Jan 26 00:06:05 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing recently, and I totally agree. However, I will say that my first time watching Coven was binge watching with no clue this sub existed (I bought it on iTunes back in January immediately after seeing and loving the first two seasons, I couldn't wait to see the next one!). And without any expectations, binge watching, I fucking hated Coven. I binge watched a second time when I bought it on DVD (I had the other two on DVD at that point and wanted to complete the collection, regardless of my feelings towards it) and I ended up hating it even more. I really cannot express how bad of a season it was, and it's really a shame because Angela Bassett killed her role, Marie Laveau is my favorite AHS character across all seasons.   With that being said, I absolutely loved Freak Show, and is now my favorite season."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,jeromerules,2,Sun Jan 25 17:59:23 2015 UTC,"This happens with pretty much anything that has a big following. Bands, TV shows, don't even get me started on the Zelda fan base. One of the titles that they bashed most in the series is now considered one of the best.   People just live off of complaining."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,torchdexto,2,Mon Jan 26 16:54:27 2015 UTC,"I got kinda lucky. Never saw one episode of this show until about a month and a half ago when I exhausted my supply of things to watch on Netflix. Decided to binge-watch all available seasons in the span of about 2-3 weeks! My dad is a fan of the show but never talks about it. I have a few friends who watch and never said much either. I had the opportunity to watch the first 3 seasons without any influence from outside opinion. LOVED Asylum. Loved as in re-watched the season a few times. The whole story speaks to me...I can identify with Sr Jude (read my submission history for why if you want). Loved Murder House slightly less than Asylum. Was not a huge fan of Coven, but I didn't hate it either. Freak Show was okay, wish they would have made Twisty a bigger deal after revealing his soul to us.  But after spending some time on this sub, I can see why people complain about some of the fans..."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,EscapingBriarcliff,0,Sun Jan 25 21:51:44 2015 UTC,Upvote for username.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,Doctor_Arkham,2,Sun Jan 25 22:54:35 2015 UTC,I totally agree. My friend decided to binge watch Freak Show on my DVR yesterday. I can honestly say that seeing the entire season in it's entirety made me realize how good it was. It didn't start tripping all over itself like Coven seemed to do towards the end. It trailed off a little now and then but the story felt complete. People will realize this when it is on Netflix. Maybe not the best season but definitely not the worst.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmjhv,JTtheLAR,1 point,Sun Jan 25 19:33:31 2015 UTC,"I speculated a similar theory at the end of Freak Show. My partner and I watched Murder House and Asylum on Netflix, and I wondered if seeing the season all at once, and without commercials improved the experience. We watched Coven and Freak Show as they aired on tv, and because of the time between episodes, and the commercials I figure the story becomes too broken up and hard to follow. So I'm thinking I'll DVR season 5 and we'll binge watch it instead."

Asylum had grey, black, and brown tones, Coven had the white and black contrast, and Freak Show had a pastel and blue-hued colors which really set the mood and fit the time period well. I really appreciate the work they put into planning the show and how it's going to look. I think although the story is important, the visuals tell a story on their own. To me, AHS really does that quite awesomely."

AmericanHorrorStory,2to17e,abradolph,-1,Mon Jan 26 00:54:55 2015 UTC,A pigeon toed fuck
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,leggomeggok,13,Mon Jan 26 05:42:54 2015 UTC,Maybe he was in a different afterlife with Matt Bomer.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,theyfoundthebody,2,Mon Jan 26 07:13:01 2015 UTC,Totally possible.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,cutecatiscute,1 point,Mon Jan 26 17:05:50 2015 UTC,Well that'd be some afterlife
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,cutecatiscute,8,Thu Jan 29 20:07:05 2015 UTC,"I just don't think he would be welcome there. Maybe all would be forgiven, but at the same time the very first person we see is Ma Petite. If Dell was there, that would just be... awkward, to say the least."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,Behe464,2,Mon Jan 26 14:06:06 2015 UTC,I get what you're saying. I kinda felt that way when Ethel and Elsa were reunited... Who knows?
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,mistar_z,4,Mon Jan 26 17:06:44 2015 UTC,"That is true, I never thought of that. Maybe because they were old friends, true friends, it is easier to forgive? ""I'm sorry I killed you, Bestie."""
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,the_clown_prince,2,Mon Jan 26 18:36:15 2015 UTC,Elsa killed Ethel in self defense. Ethel wanted to kill her for killing Ma Petite which she didn't do. So there are probably no hard feelings.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,mythosopher,5,Tue Jan 27 03:59:34 2015 UTC,"The freaky afterlife is Elsa's freak heaven. Dell killed ma petite and we know what happen with Stanley, Maggie and Dandy."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,Oddbaugh,4,Mon Jan 26 11:40:50 2015 UTC,Fuck Dell.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,mythosopher,1 point,Mon Jan 26 07:29:03 2015 UTC,I'm still confused about how she ended up in that afterlife. I don't get how afterlives work in the AHS universe.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tp1s0,Oddbaugh,3,Mon Jan 26 08:08:33 2015 UTC,I don't think Elsa's afterlife was ghostly. I don't think she haunted the freak show like the souls in murder house. It was more like Elsa's heaven. I doubt the freakshow is even still up to be haunted.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tm5qb,zeropat0000,14,Sun Jan 25 14:34:29 2015 UTC,found this!

AmericanHorrorStory,2tm5qb,itsthe90s,10,Tue Jan 27 22:10:20 2015 UTC,I think my favorite one is Frances! She's had such drastically different roles every season! After season 1 seeing her as the thug in prison was so impressive/hilarious and then Myrtle is one of my favorite AHS characters of all time.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tm5qb,itsthe90s,1 point,Mon Jan 26 18:30:01 2015 UTC,"I meant after her role in season 1, season 2 was so shocking and different and she's kept up that trend."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tm5qb,crunch816,2,Tue Jan 27 00:08:01 2015 UTC,I still don't remember Paulson from MH. Must rewatch.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,Cduns112,24,Sun Jan 25 16:52:31 2015 UTC,"I usually don't complain about Murphy, but this one is completely valid. He gives away far too much information regarding the show. Not only about the clues, but about the guest stars and returning characters. Completely ruins any element of surprise."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,davis98,11,Sun Jan 25 17:51:48 2015 UTC,"I wish he kept the Mordrake/Twisty returns a secret, but compared to last season his interviews were far less frequent. It was nice because he does give so much away. It's sort of strange he hasn't done an end-of-season interview with Entertainment Weekly, though.. Last year they did one after almost every episode"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,starsurfer9,6,Sun Jan 25 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"Totally true. I wish I didn't know about Lily Rabe's return or Sarah Paulson playing a two headed woman cause those would've been fantastic reveals on the show. It was pretty exciting reading about them online so seeing it on screen must've been even moreso! I think for next season, I'll be avoiding articles and interviews while the show is on air."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,Enkiae,3,Mon Jan 26 04:25:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I think that him saying this plus confirming that all the seasons were connected episodes before the show confirms it made everyone stop focusing on this season and only theorize about next or how something sitting on the table in Murder House was 'obviously' a clue for Freakshow.   Really, really annoying and poor planning on his part. Let's attempt to keep some mystery in this instead of trying to boost ratings with stupid shit."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,itsthe90s,4,Sun Jan 25 19:01:08 2015 UTC,he really loves spoiling things too
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,tinyshroom,6,Sun Jan 25 21:02:06 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people can't just...wait? Like I do not care whatsoever what next season is about until the second it comes on my tv. Honestly, I'm just going to unsubscribe from here until then. Bye guys. :)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,chiwiener,2,Sun Jan 25 17:38:51 2015 UTC,sometimes artists are the worst thing that can happen to their work.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,leafofpennyroyal,1 point,Sun Jan 25 23:30:51 2015 UTC,they do that every season
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,bwood16,1 point,Sun Jan 25 18:35:18 2015 UTC,I think he did it on purpose. He might of feared the fans they picked up from coven would leave bc they made it grittier compared to Coven. So knowing their are season 5 clues in the first few episodes might pull the audience in and knowing the seasons are connected might make them stay.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,anandamidetrip,1 point,Mon Jan 26 02:48:37 2015 UTC,"Im not sure, but if that's really why he chose to do that I'd say the show is in a sad state of affairs."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmizb,NorthernRealmJackal,1 point,Mon Jan 26 03:31:22 2015 UTC,"Well.. That was a downer to read. There are currently a number of threads discussing whether we have too many whiners and cynics, for a community that is essentially supposed to consist of fans of the show. ...and I suspect this is exactly what they're talking about.  Here's a less negative angle: For people that want to know about future themes, casting decisions, settings etc., Murphy is being a great guy by sharing a lot of this. For people who doesn't want to know, no one is forcing you. People on this sub are even helping you a great deal, by being nice and using spoiler tags and whatnot. If ""distracting you"" by foreshadowing something is ""one of his biggest mistakes this season"", then the show itself must seem flawless to you."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,Capt-Murphy,52,Sun Jan 25 04:07:25 2015 UTC,Also crossing my fingers for Joseph Fiennes. Don't understand the whole love for Evan Peters when there's the monsignor
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,babyvomit,38,Sun Jan 25 04:43:24 2015 UTC,Evan Peters seriously needs to be killed off for once. It's like Ryan Murphy has no choice than to let the fangirls write Evan's characters or instant backlash.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,the_eric,26,Sun Jan 25 06:06:16 2015 UTC,"Technically, he was killed in Coven."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,jtyler27,43,Sun Jan 25 06:39:56 2015 UTC,And all of murder house
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,HmmmNol,17,Sun Jan 25 06:53:20 2015 UTC,And asylum. Every season except for freak show
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,jtyler27,14,Sun Jan 25 07:05:59 2015 UTC,"Be careful. I said that once and got chewed out because ""he didn't die on screen"""
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,_coco,-1,Sun Jan 25 07:25:42 2015 UTC,But notice how he always gets a happy ending with the girl.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,HmmmNol,7,Sun Jan 25 18:46:22 2015 UTC,He didn't get a happy ending with the girl in the first season.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,Skr3m,3,Sun Jan 25 19:22:19 2015 UTC,Or second.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,monkeysrule123,2,Sun Jan 25 20:04:05 2015 UTC,Wasn't he happily married by the time the aliens took him?
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,lisward,2,Mon Jan 26 06:27:57 2015 UTC,He was happy with jude. May not pf been romantically involved with her. But happy nonetheless
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,kinkuagesimo,9,Sun Jan 25 23:36:18 2015 UTC,Is it me or does he always play the powerless character?
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,JoeSondow,6,Sun Jan 25 12:31:24 2015 UTC,"Oh come on. When Murder House started he was already dead, when Asylum ended he was dead and he was killed when Coven was just beginning. That's a lot of death to me."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,Titdick_McAnusbutts,7,Sun Jan 25 08:37:01 2015 UTC,"I think they meant he was still walking and talking on Earth at the end of Murder House and Coven, both of which had pretty loose rules about death."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,janna_,-2,Mon Jan 26 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"Well fucking Sarah Paulson hasn't been killed off once, and she's one of the shittiest actresses on this show and plays some of the most annoying characters.  I wanted Lana Winters to die so bad it wasn't even funny."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,The_mrs,5,Mon Jan 26 09:32:43 2015 UTC,"Evan is young and his character of Tate appeals to every teen girl's dream boyfriend (minus the mass-murderer thing) but his undying love for Violet gets people hooked on him. He's younger than Joesph and appeals to those girls in high school now; plus it helps he's been in every season while Joesph has only appeared in one. Both very attractive, but a lot of AHS fans are high school girls, and Evan appeals to them better."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,chattypenguin,2,Sun Jan 25 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"Ok, I feel the need to reply here. I'm not in high school, (I'm 44, there I said it!) and while it actually took me a few seasons to like him AT ALL, Going back I can see that yes he is attractive ( perhaps not as much as Fiennes,) but I think there is cross generational appeal. Also, I know PLENTY of non teens who love the show. So why can't we have both?! Oh, and I almost forgot, Adam Levine's ass has been sorely missed."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,noel-13,2,Sun Jan 25 05:43:25 2015 UTC,She took that character that could have just been a fluke and really made you feel and reel. She deserves to be back!

AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,AlfieBoheme,7,Sun Jan 25 06:44:03 2015 UTC,I could really see Paul coming back
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,boulderghost,2,Sun Jan 25 06:55:41 2015 UTC,yessss that would be awesome. paul was great. he seems to have a similar attitude to his character. actually a lot of them seemed to have similar temperaments to the people they portrayed. when I watched the interview with ben woolf and found out he taught preschool it made me really happy for some reason. he just seems so sweet.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,thesevenyearbitch,7,Sun Jan 25 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping that Finn Wittrock comes back for another season. I thought he was the best (and only really interesting) main player in Freak Show. Francis Conroy is the only one who's been in every season that I would love to see again and again. I do hope they bring Lily Rabe back and agree with Joseph Fiennes and James Cromwell.  I think they really should look into getting some new blood on the show.  I'm sick of seeing Jessica Lange, Evan Peters and especially Sarah Paulson play the same characters every freaking season.  They wouldn't be quite so grating if their characters were different, but they've been playing the exact same character tropes for three and even four seasons."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,MaddieBonanaFana,7,Sun Jan 25 16:10:09 2015 UTC,Agree! One of the reasons that Frances never gets old is that each year her character is so drastically different. Bitter moira to angel of death/prison thug to overly eccentric Myrtle to overly attached mother to a psychopath.  I'm convinced there isn't a role that she could play and me not enjoy it! haha
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl0w0,chattypenguin,-1,Sun Jan 25 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"Lange/Paulson/Peters are definitely typecasted, but I find Sarah Paulson to be literally a million times more grating than the other two.  Woman can't act for shit."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tkzke,LordDVanity,6,Sun Jan 25 18:25:16 2015 UTC,"I think more than anyone this season she really deserved her happy ending and it was so rewarding to see it happen. With the heroes backdrop that moment was so powerful and had me welling up. It was so great that neither her or Bette/Dot/Jimmy were living some fantastically lavish life, they were just happy and loved :)"

AmericanHorrorStory,2tkzke,The_mrs,2,Mon Jan 26 01:32:04 2015 UTC,"Literally one of the best scenes of the show. The musical number itself made me tear up, but when it started showing the futures of the survivors I literally let loose into a big blob of tears. That Desiree scene was so powerful, I had been rooting for her and Bette and Dot all season, so seeing them be happy was literally everything I ever wanted.  Still upset that Eve got killed, but seeing her happy in Freak Heaven calmed my sadness"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tkzke,FamousKnives,1 point,Mon Jan 26 11:36:41 2015 UTC,I'm wondering what happened to the Mott inheritance after Dandy met his end.  Bette's marriage to him was probably legal.  She declared she didn't want his blood money but that was when he was begging for his life.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tkzke,Set_the_Mighty,1 point,Mon Jan 26 03:49:57 2015 UTC,"I actually started weeping at this scene. I was so glad to know that she got the kids she wanted and a husband that loved her, especially after watching everyone else be brutally murdered. Angela Basset has definitely elevated AHS for me, she's a fantastic actress and plays the shit out of her characters!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tn1q6,t_witterhandle,6,Sun Jan 25 19:28:20 2015 UTC,"I think they could have Jessica return as Constance but have Michael kill her off in one of the early episodes. Fitting with her desire to no longer be a main character, but make everyone happy seeing her beautiful face for a while :)   I am also not sure about this happening in S5 but definitely agree it would be a great season idea. Perhaps they'll have it be the last season. Would be a nice way to send off the show, connect it to the very beginning."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tn1q6,itsthe90s,5,Sun Jan 25 19:40:25 2015 UTC,"Not to mention ""American Horror Story: Antichrist"" has quite the ring to it!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tn1q6,itsthe90s,3,Sun Jan 25 19:45:07 2015 UTC,"yes it does, and having him kill her off would work too."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tn1q6,lurkingphoenix,5,Sun Jan 25 19:49:49 2015 UTC,They don't even have to revisit murder house. They can just showoff it in the back ground and it would be enough for me. Plus they could put Cordelia's interview playing on a TV in the background. I'm getting too invested in this idea for it to not happen now.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tn1q6,lurkingphoenix,2,Sun Jan 25 20:00:25 2015 UTC,Cordelia's   ahh i didnt even think of that until now but the witches also come public around the same time that michael is around could be a connection there maybe. like the witches help defeat him idk either way i really hope they further the story of michael
AmericanHorrorStory,2tn1q6,lurkingphoenix,5,Sun Jan 25 22:14:50 2015 UTC,I've read some weird fanfic's about the witches and aliens teaming up to fight the Anti-Christ.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,technoccordion,7,Sun Jan 25 00:39:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely more than 3.  I really enjoyed the season at first, but felt it started going downhill after the Halloween episode.  It will be an unpopular opinion I'm sure, but these last 2 really felt like jumping the shark.  Everyone seemed to love the sawing in half scene, but I hated it.  It was a stupid way to end a plot line that could have ended with so much more... purpose.  The same is true with the last episode for most of the characters.  There's no point to their death... it felt like just shock value."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,GDIBass,2,Sun Jan 25 08:29:11 2015 UTC,Completely agree. I thought it was good for 2 eps after while Dandy was finding himself. But they botched it and it all went downhill from there.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,Soperos,1 point,Sun Jan 25 11:36:45 2015 UTC,"I actually liked season 3 for the most part. It got a little weird toward the end, but was mostly pretty good. I was just entirely bored with this past season. There were a few good points with Dandy's psychotic antics, but all in all this season felt predicable and without a point. In the end, death didn't even matter this season because ultimately no one had to deal with all the bad they had put out there. Happily ever after ..."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,jhack3891,16,Mon Jan 26 19:10:41 2015 UTC,"After Coven I realized what this show aims for: visual and premise exploration in a central horror theme. I gave up on wanting a coherent plot and it allowed me to enjoy this season so much more. If you let go of the horrible writing you can enjoy the series a lot. It's a sad realization, but it makes the show way more enjoyable."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,nikolaibk,16,Sun Jan 25 06:20:26 2015 UTC,"I wanted to make a Reddit post about how good I thought it was and why, but it's been done too much. I thought the finale was fine --- some people complained that (obvious spoilers ahead) Jimmy and the twins should have died, but then what would be our resolution? Elsa freak heaven? She was an anti-hero. I was happy with the fact Jimmy finally realized he was happy to be a freak, and that he was having children with Bette/Dot. It was a nice change of tone for what was a hell of a life for him. And the fact Desiree married that guy she was with a few episodes earlier and even had kids was even more uplifting --- she was living the life she deserved with a man who truely appreciated her, until Dell. And Dandy's ending was bittersweet --- another anti-hero who was all came to like and knew his end was soon and needed. Him living would not have made Freak Show feel like it was getting a real conclusion --- Dandy's empire of death was spiraling out of control and lasted almost the whole season, and to see it end was what a viewer needed. Seeing him die in such a theatrical way was interesting; him in the spot of vulnerability was good payback to what he had done before. AHS ended fine.  It had its faults, but the acting was phenomenal. Fine performances from Jessica, Kathy, Angela, Evan, Finn, Sarah and more. I agree Evan mostly gets typecasted as vulnerable/depressed characters but you can't deny he sells it well. The freaks did a great job, with nothing really awkward about their bits. The only real complication was set ups that meant nothing --- Maggie and Jimmy's conversation while she was changing his wounds and he was saying he'd never forgive her. She was so promising, saying she'd change her ways and make things right. Then, about two scenes later, she's sawed in half and killed. That scene was pointless. Nothing changed. Jimmy still hated her, she still felt bad. A lot of missing conclusions, such as Chester. He ""killed"" Marjorie, and went to the police station to confess, and that was it. He killed a doll. Now what?  Overall, though, the finale was solid. Better than most, actually."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,janna_,3,Sun Jan 25 01:53:08 2015 UTC,I was really happy with the ending. I won't lie i was sort of a negative critic throughout a lot of the season but the ending really tied everything together well. Jessica Lange's closing performance was emotional too since she won't be back.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,chubrub97,3,Sun Jan 25 06:44:58 2015 UTC,"Chester was clearly insane and covered in real human blood, not doll blood. I don't think it's that difficult to extrapolate his ending."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,bwaredapenguin,14,Sun Jan 25 14:16:42 2015 UTC,"I think Freak Show and Murder House have more in common than we have thought.  Both Coven and Asylum had a pretty liner main plot. Even with tangents and specialty episodes, we knew by the end of the season, we would know who the Supreme would be, or if Lana would escape to safety.   I think Murder House and Asylum were less linear, and more ""musings on a theme,"" if that makes sense. There were plot through-lines, yes, but in those seasons, I felt that the individual characters and stories took the focus. The ideas were more abstract, and tied together with some basic through-lines.  This is a stretch, but Freak Show almost felt like a mini-anthology of plot lines inspired by the ""freak show"" theme. In some ways, you can say that about Murder House, too."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,kess0078,5,Sun Jan 25 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. The people saying there wasn't a plot to Freak Show...well, what about Murder House?? It didn't have a clear setup, either. It was a story about a family in a house, just like this was a story about a ""family"" running a show.  I think it was done very well! Absolutely loved it. I enjoyed Coven, but felt like it was missing too much of the ""horror"" aspect of American Horror Story. Freak Show brought it back, and seeing the way Freak Show started to tie into Asylum was a really interesting turn.  The very end of the season was maybe a little expected or cheesy, but I liked that, too--I'm playing Jessica Lange's cover of ""Life on Mars"" right now."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,damningcad,3,Sun Jan 25 05:04:20 2015 UTC,"I agree. The people saying there wasn't a plot to Freak Show...well, what about Murder House??

I liked Freak Show overall, but I'm a taken aback by the people defending the lack of plot. I mean, great moments are nice and all, but it would be even better if it could be put together in a much more coherent fashion."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,feedthecollapse,3,Sun Jan 25 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"Difference being how no one on earth acts like those freaks did and the Harmons were believable as real people. That, IMO, is a large part of what made ssn1 great."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,Soperos,10,Sun Jan 25 11:41:34 2015 UTC,"It was still a great season, not as good as seasons 1-2, but better than coven IMO. There were a lot of great aspects about freaks show. If I hadn't seen the other seasons already, I would think it was one of the best shows I've ever watched. I don't understand all the hate this season got, it was still quality entertainment every single week, what more could you ask for from a tv show? at the very least. The cinematography, special effects and acting were phenomenal as always. And yes this season definitely had a plot"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,bwood16,30,Sat Jan 24 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"I don't get why people hate it so much. It's one of my favorites. Also the whole ""It didn't even have a plot!"" excuse is lame because it was freakin awesome for a story that didn't have a main plot."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,OhItsPatrick,13,Sat Jan 24 21:59:16 2015 UTC,I think having to wait week to week the flaw became more apparent and everyone jumped on the hate bandwagon.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,lurkingphoenix,13,Sat Jan 24 22:17:06 2015 UTC,Yea. I think when people binge watch it they will say how much they love it. Kinda like how they do with every other season xD
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,OhItsPatrick,12,Sat Jan 24 22:19:55 2015 UTC,Yes. AHS is one of those series than is best enjoyed as a binge than to watch live.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,ElphabaPfenix,7,Sun Jan 25 01:33:47 2015 UTC,"Usually to enjoy a story, it helps to identify with one or two of the main characters.  When something good or bad happens to them, you feel it.  I found it difficult to identify with most of them in Season 4.  And so I didn't really feel their emotions.  The easiest characters to identify with are ones that are moral and living a conventional life.  The character then gets immersed in a new, strange world and you empathize with their journey.  In AHS this world is scary and disturbing.  In past seasons there were several characters that fit the bill:  S1: The Harmons  S2: Kit and Lana  S3: Zoe, maybe Cordelia  S4: ?  The closest are Bette, Dot, Jimmy, Desiree and Ethel  But Jimmy, Desiree and Ethel aren't ""discovering"" a new world.  Bette and Dot are, but they hardly lived a conventional life before.  Not only that, but several of these characters committed murder."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,DarkHypotenuse,1 point,Sun Jan 25 09:26:31 2015 UTC,"Actually I did too.  She sort of works against the ""conventional"" thing, but she was someone who was moral.  Additionally she was someone who was discovering a new world.  She had been isolated before meeting up with the other witches."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,dejour,1 point,Sun Jan 25 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you can only identify with ""conventional"" characters because you're a conventional person? For people who are outside of the norm in someway, it's generally easier to identify with those who are considered an ""other.""  What about the girl who's father turned her into reptile girl? She was pretty conventional beforehand, also Patty Labelle's character and her daughter were normal for the most part (though granted they weren't in it very much...) Maggie was also mostly normal, she was just a con-artist."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,jwgarcia82,3,Sun Jan 25 07:53:35 2015 UTC,"That's likely true that I identify with conventional characters as I see myself as conventional.  As for your specific examples?  The biggest problem is that they mostly weren't ""main"" characters.  Stories were rarely told from their perspective.  I identified with Penny in the episode that centered around her and her father.  I liked that episode.  The story with the maid and her daughter was largely told from Dandy's perspective.  We essentially never get to see them except when interacting with Dandy.  As for Maggie - she was conventional in some ways but horrific for going along with a plot to kill people."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,dejour,1 point,Sun Jan 25 15:41:35 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering if the fact that there were no flashbacks to modern time has something to do with people feeling so disconnected from this season... All of the other seasons flashed back and forth from past to present, or just took place mostly in the present (Coven and Murder House) while this one was solely in the past with no connection to the modern world.  I think in Maggie's defense, (not that it makes it right), back then, they didn't consider the deformed, disabled, or different to really be people; hence the poor treatment and the police not really caring when one of them was killed or missing.  It's the same way black people were treated back then.  Once Maggie became friends with them and realized that they were in fact real people, with real lives, she tried desperately to ""fix"" the problem she'd helped create as best she could, even though it was far too late."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,jwgarcia82,2,Sun Jan 25 16:07:37 2015 UTC,I dont think anyone can relate to the other characters because no one is like that in real life. Even people against the norm.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,BasketeerOverHere,9,Sun Jan 25 00:27:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This season has been heavy on the creepy and oddball, but with very little horror."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,psyEDk,3,Sun Jan 25 01:54:51 2015 UTC,Probably the most murder I've seen on any show ever too.  Can't think of a show that has multiple massacres or crazed psychopaths.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,nicolauz,2,Sun Jan 25 02:06:31 2015 UTC,"Dandy's finale massacre was amazing, and easily one of the boldest things AHS has ever done in any of their seasons, and it made the finale for me. But I would classify it more as drama rather than horror. I mean it's not something that would keep you up at night from fear. Freakshow was big on drama (and did it well), but it brought very little horror or creepy imagery to the table like previous seasons did."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,BasketeerOverHere,1 point,Sun Jan 25 02:16:43 2015 UTC,"I'm going to disagree and say this is EXACTLY what keeps people awake at night. Given current events more people are probably afraid of a lone psycho gunman ( with a magical golden revolver that never needs reloading!) than a wicked witch, or a talking dummy.  of course people have all kinds of phobias that don't make sense to others but even phobics know a killer clown is a lot less likely to pop up in their bedroom than some nut job going on a rampage. It's actually something that can and does happen, making it something more people are likely to feel concerned about at some point or another. and I'm saying this as someone who grew up with an absolutely pathological fear of ghosts, dead people, cemeteries, anything involving death and dying. As a very small child I would cry if we passed a graveyard while out driving.  Of course as an adult, I'm (mostly) over that, but I am very damn aware of why people should have the right to defend themselves and their loved ones from the human monsters among us."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,The_mrs,2,Mon Jan 26 01:50:30 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that that scene is a real life horror. I may have worded by phrase wrong. I meant that while that situation is entirely terrofying in real life, it's not very scary to watch on tv. Maybe it is for some people, so forgive me for generalizing. But I would still classify that as a dramatic scene more than a scary one."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,BasketeerOverHere,2,Mon Jan 26 03:03:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's ok if we don't totally agree. I mean it's certainly not horror like friday the 13th, gory slasher films etc, but one of the scariest movies I've ever seen was the '60's version of The Haunting, and not a bit of gore to be seen. For me, the gory stuff is kind of a distraction from the truly scary psychological things. But I'm not a typical horror fan ( I'll read Stephen King til the cows come home, but rarely like the movies although in retrospect those are also low-gore high- psychological. ) FTR- I do confess to being horribly disturbed by the first Friday the 13th movie, and seeing pics of Freddy still give me shudders :D"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,The_mrs,2,Mon Jan 26 05:50:32 2015 UTC,"It has a different way of telling the story. Instead of creating a huge main plot there were some main plots and other plots sometimes independent. It's like multiple seasons of a normal show in one season. Since people are not familiar with this they felt a need for just one main plot. Actually I didn't like this season too. But not because of the ""mess"", because I never liked the idea of a Freak Show. But that just my opinion and besides that it was far from bad or weak."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,BartuHTC,2,Sat Jan 24 23:46:22 2015 UTC,Nope. This is definitely not why people disliked this season. Kind of insulting theory tbh.

Don't get me wrong, Freak Show wasn't my favorite of the 4 seasons, but you gotta keep in mind, it was Lange's last season so RM had to bow her out in the classiest most thankful way possible, which I certainly believe he did with Elsa. I think the took the feedback from Coven (i.e.: sloppy side stories, rushed character development) and improved a lot on those things, we actually got a full glimpse at the main characters' lives (save a few) and even some detail on the back stories of the freaks, AND little to no inconsistencies. I just wish we could expand the episode count because the thing that always always gets me is the ""OKAY TIME TO WARP THINGS UP"" speed during the last two episodes (but again this is not exclusive to Freak Show). Overall IMO this season deserves at least an 8/10."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,troutcommakilgore,1 point,Sun Jan 25 04:02:16 2015 UTC,"It wasn't scary. Season 1, jumpy, scary, suspenseful, character development and people you can sympathize with. These all decrease each season, culminating in a season 4 that was just too thin to be good. Dandy, twisty, some of our favourite returning cast members, that adorable little Indian woman, a bunch of sweet revenge-moments, don't get me wrong we watched and enjoyed. It just didn't live up to expectations/our hopes for some scary shit."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,jwgarcia82,5,Sun Jan 25 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"""Horror"" doesn't always mean ""Scary.""  Horror can also be disturbing or unusual, which this season had in spades."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,amantelascio,1 point,Sun Jan 25 07:57:53 2015 UTC,"I loooooved the entire season minus the last episode.  The one right before it was so amazing!    I just didn't think the finale held up to the rest of the season.  Definitely my favorite season so far [I have a bit of a love of freak shows after reading a lot about them for a class].    The finale just felt a bit flat after the buildup.  Everyone just got shot.  Then the guy that shot them all just got drowned.  The week before a crazy guy sawed a woman in half because he thought a doll told him to.  Just pales in comparison.    Overall, awesome season."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,jwgarcia82,2,Sun Jan 25 04:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I loved NPH's story arc.  He was a great lunatic, and it was great to see Jamie Brewer back on the show.  I always anticipate seeing what kind of character she'll play."

In Freakshow I especially enjoyed Dandy and Elsa. Maybe one of the reasons, why I enjoyed Freakshow so much is, that I had really low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't because I thought they wouldn't do a good job, but because I wasn't too thrilled about the theme ""Freakshow"". I feel bad for feeling like this, because there're people who have to live with it, but looking at deformaties and stuff like that creeps me out. I mean, a horror series is supposed to creep you out, but still... On the bright side, I think after watching this season, it doesn't bother me as much anymore."

And the finale was terrible. I didn't think that it was as great as everyone else. I kept thinking, ""This is how they are sending Jessica off?"" It was very anticlimactic to me.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tjwtg,homerghost,15,Sun Jan 25 00:20:36 2015 UTC,"To be frank, as a heterosexual male, I was never taken aback by Evan Peters characters. They were good, and solid, but they didn't steal the show.   Dandy was phenomenal. Gripping from start to finish. ""That's mine!!!!"" is the finest moment of the whole damn series, and his Charles Atlas monologue was stunning.  I'm willing to accept that he wasn't the only good thing about this series. But if this guy isn't a Hollywood superstar in the next 5 years, I give up."

I also not ashamed to say I find him very very attractive.  correct me if I'm wrong but I'm assuming that most men find actresses like scarlett johannson (not 100% sure on spelling) attractive and appreciate her acting but don't mind seeing her half naked!

AmericanHorrorStory,2tla32,itsthe90s,7,Sun Jan 25 18:36:51 2015 UTC,"Chloe Sevigny (sp?) would be great to see again. She's a great actress and I don't think she does very much at the moment so it may not be hard to get her back on board for another season, this time taking up a leading role. Ideally, I'd like to see the main returning cast members who normally play such integral parts kind of move down a peg and make room for new cast members. As much as I love Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, and Jessica Lange, I think it's time they stop monopolizing all the good roles."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tla32,BasketeerOverHere,11,Sun Jan 25 07:37:32 2015 UTC,"France's Conroy is an actor I always want to see more of, and then they give her such small roles. So I would love to see her in the lead female role next season. Also, (and this is just speculation) but is Paulson returning? She's starring in American Crime Story now, so won't her time be too full to play a significant role in AHS from now on? I mean she can always come back as a minor role again, but it seems unlikely that she'd carry the weight that she did in seasons 2-4 again. I would love to see Connie Britton return again because I loved her in season 1 and then we never saw her again."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tla32,BasketeerOverHere,15,Sun Jan 25 07:33:12 2015 UTC,"Conroy is my #1 choice to take the lead role in a season.  I'd love to see a Kathy Bates or Angela Bassett-centered season as well, but Frances Conroy has been amazing in every season of AHS and deserves more of the focus first!  I also adore Lily Rabe, but I really like that AHS is one of the few tv shows that dares to feature older actresses as the main character."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tla32,doublevisionary,5,Sun Jan 25 10:22:08 2015 UTC,Doubt Connie will be back because she's killing it over on Nashville but I'd love her back. I would have liked for her to be in Coven actually.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tla32,iamtomm,2,Sun Jan 25 17:22:03 2015 UTC,I hope that she comes back at least for an episode or two arc. I know she's busy but I think it's nice when we see actors at LEAST twice
AmericanHorrorStory,2tla32,itsthe90s,3,Sun Jan 25 18:35:48 2015 UTC,I'm thinking that they may have cut Frances' time short this season to prepare us for a LOT of her next season and I hope that's the case! She's just brilliant and talented.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tla32,beeninit42long,1 point,Mon Jan 26 21:18:10 2015 UTC,"Frances Conroy NEEDS to be the new lead. She's been consistently my favourite throughout each season. Other actresses have had on and off seasons, but for me she has been fabulous and transformative. She can go from a very gentle Moira / Angel of Death, to an extremely colourful character like Myrtle Snow. Gloria Mott was another transformation because she had the bits of timidness but she also showed other parts to the character. She was dark in ways. I find she puts just the right amount of humour into her characters as well.   To me, I prefer her over Lange (I know everyone will hate that sentence it's just my opinion) Of course Jessica is amazing we all know that. I just found her transformations to be less drastic. Her character types were different from each other but to me I never saw a HUGE change in them. Not in the way lily or frances have. I think that's largely due to writing though.  Frances could honestly play anything from paranormal to human and I'd love to see more highs and lows from her characters. I think she has a quality that makes her really likeable and also makes you feel for her. That's my personal fave anyway.    It seems likely that Sarah Paulson will get leads from here on though and that's okay because Lana Winters was a knockout performance. I just wanna see more Frances!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tla32,Ridicvic,1 point,Tue Jan 27 01:12:07 2015 UTC,"Hopefully with Lange gone, they won't have a lead woman and we'll just get a satisfying amount of Basset, Paulson, rabe, bates, and Conroy. All of them would be wonderful leads!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tla32,Oddbaugh,1 point,Tue Jan 27 05:53:17 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Sarah Paulson I really hope she isn't a main focus next season. Being one of the select few that has appeared in every season thus far, I think it'd be a miss to exclude her entirely but if she had a 2-3 episode arc I think that would be more than sufficient while we let folks like Frances, Angela and Kathy take over some bigger roles."

Don't get me wrong, I loved watching it and enjoyed a lot of the characters and scenes but overall the plot kind of sat there for SEVERAL episodes on end going nowhere all to be wrapped up in one episode kind of poorly. :-/  I think if they would have nixed one of the lame duck episodes between 6-10 and extended everything that happened in the finale out to two episodes it would have felt a lot more satisfying and have better direction. It needed to be clearer that Dandy was the real problem but like the article mentions, he kind of disappears for several episodes which was a real miss."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmpia,itsthe90s,1 point,Sun Jan 25 18:52:30 2015 UTC,"Idk I thought Coven was clearly going to be about finding the next supreme or that Asylum was going to be the Bloodyface saga, but both ended in a mess. I agree I think the fact this season didn't have a clear goal hurt it but I don't think that's the main contributing factor."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmpia,anandamidetrip,1 point,Mon Jan 26 02:30:21 2015 UTC,Fair point. They go awry but I feel like if you don't start off on the right foot it's a sure fire way to go off the deep end :) haha
AmericanHorrorStory,2tmpia,itsthe90s,2,Tue Jan 27 00:10:38 2015 UTC,"This is the best, most concise review of this season I've read.  This whole season reeked of missed opportunity."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,jeffmangumcondom,12,Sat Jan 24 18:18:52 2015 UTC,Does Even peters really need to be a tragic lover again? I like the roles but there doesn't seem to be enough for a whole season. This seems more like 3-4 episodes then 13.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,lurkingphoenix,3,Sat Jan 24 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"Well, in terms of Evan, I think I finally want to see him end up alone, and it's not his fault, but he turns evil/bad because of it (which I haven't seen from him yet)  I wanted to add more people like James Cromwell and Frances Conroy for sure, along with other guest stars/cast, but I would have gotten way too into it I think"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,lurkingphoenix,4,Sat Jan 24 19:01:38 2015 UTC,"If it is a cult theme I would love to see the story from the police point of view too. The story could bounce between the cult, the police, and the innocent people.   I want to see Frances Conroy have a main role like play the police lieutenant."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,Shloob,3,Sat Jan 24 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, if Frances Conroy lead a cult I would join immediately."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,BlackSparkle13,21,Sun Jan 25 02:09:05 2015 UTC,Want to watch something about a creepy cult? Watch The Following. I honestly wouldn't want to see AHS go this route because it basically already exists on tv with the show I just mentioned.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,BlackSparkle13,3,Sat Jan 24 19:13:15 2015 UTC,"I actually haven't heard of that until now. I honestly don't watch much TV outside of AHS so I really just wanted something that would work with the show because I love the actors and the style of the show (and it would have such potential to be creepy), but I'll check it out"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,IrradiatedCoffee,1 point,Sat Jan 24 19:29:43 2015 UTC,Give it a watch. It is really good. It does cult mentality really REALLY well.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,BlackSparkle13,2,Sat Jan 24 19:42:44 2015 UTC,"I personally found that show to just go downhill after the first few episodes, but to each is own."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,israeldmo,3,Sat Jan 24 21:58:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not for everyone. I've had a few friends say the same thing."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,BlackSparkle13,2,Sat Jan 24 23:35:53 2015 UTC,"The Following is pretty bad, IMO. Too implausible."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,chattypenguin,2,Sat Jan 24 21:04:01 2015 UTC,Is it far fetched in some aspects? Absolutely. But I can appreciate that it gives a little to the issue of finding him and his people. It's not easy to find a serial killer. There were a couple active in the state I live in for 20+ years. And both were finally caught in the late 1990's/early 2000's. But Carroll is like a super version of a few killers rolled into one.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,BlackSparkle13,1 point,Sat Jan 24 23:39:20 2015 UTC,"The following sucks now though.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,Buhnessuh,1 point,Sat Jan 24 23:34:53 2015 UTC,It got kind of annoying when every other person was in the cult.

AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,sara775741,5,Sat Jan 24 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"In terms of crazy Taissa Farmiga, I loved her manipulative, calculating sociopath character in Anna. I'd prefer to see her that kind of crazy than over the top insane. Fits well in a cult, too."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,resilient_reptar,2,Sat Jan 24 20:08:05 2015 UTC,"YES! I have been saying this for a couple weeks now - she killed that role, and I totally want to see her play a similar one in AHS!"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,tinyshroom,3,Mon Jan 26 10:19:13 2015 UTC,I want to see Frances Conroy doing some serious shit. I wanna see her in the part you gave Kathy Bates.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,BasketeerOverHere,2,Sat Jan 24 23:16:20 2015 UTC,"something i noticed that probably doesn't mean much: each title conveniently fits within the phrase ""inside the _____"", i.e. inside the asylum, freakshow, coven, etc. the phrase is the title of the behind the scenes features ahs showcases on youtube. so whatever it is the title will have to be a location or organization, and ""inside the cult"" works just as much as ""inside the murder house""."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,ziaco,2,Sat Jan 24 19:41:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they'd need a better name because American Horror Story: Cult just founds completely uncreative and is a really boring name, even if the story and setting are anything but boring."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,bwood16,2,Sat Jan 24 20:44:13 2015 UTC,"I like this idea! Oregon would be a good place because it's near Washington, which I suppose is a serial killer hotspot. There's lots of woods in the Northwest. It would make a creepy setting.   (Also Finn + Alexandria pls omg)"
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,alrigby24,1 point,Sat Jan 24 23:16:29 2015 UTC,I really like this idea! I'm hoping for a cult theme for next season.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,sara775741,1 point,Sat Jan 24 23:20:54 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend and I have been saying for months that a cult in the late 1970s would be amazing, so I love your idea! Something like this with a more centralized and streamlined plot would be great on the show."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,wildcard6270,0,Sun Jan 25 14:53:45 2015 UTC,"I love this idea way more, though I'm pretty convinced the ""Operation Tophat"" thing is going to happen in S5... It would be cool if we were made to believe the ""cult"" was a normal church/following/whatever for a couple episodes, by telling the story from the cult members point of view - and then have it switch suddenly to show how fucked up it really is."
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,chattypenguin,-9,Mon Jan 26 10:23:20 2015 UTC,Someone had to be gay right?
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,xsebs,8,Sat Jan 24 19:57:16 2015 UTC,I just wanted to see him do something different since he's been straight and in relationships for 4 seasons. I wasn't just making his character gay to be gay.  And the dynamic between Finn and Evan would be different and interesting.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tj69d,wildcard6270,-6,Sat Jan 24 20:00:28 2015 UTC,That's kind of a weak reason. I would prefer a different personality instead of a different sexuality.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl04s,heyblinkin81,6,Sun Jan 25 03:59:15 2015 UTC,"She was in season 2, and yes I would like her to return."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tl04s,itsthe90s,1 point,Sun Jan 25 18:14:22 2015 UTC,It would have been kind of hilarious if he was supposed to play Stanley. Such a little guy with such an enormous penis.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl04s,jonjawnjahnsss,1 point,Sun Jan 25 19:37:15 2015 UTC,Probably something entirely to fabulous to handle. Maybe he was a regular at that gay bar Dell and Bomer's character went to on occasion.
AmericanHorrorStory,2tl04s,johnny0929,2,Sun Jan 25 21:44:44 2015 UTC,"I can see a scene with him (playing a little person in the Chicago camp?) and Dell fooling around with Des walking in on them and Leslie's character was like ""oh hail naw"" or something like that xD"

AmericanHorrorStory,2tl2io,BasketeerOverHere,16,Sun Jan 25 05:17:28 2015 UTC,"In the Asylum pic it looks like the stairs and road form head/horns of the minotaur, while the Coven pic forms the shape of a clown head when viewed side ways. So its possible that an overhead shot from Freak Show has significance to a ""creature"" in the next season."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tl2io,RedWings1926,1 point,Sun Jan 25 12:01:53 2015 UTC,"Most popular theories are project top hat from 1953, or a WWII theme involving England ( I guess they invented top hats, IDk)"

Perhaps it will take some dedicated fans re-watching with a better idea of what season 5 will be to really identify it.   Knowing Murphy though, 2 seasons in a row is a trend so he undoubtedly did the same thing."

AmericanHorrorStory,2tl2io,itsthe90s,0,Sun Jan 25 20:03:14 2015 UTC,Yep. The season finale had a single visual clue in it and several lines in it that point the next season to be about aliens.
