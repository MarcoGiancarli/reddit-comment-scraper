Having such abundance of availability, rather than this crazy hype-train, I've never thought of it as anything other than a-little-bit-better-than-mediocre-fast-food/drunk-food.  I told my family back in Texas about it and they thought I was joking. It's ok, maybe even fairly good... but messing up traffic worse than the Chic-fil-a day for a longer period of time good? I think the hype and/or nostalgia has gotten the better of Fayetteville. Good for them, somebody will get a nice bonus for this opening event.  Sure you might as well try it for yourself, but why wait a comically long time in an obscenely long line? A lack of a better burger on MLK?

It is a take-off of the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia, which was square, not rectangular as one commonly sees on the back of pickup trucks these days. The only flag I have a problem with are ones that have stupid sayings or pictures on them (like the one OP found), that makes a mockery of the flag itself. My problem is more with the people, who claim any flag of the Confederacy as a symbol, without giving proper regard to the facts of history.

People ask me why I live in the Rural Ozarks because they only see what it lacks in modern needs. I live here because I can drive 10 minutes in any direction and be ready to fish or hunt or hike.   Also, the people are amazing. I was out for a run in a local state park the other day and suddenly a truck pulls up to me: ""Hey man, I saw you running in this heat and ran up to the fire station and grabbed you these waters."" He handed me two ice cold bottles of water. In my experience, this has been the rule and not the exception. I was telling a guy how I couldn't get the blades of my riding lawnmower. At the end of the day, I came home and the blades were sitting there with he bolts removed. I have countless stories like this. There is small, vocal minority of jackasses that can ruin it for everyone, but for the most part, everyone is ready to help.   Another reason I love it up here: Vance Randolph.

Arkansas sees all four seasons in their fullest glory; autumn in this state is truly glorious.  Additionally, the University of Arkansas is a stellar school with a beautiful campus, and Hendrix College can boast the same, if a liberal education is your thing.

The prison has a big revolving door and, because of this, everyone's transfer dates are pushed way out.   Of course, our classification of drug felonies is another big problem."

Upper district (everything west of Mt Hersey) will be super low in August, so Middle and Lower districts are best.

I have a nearly identical Gravette postcard and in Google Streetview almost nothing has changed other than horse manure in the street.  EDIT: Could also be Quay or Market.

When we go, I stay on the lake by Silver Dollar City, so we aren't ""in"" the city, but close enough. There's cabins, hotels, apartments, whatever you fancy. I've stayed at Big Cedar Lodge, but really enjoy the Tribesman Resort on the lake also (it's much cheaper, less posh). You can take a canoe out, swim in the lake or pool, there's small walks in the woods, wildlife, etc. but all totally accessible for kids, nothing that takes a lot of effort/planning.   We do SDC for 2 days, but when my kid was that young 1 would work, since there's a good chunk of rides, etc. they can't do. The Butterfly Palace is awesome, you can actually walk around in a large greenhouse with hundreds of different species flying around, it's educational also. Ripleys Museum is fun, if you/the kids are into the weird, and there's a few waterparks. We sometimes do one waterpark day, but usually just swim at the cabin pool/lake.   There's a lot of touristy things I've never done, and religious stuff that's not my bag, but I've never had a problem filling 4 days there, and having a great time. And, there is the bonus of swinging by Eureka on our way home."

Arkansas,3cy98d,areyoutherehov,6,Sat Jul 11 21:31:49 2015 UTC,"I found her when she was about six weeks old, scared, alone, and already completely blind, lost in my backyard. I've raised her basically and she eats solid foods and uses a litter box. I've been calling her Phoebe. My fiancée and I did want to keep her originally but my new apartment won't let us have more than one pet and I already have a cat that has been my baby for eight years and I can't give her up. This kitten (around 2-2 1/2 months old now) needs everything unfortunately (shots, antibiotics for her eyes, etc.). I'm currently looking for a job so money is tight, and I can't give her the proper health care she needs, although I have nursed her health quite a bit and she's doing much better than she was. But with a little spare money this would be a great kitten. She's very friendly, sweet (though since she's a kitten she's in a chewing phase - so keep your toes protected) and playful. To anyone interested I do recommend you have and keep a very clean household (she needs things to be minimal and not change often so she can memorize her surroundings and navigate alone), as well as a fairly quiet house. If you have a TV blaring constantly or four loud kids then this kitten can't function very well. I love her a lot, she means a lot to me, and I promised her I would give her a good life. So if anyone can help me give her that, please comment or PM me for further information.

My cat, Momo, is grumpy but the kitten persisted to try to get Momo to play and eventually she caved begrudgingly. It was cute.

From Wikipedia:  ""Thomas Robb, national director of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, maintains his office near Harrison in the outlying town of Zinc and uses a Harrison mailing address for the organization. Combined with the history of the 1905 and 1909 banishment of unemployed, former railroad workers, this incidental connection to the KKK has given the town a negative image which it has taken active steps to combat in recent years. In 2013, a billboard appeared that read: ""Anti-Racist is a Code Word for Anti-White."" In response, a local radio station removed its nearby billboard, and students from North Arkansas College passed out fliers calling for a protest of the sign.

Arkansas,3c8fjw,Really_Dont_Know,2,Mon Jul 6 07:09:09 2015 UTC,"True, it was to force out the US Army, who refused to relinquish control of the fort after negotiations went stale. However, the US was occupying the foreign land of another sovereign nation, at the time. Also, the CSA was led to believe the US would soon resupply the fort by force with additional troops and weaponry. The CSA took control of the fort. Believing the prior negotiations and assurances that the US would evacuate the forts to be a stalling tactic to prepare for a greater military build up within the harbor. It is worth noting that even though shots were fired, neither force sustained a single casualty. It was after, that the US informally declared war."
Arkansas,3c8fjw,Edson_Nascimento,3,Mon Jul 6 10:02:04 2015 UTC,"No, the CSA was never a sovereign nation. It was never recognized by foreign governments. The US Federal government owned Fort Sumter. Even if the CSA could qualify as a foreign nation, Fort Sumter, and every other Fort in the area would still be US territory unless taken by force. The US was not occupying foreign land, the CSA was attacking US soil. The US had every right to defend the Fort. The Civil War was fought between the Federal Government and Traitors. The South had no constitutional, moral, economic or political right to succeed."
Arkansas,3c8fjw,Really_Dont_Know,0,Mon Jul 6 17:46:31 2015 UTC,"Obviously, it's a matter of perspective. To the CSA, they were already sovereign states and together they made a sovereign nation. President Lincoln refused to recognize them as separate, calling it a rebellion, and promising to hold all federal properties. Once SC took control of Ft. Sumter, it was no longer federal property, because as you said it was theirs if they took it by force. Lincoln responded by calling on Union State militias to go back and retake the fort. This action led four additional states to join the CSA, because it proved that state sovereignty would not be upheld by Lincoln's Administration. For a time the CSA were negotiating deals with Great Britian that ultimately didn't go through due to the US blockade of southern merchant ships. So, not officially recognized, but recognized they were. To SC, that's their fort built for the benefit and protection of South Carolinians harbor trade, not for the benefit of the federal US. Also, to say that they didn't have a justifiable reason for separation isn't exactly true. To us now, we can all look back and say slavery is wrong, but in their day it was commonplace and an essential part of southern trade. The southern states no longer felt that being a part of the US was in their best economic interests, especially if there was a chance slavery would be outlawed. Morally, neither side was right, but at the time many firmly believed they were in the right. Legally, the whole thing was fucked. Politically, those who have might hold the right to do whatever they want. The Constitution was suspended and Lincoln proved to be the tyrant the South had said he would be, but today we hold him as the savior of our Union. Honestly, there was way more going on than just Lincoln holding federal property and fighting to end slavery. We don't have to speculate on their intentions either, because it's all documented. Had Lincoln evacuated the bases and accepted the payment the CSA offered then the Civil War would never had happened. He refused diplomacy, because he felt it would legitimize the CSA. It was a widely held belief that States as sovereign bodies could dissolve themselves of the Union. The war was not over the moral question of slavery, it was over who controlled the resources of the South. Had it been looked back on as a purely economic question rather than the moral question it is looked at today then it would be popularly believed that the US was the aggressor. Outlawing slavery in the south was a political tool used to punish the seceding states. We look back favorably on that decision as the one to end slavery, but that's not true. He still allowed the neutral boarder states to keep their slaves, although most of them abolished slavery on their own before the war was over. It wasn't until the 13th Amendment was ratified that slavery was made illegal and the practice of slavery came to an end. That's great, but let's not pretend the US were more moral in their aggression than the CSA was in their secession. Morality had little to do with it."
Arkansas,3c8fjw,Edson_Nascimento,2,Mon Jul 6 20:14:18 2015 UTC,"To the CSA, they were already sovereign states and together they made a sovereign nation.   So is Isis.   it proved that state sovereignty would not be upheld by Lincoln's Administration.   A state does not hold the right to take military action against the federal government.   For a time the CSA were negotiating deals with Great Britian that ultimately didn't go through due to the US blockade of southern merchant ships.   It didn't go through because GB didn't want to support slavery. The Union blockade was spectacularly unsuccessful. The South was also less relevant economically because of cotton from India.   Morally, neither side was right   Ummm, no. Slavery is still incredibly wrong. Its hard to compare Lincoln using his executive power to the enslavement of millions.   Had Lincoln evacuated the bases and accepted the payment the CSA offered then the Civil War would never had happened.   And slavery would still be a thing.   He refused diplomacy, because he felt it would legitimize the CSA.   Because they weren't legitimate, there is no constitutional grounds for succession.   It was a widely held belief that States as sovereign bodies could dissolve themselves of the Union.   widely held does not mean correct.    The war was not over the moral question of slavery, it was over who controlled the resources of the South.   By the end of the war, it was. So much of the rhetoric used by both sides revolved around morals.   He still allowed the neutral boarder states to keep their slaves,   Because the Emancipation proclamation relies on the power to seize the property of rebels. The border states, at the time of the Proclamation, were under union control and not subject to property seizure.  How can you defend this? Southern Pride? Are you proud of slavery? Of your constitutional right to own another person, a human being, as property? Are you proud of the KKK, lynchings, racism? Is a person only worth 3/5ths because of skin color?   Forget the war, the ""South heritage"" being defended by the confederate flag is the butt of jokes. Its the stereotype of uneducated, racists which will plague the public image of the South until a change is made. It make me livid that a flag which is a go to symbol of oppression, like white hoods or burning crosses, can be flown anywhere in the US. Cling to a history which should bring shame, glorify the uniforms of confederate soldiers like some holy relic but morally and politically the world is, and should be, against you."

I wasn't raised to see The Rebel Flag as a symbol of hate, but then again my family has never experienced the intense bigotry and hatred that some families did while that flag was being flown. That's clearly a privilege of being white in a predominantly white area of the South. It's my school's flag, we played Dixie at every game, and our mascot was The Rebel Man. We were taught about the man whose battle flag was chosen to represent the best of the fighting South; Robert E. Lee. It's to stand for what he stood for, which wasn't slavery; but duty, honor and loyalty (to country). He considered Virginia to be his home country. States were looked at differently back then. A bit romanticized, but most of American History is. You know, there's irony in being a bigot to combat a perceived symbol of bigotry. I prefer a more live and let die approach.

You appear to be correct, there was nothing in the Constitution of the United States (at the time) that prevented succession of states. The South wasn't 'treasonous' by simply wanting to walk away from the Union back before the American Civil War. The matter was settled 'by force' and the Unionists(North) won. Case closed I guess?. I can't really find any reference that 'secession' is considered 'treason' by any current US laws. I guess a state could TRY to succeed, but the federal government still has the right to suppress such movements 'by force' if need be (much as it had such a lawful right back in the civil war days).  In summary, it isn't 'treasony' to try to succeed, but the federal government has every lawful right to suppress such succession 'by force'.   SO... Rebellion does not appear to be  'treasonous', but you can expect deadly resistance to such things. In other words, they can't call you 'UnAmerican' to succeed, but they CAN kill you if that is required to prevent you from doing it."

The right to secede was believed to be a State's right against unjust rule. Afterall, they had fought to secede from Great Britain. States were always meant to join under their own volition, not forced inclusion. Principles of liberty and all that jazz. The Federal Government didn't have the authority to force their rule over State Governments who chose to separate from the Union. Of course, that didn't stop them. I wouldn't say it was anymore a right for the US than it was for Mexico when they attempted force inclusion on Texas."

I don't understand that statement when you back it up with:   I do believe that most folks who still wave the flag are not racist and genuinely believe the ""heritage not hate"" mantra   Do you think the TV show Dukes of Hazzard was racist because the ""General Lee"" had a rebel flag painted on it?  It the show racist because the car was named after THE confederate war general? Is the band Lynyrd Skynyrd a racist band? To me it seems silly that people equate the Rebel flag with racism.  Being a rebel is as american as apple pie.  America wouldn't be here if it weren't for a rebellion, we call it the war of independence but its because we won.  If the US would have lost it would have gone down in history as a rebellion.  If George Washington would have failed to win independence would you look back on him as a racist traitor or would you look back on him as a tragic hero?  That question is fairly pertenant because George Washington WON and therefore slavery in the United States was the law of the land far longer than it would have been (Im assuming).    So is being a Rebel now considered racist?  Its been glorified throughout history.  Less about racism and more about being anti-government or anti-Washington.  Billy Idols song Rebel Yell is racist?  Im just not following the logic here.  That everything in history has to now be destroyed because some people are offended?  You cant NOT offend everybody.    The american flag legally flew over slavery far far longer than the confederate flag.  Why is it not considered racist?  Racism is rampant in America today and in states where there never was a rebel flag.  Hello Boston.  Indiana and Ohio have had some of the largest KKK memberships in the entire United States.    No one I know is proud of the Jim Crow laws or segregation, but it was a fact of life back then.  Are we to hide that part of our history?  To what end?     Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. George Santayana (16 December 1863 in Madrid, Spain – 26 September 1952 in Rome, Italy)  Does the Confederate flag really symbolize sweet tea and rocking chairs?   I would guess that the confederate flag symbolizes something different to every single person.  To me, it represents a southern way of life and being southern.  I don't have a flag, never have had one and never have I had a bumper sticker or anything like that, but I did grow up in the south, although my grandfather came to the South from Illinois well after the civil war.  I think there is a southern pride that would be hard to explain or hard for anyone not from the south to understand and to me it has nothing at all to do with racism.  This whole flag this is what I would classify as a false flag, and there is more, way more to the agenda than just getting rid of the flags from a couple of state capitals going on here."

The Germans don't fly the Nazi flag to show national pride, but that doesn't mean they don't all know and remember World War II. The flag was created by racists for the preservation of racism. We aren't even talking about political correctness either. We are talking about finally admitting that we were wrong as a culture. The southern culture was evil up until the Federal Government forced it to stop being evil. How does the generosity of southern hospitality outweigh the atrocities of enslaving a race? How do libertarian values outweigh burning black churches and using the national guard to prevent 9 black children from receiving an equal education?   When we want to take pride of our heritage, we need to be willing to own the entirety of that heritage. That means accepting that the South only ever stopped being a terrible cesspool of violated human rights and civil liberties until a stronger government forced it into compliance with national standards. That is what makes flying the flags of our ancestors racist in my view. How can we boast of pride when we have so much we should be ashamed of? This isn't just white liberal guilt either.

It was a symbol of good luck long before being a source of controversy. It's like the swastika, a symbol which had meaning before being appropriated. As opposed to a symbol created by the group accused of atrocities, like the confederate flag.   I dont understand is why the south is being vilified so much for slavery when it was LEGAL in the United States   You are right, but, in all US territories it was illegal because of the Northwest Ordinance. In addition, slavery was minimal in the North(New Jersey only had 20 slaves in 1865). Massachusetts abolished slavery in 1783. In most of the North slavery was illegal long before the civil war. Slavery was not abolished by the emancipation proclamation. It played off the Southern habit of referring to slaves a property. The US government can seize property of rebels and use that property to further the war effort. All slavery was abolished with the 13th amendment, North and South, but the North was basically slave free by the time it passed.   Im just wondering if you feel like the massacre of the Indians in the west well after the civil war constitutes ""evil of the north""?   No, that was a national mistake. The South is equally responsible. Also, the trail of tears was enacted by a Southern president and it occurred in the South, just sayin'.   How do you justify being proud of the flag of the United States then?

There's pretty much nothing else that can be attributed to that failed attempt of a country but that. Because of this, the Confederate flags will always be seen as racist.  The United States and its flag, on the other hand, was created because England was unfairly taxing the colonists. In its 239-year history, the U.S. has done many terrible things, but it has also done many good things, like the countless technological inventions and the countless humanitarian efforts worldwide.

It's self evident that there's a cultural difference between southerners and everyone else.   I've spent my life hating redneckery and the south but I think this flag debate is silly. The north committed several atrocities in the south and my atheist socialist ass would have taken up arms against them too. People don't realize that before the civil war people identified more with their state than their nation. The confederate flag represents to many people cultural and political independence.  It's no hard task to find several quotes from Confederate leaders that affirm that in the south's mind the war was about slavery but it's with the same level of ease that one can find quotes from union leaders affirming that in their mind the war was not about slavery, and if we're being honest it's a little hypocritical to deifiy slave owners like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson while admonishing the hundreds of thousands of young southern men who came from poor white trash families (far too poor to own slaves) and died defending their homes and the homes of their neighbors from the scorched earth tactics of the invading union army.   Every July 4th we celebrate a nation that seceded and protected the institution of slavery, I just fail to see why we give America a pass. It just seems hypocritical to me."

Arkansas,3c5czo,l0gjammin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:23:06 2015 UTC,"Big piney creek between Helton's farm and longpool campground is my favorite float.  The scenery probably isn't on par with the buffalo but it feels more remote, the water moves faster, and has interesting rapids.  It costs to put in at the farm because it's privately owned.  Something like 2 or 3 bucks per boat.  The lady at the house is super old and deaf.    This isn't a beginner float or for small kids, but it's not difficult either.    I've seen lots of first time floaters do fine so long as they are in a canoe with someone moderately experienced.    Check the water levels to make sure it's doable as it fluctuates a bit.    Probably 2.5-3.5 ft is ideal on the longpool gauge, or 2-3ft at the highway bridge downstream from longpool.   Highest I've done in a canoe was 4 ft at longpool and I wouldn't recommend that.

This is just a fact; innocent people will be put to death and you have to reconcile this one way or another. In my opinion this only exemplifies the evil perpetrated by the murderers. Not only did they murder someone but now they've become part of a systemic infection that causes us to turn on ourselves. Furthermore the death penalty has been shown to not be a deterrent, and frankly belief that it is is indicative of a very simplistic view of human psychology and motivations.

If you don't want to write the message on it then don't, just supply the tools for them to do it on their own. Simple as that. The Bishops and Priests I've seen speak on this issue said it would be worse to discriminate against your fellow brothers and sisters through your business, sure don't host the wedding if you don't want to, but bake the cake. There is a huge difference from baking a cake and performing a gay wedding.   Think it's a sin to bake the cake?

For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell."" - Matthew 5:30   I'm tired of all the people crying persecution when it's absolutely nothing compared to what people are actually going through around the world and even here in the US."

The ""judge"" in the case was a gay rights activist.  This was a trampling of constitutionally protected right."
Arkansas,3bw4um,puckbeaverton,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:08:20 2015 UTC,"Proof the judge was a gay rights activist?   The Klein's were not fined for being Christian, they opened a public business in the state of Oregon, they agreed to abide by the laws of the state, they failed to do so, they were penalized as a result, don't tell the BS persecution story anymore. Makes the rest of us look bad when a few Christians cry persecution falsely. Especially when Christians are really being persecuted in the Middle East.  The business will force you to sin? Then get rid of it: ""If your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body, than for your whole body to go into hell."" - Matthew 5:30"
Arkansas,3bw4um,TibitXimer,7,Tue Jul 14 02:13:47 2015 UTC,"Christians do not have rights reserved just for their own religion. Feeling persecuted doesn't take away the fact of being a persecutor.   If you base what you view right or wrong from your own religion that's okay, however that cannot and should not occur in government. It directly goes against separation of church and state, and now (here in the short upcoming days) is against the law via the Supreme Court."

Maybe they should go be administrators at their church where they aren't obligated to treat everyone equally."
Arkansas,3bw4um,TheAllDayThrowAway_,-15,Thu Jul 2 20:59:17 2015 UTC,"Christians treat everyone equally.  And this constitutes discrimination as Christians can no longer have these jobs, jobs they had in the first place, when it was an acceptable job for a Christian to have.  There are options to adhere to the law and allow for Christians to be county clerk's.  At least until any current Christians retire or quit (without being forced to)."
Arkansas,3bw4um,puckbeaverton,10,Thu Jul 2 21:11:09 2015 UTC,"If you chose to work for the government, you work follow the government's rules.   If an atheist decided to work for the county clerk, and wanted to not serve Christians because he disagreed with their views would that be okay? No. There is no difference with you guys!  The only discrimination in what you said is thinking that people have to follow what you feel is right, and not what they feel is right. There is a happy medium, and it was decided by the Supreme Court. If you want to openly disagree you are free to do that, however you cannot act like people have to do what you believe is right because of you believe it to be true."
Arkansas,3bw4um,TheFoxForce5Joke,2,Thu Jul 2 23:32:20 2015 UTC,"The only discrimination in what you said is thinking that people have to follow what you feel is right, and not what they feel is right.

Arkansas,3bs3ql,bonzo14,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:01:29 2015 UTC,"Well, from what I hear, they just sort of pick up and go. They require (not explicitly, just in practice) you either have prior experience/intuition or do a decent amount of independent study. That's all based on one friend's testimony, so I wouldn't peg this to the whole program. There are always professors like this and students that don't generally keep up that well.  As a safer statement, I think the program offers opportunity for you to grow outside of the enumerated curriculum. Resources are pretty updated and available (over in the journalism dept., they have a ton of fully equipped iMacs available 24/7 to journalism students). The professors know their stuff and do expect work out of their students.  PM me and I'll see if I can get you in touch with someone actually in the department."

I checked their calendar and the only 'fireworks' event they have planned is to go to a firetower 2 miles away to watch the fireworks events in the surrounding area. The lodge is on the 2nd highest peak in the Ozarks and you can see for miles and miles from up there. My wife and I had the pleasure of staying there in 2012 and it was such a nice quite place. Our first morning we woke up and went downstairs to have breakfast. The dining area was surrounded by a wall of tall windows  and the lodge was totally covered in clouds to the point that we couldn't see out the windows. It was just a bright white. While we ate breakfast the clouds thinned out to such a clear and beautiful view. We had actually planned to go there again the next year but it was closed for renovations. We can't wait to get back and see what they have done with the place (and for $9.6 million in renovations it should be pretty spectacular).   http://www.queenwilhelmina.com/  If you do get to go, be sure to ask about seeing the C.E. Foster House on the grounds of the lodge. My wife and I went on an 'off time' and we were one of three couples staying. A groundskeeper was nice enough to open up the house and give us a little 'mini tour'.   I have no idea what their pet policy is or even how booked they will be next weekend, but if you can't tell I really really enjoyed Queen Wilhelmina.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

If you're this man, the person at fault is the one exercising his civil right to marriage, and not the one who currently has explicit legal permission to retaliate based on religious grounds.

Arkansas,3b32o3,Virtus11,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:31:15 2015 UTC,So are there steep descents or tight squeezes that make it difficult to reach?
Arkansas,3b32o3,Virtus11,6,Thu Jun 25 20:04:57 2015 UTC,"Although there is one very tight squeeze, I'd say the most difficult obstacle is the water.  There are several places where you have to wade through water.  During the stretch leading up to the waterfall room you have to wade through at least two to three feet of water for at least fifty yards.  I didn't enjoy walking through two and a half feet of water when the ceiling was only five feet high.  When you get to the waterfall room what you will find is a large shallow pool with a rocky island in the middle. There are usually dozens of salamanders in the area and there's a breeze that comes off of the waterfall. It was a tough trip at times but I thought it was worth it.  If you're ever going to the Blowing Cave it's important to remember a few things.  Most importantly is don't go alone.  Always bring at least one friend and let someone know where you are.  Also always wear a helmet in cramped caves like that.  The light from your flashlight can distort your senses while in a cave which makes it easy to slip or bump your head on the rocky ceiling.  Always have extra battery's and flash lights.  I also advise paying close attention to where the path splits. To prevent getting lost, put glow sticks in visible places along the way. Just be sure to pick them up on your way back out of the cave.  One other very important thing, other than not vandalizing, is to bring plenty of water.  Due to the temperature and humidity in caves it's easy to get dehydrated and not know it.    When I go caving I always bring an extra bag with me to pick up trash I find along the way. This cave is a special place to me and I like to tread lightly and leave it better than I found it.  With all that bring said, happy caving! If you need a guide you can message me and if I'm free I'll help.  I'm a member of a local caving club so I know my way around the cave fairly well."

The first is a boneheaded comment by a contract worker for Amazon filling in the blanks about something they know nothing about.  This is like a friend of mine who yesterday complained on Facebook about the passing of this new Gay marriage law. I had to explain to her what a court ruling is vs. a law from Congress, but you get the idea.  Unfortunately too many citizens in this country have ZERO concept about how things work or what's really going on outside of sound bites on CNN or Fox news.  The second is the issue of selling the Confederate Battle Flag. Here it's a company's decision what it sells or does not sell. Not much to say about that. They are free not to sell and you are free to buy somewhere else.  That's the great thing about this great nation!  :-)"

I never connected the dots about slavery and Southside until after I graduated. I played in band and enjoyed the hell out of playing Dixie. The swing style with the upbeat tone just did it for me. I viewed it as a part of the Southside culture. I thought we were Rebels, in the sense that we were going to do what we wanted in order to get where we wanted in life.  I did see a few people who liked to fly the Confederate flag during football tailgates. However, Fort Smith Public Schools were very adamant about never displaying those signs in areas that they could control. Rebel flags were not allowed in any building throughout Southside. This also included the football stadium.  When I first heard this news, I wasn't surprised after hearing many rumors over the last decade about potential mascot and fight song changes. The storm was perfect and it obviously makes sense. However, I definitely won't forget my memories surrounding Dixie while growing up. You can attribute Dixie to its history, but Dixie reminds me of great times in high school while enjoying the company of all my friends, regardless of how they looked.  That's just my two cents.

Arkansas,3awbbp,Really_Dont_Know,0,Wed Jun 24 15:31:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, I was just agreeing that the Arkansas State Flag is (intended or not, reminiscent of) the Rebel Flag. I've been asked a few times before if it was done intentionally. Usually after someone asks the question of why Arkansas and Kansas are pronounced differently. So far I haven't found anything that proves it was created to be reminiscent of the Rebel Flag. Actually, I've found the opposite, but just try to convince people it wasn't. It's hard to believe when it was first designed, the designer didn't look at it and at least notice it's resemblance to the Rebel Flag. Considering it was the flag that won the contest (with The Civil War being just 50 years prior), it's even harder to believe that it wasn't chosen for it's likeness, either. That doesn't mean I want it changed, because I don't, but there are many people that see it as just a redesigned Confederate Battle Flag. If you put two Rebel Flags together, broaden the red boarder, and make the diamond white; you get what looks very similar to the Arkansas State Flag. That's how many people outside of Arkansas look at it.   Edit: My bad, that was my original point.   To the other half you're referring to: I was saying, I thought making it known that the official colours are Old Glory Blue/Red, after the fact, was implied. I was referring to the history of the flag and meant that it's not proof, that it wasn't created with the Rebel Flag in mind. You thought I was saying the official colours were proof that it was and I was too busy to read over it to make sure people understood what I meant."

Arkansas,3avo8e,Really_Dont_Know,2,Tue Jun 23 21:40:33 2015 UTC,"I have no problem with one of the four stars being a symbol for the Confederacy. I mean, we've been a subject to four nations; that's a fact and part of our history. But, I take umbrage with it being the lone one above ""ARKANSAS."" I think it would be great if an act was introduced during a General Assembly session to officially designate the lone top one as being a symbol of the USA, and the bottom three being Spain, France and the CSA (preferably the upside-down one).   I appreciate our history and understand its role in shaping our state, but I think too many people confuse history with identity. I don't identify with the CSA; I am a proud Arkansan, Southerner and citizen of the United States of America."
Arkansas,3avo8e,DearBurt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree. That would be totally fine and honestly, it should have always been the upside down star. It just makes sense if you're going to pay homage to a tragic part of our history. My only issue is that we have a lot more important things to be worried about within the state, not to mention the whole nation, but this is being put at the forefront over those issues. As if it really matters in the grand scheme of things."
Arkansas,3avo8e,DearBurt,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are a lot more important issues, but this one could be solved pretty quickly and (I'm hoping) with very little resistance. Also, just because it doesn't really matter to some doesn't mean it isn't important to others."

Unrelated to the two flags similarities, the fourth star to represent our involvement with the CSA was added in 1923 to make it two above and below then redesigned with the lone star above ""ARKANSAS"" just a year later.

Since then there have been many bullshit articles pointing out our flag's connection with The Confederacy. It seems as if the media is trying to have the public shame us into changing well established state symbols for the sake of the few who actually find it offensive.

If I understand this correctly, you could use the full 1gbps for an entire 16 minutes before reaching the limit for the month.  Plus, there's no way to monitor your usage, so you just have to guess when they're going to start throttling.  ISPs suck."
Arkansas,3aw4do,SurlyQueue,2,Wed Jun 24 15:58:27 2015 UTC,"There is a way to monitor your usage.  Log into your Cox account on their website.  Cox's caps are also softcaps.  When you hit them they do not throttel you or charge you extra like other ISPs, you just get an email and maybe a letter in the mail.  I have a 400 GB per month cap on my 150/50 line and have gone over 800 GB in a month when I was downloading PS4 games (3 times each!) due to a hard drive swap out, on 2 seperate PS4s.  All I got was an email letting me know I went over.  Nothing else.    Some ISPs suck, but Cox is really good compared to some on the east coast."

I'm sure it'll be a very expensive website to fully build and maintain. Which is why I believe they are asking for people to put their contact information down. They might be trying to sell their services to local governments and state governments, so they'll need all the names they can get to make it look like people really want this service or to at least make themselves feel like it's worth their time. It still seems pretty young. If local and state governments aren't buying in then they'll probably rely heavily on donations for awhile, but eventually it'd need to be a pay-to-subscribe site. Think of it like Ancestry.com At least, that's what it looks like to me.   Edit:   Now we're excited to introduce a paid service called Site Control that takes everything from our free site and puts it into your own private LOVELAND universe with new super powers for you to enjoy.

Arkansas,3a3cpp,argonplatypus,7,Tue Jun 16 22:18:13 2015 UTC,"for food you need to check out deluccas for pizza or rolandos for latin food.   for coffee go to kollective  for craft beer, try the superior  skip the diamond crater. you wont find anything. instead, go to jessieville and try the coleman mine. you will find tons of quartz. tons. more than you could ever want. some quartz>no diamonds.   there are tons of trails and hikes if you are into that. today i hiked 8.5 miles around hot springs mountain and the goat rock trail. it was great. last week i did the sunset trail from desoto park up and around to west mountain, about 13 miles all and all.   Maxine's is a pretty cool place to hang out and maybe catch a show.   Shameless plug, stop inside Churchill's cigar shop and check out the display of leather goods. It's my stuff,  and Debbie, the shopowner is the coolest lady who will take good care of you for all your frivilous smoking needs. Or come down to Central Station for the flea market if you want to do some pickin through crazy antiques. Also, I have a leather booth down there too (for two more weekends only!). Come say hi and I'll give you a reddit prize.  The farmer's market on saturday morning is pretty great. Tons of crafts and tasty thing. Local kombucha and coffee...all sorts of treasures.   Enjoy your trip!"
Arkansas,3a3cpp,BeastmanCaravan,3,Tue Jun 16 22:24:42 2015 UTC,Thanks for the great suggestions!
Arkansas,3a3cpp,bigbabysurfer,4,Wed Jun 17 05:29:53 2015 UTC,"If you're coming because HOG (Harley Owner's Group) is in town, great - if you're NOT part of HOG, then...this weekend might suck for you...there's gonna be a SHITLOAD of bikes in town this weekend.  These are ALL solid suggestions - for pizza, I'd also recommend Rod's Pizza Cellar (3350 Central Ave) - try the Godfather; you won't regret it!"
Arkansas,3a3cpp,Laragon,3,Tue Jun 16 23:05:22 2015 UTC,We aren't Harley owners but we are a small enough group that we can probably navigate the space between them.
Arkansas,3a3cpp,woodsweapon,3,Wed Jun 17 05:31:01 2015 UTC,"I'm seconding the person suggesting your weekend might suck. They're EVERYWHERE, at all hours of the day. When I used to work at one of the retail establishments along the path that the city closes down for their ""parade,"" the front windows were vibrating, and the business was a good football field's length away from the street. The only thing more miserable was living on the street on Park during that time...  I'll also see your Rod's and raise you Molly's on Highway 5 (8913 Park Avenue). It's in the Fountain Lake/Lonsdale area, but it's the best pizza in the area."
Arkansas,3a3cpp,Laragon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:35:20 2015 UTC,You weekend will not suck because of the HOG rally. Yes there are a lot more bikes than usual but it's not like you can't get away from them.
Arkansas,3a3cpp,CosmicSlopShop,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on where you are. Living on Park was miserable during the HOG rally. And no, you CAN'T get away from them. They're literally everywhere. Twenty miles out of town? Get ready to be behind a line of bikes. The city closes down from Park to Central to Malvern to Gulpha Gorge back to Park for them at least twice.  I'm in Arkadelphia right now and I can hear a pack of them outside."
Arkansas,3a3cpp,CosmicSlopShop,2,Sat Jun 20 00:03:47 2015 UTC,go have to go to mclards BBQ imo its some of the best you can get anywhere.

Arkansas,3a3cpp,Rouxmire,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:54:42 2015 UTC,actually Mclards takes debit/ CC cards now.
Arkansas,3a3cpp,thepaddlegal,2,Fri Jun 19 21:19:57 2015 UTC,Superior Bathhouse and Brewery for beer. Delccias or Rocky's Corner for Pizza. Crash the pool at the Arlington.

Little Rock is a fun city, and there are all sorts of things to do and great local vendors, but it may help us if we had an idea of what she's like.   Also, there are some great cake places, like The Blue Cake Co., Natalie Madison's Artisan Cakes and Dempsey Bakery."
Arkansas,3a2d4d,DearBurt,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:17:45 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I'm terribly sorry.  she's 20 this year, she's a fan of rock music, Theatre/musicals (she's seeing an early production of Rocky Horror Picture show when over there), a generally a bit of a hippy. I'm not entirely sure how well planning something for her to go do would work out but if you had examples then I could present them to her Aunt and try and work something out - I know they already have a lot of things planned for the two months including staying at a cabin alongside one of Arkansas' lovely lakes and a week down in Florida.  Thanks for the links! i'll check them out :-)"
Arkansas,3a2d4d,DearBurt,2,Tue Jun 16 18:41:55 2015 UTC,"As far as local music goes, she needs to check out places like South on Main (amazing food and great music -- vintage ""South""), White Water Tavern (more of the younger/hipster scene) and Jaunita's (more of the rock scene).  The Rep is a fun place to catch a play, or Ron Robinson for a fun movie (they sometimes play classics on the big screen). (Our major theater, Robinson Auditorium, is being rennovated, so plays may be scarce then.) Oh, Movies in the Park is showing The Goonies this July! Ha!  However, if she's already planning to spend some time in the outdoors, she'll be spending her time wisely. We're known as ""The Natural State"" for a reason: It's absolutely gorgeous here! In case she doesn't know, though, you might want to warn her that it gets pretty hot.   While she's in LR, make sure her aunt has a bike (or can borrow one) so she can cruise the river trail!"
Arkansas,3a2d4d,cowboyincognito,2,Tue Jun 16 19:03:03 2015 UTC,I also add Stickyz and Rev Room to the list of venues for great music and food. They're both in the river market area and have lots of great bands.
Arkansas,3a2d4d,Thompsonke,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:03:56 2015 UTC,"Cupcakes on Kavanaugh is always good if you like those designer cupcakes with lots of icing, I know that I have had their cupcakes delivered through Tipton & Hurst (a local flower show) around Valentine's Day or something.    We usually use Mickey's Cakes & Sweets for birthday cakes.  They also did my wedding and groom cake.    Community Bakery is great too.  They have good cakes and great iced sugar cookies.  You also might consider getting a gift card printed to one of the local restaurants, sticking it in a card, and telling them not to open it untill their birthday.  That would be cheaper and easier.    /r/LittleRock has some good information in the sidebar about local restaurants."

Arkansas,3a15ok,fooman03,2,Tue Jun 16 12:41:43 2015 UTC,Latex paint can simply be left open to dry out.  Then throw the dried paint in the trash and throw the can in the recycling.  Oil based paints must be recycled properly though.

Arkansas,39xow5,knuck45,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:08:58 2015 UTC,Haven't heard otherwise.  Thunder on the Mountain brings out lots of locals who probably don't camp out compared to the other festivals (because there are two kids of music in Franklin and Madison Counties: Country and Western).
