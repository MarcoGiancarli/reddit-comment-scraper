painting,3dwetg,theboddha,2,Mon Jul 20 02:25:55 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the colors for me but I was trained to never use strait up black when mixing colors for shadows. I'll use ultramarine blue with burnt sienna to create a nice dark color with the color of the subject to create an appropriate shadow tone. I don't have a formula for this because it's never the same and each object needs different balances of warms and cools.  I do tend to paint wet on dry though, creating multiple washes on top of each other.  Good luck!"
painting,3dwetg,Pabloster,2,Mon Jul 20 03:24:00 2015 UTC,"The anti black campaign is kinda old hat. Plenty on great contemporary painters use black. Just don't think about black as a cure all for darkening things.   You mentioned several possible methods. Complements will help with saturation control, though sometimes the richest colors are in the shadows. I think the main problem your having is that when working alla prima opaque pigments will dominate transparent pigments. Most darker value paints are transparent. Because of that you should try not to pollute your shadows with any whites or brighter colors.  Mix mostly on your palette and don't be afraid to apply very think paint when needed."

Pabloster, I use ultramarine and raw umber for my own mixed black. I'll try out different blue/browns to try different temperature.  fgrissim78, I'll be more mindful of the transparency of my colors, I hadn't thought of the transparency of oils.  Thank you both for your wisdom and experience."
painting,3dwetg,catly,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:35:15 2015 UTC,"Try the grey shadow color mix that my teacher taught me: raw sienna, manganese violet and cerulean blue. Vary amounts of each depending on the shade. You can also add white to lighten or any other color (red or green, for example) to give it a tinge if needed. Pretty bulletproof in my experience! I always wondered how to make shadows, and this has helped me immensely."
painting,3dwn17,princdarknes,2,Mon Jul 20 03:41:50 2015 UTC,"I literally just did something like this the other day at my local urban arts festival. We were supplied the paints by my store. It was pretty expensive spray paint so I don't have any tips about what paint to use.  We had a couple rolls of paper and taped them to a 40x60 board and whenever it got too full we cut it down and replaced it. It was a blast and many people said we were the best booth at the festival.   We did have an issue with people doing too much stuff that could be confused with gang related signs, and people started hogging our paint and space. We even had two guys (looked like thugs) almost get into it because they were both trying to work on what is a relatively small space and they were going over each others stuff. If you can find a way to regulate peoples space then prepare to have a fun time."

Especially on his right side. I really like his left side, where the light falls on his skin. maybe tone down the shadow on the chest a little? Why does the child have this expression? what does it mean to you? I'm really interested.  you handle color very well, and you succeeded in doing the low contrast thing. only the way you depicted the child is a little off putting, because it looks unnatural compared to the wolf, that looks super realistic and smooth..."

That being said, one thing that I notice is that no matter where I look, my eye is being led to the character on the bike/scooter. Since s/he is in the foreground, I feel like it needs a touch more detail. If it wasn't your intention to have the eye lead there, I would suggest emphasising the main focus point or points of the painting.  Keep up the painting!"

painting,3dqy42,mbartelsm,3,Sat Jul 18 22:10:56 2015 UTC,"The piece feels uncomfortable for two main reasons:  Right now the things at the back are the sharpest but the least detailed and the things at the front are the blurriest but most detailed, this causes people not to know whats the focal point in your painting.  And composition is a bit inconsistent, especially when it comes to perspective: http://i.imgur.com/itOOc4U.jpg All the main perspective lines are acting differently, which makes the piece feel inconsistent.  Finally, a suggestion rather than criticism, you should try to make use of the stroke direction to define shapes, movement, moods and other things."
painting,3dqy42,DearQuaker,3,Sat Jul 18 20:33:14 2015 UTC,This looks amazing!  I agree with other commenters about more detail helping. A simple way to add some more would be to put a stroke of stark white on the highlights to make them pop. Great work!

painting,3dqy42,myklwells,2,Sat Jul 18 16:57:21 2015 UTC,"Good choice of color and a nice sense of atmosphere, but I'll echo the other comments and say your final touches should be in making something in the piece the subject. Right now my eye dances around but doesn't really land anywhere. Nothing really hits me as having a stronger value or color than the rest of the piece. Figure out what element is the focus and put all your effort there. Make rich tonal contrasts and maybe even a touch more detail in that one area. Most of your painting is pretty much finished."
painting,3dqy42,Everline,2,Sat Jul 18 21:05:57 2015 UTC,"You've handled this painting well I would call it finished and move on. Though a lot of people like your choice of colors the pallet could actually be improved, it's dominated by primary colors which have a lot of chroma and are vibrant and exciting but it's immature. I'm not saying that as an insult but it is the typical pallet of a painter who is just starting. That said you handled the primaries beautifully and I think you have an innate color sense that will develop and improve in time, so don't worry about it. It's hard to ""see"" your own work, try looking at the reversed image in a mirror."

Do you want to paint illustrative things (people, places, etc) or do you want to paint to explore the paint, colour, basic composition?  Personally, I'm always a fan of learning how to draw cause it's just useful.  But if you don't really care about not drawing recognisable things, then you can absolutely paint without drawing experience, especially since drawing isn't for everybody and rigid learning of traditional drawings skills might just put you off making art in general as it's more about technicalities than fun exploration.  This is coming from someone that loves to and draws quite a bit, btw.  But it's not for everyone."
painting,3drizs,ANTELOGI,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:50:15 2015 UTC,"My recommendation would be to learn to draw first. It's not impossible to learn painting from scratch but anatomy, perspective, proportion, value...Etc are all important things that you will need to understand to paint anything realistic. Drawing is a fantastic way to learn and figure out some of those things with the color and physical application of paint removed to make them easier. Jumping into painting is trying not to keep 40 things in mind at all times, drawing removes 20 of them so that you can have an easier time getting the first half down. That's not to say that you couldn't do both if you're antsy about getting to the painting but I can't imagine not having learned drawing first."
painting,3drizs,henryfrank1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:55:29 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you draw. When you were first starting, how did you learn?"
painting,3drizs,henryfrank1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:16:20 2015 UTC,"I ended up going to art school and taking a bunch of classes but before that just practice practice practice. There are a few great books to start with. Harold Speed has good ones, my favorites are all by Andrew Loomis, I found them as downloads for free since they were all out of print, though I think they've recently republished them. There are some great blogs like James Gurneys. Mostly just filling up sketchbooks with observational drawing is the big part. There are probably some figure or intro drawing classes in your area too."
painting,3drizs,bmc1010,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:19:43 2015 UTC,"I was in the middle of learning to draw (er not the middle skill wise, still new) when I started on paint.  For whatever reason painting just took over.  I still sketch a decent amount, usually with charcoal, but mostly as a means to get ready for a painting or when I'm on the go or waiting for the painting I'm working on to dry etc.  I just never got the hang of making my drawings look finished at all.  I feel like drawing and painting have a lot of over lap, but I'm not sure one is needed before the other.  It's my opinion that you should probably do both if your real interest is painting.  For me at least I feel like I would have practiced less if I had stuck to drawing only until I moved to paint.  Motivation to keep working on it and learning is really the hardest part for me, so I try and give myself every advantage and do what I find fun and motivational.  All that being said I do feel like the ""drawing"" part of my painting is where I struggle the most, so maybe I'm pointing in the wrong direction!  :D"
painting,3drizs,myklwells,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:11:44 2015 UTC,"Learning to draw is a foundation skill. I think it's so important that it should be taught in school along with reading, arithmetic, and writing. It teaches one to observe and think visually. You will be glad you learned to draw, it's very powerful tool."

Have fun with it, the important thing is to enjoy the activity. That will drive you to start to develop your skills. And for god's sake don't worry about if it's good or not. Just waste that paper, blow through it. Play exquisite corpse with your friends. After that there are a number of good books, drawing on the right side of the brain comes to mind and there are a number of great Youtube videos, after that, take a drawing class."
painting,3dqvbt,parab0loid,2,Sat Jul 18 16:07:32 2015 UTC,"Idk why people discouraged you from using oil. I've been working with oil on plexiglass with great results. You can easily control transparency, and you can carefully dry brush the oil with a soft brush to remove brush strokes. If you're using simple shapes I'd even suggest taping off the areas you wanted painting that little lip of the paint may be enough that with generous use of a drying medium like liquin, you may be able to lay it flat and have the paint ""self-level"" that would be the most uniform application. I really want to see what youre working on, I've considered a similar idea but never got around to exploring it. Please post your progress."

painting,3dqvbt,fgrissim78,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"that depends, not long tho. transparent pigments dry faster. it will be a factor of how thin you apply the paint, the medium, and your environment. I'd guess no more then a day for them to be workably dry."

Use thick lines to separate planes or objects and thin ones for details/ornamentation"

painting,3dgu4q,carly_kins,3,Thu Jul 16 10:01:43 2015 UTC,"This is extremely awesome! The mountains look great and it is all just so serene!  My one critique is to make sure to mix your paint rather than using tube paint without mixing, especially in the middle ground. The lime-y color is a little bit harsh in the middle and probably needs to be toned down a bit. I see some straight ultramarines and burnt siennas in the foreground too.  Trust me, when my teacher pretty much forced my class to stop using the paint straight out of the tube in order to make a set color scheme on our palette, our paintings had so much more depth.  Keep up the good work! Never stop painting!!"

painting,3dgu4q,brundlefly93,2,Thu Jul 16 14:38:45 2015 UTC,One more thing I would add is that the foreground grasses seem a little dark. Since they lie on the ground plane they should be lighter than the closest mountains and way lighter than the trees

For me, the negative space doesn't work.  The brushstrokes on the left side of the canvas create movement but it also makes it look somewhat one dimensional.

EDIT: as far as criticism goes, I think you'd benefit from going over the foreground a couple more times, get some more details in there. The background is perfect, but if the foreground was more defined, I think it would really sink back, while your foreground would really pop. Maybe some mid tones in the trees too."

I still feel really really new at those too, and I know I'm backward from the way most people start. Really precise details have always been tough for me. I feel like my hand is nowhere near steady enough to get the job done, and I have a difficult time getting my brush to get to the fine point it needs to be to do that sort of thing, Even if they're size 0 brushes! Any thoughts on how to achieve the steadiness in my hand or maybe getting better control of the brush?"
painting,3db9ip,termhn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:43:17 2015 UTC,"I think doing multi-discipline art could help. For example, my primary traditional medium right now is ink & marker, and practicing inking using a brush pen really helps train you to have a confident, steady hand as well as control pressure. Look into getting one of these and just practicing with keeping a steady line/curve with the same line weight. You could also just get another size 0 brush and some black ink/paint and do the same thing using that."
painting,3db9ip,BrotherofFiesta,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"well depending on what type of line you are looking to achieve, you can tape of lines, insuring a consistent and even line (in value and size). Or just practice, practice, practice. You should do this at all times, despite what type of lines you are trying to achieve."
painting,3ddhby,glmartin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:24:40 2015 UTC,"Here's what I would do:  First cover the area you want to paint with an interior acrylic primer. For best quality, I would go with Behr, sold at Home Depot: http://www.behr.com/consumer/products/interior-paint-and-primer/behr-premium-plus-interior-stain-blocking-primer-and-sealer  See if you can borrow a projector for making sure the map is exactly positioned on the wall, then use a pencil or light coat of acrylic paint to outline the major points, such as the cities, mountains and rivers. If you can't find a projector and try to free-hand it, this will add many hours and a lot of frustration to the project.  For painting the map, I would use either Golden High Flow acrylics or Liquitex soft body acrylics. These will be easiest to spread over a wall surface, and will leave little raised texture. Any paintbrush purchased at an art store will be fine, but keep in mind, the cheapest brushes tend to lose their bristles faster. If you don't want to be picking bristles out of your painting, probably spend at least $3 per brush. You should only need maybe 3 for this project of varying sizes.  When you've finished your painting, seal it with an acrylic varnish. You can either use a spray varnish (I recommend Liquitex Gloss Varnish), or paint on a varnish. I've had bad experiences with paint-on varnish though, as it can dry quickly and leave little white bubbles in your painting."

painting,3dbfo6,thefoxhole,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:41:34 2015 UTC,"What kind of paint were you using before?   Water soluble mediums and all the requisite supplies will be cheaper than something oil-based. With acrylic paint, you can buy a bottle of retarder additive that will slow the drying time. There's also watercolor and gouache.   To save money, paint on board or heavy paper prepped with gesso instead of canvases. Mix your own colors instead of buying a ton of tubes of paint.   Really cheap art supply sets break easily, don't have enough pigment to make it worth your while, and generally don't behave the way they should. My personal go-to method of figuring out art supplies when trying out something new is to google for ""beginning painting class supply list"" and you'll get a lot of syllabi from lots of art schools. They usually have brands, brush types, paint colors, etc to look for, and the cost is at the lower end of average because they're for students, but because they're for college level art classes, the recommended materials are decent enough quality to behave properly."

I love that it's not ""painted to death"" but there are parts that the viewer's brain has to complete - therefore looking at the painting is an active process. The cow really seems to look at you which intensifies the effect - and which is completely different in your unsmeared version.  I think I would like it even better if the sky was a little bit less smeared so it doesn't distract from the curious cow.   I love it! I would hang it on my wall straightaway. :D"

It's this gunk you paint onto paper that prevents the actual paint from absorbing into the paper, and then when you're done painting, you peel off the masking fluid and the paper underneath is clean and white.  I love it because it makes lines using gouache or watercolor less frustrating, and also because it is so satisfying to peel off."

Sort of like what you did with those orangish flowers in the top right.  The other thing is, if these flowers are existing on a plane, whether a wall or a table, then the shadow behind them should be more defined.  Other than that, keep working on painting, you definitely have a knack for it! And if you haven't already, try other styles of painting that you feel uncomfortable with (use to be abstract for me), you may learn to like them (...I love abstract)."

painting,3d75i5,brandon0010,2,Tue Jul 14 01:22:48 2015 UTC,"I've never watched any Bob Ross videos (a crime, I know) so I'm not familiar with the supplies he uses, but I can take you through a few of my essentials.   Medium- I use Jenkins' Happy Medium pretty often, which is a premixed combination of linseed oil and turpenoid. I found a few bottles in that had been sitting in my college's art building for a long time. They appear to be pretty old so the company may be out of business. Regardless, it would be very easy to recreate. Often I add dammar varnish to my medium mixture for a slightly faster drying time and increased glossiness. I'd recommend making this no more than 1/3 of your medium mixture.   Brushes- I use Princeton bristle brushes and Winsor Newton sables primarily, though I've heard that Trekell makes wonderful brushes as well. For sloppier pieces I use cheap Artist's Loft brushes so I'm not worried about destroying anything expensive.   Paints- I've tried several brands of paint and vastly prefer Grumbacher. The pigments are very strong and their warm earthy colors are wonderful.   Palette- I use a sheet of glass I got from a big picture frame at the thrift store. The smooth surface is excellent for mixing colors, and if you work from photos you can place your references under the glass for easy color matching. If you use a glass palette, I'd recommend getting a razor blade paint scraper for cleanup, I got mine at Lowe's for $2.   The only ""unconventional"" instrument I use is a sponge. It makes texturing very easy, especially for stone or other porous subjects.   I hope some of this was helpful. It's always nice to see people begin working with oils. Happy painting!"
painting,3d75i5,NW_Coffey,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:57:42 2015 UTC,"That was extremely helpful! Do you order the paints and brushes online, or is there a store that supplies those brands?"

painting,3d6qr8,papagert,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:30:21 2015 UTC,"Just for a more appropriate terminology, I would refer to it as ""representational"" as opposed to ""photorealistic"". The later is really reserved for a specific genre.  That said, I'm glad you're using more paint to cover the canvas, really the next step is adding white(lighter like lights, darker darks)! For early attempts, it seems people forget how bright lights are, even reflected. The definition of your forms is a stylistic decision, no beef, but more variation in the tint would help the viewers eyes. Keep up that growth"

Struggling to come up with a suggestion, this is the only I could conjure: spend more time painting the details of close objects.

painting,3d1bzx,ArbitraryCommentary,2,Sun Jul 12 22:11:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I completely agree, I hope it becomes more realistic over time with some practice. I struggled really bad with the ""land"" areas. Which is why there is only one pathetic attempt at the bottom right of the painting. A lot of why there isn't more detail is that I made a mistake at the very beginning and put wayyyy too much of a base paint (linseed oil and titanium white). That really screwed with me the whole time. Anyway, I appreciate it, and will definitely post my next one to see if I have improved at all."
painting,3d1bzx,xoemmytee,3,Sun Jul 12 23:57:49 2015 UTC,"You did wonderfully well... The only advice I can give (after 18 years of the same drive) is there is no substitute for looking at the object you're painting. The colors, shadows, the way your eyes create 3-D. Be they land aread or hand areas, study gives correct detail, there are things light does we could never imagine without looking first. I still put pure oil over pure oil at the end of a painting (I know... fat over lean..), for a bit details are still applicable if desired. Often i Like to use oil in its' pure form for the entirety of the painting. It's workable for a few weeks, then becomes a solid mass of interwoven molecules, much different than acrylics. If you wanted you could still add, but it really does look great. It might serve better as a reflection of #1, painting is about learning and growing, not bad (or common) to get a triple on your first at bat."

painting,3d5dmg,HowDoIMove,2,Mon Jul 13 17:35:04 2015 UTC,It depends on the opacity of the paint you are going to use and the number of layers. I would suggest using Mars black as it is very opaque and will dry to a relatively matte finish.
painting,3d5dmg,thesmallestpizza,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:56:34 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be an issue, HB Pencil doesn't show through as long as the lines are light and the paint isn't too cheap or diluted. I have had instances in the past where I used an ebony pencil (for whatever harebrained reason) , didn't erase it enough and it mixed with lighter hued paints and messed up the color a bit. But a little overpainting took care of that easily.  If I'm worried about keeping to a line and not being able to see the pencil, I just cut painters masking tape to mask the hard line area, and seal it with a little bit of clear matte medium before painting. Experiment on some scrap with this and see if it works for you."

painting,3d466o,jakestrangle99,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:27:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks! If you're just starting out, buy some nice brushes intended for acrylic. They'll last longer and serve you better if you keep them clean. All you need is a little soap and water.   Don't squeeze out too much at one time. Acrylic dries quickly, so you have to work much faster compared to oil. Some acrylics darken when they dry, so keep that in mind. Acrylic is pretty versatile, so I would simply experiment and see what you like best. If you want to know more about fluid acrylics, feel free to send me a PM."

painting,3cy9gv,jtaylor0313,5,Sat Jul 11 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"The first one is pretty straight forward and plain, nothing too much to critique there. The second one looks a little messy because of all the different brown tones and the hectic brush strokes in the background and the lines in the foreground. you could try to even the background out a little and maybe use another colour, that is not found in the actual figure. (like you did with the fish, you used complementary colors) Also, the rooster's proportions are not right, his head is too big. try to make a decent sketch from reference first and then put it to the canvas.  another thing is, you shouldn't use chinese characters when you can't actually write chinese... either copy them from a print out or learn the strokes from a video or something. The paintings would work just as well without the ""exotic"" touch of the writing. just put more thought and work into colors and anatomy/references.  did you just start painting? I don't mean to be harsh, they are quite nice for a beginner :)"
painting,3cy9gv,hanseak,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:08:05 2015 UTC,Yes. i bought some paints and canvas from walmart. My first one looks like a 5th grader tried to paint a landscape. These are so much better. I really liked the erratic background on the rooster cause it made me think of rooster scratches but i agree totally on the brown. What other color(s) could I have used though? i thought maybe reddish but I didn't wanna take away from the heads vibrant color. Thank you for your input.
painting,3cy9gv,hanseak,2,Sun Jul 12 06:08:59 2015 UTC,"I do think you did a good job on these, you are heading in a promising direction! I understand why you like the background. It has a nice effect of different brush strokes and colors that overlay each other. But this type of background would have worked better with a one-dimensional figure like the fish, that has one solid color.   maybe it's not so much the brown color itself, that collides with the foreground, but its value / temperature. You know, how colors can seem to be warmer /colder, or just lighter and darker. It might help the composition to just tone the background down (or even it out) with a layer of ochre, beige or yellow. What would really make the head pop though, would be a turquoise, green-bluish color. and all of that should be more on the brighter side, since the rooster is in itself rather dark.  For next time, to help you figure out the values of your painting, you can just take a picture of the canvas in black-and-white mode and check if certain parts, that are important to you, pop out by being very dark or very light. That adds more depth to it and is a simple way to make it more interesting to look at.  hope to see more soon! cheers"

It's not so much the type of paint he's using as it is some of the techniques he's using to paint. It looks like he's mixing a few colors together but not completely mixing them into a unified color, just to a point of being ""marbled"". Then he probably smears them on the canvas with a palette knife. Once again, I'm no expert in this field, but if I wanted to recreate this look that's what I would do. I know that it's easily done in oils, and i'm 94.8% sure you could do this with acrylics as well."

You're 100% right about the advice you gave in regards to understanding light and shadow and the larger shapes of the face. At the moment, your details are much cleaner than the complexity of your planes. That tells me you've been more bogged down in neatly rendering the details than focusing on the planes of the face. Much of her face and neck feel a little too simplified and flat. Consider using temperature or value shifts to give the form more depth. Your ability to draw is obvious! Don't let that stand in your way of seeing her as she really is.   Bare in mind, the better the work, the harder its critiqued in the sub! you've done a great job. Keep it up!"

painting,3css4o,free_ipod,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:07:48 2015 UTC,What do you recommend to start doing portraits like that? Do you have any resources that help you? Also what medium is this?
painting,3css4o,blazik,3,Fri Jul 10 19:52:18 2015 UTC,"I've spent a lot of time studying how other people paint. For me, very inspirational and helpful are painters such as William Oxer, Alyssa Monks, Anna Rose, Emily Miller (aka Femily Killer) and Sergej Gusev - just to name a few.   Before you start make yourself familiar with the face. Try to understand why there are certain shadows, why some points are illuminated etc. I feel it's crucially important to train your eye. When you start, don't pay much attention to details first, rather try to ignore them because if you don't, you can spend you whole life on the perfect shape of a chin never finishing a painting.   Try to capture the shadows and the lightnings, the rough shapes first. I also find it helpful to almost close your eyes, so you can't focus and everything looks blurred, when you compare the shapes of your painting and your reference, because it blocks out the details. (I guess I look funny when I paint .. :D )  I think in a portrait it's more important to capture a feauture that is outstanding in a person's face, this is why it's necessary to study it first. What catches your attention? Is it the bright smile? The certain look in the eyes? How does the person seem? Shy? Bold? Cheeky? I feel it's more important to capture this unique impression than painting a fotorealistic portrait. Because this is what cameras are for ... in my opinion. ;)  This portrait is acrylic on canvas."
painting,3css4o,fgrissim78,2,Fri Jul 10 20:45:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I think I have a pretty good eye already (I draw a lot, and have done some portraits) but there's always room to improve I guess.   My main concern is the medium. I'm trying to get into painting but I don't really understand how to do certain things with paint. Like how do you get the colours to blend like they do? Are you doing the blending while the paint is wet, or do you do glazes, or do you just wait for it to dry and then paint a new layer? I have a lot of trouble with that kind of stuff."
painting,3css4o,dawnoftheshed,2,Fri Jul 10 20:53:20 2015 UTC,"You're welcome :) I'm glad if I can help.  When painting with acrylics I try to blend it while it's still wet. But I rarely finish a painting in one sitting so often I have to blend on dry paint, and then I find it easier to work with a really small amount of paint on a relatively dry brush.   I'm currently experimenting with oil paint which can be thinned down with water and which can be mixed (at least I do it) with acrylics and this works very well! They don't dry as quickly as acrylics do so you have more time to play around and blend the colors, but not so slow as 'real' oil colors. http://www.artsuppliesdirect.com/images/products/detail/ArtisanOil37ml.jpg"
painting,3css4o,done-gone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:09:08 2015 UTC,I know a bit about oil paints although I don't know much about technique. Instead of using water to thin oils you should use linseed oil or a medium. Water is good for thinning acrylics but not as much for oils. When the oils dry completely it is likely to crack and not last as long as with mediums.

painting,3cqesm,indiadamjones,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"Well, they've already mentioned about the texture of the canvas coming through.  I recommend using a heavy body gesso to kill that texture in a single step priming action with a large putty knife, like for spreading drywall mud.  Heavy body means it won't shrink when it dries.  That's not a rule by the way, just for most people they prefer not to have the texture distract them.  You never know when you might wish to conceptually allow some of that texture through.  In painting, always remember you can do anything you want, but I often go ahead and work more volume of paint.  Kind of like don't be bashful with paint.  There's a lot of things working for you in this painting.  I have a sense of the 3D space from the drop shadow under the dog, and the glow above helps push the subject out from the background.  There seems some variation of mark making texture on the foreground which helps establish a stable ground plane.  While the blue on the back wall seems even application gives an atmospheric effect.  All the colors in this seem mixed a little to subtle hues, instead of just looking like someone applied straight from the tube.  There seems some amount of realism to the subject, I can't determine if this from life a photo, your imagination, or a combination of those.  Of course if you can paint from life, you'll find that it seems challenging, but yields excellent results.  The placement on the page has a balanced harmony, and my eye moves over the image without agitation.  For example it looks like the dog is laying on something.  Lot of first timers would have that guy floating in outer space.  Anyway, great start, and if you can try to gesso and sand and prepare the canvas, you can experience too.  Oh yeah!  Don't paint for friends n family, if you cherish your sanity, just my opinion.  Good luck!"
painting,3cqesm,indiadamjones,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:42:08 2015 UTC,"Excellant, thanks for the feedback!  I am going to get some Gesso and supplies this morning.  I thought initially that the canvas coming through was normal as the canvas I bought said it had a ""double gesso primed"" surface.  I would have a decent artistic eye as I have been a photographer for years so my ability to know good angles, positioning etc should be ok.  It's more learning how to layer and in general, paint!  It's definitely more difficult than i thought but not too difficult that it is inaccessible.  I got a decent feel of gratification with this so I am looking forward to future endeavours.    Thanks again for the wonderful advice and feedback!  :D"
painting,3cqesm,papagert,2,Sat Jul 11 08:14:38 2015 UTC,"I have a whole tub of the fancy stuff from Liquitex, and I'm struggling to finish up a Jimi Hendrix portrait right now.  This stuff looks like Desitin and has like zero shrinkage, so you can get the canvas prep out of the way fairly quick.  The canvases at the store usually have the most minimal application of gesso, and you can also buy rolls of canvas which often have a coat of gesso as well.  I usually keep my eye on craigslist, because you can get super good deals on canvas.  One thing that is still challenging for me is finding affordable frames that match my painting dimensions.  This seems almost uncanny how difficult.  There's got to be a secret, I just don't know it.  A framed painting looks bananas compared to an unframed painting.  My next attempt at this challenge, I intend to get the damn frame FIRST!"

painting,3cq841,eklofbjorn,15,Thu Jul 9 22:11:39 2015 UTC,"They're called ""keys"" and they're used to tighten the canvas. You hammer them into the slots in the corners of the wood on the back of the canvas.  EDIT: I also found this tip from an old forum post -- ""They should be put in place before you use your canvas, as they add strength to the corners of the bars. Just push them in with your fingers if the canvas is already tight. The reason you need them, is that both the bars and the canvas, expands and contracts as humidity changes and the canvas can become slack due to this action. A light tap with a small hammer on the keys will tighten it up again."""

painting,3cphbj,mmcpaint,2,Fri Jul 10 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"I'm a noob and also about to dive into figures. I think the simplest and best explanation of how to approach them I've found is to just paint carrots on a practice board and then put heads (dots) on them. Here's a post on wetcanvas about it, and even though he's specifically speaking about watercolors here I think it translates into oil/acrylic as well. Seago did a lot of carrot people in oils and he was pretty good, so...  ps - nice painting :)"

painting,3cnvz0,octotopo,2,Thu Jul 9 10:53:16 2015 UTC,How was painting this in acrylic a different process than in oils? To me it looks similar to your other works--I'm curious whether you approached it differently.
painting,3cnvz0,kandoit,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:38:47 2015 UTC,to be honest my approach is kinda chaotic I look at some of my acrylic stuff from a few months ago and I can't remember how  I went about painting that compared to what I've done more recently.  I will say that this piece was fairly similar to how I've been painting with the oils though I had to put things down a lot a faster because the paint dries so quickly. I wasn't able to get the blending that I wanted either but I blame that more or just being tired and rushing. did that answer your question ? or would you like to know what my process is ?

painting,3cl4r3,awkwardtuna,2,Tue Jul 21 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much.    Funny enough, I didn't feel as though the blending was as smooth as I had desired. I did use several layers of glazing; and found that the best blending actually resulted from patting/dabbing small amounts of color on, rather than trying to brush & smooth it out. I also used Golden's OPEN paints for this portrait and seriously fell in love! Since they don't dry as fast as standard acrylic, I had more room for blending colors on the canvas.     Also, before I painted the portrait, I added a thick layer of gesso and sanded that - honestly, I made the surface too smooth when I did this which caused some of my issues when I was working on the painting. Next time, I definitely wont sand it as much, but I do like this prep since it gives a smoother surface."

painting,3chw2m,FartingBedpost,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:15:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   I add the white first and use it to scrub the blue out of the way. The sky is a very thinned down wash of blue, then I use a much thicker white on the brush and scrub it in so it actually becomes a pretty thin layer of paint. I'll do that a couple times before adding any color to the cloud."

painting,3chw2m,TinyDream,2,Wed Jul 8 01:23:14 2015 UTC,"Beautifully soft! The cool and warm shadows are great next to each other. Definitely gives the impression of secondary lighting. If I were to offer critique, then I'd say fiddle with the contrast. The lights of the cloud are close in tone to the shadows and to really make everything pop you may need to darken the core shadows. Or even darken the sky. Though it may seem counterintuitive, clouds can be really dark. Like the ones in Nicolas Poussin's Assumption of the Virgin. But again, I like what you've got here!"

painting,3cde7y,FrigidPhoenix,5,Tue Jul 7 01:13:43 2015 UTC,Some of the master painters did incredibly vivid and colorful work with a very limited number of pigments. You certainly can go a very long way with what you have for oils now. It can be good to limit yourself when learning because it forces you to learn how to achieve a color you want and also forces you to not use paint straight out of the tube which can lend to better overall color. But its also fun to have more paints to play with. It's really a preference thing. If you use a limited pallet you will need to spend some time learning how to get what you want out of it. Check out this site: http://sensuallogic.com/paintmaker/OnlinePaintMixer.html
painting,3cde7y,J_T_KIRK,3,Tue Jul 7 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"This is the obvious answer, but I would like to offer a nuanced opinion; its good to have a single/few mixed colors to use with your standard pallet because it can offer your particular aesthetic some signature flavour.  In my acrylic set I stick to the basics + a fancy teal that makes my blues and greens look more u/papagert. It is a preference thing but if you love a premix color mix with it often and refrain from out-of-the-tubing it."

painting,3ca43p,geojenly,4,Mon Jul 6 08:02:20 2015 UTC,"This is actually pretty cool. Don't worry so much about perfectly straight lines, those are for graphic designers and computer software. What you've done is more than good enough, most non-artists will not notice, and artist that might notice will be aware of the futility of creating perfectly straight lines with a brush stroke.   If you are concerned about it, you can use masking tape to mark the edges you want. You would want to sketch out the lines first, and then take it one block at a time. Paint one in, take the tape off, wait for it to dry, then lay down more tape for the next block. It will be pretty tedious, I personally think what you've done is rather good."

This is the best one you've shared so far, and with your commitment I highly doubt it will be the best one that you ever paint.   If I can offer a critique I'd say that the mountains are too dark. The further away things are the lighter they appear. The furthest patch of trees is lighter than the mountains, which shouldn't be the case since the trees in the foreground are black.

Unlike some new landsacpe artists who try to be to strict the painting has a life you can nearly feel as you gaze at it. The background is rather dark compared to the foreground, which makes it feel slightly squashed to me. Other than lightening and maybe having some more details in the foreground or less details in the background (to create the illusion of distance more firmly) I can't think of any suggestions. Just my two cents, and please take it or leave it, you've really done a great job. It is a wonderfully expressive and stylishly done piece that is really interesting to look at!

painting,3c2uwi,Default_Admin,2,Sat Jul 4 06:13:53 2015 UTC,"One reason this image reads as completely flat is because the textures shapes and lighting you've used don't change at all from the background to the foreground. Look at how your grass at the very back seems to sit on the edge of nothing, its because it is about the same size as some of your other vegetation in the front. These features should degrease in size in the background. Also look at how the lighting on the trees and the texture is exactly the same on each. You should darken the lighting on the trees and lessen the amount of texture on the trees toward the horizon. Texture registers as details to the eye and reducing the amount of details you can see will make the trees in the back appear farther, same goes for darkening them which ads depth to the perspective. While the trees you have do decrease in size somewhat, remember that trees in a real horizon will decrease in size until they are too small to be seen, meaning you need a full range of sizes whereas you have one slice of the depth. Also, a sky should generally never be mottled but rather be gradated with reference to the position of the sun, at this position the sky would be much brighter closer to the sun than the areas closer to the horizon and top corners of the painting. Also, your birds on the left side have highlights on their tops even though the sun is beneath them. The sun should also be far more circular."

Edit: thank you for the mental image of arms with elbows at nipple height and wrists at the waist. Now I know what a human tyrannosaurus looks like"

As for the proportions and actual figure everything is intentional. I'm a caricature artist and am trying to paint her body as I perceive it, not as it actually is. I was looking for criticism on actual painting technique and lighting. Can you be more specific about the variance of the lighting. I feel like its mostly coming from the top right with a little bit of bounced light from behind her. Thanks for your criticism."

There isn't and vegetation so I can't really see how the land flows, there isn't any difference in color, it's just plain green and plain blue. The clouds don't really have form. You drop the mountains in right on the ground.  Try some youtube tutorials, don't copy (or do, but using your own skills and imagination will give you a better understanding), but watch the way they use the brush and how it affects the canvas to achieve a certain affect."

It did have more variance, but I saw some canvas showing through and painted over with one green, so it was diminished a bit.     and plain blue.   The sky is intentionally clear. There was no need to blend in other colors.     You drop the mountains in right on the ground.   This just confuses me. Where else would they connect to?"
painting,3c2hge,Default_Admin,2,Sun Jul 5 22:27:46 2015 UTC,"When I paint, I try and use differences in the grass by adding yellow/dark green/bright green/brown/grey. Any variation of those. I also try to implement grass and flowers. See how in this field there are variations in the grass, a rock, some dirt spots, and bushes? It makes it look natural.  With the sky, it looks unnatural. The real sky has variation in the blue. Look at the sky, see how it gets brighter closer toward the ground?  The mountains shouldn't lay flat on the ground. It should fade in. Bob Ross used a fog layer at the bottom of the mountain because of the pollution and air visibility. Just as an example. See the fog toward the bottom of the mountain?"

painting,3bux7x,ProductofUnreality,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:55:15 2015 UTC,Also the higher grade ends up giving you more quantity since it's not so thinned down. Since there's mor woof meant you can add acrylic medium or water to stretch the longevity of your paints. Plus you can get better impasto effects.

This picture that I'm painting from is in a book that walks a newbie  through the basics of painting. Im going to be doing a few more from this book, I'll post them as I complete them.

painting,3brzzw,titoleebop84,3,Wed Jul 1 17:56:26 2015 UTC,"When I do gradients or highlight/shadow, I start with the base color and mix my highlight color into it, gradually blending in more highlight until I have the desired effect.  It takes practice to make smooth transitions, and it's harder to do with acrylics than oil or watercolor, but it can be done to great effect.  Here is an acrylic painting I did that shows off smooth gradients and highlights."
painting,3brzzw,MarcusDrakus,2,Wed Jul 1 21:16:57 2015 UTC,"You can mix something called Matte Medium into your acrylic paints so they don't dry so shiny. It also makes your paint dry a bit more slowly in my experience, and allows you to create a more textured surface. I use this: http://www.michaels.com/golden-artist-colors-matte-medium/M10196746.html"
painting,3brzzw,kandoit,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:45:43 2015 UTC,"To do a hightlight that is reasonably simple, you just need some practise. Start by mixing up a nice brown and paint in the whole figure. When working with brown you will want to add yellow to make it lighter or blue to make it darker. Once you get to the highlight area, just put a small bit of yellow on your brush and mix it with the brown in the on the neck. You can do this right on the canvas as long as the brown is still wet. Keep adding yellow untill it is light enough. Remember acrylics dry darker."

painting,3blayt,Stop_throwing_doors,6,Tue Jun 30 03:39:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know what kind of paintings you're looking to do. If it's landscapes you should just start with the basics.  Titanium White (a lot, and get an artist's quality white)  Ultramarine Blue (a lot)  Permanent Alizarin Crimson  Burnt Sienna  Burnt Umber  Cadmium Red Medium  Cadmium Yellow Light (a lot ((for your greens))  Phthalo Blue (optional but nice for water, different greens)  Prussian Blue (optional but nice for night skies, different greens)  White Gesso depending on your surface  1 inch flat brush  2 inch house painting brush, nothing special  Small round brush for detail  Round hog bristle size 10-12 for foliage stippling if that's your thing  Fan brush for grass etc  Rigger brush  Palette Knife, shanked blade  Board is cheaper than canvas to paint on, you just need to rough it up with coarse sandpaper and thinly gesso it to get the tooth you want. Also you can do both sides when you're just starting out because you'll want to paint over your first few anyway most likely.  If you're more into watercolours and want to know what you'll need I'd say just watch this."

painting,3blayt,headcrab1991,4,Wed Jul 1 17:47:35 2015 UTC,"I started painting with acrylics.  Pros: It's easy to handle, you don't have to use any additional solvents, it's cheap, it dries fast. It's easy to understand how the material behaves. It's forgiving and you can paint over things easier because of the dry time.  Cons: It can be a bit dull colorwise, it dries fast (a little trickier to blend but still possible), it kills your brushes quicker than oils (use cheap brushes), not as pretty as oils    For me it was easier to get into it because I could just mix a few colors and go and not have to worry about turpentine smell, masks and getting oil on me because I'm clumsy. But today, a few years later I paint only in oils because I like it much more.  If you don't already do it, draw. This will help your paintings in almost every regard. One could argue that working in B&W can even help with color!"

painting,3bf2j3,NedTaggart,2,Sun Jun 28 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"This is my second painting. I have learned things that I would do differently. For this one I painted the main elements, then tried to lay in some supporting elements. This was a mistake. I should have worked from the furthest away up to the closest.  I'm not very happy with the water lines. They don't work for me and I wish I had figured them out before putting in the dock. I also should have paid more attention to size. The dock is larger than I had intended.  I'm not unhappy with the overall colors. The light is pretty raw, I should have tried to tone that back some. I am happy with the texture of the dock, I wanted it rough, like old wood. I tried to give the poles dimension, I'm not sure if it worked. I'm if two minds about the shadows. I like that they are semi transparent and retain the texture of the dock (I let the dock dry for a few days before adding them). I'm not sure what is going on with the two-tone shadows though. Maybe one side was loaded with a bit more paint than the other.  Anyway, that's painting 2. I'll work on 3 this week."
painting,3bf2j3,lacious213,4,Sun Jun 28 17:31:11 2015 UTC,"I like it but I agree about the coloring of the light. It almost looks green to me on the water.  I think there is some inconsistencies between your light source and your shadows. Your light source is in the center of the dock, and the highlights on the poles show that correctly, but then the shadows from the two poles are falling as if the light is coming from the right side of the painting."
painting,3bf2j3,a1rpla1nju1ce,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:17:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, I noticed that too about the shadows. One of the big things on this one is composition. I'm going to have to put much more thought into planning these. This would have had much better composition had I followed rule of thirds, with the light source in the top right third and the dock on the left third.   I have to stop winging it with ideas and actually plan the layout."

painting,3bgq2o,Default_Admin,2,Mon Jun 29 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"It depends on the teacher. The benefits is that they can catch you in the moment and help correct things you may not be consciously aware of. There are no secrets but there are plenty of basic little things that are usually taken for granted by working professionals. Things so basic artists do them without much thought simply because they've been doing them for so long. A teacher, at least a good one, would be able to see what trouble you might be having and help explain those basic little things. These little things can be things like knowing what a well loaded brush feels like, or a good way to stand at an easel.  In a passive learning environment, like with an online school for example, it's more trial and error. The execution is diagnosed and you sort of review what happened. The active learning of a classroom does have its own trials but it catches the errors as they happen. You're really learning as you go. So it also depends on if you're comfortable learning in an active or passive environment."
painting,3bgq2o,LeEpicTrollchan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:12:57 2015 UTC,"Great question! (warning drunk opinion here) 99% of fine art programs today won't give you much beyond a very rudimentary exposure to the fundamentals of drawing and painting in an environment of brooding, young folk who are as concerned with art as they are with finally proving to themselves, their friends, and most importantly to their parents they are unique and special individuals. Usually while doing so, the program will shit talk the pursuit of real painting techniques, while encouraging you to swing for the fences and make avant garde, contemporary art. You'll study progressive artist and be encouraged to emulate that style of work while completely overlooking the arduous path of work those celebrated artist took to arrive at their final style or movement. Most art schools are selling a vibe, a vision, and a quick fix hope at making it big. This agenda is reinforced by a college schedule and curriculum that doesn't foster an environment that could train and produce proficient artist. Learning to paint well in a semester or two is impossible. ITS NOT ALL BAD THOUGH! The point of a BFA is to develop your critical thinking skills and expose you to new avenues of thought, provide context of past works, and motivate you to go on and be the next big movement. Still, too many baristas with BFAs are paying off their college loans with no idea why their work isn't working and blaming the system for their short-comings. Hardcore painting techniques are taught at Ateliers, through apprenticeships, and via exposure to other serious artist and communities. Beware though as these groups can be stubbornly small minded and stuck in their classical niche. There is a happy place between art school and Atelier-- You need the forward thought and exposure of the contemporary art scene coupled with the endless forced hours on the easel of an Atelier. Somewhere between those two mentalities is the proper art education.  Sorry for the rant, to answer your question: you don't need art college to teach you to paint and draw, still if you've got 80 grand lying around it maybe a fun way to spend 4 years."
painting,3bgq2o,fgrissim78,2,Mon Jun 29 02:47:26 2015 UTC,"Don't be sorry man, you gave some great insight. Personally, if I take an art class, it will be at a community college. But at the moment, it's hard enough to find time to paint with a baby around... or is he a toddler yet (5 months)? So, when and if I get around to it, I think it will be a good experience. I also thing that with a certain passion, I can totally figure it out on my own."
painting,3bgq2o,Kblueism,2,Mon Jun 29 03:27:20 2015 UTC,"I know not all colleges are the same, and I hope you didn't have a bad experience, but I have to say that none of what you wrote is accurate to either of the colleges I studied fine arts at.  No art professor worth their salt would encourage a student to pursue a style that wasn't his or her own, no matter how ""avant garde"" it is.  Professors are there to help you discover your style and enhance it, whether it's performance art, non-representational sculpture or super-realistic still lives inspired by Baroque art (all of which I've seen my classmates do).  No one would ""shit talk"" a student for pursuing more classical painting techniques, but they may encourage them to do something a little more challenging, because it takes more than just the ability to accurately depict an object in paint to be a successful artist.    Yeah, you can't learn to be a proficient artist in two semesters.  Colleges also don't churn out bestselling authors, millionaire businessmen, or Nobel-prize winning scientists.  It takes time and practice.  In 4 years of classes, you can learn to be a decent artist, and then after a few years getting your MFA, you can be a pretty good artist, and maybe make a living, but it takes a shit ton of work.  There is some truth to the stereotype of art majors working off their loans in part-time jobs, but it's not because they were taught at bad schools, it's because they weren't willing to put in the time and effort to pursue an art career with everything they've got, which is what it takes to be a successful artist.  You have to aggressively market yourself and seek out new opportunities to make it in the art world, and most people aren't capable of doing that.  My professors tell us over and over how hard it is, trust me, there isn't some big conspiracy to delude ""special snowflake"" high schoolers into wasting their money on an art degree.  We all know that it's extremely unlikely that we'll become world-famous artists, but we're all still doing it, because as it turns out ""world famous artist"" is not the only career option available in the arts, as I've learned from my awesome professors, who go far out of their way to help me succeed and improve my art."
painting,3bgq2o,JustToLurkArt,2,Mon Jun 29 04:58:22 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what it is.  ^  Everyone has different expectations of art school and I think the main thing is choosing a school that focuses on exactly what aspect of your art you'd like to improve and where you see your work going.  My close friend and I both pursued a degree in art, but she wanted to focus on perfecting her technique, whereas I wanted to learn more about theory and the conceptual side of my painting.  We both found schools in the same area that were able to address our individual needs and graduated satisfied about our choices in higher education.  It all depends on where you want your paintings to go.  If you want to pursue painting as a career within the so called ""art world"", a fine arts degree would definitely be worthwhile, but if you really just want to advance your skills or learn more about it as a hobby, then community classes would be a better bet.     The most beneficial parts of getting a fine arts degree is getting feedback during critiques.  At my college, we were given opportunities to get criticism from local artists and industry professionals as well as our classmates and professors.  Every single bit of feedback I received was helpful and helped me progress my art in ways that wouldn't have been possible on my own.  Even if it is just your peers, this feedback is essential.  Nobody in my class created similar work to each other, so hearing responses and suggestions about my work from differing viewpoints helped me view my work in a different way and understand it more.  Critiques assess everything from content to composition to emotional responses to the work.    The majority of my professors created ""avant garde"" art, but none pressured me to move completely away from painting and instead suggested ways that I could build on the skills I already had.  They challenged me to look at art beyond painting and include multi-disciplinary work within my practice to supplement my paintings.  They didn't want me to abandon painting, as that is/was my main squeeze, but encouraged me to be competitive with contemporary artists who were incorporating a lot of different techniques within their work and utilize other art forms to reinforce my paintings.  I feel like it was worthwhile for me to study this for four years, but only you can really decide if it's something you want to study.  All of the things I learned regarding painting and outside of it was taught because, like anything else, the art world is a business and if you want to be a part of it, you must be aware of trends AND simultaneously develop your own path within it.    At the end of the day, you must assess what you want to get out of the work you're creating.  The one thing that is true of both pursuing a degree in art and advancing your studies outside of the academic world is the desire to produce work that is meaningful to you.  Neither is intrinsically more valuable, just the path varies depending on the artist.  If you want to learn painting inside and out including the history, content, and symbolism, then pursuing a degree in it is worth it.  If you want to improve your technical skills, then classes around your community that help improve the areas you need to are good.  But BOTH can be achieved with independent study and critique from other artists independently if you want to avoid both types of classes together.   As u/FLRocketBaby states, none of these alone can bring you to the level of a great artist, it's something that came only be achieved through commitment and exploration of your own art.   As one of my professors told us, ""you can be the best artist in the entire world, but if you don't produce art, you aren't shit."""
painting,3bgq2o,bmc1010,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:18:24 2015 UTC,"Best answer. Here's some Robert Henri quotes from The Art Spirit (recommend reading) that support it:   “A common defect of modern art study is that too many students do not know why they draw.”  ""No matter how fine a school you are in, you have to educate yourself ... Few do it – frankly. Educating yourself is getting acquainted with yourself."""
painting,3bgq2o,EviLincoln_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:35:25 2015 UTC,"To preface my comments: I haven't ever taken a class on art (not since middle school anyway).  And I have no interest in being the next big thing in art or anything like that.  So prity much from the view of a complete hobbiest.  I've spent the last few years learning to paint, and plan to keep learning.  I don't have access to a teacher or atelier.  From this ignorant spot comes my view.  I feel like there is a ton of info on the net.  But there are a lot of things that I've searched for many hrs and can't find anywhere.  And lots of bad or contradictory info is out there too, and sorting through it all is maddening.  I also second guess myself constantly.   Is the info bad or am I just not understanding it?  Some times I'll just get so fed up I want to punch someone or sit in a corner and cry.  LoL  I do feel like having a teacher or some other artists to talk to when I'm stuck would help enormously.  And I think that having access to a good museum would be amazing as well, as looking at art in person is another vital area where my efforts would be pushed along much more quickly, photo's just don't convey enuff information.  All that being said, I've made a ton of progress by just net/book learning.  I'm not sure if there is really any ""secret"" that they will teach, as much as just giving you new things to think about.  Learning on your own stuff that seems simple, like ""is this painting to dark"" would almost be self evident, but while solo it seems a maddening question.  And critiquing your own stuff, your only able to see the problems upto your own ""level"" of skill, where a teacher can point out things that you might never think about and get you thinking at a higher lvl faster.  So I feel like progress is slower for sure, as you feel your way on your own.  Kind of re-inventing the wheel in a way.  But it can be done in my opinion.  Some of my stuff from start to recent can be found hear:  http://bmc1010.imgur.com/ and I think there is a prity decent progress shown for what it's worth."

painting,3bgsws,Default_Admin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:27:28 2015 UTC,It may dry in time but putting the piece in a warmer location will speed the drying process. Because you used black any long term damage would be unnoticeable. Generally if you used a lighter color base you might see yellowing or cracking. It may be a little glossy because of the amount of medium you used. Next time think about using acrylic as your gesso. Gesso is usually acrylic due to its quick drying time and it's solidarity once dry.
painting,3bgsws,boomsauc3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:31:19 2015 UTC,I had no idea.......... :O I totally passed up some acrylic gesso because I was painting with oil.
painting,3bgsws,boomsauc3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:33:07 2015 UTC,Yea always use acrylic. Here are a few simple rules in oil painting:  Always paint thin to thick so that the bottom layer are given a chance to dry.  You can paint oil onto acrylic but not acrylic onto oil. Acrylic drys quickly and to a solid. Whereas oil drys slowly and takes a much longer time because it's too most surface drys within a few days but deeper layers may take weeks to dry fully.

I thought that depth perception was a function of binocular vision, dose it have something to do with the brain not communicating between the eyes?  I wouldn't panic just yet anyway.  You mention your thinking things were artistic flair.  So you can differentiate what basically makes up ""depth"" in a painting.  That's kind of a formula.  I know it's not the popular way to think about art, but light striking an object behaves in a certain way.  What I mean is if you had 100 paintings of a ball, they will all be different in some ways but for the most part they will all be kind of the same in many ways as well.  So learning to show depth should you want to paint a ball would be easy enuff by taking the similarities from your 100 paintings.  Learning to use linear perspective can be a prity mathematical as well.  Using a vanishing point and guide lines would be one way to go about it.  Infact, learning to represent depth on a paintings 2d canvas you might find yourself at an advantage come to think about it.  One of the hardest parts for new artists to get over is basicly not seeing in 3d, and looking at the world as if it's a 2d surface...which you would do naturally?  What I would do is start with building a shadow box so you can control the light.  Then make some still lives.  That way you can control every aspect and know exactly where things are in relation to each other.  Focus on the ""tricks"" that show whats close than the other.  Stuff like over lap, shadows, angles etc.  And just see how many ways I could find that show depth without needing to see it.  If your dream was to be a pro basketball player I think you would have a problem.  But the more I think about this, it might actually be an advantage to an artist."

In OP's defense, in school most of us were the only art person in class and non-art people would have been really impressed with seeing the brushes. OP just hasn't realized that everyone here has art tools and brushes and we use them regularly to make art. (We were all the ""art kids"" in our class.)

I think it helps to give an idea of the scale of the painting. It also makes the picture more tangible and hand-made when looking at photographs on a computer screen that, with its lack of depth, often doesn't make a good distinction between traditional and digital art."

And my criticism is: stay as loose as you are, as I love how your gestural realism approaches vivid perceptions while it entwines succinctly the literal, the cerebral, and the 'actual' (the measured and the viscous materiality of paint). Referencing a ""Classical"" brown palette known through the work of artists like Turner is always positively rewarded with such careful recognition to patterns of natural light. I leave no negative feedback in the sense that regimenting your perceptions might you lead you astray from a paternal connection to this bayou. Rats off to ya."

painting,3arr17,Velurkiraptor,6,Mon Jun 22 23:52:03 2015 UTC,"It feels not finished to me. I think its because the background of the image has much more detail then the flower itself. If you could take that level of detail and put it into the flower itself it would feel like you didn't just block off the solid colors as a base for the flower.   Like, the two leaves on the right side look very finished and have a style to them. If you could bring that to the flower I think it would greatly help bring out the quality of the painting.   EDIT: Looking at it some more, I would of personally make the two leaves also stand out more from the rest of the green background as well since they are very nicely done, but feel invisible unless you look for a longer period of time."

I really like this, but the flower definitely feels flat with how dynamic and textured the background is. That said, I really like the style of the flower and how it contrasts against the background.  I don't think I'd go with trying to make them the same style. Instead, what if you added some more depth and dimensionality to the flower through shading? That would help you figure out how to accentuate some of the leaves, like Mickey is suggesting.  By no means should you take this as thinking I didn't like it. I actually really love it, especially the Van Gogh texturing in the background and cleanness of the flower."
painting,3arr17,L337Cthulhu,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:57:51 2015 UTC,That's the route I'm thinking of going. It's currently just really cheap acrylic from Walmart. Maybe I should make it a mixed media .... ? What would you say the best way to go about it would be
painting,3arr17,janet-eugene-hair,2,Tue Jun 23 21:57:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think the paint is necessarily the issue. The higher quality stuff only makes a difference when you've got a nicer canvas and a decent bit of money to spare, at least in my experience. That said, going to an art or crafts store might get you a couple pre-mixed colors that are harder to make consistently the same on your own. I've used the cheap stuff a lot, too, and I've never had a major issue with it. (Unless we're talking super, super watered-down, primary-colors-only cheap).   I think staring deeply at a few reference images (and maybe sketching the textures by hand for a bit) might help? There's a softness to a flower and I think the contrast between your lit outer petals and dark inner ones might be too great. You could accentuate them and take it almost cubist (which would be cool) or you could add depth with more shading by blending the two areas closer together.   Thaaat was a wall of text. Sorry 'bout that. >.>"

The water all feels like similar sized strokes and feels very choppy (which, I kind of get because of waves and such, but there isn't anywhere for my gaze to settle on.

Just a touch of yellow on the edge as well as in the grass should bring them to life while still leaving a nice shadow in the back.  As well the lighting in the mountains seems a little off, seems like the sun is slightly to the left of the mountains but the highlight is to the right.

You have understanding of reflections and the smooth tranistion of colour especially in the second one.   Your paintings are lacking depth however. Make sure before you start a painting that you decide where the light source is and work all the shadows and highlights based on that. Your paintings need more shadows and highlights to make them pop out and come alive. Dont be afraid to use some white directly on the painting as a highlight in areas such as the water in the third painting. Keep painting op, practise makes perfect :)"

painting,3ae3hv,Nujabes420,6,Fri Jun 19 11:06:36 2015 UTC,"It's fine, it adds rhythm. A sense of moment and energy into the painting.  My critique is that if there's white in the painting is should be because you placed it there. You shouldn't have white from the flat canvas poking up underneath your color that is thickly laid on. It disrupts your rhythm and makes it look more like you missed spots than intentional. If you want there to be white in that spot lay it down with the same consistency as you did the other colors.  Besides Van Gogh look at someone like Cezanne for directional mark making techniques."
painting,3ae3hv,mackinoncougars,5,Fri Jun 19 18:09:33 2015 UTC,This painting is on a black canvas so all the white is from me. But thank you

If I had any critique I'd say the house should have been done in stronger contrast to the road underneath it and should have been placed anywhere else but dead center. But no your style isn't bad, this is reminiscent of certain Van Gogh pieces to me."
painting,3ae3hv,TheAmazingAaron,2,Fri Jun 19 11:39:01 2015 UTC,My only critique to OP would be that he experiment with mixing colors more and move away from the primary 'defaults'. That's probably the biggest difference between his painting and Van Gogh's style.

painting,3ae3hv,janet-eugene-hair,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:00:08 2015 UTC,My suggestion is to simply look at nature. It is full of beautiful colors everywhere. Then mix them up using the colors you got. After you get use to that you can start getting really creative by using them to show mood and emotion.

I'd suggest checking out Len Hend, Dave Usher and Will Kemp on Youtube as they really explain a lot of fundamentals. Equipment wise I started with an order from Dick Blick consisting of titanium white, ultramarine blue, cadium yellow light, cadium red medium, burnt sienne, burnt umber, pthalo blue and prussian blue, all artist quality acrylics. I paint on board which is cheaper than canvas since I'm extremely amateur, and use a fan brush, a few flats, a round hog bristle, a 2 inch housepainting brush and a palette knife.  It's really fun, if you think you'd enjoy it then I'd wager you will."

painting,3agen4,Daannii,2,Wed Jun 24 18:22:10 2015 UTC,"I find inspiration from looking at other peoples art. Pinterest is actually pretty great for guides and looking at other peoples styles.    I can take elements I like from different people's processes and it gives me a starting place, though anything I make usually never even looks close to the original inspiration art piece. ^ _^   I do like trying to figure out how they achieved a certain texture or style though.  It's a good way to help you find your own style.  Just try lots of different things.  See what sort of feels ""right""."
painting,3afmr2,Mini_Sl1m,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:12:02 2015 UTC,"So my best advice for murals is to prime the surface with that fabulous KILZ primer stuff or something similar.  If you don't prime properly, you are going to have a very bad time.   Secondly- you should look into buying the specific colors  you want to use for large areas.  Because if you have to do touch ups it will be almost impossible to mix paint to match it as acrylics wet are much different shades when dry.   Third, - consider getting you a nice set of opaque air-brush acrylic inks/paints.    These are going to be more pigmented so richer better coverage. But they aren't going to go that far in terms of mural sizes.  Best investment I've made in doing murals but I usually mix them with acrylic paints to get stronger opaqueness.   You can use latex wall paint on dry wall.  Other surfaces probably not a good idea. Don't use lacquers or oil based paints you find in your hardware store.  Also plan it out on paper first.  This is super important.  Color pencil. Crayons. MS paint. Whatever you have handy- but you need to make a mock up first to see how the colors and styles will work.    Also last tip - if you have some area you need to fix and it seems like no matter how many layers of paint you use, the spot just won't cover right, then paint a big smear of white over the area. Maybe two coats. Then repaint it.  It might be that the pigments seem to bleed through, but a good white paint seems to seal it and also set a balanced background color.  So regardless of the mechanism, the white paint trick works wonders.   I've only done a few murals.  I personally like working with good thick opaque acrylics and regular latex wall paint.   Bad experience with oil based paints or lacquers.  Cheap walmart folk art paint is runny and dulls so bad when dry.  Runs down the wall, doesn't cover well, and looks pretty crappy.  But murals are usually big and you might not have tons of money to buy premium paints."

painting,3aedau,AZ1717,2,Sat Jun 20 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"I'm no art historian, but I see these and think Eastern European Steampunk (as opposed to Edwardian or Victorian Steampunk). I realize it's probably not for everyone, but I kind of like it. The artist is obviously very talented."
painting,3aedau,bayken2,2,Sat Jun 20 15:00:47 2015 UTC,"Reference to this as a ""style"" is a slight misnomer. Jakub is combining the well-established genre of Military History Painting with ideas of mechanization popularized by the Japanese beginning in the late 1950's; However, ideas of Mecha originate in the Western world around the late 1800's with novelists like Jules Verne and the more well known work of author H.G. Wells, The War of the Worlds. These have all since been entwined with the vast genre of Steampunk, which originated in the 1960's...So in short, he is combining work of say Meissonier and Socialist Realism with Steampunk variants of Japanese Mecha (an off-shoot of the Kaiju genre) and the originating prevalent sci-fi novels of the late 1800's, which then for consistencies sake cannot be truly understood without taking authors like Philip K Dick and even lesser known K. W. Jeter (coined the term steampunk) into account. I believe Jakub is highly influenced by the futurist culture here on the internet, where these wholly separate ideas of fantasy become consistent and singular through vast contribution and artist participation, ultimately blurring esoteric designation. So to invent a term for fidelity's sake, I present you with the term 'Historical Steampunk (subgenre: Mecha)'"

painting,3a90e1,CHUNKY101,3,Thu Jun 18 04:33:22 2015 UTC,"Advice on the piece? It looks like an excellent color study. Can't really say much aside from that. If you want to learn about paint and color you should do dozens of these. Fine thing to include in a highschool portfolio.   I don't know what you intend with building a portfolio college art school? But if you are serious about pursuing art, there are a lot of tools out there.  I'd strongly recommend working on perspective, figure drawing, etc. Contour drawing, as boring as it is is an excellent drawing tool as it hones your accuracy and forces you to notice detail. Fill sketchbooks with that stuff.   Oh, and speaking from experience I wouldn't put electronics anywhere near arting unless you are cool with paint making its way onto them magically :) .  Good luck!"
painting,3a90e1,CrayonDNA,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:49:10 2015 UTC,"You got the primaries, that's for sure. Honestly though, don't diversify your portfolio, just do a lot if what you're good at. Spreading yourself in too many directions just means that you're not good at a lot things, instead of being great at one. If it's for applying for college, well, just about any portfolio that shows an interest in art will get you in. If this was for entrance into grad school, well, same advice. You just want to show them what you're best at, and that you deserve to be there because you're really good at this one thing that you do. Don't try to dip in all mediums."

painting,3a4bc6,hashbrownash,2,Wed Jun 17 03:06:32 2015 UTC,"Acrylic paint behaves different depending on the climate and the amount of paint you use. The problem with using water as a base is that when thinned out, acrylic does not adhere well and can easily be scrapped off. It is better to use acrylic medium (either gloss or matte) thinned with water, rather than pure water.  The benefits of acrylic are that they do dry fast. Retardants are a slow drying medium which allow acrylics to behave more like oils.  I am sure they can be thinned as well to increase drying time, but refer to the label's directions.  It is possible to do the wet on wet technique, but take into consideration that acrylic is air drying, while oil dries via oxidizing."

painting,39zpqu,NedTaggart,4,Tue Jun 16 02:29:03 2015 UTC,This looks like a good start. You should bust put that pallet knife and add some background.  I know nothing about pallet knife painting but maybe a little less paint? It might just look like too much because of the smooth background.  Blending your own colors rather than just using the straight tube color can offer a range of shades for your color allowing you to blend colors on canvas more easily.

I posted about it over here - https://www.reddit.com/r/painting/comments/39x4m0/wet_on_wet_what_am_i_missing/  Anyway, taking some advice and utterly discarding other advice I said screw it, I'm going to try something still. Looking around, there was a bottle on a shelf next to my easel, so really, why the hell not, it's just paint. I opened the bottle to make sure is was functional and sampled the contents, then went for it.  I started with ivory black and thinner and sketched an outline, then added some white so I could start painting the glass. (Glass sucks, btw, what was I thinking). I added some cadmium red for the top, van dyke brown to get the contents, then Cadmium yellow for the label.  I'm somewhat meh about it. It's not proportioned properly and I couldn't really get the slightly oblique angle correct. Also, there wasn't a good shadow to look at so that sucks too.   At any rate, this is officially my first oil. It was intended to be a practice piece. I do like the texture and I'm not completely displeased with the glass effect."

painting,39zpqu,didsome1saybacon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:10:22 2015 UTC,Ive used pallet knoves a lot in the past and im thoroughly impressed.  Helpful tip start with your darkest colors first. Try only pating the back side of the bottle. That way you start doing the highlights and reflections it comes natural. Also even though it may seem challenging right put something behind the bottle it helps drive home the idea of it being glass

painting,39vxfo,nominally,3,Mon Jun 15 12:33:51 2015 UTC,"Yes I see your point but all of those pictures show each mountain with depth. Like there are mountains in front and behind them. This painting has a flat perspective where the mountains only range from side to side. Also, if you look at the examples you posted you'll notice that the ridges seem to follow a pattern. Whether they angle from lower left to upper right or are parallel up and down and from side to side, the pattern is fixed and its easier to look at. Our brains don't have to process it. We just know they're mountains. This mountains show ridges that cross diagonally. The left side angles from upper left to lower right and the right side angles from lower left to upper right. They end up running into each other in the middle and with the flat perspective it makes the mountain kind of an eye sore.  I thought the painting was done really well...but sometimes it is the little things like perspective that can make a painting look a little off."

painting,39vxfo,phunktion,3,Mon Jun 15 12:31:23 2015 UTC,"This is very great progress for your 6th painting. No need to solicit critiques!  The good: you have got the tricks of textures down. The tree style-spot on, the mountain style-spot on, the water's limpidly flow can be mustered somewhat, but darn good.  If I had to give you somewhere to go, work more texture into the mountains. For instance, I don't see a timberline. (the snow just barely frosts tree tops up to a certain elevation, then there is the kind of ""broadside"" pallette knife spread of snow at intermediate levels, then glaciers at the top which are broad whites, silvers, and blues and very few superdark contrasts. Photo example  Water reflections usually become more diffuse toward the vanishing point. The mountain doesn't seem to have any reflection in the water... hard to tell perspective-wise if it should.  Lastly, I would work a bit more color into it. Greens are not fully green (you have pulled in some yellows with the leaves, but I would have mixed a little brick, maybe some cadmium white, etc, just for glistening effects, underbrush, etc. the mind creates the story of the little imperfections. Blues are not fully blue, maybe the sky needs some lavendar and orange hues. Not that the sun is setting, but the appearance of blue in the sky is because rarefraction of light entering the atmosphere, and there are always little changes to that color that our mind washes out."
painting,39vxfo,hashbrownash,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:18:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice and the compliment. I am trying to work on my reflection detail, especially in the foreground, but for the mountain reflections at what step to i add that? right after i make it or  after the foothills or later?  Is there a difference between cadmium white and titanium white?"
painting,39vxfo,EviLincoln_,3,Mon Jun 15 22:48:36 2015 UTC,"They should be pretty similar. With mountains, depending on your medium, it's easier to work light into dark at the top (as you've done) but dark into light at the bottom.   The bottom of the mountains tends to be less ""rigid"" and angular, especially below the timberline, as alluvial fanning has spread out smooth, sprawling surfaces with deep valleys and buttelike crags. So the snow falls evenly on the surfaces there and melts during the summertime. In a hot summer the treetops might be barren. In the wintertime, the trees may have snow on them, and be barely visable.  Past the timberline, toward the top of the mountain, glaciation removes large chunks of mountain leaving these harsh exposed surfaces of barren rock. You've captured these really well.   At the very top of the mountain, there are usually several glaciers that are solid white, with azure/crystal iridescence."

painting,39zvt8,Default_Admin,3,Tue Jun 16 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"It's not required for alla prima painting. Most artists I know who paint alla prima don't do that. As a matter of fact I think I've only seen it used in the Bob Ross/Bill Alexander technique.  So, you won't be able to do the thing where Bob Ross goes straight into the sky with pure blue and swirls his brush around to indicated clouds. But that's just one way to paint. Have fun and paint however you can.  Oh, as for your ""any oil"" question, the answer is no. You can't use any oil. You need a 'drying oil'. Linseed oil is what oil paint is usually made from. Other drying oils are Walnut, poppy, and tung oil. Oil paint is a mixture of some drying oil and particles of some kind of pigment. If you dilute your paint with more oil it will have less pigment. That will make it more transparent. If you go nuts with the oil your paint will get too thin.  Feel free to use cheap paints if that's all you've got right now. Just know your paintings may not last as long (a few years instead of 100 years), and you won't be able to get those really dazzling reds/oranges/whatevers, since cheaper paints use cheaper pigments. But that's fine when you're starting. Just go for it!"
painting,39zvt8,barkerart,2,Tue Jun 16 06:34:54 2015 UTC,"Just to build off of what /u/bakerart was saying, Bob Ross' thing was wet on wet oil painting. That's why he was able to create these paintings in a half hour for his TV show. You don't necessarily need to paint wet on wet.  Also, I'm not sure what you mean by ""regular"" paint. Are you talking about paint straight from the tube? Acrylics? House paint? I need more details here.   Something else to consider is the surface you're working on. Canvas needs to be primed, but sometimes it comes pre-gessoed to save you some work. Depending on what paint you're using, you can paint on different kinds of board or paper. Even wood.  If you're just getting back into it, I might recommend using acrylics or watercolors instead. Watercolors are an entirely different painting experience, but still awesome to use and definitely leaves a lot of room for mistakes/ experimentation. Acrylics are closer to the oil experience, but are easier to clean up and less temperamental overall. However, be warned that acrylics dry REALLY fast and so if you mix a color, you need to use it there and then.   Happy painting! Be sure to share some work with us!"
painting,39zvt8,mctheebs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:01:09 2015 UTC,"All of these things everyone has mentioned are true, but they didn't answer your question!  Liquid white is used to let you push paint around and blend on the canvas. As the paint is worked around, it mixes with the liquid white also. That causes colors to become lighter, which is really great for skies and reflections. The fact that you can move the paint allows you to pul down to create reflections and wave them around. The final reason it is used, is to keep the canvas wet until you are finished. Some paints will become sticky rather quickly. Not everyone paints as fast as Bob Ross, so liquid white will give you a few days to make changes."

painting,39x4m0,NedTaggart,2,Mon Jun 15 14:53:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know how helpful this will be but personally I find painting frustrating when I'm about to have a breakthrough and make some progress, so keep at it even when your pissed off.  I don't really have any good internet resources to teach you to paint but I would say just copying paintings you love is a great way to learn, as well as painting still lives. The medium i use is usually a third damar varnish a third linseed and a third solvent."
painting,39x4m0,Drcandleandchow,2,Mon Jun 15 15:47:19 2015 UTC,"To answer the question about the screwed up canvas: let it dry and paint over it.   You might have applied your liquid white too thick. If it's too thick the your new layers of paint will have nothing to grip on to. Also I don't think there should be enough of it to scrape up with your knife. It's primarily there to give you a slick surface tht can be blended into. That's something you'll just want to experiment with.   Also if you come from a drawing background you might want to consider painting more in the style of the impressionists for a bit until you are comfortable with oil. What I mean is mixing the colors as they appear to be on your palette, then applying them directly to the dry canvas. It's much more like drawing if you do it that way instead of like Bob Ross.   The paint needs to be pretty thick to break, and it also needs something to grab onto. So if your liquid white was too thick and your mountains were too thick, your snow won't be able to get any tooth from the canvas, especially if it's been thinned.   Also with wet on wet you're not always covering your other layers with new layers. You're more adding color into the previous layer. Like the clouds for instance. Stuff your brush in there and blend the clouds into the existing sky to make the paint stay on the canvas.   So overall here's my advice:  Try painting like the impressionists since you have a drawing background.   If you want to stick with Bob Ross, make sure your liquid white is very thinly applied to the canvas.   Tell the paint where to go, don't let it dictate anything.   Experiment.   Stay positive.   Keep working.   As far as instruction videos go I don't know any really good ones. I usually just search YouTube for videos of people painting things. Usually they aren't telling you what they're doing, but just watching them do it helps me.   Really the most important thing is to not get discouraged and to keep working. The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.   Hope this helped and good luck and have fun!"
painting,39x4m0,ProductofUnreality,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"I can probably do that fairly easily. To be clear, it has been YEARS since I have seriously done any drawings.  Impressionism is actually the style I prefer, particularly seascapes. That's actual the direction I want to head with it all, I was just thinking that the Bob Ross techniques were rudimentary and basic skills.   I'll work on trying some various shapes in the impressionist style. IIRC from art class, that's going to mean cones, donuts, cubes and spheres."
painting,39x4m0,ProductofUnreality,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:28:12 2015 UTC,"Plenty of Bob Ross's techniques will be helpful, but his methods aren't universal. You can learn lots by how he paints mountains and trees, but you don't need to do it the same way he does. If you want to paint impressionist seascapes his liquid white method is probably not a great method for you. I paint in a traditional style now usually, with underpainting and glazes. Bob Ross is totally irrelevant for that method. You can pick and choose what techniques and methods of his you'd like to use, but you don't have to use them all.   Do the cones and stuff so long as you don't get bored. Painting should never be a chore when you're first starting, it makes it easier to get burnt out.   Your grayish green canvas would probably make a nice ground to paint an overcast seascape on top of, by the way."
painting,39x4m0,JustToLurkArt,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:29:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was thinking exactly of that. I would love to be able to, but unfortunately. I don't have the skill now, so that will most likely become a scratch canvas."
painting,39x4m0,JustToLurkArt,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:01:54 2015 UTC,"Their style isn't exactly my bag, but I figure learning how to paint that way would be a good place to start.   This is where the wheels came off. You're a non-swimmer who jumped into the deep end of the wrong swimming pool. If you don't like their work, why on earth would you try to emulate it or their style? Truthfully, God bless Bob Ross; he helped introduce painting to non-art-people but to be truthfull – most people just watched because he was nice and entertaining. He probably did as much damage as he did help anyone.  If you are serious about learning to paint, and want to avoid years of frustration, start with learning the fundamentals of drawing. Many of the elements translate into painting: composition, values, depth, line weight, etc., etc. These basics are better learned with a pencil and a sketchbook. When you get proficient in the discipline of drawing, then graduate to oil paint."

I will take your advice about drawing though. That's easily a portable activity that can be picked up and shut down with no prep.   In regards to the Bob Ross style, I don't hate it, I would like to learn how to do it, its just that after watching several of the episodes back to back, there wasn't much variety. I haven't seen him do much with dynamic water and that is what really interests me. How light plays through waves and in flowing water, how the sun or a lighthouse plays through fog, mist or spray. Its my opinion that the impressionist style is best suited for this, and that is the direction I would like to focus."

When you have an honest evaluation of your ability - you respect the discipline.  Bob's a one-trick-pony. If you want impressionist style, start reading about color theory and play with some watercolors. They're inexpensive, familiar and easy cleanup."

painting,39u1tm,RoastedBean,5,Sun Jun 14 19:46:17 2015 UTC,"There is a lot to know before starting to paint with oils  Canvas   Make sure you prime your canvas/canvas board with gesso, otherwise the oil will destroy the fabric overtime and the painting will be ruined Pre-primed canvas works just as fine   Brushes   I never painted seriously with acrylics before but hog brushes tend to work well with oil, they aren't too pricey. Look for long handle  keep your brushes CLEAN! Oil paint can dry as fast as 1-2 days, don't leave your brushes with paint on them if you aren't coming back to it   soap and water works just as well as a brush cleaner, do some research though   Oil Paint   Beginners can start out with a few colors, such as - Titanium White, Ivory Black, Crimson Alizarin, Cadmium Red Hue, Yellow Ochre, Lemon Yellow, Cadmium Yellow Hue, Ultramarine Blue, Cerulean Blue Hue, Sap Green, Burnt Sienna, and Burnt Umber. To thin out oil paint use painting medium that is linseed oil or walnut oil Student quality oil paint is decent quality but the colors will become cloudy the more you mix in   Cleaning   Get some Odorless Mineral Spirits or Turpenoid to clean the brushes, thin paint, etc. Keep in in a baby food sized jar and keep reusing.  Don't buy this in a hardware store! you need higher quality   I hope this helps, researching before you buy is important. The higher the quality of the item is the better it will work, but isn't always necessary."
painting,39u1tm,Pabloster,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:17:01 2015 UTC,"WOW! Thank you so much for taking the type to write all this out for me!! I had no idea about the hog brushes. Can I ask why to look for a long handle? I normally only work with brushes that have long handles anyway just because they're more comfortable in my hand, but I'm just wondering if theres a specific reason.  So, do I use both some sort of oil (linseed or walnut) and mineral spirits or Turpenoid to thin paint? Or are all 4 of those things interchangeable? Like for example should I mix linseed oil and mineral spirits? Or just use on thing. I feel like I'm not typing this question right, but I hope you know what I'm trying to ask lol."
painting,39u1tm,cherter1,2,Mon Jun 15 17:18:11 2015 UTC,"Long handle allows you to paint farther and looser from the surface you're paint on, and you can still grip down to get tighter strokes and finer detail.   As far as mediums, the biggest difference amongst them is going to be drying time (also gloss and how it holds your brushstroke). Alkyd based mediums and Winsor Newton's Liquin are faster drying. They will dry within a day if not less. Linseed or Walnut oil will dry slower. Stand oil even slower. You can add mineral spirits or turpenoid to these mediums to get better flow, but it will speed up drying time (it is fairly common to use thinners with medium). You can use just mineral spirits or tuprenoid to thin paint, but most artists do that for the underpainting (if they do one). Fat over lean.   I would definitely start by buying some student grade oils as well. They aren't as horrible as some people make them out to be. The pigment load is obviously lower than artist grade. IMO, gamblin makes some of the best bang for your buck artist grade paints. I love their consistency, but that's me and my preference. I also thought when I first started that the Van Gogh student oils were pretty decent. They even have series 1 and 2 which isn't always the case with student grade.  Oh, and palette wise, I suggest using palette paper. It's so much easier to clean than a wood or glass palette. Just pull the paper off and throw it away. If you let your paints sit, some will dry after a few days and others won't and you can have a big annoying mess to clean up."
painting,39u1tm,Pabloster,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:00:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for answering for me! This is really good stuff.  You don't need all 4, just a paint thinner and a medium. You can mix them all to get different results and thinness, play around to see what you like."
painting,39u1tm,cherter1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:18:58 2015 UTC,And I'd probably lean towards a galkyd based medium for starting out. Drys much faster and leaves plenty of time for wet in wet. But that's partly preference.

Have you done oil on glass before? Is it archival? It's something I haven't heard of before. Did you prime the surface?
painting,39qfy1,ThumbtackGlove,2,Sun Jun 14 13:28:14 2015 UTC,"I haven't done oil on glass before, but there are tonnes of painters who have. It's mostly used in antiques and stuff. Really old art form. So I'm assuming it'll last a while. The paint slides really easily off the glass. If you were to prime it then it would kind of ruin the effect. The only thing is that I should definitely put a clear coat of something on it once it's dried. I'm thinking resin or some sort of thick varnish."
painting,39qfy1,ThumbtackGlove,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"That's kinda what I was curious about. I didn't know if there was some sort of transparent/translucent primer that would be used for that. I imagine its amazing, not worrying about nasty gesso texture and having the bonus of that awesome luminescent effect but that's something I always worry about when thinking about trying something outside canvas. It does totally look great though, and worth the risk. I think you're right in try to give it a finishing layer. Maybe think about polyurethane, one of my classmates and one of our grads used that when they worked on less traditional surfaces, it seemed like it would work."

painting,39oubd,fresnel-lens,4,Sat Jun 13 09:14:09 2015 UTC,Sounds snotty but don't mean it snotty:  You should pick up in anatomy for artists book. It'll make great strides in your portraiture.
painting,39oubd,paintwhore,2,Sat Jun 13 14:15:07 2015 UTC,I have to disagree. I really like this style. It's refreshing to see a style original. I like it!
painting,39oubd,potatoequal,2,Sat Jun 13 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"I believe that style should be chosen, or your natural viewpoint, but not the result of common misconceptions about proper proportions before education.  I suppose I don't understand resistance to knowledge or tools in the form of placation.  I'm not saying it's bad at all, simply that there is a clear step to mitigate barriers that limit your options when forming a legitimate style."
painting,39oubd,paintwhore,2,Sat Jun 13 19:50:14 2015 UTC,"You are assuming a lot by saying ""not the result of common misconceptions about proper proportions before education"". It does sound snotty."
painting,39oubd,potatoequal,2,Sat Jun 13 21:58:30 2015 UTC,"When you're more experienced as an artist, you learn to recognize in what stage like artists are when they're learning.  No one ever got better because the public fell all over their first few or first few dozen."
painting,39oubd,paintwhore,3,Sat Jun 13 23:28:08 2015 UTC,"While I agree most of what you've said about an artist being trained. Assumptions about the artist skill level are impossible. Your experience will only help judge another artist who is trying to paint well. While unlikely, The artist maybe extremely talented and choosing to paint in this style deliberately. I personally know an artist who paints in a style similar to jean-michel basquiat that can actually render figurative work at a very mature skill level."

painting,39oubd,drinksy,2,Sun Jun 14 03:16:48 2015 UTC,"Whilst I am not new to painting in the slightest, I am new to portraiture.  Having said that, I think art should largely be about self-expression, and it shouldn't matter if your anatomical proportions aren't realistic... especially if you aren't going for that 'photorealistic' look. ;)  You do indeed sound quite snotty, and your comment does come across as just an attack on someone whose skills you find inferior to yours, which is not that nice."

painting,39ipy9,Hunhund,3,Sat Jun 13 06:00:27 2015 UTC,Oh i had not thought of Etsy. A lot of local artists in my area go to restaurants and hang their art in there with a price tag next to it so people can be exposed and they can buy from the restaurant.

painting,39jg67,modestmouse89,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:45:20 2015 UTC,If you are not allergic I wouldn't worry about it with most oil paints. But there are exceptions. If you use for example a lead white you should use gloves because of lead poisoning.  The turpentine might not be perfect for your skin but it doesnt come in contact with it 99% of the time. The only thing I feel I need to wear is a mask because I don't want all these turpentine fumes in my lungs.
painting,39jg67,headcrab1991,1 point,Fri Jun 12 11:20:33 2015 UTC,"I wear a glove on my non dominant hand always. That's the hand I hold my towel with. My brush hand isn't getting much contact with the paint, but my other hand usually does. Mostly I'm concerned about eating after painting.   I use gamsol instead of turp and sit next to a window, so I don't wear a mask. That would be too uncomfortable for me. I've tried wearing a glove on my painting hand, but that's not comfortable either. If rather feel the brush than be marginally safer."
painting,39hn70,thekit44,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:50:34 2015 UTC,Do you have a reference image? A window could be any amount of reflective/opaque/transparent so it's hard to know what you are going for without something to base it on.

Acrylic and oils don't go together well and won't hold long when acrylic has been used over the oil.

I'm afraid you'll be better off doing it again in all acrylics, if you want to use it for a long time."

I don't know what it would do to the sharpie but it wouldn't hurt to try using it on a test painting with the same mediums.   The only real solution I can think of isn't very flattering or visually appealing but will be functional for the spills. You can purchase clear vinyl in different gauges and laying it over the top will help with the spills until you find a more permanent option. At the very least you'll be able to see the board and make it water/beer resistant.   Good luck!

painting,3987g9,load_more_comets,3,Tue Jun 9 23:25:13 2015 UTC,I would suggest acrylics. Best of both worlds for beginning painting. You can even start them with those 75 cent bottles from Michaels
painting,3987g9,fishpuddle,2,Tue Jun 9 23:46:08 2015 UTC,Thanks. Can you please elaborate why they're best of both worlds?
painting,3987g9,40ozkiller,5,Tue Jun 9 23:47:49 2015 UTC,"Oil gets extremely complicated when it comes to clean up, acrylic watercolor or guache would be recommended for learning to use the medium and help save clothing. Tempera watercolor and guache will remain water soluble but oil and acrylic will be there forever once dry. I would suggest getting some drawing paper or cheaper and some artists loft supplies, cheap materials that usually come in bulk so they can do as much as their heart desires."

painting,3987g9,bayken2,2,Wed Jun 10 12:36:45 2015 UTC,"May I suggest water color crayons or sticks? Draw a picture with the kids using water color sticks on w.c. paper, then surprise them by altering your drawing by brushing or pouring water onto it. Nearly zero clean up. And you can combine them with regular water color paints if they prefer painting. Buy a set of w.c. tubes, a decent set of w.c. sticks, paper (140lb press) and a cheap set of brushes for under 40 dollars. Also, this process might tacitly introduce ideas of under painting! And also, science! Oils are toxic and acrylics are messy, go safer for safes sake with the lil'uns. P.S. Try wetting the entire paper before using water colors for a different effect!"

Other than that pretty good for your first, keep it going."

painting,3940te,meowmixmeowmixed,2,Tue Jun 9 03:53:07 2015 UTC,"For a first try it looks great! The water and sky are very nicely rendered, especially for acrylics.  Now, things to work on. A lot of the brushwork on the more detailed areas looks repetitive and rushed. Be patient, take a bit more time with what you're doing, and try to vary the brushstrokes more. A good example of this is the difference between the conifer on the left and the one on the right. The one on the left looks more realistic because your brushstrokes don't all look the same. It looks like you gave more thought to it. The one on the right gives off the impression that you figured out what ""worked"" and went into auto pilot mode. The same goes for the trees in the background, which end up looking more like grass. These repetitive textures also cause the landscape to appear flattened.  The mountains could use more attention to detail. Was this scene from your imagination, or a photograph? If the former, look up some photos of mountains and study their intricacies, then try to emulate that in your painting. If the latter, slow down. Take more time to really look at the photo. Don't just rush through and make assumptions about what those mountains look like.   Painting can take a long time and a lot of patience, no matter what style you're using. But don't let that discourage you. Don't settle for ""good enough"" and fall into a routine - keep aiming for your own definition of perfect, and with time and practice you'll get there. You'll train your eye and learn some tricks, and eventually you won't feel like you're slogging through the little details. Hope this helps!"

painting,393oti,ThatLemur,2,Tue Jun 9 01:04:19 2015 UTC,"What are you planning to use, acrylic? I'd keep in mind that if you plan on painting over the entire surface of a material, the paint will seal off the breathable qualities of the fabric. I might recommend using ink to instead dye the desired design instead of paint it-- though you might need to experiment with materials, some might be more porous than others and cause the ink to bleed past where you want it as it soaks into the fibers.     I would stop by a fabric store and take a couple samples of material to experiment with. I think cotton would take most paint well, and they come in a wide variety of thicknesses."

painting,393oti,hwknd,2,Tue Jun 9 14:49:13 2015 UTC,Yeah i agree. and maybe stay away from acrylic in terms of thickness.  I think if you made more of a dye with acrylic or india ink then you could still paint with it yet not take away from the breathability of the fabric.

What time of day is this supposed to be? It's light, so it looks like daytime, but the sun is down near the horizon. Besides the yellow coming out of the sun, it's as if the sun isn't affecting the color of the sky at all.  The sun also isn't reflecting on the water. Google ""sunset/sunrise on water"" and use those as reference images. There is always a reflection on the water.  The cloud is too solid. I suggest watching Bob Ross videos on YouTube to get a better understanding of the color of the sky and water, along with the nature of clouds.  I'd say your shoreline is too straight. Nature is imperfect. Waves wash up unevenly.  What's the reason for the random bits of red in the sky and the water? I don't see a reason why those are there.  This is a good start, but it needs a lot of work. My best suggestion is to either visit a beach, or look at pictures of sunrises and sunsets before you paint realism from your mind.  Check out Sunset, Lake George by Jasper Francis Cropsey and Fitz Henry Lane's Stage Fort Across Gloucester Harbor to see the relationship between the sun, the water, and the sky during a sunset/sunrise."

Are you planning on using a primed or unprimed canvas for your project? Likewise, was the emulsion a ""mask/frisket?""   Turpentine and oil paints can be corrosive. That said, many artists, like Helen Frankenthaler and Morris Louis used a staining technique on raw canvas and their paintings to date are still in good shape. That said, they are usually stored in a controlled environment to prevent temperature fluctuations.   What kind of technique are you going for? Sorry for all the questions, hope I can help."

Here's a picture of me doing this before: http://imgur.com/OtawR71 It's a sheet of card with a layer of emulsion paint over that to give it a harder surface since the card was too absorbent. On top of the layer of Emulsion is a wash of acrylics & above that is a layer of black Oil paint. I used turps to remove sections of the layer of oils to reveal the acrylic underneath.   My question in the OP is if when using a canvas with no primer I can skip out of the layer of emulsion and liberally use turps without damaging the canvas. In my head I think I will strip right through the fabric haha  (Emulsion is what people paint walls in houses with, shares some qualities with gesso)"
painting,38stjd,felixjawesome,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"If you are using the turps to remove the oil layer to expose the acrylic below, then it shouldn't have an effect.   I do recommend priming your canvas with gesso first, then acrylic, then the oil. You can sand gesso to get a really smooth surface.  If you get oil on unprimed canvas, it will effective dye the fibers, which when dry you will not be able to remove using turps."

painting,38nbi2,Lindbach,3,Fri Jun 5 09:22:30 2015 UTC,Modern art was more of a time frame and new ways of thinking about art rather than a painting style.  It's sometimes confused with the term contemporary art.   I'd go with Acrylic with thickening mediums.
painting,38nbi2,speaks_with_his_fist,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:54:12 2015 UTC,"There are both acrylic and oil paints which are water-soluble (Nearly all acrylics are water-soluble), and both can be used to create dry ""chunks"". Acrylic is less ""smelly"". Look up Impasto painting technique -- you seem interested in applying paint with what's called a palette knife. Small canvas boards are easy to maneuver and cheap. Don't buy the cheapest brushes. Try long handle ones. Lastly, Modern Art is a period in Art History, roughly all works between ~1840 to ~1980 fall into that category. Best of luck to you! Consider posting your first result. FYI you will get paint on wherever you paint!   Edit: spelling"

painting,38gw0s,tom_of_helatrobus,5,Thu Jun 4 03:10:42 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting piece, just watch out for inconsistencies.  The police car isn't obeying the perspective: we see too much of the top for how far away it is. The Shell sign is twisting for the same discrepancies. For how prominent the shadows are on the right side, there aren't any being cast from the objects on the left and the colors underneath the overhang don't respond to that condition. The background of the piece (volcano) should be much lighter in color and less detailed than the foreground. Right now it reads as something very flat placed at the end of the road than the distant looming doom you're going for.   On the whole, I really like the piece. The idea is absurd in a way I appreciate and I really like texturing on the edge of all the forms. Brush up (bad pun) on color perspective and trust your perspective lines for the next piece. Looking forward to it!"

painting,38e795,Spencypoo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:06:15 2015 UTC,"I mostly mix on the palette before applying, though I sometimes paint directly from the tube. If there's already wet paint on the canvas and you go over it again with more wet paint, the resulting color is going to be a mix of those two colors. That can be used to great effect. If you're trying to preserve the new color, you can either apply the new paint more generously, or wipe off the old paint before applying the new. Mixing paint on the canvas can be quite effective in moderation, but in excess it can result in muddy (""washed out"") colors.  Hope this helps."
painting,38e795,kindofdoon,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:49:33 2015 UTC,This is EXACTLY the advice I was looking for.  Thanks so much!
painting,38e795,ghostdate,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"You mix on a palette.   What brand of oils are you using? You may have gotten lower quality ones with low chroma to begin with, and then mixing lost even more, so it dulled out? I don't really think they look that bad though, looks kind of like a natural over-cast lighting on the greens. Sometimes colours can be directly painted, but that's not often. I don't understand why your colour would lose intensity just from being applied to the canvas, if it looked right when you mixed it."
painting,38e795,ghostdate,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:49:40 2015 UTC,"I bought professional grade oils, so I don't think that its the quality of the paint.  I guess my thinking was that the color I mixed on the palette is going to be changed by whatever color is already on the canvas.  So, for instance, if I have a sky blue, and I add some orange, the preexisting blue will grey out the orange.  The only thing I can think of is that I need to add an even higher intensity orange than what l thought to mix on the palette to compensate for that change.  That sound right?  Thanks for the reply, btw!"

Warm and cool colors point towards each other, so my cool blue is on the yellow side, warm blue is on the red side, etc.  To clean my brushes I wash them with liquid dish soap followed by Masters brush cleaner until no more pigment comes out. Even though I don't use a lot of solvent or toxic pigments I'm hesitant to scrub the bristles against my hands, so I wash them out in a small plastic dish."

The key is to focus more on the method or theory behind the colors you choose then the actual pigments or placement.. That will make you grow faster. When it comes to cleaning brushes..

painting,37zz0c,SirMandudeGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 05:07:58 2015 UTC,I suggest starting with acrylics. But other than that I say just grab a canvas or hell even a big piece of cardboard and just start...don't think about making it realistic or perfect or even having it make sense. Play with color and get a feel for how the paint reacts to different amounts of water etc...as you get better you'll figure out with brushes you like and even find a style that you gravitate towards.  Good luck!! And post you work we all love to see:)

So maybe a good place to start is figuring out what you like, first - do you like looking at acrylic / oil type paintings more, or do you prefer looking at watercolor paintings?  I'm mostly self taught but recently started taking classes at local art centers, so I'd be happy to at least point you in some directions.  I've only been painting for 6 months so I'm new enough to remember the struggles of starting, but experienced enough to have some advice to give. :)"

painting,37zz0c,IzzyTheAmazing,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:46:50 2015 UTC,"As someone else said, they are more complicated.  With Acrylics, generally speaking you can apply paint to most surfaces as long as you throw down a layer of gesso (primer) and manage to get decent results.  With watercolor, you are learning to manipulate water as well as pigment.  So you need brushes that hold an adequate amount of water, and decent quality paper, you have to learn different techniques such as wet-into-wet and wet-into-dry, and how to make your paper not buckle and making sure the previous layer is dry before adding to it... well it can get complicated.  That said... it was way easier for me than acrylics cause I didn't enjoy acrylics.  It was bulky and I didn't like the look or the effects.   So personally, acrylics were NOT easier."
painting,37zlrs,amoxicillin875,3,Sun May 31 19:14:25 2015 UTC,I've painted paper Chinese lanterns. I believe it's the same type of paper.  I just used a soft brush and acrylic paint.  Don't over paint.  Doing go over and over it in the same spot or you are likely to rip the paper. Try to use something solid underneath the areas you are painting.    Search Pinterest for design ideas.
painting,37zlrs,Daannii,3,Sun May 31 21:47:23 2015 UTC,Thanks! I would not have even been worried about riping the paper if you hadn't said something. I have some ideas that might help eliviate the stress on the paper.   How do you feel (and I know this might be a sin for this /r) about Acrylic spray paint for a light Base layer and then brush over that with a soft brush for details? Or even Do a spray base of Black and then a silver/white mist sprayed over top to give it a Star/Galaxy Look to it.  Do you think either of those would work? I'm just trying to think of the best way to do this without Riping the Paper
painting,37zlrs,Daannii,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:39:58 2015 UTC,Probably would be fine as long as you let it dry between coats.  The wetter the paint the more potential for weakening the paper.  So I would just not move it around at all while it dries.

painting,37pbdq,lennythexdca,1 point,Fri May 29 22:50:53 2015 UTC,"Is this with a palette knife? I really like it, but I think you could place a little more confidence in your mixing and lose a little bit of the rendering (shaping the clouds, round sun, windows on buildings).   If you are using the palette knife, don't be afraid to be physical and use more paint. I like to think that a painting has two parts, the image and the paint itself.  Keep posting!"

painting,37sn2b,me_andthe_moon,3,Sat May 30 01:45:14 2015 UTC,"Examples of your work can probably help us figure out how your particular approach could be improved!  But some general advice I can give is that it's really better to do the background before your subject. A lot of beginner painters (myself included back in the day!) make the mistake of painting a really detailed subject and having to carefully squish a background in afterwards, which can disjoint the entire painting. Not to mention, when you complete the background first, it's a lot easier to pick the proper colors to complement it when you're working on your subject."
painting,37sn2b,inkminx,1 point,Sat May 30 02:53:19 2015 UTC,"That's what I have been doing.. I am just unsure of how to go about doing the background first. Like I said, I have only really been painting flowers, elephants, and birds. I guess I am nervous about how to fit the subject in - do I leave a sufficient amount of space blank for the subject, or pencil it all in first, or paint over some of the background? I guess I am nervous to mess it up.."
painting,37sn2b,MakeTheBootyClap,2,Sat May 30 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"I would recommend experimenting with background washes.  Just water down the paint until it looks like watercolor.  Then spread that shit wherever you need it.  Try blending multiple colors for gradient effects.  I usually try to pencil in my subject first, then add background around the outlines.  You can leave some white for the subject, but go over the lines so the background is complete."

painting,37qp2v,hwknd,1 point,Fri May 29 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"Nice! Great detail and edges. Reminds me of James Gurney.   What do you mean by postery?  Feedback:  I'm not really sure about how the flying frog's wings attach. Will they fold when not in use? How does that anatomy work?  There could be a little bit more ""space"" in between the background and the animals ( or make the background recede a bit better? It looks flatter than I think you meant it to be?)  That said I'm on mobile without my glasses on. Will look again on PC tomorrow morning:)."
painting,37qp2v,hwknd,1 point,Fri May 29 19:53:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the thoughtful comments.  I'm a big fan of Gurney's blog,  I must have picked up on some of the techniques!  By postery, I mean the colours are often a bit too opaque and there are too many hard edges - basically like children's poster paints.  In this picture I think I managed to avoid it by using lots of washes over the top, but it would be nice to avoid doing that sometimes.  I think this wouldn't happen with oils but I'm sure there must be ways to avoid it with acrylic.    With the wings, they are attached with extendable ribs - I based it on the fossil Xianglong.  It's kind of like a modern flying lizard except the wings are a different shape.  I think I probably should have put hints of the ribs in there to make that more apparent.  It's definitely a weird animal though.  I agree on the background - it does look too close, and a bit vertical at the top.  I think the angles of the fallen branches are the main cause, again especially at the top.  Something I need to watch for at the drawing stage, I think."
painting,37qp2v,ghostdate,1 point,Fri May 29 20:15:19 2015 UTC,:)  Wow. That fossil. I thought you made the creature up and thought the anatomy looked a little odd. Seems like the poor thing would get a wing stuck on something every 4 steps it takes. But it looks exactly like the picture.
painting,37qp2v,Blabagas,1 point,Sat May 30 05:54:49 2015 UTC,"His work might remind you of Gurney, because some of it is Gurney. Some of it is Gurche, some of it is Knight. Pretty much all of his work is copies or re-imaginings of other artists stuff. I thought this one looked familiar, and looked at his DA page a little bit. There's one where he put two white-feathered dinosaurs fighting, in a pretty famous pose from a Charles R. Knight painting.  Maybe I'm a snob, but I don't like when people heavily rely on someone else's art to make their own, and then don't give the original artist credit. Using a reference to create your own original work? Okay. Doing the same painting just with same colours changed? Not so okay. Composing a scene and posing the figures in it is a huge portion of the work of being an artist, so when you just latch onto someone else's work and recolour it, that's cheating in my mind."
painting,37qp2v,EviLincoln_,1 point,Sat May 30 02:18:07 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I really don't think that your comments about my work here are justifiable, and they come across as more than a little harsh.  The Dryptosaurus piece is meant as a tribute to the original and clearly states this in the description, there is no attempt to pass it off as original at all.  There's only one other work in my gallery that this could be said for (Neovenator), and its seven years old - I wouldn't do that again.  That leaves 50+ paintings that are completely original, you can hardly say ""pretty much all"" of my work is derivative.  I fail to see where I have copied Gurney at all.  And ""doing the same painting with the colours changed"" is really not a fair description of my work at all."

painting,37nrl9,thebakinggoddess,14,Fri May 29 00:10:57 2015 UTC,"I don't recommend starting with landscapes when learning to paint. Start with simple still life objects, spheres, an apple, and egg etc. on a white or colored background, light them, create a simple composition. It gives you a chance to relax and work with something really simple where you can learn to paint core and cast shadows as well as reflected light with out getting caught up in details and complicated textures. Start with a limited palette, color can get overwhelming, and it's a lot easier to get into when you restrict yourself to two/three colors when you are starting out. Look up some limited palettes and start with one you like.   As you get comfortable painting single object still lives, you can add more objects to the composition. Believe me, this is a very effective way to learn to paint. In my Illustration program, we spend two semesters painting like this and students make massive improvements regardless of their level."

painting,37nrl9,inkminx,6,Fri May 29 11:20:43 2015 UTC,"Very good progress for a first week! Kazikat gave some excellent advice for starting out, but I'll add that it's best to use a lot of discretion with using paint as-is directly from the tube. Un-mixed blues and greens especially can look very garish and fight for attention in a painting, so even if you're working with a limited palette at first, try playing around with mixing other colors (complementary, analogous, black, white, gray, etc) into them for different tones and shades.  Other than that, keep up the good work!"

The patterns are the result of color floated on either plain water or a viscous solution known as size, and then carefully transferred to an absorbent surface, such as paper or fabric. Through several centuries, people have applied marbled materials to a variety of surfaces. It is often employed as a writing surface for calligraphy, and especially book covers and endpapers in bookbinding and stationery. Part of its appeal is that each print is a unique monotype.

painting,37c7sj,araneaediscordia,2,Tue May 26 15:41:36 2015 UTC,"So first off, I like your brush strokes/handling on the toilet seat cover.  The biggest critique for this is composition, which comes down to planning ahead.  The way the brush and plunger go off the sides of the canvas look unintentional/accidental, like you started at the top and just ran out of room when you got to the bottom.  It also looks like you had a handle for the brush at the top left that you painted out later, and you can tell because that spot doesn't blend well with the rest of the background.  If you currently aren't sketching the basic shapes onto your canvas before you start painting, I highly suggest you start there."
painting,37c7sj,sonic_MRV,1 point,Tue May 26 21:38:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I was going for that weird pink plastic that one found in your great aunt's house.  I completely agree. I did several sketches, but when moving from the sketches to canvas, I discovered that pencil is not the optimal tool for that. It showed absolutely when I went to resize the seat. I didn't have the room I wanted for the plunger, but erasing was clearly an effort in futility. There are two spots where I mussed up and would have redrawn if I'd been smart enough to do it with charcoal or oil pastels.  Do you have a preferred method for the sketching? How do you pick what you use?"
painting,37c7sj,sonic_MRV,1 point,Wed May 27 05:05:31 2015 UTC,"I generally use pencil, and usually don't even bother with erasing if I mess up, since I'm about to paint over it anyways.  Were your former pencil marks showing through the paint?"

That will cover background better and give a more polished look.  When you paint, begin with your background first, mixing a little grayish blue into the colors to push the background further away and give the illusion of depth.  As you come forward, use less of the grayblue to give more contrast to closer objects.  Keep it up! Edit spelling"

painting,378pgi,srs5222,1 point,Mon May 25 21:41:44 2015 UTC,"multiple layers can do a couple of things. If it is the same color, yes makes it more vibrant and solid, if you do more layers of more color, then it makes it more dimensional. Kinda depends on what you want. For example, pop art uses mostly solid colors while more realistic would have lots of layers of different colors. And yes, not  neccesarily covering all the white, but letting them bleed into each other."

painting,378pgi,elbowdoodle,1 point,Mon May 25 22:10:52 2015 UTC,"This is stellar but given your experience it's probably just a combination of intuition and luck. You just need practice practice practice... I think your sloppy tendencies are because you don't have a technical background, whereas artists that choose to paint in such a sloppy style come from a really technical background (ex new casualists http://hyperallergic.com/74330/the-new-casualists-strike-again/)   What I mean by ""sloppy"" is that you have this awkward black border that's just a toneless black, all of your colors look straight out of the tube, you don't have an even application of paint, you have pure white showing in your background, and your skull might kind of be trying to represent space but it's just so sloppy. And yet, I love it. You're really highlighting the flatness of the medium (which is kind of what modernity is all about) and not at all attempting to conceal the fact that this is clearly a painting. It's just so fun, and not self-conscious, and you should really really keep painting"
painting,378pgi,elbowdoodle,2,Mon May 25 22:59:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I was pretty satisfied with this painting but I feel the colors should have been mixed to lose that flat look, but (as you mentioned) I liked the unintentional grafitti-sloppy look. I appreciate the in-depth answer, I'll totally keep painting!"
painting,378pgi,elbowdoodle,1 point,Mon May 25 23:33:48 2015 UTC,you are painting as if you are using watercolors rather than acrylics.  Your application is thin and starving.  Try using more water to blend edges or more paint.
painting,378pgi,DrDonutt,1 point,Tue May 26 00:12:16 2015 UTC,Heavier colors everywhere? Like even more shading on the skull or just heavier application of the light colors?
painting,378pgi,DrDonutt,2,Tue May 26 02:41:56 2015 UTC,"Try working in glazing.  Use a lot of water and thin out your paints and only use one or two colors to put washes of tone on your canvas.  The will map out all your highlights, mid tones and shadows. Let that dry (doesnt take long at all with acrylics)  Then use some still thinned but thicker than before layers of color on top of what you just painted.  Bring in your vivids if you want at this point.  Only use a limited palette and mix what you can from 4 or 5 tubes of paint.  (violet is a pain in the ass so just buy some)  I tell my painting students to avoid using white until the end of their painting.  Once you mix it into other colors they become opaque and loose all depth.  White reflects all light back to your viewers eye rather than absorbing it so white is obnoxious in my opinion.   Pure black is also not the best idea.  It creates a visual sink hole.  Try to mix it with the tiniest bit of another color from your palette.  It will be visually more interesting to your brain."

Or, if it's oil, if you paint too much, just wipe it off. It's just paint.   Anyways your white could use some color in it and your blue is suuuuuper saturated and your black also looks like it's lacking any sort of hue, but that's harder to see in a picture. (Mix your blacks from complements! It looks much better, I promise.) Your texture looks good, and your recreation of waves is really nice."
painting,3794v6,ecoevodevo,1 point,Mon May 25 23:16:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! It makes sense that you said my blue is saturated, i did not mix any other colors with it while making the sky OR the base of the lake. And I only used white for the ripples in the center.  The painting is now dry, but I realized I need reflections of the trees in the water. I cannot use an orange since the blue is already dried, so would you recommend using the same colors that i used for the actual trees? (I mixed green with black)  Also, by overdo I meant having too many things go on in the painting (like the white moon circles and ripples in the water). Maybe its just my personal taste that I see it that way."
painting,3794v6,ecoevodevo,2,Tue May 26 02:18:35 2015 UTC,"If you feel that you've overdone something, you can paint back over it to how it was before. Going back and forth can really help you solidify a composition.   Nothing is actually the color of the paint in the tube, so always mix a little bit of complement into your color before painting. It gives it a more natural look, and helps colors to mix.   You could attempt to glaze over the blue - add a little bit of orange with a lot of medium, and apply a thin layer to tone down the saturation. You could practice on a study before attempting this painting if you care a lot about it, or use this painting as a study and don't be afraid of failure. It takes a lot of experimentation before you're comfortable with this technique.   Anyways, keep painting! You're on the right track."

painting,36xfiw,mmcgregor_art,3,Fri May 22 22:33:14 2015 UTC,"Linseed oil is perfect. You'll need odorless paint thinner to clean your brushes and to thin the oil for under layers to prevent cracking (fat over lean). No need for black just mix burnt umber/sienna with ultramarine pretty much 1:1.  Limited pallets work fine (Zorn: Ivory Black, Cad. Red Medium, Yellow Ochre, Titanium White). Many artist prefer a double primary (a warm and cool for reds, yellows, and blues) to give a wider and more precise range.  Happy painting!"

painting,36uy3l,WhtUserNameIsntTaken,9,Fri May 22 09:33:35 2015 UTC,"I paint excusively with oils so I'm sure other painters here will have better advice for you, but here's my opinion :   Depending on what you paint on, gesso can be very usefull or useless. Most canvas are paint ready and you can paint directly on them, without gesso. If you paint on wood for example, wood can ""drink"" the water from your paint and give not so good results, so putting a few layers a gesso is a good idea.  Plus it will give you a whitish background that can be easier to paint on if your paint is not opaque enough to fully cover the wood color. I'm also pretty sure you can directly paint a few layers of white acrylic if you don't want to buy gesso.   Check youtube on ""how to prep a canvas for acrylic"" you will find a lot of videos showing you the process, same with wood panel.   I personally love to use a glass pallet, it's easy to clean and I can ""change"" the background to check what my colors will look like next to other ones. If you don't have a glass pallet, a wood one will do. You can put some plastic foil on it to clean it more easily if you wish."
painting,36uy3l,WatermelonDestroyer,1 point,Fri May 22 10:38:08 2015 UTC,"Thank You! Your info is quite useful. What about when im done with a painting Do i have to ""seal"" it?"
painting,36uy3l,WatermelonDestroyer,2,Fri May 22 11:21:51 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help :)  It's up to you to varnish it. Some do, some don't. Obviously if you want your painting to last in time it's better to varnish it as it will be more protected, but you don't have to do it. If you ever switch to oil painting tho keep in mind that you should wait around a year to varnish an oil painting, but you don't have to wait that much with acrylic as it dries way, way faster."
painting,36uy3l,flypanam,2,Fri May 22 12:06:35 2015 UTC,"Your surface should always be primed prior to painting. Depending on the substrate and the medium you will be using, it's not a bad idea to size your surface prior to applying your ground (gesso).  Sizing with PVA size prior to applying a ground creates a moisture barrier that prevents your canvas or panel from being effected by changes in humidity. It also prevents acid content in your paint from leaking into the raw canvas or wood. You should apply 2-3 coats, thinly.  The gesso layer is intended block out light from the surface and provide a toothy, bright white working surface. There are mixed opinions about whether or not a size is required with modern gesso, however, in my experience if you are priming something like a wood panel, it goes a long way to prevent warping. I also use significantly less gesso on a sized surface (good gesso is expensive).  In regards to palettes: every acrylic painter I've met loves disposable. Some prefer the covered palettes with the moisture sponge built in. As an oil painter, glass all the way!  I work at the headquarters store of an art store and get to chat with professional artists and industry people frequently, so if you have any questions feel free!"
painting,36uy3l,sin-eater82,2,Fri May 22 13:32:15 2015 UTC,"Just want to echo that pre-stretched canvases are almost always ready to be painted on.  To expand a little, gesso has two main functions for typical painting. As mentioned above, it acts as a primer.  But it can also be used to create texture. You can apply it and then sand it, apply more and sand, etc, until you have an extremely smooth surface.  You can apply it, sand it lightly, and paint on it in that state. Or you can apply it thickly in spots to create a stucko like texture. Or strategically apply it to specific parts of the painting to add a little bit of physical depth.  Also, you can add color to gesso.  Some people do that instead of adding white gesso and a ""ground"" (ground is just short for the ""background color"" added before you start actually painting).  Gesso is really cheap considering the coverage you get.  And you can usually get it at any art supply store (Michaels and AC Moore are serviceable, but not ideal. everything is $$$).  I've used a glass as a palette, plastic, palette sheets, wet palettes, etc.  None of them will make you a better painter or result in a better painting. It's mostly just preference and ease of clean up.  Wet palettes do have a legitimate benefit though (and you can make your own).  Acrylics dry very quickly.  A wet palette helps the paint stay wet/""open""/ usable much longer.  This is especially helpful if you need to mix up a good bit of a color and take a break before finished, working on a larger area, or if you want to hang on to a bit of this or that color to come back to a specific area later.  You can also use retarders to make the paint dry a little slower.  I like mixing on glass because it's really easy to clean. That said, don't buy a ""glass palette.""  Just buy ""glass"" without the upcharge.  Plastic is pretty easy to clean as well. Especially acrylics if you either wash it right away or let it dry and scrape it (the paint will just peel off for the most part)."
painting,36uy3l,sin-eater82,1 point,Fri May 22 13:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I pretty well decided that im making a trip to Good Will for a piece of glass and hair dryer just in case i want something dry like Yesterday lol. And i plan to use a Really fine misting bottle of water during the painting process to keep everything from drying when im not done with it. and all i need to do is buy any ole ""gesso"" and paint a couple layers on it, let it dry, sand it maybe and then paint away?"
painting,36uy3l,WatermelonDestroyer,2,Fri May 22 14:06:13 2015 UTC,Pretty much. I'd recommend a light sanding between coats (as I would with just about anything with multiple coats).  Check out willkempartschool.com.  It's a great resource for beginners.
painting,36uy3l,pha3dru5,2,Fri May 22 14:25:47 2015 UTC,"Also while you're at it, I think it's better to buy some acrylic medium instead of just using water to mix it. Some of them can make the paint dry faster or slower so you should definitely check it out."
painting,36uy3l,CindyChinn,2,Fri May 22 14:49:18 2015 UTC,"Gesso is meant to be applied to raw canvas to seal it before you paint on it (basically so you don't waste a bunch of expensive paint by having it get absorbed by the fibers of the canvas). The same concept applies if you like to paint on wood or other porous surfaces. Many pre-stretched canvases you can buy are already treated with gesso and can be painted on immediately. If you want a very smooth surface to paint on you can apply multiple extra layers of gesso and sand the surface in between coats to get the smoothness you desire.  To;dr: Gesso is not necessary if you're just beginning and are using pre-stretched art store bought canvases.   Your palette is purely personal preference, find what you like."
painting,36uy3l,gr8ver,1 point,Fri May 22 16:20:04 2015 UTC,"I use foam plates as a pallet, they are cheap and hold watered down paint when I get carried away.

Just because you are a beginner doesn't mean that you shouldn't start with professional quality paint and materials. However, I cheap out on my brushes because I trash them."

The first half hour was just mingling; the event included one drink ticket and an assortment of appetizers.   The organizers provided a canvas with a pencil outline of your pet, a handout with the photo you submitted, and a custom paint pallet with all the colors they believed you need to paint (I had four colors).   It was kind of like a paint by number deal. The handout had a few basic steps on how to execute your painting (paint the background first kind of stuff) and provided suggestions on colors.   There was one main artist/leader and about 2-3 assistants. The group size was about 50 or so. It was good turnout. People had photos of cats, dogs, chickens and rabbits.

painting,36fs2t,Dwhite89,6,Tue May 19 01:19:09 2015 UTC,"One main point: It's best not to use massive areas of pure black. If you have to use black, I recommend mixing your own using complementary colors.  The reason for the no-black rule is because in analog painting, it tends to flatten a piece out, and not in a good way. A custom mixed black has much more depth to it.  That being said, even if the intention here was a graphic cutout effect, perhaps treating the ""shadowed area"" with a bit of classical-esque rules could help convey more heart in this fairly emotive piece.  For example, using the rule of shadows being the complementary color of their light source, perhaps an orangish or burnt sienna color for the cutout area would accentuate the mood of the sky and hold the piece together in a singular atmospheric context.  If realism cutout was intended, study reflective light, rim lighting, and insect wing iridescence or light behind the ear type translucency."
painting,36fs2t,peepeeland,7,Tue May 19 06:26:30 2015 UTC,"Well done piece. The only thing that my brain tells me is that it wishes for smaller lines for the wings.

painting,36fs2t,estebanc1,3,Tue May 19 01:30:55 2015 UTC,"This is a good drawing, but an just an ok painting. When I first started painting I used to draw with a brush, that looks like what you are doing here. Your overuse of black is flattening everything out. There is some good painting going on in the sky, but the limited color pallet could be improved. No sky is ever just blue, and no shadow is flat black, the subtle color variations are what painting is all about. Knowing how to draw, which you clearly do, is a great starting point."

painting,36jzva,sfsf1010,3,Tue May 19 23:11:37 2015 UTC,"How to distinguish them? In what context?   The most obvious method of identification is by surface texture and provenance. If you have a painting from the 1700s, chances are that you'll have an oil painting. Visible cracking on a relatively glossy, flat surface are a pretty good indicator of an oil painting.   Frescoes are exclusively painted on plaster, so if it's an old mural in Italy- it's a fresco.   Watercolor is a relatively recent addition to painting, and is often readily recognizable due to how thin and translucent the pigments are. The white of the paper is usually the only white used in a watercolor painting.   I've personally never worked with tempera, but from my limited knowledge they tend to run rather on the small side. Tempera is traditionally made with an egg-based pigment binder that dries nearly instantly. This results in a flat, semi-gloss surface with lots of very small brushstrokes. I believe Mediaeval and early Renaissance artists used tempera, so if you've got a piece dating from those time periods it may very well be tempera.  I know next to nothing of encaustics, but the one or two I've seen in my local galleries tend to have a heavy, saturated, almost waxy look to them.  Are you looking for anything in particular to identify?"
painting,36jzva,Hippo_Kondriak,1 point,Wed May 20 00:22:58 2015 UTC,Not sure... finals tomorrow and I think the instructor will put up slides with a painting asking to identify what type of painting it is.

painting,36dl9n,free_ipod,1 point,Mon May 18 23:47:14 2015 UTC,"For me this painting is getting there, it just lacks some interest. The sloping hills are all fairly smooth blended strokes and don't suggest grass/rock/dirt or anything. I think you need to add some interest there with more variety of strokes. Maybe some harder edges in there with colours of similar value but slightly different hue (again, not an acrylic painter). I'm not saying you need to paint blades of grass or trees, but I think u need some variety in there.  There's also are darker patch in the sky above the top left mountain that looks out of place  Maybe the sky is too dark if the water is meant to be reflecting the sky. Maybe grey the sky down a bit and go a touch darker near the top and top left corner to lead the viewer in. Reflections could be emphasised.  The trees in the foreground don't fit with the rest of the painting because of the jump in the level of detail. They might work ok if you suggest texture in the rest of the landscape though  I  paint watercolour so huge grain of salt etc."

painting,360pp0,ecoevodevo,1 point,Fri May 15 09:48:36 2015 UTC,"Copying + pasting my response to Spencypoo: The technique best suited for oil is glazing/scumbling, where you apply a thin layer with a bunch of medium in it over the parts you want darkened in alternate opposite colors. You can also tint this to your heart's desire, and use it to change the color of something else. Scumbling is scraping a thin layer of thick paint (re: no medium) over what you want highlighted with a stiff brush. You can technically do both of these things with acrylic, but it dries so friggin' quickly and also doesn't have the same consistency. It will drive you nuts, and unless you're super versed in acrylic, will end in frustration.   What you get by alternating layers of opposite colors instead of just applying black is full control of the hue of the shadow and the physical layers of paint create sort of a dreamy depth to the darkness. Scumbling does the opposite, and it physically sits on top of the painting, pushing highlights forward. I highly recommend going to a museum so you can see these techniques in person, pictures don't really do it justice.  Plus, oil is generally better... (haha, what a statement, some artists will fight over this.) Once you go to oil you'll never go back. Or, at least, you'll learn which medium is better suited to your desired application. I use acrylic when I want to incorporate more weird textures (I've been on a glass bead phase right now) and plastic-y effects or if I'm sketching and want a quick dry time.  edit: I realize my glazing explanation is vague. If you want a warm black background, you apply a layer of a transparent red (say, alizarin) mixed with a bunch of liquin over the parts you want darkened. You then wait about 6 hours, or overnight. Then, you go back, and mix a transparent green with a bunch of liquin and test it over the red until it gives you your desired brown. If you're really really really good, it'll give you a black, but probably not. Your brown might be a little too bluish if your green didn't have enough yellow, so you mix a reddish-orange for the next coat. Continue until you're happy, from two to a hundred layers. There's also tutorials online if you have the patience."
painting,360pp0,ecoevodevo,2,Sat May 16 23:59:26 2015 UTC,"Shoot, I just saw that you posted this explanation.  That's very helpful, actually.  I find I can do glazing pretty easily with acrylic, especially b/c of the drying time.  I've never done it the way you suggested though, i.e. using complimentary colors.  I have always sort of painted a base coat using less saturated hues and then glazed over that with more saturated hues.  Gonna give the glazing for darkening/scumbling for highlights approach a try.  Thanks again!"

I'm pro-oil myself, and I'm very familiar with glazing/scumbling. I wouldn't consider glazing to be an oil specific thing.. or even a technique that oil is better suited for, on the contrary I think oil work better for the direct painter. The slower dry time allows wet into wet work that simply wouldnt be possible in acrylic, as far as glazing the fact that you have to wait a night to apply a second layer is a bummer.. when you mentioned oil techniques, i was sorta hoping you were going to drop a bomb on me, with some lightfastness/opacity/chemistry jazz that some big techies like George O'halan might talk about.  non the less, im in your camp completely.. down with acrylic!"
painting,360pp0,ecoevodevo,1 point,Mon May 18 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"ugh haha maybe it's where I live but applying a layer of acrylic glaze would gum up almost immediately... there's not a chance to smooth it out at all. I'm sure there's more rigorous techniques that are only possible in one vs the other, but I've never strayed very far from traditional applications myself.   Oil is just.. better. Creamier, with better color and texture overall, IMO"

So now the interesting thing was that people were moved a lot more by the originals and not so much by the copies, without them knowing it were copies. Supposedly the sample size of both groups was big enough to be representative.  I tried googling just now but nothing came up. But I did not try that long. If anyone has ever heard of this I'd really love any information! I know it might very well be BS but I'd love for it to be true. Also it would be a great answer to your question.

As a child, van Meegeren developed an enthusiasm for the paintings of the Dutch Golden Age, and later set out to become an artist himself. When art critics decried his work as tired and derivative, van Meegeren felt that they had destroyed his career. Thereupon, he decided to prove his talent to the critics by forging paintings of some of the world's most famous artists, including Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Gerard ter Borch and Johannes Vermeer. He so well replicated the styles and colours of the artists that the best art critics and experts of the time regarded his paintings as genuine and sometimes exquisite. His most successful forgery was Supper at Emmaus, created in 1937 while living in the south of France. This painting was hailed by some of the world’s foremost art experts as the finest Vermeer they had ever seen.  During World War II, wealthy Dutchmen, wanting to prevent a sellout of Dutch art to Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, avidly bought van Meegeren's forgeries. Nevertheless, a falsified ""Vermeer"" ended up in the possession of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring. Following the war, the forgery was discovered in Göring's possession, and van Meegeren was arrested on 29 May 1945 as a collaborator, as officials believed that he had sold Dutch cultural property to the Nazis. This would have been an act of treason, the punishment for which was death, so van Meegeren fearfully confessed to the forgery. On 12 November 1947, after a brief but highly publicized trial, he was convicted of falsification and fraud charges, and was sentenced to a modest punishment of one year in prison. He never served his sentence, however; before he could be incarcerated, he suffered a heart attack and died on 30 December 1947. It is estimated that van Meegeren duped buyers, including the government of the Netherlands, out of the equivalent of more than thirty million dollars in today's money.

painting,35pnp1,Craigdogg,1 point,Wed May 13 13:26:08 2015 UTC,"Perhaps shading and blending?  Where is your light source? Adding shadows can bring out a three dimensional quality. As well as adding lighter areas. (where the light source hits the tree.) It looks like you sort of did this on the tree that the bird is sitting on.   Even if it was a cloudy day, there would still be shadows.  Try and look for a reference photo of a the tree online, or take the photo yourself.   I try to avoid making a thick outline on things that need to be rounded. When I have done an outline, it usually makes it look 2D and it's harder to blend the colours.   I'm an amateur painter, myself. I'm sure a professional painter would have stronger tips.  These are just some things that I have tried that have worked for me."

Both are available in a lot of craft stores.  I find it's better to have only one or two high quality brushes rather than a bunch of cheapos, and I also find I can do >98% of all the acrylic painting I need to do with a good filbert. To that end I recommend picking up a nice Isabey Isacryl filbert. They're expensive but you'll find a reliable good-quality brush is worth it's weight in gold.  Again, just personal experience, but I'd recommend against student quality acrylics. When I was learning painting a couple years ago I bought a bunch and ended up wanting to throw them all in the garbage. Buying a small number of artist-quality paints (Golden, Liquitex Heavy Body, etc.) and mixing my own colors led to a much more effective and enjoyable painting process.  As always, your mileage may vary.  Happy painting!"

painting,35n7ud,got1337skillz,1 point,Mon May 11 21:57:35 2015 UTC,"I have some of these brushes. http://www.amazon.com/Langnickel-White-Paint-Brushes-Deluxe/dp/B0036UHZD6  I used them in my college oil painting class and they've held up reasonably well. I've had to crimp the ferrules onto the handles, but other than that they're still white.  I would also recommend Jerry's Artarama (www.jerrysartarama.com) for other things, like paint and paper. I buy Arches watercolor paper from them, as well as some other brushes.   You could buy Windsor and Newton Artisan oil paints for her. They are water mixable, so you can clean your brushes with water (and brush cleaner soap stuff). You can also use them just like traditional oils, with terp and other solvents, so they won't hamper her from her current painting method. They're just nice because they're easy to clean up and you don't have to deal with stinky solvents. I would recommend not buying the starter pack, but instead buying tubes of cadmium red, french ultramarine, cadmium yellow, yellow ochre, alizarin crimson, titanium white, zinc white, burnt sienna, raw umber, and pthalo blue. You can mix almost any color with these paints (this goes for all types of painting). You could also buy her linseed oil (http://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Drying-Linseed-75ml/dp/B005UNVMOU/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=arts-crafts&ie=UTF8&qid=1431493847&sr=1-1-fkmr0&keywords=windsor+newton+artisan+linseed) or the Windsor and Newton Artisan Medium (if you buy her the Artisan paints) (http://www.amazon.com/Winsor-Newton-Artisan-Mixable-Drying/dp/B000KNPDPO/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_1?s=arts-crafts&ie=UTF8&qid=1431493894&sr=1-1-fkmr2&keywords=windsor+newton+artisan+medium)  Good luck!"

painting,35g9q1,felixjawesome,3,Sun May 10 03:14:37 2015 UTC,"Consider taking a look at and studying the works of Cezanne and early Mondrian (particularly his tree paintings). They both would be considered ""post-impressionist.""   Impressionism places heavy emphasis on the brushstroke and gesture to simulate the illusion of sight...color happens on an ""atomic level"" working together to make a picture. Post-impressionism/Expressionism, however, takes liberties with the use of color in a poetic manner (think Van Gogh, Gauguin, Edvard Munch).   In other words, Impressionism is rooted in replicating the physical experience of light at a given moment (external), while Post-impressionism/Expressionism seeks to replicate the metaphysical experience of a given moment (internal)."

painting,35g9q1,mrmastomas,2,Sun May 10 05:32:27 2015 UTC,to get your trees like that you need to first paint the darkness of the bark and get the general color of it pretty much everywhere your sky is.  Then paint the sky on top and leave out the areas where you want the tree to stay.  Essentially you should paint the tree backwards and focus more on the shapes of the negative space the sky makes between the branches.

painting,35gk02,fgrissim78,1 point,Tue May 12 04:41:04 2015 UTC,"Aerial perspective:       Aerial perspective or atmospheric perspective refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as it is viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the contrast between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less saturated and shift towards the background color, which is usually blue, but under some conditions may be some other color (for example, at sunrise or sunset distant colors may shift towards red).

painting,35b40w,NailgunAcupuncture,1 point,Fri May 8 17:02:43 2015 UTC,"Consider the way the viewer is intended to navigate this piece.   For me, my focus is first on the object at the top center, then moves to the tentacles (?) in the lower right.  From there, I leave the painting.  Try to keep us in the work.  Provide something to guide the viewer back to the top object and into a loop of sorts.    This can be subtle.  The way the bottom-most tentacle is curved is helpful, for example, in redirecting the motion of the viewer's eye.  Also, though I am a hypocrite for pointing this out, you need to photograph your work more carefully.  Be sure it is in correct perspective (the bottom in this case converges toward a vanishing point) and as glare-free as you can manage.  Keep posting!"

painting,358rr4,RowanThePenguin,3,Fri May 8 02:29:54 2015 UTC,I agree. It all needs another coat. Preferably with no brush strokes to make the shapes more bold. It's a good minimalist design but it needs to look either more or less painterly.
painting,358rr4,kielbasarama,11,Fri May 8 10:44:38 2015 UTC,"It does seem incomplete.... At first I like the texture of the outline, but after I realize that's all there is I guess I want more. The blue background and the inner llama both seem like quick fill-ins. It's hard to see the inner leg-outline because its the same color as the body. I'd like more texture in the subject."
painting,358rr4,ChompyChomp,4,Fri May 8 02:23:00 2015 UTC,I really like the outline texture. Kind of looks like a sewn on appliqué. Maybe try adding smaller shapes within the llama with the same outline texture to make it look more fluffy and voluminous.
painting,358rr4,TwoToneRat,5,Fri May 8 03:03:11 2015 UTC,"I really like the outline style, I think maybe adding a plain black eye with a little bit of shine would help while also keeping it minimalist, or adding more texture to the body like swirls in the same style as the outline"

painting,358rr4,thirsty-bee,1 point,Fri May 8 03:16:11 2015 UTC,I was thinking a delicate lace with the same rounded edges as the llamas edges in the negative space. It would fill it in but not take away from the adorable llama.

Right now, it's teetering between them with the blue showing through a bit.  To really sell the graphic approach, I would put another layer or two on the llama (both colors) to flatten it out.  The modeled and shaded approach is obviously more involved and doesn't seem to be what you were going for."

This is the second one I've done completely  monochrome and it was actually at the request of the client. This has gone into her clinic, which is decorated entirely in stark white and lime green. I had originally intended to use a lot more straight yellow and blue (they are from Brazil and I thought using the flag colours might be fun). I'm doing something at the moment which brings back a contrasting colour set. I'm usually happy so long as it's bright and bold :)"

Like the light that is hitting the mannequin is not the same light hitting the model.  Her arm is casting a shadow but it is in shadow itself. Great work.

So perhaps in the future I might just go for the vinyl. Since this was my first time really working on my board and I love the hell out of it, I wanted to actually paint it myself. Make it mine. So I went with a more simple galaxy theme. I just finished it and I think it came out pretty well. At least a lot better than I could have done trying to paint tie dye. I'd add pics of it, but I'm not really sure how... Still new to using reddit."
painting,358n4v,groncan,1 point,Sat May 9 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"You can try painting primary colors in thick, wet concentric circles, then take an air hose and gently blow outward around the circles. Or if it's wet enough and you can mount the board perfectly balanced (and secured) on a turntable of sorts, you can spin the hell out of it.  EDIT: I have NO experience doing this. Those are just ideas that popped into my head. Half the fun of painting is experimentation."
painting,358n4v,groncan,1 point,Sat May 9 01:22:19 2015 UTC,"Find the tie dye image you like on Google images and have it printed on a vinyl wrap, like used on cars and trucks and wrap your board.

Also the banner... could be better. Right now it looks too childish. Why not hold a contest to make a better one ?  Edit : disable down-votes on submissions."
painting,35777v,WatermelonDestroyer,9,Thu May 7 19:13:35 2015 UTC,"There was another thread where a weekly constructive crit sticky was mentioned. That could be helpful. What about something like /r/phoshopbattles does where there is a weekly/monthly competition for the favourite painting submitted in that time frame, with some special flair as the prize?   What if 3 progress pics for self posts was mandatory in the comments? Seeing everyones different approache s might help stir up some more discussion."
painting,35777v,Satanslittlewizard,3,Thu May 7 23:37:40 2015 UTC,"There should be an ""About"" section in the sidebar so people know what to expect in this subreddit, and what kind of things to post and comment. What is allowed? What is not allowed? Can people try to sell their paintings here, or should that go in /r/Artstore? Are blog posts okay? What sort of image hosting site is recommended, just imgur?   Flair would be nice on users, but I think Flair on posts might be more useful. Do people want constructive criticism? Or maybe people would like to discuss a particular product, like ""Does this spray-on varnish work on acrylic paintings?"" and it could get a [Product] flair or [Discussion] flair. Or maybe ""Just set up my website, how does it look?"" could get [Business] flair?  I think subreddits that remove downvote arrows tend to be friendlier. I think the only reason anyone should downvote in this sub is if the post or comment breaks the rules in some manner, and in that case, it should be reported instead.   I actually like most of the rules in /r/art, it's just that ever since it became a default, the mods there have been too overwhelmed to keep up, and the post quality has turned into mostly fan-art. I think if the rules in /r/art were implemented here. the quality of the sub could really improve, without the default Reddit userbase upvoting anything with a celebrity or video game character in it."

painting,35777v,peepholecircus,4,Sat May 9 14:21:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't see that working well with all the different time windows, but the idea itself isn't bad. Maybe we could set up a monthly theme, where we could submit a painting we made just for it (so one per theme, month and user) and vote for the 5 or 10 best, then sell them for charity ? I don't think a lot of painters would be willing to give every penny away tho, so some part of the benefits should go to the painters, but maybe 20% for charity is a good start (that's what galleries usually take so it wouldn't make too much of a difference for the artists that way). Heck, I'm just throwing out numbers, I think this idea needs to be brainstormed. This has some potential."

painting,3551kh,JustToLurkArt,3,Thu May 7 06:50:56 2015 UTC,"My two cents: if you look through the sidebars of the other art related subs, you’ll notice they have a short description of the sub’s mission/purpose while /r/painting does not. If the sub doesn’t know (or communicate) its purpose – how will your clients or potential clients (subscribers) know? This is essentially the reason for the chaos.  Part of a good marketing strategy is to analyze yourself and your competition via a SWOT analysis: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. (For example, other art subreddits would be considered Threats i.e competition.)  This explains OP’s frustration for coming here to primarily ""give/get constructive criticism"" that does not “gain real traction and end up getting buried"". Why? Because /r/ArtCrit is an aptly titled sub with a community of over 8,000 readers whose main purpose is for artists to get feedback on their work. Doesn’t mean you can’t offer critique on /r/painting, but it's logical to assume that offering or encouraging any form of critique would not be considered a Strength and would result in a poor return on investment (ROI) here. What does this sub offer the client that is a Weakness in /r/ArtCrit?  Simply sorting this sub’s posts to “top” and “all time” reveals the answer:    Traditional (not digital) paintings on traditional substrates Individual artists (not posting other artist’s work)  Great paintings. (Specifically intermediate to advanced painters (not beginners) who may be part-time or professional)   So the mission of /r/painting might go something like this:   Welcome to /r/Painting! Functioning much like an artist cooperative gallery, this is the place where intermediate to advanced painters (who use traditional painting mediums and substrates) display their work in an ongoing group exhibit. Artists who post their work are strongly encouraged to interact with the sub’s subscribers and be prepared to discuss their philosophy, process & technique.  Even if the mods don’t use this paragraph, adding any basic description of the sub’s purpose/function should clear up much of the confusion and make the sub more popular."
painting,3551kh,WatermelonDestroyer,1 point,Thu May 7 15:00:00 2015 UTC,"While I mostly agree with you, I find it a bit harsh to completely dismiss beginners. Where else would they go to find criticism and tips to get better?   What I'd like to see on this sub is flairs like ""beginner"", ""technique and tips"", ""WIP"", ""CC needed"", ""showing off my immense talent"", ""discussion around painting"", etc."
painting,3551kh,JustToLurkArt,1 point,Thu May 7 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"Where else would they go to find criticism and tips to get better?   Seriously? Everywhere, pretty much any and every art related sub on Reddit, but specifically see:  /r/Learnart - A community advice/critique panel for beginners.  /r/ArtCrit - For artists to get feedback on their work.  /r/DigitalPainting - To nurture growing digital artists; may receive/give constructive critique.  Do what you want, but as OP has bravely pointed out, your clients (subscribers and potential subscribers) are unhappy, confused to this sub's mission & purpose and the sub is stagnant.    What I'd like to see on this sub is flairs like ""beginner"", ""technique and tips"", ""WIP"", ""CC needed"", ""showing off my immense talent"", ""discussion around painting"", etc.   It would serve you well to spend some time with this sub's competition on Reddit. All the other art subs offer what you mentioned, cater to beginners and offer critique – and frankly they are already doing all these things better and more efficient than this sub. As I wrote, a popular brand provides outstanding service that focuses on your strength's while capitalizing on your competition's weakness. A simple sort of this sub will prove intermediate to advanced artists are engaged and popular here. What you should be making note of is that beginners can go anywhere but intermediate and advanced artists are underserved.   Do as you wish, I'll go back to lurking and you are certainly free to ignore hard data and fundamental marketing principles."

painting,3551kh,JustToLurkArt,1 point,Thu May 7 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"Just remember - don't think too small. What I mean by that is, consider that /r/painting could potentially become the premier global online resource for intermediate & advanced painters. As I said, beginners are well served (I would say over served) in other subs, but a little exclusivity here may very well attract discussions, artwork and posts from world class painters. Wouldn't any beginner benefit from reading those posts? I'm not a snob by any means and I don't mean to come off as one, but as a previous marketing person, you must define your customer, to properly design and build the product."

painting,34vxs6,retrobuddha,1 point,Tue May 5 15:26:28 2015 UTC,"My process was this:   I found a variety of reference photos to draw from. I then sketched a small study of the painting to get a feel for the proportions and scale. Then I sketched the image onto the board and spent a while perfecting that and marking off shadows and making sure the siding of the house was relatively even and straight. The painting process was mostly doing passes of thin to medium thickness. When I got everything basically how I wanted I started glazing in variations of color all over the place to give it more depth. I use golden glazing medium and golden artist acrylics, I find them to be a lot creamier and pigment dense than liquitex. The paint on this one is not very thick at all actually. The depth comes from the portrayal of light and shadow. I could post progress pics if you are interested."

painting,34r73l,Mojo884ever,4,Sun May 3 21:21:07 2015 UTC,"Hey. It's going to be ok. Oil painting is hard to jump into. It' messy and smelly but once you leap into it it gets easier and enjoyable. You don't need liquid white. You just need white. Start slow. Best thing is to start drawing things before painting, but if you want to paint, start slow there too. Try to do swatch tests of your colors first just to see what they look like and how they blend. Don't put pressure on yourself to make a finished painting. Do exercises of trying to blend blue into white.  I did the same thing 20 years ago and it was a huge mess. Before tutorials try to learn what your supplies are and how to clean your brushes and use a palette. it can be very disappointing when everything looks muddy because you are only using a couple of brushes and not cleaning them. I would usually recommend starting with acrylics which are easier to start with but you can stick with oils just don't be hard on yourself. Bob Ross didn't make happy trees his first time. Check out other ways of how to start painting. His way is a little sudden and takes a lot of earlier experience to control your brushes like that. Learn about other artists and how they paint. The more you learn the more confident you will become and this will show in your work.  https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-history-basics/artists-materials-techniques/painting-materials-techniques/v/oil-paint  http://painting.about.com/od/paintingforbeginners/a/first_painting.htm"
painting,34r73l,sherrying,2,Sun May 3 22:58:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much experience you have with art, but that's the thing about great art and great artists -- they make it look all too easy.  If you're just beginning, I would STRONGLY suggest starting with acrylic paints.  Dries in about 1/100ths of the time, and makes correcting (painting over) errors that much easier.    If you have the time and money, take a class at your local community college.    Most importantly of all, KEEP AT IT!"
painting,34r73l,CHESTER_C0PPERP0T,1 point,Sun May 3 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"My oil painting teacher originally started us all out in gouache as it behaves similarly to oil without the involved setup and breakdown. It allows you to get a feel for various techniques and is workable wet into wet, picks up the under layer of color if you do enough strokes or can sit on top of the previous layer without disturbing it.   The reason why most people have a hard time with the bob ross technique is that his oil paints are ""drier"" out of the tube than usual oils, hence why they distribute more tightly/with less smudging over the liquid white. I recommend becoming familiar with liquin or gamblin's neo-megilp to either mix with your oils or as a base for wet on wet, it may be just my preference but I could swear they change the way the paints react to my brushes as well as how they dry.  Become familiar with fat over lean as a technique for building up layers of oil so you can avoid muddiness and build depth into your pieces. Keep separate brushes for different media, I'm a brush snob and will admit my brush collection probably rivals the cost of my paints. I invested in a silicoil brush cleaner (I now have 2, 1 for all light colors and 1 for all darks and a separate tall mason jar I pour used turp into and let the pigment settle, pour off the top which is relatively clean and reuse) and a nice big acrylic palette that can be cleaned easily by scraping if the paint dries on.   Don't be discouraged, like the other posters are saying: keep at it!"
painting,34r73l,namesofpens,1 point,Mon May 4 00:49:16 2015 UTC,"Oil is much harder than acrylic for the new painter.  Bob Ross' techniques involve very careful control of brushes and knives to achieve the results he did.  Much of the brush strokes are very very firm, and the palette knife work is extremely delicate (imagine shaving with a sword).  These take a great deal of practice to master, and he had been doing it for years before he began doing television.  Be patient above all, and don't rush yourself.  Take your time and practice using all the tools at your disposal.  And don't forget:  Practice doesn't necessarily mean painting pictures, it can also mean just doodling with paint."
painting,34r73l,MarcusDrakus,1 point,Mon May 4 22:39:59 2015 UTC,"Can attest to acrylics over oils. I'm dedicated to failing miserably in this medium before moving to oil paints. :)    I started with drawing first. Then worked my way into painting. My album, so far: http://rasalgethi42.imgur.com I'm quite the newbie but I'm getting better."
painting,34r73l,Ras-Algethi,1 point,Tue May 5 14:02:41 2015 UTC,The problem was the lack of liquid white. It is very important for the technique. It helps blend everything and lets you move the paint on the canvas. I made the same mistake in my first one. I am now pretty good at the technique. Don't give up on oils yet. If you do send the stuff to me! :P
painting,34r73l,richardwad1,1 point,Fri May 8 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"Also, you can get liquid white at craft stores, but it is super easy to find online. Just search for ""Bob Ross liquid white"" or ""Alexander Art Magic White""."
painting,34qbv3,texastoasty,2,Sun May 3 16:54:08 2015 UTC,"You sort of have to use paint for fabrics initially. You can't really change it after its dry.    Most acrylics won't wash out. However they most definitely will crack and break up. Especially in the dryer.   You can buy ""fabric textile medium"" at most craft/fabric stores. If you mix it 50/50 with acrylic paints, it will make the paint into fabric paint.  Also makes it go on very smoothly.  I love the stuff for painting canvas bags/shoes.   Won't crack and chunk off like plain acrylic will.  I usually seal shoes with some clear spray paint, but I would use it on shirts or anything that might get washed.   If you used tempra paint, most of that will wash out. Might stain a little on light fabrics.  But they are pretty ""washable""."
painting,34qbv3,Daannii,1 point,Sun May 3 18:10:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I have no idea what paint it was, I didn't bottle it, we just played with it."
painting,34qbv3,Daannii,2,Sun May 3 18:16:38 2015 UTC,Most likely tempura.  It's very inexpensive.  Comes in larger bottles.  You can even buy it in gallon sizes at most craft stores.  It's nontoxic. Safe with kids and the environment.  Will wash out of hair.    Acrylic paint will not wash out of hair.  It basically becomes rubber-like when it dries.

A few of my expressionism works have done well here, and I've seen other abstract works with high upvotes as well. /r/painting is just a finicky place when it comes to non-representational work because it's the internet and if there isn't something that grabs their attention right away they dismiss it. Extremely realistic work is easy to appreciate quickly because you can instantly see the talent, abstract work is different and usually needs to be seen in person to fully understand."

If it isn't a real painting cleaning it will be much much easier.  How does the finish look on it? Cracking at all? Worn away/miscolored in any areas? You will want to clean the finish on top of the painting, not the paint itself, so take a second to look at where the finish might be weak or missing.  What exactly is the damage done to the painting. Are they paint marks, black rubber marks, dust, ect? Different gunk is handled with different methods/materials."

painting,34ewhb,Fishbulb341,8,Thu Apr 30 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"wow... I love that work... i think maybe your thoughts on it feeling too subtle could be fixed with more contrast. adding colour could work too, artist's choice, but i don't think it's the end all answer. If you added darker values, especially behind the figure the blue/grey scheme could still work very well. love this!"
painting,34ewhb,abenevolentgod,2,Thu Apr 30 16:12:24 2015 UTC,Exactly what I saw. I little more blue to lighten up spots while putting some darker and black contrast in spots and the bckground could really make the whole concept pop and feel more alive as oppose to static.
painting,34ewhb,Emerson73,2,Thu Apr 30 22:35:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think putting some darker value behind the figure would work really well, probably give it sone real deep space. Good idea. Think I might put like some dark foggy type stuff back there, maybe repeat some of the shapes from the top, but way darker and in lower contrast. Maybe not too much though, could make it too busy. Got me thinking, thanks!"
painting,34ewhb,ajayfalcon,4,Fri May 1 19:38:15 2015 UTC,"I really like your painting and I agree with u/abenevolentgod, more contrast behind the figure as well as the top of the painting."
painting,34ewhb,hsepiavista,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:56:36 2015 UTC,"I can see that. But as for the original question: more color or not. I would say not necessarily. It doesn't look like an underpainting at all to me. The color scheme is subtle, but not absent. If anything, you could give those globe things that are in that big structure a little color; maybe even blue, but just a little more blue than they are now so that they stand out a little more."
painting,34ewhb,ecoevodevo,4,Sat May 2 14:28:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's because it looks like you've left the ground uncovered. The really matte greenish-grey sky pushes forward in an awkward way because it's so opaque. You could try applying a clear layer of varnish or medium to the whole thing to give it all a similar consistency, or glaze the background to a deep, luminescent black or brown. You get away with doing it in a single layer but it looks like four (blue/orange/blue/orange) would really do the trick"
painting,34ewhb,ecoevodevo,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:51:38 2015 UTC,"Yup, that grey area is just grey gesso, I'll be honest, part of my decision to go with the limited palette was me trying to be expedient, it's the end of the semester and I'm running out of time. I like the idea of layering compliments, it's something I've been wanting to try, but I haven't, probably just because new things are hard sometimes. This is a good reason to try it out!"
painting,34ewhb,glacierthief,1 point,Fri May 1 19:46:24 2015 UTC,"yeah! it's easier than it sounds (it just takes time between the layers, oil with a lot of liquin is 4-6 hours to dry) and it creates a great effect. You'll be a renaissance master before long!"
painting,34ewhb,HerEyesOnTheHorizon,3,Tue May 5 02:31:36 2015 UTC,You have a good start there! There are some interesting things happening in the form behind the figure. The shapes and the overlapping really give it a nice sense of volume.   The reason that it feels like an underpainting right now is that you have little variation in the colors. The blue you have in the figure is exactly the same blue as in the foreground and in the object. You can still keep it a limited pallet but use different blues (both mixed and other blues). Perhaps playing more with warm and cool shades of blue to make the figure come forward (warmer shades) and the background recede (cooler shades) more. You could also put in some glazes of other colors to give it more visual interest while still keeping it blue and grey for the most part.
painting,34ewhb,fairiesgotme,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"I really dig the idea of using warm and cool blues. The thought never crossed my mind. That's probably definitely gonna happen.

painting,34g152,nlubin,1 point,Sat May 2 03:54:57 2015 UTC,"The best way to learn is through experience. You can have every art book in the world but if you never put your brush to canvas then you will never get better. Paint a painting, look at it subjectively or have someone more experienced give you advice on what you need to work on, then try again with a focus on what you are missing in your art. Learn basic techniques though videos and any books you find. Classes should help a lot :) Don't be too harsh on yourself, if you demoralize yourself it will become a chore to paint, relax and enjoy yourself but put lots of thought into your painting until it becomes second nature. I hope this helped :)"
painting,34g152,FrigidPhoenix,1 point,Fri May 1 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"I started painting recently too, just a couple months ago.  What I found to be really helpful at first was to just watch videos on youtube and various PBS painting shows and really pay attention to what they are actualy doing.  Then, just start painting with the techniques you've seen in the videos in mind.  Dont try to actually paint the same painting they are painting, just pay attention to the techniques.  Search youtube for Jerry Yarnell (he has a painting show on PBS) and you should find some videos where he's painting a landscape of sedona arizona (mostly rock formations).  I really liked it because it demonstrated a lot of useful, basic stuff like underpainting, and getting highlights to look right.  Then I painted some rock formations myself and was amazed at how pleased I was with the result.  It was no masterpiece or anything, but I didn't hate it, and I had a lot of fun doing it."

Otherwise unfortunantly it really is a case of practise makes perfect, as others have said."
painting,34g152,Blabagas,1 point,Sat May 2 04:55:20 2015 UTC,"Start with the basics.  The basics depend a tiny little bit on what you're painting and from what reference, but in short:    Get your proportions right (learn drawing), get your values right (I find it really helpful to do an underpainting for this, either in grayscale or with burnt umber or something), then get your colors right (in the same value as the underpainting!).  If you're painting people/animals, have an anatomy book close-by, know what's ""underneath"". Think in 3D shapes.  If you're painting landscapes, learn some perspective. Read up on color theory (Richard Robinson has a really good landscape color course for sale if you're willing to buy)..  Know that when you're using photographs as reference images, color in photo's is NOT like color you see with your eyes.. so don't copy the color in the photo, but use your knowledge first."
painting,34g152,hwknd,1 point,Sat May 2 14:16:26 2015 UTC,"The advice given so far is solid.    However, I would also add that it might be helpful to get a bunch of cheap canvas panels or masonite boards (depending on the surface you'd prefer... actually, get both and you can decide that from experience!).    Think of these as sketches - they were cheap and you shouldn't feel bad when you throw a few away or never show them to anyone.  Invest in better surfaces when you feel feel more confident."

I haven't started yet, but I'm working on putting one together for myself.   If they ask you for free work ask them for free work. Usually that'll put it into perspective for people.

He work is known for a heavy impasto look and because of that he's been VERY financially successful, so I guess one could argue the thick paint has allowed him great opportunity to be charitable.

painting,33xkam,CswBizzel,4,Sun Apr 26 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, feedback.  First you have to tell me what you're trying to accomplish.  I mean: the image lacks depth, the proportions are off, the colors are pretty basic, and that odd painting in the background draws the eye away from the portrait itself.  However there is nothing inherently wrong with any of this because the picture has intense character.  You really get not only the personality of your tutor, but definite hints of your own personality.  Which is really what art is, yes?  The interpretation of reality through the lens of an individual personality.  If you want the painting to be more realistic, I can add some general advice but that may not necessarily improve it.  On the other hand, you might want to go the other direction and get even more interpretive and unconstrained by what it is and more about what you see, and I can (if nothing else) give some examples of similar artists whose technique you can study.   But, first, you have to explain your intention :)"
painting,33xkam,neodiogenes,3,Sun Apr 26 17:58:21 2015 UTC,"First of all, thanks for the feedback.  Personally, I am not interested in making my paintings more realistic, in fact I dislike realism. The proportions are off if you compare them to reality, yes, but the proportions of Van Gogh's portraits were off as well (not that I am comparing myself to him). But where is the line drawn in that regard? What is acceptable and what is not acceptable? I guess if it looks right even if it isn't? If that makes sense.  I agree it lacks depth. Is it the choice of the colour in the background or lack of light to dark? or both?  The painting in the background is a mini replica of a series of portraits my tutor is currently doing (they're very simple paintings but quite effective) I wanted to paint that in to symbolise his art side without making it predictable, i.e, an artist at the easel. I was worried that the mini painting would intervene with the portrait but I couldn't resist painting it in.     My intention was to paint him as he appears (it is a fairly accurate likeness) while adding a touch of his artistic side in as well. But on the whole my aim was to paint him as the tutor and not the artist."
painting,33xkam,neodiogenes,3,Sun Apr 26 18:23:55 2015 UTC,"You're definitely on the right track for what you want to accomplish.  I got a ""Van Gogh"" vibe from the picture, obviously there's some resemblance to this classic.  And there's a similarity in how Van Gogh makes his background seem on the same level as the subject, though his texturing adds its own kind of depth.  There are different ways to push the background of a picture back in space.  The easiest is with perspective lines that give a sense of space, but if you're avoiding those, then using darker or more muted colors does it (or at least, less contrast), or a pattern that continues behind the subject.  In your picture you have some painting around the subject's head, which makes it part of the foreground.  If you used strong (but muted) vertical or horizontal lines across the back wall, that continued as if behind the subject, that would do it.  Here's a crude example of what I'm talking about.  I changed the background to a simple repeating pattern of horizontal lines, and darkened it a bit.  Now it looks more like something behind the subject.  You could just as easily use a pattern of vertical lines, or diamond shapes, or butterfly wallpaper, or whatever.  The bright white color in the painting makes it ""pop"" out to the same level as the subject.  If this is by intention, that's fine, but if you mean to make the painting something that exists behind the subject you can use more muted contrasts by toning down the white.  Or you can just move the painting to where it's partially behind his head.  That gives an instant sense of space.  By the way, Van Gogh's proportions (or rather perspective) in his portraits isn't really all that off.  One easy way to check is to look at your picture in a mirror (or photograph it and flip in Photoshop).  The distortions tend to jump out at you where they exist."
painting,33xkam,neodiogenes,2,Sun Apr 26 21:15:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks so much for a great answer. I am really starting to see what you mean now. The proportions of the shoulder flipped looks way off and the pattern you did in the background improved it ten-fold. All I can say is thank you for taking the time to make those alterations. It was honest critique that I was after at the end of the day."

painting,33y1ej,mattonna,2,Mon Apr 27 05:38:06 2015 UTC,It's actually just for cleaning up quickly while painting so that things don't get too out of control. Tissues work much better.

painting,33y05y,ladycoleopterist,2,Sun Apr 26 18:45:41 2015 UTC,"Hog and sable. The latter is the finer and smoother. Can't beat Escoda and Isabey for brands. For budget, Robert Simmons 'Signet' is very good.  Hog is fine for working on canvas. If you're working on glassy smoth panel and for some reason wanted no brush marks you would use sable. Synthetics are inferior, IMO."
painting,33y05y,artmob,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:58:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks I'll definitely check those out! Another question, are sable brushes for oils the same as watercolor ones? I have a couple for watercolors or should I look for ones specifically for oil painting?"
painting,33y05y,artmob,1 point,Sun Apr 26 20:45:06 2015 UTC,"Yep, the same stuff from the same fuzzy critter, but with a shorter handle and perhaps different hair lengths and profiles. I can't think of any good reason to keep watercolor and oil brush separate so long as you clean thoroughly, but I certainly do. Watercolor brushes might be nice for doing oil washes, but they may not be stiff enough for pushing un-thinned paint around."
painting,33y05y,sobriquetstain,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:04:02 2015 UTC,Yeah I would definitely keep hem separate I was just wondering if buying more of the same ones I already have would work or not. Thanks for all the info!
painting,33y05y,hwknd,1 point,Sun Apr 26 21:42:22 2015 UTC,Sable!  Kolinsky sables are fantastic (but pricey) but there are environmental concerns (imports of animal products like furs etc) because of the animal hair used to make them. if you can find anything close to this or find some still in stock anywhere in your area then nab them up.   http://bagscblog.com/2014/10/04/where-have-all-the-kolinsky-sable-brushes-gone/
painting,33y05y,hwknd,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"I currently like the Rosemary & Co Eclipse ones. Round size 0 and 1. They leave no brush marks either but are slightly stiffer (/less floppy) than Kolinsky sable brushes and I like the little extra control that gives me. They are far from being as stiff as hog brushes, which I really don't like. ( I think these are synthetic too, so no animals harmed, not sure though. ) They keep their shape well."
painting,33weu8,eatcitrus,4,Sun Apr 26 07:18:14 2015 UTC,I would say not to use cheap brushes because the hairs can fall out on your canvas and it is so annoying.  At least that's my experience. I've used cheap and fancy paint and both are fun.
painting,33weu8,loki93009,4,Sun Apr 26 13:25:00 2015 UTC,Using cheap brushes is like running in sandals
painting,33weu8,long435,3,Sun Apr 26 14:39:49 2015 UTC,Use as good of both as you can afford.
painting,33weu8,matter472,2,Sun Apr 26 14:38:58 2015 UTC,"I suppose it depends on the effect you are going for. I use acrylic and mix expensive paint with cheap paint to stretch it. Sometimes I use cheap paint because it's less opaque or mixes in a neat way. I use cheap brushes sometimes but only if I intend to smoosh the heck out of them, and the loose hairs do drive me crazy. Expensive brushes are almost always awesome."
painting,33weu8,MentalFallout,2,Sun Apr 26 14:37:19 2015 UTC,"Think of it, an art teacher might advise students to use student grade paint and quality brushes because they won't keep their bad student paintings but they will keep the brushes. But that is just for students.  Anyone else working in oils who is not a student should use the best quality paint and tools that they can afford."
painting,33weu8,FrigidPhoenix,2,Sun Apr 26 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"Don't use cheap brushes - they are probably the best tool to make an investment in if you were to invest in only one thing. Cheap brushes feel different, the hairs fall out (a pain to get off your painting) and they often just don't last long. Get as good quality paints as you can justify buying, if you are a beginner you might be best off starting with cheap paints, using them to just learn how painting works, techniques etc. Then move up to higher quality when you are able too. I originally started with paints and brushes from the dollar store, I felt I was fighting my materials more than using them to assist me. When I upgraded in university it was like a whole other world! haha. :)"
painting,33weu8,ProductofUnreality,2,Sun Apr 26 17:00:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say buy mid grade brushes until you know what brushes you love and then buy the best ones you can. No point in buying an expensive sable brush if you end up preferring synthetic. Same with paint really. What's the point in buying the best oils if you end up preferring acrylic?   Don't get student grade anything unless you want your work to look student grade. That goes for canvas and mediums, too. What's the point of spending a lot of money on paint and brushes when your canvas is inferior or your mixing said paint with garbage medium?"
painting,33weu8,NailgunAcupuncture,2,Thu Apr 30 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"Are you good about cleaning your brushes?  If not, that money can vanish quickly.  If you are just starting out, I would lean toward brushes.  If you are experienced, I would favor the paint."
painting,33weu8,DanaCommand,1 point,Sat May 9 02:44:00 2015 UTC,"I work in an art supply store and some people swear one way, some swear the other. Its tough because you could make the same painting twice; one with ""artist"" quality paint, and one with ""student"" quality, and they would look totally different. You could try and do the same painting with good quality brushes and cheapo brushes, and unless you are skilled with tools, the one with good brushes is definitely going to look better. I think it depends on a level of skill, so for most people (especially starting out) good brushes are very important."
painting,33weu8,WatermelonDestroyer,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:05:11 2015 UTC,"I never heard one of those statements, but I bought cheap brushes on sales, I take very good care of them and they don't loose their hair. I would say that buying good and expensive brushes but not taking care of them is a bad idea, but cheap brushes can be good enough.   I also use cheap paint sometimes, mostly when I do a painting that I know will be bad, but good paint feels better, is easier to paint with and give better results.  Also keep in mind that letting brushes rest in water will make them loose hair faster, so if you want them to last longer, keep them dry when you can."

I would lay thick brushstrokes underneath (Much like what you can see towards the bottom left) then for texture/highlights and small details I would mostly get a lot of paint on my brush let the acrylic paint fall/drip onto the canvas then sometimes lightly bush/push the glob to give it a bit of direction and flow."
painting,33qku8,caitlinisgreatlin,2,Fri Apr 24 18:15:56 2015 UTC,Is the eye creature on the right in the foreground or the background?If it's in the foreground perhaps it needs more contrast? The way I read it was that the green part was closer to the viewer than the creature on the right.

painting,33okwk,Donniej525,2,Fri Apr 24 12:31:23 2015 UTC,"I used glazing medium to do the fog on the hills, it really helps a lot, first time I've used it. I think if you want to have smooth colour gradients in acrylic you need to use as big a brush as you can for the area and don't skimp on the paint. If you have very little paint down on the canvas it will probably dry before you can get a nice blend going on. I use Atelier acrylics which have a slightly longer open time than most other brands so that helps too!"

Like wtf how do you transport it? What about smudges? Let's think this shit through, gawd.  It's a very evocative image, and I firmly believe in the power of therapeutic art. Keep rocking on and enjoy the creative process. There is absolutely value in painting from a place of emotion.  If you're looking for technical pointers for working toward a more realistic approach, there are 2 areas where I see you can focus. First is life drawing and working on drawing/painting things as they appear in front of you, because currently the painting is heavily icon-based. Second is color theory, you can get a more lifelike and fleshed out result by using shadows in shades of browns, blues, and pinks instead of mixing black directly into your flesh tone."
painting,33ezj1,cajolerisms,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:32:17 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your advice and criticisms! I will use that approach when I start my next painting. This painting was purposefully not super realistic. I was going for a Tim Burton-esque vibe with the colors and the proportions of the eye to the face. For my next painting (which I hope not to be so dark) I will definitely add colors to flesh out the skin and brighten up the painting overall! And the borders are just what I learned in art class :)

painting,339th0,InvasionSensation,3,Mon Apr 20 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"Looks great. Congratulations on working hard and being proud of your work! I would like to see a few things different actually: some color and tint variations on the spirit entity, it seems very flat and I can't feel its distance (although I see it will with your size and scale and atmosphere). On your pillars, some darker darks would help it shape up a bit, and the tops seem a little flat. I really can't tell what the crosses are bowing to and it doesn't have to just be a design problem, you symbolism is strong so putting it closer, compositionally, would have helped.. Finally, I'm sure its intentional, and not a sunlight thing, but I don't understand the color change in the grass.  I really like your effective hand on the mountains, subtle textures, movement etc, but I love a painter with a purpose! May I ask, what does this mean?"
painting,339th0,papagert,2,Mon Apr 20 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"Oh, wait... Is that a  phone? I think I am making that out now...let's delve back in with this in mind..."
painting,339th0,papagert,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:48:18 2015 UTC,"OK I still don't get it hahaha, mostly I think the grass is confusing me"
painting,339th0,papagert,4,Mon Apr 20 21:49:27 2015 UTC,"Hey! Thank you so much for your critique.  It may sound a little hollow or dishonest but I really didn't have a 'purpose' in mind when I painted this. I just got some ideas and did it. I think you can draw some dependence on technology being a bad thing, etc, etc, but I really just started with an idea of having a creature with crosses opening up on its back. Then I painted an iphone, and from there, we have this.   I am also most proud of my mountains! This was the first time I didn't do Bob Ross mountains but I really liked how they turned out.   I really do need some highlights, etc, on my creature. He doesn't have a whole lot of color variation, and the little he does have is washed out by this cruddy picture.   The thing with the grass has to do with this little guy escaping the wheat-like field he is in. I originally was going to have him coming out of hole next to the yellow and sneaking his way through a fenced in farm-like area but I scrapped that part of it awhile ago but kept the dual colors in. I like how it looks but I totally understand where you are coming from, I agree that it is probably too jarring and distracting.   Again, thank you so much for your critique. One question I have for you is, you said in my pillars you would have liked some darker darks. The thing is, then the color would be bordering on black which I used a bit of in my creatures face. I have read that you aren't supposed to use the darkest of your colors except for what you want your audience to focus on. Can you clarify this a bit? I struggled with those damn pillars a long time as well and I could never get them to be in the middle ground, I either pushed them way too far back with color or they felt way too close, which I feel is where they stand as of now.  Edit: I should say also that I am relatively new to painting, and any art in general. I started in November and have been slowly trying new things. I would love anymore recommendations for things I should work on."
painting,339th0,papagert,2,Mon Apr 20 22:06:45 2015 UTC,"Usually, we are afraid to make objects as dark (and as light) as the ought to be and it seems to be from a consistency and relativity issue. To bring out more darkness in a background object doesn't mean necessarily adding more darkness, rather applying the appropriate lights to the object in the front. In your case you seem to be lacking prominent light planes that are hitting the intense light source, should be an easy fix since the crosses are moving forward through distance; start adding a light plane on your furthest cross and add white (or what ever you light color is) a little more to you pallette the closer you get to the foreground.. The other thing is, if you look closely, you backest pillar is darker than your closest, now for distance we are looking for less intense/saturated color (keep some cool ""browns"" handy) .finally, the tops of the pillars, since they are very tall, will be further from the viewer and thus less intense than the bottom, especially the front one where some shadows could give some weight and make the object more solid... I know gradation is difficult, but this is asking for it."

painting,33awf2,Spencypoo,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:31:31 2015 UTC,"Kind of not sure what's going on with the hat/box on the head?  Also, I think if you increased the value of some portion of the left side of the painting it would make the dark areas pop more.  As it stands now, it seems like a flat area with a swipe of burnt sienna.  That would be fine, but everything else in the picture is so Renoir soft.  I actually like the really warm palette."
painting,338fo8,Spencypoo,4,Mon Apr 20 14:02:45 2015 UTC,"All the colors can be warm or cold. You can have a cool red or a warm blue. Don't think about the temperatures of colors too much, just pick the ones that look right to your eye. The trees in the back work better for me because you picked a green that worked and didn't fuss with it. The sort of randomness of the foreground tree in the top left doesn't make as much sense. Also try to find a color for the water and sky, neither have to be blue, but pick something that's not white. Make an abstract color decision based on what the painting needs, not on what nature says it should be. Color sets the mood, tells the story, what are you trying to say?"

painting,336mpc,oleooreo,10,Mon Apr 20 01:04:21 2015 UTC,Try painting the exact painting again with one single color (raw umber ) then paint the colors in once the under painting is completely resolved. Watch as the painting starts to have a more lifelike depth. Seriously give it a try and then compare the two. I'm sure you will love the second more.

painting,336mpc,cliffsis,1 point,Fri May 1 18:33:57 2015 UTC,"It's like if I asked you how to paint an alla prima portrait and you told me to start off with an underpainting.  In fact that's exactly what it is.    OP said ""practicing Bob Ross style"".  A brown underpainting is so far from Bob Ross's style.    I don't disagree with you.  A brown layer would add depth and make the colors look more realistic.  That's just outside of the scope of the question."
painting,336mpc,ProductofUnreality,8,Fri May 1 19:28:05 2015 UTC,"This is really awesome for a first time! I love the mountains especially. Keeping in mind that I don't do oils or landscapes generally, Your perspective feels a bit flat. You do have a distinct fore, middle, and background but I feel like your mountain is trying to pop into the same plane as your waterfall and your foreground cliffs look a little unnatural. Reflection in the lake is great as are the foreground trees.  As far as frame's I'd just go to a local craft store and buy one but if you are set on making one, check youtube for tutorials."

painting,336mpc,CrayonDNA,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:21:52 2015 UTC,I wonder how I could I fix the problem of the mountain being on the same plane as water. Do you have any tips that could work? Maybe making the water darker the farther it is away?
painting,336mpc,ecoevodevo,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:20:35 2015 UTC,"You could make the mountain hazier, and maybe dull the lake as it gets farther away but I think the biggest fix would be redoing the foreground. If you aren't working from a real landscape, I suggest finding one that is similar to give you an idea of how to pull off the waterfall more effectively. And as /u/cliffsis suggested, repainting with an underpainting should also help immensely.  Repainting the same thing several times generally gives you a much better results and understanding of your medium."
painting,336mpc,AN1Guitarman,4,Tue Apr 21 01:47:28 2015 UTC,"Cute! So the fan brush that Bob Ross uses for happy little trees isn't actually meant for straight painting - it's meant for blending glazes. One of the strong points of oils is their ability to glaze/scumble, which means to apply a reaaaaaallly thin layer of pigment with a lot of medium in it (I hear you use linseed oil, try using liquin or similar, they're newer, safer, have faster drying times, it's great), and scumbling is scratching on a really opaque layer, also really thinly.   This is how photorealists and classical artists paint.   But overall good job! As you do more of these you'll get more a feel for the medium, it can be surprisingly sculptural and much more intimate than acrylic IMO."
painting,336mpc,AN1Guitarman,3,Mon Apr 20 06:05:40 2015 UTC,Also how do you all frame your canvas? I saw a little tutorial on how to frame them but maybe there are easier ways. Thanks.
painting,336mpc,ProductofUnreality,3,Mon Apr 20 01:30:38 2015 UTC,How do you get the liquid white just right? And how do you get the paints thick enough? I keep struggling with this and I can't seem to find a solution.
painting,336mpc,AN1Guitarman,2,Mon Apr 20 04:37:56 2015 UTC,"I make the liquid white with half titanium white and half linseed oil. Mix it together. It works just the same.  They sell linseed oil at any craft store.   What do you mean thick paints? You mostly want thin paints especially for the colorful parts on the trees. ""A thin paint sticks to a thick one"". All my oil paints are pretty thick as is."

painting,336mpc,AN1Guitarman,1 point,Sat May 2 07:26:37 2015 UTC,"The paint might be your problem.  Those canvases should be good enough.    Companies save money on oil paint by putting more oil than pigment into the tube.  Sometimes they don'e mix them together well.  It leads to a strange consistency that is not very good for paining, in my opinion.  Almost like butter as it's melting in a hot pan.    I'd recommend getting higher quality paints.  They might cost more up front, but you will get more and better use out of them, so it's not really a huge deal.  I use Windsor and Newton paints and I have no complaints.  You shouldn't have to do anything to your paints before you use them.    They say a poor carpenter blames his tools, but you don't see any good ones making cabinets out of cardboard with a butter knife and thumbtacks.    Hope this helps!"
painting,336mpc,designerbay,1 point,Sat May 2 18:48:12 2015 UTC,"That is exactly what I am using, but what you mentioned about poor mixing seems to follow, the yellow especially has a very uneven oily consistency."
painting,336mpc,turkturkelton,1 point,Sat May 2 19:57:31 2015 UTC,"Really??  What yellow is it?  I've never had that problem with their paints, except maybe with the water mixable ones.    Maybe squeeze a bit more out of the tube?  Sometimes there's a buildup of oil in the front.    I've used paint like that before and it's a pain.  If all of your colors are like that I'd really recommend upgrading to the next level of quality."

You can go for some other colours but there are a lot to choose from, I would suggest getting a set of acrylic colours. Personally I use Reeves acrylic paints, which are student quality paints. These aren't the ""best quality"", but it really depends on your pricepoint and what she needs. Those quality paints should be fine for someone starting painting again.  As for brushes Im not sure if it matters what type, but you will want a range of sizes. She will want a big one for painting backgrounds down to a small one for details. You could get a set for these as well."

Many painters, myself included paint in a loose style where such drips are a part of the picture and add to the feeling. But in a painting like this with a tighter style, the drips look like a bad mistake. Otherwise I do like this work, and it has great strength and a nice restrained palette for such a strong vibrant image."
painting,32nk7n,fiercelyfriendly,2,Wed Apr 15 14:36:21 2015 UTC,"The drips were there from the initial layers which I always go from very loose to tight, and just build up from rough lines, but what it comes down to is that I just really liked the drips and didn't feel like covering them up. I felt that it went with some of the splatters that I threw on the canvas at several points with the intention of making the piece feel ""wet"" but I do appreciate the critique and I guess that its just tiny little aesthetic decisions like that that are very impactful in a negative or positive way."

painting,32l4qd,TheWizardofGonz,3,Tue Apr 14 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"Do you plan to have the piece back-lit when hanging? If so, there are imitation stained glass paints that work really well. The best I found was a brand called piñata.  Mixing colors with the white medium reduces transparency, though.  If it's not going to be back-lit, acrylic is your best bet.  It's completely opaque when backlit, though.  That is, unless you have access to a kiln and want to work with real stained glass materials. Those are pretty sweet, but require time and practice.  Invest in a vitrene if you plan to work with transparency.    If you paint with acrylics, be careful not to get water or glass cleaner on or near the paint once dried, because it will cause bubbles under the paint.  The best tool for scraping paint from the surface of the glass is an exacto knife (for small scratches) or a razor blade (for large).  Good luck! Pm me with any questions.  I've spent years developing my technique, and also worked in a stained glass studio for a few years."
painting,32l4qd,mattspald,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:02:25 2015 UTC,"Ooo I have been doing this, too.  What I did was use spray paint on one side to create a swirl of colors fading in and out then flip it and paint your subject on the other side.  It creates an awesome separation of foreground and background that I thought was cool.  Anyway,  that's just what I did.  Dive right in and enjoy the discovery."

painting,32dtzs,PwcAvalon,15,Sun Apr 12 23:41:42 2015 UTC,"not so bad! You're starting to model things pretty okay. Do you know how to draw a face? Your bone structure has quite a bit of weight to it for a novice painter, but your nose just lacks all kinds of volume. Definitely learn the process to figures: mix a peachy kind of skin color with red, orange, and white, and add a little bit of blue to bring down the saturation. Separate that pile into ""highlights,"" adding white and making it warmer, and ""shadows,"" adding some more blue to make it cooler. (example here, see how the highlights are warm and pink and the shadows are blue and purple?)  When it comes to the actual painting part, mix a lot of medium into an earth tone and gesture in an underpainting, much like you would draw the figure. Don't make it super wet or thick, you're about to paint over it. Paint in the highlights, squinting to get the big shapes, and then paint in the shadows. From there fill in the midtones. Go back to the highlights, working the edges and interacting with the boundaries of light and shadow, and rotate around until you're satisfied with the painting.   Your paintings aren't sad or shitty, they're just amateur :)   It also looks like your paint is a little dry and bleh, which is partly because canvas board sucks but might also be because you're not using enough medium. Most paint worth painting with is designed to be mixed with medium before application, unless you're scumbling."

painting,32dtzs,afx37x,4,Mon Apr 13 02:02:22 2015 UTC,"You're doing great!  I find mine start like this, but just keep adding detail and identify what looks wrong or off.  If you want to fix any features,  paint gives you the freedom to do that! You have a good base/starting point. Just try focusing on one area until you get it the way you want it to look.  If you're basing this off of an image, try looking at different colours and shades as simple shapes (each colour as it's own unique squiggly blob) . If you've looked at it the painting too long try flipping it upside down or looking at it in the mirror. You'll be quicker at identifying anything that stands out in the wrong way. And taking breaks is the best thing you can do when you're having trouble.  A fresh mind and attitude is the best for creativity!"

painting,32dtzs,srs5222,3,Mon Apr 13 00:32:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's not bad. You have the basic components, it just looks like it needs worked more. My couple constructive criticism would be focus on the eyes. They seem a little displaced on the head, may be because of the absenese of an eyelid and how much of the iris we see. Also, think about using nonlocal colors.  For example, using more blue tints within the shadows of the face. It looks like you stuck to this is flesh so I painted it flesh. But we actually have a lot of undertones, veins, flushed, ect. that bring in other colors. So as weird as it sounds, using colors that you don't think of naturally in the face will help it look more realistic. Just blend it in well."

painting,32c46h,Daannii,5,Sun Apr 12 17:43:52 2015 UTC,"I think cheap paints like the folk art brand are fine to play around with, but once you are more serious about making something that will last, you are probably going to have to invest in a little bit higher quality.  The upside is that the higher quality paints are less runny, so cover more area.     I am a big fan of the liquitex paints.  They are not that pricey and they sell sets you can buy online and at some stores.  Sometimes hobby lobby has their paints on sale, and usually you can get a 40% off coupon on their website.  so if you are wanting to buy a set, use that coupon and you can save a bit of money."
painting,32c46h,bubbasquibs,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:23:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with liquitex paints. They are not super expensive and a lot of places sell them. I buy my from joanns with 50% off coupons. They cover well and you can mix them easily and they're workable with things like gels and modeling paste. I do use a lot of extender for blending but from the style you're looking at, it looks like you won't need mooch of that so don't worry about it."
painting,32c46h,Daannii,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:59:33 2015 UTC,"well it seems like part of your issue is the opacity.  And that is one of the reasons i am not a big fan of acrylics.  It is hard to find a strong pigmented acrylic paint.     The best way I found to fix that is to look into acrylic inks. You will need to check the label to see if it is opaque, but you can generally find more that are stronger pigments. The liquitex brand is pretty good and a bit less expensive than some of the others.    Most airbrush inks are the same thing.  Check the label to see if it is acrylic water based.  You can mix these with acrylic paints to make them more opaque or use directly.  You may also want to use a medium that will keep it wet a bit longer so you can blend.  The inks dry even faster than regular acrylic paint- and that stuff dries pretty fast.   If you are wanting to buy a lot of colors, I would suggest buying a set online.  Buying them individually at a store is very pricey.  They run from $4 a piece to $12 a piece.  If you are needing a few colors, that starts to add up fast. Airbrush ink sets are going to be the least expensive route.   I use the inks a lot. I really like them.  Especially for yellows and oranges which are really hard to find opaque acrylic paints for."
painting,32c46h,smfinator,1 point,Sun Apr 12 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"Cheap paints tend to have low pigment density, which means that it ends up taking a ton of layers to get any sort of reasonable coverage. I would recommend Basic acrylics for the next step up. If you like those, then transition into Liquitex. It'll take some getting used to the increased thickness, but you can always thin it out a little if it's hard for you to work with."

painting,31wz26,RowanThePenguin,2,Wed Apr 8 20:42:06 2015 UTC,"You could blend the edges of the far flowers into the blue of the sky, that would make it appear less in focus?

I think some people mix a tiny little bit of pale green in with pink as they cancel each other out and tone down the intensity slightly, someone please correct me if I'm wrong."
painting,31yrsn,StumpNuts,3,Thu Apr 9 05:09:43 2015 UTC,"Best possible advice I can give without knowing anymore... underpaint your canvas.  What I mean by that is cover the whole canvas in one color (preferably a medium value (i.e. not too dark or light) brownish color (more orangy if you want the painting to look warmer; more blue if you want it to look cooler).  This will make sure the ""teeth"" i.e. the bumps in the canvas aren't too noticeable, it will ensure you don't have white patches, and it will generally just unify the whole thing."
painting,31yrsn,Spencypoo,3,Thu Apr 9 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend using acrylic paints for a begginner, they dry a lot faster than oils, with acrylics a layer can be dry enough to work over in under half an hour.    Get a couple of different sized brushes, and some painting medium. Liquid painting medium will thin the paint and make it easier to do fine details without getting big clumpy bits of paint everywhere.  Youtube is your friend! There is a treasure trove of tutorials on there on blending, colour theory, etc. Plan your painting before you go at the canvas, you can use a canvas pad from your local art store to practice your blending, test your colours and do a small scale plan of your finished piece. Like /u/spencypoo said, underpaint your canvas, it makes the world of difference.  Use as big a brush as you can for the area, if you try and paint sky with a tiny brush, your acrylics will dry before you can get a nice smooth blend of colours. If you find your paints going on too thick and doesnt go very far, you can mix in a little of the afformentioned liquifying/glazing medium to make it stretch futher... just a little now, too much and your paint will go see through or not dry! Sky isn't one flat colour, use pthalo blue with a little white at the top, and phthalo blue with more white near the horizon, this makes the sky look less flat.   I hope this helps and isn't too much for a begginer to take in at once. The most important thing is that you have fun! It may sound corny, but all the great artists were shit once, but they kept painting because they loved it! Thats the trick. Every painting you do you will get better. I hope you start on a long and rewarding road of creative fulfilment."
