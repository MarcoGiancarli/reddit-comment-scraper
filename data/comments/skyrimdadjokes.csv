skyrimdadjokes,37vf3m,the_man_Sam,1 point,Sun May 31 15:25:56 2015 UTC,Ahhh I see the other comment now. When I realized I should try using the s sounding c it made a lot more sense. It never occurred to me initially to do that.

skyrimdadjokes,37q7xz,talanton,1 point,Sat May 30 06:46:35 2015 UTC,That's a clever way to call Black Sabbath.
skyrimdadjokes,37q7xz,TotesMessenger,1 point,Sat May 30 06:47:32 2015 UTC,"I was torn, it would either be Black Loredas or Black Sundas, but since the observation of the Sabbath originally comes from Judaism, I went with Loredas.  I also looked through the calendar for a holiday that matches the word, but struck out.  So, Black Loredas it is."
