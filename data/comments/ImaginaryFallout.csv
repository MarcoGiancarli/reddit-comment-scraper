ImaginaryFallout,39poiu,Ordinary_Fella,8,Sat Jun 13 15:59:46 2015 UTC,Maybe it's not his child but one that was subjected to the mutations itself? Not sure if it's even possible for a kid to go through that. Not likely.

ImaginaryFallout,39poiu,Ordinary_Fella,3,Sun Jun 14 07:33:01 2015 UTC,"Wasn't there a remnant faction which worked to give super mutants fertility? Or was that a ghoul society? I remember in Fallout Tactics they were doing some sort of experiment regarding the proliferation of non-FEV mutants. But you're right, I thought it was a Warcraft Orc for a moment, but I think it kind of goes into the underlying point of Tactics, and is also kind of glossed over when wastelanders talk about the callous actions of some of the BoS (specifically when underworld ghouls talk about how they don't like the BoS because they take pot-shots at them). but in tactics, the BoS are basically the Teutonic Knights, a feudal fascist state comprising of vassal towns and military fortresses, where anyone who shows mutation or resistance will either be killed or ""pressed into service."""

A person. The water bottle sitting next to you. Just draw one thing new every day and you'll see that your observation skills are going to improve, which'll help with your art.

ImaginaryFallout,2lbces,Reddit_Executive,1 point,Thu Nov 6 17:30:56 2014 UTC,"You got it. Before I start, I don't know the exact specs of your assignment, so if I start harping on something that was done to fulfill a requirement, let me know. Also, I'm a graphic designer, so I'm not trying to be harsh, just critiquing it as I would anyone else's work. And finally, congrats to your for putting your work out there. It's not an easy thing to do, and good for you for looking to better your work.  Ok, so let's look at the movement itself. Art Nouveau began in Paris around the late 1800's and maintained popularity thru the early 1900's. The movement was known for its complex compositions, the ornate and flowing lines, and the overall decadence. The designs were very organic, featuring vine-like lines, floral themes, and chaotic, but organized repition.  Mucha, Cheret, and Tolouse-Latrec are easily the most copied artists from this period as far as graphics go. And we all know how popular the glass work by Louis Comfort Tiffany was and still is. And of course, Antony Gaudi gave us some very interesting buildings in Spain.  Now, let's look at your work. I'm assuming you were shooting for a Much feel, so we'll compare to his work. The overall composition if good. Centrally located figure, ornamentation around the edges, and a circular item with a repetitive pattern around the figure's head. Here's where I get conflicted with this piece. The lack of framing, gradient, and less than perfect figure almost makes me think you were after a Toulouse-Latrec feel. However the ornamentation suggest a Mucha feel. Which you were after, I'm not entirely sure.  Let's move on to the technique. This is where you stumble. Let's start with the circular item which I'm assuming to be the vault door. When I open the image in a new window and view it at size, it's blurry. That shouldn't even be an issue. Second with the vault door is it's straight lines. This movement is a lot of curves. Straight lines have their place in Art Nouveau, don't get me wrong; but those straight lines are often long and do some sort of framing with the compositions.   The ornamentation lines are just wrong. They should feel natural and organic. These look like something a bro has tattooed on his arm on some drunken spring break bender. The lines should resemble vines or cloth. If you have trouble visualizing it, imagine a length of cloth dropped into a pool, some dye in water, or even smoke floating in the air. I don't understand your use of texture in the green lines. It doesn't add anything to the ornamentation, and it somewhat distracting. It also looks like it was done freehand with little editing afterwards. The lines end with rounded or faux-brush edges and give it an MS-paint look over Art Nouveau. I suggest having them curl and/or taper at the ends. Again, redesign the lines so they are less of a pattern, and more of a movement through the composition.   The person isn't bad per-say. The human form is a bitch to master, and I'm not gonna blast you for it being off. However, the hair and right side of his head looks like a Deathclaw had a swipe, or he's a ghoul. You could probably erase the messed up bit and have a good head of hair on your wanderer. The lines on the gear and body should be sharp. The wavy lines, again, feel like MS paint. As with the green lines, I don't agree with the texture used in the body and head.   Finally, color. If there is a color scheme here, I can't figure it out. I know there's the vault suit. And blue and yellow are a given. You can easily go with shades of blue and yellow, but browns and some, emphasis on some, purples would even be nice. Find a palette that would work for this particular composition. I suggest using Adboe's Kuler."
ImaginaryFallout,2lbces,CrystalLord,1 point,Thu Nov 6 20:13:57 2014 UTC,"The main reason for the lines was simply it was 1 in the morning and I thought it was due the next morning aha, thankfully it wasn't but I have been working on it since trying to improve it, going by my tutors advise and now yours. I'm currently studying games design at university so we're not going to be studying art movements for long so my grasp on them isn't brilliant. Anyway I'm babbling, here is my latest attempt but it is no where near done, any advise on how to finish up? http://gyazo.com/dec1eab9cba5603d1c580b1bc9725cb8"
