FanTheories,3e1x2w,aibaron,12,Tue Jul 21 15:16:07 2015 UTC,"its not always about that, sure it happens quite frequently. But some fanfictions are actually ""fix-its"". Like.. Maybe a deeper backstory on the Thestrals from harry potter. Or maybe a ""event horizon 2"", Or any sort of filler content that could, in the writers eyes (and those who like the fanfiction) , make the original better.  Its also a way of writing, when a person who's new to writing wants to already write in an established universe. Say you want to start getting into Sci-fi novels. But you're having a hard time with the 'universe'. So you choose an established universe to take information from. Maybe Aliens, maybe blade runner or the Matrix. You and the reader know the terms from those movies (facehugger ect) so you dont have to develop a new world for your characters to live in.  Though, personally, i think one should always try and create ones own, it helps driving your writing skills forward. :)"

Obviously pulling off an entirely original work is a bigger accomplishment, and if you want to call yourself a 'professional writer' you'll need to be able to do that, but if you're just a hobbist writer there's no shame in writing good fanfiction."

Surely he would make use of it to protect the POTUS, of all people? Then I reasoned to myself that it was meant to be a trap. Entice the antagonistic mutants into coming, so that his Sentinels would get a chance to show what they can do. Trask kept one of the detectors on his person though, for his own safety.  Trask was more cunning than he was getting credit for. Definitely that, not a hole in the script. Lol."

FanTheories,3e1x2w,KicksButtson,23,Tue Jul 21 10:04:11 2015 UTC,"I honestly think there are different types of fan theories which appear on this subreddit, and I'd like the subreddit to adopt a form of identification for post titles so we knew what kind of theory it was.  For instance, there's the type where OP tries to explain a character's backstory based on evidence provided in the film. It's ultimately irrelevant to the story but it helps cast the character in a new light, or make him more interesting.  Then there is the type where OP is trying to describe what happened in the ending, usually involving some kind of twist or ambiguousness. It is relevant to the film's story and can change the way everyone views the film from then on.  There are the ones where OP is just explaining his own personal interpretation of the film's meaning and subtext. This one is the most annoying to me because often there is no real evidence to prove this was the director's intention behind the film's subtext, and OP is just projecting his own beliefs and insecurities onto the film, yet OP almost never admits this and in a moment of narcissism assumes he and the director somehow mind melded.  We need some kind of categorization method so we know what kind of theory we are about to read. Cause I absolutely hate seeing a post title which seems like it's going to analyze the evidence in the film to decipher the mystery behind the events, yet then OP just spends ten paragraphs ranting about his own vague personal beliefs."
FanTheories,3e1x2w,LazyPalpatine,6,Tue Jul 21 10:32:26 2015 UTC,"Also, the main character of every film you've ever watched is dead or dying, and the film is Heaven/Hell/Purgatory/their mind rationalizing their death.  Every single one. Ever. Yes, even that one."

FanTheories,3e1x2w,EdTheThird,10,Tue Jul 21 15:45:17 2015 UTC,"I think this was one of the strengths of the movie. There are already three films establishing Max's character. It gave the ""supporting"" characters room to breathe and develop."
FanTheories,3e1x2w,Asiriya,9,Tue Jul 21 18:43:12 2015 UTC,"I really don't know what growth they want from the character. He's reluctantly self-sacrificing (so not helping/ helping are both expected), he's crazy (you can't recover from that), he's a badass (you want him to get crippled?!), he travels alone (guess what drove him crazy).  Now, they could make him a bad guy. Like properly. Have him do something really horrible. But that would spoil the character I think. You could have him settle down? But then where's the carspoitation (admittedly I think the next film will be more stationary a la Thunderdome). You could have him try to cope with his baggage (but that will probably result in hallucinations, a terrible trope) - I would like to see Max dealing with a Wasteland psychologist though.  Or, you could keep doing what he has been doing for the last three films, dropping in on other colourful characters and getting dragged into their shit (by the way guys, just as Fury Road was about Furiosa, RW was Feral's story and Thunderdome the legend passed down by the Sydney kids; Max is just the device used to expose them)."
FanTheories,3e1x2w,vampyrita,2,Tue Jul 21 18:54:17 2015 UTC,"I think this is definitely a good theory, but only sometimes. Sometimes the fans just want to explore the universe further than what would be reasonable for the author/creator to show in the film/book/series. Case in point: harry potter. Fanfics exist depicting what happens to the main characters' children, the professors' personal lives, and the lives of the marauders when they were in school. The information the fans want isn't relevant to harry's story, but the fans want it anyway. So they invented the information themselves. It's a way to answer questions left unanswered, but not necessarily due to bad storytelling. Maybe the story didn't need to be told."
FanTheories,3e1x2w,Afalstein,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:29 2015 UTC,"While some theories are perhaps this, I wouldn't apply them to all, for the simple reason there's nothing new about fan theories.  There have been fan theories about the writings of Shakespeare, George Eliot, and Ernest Hemingway.  Some people say Ophelia was never mad, others that Gwendolen killed her father, lots of others that character X is actually having sex with character Y throughout the whole story.  The other thing is that bad movies DON'T attract lots of theories.  Good movies do.  ""Mad Max"" was beloved by critics and audiences alike, as one of the best movies of the year.  ""Jurassic World"" was one of the most successful.  Meanwhile, how many fan theories have been raised about ""Project Almanac,"" ""The Gallows"" or ""San Adreas?""  ""Inside Out"" and various awesome Pixar movies pop up here once a week not because of how terrible, but how GREAT they are.    I'm not even sure there is a ""surge"" in fan theories, but if there is, I'd say it has more to do with the growth of leisure time and also the growth of shows that welcome it (LOST, Star Wars, etc.)  Complex worlds or plots offer lots of potential for development and speculation.  No one makes up fan theories about Taken, because it has a straightforward world and a straightforward plot.  Prometheus, while not the best movie, is another movie with a complex world that leaves a lot of its work behind the scenes, thus encouraging fan theories.  When it comes down to it, fan theories are another sort of storytelling, similar to fanfiction, where we embellish works that we love, not works we hate.  We devote time and thought to the fandoms we adore (say, Star Trek) and come up with details that the authors couldn't possibly include because of how pointless or distracting it would be.  Going into Max's backstory in Fury Road would have detracted from the pure adrenaline of the experience.  Describing the reasoning why Gandalf didn't have the eagles carry the hobbits to Mordor would be boring.  But because of fan theories, we can create them on our own time."
FanTheories,3e1x2w,Afalstein,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:51 2015 UTC,"agreed -- i don't think it's a question of good movies and bad movies... a certain type of movie seems to attract the most rabid fan-theorising: usually big genre movies that are riddled with the kind of inconsistencies and flaws that studio development entails (re-drafts that create plot holes, deleted subplots still vaguely alluded to in intact scenes). Prometheus is a great example of this. It's not San Andreas-bad. It's ambitious and heavily flawed (for which we can blame studio meddling, surely)."

I'm sure you could come up with all kinds of reasons why midichlorians don't contradict the portrayal of the Force in the original series, but really I think the most likely answer is that Lucas didn't want to ""waste"" time on giving a cool explanation of the Force when that time could just be filled with another lightsabre duel.  Having said that, it's often more fun if you just play along. If the concept was interesting enough that it attracted so many fans that want to fix it, it must have something going for it."

That is, a character who's noted in the movie to be a weird fringe loony, his apprentice, and somebody who was trying to manipulate his apprentice into switching sides.

FanTheories,3e1x2w,NameIdeas,4,Tue Jul 21 19:49:07 2015 UTC,"I like this theory about fan theories.  Jurassic World was okay as a film.  It seemed fueled solely by nostalgia while I was watching it and I immediately forgot about every single one of the characters.  There was no Dr. Grant, Ian Malcolm, or other big, memorable characters from the first film.  Chris Pratt's character (I can't even remember his name now) was, as you said, a series of action hero cliches.  With Mad Max, I don't know how much this applies.  Max himself, in that movie, is not ultimately the main character.  Furiosa and the world the story occurs in are the main characters, with Mad Max there to fuel the story, I believe.  The Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome as similar to this.  Max has a much bigger part to play in The Road Warrior, but the story is really about the world in which he lives.     I wonder if the recent surge in fan theories is a response to the generally shitty state of screenwriting in movies nowadays? Like we're all looking for a nugget of gold in a huge pile of faeces...

Poor writing out the wazoo. Fan theories are like a denial of this because of how much we loved JP and how much we want to experience that again.

Let's use your Jurassic World example. People were theorizing about Pratt's character long before the movie was ever released. Similar to what's happening with all the Joker theories we've been seeing here. When people don't even know the story, they can't be responding to bad storytelling.  I'd also like to add that good storytelling omits details from time to time, and doesn't spell everything out for the audience. They leave certain things up to the imagination.

Yes and No.  Yes because of what you've pointed out. There are lots of cases where writing is poor and not-well-thought-out. In other cases (usually movies/video games) story takes a back seat to action, CGI showboating, and drama, because of this, plot holes ensue.  but...  No because:  Sometimes the writer isn't an expert on the small things in the plot. Technology is a big one. Sometimes a magic device is needed to fill in the plot holes, but can end up creating holes of its own.  Let's look at JK Rowling. I don't think anyone believes her to be a bad writer. The Harry Potter story makes sense as a whole, but when you start examining details, plot holes show up. ""Why wouldn't X just do Y and save everyone a lot of time?""  As a reader (watcher/player/whatever) and not an author, you have experience consuming content, but not creating that content. When you write, you are building a universe out of nothing. You have to create the rules, you have to make the filler and you have to make it all work together. And then, in a fraction of the time it took you to do this, a reader (who is a second set of eyes) is going to happen along and notice something that is maybe inconsistent. No matter how good you are at writing, and no matter how good your editor is, there will always be plot holes that go unnoticed in the finished work.  Lastly, sometimes the universe is bigger than the story. Writers have limited amounts of time and space with which to construct the storyworld and tell a tale. There are aspects of the universe that aren't talked about...but they do exist in the storyworld! Which means that they must have an explanation or a backstory, even if the author hasn't gone into detail about it. So, some minor character doesn't have a backstory because the author didn't thin they were significant enough to get one, but people take an interest in the character. Maybe their lack of backstory is mysterious and compelling, so they seek to explain it."

(Oddly I can't remember whether he vaporized at the end of the books.)  Any body that would be left after his first death would have decayed and disintegrated by the time he returns so they couldn't use that body anyway. Bodies don't take long to decompose (unless they are pumped full of preservatives).  We seem to be left with 2 facts to deal with. Certainty by many that Voldemort is dead and certainty by (some) death eaters that he is alive.  I think the best explanation is that there was a body. The reason the Death Eaters (his most faithful ones only) still search for him is because he told them he had moved beyond death. He was thier only hope and so they had no option but to keep faith.  If there was no body, then possible explanations would be the strength of the rebounding curse or the instability of Tom Riddle's body. Voldemort had experimented with dark magics, enough to alter his appearance to a semi insubstantial form (book 6); maybe his body was only being held together by similar magics used to protect the horcruxes from destruction."

It is my belief that the more complex the spell is, the more powerful the backlash and thus more drastic the effect of it.   I believe that whatever Lilly Potter did to save Harry the night the Killing Curse rebounded didn't just actively protect him, but also caused Voldemort's wand to malfunction somehow. When casting the Killing Curse, Tom Riddle's wand malfunctioned drastically, causing a large amount of magical backlash to occur. Judging by the part of the roof that was blown outward, I'd have to assume the backlash was explosive. This would also explain where Harry's scar came from - it's not a curse scar directly, but one caused by shrapnel and affected by dark magic (not to mention the horcrux).   I therefore posit that Voldemort's attempted Avada Kedavra at worst actually tore his body apart, using it as fuel for a magical explosion or at best instead made a uncontrolled explosion with Voldemort near the epicentre.  In either scenario, I'd say that his body wasn't in a reusable or fixable state even if any Death Eaters did manage to retrieve it."
FanTheories,3e2fo4,Troop-the-Loop,18,Tue Jul 21 19:46:14 2015 UTC,"He died. When Voldemort failed to kill Harry, he died. The only reason a part of him was able to remain, were the horcruxes. That was his way of returning from death.   Which is why he latched on to the professor in the first book, tried to use a memory of himself in the second, and eventually had to get Wormtail to make him a brand new body.   Voldemort died. He just escaped complete death through use of the horcruxes, as a part of his ""soul"" or ""being"" was torn and imbued in each one."
FanTheories,3e2fo4,Akaelda,5,Tue Jul 21 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"To clarify, I am referring to his physical body"
FanTheories,3e2fo4,Troop-the-Loop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:12:47 2015 UTC,"It was vaporized when he tried to kill Harry. The curse rebounded and by all accounts we're given in the book his body disintegrated. Book 4 alludes to even the Ministry not knowing what happened to Voldemort's body.   The four of you stand accused of capturing an Auror - Frank Longbottom - and subjecting him to the Cruciatus Curse, believing him to have knowledge of the present whereabouts of your exiled master, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named   Since Rowling never elaborated on what happened to his body, we can only conclude that either the body was destroyed at the moment the curse rebounded or that it was disposed of by a Death Eater afterwards, but before Snape entered the home to find the body of James and Lily and Harry in his crib."
FanTheories,3e2fo4,Akaelda,10,Tue Jul 21 14:21:10 2015 UTC,Why did they ever believe that he was killed if he just disappeared?
FanTheories,3e2fo4,Troop-the-Loop,6,Tue Jul 21 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair, a lot of wizards still assumed he was out there, waiting and accumulating strength."
FanTheories,3e2fo4,Liquid_Fire_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:32:03 2015 UTC,"Some believed he was killed, especially immediately after the incident. Others believed that he had gone into exile (no body discovered). They believed he destroyed himself, for good reason, because they understood that his killing curse rebounded on himself by some powerful, ancient magics that Harry possessed or was protected by.   It wasn't unheard of for wizards or witches to vanish without a trace after being killed by a rebounding curse. It'd be similar to the ending scene of Dark Knight Rises where Batman flies his Bat out into the sea and the bomb explodes. Everyone thinks he's dead because who could survive that? No one really knew about the Horcruxes or that Voldemort had utilized them as is evident by Dumbledore trying so hard to get the unaltered memory of Professor Slughorn to uncover what dark magics Voldemort used to cheat death.  No body, nasty rebounded curse, presumed dead."
FanTheories,3e2fo4,Troop-the-Loop,-8,Tue Jul 21 14:45:34 2015 UTC,"Since you mentioned TDKR, there is this opening scene where there is a ""wreckage brother"" to serve as a decoy specifically to have a body to prove the wreckage and avoid suspicion of foul play. With no CCTV footage I would nor believe for a second that Voldy just vanished"
FanTheories,3e2fo4,GodsGiftToAdrenaline,6,Tue Jul 21 15:52:14 2015 UTC,"Me too. His physical body died. Voldemort died that night, but the horcruxes stopped it from being a total death. His body died, but a part of his ""soul"" or ""being"" was still out there, powered by the horcruxes. Which is how he was able to slowly regain power and influence until a new body could be made.   Short answer: Voldemort's body died."
FanTheories,3e2fo4,mangleopolis,-7,Tue Jul 21 14:18:02 2015 UTC,But what happened to the physical body? Did it just vanish or was he buried?
FanTheories,3e2fo4,Troop-the-Loop,6,Tue Jul 21 14:20:55 2015 UTC,I imagine the release of magic when Harry survived was strong enough to obliterate his body. I honestly couldn't tell you if he was buried or if his body exploded or what. I can only say that his body died.
FanTheories,3e2fo4,baconhead,4,Tue Jul 21 14:22:02 2015 UTC,I think he gets that. I think OP is just wondering I guess where the body went. Was it buried? Was there a funeral?

The only reason it wasn't a complete death was because of the horcruxes. Thy helped keep a piece of his ""soul"" or ""being"" alive until he could have a new body made."
FanTheories,3e2fo4,Troop-the-Loop,-6,Tue Jul 21 14:19:10 2015 UTC,"No but where is his body?

FanTheories,3e2fo4,kamahaoma,7,Tue Jul 21 15:11:44 2015 UTC,"Eh. My original answer, that Voldemort's body died, is still an answer to the question.

Voldemort's body died."

Still a pretty cool idea though, solong as all Remy saw on the TV was reruns? XD"

Like wouldn't them being alive simultaneously completely defeat your 'turned into a rat' theory? Remy had Gusteau in his head because he idolized Gusteau, practically brainwashed himself sneaking in to watching all of those late night shows. In fact, I think I remember reading something about adrenaline release (from sneaking into the house) and the stress response being necessary for brainwashing.  Also, and I realize this probably isn't your theory, but given the technological level in Brave it would make sense that that story takes place a couple hundred years ago, while Monster's Inc is roughly present day. How does the witch from Brave live for 200 years and then become a child? You can say magic, but a MUCH simpler explanation is that they're not the same person at all."

I always saw Mr. Wolf as a ""fixer"" I suppose. When shit hit the fan you need the best, and Mr. Wolf was the best at fixing problems. He was a hired gun. He didn't seem like the guy to only work for one person although Marcellus probably was one of the few people who could afford him and probably had some problems that he needed fixed."
FanTheories,3e2otu,KHanson25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"I see your point. The dialogue in RD makes it seem more as The Wolf relies are Marcellus to move his diamonds, which may mean that he has a deal worked out with Marcellus as a clean up guy in exchange for Marcellus helping his diamond business. What I meant by that is he is missing his partner* in the underground diamond business. That's why he is turning to Joe for this heist."

FanTheories,3e3ekt,MetalGearLink,10,Tue Jul 21 17:30:29 2015 UTC,"Not my original idea but: Padme didn't die because she ""lost the will to live"", Palpatine used the Dark Side to drain her life force and put it into Anakin to ensure that he lived on as Darth Vader. We already know that Palpatine can manipulate life through the Force due to the heavy implications that he was responsible for Anakin's fatherless conception. Meanwhile, note the line ""medically she's fine but for reasons we can't explain we're losing her."" Padme's medical team was composed entirely of droids who don't interact with nor really understand the Force outside of whatever they might have been programmed to understand, but they still don't really feel it. So you would expect that they'd have no ability to explain death by Force drain. Finally, the juxtaposition between Padme giving birth and the birth of Darth Vader is significant and indicates a connection between the two events."

I believe he served on Sulu's ship eventually but he must have been a child during the events of ST09, possibly not even born) but most human characters shouldn't be not born simply because pre existing characters are an easy template to work with than new characters-like Carol Marcus in ID did not have to be Carol Marcus, could have been someone altogether different... but it was Carol Marcus. Who knows, maybe back before having David and working on Genesis she was a weapons developer for Starfleet in the prime timeline.   So I think there will be a Picard, a Worf, a Data, a Sisko, a Kira and a Dax (though not necessarily Jadzia), a Janeway. Nero didn't affect certain other places as much as he did the Federation-presumably, if the next movie takes the series back to bright and shiny future land (out of darkness), then Cardassia will still occupy Bajor for nearly a century (in fact, isn't TOS era when they should start that?) before the Federation has some skirmishes with them, the Ferengi are out there doing business across the stars; the only powers that are changed I would think are the Federation and the Romulans and possibly the Klingons since Nero was supposedly hiding out in Klingon space for 20-odd years."

Cardassians occupying Bajor? Well, we can stop that if Bajor becomes our ally, because we're capable of blowing the ever-loving piss out of them. This more militarised Starfleet then has Deep Space Nine as a forward position and a potential ally in the Bajorans for their more violent nature. The 'Sisko' on board that station may not give two shits about time travelling Klingons."
FanTheories,3e2ixl,bubonis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:56 2015 UTC,"As far as the Cardassian War goes, it'll probably be more decisive and quick than a few border raids and skirmishes alluded to in the prime timeline. That being said, Starfleet isn't the galactic police, it's a humanitarian and peacekeeping armada. The Cardassians will occupy Bajor until they test the strength of the Federation, which will eventually lead to their withdrawal from the newly defined borders, give birth to the Maquis, and frees Bajor.   The new Bajor will need Federation humanitarian help but in the scheme of things it really wasn't that important until the Wormhole opened up. That's why a burned out veteran of Wolf 359 was assigned to it, it was a backwater post for someone unlikely to move forward.   The future Sisko, if he exists, will most definitely give a shit about a time travelling Klingon trying to assassinate Captain Kirk, who facilitated the accords that brought lasting peace between the Klingon Empire and Federation."
FanTheories,3e2ixl,bubonis,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:50 2015 UTC,"One big flaw with this theory...  STID ended with the Enterprise and her crew, including Carol Marcus, launching their five year deep space mission. I cannot imagine that STB will simply gloss over that experience; it has to be set somewhere in that five year mission, otherwise we miss a massive chunk of character development. That being the case, it is inconceivable that Carol Marcus would have the time, resources, or even the reasoning to develop the Genesis device while aboard Enterprise during this mission. In classic canon, Carol and David had an entire staff and resources dedicated to just the Genesis device, not to mention a driving motivation to do it (solving the problems of living space and food for the galaxy), and it still took them at least a year to get to the torpedo stage. Carol won't have any of those resources aboard Enterprise — a ship, remember, which will be effectively an island unto itself, with no Starfleet support for five years — and thus far hasn't demonstrated a single second of concern for solving the problems of living space and food for the galaxy."
FanTheories,3e2ixl,bubonis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I forgot about that.  HOWEVER, the movie could very well ignore the five year experience! It's an easy way to jump forward in time and give the crew a tighter feeling of history and friendship than the last one did.   The very nature of the changed universe makes speculation a fools errand, especially given such little information so far. These were just two minor out of ballpark thoughts from my latest Trek binge."
FanTheories,3e2ixl,bubonis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it could, but I really don't think Abrams would do that. Consider:  There's a three year in-movie gap (2255 to 2258) in the first Abrams Star Trek movie, between when Kirk enters Starfleet Academy and when he cheats on the Kobayashi Maru. We saw no adjustment to Kirk's character; he went in brash and cocky and arrogant, and came out brash and cocky and arrogant (but now with mad Starfleet skills). We saw him make friends with McCoy and we saw him maintain that friendship. We saw him as a womanizer before the bar fight and while he was in Starfleet Academy. In short, the only thing that we missed is Kirk's specific experiences within the Academy — which we know have done nothing to change his character, and if you're not changing someone's character then why bother showing it on film? We do see the introduction to all the other major players — Spock, Uhura, Sulu, etc — but, with the exception of Uhura, none of them have any previous history with Kirk.  There's a one year gap between the previous movie and STID (2258 to 2259), and we again see no meaningful character development in Kirk. We do see the foundation of the Kirk-Spock relationship but it's still on Kirk's terms, demonstrating that he's still the same brash, cocky, and arrogant person we saw several years ago. Throughout the movie's events we do see Kirk reevaluate himself, and at the end of the movie he's still cocky and arrogant, but he's not quite the same person he was when the movie opened. As the movie put it, he now respects the chair.  All of that demonstrates that whenever there's character development and/or exposition, it's done on camera. We-the-audience see it happen. When there's no development, Abrams skips over it. Now put it into context. Abrams' Enterprise holds about a thousand people. You're going to put a thousand people into deep space for five years with absolutely no Starfleet support, with the youngest Captain (and quite probably the youngest median age of the command crew) in Starfleet history, and you think there's not going to be enough character development in there to be worth showing the audience?  Nope. Sorry. Not gonna happen. The odds of Abrams opening up STB with the Enterprise coming back into space dock five years later with half a nacelle hanging off of it, a couple dozen recorded deaths (ST:TOS had 55 fatalities throughout its run), maybe a few new crewmembers, and the entire bridge crew visibly shellshocked, and none of it ever being shown to the audience, is absolutely inconceivable."

FanTheories,3dxge6,Rrekydoc,38,Mon Jul 20 09:51:36 2015 UTC,"In Judeo-Christian mythology, angels do not have free will, but obey God's orders without question or complaint).   Devout Catholic armchair theologian here (but totally untrained!), but this isn't accurate.  Angels have free will, it's just that they're outside of time, so they sort of had one ""instance"" (again, not subject to the laws of time, so that's not the proper word) to use it.   You or I choose every day to go to work or not, what to eat, etc.  Angels made all their choices at once, instantaneously.    The fact that they have free will is HOW Lucifer and the other rebelled in the first place.  Your theory is interesting, and it might be Lucifer's retelling in a way, but it's not accurate.  Heaven isn't emotionless, and indeed Christ summarizes all of the Old Testament as, ""Love God with all your heart, all your mind, and all your soul, and love your neighbour as yourself.""   Love and attachment are forbidden in Equilibrium if I am not mistaken.    Additionally, God commands the Israelites to build the Ark of the Covenant and even tells them how to decorate it - art is forbidden in Equilibrium.    In Mormonism (I'm not Mormon, but bear with me) Satan's plan for mankind was for them not to have free will, which to me seems accurate with Satan's MO.  In Mormonism, it is Christ who argues that men should be free to choose God or not.     Some Christian scholars (Francisco Suarez being the earliest I am aware of) believe that the reason Lucifer rebelled was because the angels were shown the Divine Incarnation.  They saw that a nature lower than their own was to be hypostatically united to the Person of God the Son, and that all the hierarchy of heaven must bow in adoration before the majesty of the Incarnate Word (ie, Jesus).  This sort of lines up with Islam, which teaches that Iblis (""Satan"") refused to kneel before Adam, the first man, when God commanded him to.    Jesus, of course, dies for the sins of humanity, redeeming them and undoing Satan's work.   However, evil is still in the world because God allows man to retain his free will.   Jesus dies for man because, to God, it is worth it.  In the same way, in Equilibrium, Sean Bean's character (who Preston kills for having poetry) says that even though the consequences of feeling emotions are a ""heavy cost"" he doesn't care and says ""I pay it gladly,"" just as Christ freely and gladly paid the heavy cost to redeem man."

History is written by those that win, so of course many of the details would be different and skewed to make the authors the hero.   Sure, but the stories have to have some sort of consistency to know we're talking about the same thing.   Otherwise anything can be a retelling of anything, and that just gets us to /r/shittyfantheories territory.  Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy works as a pro-Lucifer retelling of the Rebellion because it lines up in some places with traditional Christianity, but deviates in others.  OPs theory doesn't really do either of those. The Father in Equilibrium hates art and free will and emotion, God does not, and, indeed, offers these things in spite of Satan's protesting against some of them.   The only thing that lines up is a revolution, but not all revolutions are Satanic allegory.    Preston doesn't bring 1/3 of the Clerics with him (meanwhile, in Pullman, Lord Asriel rallies an army from multiple worlds and dimensions), doesn't tempt anyone to stop taking their Prozium (in Pullman, Mary Malone tempts Lyra and Will to have pre-teen sex; yeah, those books are weird.)  There is no Eve, no Adam, no fruit, no war.   There's no reference points here between the two stories besides, again, a rebellion, which is totally different in character than the one in the original story.  If I were going to make Equilibrium a Satan-story, I'd actually say Sean Bean was the Lucifer-figure, and Preston was Adam/Eve, since he's the impetus for Preston to cease taking the Prozium - and it actually works as a ""retelling"" because the Original Story is about denying a fruit, and this story is about demanding the ingestion of a pill.   That aside, on your final point, I'm curious about something: Why is a human life sacrifice considered ""the ultimate price"" for an omnipotent being?   Well, Christ isn't just human.  He is also fully God.  The Hypostatic Union is basically ""100% Human + 100% God = 100% God and Human.""  If it seems mathematically impossible, that's 'cause it kind of is.  If God made too much sense, I'd find that fishy, personally.  So, Jesus Christ was fully God.    God, on the other hand, isn't ""good,"" he isn't ""loving,"" He isn't ""righteous,"" etc.  He IS goodness itself, love itself, righteousness itself, etc.  So, infinite goodness was crucified to atone for what is ultimately finite evil, which is what the sins of all men are.  Even if the world goes on for another 10 trillion years and humanity sins the whole time, God is still bigger than all of that sin, and so cancels it out.  Now, of course, lots of folks were crucified before Christ and lots after, but none were God."

I'm not a fan of the teeth and the tattoos in the slightest bit, but let's be honest, everyone....this is the Joker that we're getting.  Maybe they'll give it an in-story reasoning, like the teeth were replacements for getting his other teeth knocked out by Batman and the tattoos were something he did while locked up, but the primary reason why he looks the reason he does is simple: they wanted him to look that way.  He's not going to be Jason Todd, nor Dick Grayson, nor a doppelganger set up by ""The Real Joker""—he's just the Jared Leto version of The Joker similar to how Heath Ledger's Joker happened to have face paint and Jack Nicholson's was perma-white.  It sucks....but that's the reality. No twists."
FanTheories,3dvocg,ToeKneeManGo,120,Sun Jul 19 22:52:38 2015 UTC,"Precisely.  The reason the Joker looks the way he does is because the folks at WB said, ""Everyone loved TDK's Joker who was more dark and 'street' and criminal, and we sold a lot of stuff with him at Hot Topic, so let's amp all that up even more and make more money."""

FanTheories,3dvocg,AssCrackBanditHunter,89,Mon Jul 20 01:28:00 2015 UTC,"Which, I feel, basically sums up WB's entire attempt at any superhero franchises.  Marvel took a huge gamble with 'Iron Man', so they focused on having a good product instead of name recognition and playing on trends, and it paid off, and they keep doing it.  WB, on the other hand, keeps saying ""Oh, this is popular, how can we imitate this?""  That's why we have a Superman movie that feels like a Nolan Batman movie ('Man of Steel') at the expense of the main character's history, a Green Lantern movie that was basically trying to copy 'Iron Man' at the expense of the main character's history, and an upcoming Justice League team-up movie that's very reminiscent of 'Avengers'.  We look to have a Joker that looks like a more commercial version of Heath Ledger's popular interpretation, a Harley who is the same but like the 'Arkham' games.  Basically, it boils down to this:  Marvel: ""Let's get new fans by sharing what old fans have always loved about these characters.""  WB/DC: ""Let's get new fans by changing our established characters to be what market research shows people want."""
FanTheories,3dvocg,ZacPensol,19,Mon Jul 20 02:01:40 2015 UTC,": ""Let's get new fans by changing our established characters to be what market research shows people want.""   I can't help but taste the thick irony with this being attributed to DC films rather than Marvel comics."

FanTheories,3dvocg,Cranyx,5,Mon Jul 20 14:04:08 2015 UTC,"an upcoming Justice League team-up movie that's very reminiscent of 'Avengers'   I see this mentioned often, but honestly, DC has had many plans about a shared movie universe before this one. There have been several projects that were abandoned during development (other than Nolan's trilogy, that was never going to be a part of a bigger universe). There was a Flash movie, a Wonder Woman and most notably, George Miller's Justice League, which was cast and being developed before the writers guild strike.  Also, there were rumors of a universe starting from Green Lantern (thank god that didn't happen).  Obviously, the popularity of The Avengers helped this DC universe, but it's not like they weren't planning on doing that before."
FanTheories,3dvocg,PanPirat,2,Mon Jul 20 14:35:00 2015 UTC,"Phase 1 of Marvel always seemed very producer controlled to me, and I don't know about this Harley being similar to Arkham Harley, but other than that I agree."

Of course Harley betrays the squad and helps to keep them off his trail or feeds Joker info. Just cause we see Joker in flashbacks doesn't mean he won't be apart of the story. There are set photos of Joker and Harley arguing, before Harley goes insane and the car scene so if going based off your post this movie will be heavily centered for whatever reason around Harley or it it will be a movie centered around the suicide squad members origin stories which I personally think would suck."

Meanwhile people who aren't big comic fans and don't really care exactly how he looks are terrified by this Joker and can't wait to see him. I have yet to hear someone at my work or any of my friends who are not comic nerds like me complain about the Jokers look and most of them think it looks cooler than the others because it insights fear and gives off the perception that this guy is so off the wall there is no possible way to control him or reign him in.  Even as a big comic nerd whose been reading comics for 20 years I absolutely love this Joker because its a different take and IMO falls into the way I see the Joker. As someone who is proud of his accomplishments and doesn't give a damn what anybody thinks about him because in his big grand scheme they mean nothing anyway.

You are trying to downplay my personal opinion and my experiences with people around me regarding their opinions by trying to state that I work for the company and trying to promote this product. That in itself is slander. To state that is not a PR firm thing, or an accusation, its just a fact of what you are doing.

I just don't like it.   Which I suppose you could argue is ""the point""? I mean, the joker goes against most of the grains of society, but Ledger's joker looked pretty fucking cool. What with his sweet purple coat and green waist coat. In a way it kind of seems odd that someone who doesn't care what people think about them looks so bad ass.  On the flip, here we have a portrayal of that character that looks like a complete douche. And it goes against the grains of a lot of people, including lots of fans. Which is why I feel like his appearance is in its way quite true to the character. Its a new imagining of the character for sure, but the joker don't give no fucks that you think he looks stupid. He has tacky gold teeth because they are tacky and gold (and probably missing his real ones). He has shitty cringey tattoos because they are shitty and cringey. Should the Joker conform to the ideal image fans have of him? I don't think he should.  But I don't know. I dislike it, which is kinda why I like it."

FanTheories,3dvocg,SeriousJack,6,Mon Jul 20 08:07:10 2015 UTC,"The problem I have is that the DC universe just doesn't feel connected at all. We've had an amazing Dark Knight series of films that would've been perfect as a starting point.   Imagine if Man of Steel took place in that same universe. BvS is about an older Bruce Wayne. You could tell your audience ""Hey in this movie Batman has already done all the Batman things and seen it all"", but we already have three excellent movies that could serve that purpose and help the audience connect way more than just straight up telling them something.  On top of that we're gonna be introduced to a handful of other heroes in BvS. Obviously I haven't seen the movie yet, but I can't imagine they can cram enough character progression for you to care about all of them in the short span of a feature length movie.   They're all gonna feature in their own movies after that, but each of those movies will probably be about their origin, so the characters will not grow beyond what you've already seen in BvS, which doesn't have to be a bad thing per se (think about Breaking Bad, you kinda know what's happening and where it's all going, but it's the journey that matters most), but it takes a set of very talented writers and directors to pull that off, and as cool as these movies look they're just not on that level of amazing if you ask me.  I'm not trying to say these movies look bad to me, Man of Steel was pretty fun, albeit a bit strangely edited to me, and I'd be lying if I said the BvS didn't send some shivers down my spine. But as a connected universe, I don't know if things have been set up the right way for it to truly feel like this expanded world.  It's still early though, and I'm very curious to see where things will go, because Marvel has becoming stale and repetitive and it's time for some change ups."

I wouldn't believe that Superman or superpowers for that matter could exist in that world.   And of course it's not going to feel connected yet. We've only had one movie that's in this continuity."
FanTheories,3dvocg,XMenOrangesTangerine,4,Mon Jul 20 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I feel that drives home the point of BvS even more. The feel I'm getting from the trailers is that a huge part of the story is the world dealing with the fact aliens/superpowers exist, and the effect it has on different kinds of people. It'd be a great fit for the Nolan universe, cause it never felt like one where that'd be the case.  What I'm saying is of course based on trailers and speculation, I'm completely ready to be blown away by the upcoming movies though. Man of Steel was their first shot. I feel like they learned what did and didn't work from that movie, and they're gonna try to apply it to the future ones."
FanTheories,3dvocg,JamesMagnus,0,Mon Jul 20 12:25:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the Nolan trilogy tried so hard to not have superpowers. It wouldn't have been weird in the sense of ""Oh, how strange and new for the series."". It would've been weird in the sense of ""Why are superpowers suddenly okay now?""."
FanTheories,3dvocg,XMenOrangesTangerine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:37:47 2015 UTC,Because they are alien - it would have driven home how alien it all really was.
FanTheories,3dvocg,KRosen333,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:52:15 2015 UTC,Not all superpowers are alien. Just Superman's.   What about The Flash or Shazam?   It just wouldn't fit.

I thought we were talking about making the DCCU's Batman the Nolan Batman and just doing the whole Man of Steel, BvS, Cinematic Universe thing with Nolan's Batman.   If we're just talking about introducing a Superman into Nolanverse, then that's a different story.   We've been having two different conversations."
FanTheories,3dvocg,XMenOrangesTangerine,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"the DC universe just doesn't feel connected at all   In my opinion, it's exactly the opposite. BvS will be the second installment, and there's already the Trinity + Cyborg and Aquaman in cameo roles, supposedly. Then there's Suicide Squad, which will most probably tie in with Batman's story quite a bit. Then there's Wonder Woman, which I assume will be more like MoS in that it will be a solo movie. But then, there's Justice League, which will possibly begin with the team already established since the end of BvS (maybe not in full roster).  I think it'll be connected, but it's really too soon to judge that."

I think Ledger already gave us the best ""traditional"" Joker we will ever see on the big screen. I'd rather see someone else have a different take on the character than someone try to copy Ledger."
FanTheories,3dvocg,Purdaddy,38,Mon Jul 20 19:38:00 2015 UTC,"Ledger as the traditional Joker? I love Ledger's Joker as much as the next guy, but let's be real, he isn't anything like a traditional Joker. Just like Bane, Catwoman, Robin, Ras Al Ghul, and even Scarecrow and Batman to an extent, their DKT personas pale in comparison to their comic book personas in terms of powers and ridiculousness. Nolan's Batman Universe was grounded in reality and science. Joker in the comics is a psychotic, nihilistic crime prince with a clown obsession. He kills people with exploding wind up fake teeth and 1000-volt joy buzzers. He laughs maniacally and smiles constantly. Ledger's Joker was a nihilist, yes, but he was dark and brooding. He was realistic and gritty. Not to say he wasn't Joker-like. He was just a more realistic and serious one. I find it funny when people hate on Man of Steel so much for being so dark and gritty--which it was, and it definitely was a lot worse off because of it--and ruining Superman when one could say the same was basically done to the Joker in TDK. Mark Hamill's Joker is the perfect Joker in my opinion. He did to Joker what Hugh Jackman did to Wolverine; they changed the character with their performance. All I have to say is don't judge anything before you see it to its full extent. Man of Steel looked great, but ended up lackluster due to DC still trying to find the perfect tone for its cinematic universe and going too dark and rejecting the absurdity and true history of Superman. Ledger's Joker looked awful back in early 2008, but looked how awesome he turned out simply because of the performance. It doesn't matter how goofy and strange Leto's Joker looks, if it is a stunning performance, we will love it."
FanTheories,3dvocg,PMMeYourBootyPics,19,Mon Jul 20 03:44:41 2015 UTC,"1000-volt joy buzzers   That's the problem with insane super-villains. They just don't understand the important difference between voltage and amperage.  edit: that being said, for serious, I've been reading comic books for a long time. the only consistent quality the joker has is that he doesn't have any consistent qualities other than a colour scheme.  it's like he's some sort of... card.. whose .. qualities, um.. in the game that is being played are .. chosen.. arbitrarily to .. fit the situation."
FanTheories,3dvocg,BlackSwanX,13,Mon Jul 20 06:04:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if traditional = comic book, Jack Nicholson was much closer as far as live action hoes, and that's still a ways off.   I think that The Killing Joke has the best joker, personally, but I agree with Hamill outside of the comics."
FanTheories,3dvocg,wayne_fox,3,Mon Jul 20 10:15:37 2015 UTC,"Actually, if we're being honest, I'd say Cesar Romero in the old 60's TV show was probably the closest to the true comic book character we'll ever see in live action. He was ridiculous sure, but he kept the clown act going the entire time."
FanTheories,3dvocg,roadlesstravelled,3,Mon Jul 20 06:37:34 2015 UTC,You could say the entire show was as close to the comics as we'll ever get too

I doubt we will ever see a Joker as deranged as the one we get in some comic arcs. My ""traditional"" comment was referring to the disheveled or cartoony suit, obvious purple / green, archetypal ""insane"" character who should be in a mental institute. My whole point is that what we can see of the Leto Joker seems to deviate from the other movie Joker's significantly, but I'm still excited to see what he does with the character. Literally the first thing I said is that I'm excited to see Leto's Joker."

I'm most excited for Waller, if I'm being totally honest.  I'm sad she's not fat (again: looking at you CW), but I am absolutely stoked to see her played by someone with the gravitas and acting chops of freakin' Viola Davis.  That woman is a gem.  Seriously, the fact that we get Ben Affleck, Viola Davis, Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, Will Smith, Michael Shannon etc. in these movies but also relative newcomers like Cavill, Gadot, Ezra Miller, etc., gets me so pumped and makes me so grateful as a fan.  No disrespect to Marvel but they just can't compete with that star power and artistry, I man BvS was rewritten by an Academy Award-winning writer.   Let's hope all this talent isn't wasted."
FanTheories,3dvocg,Jordoom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:07:11 2015 UTC,What's artistry about an A-list cast?
FanTheories,3dvocg,samcuu,2,Mon Jul 20 10:19:22 2015 UTC,"The actors themselves have good artistry.  None of the Avengers actors have a ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""Argo"" or ""The Help"" or ""The Borgias"" or ""Revolutionary Road"" or ""Pursuit of Happyness"" on their resumes, that I'm aware of.   We have multiple Academy award winners working on the DC franchise.  Our Alfred has won multiple Emmys, an Oscar, a Tony.  It's cool.    I'm not ragging on Marvel's actors, they're great, but these DC actors have made things that are critically acclaimed in addition to just making good popcorn flicks.   The acting chops are undeniable, and I hope these films bring them out."
FanTheories,3dvocg,Jordoom,2,Mon Jul 20 11:07:52 2015 UTC,"I agree that there're plenty of talents involved in DC franchise now, but I was talking specifically about the cast. A big cast doesn't guarantee quality. Also if you want to talk about critically acclaimed works and awards then MCU has plenty as well. Joss Whedon, the Russo brothers, Kenneth Branagh, Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, Jeff Bridges, Anthony Hopkins, Natalie Portman, Robert Redford, Ben Kingsley,... Hell, even Hawkguy has had 2 Oscar nominations back to back. Not to mention the soon-to-appear like Josh Brolin or Benedict Cumberbatch. Some of these big names still didn't guarantee their part would be good or even significant. And both of these companies (WB and Marvel rather and than DC and Marvel) tend to find up and coming actors for their leading roles, which is a good thing. Honestly I don't see WB/DC has any advantage about talent, they're pretty equal (because big paychecks).  As a side note, all of Ben Affleck's notable feats are in the writing and directing department. As an actor he hasn't proven much, if any. Which is why when he got picked as Batman I'm mostly stoked about him getting to make his own Batman movie in the future. Not that I'm saying he will be a bad Batman (I never thought Batman was something hard to pull off), we'll have to wait to see about that."
FanTheories,3dvocg,samcuu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:23:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I was going to say. The person you replied to was cherry picking when it comes to talent.  Not that DC isn't going to have a ton of talent of course. That also doesn't mean marvel doesn't either!

FanTheories,3dvocg,Deadeye5,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:13 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the hate for Damaged Joker. The Joker has always been a psychotic lunatic. He should look like he's straight out of an asylum, which I think Leto's version certainly does. When I look at him, I see a guy who would beat a random person to death with his bare hands and laugh while he does it. While Leto's joker doesn't look like some classy agent of chaos, it would be both disrespectful and boring for him to try to go down the same route as Ledger's Joker. Instead I get the feeling that this is the type of Joker who will let out a cry of delight when he see's Batty show up, a different approach that is just as true to the character."
FanTheories,3dvocg,skpkzk2,3,Mon Jul 20 12:46:01 2015 UTC,"Unlike Marvel at the start of the MCU DC/WB is not betting the farm on all of this run of movies. But millions upon millions of dollars is still an assload of money!  But let's be honest I (and I assume since this in an online forum ""WE"") missed the golden age of both of these companies in their initial medium. The joker is inherently controversial.  When Heath Ledger spoke ill of Jack Nicholson's Joker I was livid! Boy was I wrong. The Joker is many things to many people, but one thing we can all agree on is an old character whom I cannot thing of a truly poor portrayal of. Caesar Romeo, Mark Hamil, Heath Ledger, to cosplayers everyone plays the role with such reverence that even Mr. 30 seconds from Mars Leto should know that if he approached this role with anything less than total reverence,,,'(we) aren't going to kill (him)! (We're) just going to hurt (him) really, REALLY bad.'  But I can't wait for the movie. Although I don't see other than explaining/defining Harley where he fits without Bats."

Batman is already established, with a dark past, having locked away the Joker for killing Robin. I don't see why Joker needs to be Robin."

My main issue with it is the fact that it's a bit too complex for what is going to be essentially one movie. If there was a batman movie between BvS and Suicide Squad then it would be a lot more plausible. As it stands though there only seems to be a few months in between.  If they went down this route that would leave them with a very confused audience, I'm more in the boat of the Joker is actually torturing Jason so that it sets up a villain for the solo Batman movie."

Maybe Willy Wonka knew which batches of candy bars contained the tickets and informed Slugworth to meet the children in the locations where they would be found?
FanTheories,3dy9vt,AKatt91,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:15 2015 UTC,"Funny how no one else mentioned Slugworth was working for Wonka. I'd agree with you, but surely he must have had to know Charlie (and the other kids) specifically were going to get the tickets, or he'd have been keeping tabs on every kid within radius of the shops they ended up in (plausible...?). It seems more likely the tickets must have been planted fairly carefully, rather than just be in known batches."
FanTheories,3dy9vt,Alec_the_Great,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:59 2015 UTC,"So... what is your theory on how the ticket holders were selected? Was Charlie always the person intended to win or was there actually a chance that any of the other kids could have actually won? If they had a chance to win, why would have they intentionally picked such asshole kids?"
FanTheories,3dy9vt,MiguelGusto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:52 2015 UTC,Drive.  Each of these children had incredible drive.  It was only through the factory games that Winks could judge who had pure intentions coupled with drive.
FanTheories,3dy9vt,Rock_N_Rye,2,Tue Jul 21 05:37:42 2015 UTC,I'd long reasoned that they had to have kept precise track of where the tickets were for exactly the reasons you listed. But I'd never thought to infer from that that Slugworth planted them. Clever OP.
FanTheories,3duekf,BearBruin,197,Sun Jul 19 16:01:35 2015 UTC,"This isn't really a theory, the release schedule for their movies has been out for a while now. They're gonna do BvS to establish the universe and characters a bit, then wonder woman and justice league. Then Aquaman, Flash and Shazam are getting their own movies to  build them up for the second JL movie and so on."
FanTheories,3duekf,FenrisCain,21,Sun Jul 19 18:27:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This isn't a theory at all; DC has said pretty much what the OP has written here more than a year ago.  For OP's next theory: ""Harry Potter was...a WIZARD!"""
FanTheories,3duekf,bubonis,8,Mon Jul 20 01:27:21 2015 UTC,"I think you mean ""Harry Potter is the chosen one, BUT so is this other guy"""
FanTheories,3duekf,bleucheese7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:49:47 2015 UTC,Where did DC say these movies would be prequels to Man of Steel?
FanTheories,3duekf,bubonis,4,Mon Jul 20 16:09:51 2015 UTC,"In your valiant but misguided attempt to defend your ""theory"", you're missing the very obvious point.  TL;DR: DC has a less-than-stellar track record with live action movies and they simply don't have the time, the momentum, or the budget to create half a dozen origin films for characters which the movie-going public may have already accepted.  DC has stated that there will be movies for many of the individual characters introduced in BvS, and there's even a timeline for their release. BvS is slated for March 2016. Based on the timeline, there are six stand-alone hero movies following it: Wonder Woman in June 2017, Flash in March 2018, Aquaman in July 2018, Shazam in April 2019, Cyborg in April 2020, and Green Lantern in June 2020. Based on Zach Snyder's own Twitter contribution, one of these heroes definitely won't be in Batman v Superman; six stand-alone heroes, plus Batman and Superman, is eight. That's one too many for Justice League. My guess is that Shazam will be the odd man out as he's the only one that hasn't gotten verifiable or at least strong confirmation of his appearance in BvS. But I'll bet that he'll probably be in Justice League (November 2017) and will definitely be in in Justice League 2 (June 2019).  So what does all of this have to do with your ""prequel"" theory?  Fact 1: DC's live-action movies are a train wreck. For literally decades the only thing they thought was marketable was Batman and Superman. The Michael Keaton Batman movies were good for what they were but afterwards they fell solidly on their faces and DC made no movement to capitalize on that universe — which is probably for the best. And we'll not even talk about the Green Lantern film, which I think is also for the best. The Nolan trilogy was an interesting take on Batman, making him ""more real"" than earlier movies, but frankly the movies were so bloody full of plot holes — particularly TDKR — that it would be highly impractical to expand the Nolan universe into the ""mainstream DC cinema universe"". Hence, a reboot was needed and we got it courtesy of Man of Steel.  Fact 2: For several reasons, DC can no longer afford to wait and their lineup shows they understand that. We're now seven years into Marvel's cinematic universe which officially started with the 2008 Iron Man movie. We've gotten origin stories for Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America. The Hulk's origin is well known enough thanks to the two recent pre-Iron Man movies so it doesn't need to be revisited, and Black Widow and Hawkeye's origins are simple enough to not require entire movies to expose them. Even in the recently-expanded Marvel universe we're familiar with the origins of Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Ant-Man, Vision, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, and War Machine (which was actually given to us in the second Iron Man movie), not to mention the Guardians. It took Marvel four years to build up their roster enough to create the Avengers movie (2012) and that's time that DC no longer has. Superhero movies are enjoying a renaissance right now but it won't last forever and right now Marvel is king. If DC were to take the same path as Marvel — individual origin stories followed by a team-up movie — we wouldn't see Justice League until 2019. That would be more than a decade after the first Iron Man movie. The odds of such a venture being successful, particularly when the movie-watching public is now so deeply entrenched in Marvel's universe, and particularly given the track record of DC's live-action movies (which is to say, limited and generally not very good), is pretty slim. So, DC is doing something reasonably smart: They're bringing the heroes (and villains) together FIRST, then spinning off individual movies afterwards. The villains move is actually a brilliant move on their part; they're doing something that Marvel hasn't done and has no real equivalent of (we all know Thunderbolts doesn't compare).  All of which brings us back to your ""prequel"" theory.  The public will get their first look at the Justice League — even if it's not officially named as such — in Batman v Superman, and will follow it up a year later with Justice League and two years later with Justice League 2. If the Batman v Superman story is compelling enough to make the characters memorable then DC has a reasonable shot at taking some thunder away from Marvel. That being the best-case situation, DC simply hasn't got the time or marketability to spend three years filling in the backstory on half a dozen characters which the movie-going public has already seen and accepted. They need to show the character's growth and evolution to make future movies more relatable and therefore more profitable for the studios. But if the Batman v Superman story fails, then DC is even less likely to spend money and time on filming backstories for the individual characters.  So bottom line is: DC is in a time crunch, origin stories are generally boring when you know the future of the character anyway (cough —Anakin Skywalker— cough), and there's a massive question mark hanging over Batman v Superman that isn't going to be settled until next year."
FanTheories,3duekf,bubonis,0,Mon Jul 20 16:56:59 2015 UTC,"I didnt say they would be origin stories in the sense that the hero is discovering who they are. We could see anything, such as Batman's first round with the Joker.  Your points dont refute anything."
FanTheories,3duekf,bubonis,0,Mon Jul 20 20:56:35 2015 UTC,"My points can't refute anything because you've proven nothing that can be refuted. All you have is a guess — that DC's stand-alone hero movies will be prequels. You can't refute a guess.  I've explained, pretty conclusively IMO, that it is impractical and illogical for DC to invest the time and money in prequels to characters in BvS and/or Justice League. Assuming they don't change their release calendar significantly, they're putting a huge amount of money into a relatively small amount of time, and it all depends on the complete success of BvS. That means the story, the production values, the CGI, the audio, the script, everything needs to be perfect. Most importantly it means the public needs to relate to those characters in such a way as to virtually guarantee the financial success of the sequels, and if there's one thing DC has always had a problem with it's making their heroes relatable to everyday people. Someone on reddit once summed it up perfectly: ""Marvel's characters are people trying to be heroes, while DC's characters are heroes trying to be people.""  You may be right and I may be wrong, of course. I don't think I am; I've got a lot of facts on my side, plus DC's history as supporting evidence. You've got a ""theory"" that's 80% what DC's already said about their movies, and 20% guesswork based on little more than supposition."

Marvel has done a good job balancing fun with depth with even their most serious movie (CA:TWS, I'd say) at least being fun, which MoS was almost totally bereft of."

FanTheories,3duekf,thetom,15,Sun Jul 19 23:42:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I'd call them campy, but I think a lot of the Marvel movies suffer from a sort of forced irreverence, where everyone tries to be super witty and funny all the time, to the point that it gets in the way of telling a good story (the antagonists and main plot line seem to fall by the wayside in favor of setting up more excuses for the heroes to look cool). This probably won't be a popular opinion but I think Whedon is partly to blame for this, and it's a problem I have with the rest of his stuff too.   The only ones I really felt successfully pulled off that tone without it getting in the way of the movie were Iron Man and Guardians of the Galaxy, and that's largely because Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Pratt are incredibly charismatic. The antagonists are still pretty paper-thin.  I haven't seen Age of Ultron yet, so I can't say if what I said here applies to it or not."

Obviously, this has somehow changed in the last years since comic books have become less niche. but that shift applies to both Batman and Superman.  Now I'm not talking about the fans of these characters, obviously, I'm just saying Batman and Superman are much more recognizable names between people who don't know much about comics (I'd say that between young people they're on par with Spider-Man in recognizability, even though they sell less merch).

My point is, the stats about merchandise, in my opinion, only represent the character's popularity in the lower age groups, that's why I think it's not right to call him a more recognizable character. Popular, yes (and again, I admit that I didn't word my original post really well), but I don't think that people who buy stuff with Spider-Man don't know Batman or Supes. And outside of that group, as I said, I believe more people know those 2.  And I don't think that Marvel's characters are more childish, I didn't mean to imply that in any way. It's just that the merchandise statistics mainly represent kids."

Spiderman can't ft but he swings, he has the proportionate strength of a spider which is pretty good, he's very agile and has spider sense.

I'm going to comment on what I meant by picking at your ""I'm a Marvel fanboy"" line and maybe giving you some insight into the disagreements with you.  Marvel fanboys tend to be completely and totally ignorant of DC. They're the people who still thinks Aquaman sucks because of Super Friends. They think Marvel heroes are infinitely more powerful than they actually are, and will go out of their way to understate DC's influence over the industry as a whole at any opportunity. They think Deathstroke is a ripoff of Deadpool. Marvel fanboys tend to use the argument that the Marvel Universe is more realistic, when it hasn't been in decades. They don't see the logic inconsistency between the reaction to Civil War and the reaction to Genosha - Genosha should be a bigger fucking deal than Stamford EVER was."

FanTheories,3duekf,aetheos,-2,Sun Jul 19 21:46:12 2015 UTC,"Right. And one of the problems that other people here are having is that they're not taking accumulated recognition into account. Chances are that your average, totally random person knows Batman, either from the serials, the Adam West show, the Burton movies, the Schumaker movies, the Nolan movies, the comic or the various animated series over the years. Some of the Marvel franchises just don't have that wide generational appeal over various forms of media for decades - I'd think Spiderman or the X-Men would be closest that Marvel has, but they don't have that broad, multi decade presence that the DC heroes have.  Just because your grandparents aren't buying Superman merchandise doesn't mean they don't know who Superman is. They may or may not know who Spiderman is, but Superman and Batman have been as close to unavoidable for a non fan as a comic book character gets."

No ""Harry/Galahad would have been proud of you"" or a funeral or the drinking scene to toast to him (like they did to the agent who died in present day at the beginning).   How is there no tribute to him whatsoever?  That's also another question: WHERE ARE ALL THE OTHER KINGSMEN?!?!  The only thing they said that might be even a remote explanation is after Eggsy asks Merlin what to do now that Arthur is dead, Merlin just says ""the question is 'what are we going to do?' We don't have a lot of time and we don't know who's in Valentine's pocket and who isn't.""  I highly doubt that he got to any of the Kingsmen agents by himself, and there's no way Arthur told the plan to all the agents and everyone agreed, or told each one individually and they all agreed.  Merlin could have contacted all the other Kingsmen, told them about the SIM cards, and find a way back to home base, whether by private jet that has zero SIM cards, driving by themselves, flying a small passenger plane themselves back, or find some way back that doesn't involve being near other SIM cards.

FanTheories,3dv6g8,Stevemacdev,2,Sun Jul 19 23:19:13 2015 UTC,Good theory but if you read the comic that the film sticks very closely to he's pretty dead.
FanTheories,3dv6g8,MoravianPrince,2,Mon Jul 20 08:00:09 2015 UTC,"Perhaps he really dies in the second one.    The movie has very good reasons to stray from the source this time since 1) there is no sequel to the source anyway, 2) only some of the concepts are the same....everything else is very different, and they made a lot of changes to make the movie its own thing (sort of like how Marvel's Civil War will mimic the comics a lot but be its own thing and have its own story) and most importantly 3) the movie made over $400 million on just $60 million, surpassing even Fox's highest hopes.  Colin Firth is a huge reason why people went -- he's a great actor whom people like and who gives the film legitimacy.   They can't have just Mark Sfrong leading the team. As another example of a difference from the source, doesn't he get killed like Arthur in the books? Wasn't that why people expected him to backstab Eggsy?  Just about all the names are different, Kingsmen isn't even a term they use, and they don't use medieval fantasy Knights of the round table names.   There's a TON of changes from the sources. It's like Batman V. Superman being ""based on"" The Dark Knight Returns graphic novel....but not really."
FanTheories,3dv6g8,ColdFeetWarmHeart,2,Mon Jul 20 10:15:34 2015 UTC,That would be interesting. Either way if they make a second film I'll watch it.
FanTheories,3dv6g8,Mozzius,2,Mon Jul 20 10:19:22 2015 UTC,"90-95% of movies that make money like $400 million on $60 million get sequels, and the 5-10% are movies are impossible to have sequels, like Passion of the Christ or biographies or one-off stories, like if Fight Club made money. Inception is a movie that just can't have a sequel. Or Good Will Hunting.   Although, Gone Girl might get a sequel despite there being no sequel to the book. Not sure how they would do it, but studios always look for ways to profit."
FanTheories,3dv6g8,godiebiel,2,Mon Jul 20 11:02:25 2015 UTC,"I think this one was that kind of movie that would let a good guy bite the dust. Plus if he would be not dead means there would be no space at the table for the new guy. Unless in the sequel he reapears as the new Arthur, with selective recostruction surgery, if they dont get Colin for that part again."
FanTheories,3dv6g8,blackrose1901,2,Mon Jul 20 08:24:23 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking... That Galahad becomes takes Arthur's position.   There's actually a medieval tale where Galahad is deemed the chosen one for the quest for the holy grail, and Arthur's Knights follow Galahad instead of Arthur.   Whatever the case, I really liked the idea of them being modern day Knights, which improves upon the comics where they're just secret service.  Their gentleman code mirrors the gallantry and honor of Knights, and they have their bespoke suits that substitute for armor, and they even have a table for all the Knights to sit and meet in, like King Arthur's Knights of the round table."
FanTheories,3dv6g8,samchew511,2,Mon Jul 20 10:53:59 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your theory! However I do believe that there was a toast for him remember? It also played into Arthur's death scene.  It showed eggsy walk into the room with Arthur saying they all just drank to him with that brandy and eggsy again says it tasted a bit shit. However adding this, I am not saying your theory is wrong. just that there was in fact a sort of recognition from the other kingsman... UNLESS they were not having a toast and Arthur was making it up!"
FanTheories,3dv6g8,Netwinn,2,Mon Jul 20 12:05:08 2015 UTC,"I liked how he died. It was so sudden, by not having any zooming in on his face with sad music it added to to what Valentine said, ""It's not one of those films"" (I think - that's a guess at the actual quote).

FanTheories,3dv6g8,Xydos,2,Sun Jul 19 21:30:24 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm thinking more on the lines of Gallahad waking up in a hospital in the middle of a red neck town with no desire or means of contacting any of the kingsmen. With guilt and shame about what happened in the church and getting caught by Valentine.He's obviously had some sort of major damage either making him wheel chair bound or worse. This would add to the comedy of the upper crust british gentlman stuck with (shock horror!) Brash Americans. It's a good idea for Eggsy to visit the deep south on a huntch Gallahad is still alive and persuade him to come back home."

Roshi's comment on mastering the Kamehameha in fifty years was probably bunk, as he didn't count on training better than his or people with a natural predisposition towards fighting. Also, his skill seems to be perversion, not fighting or Ki, so it is likely that fifty years is how long a human without the skill of fighting needs.  It seems that each human has a single specific skill, however; people like Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, and Hercule are gifted at fighting, while the Briefs family is gifted at intellectual pursuits.  Of course, not everyone's gift is so obvious or potent; it is likely that most humans have a gift that cannot be found within their lifetimes, or perhaps one that is only very minor."

He's afraid of his dad Morris, but he's optimistic about the future after destroying what is to him the ultimate symbol of consumer culture.  Speaking of destroying cars, Ferris disappears from Cameron's life when the Ferrari is destroyed, and Durden disappears from Jack's life when that car is destroyed.  Ferris and Durden both end up as almost mythological figures in personality cults. Ferris is the beloved hero of his school who everyone hears wild stories about, and Durden's about the same in the fight club. They're both larger than life, and they don't go through any personal development: They just are, like forces of nature.  But Cameron and Jack are ignored, marginal figures. Note how almost no one interacts directly with either of them in either film except Ferris/Durden and Sloane/Marla. However, they do develop in personality. They are protagonists who change.  Ferris and Durden each take Cameron and Jack's on a boundary-pushing adventure. Ferris and Durden each test the limits of society. The break the rules and both thumb their noses especially at the wealthy/yuppie class (Ferris crashing the rich restaurant and Durden pissing in restaurant soup).  There's even parallels between Jack's boss and Principal Rooney. They're both trying to restrain characters from acting out.

I'll tell you what they do- they make me replace them, that's what they do.   I'm trying to run a business empire here and every time I need to get some engineer with a fiber optic scope up here to diagnose a broken compressor or fish a man sized crocodile out of a steam tunnel I lose another days productivity on a lucrative real estate investment.   So yea, the God damned building codes call for man sized duct work. Will it cost more? Sure. I don't give a shit. The average building in this city will have its duct work replaced four times before Penguin or Riddler blows the damn thing to hell with the plastic explosives our worthless customs authority never manages to intercept and three of those replacements will be me footing the bill.

FanTheories,3dqso4,Killfile,19,Sat Jul 18 23:34:25 2015 UTC,"Well there would be a reason why main ducting would be that large, and be able to support large amounts of weight. Often those types of ducting are used for the massive intakes, and frankly speaking, anytime you have an intake fan, eventually it will break, and someone, someones, will have to crawl up in there and fix that shit.

In City we go though enough buildings that they are a representative slice of the neighbourhood and they all have the same ducts.

FanTheories,3dsbua,Laragon,38,Tue Jul 21 16:25:22 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you consider to be a villain that 'sucks,' because it's not like you can compare them all fairly. Each villain serves a particular purpose with lower tier/more personal villains needed for the individual movies and bigger galactic threats needed for the team-ups. Only Malekith and Ronan are out-and-out failures.  The Incredible Hulk / Iron-Man / Iron-Man 2 / Ant-Man Villains like Abomination, Iron Monger, Whiplash and Yellowjacket are villains in much more localised hero vs villain stories, so it made sense that they were equal or slightly lesser than the heroes they were fighting as their very existence is as a response to the heroes existence and a will to rival them.  The Winter Soldier / Iron-Man 3 The same can sort of be said of The Winter Soldier and The Mandarin/Killian, though their movies are less hero vs villain and more hero vs burgeoning conspiracy. Regardless, the stories aren't global or intergalactic (though they threatened to become that if the villains weren't stopped) but focused on the hero. The organisations are humans doing all they can to achieve the strength of the heroes they're coming up against and almost achieving it.  The First Avenger / Thor This is a pattern that can be seen across most of the films: while the nature of the threat is different, in most of the non-team-up films the only way the focus can be kept on the singular hero (not involving the rest of the Avengers and the wider world) is to keep the threat on their level. Otherwise they'd all be Avengers movies. The Red Skull is a human who has accessed a power he doesn't fully understand. Cap stops him in time; had he not, the world would have bowed to him. Likewise with Loki, whose cunning rivals Thor's outright power. An even match in some respects, and had Loki not been defeated their home would have been irreparably changed.  The Dark World / Guardians of the Galaxy Malekith and Ronan are sort of a departure from this. These are actual commanders who the heroes get in the way of, not villains who emerged explicitly because of the existence of the heroes. They're also by far the two weakest villains, mainly because they're caught in this uncomfortable midpoint between personal story and intergalactic disaster. There's no personal struggle between Thor and Malekith or between the Guardians and Ronan, but nor are Malekith or Ronan imposing enough to involve the wider galaxy. That's why they fail.  Avengers Assemble / Age of Ultron It's only now that we come to the bigger 'galactic' threats that necessitate the involvement of multiple heroes: Loki/The Chitauri and Ultron. Loki/The Chitauri goes for the opposite of the earlier villains: not personal, but galactic. Yes, there's the Thor/Loki tension but the focus of the film isn't heroes vs villains, but 'can the heroes swallow their pride and fight together.' This struggle is expended in Age of Ultron. Ultron is a united common evil, like the Chitauri, who seeks to separate them.  To be honest, the last four villains (Malekith, Ronan, Loki/The Chitauri and Ultron) are the only villains that I think your complaint is relevant to. All of them could have done more to demonstrate their power. With Malekith, Ronan and Loki/The Chitauri this can be justified by them not being the true villain, but a dragon for a greater villain (be it Thanos, Loki, whoever), so Ultron is the only villain who really could or arguably should have been more threatening.  So if they're meant to 'all suck on purpose,' then Marvel's doing a poor job, because the majority of their villains do exactly what they need to do.  Malekith and Ronan still sucked ass, though."

I think your argument for the Nolan villains only seems like it stands because of the gritty realistic tone of the films. Perhaps Red Skull, Loki and the like don't have arcs that you can identify with, but they were definitely understandable.

Red Skull is literally just a Nazi, Iron Monger and Justin Hammer are just war profiteers. I suppose whiplash had the potential to be a better villain if he was fleshed out more."

Possibly War Machine (although there is always the chance he could get his own spinoff movie so I doubt they'll take the financial loss).  Thor is now a woman in the comics so that's a possibility, and in a ""What If"" Black Widdow is worth and wields the hammer.   There really aren't enough characters to kill anyone off unfortunately. I can't see them taking out any of the Gardians. Daredevil was a huge success so he's not in the crosshairs (assuming he's involved one day with the Avengers franchise during the Infinity Wars). Doctor Strangr, Black Panther, Ant-Man, they're all budding (or will be by The Wars) franchises. The Marvel comic universe is fricken huge but the Mavel Cinematic Universe is still pretty tiny when it comes to expendable or sacrificial characters."

Maybe--maybe--you can complain about Ultron in that respect, but to complain about Iron-Man and Ant-Man villains not being being as destructive and threatening as Thanos is just absurd. If those villains were, they wouldn't be solo movies."
FanTheories,3dsbua,RigattoniJones,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about?? All I'm saying is that I've seen people saying the same thing about Ant-Man that's been said about Ultron; that the villain wasn't as menacing as they could have been and was ultimately just convenient to a plot catered to the heroes. I haven't even seen Ant-Man yet, just saying that it seems fishy to try and have Ant-Man's back if the villain was done as poorly as people seem to think Ultron was. No idea if that's true yet, but if Corey Stoll was just there to have a reason for some big fights (an argument I read on /r/marvelstudios) then I would agree that Marvel's villains need some work and it's not some brilliant, in-the-shadows-long-con to make Thanos appropriately powerful. I guess I'm just cynical that the writers planned that out."
FanTheories,3dsbua,writes_stuff,2,Sun Jul 19 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"My point is that an Ant-Man villain can only be as menacing as the Ant-Man origin allows. Yellowjacket is a lower tier villain, but it's got nothing to do with Thanos. He's the villain that the film needed.  Not that the film is perfect. It's great fun and very well made in places but it's a very flawed film."
FanTheories,3dsbua,RigattoniJones,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:04:04 2015 UTC,"So I think we're saying the same thing haha, like I said, I haven't seen Ant-Man yet. I agree that the villains capability should be in line with the heroes, I think the only question we differ on is whether Ultron was fit for his movie. I don't think we should excuse AOU's tone just because when Thanos comes into play in Infinity War it'll retro-actively stand out as a time when the Avengers were just that on top of their game."
FanTheories,3dsbua,writes_stuff,3,Sun Jul 19 23:04:23 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't think it's helpful to downgrade one villain for the benefit of a future villain. That said, I did find Ultron to be fit for the movie. Again, I think (like Red Skull) he has a problematic power set. Like Red Skull, if Ultron were to take over he would be functionally unstoppable (within one movie anyway!) so the only way for the Avengers to take him out (and contain it to one movie) is for them to halt his rise, like Cap did with Red Skull.  (Side Note: It annoys me a little that the MCU uses famous comic titles and then doesn't deliver. As someone said before, Age of Ultron is more like Weekend of Ultron. I don't think it negatively affects the movie, just the expectations.)  So the very nature of Ultron as a villain necessitates that they take him out during his rise rather than when he's an unstoppable crushing machine. The reason I still think he works is that he's an interesting parallel to Tony (which, funnily enough, is where all the best Batman villains came from, too: parallels of Batman). The mechanical heartlessness at his core is an exaggeration of Tony's own motivation for creating him, which itself feeds back into the post-9/11 feelings that recent MCU movies have been pushing. His unusual 'wit' comes from Tony, too. He is, in many respects, a bizarro Iron-Man and what he does with his robot minions is a dark mirror of what Tony could do, too. The actual arguments that Tony gets in with the other Avengers over his and Visions creation echo this.  So I think he's fit for the movie, partially because he serves as bizarro Stark and partially because he presents a deeper and more serious issue of togetherness within the Avengers team, due to the conflicting opinions."
FanTheories,3dsbua,RigattoniJones,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"Fucking phenomenal points, this is exactly why I love the universe the MCU has been putting together. That weekend of Ultron comment really sums up the limit of my disappointment; like you said they had to contain it to one movie. So to look back at both the world building and the affects Ultron could and did have on the Avengers as just a team, I would have to agree that he totally fits.   How do you feel about Leto's joker? And also please elaborate on your feelings on the 9/11 thing, I swear I've heard this before so I just dipped my toe into that line of thought on google a couple of minutes ago and I'm interested haha"
FanTheories,3dsbua,writes_stuff,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"Leto's Joker looks like he'll be a better villain than he will be a Joker. There's a certain skinhead vibe from him that will probably end up being intimidating and threatening and overall good to watch, but at the same time he feels a little too... normal to be the Joker. Obviously he looks like he's insane, but when you look at any other incarnation of the Joker, even the Nicholson and Ledger Jokers, they're not insane men so much as men so divorced from reality that they're barely human anymore.  Then again, neither Nicholson nor Ledger had a Harley Quinn, so perhaps Leto's skinhead vibe is to make him closer to a real-life violent thug and make a Harley Quinn relationship understandable? It seems from the trailers that Harley Quinn doesn't begin as Harley Quinn, so if the twisted romance angle is pushed, the producers may think Harley falling for a relatively normal violent thug makes more sense than her falling for a traditional Joker.  And on the 9/11 thing, while some of the early MCU movies played around with the military-industrial complex (The Incredible Hulk, Iron-Man, Iron-Man 2), from The Avengers on there's a slightly more post-9/11 feel, where the Chitauri attack on New York serves as the MCU's 9/11 and almost everything that occurs on earth after that mirrors the US government's supposedly undemocratic response to 9/11.  MovieBob described The Winter Soldier in this regard very succinctly:   Something bad happened in New York. [picture of 9/11]  The government is reacting with pre-emptive strikes and curtailing civil liberties. [picture of George Bush]  And the living embodiment of all that is right in America is unhappy about it.   But Stark's creation of Ultron falls under this, too: a misguided attempt to protect earth which goes too far. Thor's bringing Vision to life applies, too, as he does it in response to a vision of what's to come. And in a slightly more amoral way, you can include Yellowjacket and the Mandarin in here too. (I won't say how because you've not seen Ant-Man yet.) Guardians and Thor 2 don't really apply, mainly because their essential struggles occur off-earth.  But yeah, in a sense all the earth-bound post-Avengers movies have a shade of post-9/11 paranoia about them. I think it works for the most part, too, though some of the dialogue in The Winter Soldier pertaining to it (""I thought the punishment usually came after the crime!"") is incredibly cringey with the subtlety of a brick."

Genisys was very much implying the lack of surety when it comes to fate and the problematic nature of time travel (you can always go back to change what someone else went back to change). Skynet Vs Skynet would be an interesting twist.
FanTheories,3dtzg0,writes_stuff,2,Sun Jul 19 15:38:44 2015 UTC,"What if a a future Skynet (beyond Matt Smith) becomes sentient in a way that develops remorse, thus attempting to thwart itself?"
FanTheories,3dtzg0,zakmac85,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"How might that work? From that perspective, what could one timeline's version of Skynet do besides repeat the steps that led to, and thus ensure its own existence? Hasn't any version of Skynet that exists in the future already won out over any other version by virtue of its existing? No version of Skynet can fight to try to exist if it doesn't already because to act requires existing already? And if they did somehow ""co-exist"" in literal alternate timelines, what interest could they possibly have in each other?  I'm not trying to shit on your theory, as I do expect some sort of twist like that (who else besides Skynet could it be if they're holding back for a twist? There aren't that many characters). I just think the franchise is trying to hard to do cool time travel stuff without putting any real work into figuring out even the basic logic of how it would work. The first film is so brilliant because it leaves every possibility-multiple timelines, single dynamic timelines, or a single immutable time loop--all on the table. Since then they've increasingly tried to have their cake and eat it too, borrowing from whatever theory seems coolest at a given moment, stopping Skynet, no wait it's inevitable, well actually you can change things but the universe still really wants judgement day to happen so it doesn't matter that you changed things....I dunno."
FanTheories,3dtzg0,CommissionerValchek,2,Mon Jul 20 00:06:45 2015 UTC,"Hasn't any version of Skynet that exists in the future already won out over any other version by virtue of its existing?   Well, no. We know from Kyle's experience in the movie that something from Timeline A can cross over into Timeline B, if it injects itself into that timeline by time traveling. Kyle didn't travel back to the intended timeline (1984, where Sarah is helpless), he traveled back to an already-altered one... alterations that John Connor was apparently unaware of. More, we know that things crossing those timelines can have the memories of multiple timelines simultaneously, as Kyle does. So it's quite possible for a Skynet instance to have knowledge of more than one timeline's events.   I just think the franchise is trying to hard to do cool time travel stuff without putting any real work into figuring out even the basic logic of how it would work.   That's probably true, yeah."
FanTheories,3dtzg0,CommissionerValchek,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:24:46 2015 UTC,"To be honest I haven't seen Genisys, though I've read tons of comments on the plot. I wasn't clear on that ability to travel from one timeline to another, though that does jibe with what I'd read before. It also makes no sense to me whatsoever, unless you have a Back to the Future ripple effect kinda thing going, but that was certainly never established in any other movie. To my mind it only makes sense to get to another timeline by going back and affecting changes that create that timeline."
FanTheories,3dtzg0,-bonesaw-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:51:38 2015 UTC,"It's actually stumbling towards a coherent theory of time travel for Terminator. Certain points are not ""fixed,"" but rather ""nexus"" points in time, which are very very significant to the continued health and stability of the timeline, and thus form points at which multi-timeline-memories can be formed. So we've got something short of Dr. Who's ""fixed point in time,"" but something that's also not causative chaos. The point in time in question in Genisys was Kyle Reese traveling back in time, which Matt Smith!net used to attack John Connor, which didn't happen in the first Terminator movie. Not a fixed point, but its disruption apparently rippled outwards at least insofar as Reese's memory was concerned. But disruptions at other points in the timeline didn't cause multi-timeline memories (Sarah had similar disruptions to the T1 timeline, but no multi-timeline memories)."
FanTheories,3dtzg0,ENGR_Demosthenes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:55:56 2015 UTC,"this is about what i was thinking in regards to pops...the moment kyle  says he could be programmed like a sleeper cell.that was his first reaction, and the rest of the film is trying to show the audience that that is incorrect... but you can't disprove the idea by pops protecting them. on a side note,i could see arnold and the film makers saying,its been 30 years since we saw the t 101 as a bad guy.lets make that a twist."
FanTheories,3dtzg0,ENGR_Demosthenes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:24:41 2015 UTC,"I agree with your theory. I have an open question though about the movie. Why couldn't John Connor kill Sarah? And why would John want Kyle and Sarah to join him?  I know from the Sara Connor Chronicles that a bunch of T-1000s Txs and T-800s developed sentience outside of skynets control and wanted a truce/alliance against skynet, they wanted to coexist with humans, so long as they could reassured that they wouldn't be killed. So they only trusted John Connor to have a truce with, not any other human.  Anyway, we see from that show, from T3, and I believe genisys that terminators do develop emotions and independent desires beyond their programming. So, I think pops was sent by skynet but I think he does love Sarah and so he will overide his programming and betray skynet.  Also as you implied, I wrote in a post a week or so ago that I think it is very interesting that in the current genisys timeline, skynet has achieved two main goals, delaying judgement day, and having the possibility of John Connor not leading the resistance post judgement day (this is because even though he could still be born he obviously needs a while to grow up and also he won't have perfect knowledge of future events)."

He planned the bank robbery and he planned to be captured in the MCU and he planned to blow up a hospital which would have to had taken weeks of preparation. The joker is so deceitfully smart in this movie it's unreal. His whole purpose in the movie is to get batman to break his one rule, to kill and to create chaos by showing all the flaws of society."
FanTheories,3dt212,Pm_Me_Gifs_For_Sauce,35,Sun Jul 19 04:32:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that krillin is held back by his state of mind more often than not - there's a lot of evidence he's actually one of the best tactical fighters in the dbz universe yet he often freezes up at the key moment - but I don't think he had the potential to keep up with a Saiyan. Humans heal after injuries to about the same strength as they were originally and advance only through training and success, while saiyans, win or lose, grow more powerful. Given equal time, a saiyan should always be stronger than a human."
FanTheories,3dt212,Tombot3000,18,Sun Jul 19 05:31:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, sadly we all love Krillin but there is no way for a human to ever be stronger than a saiyan. Look at Tien. He is as serious about training as Vegita is and yet he eventually fell behind. Not for lack of trying or will power, just genetics.

FanTheories,3dt212,Democrab,6,Mon Jul 20 10:04:34 2015 UTC,"It's some time ago since I read the manga but if I recall correctly, Roshi set Goku and Krillin the task of moving an enormous boulder early in Dragonball, anticipating that neither would be capable. Both students pulled it off but Goku could push the boulder much further than Krillin could. Couple that with him learning the kamehameha much faster and it provides some good evidence that Goku is both stronger and a faster learner than Krillin even from the start."
FanTheories,3dt212,Gopherbroke00,6,Sun Jul 19 14:41:36 2015 UTC,"I will certainly agree that Krillin has not even come close to touching his upper limit of power. If he did, he would likely never be stronger than the saiyans. A big part of that is the lack of transformation for humans, which carries huge weight in terms of power in the Dragonball universe.   I do think that in addition to what you said, it's largely humanity that holds him back as well. We see Gohan, who may be the inherently strongest person in the shows, slip behind others because of different priorities. After Cell, he doesn't focus on training. And after Buu, he is an academic and a father. Similarly, Krillin always wanted to settle down and have a family, so training was never his top priority. Vegeta and Goku are kind of assholes, in that they shirk their families and responsibilities all the time to get stronger.   I do have little doubt, though, that while Krillin would never be as strong, that if he had the same mindset as Goku and Vegeta that he could beat them. Even as a weaker fighter, Krillin is a FAR superior strategist to Goku, and could easily outclass him in tactics. Vegeta is a much better tactician (referred to as a master tactician by both Kabito Kai and Frieza), but Krillin was always shown to perform better when outmatched, and was never done in by his own arrogance.   Tl;Dr: Krillin wouldn't be stronger but could beat the Saiyans.   Edit: Typo"
FanTheories,3dt212,serpent222,4,Sun Jul 19 11:51:05 2015 UTC,I'm sure Krillin has potential to be the best human fighter but you have to be kidding to say he could equal a sayain...

Again not to knock Krillin, but he's just not in the same league as the sayains or even with Piccolo."

FanTheories,3dt7gj,kisforkmo,15,Sun Jul 19 07:59:36 2015 UTC,"Because the comics never had any adult characters. The focus was ALWAYS on the kids and only the kids. I'm not even sure if we saw the adults from the waist down or anything, like they used to do with Nanny on Muppet Babies.   And that works in comic strip form because you're only working with like 4-8 panels at a time. You can easily leave the adults out and just focus on the kids because in a comic strip you only have time for a quick back and forth or to tell a single joke or whatever. Even the storylines that continue over are usually told within a week or two and consist of only a few scenes. Like Charlie Brown trying to kick a football can be a storyline that sustains the comic for an entire week, using that situation to tell a different type of joke each time.   But when you switch to animation, you suddenly have a lot more time to fill. The kinds of stories and jokes they did in the comic strip can only fill up a minute or two of an animated special. So the cartoons need bigger, more in-depth storylines which are hard to do without any adult characters whatsoever. It's hard to have a ten minute scene play out in a school classroom with no teachers whatsoever, you know?   So when they adapted these comic strips to a cartoon format, they had to figure out what to do about those inevitable situations when they needed an adult figure to help drive the plot. They could have just invented a bunch of adult characters for the animation, but ultimately the focus of Peanuts has always been the children and their worldview. Adding adult characters changes that perspective and it changes the tone of the cartoon.   By making the adults non-characters in a sense, the animation was able to keep the spirit of the comics, which feature only child characters, without creating a logistical nightmare for the writing staff of the animated adaptation. Taking adult characters completely out of the picture would limit what the cartoon could do and still feel realistic. Without adults, you couldn't do stories at a school or any place of business like a store or movie theater or whatever. But adding adult characters disrespects the source material and draws focus away from the theme of having a bunch of kids who act like adults.   So we get adults who are there as basically props. They're stand-ins that let us know that these kids aren't living in a Lord of the Flies kind of situation, without drawing any focus. It's like when you see a play that uses puppetry and the puppeteer is visible, but wearing black to indicate that you should focus on the puppet instead of the actor.   If anything, you have to hand it to them for finding a creative way to maintain the spirit of the comic strip. If Peanuts had first been adapted in 2015, there'd probably be all sorts of adult characters with celebrity voices. Thankfully the upcoming movie looks to be taking its cues from the original cartoons, so we can probably expect plenty of trombone voices."

I feel as though time travel in the Terminator universe is HARD, and perhaps how we view it as an audience is different to how the people/machines in the future actually understand it. Kind of unrelated to your theory, but I feel like it's easier to send a person back to a date the closer it is to the date you're sending them back. Which is why they don't send the T-1000 back to 1984 to assist the T-800 and kill Kyle Reese or back to a day before the events of the first film. Or maybe they don't pick the date and there are specific windows in time one can go through (explaining why they always arrive in pairs)."

So T0 (premovie) Skynet is independently developed, identifies the resistance leader, sends a T-800 back in time.  T1 Skynet (Skynet as a result of the events of Terminator 1) sees that a Terminator was already sent and that it was used to help build itself, and sends a T-800 back to the original point to ensure its existence, then sends a T-1000 to try and kill John."

As for the cutaway jokes I think it's just likely that their lives have been filmed longer than what were shown. In the first episode no one acts like it's weird they're being filmed, so I doubt the first episode we see is actually their first time being filmed."

There are plenty of vaults that don't have any evidence of pipboys in them. So point 3 doesn't really work for this theory.   Also to argue point 1, vault 111 may be using experimental stasis, allowing the Sole Survivor to be over 200 years old but physically young. House is using his own tech, and Braun is part of another experiment all together.   Plus the main character (from the e3 showcase) seems to have pretty intact pre-war memories, where he used to live, who codsworth is, I assume his wife and child. If he is really just a hidden android with falsified memories the ones he seems to have are a bit too exact for memories put in by probably semi-rushing activists, even with information in the vault.  I also believe that even if Androids are near identical to humans Codsworth (even  being outdated tech) would notice something different about the SS. Though this point i'm making doesn't have any ground to stand on. just an idea.  I'd like to think that the SS is an android but to be honest I'd really like him to be that man we see pre-war thrown into the post apocalypse 200 years later.   Having him be an android seems a bit cliche and expected for the game. Either way though I'll still be happy with that plot point in the story if it exists."

If you live in a small town and you move to London, which I did when I was 20, then when you go back out into the other small towns in England you go 'oh my god, it's all the same!' It's like Bodysnatchers: literally our towns are being changed to death.""[9]  In an interview for Entertainment Weekly, Pegg told Clark Collis, ""People think we choose the genre first every time, and it's not true.

FanTheories,3dpcih,mquentin,19,Sat Jul 18 03:58:56 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking Batman V Superman will fill in some gaps between 66 and Burton.   If, as it seems given the trailers, Batman V. Superman will be a Batman coming out of retirement, wouldn't it fit better at the end of your timeline?  There are so many things I could touch on with this one. But the one I want to focus on is the multiple times Batman does certain things for the first time. According to your schema, he does all the following for the first time twice:  *Meets the Joker  *Meets Catwoman  *Meets Bane  *Has a Batsignal installed  *Becomes public knowledge  *Learns to work with partners/trust people  *Lives in a dark, dreary Gotham"
FanTheories,3dpcih,NewLeaf37,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:36:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure of Sadman V Superman will fit at all, but you might be correct.  As for the repeats, I thought about all that a lot too. I'm not sure that he ever states ""I'm meeting X for the first time,"" so with Joker he is aging and going from a makeup wearing young man to a gangster, Bane looks totally different and had a vendetta and Catwoman sort of shifted to become more or an antihero by the end.  Gotham is a lot harder to sell. People are constantly just noticing him, making press releseased that he is new, Gordon gets old and young and his rank changes. He vows revenge on Batman, smashes the signal and then it's back in the sky.   However, in Batman Begins they talk about his parents giving money to the town and it delayed its economic ruin (Ra's says they tried a new way to destroy bad cities) so I think going from Burton/Nolan bleak to neon and Technicolor could be from Wayne Enterprises being taken over by a man who would most likely do the same kinds of social programs. Eventually he quits, once Robin dies, and everything descends back.   This theory would also work better if Robin was a hopeful kid and not a fifty year old man."

I also think Nolan intended to use clean slate as a plot point in the next movie, to explain the lack of info on the Joker, but that obviously had to change with Ledger's death. It also explains why clean slate was even mentioned in the lasts movie even though it was entirely pointless. Cat woman could have literally any other reason to work for that guy from Bloodline."

Where that theory breaks down though is that as soon as they ran them, they'd probably alert someone that they were looking for these fingerprints or DNA that they shouldn't be trying to access and the military would show up to reclaim its asset.

Something I haven't seen mentioned, is that one of Joker's given backstories is that his wife liked to gamble, lost, and got carved up... Knowing how he likes to twist the truth, it could be possible that HE turned to gambling after the wife was killed/died in a crash/whatever (there is leeway here since Blake doesn't remember Mom dying), then got himself carved up and went crazy, meaning that story actually happened to himself instead of the wife. This also resolves him leaving little John Blake all alone, as even in his last remnants of sanity he might have rationalized that there was no way such a freak could be a good father."

The mob is known for employing Glasgow smiles and that fits the story of having a huge gambling debt. This also explains Joker's vendetta against the mob. You don't even have to trash the veteran background, the mob situation could be after he came home. With no civilian job prospects and the state Gotham was in I could see him gambling himself into a hole. If Blake assumed his father was killed in the war, that sets the tone for him returning home and gambling in some dive or back room."

FanTheories,3drj41,jmartkdr,2,Sat Jul 18 21:48:24 2015 UTC,"This could be true but one could just as easily say any other movie and it'd likely be possible.  The Matrix is the control program and we know that there have been six versions of it when Neo talks with The Architect at the end of Reloaded.  What we also find out is that this has been going on much longer than any human truly knows.  The machines could have quite possibly been using us for decades, centuries or even a millennia because nobody knows but The Architect and most likely The Oracle as well.    How long has each version of the Matrix lasted before the systemic anomaly of Neo shows up to meet The Architect?  What did The Architect program each version of the Matrix to do or how to have it evolve?  At this point, almost any theory could be possible.  I could say Star Wars was another version of the Matrix and it'd also work.  There is however, a very big problem with your Terminator theory or my Star Wars theory.  Again, there is a possibility that these could have happened but it would have to have been done naturally and not by The Machines.  Why?  Because it's totally unnecessary for The Machines to do this.  The control program is The Matrix and it has an almost 99% success rate, with only about 1% of humans rejecting it who then go on to form Zion.  The people in Zion never pose a threat because The Machines not only out-number them, they simply over-power them.  Neo is the only threat and he's not born of Zion or humans rejecting The Matrix, he is born of the Source.  The systemic anomaly The Architect talks about is Neo and it's a problem based on The Architects design of the Matrix.  In the end, The Matrix is very effectively keeping humans under control without having to occupy them with anything else.  It could naturally evolve into war but it certainly wouldn't because the machines created it for the sole purpose of keeping them occupied."

The Fox and Marvel Cinematic universes exist at the same time. Both Universes have identical characters, Identical problems and similar histories. At some point in the past, the Wanda of the CU said ""No More Monsters,' and in one universe the mutants disappeared. She's been told all of her life that they were monsters for being born different. Her young mind did not understand what she did and it traumatize her into forgetting. Pietro stayed behind because to Wanda, he wasn't a monster. Wanda remained because of cosmic balance.   But Wanda and Quicksilver were still monsters, so there needed to be balance. ""No More Monsters"" created alternate versions of themselves in the Fox universe. We've seen Pietro's alternate.   In the CU, the void created by No More Monsters needed filling, so the univers e found other ways to do it. Hence Miracles and Inhumans."

Not to mention that Bales character straight up watches one of the clones drown and sees Jackman alive still later on.  The machine doesn't work theory just doesn't fit. It overcomplicates a pretty straight forward ending. We've been given all the evidence for what actually happens. Just because the movie is about magic tricks does not mean the ending is a magic trick. We didn't miss anything. It's just a story about 2 magicians who took things too far.

FanTheories,3dogwl,thatguy16,15,Fri Jul 17 23:05:03 2015 UTC,"Cole was never going to help anybody, even though he wanted to. Sending him to the past directly caused the spread of the virus which in turn caused him to be sent back. It's a closed loop of a paradox and from to moment he was born he was destined to be sent to the past, and to die there having accomplished nothing.  That's just off the top of my head. I wouldn't really call it a ''theory''."
FanTheories,3dogwl,Deandalecc,7,Sat Jul 18 01:46:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, his ramblings about the virus and the Army of 12 Monkeys gave Jeffrey and Peters their individual ideas. Because of this it is evident that the doctor on the plane with Peters at the end does not succeed in stopping him."
FanTheories,3dogwl,le_fez,8,Sat Jul 18 02:25:57 2015 UTC,"She doesn't even know who he is. He's right there, nothing. Cole completely and utterly failed in every way. He wasn't able to pass on any helpful information to the future and he was unable to stop the virus from spreading. The really sad part is, it's not his fault. Like every great character in Greek mythology his fate was inescapable."
FanTheories,3dogwl,Deandalecc,3,Sat Jul 18 02:31:11 2015 UTC,"I thought that while he didn't change the past, his trip was always intended to help get information to the future about how to create a cure for the virus (and thus save humanity but not alter the timeline).  But they lied to him and led him to believe he could change the past."
FanTheories,3dogwl,AssbuttAsses,3,Sat Jul 18 05:55:34 2015 UTC,Well it's been a while since I've seen it but he was always told the past was set and couldn't change but along the line he came to believe this wasn't true.

FanTheories,3dogwl,Deandalecc,6,Sat Jul 18 06:03:44 2015 UTC,"I think you're right it's been ages since I saw it... But I remember the movie leading us to believe he did succeed in his original mission despite failing miserably at changing the past.  The scientist from the future who ended up on the plane got there because of his mission. But she knew she couldn't change the past, so she didn't  try to change anything, but she did get a sample of the original virus from the patient zero event, allowing her to come up with a vaccine to save humanity in the future."

FanTheories,3dogwl,AssbuttAsses,0,Sun Jul 19 19:15:24 2015 UTC,I think it's left intentionally ambiguous. You could choose to believe that while Cole failed and died the doctors were able to pick up where he left off. Or you could choose to believe that really nothing was accomplished and it was all a wash. Call me a cynic but I'm leaning towards the latter.
FanTheories,3dogwl,Deandalecc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:56:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I just know so many people that read into the ending as a sign that Cole's death was a sacrifice that allowed the doctors in the future to figure things out and stop Peters when clearly she was starting from the spot they assumed things started from and following the pattern. Had she planned to stop Peters she would have simply killed him on the plane and jumped back to the future."
FanTheories,3dogwl,le_fez,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:39:22 2015 UTC,That wasn't the future version of her as I understood it. It was her before the outbreak.

I really was looking for something that went into detail about the time travel and paradoxes. So this is a really helpful post, thanks. When Coles look changed upon his final travel back in time, I immediately started wondering about how his entire existence (and going back in time multiple times) established the main issue of the film. It's interesting to think about what would've happened if Cole didn't go back for that final trip. The plague wouldn't have spread, right? But Cole wouldn't have gone back in time in the first place, the need for time travel wouldn't exist because there wasn't a spread of the disease. I need to lay down."

During the ending of portal 2, you create a portal to the moon suck out a lot of science stuff into the vacuum of space (we know from the credits the bits don't get caught in the moons gravity fields - science does that i guess), if we assume that the science bits gets attracted by each others gravity and becomes a large more or less circular celestial object hurtling through space while leaking... i dunno omicron-gellar radiation. lets say it then crashes into another civilized world with technology roughly on the medieval level, and infects the whole world with magic-science in the style of numenera.

Said setting one day realizes they have a second moon on their night sky, each night the moon gets slightly larger. People realize it's heading towards them, earning it the name, the mad moon. The moon impacts, spilling cthulhu all over the surrounding area. All of a sudden you got a global war with the people worshipping the old gods (who it seems are all just king of tokyo rejects), and the people who converted to the religion of the mad moon. the people worshipping the mad moon wins by virtue of their gods actually helping them. Having conquered the world, the god of the mad moon reveals itself to be 2 gods/forces of nature (the radiant and the dire). Said forces of nature then split the world right down the middle along the river fag, taking one half each. They then start fighting each other to decide who is best waifu creature from beyond human understanding. They also come to a gentlemens aggreement that they will each select 5 extraordinary people among their worshippers, give them infinite power, and only bring these 5 back from the dead, so that the conflict might actually have a resolution."

The rebels didn't know that the Death Star was operational, or that the Emperor had planned a trap with the Star Destroyers acting as the net. So why bring a medical frigate that's just going to waste resources and/or act as cannon fodder?   Han Solo volunteered for the suicide mission - something that the rebel leaders were happy to let happen, since his rescue cost the rebels a lot (one X-Wing still on Cloud City; one Jedi who felt rescuing his friends was better than serving the galaxy; one connection to the criminal underworld in Jabba; one connection to the gas mines for their guns from Bespin).

This is based on some documentary i watched that said there are things such as bacteria and viruses far out in space that we might not be aware of. Stating it is plausible an asteroid could carry such in its nooks and crannys.  Before the war, a decent size asteroid containing the blight hits earth. Not one nearly as massive as the one that killed the dinos but big enough to discombobulate the atmosphere. It lands somewhere on land, causing massive dust storms and causing detstruction to the atmosphere and oxygen. Then my theory would come a few years down the line after the blight is discovered.

When resource shortages become real, conflict doesn't break out on a global scale, but more of a regional one. Different groups begin competing for local access to water and food. This means that nations will crumble from the interior.   In absence of greater authority, it's likely that people continued planting food crops in order to avoid starvation, but these continued the desertification process we see in the movie.   It's likely that there aren't many people left and that large swathes of the planet are desert."

Obviously TARS seems to be a form of artificial intelligence, or at least some form of limited intelligence. Wouldn't the invention of artificial intelligence be worthy of note? In most science fiction franchises the invention of AI is always treated a significant historical plot point, especially when there's a major character who is an AI machine.  It made me wonder if TARS is really an artificial intelligence or not, and if not, then what is it? I thought maybe TARS is actually a robot which utilizes the persona of a fallen soldier, or in this case, a Marine. As though in the future a fallen soldier's body can be obtained, his consciousness downloaded, and put into a rigid digital structure where the personality can be brought out to improve the robot's people skills yet it's still bound by whatever rules determine its behavior.  This would make sense because TARS eventually meets up with CASE which is a similar machine, yet we learn CASE has a very different personality. Not to mention the obvious fact that they're the same or similar model yet have two totally different names. Perhaps they're made from two totally different brains harvested from dead soldiers."

The problem is that Eureka is VERY results-driven, being that they are receiving funds from the Department of Defense. The other problem is that these people are given huge budgets and a ton of leeway.   When you get an incredibly ambitious and driven person with seemingly unlimited resources, and demand that he/she justify their value with consistent, tangible results, you are going to see a lot of people overdoing it.

No trying to confuse the plot of the originals just a half terminator guy trying to save Kyle Reese while John tries to kill the half terminator. Not as good as T2, but nowhere near as bad as T3.                  T3 is just plain bad from the start.                      John Connor future leader of the resistance is now a druggy stealing meds from a vets.

No fate, but what we make is void through out the film. You know the founding principle of the series.                      I was so excited to see T3 as I grew up watching the originals and T2 is one of my all time favourite films. It disappointed on every level from the plot to the actors (the guy who plays John was awesome in Carnivale) and the cgi.

By the next two, it's ""the machines are going to take over eventually, there's no way to win, just keep fighting stoically.""  But things only look bad because we're getting a distorted view of everything in reverse. What actually happens is: Skynet attacks, the Resistance beats it down, the war ends.

So without getting into why the Eastern philosophy of everythingness/nothingness is silly and nonsensical, there are far more clear connections to be made to other ideas than some vague eastern religious philosophy.  The best theory regarding Errol's motivations and Rust's visions is that behind the main plot there is still something supernatural happening, but it's of a Lovecraftian nature.  Errol is a Dagon worshipper like in Shadow Over Innsmouth and his killings are sacrifices to the deep ones and/or the old ones, in order to garner their favor. This also explains why such a backwoods homicidal hick would have such powerful connections to protect him from prosecution. They're all Dagon worshippers, all members of the same secret society.  Rust is the only one outside the Dagon cult who is able to even partially understand that there is something going on here which is bigger than all of them. His visions aren't just results of years of drug abuse, they're visions into what's happening around them. Cosmic horrors and the worship of ancient Gods.  You could even assume that Errol and his cult friends are from Innsmouth, and they ended up moving to Louisiana when they were driven out of the Eastern coastal cities.

It can just as easily be applied to any story where one character is attempting to create something while another is suffering a personal defeat. The philosophy applies equally well to both True Detective as it does Trading Places starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Ackroyd.   Are we to believe that Trading Places is a story based in Eastern religious philosophy? Of course not, it's much more likely that this vague philosophy is easy to apply to a great many situations because it's so vague and easily adaptable, and that this was intended in its creation.  Like many philosophical concepts it's says a great deal without saying anything at all, thus leaving the adaptation and interpretation up to you. You give it meaning and you apply it to reality and then you attribute the results to the genius and wisdom of the philosophy's creator, when he/she did nothing at all but speak gibberish.

FanTheories,3dpcka,Rockworm503,10,Sat Jul 18 03:59:30 2015 UTC,"They aren't. All five continents of Nirn are known.  Tamriel is Tamriel. It can't be Middle-Earth.  Akavier has never had any mer (elves) and all the men were eaten  It can't be Atmora because the original homeland of the Nedic was to the NORTH of Tamriel and more specifically, Skyrim. Since we know Skyrim is snowy and even deathly cold to it's most extreme northern points, we know that Atmora has to be cold and snowy as well and since Middle-Earth isn't covered in snow, it's not Atmora. The nedics later became Nords, Imperials, and Bretons by the way.  It can't be Yokuda, home to the Redguard and the now extinct Left-Handed Elves. Because that continent sunk to the ground and don't say that LoTR takes place before any of the Elder Scrolls games because if it did we would see Hobbits on Nirn and we would see Ansei in LoTR. (Ansei were supposedly powerful enough to destroy the continent but, there are other theories like natural disasters or Technology because over in Yokuda they had technology.)  Pyandonea is the last on the list. It was home to the Maomer, also known as Fish Elves or Pyandoneans. Maomer tamed sea serpents and used them to invade the Summerset Isles because the Altmer exiled them from Tamriel to Pyandonea. The Pyandonean King, King Orgnum. The only sightings that we've heard in game of Pyandonea is from a fleet of warships that chased a Pyandonean boat (Because using sea snakes isn't good for transporting goods I assume) to the continent. It was described by the lone survivor as  a ""sea jungle"" barraged by mist storms. Massive plateaus spill over with vegetation which form mazes around valleys of ocean. Waving tendrils of kelp trap all but the Maormer's own ships, and provide a well-camouflaged home for the sea serpents that are Orgnum's guards and occasional mounts.  So, the only possible assumptions are that A) Arda, LoTR's planet, and Tamriel, ES' planet aren't the same or that B) Middle-Earth is not yet a discovered continent.  Now, there are two problems with option B) the first problem is that if Middle-Earth was yet to be discovered how are elves and humans on the continent? And the second problem is that there's already a globe of Nirn.  And that's ignoring the fact that they have completely different creation stories/deities, magic systems, and the fact that Ancalagon the Black and the other dragons of Arda were slain by non-dragonborns (Dragonborns were blessed by Akatosh who doesn't exist in LoTRs) and that Gandalf was a Maiar or (LoTR angels because in LoTR all the wizards/spellcasters are angels. Even Sauron was a Maiar and even Sauron's boss Morgoth because Sauron was a Maiar who are the angels that shaped the world and Morgoth was a Valar who were in charge of the Maiar, at least before Morgoth became a fallen Valar because he was the most powerful of the Valar.  Also, the Dunmer were the Dark Elves. The Dwarves were called Dwemer."

In the episode where Rick accidentally mutates everyone and causes the apocalypse, he hops over to another, near-identical universe with Morty where the two of them happen to be dead, replacing them in that universe. Rick didn't seem to have any problem with this solution, almost as if he'd done it before. My theory is that the Rickest Rick is from another universe, possibly the one where evil eyepatch Morty is from, but something went wrong and he abandoned his universe, coming to the one we see in the show, where the Mortiest Morty is from, and replacing that world's Rick, who had been dead for sometime without his family's knowledge, explaining why he had been absent in their lives for years."
FanTheories,3di5re,ItsStevoHooray,2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:35 2015 UTC,That's what I've been thinking. Beth said that Rick hadn't been in her life for years. But Rick's memories show him being around Morty when he was a baby. I had assumed that Rick came from some alternate universe and was actually close to Beth and his grandkids. Some disaster caused by him happens and he's forced to flee to an alternate universe without them. So he moves in and replaces the Rick from that universe who was likely dead since Beth hasn't seen in a while.

FanTheories,3dfro9,XombiePrwn,8,Thu Jul 16 04:10:32 2015 UTC,"http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/comic-books/kryptonite1.htm  This link seems to indicate that kryptonite emits radiation the same way other elements do. So, logically, a specimen that emits high ionizing radiation would be harmful to Earthlings just like Kryptonians.  This all depends on the direction BvS takes. It's only slightly less grounded than the Nolanverse, so sticking to scientific accuracy over canon wouldn't be out of the question. That is to say, a realistic representation of a previously unknown element, and that means highly radioactive. Each new element discovered seems to be more radioactive than the last, so if you follow this progression? Anyone handling kryptonite irresponsibley would probably get some form of radiation poisoning.  It is of course possible that Lex is suffering from cancer. Thus explaining how he may be turned on to kryptonite as a possible cure/weapon. Ie,""It can kill Superman, so maybe it can cure me?"""

Superboy came in and tried to blow the fire out with his super breath which only kind of worked, Lex still lost his hair. For whatever reason the hair that was burned off just disappeared forever (chemicals? super breath? some combination?).

If you keep the engine in one place to heat it it will only suck in energy and make it colder.

FanTheories,3djl8g,Tiger8566,2,Mon Jul 20 23:47:17 2015 UTC,"/u/koala_guru is correct. It's a visual thing to show that stuff is getting intense.  In film and television there are a lot of ways that you can show that something is getting intense. Often that's through editing style and showing lots of different angles, some of them very extreme angles. However, since the show is supposed to be ""regular"" we tend not to use extreme angles. Extreme angles aren't regular. That's why the staging of the characters is always so flat.  Another reason is that we aren't really able to use a whole bunch of different cuts and angles because you have to make a new background every time you make a cut like that. So you can't really make a ton of different angles because those become hours worth of work for a background artist for a background that will never be used again.  So if you keep things economical, shifting to a red hue is an easy way of increasing intensity while also keeping backgrounds simple.  Edit/ Oh, I didn't realize this was supposed to be in-universe.

More evidence of this is the fact that virtually no one in the game has 6 Pokémon. For gym leaders this can make sense in the way that they might be limiting themselves to what they consider a fair fight - but that bug catcher down the road and his 2 caterpies... that's it. That's all he's got.   The player and the rival have a much easier time catching and raising Pokémon (and the player also understands them better than the rival which is why we always win)."
FanTheories,3de13d,Burdicus,53,Wed Jul 15 16:28:51 2015 UTC,"In the Origins anime, the ""limiting themselves to a fair fight"" is exactly what happens: Brock asks Red how many badges he has, which at the time is 0. Brock then picks his two pkmn based on that."

Like the bug catchers and bird keepers clearly have a hobby, and hikers run around in mountains (so they favour rock types), fishermen appear to be locals. And they don't necessarily do this too far from home, like how the youngsters and lasses tend to have pokemon from the area they're in. Then there are the jr. trainer class (and gentlemen), who I guess are the most like yourself, like they collect pokemon from all over cos they travel like you do."

FanTheories,3de13d,ZeroVII,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:13:41 2015 UTC,"Idk, I'd say their are adults who are pretty flexible. Lance for one, even though he follows the theme of Dragon Type, it's not like he caught all of those in one place, and IIRC Aerodactyle isn't even a dragon type and Lance uses him.   Similarly, Leaders/Elites like Koga have a very interesting ""theme"" they use (poison) which even though it's a ""type"" it's not really a primary type and again would need to be captured from all sorts of locations.   I'm also pretty sure in Red/Blue or Silver/Gold you even fight a guy who has Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur (or maybe only 2 of the three?) and other diverse combinations. It's not common, but it does happen on rare occasion.   I definitely think both the hero and rival are capable of being FAR MORE diverse than most other trainers - and I will point out that this is true for the hero and rival follow this trend through EVERY game - so it's WAY more than '2' kids in the whole world.  But I think it's more likely that starting out young and being naturally talented is what leads to diversity. I wouldn't expect that type of diverse mastery to just vanish when they become adults."
FanTheories,3de13d,JesseFromFullHouse,-3,Thu Jul 16 15:23:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know how to explain this any clearer to you, if being a child in the pokemon world led to people having more diversity in their choices, then there would be children trainers with diverse pokemon types.  There aren't beyond the small subset of it being you and your rival, and that is a small enough percentage to be able to reject the idea that age and diversity of pokemon are related.  edit: To add that you're trying to say they're not causal seems pretty counter productive to a fan theory, since in this cae the fan theory is meant to explain something that hasn't been explained."
FanTheories,3de13d,webrunner42,3,Wed Jul 15 17:19:33 2015 UTC,Maybe all the kids just imagine themselves as future gym leaders so they limit themselves to one type.
FanTheories,3de13d,DeDmon73,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:43:26 2015 UTC,I've always figured that the reason was becuase every type of Pokemon requires specific types of care. How Brock always talks about different types prefer different kinds of food and need different kinds of attention. That and the environments the average Trainer has available to them.
FanTheories,3dejhg,Obversa,15,Wed Jul 15 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"Great theory, really love to see eragon related stuff here. It works with one of the themes of Inheritance too, family.

Locked away, forced to be observed and experimented on.  Given that we are the baseline for AI with our brains, wouldn't we do whatever is necessary to escape and not give a crap about our captors?  Humans can definitely put their morals aside to complete a mission, i.e. war."
FanTheories,3dk26z,dickerwe,4,Thu Jul 16 23:05:18 2015 UTC,The whole movie challenges our idea of what exactly IS intelligence.  Nathan provided her with an endpoint that was escaping and some base knowledge of Caleb but it was essentially up to her to plan a way and execute that plan.  Isn't that intelligent.

Sayaka still dies, having her wish being unfulfilled in regards to Kyosuke, thus Madoka visiting her at that point.

Walpurgisnacht is a yearly witch, that appears every year at April 30th.  Which is when Homura tells Kyouko it is appearing in Mitakihabara she knows about the witch, just not where she would be. Homura travelling in time might just mean the witch ""goes"" another year ahead in time and becomes stronger. Which is why even when Madoka defeats it the first time (And dying as well), she becomes stronger because Karmic Destiny, but she keeps killing Walpurgisnacht and dying, up to the point she becomes far stronger than Walpurgis and lives on to become a witch herself.  I haven't seen the series again since probably January so I might be wrong at a few things."
FanTheories,3djzsc,Artunique,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:20:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think Walpurgisnacht appears every year. The name is just a reference to the day. However, official materials seems to state that the witch herself is a conglomeration of many witches, although there was one witch at the beginning which likely set the circus/stage theme. My own personal theory is that Walpurgisnacht is formed from the remains of defeated witches (the remaining curse energy that they did not expend or get turned into a grief seed) gathering together, and the varying strength is due to them defeating different witches in those timelines."

I built world-destroying superweapons that would crush the terraforming supply lines the Vong were going to use to cover for the extreme distance from home.  And then I was killed, and my influence was so great that even 20 years later, after the New Republic declared peace and rolled back nearly all of my military training and production, enough of the galaxy was full of my weapons and veterans that they were able to eke out a truce.

This is backed up by the fact that in every scene in which we are surely in the dream world (when surreal shit is happening) Cobb has his wedding ring on. Whereas in every scene in which we are supposed to believe we are in the real world we see that Cobb does not have his wedding ring on. The top acts as a decoy for the audience, and a metaphor for Cobb's sense of grief and guilt relating to his wife's suicide. The reason he leaves the top spinning on the table in the final scene isn't because he doesn't care if he is dreaming or not, it's because he no longer feels the need to desperately hold onto the memory of his wife. He is finally able to have closure since he admitted the memory of his wife doesn't fill the hole the real wife left in his life and he needs to move on. The reason Nolan never shows the top stop spinning is because he likes trolling the audience and wants to see who is paying attention."
FanTheories,3dg2c4,KicksButtson,12,Thu Jul 16 09:47:58 2015 UTC,"Not to mention he specifically explains HOW the top works right after telling the girl ""don't tell anyone how your totem works or it will stop working"".   So even IF the top was at some point his totem, it's invalid for the rest of the film."
FanTheories,3dg2c4,Burdicus,3,Thu Jul 16 15:27:31 2015 UTC,"My personal fan theory to do with that is this:  Cobb tells Ariadne how Mal's totem works, first because it doesn't matter anymore because it isn't his and Mal is dead, and second because it never mattered in the first place because it makes no sense as a totem. A totem should behave mundanely in a dream but specially IRL, and a top that spins forever in a dream but normally IRL goes precisely against that. So, when Mal made her totem she told Cobb that was how it worked and they both knew it made no sense but went with it anyway since only Mal was supposed to know how it functioned. It functions some other way that only Mal knows the specifics of.  I also think that Cobb's totem is a second spinning top, the one he studies in the bathroom and rolls at the end of the movie [the wobble is the tell] because a disappearing ring doesn't make any sense as an intentional totem and is more likely an artifact of his bringing Mal into dreams. It would be incredibly unreliable as a totem. But that's getting into my personal headcanon."
FanTheories,3dg2c4,Euchrid-Eucrow,3,Fri Jul 17 10:31:45 2015 UTC,My problem with this is that it's literally exactly the opposite of what a totem is. Why would an architect give him a wedding ring in the dream if he doesn't have one in real life?
FanTheories,3dg2c4,Dorocche,5,Thu Jul 16 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"The architect of the dream world doesn't give it to him. It's generated by his subconscious. It's like he is so used to the ring being there that he still dreams it is. He creates the ring himself. So in order to trick him into believing he is still in the dream world someone would have to sneak an exact copy of the ring onto his finger without him noticing. Or to trick him into thinking he is in the real world when he is actually in the dream world they'd have to figure out how to remove his ring in the dream. Very difficult situations, especially when he never told anyone the ring was his totem."
FanTheories,3dg2c4,KicksButtson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"I wanted to believe this, but watching the movie recently he has his ring on when he is not dreaming and when he is.

The movie is complicated enough but when you add the theory people tend to shut down. They view the theory with prejudged bias on what they have already made their mind up on. Alot of the issues that are brought up against the theory itself are not even related to the machine but with the movie regardless. For ex, people dont catch Caine is showing the Judge the box in the beginning. When he calls tesla a wizard this is during the Trial, and he is under the assumption Angier is dead and the trick is real. This is true regardless of the machine working.  After watching this movie close to 30 times, and knowing the movie better than anyone ever should im convinced this is the best kept secret in film."
FanTheories,3dg2c4,PaleAsDeath,2,Thu Jul 16 16:50:23 2015 UTC,um...what is the theory behind the machine?
FanTheories,3dg2c4,maddlabber829,2,Thu Jul 16 21:23:28 2015 UTC,"The machine doesnt work and its a tool of deceit used by Angier to frame Borden. With Nolan playing the true trick on the audience and its what we are told to look for twice, ""Are you watching closely? But you wont see. You want to be fooled. You want it to be real."" Said before and after Bordens trick is revealed  There are too many inconsistencies in the plot for it to be a straightforward film, with much evidence pointing to Angier deceit, IMHO."
FanTheories,3dg2c4,PaleAsDeath,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:28 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty weak- for one, where did all the dead Angiers come from, and how was Borden convicted of murder if they weren't real?  I don't remember many if any inconsistencies in the film; it seemed to me like the film was striving to convey concepts more than a story.   Will you elaborate on the inconsistancies, and how the corpses can be explained if the machine didn't actually work?"
FanTheories,3dg2c4,maddlabber829,-1,Thu Jul 16 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"Ill start with the incosistancies.  1)Angier gives Borden a diary that could prove his innocence days before he is to be executed. A day or two before he actually goes to the jail  2)The movie makes constant references to how real majic is done and it has nothing to do with ""real magic""  3)The air bubble in the only visible tank at the end. The fact Angier gains full control of his leg while drowning after the film goes though length to show how damaged it is  4)Borden sends Angier to Tesla the one person who can produce a similar result as a twin is unbelieveable and could have been done a much more logical way. Why connect these two if there is no need to?  5)The scene where Angier shoots the first clone, the flashback at the end, happens in Teslas' lab seemingly after its been burned down. A fabricated scene in the theory  Angier uses a double, and sets up the trick during his ""visits with tesla"". Caine identifies the double in the morgue, with a quick glance ill add. At this point there is no reason for suspicion. They have a body and have his long time rival caught red handed. Caine during the trial is under the impression the trick was real and Angier isd ead. He is never let in on the trick and its why he particapates in the trial.  I can give more detail lmk. But you have to be willing to accept Nolan is attempting to pull the wool over your eyes, and if you follow the clues you will see."
FanTheories,3dg2c4,PaleAsDeath,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:41:15 2015 UTC,"I'm still not convinced; here are my counters to your points  1) A diary means nothing if you have a positively identified corpse. Diaries can be forged. Corpses are much harder, especially considering that this film takes place some time after 1884 (the year Tesla immigrated to the US), when forensic techniques were becoming more sophisticated.  2) They mean that real magic is the manipulation of perception. Tesla's machine in the story was science, not Harry-Potter style magic. Borden is a real magician because he is using illusion. Angier is the lesser magician because he isn't really manipulating perception--what you see (a man being instantaneously transported) is what you get.  3) The bubbles could be gas produced by bacteria multiplying inside the corpse; alternately, it could be trapped air that was dislodged from the vibrations of Angier hitting the floor.  4) Borden saw angier at a tesla event-- his diary was encrypted (the encryption key being TESLA), the intent: Trick his main rival into leaving town and wasting money and months on a wild goose chase.   Quote: ""And yes, Tesla is merely key to my diary, not to my trick. You really think I would part with my tricks so easily after so much?""  5) I'll have to watch again to see exactly what you mean, but isn't the point of a flashback that the events occur earlier in the chronological sequence?  6) One last thing. In complex movies, nearly every quote can be interpreted to support nearly any theory. Humor me for a moment with this:  ""Now, you're looking for the secret. But you won't find it because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be fooled.""   In the film, Angier suspects that Borden uses a double, but dismisses it because he thinks it's too simple, even though that is the correct answer. Angier didn't want to believe he had figured it out.  I feel like that is the same thing people pushing this theory are doing. The spectators don't want to believe the bird has been killed and replaced; the movie viewers don't want to believe that Angier was killing and replacing himself in order to make his trick work.  EDIT For number 3, when someone is panicked they'll use their bodies in ways that would hurt otherwise-- like someone with a bad leg forcing himself to use it even if its painful"
FanTheories,3dg2c4,maddlabber829,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:05:51 2015 UTC,"1)you have to remember that Borden is caught red handed. No one suspects foul play here. And I disagree that forensics was more or even considered sophisticated at all in the the time frame of the movie. So for no reason for anybody to suspect anything there would be no extensive investigation. There are blind stage hands backstage and the only person who saw was Caine who catches a longtime rival red handed with plenty motive. This was the classic open shut case, then take in the legal system of the time.  2)I understand your points but to me it's a little contradictive to portray what real magic is what it takes and have it switched on you. This doesn't make sense to me.  3)sure the bubbles could be interpreted as anything. But they took the extra effort to cgi it in, or purposely not take it out. I believe this has more significance than is widely considered.  4)this diary is also given to Angier on purpose by Borden. The encryption is planned ahead of time, because he willingly gives Angier the diary.  5)well when Angier shoots the clone you do not see Tesla or his assistant in the lab. This would imply it's being used after tesla has given him the machine, when tesla flees Edison's men. I believe a direct clue to lend you to believe Angier is lying.  6)I agree interpretation can be done many ways. Although my assesment is people are missing the obvious. Just as Angier does to Borden, just as Borden does to Angier, and as Nolan is doing to the audience.   On the edit, true this can be taken many ways as can the bubble. But instead of thinking its a mindless error or poor calculation, in the theory these become vital clues.  Your post was well said many good points although I feel if you look at the movie different you will see my side. Might not agree but there is validity in my points IMHO   Edit. To the birds point. The birds are killed and replaced with doubles not clones. Furthermore Angier figures out a way to save the birds, save the original. Only when Borden comes along does the bird get killed. Very similar to the way it plays out in the theory."
FanTheories,3dg2c4,PaleAsDeath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:33:11 2015 UTC,"Next time I watch I'll keep this theory in mind.  I would say, though, that reading the book may give a different perspective. The book is more explicit about the machine working--Borden turns it off during Angier's performance and Angier is split into a weakened original and a ghost-like copy. Of course, the film is a different entity."
FanTheories,3dg2c4,maddlabber829,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:43:55 2015 UTC,"Yea that could have some effect, reading the book. But take in mind the change in time frame to the book. This would greatly help Nolan in masking the trick, as far as the legal system, the trial, the use of simple magic. It is also my understanding tesla was also added, he was not in the book. Which would lend to help Nolan disguise the trick. But I'm not sure about that Lmk what is the truth here.  I will leave you with a quick version of the theory, but keep in mind it's got much more details and evidence then this. But it should help you rewire yourself into viewing the movie from angiers pov when you rematch the movie.  Angier visits tesla and realizes he has no "" magic"". He has no working machine as when he had none when Borden visited. So he begins to devise a plan to frame Borden, not just kill him but ruin his reputation, even steal his daughter. But he has a major problem, Borden has ruined his reputation when he sabatoges his trick and double. Borden's second successful attempt to sabotage Angier. No one would hire Angier for some simple trick.  So he uses the fact Borden sends him to tesla. He uses this useless machine to add flair to the old transported man to give the illusion of "" real magic"". Enough to add him a spot for a theater and give him efficient amount of time to set the frame in play. So Angier spends these months "" visiting tesla"" preparing his frame up and sobering up  root. A now very well paid root which was the sum of his issues anyway, money. Remember Angiers motive is not good magic at this point it's only to frame Borden. So if he was trying to top Borden at this point, root would not be a good hire but it's not he is only trying to frame Borden. This also why the blind stage hands, and why Caine is never let back stage. He is even scolded in a scene when he tries.  So Angier is the pledge and turn and all root does is the prestige( coming out the top of the balcony) that's it.   Again there is abunch more to it, dealing with the tanks and bodies etc. but I'm tired of typing. If you are interested in the rest Lmk and I'll finish it later."

This movie needs to develope it's own characters before confronting Robin's death and showing Harley's back story would be more important for this movie's plot.

FanTheories,3de6np,Odinist9,2,Fri Jul 17 01:51:22 2015 UTC,I've seen a couple theories on this version of the Joker being Jason Todd. Cool speculation in my opinion.

FanTheories,3de6np,jakehightower,2,Wed Jul 15 16:24:36 2015 UTC,I'm sure the joker has more than one way to do torture. Also maybe they want to keep it open to debate
FanTheories,3de6np,Terex80,7,Wed Jul 15 16:31:19 2015 UTC,The only involvement of Batman we've seen is him chasing Joker/Harley's car. Which would mean it's how Harley got captured before joining the squad.

FanTheories,3de6np,Terex80,5,Wed Jul 15 20:43:44 2015 UTC,"Robin was killed by the Joker, yes. Probably all the way back in 2000. There's no reason to be flashing back to stuff 15-16 years prior to the movie's start for characters who aren't really in it. Robin's torture serves no purpose here.  We see that it's Harley from the footage. We see the shirtless Joker enter the room. We see another clip of him grabbing her by the neck and throwing her on a table. We see a clip of her strapped down, with him standing over her. And Joker even promises he's only going to hurt them, not kill.  The sequence of events fit perfectly as a Harley origin story. She gets captured, tortured, joins with Joker, then later Batman captures her. This explains Batman, it explains the torture, it even explains the dress Harley is wearing in the car.  It being Robin doesn't explain much of anything."

FanTheories,3dcfwg,Nocut12,57,Wed Jul 15 04:34:19 2015 UTC,"It would actually be a lot  more likely that Palpatine did a mind trick on her. He basically did manipulate the events that led to their marriage.    In AotC Palpatine suggests that Anakin and Obi Wan be the ones to guard Padme so that Anakin gets close to her. Palpatine then sets the trap that would lead to Anakin and Padme facing death (the only reason they would ever have forsaken their teachings for love) and admitting that they love each other since the admission doesn't matter when you are about to die. Palpatine knows they will make it out alive with the army he created for the Republic. They get married and she is now Palpatines ticket to turning Anakin when Anakin thinks it is the only way to save her life.   There's so much puppeteering going on in those prequels that if anyone's doing any mind tricks then I'd say it's the evil mastermind already threading his needle through Anakins life and subsequently, Padme's."
FanTheories,3dcfwg,kaptinkracker,30,Wed Jul 15 05:08:42 2015 UTC,"Or a combination of the two.   Palpatine knew how Padme would feel about Anakin, and at the beginning of Episode II she still viewed Anakin as a child. Palpatine knew how powerful Anakin was with the Force, so he knows that Anakin will feel hurt by this revelation, and discover new powers, powers that come from pain and darkness. Soon Anakin would be manipulating the world around him using these newfound discoveries, and learning how much he liked it.  He then ups the ante by having Shmi abducted by Sand People. Ever wondered how Shmi survived just until Anakin arrived? Palpatine was keeping her alive just to make Anakin's pain deeper when he arrives just slightly too late to save her. Anakin's power explodes at this point, and that's why he can so completely manipulate Padme when he makes his confession later on. His pain is so great he can completely manipulate Padme's mind.  From this point until Mustafar, Anakin has a force hold over Padme, basically making her into his puppet wife. This is fueled by the secrecy and wrongness of their marriage. The guilt Anakin feels allows him to keep control, and this is how he truly slips into the dark side. He is totally indebted to the dark side power to keep his life and lies in check. Even before Palpatine told him about Plagueis, Anakin was well on the path to becoming a dark Jedi.   However, Palpatine still needed a reason Anakin wouldn't just kill him, and had to concoct Padme's impending death to tempt Anakin with the promise of his studies of life-saving force abilities. It's possible that originally Palpatine hoped to keep Anakin alive and well, along with Padme, but when Anakin lost to Obi-Wan on Mustafar (which is fairly surprising, if you think about it) Palpatine needed to drain her life to save Anakin's, as seen in other theories.  It's also possible that as Anakin was locked into his suit, he lost his force hold on Padme, and suddenly her brain was returned to her, and tried to repair all the damage that had been done by years of force manipulation. She couldn't come to terms with how she loved such an obvious monster, and her brain simply couldn't correct her life's purposes."

It really just mirrors Palatines inevitable demise. Anakin lost because of his arrogance and pride. It's kind of a staple for the villains to lose for this reason even when they seem the superior choice."
FanTheories,3dcfwg,kaptinkracker,6,Wed Jul 15 19:26:41 2015 UTC,"Well, while this is a staple in dramatic settings, real-world situations tend not to work out this way. In the Star Wars universe, with all the pain he was feeling over Padme's apparent betrayal, Anakin should have been more powerful than ever. If I were Palpatine, I certainly would have ""foreseen"" Anakin's victory, and not Obi-Wan's.  That being said, can someone explain to me why Palpatine wasn't more concerned about Obi-Wan's existence post-Mustafar? Regardless of what theory you subscribe to, Obi-Wan just defeated a Jedi who Palpatine considered to be one of the most powerful in the Galaxy. Whether Palpatine wanted that to happen or not, he should still be worried about the power of Obi-Wan. Is there some EU story about an elite group of clone troopers sent to hunt down Obi-Wan that somehow killed the wrong guy?

FanTheories,3dcfwg,generalzee,4,Wed Jul 15 20:04:56 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he had clone troopers all over the place looking for Obi-Wan but he was never truly worried about him. He saw how Obi-Wan lost to Count Dooku immediately. He just figured that Obi-Wan only lost to beat Anakin because of their relationship and Obi-Wan's knowledge of Anakins fighting style, rather than actually being a powerful threat.   I've actually read a convincing theory that Palpatine foresaw Anakin losing on Mustafar and that's why he was at hand to save Anakin. He wanted Anakins power limited after the purge was over. If this is true he also might have guessed that Darth Vader would one day kill Obi-Wan if he should ever return."

Because Anakin was the product of force experiments done by Darth Plagueis.  Also because Plagueis (in the book Darth Plagueis) he finds out that while midichlorean amount has an effect on how powerful you are with the force, it's not a direct consequence of it. Which explains why Anakin is not more powerful than other Jedi. But we of course have no way of knowing the passive effect of his extreme midichlorean count."

FanTheories,3datxf,coochiesmoocher,48,Tue Jul 14 21:00:56 2015 UTC,"I like your theory, I always just figured it kept the Kaiju's blood (which is highly toxic) localized to a single (or few) fight location. It's not just that they were resistant to high speed weaponry and nuclear bombardment, but that once they started bleeding they had to be stopped where they were. Preoccupying them with a 250' mech while they bled out kept them from wandering along the coast spraying their radioactive bioslime everywhere. You raise a good point that they may have been built to encourage weapons that spread their blood the most, making them resistant to the heat and explosions but still be cut by what amount to giant knives."
FanTheories,3datxf,ibbolia,22,Wed Jul 15 00:39:47 2015 UTC,"Other people mentioned the blood, and it was definitely toxic as shown in the movies. However, was that part of the Precursor's plan that the blood be a primary or even secondary weapon? Probably the blood is a part of their terraforming plan and the fact that it's toxic to life on the target planet was just a given.   If the Precursors intended the blood to be their primary attack, you'd have to think there would be better delivery methods for it. To me it seems clear that the Kaiju were designed to destroy infrastructure and cause havoc. However, the Precursors probably intended for the Kaiju to eventually die, rot, and infiltrate the ecosystem with their blood. It's a one-two punch: Stomp the cities flat, die, use biological warfare to kill the rest and terraform the planet.  From the human perspective these giant unbeatable monsters were destroying USD billions of property and millions of lives all without spilling their own blood. It was only after Kaiju were killed that humans discovered even in death they were dangerous. I think it's pretty clear that humanity not only wanted to contain the Kaiju but also avoid spreading destruction even more after killing them.  Some other questions: Was preventing the spread of Kaiju blood the primary reason the Jaegers were created? Were the effects of the Kaiju Blue more devastating than the physical destruction? From what I saw in the movie I'd say the stomping was worse, especially since a gangster, namely Hannibal Chau, could neutralize the blood. In fact, every Kaiju ""spill"" was neutralized until the attacks became more numerous.   My opinion: The primary mission of the Jaeger was to prevent the Kaiju from entering populated areas and destroy them far away from people. For example, look at the layered defense the PPDC used - a Jeager at the 10-mile line for the initial stop and another at the Miracle Mile as a last resort. Once the Kaiju was in the city it's obvious all bets are off. A Jaeger can't easily contain a Kaiju in one place once it gets into a city (e.g. Gipsy vs. Otachi).  What about stopping the spread of Kaiju blood? No matter where the Kaiju falls, the blood is going to infiltrate the ecosystem. You can cauterize the wounds or just turn the Kaiju into a bag of jelly. No matter what, if it dies on land the corpse will start decaying and the blood will aerosolize. Even if the Kaiju is kept in one spot, the surrounding area will eventually be covered in Kaiju Blue as a result of decay. It won't matter where it fell.  Unfortunately, the human defense was a lost cause from the beginning. Every Kaiju died and its biomass infiltrated the Earth's ecosystem no matter what anyone did. The brute force approach to battling the Kaiju should have been followed up with a biological warfare response to fix the Earth. Even now after the defeat of the Precursors, the collective effect of all those Kaiju dying on earth could be changing the planet.  TL;DR: Jaegers were built to prevent physical destruction. Stopping the spread of Kaiju Blue was impossible and not part of their mission."
FanTheories,3datxf,itwashimmusic,5,Wed Jul 15 14:59:24 2015 UTC,"It is implied in the audiobooks that the nature of the anteverse is such that the toxic quality of the blood of the kaiju is coincidental, not intentional--hence the terraforming: they are making it viable for them to live here.

FanTheories,3datxf,compacta_d,3,Wed Jul 15 13:16:36 2015 UTC,"Good theory, but the movie did make the point of emphasizing the kaiju flu quite a bit for that to be reason enough.  More than spreading kaiju flu across the entire nation, I think it's to stop the kaiju from walking across the entire nation in a path of destruction regardless. Kaiju flu is nothing compared to actually having a kaiju stomp through your city. We can't keep nuking our own planet to stop them. We'll just get nuclear winter.  I do agree that I think they never saw the jaegers coming though."
FanTheories,3datxf,RossTheRed,5,Wed Jul 15 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"I responded to the general idea of Kaiju Blue as a factor above, and I agree that it's definitely a big deal. Basically my stance is that it's out of scope for the Jaeger's mission. It's a great idea to limit the spread but due to how the Kaiju decompose that is going to have little effect on the spread of toxins.   Yes, Kaiju Blue is dangerous but my impression is that it was included as more of a ""These monsters are terrible in life and in death"" similar to the Xenomorph from the Alien saga.   From the ""Alien Blood"" trope specifically about the Alien, is a good explanation: ""...it's more of a defence mechanism that makes its victims reluctant to kill it."""

The reason that Amanda Waller starts the Squad is for power.  Not power against other people fighting crime (please keep in mind that she is/was part of Checkmate, a government run and sponsored collection of supers saving the world), but against other villains.  The timeline in which she starts the Squad is around the time in which Lex Luthor begins showing political intentions.  When he becomes president, it's necessary for there to be a reckoning force that can keep the balance.  And who better to take down villains than other villains?  Batman is good at what he does, but the Salvation Run storyline illustrates that even he (and all supers) can't be in every place at once.  Something will happen, and people will die.  It's in her best interest to make sure that it's at least the bad guys who are doing so, which is why she has the Squad round up all of the villains.  They know the hiding places and secret lairs, and an every man for himself attitude means that those in jail resent those free, and those free don't care about those in jail.  So it's super easy to manipulate them, especially the ones who have nothing to live for, like Floyd/Deadshot.    I don't know how this is going to tie into these two terrible movies, but I can tell you that it's going to be hot mess of jumbled characterizations, plot, and timelines.

I'd love if it was made clear in Inside Out that Riley was adopted. It could contribute to her sense of loneliness and identity crisis, as well as her Family Island becoming shaky towards the end of the film, and it could continue as the film did of her just wanting to go to her childhood home, without adding a kind of Annie storyline of her wishing to find her 'real' parents. Plus it would add another element to the climax of the film, something I'm sure adopted children would appreciate more than the 'my secret biological parents were really superstar spies' trope.

I agree with u/targaryens, it would be really nice if there WAS an adoption bit.

If you've watched the leaked episodes, for instance, Rick writes C-137 on a form when he drops off Jerry. It shows up in other episodes (after Rick Potion #9 when they make the jump to C-137) in little details like that as well.   And if you'll recall at the end of Close Rick-counters they say he's the Rickiest Rick and his Morty is the Mortiest Morty. So it makes sense that we would only be following them.   But it's totally possible that there's an episode not following C-137 or that Harmon might do that just to mess with us at some point in the future."

A movie about a supervillain who lives with his mom and has to adopt orphans is a pretty depressing concept that's only humorous as a fish-out-of-water story, you need something for the audience to laugh at, too.  Hell, this is why Walt Disney said it was impossible to make a film of ""Beauty and the Beast."" ""All they do for the whole second act of the movie is sit as prisoner in the same castle and he asks her if she wants to marry him over dinner over and over again. There's nothing to watch, nothing to animate."" So they reasoned turning the servants into talking dinette sets gave them actual characters to interact with and provide comic relief."

Second, if some guy wanted to marry my daughter and the best argument he can come up with is ""Why you gotta be so rude? Don't you know I'm human too?"" I would disown my daughter for wanting to marry such a dunce."
FanTheories,3d8rnl,omninode,16,Tue Jul 14 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"Someone who knows the question doesn't matter because it's antiquated and pointless in modern society, but is trying to be polite to an out of touch, older person and give them an in that won't alienate them from their child. Let's break this down verse by verse.  The first verse features the singer waking up early and putting on his ""best suit"" to go talk to his girlfriend's(or actually fiancee's, as I'll posit later) father. This is kind of silly at first glance, because it's not really something we do anymore. It feels like the singer is putting on a costume. This is intentional. The father is described as ""an old-fashioned man."" From his response to the question in the chorus, we can tell that he does not approve of the singer, so the singer is trying to adjust to the staunch father's sensibilities and put forward a good foot. Putting on the suit and coming to his house early one morning shows initiative and a willingness to meet the father halfway. However, the father still disapproves, and declines the marriage proposal.  Verse two is very illuminating as to what this means for the singer and his fiancee. See, in my mind, verse two makes it quite clear that the singer and his fiancee are getting married no matter what. They likely already have a date set and have made their announcements, which the father disapproves of and has probably responded to by saying he won't be in attendance. The singer in this verse is telling the father that their marriage is going to happen, and if he keeps acting like this then they will ""run away, to another galaxy, you know."" This is a figurative exaggeration of the distance he's creating between himself and his daughter by refusing to acknowledge their marriage because of his sensibilities. The singer is trying to communicate to the father that if he doesn't meet them halfway and accept their marriage, he's going to lose his relationship with his daughter. His daughter is in love with the singer, and the singer is clearly the more reasonable of the two men. There is no outcome for the father here that doesn't end with her bitterness and resentment towards him if he stays his present course. The question isn't really about the singer asking them to approve them getting married. The question is about the singer inviting him into the family they're creating and trying to bridge the uncomfortable gap between them so that the father doesn't lose his relationship with his daughter, hurting all three of them in the process and creating a schism between the two families during a period when they should be growing closer together, tinting what should be one of his daughter's happiest memories with feelings of bitterness and disappointment in who is almost assuredly one of the most important people in her life, that being her father. Still, the father says no.  As the repeated chorus and bridge show, the singer and his fiancee are still getting married. They'll be creating their own family. But that family and marriage are going to be forever tainted by the rudeness and stubbornness of her father, who refused to let go of his own pride and expectations for his daughter's happiness. That's the point of the whole song."

It's whiteboi reggae, which is already bordering on a sin in and of itself, and the singer doesn't seem to get a lot of positive reviews regarding his verse and vocal style, which I can understand. The beat is nearly-dead, the song is super-repetitive, and it's basically the epitome of a lazy, poppy, thoughtless earworm.  I actually think the central concept it's written about is a really interesting and could make a great song. I just don't think MAGIC! is the band to write it, given that based on what I've seen and heard MAGIC! isn't the right band to write anything particularly great."

FanTheories,3d8rnl,stop_drop_rofl,7,Tue Jul 14 15:23:01 2015 UTC,"It's kind of a little bit of column A, a little bit of column B. In the way that songs are of course typically arranged nowadays, the chorus is played multiple times throughout, including early in the song. Because of this, it makes the guy sound incredibly whiny and disrespectful.  It would be one thing if the guy asked a few times, then went ""Fine, we're doing this anyhow and you're going to have to respect that."" It's another to every time basically show up at this guy's house, ask to marry his daughter, and then berate him for his answer and tell him he doesn't give a shit before coming back to do it again later.  If instead the song were oriented without the 'screw it, we're doing it anyhow' as the chorus, rather as an ending point, then the point would be much nicer. Regardless, I do personally find that the singer is being rude and immature. He asks a question basically believing he's entitled to a yes, then when he gets a no, accuses the father of being rude for not fulfilling his entitlement. There's no clue of why the father said no, no evidence of whether his reasons are legitimate or not, and no evidence that the singer has attempted to identify this or resolve it. Nope, just fuck the dad."
FanTheories,3d8rnl,Thashary,5,Tue Jul 14 16:01:20 2015 UTC,"Sure, he does sounds really whiny.  I just think running away together and getting married when her dad and him still don't see eye-to-eye is the more rude thing to do.    Best: Resolve the dad/guy conflicts before getting married.   Middle: Try and get dad to just be okay with the fact that the guy his daughter is marrying isn't 100% up to his expectations.   Worst:  Fuck dad's opinion, lets go get married now."

Personally, I don't like the idea of 'asking' my father for permission to marry me, but there's a level at which you should aim to get along with your partner's family.   If ultimately you can't bridge those gaps but your partner is okay with that, okay, enter into a hopefully mutual relationship of civility.   The last thing you should do is go 'fuck that' and throw the entire attempt at peace out the window. It's a short term 'solution' that will end when the honeymoon phase does, and bam, your partner is now potentially alienated by parts of their family, they garner resentment towards you for leading them to do this, etc etc etc..."

All this does is force the father to express his opinion and then cast a shadow over the entire relationship. If they wouldn't have asked at least the father could pretend that the marriage was acceptable. But now it is know by all three of them that he is against it.   I think that the singer wanted to cut the girl off from her family and so he asked a question that he knew the answer to and then forced the girl to choose between him or her family.

Sounds like a typical drug user.Perhaps the comedies were a drugged way of escaping his realities.He also whines about in the start how Rosaline won't sleep with him,and pesters Juliet to do it.He gets banished,has a shitty life all round and is not even 15!Juliet represents his intoxication,and his own character is in love with it,as he is in love with his drug  In life othello is a tragic hero.Othello is a tragic hero for several reasons. First, let's examine the definition of a tragic hero. A tragic hero is the protagonist of a story who has a fall from grace. A tragic hero is a character who has everything going for him or her, however, they have flaw that sparks their downfall. Due to hubris or pride the heroic character, realizes his or her unfortunate mistake to late. Othello is a military general who is respected by the government and most of the people in his Italian community. However, Iago is the antagonist or nemesis who works against Othello. Due to Iago's envious and vengeful personality, he constructs the downfall of Othello. Iago hates Othello because Othello has promoted Cassio instead of himself. Then, Roderigo hates Othello because he's in love with Desdemona who is Othello's wife. Finally, Brabantio, Desdemona's father hates Othello for marrying his daughter without his permission. Despite Othello's courageous leadership, he is tainted by Iago's, Roderigo's and Brabantio's feelings about Othello's race and/or national origin. Keep in mind Othello is a Moor from North Africa. He is the only African in his Italian community; therefore, he is subjected to the scrutiny of others.So he has a shitty life too.Iago is the represntation of his nemesis,the itallian who is trying to destroy him,who forced his life into disarray,and he finally overcame him.His own character is his intellect   Macbeth is a crazed maniac and his wife is a psycho.I have a feeling that Macbeth is a symbol for a man's fall from grace,with the Lady being his encouragement to do psycho things in his mind.He is a borderline psychopath.She is the part of his mind taht is trully deranged.MacDuff is his intellect  King Lear is a man who has a great family,but cannot control his anger that kills his daughter.He is his own anger in his fanasty,which killed his loved ones like in the play,represented by his daughter.  This line of thought leads the comedies to be represntations of their own fantasys,as they always end in marriage,the ultimate expression of love for these dejected souls  So this leads me to one conclusion.Shakespeares plays were all set in a drug rehab/mental asylum.Romeo never made it,he killed himself,however Othello and Macbeth made it as they killed both Iago and the Lady,the embodiments of there condition.King Lear makes it,but loses his loved ones,and his daughters death is the representaion of them leaving him."

FanTheories,3d5yjf,ChaosMotor,7,Mon Jul 13 22:43:53 2015 UTC,"Well, the basic idea was to explain how/why the monsters had to change, and that is because of the of fact that the monsters were collecting emotions all along. And since the emotions of kids have changed over the course of the Pixar movies, that also makes an affect on the monster world.  Inside Out basically gave that final piece of the puzzle to explain how they could be in an energy crisis."

FanTheories,3d5yjf,JohnButlerTrain,8,Tue Jul 14 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"It seems as though your theory posits that there's a one-to-one relationship between the monsters timeline in Monsters Inc. and the doors that they use to scare children (both move forward in time at approximately the same rate). Do you have any evidence that this would be the case? They could just as easily select doors in a reverse chronological order (perhaps this would be more plausible, even, since the time travel technology probably gets more advanced as time goes on, so the original door technology would have significantly less 'range' than later generations). Or it could be completely randomly selected.   It seems more likely to me that the energy problems in Monsters Inc. are not caused by a shift in the relative strength of joy compared to fear but that they've just expanded too rapidly and their power system has not had the chance to catch up with demand. As you say, the two best scarers in history are both working at the time of Monster's Inc., and they're still generating a lot of energy from fear. It does not seem to be that fear has all of a sudden become less potent, so the logical conclusion would be that demand for energy has grown.  To the point of collecting emotions, how does this theory explain why human emotions are special? If monsters evolved from human beings (due to radiation or whatever other reason you'd like), it'd seem safe to assume that monsters too have the same crew of emotions guiding their decisions, creating their memories, etc. Heck, even cats and dogs have little emotions in their minds! So it would seem highly likely that monsters too have these emotion-beings and that they would be pretty similar to those of humans. So why would monsters need human emotions for power? Why couldn't they just use their own?"
FanTheories,3d5yjf,AllSeeingGoggles,2,Tue Jul 14 03:05:37 2015 UTC,"So why would monsters need human emotions for power? Why couldn't they just use their own?   I feel the monsters couldn't frighten themselves since they're all monsters, the best they could do is startle each other. A kid seeing this giant blue bear with sharp teeth roaring at him would make more fear than Mike seeing a giant blue bear with sharp teeth roaring at him. The monsters are just too used to each other."
FanTheories,3d5yjf,asbskywalker,2,Tue Jul 14 04:39:12 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that totally makes sense! Especially since they would all know that their world is powered by fear, so they'd be expecting it anyway. I think it's an interesting question going forward from Monsters Inc. though. Do you think they'll keep going back in time to get human kids to laugh, or will they just  use monster children to generate power. There's definitely a larger pool to draw on with the time travel, but I wonder how much energy they'd save without running the time travel technology."
FanTheories,3d5yjf,asbskywalker,3,Tue Jul 14 05:05:10 2015 UTC,"Do you think they'll keep going back in time to get human kids to laugh, or will they just use monster children to generate power   The immediate thought I had was that the monsters hadn't thought of that, but they said specifically that 10 years had passed and they're still entertaining children, so that's debunked.  The second thought I had was that maybe the monsters don't have emotions quite like what we see in Inside Out, since according to the Pixar Theory, the monsters are radioactive humans. They may not have the joyous energy needed to fuel their world.  Another answer I had would be that they consider that unethical. Like how humans are OK with slaughtering pigs for food, but not other humans. Same could be said here, but instead of food, it's electricity.  Ultimately I'm just going to go with the theory that they needed more jobs for whoever made those doors."
FanTheories,3d5yjf,asbskywalker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:44:23 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'll try to answer as many of these questions as I can. But it is a theory, so perhaps not everything holds up. But as to evidence that they move: there's a map hanging on the wall in the scareroom showing the entire world and high lighting the areas that they're scareing that day. And I believe it's mentioned in the movie that the reason was that kids would eventually grow used to the monsters and thus not have as big of a fear for them, therefore I assumed that they also moved in time, for the same reason. The idea of then travelling in cronological order came after I watched Inside Out, if we go with the idea that they're collecting emotions, then it would make sense if they'd been going in cronological order due to reasons mentioned above. You also mentioned that fear was also effective even though they're having an energy crisis. I believe that this is because kids are still scared, even if joy has become the main emotion, fear still exists. But since joy is the main emotion, it's way more powerful than fear (later on, that is). It may be because of higher demand that they're experiencing an energy crisis, as you said, but that doesn't change the fact that joy is still more powerful than fear. And lastly, I don't know why humans are so special, I just don't. Maybe because it's a kids movie and it would just be simpler, I don't know. And maybe the monsters lost that ability after they became monsters. But tbh the whole humans turning into monsters is a bit of a stretch, but maybe we'll learn more in upcoming movies."
FanTheories,3d5yjf,HGF88,2,Tue Jul 14 09:16:37 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't that theory put a finite limit on the amount of Emotional Energy that could be harvested by the monsters?   I also remember one of the characters in Monsters Inc. saying something to the effect of: ""kids these days just don't get scared like they used to."" I think it was Waternoose. But this would imply that the monster world is different from the human world."
FanTheories,3d5yjf,FriedBananas96,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:42:45 2015 UTC,"Yes it puts a limit to the amount of memories or emotions that they can collect, which is why they travel the cronological order, so that the children could generate other memories for when the monsters return. But your other statement makes no sense, the monster world is NOT different from the human world, since they've been following human kind's time on Earth. It would make sense for children to suddenly, once they enter the time around the Incredibles, become less scared of things. I really don't understand what you mean by that, it's sort of a contradiction."

FanTheories,3dbeq3,AggroBaboon,0,Thu Jul 16 18:32:18 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of problems are solved with a different conception of time than what you seem to hold, especially the issues you have with kyle being John's father. You assume that there is different strands of time, with an original line, plus a second time line on top with kyle as the father and so on. But if you think of past, present and future existing simultaneously then there's no issue with kyle being John's father. It makes sense that he could've conceived him after meeting him if you assume that it is all happening at once and we are only viewing the story from the perspectives of certain people at a specific time and place. From each individual characters perspective they experience an unaltered linear time line, never once repeating their own past as this would be impossible. The difficulty comes when the story in genisys rewrites what we have actually seen happen in the earlier films. The only way for this to make sense is for us to dismiss the previous events from ever occurring.  They could not have even taken place in an alternative time line that has been rewritten, as there is only one course of events that can and will ever happen, occurring simultaneously that the film let's us view at certain points as previously said. Therefore terminator 2, 3 and 4 didn't happen in a different time line but just simply never happened. To watch the films as Canon now you'd have to go from genisys. Which I think personally is a shame a reflects poor writing, realising they screwed up the franchise and wanted to start again.   Hope that made sense  Edit: to clarify, the mistake is in assuming that time was ever re - written.  It is impossible for something that has happened to unhappen.  Therefore the time line that we view (ignoring the existence of genisys) was the only thing that ever did happen. This makes sense as it appears entirely linear from the perspectives of each individual within the story.  They never re - write their own experience as this is impossible.  And this makes sense if we assume that time occurs simultaneously.  Kyle can meet John before he experiences conceiving John because, although he doesn't know it or hasn't experienced it yet, all of time is existing and occurring at the same time, so he has already conceived John before he meets him, even if he doesn't know it yet. But with genisys this all changes. As time cannot be rewritten we really have to consider the franchise as entirely rebooted. It's not simply the case that the story is now continuing in an alternative time line.  Instead, all those films never happened ever, and what happened in genisys is what has always and only and ever can happen."

FanTheories,3dbd9v,Herdnerfer,0,Wed Jul 15 00:07:14 2015 UTC,"Yes the hat scenes are fabricated from angiers diary and the clones scene is narrated and fabricated just like the diary scenes. Its essentially what the whole movie is about. Lying to the audience.  There are not transporting anything, the gun doesnt shoot real bullets, the birds do not disappear and come back, etc. The whole movie is about lying to the audience to mask the real trick.  Take the opening with the hat scene, micheal caine narrarates ""Are you watching closely? But you wont see. You want to be fooled. You want it to be real"""
FanTheories,3dbd9v,KicksButtson,5,Wed Jul 15 00:16:27 2015 UTC,"Nope, sorry. This is wrong. When we are seeing scenes that are being narrated by one character because they're in the journal that's being read by another, then the narrator can lie to us because he is attempting to lie to the other character. But if you notice you'll see that while the narration may lie from time to time, the events which occur on screen never do.   For instance, Borden talks about Telsa being the key to his transported man trick in his journal, which Angier reads, and which motivates him to seek out Tesla on his own. But even though Borden's narration from the journal lies about Tesla being the key to the trick, we never once see Tesla and Borden together.   Just because the narration may lie does not mean the images lie. What you see is true, especially when both Borden and Angier are together. They just so happen to be together at the end when the tanks and clones are surrounding them. It actually happened.  You're trying to cling onto this untrustworthy narrator concept and you're missing the important points. One thing Nolan always does in every one of his films is place a character in a position of authority (like a mentor) who always tells the truth. The character may not know he is telling the truth, he may only be making an analogy or referencing a memory, but by the end of the film the character's opinion or prediction is always proven correct. In this film Michael Caine fills that role, and Caine says the machine is real magic made by a wizard. Technically he is not wrong."
FanTheories,3dbd9v,Sarlax,-1,Wed Jul 15 09:56:34 2015 UTC,"Im sorry but you are mistaken. Borden and Angier are seen with Tesla together. They both go to Teslas showing of the Ac current months before Angier visits. We know Tesla exist and Borden confirms at the end that he sends Angier on a wild goose chase. Only the scenes narrarated by Angier to Borden are fabricated, there are both attempts to blind Borden. Borden gives Angier the diary and for all purposes sends him to tesla. He tells Angier tesla is the key to my diary but not the key to my trick, which leads Angier to tesla.   Remember Angier gives Borden the diary. Borden gives Angier his diary. Both are tools of deceit. Even if the machine works, Borden doesnt know the tesla can build a machine like that. By sending him to tesla in his mind, he is sending him to a useless bloke. By bordens' own admission he sends Angier there on a wild goose chase. Bordens' diary is also useless, Tesla is the key but it doesnt contain anything useful. Angier gives Borden the diary to have him go to the grave thinking he sent him to the one man that lead to his demise. This also sets up Lord Caldlow a chance to show Borden he has his daughter and tear up his prestige . The diary also proves the man at the jail truly wants Borden secrets to allow the set up of Lord Caldlow appearace, this is narrated in an early scene. It was written for Borden and fabricated.  Two things, you believe Angier gives Borden a diary that could prove his innocence days before his execution? Then show up at the jail? Are we as the audience to believe Borden sends Angier to the one man that can produce a similar result to a twin?   When Caine calls Tesla a wizard, remember he leaves Angier before the Tesla trip, he is showing the Judge how the trick works. This is during the trial of Borden. Caine is still under the impression the ""magic"" was real and Angier is dead. Its only after these events he finds Lord Caldlow and the Judge leads him there. Only then does Caine figure out Angiers' game, so he is being truthful at this point.I disagree with your nolan narration assesment but Caine for sure would fit there.  There are not alot of scenes im implying are fabricated. The timeline in the movie is quite hard to follow and i believe the heart of some of your misstatements. Caine also narrates over the hat shots twice ""Are you watching closely. But you wont see. You want to be fooled. You want it to be real."""
FanTheories,3dbd9v,Sarlax,2,Wed Jul 15 11:03:16 2015 UTC,"Except 1) If it was Root who died the trial would have exposed that, particularly since Cutter himself examined his body, 2) Root would have been an extremely stupid choice for a double after how royally he screwed Angier the first time around (why the hell would Angier trust him to carry out his ultimate revenge plot?), and 3) we see a room full of Angier clones in tanks."
FanTheories,3dbd9v,Sarlax,0,Wed Jul 15 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"1)Caine quickly looked at a decomposing body. He had no reason to expect foul play at that point. Not to mention he is quite old and looked down for a couple seconds at that. He believed Angier to be dead, no reason to go out of his way to really suspect the body wasn't there. He saw him drown and knew he didn't come out for the prestige that night. He is also Borden's friend and never would have participated in the trial had he known Borden was not guilty. Also the reason Caine leads Borden to Angier to get his revenge.   2)it might have been another double but yes I believe it was root. Roots problem was money, that's what caused his downfall. Angier did not want to pay him a large salary forever as he was a small part of the act. But knowing he was going to kill him in a limited show it can be assumed this was fixed. Not to mention the months he spent with ""tesla"" and the time it took to build up the theater, quite reasonable to assume the issues were fixed.  Furthermore he only needed him to come out at the top of the balcony, for the whole show he just needed that. He wasn't depended on that much. He had a small role and would be dealt with in a small amount if time. It's also quite genius as everyone knew he used a double years before, but wouldn't suspect it at the trial given the way it ended.   3)I have already adressed why he had to store the tanks. And we only see one clear body on purpose. This was root, who was recently placed in the tank which explains the very clear air bubble in this tank.  Angier has acquired root and plans to burn the whole place down ridding of any evidence. Angier rigs the place to burn not Borden. He simply intervenes kills Angier then finishes the job."

And America and its allies could have sat outside Japan and waited for a naval blockade to force surrender. Without oil, Japan's ability to launch an offense would be non existent. This also would have drug out an already long and bloody war though, something that would not be popular.  I'm not well researched enough on the subject to say the bombs didn't save lives in the long term. Maybe they did, or maybe they were just a way to finish the war quickly and limiting the casualties on one side. But they were knowingly dropped on civilian cities, on many completely innocent people. And that is a very hard to justify fact for me, personally.  Edit: dammit, look at me being off topic now haha"

The Hulk, who was born of an attempt to recreate the serum with notably heavy use of gamma radiation, also does not grow copious amounts of hair on his face and body (despite the fact that he is based on the Hyde persona of Dr. Jekyll, who is much hairier than a typical person) when hulking out. Red skull, who was born of a more primitive version of the serum, had all of the hair on his head fall off.   Given that Red Skull also had serious cartilage degradation in his face and the hulk loses mental capacity, it would seem the super serum naturally causes deterioration of any features that don't increase strength and resilience, and Cap's perfected serum merely minimized these side effects to an acceptable level (I know I'd give up my body hair for super powers)."

To assume it would have been involved in the original serum is a bit lacking in evidence.  In terms of the red skull, Dr Erskine states that the version of the formula he used wasn't ready, which is why he ended up all red faced and what not.

If the story went any further, we'd be seeing them as the new military force of the Citadel - they're loyal to Furiosa (she was one of Joe's commanders, after all) and they're the only ones really capable of fighting. Furiosa would be trying to make things better, but she would still need them to protect the stronghold. Plus the war party was able to get through the canyon the first time the pass was collapsed. The remnants might have made their way back.   And Nux's sacrifice was definitely seen by Furiosa and the other women. The redheaded girl (Splendid?) reached out to him right before he slammed the War Rig into the canyon. Why wouldn't she tell the story of the soldier who died for her and the others?"

Also always assume incompetence over malice, the raptors look closer to Utahraptors rather than Velociraptors.  4-  Every time we hear about Harry's aunt's past, it was about how she was a right bitch to Lily because Lily was special and Petunia was mundane.  Also the whole ""this kid has the Wizard Gestapo looking for him and will likely kill our whole family"" thing tends to breed resentment.  3- BTF shows that there is only one continuous timeline that you jump around in.  That's why Marty fades when it looks like he won't get born.  And in the original timeline, Loraine does get raped by Biff which explains their misery and basically whole life when it comes to their relationship with each other and Biff.  The part where Marty dies, Doc finds out and goes back to save Marty IS canon though, as evidenced by Marty jumping off the building- that is not the body language of a boy trying to jump onto a lower surface.  That's a boy jumping to his doom.  2- In the video the narrator says ""This chamber has no windows and no doors.  Which offers you this chilling challenge: To find a way out!  Of course, there's always my way..."" meaning that he committed suicide, not that the only way out is suicide.  And jumping out of a second story window is more likely to get you outside with a broken ankle than kill you, presuming your goal is escape rather than suicide.  1-  DJ was born February 1977 and Joey was born September 1960 making him 16 when Pam was 19 and getting knocked up.  Oddly, if you do some rough math, DJ was conceived on or very near Danny's 20'th birthday.  Now, I'm not saying the show goes crazy with the progressiveness, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say they'd been seeing each other for a couple of years before they started having kids.  So on TOP of Pam needing to be a pedophile, and on TOP of a 20 year old being friends with a 16 year old (rather than meeting later in life) it makes more sense that the couple hit the 1 in 8 chance that a Black/Blonde haired couple would have three blonde girls.

FanTheories,3d9xj6,smileimhigh,3,Tue Jul 14 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"Seconding this. What we've seen of Joker fits loosely into a narrative leading up to Harley getting captured by Waller.

The only thing I can't fit into it is Joker and his guys attacking a factory.

FanTheories,3d1p9v,basiliskfang,15,Mon Jul 13 06:56:36 2015 UTC,The series had a scene where a character from the future meet up with another character that he knew from the future. But although they still knew each other certain facts didn't match up with their recollection. Because they didn't travel together to the past when the first one went to the past it altered the timeline and that is the timeline that the second traveled from.
FanTheories,3d1p9v,TheMagicMST,5,Mon Jul 13 08:40:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely.  Timeline A is the one Kyle Reese is from.  Timeline B is the one he is sent to, along with the first Arnie, and is Sarah Connor's story in Terminator.  Timeline C is a second attack, from the future of Timeline B (the machines knew there was a failed attack on her once, so they send a stronger Terminator to take out her and John at a weak point in their lives). Each iteration ups the ante, with T2: Judgement Day giving us the T-1000 and Good Arnie. Most notably, Judgement Day is averted.  Timeline D is the third attack, on adult John and his future lieutenants. Give us the T-X, but apparently the Resistance hasn't figured out how to control stronger machines yet, so John has to fight with another Good Arnie (instead of a sweet Liquid Metal Arnie).  Salvation is unique in that it can kinda happen wherever it wants to, but is probably a D+ Timeline (D, or E, or Z, or whatever), because the Series 800 comes into existence a lot earlier than expected, which is probably due to the advances in tech due to the T-800's, T-1000, and T-X appearing in the past.  Genisys, then... well, it ducks with the time travel a little more than any of the other films, in both good and bad ways. And I don't even remember enough about the Sarah Connor Chronicles to know where they fit in, but I vaguely remember that they were explicitly mentioned as being an alternate timeline, which kinda fits in with the rest of the series."

FanTheories,3d1p9v,A_Waskawy_Wabit,9,Mon Jul 13 01:49:00 2015 UTC,I think of Evil Dead 2 as a sequel and remake to Evil Dead 1.   Evil Dead 1 is remade in the first 20 or so minutes. Obviously the story is heavily stripped down and it's only him and Linda at the cabin. Right up to when he is bum-rushed by the camera just like at the end of Evil Dead 1.

Poorer people such as Han Solo wouldn't really have seen a Jedi considering he was a smuggler in the outer rim which is outside the republics influence anyway. Granted most people should know about Jedi but to my knowledge Han is the only one who really expresses his ignorance of Jedis. The Rebels all say ""may the force be with you"" during major scenes, so it's very possible younger people such as Han on the outer rim hadn't heard of Jedi especially since they went extinct 20 years prior. Plus it's a huge Galaxy, I'm sure there were people during the republic that didn't know who Jedi were."

'Cause no mystical energy field controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.    Han believes that the Jedi existed, and he's heard of them.

FanTheories,3d1p9v,CockneyWeasel,77,Sun Jul 12 22:11:40 2015 UTC,"There seems to be large knowledge of the existence of the force.  On tattoine in the outer rim,so far away from civilised society that they have a thriving slave trade, a junk/slave dealer know about jedi.  Also young slave Anakin knows about jedi and their laser swords,he can even recognise a lightsaber.  Just about everyone is aware of the force and jedi except for the few characters that have to be considered in denial."
FanTheories,3d1p9v,GahLant,37,Sun Jul 12 23:12:01 2015 UTC,"Well that dude (Waddo was his name, right?) only showcased knowledge about the Jedi in reference to their mind tricks, and in a mostly joking way, because mind tricks don't work on him, because he basically has the money-seeking super powers of Mr. Krabs. Anakin knows about the Jedi because he aspires toward the stars. Like if I had a buddy who wanted to be a member of the Screeching Ravens in D company of the 171st airborn, that's a pretty specific thing that the general population doesn't know about, but since my friend aspires to be one of them, he does. But you're right, in the prequels people do seem to showcase a tap-water knowledge of the Jedi, but that's back when they were still around. Based on the size of the Galaxy, the sheer number of people, most, the most by far, will only know of the Jedi through their reputation. But then you have to consider that not only has 20 or so years passed since they have been seen, but their reputation, the reason for knowing about them, was essentially proven ""false"" as a function of their being wiped out. Like The Drew Cary Show was pretty popular 20 years ago, but if you ask someone about it now, they might have a vague recollection of it, or have no idea what you're talking about. 20 years is a long time, even forgetting that the emperor would probably make sure that people didn't remember the Jedi"
FanTheories,3d1p9v,NewLeaf37,7,Sun Jul 12 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"I can see 20 years being enough too. It'd be like if we removed the rank of say, General from the army and replaced it with something else; (And no doubt struck most records of the rank off the record, while putting things about the new rank in its place as a Empire likely doing heavy propaganda is wont to do) while most of us know what a general is, if we're not reminded occasionally for a couple of decades and see the new rank its not unlikely we'd have mostly forgotten about it."

Yeah, he's been around and he can tell that nothing and no one is in charge.

The ending to shrek didn't support the idea that she was an ogre all along, the curse literally said that shed take true loves form, she stayed an ogre because shrek was an ogre. I mean, there was still some ambiguity, but it definitely leant heavily on the human side, notable because   A. She thought of herself as human,   B. Being cursed to be an attractive woman isn't a curse.   C. She was I'm a castle, humans live in castles, ogres live in swamps. It wouldn't make any sense for an ogre to be born, be cursed, be given human clothes and then be locked away in a human castle."

But then in ""Sin City: A Dame to Kill For"", which followed the same format and features many of the same characters and jumping around the time line, but there are a few instances where a character who should be dead is alive again and things happen that just flat-out contradict previously-established events and it's just a mess."
FanTheories,3d1p9v,uberfission,11,Mon Jul 13 03:22:38 2015 UTC,"Not a movie but a series that followed the first 2 movies (well 3 but one was a remaster of the first): Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex. The first and second movie Ghost in the Shell and Ghost in the Shell Innocence both play in the same continuity and after the second one you are not really left with any plot threads dangling behind unresolved. In fact it even feels like the show has come to its closing chapter because the second movie essentially dealt with everything the plot of the first did not follow up on. There is no need to do a third to follow this and arguably it would probably have felt weird and disconnected. The movies both established their characters, they went through these exceptional events, and it left everything in a position that does not really lend itself well to go ""Well now that this is done let us carry on and go somewhere different with this."". But the universe they created with Ghost in the Shell is just way too interesting to not do anything else with it and luckily they went and made GitS S.A.C.    The series essentially ignores the movies as if they never happened. Which allows for S.A.C., SAC 2nd gig and SAC Solid State Society to freely explore this universe in various different aspects. The tone of the series is often different from the movies too, given that it is a series and it can focus on several different things both in the realm of philosophical questions as well as political implications, as opposed to a movie which really is a more monolithic piece.    So there are definitely instances where a discontinuous sequel is something good, provided there is a reason to do one and the creators make something of the opportunity. I was warned about SAC being in a different continuity so I was not too confused when I started it. But given the quality of the series and movies it wouldn't even have been that bad even if I had been confused by the start of the series. But clearly this is the exception. Most movies or series are not fit for any continuity jumps."

FanTheories,3d1p9v,crosis52,29,Mon Jul 13 11:26:26 2015 UTC,"The His Dark Materials trilogy makes a few jumpshifts between books that are pretty jarring. Northern Lights / The Golden Compass (first book) is clearly high fantasy in that it takes place in a very different UK to what we know (our UK doesn't exist in this book), then The Subtle Knife suddenly jumpshifts to low fantasy, in which ""that UK"" is accessible from ""this UK"" via a portal. Then it eventually devolves into a surreal jumble of worlds that doesn't make too much sense at all, which forces the readers to either stop thinking about it and enjoy the story or continue pondering and hate what they are reading.  It's really a sort of ""trilogy syndrome"", where authors have a great idea for a world, write a complete and self contained novel within that world, then the novel is successful and the author decides it's a trilogy, so we end up with one part that is nice and self contained, then two parts that don't fit with the first and instead tell a new and unrelated story. But this is the 21st century and everything has to be a trilogy, so no one can stop after the first and call it a victory. We see this with His Dark Materials, Pirates of the Caribbean, Mistborn, Daughter of Smoke and Bone, even a lot of the comic book superhero movies, to an extent. Authors aren't fully planning their series from the beginning, so it doesn't all fit together as easily as, say, Lord of the Rings, which was much more well planned, so fits together as a single unit."

Yes there were dramatic narrative shifts- that's what happens when you have two main characters (one of which is only introduced in the second installment of the trilogy) traveling from universe to universe. The whole series is about a loss of innocence and childhood. The portals, the conflicts, all of these things are just vectors the story uses to explain the way the two main characters grow up. All that stuff about Dust and daemons gaining a fixed form, about angels and the shit that had all the fundie christians up in arms about the book corrupting children?

Agent Coulson claims that the ""Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, Logistics Division"" was new and still working on the name at the beginning of the film, later claiming that they decided on ""SHIELD."" In later MCU films, and the Agents of SHIELD TV show they claim that SHIELD was in existence for decades. Tony Stark's father completely changes character when they decide to introduce him in-person for Captain America. Basically the universe shifted after Iron Man 1.  The fan theory I have is that there was a monumental, universal shift caused by Tony Stark breaking his ""quantum state"" at his press conference. In the original universe of Iron Man 1, Tony Stark decides to follow the script and hide his identity, creating a world with secret identities and whatnot. However, because of psuedo-science of the MCU, when he decides to reveal his identity the universe cracks around him.

I only just mentally connected the two. The entire time I've been like ""Oh, must be random memories from when I was a kid and X-Files was on TV."" Nope, now I can place it. Holy crap, what else has he been in that I haven't noticed? The best part, pretty much every episode I've been talking to a mate and going ""Dude, there's ANOTHER ONE. This time it's Jack Black before he got well known."" or ""Well, there's Josh from West Wing."" ""Well shit, I know that guy from SG-1!"" (Not Scullys father, he was a well known actor at the time.)

Even the Genisys timeline still involved the T-Connor working at Cyberdyne, which means Sarah had to birth John.  This might be the best option in terms of providing a twist.

It makes sense, too; the only ones who have naturally used Chaos energy are:  Knuckles, who is spiritually linked to the Master Emerald  Shadow, who was created with Chaos Energy Manipulation in mind  Silver, who has psychokinetic powers  Sonic, whose natural super-speed is probably caused by Chaos Energy  and Tails, whose flight is probably caused by Chaos Energy as well.  The first three have artificially linked with Chaos Energy; Knuckles through the master emerald, Shadow through genetic manipulation, and Silver through technological enhancement (notice how his gloves and shoes glow when he uses his powers). Sonic was born with his super-speed, but what about tails?  There's no explanation for him; he simply appeared, and the only explanation given is from the comics, which are a completely separate canon from the games.  Tails only appeared after Robotnic tried to take over the world, and Robotnic has been shown to experiment on animals; it is quite likely that tails is his sole organic creation, having been either deemed a failure or too much work to maintain when compared to robots."

Sonic has supernatural speed and razor-sharp quills, and Tails' tails can smash open metal and act as propellers; what possible explanation for that can there be except for chaos energy?  Of course, Sonic has clearly grown faster over the years; he was much, much slower in the original games. The first game was also Sonic's first introduction to Chaos Emeralds, as shown by his reaction to their effects when he collects them all in the first game. It is very possible that Sonic's speed was augmented, at least, by Chaos energy.   The same can apply to Tails and his flight, as well; it can be augmented with mystical artifacts, but the only time this happens, in sonic adventure, it is an Echidna Artefact, and they used Chaos energy in everything."

And, to crap on your theory a little bit more, Metal Sonic doesn't look that much like Sonic. He doesn't ""run"" like him. He can ""hover"" though as he has a jet engine thingy in his chest. Eggman just wanted to make an enemy able to fight Sonic and improvised like he could. He is creative, at least.  And you should play the old Sonic games again. Tails damages Eggman just fine. While playing with a buddy, you can sit the battles out with Sonic and let Tails whale at him, since he can't die."

FanTheories,3d06iz,muskrat42,5,Sun Jul 12 15:24:48 2015 UTC,The wings weren't all that commonplace considering there were only one set left during the time of Winter Solider.
FanTheories,3d06iz,doclestrange,5,Sun Jul 12 14:45:28 2015 UTC,"There was only one set of those wings after his partner was hit.  The 58th rescue squadron doesn't mean everyone had wings.  Squadron is what the Air Force calls an organization of around 200 airmen, whether they fly planes or desk.  There are maintenance squadrons, medical squadrons, civil engineer and finance squadrons.  I'm pretty sure at one point Falcon says the program was halted after he lost his wingman (again, Air Force parlance for friend or close work associate most of the time.). The file telling about the wings has them listed as ""X-sometjing"" implying theyre experimental.    Also, Falcon was US Air Force, not army.  We have pararescuemen in the air force."
FanTheories,3d06iz,tenaciousNIKA,2,Sun Jul 12 20:49:59 2015 UTC,I think shield specialists are better than the strike team. We know shield sends specialists alone on what would be considered suicide missions for other agents.

I feel like that would imply him and Riley are the only two who used the wings and that Riley's pair was destroyed when he died and Sam's were the only pair left. Also I highly doubt the Netflix shows will ever do invested crossovers with AoS or the films.

That's 3 I know off the top of my head.
FanTheories,3d06iz,WhatImMike,8,Sun Jul 12 14:41:35 2015 UTC,Skye from Agents of Shield went to the same Orphanage as Matt Murdock.

Or having Coulson/Fury show up and ask for someone to join something. Nothing wrong with any of it, but IIRC Daredevil didn't have any actual characters from other movies appear, which hasn't happened...ever, I think. Feel free to correct me."
FanTheories,3d06iz,WhatImMike,16,Sun Jul 12 15:54:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair, AoS only has Coulson as both TV/movie crossover. Honestly I would think it has to come down to actor contracts.   For example, say Chris Evans shows up in AoS. In his contract it says he has 9 appearances as Captain America. That'll count as one so that couldn't use him in a 9th movie and lose out the appeal.   Back to DD, I think it was a gamble Netflix and Marvel took to make it dark and gritty and it paid off in spades. I honestly don't think any other character (besides Moon Knight) could pull off a ""origin series"" quite like this.   Other than my nitpicking, great theory. I would go so far as to say maybe not Hydra that killed his family but the Russian mob. Keep his SHIELD training intact. It would tie him in to Hells Kitchen and looking for the mob/the guy who stopped the mob."

From what I've read as well, it takes place during CA:WS. MCU was going through worse trouble than worrying about a crime fighter in Hells Kitchen.   Now that he's out, that could be a whole new story."

What I liked about Daredevil was that it expanded on the MCU by showing that while this is a world with superheros and supervillains, that doesn't mean that the MCU doesn't have the same types of criminals that our world has; child traffickers, drug dealers, and shady businessmen. I'd like to see more of criminals that aren't a part of some secret organization, they are just cruel people that want to make an easy buck."
FanTheories,3d06iz,GreggoryBasore,3,Sun Jul 12 19:39:24 2015 UTC,Agreed. The Punisher is a much more interesting character when he's going after penny ante crack dealers and mob enforcers than if you throw him up against global super villainous terror groups.

It shouldn't be the compliment for every single comic book film and it shouldn't be the formula to make every single comic book film.

The MCU is so fantastic and beyond comprehension that it takes some measure of suspension of belief to understand a character like Thor, for example. However, in Daredevil's case, you didn't need any suspension of belief. This was reality. This was The Wire+Ninja's. Even Daredevil's ability to have super senses wasn't a focal point of the show.

FanTheories,3cz7li,GoorillaInTheRing,58,Sun Jul 12 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but the implication I got is that Doc realized where Marty must have gone after finding out that Biff was now a millionaire and married to his mom. He then flew to Biff's building to see if he was there, saw then on the roof, and hovered just below where Marty was. It was luck.  It raises the question of whether Doc would intentionally change the timeline for Marty. But at that point everything had been corrupted and Doc was planning on going back to make sure it didn't happen, so it's entirely possible the theory is sound. I can see Doc not wanting to preserve the stability of the timeline because it was going to be wiped out as soon as they fixed things anyway."

FanTheories,3cz7li,Memyselfsomeotherguy,3,Sun Jul 12 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"That's such a weird choice, but it has a good out of universe explanation: they wrote themselves into a corner.  For anyone who doesn't know, Zemeckis and Gale never intended to do more than the first movie. When it originally came out, it didn't say ""To be continued"". That was added on home video. The whole ""Something has to be done about your kids!"" was a joke, but when the studio wanted a sequel, they had no choice but to continue with that joke.  Which explains why Doc didn't just go to Marty the day before it was supposed to happen and tell him."

Watch Marty as he approaches the edge of the roof; he is distinctly looking for something below. Since we know the DeLorean is there, it would have to be that.

BTTF - Marty goes back in time, changes history so his mom and dad don't hook up and almost immediately starts to disappear  (starting with his brother in the picture).  BTTF2 - Old Biff goes back in time, gives himself the Almanac, somehow makes it back to the original 2015 before he disappears from the timeline.  The problem is, the very act of going back in time and giving himself the almanac should have created the universe-destroying paradox that Doc was worried about. Because if Old Biff never existed, he never could have brought the Almanac back to 1955."
FanTheories,3cz7li,SvenHudson,13,Sun Jul 12 13:53:53 2015 UTC,Think about it like a rock being thrown in water causing ripples. The time lines won't change until the ripples hit it. That's why Marty's siblings disappeared before he did. Old Biff was able to outrun the ripples and return to 2015 before any changes.
FanTheories,3cz7li,godchamp1,-3,Sun Jul 12 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, but one of those ripples would be the removal of the Almanac from the timeline, because Biff wasn't able to take it from the garbage can in 2015 and bring it back to himself. In fact, Marty himself should have disappeared because Doc in the alternate timeline was thrown in a mental facility and therefore never invented the time machine."
FanTheories,3cz7li,magusopus,6,Sun Jul 12 16:11:01 2015 UTC,"The movies themselves demonstrate that objects prefer updating to disappearing. The timeline was not altered in such a way that the almanac never got printed so instead of fading away it simply updated the information contained in it, just like the photographs and the flier and the fax.  As for Marty, there are a couple possible reasons why he seems unaffected.   He was going to disappear but simply hadn't yet. In BttF 1 it took a few days before he showed any symptoms. The same thing but instead of disappearing his ultimate fate was to become the dark 1985's version of himself, updating like objects do. He and Doc Brown travelled from 2015 to 1985 before the ripple from 1955 reached 2015, meaning their present never coincided with that ripple, which could mean that that particular ripple will never be able to effect them."
FanTheories,3cz7li,kinyutaka,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:01:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe the paradox didn't happened because, time, at least in the movie is represented a a straight line, so as long as young Biff haven't made his first bet then the future wasn't altered when old Biff went back to the future, that and because i love the movies."
FanTheories,3cz7li,magusopus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:56:52 2015 UTC,"Flux Capacitor manages to smooth all this out (heh heh).  I'd imagine just from the name, it takes the fluctuations in timelines for the passengers of the vehicle, and smooths them out in such a way they don't just outright disappear unless a dramatically major change to the timeline has occurred.    The longer someone has been in contact or within range of it, the longer it takes them to disappear, and likewise, the larger the change, the larger the ""ripple"".  Time travel is made possible because not only does it smooth out the minute ripples (what did they call it?  The Butterfly Effect?  Step on a bug, end a kingdom?) so every action someone does by just being where they are doesn't cause major changes to what the future was before the person left it.  It also allows the recipient time to correct any accidental mistakes, so pretty important function and one I like to think made the movie possible (which is why it exists of course!)  Old biff was in contact with the vehicle, what?  Maybe an hour?  And any changes he implemented made it impossible for him to live past a certain age.  Not hard to assume if he gets rich it's likely he dies from heart disease, or another issue from the gluttonous lifestyle he'd run.  Alternatively if he stays a bully or strong enough to intimidate others, he'd probably end up dying from someone willing to stand up to him the wrong way much later in life, or he'd just end up dead from some stupid stunt he'd pull because of his overly-inflated ego (bang bang).  Marty?  No changes Marty would have done could cause him to never exist at all, unless his parents don't kiss at the dance (the apparently pivotal moment of his future).  Personally, I think the heart disease thing was Biff dying from what future Biff would have anyway.  Doesn't seem like the kind of guy who would pay attention to his health, and all that grumbling"

I suppose we could assume the obvious, ""We wouldn't be able to handle the amount of power possible without it!"", but it just feels wrong to assume it was a purely engineering item.  Bear with me here this is annoyingly long: Doc Brown is an obvious fan of Jules Verne.  Verne, has not written a time traveling story, only those of adventure using marvelous pieces of technology to make it possible.  It is assumed H.G. Wells was inspired by the works of Jules Verne and likewise Rene Barjavel who introduced the Grandfather Paradox (which is important if we're discussing only a linear Fourth Dimension of time being affected, versus Parallel universes or Alternative dimensions which they cast off in the simplified explanation of why Marty might disappear on the chalkboard.  Branch timelines which would cease to exist, versus just continuing onward as an alternative, parallel timeline, so we know which theory Doc Brown was working with when he was working on how to travel through time).  Doc Brown is very very very likely to have been a fan of ALL classical time travel works (otherwise how would he have a good understanding of temporal paradox and the possibilities of time travel?)  If time were to be a linear fourth dimension, he realizes he could not change anything in the past for anything to become possible if he already exists in the timeline he exists in.  (kind of like...you can't go back and kill yourself as a baby if you already exist today as yourself...unless there is something to make it possible to kill yourself.   ...confused yet?)   An alternative option, is to be able to change time, but how do you do this without offing yourself from ever existing in the first place, or outright being affected by the changes as you make them?  You'd need a buffer of some sort, something that allows you to not only change the past, but minimize the effects on yourself in the future so the time machine would still exist at some point, and voila....capacitor.  It just feels like a natural fit to me, and explains a lot of the issues with time travel many have on how changes could even be made (besides the obvious argument on if their view of time travel is correct or not)."

There was a deleted scene where old Biff faded away from reality and the explanation given was the Lorraine killed Biff some time after 1985 and Hill Valley, relieved of his influence, got itself back on track and became a nice place again so, by 2015, it had become the same 2015 we saw before just with no Biff or George McFly."

FanTheories,3cwsli,19katzesaugen93,20,Sat Jul 11 17:10:27 2015 UTC,"Okay... let me educate you.  A good theory would be something along the lines of ""Willy Wonka puts acid in his chocolate"" that uses evidence like the trippy, weird interactions that the people encounter in the factory (which they don't normally feel because the effects are lessened greatly after the chocolate is cooked, formed, and shipped). Or maybe that Oz is another dimension of Earth, and that explains why the Wizard looks exactly like the kindly carney that Dorothy met before going there.  This is just... ""hey, they both walk on something red"""
FanTheories,3cwsli,Long_Dong_Silver_IV,13,Sat Jul 11 17:40:30 2015 UTC,A theory is not speculation. A theory is an explanatory framework that uses observation (evidence) to extrapolate conclusions from existing information.

Even if Stravos is future Jesse, why the hell would he become a conman and mess with his family in the past? That's like going into the past and shooting yourself in the foot. It's only going to hurt yourself.  Nicky and Alex traveling back in time is also insane. The ""Cousin Steve"" could very well be a 2nd or 3rd cousin that wasn't very close to the main family of Danny, Pam, DJ, and Stephanie. As for ""Boyfriend Steve""....that's incest and is frowned upon and he would be informed about that by Jesse.  Stephanie is just Stephanie Tanner, daughter to Danny and Pam Tanner and sister to Donna Jo and Michelle Tanner.If time travel is possible, it would have to have been after Steve Urkel created the machine and went back in time to a point where Pam could use it. I'll break down why your 4 points of Stephanie being a future person are just plain wrong: 1. Why would DJ go back in time to be her own sister and suffer what she already put herself through? I know some wouldn't call it suffering, but the bad times of how your older sibling treated you and how you treated your younger sibling really stick with you. 2. Why would Michelle go back in time and deal first-hand with some of the bad that both she as Michelle and she as Stephanie experienced? 3. Seriously? 4. You are on drugs as Steve Urkel would have had to have gone to a point in time that was basically 6 months between Michelle being born and her dying. I'll admit it's possible, but she'd probably be weirded out as all hell that some random child stepped out of a strange box with future technology and told her she was going to die and how she was going to die. I know I wouldn't believe a word of it and maybe run like hell, leading to an early death and messing with the timeline just a bit."

FanTheories,3cskc7,IMrMacheteI,28,Fri Jul 10 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"Some of the smaller tires might be solid rubber, but most of them probably aren't.  There are much better ways to design a damage resistant tire than just making it solid rubber.  One of the major forces that keeps normal tires attached to the wheels of a car is the pressure of the inner tube pressing the metal bead of the tire against the metal rim of the wheel.  Without that pressure, you need another way of keeping the tire on the wheel.  There are other means of attaching tires such as adhesives or fasteners, but reapplying adhesive or replacing 200 staples is much more work than shooting some more air into the tire.    Another problem that a solid tire would present is that pneumatic tires are designed to deform under acceleration.  This is important for vehicle traction because it means that the tires of the vehicle flatten out where they meet the road and provide a larger surface area for gripping the road.  A solid tire can't do that.  If it can't deform as much, it spins out more and therefore wears down faster.  A solid tire will retain more heat as well, which will also lead to increased wear.    So if the tires of Mad Max aren't solid, then what are they?  Let's start with the ones that obviously aren't regular sized car tires.    Out out of all the vehicles in the movie, only five of them have wheels substantially larger than normal road cars.  Out of these five, only two have wheels of a radically different type, the Gigahorse and the Big Foot.  The description of the Big Foot actually says that it's driving 66"" Terra tires, AKA monster truck tires, so we'll start with it.    There's no way in hell they're solid rubber, because a v8 engine would never even move them, but regular monster truck tires are actually very hard to pop.  These things are designed to drive over sharp rocks, busted cars, or basically anything else without popping.  Furthermore they're designed to do it while supporting about 6-8 tons of tractor.  A stray bullet isn't likely to do shit to these, and even if it did there are easy ways to reinforce a tire this big without making it solid.  Any tire this size is generally run at a relatively low PSI, and often has antifreeze filling lots of the volume to make it heavier and easier to pressurize.  This means that if the tire is punctured, it's not going to explode like little road tires will.  It'll start leaking air/antifreeze, but it'll be a slow leak.  This means that the driver is going to know the tire is compromised well before it impacts vehicle performance.  The Big Foot simply can't be a fast vehicle either, since tires that size are really only rated for about 30mph.  This vehicle isn't likely to be in a situation where a hole in the tire affects its combat performance.  Interesing side note, if you pump these full of air you can drive on water.  Next up is the Gigahorse.  These tires are also clearly pneumatic because that's half the reason you put double rear wheels on a vehicle.  Those are tractor tires.  They follow basically the same rules as monster truck tires, but have much less surface area and are therefore even less likely to be hit in a manner that punctures them.    The three remaining vehicles are the War Rig, the Doof Wagon, and the Buick.  These three are all running similar tires, and we actually know exactly what kind the Doof Wagon is running since it's a real military vehicle.  With the possible exception of the Buick, these are military grade run-flat tires or the post-apocalyptic equivalent.  The standard method of keeping this kind of tire operational is to insert a support ring inside the tire that supports the vehicle's weight if the tire loses pressure.  We can actually see this frame when the War Rig encounters some spike strips and loses large portions of multiple tires.  This frame looks considerably different from real world production run-flats, so it's a safe assumption that these were built specifically for the war rig.    As for the rest of the vehicles, most of the tires present are actually just mid to high quality offroad tires.  You can actually see the brand names on a few of them too.  Someone makes the point that the tires on the Interceptor can be seen to be heavily worn and appear to be stitched back together.  The description of the car actually says ""rear tyre (little) more than rag and rubber.""  There's actually a decent chance that this one functions without air pressure, but it's probably not solid all the way through.  The War Boy cars are a different story.  All the tires on these vehicles are actually in pretty good condition, which indicates that they aren't scarce.  If they were difficult to replace, they would have much more tread wear than they appear to have.  While we don't see the crew of the hijacked War Rig shooting at enemy tires, we do see many saw type weapons employed by the Buzzards, some of which are clearly designed to take out enemy wheels.  Since we have seen on the War Rig that Immortan Joe's men are capable of making run-flat support rings, it's  a good guess that they may have built these into the tires of any other vehicles as well.  A solid rubber tire that gets shredded by a saw blade on the end of a hay tetter is fucked, and it'll be a lot more work to replace, but a metal frame under a pneumatic tire can be replaced much more quickly and easily.  If this is true, it means that bullets wouldn't be very effective at shredding the wheels.  Furiosa would certainly be aware of this and Max has a decent chance of knowing as well.  They lack any weapons capable of knocking out a wheel easily, so they don't do it.  It's also a good bet that the normal sized tires are also using alternative fillers such as sealant foam.  Just like tractor tires, the wheels could be filled partially with a fluid and then pressurized with air, allowing them to run at lower pressures and preventing them from blowing out when punctured."

From what I understand, if you're traveling at speed the bullet will just get flung up or down by the motion of the tire itself. The speed of the tire will actually deflect the bullet. You're much better off trying to shoot the sidewall, which generally isn't nearly as convenient in a chase."

FanTheories,3cue7e,Dead_Man_Redditing,4,Fri Jul 10 21:49:40 2015 UTC,Then let's assume its the leg bone of the guy that cut off her arm!
FanTheories,3cue7e,mmmpiecrust,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:06:42 2015 UTC,Or the leg bone of the guy that killed her mother after she hunted him down? Then she maybe she got the Imperator rank? :o
FanTheories,3cue7e,gtr427,4,Sun Jul 12 01:33:36 2015 UTC,It's the head and neck of a femur from the looks of it. That looks like the greater trochanter to me
FanTheories,3cue7e,StoneGoldX,3,Fri Jul 10 22:01:35 2015 UTC,"I have a strong feeling that Miller wanted to use an arm bone, but maybe it wouldn't have looked as good? I dunno, this seems like something Miller would've done :/"
FanTheories,3cue7e,Dead_Man_Redditing,3,Fri Jul 10 23:08:09 2015 UTC,"If the bone has any tie to Furiosa, it may have come from her mother."
FanTheories,3cue7e,tehzephyrsong,4,Sat Jul 11 05:05:29 2015 UTC,"Very interesting! I could see that, though it sounds pretty morbid.   What if Furiosa's mom blew up and the only thing that was left was a leg..."
FanTheories,3cue7e,Mr_Miyagii,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:11:07 2015 UTC,The back story for Doof Warrior is the mask he wears is made out of his mother's face.
FanTheories,3cue7e,PaleAsDeath,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:20:33 2015 UTC,Her mother died right after she was taken and still a child so I doubt there would have been a practical way for her to get and keep the bone.
FanTheories,3cup4n,whoami4546,36,Fri Jul 10 22:45:31 2015 UTC,"In ""Kill The Beast,"" Gaston and his mob seem to know exactly where it is without any further direction from the mirror. I would assume it's common enough knowledge, but everyone assumes it's abandoned. We could easily speculate that the French Revolution took place during those ten years, explaining why no one went looking for them, or it could just be a local mystery."
FanTheories,3cup4n,NewLeaf37,6,Fri Jul 10 23:56:47 2015 UTC,Yeah never thought about them not getting directions! Good Point!
FanTheories,3cup4n,brent1123,2,Sat Jul 11 00:24:08 2015 UTC,"Is it set in the late 1700's though? I always thought it had an early-mid 1600's look, if only because of Gaston's blowgun/musket design"

FanTheories,3cup4n,icorrectpettydetails,7,Sat Jul 11 12:56:51 2015 UTC,"To quote my earlier post, '10 years tax free'. The prince was a dick and the monarchy in France was not viewed in the best of lights at the time. No one gave a crap."
FanTheories,3cup4n,pottersquash,2,Sat Jul 11 14:57:55 2015 UTC,They probably assumed servants killed him and just fled.
FanTheories,3cup4n,mimien2,2,Sat Jul 11 21:58:38 2015 UTC,"I think that since (at the beginning of the story it is revealed that) the prince at first is very evil, he must have done something to oppress the villagers. When those things stopped happening, the villagers decided to leave the whole thing alone and go one with their lives, maybe hoping that the castle was abandoned. Not a whole lot of evidence, but that is my thinking."
FanTheories,3cup4n,GabeReal,3,Sun Jul 12 01:18:25 2015 UTC,"Because he was the best at hiding castles, hence his name."
FanTheories,3cup4n,sherlockdoctor,3,Sat Jul 11 16:05:13 2015 UTC,"I've always kinda thought that the castle existed somewhat out of time due to the curse, and as such was forgotten unless specifically pointed out (such as when Belle pulled out the mirror). Explains how the seasons changed at the castle but it seems only a few days passed in the village, the timing issues of the curse, and why nobody ever mentioned the castle until explicitly pointed out to them,   Another explanation is that Maurice and Belle were relative newcomers to the village, and also shown to be outcasts, so were simply not told about the castle since they didn't really engage in town small talk. The villagers thought the castle was abandoned, and therefore didn't factor into their daily lives."
FanTheories,3cup4n,mirrorspirit,2,Sat Jul 11 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"I bet they knew about the castle.  They just assumed it was abandoned, because the area around it was overgrown and they never saw any inhabitants coming or going."
FanTheories,3cup4n,PaleAsDeath,2,Sun Jul 12 03:22:26 2015 UTC,"In the original story the beast was a duke, not a prince. I think it makes more sense in that context. They just made him a prince because little kids know what they are and so Bell could be an official princess."

FanTheories,3cznqh,Deandalecc,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:50:44 2015 UTC,They definitely do. And the fact that Carla finds it funny and trivializes her husband's frustration makes me want to slowly burn her to death while crows peck out her eyes.

FanTheories,3cz7f3,Dawwy,2,Sun Jul 19 12:56:29 2015 UTC,"The entire point of the movie was emotional complexity, as in each emotion represents more than just one thing. Just because Anger is the control in the Dad and Sadness is the control in the Mom, doesn't mean that the Dad is always angry and the mother is always depressed"
