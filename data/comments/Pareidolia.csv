Pareidolia,3dy3jn,christianh10992,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:47:34 2015 UTC,"As Ashnazg points out; they only represent sounds; i.e. they're used to spell things phonetically. (In Japanese, two of the scripts; hiragana and katakana serve the very same purpose, however. The other symbols, Kana, are used to represent more abstract concepts/words. Hiragana effectively is used to conjugate verbs and add prefixes etc. Katakana is used to phonetically spell foreign words. Hiragana and Katakana are the 'simple'  signs you see repeated a lot, Kana generally contain far more strokes)  Usually extra signs are required on Arabic sounds to make them into other sounds; for instance you spell ""ti"" by combining the ""taa"" with a ""yaa"" and adding the ""i""- mark below the taa.  However, in many Arabic languages and dialects, in written form, many of the letters lack the extra symbols that indicate whether it's a ""u"" ""i"" or ""a"" sound. To what extent this occurs, I am as yet unclear."
