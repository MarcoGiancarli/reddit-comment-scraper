panthers,3e4fzh,cucumbinator123,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:04:52 2015 UTC,"How much do you think the Panthers would offer him? I saw on OverTheCap that Lawrence Timmons is the highest paid ILB at $47,795,750 over 5 years with $11M guaranteed. Around $50,000,000 over 5 years with $20M guaranteed is what I think."
panthers,3e4fzh,BSUBroncos,2,Tue Jul 21 22:40:48 2015 UTC,There is another good article on that site that says Sportrac forcasts his new contract as 6years/69 Million

I don't think 12 million per year is out of Kuechly's reach. 5 years $60 mil seems like a pretty safe bet with potential to go higher unless he decides to take a hometown discount."
panthers,3e4fzh,tartay745,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:16:53 2015 UTC,My best guess is 12m a year.  The salary cap continuing to rise is going to mean the highest paid ILB easily.

He played well initially for the Dolphins, showing signs of reaching his potential (though perhaps as a really, really great right tackle as opposed to left tackle), but back-to-back torn ACLs and some back issues have robbed him of some of his ability. He might be the ""Anti-Thomas Davis"" - what happens when your consecutive knee injuries happen at the worst possible time and you don't have the team to back you up or a support structure in place to rehab you properly. The Rams cut him because they didn't want to take his MASSIVE cap hit this year and no one has signed him because of the injury risk/number he will command.

panthers,3e2flf,Devinlee425,5,Tue Jul 21 13:57:11 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  As good as Luke has been for us, it wasn't until Star and Short were drafted were we able to stop teams from running all over us (let's ignore half of last season)."

There was Leveon Bell's 81 yard run against us, LeGarret Blount's 50 yard run, and Giovani Bernard's 89 yard run.  Take away those 3 freak plays and we go from having given up 1792 rushing yards last year to 1572, moving us from having the 16th ranked run defense to the 6th.  Edit: Also taking away those 3 plays takes our total defense from 10th in the league to 6th in terms of yards/game."

panthers,3e2flf,btbessaay,10,Tue Jul 21 19:38:16 2015 UTC,I hope we have the cap space to sign KK and Star when the time comes.
panthers,3e2flf,MisterRandyMarsh,5,Tue Jul 21 14:27:36 2015 UTC,Its gonna be tough to sign both of them and hopefully Ealy if he pans out if we're still paying Charles Johnson
panthers,3e2flf,christianhashbrown,3,Tue Jul 21 15:44:22 2015 UTC,"This is why Getts doesn't sign many Free Agents. After this year CJ's cap hit will come way down, Cam's will slide into its spot, and we should have plenty of space to sign them both. Priase the Gettleman."
panthers,3e2flf,Daeavorn,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:45 2015 UTC,But that's exactly what people got mad at Hurney for doing.  He didn't sign many Free Agents and gave out hefty second contracts to our successful draft picks.
panthers,3e2flf,faultlessjoint,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:38:29 2015 UTC,"Hurney would've made Cam the highest paid player in the NFL. Look at the big contracts Gettleman has signed so far: Cam, Greg Olsen and TD58. They're all team-friendly deals.  There's no reason to think Gettleman is going to turn into Hurney 2.0. That said, Luke is going to be the highest paid MLB pretty soon."
panthers,3e2flf,MisterRandyMarsh,4,Wed Jul 22 01:18:31 2015 UTC,That'll be tough. Can't see them playing on any other team though.
panthers,3e2flf,JaquiskiTaterTartt,2,Tue Jul 21 15:44:21 2015 UTC,Gettleman values the D-line too much to let either one walk. I'm fairly certain we keep both because they have different skill-sets. Star isn't going to get a moster deal because his strengths are mainly run-stopping and being a space eater. Short is another story. He's probably going to be a top 5 DT when we sign him.
panthers,3e2flf,rtelitenc,4,Tue Jul 21 22:48:53 2015 UTC,Which teams in the NFL have a better duo up front? The only teams that come to mind are perhaps the Dolphins and Jets.

panthers,3e4676,andyroohoo,2,Tue Jul 21 21:04:51 2015 UTC,"Going to preface by saying I disagree with his ranking of Cam.   Stop saying this to try and make someones opinion seem lesser. Or if you really insist on doing this, point me at someone who has literally been right about everything he has ever said. Sometimes analysts make calls and miss. That doesn't mean their opinion is immediately less viable. Disagree if you like but to condemn someone because they weren't correct about something is an ignorant way to try and devalue the opinion of someone."
panthers,3e4676,enfyte416,2,Tue Jul 21 23:12:34 2015 UTC,"Jaws has been consistently incorrect for a long time, and repeatedly discredits our QB because he reminds him of Randall Cunningham who stole his job years ago. I agree with the sentiment of your post, but Jaws is the wrong person to try and defend around this notion."
panthers,3e4676,SpaceIsAPlace,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:46:57 2015 UTC,That's why I started out saying I 100% disagree with him in this situation. I just chose this as an example. It has nothing to do with specifically defending Rose as much as the idea I am arguing.
panthers,3e4676,enfyte416,2,Wed Jul 22 03:20:39 2015 UTC,"A couple things I'll concede right off the bat: obviously as a former NFL QB Jaws is a better analyst than I'll ever be. Duh. Obviously there are a handful of NFL QBs that are better than Cam. Of course. This isn't me being a blind obsessed fan of Cam like I think you're suggesting. My view of Jaws is totally swayed by the link rtelitenc posted below (sorry I'm on mobile or I would link this better). ESPN basically got exposed for using an outlandish thing that Jaws said as a way to create talking points on all of their programs. The fact that ESPN (which I'll admit I watch a ton of) does this isn't particularly shocking, and I don't think that Jaws is the mastermind of some sort of programming conspiracy. He may have actually believed what he was saying in 2012. Either way, the whole thing makes me feel like he's a shitty analyst of what is admittedly a completely pointless ranking.  I just don't think he's someone who I would hire if I owned an NFL team and needed input on my QB. Is that good enough?"

panthers,3e4676,homebells,2,Wed Jul 22 00:36:16 2015 UTC,Doing or saying 1 dumb thing does discredit everything else you say
panthers,3e4676,Namath96,2,Wed Jul 22 01:02:28 2015 UTC,"While I agree with what you are saying, it is kind of hard to know about every stupid thing someone says and just list example after example of 1 analysts mistakes off the top of your head.

panthers,3e4676,G_Thirty,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:19:22 2015 UTC,"I get that he was trying to do that, but it still comes off as not so subtle jab at his credibility than just saying to take his opinion with a grain of salt. My problem with that regardless of meaning is exactly what I said. There is nobody that hasn't had a wrong/bad/stupid opinion before. If /r/panthers agrees with someone, they ""know what they are talking about."" or are ahead of the curve, etc. If they don't, take their opinion with a grain of salt. It just wreaks of bias."
panthers,3e4676,enfyte416,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:47:10 2015 UTC,"There is definitely a little bias, but what fan base has 0 bias? Being a fan inherently makes you bias. Also, that is what just about everyone in the world does about everything. If someone shares the same opinion, they think that person is right and if they don't then they think that person is wrong. Otherwise they would have a different opinion. If this was just baseless bias people would be saying Cam deserves top 5 or the analyst is an idiot. I think most Panther's fans think Cam is in the low teens. And of course making a mistake while analyzing football players hurts your credibility as a football analyst. What else could hurt your credibility?"
panthers,3e4676,G_Thirty,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"It's not just the difference between thinking someone is right and thinking someone is wrong. You are completely generalizing what this subreddit does with stuff like this. If there was just variances of agreeing or disagreeing I wouldn't have this gripe. It happens a lot more when we disagree with someones opinion, but /r/panthers doesn't just disagree and think they are wrong, they find ways to make them sound stupid/delusional or think they have a flat out bias against us.   I also don't think incorrectly analyzing a player here and there hurts your credibility whatsoever. The field is far too unpredictable to be that fickle about it. You have to be like, Skip Bayless level where you are just trying to get people riled up to lose your credibility, but even then that is a calculated loss to credibility for ratings purposes."
panthers,3e4676,enfyte416,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:31:10 2015 UTC,Sorry but I have to disagree with you on your second point. How in the world would a professional football analyst being terrible at analyzing football players not make him less credible than someone who is great at analyzing football players? Yes one single mistake obviously means basically nothing but your credibility as an analyst certainly rests on your ability to analyze.
panthers,3e4676,G_Thirty,0,Wed Jul 22 04:07:36 2015 UTC,"Here and there   Key words, friend. You originally implied incorrectly analyzing anyone hurts your credibility and are now completely flipping to being terrible in general. I've stuck to saying that having misses every so often does not hurt your credibility. It's just a natural part of trying to predict something in a fairly unpredictable field."
panthers,3e4676,enfyte416,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:14:08 2015 UTC,"My point is to disagree with him, not discredit him. His opinion isn't invalid because some of his opinions were stupid. Nobody has ever been 100% correct when predicting things of this nature."

Hes gotta improve his accuracy and he often makes the wrong reads. I cant tell you how many times last year that I started yelling at the TV cause he was throwing off his back foot or not throwing to a wide open check down. Hes still fairly young and he hasnt had the best offense around him, since hes got into the league... im excited for the possibilities this year tho"
panthers,3e3qfj,gelango,3,Tue Jul 21 19:09:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think as soon as he starts throwing to his check downs more often his accuracy will go up and that will help extend drives. That's the easiest thing to fix right now and it would improve his game right away.   Well that's only if he can throw a 10 yards pass without breaking the receiver's ribs...  Nonetheless, I'm super excited to see what he's going to do with a decent WR corp and being healthy (knock on wood) should help too!"
panthers,3e3qfj,mfortin014,2,Tue Jul 21 20:35:34 2015 UTC,"lmao ya he throws bullets, i legitimately wonder if i would be able to catch a pass from him... ya the wr they got this year are definitely an upgrade from last year, however im pretty sure im expecting too mucch from a relatively mediocre wr core"
panthers,3e3qfj,gelango,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:34:44 2015 UTC,"What bugs me is how they claim he can never be a 1 or be a great passer. We've seen tons of improvement each year. This last year was such a trial for Cam with all of these injuries. I fully expect him to prove all of these doubters wrong. He may not be elite this season, but he sure as hell will be getting closer."

panthers,3dtje4,CWCNYC,6,Sun Jul 19 08:51:30 2015 UTC,"Ehhh, I'd say our Dline/QB are better off than our WR corps as it stands today.  We don't know if Funchess will work out or if Ginn still has anything in the tank.  We are putting a lot of hope in a lot of new players at WR that quite honestly MAY not pan out.  To say its the second-best group on the team is a bit ambitious.    Cam and DA are a great pair to have and as a duo there's probably not many better starter/backup combos at QB in the league (easily top-10).  And with CJ, Star, KK, and a rotation of Ealy/Alexander/Horton on the Dline, that's a scary thought.  Good write-ups, just a little too confident on WR situation IMO."

panthers,3dveh8,Spiralyst,17,Sun Jul 19 21:09:37 2015 UTC,"We have a good bit of depth at RB already with Fozzy, CAP, and Wegher.  They may pick some other body up for camp, but I think we will just develop what we have."
panthers,3dveh8,-Deuces-,9,Sun Jul 19 21:17:08 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be ""bold"" and agree with you. CAP is probably our second best option as a 23 year old 5th round rookie who has done nothing in the NFL yet. Fozzy Whitaker has had 60 rushing attempts in his whole career, and as a testament to just how irrelevant he was before he came here, he was cut by the Chargers and Cardinals before ever playing a snap for them. And Wegher is a UDFA who also has proven nothing. Why do we think 3 players with 60 snaps of NFL experience between all three of them is a stable group of backup RB's?   Seriously people. If Jstew goes down and none of these guys work out we will be scrambling. It would be nice to have another player on the roster with a proven NFL track record to take some carries and potentially shoulder some of the load if Stewart does get injured. Not to mention it's still the middle of fucking July. It's okay for our roster to have 7-10 runningbacks on it until we need to cut the roster down to 75 on the September 1st. May as well pick up for an non-guaranteed contract and see what they can do.   I know OP is getting a little defensive and the name calling isn't really helping his case here, but the question itself is perfectly reasonable."

panthers,3dveh8,datboijustin,-3,Mon Jul 20 01:35:17 2015 UTC,"You must have a short memory. I recall about 4 games last year where we went 0-3-1 with all four of our starting running backs out with injuries last year. I'd rather not have to start Darren Reaves. Insurance at that position is important for a run-first offense, imo."
panthers,3dveh8,young__sandwich,4,Mon Jul 20 03:44:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I mean what do you want to do put 7 roster spots for RB's in case the first 6 get hurt again? That was an anomaly, you can't be prepared for that. We already have a full stable of RB's."
panthers,3dveh8,Reneau,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:51:38 2015 UTC,"I'm confused about the seven roster spots. I see J-Stew, Fozzy, CAP, and Tolbert. Maybe Todman based on the strength of his ST play. Has Reaves done much in our time with us to think that a veteran couldn't come in and out-perform him? I certainly don't think so."
panthers,3dveh8,Reneau,6,Mon Jul 20 03:55:33 2015 UTC,"7 was an exaggeration on my part, but the point is we already have 4-6 RB's and signing more is only going to hurt our roster by limiting depth at positions where we need it more. Last year wasn't normal, that was bad luck and if we go into this year assuming Stew, Fozzy, Cap, and Tolbert are all going to be hurt at the same time AGAIN then we're limiting the roster because of an anomaly."

panthers,3dveh8,young__sandwich,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:37:16 2015 UTC,"I understand your concern on this one and I'm not in love with all the downvotes for asking a question. I think this team's good on depth as far as what they'll take into the season.  If all goes as expected, they're going to have to cut a talented, rosterable RB.    RB isn't a sure thing necessarily.  Yes, you're 100% correct that this team can't survive without good RB work, and they might not get as lucky the next time they might need a guy compared to what they got in both Ogbonnaya and Whittaker last year (there was another guy, right?  He didn't work as well).    But you can't ever be fully prepared for that type thing.  You keep your best guys, and you know who you'd sign next.  Last year they lost their top two RB to multiple weeks of injury, the top replacements got hurt, and they had near-catstrophe at FB, too.  That was fairly close to the worst case scenario.    TL:DR on that last bit - most likely, things will regress toward the mean (so, fewer injuries, and if they pickup a backup, he might not contribute as much)."
panthers,3dveh8,young__sandwich,0,Mon Jul 20 12:40:33 2015 UTC,It's my dream to see Chris Johnson back up Stewart but I know it's very unlikely. I don't know what it'd cost to sign him but probably more than we would pay
panthers,3dveh8,young__sandwich,-4,Sun Jul 19 23:02:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your points, everyone. I will note, since nobody else has taken note, that we went 4 games without our top three HB's and our FB for seven games. I know everyone seems to love our RB core, but this is a position that sees a lot of injuries over the course of the season. J-Stew hasn't played a full season in six years. Fozzy was hurt for a while last year, as well as DeAngelo...all at the same time. We want 0-3-1 during that span.   I think pulling in another veteran in the unit would be smart, especially since most of the FA left aren't going to come anywhere near breaking the bank on a one year contract. This provides another year for our fifth round draft pick and our UDFA pick up from last year, to either develop more or prove that they're ready to handle snaps if J-Stew goes down (again).   Last pre-season I was so high on our RB core and thought they were going to dominate. This year I'm more suspect."

Yeah, he's got muscle, yeah he's in good shape, buy you can look at him and tell he could be in better shape.  And you have to ask yourself, is he preparing 100%, physically?  Doesn't appear so.

I'm actually a Panthers fan (used to write fanposts for Cat Scratch Reader in college actually), and having been watching him develop his whole career and get just as frustrated when people say things like he can't read a defense or produce from the pocket. I defend him any chance I can get.   Thanks for reading the rankings!"
panthers,3dqc3d,sruiz59,4,Sat Jul 18 15:31:42 2015 UTC,"I really liked how you based your ranking on objective measures like accuracy, arm strength, athleticism, pocket presence, field vision, and pre-snap reads. Other QB rankings are just too subjective, like MMQB's ranking which had Cam ranked behind Carson Palmer who is on his 3rd team in 5 years.  With better footwork and mechanics, what do you think Cam's accuracy rating can improve to next year?"
panthers,3dqc3d,sruiz59,4,Sat Jul 18 16:08:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say 7.5/8 is his ceiling. He started out the year completing 63% of his passes and I think his body just wasn't right in that middle stretch where his accuracy really fell off a cliff.   Obviously injuries played a big role in his mechanics. People don't realize his throwing wrist was banged up too last season. He had it wrapped for about two months. So think about it, he had a lower body injury (the ankle), a torso injury (the ribs) and an arm injury (the wrist) while playing with one reliable receiver (I love Benjamin, but he was either making a great play or doing something really bad) and an awful/patchwork offensive line. Is anyone really surprised his comp. % dropped like it did?"

So I would say I am least confident and committed to my evaluations of them -- especially Mariota because of the system. At least I got to see Winston doing things he will do at the next level. I actually planned on using Mettenberger for the Titans but my editor wanted Mariota.    It took a lot of projecting with those two, but I put in the work to get the best evaluation of them as I could."

panthers,3dqc3d,BOATSANDHOEZ,3,Sat Jul 18 16:13:00 2015 UTC,"Anytime I hear critiques of Cam I almost always see the writer completely eclipse his running skill set, or just lightly acknowledge it saying Cam is very athletic.  That is an understatement. Only like 3-4 running backs have more rushing touchdowns than Cam since 2011. That's saying a lot about a level of play Cam has that only 2-3 other QBs in the league come close to comparing."

It's my opinion, but I don't think it's fair to hate a player because they get hurt too often. If he didn't do anything to rehab or try hard to stay on the field I'd agree, but for a guy who has been hurt for two seasons, he's closer to a TD than a Haynesworth which is all you can ask for."

panthers,3dnr6a,cucumbinator123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:35:02 2015 UTC,"How about this; if he stays healthy, and plays 16 games, whilst rushing for 1200yds/9TD, I will buy you a J-Stew jersey on the condition you have to take a picture wearing it.  His injury history bugs me, too. But I have a feeling he is fully healthy, and a fully healthy J-Stew is a very, very, VERY good RB. Hating him because of injuries isn't something I can support. I'm curious, how did you feel about Davis when he tore his ACL 3 years in a row?    No offense/trolling intended my friend, my bet is genuine and my question about Davis is genuine curiousity."

panthers,3dsp6u,G_Thirty,11,Sun Jul 19 02:39:46 2015 UTC,But to the Panthers he's totally a legend. He took us to the Super Bowl. He may not be an NFL legend but he is a huge part of the Panther franchise.

I agree he was a huge part of the franchise but that doesn't make him a legend (as I have said, IMO). Legend to me is reserved for very very few people. Mills is a Panther legend, Smith was and I know most Panthers still love him but not sure he is considered a legend to me still I can't decide. If every QB that ever made it to a Super Bowl was considered a team legend then Kerry Collins would be a NY Giants legend and Rex Grossman would be a Chicago Bears legend.

panthers,3dm31u,pantherfanalex,60,Fri Jul 17 11:09:48 2015 UTC,Falcons are smart to show respect.  We should be smart to not get cocky.
panthers,3dm31u,Bob_Fucking_Ross,7,Fri Jul 17 14:15:13 2015 UTC,well said
panthers,3dm31u,Slamela,2,Fri Jul 17 20:53:53 2015 UTC,Ehhh... It's not like us fans have an impact on the game. When it comes to talking smack with my Falcon buddy you bet I'm cocky and obnoxious.
panthers,3dm31u,PerCR,15,Sat Jul 18 00:58:13 2015 UTC,"As a Falcons fan, the only true questions I have about your team are Cam's accuracy (which can improve) and LT (which can be offset by Cam's legs).  You can't sleep on the panthers."
panthers,3dm31u,The_Real_PFL,14,Fri Jul 17 15:01:01 2015 UTC,Those are the same questions we have too...hopefully neither will be painfully evident in 2015.
panthers,3dm31u,biggin528,5,Fri Jul 17 15:16:21 2015 UTC,"Well we did draft two ~6'5"" guys, plus there's Olsen. Basically telling Cam it's okay to throw high haha. ;)  Really though, the league should be wary. He is healthy."
panthers,3dm31u,Shockum,5,Fri Jul 17 22:03:26 2015 UTC,He is healthy.   People forget how scary Cam can be when he's healthy.    I'm more optimistic this preseason than I have been in many years.
panthers,3dm31u,appgrad22,5,Sat Jul 18 03:08:58 2015 UTC,"A healthy Cam like his rookie season, and with the added experience?   You and me both."

panthers,3dm31u,that_guy_you_kno,2,Fri Jul 17 22:40:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I couldn't think of heights so I used ~6'5"" which really translates to approximately that height. I know they're both taller than normal receivers and both he and Benji can jump high too - correct me if I'm wrong. Can't remember exact breakdowns after Funchess was picked."
panthers,3dm31u,Shockum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:12:07 2015 UTC,Ok i really hate to be that guy but Benji has terrible hops. But yeah i get what you mean. Ive just heard a lot of fans say Funchess is as big as kelvin. He isnt. Defnitely not.

Last season was not a representative of the team we are, we got lucky that the rest of the NFC South was bad, but we had an absolutelt awful off-season last year compared to this one, teams shouldn't brush us off. I like that they are though, we're quietly getting better and no one wants to notice or respect it, but they'll be forced to soon enough"
panthers,3dm31u,Battmans_Hooters,5,Fri Jul 17 16:08:40 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, a very accurate article. Watch out NFC!!"

Even worse that I'll never, ever, ever show that same level of respect to the Falcons.   Get the fuck off our nuts, subreddit, and field."
panthers,3dm31u,PacmanInYourFace,2,Fri Jul 17 11:26:11 2015 UTC,I'm not surprised. I expect Falcons fans and media to be more up to speed with divisional rivals than the national press.

But, at least we're being talked about. The team that really scares me in the NFCS and no one is talking about are the Bucs. They're a QB away from being very very good. Falcons and Saints are done.

Frank Garcia drives me nuts, and I can't stand Chris Kroeger. I've heard Chris Kroeger say some of the dumbest things that make no sense.   I'd have to say Colin and Nate are the best show on 610, followed by the MacAttack. QCB is hilarious, though. And I'll listen to Prime Time just for him, the Whiners, and then change it."
panthers,3dmatz,Sinestro1982,2,Fri Jul 17 15:21:51 2015 UTC,"Haha I love Kroeger. He is just very passionate about the Panthers and it gets me pumped up for the season.

Appreciate what he says because you're likely not ever going to hear another personality who can border on the FCC cusp of a major public network radio show like he can and get away with it.  He's like a good tenured professor. He can do what he wants because he did his time and has earned it."

panthers,3dmatz,kane926,2,Fri Jul 17 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"I would listen to the Mac Attack more, but I generally find myself listening to Mike & Mike.   Typically I'm at work when Colin & Nate are on. And usually catch the end of Bustin Loose. Garcia and Yarbs are alright. Frank can give some decent insight to the league and can tell he loves the Panthers. But, man he's a diehard Dookie.   I can't remember the show before Primetime. Maybe it was The Drive? Was a GREAT show before one host left for his own show on Sirius, then spiraled down before the other host moved to Atlanta.   Primetime is good as well. Love Kroeger especially since he's an ASU alum (like me). Gotta find out but I think we were there around the same time. He does let his emotions get the best of him sometimes though. QCB...love that guy.   Generally keep it on 730 in the morning for Mike & Mike and Cowherd, then jump over to 610 after that."

Being the GM for years in Carolina allows him to give insight on processes and information for every aspect of football and Panthers football that you won't hear from others.  He can get interviews with players that other people can't because he drafted them.  One example being last year at training camp D Will wouldn't interview with anyone butl Hurney when he was in Wofford to do show.  Olsen has a spot every Tuesday during the season.  Granted I don't care to hear him talk about other sports, but if he is talking Panthers football, I'm tuned in."

panthers,3dklpf,BananaGooP,7,Fri Jul 17 00:57:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to put this in the post because I thought it was a little overly bias and probably won't happen, but I believe the line-up could look like CB1: Norman CB2: Houston NB:Benwikere and the back ups could be Garry Peters, Charles Tillman(Due to not wanting to over exert him early in the season) and Melvin White looking in from the outside simply because Peters reminds me of Bene in the fact that the doubts people have towards him are easily fixable(to an extent) and he could legitimately do well it all depends on how hard he works."
panthers,3dklpf,MisterRandyMarsh,6,Fri Jul 17 01:26:35 2015 UTC,"Couple of things:  I'd be surprised if Peters doesn't make the 53 man roster. He was a highly coveted UDFA and Gettleman knows all too well about players getting scooped up off the practice squad. Also, PFF gave him a favorable review.  I don't think Bene will line up as a slot corner as much once Thompson gets up to speed. I expect Tillman to start the season at CB2 with Bene in the slot, with Bene moving outside for one reason or another by the end of the year.  The secondary (and defense in general) has a lot more quality depth than the team has had in quite a long time. If Norman plays the way he did at the end of the year last year, we're going to win a lot of games in 2015."
panthers,3dklpf,young__sandwich,3,Fri Jul 17 02:37:41 2015 UTC,"I agree he should make it but it would also be a little weird to see him make the cut over anyone besides Melvin white, Carrington byndom and Lou young. McDermott will try and keep bene in the slot as long as he possibly can because of how well he plays there but bene could break out of the slot if Tillman and Houston both can't play up to speed on the outside"
panthers,3dklpf,skippapotamus,2,Fri Jul 17 13:14:02 2015 UTC,I 100% agree with this.
panthers,3dklpf,biggin528,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"I really don't think I'd see any football team use Tillman as a backup early in the season.    I also think, sure, Houston is a decent corner, but the only thing keeping Benwikere from starting is Tillman.  BB is a very good slot guy but I really don't believe in this concept that he can't play outside corner.   He did last year at a very high level - I get RR's want for some length and speed outside, sure.  But in a head to head, I don't know Houston wins.   In my mind, if there's any concern for weekly reps by Tillman, I'd start Benwikere in base and sub in Tillman/Houston outside in nickel. Not likely to happen, but seems like a reasonable way to limit his workload."
panthers,3dklpf,uniquecannon,3,Mon Jul 20 15:23:24 2015 UTC,"Nice work!  Top-5 in the league for Norman is a gutsy call, haha.  I have learned to love him, though.  He was my least favorite player on the team in 2013 and now I actually like him, crazy.  What do you think will happen with Bene if we end up playing a lot less nickel in favor of keeping Shaq on the field?  What do you think his odds are to steal the second outside CB spot?  Also, PM me about this ""surprise"" we have that I have no idea about!"
panthers,3dklpf,biggin528,3,Fri Jul 17 02:41:44 2015 UTC,"One reason, Bene has more experience and proven worth than a snap-less Shaq. When we need someone on the field who can make the plays needed, i.e. 3rd and long, I see us going nickel 4 times out of 5. Shaq will probably see the field more on run/short pass plays."
panthers,3dklpf,young__sandwich,2,Fri Jul 17 02:56:54 2015 UTC,Norman can be considered top 10 in 2014 while he had 8 penalties called against him so if he improves his cool headedness even more and learns a thing or two from Tillman I wouldn't hesitate to put him up there with the elite corners  If we play less nickel I wouldn't be surprised if they shifted Tillman to a safety/corner hybrid to replace harper on a good amount of downs just so they can keep bene on the field. The other thing is they could continue to play a lot of nickel and have Thompson or Davis play a more safety based role to keep the best players out there.  I also think bene should end up on the outside but it will really come down to how Tillman and Houston play. Regardless bene will see the field plenty this season
panthers,3djryr,MikeAdamsNC,11,Thu Jul 16 20:58:59 2015 UTC,I'd argue some of the picks at various spots but I think Cam at 10 is probably about right for what he's done so far in the league.
panthers,3djryr,biggin528,2,Thu Jul 16 21:57:40 2015 UTC,I thought so too.   Was somewhat surprised that he was one ahead of Stafford.   Cam getting some credit.
panthers,3djryr,the_nix,4,Fri Jul 17 11:50:38 2015 UTC,This is pretty accurate. I wouldn't see him ever over #5 unless he won a couple Super Bowls for us.
panthers,3djryr,Angry_Apollo,7,Thu Jul 16 22:13:25 2015 UTC,FTFY:    unless he won a couple Super Bowls for us   until he wins
panthers,3djryr,ACraftyRooster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:25:47 2015 UTC,"Hard to do that when you're the most hit/sacked QB within 4 years of the league.  And still, somehow, set rushing and passing records on the way. And while having a reasonably bad drop rate in the, albeit young, receiving corp..  Cam was really efficient in the first few games this year, until injuries and drops abound started occurring.   On top of that, let's not forget how awful the playcalling was this year. In his career, Shula has been pretty inept at running offenses. How he has the job on our team, I don't know."
panthers,3djryr,BashfulTurtle,3,Fri Jul 17 00:33:33 2015 UTC,"Bradshaw is way too high then again he is one or the most overrated players of all time imo. Steelers won 4 super bowls with him as the QB....but A LOT Of that had to do with the defense around him as well as the receivers. He never once threw for 4,000 yards and only over 3,000 twice. Which is amazing considering the WR's he had and as much as he was on the field with the Steal Curtain getting him the ball"
panthers,3djryr,MMA_PITBULL,3,Fri Jul 17 12:55:52 2015 UTC,"I think Cam's rookie numbers really showed you what he could do, and the fact that they just resigned him has me believing that they think the issues on the team is inexperience in the offense, not injuries.  It shouldn't be a surprise if he moves up this list.  Now, not to knock Andrew Luck, but the Colts are easily in the worst division in football, going to the playoffs two of the three years in a row is nearly attributable to not missing the bus on the way to the game.  That isn't to knock some of his huge wins, or say that Cam deserves to be higher, but I don't understand the praise for going to the playoffs (outside of his rookie season).  And don't get me started on Eli Manning..."
panthers,3djryr,hanz333,2,Fri Jul 17 17:09:19 2015 UTC,I completely agree about the AFC south...but Luck shows up against serious competition too. I can't wait to see him and Cam duking it out on the same field this year.
panthers,3djryr,SpaceIsAPlace,2,Fri Jul 17 17:30:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the worst team in the NFC South even through these rough years (and let's not kid ourselves, our division isn't in the best shape) is still getting 4 wins on the season.  In the AFC South though, the last two years had 4 teams (Jacksonville twice) with 4 wins or less (4,3,2 and 2)."

panthers,3dh22m,nikman09,31,Thu Jul 16 05:25:24 2015 UTC,"Justin Houston is a 3-4 OLB and is getting this mega money because of his pass rushing abilities (22 sacks last year). I think a better comparison would be between a 3-4 OLB and a 4-3 DE, like Greg Hardy or CJ. This is the type of money we would have had to pay Hardy.  Luke is still going to get paid big time, just not that much. MLBs just don't make as much as pass rushers. I'm predicting Luke will get around $12M/year, maybe a 6 year $72M contract.  I'm not worried about our salary cap all that much. We're in great shape for the future with Gman at the helm. The salary cap is skyrocketing the next few years, we're getting out of salary cap hell by getting all the dead money back from the Hurney contracts, and Gman doesn't splurge frivolously in free agency like other teams do (Saints, Broncos, etc.). Also, don't forget that in 2-3 years, there will be a couple of expensive contracts off the books (or re-structured) like CJ, TD, Stew, and Kalil."
panthers,3dh22m,biggin528,10,Thu Jul 16 05:44:41 2015 UTC,"As much as I think Luke would deserve it anyways, $12m/year is a bit steep.  The highest paid ILB in the league right now is at $9.5m/year.  A jump like that redefines the market (as did the Houston deal).  The average of the top-5 highest paid ILBs is like $8.75m/year.  Even with a 20% increase, which is huge, it puts him around $10.5m.  I'd say $12m/year is an absolute maximum with ~$10.5 to $11m/year being a more realistic number."
panthers,3dh22m,naelcamo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:34:08 2015 UTC,Agree with everything except 12 Mil a year still sounds a bit low...
panthers,3dh22m,nikman09,12,Thu Jul 16 06:25:52 2015 UTC,"A $12M/year contract would easily make Luke the highest paid inside linebacker in the NFL, which he completely deserves."
panthers,3dh22m,naelcamo,4,Thu Jul 16 06:35:18 2015 UTC,Legit. Somehow thought beason was on like 10mil/yr a while back but was obviously wrong.
panthers,3dh22m,TomNJ,6,Thu Jul 16 06:50:30 2015 UTC,Luke will definitely be the highest paid MLB in the league but the ability to rush the quarterback translates into mega bucks these days.

panthers,3dh22m,ghostofmartyhurney,2,Thu Jul 16 15:05:29 2015 UTC,Luke won't even sniff $16m/yr. He'll probably get $13m/yr.

Depends on if anyone sets the market at some ridiculous number for MLBs with a surprise extension. Can't think of any top-shelf 4-3 guys in line for a deal in that range atm besides Luke, and if there is I wouldn't be too surprised if their agents are counselling them to wait for Luke to set the market."

panthers,3detj7,G_Thirty,7,Wed Jul 15 22:49:56 2015 UTC,"A big reason why the team's value is so high is because they actually own the stadium. As far as I know, the Panthers are the only team in the division that owns their own stadium, which is why the team ranks higher than the other NFCS teams.  The PSL's also play a big part in increasing the value of the team. PSL owners essentially sell out the games before the tickets are made available to the public."

The first TD that Benji caught. It showed that the Panthers were right in their pick. It was a spectacular catch. And it gave us hope that we might have a true #1 receiver on the team. That was huge.  If you want a big play with impact, Luke tipped the ball in the Arizona playoff game and Tre Boston caught it in the end zone to secure the win. That was pretty huge. (It's also the last play in the video below.)  To be fair, nothing last year approached the Hixon catch the year before. But I bet there are a bunch of Luke and TD tackles that are crazy sweet to watch."

They were coming off a six game losing streak and absolutely had to win in order to salvage what remained of their season and booooooooy did they ever.  The play that really galvanized the team was when Cam ran one in himself from the 1-yard line and both teams got in a massive shoving match. To me, that was the single most important play of the season. After this win they would close out the season with three straight victories more and host a home playoff win."

So lets just be safe and call it 10 games.    That's 758 people in the box each game. The boxes aren't that big...    Up the cost to $100 pp and lets assume 10% chip in (to keep the dollars the same) - you still have 76 people in the box each game, too many.    Up the cost to $1000 pp and 1% - now we're getting somewhere. There might even be enough room for some people to go to more than one game...    Edit: sorry guys."

Finally, there is a bit of wiggle room if Gettleman wanted to go ahead and put a long term deal in place for Luke or maybe Norman? I'm not sure what those deal ranges are off the top of my head."
panthers,3d94o3,ryanswo07,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:43:12 2015 UTC,"Luke will be 10mil+/year and that is a pretty optimistic threshold for our end.  I think the current highest paid LB in the league is around 9mil, but that could have changed since I last knew."
panthers,3d94o3,kingbowsa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:14:08 2015 UTC,"That was until today. Justin Houston just got a monster deal. 6years $101 million with I think $53 million guaranteed. Highest paid Chief in their history, and highest paid linebacker in NFL history."
panthers,3d94o3,Shockum,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"Clay Matthews makes $13,200,000 / yr but a 3-4 OLB is really a different position."
panthers,3d94o3,MisterRandyMarsh,2,Tue Jul 14 22:36:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the number I'm thinking of was probably MLB specific."
panthers,3d94o3,kingbowsa,8,Wed Jul 15 01:51:10 2015 UTC,My understanding is anything we don't use rolls over into next year. Gettlemagic might be piggybanking it for Luke.
panthers,3d94o3,hadisious,9,Tue Jul 14 14:28:39 2015 UTC,My hope is that we get long term deals with Luke and Norman done. There's also Star and Short to consider.
panthers,3d94o3,BlindWillieJohnson,3,Tue Jul 14 17:40:24 2015 UTC,"Yep, I figure we're saving so we can sign Luke long term, and still be active in free agency.  Really next year is when we're going t need to roll over a lot though, as we're going to need to sign Star and KK in 2017."
panthers,3d94o3,SickBurnBro,3,Tue Jul 14 15:50:13 2015 UTC,Don't we have to sign short next year? I know with star we can do the player option since he was first rounder? Or am I completely wrong?
panthers,3d94o3,Jeracur,3,Tue Jul 14 17:29:38 2015 UTC,"Star and KK were from the 2013 draft. Their rookie deals go through the 2016 season. Star we have a 5th year option on for 2017, KK we do not.   It seems like a long way off, but if both of them keep playing at a high level, they might both need 7-9 mil per year contracts. That's why we better get Luke signed and start saving."
panthers,3d94o3,SickBurnBro,2,Tue Jul 14 17:42:22 2015 UTC,I like the way you think
panthers,3d94o3,pantherfanalex,2,Tue Jul 14 19:46:34 2015 UTC,I believe as long as we spend 89% of our total cap we're good. I also think we might have to spend a certain percentage over a three year span but I could be wrong.
panthers,3d94o3,arcangel092,3,Wed Jul 15 02:17:02 2015 UTC,I thought I remembered something like we pretty much have to spend all our total cap for about the next 2-3 years to meet the minimum that was set during the same CBA that allowed us to roll money into future years (mostly because of all of our dead money).
panthers,3d94o3,NSA_Mailhandler,3,Tue Jul 14 16:13:43 2015 UTC,"Might pick up a guy or three after training camp cuts, but they'll be extremely cheap.  The majority of the pile will either be retained for injury replacements or rolled over to next year presumably."
panthers,3d94o3,Aurion7,3,Tue Jul 14 16:34:55 2015 UTC,We have Luke's contract coming up and a decision to make on whether or not to sign Josh Norman to a big contract. I'm sure a part of that extra space is being devoted to those.
panthers,3d94o3,irspangler,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:04:40 2015 UTC,I would hold on to it. Under the new CBA unused cap space rolls over to the next year.

panthers,3d9qna,The_Chrononaut,6,Tue Jul 14 18:55:15 2015 UTC,At the same time it kinda reads like:  Cam Newton  Is on the team and wears #1.  Derek Anderson  Is still on the team and doesn't wear #1.  He started twice last year.  Joe Webb  Is still on the team.

panthers,3d5rip,SpaceIsAPlace,4,Mon Jul 13 21:19:00 2015 UTC,The carolina panthers have the best 1st season record for any expansion team (1995 (7-9)) or Sir Purr has 1 return for 0 yards? Or the panthers have won the most NFC South crowns? Or the Panthers used to be in the NFC West? Or the panthers are the first team to have 2 rushers over 1100 yards? (DeAngelo and Stewart) Tell me you didn't know at least one of those.
panthers,3d5rip,nutt_butter_baseball,5,Mon Jul 13 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"Sir Purr has 1 return for 0 yards   If you go by stats alone, we have the GOAT mascot."

panthers,3d5wof,Green89,7,Mon Jul 13 19:46:53 2015 UTC,Cameron Artis-Payne.
panthers,3d5wof,biggin528,3,Mon Jul 13 19:56:25 2015 UTC,Man I can't wait to see what Artis-Payne does this season. I'm a huge Auburn fan and the Panthers are my second team so it's gonna be interesting to see Newton and CAP in the same backfield. Do you think you guys will be running the option a lot or no because of Cam's health scares in the past?
panthers,3d5wof,CooperEarly,3,Tue Jul 14 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"We definitely will.  It's how Cam plays.  Gettleman said something this off season when asked a similar question about changing Cams style of play now that he has a huge cap hit.  His response was: ""He's got to be Cam. You don't hold back a thoroughbred, you don't.""  So I don't think our approach with him is going to change drastically any time soon, haha."
panthers,3d5wof,biggin528,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:44:50 2015 UTC,"He's actually really hyped for CAP, but he's pretty buried down the depth chart with the way Fozzy played in the stretch. We also try not to predict rookies as sleepers because you just don't know how they'll do until they actually step onto the field."
panthers,3d5wof,biggin528,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:58:52 2015 UTC,True.  Non-rookie I would say...either Trai Turner or Corey Brown.  I don't think we will have many surprises on defense this year.  Not that that's bad...
panthers,3d5wof,Daeavorn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:33:32 2015 UTC,Norwell! Always bet on Norwell.
panthers,3d5wof,biggin528,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:46:31 2015 UTC,I like Norwell too but there's a reason he was a UDFA.  Those reasons will show as he grows.
panthers,3d5wof,Daheixiong,2,Tue Jul 14 00:03:50 2015 UTC,This isn't the NBA. There are many successful UDFAs out there
panthers,3d5wof,biggin528,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:50:32 2015 UTC,And a VERY small portion of elite or highly successful UDFAs play OLine.  It's not very common.
panthers,3d5wof,BlindWillieJohnson,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:42:31 2015 UTC,Plenty of great players were UFDA's. I wholeheartedly reject that a player must be bad just because he went undrafted. Norwell's proven himself against the best.
panthers,3d5wof,biggin528,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:05:43 2015 UTC,I would strongly contest that he's proven himself against the best in less than a full season on the field.  He played well but he is still very unproven.  Edit:  I also never said he would be bad.  I think he's our future at LG (and maybe even LT) but that doesn't mean I think he's the second coming of Jesus.  He is going to have growing pains and he may never be the elite player that so many fans already think he is for some reason.
panthers,3d5wof,Daeavorn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:40:06 2015 UTC,Do you know why he was a UDFA? I actually do.
panthers,3d5wof,vroomery,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:47:51 2015 UTC,Ok I'll ask. Why?
panthers,3d5wof,Daeavorn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:50:02 2015 UTC,He wasn't drafted due to low reps at 225 in the weight room. He had strength concerns. If he had more issues than that I can't say but that is one main reason.
panthers,3d5wof,vroomery,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:15:57 2015 UTC,Cool thanks for the info. I like him as well. Hopefully he'll be a good fit at LG going forward.
panthers,3d5wof,Daeavorn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:28:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I trust in the Gettleman.
panthers,3d5wof,biggin528,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:31:22 2015 UTC,Yeah low bench reps in a single workout is not a reason to go undrafted.  He was a 5th round projection prior to his proday workout and a 6th rounde projection after that.  He still went undrafted by 32 teams.  There is something to it more than just how many reps he did on the bench press that one day...

panthers,3d5wof,SixMileDrive,3,Wed Jul 15 01:07:13 2015 UTC,"Hey guys,  We're doing a series on potential sleepers for every NFL team, and a Panthers fan decided he wanted to take a shot at doing the NFC South. I suggested he do Remmers/Norwell, but he's pretty in love with Philly.  If you guys could only pick one sleeper from the Panthers to do well next season, who would it be? You have a LOT of options, this team's stacked with young talent. Which bodes badly for me, seeing as I have a bet we'll do better than you next year haha."
panthers,3d5wof,AbsurdSpud,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:48:27 2015 UTC,Brown might be sick too far down the depth chart to put up big numbers. Funches could blow it out of the water this year.
panthers,3d5wof,aceboogieville,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:06:04 2015 UTC,"I don't see that being an issue with Brown unless the staff doesn't see a future in him. Hopefully Benji and Funchess lock down the 1/2, that really only leaves Cotchery and Ginn for Brown to compete with.   I think Ginn will get some looks as a deep threat but he won't be our WR3. Cotchery probably starts the year at WR3 just cause he's more durable and reliable(at this time) than Brown, but I think Brown takes over early. He had a pretty good rapport with Cam without too many snaps, he's quick and it seems like he has the ability to get open. Only problem is can he handle a whole season and stay on the field.  I'm with you though, I really hope Funchess is our sleeper/breakout player."
panthers,3d5wof,arcangel092,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:23:32 2015 UTC,Hmm a sleeper? How about AJ Klein.
panthers,3d5wof,mrpasquini,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:00:23 2015 UTC,"Artis-Payne has a shot. Stew is definitely going to get injured because that is the way he works, so Artis-Payne will start at least 4 games for my money. The opportunity could be enough for him but i'm not sure how good he is exactly."
panthers,3d5wof,karmal0vesyou,4,Mon Jul 13 22:26:05 2015 UTC,Frank Alexander could be worth a look. I like spreading the gospel of Corey (philly) to the rest of the NFL.

panthers,3d388d,mattpacman96,11,Mon Jul 13 08:34:31 2015 UTC,"It's a realistic ceiling for sure. The only teams we will for sure struggle against are likely away games with NO and ATL, away against SEA, and vs GB. The Colts have a soft defense and Luck throws picks, the Eagles have a brand new team with a lack of experience at the receiver position, the Cowboys don't have a rb and their defense is up in the air, New York has a questionable defense and o-line, Houston doesn't have a QB, and TB doesn't have an o-line. We can beat every team we play and only have bad match-ups against a few teams. 12-4 is certainly possible if most things go our way."

If that happens, the only teams that have a surefire ability to beat us are the Packers, Seahawks, and Cowboys. The Colts' defense does not scare me and if we can play elite D, we can take that one. The Eagles are an enigma. I'll hold out judgement until they start playing and we see what they look like since they are bye-and-large a brand new squad.  The Texans game is a darkhorse concern. I can see us dropping that one if we can't stop their pass rush. I can see the Giants lighting up the scoreboard, but I can also see us winning that won in an offensive shootout."

panthers,3d4q25,nikman09,6,Mon Jul 13 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"And /r/panthers is probably one of their highest sources of clicks considering how many people here like to get riled up about every negative opinion around the internet and complain about it here.   Also, the comment by /u/nikman09 quotes the one part where he says the article will garner a lot of clicks but leaves out the whole rest of the quote stating that he was purposely playing devils advocate to generate discussion. Does cherry picking quotes really make us as readers any better than him as the writer?"
panthers,3d4q25,enfyte416,3,Mon Jul 13 16:47:08 2015 UTC,"He makes compelling points and it's factually accurate. But the thing is, you can't hold it against a team for beating bad competition. That's what good teams do, they beat bad teams. He eclipsed the mid-season roster changes and almost never mentioned the defense. The purpose of the piece is obviously to be hyper-critical, but hey, maybe it should serve to ground out the fan base and find the truth somewhere in between this rather scathing article and the fan's unrealistic optimism."
panthers,3d4q25,Spiralyst,2,Mon Jul 13 18:44:48 2015 UTC,"Doubtful that our fan base will stop being so optimistic. That's what fans do. I tend to take a much more realistic and objective approach but fans like to find any little thing they can to say that our team has improved. I just dislike the way Panthers fans do it. 90% of sports media and analysts think we won't make the playoffs but they are so stubborn that they think it's some sort of smear campaign, or that every analyst has a vendetta against us rather than just seeing that it is a fairly widely held opinion. It's tiring to look at."
panthers,3d4q25,enfyte416,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"It's not fun not being overly optimistic. That's what fans are for. But with that being said, it's okay to absorb criticism about you team to have a more realistic expectation for their performance. This can temper the suffering when the team doesn't live up to expectations and provide some happy surprises when your team exceeds them."
panthers,3d4q25,Spiralyst,3,Tue Jul 14 00:29:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess it's not a particularly fun way to look at things. Part of my time in college I spent writing sports columns for the newspaper and being on my schools radio station and one thing that is pretty constant is that you need to stay as objective as possible in those fields. I think that's probably where it comes from.
panthers,3d4q25,enfyte416,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:17:12 2015 UTC,"Here's the rest of his post:   ""Every article I’ve ever written for CSR has been optimistic, and heaping tons of praise on Dave Gettleman. I thought I’d take a look from the other perspective. Roughly 75% of the article is observation, I backed up most of what I said with accurate information. it’s just the point of view that’s setting everyone off. I’m pleased with the results. Lets see if I can get over 1,500 people to tell me I’m wrong in the poll. Those here who really know me at this point, know I’m expecting big things this year.""   So, he titles his article ""The Panthers Are Not a Playoff Caliber Team,"" admits he works for SB Nation which needs clicks for business, and then admits he's playing devil's advocate to ""generate discussion."" It's most definitely a click-bait article.  This is the type of article you would expect from NFL.com or David Newton. Just because he wrote a bunch of optimistic articles doesn't justify him writing a click-bait article. One of the main reasons people come to /r/panthers, CSR, and BBR is to avoid click-bait articles."

Also, he never says that he works for SB nation. He said his article probably got a lot of clicks for SB nation. From what I understand, SB nation is a series of blogs and CSR is the one where Panthers fans can post. I doubt this Mitchell Apple guy is getting paid for this article and if he is it's probably incredibly minimal. According to SB Nations web site only Site managers and very few contributors get paid so this guy didn't just post clickbait in order to make money. You are taking his quote way out of context."

panthers,3d4q25,ThisDerpForSale,8,Mon Jul 13 18:18:14 2015 UTC,"Some thoughts on this...piece, here.  1) We're a rebuilding team. Free agent acquisitions aren't as important to us as keeping the talent we have. Last year, we found a lot of great talent late, and we've kept every bit of it. And since you seem to be familiar with our free agent lot last year, I'd love to hear what pro-bowl contenders you'd have brought in with the dollar store budget that Gettleman had to work with. I bet it's really easy to do his job from the cheap seats.  2) Trade Cam Newton? Are you insane? Sure, we'd have gotten picks, but God only knows how long it would take to find another QB of his caliber. I mean, he's not perfect but you don't willingly turn yourself into the Cleveland Browns because your QB isn't.  3) This team was 12-4 one season ago. Is that so easy to forget? Sure, last year was tough, but last year saw the departure of our entire secondary, all of our wideouts, three retirements at o-line including two guards and our pro-bowl left tackle and the season long suspension of our top pass rusher. And we didn't have the cap space to replace even a fraction of that talent. Do you think we started Jason Avant, Antoine Cason and Byron Bell because we wanted to? No team or coach in the NFL could go through that level of roster turnover and come out without a huge step backward.   4) Of course no coaches were fired. We have an FO that understands the predicament we were after the roster turnover. And given that, it's amazing that we still won the division. We beat teams like the Falcons who'd we'd lost to (narrowly, I'll add. That was the first sign of the team starting to right the ship) and the Saints who'd absolutely demolished us before. That's a sign of progress. We played the Seahawks tough in the playoffs, and while Lindley gave us a freebie victory, both the 9ers and Seahawks faced him at the end of the season, and neither held them to just 69 total yards of offense.  5) Gettleman's draft have always been questioned, and the talent he's brought in has always delivered. 3 starters in 2013 and a whopping 5 in 2014, including a 1,000 yard rookie receiver, two pro-bowl caliber defensive tackles and a CB that widely regarded as the steal of his draft, and you still want to throw Thompson in his face? Shit, there's a good chance that our 4th round pick at OT will be a starter, because that's the sort of value we've gotten used to in the Gettleman administration. He has earned the benefit of the doubt and then some.  6) Fuck your clickbait bullshit. I shouldn't even take the time to argue all this. Can we ""remember this article"" too?"
panthers,3d4q25,BlindWillieJohnson,3,Mon Jul 13 15:57:42 2015 UTC,"Regarding Point #5, this is what he said   ""Then in the draft Dave goes on to trade away multiple selections to draft questionable ""tweeners"" with bad measurables who may struggle to find a role on the field.""   If measurables were what determined success for young players in the NFL, then Stephen Hill (6'4/215/4.36 40) would have been our #2 WR in the playoffs while Philly Brown (5'11/179/4.51 40) would have been on the practice squad.  I'm going to trust the guy that has gotten us 9 starters from the past 2 drafts (Star, KK, KB, Kony, Trai, Boston, Benwikere, Philly, and Norwell) over some armchair talent evaluator."

panthers,3d1ath,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:48:28 2015 UTC,"Fairly accurate, but five overall, especially above the 70s is too off to use it as any basis. The rating are based on how good they are in real life, so just use that. Also, overalls alone hold little value, as made evident how much they fluctuate when you change schemes in connected franchise. The attributes (speed, strength, etc.) should be pretty accurate though. The more direct ones (physical traits) should be within three points or so, and the intangibles should be relatively accurate (i.e. higher man than zone, then he will be rated with higher man than zone)."

No one wants to hear any dissent or you're a racist, which is offensive, but you aren't given the ability to be offended. Lol  just making this post is going to kill my karma. People have falsely married the rebel flag to creating violent racism, which seems awful like reverse bigotry, ironically, because it does nothing to address the problem. I support gay marriage, equal rights, a modern-day hippy that doesn't hold a personal connection between the flag and racism, only ""stickin it to the man"", but no one wants to hear where people like that stand, just one extreme or another.  I find it offensive being labeled a bigot for having that opinion, but this is a convo people clearly seem incapable of having on even terms. Either you're with them or against them, and there's plenty of room on the band wagon to make it a ""black and white"" issue, no pun intended, but absolutely no room for shades of gray in between.

That being said, people are not falsely marrying the confederate flag to racism.  It's inherent, whether or not that is your reason for displaying it.  The flag was brought back to popularity by the KKK, which should tell you enough.  Because of my experience, I don't have much of a problem with the flag for private use.  Sure, some are racist, but some are not.  However, and no matter your thoughts on the flag, I do think it'd be shortsighted to start proudly displaying confederate flags in public, as it really only gives one impression at this point in time.  As with many things, what your personal meaning of what something stands for is irrelevant to society at large.  The flag has long been a symbol of racism to many, and that audience has recently spread and been thrust into public space.  Anyway, just figured I'd chime in with my thoughts to show that even some of us against it don't necessarily see it as black and white, either."

I'm not saying we're the strongest contender but once you're in the playoffs it really is an open playing field and anyone can take it.  The Panthers ended the last season on a strong run.

According to this analysis (from a site I've always found very informative), the Panthers gave up their ability to get a 3rd rounder for Hardy when they signed Jason Trusnik, bringing the gained/lost ration of players to 2/2, meaning that we won't qualify for any compensatory picks next year (or at least, not a 3rd rounder).  Did something change in the last couple of months that I missed?  Because if not, we aren't getting a 3rd round pick.  And, again according to that site, we probably won't get any comp picks."

OTC is usually spot-on with their analysis though so I'd be willing to side with them on the issue over beat writers.    Hindsight is 20/20, though.  At the time, the ruling was that Hardy got a 10-game ban which significantly lowers the chance we would have gotten a comp. pick for him.  Why not sign a valuable asset since we had lost the pick at that point.  Hard to have foreseen his ban getting reduced like this."

panthers,3ctvr2,AbsurdSpud,2,Fri Jul 10 19:12:45 2015 UTC,"Only reason I don't buy that is our D didn't fall to shit when Johnson was out, Hardy didn't get sacks but we were still dominant, but when we played without Hardy we were god awful for months. We couldn't stop the run or pressure the QB, and those are Front 7 problems, and the only difference from the previous season was the loss of Hardy."
panthers,3ctvr2,young__sandwich,2,Fri Jul 10 19:19:19 2015 UTC,"Only reason I don't buy that is our D didn't fall to shit when Johnson was out   This kind of proves it.  He was a product of our system.  We weren't prepared to replace him.  Players were trying to do to much to compensate for his departure (that and our lack luster vets).  But towards the end of the season, things got better, players adjusted.  Now I'm not saying he wasn't a vital piece to our game, or will suck in Dallas, I'm just curious as to how well he'll do in a different system."
panthers,3ctvr2,AbsurdSpud,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:24:06 2015 UTC,"You suggested having CJ on the other side helped. Our D without CJ with Hardy was great, our D without Hardy with CJ was fucking terrible. That doesn't tell me the system works. We turned things around after weeks and weeks of being a joke, and having a much better secondary than anything Hardy ever played with.   I think Hardy is a little overrated, but I think he's one of the more complete DE's in the league and possibly comparable to Michael Bennett."
panthers,3ctvr2,young__sandwich,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:32:34 2015 UTC,"You suggested having CJ on the other side helped.    Can't double team them both.   Our D without CJ with Hardy was great   When do you mean?  2013 when CJ was hurt against TB and Miami?  We crushed TB (as we should) and Miami was closer.  But it's not like Hardy went off in that game.  He only recorded 3 tackles (Cap did pretty good that game).    If you mean through out the season when they're rotating that seems like a bit of a stretch.  If he goes ham in Dallas, then I'm wrong and I underestimated him."
panthers,3ctvr2,AbsurdSpud,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:51:02 2015 UTC,"You're proving my point. Hardy didn't have great stats without CJ but our D didn't suffer, we held the Dolphins to 16 and their RB's only rushed for 16 yards. When Hardy was gone I couldn't fucking care less about his stats cause everyone scored on us and the Steelers had two 100 yard rushers. He could break the single game sack record in that game, and it wouldn't matter.   With CJ and Hardy and a shit secondary our D was elite. Without Cj, with Hardy and a shit secondary our D was elite. Without Hardy with CJ and a shit secondary our D was cringe inducing. Without Hardy with CJ and a good secondary our D was good/maybe great or very good.   I'm not trying to judge CJ here, but I think if you look at the results that there's no current reason to say Hardy was better cause of CJ."

panthers,3cshwb,The_sad_zebra,2,Fri Jul 10 19:24:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sucks. But it's also nice to see how good our power running game is. Now, all we need is for Shula to keep the up tempo, no huddle and we'll be scary this season."
panthers,3cshwb,Sinestro1982,6,Fri Jul 10 12:40:09 2015 UTC,"I think I'm in the minority on here, but I like Shula. He's the play-caller that's right for our offense. All of the players are happy with his play-calling. He does what works with the personnel we have."
panthers,3cshwb,young__sandwich,4,Fri Jul 10 12:48:54 2015 UTC,It seems the general panther fan base is slowly changing it's opinion on Shula.
panthers,3cshwb,that_guy_you_kno,2,Fri Jul 10 15:27:57 2015 UTC,I don't dislike him. I just want some more consistency. I want him to stick with stuff that works.
panthers,3cshwb,skippapotamus,3,Fri Jul 10 13:10:19 2015 UTC,and pls no more hail marry's on 3rd & inches
panthers,3cshwb,MisterRandyMarsh,2,Fri Jul 10 16:50:33 2015 UTC,some of that goes to Cam for taking the one deep route when he has three short options.
panthers,3cshwb,Sinestro1982,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:46:37 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. Shula's run-first philosophy is all about limiting turnovers and controlling time of possession. My main gripe is red zone efficiency, but we'll see how well a healthy Cam does with his giant receivers to work with."
panthers,3cshwb,skippapotamus,4,Fri Jul 10 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"I think it will be better. 6'5, 6'5, 6'5, and 6'4. Then Tolbert and Stewart."
panthers,3cshwb,BananaGooP,2,Fri Jul 10 14:00:50 2015 UTC,"the redzone part was surprising.  Tolbert being out didn't help, but they were really efficient in '13 in general."
panthers,3cshwb,datboijustin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:47:24 2015 UTC,"The problem is Newton isn't a game manager type QB so trying to fit him into situations where he is controlling the clock changes the offense in a more negative way than letting him control the field and manipulate the defense with read-option, play action and no huddle offense"
panthers,3cshwb,datboijustin,2,Fri Jul 10 20:53:20 2015 UTC,The thing is though we can still run no huddle and control the clock. No huddle just means the defense can't make substitutions and Cam can still take all the time off the clock between plays. Ball control is effective for us because of our great defense and it's something I'm really hesitant to try to move away from.
panthers,3cshwb,Sinestro1982,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:55:09 2015 UTC,I like him when he play calls like the final 6 games of the season. I really don't like him when he calls week 3-10.
panthers,3cshwb,datboijustin,3,Fri Jul 10 17:14:40 2015 UTC,"How much was it his playcalling, and how much of it was our injuries? We were pretty healthy the last 6 games of the season. The OC is an easy scapegoat when things don't go well offensively, as is the quarterback. But we know Cam can play, and Shula has a bad record as an OC/HC. So it must be his fault (not saying you think this, but I think a lot of people do)."
panthers,3cshwb,Sinestro1982,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:51:17 2015 UTC,"The injuries were important but my problem was he didn't even try to adjust our gameplan to match our injuries. Atleast that's how it looked. It was like we were on 7th string runningbacks and were still a run,run,pass,punt offense. When I feel like we should have been spreading the field and going for quick passes to protect Cam."
panthers,3cshwb,datboijustin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:06:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the problem is that just because our personnel was different, doesn't mean we could change our offense. Our ""depth"" was created to back up the style of offense we play. It's the same for every team, for the most part. He does what he can with what he has."
panthers,3cshwb,Sinestro1982,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:10:22 2015 UTC,"We didn't have ""depth"" though. We had to sign random runningbacks off the street because we had no other options. Our offense was lackluster at best during that stretch and Cam was taking a beating because we run so many long developing routes. Would have been much better (atleast for Cam's health and probably for our production) to spread the field a bit. Shula's biggest problem is that he never adjusts his gameplan when something isn't working. When we're running the ball well our offense is great but when we aren't and Cam doesn't have time to throw he needs to open it up a bit and spread the defense out to take pressure off Cam and open up running lanes. That's always been my biggest problem with Shula. If he becomes a bit more flexible he could be a good or even excellent offensive coordinator because he is excellent at managing a game when things are going well."
panthers,3cshwb,Daeavorn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:22:41 2015 UTC,Notice that depth is in quotations.
panthers,3cshwb,SpaceIsAPlace,2,Fri Jul 10 19:25:57 2015 UTC,"I, for one, had to laugh at the picture of the panthers just grabbing hobos off the street to hand the ball off to."
panthers,3cshwb,datboijustin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"he didn't even try to adjust our gameplan to match our injuries.    THIS. I mean there's only so much you can do when you're a run first team on your 5th runningback, but still..."
panthers,3cshwb,BananaGooP,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:17:32 2015 UTC,"I know people give Shula a lot of undeserved hate on this sub, you're right that he's an easy scapegoat, but I'm specifically talking about his lack of adjustments to our situation. When everyone is healthy our offense is one of the better ball control offenses in the game and it makes our already great defense even better. I would just like to see more flexibility from him in regards to specific situations. We're on our 7th running back and Cam is playing hobbled behind a terrible O-line? Maybe we call more quick passes and try to get the ball out of his hands faster than the usual run it up the middle twice for 3 yards and then put Cam on a 7 step drop."
panthers,3cshwb,skippapotamus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:52:33 2015 UTC,Personally I don't hate his play-calling. At times it is rough but at other times he does a great job.  The biggest beef I personally have and I think some other fans do is how much he really limits the offense because he doesn't mold the scheme to fit the players he has.
panthers,3cshwb,PIRATEmike221,4,Fri Jul 10 20:51:01 2015 UTC,Another great write up on CSR  Edit: Norwell is a beast pulling.

panthers,3cshwb,JCoxRocks,3,Mon Jul 13 13:36:13 2015 UTC,"To piggy-back on one of the comments on the article, is there a reason we pull Norwell on those all the time? Is it because he's the best as a pulling guard, or maybe because that's who you pull when running to the strong side?"
panthers,3cshwb,Magnuts,2,Fri Jul 10 13:25:02 2015 UTC,That's what I was wondering. I was under the impression that Trai Turner was a great pulling guard. It must be because all of those were strong side runs.
panthers,3cshwb,JaquiskiTaterTartt,2,Fri Jul 10 13:34:12 2015 UTC,I think part of it had to do with Bell not being a great run blocker.

panthers,3cnlog,GP4LEU,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:56:15 2015 UTC,"Eh not really happy with it as you can tell from my username. But it was bound to happen and going to happen anyways, just had the glimmer of hope that it wouldn't. I'm not really a big fan of the return honestly. Kessel is a bonafide scoring machine, he's a lock to score goals, and has arguable the best wrist/snap shot in the NHL. The guy has a similar point output to Patrick Kane, but Kane has a stanley cup winning team feeding him the puck, Kessel had Bozak and partly JVR. Kapanen is raw, probably second line winger, Harrington is probably 2nd-3rd pairing defenseman. The draft picks will turn out the same, essentially swapped picks. (Late 1st, early 2nd). On top of that, they retained salary. Pretty ridiculous. They shipped him out because hes not a Shanahan player, I think in the end it was just a ""get rid of him"" trade, which shouldn't be the case with that level of talent."
panthers,3cnlog,tmoss726,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:42:51 2015 UTC,"I was on vacay back to the motherland (NB) sorry for taking so long to get back to you. I agree it was just a ""get rid of him"" trade and unfortunately everyone knew it was coming so they didn't have much leverage when the time came.

And as far as Limerick's goes I'm definitely coming and meeting you for a game this year."
panthers,3cnlog,M00ndev,6,Tue Jul 21 18:12:01 2015 UTC,"I know this is the panthers sub, but...  You must have loved how cheap the Hurricanes tickets were compared to the flames!"
panthers,3cnlog,unimanboob,3,Thu Jul 9 13:16:23 2015 UTC,"College ID = super cheap Canes tickets. Last season, a friend and I got 2 front row seats for $25 each. $10 for upper level. It's great."
panthers,3cnlog,SpaceIsAPlace,2,Thu Jul 9 19:49:49 2015 UTC,"How would you go about using the student ID? My buddy I believe just finished school maybe he could buy the tickets. That price is unbelievable. Tickets to see the Flames here, 40$ will get you literally the back top corner of the arena."
panthers,3cnlog,ScottJohnson,3,Thu Jul 9 20:15:54 2015 UTC,"So first, I'm not sure if they'll have the promotion next year. They started it two seasons ago, and last year, they only had the $10 nosebleed tickets for students until about January or February when they reintroduced the $25 thing. So I'd keep tabs on the Canes's promotion website.   Also, I saw you said that your buddy just finished school. For the promotion, it's one ticket per student ID. I'm not sure if they verify that you're a current student, but if there's a picture on the ID and you don't look like it, they may not give it to you. Just a heads up before you read the rest of this comment. If you've got an old student ID laying around, I'd say use that since they probably won't care if you've already graduated.  Here's a link to the college promotions. Idk if the same page will work for the 2015 season, but if it doesn't, just google something like ""Carolina Hurricanes college specials."" They have College Nights which is only for specific games and College Rush which is what you want, the $25 lower level seats. Now, if you don't have a student ID, you might be able to use your friend's student ID to buy a ticket for the College Nights since those are bought online. But that's only if they choose the Maple Leafs game as one of the College Nights.  Now, if they do offer the College Rush next season, here's how you get the tickets. Get to the arena about one and a half to two hours before puck drop (5-5:30ish for a 7pm game). Parking is usually $15, but if you don't mind walking, there are a few office complexes where you can park for free and walk to the arena. Check out /r/canes and search for parking for more info on that.  Anyways, at the North and South entrances by the box office, they'll have a line for College Rush inside. There may or may not be people already in line, but there'll be a sign there. Getting there early is pretty important if you want good seats because when it gets to an hour before puck drop, the line can get pretty long depending on the game. They let people buy the tickets an hour before puck drop which is when you'll show them your student ID. If you want seats in a specific area, you can ask and they're pretty good about honoring the requests unless they just don't have any seats there since they're selling all the seats that aren't already bought or taken up by season ticket holders. Also, once you buy the tickets, you have to go straight inside the arena, so make sure you have everything you need with you when you're in line.   That's pretty much it. Let me know if you got any questions."
panthers,3cnlog,ZombieDisposalUnit,2,Fri Jul 10 00:59:57 2015 UTC,"Holy thanks for all the info. If that's the case I won't be able to do it, haven't been a student for about 7 years. But still, if you knew how much games cost in Calgary/Toronto, whatever the Canes charge for lower bowl is probably CONSIDERABLY less. In Toronto can run you between 400$+ per ticket. In Calgary lower bowl, looking at 250-300$+ per ticket (depending on who they play.)"
panthers,3cnlog,ScottJohnson,2,Fri Jul 10 03:30:48 2015 UTC,"Goddamn. I've always wanted to go to a game in Canada for the experience since I bet it'd be incredible, but I'm not sure if it's worth $300 haha."
panthers,3cnlog,faultlessjoint,2,Fri Jul 10 04:32:14 2015 UTC,"Go to a Habs game for an experience of crazy Canadian atmosphere. A game in Toronto is basically like being in a coffin. Hate Canucks and their fans, avoid there. Calgary is becoming like Toronto, but absolutely nuts in playoffs. Winnipeg is the other good atmosphere choice, but then you have to go to Winnipeg. Edmonton might pick up now that they have Mcdavid and might start having a decent team. Ottawa is also pretty lame.  Montreal is probably best choice. Might be some decent tickets there for close to 200$. Havent been to a game in Montreal in years though so don't quote me on that."

panthers,3clklb,FNScar,2,Thu Jul 9 00:30:58 2015 UTC,"Weird mine doesn't show it that way.  Oh well, what it should read is: KB, Funchess, and Brown as our 1st stringers.  Ginn, Bersin, and Hill as our second stringers.  Hill and Bersin are both fringe players but I see them winning the last 2 spots.    I think there's only 4 WRs safe going into this year (KB, Funchess, Brown, Ginn) so Cotch and Boykin both could make the team and usurp Bersin/Hill.  It's hard to predict and only the coaches have an idea which way things will land.    I like Boykin but the fact that he lost his job after such a great sophomore year to a mediocre rookie is a huge red flag to me.  Add to that the less-than-stellar numbers he put up in a pass first offense with the best QB in the league and it makes me wonder if his one good year was close to his ceiling in production.  His numbers would have looked very different if that receiving corps was with the Panthers' run first offense and Cam in 2013."
panthers,3clklb,BananaGooP,2,Thu Jul 9 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"I think that's a good stance on things. I personally wish we would drop Cotchery. I know he brings experience but I just didn't feel like he did much for us last year, and now he's another year older."
panthers,3clklb,MisterRandyMarsh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:51:29 2015 UTC,The only thing is that without him we have ZERO veteran presence on our receiving corps.  Ginn would be the most veteran and his career hasnt been good enough for him to start handing out lessons.  I think we lose Cotch due to a performance drop off like you do. But I hope he doesn't fall behind or KB is going to have to turn into a leader real fast.
panthers,3clklb,skippapotamus,2,Thu Jul 9 00:54:24 2015 UTC,Agreed.
panthers,3clklb,skippapotamus,3,Thu Jul 9 00:57:12 2015 UTC,Very nice write up! I have a few questions for you though.    For the 2014 1st string WRs should Brown be in place of Avant because he ended the season as the starting guy? or is it about where they started the season at?  Also I am kind of surprised you think Bersin makes 2nd string over say Cotchery.  Also I am curious about your slotting of Brown as the #2.  I don't disagree with it I just found it interesting and was curious as to why you think he will step up into the #2 slot.  As always great work :) its been great doing this series!
panthers,3clklb,young__sandwich,3,Wed Jul 8 22:26:04 2015 UTC,"It could really be listed either way.  Avant was a starter until he got cut so he was never really a 2nd string player.  Cotchery may still have a shot I just think his age is catching up with him.  I really hope he makes it so we have a veteran presence.  I just don't think he does based on talent alone.  And the slotting of the receivers in the summary isn't really strict in terms of WR1, WR2, etc.  Its really just starters vs backups and I think Corey starts over somebody like Ginn."
panthers,3clklb,young__sandwich,3,Wed Jul 8 22:58:15 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't make financial sense to get rid of Cotch since his contract is guaranteed. Cutting him would result in $1.8 million in dead money. That means Hill is probably the odd man out.  Also, FWIW Fozzy killed it as a KR last year, so don't rule out him returning kicks with Ginn becoming the primary PR."
panthers,3clklb,young__sandwich,3,Thu Jul 9 04:36:12 2015 UTC,"Both very good points.  But Gman won't keep a less talented receiver solely to save 2m against a cap where we are carrying somewhere around 10m over (as it stands) to 2016 anyways.  If Cotchery's value is right he could easily stay over Hill and honestly I hope he does.  I'd love that veteran presence to remain, just not at the cost of better talent.  In terms of Fozzy, I think Todman was brought in to prevent Fozzy from having to be a KR.  Maybe our FO would want to keep him safe if theyre unsure of Stew remaining healthy since Fozzy is the only other moderately proven back on the team.  Todman and Ginn paired at KR and Ginn at PR sets us up nicely for ST.  I've seen arguments for Ginn being the odd man out too and none of the opinions are any better or worse, its just hard to know what the plan is with so much versatility on the team right now.  But that's never a bad thing to have!"
panthers,3clklb,young__sandwich,3,Thu Jul 9 04:53:25 2015 UTC,"Cotchery's value is definitely more intangible in form, but he's also the best route runner on a team that wants to live for 3rd down and be efficient on that down.  They're not as needy of such a player as last year, they have some honest route runners, but there's a value there.   My only concern with him, and it's probably a reason he's so unpopular, is that you have a very green, young, longterm group on first look, and he's a guy who obviously doesn't have a future here.  But if you look at guys that might replace him - Hill, Boykin - in that role, and they're guys who are on one year deals, far as I'm aware.  So that part isn't critical.    Unless that role ends up being a 4th or 5th best player - Cotchery is (apparently) fully guaranteed, the other two would become guaranteed by being rostered week 1, and yet the role is best suited to someone coming up rather than topped out."
panthers,3clklb,JaquiskiTaterTartt,2,Mon Jul 13 13:55:15 2015 UTC,"to finish that thought, that 4th, 5th WR is very unlikely to play a big role, and by design a 5th guy isn't going to get many gameday jersey opportunities."
panthers,3clklb,BananaGooP,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:56:47 2015 UTC,"Fantastic post once again.  I'm surprised this hasn't generated more conversation.    I like your final roster.  I was surprised you put Cotchery as expendable.  I personally have us taking 7 WR (Cotchery is the only one I add) which I understand is a lot.  But management is high on his veteran ship.    I want to read more about our special teams.  If Hill makes the roster, I think this puts Ginn in the hot seat.  As you stated we have Todman as a potential return man.  I'm curious if our coaches have looked at Hill for returns.  If Hill can return kicks, I definitely think Ginn might be in trouble."
panthers,3clklb,JaquiskiTaterTartt,2,Thu Jul 9 14:12:47 2015 UTC,"I think that /u/BananaGooP is doing a Special Teams write-up after CB.  We were deciding if there was enough demand for a ST piece or not so if people want it, why the hell not?  Haha.  Hill is a large man to be returning kicks.  He certainly has a degree of speed and his strength would be an asset but having somebody his size back there who's less agile may not work as well as hoped.  And we only went into last year with 5 WRs.  Granted, the talent pool was significantly worse off but we didn't add in De'Andre until we released Avant.  Going into this season with 7 WRs could be a bit ambitious but as I've stated, I really hope Cotchery steps up physically and makes the team.  His leadership is invaluable."

We had arguable the biggest upgrade to ST this year than any other position.   Hill is a large man to be returning kicks. He certainly has a degree of speed and his strength would be an asset but having somebody his size back there who's less agile may not work as well as hoped.   This is the first thing I've heard about Hill as far as returning kicks.  It makes sense.  Thanks.  Someone posted who we thought our receivers on the final roster would be and I had:  No doubt:   KB Funchess C Brown   Should (But also possibly replaceable):   Ginn Cotchery   Battling out the last spot(s)   Hill Bersin   Needs a hell-of-a camp:   Boykin Byrd   I feel very strongly about my choices.

Steve Smith was a total handful and we kept him around for 13 years. We kept Frank Alexander after he got busted for smoking cannabis...even with a 10 games suspension (not sure, but I think it was 10 games)  It's pretty simple. Don't beat your family. Don't assault people. Don't be a menace to your community. I can live with these standards. Even if it takes us a bit longer to field a championship team."

panthers,3cld7u,net403,-5,Thu Jul 9 00:12:15 2015 UTC,Yep and that's why it's unfortunate for the fans that support his team and not him
panthers,3cld7u,dakotahawkins,5,Thu Jul 9 00:29:56 2015 UTC,"I believe you may be the only one that feels that way with our team. Jerry is the reason why Carolina went from being called terrible things immediately after Rae, to the most (and I think that's pretty safe to say) classiest organization in the league and our team reflects that ideology. I'm still a defender of Greg and will until I see solid proof of any wrong doing. But I also understand that keeping him would be a debacle of epic proportions. Besides, his contract would not have allowed for us to keep people like Olsen and Davis, nor would it have allowed us to bring in Oher, Ginn, and other improvements to our system. Hardy had two very good years, but before that he was like Kony Ealy, I think we are good without him."
panthers,3cld7u,net403,2,Thu Jul 9 07:06:22 2015 UTC,"Whether Hardy is here or not is an aside from the point I'm getting at, that the media selectively demonizes people differently.  Hardy was shunned and rolled out of town, and the media made sure no one didn't know what he did and refused to let it drop.  At the same time not giving Solo any accountability at all for the same type of behavior, as she will be painted as an American hero they will not make any mention of her being involved in the same type of behavior that gets men kicked out of town and permanently labeled.  She will be allowed to go on and carry her head high and accept praise from the country, and for the same thing Carolina fans are shamed into blackballing Hardy. The double standard is sickening.  That has nothing to do with people who think Jerry Richardson is a saint for standing up in what he believes in regardless how it affected the team (good or bad).  It's about people holding someone accountable relentlessly while at the same time overlooking the same thing because they feel another person deserves a break."
panthers,3cld7u,dakotahawkins,9,Thu Jul 9 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"It's not really a double standard since they're not the same organizations. I support the Panthers being risk-averse with the players, I don't want to win at any cost, I'd rather win the right way with a good group of players. Nobody wants those kinds of asterisks on their record."
panthers,3cld7u,ThisDerpForSale,5,Thu Jul 9 02:14:19 2015 UTC,"I respect your opinion, but it is the definition of a double standard.  Maybe Richardson isn't the one creating it, but it definitely is.  A female can go around beating up 17 year olds and support her country and the media won't hold her accountable.  If they were both held accountable I wouldn't be as sour.  But I'm sour as fuck after seeing the womens world cup.  If Greg Hardy was the goalie, there would be nothing else spoken about but his charges.  Sorry if I brought up old skeletons people would rather put to bed, but I'm irked by it."
panthers,3cld7u,net403,3,Thu Jul 9 03:23:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I respect your opinion as well.  My point on a ""double standard"" is this: According to wikipedia, ""A double standard is the application of different sets of principles for similar situations.""  To me, ""the application of"" implies the same entity is applying those standards.  I think an example of a double standard in this case would be a sports fan who hates Hardy for what he did and looks the other way to celebrate Solo despite her similar record. In that case, a single person chooses to apply one set of principles for Hardy and to ignore those principles for Solo, even though they were accused of similar things.  In the case we're talking about, I think about it's more along the lines of the Panthers applying one standard, while the US National Women's Soccer Team applies another. Sure, they're different standards, but since they're being applied by different entities they don't quite make it an actual ""double standard.""  imo"
panthers,3cld7u,LittleDinghy,2,Thu Jul 9 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have it exactly right.  That's what a double standard is.  The other commenter doesn't seem to grasp the concept."
panthers,3cld7u,net403,-1,Sat Jul 11 02:28:01 2015 UTC,"Well if there's different sets of standards that sort of negates the whole thing lol   To me, if one engages in domestic violence one should be viewed with the same animosity that anyone else is who engages in such behavior.  Aside from saying one deserves said punishment or not, the rules have now been set differently (in this instance) for men and women.  Women can beat up on people and it is more OK and accepted.  I don't give credence to either but now the rules have been made differently.  Women want to be treated the same as men, here is a chance.  tldr: I would feel better if they both were held equally accountable for the same infraction and they are not."
panthers,3cld7u,LittleDinghy,2,Thu Jul 9 03:39:32 2015 UTC,I think part of the reason most people are quiet about Hope Solo is because the victim was over six feet tall. I personally have run into several people who believe the whole thing was made up.
panthers,3cld7u,Spiralyst,3,Thu Jul 9 03:33:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but if Nicole Holder was 7 feet tall and a shady character that lies a lot, it would not retract from the media casting shade on him.  Not to say Greg is a saint or anything, but it is bull shit Solo gets off scott free in the public domain, and they would not mention Hardy's name without in the same breath calling him an abuser.    This is trying to apply two different brands of justice to the same crime  tldr: I would feel better if they both were held equally accountable for the same infraction and they are not."

The account of Solo's actions is quite horrific as well, but people in the media won't hardly bring it up at all, and she is painted as a hero to the USA.  It's quite bizarre at the least.

The AFC North is tough, but coach Marvin Lewis can get Cincinnati, which should be competitive for a while, over the postseason hump.""  The Panthers have a younger, 1000 yd receiver, a bruiser RB in Jonathon Stewart whos every bit as good as Jeremy Hill, will be boosted by a healthy Devin Funchess/Ted Ginn/Corey Brown and they have a better tight end than Tyler Eifert. The panthers defense is better and more talented than the Bengals despite getting Michael Johnson back.

Personally I'd be willing to give out a 5th round pick for Battle because you never know if he'll turn it around. 5th round is still incredibly low risk and it's a player who many consider a first round talent. We'd most likely be outbid at a 5th anyway but if we're going to bid anything we may as well be competitive. A 7th rounder will go nowhere for a talent like him."

panthers,3cjq5u,Hawkince,11,Wed Jul 8 13:17:18 2015 UTC,"This feels more like a ""My favorite panthers"" list than a real effort to judge based on talent.  Steve Smith is the only one that belongs.  How he missed Peppers is beyond me.  And while we all love Mills and Kasay, are they really among the best players we've ever had?    I don't want to rank them, but depending on how you're doing it (time as a Panther vs. overall career), you would want to draw from the following:     Smitty - started his career with a punt return for a TD.  Best receiver in Panther history, and it's not even close. Peppers - so athletic that when he just looked ""good"" out there he was accused of taking plays off. Jordan Gross - Rock steady and one of the best at his position.  Not only was he a good blocker, he was a great leader. Wesley Walls - Want to guess what this guy could have done with more passing friendly rules?  For a while it seemed like he was our whole offense. Michael Bates - If you think Kasay should be on the list as a specialist, how about a specialist who made the pro bowl 5 straight years and was named to the all-decade team?   Other names worth mentioning     Jake Delhomme/Chris Gamble/Kris Jenkins/Moose/Greg Olsen/Ryan Kalil/Thomas Davis - Pick one and you can make a good argument Cam and Luke - We all think that both these guys should make a future list, but if you have to choose, how can you not go with Kuechly?  Seriously, how is Cam on ANY list and Luke is not?  DROY and DPOY not good enough?   The following guys would be included only if you wanted to take their entire career into account.   Reggie White - Minister of Defense Sam Mills - Best known for what he did in NO Kevin Greene - One of the best sack artists in NFL history"
panthers,3cjq5u,Cyberjag,3,Wed Jul 8 15:29:02 2015 UTC,"Chris Gamble   Very happy to see this name included - the guy had a quiet but amazingly productive career and left the game on his own terms.  I think that because he was so unseen and unheard that most of us forget how big a piece he was for our defense for a lot of years.   EDIT - dammit, I had to switch to me some old school Gamble flair!"
panthers,3cjq5u,qverb,3,Wed Jul 8 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"And if you're going to mention Gamble, you're going to need to bring in Eric Davis.  So many people forgot just how good he was for so long even while the rest of the Panthers D was going to the shitter."
panthers,3cjq5u,asher1611,2,Thu Jul 9 05:40:06 2015 UTC,"My only concern about Davis is that he was really good in SF, and in Carolina he was great his first year but slowly regressed from that point forward."
panthers,3cjq5u,Cyberjag,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"His numbers don't tell that story.  He was a consistent 5 INT guy who generally was able to keep with his assignments.  The issues with the Panthers D started and ended on two fronts:   A lot of the key players aged out but hung on too long.  We got old and slow The Zone Blitz was the new defensive hotness in 1996.  By 1998, teams had figured it out.  Capers' defense relied heavily on the 3-4 zone blitz."

He was a huge inspiration to the Super Bowl run, and the creator of Keep Pounding. I do get what you mean though.   Also Peppers gets a lot of heat for the way he left, but as a player he has to be there, the guy is a possible HoFer and he'll be remembered as a Panther.   Spot on with the Cam and Luke thing. Both great young players, but Luke is already largely considered the best MLB in the league who has been improving every year.

But the guy only played on the Panthers for three years.  That's my main beef with him getting the accolades he does.  Yes, he was an inspiration and he lent our defense a legitimate name, but as a player he wasn't even the best linebacker on the team--that honor goes to Kevin Greene.    Love him, but top five?  No."

panthers,3cjq5u,AbsurdSpud,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:54:36 2015 UTC,I couldn't understand the list either. At first I thought it was just the five best players to put on a Panthers uniform. But then I thought that maybe it was supposed to be about good players that meant a lot to the team. But seeing Moose on there instead of Jake let me know that it wasn't about which players meant most to the team. And seeing Peppers not make the list let me know it wasn't just about the best players to put on a uniform so I don't actually know what that list was supposed to be except clickbait.

There are also good arguments for Cam Newton and Luke Kuechly because of how on fire they've been since they started their careers, and because they've helped turn around the franchise. Julius Peppers was one of our most talented players but it's hard to put him on such a short list of ""greatest Panthers"". And I might have my #5 and #6 be Kevin Greene and Wesley Walls. They played for the 90's Panthers so they're often forgotten, but they tore it up. Ultimately the 5b to Jake Delhomme's 5a would have to be Jordan Gross, though.

Then again, C-link is now one of the toughest stadiums to play in because they sell out every game, so it's not necessarily a bad thing."

I find that most people who like or dislike teams for the reasons you stated (lack of tradition, don't want to support a loser) are not the sort of fan who would go out of their way to support a franchise by buying tickets or jerseys anyway so it's really not a loss to the team. AKA they are generally a more casual type of fan that at most will watch 2 games a year and most likely tune in for the playoffs unless they have something better to do.   As far as my situation goes, I actually sat down and watched games from every team, learned about the players and chose which team I liked the most. Steve Smith quickly became my favorite player and that was a big part of my decision. I also dislike the NY media bias and NY fans in general which is why I didn't just settle for liking all New York teams.   I think the notion of being disappointed in people for their teams fan choice is honestly just caring a little too much. It's really not something that should be concerning you enough to actually be upset about it. You're right about that being their choice. Just because they are from a city/state doesn't mean they have to feel an affiliation toward their local team and their are a ton of reasons why someone could deviate from that."

I get so jealous whenever I see a Chief's game or Packers game and the intensity the fans have for their teams. I always think ""I want that in Charlotte."" I've been to games where I actually feel bad for the players. Who'd want to come out and play for people that were cheering against you? I was at the Panthers/Giants game a few years back, and all you could hear across the stadium was ""Let's go, Giants!"" The preseason game against the Steelers last year was another shameful display. I wasn't sure if it was in Charlotte or Pittsburg. But the worst had to have been against the Cowboys recently. We were surrounded by Cowboys fans, and one guy kept shouting ""that's a hometown call!"" I shouted back, ""yeah and where are you from? Gastonia, or Concord?"" Then I get back home in Upstate SC where everyone watches college football and nothing else (which I can watch, but it really just bores me to death). I feel like I'm the only Panther fan sometimes. And it's not the people who have moved here with different fandoms. It's the ones that were born and raised here, and jumped on some stupid bandwagon they can't let go of.  But there is hope. I feel the last couple of seasons are starting to bring people out. I'm seeing more Panther hats around, a few more Panther shirts.

Do you think we have a hard time with their offense or their defense?   I would say we handle their offense pretty well, only really giving up 1 play a game. Our offense on the other hand simply cannot produce against their defense at all.  So they can be considered the team that gives us the hardest time offensively"

panthers,3chlyy,Spiralyst,5,Wed Jul 8 01:17:10 2015 UTC,"I'll limit to the teams on our schedule.   The Seahawks have our number, but the games are always like a field goal difference. Even the playoff game was closer than the final score suggested as the one Chancellor play made a one score affair in to a 3 TD lead. I feel like we're closing the gap. If our team is for real, I'm actually liking this match-up on the road. If the Seahawks end up with home field in the playoffs it will be a good experience to play in that atmosphere during the regular season.  The Eagles don't scare me as much as our last meeting should make me. I can't put my finger on it, but I think that blowout was a mix of circumstance and the Panthers having a collectively off night. I don't see the Eagles dominating us this go-around.  The Colts are dangerous. They're weak spot is defense, so if we can put up some points, we should have a shot.  The Cowboys definitely have the personnel to beat us. That game concerns me.  I have no idea what to expect out of the Giants or Texans. They could both be playoff teams this year, or could win four games. To much uncertainty to call at this point.  We should be able to handle the Jags and Texans. Our division games will be dog fights, most like.   Our team is tough to project. We were two completely different teams over the course of last season, so it would be nice to see which team shows up during our ridiculously easy schedule in September."

panthers,3chlyy,JaquiskiTaterTartt,2,Wed Jul 15 15:37:01 2015 UTC,Yeah. There is a lot of young talent that has yet to emerge. We've invested in a lot of redshirt players recently. There isn't a better time for them to all come out and shine. The most notable are Tank Carradine and Brandon Thomas.
panthers,3chlyy,Magnuts,3,Wed Jul 15 15:41:01 2015 UTC,"Running.  We have to be able to stop it and we have to be able to do it.  But we also have to get the pass rush.    The thing about Carolina is in the past we've always relied on our defensive line to pressure the qb.  It's that pressure that forces him to make bad decisions and makes our secondary look better.  Obviously that doesn't work well against a guy like Aaron Rogers because he just doesn't make bad decisions very often I'd say that makes them the best offense to combat our defense.  But it's that aggressive pressure that opens us up against the run or the play option pass.  And that's why Seahawks can fuck with us so often as well.  They are a power run team with a good defense.    So now we lost one of our major pass rushers.  So we beefed up our secondary and we count on our bomb ass linebacker crew to pick up the run...   As far as our offense goes, we really have to create the run.  Cam does pretty good passing, but wouldn't it be great if we just knew that we could hand the ball off to a back and pick up 3-4 yards?  That's kinda what hurt us last year before Stewart magically turned into a fucking monster.  Tolbert was hurt and our offensive line was kinda confused for a while.  Tolbert is a great runner, but he also is good for plowing the way.  Hopefully this year  our offensive line will be a little more productive.  Plus I'm really excited to see Lee Ward knock some bitches down this year too.   I think he could potentially be our Gettlemagic pick of the year if he can clear some lanes for our running backs.    Best defense to beat us is dem Seahawks again probably.  They just have too many fucking weapons.  Fuckers and their sexy defense.  Whatever.   It seems like you're asking what team is our bitch on the last question...  Man.  I'd love to say Saints here.  But.. fuckin Sean Payton.  He's such a good coach with his stupid zoolander face.  IDK man  you never know who the Panthers will beat or lose against on any given Sunday.  Like last year I thought Vikings were a lock and I thought the Lions would be tough.  But shit man.  Shit.  Bottom line is control the run, control the game.  Chicken biscuit."

panthers,3chlyy,SpaceIsAPlace,2,Wed Jul 8 01:54:12 2015 UTC,Tolbert was hurt and our offensive line was kinda confused for a while.   I think a lot of people underestimate how much this fucked us last year. Third and short is just SOOOO much more manageable with him on the field
panthers,3chlyy,Spiralyst,2,Wed Jul 8 04:14:21 2015 UTC,"Well put. I'll also add that in addition to ball control running offense and a pass rush, we need a better turnover differential. In 2013, one of the reasons we went 12-4 was having one of the best turnover margins in the league.  Also...special teams. If Cam doesn't have to start every drive from our own 15 yard line and we're not spotting our opponent 14 points on special team fuck ups, we should be pretty good this year."

panthers,3cdsnn,roodypoo926,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:24:48 2015 UTC,"Last year was absolutely unprecedented for rookie receivers. It's an anomaly from the rule, not the rule itself. Discounting 2014, only six rookie receivers had broken 1,000 yards in the last 15 years, 12 in NFL history.  On the other hand, in that same time, Jeremy Hill, Eddie Lacy, Leveon Bell, Gio Bernard, Zac Stacy, Trent Richardson, Alfred Morris, Mark Ingram, DeMarco Murray, Knoshon Moreno, Adrian Peterson, Marshawn Lynch, MJD, Joseph Addai, Ryan Grant, Willis McGahee, and LT were all worth 1,000 yards their first years. That's 17 compared to 6 in the same span of time. You can extrapolate the further if you look at the number of rookie RBs who lead their team in rushing yards as opposed to receivers who did the same.  Just saying...there've been some very promising rookie RB seasons. Moreso that WRs."

panthers,3cca62,scotttr,27,Mon Jul 6 22:02:03 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion: Panthers fans have a persecution complex.  Whenever someone says anything that can be considered as less that completely positive, our fanbase takes offense.    It isn't only that we view the opinion as being unfavorable or that the pundit is wrong, Panthers fans seem to think it is because the writer/pundit/whatever is somehow holding a grudge against the Panthers.  If you're not overflowingly positive, you're labeled as a ""hater.""  Every week there seems to be a new post where everyone is complaining about a new SI/ESPN/BR/whatever ranking that either didn't rank the team or player high enough.  Question Cam's contract?  Hater!  Question drafting Shaq?  Hater!  Question FA signings?  Hater!"
panthers,3cca62,TubaMike,18,Tue Jul 7 00:23:17 2015 UTC,"You make a good point. I don't think it is that people try to hate on the Panthers. After all, we have gone 6-10, 7-9, 12-4, and 7-8-1 over the last four years. Two playoff appearances, one winning season, one playoff win over a terrible Cardinals offense.  Carolina hasn't had a period of consistent success. We haven't had two consecutive winning seasons. Ever. We were legitimately good in '96, '99, '03, '05, '08, and '13. Six years out of what, 20? That's not memorable. We never had legitimate stars - household NFL names - other than Steve Smith and Julius Peppers. Now we have Cam and Luke.  Cam is talented, but he is an easy target for criticism. His game isn't the same as other QBs. He has legitimate flaws in his game that are obvious. Overthrowing and not setting his feet.  Our game plans aren't flashy. We don't have a wizard offense like New England, or a flashy aerial attack like New Orleans and Green Bay, or a clusterfuck that seems to work like Philadelphia. We rely on relatively obscure workhorse backs, a fullback that no one knows about, and non-flashy and commonly past-their-prime receivers.  Our defense isn't flashy. We don't blitz a lot like Green Bay and Chicago (at least they used to). We don't have interception machines like Seattle. We operate out of a base 4-3 with a lot of nickel thrown in. Nothing fancy. Nothing half the other teams aren't also doing.  Carolina is nondescript. Small market, new franchise, boring division. It's not like Atlanta, New Orleans, and Tampa are huge pro football markets. College football is bigger in the NFC South markets than the NFL is.  But Carolina isn't alone in its obscurity. How often is San Diego given its due? Or Cincinnati? Cincinnati has one of the most talented rosters in football and no one talks about them. Arizona? Granted, Tennessee and Jacksonville have been consistently bad, but no one talks about them either."

I like to look at it this way:  The last expansion before the Panthers/Jaguars was the Bucs and Seahawks in the 70's and both of them have since won a Super Bowl. But compare the Panthers success vs the Jaguars, Texans and the new Browns and the Panthers win hands down. At least they have a Super Bowl appearance."

Smaller media markets have to force the media to respect them; we've not been consistent winners, and  so it's very easy for a certain class of writer to cross off the Panthers in favor of last decade's darlings (New Orleans) or a team with a lot of skill position flash (Atlanta).  Green Bay and San Antonio are probably the best examples of pro franchises that have achieved this. It wasn't that long ago that the only thing you could find about the Spurs was the occasional national writer whining about how boring they are and/or predicting that <insert year> would be their demise.  Also years later a lot of the media still aren't over the fact that Cam Newton has had the temerity to be a good NFL QB after all the shit they talked about him."

More often than not either an INT or a punt.   Genius"

panthers,3cb8ra,cityofcharlotte,4,Tue Jul 7 14:54:22 2015 UTC,I don't know if you guys remember but a couple seasons ago when we went 12-4 with the first round bye Sports Illustrated picked us to go last in the entire NFC.     I think they either hate us/our players or they just don't know what they are talking about.  It could be a combination of the two but I wouldn't put much stock into what they say.
panthers,3cb8ra,Young_Link13,2,Mon Jul 6 19:31:15 2015 UTC,The writer is ignoring our turnaround even though it was in part cause we altered two of our weakest position groups. I don't get where the critical thinking is in putting more stock into the earlier part of the season rather than our turnaround with new younger players stepping up. I say it's more that they don't know what they're talking about.

panthers,3cb8ra,zleek,3,Mon Jul 6 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the Panthers are improved or did enough this offseason to get the division 3 times in a row.  I'm hopeful, but not optimistic.  However, I disagree with the writer's reasoning.  It just looks like he googled some names, said meh, and carried on.  Then again, it's 4th place, so who cares, right?  Byron Bell.  Less is more.  If it works for the Saints it can work for us, right?"
panthers,3cb8ra,mattpacman96,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:12:44 2015 UTC,"Let's say our line doesn't improve over last season on just one side. If our right tackle holds up our line will improve and look more like the line we saw in the last quarter of the season. It's not ideal, but it's not the trainwreck we saw during the middle part of the season when we were constantly using different rotations every single week.   I also just think everyone is sleeping on Cam. He won't be hobbling around for half the season and absent for two games (knocking on wood). He makes better throws on the run, so hopefully they just let him loose if the line keeps crumbling around him.  Really the elephant in the room for any team is the offensive line. It is one of the most important position groups to make it to the postseason. But every team is subject to injuries so any team in the league can fall prey to having a terrible unit with just a couple of key players going down.   There are some arguments to be made for both the Saints and the Falcons...perhaps more so for the Saints...taking the division. But what I find preposterous is to say a team that's coming back fielding essentially the same team as last year will fall all the way to the cellar just because every other team seriously re-tooled or picked up a brand-new coaching staff. That's a ballsy prediction. When most of your players are in their 2nd-4th year together on the field, cohesion starts to sink in."

We shit on the falcons 34-3, and we fucking took a doo-doo on the saints 41-10, and we also beat the Bucs 19-17 with a backup Derek Anderson starting. Last place my ass."
panthers,3cb8ra,zzyzyzz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:03:36 2015 UTC,"The writer must think Winston walks on water. They may have a better offensive line this year, but they'll probably be starting a rookie in at least one place on it. But they still have no running game or TE to speak of unless Doug Martin starts to outperform his history. So even if they have amazing WR's, they'll be a very one-dimensional offense with a rookie quarterback asked to make the majority of plays.  We open up the season with them. Hopefully we mop the floor with them and set an example for the rest of the division on opening day. But different than last year. Definitely different than last year."

I feel like i really missed out on making some great memories during this formidable part of our franchise, as well as my life. I was not into sports at all until I got to college, really. It just so happened that it was the same year the panthers made their super bowl run. That being said, I can say that I've been a PSL owner since the beginning. My mom and uncle were both so excited about the Carolinas having an nfl team they bought 4 PSLS and drug my little brother and I to as many games as we could stand. All i remember from Clemson was being so hot and it taking forever to get there. Heat was a common theme for most the games in charlotte too , really. Still is but now alcohol. And I care a lot more  I remember when the Panthers played the Packers in the 96 NFC championship fairly well. At least contextually. There were news reports on how fans who were planning on going should dress. I also remember seeing a shot of a mall in Green Bay that looked post apocalyptic is was so empty.   Now that I'm an adult I appreciate that i was fortunate enough to had the chance to go these games, but disappointed I didn't care at the time. Such is life.

panthers,3c1tt3,scotttr,5,Sat Jul 4 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"Frank Alexander and Kony Ealy will eventually become solid starters.  A rotation of Ealy, Alexander and Johnson will wreck havoc. Ealy is arguably ahead of Hardy at this point in his career, when compared.   The biggest question I see is how long will it take Ealy to come to form?  I think this year he has a great sophmore year, and next year is his break out year.    Thank you once again for these!  Keep up the great work and keep pounding!"
panthers,3c1tt3,young__sandwich,3,Sat Jul 4 14:40:48 2015 UTC,I completely agree that Alexander and Ealy can become great starters. Alexander I'm more worried about because we didn't get to see him last season.  As for Ealy vs Hardy I agree Ealy is further along but Hardy had more athleticism to help him along while Ealy is going to have to work hard. I think he could break out this year depending on opportunity and work ethic.   Thank you for reading and keep pounding!  Edit: Damn mobile auto correcting Ealy to easy
panthers,3c1tt3,arcangel092,2,Sat Jul 4 15:39:16 2015 UTC,I see a similar path he had last year but pasted onto this year. He plays ok for the first half and the second half he takes major strides with next year being his true breakout double digit sack year. His instincts got taken advantage of last year so he now knows what to expect. Once he gets his body physically ready for the NFL he will being to show why he was our 2nd round draft pick.
panthers,3c1tt3,AbsurdSpud,3,Sun Jul 5 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"If you haven't seen his draft profile I highly recommend it, he seems like another high character guy and I think Ealy clearly has the drive to improve himself.   If you can't watch, Ealy's sister has a chromosomal disability that leaves her highly impaired. Ealy's father moved both of them out of a bad neighborhood 160 away from St. Louis. Ealy's dad is older so he has lived knowing that he needs to take care of his sister and more than likely his father one day.   I know an inspirational story doesn't make a great player, but I think Ealy making the improvements he did over the year show that he could continue to improve, and his motivation to be great is fairly unique.   Either way I think a CJ/Alexander/Ealy mix will be solid."

panthers,3c27z2,scotttr,4,Mon Jul 6 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly IMO I'd say get a black or teal Thomas Davis jersey. The dude really is an amazing person. He won't be around much longer though, so if you're looking to buy a jersey of a player that will be on the team then Cam is your best bet because, well, he just signed a franchise contract."

panthers,3c27z2,Tehtime,5,Sat Jul 4 06:40:33 2015 UTC,"If you normally go to home games before late October, I'd get a white jersey. It can get hot here and the white will help keep you cool.  I personally like the Blue/Teal jerseys.  Go number ""00"" and put your own last name on the back of the jersey. Players come and go, but you'll always be a Panther. It just makes sense to me.  Or you could just get a throwback jersey like a Brad Hoover, Mike Minter, or Moose uni."

panthers,3c0tqp,ashabanapal,14,Fri Jul 3 19:14:22 2015 UTC,"What was the plan if actual news broke (like say a player getting suspended) during the blackout?   Mods can make posts even when it is restricted, so the plan was either to have one of us post it (y'all could still comment) or re-enable posting and throw up a discussion thread (since ESPN/Twitter would probably have notified you by then).  I speak only for myself, but it probably was not the best decision that we made as a whole, but we followed the voting process we had in place for decisions like this. We probably should have had more community input, but the past is past and we will take what we learned from this event and apply it going forward."
panthers,3c0tqp,Ramagician,-4,Fri Jul 3 19:27:39 2015 UTC,Thank you for standing with the mods while being a mod still means something.

Reddit is meant for more than our favorite football team. If you don't think it's a big deal whatever, buts this is important to reddit as a whole. Just in case you didn't know apart from all the stupid censoring and firing, reddit fired a guy from working because he had cancer. I think this deserves our concern.

Then he was wishy washy about when he could move to San Francisco to do a job he allegedly loved. He kept stringing along a company that already did too much. If I had to move to do a job I loved I'd get it done by any means possible. He acted like he was healthy enough to work even though he stated he's currently unemployed by choice to get healthy. So he was never gonna be able to fulfill what he stated, they were right to get rid of him. If anything reddit should be getting praise for trying so damn hard to let him keep his job and get the medical attention he needed.   What has really happened with reddit? They're not allowing fat people shaming and they wanna monetize their AMA's which honestly aren't that amazing to begin with.

panthers,3byc9r,cystorm,-3,Fri Jul 3 05:32:53 2015 UTC,"Hi!  I was on the fence personally, but I do think since we have a working connection with the Panthers office themselves our decision is slightly different from the other small subs. We appreciate how understanding, responsive, and involved they have been with us, and it's made our role a lot easier. I feel for the /r/iama mods, since they have to deal with more entities on a very chaotic scale. The result of this is a move for solidarity on my part. I am hoping this will blow over soon.  All in all, this also is the depths of the offseason, so we won't be missing anything big in the short-term.  I do know that the mod team will keep everyone updated as things change - we are ultimately here to serve you guys and gals!  - Heel"
panthers,3byc9r,EducatedGenus,11,Fri Jul 3 08:23:35 2015 UTC,"This seems like a huge overreaction to an event we don't understand yet. You (well, /u/the-horace) say:   A well liked and well known reddit employee, /u/chooter[2]  , (Victoria of r/iama[3] fame) has been inexplicably let go.   No, a well-liked employee has been let go and the mods haven't told anyone why. I can think of all sorts of reasons her dismissal would be 300% justified, and some reasons it would be unjustified. I think it's also appropriate that they don't tell, as that's an employment matter.  Anyway, I'm disappointed with everyone on reddit assuming Victoria was wronged when it's just as likely she was the wrongdoer. /r/iama going down is understandable since they needed that position for support. Other subs showing ""solidarity"" is ridiculous."
panthers,3byc9r,Sloppysloppyjoe,11,Fri Jul 3 12:29:26 2015 UTC,"No, a well-liked employee has been let go and the mods haven't told anyone why.    You mean the Admins haven't told anybody why... and I don't think that was /r/IAMA's major issue...    I can think of all sorts of reasons her dismissal would be 300% justified, and some reasons it would be unjustified. I think it's also appropriate that they don't tell, as that's an employment matter.   Again, not the reason. My understanding from reading the last few hours is subs are upset with the disconnect and inability of the Admins to think through decisions. They fired an integral liaison between corporate & community without notifying the community AND (here's where I agree most) without any formal plan to pick up the pieces or help deal with the fallout.   And, you're right - it's the company's right to terminate who they want.... but if your company's entire business model is centered around a loyal user base then you should think through your actions before pissing off the sane side of the user base. It's unprofessional to let someone who is an integral part of major default subs function go without having (and voicing) a back up plan.    See https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/ Or https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/3byhat/many_of_you_are_asking_if_rbestof_will_go_private/"
panthers,3byc9r,EducatedGenus,2,Fri Jul 3 14:06:43 2015 UTC,"Except this websites business model (like any other website) revolves around ad revenue-not user happiness level. And as you see, since this is just an Internet forum, angry keyboard warriors don't have a lot of influence (gamergate, FPH revolt and now this).   Internet people are gonna be angry always about something. Concerning yourself with the inner workings and behind the scenes shit of an Internet forum is a waste of time.

And the beat will go on.   I do think that the reddit faithful are beginning to take a step back and realize how ""not-special"" they are.... which will hurt ad revenue, I believe. Personally, I find myself getting on reddit less and less; no sub for it though.   Again, you're not wrong but it still is a shitty endeavor on reddit's part.

I was just trying to show my opinion that while supporting the movement (I guess we can call it that?) seems like the right thing to do morally, I do not believe that it in actuality helps the cause enough to be a net positive for the subreddit. Of course that is just one guy's opinion. Still glad to have mods like you guys here though, I think this subreddit is ran significantly better than most."
panthers,3byc9r,G_Thirty,0,Fri Jul 3 19:11:10 2015 UTC,"I would agree with that as well. It's one of the sentiments that some of the bigger moderation subs mentioned while everyone was discussing what to do. Basically everyone agreed that we couldn't shut down for long, but needed to make it as large a ""blackout"" as possible.  Again, we're very sorry if this has had a negative impact, everything is back to normal now."

panthers,3byc9r,Neri25,20,Fri Jul 3 19:34:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Reddit should be expected to announce why they fired an employee. It's also possible that she requested to keep it private if something embarrassing or potentially damaging led to her departure. She also may have quit on her own, and is choosing to not speak about it. Personally, I feel as though too little is known about what happened to take actions against Reddit. That said, I'm not the one that moderates the sub, so it's not really my decision. See you all on the other end."
panthers,3byc9r,EducatedGenus,3,Fri Jul 3 06:09:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly for iAMA it's less about ""this awesome person was fired"" and more ""this awesome person that helps us do what we do was fired and we weren't given any notice whatsoever"".  It's like you have this coworker that makes your job easy and then from outta nowhere they're fired and not replaced."
panthers,3byc9r,acrolos,3,Fri Jul 3 09:52:40 2015 UTC,Also - you fired someone integral to the function of the business and you had no backup plan in place (and if it's there you haven't communicated it).   e: - !
panthers,3byc9r,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Fri Jul 3 14:08:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Every firing in a company isn't planned.  I imagine there was a good reason for it.   Honestly,  most of Reddit seems like spoiled children right now.  I'm disappointed in the subreddits that are jumping onto this bandwagon."
panthers,3byc9r,DrHellstrom,20,Fri Jul 3 23:45:56 2015 UTC,"I'll ask you guys the same question I've asked other mods to no real response: what's the endgame? You've shut everything down. You've made the statement. Now what? What are the specific demands here?  If mods are making these decisions without the consent of the rest of the users, we at least have a right to know what the plan is supposed to be. Are you trying to get this employee rehired? Because that's probably not going to happen, and you shouldn't expect it to. Are you trying to get better moderation tools made? That's understandable, but it could take a long time. Developing software doesn't happen in a day, and rushing them is only going to insure that any new features probably suck. You want better communication? Please articulate how that's supposed to happen.  Reddit's at least verbally said that they were going to work harder going forward. But the general response seems to be that it's not enough. What do they have to do for you to let us use the site again? I've asked this question a few times now, and I don't think I've gotten a satisfactory answer."
panthers,3byc9r,faultlessjoint,19,Fri Jul 3 12:21:18 2015 UTC,Reddit is so dramatic sometimes. Why is it not their prerogative to hire and let go who they want to?
panthers,3byc9r,anniecakes,13,Fri Jul 3 15:30:31 2015 UTC,I agree.  I feel like the site had been overwhelmed by emotional 14 year olds.
panthers,3byc9r,solmakou,7,Fri Jul 3 15:51:10 2015 UTC,Right?! I used to be a heavy reddit user but now I've cut back hard and only subscribe to subs that are of personal interest to me. Stop being so dramatic about this. I couldn't give less of a fuck if I tried... I just want to read about the Panthers.
panthers,3byc9r,DrHellstrom,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:21:35 2015 UTC,It was a breaking point.  They removed the point of contact and did not communicate a replacement or process to replace her.  Personally I saw the writing on the wall when they banned fat people hate (along with a few other subreddits) and started doing research on the interim CEO as it was a major reversal on the core principles started by admins previously.
panthers,3byc9r,solmakou,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that FPH was banned for internet stalking/harassing specific people, which has always been against Reddit's rules. Anyway I don't think Reddit loses much of value if that type of redditor goes somewhere else to be toxic."
panthers,3byc9r,DrHellstrom,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:12:32 2015 UTC,"I have not seen one piece of evidence of the harassment, and I have looked.  I only saw the subreddit in r/all, but what I did see was no worse than r/cringepics"
panthers,3byc9r,solmakou,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:17:13 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I don't intend to do any research to confirm one way or the other. FPH being banned struck me as being the same sort of reaction as when r/jailbait was banned after generating negative media attention."

panthers,3byc9r,acrolos,12,Fri Jul 3 04:58:29 2015 UTC,Exactly!  Mods are fucking out of control thinking they are more important than they are.

panthers,3byc9r,net403,3,Fri Jul 3 14:10:01 2015 UTC,And what happens when news does break that Panthers fans want to know? I fully expect the mods to reopen the sub without hesitation. Or else I might just make a new sub
panthers,3byc9r,P0in7B1ank,2,Fri Jul 3 17:58:00 2015 UTC,"Agree, if I'm wrong someone enlighten me.  This feels like the all-to-familiar Panthers-esque type statement that injures the fans and does little else."

panthers,3bwsxe,RicDango,2,Thu Jul 2 20:21:17 2015 UTC,"Damn, thanks man. This is super well done. /u/biggin528 and /u/bananagoop deserve like, a medal for this. But all I can really give is my kudos."
panthers,3bwsxe,young__sandwich,3,Thu Jul 2 20:28:30 2015 UTC,Those guys are killing it with Progress and predictions.  If you want depth read those.
panthers,3bwsxe,BananaGooP,3,Thu Jul 2 20:30:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you! :) We try our best.  /u/young__sandwich seems to have given you most of the info needed below.  I would add that a more or less secret strength is the CB position and OG/C positions.  At CB there is Josh Norman a top 10 if not top 5 CB as well as Bene Benwikere who had a fantastic rookie year and the addition of Charles Tillman  makes it a strength.  At OG and C we have 2 sophomore players who graded incredibly high in Andrew Norwell and Trai Turner as well as Pro Bowl Center Ryan Kalil.  Biggest training camp battle is WR.  If you are going to focus on 1 battle that is the one to focus on, then the DE position.  Oline is a battle but its more a work in progress than a battle.  I would also add we have a good piece on all the draft prospects here. But I also know you have scouting reports and are a much better scouter than myself so I would take your reports over what's there.  Also if you need any extra insight I would look to /u/JCoxRocks or biggin they are both incredibly knowledgable about the teams inner workings and such."
panthers,3bwsxe,young__sandwich,5,Thu Jul 2 21:08:50 2015 UTC,100% agree.
panthers,3bwsxe,BananaGooP,3,Thu Jul 2 23:07:07 2015 UTC,"No problem man. I don't think you actually included the link for your draft prospects but yeah, I always want a second opinion to compare mine against. You guys do a great job here breaking down the entire team; there is absolutely no shortage of information and I'll be spending the next several days getting well-versed in the Panthers' offseason and future  Edit - nvm you fixed the link haha"
panthers,3bwsxe,young__sandwich,3,Thu Jul 2 21:12:12 2015 UTC,"Check again ;) We still have a few positions to go as well.  I think we still have WR, DE, CB, and Special teams so look for those in the coming week or 2  Edit: In fact I hope to finish DE tonight."
panthers,3bwsxe,terminator_1264,3,Thu Jul 2 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"1.Is there a list of acquired FAs I can look at?     FA list.    And how do you see some of these guys fitting on the team? Who will be the most impactful, in your eyes?      Oher is arguably the biggest FA move we made to find some stability at LT.   Having Charles ""Peanut"" Tillman veteran ship added to our secondary will only  make our young (growing) secondary better. Many of our off season signings was to upgrade and add depth to our weak special teams unit, I would expect a much better showing this season.        2.Have there been any major coaching changes this offseason?     No, I mean new special teams coach, but I wouldn't call it major.    3.What are some training camp battles to look out for?     WR, DE, Oline    4.What is, in your opinion, the strongest and weakest position group(s) on this team?     We have arguably the best linebacker core in the NFL, and this year will be even better, We have a top 5 front 7, and a top 10 Defense over all.   Our Oline remains are biggest weakness but more at LT vs the entire line (like last year).   This is just one fan's opinion.  Looking forward to what others say."
panthers,3bwsxe,young__sandwich,2,Thu Jul 2 20:27:56 2015 UTC,we changed our special teams coordinator

panthers,3bxu0b,hermolt,3,Fri Jul 3 01:23:32 2015 UTC,"Nfl ticket exchange is how I usually go about getting seats. I've sat in the 500s (upper level) and in the lower level. If you don't mind dropping a couple hundred for a lower level then you'll find some good spots. Upper level seats for a regular season game against the Bucs should be anywhere between $45 and $70. Don't worry about missing out on the experience by sitting up top. There really isn't a bad seat in the house, especially now with the new huge jumbo tron screens. Personally I've never had a problem with other fans asking me to be quiet. Some people say the lower level is like that, I can guarantee you won't have that problem in the 500 levels."

panthers,3btos5,whitemagic420,4,Thu Jul 2 17:12:27 2015 UTC,"When you add Shaq Thompson to that mix, we have the most deadly front 7 in the NFL, and our corners are getting better with Josh Norman  at the 2 and Charles Tillman at the 1."
panthers,3btos5,biggin528,8,Thu Jul 2 12:06:16 2015 UTC,"Debatable on the best front 7.  I'd give us top-5 but Shaq is unproven and our DE opposite CJ is an unknown at this point be it Alexander, Horton or Ealy.  I say top-5 even with the unknowns at 2 positions.  Other mentionables would be Jets, Eagles, Bills, Texans, Rams, Broncos, Seagawks, Patriots.    I think we are definitely amongst the elite and if Shaq pans out, we are top-3.  If Kony/whatever DE we go with pans out too, I'd say #1 overall."
panthers,3btos5,BOATSANDHOEZ,3,Thu Jul 2 15:32:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. With Hardy we would have been #1 for sure. Without Hardy, there are no sure things on the roster to step in and be great, so top 3-5 is what we will be unless Ealy or Alexander tear it up."

panthers,3btos5,faultlessjoint,2,Fri Jul 3 23:20:58 2015 UTC,"Norman is better than Tillman at this point (by a good margin IMO).  I also suspect Benewikere sees more snaps than Tillman.  I predict Norman and Benewikere will be the starting CBs.  When we run the nickel Benewikere will slide over to be nickelback and Tillman will take his spot on the outside.  EDIT:  To whoever's downvoting, care to provide a counter argument?  Tillman only played 2 games last year, and 8 games the year before that.  Plus he's a 34 year old CB.  CB's, similar to RBs, rely on athleticism more than any other position.  Look around the league, I seriously doubt any team in the NFL has a starting CB who is 34 or older.  Who knows if he'll be healthy again and even if he is healthy, I seriously doubt he has the athleticism left to keep up with #1 WRs.  EDIT 2:  In fact here is an /r/NFL thread from a couple months ago showing that there is not a single starting CB over the age of 31: https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/2ytv1m/there_are_currently_no_cornerbacks_on_an_nfl/"
panthers,3btos5,YourNewStepDad69,2,Thu Jul 2 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"I agree completely with you. I would be impressed if Tillman plays more than 12 games and isn't a liability out there. Once a corner loses his speed, their play deteriorates rapidly."

panthers,3bsfv1,Reneau,23,Wed Jul 1 23:09:03 2015 UTC,"I'd say 17 is right about where I'd put him. He's a mediocre coach in the NFL. He's not great, he's not bad. He probably would've been fired if he didn't go all Riverboat Ron on everything. He's awful coming off of a bye week (have we won a game yet with an extra week to prepare?). He's an okay coach."
panthers,3bsfv1,ThePensAreMightier,13,Wed Jul 1 20:53:20 2015 UTC,"He's also a young, first time head coach.  Fans are so critical.  You know everyone has growing pains, they don't just become the best coaches of all time.  Belicheat was fired before he won a superbowl."
panthers,3bsfv1,jeremydurden,15,Wed Jul 1 22:10:53 2015 UTC,that doesn't invalidate anything that /u/ThePensAreMightier said though.  Just because you see him as having the potential to be better doesn't make him better than he is.  I like Ron as a players coach but his time management skills need work and I think that while he has a strong defensive background he relies too much on Shula for the offense.
panthers,3bsfv1,ThePensAreMightier,6,Wed Jul 1 23:18:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't say he was bad. He's a mediocre coach right now. A lot of that is due to growing pains as you said but when ranking coaches right now you cant just be like oh well he's a first time head coach, let's move him to 12 from 17."
panthers,3bsfv1,Battmans_Hooters,3,Wed Jul 1 23:34:32 2015 UTC,"Most coaches are pretty mediocre to start out. Coaching has a lot to do with experience and taking L's and learning lessons from them.

The rest will come in due time and maybe with a better offensive mind talking in his ear."

Of course, the counter argument to that is a better coach would not have put the team in a position to melt down to begin with.    The important thing is that, in my opinion, he has done better every year and is learning on the job.  So many times coaches are canned before they have an opportunity to learn and improve.  I'm glad Rivera has had that opportunity."

I have a feeling Boykin will return to 2013 form and will be a nice weapon for Cam. I don't think a 6th receiver is going to be much of an impact player for us though.   I don't know the current status of everyone's practice squad eligibility but, assuming everyone else is eligible, we'll probably keep Hill and Byrd. I don't think there's a lot of upside to anyone else."
panthers,3btn9w,Extric,2,Thu Jul 2 03:07:18 2015 UTC,Boykin   Really?  I haven't heard one good thing about him in OTA.  He'll need a good training camp.
panthers,3btn9w,young__sandwich,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:29:22 2015 UTC,"I just think Boykin is a little bit more proven than the other remaining receivers. If he can perform like he did in 2013 then I don't see any need in keeping any of the others.   To be honest though, I'm like 65% sure we won't keep a 6th receiver. It's probably better to use that roster spot for OL or RB depth since injuries have been a pain in both areas lately."

The problem is he didn't do it in camp, so i'm questionable if he can return to form, he also had one of the best QB's in the game throwing to him in 2013..."
panthers,3btn9w,young__sandwich,2,Thu Jul 2 13:38:28 2015 UTC,I believe Bersin is going to edge out either Cotchery or Boykin. Cam trusts him and he's a teachers pet. Rivera and Proehl love that kid.

Hill was drowning panther news sites in hype, and as the hype receded, the Bersin hype grew mainly, it seems, because no one thought he'd have a chance at making the roster again.  I would be stoked if KB, Funchess, Hill, Brown, and Bersin are on the roster come the start of the year."
panthers,3bn47f,young__sandwich,3,Tue Jun 30 17:26:17 2015 UTC,"Bersin will make the roster because he can mentally execute anything the coaches would ask of him. He's smart and picks up on things quickly and that makes him versatile. Hill, I believe to be not as smart.. And I don't think he'll make the roster. To be fair though, Rivera said he almost got pulled up last year for the seahawks playoff game. I think Corey was dealing with an injury or something."

You really think we let a guy with as good of hands as Bersin go for Stephen Hill   Did you read anything I wrote?  Are you going to read anything I'm writing now.   The dude flat out sucks.   The dude sucked with the jets.  But so has a ton of other players.  I blame the management.

panthers,3bn47f,young__sandwich,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:48:29 2015 UTC,Stephen Hill is 6-4 and ran a 4.3something 40 at the combine. He also just turned 24 a couple months ago. I'd absolutely give him a chance over a guy who probably wouldn't make an NFL roster other than ours.
panthers,3bn47f,BOATSANDHOEZ,3,Wed Jul 1 18:42:48 2015 UTC,Sorry but I've been off the Bersin train since that Cardinals playoff game. There have to be better hands on our roster.

I'd have to double check that...I'll just do it real quick.   Greg Olsen - 68% KB - 50% Cotchery - 61% Brown - 58% Bersin - 65%   Yup...that puts Bersin at second only behind Greg, and leads all receivers catching percentage.

panthers,3bkcy5,biggin528,5,Mon Jun 29 23:53:54 2015 UTC,"This.  This is what I'm most excited about for 2015.  Our front 7 has always been strong enough overall to keep us a top-10 defense in the Rivera.  I don't think Boston had a great year in 2014 but he shows promise and our CBs are actually above average for the first time in a LONG time.  I'm pumped to see how our defense looks with our rookie DBs having another year under their belts, Norman finally coming into his own, and obviously the addition of Shaq.  We need a stud safety but we have a pretty solid unit next year."
panthers,3bkcy5,BlindWillieJohnson,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:26:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure we need a stud safety, given Thompson's ability to drop into coverage."
panthers,3bkcy5,biggin528,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:35:20 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean he can cover both positions at once.  He can play one of the two successfully on any given play.  Either way we are leaving a liability on the field somewhere be it Harper/Jones or Klein/Glanton.  Plus Boston has not proven to me he can be a consistent threat.  Give me a stud safety to solve that problem and I'm happy.
panthers,3bkcy5,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Tue Jun 30 01:11:43 2015 UTC,"Boston was a rookie. For a rookie, he played pretty well. Rookie secondary is tough, no matter what the position."
panthers,3bkcy5,biggin528,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:14:44 2015 UTC,"True - and I have high hopes for him.  He is also playing slightly out of his element considering he was a SS in college so you're right, he played incredibly well for a rookie, all things considered.  But that doesn't change the fact that he had a very mediocre season.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  He will probably grow, but he may not.  There have been plenty of players open with a rookie season like his and then never really get much better.    I'm just saying don't count your chickens before they hatch.  Safety is our defensive liability for 2015.  I'd almost be tempted to say that the DE spot opposite CJ will be supbar as well but I think we have enough bodies there to pull some talent from somewhere."
panthers,3bkcy5,Hawkince,2,Tue Jun 30 01:23:04 2015 UTC,"Charles Tillman, and Josh Norman at corner, with that Kind of Linebacking Core? Holy shit Im ready for some Football. That D Line is incredible too, even with the loss of Greg Hardy, you have Charles Johnson, Star Lotulelei, Kawann Short, and Mario Addison/Kony Ealy. That kind of defense can stop any Offense, even the Patriots."
panthers,3bkcy5,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Mon Jun 29 23:53:01 2015 UTC,Don't forget Benwikere and Alexander.
panthers,3bkcy5,Hawkince,2,Mon Jun 29 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"Roman Harper, and Tre Boston too!"
panthers,3bkcy5,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Mon Jun 29 23:57:23 2015 UTC,"I do love Boston, but it's really hard to muster any enthusiasm for Harper. With the rest of hte defense clicking, he should be about average."
panthers,3bkcy5,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Tue Jun 30 00:03:33 2015 UTC,"Just a reminder, Harper finished 3rd in tackles last year behind your boys Luke and TD."
panthers,3bkcy5,Cael87,2,Tue Jun 30 01:22:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he sucked in coverage."
panthers,3bkcy5,BlindWillieJohnson,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:27:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he sucked, there were mistakes and mis-reads made but that can happen to any player who is adjusting to a new system.  He performed quite admirably for us, considering.  With more familiarities there will be less misunderstanding of what his role is, and with more range across the field his lack thereof will be hopefully less noticeable.  I think it'll be a good season.  I'm most concerned about our pressure on the QB.  No matter how little we like to admit it, our pass rush has never been the same since Hardy's departure.  We have some talented players on the d-line, no mistake about that, but we need someone to step up, or the group to make strides in general to make this year special."
panthers,3bkcy5,christianhashbrown,2,Fri Jul 3 17:28:37 2015 UTC,"No matter how little we like to admit it, our pass rush has never been the same since Hardy's departure.   No doubt. I don't think the pass rush will be as good as it was in 2013, but moving CJ to the right side is the right decision. That should help. If Alexander lives up to the hype from the coaching staff and Ealy continues his forward progression, we could be looking at a good enough group. We won't know what we have in them until the pads go on in practice, but I get the feeling that if the rush is serviceable enough, the improvements to the secondary can make the defense as good at limiting points as it was two years ago."
panthers,3bkcy5,biggin528,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:45:23 2015 UTC,"True that. I think Shaq will take over his role in a lot of situations. He was a tackle-machine because he was good in run coverage. Pass coverage, not so much.  But Shaq looks like a Big Nickle Joker to me, which is how they used Harper at times last year, so I expect his tackles to go down this year."
panthers,3bkcy5,christianhashbrown,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:37:32 2015 UTC,I'm just worried about GB. If we can't get some serious pass-rush I'm afraid Rodgers will pick us apart.

Our team has the talent to make it a close game with them, we just...don't do it."
panthers,3bkcy5,AbsurdSpud,8,Tue Jun 30 21:05:28 2015 UTC,"Im starting to notice a pattern, in each team. Like really good players for a team in a certain positions like throughout the franchise. Like panthers for example: In the early days you have Kevin Greene and Lamar Lathon, in the middle ages you have Jon Beason, and Julius Peppers (yes he played DE for them but he is a good LB it turns out), and of course now, you have Thomas Davis, and Luke Kuechly. The BEST Linebackers in the NFL right now, and no shitty ass 49ers fan is gonna tell me otherwise."

panthers,3bjzd3,scotttr,-1,Mon Jun 29 23:07:42 2015 UTC,"Definitely, sure it's nothing like a Jordy Nelson, and Randall Cobb, or a Jimmy Graham and Chris Matthews, but the panthers definitely have something special."

panthers,3bjzd3,biggin528,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:14:03 2015 UTC,lmao. Chris Matthews? You don't know him?
panthers,3bjzd3,endernyc,12,Tue Jun 30 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's just a far reach to call him any sort of stud in the pass-catching field of the NFL.  Putting him in the same group as Jordy, Cobb, and JG is a bit much haha.  His potential is incredible (as seen in the playoffs last year), but he's not on the same level as those other guys yet. :P"
panthers,3bjzd3,biggin528,3,Tue Jun 30 00:30:41 2015 UTC,I get his Super Bowl was a great performance but he also caught 4 passes in preseason and none in the regular season.   Interesting to see what he does but his SB success was more about picking on Arrington.
panthers,3bjzd3,SpaceIsAPlace,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:24:57 2015 UTC,"Well he only played 19 snaps in the regular season (8 of which were passing plays) and Wilson is not necessarily the most proficient passer in the league.  I get that it was not necessarily his route running that put him in an opportunity to make plays in the SB, but I'm sure you saw the catches that kid made.  That takes talent to do what he did and when he gets to refine his skills a bit he can be a threat much like KB.  They're a lot alike, it just seems like it took Matthews a longer time to understand the WR position at an NFL level."

panthers,3bjzd3,christianhashbrown,2,Tue Jun 30 16:40:36 2015 UTC,"I was tempted to go through because I'm a sadist. This comment by Kenyahte Daniels was actually one of the smartest things I've read about our WR and Funchess.   Big thing about Funchess is he can play all the WR's positions, see most guys can't do that, they only learn one. He alreadys knows them all, how many times have you seen a 6'5"" guy in the slot?????? Right you don't, but he learned them all because he had to in Michigan and by having a crap QB there it actually helped him out more then it hurt him, Football is about mismatches, we already have two established pass catchers on the team (KB and Greg Olsen) now you have a Corey Brown who has worked his but off in the offseason to get better, add in some more vets like Boykin, Ginn and an improved Stephen Hill, plus now a very confident Devin Funchess who understands the importance of being very versatile and you have a team who can create a lot of mismatches. Now i know the nay sayers will always say if and put us down as a team because lets just face it, the world is a hateful place, I aint mad at yall, bring the fuel for the fire, we can only take our bumps as they come, but one thing is clear, none of you haters will ever matter to us, let alone the Roaring Riot which is the Carolina Panthers, Keep Pounding, All Day Everyday and Twice On Sundays"

panthers,3bji7p,endernyc,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:01:45 2015 UTC,Cause a 4.7 40 is sooo slow /s
panthers,3bji7p,Sobrelavida,3,Mon Jun 29 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"It really is, but the more likely explanation, looking at his tape, is that he just had an off day at the Combine."
panthers,3bji7p,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Mon Jun 29 20:45:12 2015 UTC,"True, but at his size he can compete with TEs. While his 40 time wasn't the best, not only can he improve it but 4.7 is not bad for someone his size, granted Jimmy Graham ran a 4.56."
panthers,3bji7p,Sobrelavida,2,Mon Jun 29 21:10:45 2015 UTC,"That's the argument though.  He isn't lining up against slower LBs as a TE.  He's lining up against faster DBs as a WR.  If he legitimately ran a 4.7 and was playing on the outside, he would be in some serious trouble in terms of finding open space.  Bottom line is he doesn't run a 4.7 so it doesn't matter either way.  But I can see the argument if that were the case."

panthers,3bixqc,biggin528,3,Mon Jun 29 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you once again for this.  Fantastic read. Loved what you said about Bell, both the good and the bad. It definitely seems Gettleman is trying to not only provide depth at positions, but also versatility, by having guys who can play different positions, as you had mentioned. Enjoyed reading your thoughts on Remmers and Williams.  They seem to be part of our OT future.  That being said, do you think Gettleman has plans for either of these guys to compete at LT...eventually?"
panthers,3bixqc,young__sandwich,2,Mon Jun 29 17:43:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  In regards to LT future, I think it's hard to guess at this point.  My opinion is that Williams doesn't have the footwork to keep up on the left side.  Remmers could but it seems like Gman/Rivera are pushing to have him be Kalil's replacement a few years down the road.  I am hoping so badly that Oher works for us.  Losing Gross may have been the biggest loss to the team (emotions aside) that the Panthers have dealt with in the last decade."
panthers,3bixqc,young__sandwich,2,Mon Jun 29 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"I hope Oher works out for us as well.  Though I don't see him as a long term solution but even if LT is our weakest link on the Oline, as long as the rest of the Oline holds up, we should be able to disguise that weakness a bit.    Absolutely Gross's departure has been a difficult one.  I do think our future LT is still in college, but I'm curious at the potential of Remmers.  It was fun watching our line start to click at the end of last season.    I'm excited for this season!"
panthers,3bixqc,The_Chrononaut,2,Mon Jun 29 18:27:27 2015 UTC,Tackle is definitely the big question mark going into the season.   I like Remmers but if I remember right Seattle embarrassed him during the playoffs.
panthers,3bixqc,enfyte416,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:56:45 2015 UTC,They did.  Embarrassed might be too light of a term.  It was a very sour note to end the season.
panthers,3bixqc,MisterRandyMarsh,2,Mon Jun 29 18:59:42 2015 UTC,"Many think that Oher is at least an immediate upgrade over Bell, and in terms of just flat out no context talent he probably is. As far as the 2015 season is concerned, I think he is probably going to start out worse. He will only have one offseason to build rapport with the other members of the O-line and Cam. I think the adjustment players need to make is very understated when trying to project how they will fit onto a different team, as most just assume that Oher > Bell so he will immediately seem that way on the field. Oher can be an upgrade but it's going to take some time and fans are going to need to be patient with him for the first half of the season."
panthers,3bixqc,skippapotamus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Like I said I really don't think Bell was as awful as most do.  He was thrown into a new position with a terrible surrounding cast.  Oher at least has experience at LT though, and watching his mentality this offseason is very telling as to how his preparation has been.  I look forward to seeing what he can do for the team but my expectations are tempered for the start of the season.  Same for our rookies.  They will all need time to acclimate."
panthers,3bixqc,BananaGooP,2,Mon Jun 29 21:03:49 2015 UTC,"I'm crossing my fingers we snag Isaiah Battle in the supplemental draft. I'm a Clemson fan so I'm a little biased, but it seems like we could really use a LT to develop behind Oher. He would probably cost us a 2nd round pick though."
panthers,3bixqc,BananaGooP,2,Mon Jun 29 20:46:45 2015 UTC,I just recently saw something on him.  Definitely an intriguing opportunity!
panthers,3bixqc,Squats_and_Bacon,2,Mon Jun 29 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"hate to be that guy - Gross wasn't at LT his entire career.   I believe things will look better because the ball will come out quicker and the team will regress back to a lower amount of pass attempts.  But, I'd like to hope things can be good enough that we'll see Olsen blocking less."

Brown muffed a punt at around his own 13-yard line. Although Brown was able to recover and pick up the ball, the play only got worse for the Panthers.  Brown fumbled the ball for a second time, and the football got kicked around a bit before the Steelers' Robert Golden recovered it in the end zone for the touchdown.  http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2206530-panthers-philly-brown-fumbles-twice-on-punt-return-steeler-recover-in-end-zone  Definitely do not remember him recovering his fumble for a return TD happening, when was that?

panthers,3bfn5b,letownia,15,Sun Jun 28 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll be a high quality starter but he will be consistent. He can still find the holes but he has lost some of his burst. He is still pretty damn good in open space, not to take it to the house but to gain extra yards."
panthers,3bfn5b,benwinkle,9,Sun Jun 28 20:25:44 2015 UTC,Consistent 2 yards
panthers,3bfn5b,WumboJumbo,7,Sun Jun 28 23:36:04 2015 UTC,"Ten 2 yard runs, then busting out a 50 yard TD, that's Deangelo for you."
panthers,3bfn5b,SickBurnBro,2,Mon Jun 29 16:46:32 2015 UTC,I still remember that saints game I think 2 years ago when cam had that option pitch to him and he took it for like 60 yards.  EDIT: not really relevant but it's the play I remember most from him.
panthers,3bfn5b,benwinkle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:35:27 2015 UTC,"The one thing that sticks out in my memory of Deangelo was a game where he scored 4 TDs, all from one yard out. The next game he only scored 1 TD, but it was from 40 yards out. Was a very DWill thing to do"
panthers,3bfn5b,The_NC_life,10,Wed Jul 1 19:59:46 2015 UTC,"I'm intrigued to see what he can put together this year. Keep in mind, his mother passed away from a long battle with breast cancer last year. I don't think his head was right all season long. Hopefully he's healed from that some and has a bigger appetite on the field again.  He's a solid dude and an excellent locker room guy."
panthers,3bfn5b,Spiralyst,13,Sun Jun 28 20:46:30 2015 UTC,He's highly underrated.  Just look at his career and season-by-season ypc.  He's currently at 4.8 ypc on his career.  To put that in perspective:  Jamaal Charles: 5.5  Adrian Peterson: 5.0   Deangelo Williams: 4.8  Demarco Murray: 4.8  Lesean Mccoy: 4.6  Arian Foster: 4.5  Frank Gore: 4.5  Marshawn Lynch: 4.3  Matt Forte: 4.2
panthers,3bfn5b,faultlessjoint,9,Mon Jun 29 05:29:34 2015 UTC,"With a good line and good play-calling he can still be a very serviceable RB.  He looked pretty vanilla in Carolina because Shula would run him up the middle twice every set of downs, and our line wasn't consistently giving him gaps.  I'll definitely be real interested to see what he does for the Steelers. Barring injury, I reckon he'll prove to be a worthwhile pick-up."
panthers,3bfn5b,I_GROW_WEED,5,Sun Jun 28 20:33:36 2015 UTC,His success will largely depend on your guy's O-Line and blocking from WR.

panthers,3bfn5b,young__sandwich,4,Mon Jun 29 13:37:41 2015 UTC,"I've heard people say he could have been one of the best backs in the league in his prime if he wasn't load sharing by committee. He's over the hill obviously, probably best suited to a committee now, but not totally burned out, GREAT personality and great team member, stand up guy, and I'm sure he can still find his moments to shine.  When I think of D-will I just think of his big huge smile for some reason, he reminds me of one of my friends with the pleasant grin."
panthers,3bfn5b,net403,4,Mon Jun 29 06:42:12 2015 UTC,"Past his prime now, but a decent committee member and a fantastic locker room presence. He'll always be welcomed by Panther nation for what he did for this team. His career never got the appreciation it deserved outside of the Carolinas."
panthers,3bfn5b,ja1484,3,Mon Jun 29 13:13:44 2015 UTC,Last year he was injured and had just lost his mom.  I loved d.will and in 2013 he was a fucking beast.  Being cut is what he needed to motivate him.  I expect he will be impressive this year and maybe next for you guys before he tappers back off again.    D. Will is gonna be badass this year for you I think.
panthers,3bfn5b,Magnuts,3,Mon Jun 29 00:20:32 2015 UTC,"He's older, but he'll be a good foil to Bell. Much like Stewart, Bell seems to be best when he power runs up the middle DWill shows his best when he's moving side to side or in screens. Expect him to come in as a rotational back or a screen option."
panthers,3bfn5b,YotsubaSnake,3,Mon Jun 29 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"He has less mileage on him than you might expect, but age is age. If he's completely healthy, he's still good enough to hold down a starting spot on a lot of teams. The problem is, when is he ever fully healthy?    Still has good burst, but he's not going to be turning nothing into a five-yard gain very often anymore.  Underrated hands coming out of the backfield, which Fox's OCs consistently underutilized.  Definitely shouldn't be anything other than a big plus off the field and in the locker room."
panthers,3bfn5b,Aurion7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:12:47 2015 UTC,"High quality starter? Not anymore, last season you could tell he had lost a good bit of his burst and just couldn't match up with his always insane vision. However, as the second hand in a RB rotation he should still be an effective runner. You'll get consistency, a hard worker, and he's still liable to break off some chunks here or there."

panthers,3bca18,Hawkince,16,Sat Jun 27 21:18:03 2015 UTC,"As of today, Wilson deserves more money. But I think Cam has more potential, and once our support cast gets to Seattle's level, I think Cam will be better."
panthers,3bca18,ryamason,2,Sat Jun 27 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, Wilson, has that Defense, along with Marshawn and that O Line, don't forget Cam was sacked the most in the league, and he lost his whole receiving core in last offseason. Yet he stays consistent. Devin Funchess will definitely help though."
panthers,3bca18,mrpasquini,0,Sun Jun 28 22:07:01 2015 UTC,"Wilson's oline sucked last year. Cam still had stewart who balled out at the end of last year. They're comprable, but remember, every team has its shortcomings."
panthers,3bca18,mrpasquini,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:45:13 2015 UTC,"Wilsons O line sucked? How did Marshawn Lynch not do bad? Besides Cam's O line was worse, he was sacked the most in the League, and he's a mobile QB, plus he lost his starting RB for most of the season."
panthers,3bca18,Vanelz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"Pass protection and run blocking are two different skill-sets. If you remember, Stewart ran like hell through the last 5 or so weeks behind a line that was competent in run blocking but still had Byron ""Lame Leg"" Bell holding the LT position. Our O-Line started to get its shit together at the end of the year.   PFF ranks their line two spots ahead of ours. Wilson was running for his life a good part of last year. Just because they were successful doesn't mean that every part of their team was efficient; no reason to get angry.   https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2015/01/08/2014-pff-offensive-line-rankings/2/"

Wilson only deserves more because of what his TEAM has accomplished. If you don't perform on a team that has accomplished great things you get replaced and during that time Wilson has done some great things, not that he is more amazing than Cam, but he has done those great things while they have gone to the Super bowl.  I'm just glad we got Cam signed."
panthers,3bca18,Daeavorn,9,Sat Jun 27 21:30:25 2015 UTC,"I have a theory that if Cam and Russell were to be swapped, both teams would still have put up similar performances over the past few years."

panthers,3bca18,BagelsAndJewce,7,Sun Jun 28 12:58:44 2015 UTC,While Russell Wilson has been on a better team he also deserves more money than Cam. Wins equate pay and at the end of the day Russ has what Cam doesnt and thats playoff success and a Super Bowl. Its not Wilsons fault all the other teams passed on him and he ended up in a favorable situation.
panthers,3bca18,AbsurdSpud,11,Sat Jun 27 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely, Newton has way more of a workload, but if they swapped I honestly think the panthers would do worse."
panthers,3bca18,nutt_butter_baseball,12,Sat Jun 27 22:15:46 2015 UTC,"Wilson. That's not a knock on Cam, but Wilson has slightly better stats and a lot more team success.   Wilson deserves a slightly better contract for his success in the league."
panthers,3bca18,AbsurdSpud,2,Sat Jun 27 21:39:59 2015 UTC,I think this conversation comes down to one thing and one thing only. Wilson went to two bowls and won one. If that isn't enough to get more than what is essentially his equal who's done less I don't know what the fuck deserves money in this league.
panthers,3bca18,Magnuts,4,Sun Jun 28 06:26:57 2015 UTC,"Seattle's Defense is obviously All Time, but their offense has never been stellar in the passing attack, I think Cam has easily had a better WR corps year to year compared to what Wilson. Lynch is obviously a huge factor but I still think what Wilson has done with the Elite D and HoF RB is impressive.   I know a win is a win, but the Falcons win over the Seahawks Wilson's rookie year was one of the ugliest wins I've seen. If the Seahawks win that game they play the Niners who they destroyed about a month before and even though the game would have been in Frisco I doubt they lose. So he could have possibly gotten to 3 Super Bowls in 3 years.  I personally hate Wilson, but I do think he's a very good QB, and I think right now he is worth more than Cam. I'd rather have Cam though, he's more exciting, I like how genuine he is, and I think his ceiling is crazy and I love watching him grow as a player."

panthers,3bca18,Bleacherbum95,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:51:12 2015 UTC,If you want to blame the call then you can say the packers should have been in that game because of the terrible call to run the ball 3 straight times and give it back to the seahawks when they had the game won.
panthers,3bca18,net403,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:11:53 2015 UTC,What is his playoff record?
panthers,3bca18,donfrenchiano,3,Sun Jun 28 13:54:50 2015 UTC,"Really hard to say.  Wilson has achieved more, and he's more accurate.  An accurate, winning QB has tremendous value, and he is a guy who can create, just as with Cam (who hasn't been as consistent as Wilson on accuracy, or winning).   But I watch the Seahawks, and Lynch carries them.  Wilson has to do only so much out there - a fair portion of which is outside the pocket, to the point where, if you contain him to the pocket, he's really somewhat limited.    Plus, the team concept he's in - which he has nothing to do with, but definitely benefits from - really doesn't require he do as much as Cam.   You put Wilson in Green Bay, yes. He will be successful.  He will be accurate.  But he's not getting away with those rainbow throws.   He gets away with those, because that O suckers you into cover 1 or man, and he can drop it past the defender - which, even with a good run game, Rodgers (or more to the point, I guess, Cam) doesn't ever have.   Wilson makes his throws, but a lot of his throws are easy. It's hard to know what he'd look like, if he were carrying it on a level that Cam, or even Eli Manning for instance, was carrying."
panthers,3bca18,xzElmozx,2,Mon Jun 29 15:34:37 2015 UTC,"A ring always get more money. I'm happier we have Cam, but Wilson deserves more money at this point in time."
panthers,3bca18,donfrenchiano,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:12:40 2015 UTC,"Hard to overlook the rings factor when getting paid, but Andrew Luck is probably going to get the biggest haul of them all just based on potential alone, that's sort of what they do contracts on a lot is paying for what you have to figure they can do.

Wilson has a top rated Defense, along with Marshawn Lynch, a.k.a beast mode, along with a good O line and plenty of depth."
panthers,3bca18,G060,2,Sat Jun 27 21:19:13 2015 UTC,"Your delusional. Did you see Seattle's recovers last year?  Olsen and Kelvin are better then them a mile.  Also Seattle's oline isnt a lot better than ours, better than ours for sure but not by much. There was a stat on /r/nfl that Wilson was pressured the most out of all qbs. The only thing  you could argue with is that Wilson has a better defence.  I think Wilson has better accuracy and is is clutch af when needed."
panthers,3bca18,btbessaay,2,Sun Jun 28 01:13:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, and i'm not just trying to join the Cam dickriding, but Wilson creates a lot of the pressure that he receives. What I mean by that is he rushes out of the pocket before it's actually collapsing because he feels pressure. Then he rolls out which creates the facade that he had no other choice. I haven't watched many Seattle games but I saw him do the same thing many times in the few I did watch."
panthers,3bca18,G060,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yea but even if he does that he still hits the open receiver 9/10 times. Yea sometimes he does run out of the pocket for no reason,  but most of the time it's when it collapses."

panthers,3b6yp8,Wayyside,10,Fri Jun 26 13:54:28 2015 UTC,I think it's really early to claim Funchess is better than Benji.
panthers,3b6yp8,Thatwhichcamebefore,6,Fri Jun 26 15:57:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is his argument. He is claiming that Funchess is a better prospect and that there is a good chance that he will be a better intrinsic player. As of next year, Kelvin will still be the better option. But down the road he doesn't think so."
panthers,3b6yp8,Thatwhichcamebefore,2,Fri Jun 26 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"I get what they're saying, I just think outside of the size comparison they are very different players. Kelvin had a great rookie season and until we see what Funchess can do in the big leagues it's a bold assumption. However, if he is truly as good as the reports coming from the coaches claim I could be very very wrong."
panthers,3b6yp8,Cael87,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:23:48 2015 UTC,"Funch was a joy to watch at Michigan, I was astounded what the man did with such a pathetic, pathetic... pathetic, really pathetic passing team.  He never had a real QB throwing to him, he had a couple WRs that could throw (allegedly).  The kid knew everything, was on top of everything, was a sponge for what he could pick up.  He was routinely focused and specifically doubled because of his ability to adjust and make catches above and around.  He was moved, he was changed around, he played different roles, but the entire time he was a gigantic threat on the field and drew defensive coordinator's attentions.  Not only that, but even with mediocre stats at times he kept his head down and never complained about it.  I'm excited to see what he will learn here and what he can bring to the table for us."
panthers,3b6yp8,JCoxRocks,4,Sat Jun 27 08:33:05 2015 UTC,"Is it also too early to claim that he eventually could be?  This was a topic of debate at work the other day, and although it is way too early to tell, it certainly is a possibility."
panthers,3b6yp8,Thatwhichcamebefore,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:34:33 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely not, Funchess could very well end up being the the better receiver down the line, but the article summing up the video claims he already is and on top of it if he were not over shadowed a bit by a few other receivers in his rookie class, Kelvin had a phenomenal rookie season. He did hit the rookie wall hard, and had some bad drops, but he greatly exceeded most of our wildest expectations. That's all I'm saying."
panthers,3b6yp8,Sloppysloppyjoe,5,Sat Jun 27 00:20:31 2015 UTC,This guy has pretty good analysis if you stick with him throughout the entire episode. Pretty interesting dynamic that we can expect with Funchess's addition to your team.

panthers,3b6yp8,WorkingLikaBoss,3,Fri Jun 26 19:00:43 2015 UTC,I tend to feel the same way. Let's think about it. Funch was said to be slower but suppose let had a 4.4 40 time when Carolina worked him out. He has a better route understanding than Benjy did coming in and honestly the knock on funch is his hands. And that's the X factor. I think funch is better but if his hands keep him on the left side of cam. I'm happy let speed work to our advantage on a #2. Honestly different teams (and corner packages) will handle them differently.
panthers,3b6yp8,Vanelz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:40:14 2015 UTC,"Holy shit that guy is terrible. He says his joke is that Benji = Gargamel. And his reasoning is, ""Benji is big. If he were the same size as a DB he wouldn't be in the league. He doesn't have the skill set.""  And then spends several minutes claiming that's a joke.  No fuck face, it's an analogy."

panthers,3b6yp8,WorkingLikaBoss,2,Fri Jun 26 16:52:29 2015 UTC,"He's saying he doesn't have the skill set to be a WR if he were the size of a DB. If that were the case, the NFL would just go out and hire all the NBA centers. Size alone isn't enough to be successful in the NFL."
panthers,3b6yp8,YourNewStepDad69,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:55:49 2015 UTC,He's saying that if KB didn't have the huge size advantage that he does then he would not be skilled enough to survive in the NFL. And he's right. KB has gotten a lot better at route running and his speed is underrated but if he was of average size (all else being held the same) I don't think he gets drafted.
panthers,3b6yp8,G060,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:11:40 2015 UTC,"Haven't listened to it yet, but why would KB be a DB?  KB is a possession receiver. He's not the best anything in terms of wide receivers but he stepped up his first year into a #1 role where he was guarded heavily by defenses.   I expect KB to get guarded like that again this year mainly due to Funchess being an unknown but once Funchess and Greg start putting up the numbers it will open up KB more.  I still think KB will continue to perform even while be heavily guarded.  Edit: Also KB was a ROOKIE"

panthers,3b3r3f,BeerMeBooze,3,Sat Jun 27 01:48:55 2015 UTC,we would be very far down the draft order in the supplemental draft since we won a playoff game last season. even if we bid a 6th or 7th round pick for him it's very likely that a team with a higher supplemental draft position would do the same and take priority over us.
panthers,3b3r3f,TomNJ,2,Fri Jun 26 09:04:28 2015 UTC,If no team selected him and we could sign him as an undrafted free agent?  Hell yes.  Otherwise no it's not worth giving up a draft pick.  What was his draft stock had he come out in the regular draft for argument sake?
panthers,3b3r3f,robbierebound,3,Sat Jun 27 02:03:37 2015 UTC,"I'm a Clemson fan. He didn't stick out to me as being worth a supplemental draft pick. If he had entered the normal draft I would have been content drafting him as high as the 5th round. That being said, Clemson and the Panthers run almost the same style offense, (I think Clemson's is more complicated) and it'd be nice to have a fast, aggressive tackle on the practice squad to develop. Draft pick-no. Free agent-yes. Lets not forget about a certain WR who like to punch people...."

panthers,3b3r3f,longlivethepharoh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:54:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I should have elaborated. Of course an NFL playbook is going to have more plays and requires more homework at home. What made Clemson's offense under Chad Morris ""complicated"" was the audibles and speed. In Shula's offense, the only audible calling you're going to hear is Cam, and then the minor blocking call by Kalil. Under Morris, and I'm sure it's going to stay the same under my old coach Jeff Scott, WR's are allowed to make audible calls. Also, the option is more complicated as well as faster due to the amount of options available as well as movement in the backfield both before and after the snap. Even on passing plays, the routes set up faster and the window of opportunity for your #1 and #2 guy is smaller. Perfect example of this would be the last Clemson vs. Carolina game if you feel like looking up video. I understand, that pro will always be better than college, I just feel that Shula's quantity over quality while Morris was the opposite."

Interesting to hear that Boykin has been a no show for the most part. I think that opens up the roster for the best of Bersin/Hill to maybe squeak onto the roster. I also think that pretty much assures Cotchery a roster spot assuming we keep 6 WR's with the last spot going to Hill/Bersin."
panthers,3b2ngx,datboijustin,2,Fri Jun 26 07:38:59 2015 UTC,We'll know a lot more about these guys at training camp.  It's a lot different when the pads go on.  I'm not expecting much out of Hill - Jets fans say he's scared of contact and can't catch for shit.  He always looked great at OTA's when they weren't in pads.  Hopefully Boykin looks better because I had high hopes for the local guy.

Real talk though, you feel like a little girl crying at a Justin Beiber concert. You line up afterwards and players line up to sign autographs and you're yelling their names like a paparazzi camera man on the red carpet. My girlferiend got mad at Luke for skipping her on an autograph! I don't want to be mad at Luke for that kinda bullshit. Cam came by and refused adult autographs and only signed kids. I understand but it's like, what can these guys be thinking with grown men calling their names for autographs all decked out in panthers stuff in the Spartanburg heat.

Oh, you can also get autographs at the end but you might want to lineup by the gate about 30 minutes before practice ends to get a decent spot. I'm pretty sure some people start standing at that gate from the beginning of practice. I hope this helps a little bit."

panthers,3b1lx4,bootlegoutkast,5,Thu Jun 25 12:25:57 2015 UTC,"And it's not like we have to abandon the ball control mentality either. We can still milk the clock but restrict the opposing defense's ability to substitute in the process. I'd also like Cam to have more time to survey the defense, call audibles, set protections just right, etc. instead of rushing to the line and furiously clapping for the ball.   Just looking at Auburn/2011/2012, Cam is at his best in the no huddle, where he can stay in a rhythm and capitalize on mis-matches."

panthers,3b0k9p,BananaGooP,8,Thu Jun 25 00:18:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on about all accounts except for Ron. I like the guy, and I believe in him. I believe that he has done nothing but improve his game and I believe that his presence in the locker room cannot be over stated. I believe that the players play harder for him and give more due to his influence. I believe that most of the dislike of him comes from either his in-game management (which I think he is continuing to improve on) or from his philosophy on football in general (smashmoush defense and a stout run game that sets up the play action). I think he can definitely lead us to a Superbowl and multiple if we get lucky. I think he's extremely intelligent and a hell of a people's man. He isn't a Belichick, but there's only one of him and tbh I'm happy with our Calculated Risk Taker Ron."
panthers,3b0k9p,WorkingLikaBoss,8,Thu Jun 25 01:21:41 2015 UTC,"I think people need to realize a bit that most HC's need to grow and develop at their ""position"" much like any player on the field. This was Riveras first shot, sure there are kinks and we get frustrated at times, but the coach he is now is miles ahead of where he was, in my opinion."
panthers,3b0k9p,kingbowsa,3,Thu Jun 25 03:40:58 2015 UTC,Spot in with my line of thinking on him. Rivera has really grown on me
panthers,3b0k9p,ewok_bukkake,4,Thu Jun 25 17:57:43 2015 UTC,"My dislike for him comes from the 0-4 or 0-5 record he has after bye weeks.  I enjoy his philosophy and his in-game isn't detrimental.  He is a very likeable guy but I don't think he prepares the team as much as is needed to actually win a Super Bowl.  When given a break to prepare for the opponent a coach should have his team thoroughly prepared and ready to feast especially during the regular season when your opponent doesn't have the same luxury.  I agree he has gotten better, but this is the one area he has made no progress in and I'm not sure if it's because he is a lenient coach who gives his team too much freedom or because he simply doesn't know how to prepare the team properly"
panthers,3b0k9p,liamc11,3,Thu Jun 25 04:24:59 2015 UTC,good point. we have a bye week before we got to seattle this year. it could be a very defining game for our season. if we win that game u could say that we have a little rivalry going on which is always fun
panthers,3b0k9p,WorkingLikaBoss,6,Thu Jun 25 04:57:36 2015 UTC,"If we win against Seattle after a bye week I will fully believe Rivera can take the team to the Super Bowl.  Unfortunately beating seattle is already a tall order, mix in his predisposition for poor play after bye weeks and it seems near impossible."
panthers,3b0k9p,WorkingLikaBoss,3,Thu Jun 25 05:29:12 2015 UTC,"I think that while the 0 and 4 thing looks horrific, it could also be terribly misleading because four anything is a really small sample size."
panthers,3b0k9p,ManualIncorrect,3,Thu Jun 25 04:52:06 2015 UTC,The 0 and 4 thing may be a small sample size but it is also his entire coaching career including a playoff game after a season with a record of 12-4.  He had all the time in the world to fix the issue he has with bye weeks and knows that it is an issue and yet the problem persists.
panthers,3b0k9p,skippapotamus,2,Thu Jun 25 05:28:02 2015 UTC,"Statistics say otherwise. Just because the career numbers of football coaches are commonly much too small to be reliable for statistical use doesn't mean we can say ""oh, well let's just use what we have."" The problem is what we have may be incredibly misleading and we would never know it. 4 of anything is simply not enough for a true statistical analysis."
panthers,3b0k9p,MisterRandyMarsh,3,Thu Jun 25 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"See I disagree when given a full year of time to improve in-between each bye week game.  Saying 4 of anything is simply not enough for a true statistical analysis is like saying Brady's 4 Super Bowl wins are statistically inaccurate of the level of quarterback that he is.  A lot more goes into winning a superbowl than the actual number, in a similar fashion more consideration should be given then the number, it should rely more on the preparation that occurred during the extra week leading up to the bye week game and how he handles his troops in times like those."
panthers,3b0k9p,skippapotamus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:37:23 2015 UTC,History of early bye weeks?
panthers,3b0k9p,skippapotamus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:39:11 2015 UTC,"Both yes and no they have had a week 5 bye a week 9 bye a week 12 bye and a week 6 bye since 2011.  The game after the week 12 bye? The Vikings(5-7) game last year 31-13 in which the players clearly were not ready to play especially on special teams.  Week 5 bye loss to the Cardinals(3-2) 22-6, 2013. The week 9 bye 30-3 loss to Tennessee(5-4), 2011.  Week 6 bye loss 19-14 Cowboys(3-3), 2012. Post Season bye week loss to 49ers(12-4) 23-10 with poor play from all."
panthers,3b0k9p,skippapotamus,7,Fri Jun 26 23:18:41 2015 UTC,"Shula's run game is more varied in disguise formations, and in core concepts, than most.  Some teams are power teams, some teams are zone teams, and some are zone read teams, we do all three with a lot of disguise around it in formation, motion, and shift.   He's too conservative, but part of that's Rivera.  Playing a team concept here, not just chucking the ball up."
panthers,3b0k9p,liamc11,3,Thu Jun 25 02:27:06 2015 UTC,"Once again it isn't necessarily that I think Shula has a bad system, it has a lot more to do with the weapons on the team.  If you look at what Chudzinski did with Newton's talents and the weapons around him in comparison to how Shula has used Newton you see some disparity.  Chud maxed out the potential of the offense whereas Shula seems to be holding it back from reaching its potential by trying to force players into specific roles/ positions instead of playing to their strengths."
panthers,3b0k9p,AbsurdSpud,3,Thu Jun 25 04:27:46 2015 UTC,"Opponents didn't have nearly as much tape on Newton in the Chud era. Also, comparing an injured Newton with a brand new receiving corps is a bit unfair, IMO."
panthers,3b0k9p,skippapotamus,2,Thu Jun 25 13:22:46 2015 UTC,"depends on how you look at it.  Chud was willing to waste 2nd and 3rd down throwing deep, now you're punting in your own territory.  Shula's setting up makeable 3rd downs and taking time off the clock, so now you're moving upfield.  Which maxes out more?"
panthers,3b0k9p,skippapotamus,2,Thu Jun 25 14:07:52 2015 UTC,See I never said Chud was a good play caller.  Shula isn't terrible at play calling; the biggest issue is he doesn't use the weapons on the offense to their potential.  A great example of a guy who does this is Gus Malzahn.  He arranges the offense to cater to the strengths of the QB currently in his system.  This allows the offense to flow much better and produces great numbers(Of course this is in college so take it with a grain of salt). Shula on the other hand forces the pieces he is given into what his system requires which is not a very good thing to do when it requires taking away the natural abilities of some of the key components.
panthers,3b0k9p,AbsurdSpud,2,Thu Jun 25 22:42:25 2015 UTC,"fair enough - in that case, if you want to hit me with ways he's misusing guys, I'm interested.  From my viewpoint, he used pieces in the passing game better in '13 because he had the right guys; the only longterm lament I have for his personnel usage is not getting the backs enough balls in the passing game.  Definitely, in my opinion, he's not using Cam poorly."
panthers,3b0k9p,BStothepowerof2,2,Fri Jun 26 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"I think he is using Newton poorly, mostly because Newton cannot play as a game manager which is the style of play Shula needs in his system.  Newton is a run and gun guy, Shula has him pretending to be a dink and dunk Bradyesque guy who Newton will never be. I agree with the running backs needing more receptions.  I also don't think it should be about ""the right guys"" he should be able to mold his system to fit the talents the players provide.  In 2014 he needed a speed WR, when he didn't get it he didn't change the style to suit the more physical receivers he was given.  He also did not disguise the weaknesses that certain players have very well which in turn allowed the defenses to capitalize on said weaknesses like poor route running and o-line push pull techniques"
panthers,3b0k9p,BStothepowerof2,3,Fri Jun 26 01:33:59 2015 UTC,"don't know if I fully agree, but that's OK.  Again mid-12 Chud was pushed, or chose, depending on where you decide Rivera's intentions, and Cam became more efficient.  He still made downfield plays, and he has with Shula, too.  You have to not throw a ton of INTs to succeed in this league, so I can see that approach.  There are times he still threw up too many desperation deep balls (again, NO first game '14) and too many times where relying too heavily on him to do everything has hurt.   I believe there will be more physicality at WR than years past, and the team will still run a lot of 4 verticals, and I'm fine with that.  There's more speed, and thank God for that."
panthers,3b0k9p,Cael87,3,Fri Jun 26 02:35:56 2015 UTC,"i think were right on the cusp of making a SB appearance. maybe a playmaker in the secondary, a hauss in the oline, and i think we need a different OC. it could be a lack of execution on the part of the players but way too many times im left scratching my head after play calls"
panthers,3b0k9p,lokigreybush,2,Thu Jun 25 05:11:18 2015 UTC,"It's been brought up before, but Chud was anything but conservative and that's who Rivera brought in, so it kind of throws a wrench into that idea."
panthers,3b0k9p,unoffensivename,2,Thu Jun 25 04:13:10 2015 UTC,"Chud wasn't conservative at all initially.  The second half of 2012, he absolutely was, and Rivera hastened that change.  What we saw from the offense around that point - not coincidentally around the time the defense got a lot better - started during Chudzinski and is the same thing we're doing now during these playoff runs.    I don't know.  I think the core criticism of Shula - and there's plenty to logically criticize - is that he's somehow ""holding back"" this offense by playing for 3rd down and taking calculated shots instead of continuous shots.   And I don't agree with that being a flaw (again he has his), or his flaw.  That's a Rivera thing as much as it is Shula."
panthers,3b0k9p,Spiralyst,3,Thu Jun 25 14:10:30 2015 UTC,"Felt like I should separately address that concept - where he has his flaws.  First, I don't believe he lacks for imagination.  Chud dug deeper into tricks, but Shula has his.  There's nothing this current team doesn't do - it's not like the Henning years (what's a screen pass??) or Davidson years (what's a pass?), or the Seifert regime (what's shotgun?).     What I see is a varied formation, shotgun heavy, spread attack.  In 2013 (because I don't have 2014 data in my head), Carolina used 3 WR about 70% of the time, shotgun 75% of the time, and split a TE out 50% of the time (obviously Olsen, and separate from the personnel concept of 3 WR since that could be ambiguous).   That's a pretty progressive offense, which based on that data and my older-school thoughts of what a ""power running offense"" is, it's amazing that things like using Gun on 75% of snaps is still more a ""median"" approach than aggressively using it.  To me, ""conservative"" is a SF offense that ran 22 personnel around 30% of the time last year.   So it's conservative in teaching a Qb to try to take what the D is giving, setting up 3rd down and executing it (again Chud's O was great on 1st and 2nd, trash on 3rd).  It uses advanced concepts like spread ideals and packaged plays, of which only a smaller amount of NFL teams use currently.  It uses a read option that half the league doesn't even touch yet.   Yes, there's a part of it that's 80s Redskins, but there's a fair part that's straight Chip Kelly.   My criticism is that it didn't use enough packaged plays/no-huddle, and that's somewhat conservative.  But in the amount of time we used it, it was irregular to both control time of possession and go no-huddle.  It still somewhat is.   I'd also say that the Coryell trope of having both a vertical and horizontal spreading of the defense sometimes doesn't help Cam when he wants to dig in and Rex Grossman every pass (1st NO, where he seemed to desperately chuck deep no matter what).  Shula and Co can't control what Cam reads and decides to a point, and if two routes are short but he keeps hitting the deep, I don't know what you do - you can't just give everybody 5 yard routes all day, either.    It's a thin line.  I like the approach, I would hope for the late-season Cam control of the line of scrimmage to continue, and to go to the hot hand a bit more.  We have a long way to go.  But for the approach we're trying to use, we do that well.    If you want a different approach, I can dig that, but there are sound reasons to do what's happening, and that's what our head coach wants."
panthers,3b0k9p,jnewt,4,Thu Jun 25 14:25:33 2015 UTC,"I used to be adamantly anti-Shula, but I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt. I wasn't bashing Shula at all, I've been on his side after he finally let Cam use no huddle in non-blowout situations. What I'm hoping is happening is that Shula is growing the offense with Cam, and that's what it seems like is happening.  I think we can use no huddle and still play ball control, Peyton is the no huddle king and he used to regularly snap the ball with the play clock on it's last clicks. I don't even think we need to use no huddle all that much, I'd be fine with the offense doing the slow plodding huddle up style if we just let Cam run it to open each half and if we're not holding a lead. Cam seems like a different QB when he can run the no huddle, it seems to get him in sync immediately and that's the main thing that drove me crazy watching last season you know? If Cam's on point and the offense is doing the long huddle ups it's fine, but when he's struggling those huddles just seem longer, slower and filled with doom.   I actually am excited to see the offense build off of last season, I really hope Shula's plan comes to fruition."
panthers,3b0k9p,scotttr,4,Thu Jun 25 16:33:23 2015 UTC,"I'll have to disagree with you on the Sean McDermott part buddy. I believe Sean is THE best DC in the league right now. He was an apprentice of arguably one of the greatest DC's the NFL's ever seen, Jim Johnson. He still uses the best part of Jim's defense, the LB coverage's and blitzes, but has improved the DL's involvement. What makes me a big fan of his is that he can work with whatever you give him. He makes schemes and plays that throw offenses for a loop, but are simple to learn and execute, which makes them that much deadlier when you have intelligent players such as Johnson, Luke, and TD. The only real argument you have against him is pass coverage, but very rarely is that due to a bad play call or coverage. Usually it's a failure of a player, simply not have the ability (Captain) or just getting beat mentally (Decoud). I agree that he will never be a HC, but it's not from lack of skill. In my coaching circles, we call guys like him ""Q's"", referencing James Bond's equipment guy. These coaches understand football on a whole other level, and seem to have an answer for everything. They just lack general leadership skills or the charisma to be an HC. TL;DR- McDermott is defensive gold and should outlast Rivera, even if he brings us an SB ring."
panthers,3b0k9p,liamc11,3,Thu Jun 25 06:03:19 2015 UTC,"I completely understand your opinion and its really well thought out and thank you for providing this for a good read.  I am not sure if I agree with him being the best DC in the league because there are a few guys who I still might put above him like Teryl Austin or Vic Fangio.  I have a question though, what happened in Philadelphia that lends to many of his detractors?  Once again thank you, this was an awesome thing to read on McDermott."
panthers,3b0k9p,skippapotamus,3,Thu Jun 25 22:47:36 2015 UTC,"Austin is solid and I'm very excited to see what Fangio and Fox will do together in Chicago.   In Philly, I think McDermott just had some serious bad luck. It was among one of the worst years for injuries for the Eagles, which would be a huge challenge for even the saltiest coach. Combine that with McDermott being wet behind the ears, it wasn't pretty. They gave up some 31 passing touchdowns that year and had the worst redzone defense in the league. Even though Reid defended him and wanted to keep him on, I think his own job security as well as political pressure from the front office led to Sean's firing. (Sean and Andy are still great friends to this day) Many in Philly forgot that he coached and played a huge part in the development of Pro Bowlers Brian Dawkins and Micheal Lewis.  The fact that our redzone defense has been one of our strong points, as well as young DB's who have only known Sean's defense are becoming household names (Bene, Josh) shows that either Philly was a fluke because of injuries, or in the very least he has made the proper changes since then and has developed into an elite DC."
panthers,3b0k9p,scotttr,3,Fri Jun 26 07:05:24 2015 UTC,"The problem with LaFell wasn't that Ricky didn't train him up well.  He's just one of those players that takes longer to 'get it'.  He was and is a physical specimen with good instincts but raw mechanics and concentration.  Ricky molded him into a good player by the time he left and the Pats have one of the best WR coaching staffs in the NFL.  LaFell seemed like a guy who didn't put in as much effort as he should himself, but got a chip on his shoulder when we didn't put in the effort to resign him.  We let him walk due to him doing too well for us to afford him.  Aside from that, nice write up!"
panthers,3b0k9p,TubaMike,3,Thu Jun 25 07:10:46 2015 UTC,I agree that LaFell's progress had a lot more to do with him than Proehl but who has Proehl really developed?

panthers,3aytrj,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Thu Jun 25 13:16:29 2015 UTC,"Cam's rookie year was under a different OC, and on a team where we were often playing from behind and trying to make up the difference. We have a whole new approach under Shula. We don't pass much. We don't pass much, and when we do, it's usually short to intermediate.  That's not an indictment, mind you. The 9ers and Seahawks are always in the bottom of pass attempts. When you have a stout defense that keeps your opponents from scoring, running the ball, maximizing time of possession and limiting turnover risk is just smart football."
panthers,3aytrj,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Thu Jun 25 15:23:53 2015 UTC,"IIRC, we weren't playing from behind at all Cam's rookie year, we were blowing 4th quarter leads.

I'm out in Los Angeles and I haven't heard many people say Cam was worth it, it's always qualified with the whole 'well that's what you pay a Franchise QB' or 'he could be worth it one day'.   Don't get me wrong, there hasn't been a lot of people saying it was a terrible idea and that we'll regret it(although there have been a few) but not many are saying Cam is worth all the money. It's a subtle difference bordering on semantics and I really hate semantics, but I didn't hear a lot of praise about it, most of the coverage I heard was more of a shrug 'well what're you gonna do' type thing.

panthers,3b0yl4,Captain_Thatch,6,Thu Jun 25 02:19:22 2015 UTC,I just read some scouting reports on Peters and apparently his deep speed is a concern.
panthers,3b0yl4,Lipshitz2,2,Thu Jun 25 03:47:04 2015 UTC,Thank you. Thats what I was looking for. Not sure he could play corner in the NFL then. Safety maybe? He doesn't have the size but he has the ball skills clearly.
panthers,3b0yl4,christianhashbrown,2,Thu Jun 25 03:51:41 2015 UTC,He's pretty physical too
panthers,3b0yl4,BStothepowerof2,5,Thu Jun 25 13:04:49 2015 UTC,"As a Clemson fan, I got to watch both of these guys play a lot. I believe Peters deserves a spot on the roster and could be a good cheap guy to have on the roster for awhile. He does have speed issues, and preferred to play deep. But he has great timing and was awesome at run stopping and blitzes. I do agree that he would be much better in the NFL as a safety. I know he'll never be a pro bowler, but I think he'd be a cheap solid football player to keep on the roster for awhile.  As far as Byrd goes, practice squad at best. His work ethic seems to lack, and around town he never really seemed to care about football compared to most of the other Carolina guys I'd run into. Plus, roster's already too deep at WR."
panthers,3b0yl4,skippapotamus,2,Thu Jun 25 06:13:06 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I dont watch too much college so this is useful. Sounds like a good depth at strong safety?
panthers,3b0yl4,CarlosGrimes,3,Thu Jun 25 06:27:33 2015 UTC,"A healthy Peters might make the 53, depending on health of a guy like Houston; I don't know that they'll pay a vet to be 4th best corner and maybe have to play special teams.    Byrd is a practice squadder.   Both just my opinion, of course.  Roster looks to be too deep to think either will really be counted on."
panthers,3b0yl4,ThisDerpForSale,2,Thu Jun 25 02:42:32 2015 UTC,4th cornerback job could also go to Melvin White or Colin Jones over either of these guys. Gonna be interesting
panthers,3b0yl4,christianhashbrown,2,Thu Jun 25 22:25:11 2015 UTC,"Byrd does one thing - he runs really fucking fast.  Beyond that, he is, to put it politely, a project.  He has terrible hands, he doesn't run good routes, he can't seem to learn a complex route tree, and he's undisciplined.  But he's really fucking fast.  I can see him as a practice squad prospect if he shows any promise of learning how to be a professional wide receiver.  I hope that can happen, but I'm not optimistic."
panthers,3b0yl4,MisterRandyMarsh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:21:41 2015 UTC,"Peters is going to have to modify his playing style if he ever wants to get on the field in the NFL. In college he was really physical and would be fighting with the receiver down the field, that kinda stuff gets you flagged in the NFL"
panthers,3b0yl4,CarlosGrimes,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:06:37 2015 UTC,"that kinda stuff gets you flagged in the NFL   Unless your name is Richard Sherman. Seriously though, don't pay too much attention to those writeups. Take a look at Sherman's draft profile:   Sherman is a size prospect with some good intangibles that will help him mold into a contributing backup corner for a press-heavy team. However, he does not possess the natural coverage instincts, fluidity or burst to be considered a future starter. Is comfortable and capable in press man, using his size to disrupt receivers' releases off the line, but doesn't show enough make up speed to consistently recover when beaten. Awareness in zone and off-man are only adequate. Has average ball skills but some upside as a playmaker. Tough against the run but still developing from a technical standpoint."
panthers,3b0yl4,MisterRandyMarsh,0,Thu Jun 25 23:08:14 2015 UTC,We will likely cut both and try to sign them to the practice squad if they pass waivers.
panthers,3b0yl4,CarlosGrimes,2,Thu Jun 25 11:53:18 2015 UTC,Peters was a highly sought after UDFA. I see no chance of him going unclaimed if he doesn't make the Panthers roster.
panthers,3aze9e,Lipshitz2,10,Wed Jun 24 18:53:59 2015 UTC,noooooice!
panthers,3aze9e,randomassname89,7,Wed Jun 24 19:17:44 2015 UTC,So uh...what are we going to do when he eventually gets a head-coaching job?
panthers,3aze9e,TheCarolinaPanthers,15,Wed Jun 24 20:24:10 2015 UTC,Let Luke be the DC.
panthers,3aze9e,TheWhiteBlur,3,Wed Jun 24 20:42:03 2015 UTC,Frankly I think Rivera is behind our defense. The man built 2 number one defenses in San diego and Chicago. While McDermott was pretty terrible before
panthers,3aze9e,fuckyourcatsnigga,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:44:52 2015 UTC,He wasn't that bad in philly. Their fans overrate his poor coaching. He was 12th in YPG and 19th in PPG his first year and 12th in YPG and 21st in PPG his second year. Not to mention Stewart Bradley was pretty much hurt both of those seasons and Dawkins just left for Denver. Those were two tough pieces to replace.
panthers,3aze9e,arcangel092,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:31:44 2015 UTC,Ok so he was average? With many of the same players that were a top 5 defense under Jim Johnson
panthers,3aze9e,fuckyourcatsnigga,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:02:24 2015 UTC,I mean he wasn't shit though. Honestly there wasn't much of a reason to fire him. Especially with how they ended up replacing him with Juan Castillo.
panthers,3aze9e,arcangel092,2,Fri Jun 26 11:46:57 2015 UTC,Hope he fails and hire him back a year later. I wouldn't mind having Chud back.
panthers,3aze9e,Angry_Apollo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 00:19:25 2015 UTC,Secondary coach Steve Wilks is the likely candidate.  However if someone from around the NFL that Rivera has worked with before becomes available it's definitely possible he hires externally.
panthers,3aze9e,robbierebound,0,Wed Jun 24 21:00:40 2015 UTC,McDermott does not belong in the conversation for top 10 defensive coordinator... I think he is probably dead last in skill level. He doesn't deserve a head coaching spot at all... Might as well just stay with the Panthers if he has to...   EDIT: Wow.. This was total sarcasm so we won't let him go.. Yeesh thanks guys...
panthers,3awq42,mattpacman96,10,Wed Jun 24 02:56:20 2015 UTC,F.T.S.
panthers,3awq42,kylemilton,3,Wed Jun 24 04:06:58 2015 UTC,You make a good point...
panthers,3awq42,DishoveledPanda,39,Wed Jun 24 06:46:24 2015 UTC,"Uhhh. Drew Brees gets old and Cam Newton continues his upward trajectory with some marked improvement in accuracy and completion percentage.  Other than that, it's not ever going to happen. Look, I love Cam, but Drew Brees is a first-ballot Hall of Fame QB. Cam is still in the process of making his case as better than Matt Ryan. Let's not get carried away here."
panthers,3awq42,irspangler,8,Wed Jun 24 05:07:53 2015 UTC,"At the same point in Brees career he was stil trying to prove he was a starter, then he had a solid year after being considered a bust. Brees wasn't considered good until his 5th year and didn't enter elite status until he joined Payton and the Saints.  Not saying this means Cam will be better but it's premature to say it'll never happen. Cam needs to make some big strides this year though if he wants to enter the conversation.  Sorry if I'm just repeating shit in the video I couldn't watch it.  edit- clarity"
panthers,3awq42,AbsurdSpud,3,Wed Jun 24 13:37:44 2015 UTC,"It's not a good comparison.   Brees was trying to prove he could play the position to people who thought he was too short and not athletic enough. They knew a host of starting-caliber NFL QB's were about to enter the NFL (Eli Manning, Philip Rivers, Big Ben, Aaron Rodgers) and Brees had a horrific shoulder injury trying to recover a fumble that some people weren't even sure he would ever be able play again.  The difference I would draw between the two is that - when Brees got to New Orleans, Payton tailored an offense specifically to suit Brees' ability/intelligence (as opposed to a Run Heavy/Play Action offense he ran in San Diego that never, ever suited him). I don't think Brees improved as much as the environment/team/circumstances around him improved.  Cam, on the other hand, we can tailor the offense to him all day long, but it's not in his best interests (RE: his health) because it will be read-option heavy. Short-term that's okay, but long-term, you want to see his passing improve. He's not close to there yet. Can he become a good passing QB? Absolutely! I expect him too or what's the point? But he still has work to do on that.  TL;DR - I don't ever expect him to reach Brees' passing level, just like I don't ever expect Drew Brees to one day be 6'6"" 260 lbs - because he doesn't need to in order to be a great QB. What makes Brees great is not what makes Cam great and vice versa. If Cam was going to be Football Jesus and one-day combine Drew Brees' passing ability into Cam Newton's athletic body, we would know it by now.  EDIT: a word."
panthers,3awq42,irspangler,3,Thu Jun 25 01:21:47 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. I'd get what you just said if we were talking about Manning, but Brees was fighting just to be considered a starter. You can argue about his size all you want but he was replaced by an even shorter and older Doug Flutie.   My point is that Brees wasn't great or even good to start his career, he got better. I get why you'd say Cam will never be the passer Brees is, but at the same point in their careers Brees wasn't there either. The comparison is actually pretty damn good, except that Cam had a much better start to his career. You're argument is off, cause Cam and Brees were both good but not great going into their 5th years.   Are you really gonna compare the offenses they were in? Shula spent over one and a half seasons putting Cam in a bland SLOW moving offense, the talent level around Cam has varied but never been all that great outside of Olsen. Brees had good talent, he also had one of the greatest RB's of all time in his prime that could run and catch, along with one of the best FB's. They also had Turner to spell Tomlinson.   I don't agree that the best offense for Cam would be run option heavy, that seems reductive. He should have the freedom to run, but I think a no huddle where the threat of his running is constantly in the back of the defenses mind is ideal. Cam has never been a run first guy, but his ability to run is too good to ignore.   If I had to bet on it, no I wouldn't say Cam is gonna be the passer Brees will. But Brees is the perfect example as to why Cam can still become an elite passing QB. He's possibly the worse example you could use to say that Cam won't take the next step as a passer."
panthers,3awq42,AbsurdSpud,3,Thu Jun 25 04:10:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah we all (read: most) love Cam but this is comparing apples to oranges.  Cam is not a pure passer like Brees.  The QBs with the elite passing stats are the ones that get recognized...for now.  The new age is dual-threat, a trend that Cam began before Wilson, Luck, Kaep, Jameis, etc.  Cam will never be what Drew Brees has been, but that doesn't change the fact that he can be what the Panthers need him to be."
panthers,3awq42,biggin528,3,Wed Jun 24 14:19:20 2015 UTC,"Is Jameis really going to be a dual threat?  I didn't watch him in college, but from what I hear he's not a running QB at all."
panthers,3awq42,Shovelbum26,3,Wed Jun 24 15:49:18 2015 UTC,"God no, he cannot run."
panthers,3awq42,Sharpshooter90,3,Wed Jun 24 17:32:17 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you. I think people are beholden to the idea that Cam has to ""surpass"" Drew Brees. There's no real way for him to do that.   Cam is a specimen onto himself and if he's slinging the ball around like Brees does...well, it would represent a real transformation. I'm not saying Cam is stupid, he's obviously a really bright guy, but Brees' whole game is built on using his mind/anticipation/preparation to overcome his physical limitations. He's the polar-opposite of Cam. Cam could study the playbook and game film for the next 10 years and not understand football as well as Drew Brees does (and that's perfectly okay because Brees will never be 6'6"" 260lbs).  So like you said, apples to oranges. Brees will get old and Cam will surpass him that way, but putting the pressure on Cam's passing to ""surpass"" Brees' is pointless because it's never going to happen."
panthers,3awq42,irspangler,2,Thu Jun 25 01:04:02 2015 UTC,"Cam didn't start the running QB trend, but he was the first of a long line of running QBs. There were running QBs before him (Vick, Vince Young, Culpepper, McNabb, Steve Grogan)  P.S.: Jameis is not a running QB, Mariota is though"

panthers,3awq42,Armageddon_It,5,Sun Jun 28 13:00:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. Cam Newton is not a HOF QB by itself. It's his rushing, athleticism, power, and 'make you gasp' ability that will eventually get him in the HOF assuming a slight boost in his current trajectory. Of course, taking us to the promised land would help Cam like it did Brees."
panthers,3awq42,Angry_Apollo,5,Wed Jun 24 05:24:44 2015 UTC,"He's got all the tools to do it. That alone is worth salivating over. But he still has a long way to go. We've gotten by so far on a great defense and a strong running game that has really beaten him up - and it would behoove us not to expect that to last forever.   I'm really hoping for a career numbers year from Cam this year. He needs it. We need it. The world needs to see the next level from him and this new contract suggests ownership has already seen it in practice, etc. So I'm optimistic but...shit, I'm also worried for my QB's life too sometimes.  Edit: English. I speak it."
panthers,3awq42,irspangler,4,Wed Jun 24 05:30:09 2015 UTC,Our running game only looks good because of Cam. The last times I saw such a dominant running game by the RBs besides the last 6 games of last year was back when Smash and Dash were in place with a fantastic 3rd Mike Goodson. A year later Tolbert in short yards. Of everything Panther writers are excited about nobody mentions the bowling ball Mike Tolbert.
panthers,3awq42,Angry_Apollo,3,Wed Jun 24 05:50:51 2015 UTC,"I think that's largely because Tolbert looked awful a lot of last season.  He was dropping a lot of passes, which is supposed to be one of his strong points.  I also heard he was overweight (even for him) by the end of the season and was not playing with the burst he usually has."
panthers,3awq42,Shovelbum26,4,Wed Jun 24 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"Not ever going to happen? Cam turned 26 last month....what was drew brees doing at that age(or 25 since cams most recent season was at 25)? Matt ryan was a game msnager/captain check down at his age. Even aaron rodgers went 6-10 at cams age. Cam isn't perfect, but I love how everyone acts like cam can't any better..when most qbs get exponentially better between ages 28-32...it's like everyone recognizes his unlimited ceiling but people think he's maxed out already. This kid will always be doubted it seems like. Eben by his own fans"
panthers,3awq42,fuckyourcatsnigga,3,Wed Jun 24 14:30:34 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of this comes down to what people have seen from other mobile QB's as they enter their late 20's and early 30's.  QB's that have the accuracy and vision to turn a broken play into a complete pass have a different career trajectory than QB's that rely on their legs to make something happen on that broken play.  That's not to say that Cam can't (or won't) be a QB that can do it with his arm once age and the physical toll of the game begins to limit what he does with his legs.  I personally think he has all the tools to do just that.  The question is, will he, or will he still try to be that scrambling QB?  We just have to look at recent examples like Culpepper and Vick to see a QB that was elite in his 20's and relied on his legs becomes a mediocre QB (or even a backup quality player) when those traits fade."
panthers,3awq42,Shovelbum26,3,Wed Jun 24 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"At 25, Drew Brees had just made the Pro Bowl after going 11-4 with the Chargers - with a 27 - 7 TD/INT ratio, a 65.5 completion percentage, and a 104.8 QB rating for the season. He would regress a year later somewhat, but we're talking about (in my opinion) the most specialized player in the NFL - he's too short to play the position and his arm isn't very strong (relative to the rest of the starting QB's in the league), but his mind, timing, preparation and the offense built specifically around him in New Orleans allow him to excel in ways that no other quarterback in the league enjoys - and frankly, the NFL is the better for it (though, we as Panther fans, are not.) I would argue that Thomas Davis' entire position has become - ""Stop Drew Fucking Brees"" - which lately has been - ""Fuck up Jimmy Graham until he quits."" And he's become a master of it. But Brees deserves every bit of praise he's gotten, and it's for this reason - he has squeezed every ounce of potential out of his career (at least, I think so.) I don't see that from Cam yet, but he looks like he's headed there. He's certainly saying all of the right things, and that makes me optimistic, but I hate drinking the kool-aid just for the kool-aid's sake.  Aaron Rodgers is a really bad example given that it was his very first year as a starter. He threw for 28 TDs against only 13 INTs with a 63.6 completion percentage and 93.8 QB rating - that's a phenomenal stat-line for a first-year starter! Cam has never completed his passes at more than a 61.7% clip in any season. But he says his goal for the season is to get that number up to 65%, at least. That's good! That's exactly the kind of thing a 5th year starter like Cam needs to be focusing on.  And Matt Ryan is not, and never has been a game manager/captain check-down. Please get that garbage out of here. The guy is, at the very, very least - a serviceable starting-caliber QB in the league. The Falcons have been shit on defense for as long as he has been in the league, save for one year - the only year they did well - and lo and behold, they tore off 14 wins. Now, could he be damaged goods by the time they manage to surround him with a competent team again? That might be a conversation worth having, but he's never been a scrub. He's regularly in or around the Top 10 QB's in the league - the same group Cam is starting to hover around.  I'm not trying to throw shade on Cam. I'm trying to be realistic about my expectations for him. How exactly is he supposed to pass Drew Brees? Unless its going to be with his legs, as in an offense heavily skewed toward the run-option like Seattle utilizes (and even then, are you really going to say he ""surpassed"" Drew Brees), I'm not sure it's ever going to happen. But that doesn't mean we don't win Superbowls, does it? Fuck no! If Seattle can do it, so can we.   So before you say I'm doubting him, I'm not, I'm doubting the type of QB that Cam is surpassing the type of Hall of Fame QB Brees is. There's no precedent for it yet. I would love to be wrong. I hope I'm wrong. But I haven't seen anything yet in his passing game that is extraordinary. He has a lot of work to do there. There's no harm in acknowledging that."

panthers,3armk1,pespence,5,Mon Jun 22 23:14:59 2015 UTC,I think that the no huddle... combined with Cam looking for a safety valve/checkdown more often instead of going for broke would be two of the most important areas our offense could use to be successful this season.
panthers,3armk1,JCoxRocks,3,Tue Jun 23 01:26:13 2015 UTC,"This was the most frustrating thing about last season, Cam is clearly better in the No Huddle, and it took us months to start using it outside of late blowouts. Looking toward the future though I can't wait to see this used over the course of a season, if Funchess can use his size as a blocker and receiver then we could really exploit defenses with our size mismatches.   The other thing I love about using this is that Defenses always have to take Cam's running ability into account, I want us to run him less but just the threat of him running can open things up for everyone else."

panthers,3aouau,Aurion7,11,Mon Jun 22 09:28:13 2015 UTC,"Right, that's what bugged me. He's definitely overpaid, but he's still a really good DE with a lot of upside left."
panthers,3aouau,unc54,7,Mon Jun 22 09:44:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say he has a lot of upside left but he is definitely one of the top 4-3 DEs out there.
panthers,3aouau,skippapotamus,2,Mon Jun 22 13:19:28 2015 UTC,"I would, in fact, make that statement.  He was tremendously young, he's now, what, 28?  This is his prime. I wouldn't necessarily continue to pay him at $12 mil a year, but I'd love him longterm at 9.  He's got 5 in him at the very least."
panthers,3aouau,arcangel092,9,Mon Jun 22 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"PFF had him at number two behind JJ Watt in a few categories (pressures and something else I believe.) That isn't scrub. He's likely overpaid but the fact is we need someone to get sacks and he is at least consistently getting 10 sacks per year, which is what a good DE does. I don't think he's the most overpaid simply with how he isn't a shit player in general. I'd argue Jason Pierre Paul is the most overpaid. He is a good run defender but has really suffered rushing the passer since his beastly breakout year."
panthers,3aouau,enfyte416,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:42:39 2015 UTC,JPP had 12.5 sacks last year. He has been questionable but JPP was paid as much on potential as he was on actual talent and it looks like he's making a comeback. I'm willing to imagine most Giants fans would rather have JPP than CJ.
panthers,3aouau,arcangel092,2,Mon Jun 22 19:03:28 2015 UTC,But the Giants tagged him for a reason. He's injury prone and played well in a contract year. I think the jury is completely out on him.
panthers,3aouau,enfyte416,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:07:24 2015 UTC,Franchise tagging someone is the equivalent of giving him top 5 DE money. The reason they tagged him is because they want to keep him long term but couldn't agree to a contract and knew they would lose him if they didn't... I'd say them tagging him indicates the exact opposite of what you think it does.
panthers,3aouau,arcangel092,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:17:05 2015 UTC,They also didn't want to pay him a long term contract.
panthers,3aouau,enfyte416,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"No, they did want to sign him long term, just not at the money he and his agent were asking for. It's the same reason why Dez Bryant got tagged."
panthers,3aouau,arcangel092,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:45:53 2015 UTC,"Completely different. Cowboys have cap problems and need more time to sign Dez. The Giants aren't sold on JPP and want another year for him to ""prove"" it. They offered him low money compared to what he wants because of his last 3 years of production."
panthers,3aouau,datboijustin,15,Tue Jun 23 02:35:37 2015 UTC,"I think CJ is better than he is given credit for, but he is still WAY overpaid, but really who wasn't overpaid from back then (THANKS HURNEY)."
panthers,3aouau,jcaseys34,5,Mon Jun 22 08:15:50 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: 1. Charles Johnson, 4-3 DE, Carolina Panthers  2015 cap hit: $20.0 million  2015 JVM: $6.2 million  Value differential: $13.8 million  In 2011, Charles Johnson signed a six-year deal with the Panthers. It was structured so that his cap hit would be enormous in 2015, but if he was cut it would give Carolina $14 million in dead money. With the lack of other options on the roster, the Panthers had no choice but to keep Johnson.  The problem is that Johnson is being paid as if he's the best pass-rusher in the league, but he is top 10 at best. In six of the first seven games of the 2014 season, he had four or fewer pressures. While he improved as the season went on, his sack total has been decreasing each of the past few seasons. He was a liability against the run, and his seven missed tackles were among the most for 4-3 defensive ends.  There is no question that he still deserves to be a respectable starter in this league; just not as the defensive player with the largest cap hit in 2015.  2-Mario Williams, 3-4 OLB, Buffalo Bills  3-Eli Manning, QB, New York Giants  4-Calvin Johnson, WR, Detroit Lions  5-Brandon Carr, CB, Dallas Cowboys  6-Patrick Peterson, CB, Arizona Cardinals  7-Adrian Peterson, RB, Minnesota Vikings  8-Jay Cutler, QB, Chicago Bears  9-Jared Allen, 3-4 OLB, Chicago Bears  10-Michael Griffin, FS, Tennessee Titans"

panthers,3aouau,Hawkince,3,Mon Jun 22 13:56:48 2015 UTC,"Is he the most overpaid player in the NFL?  Eh, maybe.  Top 3 at least.  But would I rather a consistent player like Johnson be overpaid for the Panthers or be overpaid for the Falcons?  The choice is easy."
panthers,3aouau,enfyte416,6,Mon Jun 22 17:06:39 2015 UTC,"He deserves most of that money, the problem is the panthers need him, losing Greg Hardy, and having to use Mario Addison, and Kony Ealy means Charles Johnson needs to carry the load. He has most the experience too, and that writer is stupid af, how is Andy Dalton not there? He is a bust, and can not perform in the playoffs, no excuses for a player with that much talent around him, like A.J. Green, or Mohamed Sanu, along with Jeremy Hill, and a good O Line. Yet hes paid Millions."
panthers,3aouau,pompousplatypus,2,Mon Jun 22 13:48:05 2015 UTC,"Dalton has a 9.6 million dollar cap hit in 2015, which is good for a QB who can lead a team to the playoffs. This article seems to be strictly talking about 2015 cap hits, and in that regard Dalton is not very high on the list at all."

panthers,3aouau,pompousplatypus,4,Mon Jun 22 15:17:09 2015 UTC,"This is bullshit, ESPN is dismissive of small market teams in general, in every sport. John Skipper is from Lexington, NC, and graduated from UNC.   Drop the victim mentality, it's very unbecoming."

panthers,3aouau,ThisDerpForSale,4,Mon Jun 22 16:06:55 2015 UTC,"Yo guys. Keep in mind that this writer is only looking at the cap hit for 2015, not the entire contract as a whole. He says that Johnson hasn't lived up to his contract (and most players wouldn't live up to that kind of money) but in the context of what he is saying, I don't think he's so far off.   I wouldn't say he's the most overpaid and I certainly want him on the Panthers, but a serious argument could be made considering he has the 3rd highest cap hit for 2015 in the entire league. I'd argue that no Non-QB in the entire league should break the 20 million threshold. Charles Johnson is being paid like he is a top 3 QB when in reality, I wouldn't even say he is a top 3 DE. He's great, but this isn't just a ""Lol ESPN hates the Panthers"" article. There can be a legitimate argument here. Subjectivity is important to make this place an actual forum of discussion instead of a circlejerk."
panthers,3aouau,enfyte416,2,Mon Jun 22 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"You can't look at a contract in a void like that, though.  His contract drops almost $5 million next season (while the salary cap will go up), and the dead money cap hit drops by over $10 million (if they need to cut him).  And that's the end of the contract - it all comes off the books.  This contract isn't a dead albatross around the team's neck.  It's a temporary, one season blemish."
panthers,3aouau,ThisDerpForSale,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:19:54 2015 UTC,"I mean, you certainly can look at it that way, it would have made more sense if the article was called ""most overpaid player in 2015.""

panthers,3aouau,enfyte416,1 point,Tue Jun 23 09:18:45 2015 UTC,"But . . . so what?  I mean, sure, it looks bad, but in the grand scheme of things, it's rather meaningless.  The whole contract isn't terrible.  It's a huge contract, no doubt, the whole contract doesn't make him the most overpaid player in the league.  Why single out one year?  You could just as easily single out any of the other years of the contract and say CJ is a fairly paid or even very reasonably paid player.  It's disingenuous and misleading."
panthers,3aouau,ThisDerpForSale,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:00:11 2015 UTC,But they aren't just doing it for him. They are doing it for every player in the article. It would be misleading if they were comparing his one year as opposed to any other players full contract but that's not what is happening. They are singling out one year because he is literally looking to see who the most overpaid players of 2015 are. There is absolutely nothing misleading or disingenuous about that.
panthers,3aouau,enfyte416,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:07:07 2015 UTC,"But they aren't just doing it for him. They are doing it for every player in the article.

""Overpaid in 2015"" is meaningless without the broader context."
panthers,3aouau,ThisDerpForSale,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:09:27 2015 UTC,I get what you are saying. I think you are just taking the concept of the article a little too seriously. Yeah it's misleading in the grand scheme of the contract but it never meant to look at the whole contract. It was just an interesting look at how a players numbers project on a model and comparing it to how much he is actually being paid and seeing the difference.   Him saying Charles Johnson isn't worth 20 million dollars isn't a false statement. Like I said. I love having him on our team for the contract we have him but there's no reason for everyone in this thread to be getting upset over the premise of this article.

panthers,3ao1gv,Kessel-,2,Mon Jun 22 19:23:43 2015 UTC,All a matter of opinion but you're obviously going all out for this trip. There are quite a few hotels that are near downtown and the stadium that aren't outrageously expensive. It's nice to not have a long drive in lots of post-game traffic
panthers,3ao1gv,Kessel-,2,Tue Jun 23 00:05:02 2015 UTC,"I like seatgeek for tickets too, but the only way you can guarantee a ticket is via the official site, which is why they are almost twice as expensive there.  I once bought a ticket from one reseller that the user had also sold on stubhub and it totally sucked.  That rarely ever happens, but unless you are OK having to wing it on game day may as well not risk it. If you stay in Huntersville or Mooresville you're going to have a 20 - 25 minute drive to get into the city, maybe staying outside of the 277 belt or somewhere near North Charlotte might be a bit cheaper and still within 10 - 15 minutes, the 277 loop (Where BOA Stadium is) contains the priciest section of uptown to live/stay.  Price's Chicken Coop is a popular place, CookOut is one of the best local fast food places too, depending on where you're located you might be near one.  About things to see, there's the NASCAR museum that shouldn't be crowded if you're into that, lots of great restaurants with bars uptown, Brixx Pizza and RiRas Irish Pub are all nearby, tons of stuff on Tryon St and surrounding area if you park and just go on foot.  There's a Discovery Place interactive museum of science.  NoDa (North Davidson and 36th St) and Plaza Midwood are two great bar strips just north of uptown if you're looking for that as well."

panthers,3ams1v,robbierebound,6,Sun Jun 21 22:12:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't agree with a decision to take Bersin over Jarret Boykin or even Stephen hill really.
panthers,3ams1v,the_Hero_Complex,2,Mon Jun 22 11:08:04 2015 UTC,"Word from multiple sources is that Boykin is dropping everything thrown his way and is a long shot to make the team. Hill maybe, but he has been inconsistent in practice.    Stephen Hill finishes on a down note  ""Stephen Hill has been hot and cold throughout the offseason workouts. Today, he finished on a low.   During drills with the quarterbacks, receivers were practicing catching passes in the corner of the end zone. All receivers did well, except for Hill.   In his first attempt, Hill leaped up for the ball, but could not bring it down. The coaches gave him another try...same pass, same drop, same result.   Finally, as the rest of the team headed to mid field for the next drill, Joe Webb asked Hill to just stand there in the corner of the end zone and catch a pass. That too was a dropped ball by Hill.   Things did not improve for Hill during team drills either, He continued to drop catchable balls.   Dropped passes have plagued Hill's career thus far. It appears those questions won't be answered positively now that offseason workouts are over. Maybe training camp? ""     I'll be honest, I'd prefer to have Hill figure it out and make the roster over Bersin. But right now it doesn't look that way. We still have all of camp though."

panthers,3ams1v,HPUpirates,2,Mon Jun 22 16:08:03 2015 UTC,"From what I read about OTAs was that most of Bersin's competition was not consistent. Boykin and Hill stood out in particular and yes, I know it is early to read into this. But I still think Bersin makes the cut along with KB, Funchess, Philly, Ginn, & Jerricho. Hill really has to prove himself if he wants to make it which he has not done anywhere else."
panthers,3ams1v,hadisious,2,Mon Jun 22 16:05:14 2015 UTC,"One thing y'all gotta remember is Bersin is the longest tenured WR on the Panthers roster right now.  They're planning for him to backup Benjamin, which is basically what he did in 2014.  As long as he's not returning punts he showed the ability to be a solid backup WR, and that's where he belongs."
panthers,3ams1v,robbierebound,9,Mon Jun 22 17:02:46 2015 UTC,"If Bersin weren't an alumni of a certain college, he would've been canned last year."
panthers,3ams1v,HPUpirates,4,Sun Jun 21 21:55:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think he got by because of where he's from and how big of a fan favorite he was. He can be decent at the WR position but damn I hope he never does PR for us ever again."
panthers,3ams1v,TweetsInCommentsBot,7,Sun Jun 21 21:59:00 2015 UTC,He got an invite to camp several years ago because of where he played. He was on the team last year though his talent and the lack of talent at receiver.
panthers,3ams1v,robbierebound,14,Mon Jun 22 00:35:43 2015 UTC,"Doubtful. I don't get why some fans construct a narrative and stick to it when it's obvious it doesn't match reality. Bersin wasn't supposed to be a punt returner and was put in as an emergency for the last couple games.   He's received nothing but rave reviews from teammates, coaches, reporters, and fans who attend practice. Cam apparently has developed a strong rapport with him and he's been killing it in OTAs/Minicamp. Most people who actually pay attention to the team would be surprised if he doesn't make the roster this year."
panthers,3ams1v,HPUpirates,3,Sun Jun 21 22:11:07 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people are really bitter about the goal line INT in the seahawks game. He got absolutely manhandled at the line and fell down, forcing Cam to go to his second read...which turned out to be Kam.  I really didn't expect Bersin to make the team this year mainly because I'm SO hyped on Corey Brown, but after re-watching a few games from last year if Cam is confident with him, might as well keep him around."
panthers,3ams1v,robbierebound,10,Sun Jun 21 22:56:57 2015 UTC,I've watched almost every game since the teams inaugural season and can say I would be shocked if he made the team on skill level alone. He obviously wont play in front of KB or Funchess and Brown and Hill were two of the standouts from OTAs. Ginn is obviously the favorite to return punts and I'm pretty sure my dog with a basket tied to his back would be better than having Bersin back there again. It should come as no surprise that Bersin understands the offense the best as he's been here the longest. Doesnt mean he'll make the team. Panthers will be keeping 5 or 6 WRs and I dont see Bersin being there. In fact I sincerely hope he's not because that would mean we're not nearly as deep at the position as initially thought
panthers,3ams1v,the_Hero_Complex,6,Sun Jun 21 22:49:59 2015 UTC,"Ah man you are seriously underestimating Bersin's ability to be a possession receiver. Reasons like ""he won't play in front of KB or Funchess"" aren't reasons.  He showed last year he is more than a camp body. Keep him off PR duties for sure, but otherwise he is solid depth."

panthers,3ams1v,HPUpirates,2,Mon Jun 22 18:21:06 2015 UTC,We'll see how he looks in training camp.  OTA's and minicamp aside that's when it really matters.  But don't you think it's concerning that the one day the media is watching he plays like shit?  What happens when it's 3rd and 5 on Monday Night Football?  I'm rooting for the guy but he still seems to have the same issues that have plagued him his whole career.
panthers,3alsd0,unc54,26,Sun Jun 21 13:53:17 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Cam. If the reports are true, I really hope we get to see tighter throwing mechanics and better looks from him this season."
panthers,3alsd0,Spiralyst,7,Sun Jun 21 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like those reports turn up every off season. I'm not saying he hasn't improved, but that I take them with a grain of salt."

panthers,3alsd0,BlindWillieJohnson,3,Sun Jun 21 18:28:03 2015 UTC,If this is the answer in December we could be playing in February.
panthers,3alsd0,AbsurdSpud,14,Sun Jun 21 20:56:44 2015 UTC,Kony Ealy was the first player that came to mind for me. Although maybe it's because he's the player i want to improve the most.
panthers,3alsd0,tshimangabiakabutuka,13,Sun Jun 21 14:08:59 2015 UTC,I think Benè is going to become a stud this year. Moreso than he already is.

panthers,3alsd0,YMDBass,6,Sun Jun 21 16:32:17 2015 UTC,I'm hoping Cam makes the most improvement. He has the most untapped potential. And his improvement would have the most positive effects available on other's play.
panthers,3alsd0,Teamrayray,5,Sun Jun 21 17:20:27 2015 UTC,"Josh Norman. He really took a big step last year, but I think this year he becomes an elite NFL corner."
panthers,3alsd0,WeenisWrinkle,4,Sun Jun 21 19:26:55 2015 UTC,"I hope for Cam, Bene, and Kony, at least in Kony's case the microscope is on him to be a man who steps up his game out of necessity so I hope he answers the bell. Frank Alexander should be in this list too with any luck.   I want to take a sign to a game this year something to the effect of ""Let Frank Smoke!"", or maybe ""I Love Smoked Franks!"", instead of pumping the guys up on pain killers, maybe that's his secret sauce"
panthers,3alsd0,net403,3,Sun Jun 21 18:51:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean I think these guys are dumb for getting busted but I really hate how the league doesn't let them smoke.

panthers,3alsd0,christianhashbrown,3,Sun Jun 21 19:01:20 2015 UTC,I'm sure their mothers all agree.  The league would rather give you an opiate dependency with a prescription from the team doctor candy store and banish you to a desert island for taking a hit of weed in July.

panthers,3alsd0,treehau5_,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:54:00 2015 UTC,Doesn't seem to be the case..
panthers,3alsd0,Sharpshooter90,2,Mon Jun 22 16:33:14 2015 UTC,"Norman and Bene, both. Norman because he went into last season with no momentum, missed out on 2013, and still came out as a potential shutdown. This will be the first time he has a consecutive season, which is key to a player's continued growth.   And Bene because he has to compete with a huge name for the second spot. Competing with Tillman means he not only has a great source of play to learn from, but he has to push himself to a higher level to be considered over the turnover machine. I could actually see Bene being the league's next Peanut."
panthers,3alsd0,uniquecannon,2,Sun Jun 21 19:33:55 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on Norman, I think he can become one of the top corners in the league over the next few years."
panthers,3alsd0,In_Liberty,2,Mon Jun 22 01:15:37 2015 UTC,"Since everyone else said Kony Ealy, I'll go with Trai Turner. I think he's got a real shot at being a very, very, very good guard."
panthers,3alsd0,Aurion7,2,Sun Jun 21 22:11:26 2015 UTC,"I've gotta say KB and I don't think it's something that his stats will show. I think he will have fairly comparable stats to last year, but in less targets and with the ball being distributed more. Spectators just want to see his 1000yd season become a 1300yd season, or he's regressed. It's a shame. I think he can elevate his game and be even more useful to the team with a less impressive looking stat line. Less drops, less targets, more double teams, etc."
panthers,3alsd0,AnchorDrops9,3,Mon Jun 22 23:19:42 2015 UTC,How about Mike Tolbert?  Last year he was injured for quite a bit and had 37 attempts for 78 rushing yards.  If he is healthy he can help in the red zone.  I'll be glad to see him back.
panthers,3alsd0,isj1984,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:03:11 2015 UTC,I like the pick man!  People are so worried about his salary that they forget that hes such a versatile/reliable threat in the redzone.  I hope we keep him and Lee Ward in the fold.
panthers,3alsd0,Sharpshooter90,2,Mon Jun 22 16:35:18 2015 UTC,"Sleeper pick: Jerricho Cotchery.   His last year in Pittsburgh he had 10 TDs playing in the slot as the 3rd WR. He is a solid possession receiver, great route runner, and I think he'll thrive now that we're not asking so much from him.  I still expect Philly Brown, Boykin, and maybe Stephen Hill to be in the mix, but I think Cotchery will still prove to be a lethal red zone target playing out of the slot."
panthers,3alsd0,everettdc,6,Sun Jun 21 18:30:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly, hate to say it, but i think Cotchery is done.  He'll be competing with Bersin for the 4th WR spot, behind Benjamin, Funchess, and Brown."
panthers,3alsd0,faultlessjoint,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:57:44 2015 UTC,"I agree Brown will likely win the 3rd WR spot, but he is too small for what we try to do in the redzone offensively. The Steelers did a great job of using Cotchery's route running to make catches in traffic in the end zone.   I'm not sure Cotchery will end up beating out all the other guys for the redzone slot receiver rights, but as our #2 guy last year, it is his job to lose as of now."
panthers,3alsd0,everettdc,2,Sun Jun 21 19:28:57 2015 UTC,"But we have Benjamin, Funchess, Olsen, Tolbert, Stewart, and Newton who are/should be very effective in the redzone.  Not to mention the hope that Brandon Williams becomes a real threat this season."
panthers,3alsd0,faultlessjoint,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"Yea, I agree all those guys will do well in the redzone. But that's all the more reason Cotchery (or whoever our slot receiver ends up being) will be open on some plays.   I'm not expecting a Pro-Bowl season out of Cotch, but I'm hoping he'll contribute more this year. I just can't forget the New England game where he scored 3 TDs 2 years ago. If he can get any of the mojo back now that we have a legit #2, we're gonna be set. If I'm wrong and he doesn't, that's awesome, because that means someone else has stepped up and played well."
panthers,3alsd0,everettdc,2,Sun Jun 21 19:47:56 2015 UTC,The Steelers did a great job of using Cotchery's route running to make catches in traffic in the end zone.   The Steelers have a very different red zone play book than us.

panthers,3ak08f,notleonardodicaprio,5,Sun Jun 21 00:04:40 2015 UTC,no kidding.  I really want to see a side angle to see how high he got.
panthers,3ak08f,andybader,9,Sun Jun 21 01:02:37 2015 UTC,"They weren't kidding when they said it was a textbook play by Cam and Benji, Benwikere just had other things to say about it."
panthers,3ak08f,YotsubaSnake,6,Sun Jun 21 01:44:50 2015 UTC,"Bene made a good play, but Cam didn't really help himself out much. He threw the ball late and behind Benji. The ball should have pretty much been in front of Benji within arms reach just as he's finishing his break.   Instead Benji was waiting for the pass and had to reach behind him to attempt to catch the ball. This put Bene in a better position to step in front of the pass."
panthers,3ak08f,Extric,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:24:28 2015 UTC,Not really only thing cam could have done better was throw it higher but then he would have risked throwing it over Benji. Bene just read that play too fucking well
panthers,3ak08f,G060,5,Sun Jun 21 06:05:34 2015 UTC,Newton shouldn't have thrown that ball tho he had time to see Bene running into position to make that play.
panthers,3ak08f,Parabowl,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:36:17 2015 UTC,Newton for sure saw Bene there but I think he was confident enough that bene wouldn't jump high enough and that his own would be higher. Newton also locks onto one reciever which can hopefully be fixed this off season
panthers,3ak08f,G060,5,Sun Jun 21 07:07:58 2015 UTC,"Throwing it higher doesn't help the fact that the ball is late and behind Kelvin. If the ball is thrown ontime and leading Kelvin to the sideline like it should then Bene's chances of making the play are much smaller.  Just watch Kelvin run his route. As soon as he gains seperation from Peanut he's looking for the ball. It's not there like it should and he's running out of room and slowing down. When the ball finally leaves Cam's hands Kelvin is making a move to reach behind him to catch the ball.   Kelvin should have come out of his break, been able to catch the ball in stride and either make an attempt to move up field (which he may have been able to do if the ball was on time since Peanut was still recovering) or step out of bounds. Instead he has to make adjustments to Cam's bad pass."

panthers,3ak08f,skippapotamus,3,Sun Jun 21 06:50:26 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping this was a designed play for KB and Cam didn't actually miss the open receiver at the top of the field and the check down clear for at least a 3 yard run....  Because honestly I've seen this before on game day, and Bene was in position before the ball was released.  Also KB kinda just gave up.    Judging by that grass tho it was probably like 112 degrees... so why not give up.    It's good Cam has a quality backfield to throw against to teach him these lesson in practice instead of during a game."
panthers,3ak08f,Angry_Apollo,3,Sun Jun 21 15:47:40 2015 UTC,that stunt is kinda sloppy up front.
panthers,3ak08f,net403,4,Mon Jun 22 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"I don't know what bothers me more, that Benjamin immediately gave up on the play after the interception, or the other defender rushed back to block Benjamin for Benewikere. I know it's just practice and without pads, but I'd still like Benjamin to react like it was a pick in a game and put two hands on him. But then the blocking I thought was unnecessary. Somebody tell me I'm crazy and to let the boys play."
panthers,3ak08f,TubaMike,5,Sun Jun 21 04:03:57 2015 UTC,"No I hear you, he was on the ground with the ball and a lot of time passed before much reaction. Let's just say that's why they call it practice."

panthers,3ak08f,Angry_Apollo,6,Sun Jun 21 11:46:27 2015 UTC,"Wait, which is it?  Benji should have gone after him because he should treat it like a game, or the defender shouldn't have blocked him because it's just practice?"

I plan on creating a new world cloud every week during the regular season and adding it to an imgur album, so we can see week-by-week the most discussed topics /r/panthers in 2015. I'll also make a cumulative one at the end of the season that pulls in all the comments from the year.  Once the season starts we have a larger comment sample size for the week, I'll try to do some more in depth analytics such as topic clustering (identify common topics/themes in posts) and sentiment analysis (measure the overall tone of posts, positive or negative).  Let me know if anyone has any ideas or analysis that you'd like to see done on the posts. I'll post the code on github once it gets cleaned up some, but I use PRAW to scrape the comments, and http://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/ to generate the word cloud  Also let me know if you would be interested in seeing this during preseason. Keep Pounding!"

The genus Panthera includes jaguars, who are referred to as panthers in Central and South America.  However, in North and parts of South America, the cougar (or mountain lion, or puma) is also referred to as a panther, despite being from a different genus, Puma."
panthers,3aeycp,JMMSpartan91,2,Fri Jun 19 22:36:17 2015 UTC,I was referring to the logos both teams use. They are the North American cougar ones. Ones native to NC and FL.

Historically, Jaguars ranged throughout the southwestern US, but they are only rarely found in the most southern parts of those states now.  And though there's some ancient artwork found in FL that seems to resemble Jaguars, I don't know that there's any evidence they ever ranged there.  Are you talking about the Florida Panther?   That's a member of the genus Puma too, though.  Am I misunderstanding you?  I don't mean to be argumentative, I'm genuinely interested in what you're referring to."
panthers,3aeycp,JMMSpartan91,3,Fri Jun 19 23:28:58 2015 UTC,"The Florida panther (Puma concolor) and the black panther in NC (largely myth, never confirmed to live there) were likely the same cat. With the darker pigment pattern one being in NC at some point in time. Since the Florida panther is only cat that really makes sense to potential have a black variant and be in the eastern US (excluding someone's escaped exotic pet).   The part I messed up causing the misunderstanding (my bad) was clarifying that the Florida panther is very very commonly misnamed as a jaguar.

I tend to follow certain players and coaches mainly, which make me like a team.  It's how I used to do all my NFL perusing.  But Following the career of Kurt Warner lead me to look into Jake Delhomme and then suddenly he was given a shot on a real NFL team... and I fell in love with the Panthers.  I'd already been following the team a bit because the unis were the best thing I'd ever seen, but Delhomme's play and love for this team really sold me.

panthers,3acfp3,Imbrandnewhere,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:48:18 2015 UTC,"PFF actually had Cam as their top-graded QB (+14.6) those first 5 games. It's crazy how fast things fell apart for Cam, when our garbage O-line got exposed. OCs and QBs can adjust for 1 maybe 2 bad offensive linemen. But, the mid-season 2014 O-line is probably the worst O-line in Panthers history.  Byron Bell/Amini Silatolu/Ryan Kalil/Fernando Velasco/Nate Chandler. Just garbage. Our one good offensive lineman played sub-par, having to overextend himself for LG and RG duties. But, Cam finished the season strong once Andrew Norwell, Trai Turner, and Mike Remmers started."

panthers,3abggh,arnefesto,11,Thu Jun 18 19:12:43 2015 UTC,I'd put my money on Alexander and/or Ealy breaking out this year.
panthers,3abggh,young__sandwich,2,Thu Jun 18 19:26:35 2015 UTC,I think Ealy is another year away. My prediction is by end of season we know that he'll be our legit number two DE.
panthers,3abggh,arcangel092,3,Sat Jun 20 18:22:51 2015 UTC,I am totally fine with this.  Gman did this in NY and it worked out really well.  Would also be pretty cool to give some 4 DE looks with Ealy/Horton on the outside and FA/CJ in the interior.  Would really throw off the offense on clear passing plays.
panthers,3abggh,Sharpshooter90,3,Thu Jun 18 19:43:52 2015 UTC,You know the story with our defense in the recent past has been a strong front seven masking a weak secondary. At this point the secondary is as strong and deep as its been in a LONG time and the team has its first legitimate shutdown corner in Josh Norman since they parted ways with Chris Gamble. Maybe the back seven will end up helping the front four?
panthers,3abggh,TomNJ,3,Thu Jun 18 19:57:22 2015 UTC,"Luckily the rest of our defense is so damn good, a DE-by-committee isn't a bad thing.  Addison excels at the pass rush, so he's a good bet on passing downs.  6.5 sacks in a rotational front is not too shabby.  However, I feel like Kony has the best balance to lock down the full time position.  It took Greg Hardy 3+ years to click.  Ealy should be a fine starter by his third year."
panthers,3abggh,HesThatGuy1986,2,Fri Jun 19 01:55:48 2015 UTC,It's gonna be Ealy or Alexander. Horton and Addison are too one-dimensional.

My favorite thing would probably be ""Keep Pounding"". Keep Pounding is the Panthers' trademark phrase that basically means don't give up.   Before every home game, someone- usually a player- will bang pound the Keep Pounding Drum.  But its origin, that's what's most dear to Panthers fans everywhere. Sam Mills, a Panthers great, was signed by the newly expanded Panthers and started in every game for our first three seasons in the league. After he retired as a player, he started coaching for the team, working his way up to linebacker coach.   In 2003 Mills was diagnosed with intestinal cancer. Before our playoff game against Dallas the following postseason (the one where we went to the Superbowl) he gave an emotional speech which included:""When I found out I had cancer, they're were two things I could do, quit or keep pounding. I'm a fighter. I kept pounding. You're fighters too. Keep pounding!""  He died in April 2005, but his legacy lives on. His jersey became the first, and only as of yet, to be retired by the Panthers organization, there is a statue of him standing in front of Bank of America Stadium and ""Keep Pounding"" is stitched into the inner collar of every Panthers jersey.   Rest in peace, Sam Mills, and keep pounding!"

This is the game that made me first notice the Panthers.   2003 Superbowl. We made it to the big game and played our hearts out.  We were so close.   2012 season opener vs Cardinals.

The first time it happened (under Siefert) there was reason because the roster had been stripped bare. The second time (under Fox) was just so, so, so stupid and avoidable. We did get Cam out of it though so there's a silver lining to every cloud.  Highest point on the field was probably the '03 playoffs because everything that happened was...improbable... to say the least.

panthers,3a8s8w,BananaGooP,5,Thu Jun 18 03:15:36 2015 UTC,"people have been dying to replace Harper but I anticipate he'll still be a big part of things.  At most, I would figure on the 3rd safety - whoever loses from Boston/Coleman - to play more in obvious passing downs.  Harper's ability in space (ex - GB game) has me more concerned than his ball skills or tackling, but Carolina really didn't play him as a box safety as much as they did Mikell in '13 (anyone with PFF want to tell me if I'm wrong?  if so, did that change much with Boston in the lineup?).  I don't think Boston's starting job is safe, for now.  I don't know why, just gut feel, but when Boston was drafted I felt like he was more of a versatile SS.  Maybe it's his aggressiveness, or maybe I got hung up on measurables, but he certainly did a fine job at FS when not covering Luke Willson.   Thanks for the detail and the work put in. Enjoying this."
panthers,3a8s8w,skippapotamus,3,Thu Jun 18 13:32:50 2015 UTC,"Even though they aren't publicly acknowledging such, I feel like the addition of Shaq is going to make our defensive scheming more about shifting a linebacker in to coverage than playing nickel or adding another safety. I feel like having one player that can either play in the box or drop in to coverage is going to do wonders for our scheming."
panthers,3a8s8w,Spiralyst,2,Thu Jun 18 16:38:18 2015 UTC,Agreed if anything I see them pulling a safety in favor of the CBs and LBs on the team.
panthers,3a8s8w,young__sandwich,2,Thu Jun 18 21:24:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think Boston's starting job is safe   I think and hope, you're wrong."
panthers,3a8s8w,skippapotamus,3,Thu Jun 18 14:18:37 2015 UTC,"I hope so too.  He can be very good.     But I don't want him to be handed anything.  None of the late '14 risers should.     I guess, to put it in brief, I think Coleman's pretty good, and while the narrative has been that he'll push Harper, I wouldn't put it outside possibility that Harper and Coleman start, and Boston subs Harper.  Is it simpler that Coleman starts next to Boston?  Sure."
panthers,3a8s8w,young__sandwich,2,Thu Jun 18 14:55:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that no one should be handed the starting job.  But I don't think that's how our management runs things.  But I think half way through the season it'll be Coleman/Boston with Harper substituting and ""advising""."
panthers,3a8s8w,young__sandwich,2,Thu Jun 18 14:59:02 2015 UTC,"100% agree with your assessment on Harper.  He's an easy target for panther fans but he does bring a fair amount to the table.    I also agree that Coleman is most likely Harpers replacement, but I'm not sure how long Coleman hold the job.    Love reading these.  Keep up the great work!"
panthers,3a8s8w,AbsurdSpud,2,Thu Jun 18 13:33:38 2015 UTC,"I agree Coleman probably won't keep the job for more than 2 years, expect them to draft another safety in the coming years and continue to develop Dean Marlowe and Robert Lester as attempts to replace Harper/ Coleman for the long run."
panthers,3a8s8w,Spiralyst,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:22:05 2015 UTC,"I think the issue with Harper is similar to what happened with LaFell, it wasn't that they're bad but when they did mess up it was a huge mistake."
panthers,3a8s8w,Reneau,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:00:26 2015 UTC,That is understandable but when a safety messes up it usually does lead to a big play seeing as the definition of their position is more or less the last line of defense.  The main thing to remember is the fact that he also saved a lot of plays that could have been detrimental.  Safety is a tough position just like OT it requires a lot of different attributes which is why many teams are using more 2 FS sets instead of a FS and a SS.
panthers,3a7qmm,JCoxRocks,16,Wed Jun 17 21:57:18 2015 UTC,"I get why he didn't like the attention the movie brought. For a while there, he was one the most well known offensive lineman in the league, which came with unrealistic expectations.   To me, the more interesting part of this story is the ""standoff/scrape/fight"" that happened with Ealy.   On one hand, I love the passion and intensity that displays. But on the other hand, it's the kind of thing that made the front office willing to part ways with one of the best (if not the best) players in franchise history."
panthers,3a7qmm,everettdc,14,Wed Jun 17 23:12:29 2015 UTC,"This sounds like a heated argument. Steve Smith sent people to the medic.  You have to think, Ealy and Oher are squaring off. It's fucking hot for June. I almost jihaded someone on the road that cut me off earlier because I was a little sweaty. I'm sure tempers flair a lot on the practice field in the summer months.

I don't think he can play the victim card here..He was downgraded because he was bad on the field(be it bad coaching or injuries).  If anything, the movie set expectations for him too high and he was never able to meet them.  Regardless, that is all in the past now.  Hope he is finally able to turn it around..we sure as hell need him to."

panthers,3a6tbp,The_Chrononaut,12,Wed Jun 17 18:01:50 2015 UTC,This isn’t the first time Benjamin has shown up to a camp overweight. He was so overweight when he first arrived to Florida State—reportedly 20 pounds—that Seminoles coaches couldn’t justify putting him on the field and used a redshirt for him.   Yikes. Let's hope this turns out as well as that eventually did.
panthers,3a6tbp,ThisDerpForSale,19,Wed Jun 17 18:43:09 2015 UTC,Sounds like he didn't prepare enough this offseason.  If this does become a chronic issue I'll be pretty upset with him.
panthers,3a6tbp,SpaceIsAPlace,14,Wed Jun 17 18:03:59 2015 UTC,Agreed. I'm officially worried about his durability now and that is NOT something I ever wanted to say. But I'm also so nervous about this season I'm paranoid about everything.  Pray for Benji.
panthers,3a6tbp,Labradiddler,8,Wed Jun 17 18:13:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is the time to be paranoid.  First, check out the Panthers.com write-up.  http://www.panthers.com/news/article-2/Notes-Intensity-reaches-new-level/c37ac854-d917-434f-b7a6-302df4bf26ed  According to the Panthers, this is an injury to his other (right) hamstring, and it's characterized as ""soreness.""  That doesn't seem too alarming.    Further, the extra weight isn't anything to fret about now.  I cannot begin to imagine the stress that players put on their bodies in terms of carrying more or less weight than they might otherwise have given their ""normal"" body type.  Consider post-retirement Jordan Gross and his significant weight loss in a short span of time.  These players are either adding or shedding pounds to be competitive in light of their positional needs, and the fact that KB reported to OTAs 8-9 pounds overweight does not necessarily mean he didn't properly prepare.  In light of the comments regarding his attitude and interaction with the training staff, I think the take-away here is that we have a younger (24 years) player in his 2nd professional season who has experienced a ""learning moment"" and is displaying the proper attitude to improve."
panthers,3a6tbp,SpaceIsAPlace,8,Wed Jun 17 22:48:10 2015 UTC,"Okay this makes me feel a lot better about it. Nothing about Benji has lead me to believe he would be the kind of guy who doesn't properly prepare. I'm suuuuper ignorant of sports medicine type stuff just in general so this has put me at ease.  Can't wait to see the ""Delvin Funjamin"" combo in action!"
panthers,3a6tbp,Spiralyst,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:12:58 2015 UTC,"I doubt he'll be overweight when they start playing with pads on in July. I'm sure that kind of practice does wonders for getting that girlish figure back, lol."
panthers,3a6tbp,skippapotamus,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"hopefully.  And 9 lbs on that frame isn't a ton.  The thing is, with this all being an offhand Rivera comment, was whether he was a bit overweight but in workout shape, or whether he was being a little lazy (i.e., the weight is symptomatic of him not working out, which is also where the soreness/pulls are coming from).   And we can't really know that one way or another.   Hard to say.  Moose, who at the time was kinda king-sized at WR himself as a youngster, dealt with this somewhat too.  And I don't know if there was any conditioning issue there."

panthers,3a6tbp,young__sandwich,10,Wed Jun 17 19:47:51 2015 UTC,I think it's meant as the weight adds more punishment to the hamstrings then they are use to when performing at that athletic level.

panthers,3a5rr4,G060,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:05:42 2015 UTC,I also heard that it was a good play by Bene and not a bad one by Cam. It was a one handed diving interception. Sometimes there's no mitigation for an excellent play
panthers,3a5rr4,AnchorDrops9,3,Thu Jun 18 01:37:19 2015 UTC,Good for him. Bad for Cam.
panthers,3a5rr4,miraclemarc,2,Wed Jun 17 19:31:20 2015 UTC,"I have always had a bit of a problem with the idea, after his great play on the outside, that Bene should be forced back inside.  He has a good set of slot CB skills, but he's good at both.  You don't have to choose anymore - starting WR can play in the slot, starting CB can play there, too.    It's not a bad problem to have that he's showing up well outside either - PFF had him exceptional outside at the end of last year.  He's trending up."

panthers,3a6gqo,illlilllllillli,9,Sat Jun 20 05:40:57 2015 UTC,I think Rivera does this every year as a confidence boost.  It seems like who he picks needs the extra motivation and hasn't panned out the last few years.
panthers,3a6gqo,biggin528,7,Wed Jun 17 16:41:06 2015 UTC,But it hasn't just been Rivera.  Proehl's been saying the same.
panthers,3a6gqo,young__sandwich,7,Wed Jun 17 16:50:27 2015 UTC,"Rivera has been big on him though.  At the draft presser when Gettleman was talking about receivers, Rivera made it a point to interject Hill's name in the conversation.  Gettleman sort of responded with a ""Oh yeah, Hill, etc, etc.""  Rivera is either high on him, or has a personal goal to make the man successful."
panthers,3a6gqo,JCoxRocks,2,Wed Jun 17 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what press conference you mean.  I did find it odd that Gettleman was the one that picked him up, Rivera was the one that kept him on the practice squad, but then it kind of seemed like they switched stances.    I don't think Rivera is going to force Hill into the roster.  I think if he wanted to do that he would have done it last year."

You can glean some things from it observationally, but you can't know that it's a speed out versus a standard 3 route."
panthers,3a4skl,skippapotamus,16,Thu Jun 18 14:25:51 2015 UTC,I have a feeling they're also redditors.
panthers,3a4skl,young__sandwich,9,Wed Jun 17 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"What is the advantage of a rounded out vs a square out? I've seen both, but it just seems like the rounded hurts the ability to get separation."
panthers,3a4skl,TheSwellFellow,9,Wed Jun 17 12:17:12 2015 UTC,"I would guess that it's more consistent for the qb, and it gives variety to the routes, which makes reading them more difficult for the defense. Do a few rounded routes and then suddenly snap back in when the defender is expecting the rounded route."
panthers,3a4skl,Retskcaj19,9,Wed Jun 17 12:43:51 2015 UTC,Also if you have a defender that isn't pressing a rounded out gives you a faster line to the outside than a square out
panthers,3a4skl,ACraftyRooster,3,Wed Jun 17 13:17:48 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, makes sense."
panthers,3a4skl,TheSwellFellow,2,Wed Jun 17 13:11:38 2015 UTC,"feels like, if a corner was playing a more press, inside technique versus a more dropped trail technique or even press outside, that the speed out helps a bit more there - where in trail you want to sell the vertical another step, but in the speed out you might already have position on an inside technique corner.    Granted you could also throw that out there in terms of the coverage - they're normally hand in hand but you can always get a c3 guy who's playing man technique just as you might get a c2 guy trying to sell you man looks (not actually all that uncommon given the way a cover 2 often shifts to man 1)."
panthers,3a4skl,skippapotamus,3,Thu Jun 18 14:30:06 2015 UTC,I would imagine you don't lose as much momentum on a rounded out as opposed to having to completely change direction. So you can get outside a little faster.  It's also a subtle enough difference to possibly throw off a DB expecting a square out- he might think the lack of a sharp break indicates another route and/or try to jump the square out early and end up futzing his coverage a bit. Gotta keep 'em guessing.

panthers,3a7m8v,iamnotbrian,8,Wed Jun 17 22:04:48 2015 UTC,9 pounds over isn't a lot. Also consider he hasn't been working out fully for a while because of his hammy possibly causing weight gain. The real concern is his hammy not how much ham he's eating.
panthers,3a7m8v,Magnuts,3,Wed Jun 17 22:19:13 2015 UTC,I hope you're right. I like him a lot.
panthers,3a7m8v,AbsurdSpud,2,Wed Jun 17 22:34:37 2015 UTC,I felt like he kind of needed to put on some size last year.  As long as he doesn't lose speed (which he probably will cuz of the hamstring) then I don't even care what he weighs.  Perfectly fine with him putting on some size.
panthers,3a7m8v,young__sandwich,2,Wed Jun 17 22:44:47 2015 UTC,"It's a little concerning cause it shows he probably isn't maintaining his conditioning, and considering he admittedly hit a wall last season you'd hope he worked on conditioning so that wouldn't be a problem. Add to this that we traded up to draft a WR that might be a quicker version of him and that couldn't even motivate him to come into camp in shape and there are definite red flags."

Not only does Prisco seem to have a negative opinion of our team, but he absolutely railed us in the draft coverage. I'm happy they linked the video from that. He's almost pissed like the Panthers chose Funchess in the second round just to mess with him personally.  Great write up. It's not like we're tearing down the world's premiere WR roster to fit Funchess in. If Cam is inaccurate, it's usually a ball sailing 5 feet over a receiver's head.   I also firmly believe that Devin Smith was on our board, along with probably 3 of the receivers who went in the first round, and when he was drafted  by the Jets, Gettleman pushed the button on the trade to ensure we got one of our projected receivers."

panthers,3a47w8,NSA_Mailhandler,3,Wed Jun 17 08:01:17 2015 UTC,"My take away from this, aside from being thrilled that the Panthers are getting some recognition, is that the NFC South as a whole seems to have a lot less talent than it had a few seasons ago.  The offensive lines and defensive backfields in particular seem to be a bit weaker than a few years ago.  What that tells me is that even though people are going to continue to have blind faith in the Saints, the Panthers are actually the ones with the most talent and a legit shot a having a nice sustainable divisional title run if we keep building."
panthers,3a47w8,andyroohoo,2,Wed Jun 17 06:47:27 2015 UTC,I tend to agree(biased of coarse).  No one has a really good secondary in the division but with the improvements this year we have a somewhat comparison with Jones and White but they don't have an All-Pro tight end nor a front 7. We are as good or better in every group other than our OL and that is serviceable.   Barring injury we have a team that could make a title run.  Less likely teams have done it.
panthers,3a47w8,NSA_Mailhandler,2,Wed Jun 17 08:07:12 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate to say it, NO could have a pretty nice secondary. We all know Keenan Lewis is a good CB, and adding Browner will give them two solid options at CB. If Byrd is able to recover from his injury and Vacarro starts playing more like his rookie season then they have a really solid group of guys back there. Hopefully their pass rush will be bad enough that it won't matter."

panthers,3a1i6o,scotttr,2,Tue Jun 16 17:13:11 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure they don't keep the actual ball. At least they're not supposed to.
panthers,3a1i6o,vroomery,2,Tue Jun 16 17:50:35 2015 UTC,"I wondered about that - in theory, I think that's true, but do we ever see anyone official take the ball away?  Or swap it for something else?  I have a feeling that they do keep them."
panthers,3a1i6o,ThisDerpForSale,3,Tue Jun 16 23:33:51 2015 UTC,There's no way they don't keep the ball he hands out. There have been kids that got a ball and immediately turned around and ran back to their seats. No way someone is going to go up there and get that ball back.
panthers,3a1i6o,Jupiter_Ginger,2,Wed Jun 17 02:51:24 2015 UTC,That's my assumption.  Though knowing how obnoxiously no-fun the NFL can be. . . I wondered.

panthers,3a1l2u,NFLVideoConverterBot,3,Tue Jun 16 14:59:23 2015 UTC,"I was there. I actually played in the tournament. There were some pretty high profile celebrity team members (we had Luke, Oher, Trai Turner, Josh Norman and Randy Moss on our team).   We lost in the quarter-finals against Ortho Carolina (Cam's team). Lots of arguing and extreme competitiveness from Cam. It was hard to tell if he was hamming it up for the cameras or he just couldn't get beat in his own tournament.   All in all it was a blast. It was great to see so many local celebs turn up for a cause. Would highly recommend for anyone who is a panthers/sports fan."

panthers,39xvhm,ncleon2010,2,Tue Jun 16 15:04:51 2015 UTC,Projection is key in that consideration. Salary cap is expected to jump into the $150 million range next season and possibly $160 million the next year. With current contracts (including Davis) on record Spotrac and OTC are projecting $11.6 to $29.7 million of available space in 2016 and $79 to $92 million of available cap in 2017.   Davis' contract projects extremely well in terms of cap projection.

panthers,39xy1e,ludacris6901,5,Mon Jun 15 18:25:57 2015 UTC,I am just wondering what this will do to our $ situation especially when it comes time to pay Luke?  Can someone explain?
panthers,39xy1e,D1SCG0lf,4,Mon Jun 15 18:40:06 2015 UTC,"We're projected at $26 million over under the cap next year, with Cam, Davis and Olsen extended. Luke probably won't cost anymore than $15 million, so that should leave plenty left even after we're done with him. Bare in mind that the highest paid MLB in the league is worth $13 a year right now."
panthers,39xy1e,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Mon Jun 15 23:41:00 2015 UTC,So what you're saying is Luke is gonna start at 13 million. He should. He's worth it.
panthers,39xy1e,BeerMeBooze,3,Tue Jun 16 00:38:19 2015 UTC,I have no doubt that Luke will be the highest paid MLB once we give him his deal.
panthers,39xy1e,BlindWillieJohnson,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:00:59 2015 UTC,Do you mean $26 million under the cap?  That's the only way that math makes sense to me.
panthers,39xy1e,andybader,3,Tue Jun 16 02:37:41 2015 UTC,"That is what I meant, yeah."
panthers,39xy1e,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Tue Jun 16 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"We got tens of millions of dollars coming off the books over the next couple years (thank you, Hurney), so I'm sure we'll have the necessary space to keep Luke.  Edit: We also go from $13 million in dead money this year to only $2.3 million next year. Barring any big releases this season, we're getting a big chunk of cap space back."

panthers,39y8tr,biggin528,13,Mon Jun 15 20:30:02 2015 UTC,Most of our starters on defense are very young across the board.

panthers,39y8tr,biggin528,2,Tue Jun 16 01:12:25 2015 UTC,Do we normally only go into a season with 4 CBs?  I thought it was 5 or 6?
panthers,39y8tr,SixMileDrive,4,Tue Jun 16 01:42:37 2015 UTC,Sorry if I wasn't clear. Meant for the position on the depth chart. It seems like CB1/2/3 are locked up at Norman/Tillman/Bene. We had five CBs at the end of last season.
panthers,39y8tr,Sharpshooter90,5,Tue Jun 16 01:50:38 2015 UTC,This is a sneaky good pickup...that we didn't even really need.  Houston was a #1 corner in Detroit before his injury.
panthers,39y8tr,Spiralyst,2,Tue Jun 16 02:17:25 2015 UTC,"I was hoping we'd add at least one more depth player in our secondary. Outside of our starters, the talent really drops off. Melvin White was the next-best thing and the fact that he lost hist starting job last year does not bode well."

panthers,39xs3o,AnchorDrops9,4,Mon Jun 15 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"If I had to pick one guy, it would probably be Josh Norman, mainly because he will be 28 this season. He would only have 2-3 more good/elite seasons left after 2015. Having said that, I really think letting go of Greg Hardy allows us to sign all of those guys. Besides the off-field issues, this is why Gettleman never intended on signing Hardy long term.  Plus, there are a few other factors that will help us sign all of our young core guys. First, the salary cap is going to skyrocket in the next few years because of the new TV contracts. It's already at $143M. By the 2017 offseason, it's probably going to be $160M. Second, a huge reason why the Panthers were in salary cap hell was because of dead money, which is just a waste of precious cap space. Last year, the Panthers were #1 in the league with $19M of dead money (Beason, Smith, Gross, and Godfrey contracts mainly). This year, it has come down to $12M. The way Gettleman is managing and structuring contracts, the dead money will come down to $2-3M in the next few years. Third, just as guys like Star/Short and the 2014 draft players will need new contracts, CJ/Thomas Davis/Stewart will be coming off the books. That will create the space to give out a few more big contracts. And lastly, Gettleman is very disciplined about not splurging in free agency just so he can keep our young core players."
panthers,39xs3o,nikman09,2,Mon Jun 15 18:18:52 2015 UTC,And Bene won't have to be signed for a few more years.

panthers,39xs3o,TheWhiteBlur,2,Mon Jun 15 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"They'll be ready for a new deal as soon as CJ's deal runs out, which opens up the books for us to sign them."

panthers,39xs3o,CamNewton69,2,Mon Jun 15 18:22:41 2015 UTC,"I doubt even the front office is considering our DT's closely right now. KK is locked in with us through 2016 and Star can get a fifth year for 2017. A lot can happen between now and then with the draft, performance, etc.   By the time our DT's are ready for their second contracts, J-Stew's heavy money will be off the books, Charles Johnson's mega deal will have closed and TD's new contract will have completed. That's a fuck ton of money. If we retain Johnson or Stewart, their new contracts should be much more reasonable given their age and the fact that they were seriously overpaid. Benjamin's contract won't be an issue until 2018. Olsen's deal also expires in 2018 and there's a chance 3-4 current stalwarts are no longer playing at that point.   I don't think there's anything to be worried about. I can definitely see the Panthers being able to swing contracts for their premiere LB and CB in 2016, especially considering the potential room CJ's contract could make if it's reworked in the last year. The idea is not to not have solid contracts for your premium talent, but to make the numbers work so heavy contracts are falling off on an annual basis. Star and KK are awesome and are most likely going to be forces on our team, but neither one is going to command Suh-level money in a new contract. And even if Norman has an amazing year, he's not going to get a Revis-type deal for what he's put together on his resume to this juncture."
panthers,39xs3o,Spiralyst,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"We can keep em all, Bene has some time, Norman could struggle and play himself out of a deal(I wouldn't be surprised if we're dealing with him now). Star and KK are interesting, cause neither has been dominant, they have both been mentioned as helping the other, so we could get both at good deals, overpay one, or lose one. It might be win-win in 2 years."

He reads coverages and helps direct the entire defense, as well as motivating his fellow players.  Luke is so much more than a highlight reel or a Stat list.  He's like having another amazing coach on the field.  Plus linebacker is a far more demanding and complex position than defensive end.  I take Luke.  All day."

It's also comparing defensive ends...  Any good math nerd would understand the importance of relevant data.  And unfortunately I doubt there is any that we can use.  Because they play diff positions.  It's worth noting 25 percent of his games every year are jaguars and titans.  Basically free stats last year.  The entire second article is about him vs titans.    He's the best defensive end probably in the league and he's a monster, but Luke's skill set is still more vast and impressive in my opinion."
panthers,39sqf9,Magnuts,5,Sun Jun 14 16:07:36 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting 25 percent of his games every year are jaguars and titans.   And we play the Bucs and Falcons every year - who have two of the worst offensive lines in the NFL. J.J. Watt is not probably the best DE, he is hands down the best Defensive Linemen in the NFL. And most people would agree, the best defensive player in the NFL (by a wide margin).  You can disagree, but look at what Watt has done compared to other defensive linemen, then look at what Luke has done compared to other LB's. Luke is the best LB, but this past season was instrumental in making that statement basically the next best thing to a fact. In other words, throughout his first 2 seasons, other LB's were close if not better than him (the latter point I wouldn't have argued, but I'm biased).  Bowman, David, Miller, Wagner, Houston... these guys aren't far behind at all. And when Luke won the DPOY award, there was some serious debate if he was the best or even second best LB that year (let alone defensive player). With his improved pass coverage, I think it's finally easy to say he is the best LB, but Watt has been hands down the best at his position for even longer.   I'm not sure what is the more valuable position. But when people usually talk about building your defense around someone, they usually mention the DE position first, since being able to rush the passer is probably the most important thing a defense can do. Look what happened to our defense when we couldn't get a pass rush going early on last season - Luke and TD weren't enough to make up for that.  Also it's worth noting, that Watt scored multiple times."
panthers,39sqf9,EnglandsOwn,3,Sun Jun 14 23:02:21 2015 UTC,"Solid argument.    I do feel like in the past two years, Luke has gotten better and Watt has been slightly less effective.  2011 Watt and 2012 Watt was insane.  Like 16 blocked passes?  Yea that was possibly the greatest back to back defensive seasons of all time.   BUT I think Watt's game relies on him being bigger, stronger and faster than everyone.  Not smarter.  Therefore, over time offenses learn to stack against him and get done what they need to.    But you can't stack against Luke.  You don't know what he's going to do.  It's his diversity in coverage, pass rushing, run blocking and leadership that sets him apart in my eyes.  And to me that is why you would build around a super star LB (or LB duo in our case) and not a DE.  Think of it this way:  When was the last time you saw a defensive end yelling at his team mates before the snap, directing the motion and play.  It's probably pretty rare.  But if you watch Luke before the snap, he's yelling, he's pointing.  He's lifting his team up around him.  That's just not something you'd have the ability to do from the line."
panthers,39sqf9,Magnuts,6,Sun Jun 14 23:18:30 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really seem like teams have learned to neutralize Watt like you think they have/will. Last year was nearly the same as 2012 in terms of how ridiculous he was (maybe more ridiculous considering he had multiple offensive touchdowns also.)   Also, being forced to stack against Watt isn't an argument that is in your favor. That means that they are taking blockers away from other players. If you have to change your game plan to counteract a player, he is still being incredibly effective even if it doesn't show up on the stat sheet."
panthers,39sqf9,enfyte416,3,Mon Jun 15 00:00:16 2015 UTC,"Watt had 20.5 sacks last year, one interception (returned 80 yds for a TD) and four forced fumbles. Add in 16 passes defended. It was probably his best year, but you could make an argument for 2012. He hasn't dropped off though."
panthers,39sqf9,SixMileDrive,3,Tue Jun 16 01:40:18 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you're looking for. Watt excels at pass rushing and run stopping. Luke is just a tackling machine. Luke is rarely assigned to rush the QB, so it's hard to compare and contrast them on that level."
panthers,39sqf9,Spiralyst,5,Sun Jun 14 15:39:54 2015 UTC,"Watt impacts the game defensively in a way that few players ever have or ever will. I love Luke, but the fact that /u/SixMileDrive is being downvoted for having an honest, non homer opinion on the subject is miserable.   Fine, you can't compare Luke and Watt because they play different positions. You can compare what Watt is doing compared to other 3-4 DE's, then compare what Luke is doing compared to other ILB's and see what that means for both of them.   Watt has put up two historically good seasons within his first 4 years in the league. Luke has been great and has a DPOY award and ROTY award to his name but I would not categorize any season he has played in as historically good. Definitely elite, but not nearly at the level of what Watt accomplished last year and in 2012.   Luke is a great leader, and a great player, but anyone who thinks he is better than Watt needs to take off their homer glasses and take a real, subjective look at this."
panthers,39sqf9,enfyte416,0,Sun Jun 14 15:55:17 2015 UTC,"You said it perfectly and undercut your entire argument. They play different positions. It's like trying to compare a RB and a WR. Sure, the WR is going to have more plays that result in large gains. But a RB isn't any less valuable because the parameters of their position have them playing out of the backfield.  You keep harping on Watt impacting the game defensively in a way that few players ever have or will and then completely disregard the fact that Luke...not Watt...has won both the DROTY and DPOY in his first two seasons. If Watt was what you say he is, then why were those awards handed off to Luke, I wonder?  Like I mentioned before, if you're talking about QB pressure and what Watt does on the line, you are correct. He's more impactful. But Luke doesn't play on the line. His position as MIKE doesn't have him pressuring the QB more than once or twice in a game.   If we're going to bring this contest into the land of tackling...which is what linebackers are there for, then the stats don't even come close. in 2014 Luke was 2nd in the league with 107 solo tackles. Watt came in at #80 with 59 tackles."
panthers,39sqf9,Spiralyst,5,Sun Jun 14 16:08:43 2015 UTC,"Luke...not Watt...has won both the DROTY and DPOY in his first two seasons. If Watt was what you say he is, then why were those awards handed off to Luke, I wonder?   I'm not sure if you just forgot or actually don't know, but Watt has now won DPOY twice. I think he will take 2x DPOY over what Luke has won, and anyone in their right mind would also.    in 2014 Luke was 2nd in the league with 107 solo tackles. Watt came in at #80 with 59 tackles.   in 2010 Chad Greenway had 109 solo tackles, yet he has never been considered an elite player in his entire career. In 2007 Barry Church had 107 solo tackles as a safety. There is a reason why people don't use the tackle statistic in arguments like this. Racking up a lot of tackles =/= being an elite player. Luke is elite for a lot reasons, but comparing Luke's tackle numbers to Watt's is just not a smart argument."
panthers,39sqf9,enfyte416,-3,Sun Jun 14 16:16:20 2015 UTC,"What is your argument exactly? What amazing stats are you talking about? You keep talking about Watt like he's raking in 10 INTs, 100+ solo tackles and 20 sacks a year. Or something completely out of the ordinary. What, exactly, has Watt done outside of his line stats that are supposed to be unheard of or unique? Is he elite? Absolutely. They both are. Really the comparison can't go any farther than just recognizing that both are exceptional talents at their positions. The only way to make the debate go further is to have one of them move positions so we can line them up and see how they perform doing the same job detail on defense.   The argument with the tackles was to reinforce how dumb it is to compare/contrast two different positions. Of course Luke's tackling numbers are going to be much higher. It's part of the profile of his position. If you're going to talk about an argument being smart or dumb, at least try to keep it in context...specifically in this instance in how comparing their stats doesn't work because their job profiles are different. It's essentially countering your argument that Watt has done something exceptional and then comparing his stats with Luke's. Watt's pressures and sacks are always going to be better than Luke's because that's the nature of their disparate positions. So for you to say ""Watt's done this and Luke hasn't"" doesn't make any sense."
panthers,39sqf9,Spiralyst,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:49:48 2015 UTC,"Re-read my very first comment in this chain. Not once do I mention ""sacks,"" ""tackles,"" or any other stat. You are literally the person who brought that up and you are trying to say that I am out of context.  Firstly, regardless of comparing positions, bringing up tackles makes no sense because so many mediocre players can get a lot of tackles. Getting a lot of tackles is not a means of being good. I wasn't pointing out that comparing stats between two positions doesn't make sense, I was pointing out that using tackles as a counting stat to prove anything makes no sense. Know the difference.   Secondly, I told you Watt has put up two historically good seasons for his position. Never once did I compare his stats to Luke. My point is that Watt has put up two seasons that are among the best we've ever seen. Luke, while amazing, has put up exactly 0 seasons of that caliber.  Just because you can't compare their numbers stat for stat due to different positions doesn't mean you can't rationalize those numbers based on what you expect at each of their positions. Watt has put up two historically good seasons for a defensive end. I would say that Luke has not had any season that would be considered ""historically good."""

Fact is is that I'm still a huge panthers fan (PSL owner and given away tickets on this sub) but I would still take JJ over Luke in a heartbeat if I could.  Once in a generation DE'e are harder to come by than great LB's"
panthers,39sqf9,Mypantherssuck,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:03:50 2015 UTC,"That's awesome with the tickets thing.  I love it when I see PSL owners selling/giving away tickets on our sub.  You were probably pissed because we were already eliminated from playoff contention before we started winning.  Made all those wins at the end of the season seem pointless.  I remember wanting Ron to be fired that year and I felt like Cam couldn't handle the pressure of the NFL because we had lost so many games by such a small margin. (7 games by 1 touchdown or less)  I'm glad now we stuck with em tho.  But literally every thing you say ever on reddit contains the words ""panthers suck.""  You can't expect no one to ever call you out on it.  I'm not saying you suck or that you're a shitty fan.  I'm saying your name sucks.    Back to the topic at hand tho.  I guess I can see where you're coming from maybe.  The time of Peppers was good for us, and that was a big part of why we reached the super bowl.  But the money the ""once in a generation"" players require is crazy.  Which is why we lost Pepp.."
panthers,39sqf9,Magnuts,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"I agree about the contract thing, the money it takes to keep those DE's is ridiculous...but I guess if you compare it to QB money (which im not saying DE is as important just trying to find something to compare it too), it makes it at least feasible.  Either way, I'm more than happy to have Luke (although when we drafted him I really wanted the DT from Memphis? Dontario Poe I think? Didn't rvent know who Luke was).  In my defense, the year we drafted Cam I really wanted Gabbert, so yeah...my draft skills shouldn't ever be taken seriously"
panthers,39sqf9,Mypantherssuck,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"So I got a technical football question to you guys: How is Justin Houston getting so many sacks as a LB? sure he's OLB and Luke is an ILB/MLB, but their roles are very different. Is that the whole 3-4 vs 4-3 thing? I just always assumed it's DEs that get all the sacks, maybe some monster DTs.  Can someone elaborate on the different ways those guys are used?"
panthers,39sqf9,Tehtime,7,Sun Jun 14 14:21:15 2015 UTC,"OLBs in a 3-4 system rush very often; I don't have any statistics on it, but I'd say they rush on around 90% of downs (help?). 3-4 defensive lines typically have bigger bodies on the line: a huge nose tackle (e.g., Vince Wilfork), and two ends that are similar in build and skillset to 4-3 DTs.   Therefore, the OLBs in a 3-4 system assume the rushing role of the ends in a 4-3 system, but they have less responsibility against the run, and are typically a bit smaller and faster than 4-3 DEs. Unlike 4-3 DEs, who use a 3-point stance with their hand in the ground directly opposite the offensive tackle, they typically stand standing up further out from the OT, and can build up more speed and momentum before contact.   Justin Houston is a good example of this, who at around 260 lbs would be considered undersized for a 4-3 DE, but has a prototypical 3-4 OLB build. Because of their speed, 3-4 OLBs are also used in coverage more often than 4-3 DEs."
panthers,39sqf9,Jorgenfar,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:44:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the only debate vs Luke being second could be Kam Chancellor. That fucker is all over the field and makes huge plays. I still think Luke would take it over him, but I feel like Kam has the same kind of presence on the field (maybe not strategically though.)"

panthers,39nsg2,irspangler,2,Sat Jun 13 12:21:11 2015 UTC,"Other than a twisted ankle (which, yeah, I agree, let's not go there), I don't think the risk to their legs is as bad as it looks. They have shoulder straps on top preventing their heads from pushing through and hurting themselves on the top end of the bubble. They also have handles, which I suspect make it easier to pull your legs/knees in, so that you just kind of roll when you fall, as the lower edge of the bubble is right above the knee.   With your total body weight distributed over something as soft and flexible (not to mention round) as an inflated bubble, anytime you fell, it would take a truly unusual and catastrophic circumstance to mess up your knee - and that's discounting the handles that allow you to pull your knees up into the bubble.  But if there's anyone who can find a way to injure themselves doing it, it's probably professional .001% alpha-male athletes. So there is that...  edit: a word"

Also, TB has not really been a powerhouse at any point in my adult life (I was 12 during their SB win in '02) so they've never felt like much of a threat.  Also, I remember having a sense of empathy when Katrina destroyed New Orleans and the team made national headlines for what they did to help rebuild the city and aid the people of the community.    Don't get me wrong, I still hate the Saints and the Bucs, but I loathe the Falcons to my core 'till the day I die.  Most Panthers fans seem to hate the Saints the most, from whom I've talked to.  edit:  Outside of the division it's the Steelers and Patriots.  In order of Hatred it's probably ATL>NO>NE>TB>PIT."

I was extorted out of $20 in another establishment. The streets' gutters had trash just overflowing out of it. And the entire place smelled like rotten fish.  For whatever reason I suppose this has led to a stronger hate of the Saints than the other teams in the division. It's a tough call, though, since it always seems to be the Falcons that trip us up the most.   I think the only team in our division that's beating us in head-to-head match-ups is the Falcons.

panthers,39kwxo,jokimoose,7,Fri Jun 12 13:16:00 2015 UTC,"Damn, Kony Ealy has a lot of improvement to make."
panthers,39kwxo,rabishop,3,Fri Jun 12 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's curious.  I'm surprised PFF has him graded ""poor.""  I would have expected ""below average"" at worst."
panthers,39kwxo,ThisDerpForSale,2,Fri Jun 12 18:25:56 2015 UTC,He did really poorly the first 11 weeks of the season.  After our bye week he started to step his game up.  Still ended the season as the 4th-worst 4-3DE in the league (with a certain amount of snaps).  But he is trending up and will hopefully only improve after a rough start.
panthers,39kwxo,biggin528,2,Fri Jun 12 18:31:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that, but it just seems a bit drastic - he didn't play that much.  And he was trending upwards.  Stood out as odd to me.  Again, I'm not saying I'd have given him a good grade, but not bottom of the barrel either."
panthers,39kwxo,ThisDerpForSale,2,Fri Jun 12 18:35:01 2015 UTC,"THIS is his performance in weeks 13 through the divisional game.  He did much better late in the season (57 overall the first 11 weeks, 29 overall after week 12 bye).  Still has a lot of work to do but I'm confident he will figure it out this season.  Side note: Notice who the #1 43DE was late in the season? :D"
panthers,39kwxo,biggin528,2,Fri Jun 12 18:45:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's more where I'd have expected him.  He was at least as good as Addison.   If Ealy can keep that pace up, and CJ stays at his level of production, things should be looking up!"
panthers,39kwxo,ThisDerpForSale,2,Fri Jun 12 19:10:32 2015 UTC,Let's not act like Greg hardy was a superstar until about his 4th year. He was actually pretty mediocre until then.
panthers,39kwxo,alyateemwd,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:55:41 2015 UTC,Eh. I wouldn't say mediocre. They played him such a high percentage of snaps I think it really sapped some of his ability as a pass rusher. He was always a stud against the run however.

panthers,39kwxo,ThisDerpForSale,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:35:39 2015 UTC,Interesting.  They must use some unusual (or obscure) metrics to rank WRs.
panthers,39kwxo,biggin528,2,Fri Jun 12 18:39:28 2015 UTC,"http://www.profootballfocus.com/about/grading/  They don't really mention how they reach each point value, but it was no secret that KB had poor hands and sub-par route running.  I still think he played better than they ranked him but the site is unbiased and doesn't take into account the ""eye test"", haha."
panthers,39kwxo,ThisDerpForSale,3,Fri Jun 12 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"It may be less subjective, but I don't think it's fair to say it's unbiased.  Any metric is going to have bias sneak in.    But in any case, no one who watched KB last year would disagree with the point that he had some inexplicable drops and made route running mistakes.  But he also had some outstandingly difficult catches, and ran the basic routes well.  Pretty much what you'd expect out of a top rookie.  I suspect that this may be the OBJr effect at work, in part.  He skewed everything for the other rookies."
panthers,39kwxo,biggin528,2,Fri Jun 12 19:12:41 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree.  Damn OBJ making KB's top-10 rookie WR season seem invaluable.

panthers,39l0i0,Pats_01,3,Fri Jun 12 13:46:49 2015 UTC,"People Knocking on Cam's potential to be a good passer are blind.   A big knock against him has been completion percentage. Well Let's look at Andrew Luck's Best year in regards to that: 61.7%   What about Cam's? 61.7%   Luck throws the ball about 150 times more than Cam because that's their style of play.   Take into account that a great deal of those incomplete passes come from Cam scrambling because of the worst line in football (for a stretch)  and trying to make something happen out of nothing (which he can somehow do at times).   Cam can most definitely become an Elite passer. He has all the tools to do so. He has the ability to be a top 5 and possibly MVP QB in this league. The dude has hall of fame potential. Favre didn't turn into Favre until the mid 90s. This is Cam's fifth year, he seems to have an easy schedule, he just signed a big deal, he's healthy. Lets see how he responds."

Not enough mental/precision/consistency etc...Is that the same take Panthers fans have? Although I will say he did beat our ass on MNF in 2013..."
panthers,39l0i0,net403,7,Fri Jun 12 13:48:45 2015 UTC,"That's definitely the feel around town, but he did have a lot of obstacles.  He was just in an interview yesterday and discussed the criticisms on mechanics, and pointed out a lot of it is not so much a mechanics problem but him being affected in his throw.  Not trusting the pocket,  not trusting his talent around him to do what they do and feeling pressure to be the play-maker himself, resulting in over throws and dangerous runs where he gets hit. He seemed to feel more confident this season in having time to let plays develop and sharing some of the burden with his teammates to make plays. All of that stuff reflected poorly on him, but I feel he may have his best season of his career this year with the upgrades, and being healthier, something he also attributed the struggles to.  He's actively saying and trying to show people that he is a new kind of QB monster that people don't recognize, and that he can be a great rushing strong QB that plays like a tail back"
panthers,39l0i0,nikman09,-9,Fri Jun 12 14:46:38 2015 UTC,"I think they should use him as a rushing QB. Let's face it, with his style of play he's gonna get hit often. Just live with it, that's who he is. Don't try to make him your QB for the next 12 years. Hope he's your guy for 6. Almost treat him like an RB, because when he has that run/pass threat he's at his best. Hard to imagine he'll ever be anything near a true pocket QB. If he does start to play like that, he won't come near the premiere pocket passers. Those are skills that take a long time to develop, and most great pocket QB's have them when they get to the NFL."
panthers,39l0i0,net403,6,Fri Jun 12 15:05:34 2015 UTC,"I think you're underestimating Cam's passing talent. With a dynamic QB like Cam, there's a balance that can be achieved. We're building the offense around Cam to maximize his strengths and minimize his weaknesses.   Greg Cosell did a really nice piece about how the Panthers are playing to Cam's strengths."
panthers,39l0i0,unoffensivename,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:50:05 2015 UTC,"I agree and he also agrees, except for the 6 year part, according to his statements, that's his game.  They're gonna mix it up too, I'm sure, the upgraded WRs and Olsen will help the run.  They asked him directly, how do you respond to people saying you can't withstand the punishment of that style of play in the NFL, being a rushing QB.  He said, ""Trinidad James said it best, don't believe me just watch."" I'm skeptical how long he can play that way also but I gotta give him the benefit of the doubt to go out and prove it to us, he's grown a lot and is a lot more confident than 4 years ago and he could surprise a lot of people. I feel he's going to get smarter about how to protect himself and avoid risky plays better, sooner than later."
panthers,39l0i0,nikman09,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:15:33 2015 UTC,"As a fan of football, it would be cool to see a brutal physical running QB who didn't get hurt and played for 15 years. Unfortunately all it takes is one serious injury. Also, nagging injuries, especially to the legs or ribs, will affect a running QB more than a pocket passing QB."
panthers,39l0i0,net403,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"thats the problem, running QBs life expectancy aren't very long. They also tend to start deteriorating on the passing fundamentals and when they get older and need to be more Peyton Manning-esque, they don't know how."
panthers,39l0i0,unoffensivename,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:48:58 2015 UTC,"Is Andrew Luck a brutal physical running QB as well? Because he can be when he wants to.  Here are the actual stats. Last year, Cam ran the ball 103 times in 14 games, averaging 7.3 rushes/game. Andrew Luck ran the ball 64 times in 16 games, averaging 4 rushes/game.  3 extra rushes/game isn't that big of a deal. As Cam gains more pocket passing experience and our pass protection improves, I could see Cam's rushing coming down to 5 rushes/game, which is definitely sustainable for the long term."
panthers,39l0i0,nikman09,1 point,Fri Jun 12 16:07:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I don't see him staying healthy for 15 years predominately running, and I don't see him getting a whole lot better with pocket footwork.  He did come out and say he hopes to be able to increase his completion percentage to above 65%, that may be a pipe dream.  I'm just holding out hope he finds a good combination of improvement in his weak areas and utilization of his strengths to make him relevant longer than 6 more years, which may also be a pipe dream.  He is built much tougher and larger than the rushing QBs that have come before him, Steve Young, McNair, Vick, he has a few inches and 30 lbs on most of those guys, that may work in his favor.  The NFL hasn't seen a player quite like him before, so I won't totally count him out. The odds are definitely in favor of what you're saying though"
panthers,39l0i0,Parabowl,3,Fri Jun 12 17:52:28 2015 UTC,"I think its consistency. Last year we had a lot of issues with and around Cam. His injuries/surgery, no LT for him, we released literally all our receivers that offseason...I would say this year he should have no excuses as we really upgraded our receivers and special teams and (slightly) upgraded our LT. His surgery is over and has a full off season to prepare and a returning #1 WR in Benjamin. If he doesn't show visible improvement and results this coming season, I would have to say I can't expect much more out of him after that..."

panthers,39g094,Aurion7,6,Thu Jun 11 19:29:15 2015 UTC,"To be fair, ""attitude issues"" doesn't mean poor work ethic or anything like that. I think we'd all agree that Steve Smith had some ""attitude issues"" with punching players in practice (e.g. breaking Ken Lucas's nose) but was an incredibly hard worker. That said, this is nice news to see him putting in the work to get to OTAs early."
panthers,39g094,ThePensAreMightier,3,Thu Jun 11 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"Although I don't condone Smitty punching his teammates, I loved his ""attitude"" on the field."

panthers,39g094,Jupiter_Ginger,2,Fri Jun 12 00:13:36 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. I loved it too. But in practice he got heated sometimes.

panthers,39hpd7,stew_pac,8,Thu Jun 11 20:03:49 2015 UTC,Any chance we could pick him up?   We did draft him 10 years ago (not that it matters).
panthers,39hpd7,young__sandwich,17,Thu Jun 11 20:04:25 2015 UTC,"This is just some dumb guy on the internets opinion, but I'd say low.  Contract dispute seems to be the reason behind the eagles releasing him, so he's probably looking for big money."
panthers,39hpd7,ThisDerpForSale,8,Thu Jun 11 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd love for us to be able to sign Mathis - he's the prototypical one-that-got-away.  But he probably will command a lot of money, more than we can afford."
panthers,39hpd7,BlindWillieJohnson,10,Thu Jun 11 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but he's a guard. Turner and Norwell played too well to justify dropping big bucks on a free agent guard."
panthers,39hpd7,uniquecannon,4,Thu Jun 11 22:13:02 2015 UTC,"Those 2 plus Daryl Williams, who has potential to battle for a spot."
panthers,39hpd7,BlindWillieJohnson,3,Thu Jun 11 23:33:30 2015 UTC,"I dunno about Williams. I think he can take over RT eventually, but not right out the gate. And given how well Norwell and Turner transitioned to the pro level, I don't think either will be giving up their jobs to a rookie."
panthers,39hpd7,biggin528,5,Thu Jun 11 23:45:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah his trade market was apparently non-existent and he wants more money.  He is one of the best guards in the league but may have set his price too high.  Either way, I don't think he ends up here after that big contract with Cam.  We have our own guys to worry about right now."
panthers,39hpd7,plegronease,3,Thu Jun 11 21:05:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Considering the money we have to drop in the up coming years on our own guys, there's not much room to spend big money on free agents."
panthers,39hpd7,faultlessjoint,3,Thu Jun 11 23:05:34 2015 UTC,Only way I see it working is if he can play tackle.  Norwell and Turner finished the season very strong.  It would be a waste of money at guard.  His price tag could only be justified for a tackle.
panthers,39hpd7,Aurion7,6,Fri Jun 12 00:08:16 2015 UTC,"shrug  We were his first team, but I reckon Norwell and Turner are both A) good enough, and B) A lot more affordable. Think B is the most important."

His trade market was nonexistent because teams knew the Eagles planned to cut him if they couldn't find a trade. A team will surely come calling that will offer him more than what the Eagles were paying him now that he's on the open market.

Everyone is talking him up like hes going to be #2 or #3 or something but i dont think hes even going to be #6. I'd take boykin and brown before him.
panthers,39gg3x,donfrenchiano,11,Thu Jun 11 16:24:11 2015 UTC,"Why so negative? Hes still a panther, hes fighting just as hard as anyone else to make the team. Hes a physical phenom so thats why all the attention, especially cause coaches seem to be quick to call him out on improvement. Even if hes a bust its not like hes hurt us yet - hes dropped less catches than KB for the panthers :P  Sit back, watch, speculate, hope. But dont be negative on a guy who's trying to make it in a very selective league.   Or you know, be negative. You do you.   Edit: i love corey brown btw and i really liked the boykin signing. Im freaking ecstatic at all the competition we've got. I love Gettleman. That said, offseason is optimism season for me cause as soon as that first loss inevitably comes, im mr. ""Guess theres always next season"""
panthers,39gg3x,btbessaay,-1,Thu Jun 11 17:06:26 2015 UTC,"Because if he was as good as people think he would have been on someones roster the last few years. He couldn't even beat out bersin last year. I think with all the acquisitions we got in the offseason there isn't going to be room for him. KB, Funchess, Ginn, Cotchery, Brown, Boykin I think will all make the team."
panthers,39gg3x,donfrenchiano,5,Thu Jun 11 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"He was signed 5 days before Week 1. Bersin had him completely beat in terms of chemistry and playbook knowledge, Hill knew literally none of our plays 5 days before we started playing. Bersin had been with our organization for 2 full years already.  Also he was on the Jets 2012 and 2013 (played 12 games that year), he was on our practice squad all last year (2014), so not sure where you're coming up with this ""last few years"" BS.   I am in no way saying Hill will ever even play a down for us, but don't make up bullshit to support your ideas."
panthers,39gg3x,BOATSANDHOEZ,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:44:06 2015 UTC,"He's young and improving, just because he wasn't better than someone like Bersin last year doesn't mean he won't be this year or further down the line. Players improve, some faster than others, and we have nothing else to go off of other than the media and coaches so far and they all say he's improved a ton. That doesn't mean it will translate to actual in game performance but it's a good start."
panthers,39gg3x,datboijustin,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"Ill agree with your last statement about room on our roster due to the guys we picked up, but this guy is still a second round draft pick. People dont wanna screw with receivers that cant catch (oxymoron right). If he turns it around, he could be a really big threat.   And come on, honestly, you think bersin deserved that roster spot? So ya he caught a few passes... I could catch a few passes if you need me to. The guy is not built for the nfl, theres more behind the scenes than we saw with all that business.

panthers,39gg3x,biggin528,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:15:46 2015 UTC,"I wonder if we keep 7 receivers on the 53 man roster... Benjamin, Funchess, Cotchery, Ginn, Hill, and Brown makes 6. That leaves either Boykin or Bersin to fill that seventh spot or fill a practice squad spot."
panthers,39gg3x,chrisefaw,6,Thu Jun 11 16:28:08 2015 UTC,I think Bersin has to have a really good camp and preseason to make the roster. I don't see him making the cut.
panthers,39gg3x,tathata,4,Thu Jun 11 16:50:06 2015 UTC,"His parents are Jerry Richardson's neighbors, so unfortunately it's a little more complicated than just on-field performance."

I think Cotchery and Boykin likely will be the other 2 unless Hill has really stepped up his game.  I highly doubt Bersin makes the team again."
panthers,39gg3x,LittleDinghy,3,Thu Jun 11 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"I agree. There is no way Bersin makes the team, especially when other positions have borderline players that have more upside (Brandon Williams, that new TE we signed, Joe Webb, etc)."
panthers,39gg3x,Reneau,2,Thu Jun 11 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"I think we keep Joe Webb, which ends up making us stay with 6 receivers, since in all reality he is a 7th."
panthers,39gg3x,ThisDerpForSale,2,Thu Jun 11 17:38:33 2015 UTC,"I'm really skeptical that we keep Webb.  We traditionally only keep two QBs.  We kept Webb last season mostly because of Cam's offseason injuries, and particularly because the injury keeping him out of week 1."
panthers,39gg3x,drich7,2,Thu Jun 11 21:16:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% positive, but i don't think they would be eligible for the practice squad"
panthers,39gg3x,biggin528,4,Thu Jun 11 22:25:32 2015 UTC,Nice job!  The only thing I'm questioning is if CJ will be a starter at RDE this year instead of LDE like normal.  I can see it happening but Rivera has been denying that it will.  Edit: I also think Trusnik easily gets the nod over Mayo in terms of 2nd string ILB.
panthers,39gg3x,The_sad_zebra,3,Thu Jun 11 15:43:44 2015 UTC,I think they've been practicing with CJ at right DE.
panthers,39gg3x,biggin528,3,Thu Jun 11 16:01:03 2015 UTC,"They have been.  That's what I was referencing in regards to Rivera stating it was not a permanent move, just part of the rotation to get him some practice there if needed."
panthers,39gg3x,biggin528,2,Thu Jun 11 16:13:13 2015 UTC,You are correct.. The Defensive Line is fixed here.  The Depth Chart itself was pulled from espn.com. The Panthers website does not have the official depth chart uploaded yet. I will be keeping an updated version in excel and upload the verified formation closer to the season.
panthers,39gg3x,FNScar,2,Thu Jun 11 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"Ah ok gotcha!  I like it regardless, haha!"
panthers,39gg3x,biggin528,6,Thu Jun 11 16:13:30 2015 UTC,Do we think that Ealy will start over Frank Alexander? I thought that what I had been reading said that he was becoming a 4 down DE.
panthers,39gg3x,FNScar,2,Thu Jun 11 16:25:42 2015 UTC,"This is one of the hardest pieces to predict for next year, IMO.  Alexander is sort of unknown at this point since he missed all of last year and Ealy has now had a chance to learn the system and adapt to the NFL so it's hard to say who will end up where.  My money is on Ealy to start the season."
panthers,39gg3x,TomNJ,2,Thu Jun 11 22:35:20 2015 UTC,Edit: 3 down
panthers,39gg3x,jsz,4,Thu Jun 11 16:26:03 2015 UTC,The whole lineup looks great. I'm just so worried about LT. I hope Michael Oher can regain his form.

panthers,39gg3x,Daheixiong,3,Thu Jun 11 21:47:32 2015 UTC,"If we are lining up a WR outside, will likely have to be Funch starting.  Brown and Ginn are definitely slot guys, and Cotchery can play outside but isn't likely going to start over Funch.  Cotchery is more of a 3rd-down possession WR."
panthers,39gg3x,LoganMooreNCSU,2,Sat Jun 13 13:30:26 2015 UTC,Probably unless he has a really bad camp/preseason.
panthers,39gg3x,endernyc,1 point,Thu Jun 11 22:18:02 2015 UTC,"Since he knows all three positions and is impressing already, he looks like he will be. I would take a pretty bad training camp for him to drop out of top 2"

panthers,39hbl5,ThisDerpForSale,3,Thu Jun 11 19:43:47 2015 UTC,I saw you changed Cam's grade and was like :O Well done as always.  Its funny there is no change in personnel for the position but there is a huge difference between last year and this upcoming year simply due to the health of a player and changes in other positions.
panthers,39hbl5,ThisDerpForSale,3,Thu Jun 11 21:04:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's why I changed it.  Most of the time the players grow at their own pace from year to year and I can't pretend to know who will perform better or worse.  But so many factors will play into Cam's ability to perform this year that I had to put him slightly higher, haha."

It's funny. Cam's infamous word-salad has really gotten a lot better lately. 100 million dollars has to add a little confidence to the public speaking, right? Good for him. I love to hear that his goal for the season is 65-70 completion percentage.  For anyone that heard the interview live, what did he say about his relationship with Smitty?"

That sucks it is truncated maybe we can dig up a complete copy somewhere.  Cam being so candid about the completion % was nice to hear, he's basically like I know, and I know you know, so we all know that's a problem and I'm on it lol"

Hell I've been to games in carolina where the steelers were playing in another town against another team and seen multiple fuckers wandering around in steelers jerseys.
panthers,39cqh9,arktic_P,3,Fri Jun 12 03:31:56 2015 UTC,"Fucking Steelers bandwagon fans all over North Carolina and South Carolina. Until very recently, there were actually more Steelers ""fans"" in NC than Panthers fans. I put fans in quotation marks because a bunch suddenly disappeared after the Steelers stopped contending for Super Bowls after they got beat by the Packers in the 2010 SB. These people are relics from when the Steelers were dominant and the Panthers had not been formed yet. Give it a few years and they'll disappear, just like the Redskins and Falcons fans in North Carolina have."

I know a lot of people who are in the same boat. I'm sure there are some bandwagon. But most of us are true PIT & CAR fans. Pittsburgh was just so populated in the 70's, with the Steel Mills and all, & when we got hit by a terrible economy, everyone moved everywhere else. So that's why we're everywhere."

And if the people you know are ""true PIT & CAR fans"" and are wearing their Steeler jerseys to games where the Steelers aren't playing, tell them to stop.  The same thing is true of the Packers for the last 30 years, and the Patriots in the last 15 years, and for the Cowboys in the 90's, and the Bulls from late 80's and throughout the 90's, and the Lakers from friggin' forever.

Vikings are top 10? New Orleans has a shit season and loses one of their best/softest targets and are 10th. Buffalo doesn't have a great OLine, has shit at QB, traded for a RB that couldn't run behind arguably the best OLine in the league, hired a defensive HC when they had 0 issues on Defense and they're above us?  The Dolphins get one of the most dominant DLineman in the league and got rid of the most overrated WR in the league and drop?   None of this makes sense. Whoever made this must think Mike Wallace is god's gift, Vikings shouldn't have risen that high and Dolphins shouldn't have dropped."

We played all but one game without hardy and I'm sure we are fine to move on without him, at least we better be."
panthers,39c9nv,Vanelz,2,Wed Jun 10 23:19:17 2015 UTC,"We also were missing Frank Alexander for most of last year, which is also an under-mentioned facet of why our pass rush was weaker. It wasn't just Hardy.  We have Alexander back and Ealy looks like he could progress nicely this year after turning it on late in 2014. If both of these guys can produce, our pass rush should be much better this year.  Speaking of pass rushing, the inclusion of a coverage linebacker will also help with the pass rush since we can work more blitz packages on passing situations. I expect to see Harper, Luke and even TD to be sent in to rush the QB more this year."

If it looks like teams are stacking 8, or sending in 5-6 on a blitz, we need to move to a read-option oriented offense that allows Cam and our RB tandem to stretch the field horizontally to keep defenses honest.

panthers,39c9nv,mattdocks,6,Wed Jun 10 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"Charles Johnson is far more important to our defense than Short.  Johnson has been our best player on the defensive line for many years.  He may not be the flashy flirt-with-20-sacks kind of player, but he is the one that opposing offensive lines adjust for in both the running and passing game.

panthers,39c9nv,MisterRandyMarsh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:28:32 2015 UTC,Well if you take out the fullback you either need another tight end or a third receiver. I'd say he could basically be a starter.

Feel free to use it, but it's pretty low quality  http://i.imgur.com/ZZsIAr7.jpg  I also wrote this on CSR a while ago about my experience  http://www.catscratchreader.com/2011/12/2/2606486/september-17th-1995?_ga=1.256073675.1371861255.1433983672   September 17th, 1995  That's when I took this picture. I was eight years old, attending my first Panthers game and their first ever regular season home home game at Clemson's Memorial Stadium. The Panthers lost to the Rams 31-10, but to be honest I had to look that up. When I remember that day I don't remember the outcome of the game. I remember being there with my family, the hot weather, and being exited that this game I had seen so much of on television was coming to my city at the professional level. I think of being sixteen years old, watching Steve Smith catch that pass in overtime, once again against the Rams, to send the Panthers to the Super Bowl. Of course the Panthers lost to the Patriots that year, but even as a kid I was so damn proud of that team and the game they played and it seemed the whole city felt the same way. Since the beginning I have been fortunate enough to attend at least one game every year. I wan't to keep that streak for my whole life if I can. I am very grateful to my father for always taking me and you can bet if I ever have kids they'll go to as many games as they can stand/I can afford.  Today I used this picture to remind myself why I am a Panthers fan, and I am posting it hoping that it encourages others to do the same. I consider myself very fortunate to have been there from the inception of this franchise. I've seen the best and worst of our team, but like many of you I have been a fan all along. Let's face it, it has been a while since Panther fans have had that much to celebrate, our latest taste was soured by the infamous playoff game against Arizona, but I remember what it felt like, and I believe that we will experience that again before Cam's time here is done. I am doing my best to be able to find a job and stay in Charlotte because I want to be here when it happens. Millions of people across our region will collectively celebrate once again, and we'll all be able to agree on one thing. Cam Newton will go down as the greatest thing to ever happen to the Carolina Panthers.  At least that's the way I see it.  Go Panthers!"

panthers,3993we,biggin528,10,Wed Jun 10 20:32:41 2015 UTC,"Well since the others just pointed out their progression threads instead of answering your very quick questions, I thought I'd go ahead and do it, hoping it's still relevant:  1) From left to right: Mike ""The Tank"" Tolbert, FB. Greg ""Third Leg"" Olsen, TE. Cam ""Superman"" Newton, QB. Luke ""Our god, lord, and savior"" Kuechly (it's pronounced ki-kly, just in case), LB. and finally Thomas ""The best human on the planet"" Davis, also LB. Some other notables are our running back Jonathan Stewert, long time player that struggled with injuries but really carried us to the playoffs last season. Defensive end Charles Johnson, pretty big guy on the defense under a massive contract. Wide Receiver Kelvin Benjamin, our number one receiver that we drafter last year, turned out pretty good on his rookie season.  So the general idea of the team is pounding defense under Luke and TD who are our leaders. Luke was named defensive player of the year one season ago, and he is absolutely amazing. On the other side we have Cam, one of the most athletic QBs to ever grace the sport. He can turn any play into a miracle.  2) Expectations are pretty high, we are the first team to win the NFC South two years in a row, and considering the state of the division, everyone is basically looking for a hat trick. We have struggled with our offensive line but improved it in free agency (hopefully), and all our key pieces have mostly stayed on the team with the exception of a DE named Greg Hardy, but I won't go into that. So basically, everyone is expecting playoffs at the very least.  3) That's a big question. The hype around our number one pick is pretty big, a lot of people are hoping he'll join Luke and TD in our LB core and make it even more godly (the pair is already considered the best in the league by most sources). He's planned to be the future replacement for TD since he is getting up there in age soon, or that he'll play a sort of hybrid strong safety, and basically be a fumble recovery god.  Second notable rookie is Devin Funchess, another tall receiver to help Cam on offense. Cam is slightly notorious for overthrowing targets so the management's solution was draft tall as hell receiver that can jump and get balls that corners can never get to, and Funchess is just like that. Expectations vary, some think he'll be a red zone god, some thing he'll just be a decent number two, some think it'll take a while before he's a big impact...hard to say.  I don't have much to say about the other rookies, Artis-Payne is supposedly a sleeper RB that can turn out good but...meh, who knows?  4) Rivals, as stated, are first and foremost the fucking saints. 'cause...fuck the saints. Accept it, breath it, embrace it. Other then that, obviously all division teams are rivals, but I would also like to point out that all bird teams are the enemy (that is, Falcons, Seahawks, Eagles, Ravens) of the cat brotherhood teams (Bengals, Jags, Panthers, Lions), but you can take that as you wish.  Anything else noteworthy...TD was walter payton man of the year, the guy is basically a saint. Greg is an incredible TE and cool guy, probably top 3 in the league. Cam just signed a 100 million dollar deal, officially making him our franchise QB (not that anyone had any doubt about it). Amm...Oh, Steve Smith, one of the longest and best panthers players in history, was released last season and everyone is kind of sad about it, he plays for the ravens now, so if they happen to win the superbowl then be happy that our boy smitty finally got the ring we all wanted to give him, and that he so deserves, but was taken away from him by Brady and his bunch in 2003(right?).  I dunno, that's a bout as good a rundown as I can give. hope that helps you get started and join the hype. Welcome to the Panthers woooo~~"

panthers,3993we,mfortin014,5,Wed Jun 10 15:52:17 2015 UTC,"Mind if I make a monstrosity of a post?  On offense...  Notable guys: QB Cam Newton (#1) ""Superman"", WR Kelvin Benjamin (#13), TE Greg Olsen (#88), RB Jonathan Stewart (#28) are the most important guys. RB/FB Mike Tolbert (#35) is a fan favorite as well because he's basically a bowling ball with feet.  Our O-line isn't stacked with big names, the biggest is probably C Ryan Kalil (#67).  Strong points on offense: We have a QB/TE/WR group who'd probably be a really damn good basketball team.   Cam especially is a huge dude with a great arm and great speed and strength. One of the most exciting players in the league easily.  Weak points on offense: Last year, the line was dire for the first 3/4 of the year. This got Cam really banged up and made it tough to showcase the skill position talent. They got a bit better thanks to turning the guard and RT spots over to young guys later in the year. Left Tackle- probably manned by Michael Oher to start with- is the big question mark. Oher has never been a world-beater, and last year Byron Bell (no longer with the team) was probably the worst tackle in the NFL.  Cam can struggle with accuracy at times, particularly high when under a lot of pressure. One of the smarter things we've done is invest in big guys around him to help alleviate any worries in that direction.  J-Stew has health issues. When healthy, he's dynamite.  Stylisitcally, the offense likes to hold the ball and pound the crap out of the defense. If we're rolling, the team will hold the ball for 35+ of the sixty minutes and grind the opposing defense into the dust.   Don't sleep on the big plays though, Cam has a really nice deep ball when he gets time and there's a man open. Cam also is capable of eating huge chunks of yardage with his feet and basically carrying the offense at times. He picked up the Superman tag because of his signature endzone celebration, which is awesome.  On defense....  Notable guys: DE Charles Johnson- ""Big Money"" or ""CJ"" (#95), DT Star Lotulelei (#98), DT Kawann Short- ""KK"" (#99), MLB Luke Kuechly (#59), OLB Thomas Davis (#58).  Strong points on defense: The front seven. We have a really, really, really good set of D-linemen and linebackers. Luke is a former Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, Thomas Davis somehow remains criminally underrated (no lie, one of the best LBs around- after three knee surgeries no less!), CJ is most notable outside of the fanbase for his huge contract given by our previous GM but he's become one of the very best DEs in the league.   The D-Line in particular is very well rounded. Stereotypically, DTs smush the run and DEs rush the passer. Our guys do that, but CJ is very good against the run and Star/KK collapse the pocket from the center in pass-rush situations.  Weak points on defense: Defensive secondary. The Panthers secondary was horrid for most of last year, but again a youth movement salvaged things. CB Josh Norman is a legitimately excellent cover guy. CB Bene Benwikere and S Tre Boston performed very well after taking the starting jobs from underperforming vets. S Roman Harper is the old man of the defense. His speed and athleticism have eroded a lot, but he's still very steady and capable of making huge plays.  Stylistically, the defense is young, hungry, and extremely aggressive. Harper, Johnson, and Davis are the veteran leaders. The D likes to bring the heat on the opposing QB, and our excellent front seven makes it very difficult to run on the defense consistently.  The defense struggled early last year thanks to the secondary issues and having to replace semi-loveable knucklehead former DE Greg Hardy, but came on very strong later in the year as the secondary got fixed and our other DEs (notably Kony Ealy, last year's 2nd round pick) adjusted.  On Special teams...  Names to know: K Graham Gano (#9), P Brad Nortman (#8), LS JJ Jansen (#44). Gano may be the best kickoff man in the NFL flat out, though he did have a few hiccups on the field goal front last year. Nortman is a very solid NFL punter- he's been near the top of the charts in both distance and hangtime (as an aside, one of the worst TV decisions the networks that cover the NFL has made is removal of the hangtime clock display on punts). Jansen is one of the best long-snappers in the league, which means you will never hear the announcers talk about him since if they're talking about the LS that means he done goofed.  ST was a weakness last year (iffy coverages on kickoffs and punts, poor return work) thanks to some depth issues and the inability to nail down a consistent kick returner. Bringing back WR Ted Ginn should help with that.  Our expectations are to win the division. We've won it the last two years, with records of 12-4 and 7-8-1 (last year was weird for a lot of reasons). As a result, we're riding a two year playoff streak as well as being the first team to win the NFC South in consecutive years since the divisional realignment (!!!). Realistically, the team probably isn't good enough to make the Super Bowl this year. Champsionship contention in the near future feels plausible though, as many of our best players are in their early-to-mid 20s and GM Dave Gettleman has done a very good job so far addressing the weaknesses left in the team by his predecessor. The team is very young in general- not many guys over 30.  For our rookies, the two to watch are our first two. OLB Shaq Thompson was one of the most exciting players in the NCAA last year playing multiple positions, and a guy who divides opinion among scouts for a variety of reasons. WR Devin Funchess gives Cam another big guy to target on the outside, and has impressed so far in workouts.  For our rivals: The NFC South can get heated. Generally, death to the Aints -> Fuck the Falcons -> Fuck the Bucs. An irrational hated of New Orleans, Louisiana in general, and people named Drew (Brees, the Saints' QB) or Matt (Ryan, the Falcons' ass of a QB) is encouraged. Don't hate the city of Atlanta though, Cam is from the ATL.  Out-of-division rivals include Pittsburgh and Dallas. In fairness, just about everyone who isn't a Dallas fan hates the Cowboys. But whatever."

Another thing you should know is that we are viewed as a small market team so we don't get much national coverage.

panthers,398a51,uniquecannon,3,Wed Jun 10 08:44:02 2015 UTC,He didn't have any recorded game time anywhere but there may have been some pictures or video or something of him working with the team at practice.  He was only signed with the team for the final 2 games in December and then playoffs.  Edit:  He DID play versus Seattle in the postseason.  Had an assisted tackle so he was on the field that game.  I guess postseason wasn't included in the information I used.  Good catch!
panthers,398a51,AbsurdSpud,3,Wed Jun 10 13:19:15 2015 UTC,Even though Star and Short have been very good I think/hope they'll get that 3rd year breakout. Even if it only happens to one of them we're in damn good shape since we kept Edwards and Cole.
panthers,398a51,hurneynator,5,Wed Jun 10 00:56:35 2015 UTC,"I honestly believe the D-line as a whole is about to have an incredible season.  I think Kony/Star/KK all improve dramatically, Mario Addison and Frank Alexander prove they have good value for the team, and CJ shows everybody why he's the highest paid DE in the league."
panthers,398a51,hurneynator,3,Wed Jun 10 01:13:28 2015 UTC,"Great breakdown. I personally didn't see the 'regression' with Star. What I saw were defenses keying in on him by running a lot of inside gap plays and combo blocking him a lot more. CJ was dealing with that early season ankle injury and Hardy being gone. Star himself also dealt with injuries, but the overall level of play from Star IMO was at a very high level. KK also broke out last season, so it may seem like Star regressed because his own improvement wasn't as obvious. Star did completely take over that Atlanta game in the finale as well.  Hopefully, Star and KK are going to be two foundational pieces of this team going forward. IMO they both have a chance to be special players if they stay healthy and continue to develop. Hope Gettleman is able to sign both of them."
panthers,396huz,friendo_not_friend,13,Tue Jun 9 16:36:23 2015 UTC,That's interesting. I was under the impression that he already was our primary running back as of last season.
panthers,396huz,Neri25,6,Tue Jun 9 17:17:24 2015 UTC,Agreed. I think the article is just highlighting the fact that this is the first offseason where Jstew projects as the sole primary back because Dwill is no longer with the team.
panthers,396huz,illwillisilll,3,Tue Jun 9 17:34:22 2015 UTC,It's always been a matter of injuries with Stewart as opposed to talent. If he stays healthy for a full year he'll be up there with the best of them.
panthers,396huz,enfyte416,2,Tue Jun 9 19:23:09 2015 UTC,Good. Barring injury I think he'll easily rush for 1000 and some change next season. Especially if CAP proves to be as NFL ready as every says he is.

panthers,3964xy,hurneynator,2,Wed Jun 10 02:25:31 2015 UTC,"Here is the most puzzling quote: :That’s simply what an adequate NFL quarterback costs. Newton’s contract is not a testament to Newton—it’s a testament to the price of his position. It was the same with Ryan Tannehill, who got a new deal shortly before Newton did. (And by the way, Tannehill, who has improved each year in his career, is a much better player and long-term prospect than his Carolina counterpart)."""
panthers,3964xy,SickBurnBro,2,Tue Jun 9 15:11:11 2015 UTC,"That article was by Andy Benoit apparently, not Peter King, but point taken."
panthers,3964xy,enfyte416,2,Tue Jun 9 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"Is the main point of what he is saying actually false though? I say this as someone who thinks Cam earned his contract and is definitely better than Tannehill, but he is 100% correct to say that there is a premium on the QB position, and a top 15 QB is going to get paid close to 100 mil just by nature of the fact that a serviceable QB is incredibly hard to find. What have players like Jay Cutler and Andy Dalton done to earn their 9 figure contracts? Teams are strong armed into make these deals with QB's because the position is so important. The team has 0 leverage in negotiations because if they don't give into a price, the QB/agent knows there are 15 teams without a solid QB who will bend over backwards to get one."
panthers,3964xy,hurneynator,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:28:00 2015 UTC,"It's very lazy armchair analysis IMO. The point mentions is valid in the salary structure of QBs; however, that's not the conclusion he makes, ""Cam was overpaid"",   He doesn't believe Cam's play warranted that type of contract...after which he decides to do some unwarranted psychoanalysis of Cam and mentions some valid criticisms like Cam's accuracy issues without giving bipartisan context by talking about Cam's improvement as a player in areas such as reading coverages and overall pocket movement while elevating a slow and unreliable WR core last year, and the increasing salary cap, to which Cam's flat cap hits on a per year basis has a chance of looking very good down the road.  In addition, his comment about Cam's 'decision making' is off base. From where he was his rookie season, Cam's decision making has improved with every season. I like Ryan Tannehill and he's an improving player; however...to state that he's a much better long term prospect than Newton is also completely premature. Tannehill's improvement IMO had a lot to do with the system he was in (Chip Kelly's). I couldn't find a single clip this past season where Tannehill threw it down the field.  Benoit revealed his biases and his inability to provide relevant football analysis. Some of the stuff he was saying almost seemed Nolan Nawrocki-esque IMO."

Guys like Cian Fahey, Matt Bowen, the NFL Breakdowns guys, and Greg Cosell put out the best work because of this.  Even guys like Greg Cosell who don't like Cam, I can respect their opinion because he uses film to make his points and he's the first one to reveal that his own bias is for a statue-esque, pure pocket passing quarterback, which is a mold that Cam doesn't fit. In the end though, that part of his analysis is still a bias.  Film work is what differentiates 'journalists' from 'football analysts' and click bait from good articles."
panthers,3964xy,AbsurdSpud,2,Wed Jun 10 00:54:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I'm completely fine with someone saying Cam is terrible and we're gonna regret giving him this much if they can give actual analysis, show plays where Cam is consistently hurting the team, or that he's even more inaccurate than we already thought.   But stuff like this? Like you said, it's lazy and disappointing."
panthers,3964xy,andybader,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:09:15 2015 UTC,"But which is it?  ""...they overpaid for Newton,"" or ""That’s simply what an adequate NFL quarterback costs.""  Unless he's saying that Cam isn't even adequate, and I think that's foolish."

panthers,394ere,b1gkat,5,Tue Jun 9 04:32:51 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, he apparently hasn't been any good recently, so we could get him for cheap probably. And who knows, a lot of people that have played like shit before, once they find a new home they can succeed. I wouldn't mind us signing him. Two brothers on the same O line? Now that's chemistry!"
panthers,394ere,Reneau,6,Tue Jun 9 04:59:41 2015 UTC,"I didn't really like the idea of it until I remembered the whole brothers thing. Apparently Matt has been very unmotivated, and I can't think of anything that could get him to love football again better than playing with family."

panthers,394ere,Sharpshooter90,2,Tue Jun 9 13:51:27 2015 UTC,"Usually I wouldn't like the idea either but like I said, playing with Ryan can do a lot for him. I'm normally the person who likes to be the pessimist in these kinds of situations but everyone with a sibling knows that a little brotherly competition can bring out the best in them, and that can end up being Matt's motivation.

panthers,394ere,ThisDerpForSale,2,Tue Jun 9 06:14:05 2015 UTC,"What makes Oher a ""stop gap"" and kalil the future.  Both are pretty young and have been pretty bad.  Is it that Oher is already on the team?"
panthers,394ere,Sharpshooter90,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:53:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not OP, so I can only guess what he meant.  But I think it's pretty clear that everyone assumes Oher is a short-term hope-and-pray fix.  He just doesn't have a track record in his five years in the NFL of being even an average starter.  He's well below average in every season except his first season.  I think we all hope he'll be solid, but no one expects any more than that.  So he's a stop gap measure until we draft or sign a better one.  I don't have much of an opinion on Kalil except that he may be ever-so-slightly more likely not to be terrible."
panthers,394ere,ThisDerpForSale,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:05:15 2015 UTC,"Yea agreed, Oher hasn't been anything special... but neither has Khalil.  I think  its a little unfair to already write off Oher and hop on the Khalil wagon without giving him a shot."
panthers,394ere,Sharpshooter90,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:17:05 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to say that we'll all be very happy if Oher is a success.

They specialize in German Styles.  I had to get an Olde Meck Copper and/or Mecktoberfest whenever I'm in town.   Sugar Creek is a stone's throw from Olde Meck (actually in Olde Meck's old building).  They focus on Belgian styles and have great sandwiches.   Triple C has some good pale ales and IPAs but has been hitting it out of the park with their barrel-aged releases recently.  Babymaker DIPA and Up All Night Breakfast Porter are killer.   Sycamore is the newest place open and is only about a mile from Triple C.  I haven't been there yet, but try seem to have a lot on tap.   Unknown is probably the closest to the stadium. I wasn't super impressed when they first opened, but they've since won me over with inventive and unique brews. They made an imperial lager last year with orange peel, spicy peppers, ... And 99 scorpions.   In the NoDa (North Davidson) area...  NoDa Brewing has been blowing up the last two years.  Their Hop, Drop, ' Roll IPA won a gold medal at a big beer competition and has since been flying off the shelves in NC. They make a lot of other great stuff too, like their Coco Loco porter.  Birdsong used to be next door to NoDa, but recently expanded to a new location.  Their Jalapeño Pale and MexiCali Stout are awesome.   Heist is an artsy brewpub just north of NoDa.  They have good food and I've been eating good things about their beer since a new head brewer took over."

Benji has at least two examples. Add Berin's Butterfingers and the Bears tip play and that's 6 picks that aren't entirely on Cam.

With Norman playing lights out Bene being a beast. And dude, don't even let me get started if Coleman plays decently. Off season boner material here guys."
panthers,38rmlr,WorkingLikaBoss,3,Sat Jun 6 06:21:41 2015 UTC,"I totaly agree. I like to base alot of my optimism off of madden because its actually a fairly accurate interpretation of how players make an impact based on their physical attributes.   Example: I always put colin jones in at nickel back because the panthers did it IRL so why not (hes like a 60-something at corner position, not so good) BUT his speed is enough, i swear he gets a pick or a really good play every time. Downloaded a user uploaded roster with all new rookies and shaq is pretty nice having on the edge... That speed is too nice (albeit slightly inaccurate cause its made by a user but not a panthers fan so no bias)   SO ya alot of yall may not value this at all but i think thats exactly why Shaq will be successful BECAUSE he has two super star teammates in Luke ad TD, he doesnt need to be a perfect player at his position quite yet, he can make an impact through pure athleticism and simply knowing how to play ball IMO."

And ya i definitely expect shaq to get the upper hand on AJ, and that is MOST DEFINITELY not a representation of how klein has played because i really like that guy, he certainly deserves his minutes on that Defense"
panthers,38rmlr,btbessaay,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:46:47 2015 UTC,"Yep, his regular card is 80 OVR and his elite card is 94. By comparison, Luke's regular card is 86 OVR."

I feel like hes so freaking good in real life, hes one of the few -not- overrated players on madden. Hes in on every play just like the real Luke.   Dont believe me, if you're within a couple miles from the stadium during a home game you'll think a star wars convention is occurring (star wars music along with LUUUUUKE chant after pretty much everytime his name is mentioned)"
panthers,38rmlr,Lumb33,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:51:57 2015 UTC,"I forget the exact number but there's an elite card with him that has him in the high 90s. But it's pretty rare.  To be fair, some of the numbers look a little wonky. I picked up Jonathan Stewart last night - an elite card with 91 OVR. LeSean McCoy's elite card is an 88 OVR. It boils down to the fact that Stewart can run into traffic and McCoy has a 65 for that stat. Otherwise, McCoy is slightly faster and more agile.  If you had asked me, I'm not sure I would have rated Stewart above McCoy but Madden did."
panthers,38rmlr,uniquecannon,7,Wed Jun 10 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"With all the talk of the BPA strategy, it seems a lot of Panthers fans and talking heads nationally failed to see the value of this pick.  This was, in actuality, about filling a team need.  Think about it.  The Panthers are a 4-3 base defense but feel like they have greater success in nickle and prefer it whenever possible.  People criticize Thompson for being a 'tweener' but in actuality, what could possibly be better for how the Panthers play defense than having a third linebacker with skills similar to a defensive back?  Now they can play their base defense AND gain a lot of the things they like about nickle packages with the same personnel groupings.  Plus, the Panthers now have someone with similar skills to TD to replace him once he retires."
panthers,38rmlr,TomNJ,3,Sat Jun 6 14:29:24 2015 UTC,Totally agree with this post bro!!! I already envision the defensive scores he is going to put up this year when the ball hits his hands.
panthers,38rmlr,net403,2,Sat Jun 6 12:32:52 2015 UTC,"When you're playing a linebacker who is essentially the bodytype of a running back, interceptions are going to mostly result in lots of returned yards."

panthers,38rmlr,enfyte416,2,Sat Jun 6 15:15:46 2015 UTC,Got high hopes and expectations.  Can't wait for 6 or 8 games to pass to see how he shapes up in mid-season form like our rookies on D last year.  Having Luke and TD with him can only be an advantage
panthers,38rmlr,endernyc,2,Sun Jun 7 03:32:37 2015 UTC,"I love Shaq as a player and loved the pick on draft day. I think he will succeed based on his own merits.   With that being said, I hate this argument.  Curtis painter sat behind Peyton Manning for years and never even became a relevant back up. A.j Klein showed flashes of potential for us, but playing with Luke and TD didn't bring him to the next level. Playing alongside great players doesn't guarantee greatness. The player needs to have the talent and desire to reach their potential in their own right."
panthers,38rmlr,enfyte416,-1,Sun Jun 7 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"Except Klein doesn't have the potential or talent of Shaq.   Shaq is a different kind of athlete, he has a way higher ceiling than Klein coming out of college."
panthers,38rmlr,endernyc,2,Sun Jun 7 16:55:28 2015 UTC,Shaq is a statistically average athlete based on his combine and pro day numbers. He's a great talent and I love that we have him on our team but you're missing the point of what I said anyway.

panthers,38rmlr,endernyc,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:34:59 2015 UTC,"Read my comment and tell me where you say I thought he was. I said he ""showed flashes of potential,"" which he certainly did, but in the end he performed about how you would expect a mid round player to perform.   My point is that playing with great players doesn't mean you will also turn out great by association and there are thousands of examples of this in the NFL so if you really don't like the Klein example enough that you need to pick it out to try and disprove my argument, I can go find you some more."
panthers,38rmlr,hurneynator,0,Tue Jun 9 01:37:17 2015 UTC,.. Then don't talk about greatness and Klein in the same paragraph? Shaq is physically more suited for the NFL game and if he has the mental ability he'll be fine.

He was completely pumped up for the Panthers/Saints game before he died.   So,  in honor of him, the entire family watched the game together.  His wife who hadn't ever watched football more than in the background was watching intently... And when the Saints took the lead with little time remaining,  she asked me if we could still win.  I told her it was possible,  but unlikely.  I could see the sadness in her eyes becuse as silly as it was,  I suppose we all kind of thought a win was just supposed to happen that day.   You know thr story.  We drive down the field,  Hixon makes the catch.  Carolina wins the game and pretty much locks up the NFC South that day.   It was a good day after a really shitty week."

panthers,38r54k,BlindWillieJohnson,12,Sun Jun 7 07:39:46 2015 UTC,"I don't tell this story often, becuase if I did, the folks on /r/nfl wouldn't listen to anything I said. But my favorite Panthers memory is the Panthers teaching me to love football.  I never liked football. I never really liked sports. I was indifferent to all of it. Then, shortly after I got out of college, some friends of mine organized a fantasy football league and let me join as a way of keeping in touch. It wasn't my thing, but I loved them, so I signed up.  We had an autodraft and I had no idea what I was doing. I ended up getting Cam Newton, Steve Smith and our defense. So as I found myself enjoying the competition, I also found myself watching the games, particularly the Panthers games since I owned so many of our players. I fell in love with this team; the personalities on it, the way we played defense, our young QB and our underdog story.  I've become a fanatic since then; both of the Panthers and football in general. I'll always root for this team, good times and bad ones because they opened my eyes to how great this all is."

Sure, I have great memories of our Super Bowl run, or taking out Dallas (I think it was) in our second year towards an improbable idea of a Jags and Panthers Super Bowl. But, I was just a kid enjoying football. Yet, last year meant a lot.   Screw the whole shit mountain stuff, we fought and got our first playoff win in what felt like eons. I had a terrible year personally in all of '14. That win against the Cardinals meant the world to me."

panthers,38r54k,AbsurdSpud,3,Sat Jun 6 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"It was the 1996 divisional playoff game. Irving had been a massive shit before the game getting caught in a hotel room with a couple of girls and some coke. Others on the team were doing ill-type things. I remember being so hyped for it. I live in NC but was visiting my Dad in Connecticut that year. I went with a buddy to the ESPN Sports Zone in Times Square to watch the game and when Irving got his collarbone broken in the 1st quarter by Lamar ""Pepper"" Lathon, I was sooo happy.   I know that sounds messed up but you have to understand that it was THE COWBOYS back when that meant something and Carolina was a massive underdog having never played a playoff game despite being undefeated at home that year. When Irving took that hit, all I could think was, ""That's what you get."" And it only got better from there.   To cap it off, Sam Mills got the INT with under 2 minutes to go to seal it. The announcer said, ""THE KING IS DEAD! THE PANTHERS ARE HEADED TO GREEN BAY TO TAKE ON THE PACKERS FOR THE NFC CHAMPIONSHIP!""  Carolina won that game 26-17. It was glorious.

In 2013 when I learned she was cheating on me we broke up. The very next day Carolina beat Minnesota to begin their 8-game win streak. They didn't lose a game for over a month. The Panthers defense sacked Kaeperdick 6 times, they beat the Patriots on MNF, they beat the Bucs twice, they just fucking won.  When I was at a personal low, the Panthers showed up big. The 2013 season was special for a lot of reasons, but to have that team perform that well... it was more than I could have ever asked for."
panthers,38r54k,Aurion7,3,Sat Jun 6 22:34:18 2015 UTC,"I've mentioned this one a few times, it isn't all that special but it's by far the greatest game in my opinion. It was Week 2 of the 03 season, Jake's first start, against the defending champs, and back then they were by far our biggest rival, the Bucs(who I still hate even though theyve been shit for a decade).   I'm sure a lot of you know this game, if you don't go back and try to watch any footage you can, it's the Platonic Ideal of a Panther game. Hard fought defensive battle, impossible odds defied, a year of your life shaved off by the end and yeah.   Anyway, we had blocked two kicks(a FG and punt), we were winning 9-3 when the Bucs scored a touchdown, tying the game with ""'Automatica'"" coming out to seal the game.  Oh yeah, there was no time left on the clock. The game was basically over.   I was watching the game at a family party, the camera cut to the scoreboard where there was no time on the clock 0:00. My cousin says to me 3 zeroes 3 blocked kicks. I just kinda laughed it off. Who blocks a PAT?   Turns out Panthers block PAT's. We blocked a goddamn gimme chip in, a play considered so automatic they're making it more difficult.   So we end up winning the game. Someone mentioned the Week 1 matchup, and that was a pretty magical turnaround, but for me this was the game that kick started what I think is one of the greatest seasons by a team ever. I obviously can't say it's my unbiased opinion, but I doubt there are 5 more seasons that had as much drama, as many great plays and intense moments as the 03-04 Panthers. If you had to make a movie about a season I doubt any woukd be as entertaining as ours. I remember watching Friday Night Lights thinking how ridiculous it was that a team had so many close games that they miraculously win in the final moments, but they were the Panthers, so it made sense, cause it happened to us."

Best memory of the season was the home game against the Falcons, specifically Kerry Collins' bomb to Willie Green to blow the game open.  I hadn't heard the stadium blow up like that since I had watched a college football game or two at Clemson.  I'll never forget.  One of the few times it felt like a true home field advantage that year.  (note: it's too bad that the only home game I didn't go to that year was the Jet's game.  I would have loved to see Sam Mill's INT in person.  Instead, because the game was blacked out, I had to hear it on the Radio then see the Fox Sports highlight of it)."

Gettleman and Rivera makes it a point to specify those players in seemingly every press conference. If there's money to fit all those guys to contracts and still sign Norman, think it happens.   Norman was the single biggest reason for the Panthers turnaround last year IMO. His performances against guys like Maclin, Julio Jones (twice), Josh Gordon, and especially Mike Evans were shutdown corner caliber."

panthers,38lhl9,squidravioli,13,Fri Jun 5 01:00:39 2015 UTC,"The guy turns nothing into something more times than not. I'd say he's worth it. He's electrifying to watch, and by all accounts a true leader for the team. My only actual complaint is he has some issues with mechanics, but he was playing injured for most of last year so we will just have to wait and see.  All in all, well worth the price. Panthers fans know all too well about paying a premium price for multiple mediocre players..."
panthers,38lhl9,fisting_for_freedom,2,Fri Jun 5 01:14:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, I heard ""Cam still hasn't learned not to throw off of his back foot"" too many times last year. Did you see 2013? People forget that the injured ankle was his front foot."
panthers,38lhl9,AnchorDrops9,10,Fri Jun 5 04:13:00 2015 UTC,Worth every penny. He does well with less than his quarterback peers (Wilson and Luck) do. This year he finally has a solid supporting cast and I think he will have a breakout year.
panthers,38lhl9,thehungriestbear,8,Fri Jun 5 01:28:08 2015 UTC,From a Saints fan. Cam is the real deal - wait 'til the guy gets an O-line.
panthers,38lhl9,DeepWelshVoice,6,Fri Jun 5 11:01:43 2015 UTC,"He brought our team back from the grave. He has all the potential in the world. He hasn't been given the right tools to work with until IMO this year. The OL and receivers were subpar and that's an understatement. It would be tough to find a true panthers fan who doesn't believe he deserves this contract considering the leader he has become, the drive, the maturation he has shown, and the potential he has. He is a top 10 QB right now and could be a top 5 once our new GM shapes the team to his liking and we straighten out our Cap situation completely from our old GM."
panthers,38lhl9,CardiacCatz159,6,Fri Jun 5 11:57:42 2015 UTC,He's the most athletically gifted athlete in Panthers and maybe NFL history. He will drive us to the chip!!! Go get em Cammy Cam.
panthers,38lhl9,Panthaaaaas,4,Fri Jun 5 01:44:15 2015 UTC,"You can't look at Cam's stats to gauge how much better he's been getting. His decision making has continually gotten better, quite a few of his picks last year have come from his WR's not finishing routes and being where they're supposed to be. He's frustrating cause he can be insanely accurate and get balls in to spots few other QB's can, but then he'll throw a deep ball about 7 yards too far. The areas he really needs work is dumpoff passes(he puts no touch on them) and sliding, it isn't even that he's taking hits it's that he dives forward to the ground rather than taking a slide.   Another problem is that our OC has been pretty slow with building the offense, last year this was mainly a personnel problem as the entire offense was different outside of Cam, Olsen and the RB's. Only one starter on the OLine was returning to the same position, none of our wideouts returned. I think the problems with personnel lead to the Offense taking a while to lead to the faster paced/no huddle offense that Shula(our OC) had talked about using prior to the season. We did finally start to use it around Week 11(yeah, a long ass wait) but Cam looked a lot better. I expect we see more of it next season, but we'll still retain the emphasis on the ground game.   The question is a little ridiculous, though I get what you mean. If you have a franchise QB you gotta pay him, Cam isn't elite yet but he's a franchise QB, that's his floor. You'll see in another 4 years when Bortles is up to be re-signed. So yeah, he deserves it, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's trying to renegotiate in 3 years cause his contract looks modest in comparison to other players."
panthers,38lhl9,AbsurdSpud,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:14:50 2015 UTC,How is the question ridiculous? I didn't think Cam Newton has earned that salary yet.
panthers,38lhl9,AbsurdSpud,7,Fri Jun 5 03:51:33 2015 UTC,"So you don't know much about the Panthers but you know enough to think Cam doesn't deserve his contract?   It's ridiculous because we're talking about a Franchise QB, and Franchise QB contracts are insane. You don't really have leverage when trying to sign a QB either. If we didn't sign him, he wouldn't have gone out and found a cheaper contract, we would just have lost out on a QB. That's why it's ridiculous. You can't just judge his contract to other QB's who signed their deals years ago in a cheaper market, with a lesser cap.   His numbers are close to Brees', but Brees signed his contract in a different timeframe cap-wise. So the question is ridiculous because it's kinda naive as far as contracts and the cap go. Cam is highly paid, but once the next crop of QB's sign their contracts Cam's deal is gonna look a lot more reasonable, and possibly like a steal."
panthers,38lhl9,BlindWillieJohnson,2,Fri Jun 5 04:37:25 2015 UTC,"How is the question ridiculous? I didn't think Cam Newton has earned that salary yet.   You also need to understand that player contracts are as much about the market as they are the player. Sure, looking at the number out of context makes you think, ""Does he deserve to get paid that kind of money? He makes more than Rodgers.""  But there's more to it than that. The simple fact is that the salary cap has gone up about 15% since the big guys got theirs. That means salaries inflate. Cam is a franchise QB and those guys are rare as hell. The alternative is to go with the schlubs in free agency or spend years trying to find a guy to develop. By that token, spending 9% of the cap on a guy who's proven he wins you games isn't so bad, especially when you compare that percentage to the top dogs (Sparing Brady, who deliberately takes a low salary; something you can afford to do when your wife outearns you).   Cam's done right by our team. He took us from a forgettable franchise that struggled to win more than 5 games a year to a perennial contender for our division. We've made the playoffs two of the four years he's been with us. He's put some truly terrible teams on his back and given them better seasons than they had any right to have. He makes our offensive weapons better with his skill. He is every ounce a franchise QB and he deserves every cent of his contract."
panthers,38lhl9,AbsurdSpud,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:50:36 2015 UTC,"You explained the whole market and cap percentage thing a lot better than I did. The more I look at Cam's deal the more I like it, the bulk of the cap hit is early, which allows us to work around it pretty easily."
panthers,38lhl9,AbsurdSpud,0,Sun Jun 7 02:55:02 2015 UTC,"Right, I don't know very much about the Panthers. So when I see a QB with his stats and experience,  I was surprised to see hI'm getting paid with Peyton Manning money."
panthers,38lhl9,biggin528,3,Fri Jun 5 05:10:53 2015 UTC,"You're looking at it wrong though, Qb contracts are just like that. There's people who think Wilson has benefited from Lynch and the Defense but when he re-signs I wouldn't be surprised if his numbers are close to Rodgers megadeal, even though he isn't close to as good as him. Flacco got a monster deal and while he's good he tends to be left out of Top 10 discussions(maybe not always but pretty often). Look at the deal Cutler got after proving all he can do is get injured and lose in the playoffs. I think Tannenhill is a little underrated and can be great but he's also getting Manning money. Kaep's deal is low on guaranteed money but he could potentially make more than most QB's in the league.   My point is that you're asking about Cam's contract without understanding the nature of QB contracts. If you're good you're either gonna get a ton of money or a SHIT ton of money. He isn't Elite yet, but he's good, and I don't think his deal is that bad when you look at the expanding cap. I seriously think he'll be considered underpaid by the time his deal is up."
panthers,38lhl9,Spiralyst,3,Fri Jun 5 15:54:56 2015 UTC,"Hes the only reason the panthers have had a shot in hell at winning more than a handful of games since he was brought aboard.  People try to compare him to the other young studs in this game and I think that's unfair in some ways.  Cam has done more for this team with less help than any QB in the league right now.  He has had a brutally awful offensive line, no WRs, and dealt with unfortunate injuries along the way and STILL managed to put up the numbers he has.  The only other QB in the league that is more franchise-friendly moving forward is Andrew luck, and his contract will make cam's look like child's play."
panthers,38lhl9,enfyte416,6,Fri Jun 5 04:25:18 2015 UTC,"He's kind of the definition of a game changer. He's never going to have Aaron Rodgers' level accuracy or put up Peyton Manning type of passing yards. But the Panthers are a running team. He fits our dynamic extremely well and adds an added dimension to our offense.  He's worth the money, IMHO. Especially when you consider that contracts are a product of both a player's potential and the market. If you had a QB that was constantly rated in the top 10-15 QB's every year, would you be willing to let him walk when you look at what's out there? Any QB that may be argued as better than Cam is locked up and will never see the open market. If that's the case, then you lock up your QB and hope for the best.   Watching the Panthers suffer 5 year droughts in between capable QB's is a pain I'd like not to have to worry about this decade. It makes managing the other facets of your team so much easier if you can have a player you trust in the most important position. Collectively, we're excited to have Cam and Luke for the next 5 years together. That's a solid foundation to build off."
panthers,38lhl9,liamc11,5,Fri Jun 5 03:42:28 2015 UTC,He's definitely worth the money. Most people don't get the market value thing. If we weren't to give that money to cam another team definitely would. That's just what it takes to lock up a QB nowaday.
panthers,38ktvv,AlphaVictory,6,Thu Jun 4 21:30:15 2015 UTC,It probably won't?  WTF?  Why not?  He put up similar numbers in 2013 and the team won 12 games.

How does the decision to sign Michael Oher and the decision not to draft a tackle early look now that Cam got this monster contract?   To me, left tackle is the only missing piece of the puzzle for this team. David Gettleman is a great football mind and he has never really given us a reason to doubt his talent evaluation, but the whole season could rest on the shoulders of a guy who washed out of the second worst team in the league last year. It's fucking terrifying.  I don't know what I would have done differently. I'm not sure that giving up the farm to move up in the first round would have been the right decision and I'm happy we have Shaq Thompson. Could we have pursued La'el Collins more aggressively?

Is there any fans that don't think Cam has shown noticeable improvement every season? Watching Cam grow has been one of my favorite things about the guy other than the smile and watching him turn sacks into first downs. I've been saying it the last two years now but he rarely makes bonehead what-the-fuck-are-you-doing throws, and when he does they tend to be in blowout losses(and relegated to 1-2 games a year). I'm glad the metrics show how good he's been.   The only question mark in my mind now is how Cam responds to getting the money, I don't see him settling but you never know. Personally I think he wants to be the MJ of the NFL, and we've seen the throws he's capable of making, the hits he can take and still get up with a smile, and how hard he is to take down, so his ceiling is the MJ of the NFL. I tend to think of his floor as Steve McNair-ish(hopefully with more rings). I don't know, I'm pretty pumped. Gettleman has shown his team building expertise and now he's giving out contracts that aren't embarrassing. Anyone else trying to figure out where to get their Keep Pounding tattoo? The Cam and Luke era is gonna be badass."
panthers,38ii2d,AbsurdSpud,2,Thu Jun 4 14:12:27 2015 UTC,"I think Cam is and will always be his biggest critic.  This isn't something you can teach or train and usually is the difference between players who flop after a payday, and those who continue to improve."

panthers,38ii2d,Slamela,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:35:52 2015 UTC,"I think it was when Gettleman first became GM, or early on at some point, they asked him if Cam was the answer or something like that and a lot was made of him taking a few seconds to answer. It wasn't a huge deal but I do remember people trying to make a story out of it."

Therefore, you gave us the stuff, we entice the fan base, the fan base creates content, the fans get the stuff, you ""reuse"" the content, and the circle is ""complete"".   Or more simply, you give to the fans, and the fans give back. We're merely arbitrators. And it's an excellent deal all around.   Panthers Fans love the Panthers, and clear the Panthers love their fans. It's about as win-win as it gets."

panthers,38edwa,TomNJ,10,Wed Jun 3 17:44:04 2015 UTC,"oof. the comments under that article are cringeworthy  like this guy:   What’s going on in that picture? It looks like he’s in full happy-run mode, but there’s a barrier RIGHT behind him. Did he just vault that thing? If so, HE BARELY MADE IT OVER which is an athletic feat more along the lines of Matt Hasselbeck-level athleticism*. This alone would make me worried about the contract.   so this guy thinks cam newton jumped over the barrier, as opposed to the obvious that he ran between it and the wall. then he says that he barely made it over this imaginary jump. and therefore that's evidence cam is not athletic. furthermore, that lack of athleticism is proof he doesn't deserve the contract. as if barrier-jumping is a factor in how good of a quarterback you are  holy. shit. is this what facebook comments are like? i avoid them like the plague. but i never dreamed there were people actually this dumb out there haha"

panthers,38edwa,Sir_Gunner,2,Thu Jun 4 07:41:42 2015 UTC,"Not just that but we can re-sign players around Cam's deal. It's weird to think of a 20 mil a year deal as team friendly, but with the expanding cap and the fact this is a franchise QB we're in pretty damn good shape. I wouldn't be surprised if GMan is so pumped he tries to get deals with Luke and Norman done before the season starts.   It's weird, I already loved GMan but after this deal I might be in love. If this draft works out he might need a restraining order on me.... Good thing im on the west coast."

Adding almost 30 million to the available salary cap will certainly help us re-sign Luke, KK, Star, KB, Norman, etc. as their rookie contracts expire."
panthers,38cvxf,FrenchQuaker,2,Wed Jun 3 15:03:33 2015 UTC,This will probably end up making Cam's contract look like a steal two seasons from now as well.
panthers,38cvxf,AbsurdSpud,6,Wed Jun 3 22:55:40 2015 UTC,"Cam's 2015-2020 salary cap numbers are: $13M, $19.5M, $20.166M, $21.5M, $23.2M & $21.1M.  This is a VERY cap-friendly deal. He saves us $1.4M this year. Gettleman's master plan is unfolding perfectly and we may actually be able to afford to keep Cam, Kuechly, Star and Benjamin together long-term."
panthers,38cvxf,TomNJ,7,Wed Jun 3 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"I don't have anything official, or maybe even helpful, but it looks like it is fairly front loaded.  Something like $30M in the first year.  I'm sure we are going to try to take the most pain up front and give us room to sign Luke next season and other top rookies/prospects in the next 3-5 years."
panthers,38cvxf,JCoxRocks,9,Wed Jun 3 12:39:36 2015 UTC,"Cap wise it's not front loaded at all as the majority of that $30M is guaranteed bonus.  Cap hit for the next 6 years looks to be $13M, $19.5M, $20.166M, $21.5M, $23.2M & $21.1M."

panthers,38cvxf,rabishop,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:18:44 2015 UTC,I may be wrong but I believe that initial 13 mil goes on top of his 5th year option this year so he's actually making like 30 mil next year. So basically it would be a little front loaded

panthers,38cvxf,alexesver,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:20:40 2015 UTC,"I read an article suggesting that the contract is going to make our defense take a hit like the Falcons and Ravens after they paid a heavy extension on their franchise QB's. I don't know why they think this. Our defense has been a very solid group and, outside of Charles Johnson, hasn't been a group we're paying a premium on.   We locked up Olsen and KB, Star and Luke are all on their rookie deals until at least 2016. If Bene and Boston and Ealy all perform, they'll all be on sub-first round rookie deals until 2018, at the earliest. If Shaq and DFunch work out, they'll be locked up through 2019. These are a lot of positions locked up on the cheap. A couple of positional groups will have to be hobbled together in tight cap situations. But the important thing is that our GM seems to know how to draft and draft deep. He also has relative success getting cast-off vets with leadership potential that come at bargain prices. As long as he continues to excel at these two practices, our cap situation shouldn't be an issue."
panthers,38cvxf,Spiralyst,3,Thu Jun 4 05:17:53 2015 UTC,When is lukes contract up? This season or next?
panthers,38cvxf,b1gkat,3,Wed Jun 3 15:40:49 2015 UTC,"If we take his 5th-year option next year, then he is not a free agent until AFTER the 2016 season - so 2 more seasons.  However, odds are that our FO will try to get a deal done with him next year similar to doing Cam's this year.  It makes both sides happy and allows for better cap management in the long run."

Does that get you higher performance?  Maybe.  Does it get you more consideration when it is time to re-sign?  Maybe.

panthers,389rwf,ThisDerpForSale,3,Tue Jun 2 21:44:36 2015 UTC,"He's the third highest paid QB (in terms of guaranteed money) for the moment.  But with Wilson and Luck set to sign new deals soon, that will change quickly.  Remember, relative contract numbers are fluid things, and it's not a reasonable comparison to compare a contract signed this year with one signed even 3 years ago.  Cam got paid because that's the market for his talents.  Pretty soon, it will turn out to have been a reasonable deal compared to the others coming up."

The way you have to look at it is, the problem with having a Franchise QB is paying him like a Franchise QB."

panthers,388t53,AbsurdSpud,3,Tue Jun 2 18:53:19 2015 UTC,"It's weird reading about Luke and words like legendary, but has the guy really shown anything other than a HoF career?   PFF(yeah, I know just give me a moment) wasn't big on him during his DPOY season, but he jumped up their rankings last season. Luke finds a weakness in his game and attacks it and tries to perfect it. As impressive as his stats and play is I really feel like he makes everyone around him better. The guy doesn't quit, he's at 100 percent from the first snap until the last, he gives his all regardless of how far he is from the play, the guy is amazing. He went from Defensive Rookie of the Year, to Defensive Player of the Year, to arguably his best season. All this in his first 3 years.  Once we nail him down we'll have the QB of our Offense and Defense set for a long time, and while Cam isn't elite yet, Luke is far and away the best QB of a defense and the fucking crazy thing is he probably hasn't hit his ceiling yet. I can see him getting more comfortable as his role as leader and giving everyone on D a +10 in attributes.   It doesn't always translate to Championships but it's pretty fucking cool that we have so many players on the team that are great at their position and that we can be proud to have on our team. I hope Luke can carry Davis' Man of the Year tradition and make it something all Panther players strive to achieve."
panthers,388t53,BananaGooP,2,Sat Jun 6 21:50:38 2015 UTC,I completely agree.  I'm excited to see him grow with this team.
panthers,388t53,BananaGooP,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:41:52 2015 UTC,As always beautiful! :)  Edit: Real question though.  Do you think they will consider Trusnik an OLB just so they can keep Mayo on roster and try and give him garbage time experience to expedite his growth since he has a steeper curve?
panthers,388t53,BananaGooP,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I doubt it.  You have to consider the other LBs that are likely to make the team.  The only reason I think we would have 7 total linebackers instead of 6 is due to some being valuable special teams players.  If we sign Luke, TD, Klein, Shaq, Trusnik, and Jacobs, then that leaves the 7th spot regardless of positional designation between Glanton and Mayo.  And honestly, I think with an extra NFL season under his belt, along with 4 games worth of experience including 2 playoff games, that Glanton wins that battle."
panthers,388t53,ThisDerpForSale,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:52:33 2015 UTC,Hmm yeah I can see that what about in place of Jacobs? Mayo is younger and can contribute on special teams about as much as Jacobs
panthers,388t53,young__sandwich,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:53:33 2015 UTC,Potentially.  It's really a crapshoot with the last couple guys on who makes it and who doesn't between now and September.  But Jacobs was the leading tackler on special teams last year in what really amounted to his first year of true playing time in the league.  So do you risk sending your best ST player from 2014 to the practice squad so that you can bring in an unproven rookie?  My bet is no.
panthers,388t53,young__sandwich,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:14:20 2015 UTC,The logic is sound but what if Gettleman thinks another team will pull Mayo off the practice squad? I agree its all a crap shoot especially before training camp but there has to be a reason he drafted Mayo instead of let him become a UDFA and then pick him up from there
panthers,388t53,young__sandwich,2,Tue Jun 2 21:08:05 2015 UTC,"Oh I completely agree.  I think he expects him to out-produce Glanton (remember Glanton is only 1 year removed from being a UDFA).  And he very well could.  I'm looking at it as if I were making a decision today as to who gets cut and who doesn't.  I know Glanton and Jacobs have proved that they can both produce at the NFL level.  I know nothing about how Mayo will produce, all I can base my opinion on is what I see in his college tape.  So maybe he beats out one of those two.  If I'm making the call, he needs another year or two to develop.  Then again, maybe it's a good thing I'm not making the call! :P"
panthers,388t53,Marstep,2,Tue Jun 2 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"what if Gettleman thinks another team will pull Mayo off the practice squad?   This was my worry.  I have no idea if Mayo is really worthy of being stolen off the practice squad, but anything is possible, and after the Tyler Gaffney  situation last year, I do wonder if the team will be a bit more wary."
panthers,388t53,Marstep,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:47:15 2015 UTC,"Mayo has a long way to go before even coming close to becoming an imposing physical threat in the league. Throw him on the practice squad for a year or two though and he may turn into an excellent use of a compensatory pick.   First, great job with these.  Love the detail, comparisons, and all the work you put into these.  The above statement though, I disagree with.  Gettleman doesn't draft to develop.  Undrafted, other teams draft picks (Hill) yes.  But he doesn't.  I'm betting Mayo makes the team."
panthers,388t53,Marstep,2,Tue Jun 2 18:49:16 2015 UTC,"You're right, he may make it.  At this point it's all assumptions and mine is based off the fact that I think the final LB slot will come down to either Mayo or Glanton.    I agree that Gettleman doesn't draft to develop.  However, he may have seen something in Mayo that he thought would benefit the team and if Mayo gets to training camp and can't live up to those expectations, he won't make the roster.    That's the way I look at it, at least.  I think that Glanton is a better player right NOW, but who knows if that changes in training camp or mid-way through the season or in 2016 or what.  It's just hard to guess which way the cookie will crumble."
