Enough with the downvoting.  It's ridiculous.  He/she posted a title that is appropriate, he/she is adhereing to the rules, we're playing the game.  We've moved on.  Enough.  Edit II:  Or keep downvoting.  Fuck it, I don't give a fuck.  I've got a mind of my own.  Just think what you're doing before you do it.  Internet points don't matter to me.  It's you who are giving into mass action.  Think before you act.  The choice is up to you."
GuessTheMovie,3dnihj,_enoughalready_,5,Fri Jul 17 19:30:29 2015 UTC,"If they don't matter, why do you keep flying off the rails in every thread I see you in, where you have negative votes?"
GuessTheMovie,3dnihj,sally-draper,4,Sun Jul 19 08:21:47 2015 UTC,"Because I was pissed at the time.  It was two three threads where I threw a conniption fit.  And then I typed the second edit.  I was pissed.  But then I thought, it doesn't matter.  Why does it matter?  It's whoever's downvoting me, that's their problem.  I honestly think the community can get past the incident that happened but if they continue to downvote, that's not going to help the situation.  I'm sure my hissy fit didn't either, but I was getting tired of it.  If ""enough"" wasn't a placid enough of a request, I was going to say how I felt.  I just thought the downvoting had gotten out of control.  I supported someone who the community didn't like or was upset at.  I agreed that the title was inappropriate but I was also under the impression that that was the problem.  I've been told various things.  I want to support this community but downvoting without proper discussion isn't going to get us anywhere.  But my hissy fit also wasn't proper discussion but at least I spoke up, said something towards what was happening.  I could've gone about it a better way, I admit that.  The fact that there wasn't a clear answer and mob downvoting was going on just pissed me off.  It still does but I'm trying to move on."
GuessTheMovie,3dnihj,kdk12k2k12,3,Sun Jul 19 08:41:41 2015 UTC,"I don't even know what incident you're referring to; I just noticed you shouting at people about downvotes and wanted to mention it... Fair enough, though.  Sometimes I worry that people forget Reddit is just a silly website. It's not real life."
GuessTheMovie,3dnihj,sally-draper,4,Sun Jul 19 08:47:51 2015 UTC,"I know what ""incident"" they are referring to, because I saw the thread(s).   At the time, I commented on the thread, to give my opinion. (which was: ""I'm surprised to see this thread being downvoted, OP just wrote a weird title. It contains ""strong language"" or whatever you want to call it. I personally just found it funny and I think the fact that OP and I are european may explain why there's a gap in the reactions: I believe he genuinely wrote this title to make us smile, he was absolutely not trying to be offensive to anyone, it probably didn't even crossed his mind that this could be seen as provocative. Just like me, he finds it weird seeing WORDS tagged with [NSFW] (but when he submits an image containing nudity, yes: he puts the [NSFW] tag).)   One or two people replied to me and OP, explaining their views. This was obvioulsy a good thing, although it didn't make me change my mind: ""Okay, I see that you didn't like his title, but I still believe massive downvoting him and removing his post is going a bit too far. Okay it's just a game on the internet, but I still feel like I had/have the right to express how this makes me feel.""  I wasn't sure I understood exactly what all the fuss was about: for me he just wrote one weird title, and the reactions it triggered made me think I was missing something, that OP had repeatedly acted this way, written several ""weird"" titles, been rude to other users. But: no, I couldn't find any evidence at all looking at his history.    So then, when he came back after being banned for a week, I was expecting to see downvotes. I had planned on not saying anything, because: - I thought it would just not help but accentuate the downvotes, - I thought it wasn't my place to speak, but OP's and the mods', - It was best to just ignore it and wait until this was forgotten. BUT people again didn't just downvote OP's perfectly okay title: they even downvoted a ""thank you"" comment and his clues. I stepped in again. I didn't talk again about what the previous ""incident"" was, I just said that downvoting someone who just submitted an image and replied to guesses was stupid, that maybe some people were doing it not even knowing why: nobody had commented to explain why they downvoted. Nobody replied to me either: they just downvoted me and the 2 or 3 other users who welcomed OP back.  THEN someone wrote in the thread that OP got banned for writing 3 titles that were deemed inappropriate by the mods. I messaged this person, asking what the two other titles were, because I had  missed them and it could change my views: maybe i was wrong all along, I didn't have all the info and this would finally make sense to me. This person didn't reply to my PM: I still don't know if these 2 other titles existed, if this person invented them (and got gilded for it, by someone who wanted to believe him/her, simply because it feels good to be angry at someone on the internet.)  In short: I agree with /u/kdk12k2k12. I too felt the need to show solidarity towards OP. To explain how I viewed things, and most important: to simply say that downvoting a player who has done his time but now submits images normally and allows us all to play is really immature (and frankly worse than what he did). I am aware it won't help much, rather make even more people downvote him for a longer time. But yeah, I'm still pissed as well. I just commented to explain why. That's I believe, a bit more useful than  downvoting all of someone's screenshots and comments because ""he didn't help creating a friendly atmosphere"" Oh the irony! I  don't believe stepping in that way is ""shouting at people"" or mentioning a past incident to purposefully worsen things: I was just trying to defend OP (and to see if someone would let me know I was missing important elements about ""the incident"": apparently not?)  (I'm replying in this thread. I should probably not do it, because -as we all agree- it's just best to forget about it. But, idk, sending you this via PM would make me feel like there's something ""wrong"" with me commenting on this, saying the things I say. I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong, I'm not contributing much but that's better than what some others did)."
GuessTheMovie,3dnihj,kdk12k2k12,5,Sun Jul 19 13:47:49 2015 UTC,"First off the posts that the other player was referring to DID exist, but have since been removed.  The OP has on NUMEROUS occasions made snide, condescending comments to players in many posts for no apparent reason other than to ""start something"". How you have not noticed or found them, I can not explain.  Please don't use the ""Everyone is entitled to say whatever they want"" reasoning. There is no reason for that kind of behavior in this or any other sub.  Here is but one of the more subdued incidences.  Please read all of the comments because you are trying to stop people from downvoting the OP when he vehemently supports downvoting others. I WILL NOT search for other incidences to prove my point.  There have been responses from the moderators throughout many posts kindly asking him to follow rule #1, to which he pulls the shrug-the-shoulders in wonder saying ""WHAT did I do???"" attitude. How does one as an adult deal with this kind of behavior in a place that used to be non-stop fun?  He is the typical school yard bully that targets and torments random people. When someone finally stands their ground with him, he plays the downtrodden victim. He does this quite well too! He has pulled a few of the players here into his little game. Sorry to say, you included, which proves to me you are probably a really great friend to have in the outside-of-Reddit-world.  It seems the more he is asked to be nice or tone it down, he childishly pushes a tiny bit further. May I add, he then plays the victim once again. This behavior has gotten old 3 miles back! All of this added up to the probable reason for the downvoting, not just the latest incident of tasteless titles. (YES, I said tasteless since you can not NSFW a title.) This opinion is on behalf of my young son who used to like trying to guess  the screencaptures here with me (without an account) just for fun. Yes, I did teach him to avoid the NSFW ones.  I have said my peace on this matter. Thank you for reading. Have a great day!"

GuessTheMovie,3cwtrs,umbro_tattoo,10,Sat Jul 11 13:42:25 2015 UTC,I've followed this subreddit for ~2 years and I got one ONCE. Apparently having seen Bio Dome 15+ times has value! (quiet sobbing)
GuessTheMovie,3cwtrs,DoubleAssCake,6,Sat Jul 11 22:04:32 2015 UTC,Luck plays a huge part. Mainly the ones I've got have been easy and I wouldn't have gotten them if I had posted five minutes later.  Your luck will change at some point.
GuessTheMovie,3cwtrs,MrCaul,6,Sat Jul 11 14:27:01 2015 UTC,"Yes. I've never submitted my own shot so my score is from guessing only. As /u/MrCaul said, it basically just comes down to luck. If you visit this subreddit often enough then you're eventually going to get a shot that you can't believe no one else knows. It's also about being here at the right time, I suppose."
GuessTheMovie,3cwtrs,MasturbatingMonk,3,Sat Jul 11 15:25:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that seems to be how it works."
GuessTheMovie,3cwtrs,MrCaul,3,Sat Jul 11 15:27:02 2015 UTC,Right here.  Timing and luck.    There have been dozens of shots I knew the answer to and it was already scooped up because I got here too late.

GuessTheMovie,3cwtrs,SteelyDan68,3,Sat Jul 11 20:23:16 2015 UTC,"Very rarely, but it's fun to try."
GuessTheMovie,3cwtrs,Sanlear,3,Sun Jul 12 01:02:28 2015 UTC,"There are some really tricky ones posted for sure. Most of my points have been gained from submitting shots. The few guesses I have gotten right first have been either me being super lucky and knowing the film really really well, or taking a lot of time to work through the clues and search the IMDB/google etc using the clues to narrow it down. Its really hard to do the latter with the submissions that don't give clues, but I find it fun and challenging to work them out that way.     I gotta say though, that more often than not I don't even know the posts marked EASY. I guess EASY is subjective!"
GuessTheMovie,3cwtrs,starfleetbrat,3,Sun Jul 12 07:46:45 2015 UTC,"I was frustrated at first too. (Realised I wasn't exactly a cinephile, compared to the regular players here). After a while, I got used to guessing only once in a while.  But I would also recommend to read the threads, because at first I would read the clues, but not really properly/seriously, and not all the time: I would very often think ""Nope, haven't seen this, never gonna guess it-> X"". Actually, a big clue given in the comments is frequently helpful to identify a film. But of course that's only possible if you have the time to regularly check the updates."
GuessTheMovie,3cwtrs,sally-draper,2,Sat Jul 11 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"A big way I found to help me is this; If you keep a bookmarks bar or bookmarked pages, I keep one of reddit.com/r/GuessTheMovie/new/ or unsolved, so that unsolved screenshots are just a click away. That way when I'm browsing the internet, I find myself visiting the sub more often and getting more chances to guess.   Just a little shortcut that helped me out, may work for others too.  Example"

Not swedish. Not Thai. Not Greek.  More recent than 1991. Released in the 2010s.  Longer than 118 minutes.  Not a horror, adventure, family film.  IMDB ratings close to the ones of ""La Grande Bellezza"". (By that I mean: close to the overall rating of ""7,7"" and also close to the metascore rating of ""86/100""). More user votes than 7 650.

GuessTheMovie,3bzn7k,ocean365,3,Fri Jul 3 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"Wow.  Shit is going down in here.  Don't let it go dark, Harry.  Please God no.  This is my last bastion, aside from annoying my friends with an influx of pm's.  I get a little sting when a shot remains unsolved.  A lot of effort goes into submitting these shots and it does kinda seem like a waste to just let it go by.  But then again, if a shot is provided, a clear, telling shot and no one gets it, that is and/or can be a great submission.  As a guesser, I desperately want to know what the answer is, but not before someone has guessed it.  And I'll admit, it does drive me crazy when someone guesses and the submitter replies ""no.""  Especially when there are 20+ guesses.  But that's just not the way I particularly like to play.  The way I play sometimes, I think I give too much away.  But that stems from my not wanting the shot to go unidentified.    This is a place to relax and I enjoy it immensely.  I actually like when people make posts like this.  It encourages users to try to identify shots that have been pushed back.  If people took the time to submit, I would think they would still want the shot to be identified.  I don't know.    I appreciate both /u/HarryEllis and /u/heavenlyyaksha's contribution to this sub.

GuessTheMovie,39bzle,BlackJackBob,15,Wed Jun 10 19:07:54 2015 UTC,"As a guesser, I agree with your sentiment sometimes. But I don't begrudge someone for taking the time to make a shot, check GIS, pay attention to guesses and either post more clues or follow up with more screenshots. It's a bit of a process sometimes.  It's also a fine line between posting what you might think is a great (difficult to identify) shot and someone guessing it in the first five minutes.  More often than not, a less than ideal shot is followed later by another shot or clues. As a guesser, my personal preference is more screenshots because this sub is dedicated to the theme of guessing the name of a movie based on a screenshot, but clues work too!   I feel you though."
GuessTheMovie,39bzle,HarryEllis,3,Wed Jun 10 19:18:13 2015 UTC,It's just good fun.
GuessTheMovie,39bzle,MrCaul,3,Wed Jun 10 22:34:47 2015 UTC,"Three points, firstly, the ones where there are lots of films it could be are fun, and spark lots of good guesses.  HD un-doctored screenshots of most movies will come up on Google image search, so a little crop or resize that is negligible to the eye can prevent Google from recognising it.  Finally I don't think there is really a problem on here with shots not being eventually identified."
GuessTheMovie,39bzle,mynameisfreddit,2,Thu Jun 11 16:00:56 2015 UTC,"Welcome to /r/GuessTheMovie, where there is one rule ""be nice""."
GuessTheMovie,39bzle,heavenlyyaksha,2,Wed Jun 10 19:24:29 2015 UTC,"Amen to that.  As I posted many moons ago, this subreddit is typically my first stop on reddit.  Make my guesses; appreciate the normally fast feedback and then it's off to a few other subreddit.  While I'm here, it's the exception where a submitter or a guesser will get overheated.  The reason for that is that the game played here is fun and your guess is as good as the next guesser."
GuessTheMovie,39bzle,FowelBallz,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:29:57 2015 UTC,It's a reasonable suggestion. And it doesn't have to be a hard-line either. Maybe adding a label or something would be enough.

GuessTheMovie,396guh,mryananderson,5,Tue Jun 9 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"Haha thank you thank you very much.  This movie was one of my favorites growing up, and I think it was the combination of the dog, and remembering them watching The Price is Right when they were waiting for David to come home.  So it's not really that exact frame I remember, but it is just you remember certain facts about something and can remember a scene they may have been in."

I have noticed you give 1 point for an easy correct guess and others give 6.  You have many submissions that have not been guessed yet and my next question is why don't you add another picture to help them along?  Like I said I'm new and trying to figure this game out."

I am mother fucking 100% sure it's that movie after seeing the second screenshot, the scene is when the Italian's brother is running and he's timing him or when the Italian's is already in the army and his friend's timing him.  The Italian also looks up girls skirts and drinks alcohol and smokes fags when he's like 10 because he's metal as fuck.  Is that the movie?

It's more fun for me to dole out clues over a couple hours than to have someone get it within 10 minutes, so I gravitated toward lesser-known (at least at the present time) movies.  Maybe there's a difference in opinion as to what is the right way to GTM.  I think some people want to be able to ID it using only the image, while others enjoy chasing down a laundry list of clues in the comments.  I'm in the latter camp.  But the lack of rules in this sub means that people can do either.  That lack of rules is one of the things I love about this sub, so I'd hope we don't restrict the pool of movies we can post."
GuessTheMovie,35y3ys,doucement_doucement,7,Thu May 14 15:35:59 2015 UTC,"To be clear, I'm not necessarily proposing a change to this sub. I've seen most of the posts here get identified so there are at least a group of people who have seen these films.  I'm only seeing if there's other people like me that thought they could participate here, but cannot because they haven't seen the vast majority of the movies posted here. You said you can ID a movie based on clues without seeing it once...I think that may be a rare skill.  In other words, should there be another sub for more well-known films?"
GuessTheMovie,35y3ys,Svviftie,7,Thu May 14 15:43:07 2015 UTC,"I was motivated to post pics a couple years ago when I thought there was a lack of b&w movies (the only ones I have any chance of guessing!). I think you should share the movies you enjoy. As for guessing, you don't have to be sure to make a guess, if the shot reminds you of a movie, even vaguely, your guess may earn a clue and help narrow it down for everybody. See it as a team effort!"
GuessTheMovie,35y3ys,roger_,5,Thu May 14 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"I've never been able to guess a movie, but I just assumed I wasn't good enough ;_;  This is affecting the movies I wanna post, since I'm afraid of doing something too easy. The people here seem to have a Rain Man-level of movie knowledge."
GuessTheMovie,35y3ys,aur0ra145,3,Fri May 15 00:14:25 2015 UTC,"since I'm afraid of doing something too easy   Don't be! And remember we have an ""easy"" tag for shots that might be considered easy."
GuessTheMovie,35y3ys,HarryEllis,6,Fri May 15 06:44:05 2015 UTC,"I've been here for several months now.  I think I might have gotten only one right so far (and in time.)  They have lots of recognizable movies, they just don't last all that long.  I'll have to start posting..."
GuessTheMovie,35y3ys,Kmlkmljkl,7,Fri May 15 15:29:32 2015 UTC,Post some shots from some of your favorite movies!
GuessTheMovie,35y3ys,andycooktellem,1 point,Thu May 14 15:15:20 2015 UTC,"I did that a whille ago, and it turned out to be pretty difficult.  Someone guessed the movie only after I gave out a bunch of hints."
GuessTheMovie,35y3ys,natelyswhore22,2,Thu May 14 19:29:45 2015 UTC,"No - the difficulty is key, no one wants to see posts getting solved within 5 minutes everytime... makes getting one feel that much sweeter"
GuessTheMovie,35y3ys,slickezt,5,Thu May 14 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"I agree that usually shots from well-known movies are guessed within a few minutes, which is not fun for both the poster and the guessers. I think the ""easy"" tag is a good idea to include new users, but I think maybe that would be the only way to accomplish what you want in this specific sub, to have the ""easy"" tag have those parameters (must be from a film which has grossed so much or so on). Right now I think the ""easy"" tag is just if it is on Google Images."
