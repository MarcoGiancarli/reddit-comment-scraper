Being objectified by government employees in a public setting, while those government employees are performing their civil servant functions, is the new normal.    Americans now expect to objectified by other Americans who are also government employees in a public setting, when they refer to Americans as objects, in this case, ""windows"", because it is not in their workplace, government employees state that objectifying the public as ""windows"" or ""potential windows that could break at any given time"" is protected by free speech.  I would argue that the public setting IS the workplace of those government employees while they are being paid to perform their civil servant functions.    Your thoughts on the science of this?     Why was there an effort to dehumanize the American public over the past 33 years via objectification by government employees, what economic advantage did that give America over other countries?   What advantage did broken windows objectification give a certain class or race of Americans over another certain class or race of Americans?   What could have been done differently not to divert policing efforts primarily against the lower class and away from what was perceived as the non-broken or able to be broken upper class?   Has the upper class thrived by being free of objectification by government employees for 33 years, in what ways has the upper class thrived by being free of objectification by government employees for 33 years? What law allows government employees to refer to the general public as potential objects while being paid to perform their chosen civil servant function?   Should objectification of the American public by government employees while being paid to perform their civil servant function be illegal? What could the criminal penalty be for a government employee who objectifies a person or persons, via word, action or participation in obedience/objectification training, while being paid to perform their chosen civil servant function?   Did an atmosphere of objectifying the lower and middle class lead to oversight, and specifically the oversight of upper class corruption? (Bernie Madoff, ponzi schemes, housing debacle, 9/11/01)   All great questions which will help the American people examine the causes of why they have lost their rights, economy and atmosphere of freedom, replaced by no rights, no real economy other than for the upper class, and an atmosphere of freedom for the upper class by way of brutality, obedience and objectification, similar to how bliss is not really happiness.  Over time capitalism gives way to oligarchy as the lower and middle class submit to the learned trait of objectification, after 33 years of broken window, Americans can now understand that the andedote for their oligarchy is to understand how they have themselves mentally and physically submitted to objectification.

The six-continent combined-America model is used in Spanish-speaking countries  and in some parts of Europe, including Greece (equivalent 5 inhabited continents model – i.e. excluding Antarctica – still also found in texts).

This land was apart of British America not New Spain or Portuguese Brazil which is why most of the western hemisphere calls us America not the United States. The United States of America was also the first fully independent nation in the western hemisphere causing other nations especially in Europe to refer to the United States as simply America. This includes Great Britain.  2) The United States is not the only nation that used the words ""united states"" in its official name.

(And of course, the sporting aspect of it.)  It's also meant to be a safeguard against government, though at this point that's not such a reality any more considering how well armed our military is."

usa,3ck1p7,4514N_DUD3,3,Thu Jul 9 15:27:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty easy once you get to know US history a bit and the things that haven't changed.  In most countries the government, either local or national, provides the security and safety for its citizens.  In the US, that is not always possible since culture and simple topography makes it impossible to guarantee even an acceptable amount. So people need to fend for themselves and that's just the way most yanks like it. A  gun is important in this. As a European this is bizar. Too much can go wrong with guns in everyone's hands. But in the US that is part of the citizens responsibility. Sure, shit happens but that is always better than the alternative. Having a more government everywhere,  all the time.   Does this ring true for some of you?"
usa,3ck1p7,acidburnz_EU,3,Wed Jul 8 19:13:15 2015 UTC,First is tradition. We Americans have a long tradition of gun ownership that is protected by the US Constitution. In truth gun ownership dates back to the founding of the English colonies. There was no British Army to protect settlers in those times. In truth the presences of the British Army in Colonial America was always sub par. People seem to forget that the British had more of a military presence in Canada than it did in what would become the United States. So what happen was the average American knew that they could not trust the government at that time to protect them from attack. After the Revolution hunting was used to feed families on the frontiers at the same time guns were used by the civilian population for protection. Citizen soldiers is another tradition in the United States. This dates back also to the English colonies. The only real force in these times was the citizen militia. The colonial governments didn't provide them with military weapons they brought their own into the militia in times of war. This continued right up to the US Civil War for the United States however the Confederate States still had to use this outdated form of fighting wars.   Remembered history is one that I think plays its part today. On a individual level the average citizen used guns to feed their families and protect them. I personally remember my Grandfather telling stories of his youth of having to go out in the woods to hunt for food to feed his family each night during the Great Depression. Keep in mind this was only like 60 some odd years ago. He wanted his children to know how to weather a storm like the Great Depression so he passed on his knowledge and respect for gun ownership to my father which passed it down to me and my sidling. I think this plays into a factor especially in rural areas of the United States.  Governmental mistrust is another important factor in pro-gun people. I'm not talking about some nuts out in Idaho plotting to overthrow the US government. I'm talking about the ineffectiveness of the US and State governments to protect Americans from crimes. There has always been a natural mistrust of government by the American people. Some forget that this country is a revolutionary nation. You combine that with the tradition of lawlessness in non metropolitan communities and you can start to see where some people come from on this issue. There is also a mistrust of the police to protect people from attack.     For me personally. I do not own a gun. I am however pro-gun. I believe in the most extreme protections of the US Constitution. I personally believe that the US Constitution protects the gun ownership of any US citizen. I fear any restrictions on any part of the US constitution can be used to restrict personal liberties of any of the other rights protected by the US Constitution. I'm a Libertarian Republican. I must disclose this to you so you can personally judge my statements are fact or bias propaganda.   Furthermore as a Historian by profession I must commend you on the way your going about your project. Today most students would sprout off propaganda without going out and researching the topic for themselves. You are doing it the right way. I wish my students would go and do personal research instead of giving me the same old tired stance on any particular subject. I like students that formulate their own opinion even if it is different than mine.

But something else you may want to consider is the person who owns one, maybe two, guns and is a hunter. There are a lot of people in my area (rural Virginia) who hunt deer with these guns and for many, the meat from those deer is their dinner, their livelihood.   Personally, I'm very anti gun. The only issue I see with completely outlawing firearms (like Australia) is the people who use their gun to feed their families.   Additionally I should say that I believe this person to be the minority in the Pro-Gun camp. However, they are a very important minority."

In my life, I don't feel unsafe in my neighbourhood or feel the need to fear for my life if someone breaks in, but how can someone in the United States, living under the same circumstances, come to the conclusion that one is necessary?  My stance is that my Xbox and cash can be replaced with my insurance, while a human life - even one of a criminal - can't be replaced.

Then why own an xbox, it's not necessary to your means of survival - it doesn't bring you income.    Just like gamers, gun owners can enjoy guns casually in both hunting, sport or just shooting occasionally.   Guns are powerful tools that need respect, not fear.  Americans like their guns because the country was built on them.... and to take them away is like saying the government doesn't respect citizens enough to trust them"

Chicago and New York still have criminals with access to firearms, even if the law abiding doesn't, do the laws do FA to stop firearm homicide. It's not worth doing that this point, and doing so may be harmful to the population.  And I don't want to hear any of those ""Wild West, blood in the street"" arguments. Places that loosened restrictions of guns did not see any increase in homicide rates, and the overall crime rates in the US have been plummeting since the mid-90's."

And, even where guns are outlawed, criminals will still obtain them, so protection is still necessary.  It is absurd to expect police to be at the right place at the right time to protect you when needed.  The other reason is for people to protect themselves from Government itself. The US was born in revolution, and it remains in our culture to retain the means to resist gov't overreaching."

North America is not nearly as tame as many people in urban and suburban environments believe.  link1 link2 link3 link4 link5  96% of the land in the United States is rural, link but only 19% of the population lives there link  Just 2 percent of the population is responsible for producing food for the rest of us. link  The problem is that for those living in rural areas, emergency response times are much higher if they are available at all. It can take an hour or more for an ambulance or police to arrive.  Civilization has also introduced several dangerous invasive species like wild dogs and wild pigs. These animals can and do attack humans, and farm animals. They can also destroy crops.  In some cases we need to hunt for food. In others it's necessary to defend ourselves and our property from wild animals.  It is a much ignored fact that access to a firearm is a necessary part of modern agriculture.  Many will argue the point, and often they will point to places like the UK as having banned guns, but the truth is that Britain actually subsidizes shotgun licenses for farmers. link  In short, the food in your grocery store comes from a farm, and the people who work on that farm are able to do so in part because they have access to firearms. Even in places like Canada."

usa,3ck1p7,USAFoodTruck,0,Thu Jul 9 17:05:40 2015 UTC,"The most important thing to understand is that the laws aren't a matter of right or wrong, or what's best for the country. Please note, I'm NOT saying gun ownership is right or wrong, or making any argument as to what's best for the country. I'm establishing that those things don't actually matter. What matters is the political impossibility of changing the laws. There is a very large population in the U.S. that values gun ownership, large enough to swing any election for an official who advocates for strict gun control. On-top of that, the National Rifle Association (NRA) advocates against gun control and they are, by far, the most powerful lobbying entity in the country. Technically, AARP has more members and money, but AARP has to split their attention among many many issues. The NRA is singularly focused on gun ownership, so they can channel more money and voters into the issue than any other lobbying organization can muster for any other issue, and it's not even close.  So when people talk about how USA should enforce strict gun control, they're making pointless arguments. It makes as much sense to make that argument as it does to argue that every American should stop committing crime so we can do away with police. Both arguments are equally impossible.  TL:DR Version: Arguing for strict gun control is pointless because it's politically impossible to make any drastic change to gun laws."
