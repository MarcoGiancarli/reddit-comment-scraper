I've played against both and I never thought that I lost to them because of cheating. It's usually because I can never hit them because they're slippery motherfuckers with strong fundamentals, not packet loss or speedhacks. That said, the packet loss exploit has been patched out in patch 40, so even if Raw Boner had been using it in competitive play before then, it wouldn't matter whatsoever in this upcoming tournament since it's literally impossible for him to use it now.  Anyways, I'm looking forward to Raw stomping everyone like normal and putting these silly, unsubstantiated rumors to rest"

ChivalryGame,3e4de0,CuddlyNeedle,0,Wed Jul 22 00:11:20 2015 UTC,That's not a fair reason at all. They make alt accounts to go trolling and slandering people's names and are too cowardly to show who they are. Read Simons response to my comment.
ChivalryGame,3e4de0,Anstii,4,Wed Jul 22 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"We should be willing to deal with trolls on the off chance that this is legit (granted we shouldn't take this post too seriously because there is no evidence), and I do know that there has been spam on this subreddit about cheating. I read Exile's and it was a copy of yours."
ChivalryGame,3e4de0,CuddlyNeedle,3,Wed Jul 22 00:45:13 2015 UTC,"That's a completely fair reason, I accused someone once and I'm still getting circlejerked to death. Anytime I post on this subreddit I just get a shitton of random downvotes from big circlejerks.  Chiv community has big circlejerks in a tiny community so as long as you have an unpopular opinion, voicing it pretty much falls on deaf ears."
ChivalryGame,3e4de0,Koiuki,2,Wed Jul 22 01:47:34 2015 UTC,"Because they're a coward, Anstii. That's why. They are completely afraid to speak their mind publicly, potentially afraid to speak it privately, and instead seek to feel like a bigger person by anonymously posting two-faced slander on the internet about people they probably act cool with in game."
ChivalryGame,3e4de0,ExileTheWolf,4,Tue Jul 21 22:49:37 2015 UTC,"It takes no courage to accuse someone of hacking when you have an entire clan to back you up. This guy probably does not have that, so I can't blame him for wanting to maintain whatever 'working' relationship he has with the best players in the game.  I can only imagine what a bitch it would be to practice vs garbage players because you've been blacklisted for completely valid suspicions in a game with no anti-cheat system whatsoever. I don't think boner or curly are hackers."
ChivalryGame,3e4de0,Peasant420,5,Tue Jul 21 23:44:06 2015 UTC,"Speaking your mind on something like this could ruin your reputation and cause you to get ridiculed. With le reddit circlejerk you could easily end up like KOI 2.0  Not like OP is trying to troll really anyways. He makes a solid point, calling to reason an issue that ruined the last tourney like this that happened."
ChivalryGame,3e4de0,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,4,Wed Jul 22 01:10:04 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, though I think reputations are ruined more by having unpopular opinions than by speaking your mind.  If the community wants to ban bigs, they are obligated to also ban everyone else that is accused of hacking with no evidence. The tourny should just give the money to charity again, problem solved.  This whole ""cash prize"" situation seems like a weak attempt at validating the Chiv community's video-game addiction, which is pathetic for a game without the proper infrastructure to have a competitive environment. Every clan would play for fun anyway, so I don't see the point of complicating things with money."
ChivalryGame,3e4de0,Peasant420,2,Wed Jul 22 01:34:19 2015 UTC,"Speaking your mind has ALWAYS been a double-edged blade though. You might ruffle feathers, but you might get your point heard, particularly by those who know who you are. His point is undermined by posting anonymously, thereby giving absolutely no weight to his argument. In addition, the opening two statements of the post don't just beg the question of if Bigs, Curly and Boner are cheating, but outright implicate them as cheaters. I'd say that's inflammatory enough to be considered trollish.  C'mon kids, have some nuts and don't internet the fuck out of everything in life. Build some character, stand by your words."
ChivalryGame,3e4de0,ExileTheWolf,4,Wed Jul 22 01:21:30 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your concern for OP's character, however some people simply don't want to get ridiculed, and like I said, he makes a fair point and doesn't need to have a name behind it for it not to carry weight. Nobody wants to get shit on by le reddit circlejerk, including myself, so might as well be anonymous.   I'd say that's inflammatory enough to be considered trollish.   Troll raises fair question though. Don't think being ""inflammatory""  necessarily makes you a troll."

I like Waters, so I sincerely hope he is NOT the OP. However, his opening statement of ""I appreciate your concern for OP's character"" set off an alarm, as well as a few other things in his post, so I felt compelled to ask for the sake of allowing him or whoever it may be to just come clean and earn respect for gumption.  Alternatively, my preferred means for people to air grievances, is to NOT make a public spectacle about it and contact one of the tournament hosts directly.

ChivalryGame,3e2wlr,Xx360aa,0,Tue Jul 21 18:08:11 2015 UTC,Last man standing duels are a solution to the problem that TBS can't fix and that you filthy clannie scum love reinforcing: unbalanced teams.  Completely dominating another team 7-0 is fun for about 5 minutes until the losing team quits and the server dies.  Last man duels gives the losing team a chance to get some wins in and lets the lower ranks have some fun by watching their champion take down one dude after another.
ChivalryGame,3e2wlr,Reithur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"While you are right about clannies stacking a side and making it annoying, you are wrong about the last man standing duels as a solution.  It gives the other team/players the incentive to stop trying in the team fights (it is last team standing afterall not last man standing) knowing that it will eventually come up to a duel.  In addition to that, it creates a trolly atmosphere where like a top player from the losing team will start hiding instead of playing with his team so he can get to duel and gets to show off his skill since everybody is watching him thus boosting his precious ego (This happens 95% of the time).   At times, players from the winning team would stop killing the top player from the losing team because they know he wants to duel. Thus the whole essence of a last team standing game mode is lost.  So this actually worsens the LTS  atmosphere and is one of the key reasons as to why LTS has mostly become more of a circlejerk fest . Moreover, it deters good players from coming and sticking around and it starts attracting the trolls.  The solution is simple but hard, just not be a dick and balance the teams. If more people bind together during the game and try to enforce this, I'm sure people will listen."
ChivalryGame,3e2wlr,bi11y10,4,Wed Jul 22 02:27:08 2015 UTC,"Competitive play is the closest to regular tactical usage, but these are usually small matches; 6v6 Team Objectives, winner goes to best progress on the same map.  There are occasionally large matches arranged in North America (again, mostly competitive players) as special events where special game types are made up for the event; a battle with matched units & ranks hasn't been tried to my knowledge.

I have seen at least 30+ PUGS fall through because people stopped caring halfway through. Many of those were hosted by the unborn himself.  Since it's just a giant cluster fuck and 90% of the time one team is stacked beyond fixing large scale battles or PUGS always devolve into nonsense."

We've always kicked people in the past who were fucking around to keep it fun for everyone else.

ChivalryGame,3e2wlr,Reithur,4,Tue Jul 21 17:08:42 2015 UTC,"I've got almost a thousand hours and play in comp and still get rekt pretty fast!  You can try to mitigate this by spending some time in duel servers; look for FFA matches running on a map called Duelyard.  You'll get destroyed, but you'll learn faster by playing against better players and asking questions.  Keep a polite attitude and bow to challenge someone; make sure they bow back to show they accept, then give them a couple seconds before starting the fight.  I suggest trying to fight (or just watch!) someone who is using your preferred class and weapon; you can see how they use it and ask them specific questions."
ChivalryGame,3e2wlr,blimpkin,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"I jut discovered duelyard! I love it, my biggest problem is the rainbow move, I just can't keep track of my opponent when I do it"
ChivalryGame,3e2wlr,HELPMEIMGONADIE,3,Tue Jul 21 19:13:36 2015 UTC,"Practice practice practice!  You'll get the hang of it with time.  Widen your FOV a bit to help you see more; most competitive players prefer 110-130.  Open your console with the tilde key [`] and type fov 130 or whichever FOV you wish to try.  You may want to increment it a little at a time and play for a bit to get used to the view, though; fishbowl distortion can play with your perception of distance.  I'm assuming that you actually mean Reverse Overheads.  They're handy if you use them occasionally, but don't try to do them all the time or your opponent will expect it and punish you for it.  Here's where things get convoluted and likely to trigger some dispute;  From what I've heard, a Rainbow is when you arch a slash over the opponent's head and drag it back into them from the other side, similar to a Waterfall, but you're not aiming for their feet.  Kindof like a Z-stab, but with a slash attack.  This requires a slow weapon to use, like a messer, zwei, or maul.  I don't really use these weapons, so I'm not very familiar with this kind of attack."

ChivalryGame,3dx0kk,Reithur,2,Mon Jul 20 13:02:29 2015 UTC,"I use the logitech G600 (MMO mouse, I know) and it is by far the best mouse I've ever owned. Very reasonable price point, fuckloads of programmable mouse buttons, on the fly DPI adjustment, and more. It also has third mouse button which shifts the binds on all your other buttons essentially allowing 2x the amount of bind mapping. Function-wise, it's hard to beat. It looks nice (cool flashy lights) feels even better in your hand than the deathadder IMO and is well-built (doesn't have cord issues the 400 series had). I've had mine for over a year and it's still like new. Highly reccomend."
ChivalryGame,3dx0kk,ACobb,2,Mon Jul 20 11:59:21 2015 UTC,Best mouse I've ever had.  I feel like a god damned caveman when I use a mouse without all the thumb buttons.
ChivalryGame,3dx0kk,Jonks,3,Mon Jul 20 19:01:59 2015 UTC,"I recently just purchased the Logitech g502 for like $65. I will say it's very comfortable and LOTS of settings within the driver software. I think it can go up to like 8000 DPI, which I find a little unnecessary as 2500 is all I need. The only thing I found a bit annoying was extra m4 m5 and m6 buttons that you can reprogram to any macro you want. I don't ever use these honestly. I'm so used to just holding alt+swing rather than pressing a single button for alt swings. But I can very well see this being extremely useful for some people.   I think the m6 button next to the thumb can get in the way sometimes if I'm in tense situations, so I just bound it to a taunt lol. The other ones I just turned off in case I accidentally press them or something. But it's a great mouse imo. 2 blue LED lights and you can customize the lighting a bit (brightness, blinking pattern, etc).   Check it out.   Logitech G502 Proteus Core Tunable Gaming Mouse with Fully Customizable Surface, Weight and Balance Tuning (910-004074) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IRHE892/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_aKqRvbP3BXXSW  EDIT: oh yeah, forgot you can also change out different weights if you want, which I thought was kinda cool, but I honestly didn't notice a huge difference between all of the weights in and all of them out.. So idk   EDIT 2: another thing, after about two weeks of usage, I notice that the scroll wheel is a little weak for me. You can lock it and unlock it ( so that when you unlock it, the scroll is on a free axel) however despite it being a little weak when locked, I haven't noticed any problem at all in game with it. It's just a little less satisfying to scroll is all :P may not bother you at all and in fact might suit some people better. Idk everyone is different."

This is the corsair outlet so you can get one as low as 30 bucks refurb (they're about 65 brand new).  Pros:  Tons of buttons on the side, very intuitive in placement you don't find yourself struggling to find a button. They are all offset nicely so that you can hit the ones you want without looking. I have cases where i bind multiple ones to the same thing so that i have more of an attack surface so to speak.  Fully programmable, macro-able, and very High DPI that you can also set 3 settings for wherever you like.  Nice rigid scrollwheel. Nothing i hate more than a god damn loose scroll wheel, this one is responsive and doesn't fly all over the place loosely and feels very solid and is nice and wide.  Looks cool, white is nice - i haven't seen the black one in person but it looks nice in videos.  Nice braided cord, plenty of length and durable.  Steel bottom for smooth surface use and nice weight to the mouse overall. I'd still use a mousepad cuz... you should.  Very nice laser/tracking  Cons:  I don't really have any, the surface of the mouse is a bit slippery, not that you'll lose grip or anything but it may have a tendency to get a bit dirty at times. Easy to clean though with a quick wipedown. I have a white one and it still looks brand new."

I've suffered though a Steelseries Sensei RAW as well as a Corsair M65 and they were not as consistent as I would like for Chivalry. They were pretty good for other games, but in Chivalry the tracers are extremely sensitive on your mouse input and some weird accelerations took place no matter which surface or ingame sensitivity I used. I must have played 1500-1800 hs with those mice and in the end, I wouldn't use them for any other melee game.  They were more consistent at 8-14 ingame sensibility but when compared to my current mouse (Logitech G400s), I'll just say there's no way to beat an optical, specially when it comes to twitch actions, like correcting your parry for a hidden stab riposte or defending overdragged slashes (Zwei for example).  The additional buttons are pretty slick, and the sensibility selector is pretty cool when I'm switching from the maul to some 1h weapon or a dagger too."

ChivalryGame,3du9jc,Zexis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:47:52 2015 UTC,"It's the time they waste and projectile-soaking that makes them powerful.  When a TO match is timed, having to take an extra 5-15 seconds to deal with one opponent is a huge detriment to you and your team's progress.  Passive immunity to arrows improves survivability greatly; going into a fight with full health rather than <50% or dead mean's you're able to contribute to the team's progress instead of waiting for respawn or health regen.  The sped up attacks mentioned are a secondary benefit, but welcome (for the shield user) and are similar to using Alt attacks; slightly slower windup, but release is faster."

ChivalryGame,3dvg20,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:03 2015 UTC,"I was one of them, my fps and overall performance in game was shit after every patch for at least like a week. FPS counters don't lie man, when you generally perform at 120 fps, and then drop to 30 (yes, after checking video settings and changing accordingly)... that's not a placebo. The servers most likely go to shit after an update and settle down after a while. I can certainly tell (or just look at the numbers) when my performance seems shit. Then after a couple weeks it typically went away. However, that is not the definition of a placebo effect. Placebo's are not when things actually go wrong and you can see it, and then go away after a period of time - that's not what that means."

Also, not everyone's hardware setup is the same, you may not experience the same issue others do. I've streamed plenty of times, shown my settings, and had shit ass performance after patches. When my eyes and others eyes can see that shit, it's not a fucking placebo.  The end.  And i'm not even talking about currently right now, after the latest patch I haven't had any issues. I actually haven't had issues for probably a while except certain maps being bad."

Feel free to ask for info or advice here!  We've had several tournaments since New Years and there's a huge tourney coming up in a couple weeks, but I believe the brackets are full at the moment."
ChivalryGame,3dqynz,Reithur,3,Sat Jul 18 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"This sounds interesting. Are you speaking of a less serious clan, as in a group of people to play together and fuck around with, or are you looking to form a comp team?  The vibe I'm getting is you want to somewhat emulate the code of honor that knights used in real life but still retain regular clan elements for gameplay's sake.  I could see something like this working if the members were actually into it and not trolls/rage-prone/etc. I would be all for a ranking system and storming dankforest with my brothers in arms at the lead of glorious commander or dueling each other for brag rags or titles. Sounds dope as fuck but we need more information."

ChivalryGame,3dnm2h,Jared39,8,Sat Jul 18 14:09:15 2015 UTC,Vote kick abuse is the main reason I say TBS should instate more admins.
ChivalryGame,3dnm2h,ToLazy4Name,9,Fri Jul 17 19:46:34 2015 UTC,"Too many admins can be a bad thing since it makes them harder to regulate. To fix this there must be a peer-reviewing system to make sure that admins don't abuse their responsibilities. Too many admins can be a bad thing since it makes them harder to regulate. Nobody wants to see another PDK or any of dat shizz.   An easier and less time extreme way would be to simply rework the vote kick system. Back in the day before the UI patch it was much more difficult to kick somebody -- you would have to either go into the console or do it from the scoreboard which is kinda tricky and not too many people knew how to do it. In a way it actually made there much less vote abuse, since sale noobs usually tended to be the vote spammers from my experience and they didn't know how to votekick lol.   But the best way would be to model the votekick system similar to that of Insurgency. What they do is have people go into the the options menu, and have a few people attempt to initiate a votekick against a player before an actual vote goes out. This way you don't see people spamming votes for anything, but especially for votekicks. I think Knifelegs went into detail about this a while ago, and it seems like the most efficient and least annoying option that I have seen to date, atleast for me.   I know how you feel though OP, dem Lance Hardy's"
ChivalryGame,3dnm2h,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,3,Fri Jul 17 20:25:30 2015 UTC,I agree with your sentiments.  A ban-happy admin is a lot worse than a group of people temporarily kicking people from the server. There definitely should be more checks in place to stop this sort of abuse.
ChivalryGame,3dnm2h,Albatrossing,-6,Fri Jul 17 21:36:00 2015 UTC,"There is no ban happy admins, no one has submitted more than a couple honestly"

ChivalryGame,3dnm2h,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Sat Jul 18 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"The big one cited a lot is that the guy doesn't ban equally. Everyone on pubs tks, but he'll only ban people he dislikes. Everyone else is off the hook. I think Lapu even had some evidence of that in a twitch vod, but like I said, this shit just gets ignored; hopefully not because someone doesnt want to sack up and admit they picked a bad admin. Some forum mod probably sees a big wall of text, doesn't want to read the whole thing, and nothing becomes of it. Or someone posts something here and it gets immediately deleted lol."
ChivalryGame,3dnm2h,BioshockEndingD00D,-1,Sat Jul 18 04:02:00 2015 UTC,"It got deleted because of a new rule that the community decided on. If I'm missing some info, please provide it to me.

It's still so difficult to not think about death. I broke up with my girlfriend of 10 months because she lived two hours away, and I could very rarely see her or even talk to her. We grew so distant. Chivalry still is my main coping strategy and it helps a lot to take my mind off of things. I haven't been doing a lot of comp because of my new girlfriend who I can talk to 24/7. She makes me so happy, however I am still not completely over my ex. Also I got glasses. A while ago I asked a friend what her version of heaven would be, she said, ""alone and out in nature."" She asked me the same question back and I broke down. I said, ""In my room, with my ex."" That of course has changed thanks to my current situation with my new girlfriend but I thought I should bring that up as it was significant to me. Thank you for listening.

Learning how to properly parry   Understanding that when parrying, facing the direction where the attacks comes from is the first concept all noobs should learn.   Play in first person as much as possible   MUCH easier to parry attacks, you can always alter your fov if you think its too narow.   Learning how to minimize  team damage    Pretty self explanatory   Don't get discouraged if you get absolutely destroyed    It usually takes several hundreds of hours before mastering the mechanics of the games. I would suggest for new players to avoid low ranks servers, they wont learn much, and it will be harder to adapt when they join the regular servers."

What I think happened(based on my experience) is that TB implemented a big chunk of UGC,got it all ready and when the patch came out they accidentally released a lot of stuff that was no suppose to be released. I made a set called the Winter Soldier Set that was not supposed to go live this patch? But on patch day they released it, and I wrote to TB to ask if it was an accident or on purpose. They pulled my set and a few others stuff. So the stuff that was not on the patch 40 notes must have all been taken off ."
ChivalryGame,3dmg4t,Oilystool,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:05:36 2015 UTC,"Rant incoming:  I understand that they were probably supposed to go live in the next patch, but the damage has been done already and just pulling them out of the storefront is IMO a very dickish move by TB and it doesn't benefit anyone. Not only that, but there has not been a single explanation or response to any of the affected contributors on why the stuff got pulled or some sort of apology.  What's the point of it? So they'll release them next month and be like ""Look at this new stuff that totally hasn't been in the store before!"""
ChivalryGame,3dmg4t,elwebbaro,2,Sat Jul 18 11:08:51 2015 UTC,"Could be that if they plan on releasing more UGC content,they need to have good amounts of it. There are less content makers these dad so if they release it all perhaps there won't be so much new stuff to add."
ChivalryGame,3dmg4t,Oilystool,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:21:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, although that totally makes sense, it's just a very very shady move, since the content is readily available and working within the game, people bought it, but they are artificially holding it back."
ChivalryGame,3dmg4t,elwebbaro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:23:26 2015 UTC,"Could very well be that who ever pulled it back was not a person in a position to comment on it.

ChivalryGame,3dmg4t,elwebbaro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:41:20 2015 UTC,"I had mixed feelings when it came to what happened.in one way it sucks it was pulled and in another it also meant no mention of pulled items on their release notes so players might miss it. I wrote to them about it but ,maybe they are on vacation. Who knows ."

ChivalryGame,3djgd1,Butterfly-Jizz,4,Fri Jul 17 04:11:29 2015 UTC,"There are a few feinters, most just drop a microfeint from way too far out though. The ones who play them well, can also usually win without them.  I'm not a huge fan of asking someone not to feint before a fight, just beat them."
ChivalryGame,3djgd1,skeletorsjism,3,Fri Jul 17 15:56:15 2015 UTC,It's only a free kill vs bad players. Go feint a top tier NA player and see how EZ it is. I'm not saying they won't fall for some feints. But the possibility of a feint causes you to keep proper spacing and use good footwork to minimize a feints impact. Not using feints as a whole just lowers the skill of players tbh.
ChivalryGame,3djgd1,Chuckdatass,-3,Fri Jul 17 14:11:04 2015 UTC,Try fighting any Australian level 40-60 without feinting then.

That is why we use feints when facing each other. And for the record, I don't feint in pubs, so I'll be just fine fighting the Australian pub scene."
ChivalryGame,3djgd1,Chuckdatass,2,Fri Jul 17 14:40:18 2015 UTC,"lol REKT  But forreal though you can only be so good at b0ckswinging and hittrading to the point that it gets boring and everybody hits their ceiling. Feints raise the skill ceiling so much higher and is shown because no player can read feints super consistently, so people have something to work towards, and defense is actually much more valued in a player."

TO maps are super momentum based (no, just because syn barely beat px in King obj and went slightly ahead of phoenix against Tempest in a bo1 df, doesn't mean they are waaaay better than phoenix) and require coordination outside of fights. You can win an LTS with raw mechanics, which many teams have."

Then archers ruined all the fun so it doesn't happen anymore as a tournament mode. Projectiles were allowed long ago but the latest ones usually didn't allow projectiles. Although somehow archer arrows were not considered projectiles :/ I guess because it's their primary weapon? Either way, it's a lot more fun without archers, they pretty much determine the winner of LTS typically."

ChivalryGame,3djui5,electricspit,6,Fri Jul 17 08:20:14 2015 UTC,I think as much as the majority of long time veteran players will agree it's just part of the game at this point. If you don't do it as well you give up a huge competitive advantage. I'd say your best bet is to work on footwork to just create range and make it harder for them to hit you with reverses and then learn how to use feints properly. Most people that are spinning around like crazy to try and hit you will have a really hard time reading any of your feints if you execute them well.
ChivalryGame,3djui5,DireWo1f,5,Fri Jul 17 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"I hated spinners as hell when people constantly wrecked me with it, didn't take long before i started to spin too and it was fun :) Once you learn how to deal with spinners you really should try spinning too."
ChivalryGame,3djui5,Turo2014,3,Fri Jul 17 10:00:17 2015 UTC,You just got to figure out a way to counter it. Spin to win is still retarded but it's not going to be patched out or fixed at all so you just kinda have to deal with it.
ChivalryGame,3djui5,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,7,Fri Jul 17 14:18:39 2015 UTC,Just get used to it or leave lol
ChivalryGame,3djui5,Nohbdy_11,2,Fri Jul 17 10:01:46 2015 UTC,"Yo, your post got caught in spam filter. You're welcome to repost it since it didnt get any traction.   blatent exploitation of the game mechanics?   Those don't really exist, there are some ways to really fuck things up but I'm guessing you haven't ran into them.  Setting your mouse senstivity doesnt help you, it caps out when you spin relatively low. Without the real time swing mechanic existing (ergo, drags being possible) the game would be boring as fuck and not as unique. The stuff doesn't look realistic but there's no exploitation necessarily."
ChivalryGame,3djui5,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Fri Jul 17 07:32:54 2015 UTC,"Sadly any time a new player makes this criticism loads of people who consider themselves amateur experts will jump down your throat and tell you that it's just skill and if you can't handle it leave. In fairness they aren't wrong, the problem is; it's a bad attitude and it makes newer players who could contribute to the community want to give up and leave. I would say that if you are finding people who have a very... acrobatic style of play to be a problem for you, don't give up or accept that the only way to beat them is to join them, it isn't. Honestly in the time I have been playing the game (since release) I have found that the easiest way to take down people who think they are Obi Wan Kenobi (from Episode 3 rather than 4) is just to use your feet, keep your spacing and time your blocks. Most of these guys are so wrapped up in their own gymnastic exercises they are oblivious of how much stamina they are exhausting or when their hits are actually likely to connect. To me the best way of beating these guys isn't to join them, it's to do the complete opposite. Manage your personal space, watch them like you are a tennis player and they are a ball then when their stupid weightless lightsaber comes flying towards you casually parry it and twat them on the head. I appreciate that is the opposite of what everyone else in the thread has said (and on reddit that usually means you will get downvoted into oblivion by the crowd) but that's just the way I have learnt to deal with things. And as the crowd has already indicated, over time you will probably become so at home with the feel of the game that you start doing it yourself, potentially without even realising."

If you drag or do some sneaky ripostes and mix it up you should be able to counter them. Also the keeping space thing and moving to back and to the side is all good. Gotta be ready to play reactionary and watch out for them gambling, forcing hittrades and what not so be on your toes and ready to feint to parry."
ChivalryGame,3djui5,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:40:11 2015 UTC,It would be pretty hard to take out spinning with just a mod. To enjoy Chiv in the long run you just have to learn to live with the game being retarded.
ChivalryGame,3djui5,mobinstime,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:03:55 2015 UTC,It's part of the game and you'll just have to deal with it. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to join the windmillers. You can do perfectly fine in Chiv (if not better) by just using careful footwork and exploiting weapon/animation priorities to punish people who like to spin around wildly.  The one dude who I always see at the top of the main Australian classic duel server scoreboard is a guy who uses only SoW or LS with no backwards overheads or crazy drags. He's just a master of psyching people out and abusing animation priority to punish the shit out of anyone trying to spin to win.

ChivalryGame,3dfzax,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:25:32 2015 UTC,I think it took me a good few months (maybe a year) to work out there was two menus to the voice commands so I likely didnt know it was even in.

ChivalryGame,3d9ndw,PredFTMP,7,Tue Jul 14 16:41:46 2015 UTC,"And even when you're bad or very bad for a while in the beginning, you can still have a  lot of fun.   I did, at least.   Every kill you get feels really rewarding so even when my k/d ratio was like 1 to 3, I was having fun and felt like I was doing alright.    Also, when everybody else is better than you, you can focus on the objective instead of on kills and still be a big help to your team.      IMO It's worth getting in to, and it doesn't hurt to try.  If you're not having fun, then you can always quit."

For Chivalry specifically, it's not a dead game by any means so in that sense it's worth getting into.

ChivalryGame,3d9ndw,squishywtrmln,2,Tue Jul 14 19:12:11 2015 UTC,The official duel servers take forever to get duels. I'd recommend trying one of the classic duel servers. You're able to get way more duels in less time
ChivalryGame,3d9ndw,CelebratoryCrouching,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:55:11 2015 UTC,"A caution about duelyard maps is they often run a mod called Mercs that changes many aspects of the game, so things will be different when you play in a regular server.   Also, servers running mods do not let you gain XP (for ranks) or keep kills (for weapon unlocks)."

ChivalryGame,3d8h84,OmarWarOgre,7,Tue Jul 14 09:26:42 2015 UTC,"Here you can see the new physics assets being placed onto weapons. When a player strikes another player's weapon, their attack is deflected and both players go back to recovery.   Targeting your opponents actual weapon will allow you to avoid hit-trading or skillfully deflect an attack.   This is the second phase of Warmod's clashing system. The third phase will replace the current parry box system with a system that uses the actual weapon model and custom parrying animations to parry attacks."

ChivalryGame,3d8h84,KloobzZ,2,Wed Jul 15 00:38:41 2015 UTC,"The clashing system in my opinion is very clunky, and can lead to terrible results in the middle of a team fight in public TO as your team mates weapons can cause you to clash, cancelling an attack on the enemy. This includes if your weapon crosses a team mates weapon during release at any point, which gets confusing and unenjoyable."
ChivalryGame,3d8h84,Frodiziak,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:50 2015 UTC,"The current system uses the players parry box for clashing, which has the same problems as the parry box always has. The new one will have a lot more finesse, and won't have the same kind of awkward team clashes you describe."

You'd have to change the code that controls how weapons move between states - release, parry, combo etc. These states instruct the weapons on what animations to play.  If you modified the way states select animations, and messed around with the animation arrays for weapons (these list all the animations a weapon can do) then you could do it. It's just a bit of legwork."

Responsive sensor and highly customizable software (macro's, DPI settings, binds, LED color (if you like that kinda thing), etc.). I love the grip as well. Best of all, you can get it now for $16.  Honestly, the best mouse isn't necessarily going to be an expensive one or popular one. It's going to be the one that feels best to you. The problem is knowing what you like, and knowing what you're getting. Since you're likely going to order online, it can be difficult to predict the feel. The best bet is to get something similar to what you're used to."

ChivalryGame,3cz972,MoePork,4,Mon Jul 13 13:37:43 2015 UTC,"This is a weak defense, considering how me and plenty of other non east coasters that play or used to play competitive chivalry never had anyone ever complain about desyncs like Boner, does that mean other tempest people are in the same boat? Of course not, but just because they don't doesn't put other individuals off the hook; could be doing it in comp without your knowledge.  But do keep in mind how hiding things behind closed doors makes people not trust you.  Remember how interitus tried to hide the intentional abuse of the alt animation swing exploit back in the day?  They reported it in secret to TBS themselves though, and look how long it took to fix it as a result; only to catch a select few players from their roster from abusing it intentionally themselves?  The same thing is happening here.  Regardless, I don't care for the witch hunt @ tempest that dweller started, and conveniently right before a major tournament.  Does this ring any bells?  I care more about history loving to repeat itself, especially with this cesspool of a ""competitive"" community; go ahead and ruin another major tournament, please, and remove all possible faith that anyone will ever have in the future."

I completely agree that spreading this around only enables further trolling by those who would be willing to exploit it.  I am glad to hear it has been addressed by TB.
ChivalryGame,3cz972,Reithur,3,Sun Jul 12 06:05:26 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been addressed by TB until they actually do the patch. The issue isn't solved until it's actually in the game and people can't abuse it anymore, simple as that. I think that there is absolutely no way to take this game seriously until this is fixed removed from the game, and until then, more people knowing the command won't do any harm because the game is already unplayable at the moment. IMO people are making too big of a deal out of it spreading, anyone who pays attention to the reddit or takes this game seriously already knows about it. If the command was still ""contained"" like it was before, TB wouldn't have to fix it, so I'm glad it's been leaked. That's just my 2cents"
ChivalryGame,3cz972,KylerX2,3,Sun Jul 12 04:30:06 2015 UTC,"You are entitled to  your 2 cents.  In my experience with other games, leaking an exploit through youtube vids or forum posts only made the problem worse until it got patched.  Quiet messages to the devs about exploits got things done without ruining the game for everyone for a while."
ChivalryGame,3cz972,NippleCannon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:00:16 2015 UTC,"I could see that working with other devs... but we all know how TB is. If this went down how it should have, Height after learning of the command from stan a while back should have told TB and it would have been fixed easy, but I don't think TB is the type of company to get off their ass unless something truly becomes a problem for everyone. Now that it's been leaked, TB is addressing the problem, so I'd say it's worth a few days of obvious cheaters in pub matches for an overall fixed game"
ChivalryGame,3cz972,KylerX2,0,Sun Jul 12 23:46:24 2015 UTC,They knew about the command and fixed it internally before you started spreading it around. Stop trying to act like you're trying to help by telling everybody how to cheat.

The more people know about it and attempt to ruin the game with it, the faster devs are forced to fix it, or watch the game crumble.  Also see how trying to keep it on the low hasn't worked in the past -- same method interitus tried doing.  Word gets out, always.  Instead of having it slowly infecting the game like a silent killer, theres a massive surge and a big red flag that gets caught early.  Stop repeating mistakes."
ChivalryGame,3cz972,KylerX2,2,Mon Jul 13 22:49:38 2015 UTC,"Not true, atleast not always - I knew a debug console command a few months back that had the potential to be very gamebreaking (you could crash servers and mess up map objectives/spawns).

ChivalryGame,3cz972,electricspit,0,Mon Jul 13 22:58:57 2015 UTC,"It's only supposedly being addressed because it's been leaked.

ChivalryGame,3cz972,NippleCannon,2,Tue Jul 14 10:44:25 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really matter anyway, there are tons of programs available to mess with networking traffic coming from your computer, you can easily simulate packet loss without this console command.

Stan supposedly told Height about this MONTHS ago, where he claims to have passed it on to TB. How am I supposed to believe that it's been ""fixed on their end for a while now"" when it's literally been months since TB knew about it?

He has also purposefully lagged/desync'd on purpose before I even knew about this command a month ago. He told the person that he was purposefully doing desyncs to that he only does it to people that he doesn't respect. I actually found out about the command a few days after that and when I showed it to the guy who saw Raw Boner purposefully desync he was saying that it looked just like what Raw Boner was doing to him.  Seems kind of fishy, but I don't have enough evidence to say that Raw Boner used it. If someone uses this command semi-intelligently, it's impossible to know. This game is buggy as hell so it's impossible to spot a hacker unless it's blatant. We can't punish Raw Boner because some of us suspect that he was exploiting."
ChivalryGame,3cz972,NippleCannon,2,Sun Jul 12 06:32:10 2015 UTC,"About a month or so ago Raw Boner discovered how to purposefully desync, although he never shared with me the methodology for doing so. Maybe he was using the packet loss command to achieve the desyncs, but i'm not sure. However from what i've observed he would only use the desyncs when messing around, and when he did use them it was extrememly obvious, definately not something that he could use subtly during a scrim or tournament. I'm absolutely certain that Robert never used any such exploits during a tournament or scrim. Why would he? The guy is arguably one of the most if not the most skilled player in NA. Its asinine to suggest that he would feel the need to exploit to gain some sort of advantage as he is already better than pretty much everyone in the scene and it would diminish the satisfaction he gets from reking scrub nubs. If he indeed was using some sort of exploit during scrims or tournaments, then the rest of Tempest is completely ignorant to that fact. Knowing Robert personally and having played with him for years, I highly doubt that he cheats. And since nobody has presented any evidence of any sort other than ""waaahhh I can't parry Raw Boner he must be exploiting"" then we should stop discussing this matter. I think that once the command is hot fixed and Robert is still dominating everyone at the same level, then anything fishy about him can be attributed to his internet connection, and not exploits."
ChivalryGame,3cz972,NippleCannon,4,Sun Jul 12 22:16:33 2015 UTC,None of us have ever used it in scrims or competitive matches.
ChivalryGame,3cz972,visridge,3,Sun Jul 12 22:52:38 2015 UTC,"""us"" includes Raw Boner. You keep mentioning him using it but never present any evidence."
ChivalryGame,3cz972,NippleCannon,5,Sun Jul 12 23:30:50 2015 UTC,"How can you be certain? If I were to abuse the command, I would be inclusive about it, and not tell people."
ChivalryGame,3cz972,jfkmsjkmsdf,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:55:16 2015 UTC,"I played with him for nearly two years now and he never had to desync to beat me, so he wouldn't need to desync to beat other people. I've seen how the command affects the game and it's not subtle, watch one match with Raw playing and you can tell he isn't lagging around everywhere. We're all (Tempest) rooting for the cheat commands to be patched out."
ChivalryGame,3cz972,NippleCannon,0,Mon Jul 13 00:08:37 2015 UTC,and then theres this
ChivalryGame,3cz972,iamick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:14:10 2015 UTC,"Desyncs like that are uncommon but they do happen randomly, anybody who's played the game for a while has seen it multiple times done by multiple people. He doesn't desync at all for the rest of the match.  I guess Zug was also abusing the command way back too. (in case you missed it, I parried his ghost swing)  I must've also known of the command over a year ago when I accidentally desync teamkilled.  Or when I got shield bashed  Or more recently in this duel  Or massikaroz when I threw an axe at him  Cherry picking is fun."
ChivalryGame,3cz972,NippleCannon,-3,Sun Jul 12 18:59:07 2015 UTC,watch one match with Raw playing and you can tell he isn't lagging around everywhere.   ROFL

[S_API FAIL] SteamAPI_Init() failed; unable to locate a running instance of Steam, or a local steamclient.dylib. Followed by a 'Chivalry Medieval Warfare quit unexpectedly' (I am using the only executable I can find, which is in Chivalry.app/Contents/MacOS and is of the same name of the equivalent file in Windows and Linux so I believe is correct. So no luck through that. Will try again in Wine later."
ChivalryGame,3ctjey,mrfyote,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:57:08 2015 UTC,"oh that's an easy fix. i forgot that happened to me, too.  they package a steamclient.so in with the files you download, you need to make sure it's in the mac equilivent of these dirs.  ./Binaries/Linux/lib/steamclient.so ./linux64/steamclient.so   on other thing i also had to do was make a steam_appid.txt file in  ./Binaries/Linux/steam_appid.txt   the file contains:  219640   EDIT: also when you run the server you'll see a lot of ""errors"", there isn't any output when things are occuring after the initial start, too.   here is what mine looks like after i start it and it's running successfully:  $ ./UDKGameServer-Linux AOCCTF-Moor_p\?steamsockets\?Port=7777\?QueryPort=7778 -seekfreeloadingserver   [S_API FAIL] SteamAPI_Init() failed; SteamAPI_IsSteamRunning() failed.

ChivalryGame,3ctjey,mrfyote,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:41:49 2015 UTC,"My problem with this is there are no files equivalent to /Binaries or /linux64. The closest I can think of is /MacOS, which (as it has the steam_appid.txt file already) I assume is the equivalent of /Binaries/Linux. Just to clarify, this is in my Application Support/steam/steamapps/chivalry medieval warfare, not chivalry_ded_server as that has no executable. The file hierarchy seems to be completely different for Mac unfortunately, and so no luck there. I also cannot find a steamclient.so file. Thank you very much for the help though, I appreciate that someone who has seen these errors before has taken the time to try and help. I'm going to dig around and see if I can find any equivalent to these steps, but it's not looking likely."

ChivalryGame,3ciktf,koalassleepalot,10,Wed Jul 8 04:46:09 2015 UTC,"You're level 19, you have hardly even scraped the surface of the game. Be patient and keep watching the tip videos and trying to implement them in your gameplay.  When fighting the guys that spin either keep your distance and let them waste stamina or learn to anticipate the attack and block it (always remember to look at the tip of the weapon when blocking) and then immediately attack. It will take time, I'm level 35 and still get my ass handed to me most the time. But I love the game all the same.     EDIT: Also watch the montages that get posted here and try to analyze what they are doing and you'll start to pick it up."
ChivalryGame,3ciktf,-StopRefresh-,5,Wed Jul 8 05:06:21 2015 UTC,"You're level 19, you have hardly even scraped the surface of the game.   Yep.  Play more.  It takes the same amount of kills to get from rank 0 to rank 30 as it does to get from 45 to 46.  The higher ranks who are killing you have played centuries more than you.  No single tip is going to make you better than them (except for picking crossbow and noscoping them)."
ChivalryGame,3ciktf,Jonks,4,Wed Jul 8 14:18:43 2015 UTC,"That's a great point that people often overlook. I often hear that rank doesn't mean anything, but high ranks mean a lot more kills than they do at lower ranks. A difference of one rank above 45 translates to dozens of hours of playtime. Above 50, this might become a hundred or more hours.   For example; rank 44 is nearly halfway to rank 50 for kills required; approximately 27800 kills out of 55600 kills. Rank 50 is about 2/7 1/3 of the kills required for rank 60 (about 175k 177k).  Some people simply have had more playtime to learn everything.  *Edited for more accurate numbers now that I'm on a computer instead of phone."
ChivalryGame,3ciktf,Reithur,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"If you LMB'd your way to rank 50 in Public_TO/FFA servers, then your level means pretty much that you know how not to tk and not much more.

ChivalryGame,3ciktf,Anti-assholes_police,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:24:31 2015 UTC,"This is true, but most players who have stayed around that long have more than enough tricks to destroy rookies,which is the original topic of this thread."
ChivalryGame,3ciktf,Reithur,8,Thu Jul 9 13:27:53 2015 UTC,"Biggest tip I have to share is your vertical body movement. This is often referred to matrixing but its also used in dragging.  How does it work? Looking up at the sky while crouching bends your body back like this:  \ And looking down and crouching at the ground like this: /  If that didn't make sense ill try to clarify further.    Look up while crouching  (a) Defense. You create larger separation when looking up, so when the enemy swings at you, you get a larger window of time to parry, sometimes your look up crouch matrix wont even require a parry if you gauge the distance well enough. (b) Offence. When performing an overhead swing [scroll down mouse wheel] you can make your attack look almost like slow motion depending on the weapon, effectiveness varies. This often will trick your opponent in parrying too early. This is called decelerated swings. Look down while crouching. (a) Defense. This is essentially a ""duck"" but can be uses effectively when your expecting an attack to the upper torso/head. This allows you duck the attack and immediately punish with a free swing if you pull it off. (b) Offense. The famous look down overhead, learn it, love it. When Performing an overhead attack and looking down your attack is accelerated. However, this  will reduce the range of your weapon, so get close! You'll finch them if they attack more times then not using this attack.   This is a small part of the complexity of chiv but I find alot of players don't utilize these two methods."
ChivalryGame,3ciktf,johnnyp1231,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:59:10 2015 UTC,Don't make looking up while crouching a habit though; although it makes reading attacks a little easier however you won't be able to keep your maneuverability and any smart player will just circle and attack around your parry or feint spam you to death.
ChivalryGame,3ciktf,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:16:20 2015 UTC,I've recently started to implement these methods (lvl 25 here) and been training daily for a week now.

ChivalryGame,3ciktf,PaperCookies,5,Thu Jul 9 00:26:13 2015 UTC,"Go to a Classic Duels server, find someone better than you, have them kick your ass and ask them for tips.   The main thing you need to do is figure out what the hell is actually happening. If you don't know what your opponent even did to kill you, then you're not gonna learn anything. Once you understand what's going on and how you're dying, you'll start to actually learn from your deaths and get better."

ChivalryGame,3ciktf,Sergeeeek,0,Sat Jul 11 23:20:36 2015 UTC,Tips: git gud.
ChivalryGame,3ciktf,pm_me_something_op,4,Wed Jul 8 13:16:53 2015 UTC,"stick to the basics. Work on controlling your panic parrying. Practice your Ripostes. Practice with fast weapons first, then slow ones later. Learning the range of weapons is important too. If you know someone is too far to hit you then you don't even need to block and you can swoop in and attack them, or you can matrix or duck and then attack. footwork is very important too."
ChivalryGame,3ciktf,jrodb92,2,Wed Jul 8 08:45:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of it is thinking on your feet. One big thing I notice about this game, versus gun-based titles like BF or CoD, is that you must make and implement your decision, or strategy, BEFORE you know it's going to work for sure.  So, like, if you see a Knight coming in with a long sword slash, you can easily backstep out of the way - the range on those swords isn't super long.  But as you step back, you have to begin your swing at the same time, so that your weapon is damaging him AT THE SAME TIME he misses, or at least while he's still in his release or recovery phase.  The counter on his part could be that he's going to combo into another attack, skipping his windup phase. If he does that, and sidesteps you like you sidestepped him, not only has he shaved significant time off of his attack but you're also left open while you complete yours.  Also, I watched a ton of videos too, and while I understand the concepts as well as I can on paper, my current issue is implementing them in an ever-changing battlefield. It's just going to take practice on my part, for example if I'm using a riposte with an Overhead attack with the Messer, I can look down and crouch to make that hit nearly instant. However, at the moment, if that opponent moves to the side at all, I have lots of trouble still connecting that hit.  edit: practice is always more fun with friends. i try to run practices every couple of days, just sparring with friends on a local game, but if you'd like to play sometime send me a private message on here. US central here."

ChivalryGame,3clnya,ABearWithABeer,2,Thu Jul 9 21:00:25 2015 UTC,I'm sorry that you have to learn how to play a game in order to become competitive.   Try this game. You should be able to win a few games without spending too much time learning the advanced strategies.
ChivalryGame,3clnya,ABearWithABeer,-1,Thu Jul 9 20:36:49 2015 UTC,"Its above your level of understanding for you to comprehend, give it 5-10 years and you might have a chance."
ChivalryGame,3clnya,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Thu Jul 9 22:34:44 2015 UTC,"No I totally get it. You have to get three in a row to win. Playing the middle first gives you the greatest number of options as it allows you to get three diagonally as horizontally and vertically. However, if both players play properly then the game will result in a tie."

ChivalryGame,3clnya,MrJoeSteam,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:55:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, at the highest level of play, basically every game has some level ""looking like a joke"".  Just some examples:  -In CS:GO you need to learn every map like the back of your hand, and know exactly where to throw grenades and exactly how to pop around for every corner.    -In UMvC3 Vergil with lvl3 X factor is basically as good as his whole team (including him), and sometimes games just come down to a single coinflip mixup into death.  -In SSBM, tech skill has gone to ridiculous levels, some tech is still being discovered to this day, and we're (sort of) approaching a state of ""20XX"" where frame perfect Fox is simply better than everyone.  Never mind that we started off as a party game.    And it's not even just video games:  -In soccer/(european) football, diving is pretty often the best, safest option in a situation.    -Even in american football, faking injuries to allow teammates to rest is pretty common.  -In basketball, intentionally fouls near the end of the game to regain possession are common.  -In baseball, intentional walks probably seem pretty ""retarded"" and against the idea of a walk to outsiders  -There's even this weird thing happening (admittedly) rarely in chess where Carlsen simply outlasts older players in basically drawn endgames and waits for an eventual slight mistake, arguably because he's in better physical shape and younger.    Also, ""retardation"" is not necessarily mutually exclusive with depth."
ChivalryGame,3clnya,Kesby,-5,Thu Jul 9 23:35:04 2015 UTC,Fuck off.
ChivalryGame,3clnya,bossmcsauce,-3,Thu Jul 9 03:58:53 2015 UTC,learn to play pls
ChivalryGame,3clnya,HELPMEIMGONADIE,0,Thu Jul 9 14:53:57 2015 UTC,learn to abuse short-sighted mechanical shortcuts by devs that allow manipulation and breaking of hitboxes... sure. That's like telling somebody to learn to play hide-and-go-seek and telling them that the correct and proper way to play skillfully is to just open your eyes a bit and see which way people run to go hide... simply because you COULD open your eyes while counting doesn't make it 'part of the game'.
ChivalryGame,3clnya,bossmcsauce,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:38:56 2015 UTC,breaking of hitboxes?
ChivalryGame,3clnya,Chuckdatass,-1,Thu Jul 9 18:07:36 2015 UTC,"poorly worded. Perhaps exploitation of hitbox mechanics that don't match the physical location and shape of the models. They are temporarily made much worse during certain movements, like super-fast spinning while bending way back and doing certain swings."
ChivalryGame,3clnya,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Thu Jul 9 19:28:18 2015 UTC,Yeah you wrong buddy.

ChivalryGame,3clnya,Chuckdatass,0,Thu Jul 9 16:46:19 2015 UTC,feints and maneuvering is totally legit. What's not legit is abuse of known-to-be-broken hitbox mechanics that happen when you spin at high speeds and swing over from behind and shit.
ChivalryGame,3clnya,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Thu Jul 9 19:25:33 2015 UTC,This doesn't exist. Hit boxes of characters are consistent. You might be referencing the attack tracers. But even then. No.

ChivalryGame,3cchpv,DDRMANIAC007,4,Mon Jul 6 21:00:25 2015 UTC,Whats the point for new players to play on mercs mod servers when they dont know what flinching is in the first place
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,feeeggsdragdad,6,Mon Jul 6 21:08:16 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily just new players, but veterans who aren't in clans. I'd love to play mercs but I can never find a TO server that isn't locked."
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,QuadPolar,2,Mon Jul 6 23:22:08 2015 UTC,Because they'd never know what flinching is on vanilla servers.
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,ExileTheWolf,3,Tue Jul 7 00:52:30 2015 UTC,The point is that i think most new players would rather play on the vanilla game then some random mod which they have no idea of what it changes. Just look at what happened when the 70p FOR server went mercs.
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,feeeggsdragdad,4,Tue Jul 7 01:11:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not disagreeing with you. Most new people see a mod, they think it's gonna add light sabers or insta-gibbing or something. They play Mercs and they have no clue what's different, so they don't play.  But there's always the hope that more pub Mercs servers will at least retain SOME new userbase. Hopefully, that in turn generates its own new userbase via word-of-mouth. Pipe dream, certainly. But we can try....we can try...."

No-one will play Mercs but your competitive circle-jerk, and having the ""competitive"" players play a different mod of a multiplayer game doesn't help the already bad chivalry community at all.  Imagine if some CS: GO pro's decided the game is not perfect (ooh, what a surprise) and made a mod for competitive play? Ridicilous, right? RIGHT??"
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,sesstreets,6,Tue Jul 7 05:09:53 2015 UTC,"Your comparison is flawed, CSGO was intended from the start to be esport level competitive. What the comp players of chivalry wanted was a similar experience in chivalry but without waiting for chivalry 2 to come out.  With slasher coming out MAYBE next year and chiv 2 not even announced yet, mercs mod remains THE best way to get a big tournament or a competitive scrim with a 'hack and slash' game."
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,LordKefkaPalazzo,2,Tue Jul 7 11:48:27 2015 UTC,"AGREED, its like playing two different games. If you practice on mercs, you'll be worse at vanilla, and vice versa. It's silly."
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,electricspit,3,Tue Jul 7 12:57:13 2015 UTC,You can't be bad at vanilla you just hit trade as much as possible
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,NerdStarkz,3,Wed Jul 8 19:47:30 2015 UTC,"Your comment actually was actually logical. The reason the mod was made (to my understanding) was because TB treated chiv as an indie hack n slash non competitive game and limited it's potential by not balancing the game properly. Angered by this waste of potential the mercs mod guys took matters into their own hands and created a mod to balance the game so it may be played competitively. Think of mercs as a competitive play patch rather than a mod. (sorry if there are any grammar or spelling mistakes, I wrote this late at night and am too lazy to double check). I do see the point you are making though."
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,redditors_r_manginas,2,Tue Jul 7 06:08:46 2015 UTC,There's no incentive to watch tournaments because they all are on mercs. What is watching people play the mod gonna do for you if you play vanilla?
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,NerdStarkz,3,Tue Jul 7 08:00:06 2015 UTC,To most players there are no noticeable differences in the mod. Let's be honest here people wouldn't really watch even if it was vanilla. I don't think that having the mod would in any way affect the audience turnout.
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,Kevin--Spacey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:09:50 2015 UTC,"You know, besides the fact EVERY weapon swings differently and has a different speed. If I play 5000 hours of vanilla, I'll still lose to some virgin who practices 1 hour a day on mercs and nothing else. It gives a stupid competitive edge to the couple nerds who play mercs instead of vanilla, which is the real game."
ChivalryGame,3cchpv,ia_Flame,4,Tue Jul 7 12:54:32 2015 UTC,"Lol this is so stupidly untrue I can't even. The two versions of the game or almost identical aside from one or two weapons such as the claymore where you notice a night and day difference between the vanilla game and the mod. The only thing you have to get used to is not blindly attacking and forcing trades. Once you use your brain for more than ten seconds to compute that in order to hit someone you need to be the first one to attack or have the faster weapon, then your five thousand hours will crush any novice and most players if you truly have a large portion of time in game under your belt."

Players who aren't in clans join mercs duelyards a lot though, probably because they heard something like ""if you want to get good go hang out in a duelyard where the best players are"", which is true but really I think mercs TO servers have on average the highest level of skill of any type of server I have ever played in."

I'm perfectly happy playing without it when I have to, but from my point of view, there is absolutely no reason not to use it."

ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,Rob_Owner,3,Mon Jul 6 18:51:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly it is quite common for it to be better to have a tyrant for balancing. People will bitch and moan for some weeks or even months but, if the balance decision was the right one, they'll settle down. Obviously this isn't always so easy, but it can work magnificently at times (IceFrog with Dota, Sirlin with SF2HD remix, even if people don't like how the remix plays due to technical differences and whatnot, they can't deny that the roster is much more balanced).  I, for one, still believe MAA can be viable without doop and competitive with Knight and Van on many objectives in their current state. Keep in mind, I am not saying remove dodge in its entirety. I think a doop-less MAA would be a flex pick rather than a class you ""main"", and I don't think that is necessarily bad."

ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,Charles_K,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:22:34 2015 UTC,I either want no doop or no dodge. It's too easy to crutch on it and in a 1v1 vs knight or vanguard they actually can't win.

ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,BrianHorror,6,Mon Jul 6 19:12:20 2015 UTC,"if you type 'features' into the console when connected to a mercs mod server you'll get a general idea.  Basically:   First Hit Flinch - you can now flinch releases: hit trades are greatly reduced Handle Tracer Rework - several weapons have handle hits but only from the tip to the halfway point Health Regen - 2x when standing still, regular speed when walking Archer Projectiles - flinch players but do less damage to knight, vanguard, and maa classes Archer Ammo Reduction - Light XBow: 15, Reg Xbow: 12, Heavy: 10 Vanguard Charge Attack - disabled Several other timing and damage changes to almost all weapons."

What does it mean to ""first hit flinch""?  What weapon or play-style changes would seasoned merc mod users recommend for a player who mains maul in non-merc duels and scrims? In other words, what has the mod nerfed in respect to the maul or knight class?"
ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,Derodyne,6,Tue Jul 7 07:40:09 2015 UTC,"Maul is still very viable in mercs, you just have to play smarter and rely less on mindless attacks and lucky kill hit trades. First hit flinch means you can get flinched throughout your whole swing, not just windup (eg the first player to hit another lands the flinch). Note that riposte release is still unflinchable."

ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,Justwonderingheh,6,Tue Jul 7 11:51:55 2015 UTC,"The gambling, hit-trading maul/messer knight of vanilla yesteryear has become an endangered species in mercs mod.   Basically, your maul attack will be cancelled any time you are hit faster/first (""first hit flinch""). This means there is an easy counter to those long, janky maul combos which target hittrades. If I have the faster weapon, I can hit you first, which will cancel your attack (even in the release phase of your attack) and give me the initiative.   Although heavy weapons still have their purpose in mercs mod (damage output, synergies etc), the knight meta has definitely shifted towards faster or more versatile weapons (e.g. sword of war, longsword, pole axe, grand mace). You definitely see fewer mauls and messers in mercs mod as opposed to vanilla."
ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,BrianHorror,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:58:08 2015 UTC,"Great reply, thanks.  Is the maul still able to kill knights with a single overhead swing to the head?  Has anything changed in respect to reverse-swing viability?"
ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,Kesby,2,Tue Jul 7 07:34:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, damage wasn't changed for maul IIRC, and no RoH's weren't changed. Maul is still very good and very viable, you just can't use it like a brainless caveman anymore."
ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,crimsonBZD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"Well basically you can't do anything against men at arms or shield/1h knights. You have no other option than parry/ripost to stam drain them. Which is somewhat effective, but boring. And they can still pull back and regen whenever you want, because if you attack, a stab can just stop you. Meh.   You try to attack with a delay? Stab. You try to roh? Stab. You try to feint? Stab. You can only stay passive and parry/riposte. But hey, it's still viable to backstab people on TO."
ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,frisb,2,Tue Jul 7 04:13:41 2015 UTC,"You switch to norse to deal with MAA. It's pretty futile to fight maa 1v1 with a maul. Ask spook, unless he gets lucky I can just run away forever."
ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,Turo2014,2,Tue Jul 7 04:39:47 2015 UTC,"Seems like grandmace is the best blunt knight weapon in mercs. Maul isn't bad but it isn't as good as in vanilla Chiv basically just because it's a lot harder to trade, I don't think anything else about it was nerfed."

ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,faktorfaktor,0,Tue Jul 7 11:53:15 2015 UTC,"I mean that's an opinion on the mechanic though. From a strategic standpoint it makes total sense in non-mercs to take trade opportunities when your weapon does significantly more damage.. they're already injured while you are not etc.  Don't get the wrong idea I'm not relying on the gamble to bring in the bacon, it's just an option I've always had using the maul - definitely don't opt for trades when dueling other mauls now that they can kill in one oh hs. I suppose too if I'm hit-trading a player with a faster weapon they probably had the chance to ftp out of their gamble to interrupt my slower windup. There's just more to consider on the side of keeping it in the game as-is.. I can't decide which is more ""fair"" or fun to build strategy around."
ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,CelebratoryCrouching,3,Tue Jul 7 06:14:11 2015 UTC,"trades are an extremely viable tactic, and trades still do occur on merc mod  however trading on vanilla can lead to essentially players being rewarded for lack of skill and trading power, or just senseless gambling. This is the reason for fhf, it adds a big dynamic to the skill of the game - but it's not that noticable in 1v1, it's in FFA, TO and LTS where it really makes a difference in big fights.  It also means you can save teammates from attacks with proper target switches"
ChivalryGame,3cbx8c,aStarving0rphan,2,Mon Jul 6 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know why trading was ever in the vanilla game - first hit flinch should ALWAYS be a thing.

Really the only weapons that feel significantly slower are those that had .4s stab windups and overheads before.  And while those weapons we're slowed down on those attacks, an MAA with any of those weapons is still one of the strongest load outs specifically because of FHF even at their new speeds.  A few others might feel slower like Claymore too, but the feedback from that change was largely positive because it got better hit to kills to compensate and was too lolzy before"

ChivalryGame,3cc588,CelebratoryCrouching,6,Mon Jul 6 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"Mercs adds first hit flinch, which means there is much less hit trading.   It also changes some damage values and speeds for different weapons, and makes a few minor changes to health and stamina regeneration.     It basically tries to balance the game and fix things that weren't perfect in vanilla.  It's used in pretty much all competitive matches now.   I personally prefer Mercs over vanilla chivalry.   Mercs servers are often populated, but at weird times when not a lot of  people are on, they can be empty.   Unfortunately, a lot of the servers that run Mercs are clan servers and they can require a password, sometimes even when it's just on duel yard."
ChivalryGame,3cc588,thefranchise23,4,Mon Jul 6 19:49:36 2015 UTC,Merc's mod is God's answer to cavemen.
ChivalryGame,3cc588,ParkRangerStan,3,Tue Jul 7 12:50:18 2015 UTC,"Anyone who says FHF ruins slow weapons obviously hasn't played Mercs mod, or even seen a match played on Mercs, for that matter. In fact, some of the best weapons in Mercs are slow: Maul, Zweihander, Messer, grand mace and more. Basically any slow weapon that's good in live is good in Mercs."
ChivalryGame,3cc588,ParkRangerStan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:22:31 2015 UTC,Srsly. Being slow isn't that bad in team fights. Slow usually means longer release time which can give you more time to target switch or even just hit multiple people with one swing. Zwei is amazing in team situations because of it's combination of retarded reach and super long release time letting you pull stuff like this off.
ChivalryGame,3cc588,CelebratoryCrouching,2,Tue Jul 7 15:21:35 2015 UTC,Mercs is a mod that just rebalances shit. Most (All?) competitive matches use Mercs.   So if you wanna be super elite cool-guy then get into Mercs and become the ultimate comp dude.
ChivalryGame,3cc588,ToLazy4Name,11,Mon Jul 6 19:49:09 2015 UTC,So you'd rather have fast weapons that can first hit flinch on reaction?
ChivalryGame,3cc588,NippleCannon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:28:50 2015 UTC,Therein lies the rub of why FHF wasn't a great solution for many people.

ChivalryGame,3cc588,NippleCannon,-3,Mon Jul 6 22:06:26 2015 UTC,You didn't know that Mercs is made by knights for knights?

ChivalryGame,3cc588,Mr_Jekyll_Dr_Hyde,2,Mon Jul 13 11:26:38 2015 UTC,I don't play competitively but having played the mod a lot I'd say overall they buffed maa and vanguard and nerfed knight.
ChivalryGame,3cc588,mobinstime,2,Mon Jul 13 17:01:53 2015 UTC,Basically its a mod for a specific group of players that wanted an advantage for their play style.    Most people play knight.  Maa gets a buff because of fhf and vanguard is mostly useless.  Keep Dodge but no charge was a decision I didn't understand.

ChivalryGame,3cazth,crimsonBZD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:48:49 2015 UTC,"I believe what you're experiencing is commonly known as Server FPS, or the update ticker, among other names.  Essentially, when playing on a server, you the client and the server relay information back and forth. When the server sends it out, it updates every client, then every client sends data back and that is processed and then every client is updated by the server again.  This is happening constantly as you play, many many times a second.  If you're playing on a dedicated server here, then the server has a low tick. If you're connecting to a friend's local machine, then his performance may be poor, as he is hosting and playing at the same time.  Keeping it very short and simple: If you have 60 FPS, and the other participant has 60 FPS, but the server is ticking at 30 FPS, then about half of what you do and see is being completely missed."

ChivalryGame,3c8qnu,ParkRangerStan,2,Tue Jul 7 07:37:18 2015 UTC,"I'd really like a feudal Japan, fast-paced katana dueling setting. Lots of quick and precise strikes and dodging. Watching that movie, '13 Assassins' really makes it look like it would be terrifying and totally badass. lots of cloth robes, little-to-no armor, sharp and  fast swords. Gore-fest. There are plenty of other classic-style weapons that were used plenty frequently by samurai as well as the stereotyped katana- Spears were apparently pretty common, as well as a range of different bows thrown weapons.   Basically, just the setting of 13 Assassins would be awesome for a game like chivalry. I'd like to see different ""stances"" or something for the swordplay- like you could have an aggressive or defensive stance that you could toggle between that was sort of like keeping an attack or a block ""half-chambered"". Either sword up-and-down far in front of you to more effectively catch and deflect incoming attacks, or pulled back, pointed straight forwards for more difficult parrying, but the ability to throw certain heavy attacks out more quickly with a slow wind-down after them."

ChivalryGame,3ca9wm,ParkRangerStan,5,Mon Jul 6 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"I had no idea people are complaining about Tempest being good. If they do, they must be very good at keeping it to themselves because I haven't gotten word of it. I remember when I was in Faucheur and we were dominant for at least a year, people never really complained to us saying ""Faucheur, you're too good, let other clans have some of your players to be fair"". Nah, I don't remember hearing that.   As for smaller clans ""getting gud"", it isn't easy to get each of their 6 main players to invest 1,000 hours into the game. Or at least enough to actually ""get gud"". And it doesn't happen right away. Look at Tempest, they failed to beat Faucheur time after time, in tournament after tournament. Then, one tournament, they beat em'. Why? That was their goal- to become the best and beat Faucheur. Perhaps another team will step up and become the new Tempest or Faucheur. Possibly Phoenix, or Syndicate- or any other clan that's willing to do what it takes. There are two ways you can get your clan to become Leet: 1. Get a ton of veteran leet players; this is the fastest way, obviously. 2. Practice your balls off and donate part of your life to Chivalry. To be as good as Tempest or Faucheur? I recommend doing both :)  At this point in the game's life, I don't think there are many new people- or people at all- that are willing to invest the time and effort to become as good as Tempest."

ChivalryGame,3ca9wm,alaskanranger,3,Mon Jul 6 13:26:51 2015 UTC,"The top 2 teams scooping up every good player they can find IS NOT good for the scene.

ChivalryGame,3ca9wm,Anstii,3,Tue Jul 7 00:42:30 2015 UTC,"I see both sides of the argument, but I had my own reasons for going there. They only have 1 archer on the whole team, so a backup is always nice, Skillz isn't on 24/7. I really like the guys here, I have a ton of fun hanging out with them playing other games. And I don't think me joining another team would help the team so immensely that they suddenly become a competitor with Tempest. I just did what I wanted and people were mad at me for it, which sucks I guess but I don't make those decisions for other people."

ChivalryGame,3c9syr,Kesby,2,Mon Jul 6 17:40:47 2015 UTC,"the game is pretty consistent actually, otherwise i wouldnt have like 3k hours playing it  What Reithur said is probably right, you have to understand how the hit collisions work on some weapons, especially as vanilla chivalry dosent have any handle hit tracers, this means that weps like the poleaxe/dubaxe/polehammer etc. might go through your opponent briefly before the ""head"" of the weapon actually hits them  stabs dont come from the middle of your screen, they come from the right side and poke into the middle aswell."
ChivalryGame,3c9syr,CodeineCowboy,0,Mon Jul 6 18:54:17 2015 UTC,"Being consistent in a broken wonky way that only people studying hit tracers would even understand is a poor measure, lol. This game could've taken off a lot more than it did if they spent more time on things like adding momentum based damage, preventing players from juicing their mouse sensi/DPI to by pass the drag system, ensuring good netcode or severely limiting the ability for laggy players to play with non-laggy players, and realistically by removing 3rd person thus creating a more balanced unified playing field, the game might still be taken seriously.  One can argue 3rd person is an option, but too many options breaks a community. If Counter-Strike was all unranked servers with mods galore differing from one server to the next and lack of official maps, it would've never became competitive. Much less with an official option that literally entire changes the dynamic of the game."

ChivalryGame,3c7g32,tyridge77,5,Sun Jul 5 18:17:51 2015 UTC,"Try to out-range shields and hit them while they're winding up.  Variety is the spice of chiv, don't riposte after every attack.  Let your feints stew for a while to give the guy time to react to it, you want the feint to last about as long as the enemies parry time.  Depends on how the facehugger is playing, you can kick to gain some distance to dance around or trade4days."

ChivalryGame,3c7g32,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Sun Jul 5 18:52:23 2015 UTC,"To get around shields, try to learn about z stabs and other drags that can help you get around them. Colonial Star has some good  tutorials on his channel. Shields have capped turnspeed and limited visibility while raised, making things like zstabs and waterfalls more effective against them. Don't try to bother too much with delayed drags against shields since they can just keep holding the shield up. Feint to heavy kick can open up shield users sometimes as well, but experienced shield users can lower their shield on reaction to avoid being stunned by the kick. You also have the option of just outranging them and forcing them to stam out, like the video that JusticeVvVBeaver posted, but that can also take a while.  One thing to make your ripostes harder to block is by accelerating them when you do them. So if you were doing an overhead riposte, you could look down while riposting to make it hit sooner, thus giving your opponent less time to react. Along with that, you need to mix up what you do after you parry an attack. If you're always riposting after you parry, your opponents will begin to expect it. Riposte when they don't expect it.  To make your feints more effective, apply the idea of accelerating attacks into your feints. A lookdown overhead feint is spookier than just an overhead feint. Also, try to only feint when in close range since feints are much easier to read from further away. If people keep reading your feints, just double feint. They read that, feint again lol. Multifeints aren't cheap stamina-wise, but most classes die in 2 hits from a lot of weapons making the stamina cost not matter as much in 1 on 1 situations. People outside of comp rarely put any effort into reading and more importantly, punishing feints by attacking while being feinted. Also worth noting, stab feints are stupid effective because the tracers effectively start inside your body basically giving you a tiny window of opportunity to read the feint if any window at all. So if you feel like lacing up the tryhard pants, spam stab feints with swords and bathe in the salty tears of your enemies.  If you aren't as good at fighting in close range, try to make sure that anytime you hit somebody or hit their parry that you're at the maximum range of your weapon. When you run into someone's face and get parried while you're nose to nose, you become the person getting facehugged and are much more susceptible to feints and other dumb stuff like backswings. Do your best to maintain space on the offensive so when you get put on the defensive you're not getting smothered.  Above all, don't take this game hella srs or you will go insane because it's broken and dumb"

I miss when you could run and jump kick, and it would shoot you way forwards.... that was dope. I'd always go for totally awesome flying jump kicks on people as a knight with my 2h swords... Jumping down whole flights of stairs and kicking some little man-at-arms bitch in the chest was so baller."

The notable difference between these two is that heavy kicks can stun people if you kick them while their shield is up. Heavy kick also has longer start up and is buggy and stupid inconsistent because this game is broken. Avoid using heavy kicks unless against a shield user."

ChivalryGame,3c7g32,-StopRefresh-,2,Sun Jul 5 18:29:51 2015 UTC,"well, best tip i can give you is to not get too frustrated, and understand that skill comes with time, regardless of whether it takes 30, 40, or 50 ranks, you get me? try to figure out how to improve on your weakness in game. it helps to stay positive and focus on what u learned from a bad fight. if you cant get around a shield, figure out why you cant and the best way to overcome it. will it take you getting used to using kicks, or getting used to dragging around shields, or using a weapon like a maul to drain them out? that's the gist of what i'm trying to tell you and you can apply the same way of thinking to other mechanics and aspects of the game. think of the broader picture, change up your style if it doesnt work, figure out what's going wrong, and work off it. and learning will come more easily. good luck and dont get frustrated with yourself or the game! it'll hinder your potential progress"
ChivalryGame,3c7g32,shackthemenace,2,Mon Jul 6 01:18:25 2015 UTC,"Shield are usually indicative of someone who didnt take the time to learn how to parry correctly and must rely on full on blocking with a shield. Scare them with some overheads and make them block then kick them, or attack a couple times to force a block, run away for like 10 steps and they usually instinctively try to chase you with lmb spam, in which case you can outrange them with a good swipe and combo/kick for another hit.   For knights with shields just try to stay out of range and work on beating down their stamina if they are good at dodging kicks, otherwise same thing as above but kick the shit outta them. the first hit is usually all you need to scare them, after that they will block a lot more esp if their screen is red, giving you the chance for a kick."

ChivalryGame,3c6d4a,CRUSHED1337,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:38:50 2015 UTC,"Eh. Without any snowball mechanic or exclusivity, weapons and classes do not affect the competitive balance, at all. Every change you make is available to every player, so again, there is still balance.  Am I missing something? Everything (weapon/class/mechanic) has its ups and downs, but at the end of the day whoever uses it best will win. Is that not balance?"
ChivalryGame,3c6d4a,Peasant420,3,Sun Jul 5 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"This would be true if everyone had the same weapon with one attack, same class and same mechanics. But thats not the case.  Also even if so, imagine if everyone had the same class and a sword of war that would oneshot with any of the 5 attacks. Would it be balanced? technically yes, but it wouldn't make for a good game."
ChivalryGame,3c6d4a,CRUSHED1337,-1,Sun Jul 5 22:35:36 2015 UTC,"Nah. This IS true. Everyone has the same access to the same weapons, the same attacks, and the same mechanics. The better players win. Team based Chivalry is balanced...  ... and as a result, stale. What you're describing as opinions on balance are actually opinions on the meta-game. Which is fine. There are a lot of legitimate concerns on the meta and the playstyle and what the ""character"" of Chivalry should be and feel like.   It just aint balance though, its not the same thing. Some ""broken"" mechanic might force everyone in a comp scene to use the same weapon, which isn't inherently imbalanced, just boring (like you said with the 1htk sow example). So you can try to balance that weapon, nerf it into the ground, and then do the same thing over again for the next best weapon, and the next best after that, and continue on until eventually every weapon is flavorless outside of its skin,  OR  you could not tunnel-vision on balance, and stop trying to make everything fair. If you don't want the meta to stagnate, limit the availability of OP-ness, but don't kill it all together.  You play CS, right? Imagine how much fun it would be with no buy system, just free weapons for everyone, no punishment or reward for kills outside of completing the objective. Sounds like shit, right? That is Chivalry right now. That is Chivalry's competitive community... right now. This second.  Ugh. Disgusting. This game is so balanced that it sucks."
ChivalryGame,3c6d4a,Peasant420,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:06:36 2015 UTC,"I actually recently was in a lobby with 3 devs. Funny thing is, the server wasn't even an official server. TBH they were pretty good, i was playing jav because i was in a jav fix at the time, so it was a bit harder to tell, but they were all on top of the boards for the most part and knew how to drag, feint, and cftp at appropriate. times. Now they would probably get stompted in comp, but i mean 98% of chivs users will get stomped in comp, sooo can you blame them? I see your point though, you wish they could get on a higher skill level to help balance the issues in competitive scrims, but can you really expect the devs to put 1.5k hours or more into a game they were once constantly working on, and now starting a new project? the only thing they can do is ask the comp scene and they did with surveys. I have faith that they are listening at this point."
ChivalryGame,3c6d4a,johnnyp1231,9,Mon Jul 6 02:00:40 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm Unborn. Sure lots of you know me, but I'll reintroduce myself.   I've been playing Chivalry since it was released on Steam. Started with playing with the subreddit community with players like Clayton, before moving to the team ia. Soon after, I organized and maintained that team which turned into the largest group in Chivalry with an impressive competitive track record. I've flat out recruited hundreds of members directly into the competitive scene, where ia served as a stepping stone to a ridiculous number of well known members. I've organized multiple tournaments myself and now serve as a caster/anaylast as well as an organizer for the larger chivalry tournaments.  The claims stinker makes here are filled with false and poor claims.   incredibly rich competitive environment both mechanically and in teamplay.   Really? Particularly in the early days of Chivalry, bugs were extremely detrimental. Dodge out of stun, broken server brwoser, crashing, super jumping, objectives breaking etc. Most of these have since been patched by the 'incompetent' tbs. The early days of Chiv also had a unorganized team-play element where the main appeal of comp scene was the appeal and nature of being in a 'clan' with 'clan-wars' - Something the scene of today shares little with. Saying it is incredibly rich is laughable.   rom what we've seen from them in the way of recent marketing decisions, it seems that they intend the game to be a casual hack-em-up cash-n-dash indie game laced with microtransactions   Unlike many  arguments here, I will point to the development of Chivalry to say why this isn't correct. Let me first state that TBS did go into a slump at one point where communication was low but have improved immensely.   Chivalry and Torn Banner vs. the money grubbing bastards - Early 2013 - Piggot   ""For us, our primary goal -- and I know people say this a lot but it’s actually true -- it’s not to make money; it’s to make awesome games.""  ""You can choose the way you do that. Different groups are emerging right now. People love all this kind of nickle-and-dime DLC, and everyone finds something that works for their business -- that's fine. I just think for us it’s more important that people are happy than they are constantly paying for this subscription model. We are still planning to do expansion packs that cost money, but we’ll always have free stuff for the community. You need to balance that stuff out. If you day one DLC people, they feel lied to and mistreated. We want people to be pumped up … we worked four months to do [our free expansion], that would have made more money if we charged for it, but we are investing in the long term by investing in our fans.  ""It really depends on the way it's done but it often seems moneygrubbing because that's what it is. They are headed by financial CEO wizards that are asking how to make money every day. I think people know which ones. But there are also companies that say, how do we make awesome games? It's about how can I get the most people excited about this.  ""We’ve been lucky with the success we had, but the success comes from getting to a point where we are so confident with how the game is that we can take those risks.""  ""I can’t make a solid commitment on the Mac version, but we are definitely doing the SDK. We are doing some polishing and stuff, but the SDK is definitely coming. I can’t say what our [250,000 and 500,000 Kickstarter stretch goals] were, because we might still do them. Our community patch and SDK is coming, then content update two. More free content and community content is coming, once we get the SDK tools out. We see a foundation. We have awesome gameplay, but we have so much we can do better and add on to the experience.""   -   This is something they actually have done. The kickstarter never reached these 'goals' yet tbs released the sdk (Something that has brought a lot of maps and game modes), customization, new ui, comp play support, etc.   Chivalry's lead developer explains why Torn Banner prioritised free content over paid DLC - Early 2013 - Piggot   In the end, tbs is still a company that has released one game but been going for years. The game started with very few TO mapsDLC is a necessity and tbs keeps them contained SOLELY in cosmetics. You don't see people yelling at valve for selling hats in dota2 or teams selling skins in game. The chivalry skins are also made from the community!  It's clear the focus of the dev team has moved away from chivalry for some time towards their next installment, but it's just wrong to say that greed and 'money grubbing' is the worst issue of tbs. Hell, the game didn't even have them for years. The claims tbs makes here have been maintained throughout chiv's history.   You guys have seen the way the playerbase works: ~1000-2000 ongoing players, spiking only when the game goes on sale and during free weekend before going back to its dormant state. And, instead of focusing on player retention and making smart executive decisions, they have in a sense decided to go down with the ship, turning to cash grabs and microtransactions as a source of income.    Steam charts for chivalry showing the actual player count.   ""We kept that snowball rolling with our free weekend. The other thing too, is that people like our game by letting them play it. We didn’t over-hype or have CGI trailers. We said, 'Here’s our game. Come play it!' and people did. It’s all about keeping that snowball going. The only time you risk sales through a free weekend is if you aren’t confident about the product.""   -  piggot in one of the interviews above. They maintain a pretty large community, bigger than most games that came out around it's time    In the case of Chivalry, that would be its combat system and in-depth competitive nature.    I agree that the combat system is unique, but it's competitive nature is not enjoyed by the vast majority of the player-base. At least int he form of teams and tournaments.  It's important but not the top reason for chiv to be important.   Cater to competitive play, sponsor tournaments and competitive streamers   We've seen them try this with disaster resulting. There isn't really any competive streamers. I would like to see tbs make the comp scene relevant to the masses in an announcement or something, but other than some simple ui things I don't think they have to do much else.   properly transfer it into UE4.   They have said chivalry will not be moving to UE4. An epic dev mentioned that it would be 'like making a whole new game' to port it like that, source: Interview between epic and piggot from a few weeks ago   The game would have died off long ago if it didn't have a loyal, albeit small, set of players who can see it for what it really is, and what it is really worth.   Well that sounds nice, it's just not true. The comp scene and vets are often seen as a reason to not get into the game on some occasions due to elitism. That has subsided significantly, but sales, maps,  communities, mods, marketing from users, the nature of the game, and the comp play come together to present why the game is still relevant.   could rival even the biggest e-sports giants   What stopped Chivalry from becoming big in the competitive scene and will a slasher-type game ever take off in that regard?   Thread from a week ago, give it a look over. Chivalry could never come even close to Starcraft, dota, CoD, csgo, etc. That post gives a few reasons but there are many more.  I just didn't like this 'lecture' so I wanted to respond to most the claims. People often just say outright lies when talking about chiv and use misinformation as evidence. It's important to remember that the silent majority exists. The subreddit may be the largest community for chiv still about. The comments you'll read on specialized outlets - like this  subreddit- will, to a point, overlap with those of the larger community. But they will be vastly blown out of proportion often."

ChivalryGame,3c6d4a,ClassicalFizz,8,Sun Jul 5 15:26:39 2015 UTC,"You need to cater to elite players while also catering to casuals. You need things to hook new players and make it fun for your average casual that doesn't play much while providing a competitive experience with alot of depth for people who got hooked onto the game and play it longer for 30,100 and 1000 hours. You need feedback from the elites if you want to properly balance your game and want new in-depth game mechanics that enhance the competitive nature of the game. Every single successfull multiplayer PVP game on Steam works this way (with some minor exceptions).  While you shouldn't cater to elites exclusively for various reasons, it wouldn't matter for Chivalry at all. Noobs in the low rank servers don't care and don't know the mechanics, if you changed some fundamental balance that would change the game completely for veterans, the low rank noobs wouldn't even notice.  As the creator of Mercs, I've learned this when we tried to make noobies play the mod. We've put it on pub servers and noobs never stuck around because it was always the same - they couldn't tell the difference between Mercs and Vanilla, even though the changes are huge for experienced players.  Now - are the elite players in Chivalry irrellevant for TBS? Probably, they dont make up a big part of the playerbase. Are elite players irrellevant if you want to keep a persistent playerbase more then 2000 players active at the same time? Absolutely not."

Poleaxes and polehammers weighed around as much as, if not a bit lighter than greatswords, and the reason THEY'RE anti-armor weapons and not 2-handed swords is because they have a focused mass at the HEAD of the weapon."

ChivalryGame,3c4p98,Jonks,8,Sat Jul 4 19:29:57 2015 UTC,All soldiers who could afford one almost always carried daggers as far back as I've seen; even Greek phalanx did (Or a shortish sword that was basically a dagger). It's much quicker and easier to jab with when the only openings in their armour are a couple milimeters wide.

I'm sure many of us on this sub have convinced friends to buy the game (or bought it for them) and found them to love many aspects about the game but quickly leave when they struggle to even kill one person for each of their ten deaths. New players should get steamrolled, but not to the extent that they find the game too frustrating to even play. And I think we all know that low rank servers are not a viable solution considering how many people quit upon reaching level 16.  EDIT: Also Germanic-Hunnic wars when"

However, it will bleed some users and if this is indicative of events to come then more and more will leave with time.  main problem is there isn't quite a clear alternative. people throw around voat but I'm not so sure people will jump ship. look at 4chan and 8chan: there was a bunch of drama on 4chan not too long ago and people tried to push an exodus to 8chan. but 8chan is nearly identical to 4chan so people stayed with 4chan where the userbase is still much larger. I predict it will be the same way with reddit and voat.  the digg -> reddit migration worked because not only had digg fully gone to shit, but also reddit was different enough for people to want to try something new, and new is fun and exciting."

Really, it depends on preference and the opposing team's composition.  Brandi = better vs knights  Spear = better vs vans, maa, and archers"
ChivalryGame,3byykz,Charles_K,2,Fri Jul 3 08:27:31 2015 UTC,"Brandi yolo-one shots MAA on headshot, so it has that too. But Spear is the clear winner against Vanguard in every way.  Brandi: Can drag out the slow thrust even further out, and some people find that harder to defend against. Two headshots kill a knight (not the most practical, but still there), one headshot kills MAA (much more feasible).  Spear: Broken fast LMB, good for flinches and riposte to build pressure. The LMB is really good at swatting MAA too. Faster overall while retaining same hit-to-kill for the most part. It has more reach, but not too much more; speed is the main reason to pick it up, cause it's not that much weaker than Brandi to make a difference in how many hits you need to kill someone most of the time. Just don't hit their legs, but spears have the most accurate-with-the-model tracers in this game, so that's not too hard. And Spear is a clear winner against Vanguards over the Brandi."
ChivalryGame,3byykz,Reithur,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:55:57 2015 UTC,"I used to have a hard time vs. brandi and spear as MAA, but then I fought Raw Boner and Rathion bunch of times and they're the only ones who give me trouble now."
ChivalryGame,3byykz,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, can't go wrong with either tbh. They are pretty even, though I have a few hundred hours of dueling/scrim experience with spear so I might be a little bias lol. If I could hit headshots really well with brandi I would probably just use that, but it's pretty hard to score headshots with the bad turnspeed and sp00ky tracers compared to the animation, and if you miss it's gg for you."

ChivalryGame,3bwjst,UnanimatedFelix,8,Thu Jul 2 19:06:21 2015 UTC,"Not sure what it's called but the one where you need to bring the flag to the dude in the boat is hard as hell for offense in a pub for a few reasons:  1) half the time a lv 8 maa will grab the flag and die surely but slowly. This wastes so much time for agatha and negates and good pushes that are made.  2) as an objective it really requires teamwork from offense to move in a coordinated way  3) the way to do it really relies on some good players. I've seen it done a few times, and every time there was: high ranked knight with flag escorted by 2-3 other high ranked players. You get a flag knight, a van with a brandi and a knight with a maul and you've got enough power in that combo to keep the defense at bay while your team does random shit that may or may not be helpful.  also archers are pretty crucial to the objective. If offense has significantly better archers than defense you can effectively take the opposing 4 archers practically out of play, as well as make any engages for the flag carriers much easier.  Naturally, having this is pretty rare, and even then it's not a shoe in"
ChivalryGame,3bwjst,Gnarlyfoodman,2,Thu Jul 2 19:58:06 2015 UTC,Yea shore is retarded. The entire map is a big bottleneck and the last stretch is all but impossible in a pub environment.
ChivalryGame,3bwjst,BCJunglist,2,Thu Jul 2 21:24:29 2015 UTC,"Can we just say that the map makes no sense strategically? You kill peasants and burn down some houses, you break into the castle and smash some statues, and then you take their flag and leave on a boat....?...What?  I still like the map because I enjoy most TO maps, but the objectives just seem half-baked ideas by a TB intern."
ChivalryGame,3bwjst,blackhawk5322,2,Fri Jul 3 18:48:43 2015 UTC,"yea ill agree with that, although truth be told I do not require any sort of context for the objectives to have fun beheading fuckers.  i mean, in belmez you spend most of the time trying to destroy their flags on the wall and then replacing them with your own.... but its not like its the keep its just the fucking gate house, and the real objective is to free feydrid from his cell, so why are they fucking about with flags on a castle wall?  because it provides a reason to hack people arms off, thats why."
ChivalryGame,3bwjst,BCJunglist,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:10:30 2015 UTC,I mean really. Had a funny conversation with randies in a pub playing that map. It's not hard to make a new flag. Let them fucking take it.

ChivalryGame,3bx1uo,Reithur,2,Thu Jul 2 21:34:28 2015 UTC,"Drag attacks can be accelerated or delayed to trick you into parrying too late or too early.   Try to be ready for either and try to block delayed drags at the last moment; maul or zweihander drags can last for a really long time.   This is not an easy game to learn to play well, but it is really rewarding to learn and use new techniques, or finally figure out how to defend yourself against difficult attacks.   Feel free to ask questions!"
ChivalryGame,3bx1uo,Strobepomf,3,Thu Jul 2 22:52:53 2015 UTC,"Take everything I say with a grain of salt because I'm also a noob, but range plays a huge part in this game. Don't forget about being able to kick people away from you if you get to close. Try to abuse your longer range against MAA/archers if you can."
ChivalryGame,3bx1uo,gregmolick,2,Thu Jul 2 22:36:01 2015 UTC,Those moves still kind of elude me with me being rank 38. But I feel lately I can replicate them and use them.   Basically what they're doing when it seems like they jerk their head and body real fast they're just looking up/down/left/right really fast before swinging. You could give the illusion you know how to do those moves if you just fling your mouse around on the keyboard before attacking. Throw a crouch or jump in there too. The real skill to it is learning to refocus your strike after wildly twisting and turning. After doing it a lot you will naturally get a feel for how your sword swings around when your body makes certain motions.

ChivalryGame,3but1g,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Thu Jul 2 10:06:10 2015 UTC,"Seems interesting but too complex, and looks like crap.  I've been saying this forever, but the next big melee game should allow you to customize how you fight, similar to how you choose skins.   There should be 20 different attacks for each weapon that you can select 5-6 of to develop your own style of fighting. Or just have a few pre-set styles for each weapon, like fighting stances that may open up faster attacks in one area, but cause other attacks to take longer to execute. This could easily be done by reworking combo times and such.  Reverence just looks too complex."
ChivalryGame,3but1g,HEXENACI,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:08:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for instance, I love the fact that using the buckler changes stab animations and where the weapon hits, I'm not sure why they didn't make this far more widespread (a man at arms should wield a broadsword differently to a knight, using a kite shield with a sword of war should be used differently to using a sword of war in one hand without a shield, yada yada)."

ChivalryGame,3brbz0,mikach01,3,Wed Jul 1 18:12:47 2015 UTC,I tend to play more conservatively since CFTP and comboing are completely out of the picture. That and along with most fights I had were team fights/2+ vs. 1. I just think playing aggressive with the fork can get you killed way faster since the damage is so low.

ChivalryGame,3bpzn6,Strobepomf,6,Wed Jul 1 16:24:26 2015 UTC,"if you want to learn fighting mechanics and improve your time to death, join a duel server. If you want to work as a team with other people to work towards a common goal, go join a team objective server. I would recommend you avoid low rank servers, since everyone there will be LMB spamming and you may learn some hard to break habits.  I don't mess around on duel servers much, but that is were some of the best fighters hang out, so if you want to get better, observe the best players. study their movements, watch when they parry, look at when they feint. go into first person mode, watch where they are aiming.   The key to the combat system is that damage is done at the tip of each weapon, and damage can be blocked only by parrying the tip of the blade. By feinting, looking into or away from an attack, looking up or down, good players can change the speed of their weapon, making the damaging phase of an attack hit sooner, later, or not at all. Going to a duel server will help you improve your understanding of these mechanics. Once you have a solid grasp of them you will be better than the majority of the player base."

ChivalryGame,3bpzn6,Charles_K,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:40:55 2015 UTC,"It might help to practice a few moves over and over during a match or even against bots. When I was just starting out I got frustrated and practiced against bots only. I tried out interesting moves I learned from YouTube vids over and over until it felt easy. For instance, over cranking your swing wind up and poking the enemy from over your shoulder. But you don't have to play bots, most people would say not to. Honestly if you just pay attention to what others are doing and replicate it then you'll end up knowing why they do what they do. Then you'll be better at playing mind games with people and using their same moves against them."
ChivalryGame,3bpzn6,KloobzZ,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:52:22 2015 UTC,"Also, I like to fight with a team beside me personally but I believe that's a different type of skill versus one on one duels. Although I'm pretty good at dueling too I would say my strong point is target switching and assisting teammates. To get some hardcore training under your belt go to the classic duel servers. Players usually will teach you the ways if your willing to learn. Just make sure you bow before starting a duel."

Billhook stab is now .65 from .625? Don't know if I'm reading it right but I liked it at SoW stab speed, seemed fair to me. I'd rather nerf the OH on the billhook which is pretty retarded tbh and is the real issue with the weapon. Maybe some slower combos.  Messer is a bit better now which idk if I like, I don't want any more spin to wins with that goddamn weapon. The lmb for sure should not have been buffed. I'll probably be using that from now on as a knight.  Norse OH combo time is good now because I hated the intentional misses with the the stab into the OH where you couldn't parry the second strike in time.

ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,kr1sk0ng,4,Wed Jul 1 00:21:31 2015 UTC,"Well what class do you play? Furthermore, you don't have to embrace the God of Broken Backs to play with the big boys, if anything try feinting to step up your game. Lots of high levels in TO won't expect it, but be warned, do not feint lower levels as they don't care they just attack for the sake of attacking and you will end up during more that way.  Furthermore, if you haven't already maybe try out a different weapon. I used to play mainly archer and a few different knight weapons but once I found the halberd through a friend the game just kind of clicked with me and its play style really complimented my own and I would have never known if I hadn't just given something new a try."
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,ia_Flame,2,Wed Jul 1 00:27:10 2015 UTC,"I primarily play vanguard with claymore. I now it's crappy, but i've been playin it since 2012. I really love the claymore, but feinting seems to do nothing to higher levels in my experience. I also find myself once I join a game, I check the teams for which one has the highest level players and join that team because chances are it is stacked and the other team isn't going to do crap. Thanks for your reply man. I'll get back into the game."
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,ia_Flame,2,Wed Jul 1 00:31:54 2015 UTC,"While feinting try to do it as late as possible and while up close to really sell the feint. I also suggest trying out the greatsword and working on drags, they are almost essential to beating higher levels at the very least. The claymore doesn't give you much flexibility and it is a one trick pony with its speed. Try out a weapon that's more versatile and see how you can work with it."
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,Chuckdatass,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:42:21 2015 UTC,We call that a deep feint... balls deep
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,Stael,2,Wed Jul 1 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"claymore is shit, consider getting good with zweihander, halberd or spear if you want a top tier vanguard weapon  polehammer, greatsword, billhook and brandistock are decent too"
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,ia_Flame,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:40:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do halberd in vanilla as a starting weapon for fine tuning your skill, a lot harder to use in vanilla compared to the others but I agree try out a more versatile weapon."
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,MadTapirMan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:49:25 2015 UTC,"I play vanguard with spear weapons a lot, what exactly makes the brandistock and the spear different, other than the slight speed/dmg difference?"
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,Stael,0,Wed Jul 1 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"Brandi deals a lot of damage but can't hit as many people in a teamfight as spear can in the same amount of time  Brandi has better stamina drain and can win the stamina war in duels, where spear will only stam the opponent out if they misplay  Brandi is less forgiving with misses and often requires you to flinch multiple people to avoid trading, where spear will have more room for parrying  Overall spear is much more responsive than brandi, while brandi has better htks. Spear is a tempo playstyle where brandi is more control-oriented.  If you're good with brandi you will be able to deal a lot of damage utilising your range, supposing your team is making sure you don't get swapped to and 2-htked by sow knights. You will have to watch your positioning a lot and will be weak on defense.  A good spear player will be utilising range and speed to make swaps and essentially hitting the entire team. You won't be focusing on dealing damage as much as forcing the enemy team to dedicate a lot of attention to defending against you.  I prefer spear because of its responsiveness, and though both weapons are viable I think spear outclasses brandistock in top tier play"
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,MadTapirMan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:19:24 2015 UTC,"Alright, gonna give spear another chance then. I played since level 15 or so with basically only brandi, even though I'm fairly good on it I think, I'll try and see if I'm not even better on the spear."
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,4,Sun Jul 5 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"That's your problem.  You play in TO servers and play with claymore. I don't want to shit on your playstyle because I don't really know you but you are not going to get any better playing with that weapon and if you really want to improve your fighting skills, you should hop on a duel server and play longsword or something. I say longsword because it's pretty standard and balanced and can teach you pretty much everything you need to know, be it drags, feints, parrying -- something you can't really practice well with a claymore in a TO server.  This game will probably be dead before you hit your ceiling. Players have been around for a few years and thousands of hours and are still getting better. You just have to train efficiently."
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,Chuckdatass,2,Wed Jul 1 03:28:01 2015 UTC,I feel like the great sword can be like the long sword for vanguard as far as learning. Can be fast or slow and isn't cheap.
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,MadTapirMan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:15:48 2015 UTC,"Hm, I'm only level 27, but I can consistently catch level 40+ player off guard with feints when I use my brandistock. In TO I get my kills the same way a lot, land one or two stabs, with feints if need be, and then run past them and hit them with an lmb swing to the head. Adds insult to injury too, getting your head SMASHED OFF by a lower level player with a brandistock. Really though, lot's of people just don't expect you to bitchslap them with your stick when they are on low hp."
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,ToLazy4Name,2,Wed Jul 1 13:37:31 2015 UTC,Go hang out in a Classic Duels server and get some of the normal high level guys there to spar with you.   Getting your ass kicked is the best way to git gud.

ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,Reithur,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:12:03 2015 UTC,True. I need 11k kills to get to 50 and I'm just over 48 now. Rank 40 is almost 25k behind me.

That's a real bummer if it feels you've hit a ceiling. I personally love the funky swings because I also enjoy trying to block them and see them coming. It just adds a whole nother level of gameplay. Feels like I'm neo sometimes fighting agents.
ChivalryGame,3bp3oy,feeeggsdragdad,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:09:22 2015 UTC,Claymore is kinda shite in TO unless your just finding 1v1s or flanking. Wheres the black helm hype?  I remember going through the same stuff when i was around your rank. Try to be less serious about how you are doing in a game and just have fun. When else can you have giant medieval battles where you get to play as a knight or vanguard soldier? It helped me to think more about my part in the giant war between to agathans and masons to have a bit more fun. What also helped is rebinding the scoreboard across the keyboard to something hard to reach so im not checking it every second.

ChivalryGame,3blegd,Tongfa,14,Tue Jun 30 04:11:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to use them for. If you want to actually get kills and make a difference in a team fight, use axes. If you want to interrupt archers as you approach, use knives. If you want to not be a poosay and rely on skilless throwables ftw, use smokepots. :)"
ChivalryGame,3blegd,TobiwanK3nobi,2,Tue Jun 30 09:03:04 2015 UTC,Smoke pots make every battle crazier. It can turn a group fight into a swing for your life and get out alive type of fight.
ChivalryGame,3blegd,gregmolick,7,Tue Jun 30 15:00:05 2015 UTC,I prefer knives. They seem to be more responsive. But axes aren't too bad. With the choice I would take knives. More room for error to interrupt an incoming attack or archer.
ChivalryGame,3blegd,TNGSystems,4,Tue Jun 30 12:05:39 2015 UTC,axes. knives do too little damage for them to be viable. If you land an axe you can quickly switch to your main and finish the job with one more blow.
ChivalryGame,3blegd,jkohatsu,3,Tue Jun 30 05:04:56 2015 UTC,"To kill a knight from full, you have to hit 2 axes to the head, and 4 knives to the head. Which sounds easier to you?"

ChivalryGame,3blegd,Oskoff,4,Tue Jun 30 11:51:19 2015 UTC,"You raise a good point. When I throw, it's usually on someone I'm about to engage, rather than someone who has already been engaged. It's all a matter of a opinions."
ChivalryGame,3blegd,kapanee,5,Tue Jun 30 12:25:52 2015 UTC,Axes because they hit harder. Its easier to get picks with them. I also find that they are easier to aim since they have more momentum and can travel farther.
ChivalryGame,3blegd,SaltyIngredients,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:59:52 2015 UTC,"Axes 100%  You can always pick up more before the engagement and end up tossing 4-5, plus they do a lot more damage than knives."

ChivalryGame,3blegd,SaltyIngredients,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:47:49 2015 UTC,Whisper in particular likes knives more because he'll back up after fighting someone and finish them off with knives. Also with mercs the 1hk to archers in the head makes them even more viable.
ChivalryGame,3blegd,TheGiantGlobEater,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:10:33 2015 UTC,Axes all the way! Love using them to finish off an opponent then pick them back up for the next scuffle
ChivalryGame,3blegd,ProfessorCaptain,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:12:43 2015 UTC,axes are clearly the winner. knives are kind of little flinchers and you COULD get a kill off them alone if you hit all 4 but it's way harder. If you are in a pub and have some friends all with knives they're pretty dirty ... but axes are way stronger and cooler because they have more weight to them.
ChivalryGame,3blegd,Clayton-BigsB,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:59:12 2015 UTC,"I like axes.  A lot of people have talked about the damage, but I also think it's nice because Knights don't have access to Knives anyway, and I prefer Firepot to Knives on MAA.

ChivalryGame,3birsg,aStarving0rphan,11,Mon Jun 29 15:51:35 2015 UTC,"Nah it's always been 50% rule, you could run like 3-4 archers depending on whether it's 6v6 or 8v8 but you may not want to because you kind of need a strong melee front line (knights, vans etc). Unless the rules of the tourney specifically say only 1 archer allowed, it's always been 50% rule for any class. I believe it's just the fact that most may put a 1 archer limit within the specific rules of the tournament, but to my knowledge if not stated, it's 50%. I used to see at least double archers in old-school comp and I'm pretty sure there's been a skillz/pnobio or skills/xale combo before.  archers are not fun to go against in general. It's pretty much the main reason I don't play vanguard else I totally would. I can't deal with getting plucked for 99 damage all the time, even though you feel damn near just as squishy as a knight these days. Archers pretty much just take the fun out of the game, low risk very high reward 2ez."
ChivalryGame,3birsg,Clayton-BigsB,2,Mon Jun 29 16:02:27 2015 UTC,"Yep, it has always been the 50% rule for every class except for some tournaments with special rules.    I actually stopped playing because the 50% rule was too limiting on strategies and it made the game stale.  Team Objective would be a lot more fun if there wasn't a 50% rule.  There would be way more strategies for certain objectives and it would make the game a lot more fun.     I'm okay with the 50% rule and other limitations in LTS because without them you could easily get into coin flip compositions in a round, but that doesn't matter in TO because you can switch classes at any time and you take turns attacking and defending."

ChivalryGame,3birsg,Peasant420,5,Tue Jun 30 18:14:28 2015 UTC,"I may be late to the conversation, but I love shoving my opinion down the throats of r/chivalrygame.  ""not balanced/not competitive"":   No mechanical imbalance has a strong enough influence to substantially determine the OUTCOME of a match. It might affect the way people play, but the team that leverages these imbalance the best will win. This is especially true in Chivalry's competitive state with Counter Strike style of swapping sides, and pre-designed counters for many weapons/classes.  ""not fun"": This is probably your best argument, and I KIND OF agree, but a mechanical change or limitation on strategy is neither fun nor effective at eliminating the annoyance of archers. Something Chivalry seriously lacks, which would improve balance, competition, and fun, are maps deliberately designed for competitive play. New maps designs MUST take into account movespeeds, htks, chokes, and open ground etc. Also, a critical aspect of creating balanced maps is the availability of multiple pathing options. Counter stike doesn't have just one single path to the objective, and for a reason, to avoid stagnating the meta. There is more than one way to win every other comp game, sc2, dota, cs, etc. but only one way in chiv: the objective. Tournaments would benefit from having both LTS and TO and maybe even TDM in the map pools, since nobody is going to make new maps anyway and there are already enough balanced LTS maps.  Edited a bit.   tldr: Doesn't matter, maps solve all of chivalry's problems."
ChivalryGame,3birsg,ParkRangerStan,6,Mon Jun 29 22:32:21 2015 UTC,"The rule always used to be 1 archer limit, however that was in live and before the archer nerf. The reasoning here is that archers are balanced now, so they should be treated like any other class- adhering to the 50% rule. This being said, some people say the archer class can never be balanced because of the lack of counters that each class has for it. However, since archers are in the game, and not going anywhere, they were balanced so as to not make them useless- yet not overpowered. However, the strength of a class (or weapon) and whether or not it's broken, are two separate things. Thus, archers can be broken without being a strong class. It's the very principle of how they function in this game that makes some people say they're broken. I don't really know how archers function in Slasher, but given that Crushed likes the game, I imagine they're not like the ones in Chivalry."

ChivalryGame,3birsg,DFA_Joe,6,Mon Jun 29 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"Not going to bother reading the other comments, but double archer rapes me all the time.

If there was more clan parity, some proper counters could be played. I had so much more fun watching the matches that didn't include Tempest this weekend (e.g. M vs. FC)."
ChivalryGame,3birsg,Palaceer,4,Tue Jun 30 17:14:26 2015 UTC,"double archer can be pretty good if both archers are on point, especially when defending, but I wouldn't call it OP in mercs. it's just not fun for anyone on the other team. unfortunately, you don't really have to engage in any melee as an archer if you don't want to, that's just the way archers are designed. so if the other team is double archer and they're shooting you a bunch you're gonna get salty because you're not really getting outplayed, the players killing you are just pointing and clicking. it's also not fun to play on the team that has two archers either, because your melee just crumbles in a 4v5 and then your archers hopefully finish them off. super boring."
ChivalryGame,3birsg,KoalabearJesty,4,Tue Jun 30 00:17:14 2015 UTC,"having 2 archers gimps your whole team anyway, RK used to play 5 melee and would still stomp EU teams. imo it doesn't matter the team set up, the better team will always win, so what if 2 archers carry, they could just be much better at the game than you."
ChivalryGame,3birsg,Anstii,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:46:56 2015 UTC,You're 100% correct but people won't admit it. Everyone just thinks by playing 2 archers = win when that's absolutely false. Especially on attacking. If it's so broken why didn't we do it in finals in the tourney?
ChivalryGame,3birsg,Charles_K,2,Mon Jun 29 20:08:59 2015 UTC,"DOUBLE ARCHER  Use fucking shields. You don't need throwables when you outnumber their melee 5v4 or even 6v4. Yes, this includes FIREPOT. Give up the fucking firepot, use a shield. Holy shit, suddenly two of their most carcinogenic players are now a significantly smaller threat to you. No shields aren't 100% foolproof, but you can just have them out to make the archers' jobs much harder; if they aren't tagging you constantly THROUGH THE SHIELDS (pretty hard), they are worth less than a melee slot.  Use smoke pots. Then, when archers kill the particles to shoot through them, demand that they screenshot the smoke at the end of the tournament match BEFORE THEY DISCONNECT, otherwise push that shit and disqualify them. Oh, and use smoke pots hehehe.  Yeah, double archers sort of drain the fun for everyone except themselves lol. It's beatable though."
ChivalryGame,3birsg,ia_Flame,4,Wed Jul 1 06:36:00 2015 UTC,"As said a lot in the comments, the one archer limit was a vanilla implementation; however, the general consensus with Mercs decided archers were properly nerfed to allow them to be only limited by the 50% rule. This ruling was voted upon as I was there, but it did not get the proper attention it should have as not everyone is always in the loop.   Archers in Mercs are now extremely susceptible to Melee often being one hit killed by a variety of weapons from all classes including some one handers and if they aren't one shot another plethora of weapons put archers within kick health after the first hit.  Furthermore, projectile damage was nerfed considerably and more counter arching measures were implemented so even novice archers can kill higher tier archers with weapons like the long bow and short now that give more room for error with more shots and a higher fire rate while retaining a possible one hit kill on another archer.  So, in a match, you will only benefit from a double archer set up if you are countering a mainly vanguard based team or your archers are skilled enough to actually warrant losing an entire Melee player. I don't think it is fair to say archers are still over powered as at this point the people complaining are only the ones who don't want archers in the game in the first place.   A variety of countermeasures can also be used such as shields, playing your own archer and of course smoke pots all of which anstii covered.  And it is because of these changes in mercs that double archer is more acceptable than before."

We properly balanced archers in mercs so we removed the rule and made it 50% like the other classes. If you're a vanguard then it just really sucks but you can't make a class limit because 1 class has no shield. We've ran double archer against teams who use smoke and shields and ended up making us sub 1 archer and switch with a melee because they countered us properly. It's not unfair and it's not broken, you just have to counter it. As for coming into the engagement weak, that's the archers job lol. If you have 2 sub par archers on a team lineup then they won't likely have a big enough impact to even help the melee."

Pretty sure 1archer limit was based on LTS back when that was the big scrim trend. I personally think it needs to be reviewed and voted on because it completely ruins maps like dark forest and stone hill which are main comp maps
ChivalryGame,3birsg,Anstii,3,Mon Jun 29 16:24:42 2015 UTC,"It was reviewed and voted on. Since archers were properly rebalanced in mercs mod, they aren't broken and unfair so why limit them?

ChivalryGame,3birsg,J-P_,3,Mon Jun 29 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"What parameters make something broken or balanced? Is it OP? Or is it counter play? From what I can tell, double archer is one of those things that can still be very powerful due to the fact that you still only can counter archer with another archer. Weaker teams are already at a disadvantage because elite archers are few and far between. The problem is, only anecdotal evidence exists as far as which team uses what set up to beat another(example how maa can counter weaker team archers). Double archer (3 archers in 8v8 formats) has always caused a shift in play which leads to a steepening entry curve for new teams as well as being less enjoyable to watch. And the reason I brought up the other changes, was so you could eloquently explain how bad ideas need reverting. Archer is like the sticky launcher demo man of chivalry. Sure it can be dealt with, but it causes too many lame shifts in play."
ChivalryGame,3birsg,Chuckdatass,2,Mon Jun 29 17:56:47 2015 UTC,Yes. I totally agree with you. Something that can't be directly countered by a knight and isn't even worth countering is op.  Or maybe if someone's stupid enough to go double archer you force at least one of them to change by wrecking their melee. I've never had a problem going against double archers even on vanilla. Archers also tend to eat on each other's effectiveness unless maybe if they have two completely different playstyles like javs and crossbows.

Literally no one else ran 2 archers in scrims or tournies, and most of the time it was an implied or stated rule.

It lacks the range to hit maa and lacks damage vs knights. Everything that claymore offers vanguard is available in the shortsword, so I would not primary with it.  Since you're new, I recommend using great sword as vanguard and long sword as knight. They're both good enough to be effective in comp and also limited enough to force you to learn the mechanics without the ""shortcuts"" of having biggest range, biggest speed, or biggest damage.

ChivalryGame,3bjw9j,Charles_K,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:33:45 2015 UTC,"Probably the best dueling weapon solely due to its broken speed and unreadable feints (Knight absolutely has to beat you in the stamina battle lol, it is still long + fast enough to catch MAA doops, and yeah it's ridiculously good vs Vanguard 1v1), among the worst teamfight weapons for Vanguard though solely due to Knights being hard to kill (not necessarily bad, it's just that the other Van weapons are so ridiculously good). Quarterstaff and SoW are really the only competitors for being better in duels."
ChivalryGame,3bjw9j,Peasant420,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:41:16 2015 UTC,"I pretty much completely disagree. It's just a shit weapon. You can spam feints and combos forever with clay, but a good knight will read or trade and a good man at arms will ALWAYS have a range advantage in duels. Whatever speed advantage you have with a claymore is negated by very minimal effort footwork + longer range."

ChivalryGame,3bjw9j,ToLazy4Name,3,Mon Jun 29 22:35:42 2015 UTC,It's all preference
ChivalryGame,3bjw9j,Zexis,3,Mon Jun 29 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"Pretty much all or all VG weapons are longer, they have more drag-ability, and the class has more movement speed in both acceleration and in top speed, also the best matrix and dodge class out of the two. Vanguards also have more knockback, meaning if you hit someone with an attack or they parry your attack, they bounce back farther than other classes might throw you which allows you to create space and keep your range advantage. Plus, they typically drain a good bit more stamina.  Knights have more resistance (not HP, pretty sure everyone has same stam and health pools but the resistance to weapon damage is what matters) so they can take more damage from melee, still have hard hitting weapons but they are the slowest class and movement speed does factor in. They still can drag a lot of their long release weapons and even the shorter ones as you can drag anything really (even daggars as other classes can be dragged). The best thing imo about knights and why i prefer playing it is basically the chance that I MIGHT be able to take an arrow and live.  all in all its about preference and what your play style is."

ChivalryGame,3bhlzh,Seriou,4,Mon Jun 29 12:03:23 2015 UTC,"Watch the tutorial videos. The players you describe are using the very edges of their attacks to get you. They have practised the timing and positioning and will try to hide their attack animations from you by twisting away while winding up.  Best advice I can give is to be aware of it, try to keep your distance a bit, and move in to strike while they are in recovery or wind up, or wait until they run out of stamina (kicks can help).  You'll get better at reading these attacks with practise.  Edited for formatting.  Damn phone."
ChivalryGame,3bhlzh,Reithur,7,Wed Jul 1 05:21:17 2015 UTC,"The thing about reversals on most weapons is they offer an extreme offensive edge on your opponent while risking their defense in most cases, if you manage to parry one of their attacks (which shouldn't be extremely hard after a bit of training but can prove to be difficult in some cases) they're put at a massive disadvantage, because in order to pull off these attacks they have to face pretty much directly away from you in most cases, leaving them wide up to a riposte/fake-out, while on the hand you could simply backpedal or sprint in the opposite direction and queue up an attack while they're still in release, which means if they can't combo feint to parry they will most likely get hit.  I would recommend not using reverses until you perfect the basics because in most cases it can stunt your ability to improve.  edit:    in most cases"
ChivalryGame,3bhlzh,Koiuki,2,Mon Jun 29 15:22:47 2015 UTC,You say they put you at a disadvantage with range and missing but all you need to do is turn around regardless if you hit the opponent or not and what will happen is even if they try to parry they might not catch it in time and either get hit by the reverse or have the reverse go through the parry without doing damage only to catch the opponent on the full turn. This makes reverses a pretty end all be all mechanic and sure you can counter them but it just makes the game so much more skill less as even rank 20s can pick up on this and crutch on them and further spreading this style of play where all I see are people constantly swinging in circles while I just stand back as they don't even know if I'm Near them they just know if I come in to attack more likely than not their spam will hit me at least once even if I try to parry it correctly due to the ability to simply follow through the reverse into a regular overhead or lmb
ChivalryGame,3bhlzh,ia_Flame,4,Mon Jun 29 09:30:59 2015 UTC,That was a really long sentence
ChivalryGame,3bhlzh,thefranchise23,0,Mon Jun 29 13:15:14 2015 UTC,When I'm on mobile I don't use periods or the like often just kinda type it and move on
ChivalryGame,3bhlzh,ia_Flame,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"This is one of the big reasons I don't like them. They require very little precision because you don't even have to hit with the reverse, you can just turn around and hit with the actual overhead if you miss (reverse lmbs are even easier). The person spinning doesn't even have to know if they're going for a real or fake reverse ahead of time but the person trying to block sure does. Yeah they'll miss some and probably stam out if the fight goes on too long but this play-style is mostly used with highly damaging weapons, so they only need to land 1 or 2 out of all the attacks they spam. Add to that the fact that reverses are the fastest attack in the game and you get a much too effective play-style for gambling with."
ChivalryGame,3bhlzh,mobinstime,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:48:28 2015 UTC,"You could also dodge some bad reversals, especially if the player goes full retard with them and does a bunch of spins in a row, expecting you to just stand there and eat it all up."

ChivalryGame,3bhlzh,vilezoidberg,2,Mon Jun 29 21:18:07 2015 UTC,"I don't like it either, but it's pretty easily dealt with.  If you see someone crouch and turn away, you know what's coming next."
ChivalryGame,3bhlzh,Sergeeeek,3,Tue Jun 30 06:45:38 2015 UTC,Sometimes they fake reverse or miss on purpose and drag it back into you.

ChivalryGame,3bc6wm,ouchidied,6,Sat Jun 27 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about joining a clan so soon because most clan members are higher levels. You should jump into the regular servers before you reach level 16 so you can get used to it quicker. After a short time you won't even look back at the low level servers because you'd just feel bad wrecking them. Also, to learn the most efficient ways to fight join classic duel servers. High levels are usually willing to teach a thing or two. Just make sure you bow before starting a duel."

ChivalryGame,3bc6wm,vilezoidberg,4,Sun Jun 28 00:41:19 2015 UTC,Classic Duels are just FFA servers where everyone agrees to duel.  Bowing is just a motion to signal you're willing to duel.  You bow by looking at your feet.

Just use and do what you want.  They're working on something, but we don't know what.  The game's not ""dying"" but it's certainly not thriving. The high skill-ceiling means this game has a shit player-retention rate. It appears to have about 2000 players at any time of the day."

The game is really good and there's nothing like it, i complain about shit a lot and so do others but it's mostly because I do like the game and i want it to play well.

ChivalryGame,3bc6wm,johnnyp1231,3,Wed Jul 1 16:31:30 2015 UTC,I met someone in a lobby and he offered the teach me something. He was swinging a maul like a methhead who shotgunned 10 red bulls. Someone called it dragging. Is that a thing?
ChivalryGame,3bc6wm,crimsonBZD,3,Sun Jun 28 03:24:32 2015 UTC,"Controllable, directional attacks (we call it Dragging) is one of the key features that separates this game from games like Mount and Blade.  There are some really good tutorial videos that describe this (link is from the /r sidebar)."
ChivalryGame,3bc6wm,Reithur,3,Sun Jun 28 13:41:54 2015 UTC,"It is! Maul users typically do overhead dragging. To do accelerated overhead, look at the floor and do an overhead swing, but you may notice that it reduces the range, so you have to either get super close to your opponent or don't look toooo far down when you swing. Crouching helps too but can be situational, comes with practice .  Do do a slow motion type drag, you crouch while looking up at the sky when performing the overhead. This typically will hit the opponent at the end of your swing while the accelerated drag(looking down) hits them at earlier. The benefit of the look up drag is that often people will parry too soon, the look down drag benefits by people parting too late.  The trick to maul is to trick your opponent or make them make their own mistakes then punish with a drag."
ChivalryGame,3bc6wm,crimsonBZD,3,Sun Jun 28 13:50:34 2015 UTC,"As a new player with the steam sale as well, I think the weapons you should be shooting for (If playing Knight) are the Messer (3rd Longsword) and the Bearded Axe (3rd Axe.) These are my favorite Knight weapons followed closely by the Maul (however that shit is super slow, an overhead swing will 1 hit kill ANYTHING.)  For Vanguard, I recommend the Billhook and/or the first weapon in that row. Vanguards are very strong offensively IMO, but if you get in-between them and their weapon and can start blocking their hilt, you can seriously punish the next mistake they make."
ChivalryGame,3bc6wm,gregmolick,3,Sun Jun 28 00:26:16 2015 UTC,"Best tip for new vanguards is don't charge attack into your allies backs!  Once your charge attack is ready, you don't have to use it; you can simply stop sprinting (let go of Shift) to cancel it."

ChivalryGame,3berf2,ToLazy4Name,13,Sun Jun 28 15:46:00 2015 UTC,"Feinting isn't a cheap trick, but if someone needs to use it to kill a rank 23 then you're either really good for your rank or they're trying a bit too hard.   Regardless, better get used to it."
ChivalryGame,3berf2,Turo2014,3,Sun Jun 28 15:41:06 2015 UTC,"They say ""some feints require superhuman reflexes, so nobody can actually read them"" is this true? If somebody is facehugging you and feints a stab attack or lookdown overhead (with very fast weapon) can anyone read that in very intense fight when the opponent is somebody new and you don't know his tactics?"
ChivalryGame,3berf2,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Sun Jun 28 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can read them decently on a broken ass laptop and have 320 ms reaction speed, however I have played this game for a long time and I just know natural tendencies, and can just read them very well, but not as consistently as I would like it to be. No player can read every feint, not even near perfectly when you have very quick weapons, so there's no need to feel bad if you can't read for shit, because most people can't. Most of the time it's all about footwork and positioning to best avoid those really hard to read close up feints. You're gonna get destroyed if you just stand still and look shitfaced when you get feint spammed to death. You must use these strategies to read these feints unless you're some type of Crushed god then you can afford to not have to do it with crazy feint reads. Reading is only half the game; you must put yourself in a position to not get feinted, or atleast force them to a bad feint where you can punish them or put them in a bad position where your teammate can bail you out if you fall for it. It's very hard to read quick feints from quick weapons so why try to read them I say. you must play the mind game and play aggressive. I like to compare it to any strategy game where being on the defense is at the disadvantage because the aggressor dictates where the fight is and it is much harder fighting reactively as the defender. Dem Eagle Warriors in your base is bad news man, kill your Eco. Attack then instead to get the pressure off of you. Yeah, reading feints is good and all but most of it is in the mind game and most people have predictable feint patterns. Just try not to gamble feints too hard, and don't try to play so defensive/give the opponent easy initiative."

If they're a knight, go kite shield + war-hammer and feint them with overheads and stabs, then follow up with overheads. Using these setups I would not be too surprised if a level 23 could take down rank 40s or even 50s a decent percentage of the time.  Really though feints aren't so dishonorable, the only ones I would consider dick moves are reverse overhead feints, but even then it's all fair game I suppose."

ChivalryGame,3bd5i6,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:27:19 2015 UTC,I suggest not cranking up the ragdoll counter; that's a lot of hi-detail models and texture you're keeping in play unnecessarily.  How does it run at the default of 20 ragdolls?

Ninja and viking with certain load outs have 0 cooldown on kicks, meaning they can kick you 4-5 times in a row without stopping. If you are ANYWHERE close to a ledge, you cannot stop them from knocking you off of it.  What's worse are these bugs have been around so long everyone does them, and no one bats an eye when it happens anymore. They just think it's part of the games balance.

ChivalryGame,3b7rng,qucangel,6,Fri Jun 26 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"Theres a phase to attacks (aside from ripostes) which is called windup - it's the period of the attack before it begins to deal damage. If you are hit during this time, you will be flinched, meaning your attack will be cancelled. Being hit after this time will not cancel your attack, so, assuming you do not miss, you will trade hits."
ChivalryGame,3b7rng,Oskoff,2,Fri Jun 26 17:33:59 2015 UTC,"To expand in this, if you ever hear about ""mercs mod"", it's what we use to play competitively and it's main proponent is what's called First Hit Flinch. This means that you can be flinched even in release, which causes much less hit trades, not eliminating it completely but drastically reducing it.

ChivalryGame,3b54ml,St0uty,19,Fri Jun 26 01:25:20 2015 UTC,"I've been around during the vast majority of Chivalry - Something actually pretty damn unique in the current playerbase - and will now write some of my thoughts.  Before I start, I have to disagree with a few of the comments already. Anstii, still relatively new to the scene and not around during the patches claims that chivalry had 'high potential' and that the issue was all TBS. Certainly both tbs and the community holds blame, and it isn't fair to put tbs as a scapegoat.  First let's go to how chivalry was seen. When launched, the main drive of players in the game came from those with very little experience (ergo, those who just saw the game on steam featured) and from youtube viewers. Look to the recent interview with Piggott and Epic to support this. Youtubers showcased the game as being goofy and ultra violent and includes a plethora of terrible gameplay (From any competent player POV). Because most people were brought into understanding of chivalry in this way, it had far reaching affects that still impact the community today and the way chivalry is preceived.   Because the game was seen as silly, very few ever came for the competitive part. Little #s of people saw the competitive AoC scene and connected it to the new 'steam sword game'. Very few came to chivalry to become mechanically strong or invested originally, unlike popular 'mlg' games today , Starcraft2, csgo, dota 2, etc.   Now obviously this isn't the whole reason buit it sets up an important scene for how chivalry began. As competitive play grew past the few at the start, people often bitched at even simple high-skilled mechanics. RoH were especially bitched at on the subreddit. It wasn't marketed ever as a high-skilled game, so why should people play it that way  Now to some of the downfalls that happened as Chivalry grew bigger, both casually and competitively. Bugs were really fucking bad, like, fucking terrible and were very exploitable. So many of these are fixed but so many existed for a time. Super jumps, getting out of the map, etc. Original communities fell that organized comp. chiv like DAG. TBS made relatively significant balance changes under slygoat that led to exodus of some. Imagine px, T, and Syn all dropping out at once. Later on, slygoat is let go and balance changes will become more mild and the community will be taken into consideration, but at the start they seemed pretty random and tbs received a lot of hate. That scared off a lot of people.  The game didn't have polish, lots of bugs, lots of drama, a terrible ui, defiantly no tournament mode of any kind, unorganized comp scene(I think this is important), fluctuating balance, and very limited visiblity for anything comp.  For the first year or so, no one really liked comp. The vast majority of casual players and tbs didnt seem to care for it. Less people accepted 'comp ways' than today.  Now this is maybe the most important part than all of my rambling above. The player numbers were always small and many people were only here for the fun and kicks they saw on youtube. Not enough to draw many into the games comp scene and it was always relatively small but no one took to much organization of it all. TBS made some headway with some organization of it on the forums, particularly after DAG fell, and started making more hot fixes to game breaking bugs and reverted some of the controversial balance changes after some time (bubble, cftp)  A game needs a LOT more people to have a thriving comp scene and chiv never had it. Unless a first person slasher (fps :P) can be made with critical success or maybe as a AAA title that has focus om comp play, I don't imagine it will ever take off terribly based on chiv and other fps's success.   I just rambled a lot."

ChivalryGame,3b54ml,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:34:26 2015 UTC,"I think the devs of slasher know that already, but if it's advertised as a comp game it will get a Fuck ton of bad press. Have you ever seen chivalry mentioned outside of this subreddit? Everyone says the game is terrible, non-competetive, and people break the realism etc etc.   Kinda connected to what I brought up in my post, but many people came to the game with different expectations.   So, slasher has to find a way to market a non realistic sword fighting game that is competiive. It'll be hard."
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,Charles_K,2,Fri Jun 26 17:01:02 2015 UTC,Actually you have a very good point in that being advertised solely as a comp game is dangerous. Hopefully Slasher can balance it out by flaunting 32v32 TO battles and PVE or something.
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,CRUSHED1337,0,Sun Jul 5 20:20:37 2015 UTC,"I think Slasher will be more seen as ""brutal, tough medieval"" game, similar to mount & blade and not some silly slasher  Its literally the best melee game I've ever played, in terms of PVP gameplay and combat I dont think anything will top it, especially not AAA developers because they usually dont know anything about competitive PVP let alone have the crazy amount of knowledge you need to design such a game like slasher."
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,MoePork,2,Fri Jun 26 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"The idea is that there is not a big IP behind it, therefore people will not care.  The only reason games like counter-strike, dota, etc take off is because it had plenty of exposure through a gigantic modding community through blizzard's starcraft/warcraft and valve's half-life.  Furthermore, those said games took years before they were in a state that it was popular enough to market them as standalone and, lo and behold, they were picked up by said gigantic IPs.  The easiest example this can probably be seen from is from the MMO market.  WoW was the ""first"" MMO to popularize to the masses and it was the only one on the market for a long time, and it reaped the benefits completely.  The only MMOs you see nowadays go F2P because it has less to do with the overall quality of the game, and more about people having to break ties with something they've already invested in, to go to another game that has a company with a less than pristine history backing it.  FF14 is allowed to go sub due to the popularity of the IP (they even botched the original release and had to re-release it... good luck for any other game being able to do that outside of IPs like valve, blizzard, ea, and square enix).  SWTOR is the only exception -- giant IP (star wars), but still fell into the stigma of a ""movie / tv show"" video game, which have never really received true critical acclaim (few exceptions).  Wildstar, despite receiving overwhelming acclaim, fell short due to the exact reasons stated above.  TL:DR -- the sad, but true, story in modern competitive gaming is that a game's success has less to do with the quality of the game, and more to do with establishing brands."
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,CRUSHED1337,0,Mon Jul 6 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"Agree with you, but I'm still hoping it will have some form of ""decent"" playerbase - I'm not asking for ten thousands of players here, but I can imagine slasher will be able to hold 1000 players at the same time, which is decent for an indie game.  Although it will be very tough, especially when competing with something like Chivalry 2 which is already an established brand now and will def. get alot more exposure then Slasher, despite being the probably worse game (gameplay wise)."

Don't get me wrong, they were a lot of good fun to play with, but when they all left for MW I couldn't keep up because I didn't have the hardware to play the game. :/ I would have been down to play competitively otherwise."
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,Clayton-BigsB,11,Fri Jun 26 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"take the games current state as an example of why this game could not be competitive and take off, especially now after like 2 1/2 to 3 years. Most players now, even a LOT of the other competitive team players have no idea how the game played before and how the game played through it's many iterations of patches. Most came in POST the ""infamous"" patch where people kind of talk about, but most of them are just kind of using that term not even knowing wtf happened. I could make a really long post but to put it very basically, this game was great at first and is still a fun game to play, but competitively the game has undergone too many huge changes, and a lot of the original competitive players I used to watch have stopped playing. There was a time when most players did not utilize backswings as every other attack. There was a time where people didn't know what CFTP was (not saying cftp is a bad thing). A lot of the widely used mechanics were discovered by the earlier players and kind of passed on. Youtube has made so many of the shittier tier playstyles very prevalent and more focused on breaking the game as much as possible and less about good clean team fighting.   Torn banner wasn't able to fix huge game breaking bugs in a timely manner, they were not very open to doing enough consistent patching and enough testing. The game would go into beta for a short while, not long enough to actually see the affects of things, and once the game went life and then people started realizing huge issues, they took too long to fix.  Take any competitive game for example, much more testing goes into patches, and if something huge gets broken or you realize somethings really OP or really broken, it gets either hotfixed quickly, or re-balanced in next patch.  Things just got more and more broken. Now leading us to the current state of the game and final balance patch.... archers are OP, hit trading reigns supreme, its to a point where mercs MOD MUST EXIST in order to have any competitive play at all.  Also DW could have been cool as well if they had TO. It's not as good as MW but it def has some good things about it over MW. For me though it's just missing TO which is the main mode I like playing in MW and it's the only competitive mode played anymore. LTS used to be a thing in competitive as well, however archers kind of ruin LTS (and everything for that matter) these days with sniper rifles, shotguns, whatever you want to call it that's pretty much what they are.  That was longer than i planned to be, but it's hard to have played the game from the beginning and not ramble and get kind of upset and sad inside thinking about it."
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,Kesby,2,Fri Jun 26 06:04:45 2015 UTC,"I played the game in beta and it was garbage. Hilarious, but just dumb in the end and i stuck to my dota ways  2 years later and i come back to the game in a fit of boredom, am impressed by the skill and tricks i see from public players and clan kids. Started playing from there  The current version of the game is definitely better than the older versions. The game can hardly be taken seriously even now, but before it was even worse - everyone was just too noob to realize it. Nostalgia is blinding, too"
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,Clayton-BigsB,2,Fri Jun 26 09:18:30 2015 UTC,"i agree, there were many issues in beta and when the game first came out so a LOT was done to fix a lot of broken shit. I mean before when you got hit you could just immediately swing right after. Knights had charge attack at one point. Archers could re-knock their bows while sprinting, all that kind of shit. The meta wasn't that deep though back then and we were all scrubs. As the meta evolved, the game needed some serious balance around it and it got some... but it was just like with each patch things got fixed but then it introduced other broken shit, every time.  The game right now is in a decent state, there's just a few standout things that just don't make sense to me that could probably use changing. Hit trades, flinch times vs. recovery times, and archer nerf. I'd be pretty happy overall if those 3 things were looked at again. They cause the most issue and heartache for me. I've watched plenty of mine and others old videos and we've come a long way lol"

There was a time when most players did not utilize backswings as every other attack   Was that due to how the game played before the patches or just the natural evolution of the meta?"
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,sesstreets,7,Fri Jun 26 09:20:40 2015 UTC,"that patch was when they fucked up and removed the ability to CFTP properly by putting a cooldown window (small one) between when you combo feint and could parry again. This made it so that you couldn't really cftp anymore and brought the whole free hit for range meta. They also introduced combo parry and parry in recovery which just allowed people to just parry in recovery instead of having to cftp and it actually cost less stamina to do, so noobs were just parrying everything willy nilly. This also buffed maa as you couldn't cftp and they could just dodge and free hit you (kind of like how they do now after they kill your stamina, since you know... dodge costs less than cftp).  Archer shit got buffed, and they're still pretty OP now. Javelin rework making the recovery time much shorter and such. I think they did some shit with shields, err that was a later patch where they increased the overall stamina (that was needed, though).   It was basically the removal of being able to cftp and the addition of combo/recovery parry that really fucked up the meta, and the stamina cost of doing so. It made the game too easy and really made maa's strong and the most OP dirty class not just in duel but in teamfighting as well. Many people liked how easy the game had become, but I sure as hell didn't... and I can't speak for the entire competitive community but lets just say it didn't really exist during that time.  There's probably a lot i'm forgetting about that patch but yeah, lots of bugs too, glitches, exploits, just overall bullshit game breaking shit in that patch.  The backswings were a normal evolution of meta, it started out I believe as people figuring out how to backswing objectives to do them faster like on darkforest doors etc. And then someone at some point was just like hey why couldn't i just hit someone behind me this way. And then the spin2win meta evolved. Few knew about it or used it, then as more youtube videos and streamers did it or people just saw them do it in game... it just became a thing. Then people started figuring out how to do it with slashes, different directions to do it in to really break animations, and even doing it with stabs.  Parrying is a lot easier now as you can parry with your ass, it's almost as if you lean back and you don't really even have to aim your parry as much before. You used to REALLY have to look at the tip of weapons but now it's just like the general direction kind of deal.   Anyway w/e"

ChivalryGame,3b54ml,SantianoFan88,3,Fri Jun 26 09:11:37 2015 UTC,"Let me share my three months of combat experience with you: I bought this game for the full f***** 23,99 on steam, because I watched 10 minutes of my roommate's gameplay. We're all a little bit into medieval ""nerdy"" kind of stuff, you know, so this game just seemed epic to me:D This game has the best sword fighting mechanics I have ever seen in a game. It is almost entirely skill-based, to an extend you wouldn't even see in competetive games like LoL (even if that one isn't first person). In my opinion, the game has more than enough potential for being competetive - and haven't there been tournaments already?  Second positive point is the battle cries and communication. After 3 month of constantly spamming the C button and taunting the shit out of my opponents, I am still not tired of using the huge variety of different voice commands. I would even die sometimes, because I try to ""retreat! retreat!"" while running backwards...with the communication options, the sound atmosphere on the battlefield is just epic. I was told recently, that some of the taunts used in the game are quotes from Shakespeare's works. As you can see, the game developpers even tried to give players an understanding of english literature - what a lovely job! What I think is sad, is that with the two big waves of newbies recently, very high leveled players seem to have left the game, and there isn't too much understanding on the servers. People like to bitch around about teamkilling newbies all the time, instead of helping them to understand the complex mechanics in order to raise some good warriors.  I'd really appreciate to see some more tournaments in the future, maybe someday I will have the skill to sign up for one myself:D"

Of course they did not leave as an immediate result of increasing sales, I never said that. I neither said that they left forever, many people might come back when all the newbies have learned to play more tactically, they just seem to be taking a break from instructing new people (though it is not at all anyone's responsibility to instruct new people, the game still has a tutorial section).  I have seen one or two high level only servers with an appropriate ping for european people, so, many veterans may be playing exclusively on those now, but I haven't seen them very often in the server list...for whichever reasons, I suppose you know more than I do. Thanks however, I am definitely gonna watch this weekend's tournament and am gonna keep my eyes open for more!"

ChivalryGame,3b54ml,redditors_r_manginas,6,Fri Jun 26 14:19:01 2015 UTC,"I backed the game on kickstarted and was an alpha tester and played Chivalry extensively at the highest level. Dare I might say I was part of the first competitive clan setting up scrims and tournaments and dominated ever since. ;) #humblebrag   I've seen this game from the very beginning following it ever since I got word from it on the Age Of Chivalry forums. Even that game/mod we were scrimming on lmao.  Long story short it had potential to become a competitive game but the developers never intended it to be played like an e-sport. It was also not marketed as an e-sport obviously. So yea that the reason.  When you're selling millions of copies to casuals you already have a working formula to make money. Why bother listening to the 0,0001%? Is it realy worth trying to fix your broken game when money is pouring in? Thats only a question one would ask if their main objective wasn't to make a realy good game or atleast fix it.  From my experiences interacting with the developers on the balance council and forums my guess is that atleast the lead of TB just didn't have the ambition to make Chivalry something bigger than just a casual slasher after their succes.  In the alpha and beta stages they were way more involved in the forums and what not. Literally posting daily. But it seems ever since their succes they shifted their focus from making the best melee game ever to expanding their business and trying to make more money. How else can you explain releasing an expansion while your base game is still riddled with bugs and balance issues that were there since release.  Don't give me the excuse that their original programmer coded their game in a sloppy way and couldn't fix the bugs. With the millions they made they could've hired an army of programmers and still made profit. It's a matter of principle and self respect as a developer. You don't release expansions when your base game is still broken. Especialy not ones based on a generic and cheesy TV shows.  They tried their hand at balancing the game but since they didn't play their own game they were literally clueless on how to balance this game. A balance council was called for but since the community was pretty mcuh 90% casuals(anti feint cancer) and 10% people who knew what they were talking about it was doomed to fail especially when we were writing essays on how to balance this game that eventualy got ignored by the main man Steven Pigeon who didn't have a clue himself on how to balance the game. Props to Kimiko and Slygoat for sticking through all of this and BB's cancerous disagreeing.   They even removed CFTP because clueless anti feint people like The Radiant and some other people when almost the entire balance council was against the idea. But Steve Pigeon felt it would be better for the game if you couldn't CFTP. Thats what you get if you don't play your own game or don't understand how its being played competitively. They eventualy reintroduced it though. Like they did with so many changes just randomely buffing and nerfing things based on whims like literaly Steve Pigeon going on a pub getting killed by Crushed with a bearded axe and going ""Dat must be nerfed HUEE!"". Next patch bearded axe got nerfed not even mentioned what specificaly got nerfed. No joke.  The back and forth between patches random bug (un)fixes and unlogical balance changes made alot of people who played competitively quit.  The biggest fuck up of the community, besides being predominantly casual was that of the US tournament that was supposedly going to be backed by Torn Banner. Even doubling the amount of money that was being raised if I remember correctly.   Anyways point being TB was willing to invest money in a competitive tournament possibly opening up the path to more sponsored tournaments. But the teams involved and the tournament organizers instead of trying to play nice and make use of this opportunity they derped out and made TB realize for how stupid they were to ever consider the idea of investing in the competitive aspect of this game.  They released free maps but the quality and design was very lack luster compared to Darkforest and Stoneshill, heck even the original Age of Chivalry maps had better design than that volcano based (Citadel!) or that snow map Frost or whatever. They were meh at best. Instead of going for an elegant design with a focus on competitive objectives they went for a half assed elaborate edgy approach.  When you give money to developers without ambition they get lazy or lose whatever ambition they had and  become complacent and satisfied with the lowest of quality.  There's so much more I could say but meh."

ChivalryGame,3b54ml,redditors_r_manginas,2,Fri Jun 26 19:09:03 2015 UTC,"I played from the start of chiv (and AoC), and played for about a year longer, and ran a pretty major clan for most of the duration. There's quite a few reasons it didn't take off  TBS gave absolutely no support or thought to the competitive scene whatsoever. Basic tourney features were missing, and while TBS actively patched the game, weapon balanced got fucked every patch, which lead to everyone playing with OP weapon x every time.  There was and is no anticheat (chiv is built in a way that allows for easy, undetectable hacks). This made people lose a lot of trust in the game, because every match would result in hacking accusations from both sides. Given how easy it is to cheat subtly, i'm 99% sure a huge amount of the comp scene cheated, though I was (and am still) very strictly anti cheats myself  The community is also a lot to blame as well, and outright refused to deal with the problem of exploits, bugs, and OP weapons. There was no kind of central organisation whatsoever regulating gameplay - this meant that when a new patch came out breaking weapon balance, everyone just swapped to the latest OP weapon with no regards, every time complaining that it was just whining. Meta went from SoW + shield, SoW two handed, norse sword, the long polearm thing (could instahit on lookdown overhead), 1handed hammer (back when it shamelessly 2hit a knight), poleaxe (when its overhead time was stated to be broken by the devs, yet people still used it), messer (stab), vanguard claymore lightsaber etc etc. The weapons swapped every patch.  Every single time a weapon was grossly overpowered, the community flatly refused to stop using it in the name of fun/fairness, and just abused them to the fullest. I remember attempting to have a conversation with another clan about lookdown overheads being completely broken (back in the very early days of the comp scene) with certain weapons allowing you to completely bypass windup, but they refused as exploiting this allowed them to hit nigh unblockably outright faster and was seen as 'skill'. This was particularly problematic given how OP feints were at the time  Today we see this reflected by the reverse lookup overheads, and the community refusing to acknowledge how stupid these are and ban them (yet we ban feints, despite them being the least powerful they've ever been)  The community really sucked for chiv, and IMO even though torn banner fucked up pretty hard, we were the reason it never went anyway. Everyone just wanted to win, and were hyper aggressive and willing to exploit the very fragile combat system to do this  I disagree with /u/HELPMEIMGONADIE on only two counts really. 1stly I think the comp scene was much better in the early days - nobody had figured out the worse exploits so it was generally pretty ok in terms of balance. And secondly, player numbers didn't really have anything to do with it - the comp scene was always very active, but it didn't expand because of all the problems the game had  Oh and, I believe it very nearly went MLG, but I don't remember the story. I think the scene simply wasn't big enough at the time, but it was a while ago and I forget  /ramble  Edit:  Next time round for chiv 2 (3?), we need to get each clan to send a representative and vote on balance issues. TBS won't fix mechanics, and weapons will be OP, so we need to decide as a community to disallow these things, and drown out the people who claim you are just whining"
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,HELPMEIMGONADIE,3,Fri Jun 26 22:37:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the post but I don't think anyone is trying to ban feints outside of pub scrubs who might call a vote kick after getting beat
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,redditors_r_manginas,-1,Sat Jun 27 00:26:52 2015 UTC,"I believe they were banned in NA for a while (wasn't someone prominent disqualified for feinting?), but they were never that problematic in the EU scene. I do find it hilarious that now is when people are complaining about feints being OP, when they were drastically waaaay more powerful before"
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,Chuckdatass,4,Sat Jun 27 00:42:38 2015 UTC,"Lol, holy Fuck. Of course it's not banned. What the Fuck are you smoking. I'll write a relatively Ling response to everything you have terribly terribly incorrect. I assume you are in a European team"
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,AceofSpades916,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:29:58 2015 UTC,It's not like it can't be MLG anymore. We just need a sponsor and a tournament with big bucks to draw attention. If TBS did 100 000$ tournament that would be enough to get people to start training and spark other tournaments.

ChivalryGame,3b54ml,jimykurtax,-8,Fri Jun 26 22:21:20 2015 UTC,"The problem with Chivalry is that the sword-fighting mechanics are amazing with mediocre players, but totally break down when someone has practised the game for 500+ hours. It can't be really competitive because the mechanics of the game can't handle really skilled players, most moves they make just look like the game is glitching when you're on the receiving end.  Torn Banner clearly didn't intent mechanics like dragging or insta-overheads, but when those emerged they realized that with this engine there's nothing they can do about it, so they tried to imply that it's working as intended, and thus you can be killed in full plate by a blade swinging slower than a garden swing.  Chivalry is amazing as a casual, skill-based sword fighting game. But in my opinion with these mechanics it can never be taken seriously as a competitive game, like Counter Strike. There's too much broken on high level play.  -Rank 49"
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,Sophax,9,Fri Jun 26 06:09:48 2015 UTC,Torn Banner clearly didn't intent mechanics like dragging   They have ltierally started up front that dragging is 100000% intended and brought over from AoC. I hate how people argue this. Hell it was a loading screen tip for a time. Ugh.  It's not broken at high level play in that way. There are valid complaints but this isnt one of them.
ChivalryGame,3b54ml,HELPMEIMGONADIE,-5,Fri Jun 26 06:39:12 2015 UTC,"I know it's a loading screen tip, but it wasn't before pro's started to utilize it heavily. If it's totally intented, why did they try to fix it in Deadliest Warrior?"

There is such a thing as too much to control, and that is this game on a keyboard/mouse or controller lol. But it would obviously be 999x more intuitive on Virtual Reality.  And yeah, it literally is a medieval simulator. The dev described it as such.  A medieval simulator... with REVERSE YOLOVERHEADS.  I guess it could be fun in a simulator way (a lot of people wanted a more ""realistic"" swordfighter, wonder if it'll have grappling and mordhau and shit then with 99% of players also using spear lol).

ChivalryGame,3b4dv5,TobiwanK3nobi,2,Thu Jun 25 23:19:52 2015 UTC,"As a wireless user, I've had to deal with similar stuff to this for ages. It's really hard to judge positions because what I see on my screen is always a little bit different from what is actually happening.  Example: I thrust at a guy who is moving laterally in relation to my view, and at the instant that my tracers generate, the server corrects his position on my screen, resulting in him being a bit further on his way than I originally saw, which makes me miss initially and I have to correct aim. Or missing swings that were clearly in range, and being hit by swings that were clearly out of range(this happens most engagements). Fun stuff like that.  Working on getting a 50ft ethernet cable so I can wire up."
ChivalryGame,3b4dv5,Reithur,2,Fri Jun 26 05:03:33 2015 UTC,No long ethernet cable required; get a powerlline ethernet adapter.  I've got one and they work really well.

I'm wired and have been for the life of this game but I've seen some shit.
ChivalryGame,3b4dv5,Clayton-BigsB,0,Fri Jun 26 06:13:05 2015 UTC,"The weird thing is, I haven't had this issue on anyone other game including the very unoptimised RoK. I'll give it a bash though."
ChivalryGame,3b4dv5,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Thu Jun 25 23:50:01 2015 UTC,"i think optimization thought would affect your frame rate, and this seems more of a network issue. I was getting packet loss like crazy bad a while back and it would help when i restarted my modem/router. I called my ISP several times to see what the deal is but they have incompetent non-technical people there. Eventually it kind of went away. idk  i'm also wired btw and you say in other posts here that you are on wireless. Wireless for PC gaming can work but you also say you are upstairs and it's downstairs. Back when i lived with my parents, i still gamed when the wireless was in the basement and i was two floors up. If you can't go wired, you could potentially get a better router and wireless card with antennae on it, like a wireless N or AC, and upgrade or buy a new wireless card for your PC as well. The newer routers/cards have more range and more maximum throughput so you could potentially get better performance that way. Other than that like i said you might just have to reboot the modem/router every once in a while or try using different channels on the router itself.   all in all, wireless isn't the best. I understand that not everyone has the option or feasability for wired, so you can only do so much."

ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,Dogetron,7,Thu Jun 25 13:32:58 2015 UTC,I don't think the messer looks anything like it does in real life. The weapon is just way too thick and heavy looking for an actual messer.
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Thu Jun 25 19:02:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's a common issue in games actually. Swords are often way too thick, they look more like clubs. Skyrim does it too."
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,UnanimatedFelix,6,Thu Jun 25 19:32:01 2015 UTC,Don't even get me started on Skyrim. I think I have more sword fixing mods for that game than I do for any others combined.
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,crimsonBZD,5,Thu Jun 25 21:07:14 2015 UTC,The war hammer.  Or maybe it's because the war hammer is better used a toothpick than for actual combat.

ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,Reithur,4,Thu Jun 25 14:10:16 2015 UTC,Those are actually supposed to be as wide across as the handle is long to protect your hands and forearms when you wield it. Should make an equilateral triangle if it's properly sized.

ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,blahblahwhateverblah,8,Thu Jun 25 16:44:57 2015 UTC,I went to a Vikings artifact exhibition and their swords looked exactly like the TB norse sword. VERY simple but very reliable.  It was much longer than TB's norse sword though. Obviously TB had to do that for balancing purposes.
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,OmarWarOgre,3,Thu Jun 25 13:43:32 2015 UTC,"Huh. And I've always had a soft spot for Viking-age weaponry. To each their own, eh?"

ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,-wallace-,7,Thu Jun 25 20:48:52 2015 UTC,"""2 tiny blood channels"" lol those are fullers, meant to reduce the weight of the weapon. Directing the flow of blood down their blade is not their intended purpose at all, and I really don't know why people think that."
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,sesstreets,5,Thu Jun 25 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia says that fullers can be called blood channels/blood gutters, but the slang has nothing to do with their intended purpose.  ...weird. Guess you learn something new every day!"
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,bltrocker,2,Thu Jun 25 14:18:45 2015 UTC,I thought it was so when you stabbed them it wouldn't create any suction and you could pull it out easily
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,-wallace-,10,Thu Jun 25 15:05:50 2015 UTC,"Myth, the fuller reduces weight and increases strength. Buy a large steak and stab it with a knife. Any suction?"
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,ACobb,10,Thu Jun 25 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"It doesn't increase strength--it maintains it. Also, if you guys want to be pedantic, because blood groove is an accepted common term that you're harping on, a fuller is the tool to create the groove, not the groove itself. It's just called a groove in the end. The blade is considered ""fullered"". People more into swords call the grooves fullers, but it's almost as much a misnomer as blood groove."
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,Oilystool,2,Thu Jun 25 14:38:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess that makes more sense, it was just what I'd heard."
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,kapanee,3,Thu Jun 25 16:25:38 2015 UTC,"Cranberry is right, fullers are to reduce blade weight while retaining structure. ""Blood Groove"" is a nickname and not much more."
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,ColonelHerro,2,Thu Jun 25 14:41:56 2015 UTC,"I always thought the Longsword had an odd design. The sword guard looks like it would deflect a blow towards your arm.  Which is odd. If you look at a claymore,the sword guard means it would stop a blow and the opponent would have to pull his sword away after,thus giving the person holding the claymore the initiative. I always liked the design on the grand mace, it's functional,decorative and deadly looking."
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,kapanee,2,Thu Jun 25 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"Man, I hate the zweihander default. The wierd curvy blade is so garish and ugly, and the crossguard looks spindly and thin. Thank GOD I bought pixels to replace it."
ChivalryGame,3b2kn1,ColonelHerro,3,Thu Jun 25 19:30:10 2015 UTC,"The new zwei skin looks more like most 'flame-blade' zweis. I think the waves are designed to counter pikes/polearms, they made it very hard to parry apparently."

ChivalryGame,3b1qhf,bltrocker,-3,Thu Jun 25 16:25:33 2015 UTC,"I'd give it a mixed bag. MAA can be close to unstoppable when it's 1v1, so there's that class matchup out of the gate. It's especially tough with how mercs kind of fucked up the combat with FHF. Then you have Keyes making some good plays and Genesis making a lot of horrible plays.   The MAA matchup was boring as fuck (actually, most duels in Chiv are boring as hell to watch), but Keyes had some good moves and won. Rathion went for too many spear thrusts and got punished, especially on those goofy matrix ones where he's leaning back praying that a lightningfeet MAA won't close the gap in time. 1 lmb and no feints as far as I could tell. Matterhorn seemed to be playing defensively by dancing around and having poor parry aim, attempting a riposte that everyone has been reading to their children since the dawn of Chiv. He seemed frustrated at the end and threw in a desperation stab that was easily beaten by the shitstick that is norse sword. Valkyraz almost got him, but fucked up his spacing on multiple levels in the second half of the fight, allowing Keyes to collect himself and get some free hits. I can't really see the last duel that well.  Keyes used to come into the central servers where I was pubbing all the time. He's pretty good, but he got really predictable after a while. If you play him a bunch and anticipate, you can easily go 1:1 (unless he's made some drastic improvements). I guess that could be said of almost anyone, though."

ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,HELPMEIMGONADIE,10,Thu Jun 25 00:13:30 2015 UTC,"First time I agree with unborn. I was proud of your response in the beginning, but by you leaving it open for debate is setting up a shit storm."
ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,Chuckdatass,11,Thu Jun 25 00:19:53 2015 UTC,"Hell it's not even controversial. It's everyone against his direct friends. Just do as other tourney organizers have done, just say he can't play and be done with it."
ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,HELPMEIMGONADIE,11,Thu Jun 25 00:21:57 2015 UTC,"It's very simple. If you can replicate what he does here (note how late the Van hits), then we can re-examine his legitimacy.  And it's funny how people are suddenly 180'ing their stance on this without proper rebuttal - literally, we have people spouting non-sequiturs about random shit in wizardish's ""defense""; that's almost as bad as, if not even worse than, the evidence.zip?.wmv he posted up.  So what, because you suddenly don't hate wizardish anymore, that suddenly invalidates the video? Or the video was always invalid, but suddenly that's only relevant now instead of when a tournament was still in session with wiz in it? Where were you in wizardish's defense back then? The only two people I can recall even remotely being ready to wait it out are Tobiwan and Massi, and even they weren't outright defending him. So if you were so wishy-washy about it back then but now think otherwise, why should we even take your word now?  Now, this is off the topic of cheating but: I really wonder why people want him to play for them in the first place. Just ask MuffinCabbage, a Syndicate member, about wizardish lol. If it's because you think he's good and will carry your team, well I have this to say: playing with certain people is simply not fun, even if you win in the end. But whatever, I'm only basing that off what other people have told me about scrimming alongside him.  And, at any rate, this is Wi11's tournament. He can ban fucking Spook for no reason if he wants, it's his rules. He's not obligated to host a fair tournament, but doing so is probably in his best interests.  And if you think this is just Tempest dickriding, well... Anstii, a TEMPEST archer, defends bigs' legitimacy as an archer. And bigs played for f and plays for Px, which is pretty much Tempest's ""official"" rival lol. Karasu, likewise. Unless I'm completely misinterpreting those posts. Hell, I've had close steam friends call me a fucking FOOL for thinking bigs is legit even after watching the vids. Him cheating in DOD literally like 7 years ago is an undeniable fact, but I still am not convinced that he is aimb0tting in Chiv 2013-2015. My brother pulls crazier shit off in CS:GO on a daily basis, and I can literally walk over to his room and witness him making these plays (hell, he can do the same on MY computer, which has no hidden triggerbot or anything installed in it). The amount of cheating accusations my brother gets on a DAILY basis (I am not exaggerating) is hilarious, it's the same amount of certainty people show over bigs' case with (honestly, insufficient) video evidence. But wizardish's video is a little more clear cut to my eyes. My bro's global elite. Hell, I'm global elite (the ranking system is fucked up, I should be SMFC or L. Eagle), I can log on and you can check it for yourself (I know syndicate's Doggie has seen my rank). But he's like a LEGIT Global Elite, I got my ass carried by him up there.  I've been in every spectrum of the cheating circle (the cheater, cheated against, playing with a cheating teammate, watching a legit player be called cheater while literally standing behind him, being called cheater when legit, etc.). Hell, maybe I should make a post about my experiences, it's pretty interesting. And for the record, yes I admit to cheating... back in 2002 or so. Counter-Strike 1.3. Well, more recently, Diablo 2 maphacking too if you count that lol."

ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,TobiwanK3nobi,5,Thu Jun 25 03:22:43 2015 UTC,"To clarify my opinion on bigs, yes I think he cheated in the past if I'm being honest. Do I think he cheats now? Not really, but I do believe that a handful of archers have particles turned off, which should be a permanent tourney rule to have to take screenshots of smoke to prove legitimacy. If you have particles off or trees off you should be banned from playing in tournies. It's cheating. As for Wizardish, it's pretty blatantly obvious he was sped up, not to mention he was so incredibly racist and mean to everyone. But that's up to Wi11. Stick to your guns."
ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,Anstii,3,Thu Jun 25 05:43:09 2015 UTC,they promised me exclusive slasher DLC ($49.99 worth on in-game purchases) and stattrak messer
ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,Charles_K,2,Thu Jun 25 00:52:25 2015 UTC,"Just like stan said i don't like to say much about anything on here because chiv is 2 toxic n broken 4 me but...   So what, because you suddenly don't hate wizardish anymore, that suddenly invalidates the video? Or the video was always invalid, but suddenly that's only relevant now instead of when a tournament was still in session with wiz in it? Where were you in wizardish's defense back then? So if you were so wishy-washy about it back then but now think otherwise, why should we even take your word now?   What's sad is that I feel like ppl's hate for him is what validated the arguments of ppl who felt so strongly about his hacks (yes I know he was a troll). As far as defense goes, a lot of ppl didn't know what to think at the time. I don't think it was about being wishy washy, I think most people thought why even say anything if you can't make an outright decision? There is no definitive way to tell if someone is hacking in this game because there's way too many variables to account for and yeah it sucks. It was spontaneous and out of nowhere in the middle of a tournament which can tend to throw ppl off, and these things take time to peruse. Also, a lot of people who wanted to defend him simply felt doubtful about his chances because of his reputation. On top of that, it was ultimately up to father height to make a decision, (although I'm sure some influential individuals were apart of it all)  and there's not a ton you can do to sway that in the middle of a tourney. The way the evidence was publicized labeled him outright as a hacker rather than it being simply potential evidence.   Now, this is off the topic of cheating but: I really wonder why people want him to play for them in the first place. If it's because you think he's good and will carry your team   I'll be honest, I never thought he was sham wow amazing in team situations compared to anyone else on the teams that he played with. He was decent yes, but even now he doesn't ""carry"" his teams. He was a great duelist, smart player, that's what i thought of him.  One person's experience is one person's experience. Scrimming in chiv and having some sort of problem or dispute or just being toxic with your team mate is more than common. The guy was a troll and I know he wasn't well liked, but the majority of ppl that he played with had no problems, and i have ppl who can hold account for that. It's fun to play any game with him, i won't lie. He is a troll yeah, but what can i say? doesn't bother the ppl that have been playing with him for a while. He's contributed a lot to a lot of teams whether ppl want to admit or not past their hate for him, recruited so many ppl i know  that still play the game to this day, helped trained clans in terms of strats/lineups/composition. Even when i was leading GoD, i received little encouragement and help but he was one of the few that contributed to that believe it or not, despite of what ppl assumed of his attitude/behavior.  I do agree that this is Will's tourney and he can do whatever he pleases."
ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,TheAustrianZebra,3,Thu Jun 25 02:57:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's a case of nothing being definitive, so the general community makes a judgement call. From an outside perspective and having watched a lot of video game gameplay, I think Bigs and Wizardish hacked in competitive. From the looks of it, the tiebreaker for ""is the pretty good circumstantial evidence enough?"" seems to be: are you a dickwad and does most of the comp scene like you around? I'm not sure that's a bad thing.  I certainly wouldn't want to play against Bigs, since he's a cheater in my mind, but I'm not in comp, so those players have decided they're alright with trusting him to be a fair player. Tiebreaker apparently went to him for not being an asshole. Maybe this will be a lesson learned (for Wizardish or anyone else watching) about the importance of being a social person wanting to play a game with a social species. Also, sometimes ""sorry I was an asshole"" doesn't cut it if you were a big enough asshole."

ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,Kesby,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:40:14 2015 UTC,"I could definitely post a video of a recreation of that. I remember when the accusations against wizardish were first thrown out. We were trying to recreate that moment and after a few tries I got it to work a few times. It seems fishy that you could flinch a vanguard after the charge that is that late, but it's sadly possible with a good messer reverse lmb.  No one would be convinced from that though so I don't see the point."

Can't see any of that in the video"
ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,Kesby,-2,Fri Jun 26 00:23:18 2015 UTC,"I've been ignoring this whole fiasco for the most part because it's stupid and unimportant. That being said, I stand by what I said when the accusations began- I'm not convinced he hacks."

ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,Kwaziii,-2,Fri Jun 26 00:26:29 2015 UTC,"Any reasonable person. Do I seem reasonable to you idiot? Joking aside, I also did some testing weeks after that and realized that there are a number of factors that could have contributed to the animations in question. I even spent time with Wizard on duel servers and had him explain and demonstrate the questionable animations. So, I think what we're really gathering from all of this drama is that it's basically only Tempest, a loud minority in the ""competitive"" community, that believes it's their prerogative to speak on behalf of everyone. P.S. Down vote to show your nerd rage."

ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,Kesby,7,Thu Jun 25 04:51:59 2015 UTC,"There's people in this thread, the last drama thread, and the first one when the evidence came up that were all against Wizardish.  It was a pretty large majority.  Are all these people in Tempest?"
ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,JarlBallin_,-7,Thu Jun 25 07:17:08 2015 UTC,"No, I just believe that they act as if they represent the entire community when they're only a small part of it; and they're very good at getting people riled up to believe something before the smoke clears. Opinions have changed since the previous drama died down. If anything, this at least suggests that there is a SIGNIFICANT part of the competitive community that isn't convinced Wizard is a hacker. It isn't even about thinking he is or isn't a hacker, rather, it's that many of us aren't convinced- we some shade of doubt. A bunch of people have been accused of hacking in the past few weeks with nothing more than a hunch to back up those accusations. The accusers? Zombo and the Tempest lot. At this point I think some people feel they've lost some credibility. Lastly, this debate really isn't worth having since there is no definitive way of finding out for sure whether or not he hacks- no official party or appointed person to determine a ruling. Hell, it would've been nice if he was VAC banned, at least then it's black and white."
ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,ParkRangerStan,3,Fri Jun 26 00:29:33 2015 UTC,When you go from average player to Acing kendo vs tempest from one week to the other. That sure starts alot of smoke. Then we got pretty good video evidence to analyze later on.
ChivalryGame,3b0jdb,Chuckdatass,0,Thu Jun 25 07:21:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I agree that it may appear that way. When we discussed this very issue privately within the clan, we always said that he kinda came out of nowhere. But this notion isn't entirely accurate. You see, Wizard played as if his life depended on it. He racked up 140 hours in two weeks- week after week. You're going to get very good at dueling if you dedicate your life to it, and he did. I'm not saying he isn't hacking, I'm saying I'm not 100% convinced."

Its basically for the viewers to hear and see how the teams communicate during key moments, like for dark forest the caster could go into the channel(and the caster doesnt say anything, this is all so the viewers can hear the teams) of the attacking team when they hit the sleuce gate or defending team when they are defending C at the end. Basically what the caster of this vod does at 31 minutes! just not say anything while he is in there lol. Btw i really like the caster in this vod.

I haven't even logged into Chivalry (dunno why I keep reading the subreddit, habit I guess) for weeks now, and up until I discovered Elite I played chiv every day since it was released.  Elite's an amazing game, and it's going to keep getting better and better.  I wouldn't recommend it if you're one of them ADD skittle and COD kids that can't sit still and needs instant gratification, but if you spend some time getting into it and appreciating the incredible scope (1:1 scale map of the entire fucking Milky way) you'll be addicted. Spacewalking, atmospheric flight and planetary landing should be coming soon, along with a host of other features like multi crew ships, 1st person ground combat, hunting etc."

I only enjoy CSGO and HotS with my brother or my best bud, otherwise it's NO:GO for me. HotS isn't as fun alone.  I obviously used to like Chiv a lot. Chivalry actually teaches you some very bad habits for Slasher and I've just sort of outgrown Chiv, so I don't play it much anymore. That and I really need to cut down on games, my academics have suffered and I am playing catch up.  So yeah, smash4, csgo, hots, and now slasher with the seldom merc or chiv pub."

It's intuitive but it's also very easy to think you've reached maximal draggage when you really have yet to glimpse your potential. Watch colonial star and terippers videos. Also Will's montages and those of other good players. Instead of focusing on the shitty music in most of them though, pay attention to the tactics of these good players and think about why they're doing what they're doing when they do it and how it works"

And, when you fight him, he teleports backwards when he falls for feints or teleports sideways as soon as you start attack because mouse turn cap means you can't hit him.  If only there was a class that shot fast, unblockable projectiles over great distances that dealt the same amount of damage as the slowest, strongest melee weapon in the game.  If only there was a class that had a weapon that could one-shot anyone and couldn't be flinched while swinging such a weapon if the enemy plays offensive and ""feeds"" him a parry riposte.  If only there was a class who weapons with long range that also had super knockback so you could keep hitting people and pushing them away. Then, once they get close, you could turn around 180 degrees and instantly hit them instead. And, if they were to fall for a feint and dodge backwards, you can chase them and force them to parry again and lose over 9001 stamina."

Confusing the enemy by wearing clothes easily mistaken for his own team has no place in the kind of war chivalry is simulating.

ChivalryGame,3aus3e,tyridge79,6,Tue Jun 23 17:56:32 2015 UTC,"The parry system is pretty good but it does have a few goofs. You can get around the parry volume by misdirecting your attacks but the thing is if your weapon even intersects the volume just once along its release path then the attack will be parried. What this means is that you may stab around someone's visible parry (their sword model animation) and turned the attack into their side however during that attack you interested the volume so your attack gets parried without the other person actually looking at you directly. This system also is what causes people to parry with their back. They may be looking up and so their parry volume is projected forward and up and your attack comes from above them and although they are facing away from you, you may clip that volume and get parried.   Like I said though, for the most part it works well and allows for dynamic combat but it isn't an absolutely perfect system. I would say it is probably the best system put their of all the games I have played."
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,ia_Flame,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:29:04 2015 UTC,very well said
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,Louisflakes,2,Tue Jun 23 23:55:43 2015 UTC,There is a parry box that you have to aim in order to successfully parry an incoming attack. What you may be seeing in videos is a desynch in animations between players.   There are many new players at the moment due to recent sales. There is a good mix of rookies and experienced players.   You will die a lot at first. Everyone does.  I suggest you avoid the low rank servers to avoid giving yourself some really bad habits (mostly regarding team damage).   Feel free to ask questions!
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,Reithur,0,Tue Jun 23 18:15:25 2015 UTC,"Okay neat. So if you strike an enemy's leg, he has to parry the tip looking down right? He can't just parry at a torso level and crouch or some crap like that? I've seen videos where people parry when they're not actually looking at the blade is what I'm saying. So this is Just called desync?   Sorry if I'm being paranoid. I'm a competitive person and I don't want to buy a game and spend time on it if certain things like what I believed I saw really impair on the realism and immersion aspects of the game, while also presumably making duels based more on luck than skill.   Also, another ridiculous thing I saw was people rotating their bodies 180 degrees and hitting you?? Wat?? I suppose this won't be a dealbreaker for me since I'm sure it'd be easy to punish them by hitting their back but.. Is this temporary? Will it be patched?? Thanks"
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,ia_Flame,4,Tue Jun 23 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"The 180 degree strikes are a manipulation of the real time swing system, it is a part of the game and you just have to learn to punish these players and use the fact that their attack range is limited during this move to try and counter them."
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,Reithur,4,Tue Jun 23 18:30:18 2015 UTC,"Flame has it right. It's in the game to stay, but you can learn how to deal with it.   Properly parrying or attacking takes practise to learn how and where to drag your cross hairs. Luck does play a part, but usually only when the opponents are more or less equal."

We call them ballerinas and while it's effective to people not ready for it, you can easily beat them by keeping your distance and being neat with your engagements IE attacking when you should and not risking instant ripostes getting you."
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,mobinstime,3,Tue Jun 23 19:29:26 2015 UTC,I feel like people on the subreddit downplay how effective spinning is because they want to make the game sound less broken than it is. A lot of the best players in NA use spins because they are incredibly powerful and don't have many downsides. I thought mercs was going to somehow get rid of them but it doesn't seem that's going to happen anymore.
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,MadTapirMan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:56:33 2015 UTC,"I also find it kind of annoying. Some spinners, when you know what they are going to do, you can play against, but personally I rarely see anything to do against vanguards with long range swords just constantly circling away from you and turning while attacking once you get back into range and all that jazz.   This is why I like servers that don't allow third person so much, just won't see things like this very often, and when you do, it's much easier to punish."
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Wed Jun 24 12:34:40 2015 UTC,"In your normal pub server there are a ton of low levels. You'll fit in.   This isn't a realistic game. Yes, you have to time your parties and you need to be facing the first direction. Ergo, if I jump and overhead you, a common block would be crouching, turning up, and parrying at the last second. This is the case in high level games anyways. You do need to parry correctly, in the direction and timing in a basic level though."
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,BioshockEndingD00D,5,Tue Jun 23 18:20:23 2015 UTC,Well timed parties are what separate the good from the okay. Don't throw a party at 3 pm on a Tuesday.

ChivalryGame,3aus3e,CrimsonArmada,2,Tue Jun 23 18:38:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot guys. I'm installing the game now. Does anyone have any combat tips to block and attack effectively, regarding technique, strategy of combatant engagements, psychology, or a mixture of any these things? I know it will take a while to be fairly good but I want to start off building good habits. Don't be afraid to get complicated and technical on me, I may not understand it all at first but I learn very quickly."
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,jollyjimmyy,3,Tue Jun 23 21:21:14 2015 UTC,"Aim in the direction of the attack to help your blocks be more consistent but don't like angle 90 degrees.  Punish people that miss instantly when you see them do it. If you are fast enough they won't be able to block.  Learn to combo. Every time you hit someone you should combo, no matter what.   When you combo after hitting someone you should try to mix up your next attack. Drag, accelerate, or combo feint.  If your weapon has range, use it. Backpedale and try to get people to miss sometimes and punish them.  Learn how to feint to parry, an important high level combat technique where you cancel your attack during windup and parry to avoid being flinched or traded. I would recommend double clicking RMB for this.  Learn how to feint well. Many people will give you shit for it but ignore them, it's part of the game and here to stay. Get as close as possible when you feint and cancel the attack as late as you can. If someone attacks when you are feinting then feint to parry.  Learn to manipulate the real time strikes, i.e. dragging. Overheads in my experience are the best for delays. Just drag your mouse up when you do an overhead strike. For slashes drag in the opposite direction of the attack, for example drag to the right for the default slash mapped to LMB.   Be aware of recovery!! When you miss an attack you will go into recovery which is a different amount of time depending on the weapon. First of all try not miss. Second of all, you can do the more advanced combo feint to parry. If you realize you are about to miss, combo into another attack, feint to cancel it and then parry. This is an incredibly useful thing to know. It especially comes in use vs men at arms who dodge your attacks and force misses.  You probably know this one but you can perform a riposte by atracking the instant after you parry. This attack skips windup partially so it's faster than normal. Good for keeping up pressure or taking less experienced people off guard with a fast attack.  Keep an eye on your stamina! Try to never miss if possible. Using feints, feint to parry and combo feint to parry cost a good deal of stamina but they are essential to really skilled play where you have options for every situation. Just manage your stamina well  Recommended beginner weapons: Sword of War or Messer for knight, Greatsword for vanguard   Looking up some videos would be a good idea. Search for Moe Pork Chivalry for the basics. Search for Hexen ACI and Teripper for a lot more content"
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,CRUSHED1337,0,Wed Jun 24 18:33:32 2015 UTC,"If you get tired of Chivalry or want a realistic fighting medieval combat system, you could always try mount and Blade Warband's multiplayer."

ChivalryGame,3aus3e,BigRig3387,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:50:17 2015 UTC,"Now that I think back, mount and blade's combat isn't realistic haha, but it sure is more realistic than Chivs. You need momentum to do more damage, each weapon has sweet spots in the animations and does mode damage at the tip. There isn't dodging. Blocking is directional."
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,ia_Flame,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:56:35 2015 UTC,I just bought the game and I'm not really that good. I play with a controller and Im almost never at the bottom of the scoreboard for FFA and in team games I usually contribute decently. So there are a good amount of new players and players who arent that great so you wont be slaughtered day one.
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,BigRig3387,6,Tue Jun 23 18:00:21 2015 UTC,Switch to mouse and keyboard ASAP it'll be a little weird at first but you are severely limiting yourself with the controller.
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,ia_Flame,5,Tue Jun 23 18:23:00 2015 UTC,That's okay. Id rather enjoy the game and have fun than play something uncomfortable.
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,Akdag,3,Tue Jun 23 18:48:13 2015 UTC,It will be hard to enjoy when you can barely control the dynamic mechanics that it has to offer

I'm enjoying the game and there are a lot of fights I win and I can use dragging fairly well.   The only thing I've seen people do that I cannot, is that stupid fucking squatting spinning overhead strike that goes thru blocks. And honestly? I wouldn't play that way even if I COULD with a controller."
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,ia_Flame,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:39:26 2015 UTC,"it's completely fine if you enjoy playing with a controller, although a mouse and keyboard would probably be more accurate.   strike that goes thru blocks   i know it looks stupid, but it doesn't go through blocks.  as long as both you and your opponent have reasonable ping, you can definitely parry any swing, even the stupid fucking squatting spinning overheads.  You learn to recognize these attacks and block them.  The best defense, however, is just backing up and hitting them after they miss you."
ChivalryGame,3aus3e,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:48:23 2015 UTC,I would think you wouldn't be able to parry as effectively or drag as effectively either

I switched a long time ago and never looked back but a controller is perfectly fine if you're just playing casually.

There aren't enough people subscribed to ChivalryGame to make downvotes actually matter, so I'm not at all bothered by that. What actually matters is if your Bluetooth helmet is as badass as you were hyping it up to be."
ChivalryGame,3astnc,Clayton-BigsB,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:41:49 2015 UTC,yeah me and my bud tested it out over the weekend. It makes riding that much better of an experience to where you can talk to your buddy while riding and not have to wait for every stop. Also easier to give directions and shit. Plus i can listen to music inside the shell and not need earbuds. All the controlson the outside and has ez voice commands too. Def cool as shit and worth. Plus the range on mine is damn near a mile.

ChivalryGame,3aozki,Derodyne,17,Mon Jun 22 09:19:24 2015 UTC,I am also a level 19 noob. When I have to fight more than one at a time I pretend to aim at someone but I hit his teammate next to him instead. It seems to be working for me so far.
ChivalryGame,3aozki,gregmolick,18,Mon Jun 22 12:05:02 2015 UTC,"Well done! This is known as target switching and is a very effective tactic - even at higher level gameplay. In addition, in a 2v1 scenario when you block an attack, you should try to riposte/target switch into the other opponent (it will often lead to a hit since he is off guard)"
ChivalryGame,3aozki,Oskoff,2,Mon Jun 22 14:05:12 2015 UTC,"That's a very good strategy. If the person I'm fighting isn't really a threat, like they missed or are getting too far away I'll straight up run passed them and target someone else. I imagine it pisses people off even more thinkin ""WTF! Fight me like a man!"""
ChivalryGame,3aozki,JimiJons,4,Mon Jun 22 17:24:49 2015 UTC,You'll go far
ChivalryGame,3aozki,bigpersonguy,4,Mon Jun 22 23:59:36 2015 UTC,"Additionally, if you combo straight into another attack back on the original target, you'll probably catch him in wind-up since he thinks you're exposed and achieve the same effect twice. Sometimes, if you're lucky and both your targets are overzealous, you can chain 3+ hits and get lots of free damage."
ChivalryGame,3aozki,Ad_For_Nike,10,Tue Jun 23 01:45:36 2015 UTC,I do this seems to work fine 50% of the time all the time.  http://i.imgur.com/vjwiB.gif
ChivalryGame,3aozki,YourMoneyOrYourLife,10,Mon Jun 22 15:25:08 2015 UTC,"hit the person who's not looking at you, not the guy blocking.  team fights are all about getting those free hits and damage out as quickly as possible.  try to create 2v1's or at least 1v1's in any given situation and be aware of what everyone else is doing, dont get tunnel vision and remember to target switch if the person you're fightings defence is strong."
ChivalryGame,3aozki,TheSecretMe,4,Mon Jun 22 10:01:11 2015 UTC,"To add on, playing defensively is usually better.  You can't do much for your teammates if you charge in swinging, get a couple hits, die, and leave your teammates to fend for themselves.  That said, its sometimes best to retreat and leave your teammates to die if they charge into a fight you guys can't lose.  Try to help your teammates.  If they're going into a fight, go with them to help them.  Just your presence will help them as its another person for the enemies to watch out for.  If then enemy starts a swing towards somebody else, go in for a hit and start your combo.  But whenever you attack, always be prepared incase the enemy somehow does block and does riposte.  You've got the right idea, OP.  This is probably the harder playstyle since aiming and positioning aren't always easy when you could probably get a decent KD by simply swinging but you'll probably be more helpful when it comes to getting the objective."
ChivalryGame,3aozki,ToLazy4Name,5,Mon Jun 22 12:51:00 2015 UTC,"Mind your sweeps, it's very easy to hit friends. When in close quarters, thrusts are smarter.  Flanking is key. If an enemy is focused on you, concentrate on blocking while your friend flanks him. If he's focused on your friend, flank and attack his undefended side.  There's no shame in retreating. If your group takes casualties or if you've been a little too eager, just retreat and regroup. There's no point in throwing a life away, it just helps their cause.  A good retreat can always lure over eager enemies into charging your own group."
ChivalryGame,3aozki,ShellCompany,4,Mon Jun 22 10:31:13 2015 UTC,Footwork and target switching.
ChivalryGame,3aozki,Xylvion,3,Mon Jun 22 18:26:02 2015 UTC,"Avoid being too close to your team and mind their swings like it was a FFA. I am more on guard for stray blades around teammates than I am when I come into contact with the enemy by myself. At least I know what the enemy intends to do to me.  Block an enemy and use the riposte to hit his teammate instead of whoever struck you. You'll see this all the time among good players. If you see they blocked your teammate, their riposte may very well come straight for your face. Use this idea to spring between two or more attackers until they die.   Let your teammates attack the enemy and force the enemy to block and then use that exact moment as your opportunity to strike them when they are unable to block a second time.  Don't be afraid of backing out of a fight you can't win. Walk back behind the line to get some health. Don't feel bad for not running in to back up a beginner who has rushed out to a losing fight. If they're bad then their death will mean nothing and if they're good then they probably know what they're doing and they don't expect anybody to rush in and save them.   As far as playing the objective, try and work your way toward one and set up a group at whatever the objective is. Hold it with a core group until the fight is won. Be ready to fall back if the numbers are beginning to work against you.   One more thing: If you are facing a really good player, don't be afraid to attack through your teammates in order to kill a major threat. It's not the nicest thing but it does benefit your team. Sometimes you've got to be willing to trade a pawn for a rook. Use with extreme restraint."
ChivalryGame,3aozki,MrJoeSteam,3,Mon Jun 22 13:02:56 2015 UTC,"Target switching that has been mentioned is a good way in any 1vN situation.  Try to use your footwork so only one opponent can hit you properly, preferably by making them line up, that will give you a chance to attack them and be on the offensive. If you get surronded you're pretty much screwed."

ChivalryGame,3aozki,muchverygood,2,Mon Jun 22 18:06:57 2015 UTC,"Just to add to what everyone said, Something I do now and again is run off and if they give chase, I'll turn and hit the guy closest to me and then turn right around and keep going. You can sort of force them into 1v1s this way if you know the maps well. Just be VERY wary of the chase mechanic, though. Turn corners, switch direction, run through firepots, whatever you can do to keep them from No2-ing up to you and having their way with your butt. You can do this quite well as MAA/VG vs a group of Knights/VGs. And really try hard to not get surrounded or concaved, that's how u get rekt m8.  E: Fixed idiotic wording."
ChivalryGame,3aozki,Zexis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:07:42 2015 UTC,"Everyone pretty much covered everything, so id say just be very aware of all the weapons being used in your proximity. Ex: Don't go for a stab when you see a teammate/enemy walking up to attack with a zwei/polearm."

ChivalryGame,3aozki,Aekisii,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"1vX try to block attacks until you find an opportunity to riposte onto a target, preferably not the person that you blocked. Follow up with some spins (if you can) and try to avoid getting surrounded, that means back off or use the enemy teammate as a pillar, so his other teammates cant get a clear strike at you without murdering eachother  Follow your teammates, and even better follow the high rank players, this will create a ""zerg"" where your teammates group up and go on a gangbang party expedition. But if you see one going on a solo expedition, you might want to leave him to his own devices"

You can add me on steam if you wanna play sometime, I'm by no means amazing at this game but i can show you a few things. Surely other redditors that play this game would also be more than happy to help out/answer any questions you have.   One tip I can give you to start out is don't take this game too seriously, don't try to play this for realism either. You will enjoy this game more if you just play it for a laugh.

ChivalryGame,3ama55,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Tue Jun 23 14:41:28 2015 UTC,I've just recently (about a week ago) started playing again. I'm currently level 22 and I can roflstomp about 85% of the players on public servers so I'd say there are more than enough new players.  If you play Team Objective you can expect to see four or so really good players out of 30 if you play on a server without level restrictions so you shouldn't have a too hard time finding people that'll give you a fighting chance. Simply avoid the really good ones or take them as a challenge.  Start with Vanguard or Knight and stick with a weapon that you're comfortable with and you'll git gud in no time. Summer Sale brought so many new players that you won't get destroyed by high level players all the time.

ChivalryGame,3ama55,KevinSpacey-,4,Sun Jun 21 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"I play casually and while starting out was hard you do get better with time put in. There are instructional videos of all sorts. High level players are often willing to help newer players if they show an interest in learning the mechanics. While there are elitist fags this game is absurdly fun for the price tag. I'm at 330 hours and not even close to bored. If you put in the time and don't ragequit too easy you can become a competent player. The community imo is whole other reason to have the game.

If they're going around you hard on the right or left, there are times when you have to go totally past their weapon altogether to parry it."

ChivalryGame,3an10f,Soneca,2,Mon Jun 22 16:24:11 2015 UTC,"Just one thing to note, the parry area is pretty wide but not very tall - if somebody overheads you, looking up is very important."
ChivalryGame,3an10f,ninjacapo,2,Mon Jun 22 01:18:35 2015 UTC,"To add to what others have said it's important to wait to block until your opponent actually swings their weapon. Often times players will either feint or wait for you to block so that they can either stab sides or jump and overhead. You'll need to block in the direction of the attack so look up, left etc."

ChivalryGame,3alnet,Manncaalaah,1 point,Sun Jun 21 13:25:09 2015 UTC,"but the hunting dagger uses slashes right? i switched to dagger from shortsword because i wanted to unlock the veteran helmet but realized after that you dont need to unlock the secondaries.  Shortsword is great but i got so much succes with the dagger, just use the overhead for a stab and it deals so much damage and it's hard to block when i strafe around someone."
ChivalryGame,3alnet,Reithur,2,Sun Jun 21 20:48:47 2015 UTC,Depends; do you want speed or damage?  Take a look at the speeds and decide which one you think will work for you.  Play around with both and see which one you like.  Weapons that require you to unlock them doesn't necessarily make them better than the default weapon.
ChivalryGame,3alnet,Charles_K,3,Sun Jun 21 13:28:56 2015 UTC,I think the .45 nerf makes them both the same speed now lol

ChivalryGame,3alnet,Stael,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:54:41 2015 UTC,thrusting is the only viable dagger and the best archer weapon against knights  when using a dagger against anything else you will get fucked by range though so just take shortsword like everyone else or if you really want to be a special flower sabre is actually decent
ChivalryGame,3alnet,Xylvion,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:41:35 2015 UTC,"Tdagger is longer, OH deals the same damage as shorsword stab, the stab is the same as broad dagger stab, the slash is really weak, but you never need to use it, ever. Broad Dagger, no real reason to use it. Hunting Dagger, easy to 2shot archers with OH's, saber is better either way or just use tdagger."
ChivalryGame,3alnet,Jonks,0,Mon Jun 22 17:31:00 2015 UTC,Thrusting all day everyday. Daggers are best when using the overhead because of the extra range and chance to hit the head for extra damage.
ChivalryGame,3amsx6,pantsbeard,9,Sun Jun 21 19:36:44 2015 UTC,"Because of the flails lack of riposte you need to use the shield stab to keep initiative.  If someone is just trading away because of how slow the overhead and lmb are, train your opponent to expect the super fast stab so that hes less likely to gamble. Once he stops trying to take back initiative, use your more powerful attacks.  Also, don't use flail as its terrible."
ChivalryGame,3amsx6,Jonks,3,Sun Jun 21 21:04:37 2015 UTC,Check out teripper on Youtube; he explains quite a few techniques.

ChivalryGame,3amsx6,ColonelHerro,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:04:35 2015 UTC,I don't understand.
ChivalryGame,3amsx6,Clayton-BigsB,3,Mon Jun 22 10:06:39 2015 UTC,"He's saying that 'hit-trades' (where both players hit each other at the same time, and both take damage) shouldn't be a thing. A lot of people (myself included) would prefer 'weapon clashing', where simultaneous hits will clash and act like a parry.  This is because being able to hit trade lets people play as a caveman knight, just looking down and gambling with powerful weapons knowing they'll win most trades.  But this is all about the meta - Your issue is that you can't riposte with shield, and the heavy flail is slow (and pretty terrible, tbh, but if you're having fun, go to town). As others have said, you'll need to use your shield bash (stab) as a quick attack to regain initiative and stop them from being able to gamble on your slow attacks.  Another tip - if you're using tower shield, you can get more range by looking up in the air, so you're hitting them with the corner of the shield :)"
ChivalryGame,3amsx6,ColonelHerro,2,Mon Jun 22 10:14:43 2015 UTC,"i could care less about clashing, it was never a part of this game. What was a part of this game is and always was flinching, but you can't flinch shit anymore without hitting the other person before they even think about swinging. Faster weapons hardly mean shit anymore, and flinch times and recovery times are totally broken on a per weapon basis."

ChivalryGame,3amsx6,Reithur,3,Sun Jun 21 20:12:35 2015 UTC,"I think he means that he can't get a hit in because every time he swings, he gets flinched.    I would recommend not using a flail and not using a shield while you're learning.  Concentrate on blocking their swings and not attacking them.  When you successfully block, attack them right away(reposte) and you won't be flinched."
ChivalryGame,3amsx6,thefranchise23,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:36:35 2015 UTC,"That is what I meant, and can you riposte after a shield block?"
ChivalryGame,3amsx6,Fiesty43,3,Sun Jun 21 21:02:33 2015 UTC,Shields don't permit riposte.  Try giving them a kick to give yourself some room.  Press F.
ChivalryGame,3amsx6,Kesby,0,Sun Jun 21 21:14:43 2015 UTC,Is it better to use standard kick or heavy kick with a shield?
ChivalryGame,3amsx6,ColonelHerro,2,Sun Jun 21 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"Heavy kick takes longer to wind up, but it can stun people if they have a shield up.  If you need space, just use regular kick."

As for class vanguard with a greatsword is good for starting out.  Vans aren't super squishy like man-at-arms and are faster then knights.  If you prefer to tank more than a knight with a longsword is a good place to start.  Moe Pork has a lot of good videos to learn from.  One big thing when fighting in groups is to do more stabbing and overhead attacks.  Slashes (LMB) in a group fight will just hit your teammates more than the enemy.

During the first session I leveled up several times, apparently I earned certain experience, but I have no idea how to spend that XP, I'm not even sure there's a perk tree or anything of the sort (I only found customization, but that is cosmetics)"
ChivalryGame,3akj3a,BackesIsMyHero,3,Sun Jun 21 12:04:02 2015 UTC,You get XP for each kill.  Each rank(level) requires a certain amount of XP.  All XP and rank do is tell someone about how many kills you have. You can look at this rank calculator to see what it takes to get to each rank.  There is nothing to spend XP on.
ChivalryGame,3akj3a,id_fake,2,Sun Jun 21 13:57:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you! So, basically, the only progress is unlocking new weapons after you killed certain amount of enemies with a certain weapon class?  Then do the next unlocked weapons give any advantage? Are they way better than the default weapons? Is there anything apart from actual personal experience separating the new players and the players with many unlocks?"

Messer, Sword of War, and Maul for knight.  Vans you will pretty much see everything.    Personal experience is what will sets people apart, not the weapons."
ChivalryGame,3akj3a,id_fake,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:04:13 2015 UTC,Thank you!
ChivalryGame,3akj3a,Fiesty43,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:46:19 2015 UTC,Longsword is also fairly common for knights.
ChivalryGame,3akj3a,Exelic,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:19:47 2015 UTC,Longsword and poleaxe for knight too.
ChivalryGame,3akj3a,Kugelhagelfisch,2,Mon Jun 22 20:13:21 2015 UTC,"In every row of weapons there is usually a faster but weaker, a slower but stronger and a weapon between those two.  So no, they are often not straight up upgrades but just different. If you feel like you're doing well with one it's absolutely legit to stick to it as there are barely any weapons that are complete rubbish. Just don't play flails. They suck and are just good for a laugh."
ChivalryGame,3akj3a,thefranchise23,2,Tue Jun 23 13:58:54 2015 UTC,"Try out different classes and weapons and play with what you like the best.   Like someone else said, great sword for vanguard and longsword for Knight is a good place to start,  but it's really a personal preference.      Many Knight and vanguard weapons can one shot archers and MAA if they hit you in the head with an overhead swing.   The only weapon that can one shot a knight is the maul.    What are you asking about head shots with swords?"
ChivalryGame,3akj3a,ColonelHerro,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:19:42 2015 UTC,thanks man and I meant 1 swing kill on head now I know
ChivalryGame,3akj3a,Reithur,2,Sun Jun 21 03:28:56 2015 UTC,"As others have said, I'd start with either greatsword vanguard, or longsword knight - They're both quite well rounded loadouts, that will let you learn the basics quite well.  I'd lean towards knight for beginners - You have a bit less range and damage, but a lot more health, which gives you a bit more staying power in a fight, and a bit more of an opportunity to learn. But try vanguard - its what I started with, and you may prefer it :)  Once you have the basics and can contribute a little in a TO match, I'd jump on a classic duels server and get the combat down a bit more. They're great places to learn and there's often people willing to help, so just ask and someone might coach you.  Good luck!"
ChivalryGame,3akj3a,Fiesty43,2,Sun Jun 21 05:15:56 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  If you haven't already played through it, play the tutorial; it'll get you through the most basic of basics.  Check out Moe Pork and teripper (start here) on Youtube.  Some general tips:  Sometimes it's difficult to tell the teams apart; go into your Customization panel and take a look at the different colours and armour for Agatha (Lion symbol, primarily blue, with white & gold) and Mason (Eagle symbol, primarily red, with black & brown).  When a player is damaged, they get bloodied; Blue can look like red if they're hurt enough, so be careful not to kill your teammates.  You will be killed many times.  Sometimes you will not know how it happened.  This is part of the game and learning how to play.  Try to understand what happened and why it happened.  Look at the ""You were killed by"" box that pops up and at the kill feed in the upper-right corner for more info.  When you're around teammates, use your mousewheel (scroll up/down) for attacks, not the left mouse button (it's called LMB around the Chivalry community).  Use the right mouse button (RMB) to parry incoming attacks.  It's not an automatic parry; you have to time them properly AND look towards the tip of the weapon for a parry to work.  Start off using a Knight with Longsword until you get the hang of the mechanics.  You'll have lots of health, which means you'll survive a bit longer to learn more from each life.  Your attacks are controlled by where you point your mouse cursor; you can speed up or delay attacks by moving the cursor to the left or right or up & down.  This will change the timing on when and where your strikes land.  Use this to try to make the opponent parry too soon or too late.  This is called dragging; you drag your cursor to change the attack.  You will see many players using these techniques to try to trick you into blocking too early or too late.  It is part of how the game was made, so don't get angry for being tricked.    Skilled players (often wearing black or gold helmets) may spin or look down or up before or during an attack to change where and when their strikes will hit you.  Again, this is part of the game, but it will take some practice to learn to avoid getting hit.   In a similar respect, Feinting an attack is also part of the game.  It's most basic use is covered in the tutorial, so don't be surprised or upset if someone uses it against you.  Successfully blocking a feinted attack at the right time is called ""reading feints"" in the community and it takes a lot of practice to learn.  By practice, I mean ""getting smashed in the face after a feint and feeling like an idiot for falling for it.""  Ranks don't give you more health or damage. You don't get upgrades in this game. Ranks only mean time spent in the game and higher ranks have spent more time learning how the game works. You earn some helmets when you reach certain ranks (silver, black, and gold).  You will be killed many times by these players, so be cautious around them; the helmets are like the patterns on a snake to tell you that they're dangerous.   Weapon, helmet or character skins don't provide any bonuses; they are purely cosmetic.   Yes, this is a hack and slash game, but it's more than just spamming the Left Mouse Button slash attacks to win.  Feel free to ask questions in chat (press ""Y"" so everyone can see what you'll say, or ""T"" for just your teammates) or here on reddit.  Hope some of this helps out!  R"

Messer is probably the easiest weapon to do well with, crazy power+very easy to use.  You can equip Maul or Brandistock and wreck as much shit as with Messer, but they're harder to use and require some experience.  Man At Arms class with Norse Sword is absurdly OP, but very noob-unfriendly in my opinion. At level 0-15 you would probably find it useless and wonder how you can even stay alive for a while, but after couple houndred hours in the game you'll actually feel sorry for the people you kill over and over again by going scroll-up+xx2 all the time.  Zweihander, Spear and Sword of War are also very powerful, but require specific playstyles, and are not that noob-friendly either. Well, Zweihander is in FFA mode, but we're talking team-objective here."

Dimicator/Roland Warzecha (Buckler and Shield expert/ Viking combat research. Some demonstrations and sparring.) Sword Carolina (Has a series on the German tradition of longsword. I know these guys; they are some really cool dudes. Instructional videos. I don't think they have sparring videos, though.) David Coblentz (I know this guy personally, also. He is the Master-at-Arms of his fencing school and the best user of the rapier that I know of (He specializes in the Italian tradition). Instructional videos and some technical demonstrations.) Copenhagen Historical Fencing Club (Has footage from historical fencing tournaments.) Academy of Historical Fencing (A lot of mixed weapons sparring. They are alright. Not very informative, though) Skallagrim (I am actually not a big fan of this guy, but he is pretty big in the marketing of the Historical Fencing scene, at least. His stuff is pretty speculative, but is well-grounded enough. Lots of mixed weapon sparring videos, but I am meh about it.)   I have a HUGE list.

I found the best way to have fun in the game is to just enjoy it on your own with friends or casually. Clans such as Tempest, Syndicate, UnderDogs, Rangers, ETC. are always fighting amongst themselves on here and the official Chivalry forums, and it's all just drama. Stubborn people (sorry Children*)have molded this game into something horrendous competitive-wise. Avoid all the ""clans"" and just have fun playing. You can often find balanced pub matches, just look for good servers of whatever game mode you prefer with low pings.  EDIT: People have been hackused in the past and BANNED mind you, Ŧ |Spook.

Honestly nobody really takes the game seriously enough to lose sleep over petty inter-clan drama.

The weapon and class balance is based around these new mechanics, for example, archers now have projectile flinch again but lower range damage as a tradeoff, making the class more suited towards supporting rather than carrying.

ChivalryGame,3aikgf,Charles_K,3,Sat Jun 20 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"If June 2013 was Jurassic Park, June 2015 is Jurassic World. Hackers and accusations are bjgger, faster, stronger, smarter. Instead of the game being updated for worse, we got mercs mod and some cool maps though."
ChivalryGame,3aikgf,iWorkWithCows,5,Sun Jun 21 00:23:16 2015 UTC,"Let me just clarify, this games community is split up and each childish clan likes to attack eachother, this game has had hackers in the past in tournaments where the developers of the game had to ban one or two people. All and all this game can be hacked easily because its made on Unreal 3, too many nerds take this shitty game seriously and that's where this entire sub-reddits attitude come from, a bunch of stubborn children who refuse to grow up and get along. Welcome to Chivalry, the game with the childish joke of a community. It's better to just play with friends a few times and leave this game to collect dust, don't waste hundreds of hours like myself or many of these other losers have wasted on this game that is going nowhere (PS Devs left it to die a long time ago)"

ChivalryGame,3ak0qv,Jonks,7,Sat Jun 20 23:22:00 2015 UTC,"It's ashamed that a long standing community member chooses to be so toxic.  You cause other people to get up in arms about the admins and the rules, and are given many free passes simply because we know you.  The night this happened was the worst of it all.  Me and Butternut were essentially babysitting edgy teens while trying to play chiv, and you being there saying, ""holocaust this"", ""holocaust that"" was just edging on, and not to mention you bad mouth the admins every chance you get.   There is a reason the calmest, nicest person in the group (Cakebread) dislikes you.  You are a cancer to the community and cause issues almost everytime you join the server.   Please do not return."

SSD is not a requirement.   I would verify your cache. Also I an issue joining games from the server list by double clicking them in the past. So try right clicking on the server you want and going to like..  view server properties or some shit like taht wehre you can view the info and try connecting that way. I remember that helped when i had that issue, can't remember what ended up fixing it though."

Just gonna say that trade looked spooky and leave it at that. I've played with curly a lot and have never seen anything spooky like that prior to this. I'm still waiting on my evidence.zip post too : )
ChivalryGame,3ag8vx,BioshockEndingD00D,4,Fri Jun 19 22:46:41 2015 UTC,no lie 2:50 2v1 was pretty fucking sick
ChivalryGame,3ag8vx,Charles_K,2,Fri Jun 19 22:51:24 2015 UTC,Ya it was dank. If this game had more players like curly that could shit on most people easily we'd see more speedhacking accusations. Unfortunately though everyone sucks.
ChivalryGame,3ag8vx,BioshockEndingD00D,3,Fri Jun 19 23:03:14 2015 UTC,"pretty good, i think he 24 - 0'd me last time we dueled (if you rearrange numbers, it spells 4 - 20, coincidence?), his gmace is fucking instant though but i never fought against mercs gmace so i didn't know if it was just that fucking stupid broken weapon or what  i mean, basically no one has 24 - 0'd me since f| classic duel server was still a thing (some Japanese messer player pwned me ~ 100 - 4 or so). Not rentanus (though u used to have long streak vs me), not stinker, not robowner, not omega, not sp00ky. curly doesn't afraid of anything, though i did throw about at least four of those duels (so either way, it would've been 24 - 0 or 20 - 4 aka 420)"

You can definitely hack if you're a casual player and in fact that's what most hackers are, casual players, they often don't care about the competitive aspect of the game and hack out of curiosity.

ChivalryGame,3ahkmj,Fiesty43,2,Sat Jun 20 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"The problem lies in that you can't just simply allow posts with alleged ""proof"" and remove everything else that falls under witch hunting. A hackusation is a hackusation, whether it's true or not. And even if it is, in this game, you can never prove that someone is hacking. Trying to stop people from doing it is like fighting a losing battle. The only thing that could potentially stop hacking in CMW is a better anti cheat system from TBS.

ChivalryGame,3ag92q,the_kanguru,8,Fri Jun 19 23:41:41 2015 UTC,"I want to go over two things here. The first is how we clarify a hacker. You can not look at a youtube video, see a ""spooky"" stab and call someone a speed hacker and try and ruin their reputation. You will need hard evidence of some other sort which COULD include videos. Yet you would need much more than that. There is simply no way to 100% call someone a for sure hacker unless they are kicked from the servers and Vac banned. There are fishy players of course that have been brought up in the past, yet no hard proof was ever shown for them either. Having two or three people band together and call someone a hacker and make a reddit post about does nothing but hurt the community.   Two, what exactly do you wanna call hacking? There is the obvious speed hacks and what not, but what about this new desync bug that is going around? You can make yourself desync any attack on purpose and this can be a game changer. I know some quoted ""top players"" that use this shit and get away with it. I've seen it in scrims, pubs, tournaments. Would that be called hacking too?   This post you made here could be used to better the community like you said, yet as soon as we start calling individuals out, this post goes to shit."
ChivalryGame,3ag92q,Flotchy,2,Fri Jun 19 23:08:44 2015 UTC,"Theres a debug tool which lets you tell whats a hacker and whats normal speeds, video allow this to be confirmed as actual hack or nt  hackers are easy to deal with, players with extensive time on the game can feel awkard and flat-out wrong timings. other players are paranoid or just shit  the cancer has spread across the continent to EU, crush antihack when"
ChivalryGame,3ag92q,Kesby,-6,Mon Jun 22 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"If the video doesn't show hard evidence of someone hacking it won't ruin their reputation, I don't see why you seem to think that. I don't see why a video with several unedited, non-cherry-picked clips of his stabs clearly going faster than they're supposed to isn't considered ""hard evidence"". As for the vac statement goes, You realize Vac is only one anticheat right? there are several other ways to detect a hacker than just vac, in fact in most games other anti-cheats are far more reliable and accurate than VAC's, so that statement is false.  I'd say hacking is using a third party client to give yourself an unfair advantage over other players."
ChivalryGame,3ag92q,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,8,Fri Jun 19 23:25:22 2015 UTC,You remind me in a way of a popular senator named Joseph McCarthy back in the day.

ChivalryGame,3ag92q,Kwaziii,2,Fri Jun 19 23:28:47 2015 UTC,"It's one stab that to me isn't even suspect. Boner started his windup after curly and didn't even look down with his OH. If anything it definitely should of traded. I was just using VAC as an example also. Not to mention if someone has an advantage that lets them hit others with no chance of them blocking, such as the desync issue going on. How is that not considered unfair to others? How is that different than hacking?"
ChivalryGame,3ag92q,Anstii,-4,Sat Jun 20 01:06:13 2015 UTC,"Except boner definitely started winded up first and he didn't have to look down because it was a handle hit and hit first frame of release regardless, as I stated in the post.  edit: It's not different from hacking in the fact that you get an unfair advantage but it's different in the fact that when it's a third party program it's intentionally trying to give yourself an unfair advantage.  edit2: Are you trying to say people accidentally desyncing is just as bad as hacking? or vice-versa that hacking is as minuscule as someone accidentally desyncing? Why am I even replying to you."
ChivalryGame,3ag92q,Anstii,2,Sat Jun 20 01:09:29 2015 UTC,tbh people making a joke of this probably let the actual hackers keep hacking with their possible subtle windup changes but unless you can record them frame by frame for proof it'll be pretty hard to find them

ChivalryGame,3ac9cl,Reithur,2,Fri Jun 19 03:35:44 2015 UTC,"You press M while in a spawn location.  Select a class to get full health and ammo.  You don't even have to change classes, just pick the same one again.  Trouble is, the game doesn't distinguish between teams when you do this, so you can jump into the enemy spawn and keep healing up.  Good map designs have spawn locations that are inaccessible to players once they leave the area to prevent this from happening or to prevent archer camping."

ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,CRUSHED1337,0,Thu Jun 18 23:35:11 2015 UTC,"Will, did you speed up any of the parts with curly playing? If not he's blatantly speedhacking...  edit: even if it is sped up he's still hacking...  The first clip of curly in the beginning of the video is hard for me to analyze right now, but I'm pretty tired and didn't look very hard, I may edit this post in the morning, but right around here is where I get the term ""blatantly"" from:..   https://youtu.be/qGP2r6-cnos?t=172   As you can see from the very first stab riposte it looks like it hits absurdly fast, the animation seems very sped up.  right after that stab you can notice him get a second fast stab in after missing once @https://youtu.be/qGP2r6-cnos?t=176 (2:56) and comboing, now even for a combo stab, it hits absurdly fast, and right after that he combos into an overhead but the overhead isn't the important part, the important part is that he does a full 180 in only a couple of frames (Mind you, it's slowed down quite heavily, and your turn caps shouldn't allow you to do a full 180 during a combo that quickly.  After that bit comes the single most obvious piece of evidence there is in the entire video. https://youtu.be/qGP2r6-cnos?t=185 (3:05) you can see him rushing up to engage the vanguard. He rushes up, blocks an attack and doesn't riposte, at this point you can slow down the footage to .25 speed (thank you based youtube) and you can see that both players don't riposte or combo, meaning their windups should match exactly with the weapon timings for mercs patch 1.9.1. in which, (correct me if I'm wrong) Halberd overhead should have a much faster windup than longsword stab, and if you slow it down and watch closely, The halberd overhead animation is started before the longsword stab, and since the halberd is going to handlehit, it's going to hit in the very first frame, as well as the long sword stab, since the stab is starting inside the vanguard's body. Therefor, since both weapons are going to hit in the first frame, and the halberd overhead is started first, there's no possible way that curly can hit trade him, because it's mercs mod, RIGHT? Yet that's exactly what ends up happening in the video. The only way this would be possible is if halberd overhead had the same windup as longsword stab which I'm fairly certain it does NOT."
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,Rob_Owner,5,Fri Jun 19 03:25:49 2015 UTC,"i dunno about the rest but the thing at 3:05 is bs  halberd oh windup is .6, longsword stab is .65 plus halberd handlehits somewhat and winds up earlier by a good amount, theres no way it should have traded there  the whole point of fhf is being able to punish and flinch people who parry you and then are too slow on the input (no riposte and shit), which is exactly what he does  we have a few subtle speedhackers in eu aswell, and one pattern i noticed is they go for alot of attacks when they should get flinched and this is very distinguishible in their playstyle from normal good players  EDIT: just to clarify, im not saying its speedhack, just bs. couldve been desync or high pings, anyway that trade shouldnt have happend"
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,BioshockEndingD00D,3,Fri Jun 19 14:29:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Curly started his attack at least half a second before Raw did. Raw was literally just gambling. Curly is a good player, he's always been good. Calm down, don't jump on a bandwagon."
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,massikaroz,3,Fri Jun 19 19:30:25 2015 UTC,"you can clearly see the halberd started attack first tho, you even say it yourself ""raw was literally just gambling"""
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,Koiuki,2,Fri Jun 19 19:34:43 2015 UTC,"Well I saw him hesitate so I went for it, in the video I trade him twice and that is how I died, I assumed I could kill him after the first trade when I tried flinching him because I assumed my teammates must have hit him at some point, but I assumed wrong, and so I was vanilla'd with trades. Should have used Pole-hammer."

ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,3,Fri Jun 19 04:57:22 2015 UTC,"the stab riposte at the beginning looks completely normal, Infernal just doesn't react in time(he has 88 ping in this video)  the last hit trade doesn't look that weird to me either, I watched that part at .25 speed 10 times and I'm still not sure which of them starts their attack first. It's really that close, so don't say ""the halberd overhead animation is started before the longsword stab"", did you even watch the video? have you tried to replicate that in-game or did you just go straight to accusing someone of being a ""blatant"" speedhacker? you and Zombo thinking that this looks sketchy shouldn't mean anything to anyone because neither of you are even close to being capable of making these kinds of plays...   sword stabs and polearm overheads obviously have very different animations, so comparing their windups doesn't mean much. even with handlehits, halberd overhead isn't a very fast attack  curly had 92 ping, Boner had 84. I guess a single laggy hit trade is all the evidence we need to prove someone is cheating. pack it up curly, hacker confirmed  gg no re EXPOSED by zombo and koi"
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,FireIsBad,4,Fri Jun 19 05:13:58 2015 UTC,you are right that you cant call someone a speedhacker based on 1 trade with high pings but tbh i saw the halberd attack first even without slow motion so yeah not sure why you would try to convince people of something that simply isnt true
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,Koiuki,2,Fri Jun 19 21:21:25 2015 UTC,"eh watch it again in slomo, it's closer than you think"
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,-2,Fri Jun 19 21:37:12 2015 UTC,"It is fairly close but even then, windup for longsword stab is much longer than halberd overhead."
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,FireIsBad,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:41:28 2015 UTC,dat .05 difference
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,Flotchy,4,Fri Jun 19 21:42:51 2015 UTC,HUGE
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,Koiuki,-2,Fri Jun 19 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"you are even close to being capable of making these kinds of plays...   I'm not capable of hit trading a halberd overhead with a longsword stab if we start windup at the same time? Gee, I wonder why I wouldn't be capable of that and curly would be? You said it yourself   I'm still not sure which of them starts their attack first.    if they both started at the same time, you realize halberd still wins that right? there's no way the ls stab should've traded there, even if he started the stab first."
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,Ziios,2,Fri Jun 19 21:49:20 2015 UTC,"if they both started at the same time, you realize halberd still wins that right?   Not exactly true. Halberd has half handle tracers (tracers that don't hit or do damage) than in vanilla which prevent it from hitting instantly in release, requiring it to be in release for a short while to land, while the longsword in stab release hits instantly because it's practically already inside the other player's model. Add on to the fact that Raw Boner didn't even lookdown overhead, he had a much longer release to hit Curly with. With both attacks being queued up at about the same time, and the attacks times being practically similar considering the handle tracers, where the weapon is released, and 80+ ping between both players, it's unsurprising to say the least that it happened to be a hit trade. It's not like the LS has to hit first anyways to get a trade. I have played halberd for hundreds of hours, and it happens all the time against LS knights. I guess every longsword knight is a speedhacker as well."
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,Koiuki,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:25:35 2015 UTC,"Coming from us baddy vannys. I personally hit trade with Ls all the time, if I don't play defensively i'll experience hit trades all day long. If i'm attacking like raw did in the scenario it's because i'm gambling or going for the interrupt. But I don't understand why he would expect an interrupt when the halberd isn't even being accelerated."
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,3,Fri Jun 19 21:42:47 2015 UTC,"You're claiming you can tell someone is speed hacking with no honest evidence. There is no way you can see all the frames in the game from a youtube video. Not to mention adding ping to the situation. You can't measure fractions of time with the naked eye honestly. Assuming this was also on the Tempest server, doesn't tempest have an anti cheat on their server or some shit? A huge reason this game never got anywhere past 6 clans and 40 viewers watching a tournament is because when there is competition and players reaching a high skill level, there is always accusations of hacking. Same thing happened with Bigs. Leave this kinda shit alone, so MAYBE the game can grow a bit. Its so annoying seeing shit like this, there are like 100-200 comp players in this game. We should act like a family instead of acting like two siblings trying to play a board game on family game night. Koi, I don't even know who you are, so honestly you should keep your toxic shit out of the community."
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,Koiuki,0,Fri Jun 19 21:52:37 2015 UTC,"This game is small and still growing, and hackers are destroying that, I have a love for this genre just as much as anyone else, if not more, I feel like this genre has the capability of becoming huge, but only if people don't hack and keep everyone away, Chivalry doesn't have an anti-cheat so if there are no accusations we're just going to play with hackers forever and good players are going to start leaving because they just think the game is bullshit and unplayable and unfair. You need to take some time to think what's going to help the game grow more, Hackers roaming free, or condemnation of blatant hackers."

It's pretty easy to tell all your accusations are self motivated and only depend on how much you like a person or not. That's why you are considered bullshitting."
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,CRUSHED1337,-6,Fri Jun 19 20:55:56 2015 UTC,"That's not my clan, that's PB's clan. I didn't say he wasn't a speedhacker, I said I don't think he's hacking now. You're trying to call bullshit on me when you don't even know what you're talking about, also I can look at how syn reacted because it's reddit and posts don't get deleted after 3 days...  edit: Also, I dislike ninja pigs a lot more than curly, curly is fairly chill guy, there's no way it's motivated by whether or not I like them because this is fucking actual footage that wasn't even recorded by me. I'm just pointing out that with the way the timings are there is no possible way he can achieve that speed without hacking, it's fucking impossible.

A thought only shared by what, three folks who have vocalized it at the moment? You don't know the person you're accusing, so you go off of a montage video and take the time to come up with some 'compelling' evidence that he cheats. Again, it's not going to fool anybody with half a brain who actually understands the broken state of Chivalry, and who have taken the time to get to know the relationships, reputations, and folks of the community."
ChivalryGame,3ab8lv,Ziios,-1,Fri Jun 19 21:15:24 2015 UTC,"The validity of an accusation shouldn't stem off of how well I know someone, or how many people agree with me, this isn't a post attempting to start a band wagon, it's a post attempting to show you the truth, and you're blatantly denying it.  I would agree with you about the youtube video being choppy from being slowed down but it was recorded in 60 fps meaning it's extremely similar, if not identical to what you'd see in-game, and it's not choppy at all. It's going frame by frame, Ziios, Meaning you can judge it extremely accurately."

You shouldn't assume because someone is nice that they WILL NOT hack.

Nothing is clear, nothing is proven, you are so quick to call someone out on 'blatant fucking hacking'. Curly told Will to put this video in his montage! Now he gets to enjoy the scrutiny you're providing on a public forum with NO evidence to back up your claims. That's right man, no evidence = no evidence. Check the definition of the word.

You can use that rank filter most likely to find the low rank servers.. but filtering them out would either be a challenge or impossible considering most are not set with any rank limits. So setting a search for a server that HAS rank limits would return none or only the low rank servers which he's trying to avoid."

ChivalryGame,3aa8wo,arenagamer,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:21:09 2015 UTC,"The problem is the server browser relies on manual refresh and your ping to any server varies by millisecond.  Pressing Refresh in the top right will re-poll all available servers again.  What this really means is that if you find a server with 98 ping response the second time you view the server list, you should probably avoid that server; your latency will probably be higher than 100 for most of the time."

ChivalryGame,3abwl4,thefranchise23,2,Thu Jun 18 22:27:48 2015 UTC,"It does make a difference - the visibility of the performance impact will largely depend on your rig's build though.   You will get faster I/O with the SSD - noticeably faster - but if your system is bottle-necking when data packets are passing through/being processed by other components, like the CPU for example, you won't feel a massive increase.  SSD's tend to make the biggest visible difference with OS loading times and information retrieval - I.E. the process of navigating to and launching your game will go faster, but as aforementioned, if you have other components that operate at a slower rate then the system will be limited by the speed of the slowest device(s) in the chain.  TL;DR  - Yes, but watch out for bottle-necking components"

You essentially wasted a slot for a team that could have actually done some good.  Or hell, would've settled for a team that showed up with 6 guys, or a team that didn't have players that were trolling the other team during a charity tournament.  Because of this, if we ever do this again, most likely gonna use a minimum donation as an entrance fee."

And we won are first match, and it doesn't really matter if we got dq'd against tempest, not like anyone especially us were gonna beat them. Id apologies for the trolling but it didn't exist. Kevin spacey had the tempest T in the middle of his name(so not a tag) and that was apparently a big no no even though it wasn't stated in the rules.

I think u and Clinton are funny for the most part.  However, while you may claim I ""know nothing about"" you guys, what I do know is the reason I responded to your comment.  I responded as I did because I don't support taking lightly and making a memetic comment almost bragging about how you guys didn't contribute.    I still like you and wish FL the best in the future, but like I said, if you're going to call attention to something like this and make light of it, then I'm going to call attention to its implications because I don't take helping those that need it lightly."
ChivalryGame,3a4lke,Politician_Cranberry,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:27:17 2015 UTC,"Not trying to makes us look better. because in all honesty, we should have tried harder to donate. But we cant just force clan members to donate. The people that did show up to the tournament, we arent very close to. Joshua, we recruited the day before. Bisquick, we recruited the day of. Kevin spacey is a twat (and basically a last resort player) Obi-wan was a merc.  and Cranberry didnt have the extra money. As for me, Iam only 17 and dont have a credit card/paypal. the only way i could donate would be to ask my parents to use their credit card. (Which they wouldnt let me) The people in our clan that would have donated were not able to show up to the tourney, in fact, like 5 of our really close members had been away for over 12 days. I dont really blame them for not donating to a random charity for a tournament that they were not even apart of. Alot members that were supposed to show up didnt, Me and cranberry were the only people from our ""A-team"" that even showed up. Not saying we are in the right. But we signed up for the tournament with the thought that our members would show up. And if another team really felt strongly about donating then they could have easily done so. You dont have to be participating in the tournament to donate. We do feel bad about not donating and i dont want people to think we didnt even try to donate. No hard feelings."

ChivalryGame,3a2hsn,sesstreets,5,Tue Jun 16 18:53:09 2015 UTC,"Congrats!! Keep up the good work!  If you ever want to practice your dueling in a more casual format, I would suggest trying out the ""classic duel"" servers (most run a custom duelyard map). Although it's technically FFA, players duel each other 1v1 (remember to bow or nod to initiate a duel). There is no waiting for matchmaking or W/L record to worry about. A lot of high rank players spend the majority of their time in these classic duel servers - don't be afraid to ask questions/for help!"
ChivalryGame,3a2hsn,Derodyne,3,Tue Jun 16 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"This is good advice, although I would suggest waiting until you are comfortable with your parrying and can deal with drags. Otherwise you will get repeatedly murderfaced.   But classic duels are a great place to learn!"
ChivalryGame,3a2hsn,arenagamer,2,Tue Jun 16 18:59:59 2015 UTC,"""Learn"" in this instance is equal to bashing your head against a concrete block over and over until finally, maybe, 10 hours in, you figure out how you might get a crack in there and start to figure out how to actually bash through.  But by all means join one, and walk around and mingle because unless you bow to initiate a duel, people who attack you will face retribution."

ChivalryGame,3a3dfb,Chrisfand,5,Tue Jun 16 22:23:34 2015 UTC,"Do blunt weapons do more damage against knights?   Yes, although its not always worth switching weapons just to do that blunt damage. For instance the messer and the double axe are bladed weapons that dispatch knights rather quickly as well. Its all about your preference. I can see using a flanged mace over a broadsword if you're looking for a little more damage against knights while playing as maa.    how do you ""hide stabs""; saw someone in this subreddit mention it   This essentially means hiding the animation. Often looking down or down and to your right while starting the stab animation and then bringing it back forward during release will catch some people off guard.    How to overcome quick stab ripostes? I fail to parry these a lot.   When you figure this one out let me know =)   Any tips against maul users?   Don't rush to parry; give them time. Maul users love to delay their drags and make you parry too early. I've found it best to wait and see if they're going to try to accel or drag.    My kicks sometimes go through enemies and still miss; Are kicks buggy now?   Kicks have always been kinda buggy and unreliable as far as i can recall. Best not to rely on them."

When you figure this one out let me know =)   This might sound weird, but what you can do is somehow get your adrenaline going before you play. If you've got adrenaline in your system, your reaction time is a little faster and you can more easily block those really quick ripostes.  Otherwise I tend to just take note of players who quick riposte a lot and just generally be ready for them to do it."

I fail to parry these a lot.   You just have to parry earlier than you'd think.  If you see your opponent starting a stab riposte, don't worry about reading a feint because they can't feint a riposte.   Any tips against maul users?   Watch out for their drags, stab ripostes, and ROH's.  You could try to abuse their poor range and speed by running back or using a longer weapon.  Most of the maul's attacks are most effective when they're really close to you so keeping them on the defensive can help with keeping them off the offensive, if that makes sense.   My kicks sometimes go through enemies and still miss; Are kicks buggy now?   Kicks have always been buggy."

ChivalryGame,3a3dfb,NippleCannon,5,Wed Jun 17 14:48:40 2015 UTC,"intentionally missing your first swing in a combo and following it up with another   I used to do this a lot, but you'll notice most of the higher rank players don't purposely miss many attacks.  It's a waste of stamina.  It's okay to do it a little bit, but I've personally found that it's usually better to try to hit people rather than try to miss them.     How to overcome quick stab ripostes?   First, is your fps above 60? if it's not, lower settings until it is.  Stab ripostes can be hard to block depending on the weapon, but you'll get better at recognizing the animation and blocking quicker.    Usually, you should be waiting as long as you can to block (just in case your opponent feints or drags his swing), but you can't feint ripostes.  If you see someone riposting with a stab, try to block right away.    Practice will help the most."

Instead of trying to bait your opponent with an attack, try running at them as if you were attempting to close distance (careful not to get in range of their attack) and suddenly holding S and looking up slightly if they attack.

ChivalryGame,3a0u40,BattlerBaster,12,Tue Jun 16 10:03:39 2015 UTC,"The best is being a knight with a towershield on the back, running towards an archer. You see him panic, walking slowly backwards while aiming at you.... And shoots. Schtong. The coward hit an edge of your shield a few inches away from your head.   You can almost see the expressions on his face. The pride of having hit your head for a few milliseconds. Maybe the lag even made him see your helmet flying off. But as he sees you continuing your run, confusion, and then panic ensue. He tries to reload his arbalest or his bow for a last shot. But to no avail. It is too late.   The not-quite-a man quickly switches to his comedy of a blade, sometimes he only has a primitive club ! But your run continues, slowly... When he starts running away from you. He knows his death is coming, he feels it, but his lesser survival instinct kicks in. He turns his back towards you, takes a few steps, hoping to escape his fate. But you, like a bull following a red dot, run even faster...   And schrunk. The maul lands on his head. Big streams of blood blurp out, mixed with his tears, while his already piss-soaked rags cover in mud and blood. You feel the relief, the pride, the blast of the revenge for all his innocent victims. The adrenaline rush is too strong. You rise your weapon, point it to the sky, and a brutal roar covers the rumor of the battlefield.   ""EZ""  Love you archers <3"

ChivalryGame,3a0cbt,9thOmegaZivaObis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:00:40 2015 UTC,You are indeed right and its corrected. We have two raffle games were giving out during kendo so it doesn't take the matches time

ChivalryGame,39yvqi,spaceecake,17,Mon Jun 15 22:23:34 2015 UTC,"For anyone making assumptions about the game from the cinematic trailer alone... c'mon. At least watch the gameplay, then you can at least make semi-valid bitching about how it's third person or ""where muh real-time strikes at"".  So I finally saw some actual gameplay footage. It basically appears to be a mix of Soul Calibur gameplay with much more free movement + Dota/Moba-esque AI creeps + pushing and ganking and whatnot. Because of that, it'll probably have a much bigger emphasis on duels (challenging 1v1 to win the duel and kill their army + secure the objective). Not completely uncomparable with Chivalry since it's sword fighting, but Chiv does seem to offer a lot more freedom in the actual swordplay itself.  The aesthetics of the game certainly meet those sweet AAA standards. Slasher devs are gonna have to work hard to meet audiovisual standards and expectations, which is why it'll probably take them until Q3 2016 at the earliest for a full release even though the combat mechanics are almost fully fleshed out and amazing already. When it comes to environmental art and competitive gameplay, I am not worried at all for Slasher in those aspects due to the competence and competitive familiarity that the devs have demonstrated (their environments on Unity look amazing at max graphics). I only worry about the stuff that the casuals will sweat about (implementation of game modes, PVE, character graphics and animations, facial expressions, etc.), because casuals = $$$ and they really are the lifeblood of any game."

ChivalryGame,39yvqi,Sophax,11,Tue Jun 16 07:51:23 2015 UTC,Here's the gameplay walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp3NKQlJPuo  Looks realy damn good and alot of fun. I hope it does have a competitve aspect to it. Looks like Chivalry got a big competitor when it comes to awesome medieval melee games.
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,bltrocker,7,Tue Jun 16 01:05:26 2015 UTC,Looks like Chiv meets Dynasty Warriors meets that old PS1 gem Bushido Blade. Cool! That obviously scripted walkthrough so cringe though.
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,Kreittis,3,Tue Jun 16 07:03:00 2015 UTC,I get Chiv and DW but how does Bushido Blade fit into this? I don't see any instant kills or passive parries. Unless you just wanted to namedrop it for le epic nostalgias xDD
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,bltrocker,1 point,Tue Jun 16 08:13:19 2015 UTC,It wasn't always instant kills. I was thinking more because of the 3 stances and the look of the swings from those stances.

Could be a cool game, but probably won't share the same traits that makes Chivalry good. Could be great by different merits and standards though, just like how CS:GO can be a good game but not in the same way as Chiv."

ChivalryGame,39yvqi,PrinceNelson,16,Tue Jun 16 00:59:35 2015 UTC,"Looks so clunky. You can tell you don't have anywhere near the control over you character you have Chivalry. Too much emphasis on showy, badassness I think. Having to sit through a 5 second execution, scripted animation looks annoying and completely unsatisfying. In chivalry, you take someone's head off if you aim your slice well (with no interruption to gameplay either). I also think those cannon fodder bots seem pointless. Makes the players look like fucking Sauron on the battle field. The combat looks like a slightly better version of Ryse. People are being way too swept up in the graphics and cinematic looking sword duels, again, much like Ryse."
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,PrinceNelson,5,Mon Jun 15 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"it's just not a replacement for chivalry. But if your into the mount&blade warband stuff and you like the midevil aspect of chivalry, this looks like an awesome game."
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,CRUSHED1337,4,Mon Jun 15 22:55:12 2015 UTC,"This quite clearly doesn't have anywhere near the depth of neither Chivalry or M&B. The combat looks like Ryse - all style, no substance."
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,MisterArathos,5,Mon Jun 15 22:58:22 2015 UTC,Agreed
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,Grockr,2,Tue Jun 16 11:04:40 2015 UTC,"The combat did have three different attack and block directions, like Mount and Blade's four. So it's at least not just light attack, heavy attack and block like many other games."
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,Archangellelilstumpz,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:11:52 2015 UTC,On stage and in MP video they say you choose attack and block direction by mouse/stick movement - similarly to M&B
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,HairyPantaloons,2,Tue Jun 16 20:10:34 2015 UTC,I also think those cannon fodder bots seem pointless.   Kind of like Chivalry?
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,SeaParker,3,Tue Jun 16 11:16:37 2015 UTC,"Look out for the actual gameplay trailer. They played a 4v4 match on the E3 stream, and altough it was third person and probably only on console, it looked modefucking epic."

ChivalryGame,39yvqi,Kreittis,3,Mon Jun 15 22:56:33 2015 UTC,"Oh please, DBTS still has somewhat dedicated fanbase. Hell, there's even some german guy who made a mod that supports modern systems.  Also, that game is avaible on GOG so it's not like its some kind of underground game.  Fun fact: DBTS was developed by Treyarch. You know, the guys who only make Call of Duty sequels these days."

ChivalryGame,39yvqi,Atreides_Fighter,4,Tue Jun 16 11:21:45 2015 UTC,Looks neat. Dont know why everyones shitting on it. Theres a 5 min gameplay trailer here. www.forhonorgame.com  Seems like in the core PvP combat there are 3 'stances' that you attack and defend with i.e. if I attack high the other player has to switch stances and parry high.  I think I saw a feint in there at one point.  There are some other abilities thrown in like calling down a volley of arrows.  Seems like a well made arcadey melee.  It's definitely not chiv combat but it looks cool for what it is.  Oh wait it's third person what a piece of shit 0/10.
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,bigdaddybrazzer,2,Tue Jun 16 13:58:39 2015 UTC,"Feints are basically confirmed, the first samurai he encounters throws one out but the knight doesn't fall for it."

ChivalryGame,39yvqi,oldmoneey,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:29:08 2015 UTC,Ubisoft. The folks who show special versions of the game that don't mirror the quality of the actually published game. The folks who can't even get Assassins Creed right anymore without it being a buggy mess. The folks who manage to fuck up Tetris. TETRIS!  The fighting seems very limited and I don't trust that company at all. Have fun with a consolized Dota/Smite full of bugs and glitches but 25 different pre-order options.  No deal.
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,zhuliks,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:25:03 2015 UTC,Looks horrible by all means.
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,Charles_K,7,Wed Jun 17 05:50:35 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look anything beyond ""medieval combat game"". It's a fucking cinematic trailer."
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,Politician_Cranberry,0,Tue Jun 16 17:22:25 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didnt watch the trailer. I saw a gameplay video before, which showed true looks of the game, which are rather bad. ""Epic"" is very exaggerated term for it. Proportions of body parts and weapons are as if it was drawn by a 12 y.o. fangirl who sucks at drawing, ""gameplay"" was so unbelievably staged, they even had a girl gamer with pink hair (because girl gamers are special), fighting looked more like cheap trailer animation than a proper gameplay.  All that ""look how epic we are"" tryhard coating of the gameplay trailer compared to actual look of it together with bad art style left a very bad impression on me."
ChivalryGame,39yvqi,xxh2p,2,Wed Jun 17 05:30:39 2015 UTC,"The tabards and helmet designs are amazing for the Knights. The animations are obviously super crisp because it's being worked on by a huge dev team. This is giving me some ideas for my next Slasher megathread (concerning helmet designs and tabards and whatnot). The colors are very nice too, not too grim nor overly vibrant to be saccharine. Slasher's environments will actually look very good on max graphics with the power of Unity engine, but they should implement the outward tabards as demonstrated in this game.  But yeah, I really wish the gameplay trailer was more ""natural"" to truly show us how fights would go. Maybe have some really skilled gametesters play some duels out to flex the complexity of the game. Or, if dueling isn't necessarily where the bulk of the game's complexity lies, show off the Dota-esque part of the game more, like more tactical cavalry calls and team fighting and ganking and shit. This is definitely one of the more original games to use the whole Dota schema of few Heroes + minions vs Heroes + minions."

I've gotten quite a bit better in the 30 hours i played so far, i manage to get positive KD ratio's every time i hop on open ranked TO servers now, sometimes even a ratio of 3.0!  The objectives are really fun as well, i have yet to be a king though.  Question: What weapon is better, the sabre or the shortsword? I've read that the falchion isn't even worth it despite it having better stats. (less dmg on stab, which i use quite a lot)."
ChivalryGame,39yni7,Fiesty43,2,Thu Jun 18 12:12:43 2015 UTC,"Team objective is my favourite game mode.  ""Better"" often depends on opinion and your own feel for the weapon in question, but sometimes the numbers don't lie.  Shortsword is generally considered the best secondary.  The stab is pretty powerful, but sabre has a bit more reach.  If you find yourself stabbing a lot, go with the shortsword.  Falchion has really good slash and overhead vs. archers and man at arms, but your shortsword pokes will do well against everyone."

ChivalryGame,39zxzc,sesstreets,7,Tue Jun 16 18:49:34 2015 UTC,"Know this. MAA and Van can punish DOOP quite often in 1v1 scenarios if you facehug. Knights, not so much. DOOP does have limitations, but it is a godsend most of the time. But you do maintain some serious stamina longetivity if you don't DOOP often. However, DOOPing and forcing misses in MAA vs MAA actually puts you in a huge stamina advantage, MAA duels are janky in that falling for feints can actually punish the other guy if he pre-emptively attacks after you fall for a feint.  My honest belief is that NA MAA's... even the ""top"" ones... need a lot of work on their positioning. Basically, always try to engage 1v1s (you need to be very confident in your MAA vs MAA and dueling in general) or peel enemies onto you to make the teamfight easier for your team (e.g. force an enemy to 4v5 your team while you 1v2 their guys, but line them up 1v1v1 like a Bruce Lee movie so you buy as much time possible, very doable with dodges). Don't be afraid to have no firepot and swapping for your shield if it means you can maintain consistent pressure on their archer, a firepot is overpowered yes but it is not even 100% guaranteed with how weird throwing is in this game. A shield Agatha MAA in, say, the sluice gate is much scarier than someone who throws one firepot and has no more to throw until he dies. If a team has an archer that carries the shit out of them but has no MAA or anyone sticking on you in general, you can go straight for their archer while your archer is free to spam on the enemy team without fear of counterarching. This will either force them to have their archer constantly fight a shield MAA (which you definitely should NOT lose) or peel one of them to 2v1 you, hopefully your team is competent enough to win the 5v4 in this case. As for your 2v1, you have shield + dodge, you should stall for a looooong time.  Seriously, don't engage until you get a very good angle. Your teammates are enemies too, assisting your teammates too eagerly without thought on your angling will get you accidentally cut and chopped by allies, that's just as bad as enemies hacking at you if not worse because you can't flinch teammates lol nor do you see them coming. For example, even if that Knight's ass looks wide open for the taking, if you see an enemy Van to the side or something, taking that ""free"" pot shot on the Knight might mean getting concaved by Zweis and Brandis, and that is a scenario in which not even DOOP will save you. MAA however is good at stopping stuff like a Vanguard trying to sneak around and backstab your entire team.  Another thing to worry about when fighting with your team is that some of them will inevitably feed your enemies unflinchable ripostes. Because of this, you can't be bloodthirsty and go for flinches in non-1v1s because the game doesn't work like that when the enemy might get an unflinchable overhead.  Learn how to play Knight/Vanguard. Sometimes, an extra Knight or Van is simply just worth more (e.g. Mason on sluice gate, approaching the dark forest ""tunnel of love"", etc.). However, a single MAA really does shine on places like Stoneshill or Dark Forest's last objective.  Broad/norse/HWS for overall. Flanged Mace for killing. Not sure how viable axes and Morning Star are on Mercs. Quarterstaff for Kendo."

ChivalryGame,39zxzc,sesstreets,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:54:49 2015 UTC,or if you just want to watch someone who is exceptional at dueling altogether.   Only some of his videos have commentary tho.
ChivalryGame,39zxzc,sesstreets,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:32:00 2015 UTC,"I don't mind showing you the maps to show you what I do or talking with you on steam or even dueling to show you some things. Add me. For some quick info here's my opinions:  MAA is the only class in this game that has a special ability that is almost  unnoticeable. The backpedal speed (holding S) and run speed. Here's a graph:  http://i.imgur.com/dK0KMOh.png  Notice that the red line (that's us) is sharper and takes less time to get to max speed (325) than any other class. This is your tool. Forget dodge exists for a little while and go duel for a few days completely without it only utilizing footwork and positioning and watch how better you get. The idea is to never engage in parry riposte chains unless you can outspeed someone or catch them by surprise. You want to be floating away from your opponent and able to get away from any attack they throw at you without having to parry. This means if a knight lmb messers you, you have to run and/or dodge to your back right, this means turning around, running away from the attack, then coming back for your own attack. This forces that knight to trade (bad for you, good for them usually) or have to cftp (good for you, since they waste stamina) or you get a hit (very good for you but keep the pressure and keep comboing if you can).   For team play? It comes down to knowing what your friendlies do in engagements. I notice, for instance, if omega has a halbard he goes slightly to the left of his opponent, knowing this, I'll circle to the right and stop the opponents movement options with my body or I will feint or miss attacks to get him to parry to let omega, or anyone else around, get the hit in plus obviously if I can land a hit I will. Spook likes to be the first one to hit so knowing this I'll actually rush right behind him up to the front line and when he gets that first hit in I'll go right or left around his back and parry the eventual converging attacks. There are times, vs other MAA's where you have to get on them and not let them bother your knights and vanguards. If I'm fighting massi I have to let my team know what happens in that duel and if I can get that pick and kill massi I can rush back to the objective uncontested and help friendlies.  There's plenty of joking about us being teleportation wizards and it's true. The nasty thing though? You can get people 'stuck' and unable to parry your attack. What I like doing is getting people to face to their right by rotating to your left around them, having them get into an animation where they are turncapped (parrying or attacking), then dodging right and attacking with a stab. This is usually a hit and it's powerful because of how almost guaranteed it is to work. Dodge out of parry is powerful but it's not almighty broken since, face it, you can't always tell where you are dodging and what might be there already when you get there (I'm dodging awa.... oh hello messer lmb spam).  I've gotten, 'decent' at feint reading recently and I must say punishing feints as an MAA is incredible because of how much damage you do and how fast you can go fight someone else. Feinting is VERY powerful as maa especially with the sword stab feints since they're so sneaky looking. Do remember though, you do not have unlimited stam in this game and you only get 5 dodges (20% each time) + feinting takes up about 60% of a missed swing + if you use a shield... it adds up. MAA that don't manage their stamina well don't play well it's that simple.  So, footwork and understanding the power of the run speed/backpedal, play more in house 3v3's 2v2's and see where each one of your friendlies goes and also talk about it with them, lrn2doge and doop better, understanding how much yellow juice your maa needs and using feints more often.  There's tons of other stuff and it took me a long time to get here as a top maa and I'm still improving. You can ALWAYS improve, never give up."

ChivalryGame,39xak8,evax01x,2,Mon Jun 15 15:39:25 2015 UTC,"Some quick tips that I'd like ever new person to know is to use alt+attack button half the time. Just press and hold the left alt key while swinging, stabbing or over heading. It's basically a left handed version of the attack. If you learn to use alt attacks you can more easily fool the enemy and land hits earlier if they happen to be on your left side.   Another, more advanced tip is dragging. For lmb (left mouse button) turn into or away from the direction of your sword. This allows you to manipulate how fast or slow it makes contact, which fools the enemy. For overheads try looking up at the sky while crouching and then overhead (mouse wheel down) this will make the attack slower. Alternatively you can kneel and face the ground when overheading which attacks very quickly. Lastly you can start a stab(mouse wheel down) in a direction away from the enemy but at the right moment, at the end of your stab animation, turn into the enemy and you'll surprise stab them.  With the right amount of practice all of this can be mastered It will become completely natural. During heart pumping one on one fights I utilize a big list of moves in my arsenal."

Sometimes it was funny just reading the dumb shit people said but now it's just annoying. plus, you can still use the console for chat if you really want to without that shit taking up the screen. There are 2 things that annoy me about this though:  1.) You have to disable the chat while it's NOT active - as in noone can have recently typed something or no server messages have gone. Otherwise when you disable you'll be stuck with the chat that was up at the time.  2.) By disabling chat you lose the little admin and server messages (not really necessary though)."

A few one-handers had thrust windups that were nigh instant. Certain other weapons were pretty useless, like double axe. Alt swings actually increased the apparent speed that you winded up, as half the animation was ambiguous/hidden. Feints were much less readable - the feint cooldown/recovery stuff made them readable with most weapons and attacks. TBS did make a lot of changes for the better in that patch and in others since then, but they made some really bad ones along the way too, like the bubble, parry in recovery, etc."

ChivalryGame,39v6pv,Hroslansky,2,Mon Jun 15 01:50:25 2015 UTC,Hi.  I wrote a guide to help with this.  Check it out on Steam and let me know if you have any specific questions.
ChivalryGame,39v6pv,Reithur,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:42:59 2015 UTC,"This is actually the guide I used to edit my config files. You linked the Wikipedia page in it, and I went through and made every adjustment recommended. Based on some of the things I've found online and through speaking with other players, it seems that the developers just haven't optimized this game for Macs yet. One person I spoke to said he can run the game in boot camp no problem, but when he launches the Mac version, he gets unplayable lag. I might just be stuck waiting for an update. :("
ChivalryGame,39v6pv,nightbringer57,1 point,Mon Jun 15 04:08:56 2015 UTC,"Check your friends' mac specs. He may have a true GPU, unlike you (I highly doubt you will ever be able to run chiv on your pc). The graphics drivers for mac OS are generally much weaker than the ones on PC, so this does not help, I guess..."

It's not a ping issue, which someone pointed out on a server today. He said I was lagging really bad even though my ping was hovering around 30-40. Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated."

You are very far away from having the ""adequate"" hardware to play you need a discreet gpu like a Nvidia or AMD (not sure what mobile cards they use with mac) and not an integrated gpu, the Intel gpu you have right now is not powerful enough to run it at full settings or 1080p resolution"

Don't worry tough, just make sure your having fun. Try to force yourself to play at least a whole match as a knight with the longsword, and play defensive as a knight, attempt to block everything that comes at you, at stab or overhead when you see someone who has let there guard down.

ChivalryGame,39s8lp,PsychoEliteNZ,2,Sun Jun 14 10:50:25 2015 UTC,"Quite a few kiwis join the AU servers, I don't think I've seen an NZ player with a ping lower than mid 70s on AU servers, but they're stable. I know NZ have their own servers up but not sure where they're hosted, I get about 130 ping to them though so probably over your side of the pond. * you risk getting kicked from the game with pings constantly over 100+  During the day it's not that populated, you can still get a game but maybe not the gametype you want. You'll usually get a few full servers from 4-5pm onwards in any mode though.   5pm here now, there are 2 full team objective servers, a full free for all and 2 well populated classic duels (They're labeled Free for all but they're 1v1) - NZ server looks emtpy though."

ChivalryGame,39q0li,BrianHorror,9,Sat Jun 13 17:29:55 2015 UTC,A lot of people here REALLY hate the game. Maybe he's looking to see what the disgruntled veterans of the game say after 2k hours in retrospect.

ChivalryGame,39q0li,Stubbstepp,17,Sat Jun 13 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"I honestly hated the game at first. Endlessly getting slaughtered by good players made me want to rage quit multiple times but I'm extremely glad I stuck with it. Now, as a rank 31, I play chivalry at just about any opportunity I get.  Don't get discouraged at first man. This game has an incredibly high skill ceiling and you will die..many many times. But if you stick with it you'll end up hopefully loving it, at least that was the case for me. A word of advice, stick to the new player servers at first until you get the hang of the basic mechanics.  Enjoy brother"
ChivalryGame,39q0li,Charles_K,1 point,Sat Jun 13 18:54:05 2015 UTC,"I'll have to admit, Chivalry was an acquired taste for me too. My brother actually liked it a lot more than I did at first. I actually read the tutorial and my brother and I would do feint + drag duels since level 0, so I was already better off than like a 1/3rd of the people right off the bat, so difficulty wasn't the reason I was slow to like this game. It's just, the movement and stuff is slow when you come from stuff like HL2DM and TF2 but you learn to appreciate the gritty melee in-your-face attitude of it all. That and the game can be funny as shit, and the horrific ragdoll contortions only help. I played it briefly to level 20, put it away for about 5 months, then played near non-stop for ~9 months."

It is also poorly balanced and poorly optimised, though despite it's many flaws it's a great game if you're looking to casually play and chop some heads off with some really cool looking weapons, but the longer you play it the more you realize that it isn't so much of a good game but somehow it's still fairly fun to play"
ChivalryGame,39q0li,Super_King85,2,Sun Jun 14 14:04:06 2015 UTC,"2.50 is less than the price of cup of coffee in some areas. Chivalry is definitely worth a cup of coffee, even if you only play for ten hours."

ChivalryGame,39q0li,gentlemandinosaur,1 point,Sat Jun 13 23:16:35 2015 UTC,"What is? Extended dragging? The game had dragging as a feature. People are just dragging backwards.   ROH is most likely one of the easiest things to parry there is. And half the time it leaves the person backwards. So, anyone that says it is a problem just hasn't learned to deal with it yet. Which they will with practice."
ChivalryGame,39q0li,Perpetualinvalidity,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:39:33 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't see the reverse overhead at all. Usually I'm walking up to the person and then they start up a swing, I parry at the normal time and then I'm dead. What happened? Oh, they dragged enough to twitch all over the place and delay the hit until my parry was done. Meh.  Edit: It's actually pretty much my fault for not practicing and playing enough. I get that. It's just rage inducing."

ChivalryGame,39rqwm,Mycomania,3,Sun Jun 14 23:16:27 2015 UTC,Wasn't Bigs caught aimbotting in a previous competition? Someone pls correct me if i'm wrong.  Just doesn't seem fair he was allowed to play is an a comp like this.  http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1gom47/bigs_archer_for_faucher_accused_of_aimbotting/
ChivalryGame,39rqwm,Mycomania,0,Sun Jun 14 03:57:14 2015 UTC,"Despite the fact that there were multiple accusations as to him ""aimbotting"",which arised from watching his twitch videos, which was done in the year of 2013,there was no concrete proof that he did. The people who originally made these accusations have reverted these said accusations after having a chat with Bigs and seeing him play instead of just watching his twitch videos. However, it is a common trend for certain community players to call him an aimbotter which could be due to the following reasons. A: They don't know much about the player who got accused of aimbotting and like jumping into the bandwagon because it may seem fun, be it sexually or emotionally. B: They are just not good as bigs and are considered to be called the popular term in gaming ""mad cuz bad""."
ChivalryGame,39rqwm,ParkRangerStan,5,Sun Jun 14 04:07:23 2015 UTC,"Idk, watching the clips he is awful twitchy. I get he's played lots of cs, so have I. It looks like he only uses it when arrow drop isn't really a factor. He aims at a group of enemies and friends and shakes and ""gets lucky"" every time. Most of the shots under 30 feet are ridiculous. He goes from leading way off to perfect shot in a spit second. If he's not actually cheating, he's setting some kind of world record. I don't buy it. I do think he was aimbotting in that event at least. Since I've only seen him a couple times outside that, I cant say about regular use."
ChivalryGame,39rqwm,J-P_,3,Sun Jun 14 04:15:50 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01DNQRrnGPc I originally uploaded this video in response to the ""twitch shot"" hackusations at the time. I wanted to show that there are other people that do twitch shots, in this case, myself."
ChivalryGame,39rqwm,faktorfaktor,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:28:02 2015 UTC,"I gotta say, I don't always twitch but when I do it's close range when there's no need to lead as much and I'm aiming for something like the head that is quite small and can move a lot real fast.  Not making any statements about whether he hacks or not. Nothing would surprise me though since one of the few archers in EU that I considered worth something had been using leaf hacks comparable to a wallhack. That with a most likely 60 fov toggle is a little discrediting."

ChivalryGame,39rqwm,MostToxicplayer,0,Mon Jun 15 09:25:44 2015 UTC,"Again, there was never any concrete proof that he was aimbotting.  Granted, he had and still does to this day get really good shots from time to time but which archer does not. This is why he is one of the top archers in this game. I think you may be over praising him. If you look at his videos, he also misses easy shots an awful lot, he is in no way, shape or form setting some kind of world record. Furthermore, if you get to know Bigs,you will realize that he does not possess the intellectual capability to aquire hacks like aimbotting. Moreover, although this might not be directly related to bigs but no one in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare history has been caught with aimbotting. Like it or not, he was not aimbotting during that tourney nor in any tourney before or after that."

Typically games don't use that method and the ones that do don't usually have rank restrictions on servers which seems to be the main issue that you can't play with your friend without him dieing constantly (although we had to learn that way with no low rank servers).

ChivalryGame,39p0qg,Samzerks,11,Sat Jun 13 10:49:23 2015 UTC,"The whole reason lower ranks get killed so easily and don't know how to kill higher level ranks is because from day one they join a server full of noobs who don't know how to play the game and learn bad habits.   Also, since so many people are in low rank servers the regular servers are over saturated with higher ranked players.  If there weren't any lower ranked servers then you would have most servers filled with people around your rank rather than all 30 plus, and this is exactly what happens on free weekends or sales. So many new people join that the low rank servers are full and then the excess players spill into the regular servers and you end up with teams of 10 players all under rank 25 and four players above rank 35.   Chivalry used to not have low rank servers and everything was fine. No one ever complained because the servers weren't saturated with higher skilled players since there were no servers splitting the community at the time.  If I were you, I would ask to remove the low rank servers instead of basically keeping all the same skilled level 15 and under players in the same group that they have been playing with to keep playing with the same bad habits and never improving or learning how much more there is to the game."
ChivalryGame,39p0qg,ia_Flame,5,Sat Jun 13 13:13:31 2015 UTC,Further dividing an already divided community has got to be the worst idea.

Maybe if people actually TRIED to play the game how it was meant to be played rather than just spamming lmb at EVERY chance they can then they wouldn't get so frustrated when it clearly doesn't work unless they're in a group of their own team.
ChivalryGame,39p0qg,cutecatgirl,6,Sat Jun 13 13:11:19 2015 UTC,"IMO, dividing players into skill groups defeats the whole idea of competitive gaming. Why are you playing CMW if not to fight? If you don't have a competitive spirit, I don't think you'll enjoy Chiv much. The reason I like this game is because I enjoy the test of my capabilites and the reward of the feeling of self-confidence that comes with success.  I understand that it's frustrating and boring to get killed repeatedly, but there are always going to be players who are better than you. I'm rank 63, with 250,000+ kills, and there are still many people with much less experience who make me feel clumsy, slow, and stupid.  If you want to enjoy CMW then practice. Yes, you're going to get killed by better players(or more often by worse players with better advantages), but that's what it's all about - improving until you're the better player.  TL;DR: yes, git gud"
ChivalryGame,39p0qg,TobiwanK3nobi,2,Sat Jun 13 11:57:53 2015 UTC,"It's not even a matter of 'git gud' - that'll come with time.   Just accept there's players you won't be able to beat 1 on 1 at the moment, work with your team to bring them down until you reach the stage where you can hold your own.   As others have said, adding more tiers will just divide the community further, and move the problem from level 16 to level 26. The best way to learn in this game is to get your shit absolutely wrecked by someone better than you, and try and learn why. It takes time, and it can be frustrating, but if you stick it out you'll get there.  Another good thing could be to jump on Classic Duels and see if anyone is willing to help. There's a lot of toxic people in this community, but there's also a lot of people willing to lend a hand."

ChivalryGame,39j7ap,NerdStarkz,5,Fri Jun 12 02:30:33 2015 UTC,"1.)   There is no necessary rank for starting up a clan, though depending on what you want your clan to be it will definitely require a set of skills that if you don't have will be incredibly difficult to create a clan. If you plan on being the leader of a competitive clan, you will 100% need to be able to be seen as a leader, You need to have a personality that not only people enjoy being around, but people enjoy listening to. It's also very recommended that you have competitive experience but if you don't, don't expect people with competitive experience to want to join your clan.   2.)   Not necessarily, but it would indeed be very hard to start up a clan without a group of people you know would be guarenteed to be in and stay in.   3.)    Yes and no. There are several difficulties in creating a clan that WILL arise and there will be a lot of stress behind creating a clan, if you pull it off it will probably relieve a lot of stress and feel pretty rewarding, but maintaining that clan after it's created is also very difficult, if you don't mind a bit of hardship then by all means yes, but it can very well push you to the edge if you aren't prepared for it. There's also the fact that if you recruit players that aren't very liked in the competitive scene, you will probably notice a reputation drop on your end and creating a clan may very well lead to people liking you as a person a lot less. In most cases that would probably lead to it not being worth it to making it, but in the end, it's your decision.   4.)   There's never any guarantee that it will be successful even if you put all of your free time and effort into it, and if you can't spend at least 4 hours a day every day into the creation of a clan without a guaranteed group of people you'd know would join, I doubt it would work. Though if you have a passion for this game and creating a clan I implore you to try.   5.)   Clans are built from a group of individual players, though there's no real reason to be toxic to a newer clan, some people are just toxic in their own right, though this doesn't necessarily represent the clan as a whole. If someone from an older clan is toxic to you the best plan of action would be to just ignore it and accept the chiv scene for what it is and scrim them regardless for much needed practice/scrim time, Also, the term ""toxic"" is a very subjective one; Someone you consider ""toxic"" may not consider themselves so in the least."

ChivalryGame,39j7ap,bi11y10,3,Fri Jun 12 03:57:23 2015 UTC,shit was hard man
ChivalryGame,39j7ap,Koiuki,3,Fri Jun 12 04:54:29 2015 UTC,"Starting a clan is hard shit man. Trying to get people to join is really tough to do. Usually, you will be grabbing noobs from pubs and having to train them up, unless you are very competitively experienced and have a lot of connections, you might be able to grab players. But most of it, atleast for me was openly recruiting newer players who are relatively inexperienced in competitive. It's tough to get anybody good because clans have such a high failure rate and usually die after a slow death as your clanmates leaves to join other teams. Even when you have a team, it gets even worse. You are going to lose. Alot. As a leader you have to show that you are in control and keeping the clan in good spirits and improve as well. This is alot harder than you think with such a huge negativity following the game and especially the competitive scene.  It gets really stressful as well. I have talked to other leaders in different clans, and the ability to stay positive and keep moving on is very tough and might take you to the breaking point. Every single lost engagment and game will fall completely on you as your fault, and you will feel it. I personally felt at the start of Meta that we were not doing well because of me and this made me hate playing the game and exerting a lot of force trying really hard, attempting to stay positive throughout the whole losing streaks and big salt. It's almost impossible to stay so positive as a leader through all of the losses and bullshit. You'll probably start hating the game like I did, and steal candy from children and your skin will turn very pale and become a vampire. But you must still keep the team together, and try to get better.   If your clan is still alive and active after a few months, you will find that you guys will inevitably have gotten better, and you might feel less pressure on your back to prove yourself. Once you prove yourself to be a little more successful and not downright awful, you might find some new, bigger fish trying to get into your team and your recruits will hopefully see some more improvement. From then on, you become a more serious contender as you attempt to get yourself up there with the best of the teams. It becomes easier at this point once you get your team established, yet your expectations will only rise.   Just try to enjoy the game OP, and maybe try to join a clan before you start one for yourself. Best of luck you and I hope that my anecdote and warnings will help guide you through this game."

Also, be sure to find a core group of players that are dedicated to your cause. What generally happens with new clans, is there are 1 or 2 standouts in the clan that eventually leave to join a well established clan. So be sure to set a good tone early on, to get people dedicated to YOUR clan."

If you aren't up there, you aren't likely to do very well against them  2) I don't know about other areas, but in North America it is not dead at all.   3) sure why not? What do you mean by ""worth it""?  Don't know expect to win all of chivalry right away but if you have fun then it's worth it right? You have nothing to lose.   If you want, you could also just join an existing clan instead.   4)  a lot of time and effort.    5) from what I've seen, no.   But I'm not a big part of the comp scene so I don't see everything"

A lot of clan people are pretty nice (see point 5), and I'm sure one or two might be willing to let you hang out for a practice or scrim to see what it's like.   5)  Most of the existing clans are pretty friendly as long as you don't show up and act like a dick.  Just be mature and have fun and there won't be any issues!"

ChivalryGame,39j7ap,Dennis_Smoore,1 point,Fri Jun 12 07:57:24 2015 UTC,I joined a startup clan at first and you have to have a strong personality and push people to be on/active. The players we had were REALLY skilled in duels but no one communicated and we inevitability failed and bombed hard at the few scrims we were apart of. Then it just kind of silently disbanded.  After now joining a clan with some structure I see a huge difference and it's way more enjoyable. The key is having one or two guys that will enforce rules and keep things active.

ChivalryGame,39h7we,YourMoneyOrYourLife,10,Thu Jun 11 18:19:10 2015 UTC,"Legion - Logo  Captains: Height, Chrisomatic  Charity: Project Healthy Children  Interview with Chrisomatic -   Unborn - Can you give a brief history of your team?  Chris - Absolutely. Legion is an older clan. It was started during Beta before Chivalry was officially released. We've been actively playing Chivalry since.  U -  Legion seems to have a history of falling in and out of relevance as a team by a variety of factors. How do you think you guys stand as of right now?  C - Currently, we're probably more toward the side of ""out of relevance"" as you put it. Since we're so old, many of our members lose interest in Chivalry for a time, and then come back. So, our participation in competitive Chivalry is very dependent on our member interest and availability and inspiration. Sometimes we get inspired to play and start having fun with Chivalry again, and we practice and try to compete. That's when we become relevant again.  U -  Can you describe the charity you have chosen and your reasons for picking it?  C - We chose Project Healthy Children. It's a good organization, and food is important. Height probably has some more knowledge on it, but he's away atm ha.  U - No problem, haha. You have some really tough teams to face coming up on Saturday’s tourney, what do you think you need to do to overtake them? Any prep work already undergone?  C -  Good question. Many of our members really want to see Lg become the best. It's been a struggle, since we haven't had consistent members, and we don't recruit very often. In order to compete against the best clans in the game, we need to practice consistently with a consistent group of our members. We've been scrimming here and there, and doing 2v2s and 3v3s when we can. It's been a little tough since Height is taking a break, and Hanzo was on vacation for a week. But we're gonna try to practice from here until the tourny and do our best . U - It's hard not to root for you guys a little after knowing ya for so long. Best of luck to you in the tourney from myself. You guys have any secret pocket strats tucked away ?  C - We've been talking about strats for the typical maps. Some things we've tried have been working very well. Strategys are always useful, but they hardly mean anything if we can't win the battles. So, we're gonna focus on playing as a team more than anything else. And thanks, I appreciate it man. Also, here's a summary from our Charity if you wanted to add that too:  Project Healthy Children (PHC) sends experts to low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa to hasten and increase the quality of mandatory micronutrient forti?cation of staple foods such as flour, cooking oil, wheat, and sugar. These programs reduce adverse health outcomes, especially in children and pregnant mothers, which are due to insufficient intake of iron, vitamins A and B9, iodine, and zinc.  U -  No problem Chris. What made you interested in both chivalry and competitive chivalry?  C - First-person sword fighting is simply awesome. And there was no game that did it like Chivalry did. It was a lot of fun, and I almost got burnt out until I joined Legion. If you aren't playing the game in a clan, it's really difficult to get the ""team"" aspect of the game. People just play for themselves in public games. So, the ""team"" aspect made the game way more engaging, and I kept playing.  U -Thanks again for your time Chris! Anything else you want to share?  C - Not much else. We're just excited for the tournament, and we wish everyone good luck! :)    Fight Club - Logo  Captains: Chicken, Gary.  Charity - Partnership for Drug-Free Kids  Interview with Chicken -  Unborn - Give a brief history of your team  Chicken - In september 2013 we were formed. A bunch of pub stars that played on the Same server. A couple of us formed the clan and tried out chivalry. We've been in about 10 tournaments and we've only got second in one.(the chivitational). We have a grown into a huge community with over 150 people.  U - What made you interested in both chivalry and competitive chivalry?  C - I first heard the game from one of my friends. Being a history nerd and enjoying FPS games I immediately got into it. Stomping in pubs as a rank 30 made me feel like I should form a clan. Since at the time there was NN LG Tempest etc, making a big show. I love the game my team loves the game and that's the only way to keep it challenging after so many hours.  U - Please describe the charity you have chosen and your reasons for picking it  C - We have Chosen Drug Free Kids. We are kind of known as a more laid back clan and, of course we like to have fun.This charity is serious to us, we have had a member go to rehab and get clean. Some people in the clan have experienced addiction and the effects it can have on family life growing up and all. So we want to give back to the kids dealing with addiction and poverty.  U - Really great reason. Moving back to the tournament, you’re a bit of an underdog for taking first in the upcoming tourney with some upper tier teams playing. What are your expectations and what do you think you need to do to cause some upsets?  C - Well I have a couple of new positions on our A team. It will be their first Tournament so i'm excited and they are too. We've shown that we can upset teams in the upper tier bracket. I do want to win; utilizing my knights, let the bow fly and, use that great FC clutch factor we're known, we can pull off an upset or two. We're really just glad to be apart of this tournament. Win or lose.  U - Hopefully I get to cast a few of your games and see umm in action. Have you done any prep work specifically for this tourney?  C - yes we have. We have been running LTS like it's going out of style. Scrimming once every night for the past 2 weeks. Most nights we scrim more. We might have the experience level for this tournament at the moment. Yet I believe it will be good to learn and fun to play.  might not have  U - It is a TO tourney, you know q:  C - yeah. LTS for engagements  U - Fair enough, hopefully it pays off for ya. Thanks for your time Chicken, and best of luck to you! Any last things you want to share?  C - Thanks unborn. Just shout out to all the Tournament staff and keeping things alive! Even more helping out the community. People say our community is toxic then things like this happen. I just smile and keep playing chivalry!  We accidentally interviews 2 FC members  Interview with FC Orphan -   Will - Give a brief history of your team  Orphan - FC started as a community based around our server. Several of the members wanted to do comp, so they started the offical Fight Club Competitive team. We are one of the oldest standing teams too. I joined about 8 months ago, and Fight Club has been around since the beginning of Chivalry. Almost everyone in NA knows about FC, and we have, imho, one of the best servers that chivalry has to offer. On the Comp side, we host our own yearly Tournament, and particapate in all avaliable Tournies.  W - What made you interested in both chivalry and competitive chivalry?  O - I've always been intereseted in competitive gaming, and playing chivalry on a team is just an extension of me playing all games with a competitive nature. When I started playing Chivalry, I bought it on a whim because it was on sale and I remember seeing it mentioned on Reddit somewhere. And I sucked, like, I played 150 hours while sucking at the game, and was completely ok with it. Then I started hanging around FC in my mid level 20s, and joined the group before I hit 30. Playing with all the higher level players that frequent FC forced me to play better, and after actually starting to get better, I wanted to keep getting better, so I through on the FC comp tags and started practicing and scriming. And look at me now, I'm best Orphan NA. And, when Chiv 2 eSport's scene blows up, I'll make hella cash from it. /s  W - Please describe the charity you have chosen and your reasons for picking it  O - We chose 'Kids against Drugs' IDK why, Chicken picked it. Kids, don't do drugs.  W - What are your expectations and what do you think you need to do to grab some wins.  O - Honestly, it all depends on the brackets. FC has great potential, and we do pull shit out of our ass sometimes. Like 2nd place in the last Tournie. If that is any indicator of the next one, we should be golden. If our A team is on, and we are playing like we should, we can beat most anyone. To grab some wins this go round, we have to win our team fights and 2vs1's, which we have been practicing on a lot. Our defense has gotten a lot better, as you know WIll, we held y'all on the first objective on dark forest, but we still need work on specific objectives on attacking. My expectation for this Tournie, some clan who hasn't played in forever is gonna win it all, Tempest and Phoenix get knocked out 1st round, FC takes second. Probs Fourth Legion    Continued"

Give a brief history of your team  Guts -  in January I was leader of the Lateknights and slowly my guys started to leave.  I met Rekwan the current leader of Hell-ish in duels  and he having prior leading experience.  asked if he would make a clan. I transferred what guys remained from lateknights to hell-ish. and we recruited many more, I am currently Lord of Hell-ish.  I help Rekwan organize scrims and pubs. and as of February Hell-ish was born. With comps in mind. I kept many friends from LK that were from other clans,and helped us into the comp scene. Made many friends and lost some guys into other clans. We hold no i'll will, we are a clan of honor and we don't like to smack talk as one of our principles nor be a poor sport.  U - Thanks for sharing. It's also pleasant to here the principle of avoiding smack talk and the like  G - I have always enjoyed chivalry, how ever I never enjoyed taking many leader ship roles, I was always good in LTS servers, how ever at the time I was untrained, and Flippy and Dredd helped train me to do Drags. And from their my Comp urge increased. I was a prior Competitive Halo player, with the LateKnights, however most of the group left minus 2, but they were casuals. I started playing Chivalry and started to grow the clan there. Eventually it became hard being the only leader with little experience in chivalry comp, I joined a fellow dueler whom I have learned from the most. Our 2 styles of fighting counter and compliment each other in the battlefield. I missed the comp feeling I got in halo, and I plan to carry this on to the slasher project or chivalry sequel.  U - Can you please describe the charity you have chosen and your reasons for picking it?  G - Robinhood, one of our members actually picked when we were all up in the air for the decision, however due to his own personal reasons picked the National association of the Deaf. He chose them because he has a sister that is deaf and she goes through difficulties in everyday life. I couldn't imagine myself being deaf, nor having a sister be deaf. Out of respect for Robinhoods sister we decided on this charity.  U - You’re a bit of an underdog for taking first in the upcoming tourney. What are your expectations and what do you think you need to do to cause some upsets to get to those higher rankings?  G -  Its true, and I'm sure many have their doubts, I have faith in my brethren to at least put a good show for all. We will definately give them their moneys worth. As of last week, we learned we had the potential to beat some of these clans. Had it been March, I would not have signed us up. But after fighting with some of the other clans this last week, I have grown confident we can surprise the many who see us as the underdogs. I expect us to leave the impression we may not be an older clan, but we know what we are doing and that we belong with the best. I know we can best it, I have dedicated several hours into making tactical vids for my clan to watch. And as long as they stick by it and change it as it comes. I think we have the chance to over come. U - I personally haven’t been able to see you guys scrim for awhile, so hopefully I get to go through some of your games this Saturday. Anything else you want to share?  G - Good luck to all the team, I hope to see as many of them in the ""potential"" Summer Marathon league after this. We have been kind of keeping our scrims secret. We don't want to show the good stuff yet. :) we are much better than we were in the Chivitationals tournament, so I hope to impress. :) I have much faith in our leader Rekwan and our fighters competing!

Syndicate ╬ - Logo  Captains: Zebra, Stan, Excalibur, Poppy, Fart  Charity: Gambler's Anonymous  Interview with Zebra -   Unborn - Can you Give a brief history of your team?  Zebra - well basically, Excal founded Valor back sometime last Fall, they moved through a tourney or two I believe, then around January, Excal had to take a break for work related reasons, and with the new pickups and changes in leadership, we evolved into Syndicate around January, and we've been active in every tourney since. we've had a lot of active leaders who shaped the way for us a group to be where we are, and we're looking to maintain and even rise above the 3rd place spot we achieved last tourney  U - What made you interested in both chivalry and competitive chivalry?  Z -  well I've been playing chiv since about January of 2012, what initially got me interest was the concept of the combat, there was and still is no game like chivalry that involves the depth of combat that's found in  this game. what got me into competitive involved the inquiries of Soul Striker, founder of Dark Ambitions, and Flippy, a former active member of Tempest, on my interest in joining the scene, which I joined into maybe a year and a half ago, I wanted to see what I was worth in this whole ""competitive scene""  U - Christ, those are some old names. Alright, can you Please describe the charity you have chosen and your reasons for picking it?  Z - we actually haven't decided completely on a charity sponsor for the group, voting is in progress on suggestions, and we should have a decision by tonight  U - You have some really tough teams to face coming up on Saturday’s tourney, what do you think you need to do to overtake them? Any prep work already undergone?  Z - I really think as a team concerning our main lineup it's all about making sure our organization and positioning is up to par so we can dominate in pure melee engagements, just because we're lacking when it comes to higher tiered archers considering the fact that T has anstii and skillz, and Px has bigs and dark, we have a pretty flexible lineup so I'm not too overly concerned. As a whole it's been tough to keep the game alive for us as a group but we've had a wakeup call as a team to just play the game and have fun above all else, I'm just happy to be able to scrim regularly and have fun with the guys I love playing the game with, that comes first for me. As far as prep work goes, being more active as a group is good for me, it's really all about execution and situational awareness, being able to adapt for us. and that's what we've been working on as a team.  U - So you guys have at least a few edges that other teams may not. Best of luck to you in the tourney Zebra. Anything else you want to share?  Z -  thanks man, actually I do, all this speculation last night during our scrim with Tempest, apparently they suspected 3 of us (including me) of hacking. and I just want to go outright and say that we as a clan don't condone that neither have we done it, and it kinda upsets me that it seems like everytime Tempest sees a player they don't like or doesn't match the standards they expect, they accuse. I stand by the other two players and by myself (as I know our whole clan does) that we completely deny those accusations. whether it be simply suspect or outright  U - There's always some drama in chiv, I'm sure you guys are fine and it wont come up again in the tourney. Hopefully anyways.  Z - should anything come up, I just wanted to make it public, hopefully it shouldn't yes :) and we as leaders will take responsibility for our group is something I wanted to make known as well.  thanks man, I appreciate that  U - You guys certainly dont have a history of anything like that. Once more, thanks for your time Zebra! Good luck on Saturday    Fourth Legion - Logo  Captain: Cranberry  Charity Sponsor: Fred Hollows Foundation  Interview with Cranberry -   Unborn - Can you give a short overview of your team?  Cranberry - Fourth Legion was formed by a handful of Invictus members unhappy with the way Kingslayer lead his clan (or rather didn't, I was the co leader and set up everything).   U- What made you interested in chiv and comp chiv?  C - My interest in chivalry came from my interest in HEMA and the medieval period in general. I got in to competitive becuase I was in a tf2 highlander and csgo comp team before, and I figured I'd cary that over to chiv.   U - What charity did you choose and why?  C- I selected the Fred Hollows foundation mainly becuase I have a blind cousin, so picking a charity that helps prevent avoidable blindess seamed like the right thing to do.  U - You're an underdog for the tourney. What are your expectations for it?  C - I know we are an underdog, and I honestly dont expect us to even get in 4th place let alone win it. I entered us in this tourny mainly to have fun and improve. Though, my A team has changed since(for the better) the last tourney, so there is a chance we could win a round or two  U - Thanks for you time! Best of luck    Again, expect new announcements for brackets and more soon!"

ChivalryGame,39h7we,Chicken713,5,Thu Jun 11 19:13:10 2015 UTC,"A message for whoever sees themself as an underdog.  Don't forget your goals in this tournament. The primary things to focus on are LEARNING and executing what has been true to you in the past. You are going to learn to deal with tournament jitters. It will be discouraging to lose that first engagement. People will fuck up and TK. That's OK.  Always play your heart out, don't ever be let down or give up. Take a second to sit back, breathe, and wait for the team before engaging in a fight. Take risks against the ""better"" teams. Play smart and safe and go with what is tried and true against others.  Even if you get DNF'd first objective, DNF those fuckers back. Show them that their DNF only happened because TO maps are as balanced as the Tower of Pisa.  Don't eagerly run into facehug range of that Knight being 1v3'd, he may just riposte onto you. Don't relent on feints, but be absolutely ready to parry any caveman gambles or read punishments if you feint. Work around your teammates. TALK. TALK. TALK. SAY OUT LOUD if you are switching, disengaging, initiating, assisting.  Forget about the ""favored"" factor of a team. If you played the best your team could, you will achieve the best possible result. If your enemy fucks up and you don't, you get a convincing upset and a valuable confidence booster.  That February tournament... Nemesis was poised for third place, possibly even second or first (we were actually quite confident to face a rusty Faucheur, not so much Tempest but still saw it as a possibility). Yet, this was a pubic hair away from Nemesis getting eliminated in the very first round by an ""underdog"" team: Genesis.  Nem dnf'd Genesis on the first obj of darkforest at 37%. Gen said FUCK THAT. Gen kept their cool, brought their A+ defense game, and held the goddamn line. The clock neared 0, and only with some exceptionally clutch last-minute engagementa was Nem able to tug the cart that much more. 37%. I think this was the first ever tiebreaker in Chiv comp history.  And a valiant fight they put up. Gen had an insane amount of momentum while Nem's will was nearly broken. Gen managed to amass about 4 rounds or so before Nemesis was able to finally pull through and win.  FC overcame some huge odds and secured wins over about 3 or so ""favored"" teams. Go for broke man.  Learn to get over tourney jitters. Learn how to play under stress. Learn how to execute what you have been practicing when it really matters. And learn how to still have fun. Tourneys are fun."

Come on.   known hacker   I completely thought ninja was a hacker back when it happened in that tournament. The videos got me, but then I realized it was clearly people cherrypicking wizardish desyncing and stuff. The entire crowd was against him (which makes sense, he did some mean things and was a dick) so of course everyone was completely for accusing him of hacking. He hasn't been VACbanned, so until you can pull footage of an entire match of his being sketchy, there's no knowing whether he hacked/hacks or not."
ChivalryGame,39ipms,Fiesty43,3,Fri Jun 12 02:02:51 2015 UTC,"Feisty, you used to call him a hacker.  There is evidence. I can't really say much more without repeating myself."

Sure, he was a troll and an assfuck, but that is still no excuse to call him out on something that hasn't been proven. And I regret having done that."
ChivalryGame,39ipms,Fiesty43,-4,Fri Jun 12 02:21:43 2015 UTC,"Ya, I mean, you could collect footage of any player and just collect a bunch of desync footage and accuse them of hacking and it would look convincing."

I asked what programs? Can you link me?(Of course they couldn't)   absolutely terrible argument, theres lots of hex editors outside of cheatengine and pretty much anyone with basic programming knowledge could make a vac undetected speedhack with the udk sdk in a day lol. VAC only is effective on specific games. literally everything in this game is clientside so you could hack pretty much anything and get away with it unnoticed if you wished so, this is why the game is a joke for comp play   Name one player that was truly confirmed as a hacker that DID NOT end up with a VAC on their steam account.   oh boy."

ChivalryGame,39ipms,Koiuki,-1,Tue Jun 23 21:20:29 2015 UTC,"If you have a CS background then I don't know how you're disagreeing. Since you don't care, but still post for some reason...care to elaborate? As far as the hex editing goes, oh boy is right. Cool stuff man. Idgaf about the drama either, I'm just making it clear about why Ninja WILL be allowed back in the community because what was said in the Tempest TS just nullified any ""PROOF"" they had."
ChivalryGame,39ipms,CRUSHED1337,8,Fri Jun 12 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"If you have a CS background then I don't know how you're disagreeing.   If you don't want to get immediately VAC'd in CS, you basically have to make your own cheat or buy a really small, private one.  Now in wizardish's defense, since he's like 12 or whatever, I doubt he made his own or got someone to make one just for him. But I kind of doubt it's hard to find a good one for Chivalry anyways, VAC is pretty awful for anything that isn't a Source title, yeah it's caught a few people on alts and shit but they were probably using some really old public Google page 1 shit anyways."

I know most the players on Chiv are riding that tempest train, but you...you have it REALLY good; Tempest rides on YOU! Doesn't get any better than that right? Top cool kid in the scene. Anyways, back to the subject. Do YOU have any evidence to support comp scene Tempest ban given to Ninjapigs? If not, what are you talking about."
ChivalryGame,39ipms,Charles_K,10,Fri Jun 12 01:41:54 2015 UTC,"Why does ninja have like 15 accounts, all private? Why does he have VAC bans? Why did he admit to hacking in a private message? Why do videos show him pulling off bullshit attacks? Why is he always so sketchy? And most important of them all, he's 14. Nuff Salad, I rest my case."
ChivalryGame,39ipms,ia_Flame,-2,Fri Jun 12 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"I don't have 15 accounts, the accounts I do own only 1 or 2 of them are private, I was never VAC banned, I never admitted to hacking.

I thought people wre joking that I was really good or something, so I just went along until I realized they were really accusing me of hacking. If I did say a message like that, can you show me?"

If you seriously expect me to save this shit from months ago, you're being ridiculous as I thought this would never come up again, but there is a reason everyone dislikes you and is against you. Lots of people have seen this stuff. Then don't get me started on your video you posted showing proof that you don't hack of your desktop, that was hilarious."

ChivalryGame,39ipms,PreparetobePlaned,0,Fri Jun 12 02:18:13 2015 UTC,"Flame, you know I love you too man, but look;   15 accounts, all private   Link me to at least 4. He only had a few.   Why does he have VAC bans?   He has no VAC bans.   Why did he admit to hacking in a private message?   I saw the message too, it was with Spook. He was trolling, as usual. He might be young, but I don't think anyone is dumb enough to honestly admit to hacking. It was a joke.   Why do videos show him pulling off bullshit attacks?   Cherry-picked desyncs from one match, because no one liked him and all of Tempest (and a lot of other clans) wanted him gone.   Why is he always so sketchy?   I don't know if he hacks/hacked, but he could easily just be good. He's not a bad player, he knows how to break animations.   he's 14.   Yes, because all young people hack and are trolls, cause they're young and all.  I don't wanna lose any friends over this. I am just saying, we don't know anything."
ChivalryGame,39ipms,Chuckdatass,7,Fri Jun 12 02:09:08 2015 UTC,"For the last time, I never gave a shit about any of this, I don't keep tabs on people and add all alternate and real accounts I meet. I don't save their profile pages to my bookmarks.  Who would admit to hacking in a private message? Someone who is upset that people were fed up with him and brushed him away would seeing as they have nothing more to lose. Who would want to eventually get back in comp? The same person. How would he discredit his previous claim? ""I was trolling duh, lol...""  It isn't just cherry picked desyncs, it is first hand experience from a variety of players who know the game and have poured thousands of hours into it. Sure, there is gambling, feint spamming, reverse over heads. But when people duel the person with the same weapon and same ping or lower and get flinched every single time regardless of attacking first, that raises suspicion which reinforces video evidence.  Back to the accounts, why have those alternates? Why waste money or spend so much time on family shared accounts if you have nothing to hide? Why handle the situation by constantly trolling people and being sketchy and elusive and under the radar? If you wanted to come back to competitive, all he would have to do is just be completely open. Instead he chose a path of actions that only buried him deeper.  As for VAC bans, all I can say is I have seen stuff, I can't reproduce it. It was a long time ago.  As for the 14 year old comment, it was mainly a joke but there usually is a tendency for teens to be pretty trolly and egotistical. So hacking an easy to hack game to make you look great to boost that nature isn't all too far off.  Finally, I really don't care. What I have posted is basically a culmination of a variety of people's thoughts and observations on the matter from opinions and pieces of evidence mostly everyone has seen a while ago. The end result is the same, hacker or not, no one trusts Ninja. He was a douche and reacted improperly and kept it up. He has to live with the reputation he gave himself. This is probably why he has multiple accounts, to hide from the publicity of it all, but again, if he had nothing to hide or be ashamed of then he shouldn't feel the need to act so elusive.    This is merely my train of thought, as stated, I'm not going on a witch hunt for evidence and testimonies from 6 months ago"

ChivalryGame,39ipms,curlycued_ninja,4,Fri Jun 12 17:53:16 2015 UTC,"To me, it seems that a case for ban was made through a combination of fairly good evidence of game manipulation (explicit) and Wizardish being a complete cunt/poor ambassador for Chiv (implicit/unstated). No one has brought evidence against your current players such as parry spam videos (direct) or shady account practices (circumstantial), so why act so attacked? Be the bigger sportsman by taking the compliment that you must be hacking to beat T and move on without whining."

I should note that I did not pay for this product but the opinion I express here is my own. This product is much better than the original Autoblow. I found the original impossible to clean, and it broke easily. The sleeve on the new Autoblow makes cleaning very easy and they are not kidding when they say that this thing is built to last for 500 hours. You can really feel the quality when you hold it. The most important part - the feeling - I would give an A-. I don't know if its because of my size (I'm on the smaller side) or not, but I felt it could have given me a tighter grip. I was still able to reach orgasm in about 10 minutes so I'm not complaining too much but I would like to see the product have the ability to get tighter in the future if the user wants.

ChivalryGame,39c5q8,Jonks,7,Wed Jun 10 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"Thread hijack incoming.      Instead of putting limits on how many people can play a class, they should balance the class.  When you have to limit the numbers of a class, something is wrong.     Suggestions:   1) Missed shots with archer should result in stamina loss, just like melee classes.    2) Slight wobble when aiming ranged weapons, when aiming press a key to steady aim, this uses stamina.  Maybe this would not be the case with javs and only apply to xbows and bows.      The point is, if an archer is getting 4 or 5 free shots on a class before having to engage them in melee, there should be some kind of penalty for that.  An archer should not be able to get 1 or 2 hits in, turning the situation into a 1 or 2 hit to kill engagement AND also get full health and full stamina to start the fight.    Maul damage at range is a huge advantage, there should be some kind of penalty for having that ability.      tl;dr - let people play what they want; balance the class; stamina usage for using ranged weapons."

I think most choose it because they want to hide out on the sideline taking pot shots instead of getting repeatedly killed in the direct, in your face confrontation of melee. Basically it's a less stressful way to try to get kills or in other words, they're a bunch of pussies."
ChivalryGame,39c5q8,Tigers_,2,Wed Jun 10 23:24:48 2015 UTC,This.  Which is hilarious because archers are made to be aggressive as anyone else.

ChivalryGame,39c5q8,Tigers_,3,Sat Jun 13 01:35:21 2015 UTC,"Most people who play archer don't have the ability to fuck you up at a long distance and probably never will. Even the screenshot shows the majority of these people below 1.0 kdr. I think the fact that archers are the squishiest, along with other archer weaknesses, are plenty balancing. I think this is less of a problem than you're making it out to be.  HOWEVER - I'm not totally against your suggestions necessarily. Would be interesting to see it tried, depending on other balancing fixes. If you propose to institute those suggestions without giving the archers some other stuff (like, iunno, better flinching like before?), then I'm not okay with it."

Clobbered his soft archer head.  It was lovely.  Little did I know, ""Green Arrow"" was an admin, and after I felled him like a rotten tree, he logged in as administrator.  Long story short, he declared that I was a speedhacker and kicked me.  After reading about a similar experience from another user, I'm starting to think this is probably a regular thing.  This reflects poorly on the community.  Hopefully people will just learn to avoid the place, but every time something like free weekend happens there are going to be new players who aren't aware and will walk away thinking, ""Wow, this game is cool, but the people who run the servers are assholes, I don't wanna play this game!""  So is there any way we can get in touch with Torn Banner or whoever it is that hosts this toxic server to get it taken offline?

ChivalryGame,39ckr5,LumaPuma,2,Wed Jun 10 21:18:48 2015 UTC,"Are you able to see any servers normally? Make sure your filters are set accordingly. You could just make them to allow any ping, any game mode etc. then check the friends tab if they are in a game. Or you can type the name of the server in your filters then search in the regular servers. Make sure you're in online mode (which you probably are since you can see your friends' games)"
ChivalryGame,39ckr5,CoasterMan,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:20:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Yes I am able to see some servers, and my filters are set to show all available servers(any ping, any # of players, etc). My friends tab consistently won't show any of my friends in game, despite them confirming that they are in game and have been for a while. Tomorrow I will try searching by name(I feel kind of stupid for not trying it before but I tried via IP) but I'm a little pessimistic about it because I tried to find their server in the browser by sorting it by # of players in the server(3 people) and their server wasn't even showing up in my browser. We all updated the game today too so it isn't that we're running different versions. Again, thanks for your help."

HELPMEIMGONADIE's link shows it's peaking every night at roughly 1500 more players than before-the-fest-nights.

ChivalryGame,396t8k,slappymcnutface,2,Tue Jun 9 18:27:10 2015 UTC,"130 is nauseating? I know that FOV ingame is completely personal preference. But, assuming you are a human, you have an fov of ~180 degrees. I find it hard to believe 130 is nauseating."
ChivalryGame,396t8k,sesstreets,3,Tue Jun 9 18:30:18 2015 UTC,"The problem with it is that humans very well nearly have 180 degree vision, however you're usually looking at a computer screen that takes up maybe a third amount of your actual field of view. You're looking at 130 degree FOV with 1/3 of your actual FOV. It's hard to explain but look it up. Add on top of that the distortion in ranges and what not and most players being acclimated to sub 100 degree FOV in other games, it can look a little funny. If you have a bigger screen it feels much more comfortable though."
ChivalryGame,396t8k,TobiwanK3nobi,0,Wed Jun 10 01:49:40 2015 UTC,"Correct, a 130 degree FOV would feel comfortable if it was on a big projector screen about 3 feet in front of you."

I saw your video from last week, that was awesome."

Take it slow during fights and think about what your next move will be, though I'd recommend joining a team if you really want to improve. Scrimming and fighting against good players is the best way of getting better.  And thanks! Hope I'll get to record some more stuff in the tournament."
ChivalryGame,39761b,NippleCannon,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:01:19 2015 UTC,"The videos are quite old. I made the first bundle of videos before the polehammer, qstaff, or flails were even in the game. Its also possible that the damage values have since changed as there was the major patch that changed even the look of the game that launched when I was just finishing. However these were just meant to be a simple weapon guide to give people the basic gist of the weapons and by no means is a 'get good at chivalry quick' guide so you are right in that they don't provide much more than a simple weapon breakdown."

It's a good k/d, but you're doing the exact thing that drives people away from the game. Notice that a round is turning into a stack and go offense. If you MUST stack, at least go O so the round will be over quicker and teams are able to be reshuffled after the map switch.  Or whatever. Do what you want--but know that is kind of cunty behavior."

ChivalryGame,39735w,NSGCakeMaster,13,Tue Jun 9 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"I think this is a pretty poor review, so I'll chat about it here for a bit.  I know a lot of people are going to love the 'showcase' you insert at the start. Literally you only use lmbs and hit teamates as much as you do enemies. This is a laughable - literally, I laughed - showcase of the game and it typical of extremely new players who don't understand the game at all.  A lot of the actual review is just rambling, it doesn't make much sense sometimes and maybe a script would help you stay on topic 24/7. Also, you don't know your stuff. You give misinformation and sound unsure on a lot of things. It doesn't make a for a credible review.  Let's go through the content now  Your Pros   No lag   What? I still don't understand the point of this 'pro'. You put lag as both network and hardware wise as well without explaining. You seem to attribute it to both. If you have a cruddy gaming system you will run into issues running the game steadily and there are several notable maps that have historically had major issues in the framerate department. Also, because of the nature of the game ping is crucial and many will complain that the decision to use server sided this or client sided that creates issues in the network system TBS chose.    Customization   Apparently someone told you this, but I don't know who. Not like they probably know much about the game anyhow. You can't customize how you want to look like, you can't choose that much. You can change the patterns, choose between some colors, change between a fair amount of helmets, some payable, and some weapons have skins that you pay for. It's not bad at all and is certainly a plus, but you present it poorly.   Cool gamemodes   You don't even give any gamemodes. Most are just, normal game modes like CTF, FFA, TDM, etc. HOWEVER, one of the single biggest positives about chivalry is the uniqueness and execution of the Team Objective game mode. This is super well done and for many pushes chiv beyond other slasher games. You should have talked about this  Your Cons   No 'combat flow'   You never really explain it. Your lack of using any advanced mechanics makes me think that the jerky feeling you sense comes from your lack of familiarity with the game. Look up some high level duels or scrims with ripostes, target switching, PiP, etc etc   Glitchy game   Yup, that's chiv. You again sound unsure of what to say and kinda ramble here. It's your best honest complaint and you could have gone into it further.    Not warrant for the money   It's hard to say why this is wrong because you never give a reason why it is 'overpriced' other than it being a few years old. I think 25 is a fair price because of the unique game modes, uniqueness of the game, the execution, the graphics, the community, the sword fighting etc etc. Just explain what you're saying  You end with a completely arbitrary 8.5/10. No comment. ""The game isn't very fun to play"". You literally say that.  Anyhow, I think this review is kinda pointless. You don't know the game as it stands clearly, but you got some things right. You miss sooo many things to talk about, the in-built in humor, the competitive play, hell TO, and so many other things."

Combine all of the games you play for 2 hours or less before rambling out a review and I bet you'll easily pass that 300-hour count.

I don't like how slow and short it is, but that's where other weapons make up for those qualities. I don't see any inherent advantages if your play-style suits the weapon."

The ROH stuff is cheese and relies on surprising victims, imo. The range on it is very short and they can't effectively chase anyone while they spin around. Let the cheesers spend their stam and then poke them at your max range  Also, if you're playing a team game, I don't think you should engage dangerous players solo (if possible). Focus on keeping space against the hard-to-read attacks and parry everything you can. Hopefully a teammate will come help you. Tying up a dangerous player like this is better than quickly dying, and then that player chopping up the rest of your team"
ChivalryGame,3915g4,Derodyne,6,Tue Jun 9 14:37:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Footwork and distancing is key. If you keep backpedaling out of range, the messer cavemen will miss their blind combo attacks and eventually stam out, giving you a free hit. Simultaneously jumping while blocking is an easy way to put distance between you and your opponent, as the knockback will push you out of range."
ChivalryGame,3915g4,RagingBeard,3,Mon Jun 8 15:13:30 2015 UTC,Gotta love sending an Archer 30ft back when they jump block and immediately getting my head impaled by a pointy throwing stick.

ChivalryGame,3915g4,sw_faulty,5,Mon Jun 8 20:24:30 2015 UTC,"A key thing to learning vs better players is when vsing them, be VERY cognizant of the fact that just because you try something and it doesn't work, doesn't mean it was a bad approach.  good example:  you keep getting wrecked by messer decels, you decide to work on ducking them. You try to duck one vs a skilled opponent, fuck it up and die.  That doesn't make ducking a bad strat, its an excellent strat if you can do it properly, but it has its inherent risks which are amplified in the hands of a less skilled user.  TL;DR, keep trying shit and be aware/think about things that should work and aren't vs things that don't make sense"

ChivalryGame,3915g4,Yazuak,2,Mon Jun 8 15:22:50 2015 UTC,"I find that ROHs arent really that common in team games (on NA east coast servers at least) but they're best defended with your spacing. You really need to be in someone's face to get it to land. The attack is fast but has a tiny amount of range and you can often avoid getting hit simply by backing up. If he's in your face and you see him starting to lean back or offsetting you to his side, hit shift+s and get the heck out of there.  Lots of higher level guys will use overhands and drag them around your body to your feet instead of your head or shoulders. These attacks seem like they're going to miss or hit your head but they're pulled back in before the attack goes into recovery. In order to block these you want to maneuver back and away from the drag (to square your body in front of the blade) then parry mid to low. So if his drag is going to your left, you're going to swivel back and to your right while keeping your cursor on the tip of his blade. Try to hit your parry as late as you can as those sorts of drags partially depend on someone parrying too early to defend it.   Defending against these kinds of attacks takes practice and time, unfortunately, and there probably aren't any shortcuts besides understanding how the attacks are working. If worse comes to worst and you're just having a terrible night, get super aggressive and start hit trading them. It'll be much harder for them to get into a rhythm if you aren't overally concerned with defending yourself. It's not a good habit but if you don't have any other option then whatever.   edit: if you're east coast and want a quick primer on defense, you can hit me up on steam. Just drop me a PM with your steam name and I'll add you."
ChivalryGame,3915g4,Yazuak,2,Tue Jun 9 05:08:55 2015 UTC,"Duel exclusively against the best players you can find for a cumulative time of... 200 hours ish? There's really no way around it. And focus on improving rather than winning, which means identifying things you could be doing better and practicing them, rather than trying to cover up your weaknesses with a strength. (For example, if you're bad at blocking, you might be able to cover it up by going hard on the offensive, but that doesn't improve you as a player as much as letting them attack you and trying to block would.)  This may mean forfeiting some kills in the short term for your benefit as a player in the long run.  If you want to practice against me, I'm game. Send me a PM and I'll send you my steam profile."

ChivalryGame,3915g4,PreparetobePlaned,1 point,Wed Jun 10 06:28:32 2015 UTC,"Never throw a predictable attack. Always accelerate or decelerate attacks with dragging (YouTube search chivalry dragging). Also learn to matrix, some may not realize this but if you look up at the sky your body bends backwards. When looking up you give yourself a bit more time to parry or sometimes you can dodge the attack without parries using good footwork and sneak in and stab or overhead them while they recover from their miss. Also try not to always go straight towards an enemy, I typically attack players on a curve.   Also don't be afraid to feint, it's pretty useful, just don't be obnoxious about it.  When blocking an incoming attack, always right click the tip of the enemies weapon, it'll be more successful. Also sometimes players will often try to stab drag around your parry, sometimes you'll have to position your body sideways or backwards to successfully block the attack. Always track the enemies weapons tip.   All in all, experience is everything. Keep playing, you will get better progressively."

You just kinda set yourself up for hate by basing ALL of the play in the video off several gimmicks that irritate people.  1) 3rd person, tbh its fine, but a lot of people don't like it as it gives increased awareness surrounding you. I truthfully prefer first as you have much better visualization of what's in front of you but thats another discussion entirely.  2) Claymore - desyncs like mad, very, very fast. A good pick if you want a weapon that pisses people off  3) you only use LMB swings, its a noobier tactic (you very well might be a noob and are still working on incorporating stabs etc. If so - do it! other attacks are very important to not being predictable)  4) Short distance charges which hit teammates into groups of enemies, getting them killed, while you do 1,2, and 3  It's sort of like if you made a video solely of using norse sword and feinting people 3 times and then landing a stab, its not that your video was shit, its just that it hits a bit close to home"

ChivalryGame,38y9qm,Reithur,3,Mon Jun 8 16:16:32 2015 UTC,"3rd person is not allowed in competitive play; general consensus is that it's a low-skill crutch to be able to see around your player model when you should be using your situational awareness developed by playing in 1st person.  Many competitive players frequent this sub, thus the down votes.  On the other hand, many comp players use a wide FOV (Field of View) to widen their awareness, with common FOVs ranging from 110-130.  You can adjust your FOV above the max listsed in the Configuration menu by opening the Console (press the tilde key beside the 1 key) and typing FOV 130 or whatever range you wish.  As you increase it, you'll see a lot of distortion in your FOV.  It is possible to set it too high.  I suggest a Field of View set to 120."
ChivalryGame,38y9qm,DDRMANIAC007,0,Mon Jun 8 16:35:53 2015 UTC,"Ohh ok now I get it. However, the whole changing the FOV kind of defeats the point of developing situation awareness, might as well go with 3rd p if you're gonna adjust it anyway."

Every single creditable archer in EU knew immediatily when they heard that shortbow and sling can oneshot archers that it's bad.  Crushed probably saved the mod from even more stupid changes like this.  Also every class except archers can oneshot archers in melee.
ChivalryGame,38ylmq,ia_Flame,2,Mon Jun 8 12:29:09 2015 UTC,That's because the balance on archers wasn't actually made by archers. The council favored the ideas of the Melee players.  I stil think longbow shouldn't one shot archers to torso with broad head. And like you said now the best weapons are indeed the spammy ones. On top of that they gave short bow more ammo out of nowhere and a faster draw speed. Don't know why when it already had decent damage going for it but yep.

I kid - I heard someone say that the best way to play spear is to play like an asshole, and I think there's some truth in it, but you can definitely do okay playing normally.   At least now you know how to change weapons, and can start to experiment and find what you like - I'd recommend trying to unlock everything (by getting kills with the previous weapon in that row) to get a taste for it all, then try and focus on something. That said, if you're loving the greatsword, then by all means go to town."
ChivalryGame,38yzvt,ColonelHerro,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"I find the best way to use the spear is to use it normally. If you try and hide its attacks it makes it really obvious what you are going to do, therefor you can be ready to block. Just takes some practice to find the best way to block it really. Also, if you use it normally, the feints are a lot more harder to read because the weapon is a lot more closer to them. Really hard to stay out of the spear's reach, which is why I ♥ it."
ChivalryGame,38yzvt,Waffle_Knight,2,Mon Jun 8 05:17:19 2015 UTC,"I play in AU, so god help you if you feint with a spear.  But hiding its animations in the ground is fine, no problem, gg;wp.  ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯"
ChivalryGame,38yzvt,thefranchise23,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:31:37 2015 UTC,"I play in AU as well. Hiding the animations in the ground is fine, but against experienced players I wouldn't recommend it. Really easy to block them. You just look in the direction their body is facing to block it, because you can't do wiggly stabs with a spear like you can with great swords. :3"
ChivalryGame,38yzvt,BCJunglist,1 point,Tue Jun 9 06:26:59 2015 UTC,I asked the same question on this subreddit about 6 months ago lol
ChivalryGame,38yzvt,ColonelHerro,2,Mon Jun 8 02:33:05 2015 UTC,"I have not bought weapons before so I may be wrong about this... But if that is a replacement for the halberd you will first need to unlock the halberd which is the third polearm weapon.  You have purchased a skin for an unlockable weapon, so make sure you have unlocked the halberd first, which can take some time."
ChivalryGame,38yzvt,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Mon Jun 8 02:07:47 2015 UTC,"it's a spear that i bought but it might be the problem, im lvl 11 when do I get it?"
ChivalryGame,38yzvt,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Mon Jun 8 02:11:53 2015 UTC,"Weapons are unlocked by getting kills with the previous weapons.   For example, vanguard has 3 types of primary weapon - Two Handed Swords, Spears and Polearms.   The two-handed Swords go Greatsword > Claymore > Zweihander. To unlock claymore, you need to get kills with the Greatsword, to unlock the Zwei, you have to get kills with the claymore or greatsword.   Same applies for every weapon, for every class, including their secondary weapons.   Hope this helps!   EDIT: I should add that weapons aren't necessarily better because they're 2nd or 3rd tier - they all have different strengths and weaknesses. Typically 1st tier is balanced, 2nd is weaker and faster, 3rd is stronger and slower. That's a huge generalisation, though, so just play each one and find what you like."

ChivalryGame,38n2ea,BCJunglist,4,Fri Jun 5 07:35:46 2015 UTC,Chivalry uses the UDP ports 50000:65535.  So just set those to highest priority and you should be set.
ChivalryGame,38n2ea,sharknice,2,Fri Jun 5 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"would I simply name the service ""chivalry""?"
ChivalryGame,38n2ea,sharknice,2,Fri Jun 5 21:00:40 2015 UTC,"yes, it doesn't matter what it is called, the label is just for your convenience."
ChivalryGame,38n2ea,gentlemandinosaur,1 point,Fri Jun 5 22:05:47 2015 UTC,Ahh OK. Thanks for clarifying that. That's what's really been confusing me... I know it uses 7layer info to manage services but I thought each service needed specific names.  Thanks a bunch!
ChivalryGame,38n2ea,sharknice,5,Fri Jun 5 23:26:25 2015 UTC,"QOS is only really going to help with outgoing packets you realize? Sure, you can set up a high priority for incoming but it will NOT really improve latency that is coming from multiple hops or distance.   And setting upi for this game specifically? Why? Its based on the device and service. There is no Chiv service... just set up for priority on your PC.   Just log into the router through the webservice.   To be able to configure DD-WRT QoS press click the Enable check box. All the greyed settings should then become available.  In the “Port” check box, leave the setting on WAN, which is the default.  If setting up for only Chiv a better throughput can be achieved with HFSC. If you want to optimize several services select HFB.   DO A SPEEDTEST. To determine your optimum up and down. And only set it to about 85% of that speed. You need some for general operations and to keep from bottlenecking.   The Optimize for Gaming option is disabled by default. If setting up for only Chiv. Check this box.   Skip Netmask priority.   Add your MAC Address for your PC to the MAC priority section.   Add your max up and down for your PC. I would just put the 85% of maximum bandwidth again.   Finally press the Save button to save the current configuration and then Apply button to apply the QoS settings to your DD-WRT router.  EDIT: On a side note... Are you an everyday junglist? Old school or new? I am more of a Raga and Techstep fan myself."
ChivalryGame,38n2ea,gentlemandinosaur,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:12:58 2015 UTC,"Everyday junglist checking in.  But Yea I know how to set up QoS and currently have my machine set to high priority via Mac address. But I kind of wanted to set it on a service by service basis instead because I sometimes have multiple services on this machine taking bandwidth at the same time (streaming video while playing, etc)  So for now, as far as the network goes my setup is fine and my machine is high priority but I would much prefer to drop my machine priority and set up a service priority for chiv.  Basically I'm not sure what I would name it....  (Edit: also thanks for the reply, I was sure that I would get no responses)"
ChivalryGame,38n2ea,sharknice,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:11:03 2015 UTC,QoS is for your own traffic.  For example you can torrent while you game without lagging by giving your game priority.  You can also give priority to your gaming computer so you can play without any added lag as other people download and stream on other devices.    I have mine setup and my wife torrents and streams like crazy and it doesn't effect my ping at all.
ChivalryGame,38n2ea,gentlemandinosaur,2,Fri Jun 5 17:33:05 2015 UTC,What do you think I was talking about? Your neighbor's traffic?   It doesn't help if you are far away from the server and have multiple hops was the point of my first sentence. Latency is latency.
ChivalryGame,38n2ea,redditors_r_manginas,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:31:13 2015 UTC,"How you said it, and how you are responding implies that your own traffic can't add latency.  It can and does, which is the entire point of QoS."

ChivalryGame,38n2ea,Manzanis,2,Fri Jun 5 13:31:27 2015 UTC,QOS means quality of service. Its a packet prioritizing service for routers to prioritize where the incoming/outgoing packets are sent.   Its used for everything from video prioritizing and voip to gaming.

ChivalryGame,38crd9,ColonelHerro,6,Wed Jun 3 22:35:25 2015 UTC,"I got called out for calling people noobs but I was not having a go at anyone for starting out or being shit, as we were all shit at the beginning.   But it is rather rude when people TK you and its obvious and they don't apologize in chat or something. Thats general gaming etiquette after all.  However its nice to see you are having fun and in a similar fashion to how I had fun at the beginning, you dont care about dying because those moments where you get a win are all the more better because of it, and of course the hilarity this game ensues.   And it really is great to see so many new people in game, it was funny the other night I was the only person over like level 10 in a 70 man server, I could completely understand why there were not any other high levels as it is extremely frustrating just fighting lmb players, well frustrating isnt the right word, boring is more correct. But it is still fun enough to just waltz around avoiding hits and getting killed by teammates, they will learn eventually and I am just happy people are not just sticking to the level 15 servers."
ChivalryGame,38crd9,nightbringer57,3,Wed Jun 3 13:20:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with TK apologies, it is basic etiquette, you're right.   If I know I've TK'd someone I'll apologise, the oil pot incident garnered a sorry for everyone who could have been caught. Which was more or less my whole team.   What I was getting at really is that in my experience so far, this game seems to have a lower proportion of people who just seem to spend their time insulting people for being new than some other games I've played.   Don't get me wrong, it doesn't particularly bother me. It's as much a part of online gaming as anything else.  I was just pleasantly surprised that there seemed to be a smaller amount of those that do.  Either that or in my inexperience, I'm just not noticing the chat window."

ChivalryGame,38g2rn,MrStern,16,Wed Jun 3 23:53:44 2015 UTC,"Hi MrStern.  It should take you 100 kills to unlock the 3rd weapon of any type.  You must use the Spear for at least the first 25 kills, which should unlock the Fork.  You then need 75 kills using either the Spear or Fork to unlock the Brandi.  Servers running mods do not let you keep any XP, ranks, or weapon unlocks; anything you unlock here is lost after the match ends.  These servers are brown in the server list.  If your goal is weapon unlocks, I suggest avoiding the servers running mods and to keep using the spear or fork; you'll get the brandi eventually."

ChivalryGame,38gi65,Stubbstepp,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:29:54 2015 UTC,"Intermediate level programmer here. Lots of things will cause this game to crash. Give us some details and maybe we can help point you to the right solution :)  When the ""crash"" occurs, what happens? Does your whole computer freeze or just the application? Try to think of any changes you've made in settings which may be triggering it to crash. Also remember as steam updates chivalry it may wipe your settings back to default - make sure any performance tweaks you've made in the past get re-tweaked.  Lastly, with the alt-tab gamble of ""will I be able to get back into chivalry this time?"" often feeling like 50/50 chance.. I've found a solution that works for me every time now. If I minimize the game is must not be during server change or while steam overlay is active. No idea why. Furthermore if I alt tab for a minute or two it never lets me back in easy - I end up hovering my mouse over the open app icon from desktop.. then hovering up an inch to the sample window.. which full screens after about 10 seconds.. click it and I'm back in the game. Sort of a fiasco but this has probably saved me an hour or two of restarting over the last year."
ChivalryGame,38gi65,BrianHorror,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:31:19 2015 UTC,"Usually just the application, also I run it in borderless window and have start up videos turned off using a launch option. Also a way I know I'm going to crash is when I check info on a server to see what friends are in there and it won't show any names. Then like 30 seconds later it crashes. Also, change launch options for borderless windowed. I never crash from alt tabbing, so maybe that is a fix, but I also have two monitors so it never fully alt tabs to the bar."
ChivalryGame,38gi65,Killua-,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:22:47 2015 UTC,"The game crashes.  It returns me to the desktop.  Chivilary will still be running but the window running chivalry is just white.  It stays there for about a minute and finally closes.  I can use the taskbar but the chivlry window stays on top and all other applications are hidden behind it.  The crash usually happens within 10 - 20 seconds of joining the server.  Doesnt happen all the time but usually once or twice a day.  Sometimes before i pick a team, sometimes right after i spawn.  I have not installed anything recently.  I do not have any issues with alt-tab.  Started having the issue when the latest update came out.  Could just be a coincedence which is why i posted to see if others just started having issues too."

Despite an intense love of the game and 1k hours into it I couldn't handle it. I never argued with anyone, never took the bait, rarely was the person being hated on, but it robs every ounce of my enjoyment. If I relapse it takes about two matches before I am locked into an hour long game with one of them on my team. Usually they let you know right away they are going to feed, ward your base the entire round, and blame the guy who didn't do what they want. I know it's not over due to one of five on my team but I don't want to help the guy win and it's twice as hard. I never quit a match so I am just stuck there. In Chivalry the match soon ends and I can quickly depart. I wouldn't compare the toxicity there to Chivalry ever. I really feel like I was just chased off by the community there which more often than not embraces the guy it. The other team will encourage it because it is an easy win then and herd conformity dictates at one of your team joining in so he can feel like he is somehow winning by now sitting in base when you tried to pick up the slack. I was never banned, never argued, and I just want a match I tried building teams but they always have someone who does the same."

It is really funny to see people accuse my brother of hacking and being so certain when I am literally sitting behind him and watching him play. When I play with Eagles and below and they accuse someone of cheats, I just kind of laugh and give the accused the benefit of the doubt.

ChivalryGame,38cdma,Infernuss,10,Wed Jun 3 10:06:53 2015 UTC,"3rd person gives u 24/7 situational awareness; first person allows you you read feints and perform better against backswings and stabs  you can give yourself extra awareness in 1st person by increasing your FoV  first person is the only accepted camera perspective for competitive players though, third person players look ridiculous (groundsniffers, brokeback niggas, etc.) hence why nobody takes any 3rd player seriously. Although there are few good ones out there"
ChivalryGame,38cdma,Kesby,2,Wed Jun 3 11:42:25 2015 UTC,"Ok, cool. I wish I could have somebody better than me to play this game with, so I can learn a little. Is the subreddit's teamspeak something I should check out when I get home?"
ChivalryGame,38cdma,Reithur,2,Wed Jun 3 11:45:57 2015 UTC,"Absolutely!   A good place to learn is in servers running a map called duel yard.  Many competitive players go there to practise.   You will be killed many times in there, but it's how you learn.   Bow or war cry to challenge someone and wait for them to respond before you attack.   Keep your cool and don't be afraid to ask questions. If you ask, someone may join you in the reddit team speak to help you."
ChivalryGame,38cdma,Reithur,2,Wed Jun 3 13:39:44 2015 UTC,"I gave the duelyard a shot for about one and a half hour. I won about half my duels, lost pretty much only to helicopters and bachwards overheads (those that hit you while not looking at you before the animation starts)."
ChivalryGame,38cdma,arhythm,2,Wed Jun 3 17:25:54 2015 UTC,"Good for you for staying in there for so long.  For reference, most of the Duelyard servers have 3rd person disabled, so those players likely were using 1st person.  When facing these guys, back up and let them miss a few times; their stamina will deplete with misses and they can't regain it if you pressure them while they're trying to orient themselves.  You'll find that they'll be easier to defeat."

Switching to 3rd person was a massive power boost for me, but it ruined the epic feel that the 1st person view had.   I don't play anymore, but it's mostly because the game has tons of other issues. Like shields not blocking a side swing when the tip of the blade isn't on your screen. Or archers blocking a overhead swing of a 2 handed great maul with just a dagger in one hand. Hell, even with a shield that's a great way to break your arm."

Your ""skills"" will devolve into hit trading (cavemanning) as a knight with a messer or maul.  If you play in 1st person, you learn to actually look around and can defend yourself properly.  Edit: I should add that in North America, 3rd person is not used or permitted in competitive play."

Dragging, third person, roh are all way more common. And due to third person you can't read feints as well because you can't actually see up close stabs and whatnot and all of them don't ever practice against it so they get tricked by them easily. Thus, as in every chiv player, their egos get butthurt after such a long time of building them up on a pedestal and the result is what you experienced. Players get mad and kick you and call you trash for simply playing the game."

So when the odd blacksheep comes along and rapes experienced players even though they may not be a better all round player, it makes them mad and they rage in chat  And then this hate on the feints discourages all the other good players, because obviously they don't want to be hated on by the community. So in the end like 1/100 people feint and no one learns to how to defend against it, hence for the common peasant it seems using feints to win is magic and sorcery that no one can defend against.  I've played a lot of feints just for reading them in these rare occasions, but don't mind which I'm fighting. I can't really blame anyone over here getting mad about it seeings as they're almost not allowed to do it and it seems unfair, but shit like this is just ridiculous and I reckon it's just a blatant troll."

They are fairly easy to read if you just play carefully (granted some feints are very difficult to read, but if you have good footwork you can read 90% of them). I've found that they also add alot more to the game, compared to just playing non-feints. If you need someone to spar with that uses feints I would be more than happy to.

Feints are not, and thats the essence of feintings bad rep in oceania.  You can definitely improve at reading a players ""pattern"" but as long as there are look down overheads and accelerated swings then feinting and reading feints will always include a coin toss element. And anything which brings the game towards ""coin tossy"" is shunned in aus. If you think facehug broadsword lookdown feints are readable then we have nothing to talk about.  In aus/nz we don't see a need for the feint mechanic to exist on top of the existing array of tricks like dragging, accelerating, good footwork etc. Anything that relies on chance makes it more likely for a noob to beat a skilled player, and that's not the game we want in Oceania.  We do have a few good players who feint though, and they are respected, at least among other high level players.

I'll admit there are some good arguments for feinting, or rather a feint-like mechanic, but as it is I can't get behind it and if you can't get behind it you may as well sort posts by least popular on this sub.  It's pointless posting anything against the grain of feint here, even if it's a legitimate perspective or opinion. Let the 'meta-game' guys here circle jerk about how people who dislike feints are 'elitist' while using the downvote button as a disagree button and cumming all over each others faces with really shitty memes and celeb-player glorification.  Speaking as an EU player who has successfully feinted literally every person who joins a public server looking to 'pub stomp' and has feinted me (including some in this thread) because they weren't expecting it in my attack pattern, but would never admit to it because of ego.  This divide could be resolved by TB, by having feint servers and no feint servers--adding a short timer after pressing q/right click to allow FTP/attack cancelling on friendlies while not being able to attack again within the second or two timer.

ChivalryGame,3889zc,ia_Flame,2,Wed Jun 3 08:12:28 2015 UTC,Honestly I bet if Mercs changes were implemented into live a lot fewer people would hate feints. Those windup increases and feint window decreases are pretty nice.
ChivalryGame,3889zc,Manzanis,-3,Wed Jun 3 17:02:36 2015 UTC,"Well, vote kicking people for being jerks is also apparently part of the game. So... i guess you should learn to read the lobby like other high-level players do to avoid pitchforks. Hey man, it's what TB intended, ergo, it must be 100% fair and skill-based. Gotta git gud."
ChivalryGame,3889zc,ia_Flame,-8,Wed Jun 3 19:51:07 2015 UTC,"Because they're real men over there.  p.s. if you think feinting is readable, your opponent is feinting you with the wrong weapon."
ChivalryGame,3889zc,Manzanis,10,Wed Jun 3 01:37:50 2015 UTC,"I agree that feints aren't quite readable in vanilla on a lot of weapons because of those sweet .4 stab wind ups and shit along with fave hugging. But there is an element of skill in ""reading"" by analyzing a player's patterns and guessing when I'm the fight their next feint will most likely occur."
ChivalryGame,3889zc,ia_Flame,0,Tue Jun 2 21:43:56 2015 UTC,It's still guessing. Guessing is not a skill.
ChivalryGame,3889zc,Manzanis,2,Wed Jun 3 00:03:24 2015 UTC,Pattern recognition is though
ChivalryGame,3889zc,ia_Flame,0,Wed Jun 3 05:03:22 2015 UTC,"It's extremely easy to feint without forming a pattern with it. Sure, if you open with a feint before every attack, or combo into a feint after each hit you land, you're in for a world of pain, but it's always the lone, unexpected feint at the end of an intense fight that turns the tables and really can't be countered."
ChivalryGame,3889zc,Manzanis,2,Wed Jun 3 21:46:29 2015 UTC,Every player has a pattern and with that knowledge you can fairly accurately estimate when the next feint is likely to occur. After that it's up to you to not parry at the sight of any movement.
ChivalryGame,3889zc,ia_Flame,0,Thu Jun 4 04:40:39 2015 UTC,You actually have to suck really hard or be a feint spammer in order to have a feinting pattern.
ChivalryGame,3889zc,SaltyIngredients,2,Thu Jun 4 14:45:02 2015 UTC,The best players all have patterns as they do it subliminally. To the average player they look random but duel against someone long enough and you learn their pattern

Everyone just runs from fight to fight and tries to steal the last hits when they see someone in a 1v1."
ChivalryGame,386m8d,MadTapirMan,2,Wed Jun 3 08:36:19 2015 UTC,"Classic duels are different and in my opinion a lot more fun than regular duels.   Its FFA format, but there is an unspoken code. If you run around jacking people in the back while they're dueling someone else you will be swiftly kicked.   You just run up to someone, bow your head, and if they do the same you begin dueling. The winner can then drink from the fountain in the middle of the map to return to full health and be ready for their next duel.   These servers tend to be where higher level players practice their craft. You can expect to see feints ( unspoken rule here is if you feint, feints are now fair game so prepare for someone to feint you back) dragged strikes and reverse overhead attacks.   It's probably the best way to get better; don't be afraid to ask for advice or ""how did you do that?""  Enjoy!"

ChivalryGame,386m8d,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Tue Jun 2 14:57:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, pal.  Find your way into Order of the Maul Duelyard today (US EAST) Add player-name Mauldini to your friends and message me when you're ready to learn.  Thanks for the post and hope to see you around this week. If it's the dessert swings you're having trouble dealing with (rev overheads, rev slashes, rev alt swings etc) I can definitely help you understand how to cope. With practice and focus you will learn how to see them coming and counter effectively (like rotating out of pocket, causing them to miss and giving you a chance to land a well timed counter). Ultimately once you understand the setup and timings of these swings they'll be just like blocking any typical swing. What you'll find is that many players will react to you blocking them by faking their setups and dragging back to a normal swing (like turn left into a rev overhead to make you think it will need blocked immediately.. once you parry they turn right and bring it back around the normal overhead way).   Hope this makes sense."

I got a refund for the Sims 3 once, but I was told in the email that it wasn't normal procedure and it was just ""a gesture of customer service.""   I told them that I was unable to play the game I paid for and I wanted a refund.   They removed it from my library and put the $20 in my steam wallet.   You can try this, but be aware that it's probably fairly unlikely you will be able to get any money back.   EDIT: I just read some stuff about a new refund policy for steam?

ChivalryGame,382k0j,Anstii,7,Mon Jun 1 15:34:12 2015 UTC,"I had noted this as well, only got accused of hacking once, almost no toxicity. However the amount of lmb smashing and blatant team damage was still at its typical height."
ChivalryGame,382k0j,jrodb92,2,Mon Jun 1 19:52:42 2015 UTC,"I thought that shit was hilarious. Every time a new player blatantly tk'd me because i had white armor instead of blue, or brown instead of red. I even had three noobs gang up on me once because of my armor."

ChivalryGame,382k0j,BCJunglist,2,Mon Jun 1 20:20:23 2015 UTC,"Well i meant more along the lines of being lmbed three times in a row by the same guy when their isnt any enemies within reach. Which actually happened to me. Or when they lmb at an enemies position prior to their death, after theyre already on the ground and hit you in the process."

ChivalryGame,382k0j,_Huey,11,Wed Jun 3 08:45:08 2015 UTC,Played on the 64 man server all weekend. The hardest part was remembering to adjust your playing when you faced one of the two veterans on the other team.    On hillside I held the lower ballista by myself one time. I think I killed 13 in a row before one got lucky
ChivalryGame,382k0j,HELPMEIMGONADIE,15,Mon Jun 1 14:35:07 2015 UTC,Love the standoff of coming face to face with the only other player on the other team who is experienced.  A battle of the ages!

ChivalryGame,382k0j,Reithur,8,Mon Jun 1 18:21:38 2015 UTC,"Former free weekender here, bought the game hit rank 5. Love those duel serves for making you good."
ChivalryGame,382k0j,Blackbart42,5,Mon Jun 1 14:03:57 2015 UTC,Welcome aboard!  Feel free to ask questions!
ChivalryGame,382k0j,Reithur,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:41:37 2015 UTC,Which maps are best?
ChivalryGame,382k0j,Blackbart42,4,Tue Jun 2 01:05:48 2015 UTC,"Depends; what game mode do you like and what do you define as ""best""?  Do you like dueling?  Free for All?  Team Objective?  Last Team Standing or Team Death Match?  Some maps are considered more balanced for competitive Team Objective matches; Dark Forest, StonesHill are the most popular, though others starting to see more use.  Some maps are kinda buggy; the new maps have the most holes in them that haven't been patched yet.  These are listed in the Commuuuuunity video.  Team Objective maps are my favourites;  they have many different goals for you and your team to work towards and it feels more like a campaign mode than the other modes.  Some maps in TO allow you to become the king if you score high enough; Stoneshill, Coldfront, Citadel, and Kings Garden allow you to become a king on the defending teams.  Belmez has a king on both teams in the last objective, and many players call for a king vs. king fight!  Some Team Objective maps are considered to be too long, even if they're pretty cool; Citadel, Bazaar and Belmez are very large, long maps with multiple objectives to overcome.  I like them all, but be careful in Belmez; the first area is swampy and you can easily run into the water and drown.  Watch your feet while you run, or follow the lily pads to get through safely.  There are many duel maps, but everyone seems to vote for Moor in duel-mode (which is unfortunate because it reks my FPS and makes it hard for me to duel there).  There are private or unofficial servers that run a custom map called Duelyard in FFA mode; these are often practice yards for the clans and are not actually Free for All.  Etiquette here is to bow or warcry to an opponent to initiate a duel, then give them a couple seconds to respond before you start attacking.  If someone refuses or doesn't acknowledge, back off; you will be kicked for ""randoming"" if you attack without issuing a challenge.  You can learn a lot in these servers, but expect to be destroyed again and again.  They will likely answer questions if you're polite and don't rage against them.  The Last Team Standing or Team Death Match maps are usually small to medium maps that have 2 sides that are near-mirrors of each other with a dividing feature in the middle; Ruins has a river, Argon's Wall has a wall, Frost Peak has a valley, etc.  Free for all has many maps that are borrowed from all game modes.  Crypt/Horde modes are player vs. enemy rather than player vs. player; these modes put you on a small team of players against increasingly larger waves of enemies.  You usually level up and acquire more hit points and better weapons as you go.  I recommend trying this at least once; it's pretty different from the rest of the game.  Some game modes are custom; these are coloured brown on the server list and you may need to download the mod before you can play.  Fun modes are Black Knight (lose your limbs and head while still playing!), Star Wars (lightsabers for everyone!), Giant Slayer (collect kills, grow bigger and stronger), and many others; there used to be a magic mod w/ a spellcaster class, but I haven't seen a server run this in a long time.  A note on XP gained; you gain ranks and weapon unlocks by getting kills or assists while playing on official servers or unofficial servers running regular game modes.  You do not gain XP by completing objectives; freeing the slaves, or using the battering ram earns you a lot of in-match points, but this is different from XP. Be careful with servers running mods; you don't get to keep the XP you earn, so any ranks or weapons you gain while playing these won't be there next match.  Hope this helps.  Any others?"

You can set the Max to 120, but the MinSmoothFrameRate should be 8.33 (in milliseconds, the time required for each frame at 120 fps).

ChivalryGame,380zyp,Clayton-BigsB,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:57:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd want it always free - this weekend was pretty positive overall, but there were definitely a few more toxic people than normal (dickheads logging on, then spamming ""NIGGERS"" in chat trying to be edgy, etc.)  But I agree - game should be $5-10, to keep a stead stream of newbies coming in."
ChivalryGame,380zyp,Clayton-BigsB,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:05:55 2015 UTC,chat can be disabled.
ChivalryGame,380zyp,nightbringer57,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:10:26 2015 UTC,"Sure can - but the people abusing chat typically aren't playing the game either. They're just intentionally TKing. Plus, what a pain in the ass, to have to keep muting people in chat, or disabling chat (which I use a fair bit myself).   I'd love to see more casual players in the game, but I think free-to-play would bring too much toxicity. $5 would be ideal, imo. I'm honestly surprised they're still asking for ~$30 for this game - I'd be interested to see what their sales figures are like."
ChivalryGame,380zyp,robodanjal,2,Tue Jun 2 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"well considering now they've sold over 2 million copies and that was a while back, even at the LOWEST price that's like 10 mil. Then you've got over 50$ at LEAST of DLC you COULD buy i'd say between sales and DLC still pretty decent even if only like 10% of people that bought the game play or bought dlc. And that's just MW and not including DW sales.  but of course i have no idea."
ChivalryGame,380zyp,Derodyne,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:55:58 2015 UTC,"I more mean month by month - their liquidity can't be brilliant. Except for sale weekends, I don't ever see level 0s around, meaning no one (or not many) is buying the game. Surely their cosmetic DLC sales aren't enough to pay wages (which wouldn't be negligible considering they're working on a new project) and overheads?   Or maybe I'm grossly underestimating how many people around the world are buying this game then buying the skins.   I would guess we can expect a whole lot more skins added to the game as time goes on so they can keep paying the bills haha."
ChivalryGame,380zyp,Jikarta,2,Tue Jun 2 21:07:09 2015 UTC,"it's like free money for them man, it's workshop content so other people are making it and they're putting it in the game. They're paying with percentage back to the creators so cost wise they're not having to have people actually work to make those, just to put them in the game which doesn't take long at all considering that we've seen people adding it to their builds to test them obviously.  they should just sell t-shirts and shit man if they need money. Making the game free to play would still be a pretty good model. People love customization man, i can only speak for myself but i've bought customizatoin and other bullshit in plenty of games. I have probably more customization money spent in games than i've spent in some of the past steam sales and all the games I buy during them."

ChivalryGame,380zyp,nicoliam,3,Mon Jun 1 12:21:15 2015 UTC,I had a great time.  I had been debating about getting this game since last October and it had been on my wishlist since then. Played for about an hour and then just bought it outright.  Up to lvl 16 now and getting into the swing of things.
ChivalryGame,380zyp,AceCase2D,2,Mon Jun 1 12:42:46 2015 UTC,Keep it up! Level 16+ is often a baptism by fire (no more low rank servers) but you'll make your way up the steep learning curve with time. Let us know if you have any questions!
ChivalryGame,380zyp,Mixpickle,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:09:58 2015 UTC,"I have a question if you have the time? I'm rank 12 and as soon as I think I'm doing well I realise I suck.   I enjoy playing maa with the quarterstaff (have a thing for being different and for quarterstaffs), and I am getting absolutely dominated by vanguards with massive swords (zweis?). I think their reach is longer than my staff.  Any tips would be very appreciated."
ChivalryGame,380zyp,Mixpickle,2,Mon Jun 1 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"No problem! All of us sucked when we first started. This game takes time to get good, but the payoff is very noticeable (I didn't hit my stride until probably rank 30+). Keep at it!  The quaterstaff is a lot of fun, but is actually one of the more difficult/less effective weapons in the game (i.e. it has weak attacks and wonky animations; you also don't see many players using them, and none at the comp level). Nevertheless, when facing off versus those vanguards with big swords, they will have more damage and range than you, but you have the speed advantage   The QS attack speed is fast so use this to your advantage. Try to close the gap quickly and keep the attack pressure on. You can often flinch their attacks since your weapon is faster.  Avoid parrying too early/panic parrying. The Zwei is very effective at dragging (delayed, slow attacks), so try to parry at the last moment as opposed to right when you see the animation. This technique will take time to perfect If you parry an attack, definitely go for the riposte (parry followed immediately by an attack). It is very fast on the QS and can catch a lot of players off guard Use MAA dodge to sidestep their attacks or to close the gap. If they swing and miss, dodge in and punish them with a quick attack. Watch out for those big slashes on the zwei tho, since the sword is long enough to punish your dodge"
ChivalryGame,380zyp,DerJakane,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:30:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to write that up. Since asking for help I figured out the get in closer and hit of they miss, but am definitely still panic parrying. I'll keep working on it, definitely having a better time of it. I actually played a game as vanguard yesterday and topped the scoreboard, it taught me the weaknesses a bit I think"
ChivalryGame,380zyp,Chuckdatass,3,Thu Jun 4 15:10:37 2015 UTC,"I am a free-weekender had a blast and bought the game and know working my drag, delay riposte etc skills, thank you guys for not screaming at me when i TK for my noobness, will see you in the war fields :)"
ChivalryGame,380zyp,Speedy1357,2,Thu Jun 4 23:00:35 2015 UTC,Was going to play the free weekend thing but a couple hours in I decided to just buy the game haha.  I'm terrible though so I'm all ears if people have any tips they'd like to share.
ChivalryGame,380zyp,KilltheInfected,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:21:23 2015 UTC,"If you're in AU then I'd be happy to duel with you and show you the basics.   But the main way you'll learn is by trying to work out why you died each time - did you misjudge your weapon range, leading you open to attack? Or did you misread a drag and parry too early?  There's a lot of videos in the sidebar which are good to watch. If you haven't done the tutorial yet, I'd suggest doing that, as well. Most of all, stick with it, and don't get frustrated when you die, it'll happen a lot before you start getting better.   Also, don't be afraid to ask for help  either! A lot of players will be more than happy to practice with you."
ChivalryGame,380zyp,Speedy1357,2,Tue Jun 2 06:15:42 2015 UTC,"ill have you know, that im from free week and i didnt play vanguard/knight and start slashing everywhere regardless if my teammates were there"
ChivalryGame,37yx5r,BarnesDude,9,Sun May 31 16:08:16 2015 UTC,"It makes me feel like a champ being able to LMB through a crowd, snag some kills, and come out on the other side in one piece."

ChivalryGame,37yx5r,AceCase2D,3,Sun May 31 21:24:23 2015 UTC,"Rank 4 here, actually doing surprisingly well, probably helps I do sword fighting in real life but that's neither here nor there. Love this game can't believe I never saw it before."
ChivalryGame,37yx5r,JacobMichaelKing,3,Mon Jun 1 01:43:21 2015 UTC,"You are also doing well because there aren't only rank 30+ you play against. When I started playing the game again like 2 weeks ago I got completely rekt even though I played the game before (I stopped shortly after ranks came out), because there were only rank 25 to 50s everywhere and I was just fresh 16. Now I'm rank 22 and actually often get the first or second place on my team, just because there are so many new players that don't do anything other than spamming LMB."
ChivalryGame,37yx5r,MadTapirMan,2,Mon Jun 1 11:50:10 2015 UTC,"Rank 30 here, it's very easy to pick up an entire group of kills if you just keep swinging and know how to drag, almost no one knows how to block."

ChivalryGame,382zj4,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:19:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah every time a new game starts you'll have to press h again. So, the way it works if I remember right, is like follows  First H-> turns off friend ui  second h-> turn off objective ui  third h-> toggles both on  98% of the time it works as it should, sometimes one obj. gets bugged and you need to reconnect if you want to get out of it (reconnect in console)"
ChivalryGame,382zj4,Clayton-BigsB,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"There are 3 toggles total on the H key, i can't remember which off the top of my head but from the totally off position it should be something like:  H1 - Friend markers + objective  H2 - Either just friends or just objective markers (i can't remember which)  H3- off  Also, it should be noted that on certain maps (I'm looking at you bazaar and king's garden), the shit's all fucked up and you can have a bunch of them all crowding your view with no ability to get rid of or toggle anything. It's nice when you're trying to arch and you have the crosshair + 2 green icons floating in your eyes."
ChivalryGame,382zj4,Chuckdatass,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:25:17 2015 UTC,Don't look at the scoreboard prior to the game starting. That will bug it. Any ui screen while the game is in the warmup phase.

ChivalryGame,382vkr,HELPMEIMGONADIE,3,Mon Jun 1 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"There's some HUGE things that impact this lower number. One, it counts people who never lauinched the game. So people who have the game sitting in inventory, at least how I understand. It does count free weekeenders. And I mean, there are a LOT of free weekenders. People who play the game for 2 days and never again pull that number again.  Source: I gave those stats"

A good captain can use that to their advantage, I think if you had found a good group with an atmosphere that fit you better you could have found a fun place for yourself in casual scrims and the like. Bit late for that now."
ChivalryGame,37zn7i,HELPMEIMGONADIE,3,Sun May 31 22:06:07 2015 UTC,Last thing I remember from int was them in the Summer 2013 tournament. Is that when the show ended for int officially?
ChivalryGame,37zn7i,TobiwanK3nobi,4,Sun May 31 23:18:52 2015 UTC,"I guess, I don't remember. We just slowly withered after that. Basically bada stopped enjoying the game and quit, so I think we stopped competing for the most part. He was the one who organized everything - practices, goof-around nights, scrims, tournaments. He also inspired a lot of the competitive enthusiasm of int. He made us a team.  Some of our other key players stopped playing as well. So I feel like one of the reasons we fell apart was too-strict recruiting. We didn't have replacements. I specifically remember one recruiting event where like 40 players turned up who wanted in, among them Guts. No one got invited to join. Cmon, who turns away Guts?"
ChivalryGame,37zn7i,TheGiantGlobEater,3,Mon Jun 1 01:07:34 2015 UTC,"Can you expand on the recruiting part? I remember around that time I was a scrub and heard some rumors about it, kinda. Like, what went down?"
ChivalryGame,37zn7i,TobiwanK3nobi,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:37:55 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I wasn't very active at the time. I never actually attended a recruiting event. I think what they did was divide the mass into teams and have them duke it out with each other in a TO. The int recruiters watched and listened in TS to see if there were any people they liked. Something like that.  That was late int-era recruiting though. Before that we just invited individual people to a few practices, then took a full-clan vote on if we wanted to accept them. The vote had to be a unaninimous yes. The main qualification was that we had to like them, get along with them. Most of our members were recruited that way, and I think it really helped with team unity. There wasn't any clan drama - no fights or bitterness.  I miss int. :("
ChivalryGame,37zn7i,TheGiantGlobEater,2,Mon Jun 1 02:56:40 2015 UTC,I remember that tryout event. I actually got accepted and even played a few scrims with you guys.

There is a graphics tuning guide somewhere out there where it shows you how to give CMW 'runescape' graphics. It makes the game look like shit but can really help people with old systems.  The original reddit post. The guide on the forums. I don't how much of this info is still applicable - the .ini has changed many times since then. I don't think the pastebin on the reddit post will work. But you should be able to improve your frame stability quite a bit if you use the guide to painstakingly go through every field in the .ini and set it to minimum values.

ChivalryGame,37vb4g,TheHumpalot,3,Sat May 30 22:32:48 2015 UTC,"That helmet was a gift to Henry the Eighth from the ruler of the German empire. It's both a sign of respect and also a show of technological prowess. It's a caricature of the German rulers own face. At the time there was an ""arms race"" in medieval armor. This is an example. There are many great documentaries on this."

An early 16th century piece that's part of a full suit. The suit was a gift to king Henry viii from the Holy Roman Emperor at the time (I forget his name). The helmet is meant to resemble king Henry's face (I think). I'm sort of in to medieval armor. So yeah...  And by influenced, I mean king Henry (or at least the armourer who made it) would sue the modder if either were alive today."

One the the complaints I read about some of the first weapons made as DLC  is that their design,if too different then the original,made the weapon hard to identify when being attacked by it.  So when it comes to a weapon, it can be tricky to make a weapon that is easily identifiable at a distance but different enough to look appealing . When I make anything I keep the concept  I of the main details the same. For the SOW for instance the blade guard was the most important feature that helps the player identify it as a SOW. I made a new guard ,but kept it curvy and the rest of the weapons I kept the original dimensions. So while it may look different at a distance,in first person is when you will really see that it is not the original .While making a new design is important ,keeping it identifiable is just as. That's why I also made gameplay vids as well so you can see it up close and in action ."

ChivalryGame,37qt6z,ColonelHerro,3,Sat May 30 00:16:07 2015 UTC,"My advice would be to play some free-for-all and team objective, just to see what the game is all about.   When you're ready and keen to learn, go join a classic duels server (not a normal duels one) and, honestly, just ask for help.   A lot of us want to see this game grow, and a level 0 asking for help is exciting - it means that maybe there's going to be a new face in our relatively small community. Odds are someone will give you a hand. If not, bow and duel a few people, have some fun with it - maybe avoid black, gold or pink helms, because they'll be at a whole other level, and it'll be hard to learn why you died.   Just have fun with it, and try and work out what went wrong when you die, and you'll improve with time.   If you're in AU/NZ, I'd be happy to duel with you when I'm on - look for Lord Colonel Axeman."

However being a new player, experiementing for a short time with third person can be beneficial to your development. I played third person during my 20s and 30s and I feel it helped me develop a good sense of footwork and spacing, which is crucial in this game.

ChivalryGame,37q0cj,Oskoff,5,Fri May 29 15:48:49 2015 UTC,Everyone else has wonderful advice and i totally agree with almost all of them. You WILL get absolutely stomped for a good while when your first playing. Just keep at it and dont let it go to your head.
ChivalryGame,37q0cj,Derodyne,5,Fri May 29 15:59:35 2015 UTC,"Don't be afraid to feint, regen stamina (and sometimes health) between fights, use far more stabs and overheads than swings, don't do the same thing over and over, focus on the objectives, learn to melee well even if you want to play archer, don't play low rank servers, the best practice you'll get will be in small team objective servers, small last team standing servers and FFA duel servers."
ChivalryGame,37q0cj,thatguitarist,4,Fri May 29 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Chivalry!   I would recommend playing the game tutorial before you join any actual games. You should also check out this good post by /u/Reithur: http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/37mj57/welcome_new_players_weekly_riposte_classes/crny6vw  I think the biggest thing is leaning how to parry (Right mouse button) and realizing there are 5 distinct attacks:   slash (left mouse button) stab (scroll mousewheel up) overhead (scroll mousewheel down) alternate slash (mouse 4) alternate overhead (mouse 5)   Team damage/killing is a big problem in this game, so try not to slash wildly with LMB when around teammates. It's better to use stab or overhead to avoid hitting teammates to your sides.  Please let us know if you have any questions once you've tested the waters!"

ChivalryGame,37q0cj,tubz,2,Fri May 29 14:47:44 2015 UTC,Eh. I know a couple guys that play with a controller and they are decent but not amazing. The worst thing you can do imo is to try and be a dirty try hard. This game is silly and meant to be silly whilst smashing each other and spamming x9 (laughing) (not sure how to do that on a controller). As for basic movements/fighting you should be fine though.

ChivalryGame,37q0cj,thefranchise23,1 point,Fri May 29 15:35:25 2015 UTC,"on that note, how do you do those fancy spin-to-win sweeps? I can barely make a 180° turn while I'm swinging."
ChivalryGame,37q0cj,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,-1,Fri May 29 18:18:56 2015 UTC,"General rule of thumb is that the higher sensitivity you have the easier it is to do. That said, some weapons you don't need to technically spin around a full 180. You just need to make your weapon move. So mix a spin with an alt swing and look in a particular direction and you'll go full seizure. 3rd person helps too. But good luck doing anything ranged with those settings!"
ChivalryGame,37q0cj,THRlLLH0,2,Fri May 29 18:26:55 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm doing absolutely fine ranged, I'm quite good with spear actually. It's not really that bad with turning around, but I've never used REALLY high mouse sensitivity.  I never play in third person because I can't tell range well with it :/"
ChivalryGame,37q0cj,tubz,1 point,Fri May 29 19:10:53 2015 UTC,"Just stick in third person, and usually work off your teammates with the spear. Don't try to duel with it; it's not the best weapon for duels! And stick to first person, it's much better for judging ranges and play defensive.   Just find a sensitivity and dpi value that works best with you. If it's too fast, just turn it down.   And don't worry about the 180 degree swings and what not, atleast for now. They're frowned upon by a large majority of players."

I started with MKB but switched over 360 controller one night and never turned back.  I went from around .050 K/D ratio to 1.50.  I just ""got it"" once I had a controller in my hand for some reason.  Movement felt more natural and I was no longer thinking about which attack to use - I just did what felt right and it worked.  Some of that is just being more familiar with the game and knowing the controls, but some if it is because the game just ""feels right"" with a controller to me.  Also, I'm not going up against really good players where precise aim is going to make or break you."

ChivalryGame,37myor,SaltyIngredients,8,Thu May 28 23:49:27 2015 UTC,"Okay I'll say it, I don't know why they got rid of the unpopular opinion puffin. I think all memes have their own special place in the meme library, and it's really sad to see this one be banned. This is one of those days on the internet that everyone will rememdber for the rest of their lives. Mark my words. I want you to know that I know what I'm talking about I'm not just some guy. I'm pretty much the number one mem expert in the world. All over the web I'm known as the ""Meme King"". REddit, 9gag, ICanHaz, DailyHaha, all have featured my Memes at one point or another, and all of them would loved by everyone who saw them without a single detractor -- not one. I am probably the most famous Meme maker in the history of Memes. I had a hand in inventing over half a dozen of the memes you see every day. So I'm not just ""some guy"" who just ""loves memes"". I literally eat, breathe, and sleep memes. I think in memes. I talk in memes. I'm the ""Meme King"", that's who I am. What if I told you... I'm the world's number one memer, right?  I'm not surprised you haven't heard of me. I like to keep the company I keep... selective. I'm bombarded with media requests and autograph beggars enough as it is. I'm only coming out on this account because this is so important to me. This is an day that will live in infamy. And the Meme King is not happy about that. More than being the undisputed #1 memer in all of history, I have an IQ of 196. I'm smart enough to see the patterns in every day life, to read the writing on the wall. First Unpopular Opinion Puffin, then who? Confession Bear? Success Kind? Good lord almighty, Scumbag Steve? This is how things begin. It starts off with ""That meme is racist"" and then it ends with ""Do not post memes, citizen. Move along nad be a producer in society."" What a goof. This whole world is just a big goof, and if you had my IQ you'd be able to see that. WEll you can't ignore it now that unpopular opinion puffin has been killed, murdered by those who were supposed to protect her. In the world's of my favorite superhero DeadPool, ""there is not justice in the world."" You know, I don't think there's any subreddit as universally beloved as adviceanimals. Ask anyone, they'll probably say that's their favorite. I know I would, and, heh, as I've mentioned, I'm a genius with great taste in memes. When they undefaulted I knew it was the mods. They're just screwing things up for people who just want to laugh at memes. I've seen the writing on this wall, too. These mods are trying to bring down adviceanimals. I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't working for one of REddits competitors. 9gag? Maybe? I think we'll see the administration posting something about them shortly. About how they secretly infiltrated the world's number one mem palace and slowly chockd the life from it like a bunch of savages. MURDERES. SAVAGES. IMBECILES. I just hate this so much. I'm going to start rallying against the mods in AA. I suggest you all do the same.  Meme King out."
ChivalryGame,37myor,BioshockEndingD00D,9,Thu May 28 22:50:52 2015 UTC,"You moron. I am an internationally recognized research mathematician/math professor. I specialize in geometric analysis problems using elliptic partial differential equation methods. I am the first mathematician in the world who has proven the existence and uniqueness of an isometric immersion of a unit disk into the hyperbolic 3 dimensional space with constant sectional curvature –1 as a negatively curved constant mean curvature surface determined by a holomorphic quadratic differential prescribed on the unit disk in the complex plane. The level I have achieved is too high for you to even imagine. This is what I meant by ""My intelligence level is 10000000000000 times higher than the highest level you can imagine.""."
ChivalryGame,37myor,Killua-,6,Fri May 29 05:05:56 2015 UTC,"In this day and age there are some that believe raw intelligence is not what enables one to create bonafide dank memes, although it certainly helps. These are the ones who subscribe to the belief that a child becomes a memer at the time of conception. They (we) believe that when a holy bond is formed between a man and a woman and her she-eggs are fertilized there is a moment’s chance for a ray of pure, golden cosmic energy to imbue the embryo with the will to meme. The child then grows with the potential to create the most epic and dank memes hidden deep inside their core being. Not every child touched by the universe in this way is destined to become one of the great memers. Not every child can look at a frog and know that its name is Pepe or know when a wild wolf is truly insane. These are further gifts from the high powers of the universe that the child receives as his meme-ing mind develops. A child acquires these skills only if his mind is open to the joy, sadness, pain and comfort that his future memes will provide his fellow man. You see, time is like a circle stretching forwards and backwards from the first great meme all the way to whatever drivel is floating around on the front page. A true dank memer can see the circle of time, or the meme-cycle, in all its aspects and from all angles. He can create chords that join different points in time allowing him to plant the seeds of a great meme in his own mind from the distant future or the forgotten past. This ability is what makes a meme-warrior seem to pull the dankest memes out of thin air. A normal child might see an epic fail video and comment, “lol” but a meme-child is able to scan forwards and backwards in the meme-cycle to search for optimal response which is of course, “ayy lmao”. This circular meme-based memory system is what gives the memer the ultimate power to sway the emotions of the common man. With naught but his future memories the memer can captivate the poor souls who wander the halls of /r/adviceanimals. It is truly something to see a meme-child embrace his powers gifted from on high and reach the stage of utter dankness, that is, to become a Dankened-One. The Dankened-Ones are those who have transcended the meme-cycle and view all meme-time as a singular point. The Dankened-Ones communicate on a wavelength much more powerful than the brains of lower memers can handle. They float in a state of pure ecstasy and suffering as their epic memes both bring tears to their eyes and serve as a hanky to dry their face. With utter impunity the Dankened-One’s rain the dankest most epic memes on the masses through the interconnecting meme-fibers of the internet. They float outside of meme-space where IQ matters not. Not even the most intelligent mathematician would be able to model the trajectory of the Dankened-Ones epic tears as they fall through meme-space for eternity. Only through the blessings of the black science man and the cosmos are we able to process the meme-cycle. For it is not intelligence that makes the memer, but the will to meme itself. Stay dank."

ChivalryGame,37mj57,Reithur,27,Wed Jun 3 19:55:34 2015 UTC,"Some good starting advice for the new folks!  Welcome!  If you haven't already played through it, play the tutorial; it'll get you through the most basic of basics.  Check out Moe Pork and teripper (start here) on Youtube.  Some general tips:  Sometimes it's difficult to tell the teams apart; go into your Customization panel and take a look at the different colours and armour for Agatha (Lion symbol, primarily blue, with white & gold) and Mason (Eagle symbol, primarily red, with black & brown).  When a player is damaged, they get bloodied; Blue can look like red if they're hurt enough, so be careful not to kill your teammates.  You will be killed many times.  Sometimes you will not know how it happened.  This is part of the game and learning how to play.  Try to understand what happened and why it happened.  Look at the ""You were killed by"" box that pops up and at the kill feed in the upper-right corner for more info.  When you're around teammates, use your mousewheel (scroll up/down) for attacks, not the left mouse button (it's called LMB around the Chivalry community).  Use the right mouse button (RMB) to parry incoming attacks.  It's not an automatic parry; you have to time them properly AND look towards the tip of the weapon for a parry to work.  Start off using a Knight with Longsword until you get the hang of the mechanics.  You'll have lots of health, which means you'll survive a bit longer to learn more from each life.  Your attacks are controlled by where you point your mouse cursor; you can speed up or delay attacks by moving the cursor to the left or right or up & down.  This will change the timing on when and where your strikes land.  Use this to try to make the opponent parry too soon or too late.  This is called dragging; you drag your cursor to change the attack.  You will see many players using these techniques to try to trick you into blocking too early or too late.  It is part of how the game was made, so don't get angry for being tricked.    Skilled players (often wearing black or gold helmets) may spin or look down or up before or during an attack to change where and when their strikes will hit you.  Again, this is part of the game, but it will take some practice to learn to avoid getting hit.   In a similar respect, Feinting an attack is also part of the game.  It's most basic use is covered in the tutorial, so don't be surprised or upset if someone uses it against you.  Successfully blocking a feinted attack at the right time is called ""reading feints"" in the community and it takes a lot of practice to learn.  By practice, I mean ""getting smashed in the face after a feint and feeling like an idiot for falling for it.""  Ranks don't give you more health or damage. You don't get upgrades in this game. Ranks only mean time spent in the game and higher ranks have spent more time learning how the game works. You earn some helmets when you reach certain ranks (silver, black, and gold).  You will be killed many times by these players, so be cautious around them; the helmets are like the patterns on a snake to tell you that they're dangerous.   Weapon, helmet or character skins don't provide any bonuses; they are purely cosmetic.   Yes, this is a hack and slash game, but it's more than just spamming the Left Mouse Button slash attacks to win.  Feel free to ask questions in chat (press ""Y"" so everyone can see what you'll say, or ""T"" for just your teammates) or here on reddit.  Hope some of this helps out the new players!  R"

ChivalryGame,37mj57,YourMoneyOrYourLife,10,Thu Jun 4 22:39:16 2015 UTC,Here's something thats not usually said:  don't take this too seriously and don't get mad when you die.  You'll enjoy the game so much better if you're not always trying to win.
ChivalryGame,37mj57,Smegmarager,7,Fri May 29 02:08:19 2015 UTC,"Just bought the game. I had so much fun during the free weekend that I had to be nuts not to. I played pretty much only Vanguard so far, but haven't had much trouble maintaining a positive K/D ratio, probably because of all the other new players? Anyway: really charming game. Combat makes me laugh out loud pretty often (everyone yelling CHAAAAAAAAAAARGE together and randomly laughing/taunting) while being intense as fuck. Why did it take me so long to find this gem?"
ChivalryGame,37mj57,ColonelHerro,2,Mon Jun 1 11:43:58 2015 UTC,"Don't forget to get a hang of the voice lines yourself (z1-9, x1-9) so you can be cheeky"
ChivalryGame,37mj57,arenagamer,2,Mon Jun 1 13:55:58 2015 UTC,And remember you can flip the order of voice commands by pressing z or x twice. You want your taunt spam to be as efficient as possible.
ChivalryGame,37mj57,ColonelHerro,2,Wed Jun 3 07:19:02 2015 UTC,"I thought the same thing when I discovered it randomly from a Warowl video of all places.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1UPePOVe-0  Freakin' happy I did.  I had heard the title but didn't know what this game really was. And you're right; the sound is really top notch and often times laugh out loud hilarious.   I wouldn't get too caught up in the K/D ratio. You'll have good games, but then you'll have that game where you keep telling yourself you'll beat this level 50 and he keeps dominating you. It happens. Its all about having fun."
ChivalryGame,37mj57,Oilystool,4,Mon Jun 1 22:33:26 2015 UTC,"I'll keep it brief, because I think most newbies will just want to get out on the battlefield.    Do the tutorial - it barely skims the surface, but it will help.   Start with longsword knight or greatsword van. They will be easier to learn the basics on.  You will die - gruesomely, brutally and frequently. Just roll with it and have a laugh. You'll get better with time, your first ten levels will be a trial by fire.  If you team kill, apologise, people will for the most part understand. To minimise teamkills, use your mousewheel for stabs and overheads, rather than horizontal slashes.  If you're keen to learn, don't be afraid to ask for help - I've frequently jumped on a duel server with a newbie and showed them some tips (if you're in AU/NZ, look for Lord Colonel Axeman) and overall we have a pretty friendly community."
ChivalryGame,37mj57,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Thu May 28 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"If you decide to play as an archer, accept the fact people will be rude to you and mistreat you because of those fact. Despite the fact less people play archers,compared to knights and Vans and rarely end up at the top o the scoreboard,they are the most hated amongst players.   Expect your own teammates to damage you and interrupt your shooting if they do not approve of where you shoot from . Expect to be kicked for no reasons,simply because the class you play. Expect enemies to disengage from more dangerous targets to try to kill you. Expect servers that restrict how many archers can play. Expect a vote kick if you accidentally kill or even hurt a teammate,even if your intentions are good. Expect players tell you that you have no ability when you kill at a distance. A kill  that requires you to correctly aim and fire your arrow at the right time,taking your targets distance ,speed and  trajectory into consideration. Expect to be hated and mistreated just for that, no matter how fairly and kindly you play."

ChivalryGame,37mj57,Wilkoman,6,Fri May 29 13:15:51 2015 UTC,"Also, don't stand near walls because teammates will kick you off for being a scumbag (the autosnipers of Chivalry), don't shoot at 2 people dueling unless you are confident that you can hit the enemy, don't sit in spawn and shoot or sit in doorways, don't stand still while shooting,  and please for the love of god counter the other archers as a priority."
ChivalryGame,37mj57,Oilystool,1 point,Fri May 29 16:17:57 2015 UTC,Why is standing near a wall being a scumbag?
ChivalryGame,37mj57,Wilkoman,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:26:46 2015 UTC,Why are archers so hated?
ChivalryGame,37mj57,mobinstime,1 point,Wed Jun 3 09:24:52 2015 UTC,"A good question. They are not the most played class in the game. They rarely appear on the top of the leader boards. I think it's the random possibility of death this class can deliver . I think a lot of players like to think their swordsmanship and use of game mechanics equates to wether they win or lose a fight. An archer can bypass that with a shot from their bow. So it's the lack on control there is when being shot by an archer. When people die to an archer, they yell noob, but the class takes it's own set of skill. There's aim,which means taking the targets speed,distance and direction into account. So you really have to know your weapon to kill effectively at distances. The good archers will pick off the lazy who run from A to B in a straight line,experienced players will zig zag making them hard to hit. Sometimes archers accidently will hit their teammates, which often will bring on a vote kick by some butt hurt recipient. In a nutshell ,death at a distance.  I would also say the efficiency of their melter class is something  many players hate. Quick wielding ,experienced archers are a bitch to kill."
ChivalryGame,37mj57,BrokeMike,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:27:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining.   Although it seems obvious now you say it, it only appears to me now that archers are basically the BF snipers of the game and are vilified for the same reasons.   Being a sniper was one of my favourite things in BF, requiring as you say a different skill set and play style. It took a LONG time to become even slightly effective.   Playing it like the BF sniper will likely provide a similar experience.  I appreciate your username btw."
ChivalryGame,37mj57,mobinstime,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"The other thing is when there are tons of archers defending on a map with lots of protected places to shoot from it makes the game extremely irritating and unfun for the other team. Basically they get constantly shot with arrows by players they can't even reach in order to fight back. Having lots of archers on offense or on defense on maps without protected places to shoot down from isn't as bad because the other team can just switch to good archer killing setups like zweihander or shield knight/maa.  The reason why your teammates might get mad at you for playing archer is because archers on offense tend to stay back and not do the objectives, just getting kills, so sometimes an offensive team will lose because they had too many archers, meaning their melee was always outnumbered at the objective.  The class of course requires as much skill as any other and I'm not saying it's ok to bitch in chat, tk, or votekick someone just for playing the game, those are just the reasons why archers tend to annoy people more than the melee classes."
ChivalryGame,37mj57,Gnarlyfoodman,2,Wed Jun 3 17:39:14 2015 UTC,so I just bought the game. I like it. But i feel like I'm so bad sometimes.
ChivalryGame,37mj57,arhythm,3,Mon Jun 1 04:16:26 2015 UTC,Everyone is bad at first. In this game a person's skill level tends to correlate more closely with their hours played than in a lot of other games because no one has played a game with very similar combat mechanics before.
ChivalryGame,37mj57,arhythm,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"The game has a difficult skill curve. Some other people talked about this in this thread, so feel free to read through stuff like Reithur's write up. Otherwise, just have fun :D"
ChivalryGame,37mj57,AnbuSai,2,Mon Jun 1 13:11:23 2015 UTC,"A few fun tips for new players who want to try out being an archer!  1) Most servers have friendly fire on, although it's not full damage  2) Take 1) into consideration when firing! If it's an iffy shot on a 1v1, its not a bad gamble, as if you hit the enemy it helps your team more than if you hit your teammate. If it's a 2v1 against your teammate, its better odds and a worthwhile shot to take.  3) Opposite to number 2)! If you have three guys on one enemy, don't take the shot! You're far more likely to hit a teammate, and it's very unlikely the enemy is going to survive a 3v1.  4) Even if they aren't blocking, an arrow or bolt to a shield (unless from heavy xbow) won't penetrate, so also take that into consideration. For this reason, being on the left side of your opponent's line of attack is helpful (their right side) as they lose most of the protection from simply having a shield."
ChivalryGame,37mj57,Derodyne,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:08:21 2015 UTC,Maybe put in post about subreddit TS? When I get home and on I'll be going there and trying to get others as well.

ChivalryGame,37mj57,BayouBoogie,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:39:38 2015 UTC,"It's really not unbalanced, it's a result of the real time swing mechanics. It's intended and was developed off of the original mod, it's not a glitch or anything. The best way to counter it is to parry at the very last second if you can, look for hints in the direction the body is facing. Most players don't do it perfectly well so it's fairly easy to see it coming. Kinda similar to fainting. It also is mentioned in the tutorial I believe. Furthermore, the tutorial isn't very in depth at all. Don't trust it much. It just is part of the skill curve of the game to adjust to it, it can make the game a bit more complex and a lot more fun!"
ChivalryGame,37mj57,bltrocker,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:30:57 2015 UTC,"Complex sure, but I am not having fun fighting against an opponent where I have no chance of winning against him. Challenge is one thing, but slamming your head against a brick wall in hopes of breaking it down is another."

ChivalryGame,37mprd,slapyourownbutt,4,Thu May 28 19:32:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe you aren't playing the class to its strengths. For what the MAA is designed to do, it is quite good, very good, especially with that damn annoying dodge that makes my fat knight ass waste time."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,slapyourownbutt,1 point,Thu May 28 19:36:44 2015 UTC,"Im a pretty good Maa. Im saying people dont realize how weak it really is. A dodge spamming maa who has no skills at all can easily kill people, and in your case, waste your time. But that shit doesnt fly in competitive team game. Even then most maa dodge spammers are easy to predict and kill. Maas dont do much damage, and they have less reach so you have to aim more precisely, which both make stam managment more critical to your survival. Ie. You not only have to hit them more, which is more stam to consume, but also you have to land those hits and each one missed costs even more stam. Plus everything under the sun 1-2 shots Maas."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,Chuckdatass,4,Thu May 28 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"To my knowledge, dodge spamming maas have always been effective in pubs and comp games. If you are an maa then you can 2 shot knights and you can be 5 times harder to kill than any other class if you dodge out of parries. Yes, you have less range but you do have faster foot speed which increases your range in a way.  This is coming from an maa main, though some people think I play more like a knight."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,Chuckdatass,1 point,Thu May 28 20:11:27 2015 UTC,"I never see dodge spamming in Pubs or Comp do a MAA any good. By the time theyve killed someone theyre usually stammed out. Dodge spamming kills your stamina. Also to saying maas can 2shot knights, its only with a specific few weapons. With two overheads directly to the head."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,Chuckdatass,3,Thu May 28 20:13:59 2015 UTC,I don't know what you're talking about with comp to be honest. Top-tier teams have had dodge-spamming maas before and they have been effective.
ChivalryGame,37mprd,Chuckdatass,1 point,Thu May 28 20:16:04 2015 UTC,"I dont know what you're talking about either. The few instances ive seen maas dodge spam, even with top tier teams, they werent particulary effective. Atleast no more than any one else on their team. I almost never see that in comp anymore anyways, however its pretty prevelant in duels; and effective because 1v1."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,Nothox,1 point,Thu May 28 20:19:04 2015 UTC,"Althought dodge spamming I guess in certain situations during a scrim would work because dodge out of parry. But not all the time, and it looks trashy to be honest. But do you not agree removing dodge and maybe increasing foot speed would level it out?"
ChivalryGame,37mprd,XXLpeanuts,2,Thu May 28 20:24:56 2015 UTC,MAA can 2 shot a knight. And you should see chrisomatic in action and say this again. I have by far the fewest hours in pubs as a MAA and I can go 40-15 without much trouble using flanged mace. If I used a sword it'd be even easy just stab feinting everyone. Plus the side dodge to get free hits on pubbers  is too EZ.
ChivalryGame,37mprd,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Thu May 28 19:59:52 2015 UTC,"In pubs is a different situation. In pubs and duels (especially in vanilla) you can spam feints and dodge to your hearts content and rack up plenty of kills. Even then you're going to run out of stam often, and a stammed out maa is a dead maa. The only thing about maa that is mildly overpowered is dodge, i have to give that to you chuck. I wish they would just remove it and slightly increase foot speed, or something that would be useful but not too overboard. I never dodge personally unless its dire, its a waste of stam imo."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,S_murph,3,Thu May 28 20:08:20 2015 UTC,"Combo feint to parry wastes more stam. If a MAA only side dodges and uses superior footspeed, it is often the knight who will run out of stam first."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,ia_Flame,1 point,Thu May 28 20:25:33 2015 UTC,"Cftp is the reason i dont combo against maa, i riposte stabs or lookdown overheads and it almost always hits even if they dodge. I can track maas when they side dodge me so its no problem. A pubbie in my shoes would be a different story, but still."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,highboarder727,2,Thu May 28 20:28:53 2015 UTC,If you wiff an attack you better believe you cftp if you don't feel like eating a hit. And don't tell me you never wiff. Also you can't riposte a good MAA. It just does not work. They will dodge and punish.
ChivalryGame,37mprd,highboarder727,-1,Thu May 28 21:05:58 2015 UTC,"Ive never had problems riposting against maa. Ls is long enough and fast enough that even if they dodge out of parry, a stab or lookdown riposte always hits for me really. Ive never had an issue. And yes of course i wiff, no ones perfect even with a easily aimed weapon like ls. But i dont do it very often, and unless its paramount that i cant take a hit, i usually just take it. I play extremely patient and defensive when it comes to maa and i never have issues honestly. I play maa often tho as well so maybe that has some factor idk."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,SaltyIngredients,0,Thu May 28 21:19:16 2015 UTC,"If this is true. You aren't fighting top level opponents. I'm not hating since I can beat normal MAAs with such tactics. But the top 10 MAA'S in the game won't be fooled by this. And since those are the ones I am familiar with, they are where I hold the class abilities to."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,highboarder727,1 point,Thu May 28 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"I dont know who you consider top level maa. Im not saying I never lose to people like Mystik (when he wasnt playing ESO 24/7), Massi, Kwazi when he played, Jimmy when he played, Loin, Fraylor when he played, and others. I dont win or lose to them more than one or the other, I would say i can reliably beat them but its definitely one hell of a fight and theyre more than capable of beating me too. Its not overwhelmingly difficult to beat them, even tho theyre all damn good maas. Theyre better than me of course, but they arent overpowered just because they have the capability to whoop the shit out of me you know? I joined the comp scene in 2013 and ive never had a maa that i truly couldnt handle. That were truly overpowered. Well, except when they could dodge out of parry AND attack during dodge. That was some bullshit."

ChivalryGame,37mprd,highboarder727,2,Thu May 28 19:51:17 2015 UTC,"im guessing youre being sarcastic. a good maa is overpowered, just like a good knight/vanguard/archer is overpowered. maa in itself isnt. but get a real good maa on your comp team and he can make it look very overpowered."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,SaltyIngredients,2,Thu May 28 19:58:35 2015 UTC,"I play a hell of a lot of maa across over 800 hours and I personally opt never to use the dodge, literally I have disabled the ability, its simply a load of bullshit and ruins the gameplay imo. This is from someone who plays maa the most (and knight quite a bit too so i know both sides). It is over powered because noobs can avoid all attacks pretty much for ever, and its also really fun destroying to use dodge. I have far more fun raping plebs with the staff and no dodge. Far more satisfying ducking out of the way of an attack than using dodge."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,BioshockEndingD00D,1 point,Fri May 29 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"Noobs cant avoid all attacks with dodge and not forever, a long enough weapon, like van weapons, aren't avoidable with dodge. It also consumes a boatload of stam when you dodge continuously, add in the factor that youre using stam to swing, block, it wont last long. I dont dodge either, and i also play knight, i kinda like saying I main both. I have a lot more hours as knight but probably a good 500-600 as maa. And i dont play one more than the other right now."
ChivalryGame,37mprd,BioshockEndingD00D,1 point,Fri May 29 11:47:12 2015 UTC,"Yea this is true but i find those long vanguard weapons extremely boring to use so I never do. Its even more noticable in duels, i simply wont bother dueling a dodging maa properly, just either wait for them to make a fool of themselves and run out of stamina or let them kill me so i can get onto someone who actually wants to fight."

I remember not too long ago a streamer and his friends were kicking the only high ranks in a game server so we got a bunch of gold helms together and kicked his ass lol.   Anyways it's really annoying and immature of people to do this as everyone here just wants to sit back and enjoy the game. It's not cool to kick somebody just because they are better. I'd attribute this mentality in noobs due to their lack of knowledge in the game because of the awful tutorials.

New players taking over official servers and playing God, deciding who they want to play against. Perhaps a little melodramatic, but worth keeping an eye on."

ChivalryGame,37isg4,Sir_Bling,2,Thu May 28 01:02:13 2015 UTC,I've had new players try to kick me on my own server.
ChivalryGame,37isg4,gentlemandinosaur,3,Thu May 28 14:03:50 2015 UTC,This happened to me at least 10 times this week lol  it sucks because I have a hard time finding a server to play on with decent ping.   Sometimes I get kicked from the ONLY server near me and I have to just come back a few hours later when they are gone. Either that or I play on the 100p server with my 200 ping ;-;
ChivalryGame,37isg4,HELPMEIMGONADIE,6,Fri May 29 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"But, Bling... how? You are not actually good.   D:"

ChivalryGame,37isg4,Perpetualinvalidity,2,Thu May 28 03:48:17 2015 UTC,"I sometimes get kicked because of what I say in the chat (vote still usually uncalled for, like calling out someone's 200 ping etc.), but rarely if I'm just tryharding.   Every time I see a noob successfully votekick another player because they were better, I start focusing them until they leave. Maul spinning and Norse sword works wonders on those crybabies. Fortunately most of the time this is only a thing in FFA.  Also that's a reason to have a smurf account. Just go back as another player and fuck em up.  If you get kicked only because you are rank 43 (Chivalry's ""middle class"" nowadays, not even high) they really must have some kind of a circlejerk going on."

ChivalryGame,37eezw,Reithur,2,Wed May 27 02:42:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Plus, you've farmed enough pubs to retire to your pink helmet ;)  Psst, update yer flair!"
ChivalryGame,37eezw,YourMoneyOrYourLife,2,Wed May 27 13:58:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the popularization of classic duels was what really killed the meta.  It taught every level 30 and 40 who was trying to learn the game to play like that.  Without classic duels, there wouldn't be an environment for people to pickup these styles of fighting, although less crappy animations/mechanics would make it so these fighting styles aren't possible or effective."
ChivalryGame,37eezw,Nohlium,2,Wed May 27 02:19:21 2015 UTC,It also has something to do with the comp scene shrinking/ moving to MERC. Its a playstyle that's fun but not very good in competitive environment.
ChivalryGame,37eezw,YourMoneyOrYourLife,2,Wed May 27 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"Eh I find this playstyle somewhat unbalanced, or at least very unfun to fight against.  Thats my main gripe.  And, IIRC, this playstyle became more common before mercs was a thing and its what drove some comp players to leave.  Or at least the hit trades did."
ChivalryGame,37eezw,Nohlium,6,Wed May 27 04:02:07 2015 UTC,"Yea its unbalance. Forcing desyncs and using broken animation. The style was popularize by people who didn't like the feinting mechanic. The gap between casual and pro became too steep at one point and instead of trying harder, the casual made their own playstyle."
ChivalryGame,37eezw,BioshockEndingD00D,2,Wed May 27 11:22:51 2015 UTC,This is why I just go maul on vanilla. It's hilarious watching them run away trying to save their stam after missing 3 times in one combo.

I hope Slasher finds a way to make combat have a high skill ceiling without all the foolishness and ballerina plays.
ChivalryGame,37eezw,goatsedotcx,-3,Wed May 27 21:38:39 2015 UTC,I really fucking hate this shit. YOU are a cancer.
ChivalryGame,37eezw,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,3,Thu May 28 20:24:08 2015 UTC,How so? Because I'm complaining about people crutching on a broken mechanic? How dare I.
ChivalryGame,37eezw,goatsedotcx,-2,Wed May 27 06:23:46 2015 UTC,"Because you're acting like the way you play same game I play is the ""right"" way to play, and attribute my style of play to being bullshit and even a reason people leave the game.

ChivalryGame,37eezw,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Wed May 27 06:35:10 2015 UTC,"It's unintended and broken. And did you not see the askreddit thread of people complaining about Chivalry and the so called ""ballerinas?"" Many attribute to quitting the game because of it. There's a problem when tons of people assume a so called mechanic is actually glitch. There's also no hiding the fact that intentional backswings and reverses are not supposed to be in the game and totally break animations. There's a reason why Deadliest Warrior, Slasher, and Mercs have all attempted to remove or minimalize backswings as much as possible."
ChivalryGame,37eezw,goatsedotcx,-5,Wed May 27 06:38:58 2015 UTC,"That askreddit thread was intentionally skewed by that troll account to circlejerk that way and you know it, to say otherwise is just being willfully ignorant.   mechanic is actually glitch   It's the same thing as bhopping. And with bhopping, there were devs and people who thought it was ""wrong"" and tried to remove it from their games, but bhopping is a result of inherent factors in the engine, just like using real time strike animations. And everyone keeps throwing around ""breaking animations"", do any of you realize that this is wrong to say? The animation isn't broken, ever. Unless you change the timings in your game files, and that's cheating (there are a few ""good"" players in this game who are known to actually do this shit, fucking retarded.) A better word would be corner case manipulation of the real time strikes. Want to know what's actually broken? Shield feints, which are not at all meant to be in the game, and are abused often in high level play, as I'm sure you're aware.  And while I'm at it I'll throw in the case of using feints at pings higher than 70 or 80; feints become unbalanced when ping increases, and yet nobody seems to care? At least not the oh so knowledgeable high level comp players, it seems.   This subreddit is a fucking breeding ground for elitist high levels who think they know what's ""right"" in the game."
ChivalryGame,37eezw,tyrellLtd,6,Wed May 27 06:56:14 2015 UTC,"The animation isn't broken, ever.   Lol. You seem to never have played on a full server in a poorly optimized map with a 50 ms ping differential and received attacks from dank spinners. The main reason these type of attacks are said to be broken is because the animations are not fluid enough for the engine/netcode to handle, even at 62 constant fps.   Just look at the weapon model and the position of the wielder's shoulders/arms. It's stuttery as fuck so it's hard to parry them. Plus, your reactions must be even faster because the effective windup is so easily masked. Even at the max default FoV (120 degrees) it's hard to know what's going on with the other guys' model. So, yeah, they are broken (fortunately, Slasher will have those lovely trace effects which allow for easier reads on an attack's trajectory because your eyes can actually follow an object that frame after frame produces a sensible trail. Something that Chivalry utterly sucks at)  Plus, the style relies heavily on keeping the initiative through spamming, gambling and trading, making it ridiculous. Try doing this same shit with a SoW or a Longsword or any other weapon that doesn't 2-3 shot as easily as the messer and you'd notice how much these players rely on heavy dmg weps. Also look at how vulnerable that Stranger guy is at 5:40 when he does a series of spins and receives lookdown OH ripostes.   If only kicks were actually reliable, these techniques could be easily dealt with, but 1 in 4 kicks will miss the target for no reason (specially when the opponent begins spamming) so it's harder to regain your initiative.    the rest of that boo-hoo why does nobody complaint about other exploits   Great thinking. You should know people have complained a great deal about those ""shield feints"" and several other related ""exploits"". At any rate, it's poor thinking."
ChivalryGame,37eezw,goatsedotcx,-1,Wed May 27 19:07:31 2015 UTC,"because the animations are not fluid enough for the engine/netcode to handle, even at 62 constant fps.   Uh, after playing the game for hundreds of hours, which you and I I'm assuming have both played, you have a firm grasp of the start and end timings of every attack, no? If that's the case, watching or fighting in a duel is more of a science of mind games, and not struggling to deal with drags. If you can't block a rainbow it's not my fault you didn't see it coming, because you have an understanding of when the hit tracers start and end. It's similar to a feint in regards to ""seeing it coming"". I refuse to believe that you aren't able to understand the animations of each attack. How the hell is that my fault that I hit you because I moved my mouse more this way and that way instead of just holding it still and turning it into a battle of stamina drain and feint spam?   Plus, the style relies heavily on keeping the initiative through spamming, gambling and trading, making it ridiculous.    This bothers me so much. It totally assumes I don't know what I'm doing with each subsequent attack in a flurry. A good defense is a offense in chivalry. If I put out a volume of attacks for you to deal with I have a sort of ""control"" of the fight, so it shouldn't be considered spamming. Spamming is that new player ""I'm going to keep stabbing him because he's bound to miss one or two!"" mentality. I've started a paper sort of thing, it's at about 3 pages right now, that goes into depth regarding my position on the defense of what you and others call ""spamming, gambling and trading"", I'll finish it soon and I'll be sure to notify you, so please don't take my lack proper response to this assertion inability or unwillingness.    If only kicks were actually reliable   Yeah, I agree. I think the fact that half my kicks don't land speaks towards the larger issues in the game, of just general laggyness and inconsistency in the game. It sucks because it's the best way to halt their combo and create space, the reason it's in the game, just doesn't work.  And calling logical fallacies? Really? Watch, I can do that too! Ta-da!"
ChivalryGame,37eezw,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Thu May 28 06:38:03 2015 UTC,"Keep denying what is true.

Also your earlier argument about feints being unbalanced with ping can be far more heavily applied to reverses as they can be manipulated to hit in the first frame of release phase."
ChivalryGame,37eezw,goatsedotcx,-2,Wed May 27 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"Shield feints may be cheesy as fuck, particularly in duels, but to compare them to turning your character model into an armed roundabout is absurd   LOL. I'm done. ""Cheesy as fuck"", how about a broken game animation? I hate to bring this up, but I literally attend school for 3D animation, and let me fucking tell you, that shit is a flat out glitch in the game. When I do a 180 lmb dragged slow, does the animation fail to go from start to finish? Nope. When someone shield feints, does the animation become interrupted in any way? Yup. You're just flat out incorrect.    they can be manipulated to hit in the first frame of release phase   I agree. Alt lmb accels start too fast, they're too fast to react to with high ping. I agree that it needs to be fixed.   Also why is everyone suddenly unable to use kicks and space their opponents better? It's the best way to destroy players who matrix often."

ChivalryGame,379vab,CRUSHED1337,23,Tue May 26 01:27:09 2015 UTC,"""look atchu man"" ""all u do is gamble"" ""u think dzis game means anything man?"" ""play a real skill game like csgo""  CRUSHED demonstrates why yurop > amerifat Knights.  He has top-level dueling skills. However, he also has top-level awareness and teamplay and game sense. The stupidly high fish-eyes FOV really shows how helpful it is in this video.  In the clutch 1v2 and 1v3 scenarios, you can see him constantly positioning and lining his enemies behind one another so that he can effectively 1v1 + 1v1 them like in a Bruce Lee movie. When he does get concaved, he tries his best to get out of the concave instead of just standing still and trying to parry and feint read everything (impossible and, even if you do, you run out of stamina and die). He doesn't take stupid risks until he has to, which are during those 1v2 and 1v3 scenarios. Even so, his ""risks"" cover lots of enemy's options. For instance, riposting overhead and turning 180 to cover the enemy who's trying to backstab, so he forces either a parry from that player or that player takes a Zwei to the face (since this is a montage video, CRUSHED shows when such a riposte pwns the enemy).  CRUSHED demonstrates extremely good game sense and battlefield awareness with his effortless target switches. He knows when his ""main target"" will be too primed and parry his efforts, so he ripostes and combos onto the enemy teammates instead. He keeps both the Vanguard in front of him and the MAA behind him in check by riposting and having them both guess which target he's going for, sometimes they gamble or don't even see the subtle animation and get Zwei'd. CRUSHED knows how to engage the fights. He doesn't just YOLO in 1v3 like it's a pug and then die, then ask his teammates in Ventrilo ""where r u guys"".  CRUSHED made epic Sophax video that was too controversial and got taken down.  Amurifats have plenty of pretty strong Knight duelists. Almost all of them lack at least one aspect though: game sense, teamwork, or awareness.  This was a big problem with Nemesis. Despite teripper saying that we go inert in duels or some shit like that, it was the exact opposite lol. We engaged pretty horribly and awfully a lot of the time, trying to force duels no matter what class we were. We mainly relied on just outskilling people and letting Beast and Infernal carry us with their HP bar lol, but that didn't always work against Tempest and Faucheur. Infernal and Beast had huge synergy issues. Beast + Sensay and Infernal + Sensay worked better. Hell, even having Palaceer on Knight in a way was better. Palaceer made good calls a lot of the times, so in a sense he had better in-game leading than Infernal and Beast. However, Infernal and Beast were just so much better at actually fighting as Knights that we still had them play that class. We weren't very consistent either, and the immense ping differences didn't help at all in that aspect.  I still see Knights neglecting that skill. It doesn't matter if you can beat Omega, Spook, Tyrant, Infernal, Beast, RAW BONER in 1v1 half the time. I've had some rather notably good duels myself."

I noticed that the really good players never let me get in a position where I can do my yolo bockswing mix ups. The bad ones and brainless ones just facehug me and thise can be really random, I can yolo reverse ls lmb them in that case. Wizardish only knew how to facehug quad feint, so my reverse lmb mixups were quite the match for him even when I did not feint at all lmao.

If I'm swinging my sword towards a guy I'll try to use my body too in order to give more thrust/swing faster. Obviously in chivalry it doesn't LOOK natural due to the animations, but it's realistic. Even drags that are used to delay the attack, it is an uncommon, yet valid combat strategy: if I charge you from the right and start swinging I can suddenly spin myself and hit you from the left/delay the attack. Think of what you'd do in a street fight. It's all about moving your body.  Also chivalry is not that realistic in general."

ChivalryGame,37add3,Dustin-,1 point,Tue May 26 21:22:05 2015 UTC,I was once in a game with 2 purple helmets. I want to say one of them was either level 70 or damn close to it. And they were playing together. So basically any team they were on were stacked in their favor.
ChivalryGame,37add3,spaceecake,1 point,Fri May 29 18:40:11 2015 UTC,"The highest rank currently in chivalry is about rank 65 and there's only one guy like that. However even if you have two level 50's on one team it's going to be stacked. The reason why level 70 is nearly impossible is because the ranking curve is exponential, you would need almost a milion kills to get to 70."

Level 46 is quite a high rank and if you've played for more then 500 hours it perfectly possible to reach 40+. However the ranksystem is exponential meaning that the further you get thevmore ridiculous the amount of kills get before you rank up.

ChivalryGame,378jd9,Charles_K,16,Mon May 25 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"Knight is the tank. People in this game don't know how to tank. Tanking isn't just being in the frontline. It's learning how to disengage enemies from your weaker classes, learning how to initiate without getting concaved, learning when NOT to engage, etc. You are basically leading the team. A Knight who doesn't talk or just bitches and complains in Teamspeak is pathetic and dragging his team down. A Knight who takes initiative and command and is confident in his playmaking skills inspires his teammates and does work. Knight is the ""initiator"" in Dota, the ""tank"" in LoL, the ""Warrior"" in HotS, the Zealot of Protoss, the Ultralisk of Zerg.  Knight probably requires the most consistency to play. If your parries, feint calling/reading, and defense overall are not on point, you will die fast and your team will be down a man. You're not really looking for duels as a Knight, you're basically a lineback. So long as they are on you and not on your teammates, you're gold unless you're lit, then sometimes you may awkwardly have to swap places with a Van or something.  Contrary to what a lot of Vans think, Knights require very good positioning, especially in Mercs mod. Go in too deep and you have people bitch ""waaah when I play, people just flinch me I can't even get off a swing."" If you're ill positioned, your entire team loses the fight and the Teamspeak just becomes nonstop bitching about who did what wrong because when you engage wrong, your whole team will engage wrong too.  Knights require brains to play and lead a team and, funny enough, the class tends to attract just the exact opposite of that. Actually, that's a silly statement to make. ANY class requires brains to play.  Best Knight is the BO$$MAN.    Vanguard is support, obviously enough. Glass cannon, can dish out the hits but can't take them, range complements Knights very well, etc. Vanguard also makes a decent flanking class when you got something like Zwei, basically act like a mobile and sneaky Maul Knight (Guts).  Pretty good at dueling MAA, especially with certain weapons. Dueling Knights is very weapon dependent though, you should beat blunt weapons with ease but Sword of War is very difficult.  Smoke Pots are useful in forcing bad engagements or having the enemy wait for it to dissipate when you use it in chokepoints. I haven't seen anyone except myself use it in such a way, and it honestly did big things for Nemesis during our first tournament. With smoke wall, they have to blindly walk through smoke and possibly risk getting poked by a spear or bashed by a Maul they didn't see coming, and their archer has to go around or walk through the smoke himself (which may be impossible). Meanwhile, our archer has clear view and our melee can engage on semi-blind opponents. That, or wait 15 seconds for smoke to clear, a huge waste of time.  Definitely has the most viable weapons. Spear and brandi very stronk support weapons, also good enough in 1v1s too especially Live Spear with broken LMB. Polehammer very stronk mini-maul, but suffers in 1v1 because it has very meh feints. Zwei is a more flexible version of Polehammer with its reach and draggability, but less consistent in two-shotting Knights (but can yolo-neshot MAA and make them cry in forums or Teamspeak).  Hm tough call but I'd say the best Palaceer in North America is maybe Palaceer cause he uses 150% of mechanics and doesn't afraid of anything, Yarnu, HEXEN, Tyrant, Spook, those guys are nothing compared to Vanguard. Read every feint en montage, and most toxic clan NA.    MAA is the most OP class, then any other class. Who's this poppycock scrublord master general calling out keyes? You do know phoenix has some of the best maa's in the game right? Duel me anytime. I won't feint or dodge and your head WILL roll. What will your excuse be then?  MAA. 1v1. Dodge-in-parry.  Firepot.  Oh shit, MAA is having trouble 1v1ing in teamfight! Either contest their MAA, or poke their MVPs if their MAA is dead or a non-threat. Don't YOLO in if there's a Van to your side, when you engage you have to be sure that there's no random ass Messer or Zwei LMB that will blindside you. Otherwise, you gonna get ""wow one-shot broken stupid game imbalanced weapon"" in TBS Forums.  If the enemy spends time dueling or 2v1'ing you during a teamfight, good. You are doing your job. You're a time waster rather than a tank. You use shit like dodge-in-parry to grab the enemy's attention indefinitely while your team mops the rest of their team. If you keep finding yourself dying but you're engaging in these long ass duels and 2v1's, that means your team, if equally skilled, will be rek'ing the rest of their team in the meantime. Good job, you did what you're supposed to do: isolate and duel or skirmish and hold out as long as possible.  ""But truck, when I want to duel and isolate, they're all together and not able to be picked off. Then, when I go in, they always deathball me and 1-shot me when I want to fight. MAA is underpowered!""  Your Knights and grenades need to split and engage the enemy in a way to force those awkward positions on them. Fighting the enemy on their terms (aka clumped on a chokepoint in a hurricane of Zweis) means you're obviously going to die. You could also, you know, off-class.  IMO, I think the most optimal thing MAA can do is learn a secondary class. Some objectives, I think it's just straight up better to have that extra Knight or Vanguard (e.g. the tunnel of love in Darkforest obj 2). Meanwhile, a single MAA clearly shines and does a ton of work on Stoneshill and on Darkforest last objective and stuff, basically wherever it's open and wherever you can threaten backdooring/ninja. MAAs are always bitching about how so-and-so class is cheap in cramped places and stuff. Okay, why not just play that cheap class in those situations? You lose dodge-in-parry, you may have to feint read and parry a bit, but oh shit you have access to OP weapons and can fight comfortably in an actual team brawl rather than duels! No shame in off-classing, Scout does it a shitton in Team Fortress 2: off-class into Sniper, Spy, Pyro, Heavy, Engineer, whatever.  Which brings me to my next point: Shield MAA. Agatha MAA should always use shield during sluice gate. Super hard pressure on Mason archer and incredible for surviving. Sometimes, the main thing you want to do is just SURVIVE on the sluice gate while teammates respawn. Shield + Dodge lets you do that magnificently. Shield MAA is incredible in stalling 1v1s and stopping that gate from going up in super clutch situations. Plus, it is incredibly hard to kill a shield MAA as an archer. Stop using Firepots on defense, you just toss that shit once and then you have nothing until you die and respawn. You dying may just be enough for the Masons to capture that sluice gate.  Best MAA in North America, I'd say probably Sir Loin of Beef."

ChivalryGame,378jd9,bi11y10,9,Wed May 27 23:05:21 2015 UTC,"Some of you might call us pussies, but vanguards are the true dominant master race. A vanguard requires a degree of vision and brain much higher than that of a dumb caveman knight or a scumbag man at arsm. Vanguards have the mobility and wide range of powerful and diverse weaponry to attack flanks and holes aggressively and can potentially single handedly win whole engagements. But they can also sit back and support their knights, forcing 2v1 engagements and clean up. This diversity makes vanguards extremely powerful and allows a high skill ceiling.  However vanguards are also weak as hell at the same time. Vanguards are archer magnets and can be countered quite easily by a sword knight or another spear guard. Any vanguard can tell you that's it's not fun getting one shot by a Warbow or light crossbow or getting hit by a throwing axe and then hit by a SoW and dying. Vanguards are also not that great in duels due to getting buttfucked by knight swords and low health. Honestly in vanilla a vanguard is just a weaker knight because of these reasons. Mercs mod helps indirectly buff them by nerfing projectiles and ranged weapon damage, which actually makes them effective because they don't die everytime before the battle even begins. Due to their relative squishiness but high damage potential, they're a sort of a difficult class to play.  Some people say all I do is hide behind my knights and poke people and am afraid to duel, however the vanguard thrives with his team, supporting knights, flanking, and attacking holes. There's not very many vans who can actually do all of this consistently and effectively, but when they do, they can change games. Vanguards have massive, unhidden potential that most have never realized.  I mean this is dumb caveman b0ckswing hitrade meta anyways. Do you like it? Isn't it fun?"
ChivalryGame,378jd9,TobiwanK3nobi,6,Mon May 25 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"+1 yay Vanguard.   I don't see how people saying ""all you do is hide behind your knights"" is an insult, that is literally our job.  And dear God that clip gave me cancer."
ChivalryGame,378jd9,BioshockEndingD00D,6,Mon May 25 23:15:53 2015 UTC,"Vaguard hard die al the tiem. :c  But srsly I've been dissatisfied with the balance and role of vans ever since sprint/kiting mechanics were changed in the infamous Joonpatch(sprint lockout or some shit like that - DerFurst explained it to me one time). We used to be able to kite really well, but not so much now.  I've always felt like vans needed to be roled to be even more aggressively gifted; higher forward sprint speed and acceleration than all other classes, with slow strafe and backpedal speeds. Something more to make up for being pretty much the easiest class to dispatch(archers in melee notwithstanding). Charge attack should have been this something, but nigga please...  My idea for charge attack is that it should be an ubersprint mode that drains stamina quickly and boosts foward sprint speed considerably while limiting turn speed a lot. No attack component involved - let the van retain normal control of his attacks. Just a charge mode."

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

ChivalryGame,372w00,Mestarrr,1 point,Sun May 24 13:42:37 2015 UTC,"I brought it up with my ISP yesterday and they set up a ""bridge connection"" for my computer. Apparently it gives better pings somehow?   But lo and behold, it didn't do shit."
ChivalryGame,372w00,Mestarrr,2,Mon May 25 09:04:54 2015 UTC,Yeah they usually don't know anything and blame everything but their shit infrastructure.
ChivalryGame,372w00,Monstayh,2,Mon May 25 10:08:37 2015 UTC,"500 ping spikes 80% packet loss masterrace reporting in.  It's not just the ISP I fear, line infrastructure is just shit. Anvia is a bit better but not by much. Neither are gonna do anything about it."
ChivalryGame,372w00,Stroggr,2,Sun May 24 16:07:50 2015 UTC,"You are talking about speed, but you actually mean bandwidth. Increasing your bandwidth doesn't mean that those bits inside the wire are moving any faster than they used to. Therefore moving from 24 Mbps connection to 350 Mbps connection doesn't mean lower pings; you just get more ""stuff"" at once.  Make sure that it is not your equipment causing the extra latency. Don't use WiFi(!) or cheap switches between your computer and the wall. Also, select servers near to you (should be obvious). If nothing helps, pity, but I wouldn't say 80 is that bad.  Oh, and 100/10 is far from ""best you can get in Finland""."
ChivalryGame,372w00,robikz,3,Sun May 24 16:06:40 2015 UTC,80 is really bad in Chivalry. The fastest weapons hit you almost immediately when the attack animation starts and combos get out of sync.
ChivalryGame,370iq3,HELPMEIMGONADIE,9,Sat May 23 18:56:19 2015 UTC,"Not sure if anyone cares but here it goes.  I played since beta and I know how to do most of the ""advanced"" tricks. I've practiced them for a while. I've tried every game mode and quite a bit of the mod modes.  While I enjoy that I can pick up and play, I think a huge problem is that people don't return to the game because its not very friendly.  The people don't like to encourage. They yell and blame. The game itself is not new player friendly. Team kills when new players are learning discourages random swings. But its not that easy. Its also easy for retaliation if some one gets accidentally TK'd.  Another issue is that all the advanced moves are frowned upon. Why? Why is feinting so bad? New players don't understand. Its like the noobtube problem in COD4. They get cool stuff that helps but don't realize why people don't like it.   TL:DR You need to take a lot etiquette classes to play this game and enjoy it. Which sucks."

Had the same issue with a skill-based spaceship shooter I used to play and loved (MoonBreakers, still F2P on Steam for those interested).  All the good flying & shooting tricks took a long time to learn and had the added disadvantage of earnable & buyable ships that were OP vs. rookies.  Loved it to pieces but it wasn't sustainable.

I spend all my time in the lowranked servers and my first real game as a level 16 was horrible. But with the right attitude and some help of the high ranked EU clanfags (love them tho) I can stand my ground on a normal server wich is more then enough to have fun."

ChivalryGame,370iq3,mobinstime,0,Mon May 25 04:32:56 2015 UTC,"This reason right here is why the devs should have removed all that stuff from the start.   Whether you think it creates a more competitive game or not, it's killed the community.   This game is fucking awesome and until another one like it replaces it, I'll be playing it for years to come. But unfortunately all these drags and ROHs have killed most new players off and effectively gated the community. It was at the very least a bad business decision by the developers."

A game where there's no real competition because there's no learning curve; a medieval COD game. It's like the self-esteem movement has spread to videogames. Now everyone is a special snowflake! They can't be bad at this game, this game is fun!  Every lvl1 would be able to take a run at a lvl60. Does that sound fun? All the work you put in for that high rank means nothing since a 7 year old can come in and lmb spam to victory. This game would be horrid if they removed all the features that you have to learn over time."
ChivalryGame,370iq3,slappymcnutface,1 point,Sun May 24 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"If that stuff was removed it would be just another boring game where everyone's feelings are taken into consideration.     You'd think, but at least in Deadliest Warrior the top-tier community play without those ROHs and stupid drags, and still find a new meta game. (well they use to, lately they're starting to attempt ROHs and while it confuses noobs it doesnt work half as well as it does in Medieval Warfare because of the new sweet-spot mechanic)   Anyways the point is the meta game in DW is much more competitive.. it's about panic and control. Basically you get a good duel where each of you can actually hit when you want to hit, and parry when you need to parry, and yeah it's hard to hit the other guy - so how do you make him fuck up his parry? Well you've got two major techniques - footwork to break the rhythm of the fight (i.e. avoid a swing, attack between opponents swings), and delays (like feints but without the bullshit).   A good duel of footwork and delays is fucking intense. It basically comes down to your own discipline and not panicking and parrying unless you actually see the swing, which is harder than it sounds. Feints are bullshit, they're practically impossible to avoid sometimes, but a delay is much more fair. Like let's say you establish a rhythm with your opponent and after each attack you do a quick thrust riposte. By the third time you parry, he's going to block mashing his RMB expecting that riposte.. but then you don't.. and he parries too soon.. and you get a free hit in. So the guy needs to restrain himself and not parry out of anticipation but from actually seeing the swing.   That's a lot more difficult than it sounds.   Plus, you throw in good footwork which of course is necessary in any fight.   I have found that these fights based around the fundamentals of timing and movement are much more competitive than any exploit bullshit like reverse overheads (which you have to admit just look stupid). Not to mention it's so much more friendly to new players since they can clearly see what's happening and aren't disgusted like they are when they see ROHs or lean overheads.    Every lvl1 would be able to take a run at a lvl60. Does that sound fun?    Yes, yes it does sound fun. Just like in any good combat game, if you fuck up you ought to die. You're basically asking for god-mode against new players, that is not a competitive attitude. In baseball the pitchers don't demand a strikeout against a rookie in their first at-bat. In fact, rookies often do really good in their first weeks because the pitchers don't have a good read on the batters yet."

ChivalryGame,370v4m,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Mon May 25 20:15:01 2015 UTC,I believe they took out the first person death animations because the armor customization caused problems/they didn't want to implement custom armor in the first person death animations.

And no, I'm not talking about aimpunch, that is an idiotic mechanic for multiplayer games.  Gameplay mechanics wise, yes, Slasher seems to be headed in a great direction."

ChivalryGame,370v4m,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,-2,Sun May 24 00:53:54 2015 UTC,"As far as suggestions go I agree, pretty much everything has been said. But they are still posting new videos and the majority of the commenters are actually negative towards complex mechanics and the devs are responding and looking for things they can do to appease these people. I suppose just utilizing your downvote ability and maybe occasionally saying you like what you see would reinforce things we like and take away from the majority of negative feedback from noobs."
ChivalryGame,370v4m,Charles_K,9,Sat May 23 21:26:01 2015 UTC,"How can we downvote when we can't even test and see it for ourselves? This isn't Chivalry, drags may very well be way too retarded or something. The fact that kicks are functional and that they are comboable dramatically shifts the whole feint balance debate. Hell, the fact that you have to actually aim parries changes EVERYTHING.  Removing jump is stupid, Guild Wars 1 made a huge mistake removing them. But feints, drags, kicks, stamina... all these basic mechanics need to be looked at from an entirely new perspective for Slasher. I don't want it to just be refined Chivalry... that honestly makes for a rather plain game duel-wise. I want more emphasis on footwork, intelligent feints, etc."
ChivalryGame,370v4m,Reithur,6,Sat May 23 21:32:25 2015 UTC,Said a piece.  Hope it helps.  Added it as it's own topic to improve visibility.
ChivalryGame,370v4m,Kesby,5,Sun May 24 00:42:03 2015 UTC,"Review from slasher tester;  The game as it stands will finish off chivalry when it (finally) gets released. Currently, the 1v1 combat actually feels like a sword fight, the mechanics are much more skill based and ""reactive"" than chivalry (its not about mind games). Feints are abit easier to read, so the game dosent turn into this caveman meta, there is alot of blade clashing and while you may say the game looks clunky, the game is extremely responsive. For example, parrying is feels so much better and there's no bullshit 0 frame animations, or varied animations frame amounts due to lag  Slasher is pre-alpha, it's got a long way to go, but already customization and combat is already better than chiv. You can customize the hilt/blade/handle of your swords, your shoulder armer, forearm armour, gloves etc.. Currently, we are struggling to figure out how to make the clashing mechanics not interfere with teamfights so much that attack spam becomes a legit playstyle in teamfights  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7j0Ydk6Ps sum slasher gameplay wid me"
ChivalryGame,370v4m,Charles_K,9,Sun May 24 18:04:16 2015 UTC,"What input can we give? Almost none of us are even able to play the damn thing. Zombo occasionally  tells me some cool sounding stuff. I can't give feedback without trying it myself, nor can I look for any bugs or test for any imbalanced weapons or mechanics.  Graphics? It does not look near complete or like a 2015 game. Actually, it looks quite rigid and weird. There is no theme to it, Chivalry pre-skins was actually quite cool and immersive with its unified armors and looks. What else can we say?"
ChivalryGame,370v4m,spaceecake,3,Sun May 24 18:22:43 2015 UTC,"It does seem your overexaggerating a bit, the opinions on the jumpstab video seem to be very devided but overall positive, and they're probably just gonna make jumps a bit less high to improve realism and balance. I'm also quite confident that the slashering mods have faith in the way drags currently work in their game and I don't think they will be changing it too drastically."
ChivalryGame,370v4m,BioshockEndingD00D,2,Sun May 24 00:00:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't heard anything negative about it, but like everyone else has said, there's not much you can say without playing it. The animations do look smooth, which to me is the most important thing. As long as the base combat code is good, everything else being kinda meh is fine for me. The only potential problem I see with those other aspects being meh is that it won't attract a casual playerbase, and without a casual playerbase, the game will be in the same spot chiv is in now. You'll have some amazing veterans who scrim when they can, but any REAL competitive scene might be unlikely. Part of why chivalry started off on the right foot is that it was funny and had its own sorta monty python humor and fun to it. That and TO. Where chivalry REALLY fucked up is the constant changing of mechanics, and the fact that most of the mechanics that gave it a high skill ceiling were placed in accidentally, and thus most people were completely ignorant of the game being more than decapitations and silly voice commands. I hope slasher is more than the opposite of chivalry.  As it is, there isn't much of a theme or art style that might get some casual players interested. If I wasn't a chiv player with a good amount of time and experience I'd only see a bunch of endless clashing and uninspired artwork. So yeah, I'm gonna buy and play the fuck out of this game, I'm just afraid other's won't. On my phone so sorry if this is incoherent and rambly."

ChivalryGame,370v4m,bi11y10,6,Sat May 23 20:55:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah same, the actual combat looks decent, but that's it. It doesn't look good or bad. As of yet I see no reason to play it over chiv."

ChivalryGame,370v4m,Rodkor,1 point,Sat May 23 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"It looks like a slower, watered down Chiv.  Attacks are sloppier than I would expect in a 'realistic' setting (sort of a slow-mo feel, maybe unresponsive). If they address the issue (more celerity and 'fluency', reduce sloppiness) it could be very nice, but right now it's like a cheap budget Chivalry..."
ChivalryGame,370v4m,spaceecake,3,Sat May 23 21:56:24 2015 UTC,I think the slow-mo feel is because they aim for every attack to be readable and blockable. No accelerated claymore bullshit that you can't read anymore. It also makes the reverse attacks way more easy to expect.

ChivalryGame,370v4m,CRUSHED1337,5,Sun May 24 00:24:23 2015 UTC,Well it is still in pre alpha so a little clunkyness isn't all that surprising. What do you think of the vid I edited in though? That one looks a lot smoother imo.
ChivalryGame,370v4m,ia_Flame,3,Sun May 24 07:48:35 2015 UTC,Chiv doesn't look like that at 180 ping though.
ChivalryGame,370v4m,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Sat May 23 21:34:11 2015 UTC,Youre right chiv looks and plays much worse
ChivalryGame,370v4m,ia_Flame,1 point,Sat May 23 21:38:15 2015 UTC,I agree just seems really sub par and unpolished. Honestly a bit over hyped.
ChivalryGame,370v4m,Charles_K,9,Sat May 23 21:42:17 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that it is closed alpha, the polish and animations will undoubtedly improve later on."
ChivalryGame,370v4m,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,3,Sat May 23 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"Eh the art style alone is what makes it seem that way along with the sounds and the animations overall seem clunky. It's all just seems so slow and awkward. You can't really change an entire art style or the core animations a whole lot at this point it seems. It just doesn't have that same style and polish as chiv does. Slasher kind of seems like a swing until someone misses a parry kind of game with how the clashing looks to be.   I would say for it to appeal more that the clashing needs to happen far less often and encourage more first hit flinch gameplay. I could be wrong in that it might already do that but to me it seems like anything and everything causes a clash in all the videos I have seen.   As I said earlier with the art style, the characters kind of look plain goofy and the audio just sounds really generic."
ChivalryGame,370v4m,CRUSHED1337,4,Sat May 23 21:42:55 2015 UTC,"lol I wonder which fucks downvote shit that has legit points without even bothering to refute them. This is why we can't ever have anything more than dank memes and bullshit.  Chivalry's alpha footage was impressively visceral and brutal. The parries and clanks still feel gritty and real.  ""Slasher is in alpha; all this will improve, I promise!"" Okay, until that happens, we'll continue to critique its outdated graphics and lacking art direction. There is literally NOTHING ELSE to critique, what do you want us to do, give bullshit feedback on a game we haven't even touched?  Even EXPERIENCED COMP players who see Slasher footage without reading essays about the mechanics automatically think: this just looks like constant clashing LMB spam. Obviously you know it's more than that if you were to read the essays or... I dunno... actually play it. Until the game becomes more visceral and impactful through improved visuals or sound or something... what more input can we give?  I bet if Spook wrote the same shit Flame did, you guys would be hugging his fucking nuts, upvoting, WOW HE IS SO RITE TEH SLASHER IS SO BADS (we aren't even saying it's bad you fucks) CAUSE SPOOK SAID SO. MOTHER OF FUCks.  The whole reason I'm even going on this rant is because I DO GIVE A FUCK about Slasher. I WANT IT TO SUCCEED. I WANT IT TO HAVE SALES, AND THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH SUB-2012 GRAPHICS AND GENERIC ART DIRECTION, AND IT DOES NOT LOOK PROMISING IN THAT ASPECT SO FAR. Yes, all this shit will undoubtedly improve, but will it improve ENOUGH? I'M STRESSING THAT THEY ARE VERY FUCKING IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE GAME, PEOPLE WANT TO FEEL LIKE A FUCKING DEATH KNIGHT OR MIGHTY WARRIOR WITH A BAD ASS MEDIEVAL SWORD.

ChivalryGame,370v4m,Kesby,1 point,Sat May 23 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"hey hope you see this  so I think a big part of melee combat in any game being successful is the feel of it. some of the other comments have described the webm as 'clunky'.   what chiv does pretty well is you generally feel like your weapons have impact. parries have a quick, crisp, sharp bounce to let you know the weapon was deflected. weapons feel like they have weight. the parry at 0:08 looks a bit dulled in comparison, and it doesn't help that the sound seems to lag behind. you can have 10/10 mechanics over chiv but the hit feedback and overall 'feel' are super important too.  that said I think it looks cool and think you're heading the right direction."
ChivalryGame,370v4m,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Sun May 24 03:04:43 2015 UTC,"hoping to see some notable differences from chiv soon. As of right now the term 'clone' seems too close. Not that it's a bad thing but I want to see some big, big changes soon. Seems like some chiv players are special and have invites too. So sure plenty of people involved in TS will also be here on the sub  Personally, probably can tell, I am not a fan as of right now. But we've had it sticked on the sidebar for a long time and it's certainly relevant to chiv. Give it a look over and decide for yourself  edit: if the game is supposed to be different than chiv, maybe input from chiv comp players wouldnt be perfect comments."
ChivalryGame,370v4m,Kesby,4,Sun May 24 07:40:00 2015 UTC,"The devs specify in their sidebar that they are ex-competitive chivalry players themselves. Also I do not think that chivalry will be the monopoly on these kinds of competitive games. I see the difference between chivalry and TS to perhaps be as little as the difference between old school shooter games like Halo, COD4, and CS.

ChivalryGame,36w1sk,dorfbag,2,Fri May 22 22:08:44 2015 UTC,"Hey Knights! thanks for all your comments and criticism! Regarding the ""more metallic look"" and ""shine"" options: UDK has several options for tweaking the specular map (the texture that controls the amount of reflections\shining) and its quite a job to find the right amount. Because if you increase the specular too high the blade shine like a lantern, and that does not look like a metal, more like never ending light source. If you decrease this amount - it will not reflect at all. So I chose the middle value. It does reflect, but it does not shine like a magic lantern. I tend to realism, although I know a lot of people tend to fantasy style. Thanks again for all your comments and opinions, it means a lot!"
ChivalryGame,36w1sk,Oilystool,2,Sun May 24 10:37:55 2015 UTC,"Hey LSMz I also agree with the comments, it's much too clean looking. The same for the blade, I think you should darken your diffuse a bit more and it will help with the flat look if the weapon. When you do a diffuse that's too bright,when you add the spec it tends to look flat. Darkening the wood would help add contrast and to give the weapon a bit of wear and tear,lighten the area of the wood where the hand would hold it. It's a nice weapon but much too new looking."

He has skill and is on the right track to be a very good player, but Ham and I are the first to admit that he does not have as much experience in a leadership role as others might.  You have some legit complaints but you also have subjective opinions which can be argued.  Ham, like almost everyone outside of the basement dwellers is a full-time student and also works, so his time varies and might have to leave at a moment’s notice.   I wasn’t there to confirm or deny the bitching, but it wouldn’t surprise me; patience isn’t one of his strengths and is something he is working on.   The specific incident you mention in your post was one of those days that he got a call and had to leave to work right then and there; real life took precedence over a game. I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that your apology is sincere and you are not being pragmatic or a personal attack, but it sure is easy to cast stones, isn’t it? ScaredyHam has put in a lot of work trying to build up a good clan, but his lack of experience has broken as much as he has built.  It is reasons like what you have said, along with other recent issues that has prompted a change in leadership role within our clan.  ScaredyHam has agreed to step down as leader and is now co-leader.  I (Σ | the_stooges) have stepped in to help with the administration of this clan as well as developing the strategic and tactical plans for this clan in the future.  I will rely upon Ham’s knowledge of the game and enthusiasm along with my experience with running clans in other games to get this group going in the right direction. I too apologize for what happened, but for different reasons that you.  I am sorry that you seem a little bitter and frustrated with your experience, but you can’t make an omelet without breaking some eggs.  Ham has always said nothing but good things about you and your time in our clan, so I thank you for that.  I too am sorry that the scrim went sideways, but things happen.  For anyone else that was involved and feels similarly, then I too apologize that the game went south, but hell; it’s just a game.  Everyone involved has had shit happen, but hopefully didn’t have every event thrown in their face via social media like Ham has. I am getting to know the current members and am getting up to speed with Chiv, and look forward to the future where we can get a group of casual gamers along with a core group that is interested in more serious Chiv play.  This will take some time, but I do hope we can go from here and take care of the issues we have. Hopefully we will be able to regain the faith and trust of the community by responsible, mature interactions, all the while remembering that this is just a game and by not letting this dominate our personal lives. Thanks"
ChivalryGame,36tjde,the_stooges,1 point,Fri May 22 22:20:21 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is, If he doesn't want people judging his actions, he shouldn't perform said actions. Almost no one in immortals gets a shred of respect from players that know how he acts now and how he as acted in the past, and the difference between how he acts now and how he's acted in the past is almost not even there. You can say ""He had his reasons"" and that you'll change as a clan but overall from what I've seen in this post alone it just seems that you're acting like what scaredyham has done is hardly wrong at all which in fact, it is. It's a blatant display of inconsideration when everyone else has to bear with your childish displays and deal with your mistakes like having to play through a scrim that you set up that players on both teams are looking forward to that you eventually quit mid-way through because you get so frustrated at a game that you stop considering everyone else's time and effort that they're investing and insist on showing everyone how much of a child you are, which is exactly what scaredyham has done and is doing, and I have no doubt he will continue to negatively influence the chiv community so long as he's here; That doesn't exclusively mean people in the comp scene currently, Scaredyham has a tendency of recruiting new players who are inexperienced in the competitive scene and actually might have a passion for learning and experienced the highest level of play that NA chiv has to offer, but when scaredyham invites them and they, not knowing what comp scene or immortals or scaredyham is like, accept the invitation only to have their reputations tarnished because of the immature displays that he has consistently presented to the community on a regular basis. My reasons for saying this tarnishes their reputations is because a leader of a clan represents all of his members and all of his members represent his clan, if scaredyham, the leader is acting immature consistently, this is obviously going to negatively affect its members and the amount of respect they receive from the community. Aside from that, there's also players that get recruited to his clan that get a false idea of what the comp scene is like and immaturity and childishness is all they see from their perspective, which negatively affects the Chivalry scene as a whole. ScaredyHam is literally affecting the game's population."

I don’t know what made you think I was excusing anything, but no one, especially me will justify any bad behavior from anyone in our clan, whether it’s Ham or not, and I didn’t do that in my post.  If you want to start pointing fingers at people for failing to meet your expectations of what a good player should be, there are a hell of a lot more toxic people in the Chiv community I can point to, including some that have posted in this thread. I enjoy the drama of your last line “ScaerdyHam is literally affecting the game’s population”.  Oh no; hide the women and children, here come’s Ham!  I should tell him to change his name to “DeathHam”, and we should change our name to the “Horsemen of the Chiv Apocalypse Clan”.  Also, I’ll be the first to throw money to pay for the group therapy for Chiv players that have been traumatized by Ham…the line starts here. Seriously, this is a game…a game.  You, and everyone else should look back to what we all learned a long time ago; schoolyard rules.  If you don’t like someone, then take your ball and go.  If you don’t like playing with Ham, and by default anyone associated with him/us, then don’t.  We all have things that time will improve, and Ham is no different. As a player new to Chiv, I’d say that reading some of the Chiv reddit stuff turns off new players more than anyone playing the game.  If I’d seen this first I might have thought twice before slapping down greenbacks for Chiv. If you or anyone has legitimate issues with Ham or anyone in my clan, add me as a friend and talk to me.  I’ll take what has been said on reddit and what you have to say and address it accordingly.  If you are truly concerned about the Chiv community and want to improve it…work with me.

If your excuse for negligent behavior towards the community is ""It's a game and shouldn't be taken seriously"" then feel free to ignore anything and everything anyone says about you, scaredyham, or your clan because if you don't take this game seriously then people who do take it seriously will take you as a joke, which is more or less what scaredyham and immortals as a whole are."
ChivalryGame,36tjde,PM_ME_UR_FLAT_CHESTS,1 point,Sat May 23 04:01:14 2015 UTC,"Whoa now, slow down.  I never said that we feel or treat this game as a joke; everyone in Immortals have put down good money for this game just like you.  There is no one in my clan that I’m aware of that gets online to do nothing but crap in the lap of anyone else in the Chiv community.  Have you every acted as a mentor to someone?  Have you ever helped anyone grow and overcome their shortcomings?  If not, have you ever managed people, played team sports or even run a clan?  If you can say yes to any of the above, then you either didn’t do it well, have done it well and are just venting your frustration, or are just here to throw crap.  I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt because you seem to be intelligent, so I’ll assume it’s the second.  If that’s the case, then only time will fix any complaints you and anyone else have with Ham or anyone in my clan.  BTW, do you have names you can PM me that would apply to your statement “…as well as a few other people in immortals…”?  Like I said before, let me know and I can work with that too.  I don’t know you, but I bet there has been one or more people that you can look to that have had a positive impact in your life and have helped you grow as a person.  I am that person for Ham, and want to be that person for the rest of my clan brothers.  I take everything you, and the OP has to say seriously and will work on those concerns with my clan, as any good leader should.  I am in it to help my team get to the point that we can be taken seriously.  Right now, I have been on the job for two weeks and have said publically (here) that we have a long, difficult road.  I’ll extend the offer again; friend me and voice your concerns so we can address this like adults and make it better for all.  I wouldn’t have wasted my time if this was a big joke and I wouldn’t have bothered to respond to you or the OP.  I’m looking towards the future like the rest of my clan is, and a strong leader will identify the problem areas and address it one way or another.  All I ask is that we are given an opportunity to work out our issues and earn the respect of the community without the constant public shit throwing and finger pointing.  It’s easy to kick someone when they are down; it takes a bigger person to offer someone a hand up.  If anyone else has your passion for the game and feels that anyone in the Immortals needs some help, I’m the one you want to start with.  So either shit or get off the pot; work with me and I’ll work with you, or continue what you are doing and miss an opportunity to enjoy the game with what I believe are good group of hard working guys; the Immortals.  For real; friend me...I, and my clan would like the opportunity to show the community that we are trying, starting with you and the OP.  Thanks."
ChivalryGame,36tjde,the_stooges,4,Sat May 23 18:04:35 2015 UTC,Thanks for the apology. Although I see no point in clans when this game is more broken than the Colosseum and about as balanced as the leaning tower of Pisa.

ChivalryGame,36t7i3,Keiji99,15,Thu May 21 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"Okay there seems to be a lot of misconceptions with Nemesis and Keyes in general and as a guy who played in every tournament with them, I felt obliged to clear a lot of things up.  It began a really long time ago, Blizzard released Warcraft 3, successor to the successful Warcraft 2 game long ago. It captivated our hearts because it was a 3d rts made by the company who brought us Starcraft. However, more importantly, the custom maps were even SICKER than Starcraft UMS (Use Map Settings). HOW AWESOME IS THAT?  Eventually, someone made the spiritual successor to Starcraft UMS's Aeon of Strife - Defense of the Ancients. This community mod went through many different design leaders before finally settling with Icefrog and his version of the mod - DotA All-Stars. This was deemed the best and most balanced of the Dota variations and is what has stuck til today.  One of the heroes featured in Dota, Puck, actually had his entire skillset thought up by a random forum member who posted his ideas on the playdota forums. Outside of a few number tweaks, Icefrog implemented Puck exactly as the forum member designed him! To this day, he remains one of the more popular mid-heroes due to his evasiveness, team disruption capabilities, and cuteness. He uses the Faerie Dragon model from Warcraft 3.  I was not particularly fond of Dota for nearly a decade. I never liked or understood the gameplay to a deep level and thought, ""well, if I'm going to play a hard RTS game, why not just Brood War (this was before SC2 came out, mind you)?"" It wasn't until Valve released Dota 2 that my valve inner fanboyism gave it a try. Upon randomly checking my e-mail, I noticed I got a beta key so I thought ""why not?""  My first few games were awful. Lots of feeding inbound. What was even WORSE were the friends and foes! I've had a Clockwerk literally run into our tower pre-creeps and just die... then abandon. That was an easy 5v4 for us.  I probably would have quit again if my brother hadn't carried and taught me. I went with Venomancer for many of our trials. Incredibly simple and basic, you didn't really have to think too hard about what items to get and one of his spells is a free, albeit short-lived, ward! Eventually, I would move on to more complex heroes such as Chen, Visage, Sand King, and Puck.  My first game as Puck. I was laned with Lich, going top lane as Radiant. I will never forget that game.  ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING PUCK?""  ""WHY WOULD YOU NOT TELEPORT AFTER YOU HIT HIM WITH THE Q ORB WHLIE WE CHASE""  ""okay you know what i'm done"" - and, for the rest of the game, Lich wandered rather aimlessly, died a few times, and talked no more. We lost that game pretty horrendously. Still, I stuck through with Puck and learned to play him. He became one of my favorite heroes.  I changed my name to ""Puck"" as I pubbed the Chivalry Duel West Coast #9 server. 10 - 0s were fairly easy most of the time... However, there was one fierce contender - a Vanguard of utmost foulness and master of 3rd person exploitations. His name... was Suspicious Tumbleweed.  Vanguard. 3rd person. Claymore accels and instant ripostes. Crouch matrixing. This guy did it all. An incredibly fearsome opponent. However, he was no match for my level sub-30 Quarterstaff MAA.  ""wow fucking faggot you gonna dodge?"" Mind you, I did not know about dodge-in-parry at the time. These were legit dodges. ""you can only kill me with broken class dodging no-skill bitch"". ""faggot has to use feints to beat me"" (These were not the exact words uttered, but I believe these words captured his sentiments at the time.) Hell, I would beat him with him feinting me while I myself relented and didn't use any. Pfffft.  Though our duels were close, I managed to trounce him every time, both as MAA and Knight (I was not particularly fond of the Vanguard class at the time; heck, I didn't even know what the Halberd, Billhook, Bardiche, and Polehammer were called or how to tell the difference between them).  Yet, I was afraid. All it would take is for him to defeat me once before he would shittalk me straight into my fragile ego. So, before we dueled again, I had to change my name, ""Puck"".  Ahah! The solution was simple. ""a truck"", he'll never know that it's me.  I proceeded to trounce him more, this time without MAA and without any feints. What did he have to say then? Nothing, he promptly would just leave or continue dueling others from now on. No more trash talking, no more bruised egos. Well, people would occasionally say ""lol wow Longsword Knight overpowered"" at times. But those moments were few and rare.  Facing adversaries who refused to feint for whatever reason was becoming incredibly boring. My fix for this? Brilliant, I shall name myself ""a truck (i feint)"" or ""a truck (feint me)"". ""wow, look at this feinting faggot, i better feint him before he feints me"". Now, my opponents began to fight me as dirty as possible. Of course, in our beautiful West Coast servers, where we live in lands filled with honey but no rain and with 20 ping, feint reading was a very real possibility. In this way, even in pubs, I was forcing even the most ""honorable"" of players to feint me and use whatever tricks were at their sleeves to (try to) vanquish me.  With the success of League of Legends and Dota 2, it is only natural for Blizzard, the very company that brought us classics such as Starcraft and Warcraft 3 (from which the Dota genre blew up from), to try their own hand at this ""MOBA"" genre (as dubbed by Riot games - MOBA is perhaps the most dull and generic name ever, just like all these ""MOBA"" names --- X of the X --- X of X --- Defense of the Newerth Legends, blargh).  Blizzard's own entry? Heroes of the Storm.  Heroes of the Storm™ is a raucous online team brawler starring your favorite Blizzard characters. Build and customize heroes from across every Blizzard universe to suit your play style. Team up with your friends and engage in fast-paced mayhem across varied battlegrounds that impact strategy and change the way you play the game.

Select your favorites from more than 20 years of Blizzard games.  Heroes of the Storm is FREE TO PLAY and officially releases in June 2, 2015. Yes, there is a faerie dragon in this game. However, she is not named Puck. Rather, her name is Brightwing, and she is a supportive hero who heals and buffs her allies while polymorphing foes and either blinking around to heal allies or disrupting the battlefield with her ultimate winds."

ChivalryGame,36wsvu,TheSleepyBuffalo,5,Fri May 22 19:39:41 2015 UTC,"Teamwork in CS is very different.  The way you talk is very efficient because otherwise you're just filling up comms and deafening your teammates. Sound is incredibly important in CS. In a 1vX situations, you quickly call out how you died and if you lit up any enemies, then STFU for the rest of the round.  There is no target switching, so that incredibly big part about Chivalry teamwork is just absent in CSGO. You either kill the enemy target or they kill you... you're using guns after all. However, there is coordinating smokes and flashes, and even top clans in Chivalry kind of fail when it comes to that kind of coordination.  There is a lot of split play (obviously mandatory for CTs, optional but can be powerful as Ts) involved in CSGO. Not so in Chivalry, it's usually big group vs big group.  Don't train so hard for Chivalry unless you actually find it fun. There's no point lmao. No one's gonna give a shit if you are best whatever-the-fuck class in less than a year. Sophax, Tyrant, Harry, whoever the fuck else, you think they give a shit anymore? Besides, if you really did want to train for some computer game, you should probably look into how the Asians do it if anything. Americans tend to be consistently low tier when it comes to internationally popular games for whatever reason, almost always outmatched by European and Asian teams.  MAN FUCKING CLOUD9 LOST MY FUCKING BLACK GRAPHITE AWP STATTRAK THAT I BET ON THEM QQ this is why I'm so bitter  Speaking of black, I used to have a black wiener dachshund named Monster, damn I miss him so much and it's been like 7 years (gave him away cause of money problems and stuff). He would steal my KFC and steak and try to hide under the couch but he'd be so bloated that he got stuck with his ass and feet sticking out. I somehow conditioned him so that whenever I said ""bye Monster"", his ears would perk up and he would race to my bedroom for nap time. Unfortunately, I taught him how to jump up chairs and beds and couches, which is how he managed to even steal food in the first place. I had to NEVER leave my food unattended!  Again, on the topic of black, do you like black metal? Heavy music that others would label as ""devil music""? Well, you'll be right at home with Heroes of the Storm's ETC: Elite Tauren Chieftain! Face melt your foes with the power of METAL. Force your enemies to engage in a WICKED MOSH PIT as your allies decimate them uncontested! Use the power of DEVIL MUSIC to stun, push, shove, and rock your enemies out of this world!  The Power of the Horde incarnated by brutal rhythms and blistering guitar riffs into the most elite tauren chieftain to ever headbang across the surface of Azeroth. Don't bother putting on socks. He's just going to rock them off anyways.  Heroes of the Storm is officially released and FREE on June 2, 2015. Choose among your favorite Blizzard heroes, and duke it out in a 5-on-5 Hero Brawler!

ChivalryGame,36q4qe,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,8,Thu May 21 12:59:14 2015 UTC,"O say can you see, by the dawn’s early light, What so proudly we hail’d at the twilight’s last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight O’er the ramparts we watch’d were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket’s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there, O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?  On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream, ’Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!  And where is that band who so vauntingly swore, That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion A home and a Country should leave us no more? Their blood has wash’d out their foul footstep’s pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.  O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand Between their lov’d home and the war’s desolation! Blest with vict’ry and peace may the heav’n rescued land Praise the power that hath made and preserv’d us a nation! Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto - “In God is our trust,”  And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave."

It was our second time playing the game so we were all still very new to it. While fucking around and testing out some of the game mechanics...yes, we did kick a few players if they joined and apparently some people were upset by that. Which sucks. I’m not saying what we were doing was right…we were being assholes and hogging the server no doubt. The assumption was made that people were joining our game just because we were streaming. We simply wanted a private game amongst friends. We’re not here to ruin anyone’s game…But like I said, there were hundreds of other empty servers, and more importantly... 20 full pop servers. We’ll have to look into setting up a private, dedicated server for the future. We’re all just here to have fun. Apologies if anyone was upset over getting kicked. Props to the reddit community for crashing our fun too, and coming into a live streamer’s chat just to be an ass. We just moved on and found something else to play. It's just a game. NO. BIG. DEAL."

ChivalryGame,36ql5z,Kesby,2,Thu May 21 13:02:21 2015 UTC,"you can read overhead or swing feints with anything .4ms~ wind-up over, stabs no. neither whirlwind swings/overheads (you can help this with footwork). torn banner will never change this, they'd rather half the playerbase boycott the other. therefore if you wish to play honest and fairly, follow the above and feint freely!!"
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,Shenoto,1 point,Fri May 22 16:21:20 2015 UTC,"With my current ping I have about 180 ms to reliably read and parry real attacks. Considering I have about a 150 ms reaction time to movement, I should be able to pull it off. The problem is that I have to distinguish between a feint and a real attack. The more times I practice and see the animations, the faster I will get."
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,Kesby,7,Thu May 21 13:18:13 2015 UTC,"testing in a controlled environment like that then applying it into a 5v5/LTS scenario is a completely different story  standing still to read the feint to see the 30ms window is never going to work in actual play, if you want to practice feint reads you gotta do it the old fashioned way."
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,Yazuak,2,Thu May 21 13:43:09 2015 UTC,It's like practicing scales in order to get good at playing a musical piece. Makes perfect sense. Haters gonna hate.
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,Politician_Cranberry,3,Fri May 22 15:41:08 2015 UTC,"What I meant by 180 ms is that I have 180 ms to decide. 30 ms would just be the difference between my reaction time and the required reaction time to read it IF you perfected everything.  I don't see why it wouldn't work in practice. You would have to work on applying it in team-fights, but it wouldn't be impossible to do. Practicing in video games is no different than practicing anything else."
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,CelebratoryCrouching,2,Thu May 21 16:36:53 2015 UTC,i have a 280 ms reaction time :V
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,sesstreets,2,Thu May 21 18:45:29 2015 UTC,That feel when you have old man reaction times but you're only 21
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,Kesby,7,Fri May 22 02:55:17 2015 UTC,This is what I don't get about the players who feint constantly and think there's nothing wrong about it.  The animation of feints is a problem. It is not always a 'git gud' situation.
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,Charles_K,7,Thu May 21 11:57:25 2015 UTC,"Even the best players dont read every feint. The whole point of feinting is almost like bringing RNG into the game, but not in a bad way, more in the fact that you have to make strategic estimates  Top players (Crush/Dusty, for example) aren't going to read every feint, but they will read alot of feints, are good at dodging when they do get feinted, but the main aspect is the fact that they wont give you the opportunity to feint them in the first place  Feint fights arent about reading feints and dealing them out, it's about who has the greater offensive and defensive abilities, stamina management, ability to punish, ability to predict the opponents next move etc. etc. etc.. Feint reading isn't everything, not sure why u mericans are so obsessed with it  Crush reads most of his feints through mind games anyway, he knows you will feint thats why he reads it. But he will read bad feints, as well."
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,SER_JON,2,Thu May 21 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"A lot of Muricants sucked dick at footwork and gaining control of a duel, especially when it is easier to yolo gamble/caveman (doubly so in live). Slowly people are getting better and playing smarter though.  I mean, when you are west coast and your own team forces you to play east, you are forced to not play reactively because otherwise you die, you cannot even see maa ripostes by reaction at that point, nevermind the nonscrub/sow feints."

If it was offline then almost the instant I hit RMB the game would perform a parry. Since I'm online, even though I hit RMB and part of the parry animation has shown up, I still get hit."
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,sesstreets,1 point,Thu May 21 12:33:30 2015 UTC,While i see and agree with you I'd like you to see the issue with 'reading' feints in that the animation difference between an attack and a feint is miniscule.
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,sesstreets,3,Thu May 21 12:49:16 2015 UTC,I think that the SoW animation is okay. Spear animation is pretty big but the halberd just sucks.
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,sesstreets,3,Thu May 21 13:15:33 2015 UTC,"The sow, in your video, and all other weapons has little differentiation between being a feint animation or being an attack animation.  Am I making sense."
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,twoLegsJimmy,2,Thu May 21 13:20:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. What I'm saying is that the SoW has a difference between the feint animation and the attack animation. It's noticeable to me, but the halberd is very hard to notice for me. I mean I guess all the animations suck, but the SoW is not the worst of them all."
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,sesstreets,1 point,Thu May 21 13:22:47 2015 UTC,"I slowed it down to .5fps sec  There are 10 frames that are replicated in both feinted and non feinted attacks. If you windup a sow stab and feint, for at least 10 frames there is no physical way to ""read"" them because theres no differentiation between the animations of feinted and nonfeinted attacks.  Only diff is that when you feint the animation plays in reverse."
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,CavemanMetaBestMeta,1 point,Thu May 21 13:57:47 2015 UTC,I thought that you were talking about the animation for when the weapon goes back to idle. Yeah a feint is just canceling an attack so there's no way to read it before it has been canceled. Also keep in mind that these are perfect SoW stab feints in mercs.
ChivalryGame,36ql5z,MostToxicplayer,1 point,Thu May 21 16:44:01 2015 UTC,Yeah this game is nonsense. Honestly the bubble should be increased by like 3% to stop these attacks going into someone.

Kill two bad guys with one swing then turn bravely to face the third like a true champion while my team destroys the catapult unmolested.  Here are some things I would like to do in the future with your help:  Kick someone and stun them and say ""no, my lord"" as I finish them with a mighty overhead.  Get better with the war hammer so I can pretend I am Robert Baratheon at the Trident.  Use the objective torches to set people on fire.  Be the king because last time I was king I didn't know how the game worked and I just ran into battle and thought I was playing incredibly well because I was killing noobs and I didn't know I had higher health and I asked someone if that was the case and they lied to me so we lost.

You assumed the team kill was intentional, waited for me at a point, blocking a spawn wave, and then kicked me into the water on Belmez. I wasn't paying attention, I ran with the Masons and completely forgot I was on Agatha, so it was much to my surprise that when I killed you I picked up the flag instead of returning it. Accidents happen, you need to be more forgiving and not revenge team kill. I told you it was an accident, I warned you not to intentionally team kill, and you told me yours was ""an accident too"". This was obviously not the case, so I took it you were just trolling.  I feel bad for not apologizing immediately. However your kick from the server for the latter behavior was not unwarranted.  Also the poster is lower case, he plays US East a lot, I see him around and never felt the need to remove him prior. For this reason his kick was short. He can already rejoin the server."

In fact it was, as you are saying you forgot what team you were playing on.  Given that circumstance, I don't think my reaction was inappropriate.  You said you forgot what team you were playing on, so I will chalk the TK and the lack of any communication afterwards up to an honest mistake and mis-communication.  In that case, I retract my claim that you are an abusive admin.  However, to say that you ""warned"" me is not accurate.  I asked in chat what happened, didn't hear anything.  Your message of ""It was an accident"" came after I TKd you back, and within 5 seconds of your typing that in chat and me responding ""Ditto"", I was kicked from the server.  So I wouldn't call that a warning.   I promise to be more patient in future if you do the same."

Also, why would you even post publicly about this. You should privately message someone from TB, some form of contact with the people who should see it; not the community.

ChivalryGame,36n78c,LordKefkaPalazzo,7,Wed May 20 16:58:42 2015 UTC,"i teamkill or attack all the time on accident and you will see me do it at times on my stream... and then I'm just like OH SHIT i'm on (such and such team). Usually happens when I transition from one map to another and I was on the opposite team and get used to killing one side or get unknowingly teamswitched and don't realize it becuase i'm talking or not focused. Then sometimes there will be people that run in front of me when i'm fighting and i follow through them too (that's their fault though).  As far as the immediate apology, if i'm going to apologize it's usually after I too am dead and not while in the middle of doing something still alive. I would most likely go back and say something if there's noone around or archers aren't shooting at me.  Either way, as others have said revenge kills aren't really the way to go, even if someone tk's you once or even if they're trolling, the worst case scenario is that they seem to be doing something on accident or you end up with more team damage somehow and you still get kicked and then you're even more pissed and fucked on."

Best way to deal with them is pick the heavy crossbow and practice with the spawn ranges on each duel map. Once you're good simply join a duel server and instant kill the MAA when the round starts. If something goes wrong just use the butter knife and fuck him up.

Then there's feinting with it, it's one of the hardest weapons almost impossible to 'read' feints, guessing sure but read very hard because it's 2 sided. Judging ranges is ridiculously hard you almost have to always parry because it's almost always within range even if it doesn't look like it. Plus if you try and attack at the same time, it will almost always get the flinch, and it's recovery time is better than most other 2 handers and a lot of 1 handers.  It's pretty ridiculous.  Then you also have maa in general which with 2 frames of animation are just tiny teleporting men.  Norse still better than q-staff tho."

The range on it is actually pretty short. It's two sided, but the only time the left side of the QS raises first, is during a parry. All it really has is its speed, and most MAA don't play it the right way.   Not a lot of people have used it, so not a lot of people are used to fighting/reading it, but I've killed QS users as Vanguard/Knight and I'm barely experienced in either, so it's not impossible/OP, just takes time to get used to fighting it."

I've had fun doing scrims on Hillside, it was in the last Tournie, and there aren't any unwinnable objectives on either side.  I'd like to see castle assault as a more played comp map, but that second objective defending the doors is really easy for Agatha to defend."
ChivalryGame,36kxoc,Chuckdatass,0,Wed May 20 14:14:42 2015 UTC,"From my experience there is 2 problems with hillside. It is too easy for defense archers on objective 1 to inflict huge damage since you are basically crossing open ground for 20 to 30 seconds. There isn't much trickery you can do since the defense can see the whole first approach. Last couple scrims/pugs I played on that map never got through the first stage. (Which usually happens on evenly matched opponents). The other reason, is that ballistas can still bug out, which would make it too unsure to even roll the dice on."
ChivalryGame,36kxoc,Oskoff,1 point,Wed May 20 14:58:47 2015 UTC,By that logic stoneshill shouldn't be scrimmed on either due to the bug where agatha can't spawn on the final objective.
ChivalryGame,36kxoc,Chuckdatass,1 point,Wed May 20 20:22:44 2015 UTC,That spawn bug can happen at any objective on any map. So I'm not sure what you are talking about.
ChivalryGame,36kxoc,Oskoff,1 point,Wed May 20 21:16:02 2015 UTC,Really? I've only had it four times and every single time was as agatha on the final objective of stoneshill
ChivalryGame,36kxoc,Chuckdatass,0,Wed May 20 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"Yup. It happens quite a bit. Darkforest, Cove, battlegrounds. Not sure what causes it, but it's followed by sky rocketing pings. Source: I play too much. Seems to happen when an objective drags out for a long time. Which makes sense with the last stoneshill  obj. Also this has never happened to me in comp. I think it's it tied to a higher number of players."
ChivalryGame,36kxoc,Oskoff,1 point,Wed May 20 21:24:39 2015 UTC,"I only have about 700 hours but that's pretty contrary to my experiences, have only had as agatha final objective stoneshill, have never noticed ping changes going along with it, every single time it's happened on the first spawn at that objective and it's happened to be in 1 scrim which was 6v6 with 2 spectators..."
ChivalryGame,36kxoc,Chuckdatass,0,Wed May 20 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"Maybe you the ebola of chiv. In my 1500 hours of play, I've never had it happen in a scrim."
ChivalryGame,36kxoc,ExileTheWolf,1 point,Thu May 21 01:43:41 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend going back and watching the footage of the last tourney where Hillside was played. Due to Mercs indirectly effecting pretty much archer damage and pretty much everything, there were very few, if any, first objective DNFs.  I still can't speak to the ballista glitch, but I truly haven't experienced it in quite a while."
ChivalryGame,36kxoc,Charles_K,1 point,Wed May 20 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"It's kind of discouraging to make a new map when it's hard to do so and less than 1000 play this worldwide at a given moment :/.  TBS still hasn't released those new maps yet, a couple of them looked promising but jesus Mercs mod went from 1.0 to 1.9 the whole time they were ""planning"" to release them or whatever the hell.  People also don't really feel like learning new maps or playing outpost on casual scrims and shit. Dust2 dust2 dust2 dust2 plz, no i dun wanna practice outpost, i wanna practice muh dust2 cus its gona be most common mapp in tornomont"
ChivalryGame,36kxoc,Jared39,1 point,Wed May 20 09:19:12 2015 UTC,"I love Hillside, it is my favorite map for scrims. I also enjoy stoneshill but I cant stand Darkforest.   There is no strategy to DF at all .... it is just push after push with hardly any opportunity for sneaky tactics ... disgusting."

ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Dustin-,11,Tue May 19 22:19:57 2015 UTC,The flail can def be reworked.  The tracers and animations are wonky. Not super practical but it would be funny if there was some momentum mechanic added to the flail.  The longer you combo the more powerful it gets.  If you are skilled enough you can get a 1 hit headshot on any class after using all your stam lol.
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,waterskin,2,Tue May 19 22:45:46 2015 UTC,"I think the flail+shield combo needs a rework. I went to a random dueling server and got 2nd place with just shield bashes. It's too fast, and combined with the slow weirdness of the flail it just makes it way too powerful and makes the whole setup too hard to block."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,waterskin,1 point,Tue May 19 23:31:00 2015 UTC,I agree the shield bash is ridiculous haha.  But this is prob the only reason why flail works.  You have to combine the instas with the weird drags.
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Clayton-BigsB,1 point,Wed May 20 19:55:34 2015 UTC,"Yep. I'm not sure what's worse about the shield: the fact that you can feint with them, or the fact that you can do a reverse stab with them (think ROH but with a shield bash)."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,AllUrMemes,2,Wed May 20 20:01:52 2015 UTC,"it just needs to be able to riposte. I had an idea a long time back that if you used a BUCKLER shield only, that you could riposte with the weapon you have it with. :/"
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Clayton-BigsB,2,Wed May 20 20:20:56 2015 UTC,"And how about letting knights use the heater shield without picking flail?  I'd love to have a DubAxe or Bearded Axe with mace/heater as backup.  It was so weird they added the ability to use kite/tower shield with flail, which looks super awkward, but you still can't get the heater shield without flail."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,AllUrMemes,1 point,Wed May 20 20:50:17 2015 UTC,"i think because heater is like just as easy to block everything with, yet it costs less stamina. Shields might be too OP then. They kind of have too much stamina now as it is i mean considering they're way easier to block everything with and they still have almost the same stam as non shield user."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,zn95,2,Thu May 21 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"I know, it's just better for combat.  Blocks everything in melee just as good, and only gives up a wee bit of ranged defense.  I would gladly see all the shields be a bit rebalanced.  The heater really SHOULD be the perfect melee shield though, with a bit less stamina or speed loss in exchange for the lesser ranged defense.  That's how I'd do it, anyhow."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Clayton-BigsB,4,Thu May 21 01:23:54 2015 UTC,"Bearded Axe. It used to be a fast, hard hitting weapon that excelled in extremely close quarters combat.  After the handlehit nerf and bubble were introduced to the game, there's pretty much no reason to use it over something like messer or the dubaxe/m0l, unless you really like missing all of your ripostes because it's so short and undraggable.   I think the best way to fix it would be an across the board increase on range and release times of all of its attacks and it would be much more viable.   TL:DR Make the bearded axe more like the skeggox from the DW and not a shitty claymore-dubaxe hybrid  Also messer is still too gud."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,MajorGrempington,2,Wed May 20 00:34:49 2015 UTC,My only gripe with the old Mr. Beardy was its ungodly attack speed. It seems like they nerfed the windup speed so now it's easy to see coming. Still a hell of a good weapon to feint with (if you're into that sort of thing).
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,ia_Flame,2,Wed May 20 00:39:10 2015 UTC,"it wasn't so much the attack speed alone, but the speed after feinting. You could cfta the shit out of that thing. That was really most of why it got nerfed."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Anstii,9,Wed May 20 20:22:18 2015 UTC,Halberd for obvious reasons
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,PsychoLLamaSmacker,3,Tue May 19 22:27:28 2015 UTC,Agreed needs to be made slower and take 4 hits to kill a knight thatll show it
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,waterskin,4,Wed May 20 06:52:54 2015 UTC,"Make the heavy xbow into a mobile ballista, for true unbiased balance."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Charles_K,4,Tue May 19 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly as a console only player, the brandistock. Its swings are too fast and too short of wind-up. The stab blocking is wonky and unreliable. Its also too easy to block with it for some reason. When a guy youre smashing can pull that out and become a huge competitor, theres an issue"
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,AllUrMemes,1 point,Wed May 20 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"The brandistock is an inherently good weapon.  It's range and knock back gives you distance, which makes it far easier to defend. If there is something I would change it would probably be the knockback."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,waterskin,4,Wed May 20 19:52:01 2015 UTC,"Everyone downvoting you even though this is basically what mercs mod is for 2hers lol, bringing every 2h to knight swords viability and all van weapons to zwei/brandi viability.  Though I guess if you were talking about duels then yeah that statement is so wrong because of cheese in 1v1 with wizardishclaymore, 1frameanimation huuue compotwtove game quarterstaff, norse ripostes you cant read past 70 ping (WAAAAAH I HAVE SEVENTY PING WAAAAH = half the compotatove playerbase), etc."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,AllUrMemes,2,Tue May 19 23:57:29 2015 UTC,"Messer is still ez mode.  Drags for days but can also be magically accelerated with high enough sensitivity.  Plus insane damage.  To be honest the Maul and Messer are the only Knight weapons worth using typically, except for the people really skilled with SoW.  I don't use either of these because its boring but when I use Grand Mace or Poleaxe I am acutely aware its strictly for style points."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Kreittis,2,Wed May 20 09:11:40 2015 UTC,"As much trouble as these weapons give players, I don't think they should be nerfed or reworked too much.  It does take a certain amount of skill to execute good drags and reverses.  Not to mention the combos look pretty cool. You can avoid most drags and reverses through good footwork.  If that doesn't work then the problem isn't the messer or maul - you are just fighting a really good player who can make most weapons seem OP."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,redditors_r_manginas,1 point,Wed May 20 00:02:43 2015 UTC,"I just think that people have gotten so good with drags and ROH that it has made the Maul and Messer's One-hit-kill power too strong.  I don't think it's any harder to land hits with a Maul or Messer, and in some ways the huge drag window makes it a little easier than other weapons.  So it's just like, why would you not pick the One Hit Kill weapon?"
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,AllUrMemes,4,Wed May 20 19:48:45 2015 UTC,but can also be magically accelerated with high enough sensitivity   lolwut  You are rank 50 but you still don't understand that there is a drag cap for every single weapon so it doesn't matter if you sensitivity is 5000000 or 5?
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,dij_4,8,Wed May 20 21:05:00 2015 UTC,"go easy on him, you are rank 56 while he's only rank 50"
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Kesby,2,Wed May 20 10:20:22 2015 UTC,Its too high.
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Peasant420,3,Wed May 20 12:13:53 2015 UTC,you could have just informed him of the drag cap instead of bringing rank into it.
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Tigers_,1 point,Wed May 20 18:43:28 2015 UTC,"I main'd the messer for a very long time, and once you play mercs you realize that the messer is legitimately overpowered in vanilla  The maul is a no brainer aswell, all you have to master is using matrixes to finish your windup, and go in for the big mother of all trades"
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,johnnyp1231,2,Wed May 20 14:14:37 2015 UTC,"Pretty much everything. I think weapons with broken animations should be removed entirely from competitive play, since nobody is ever going to re-animate them. I don't think many will agree with me though, nor do I think that the game would be significantly improved by weapon changes alone. Edit: I also do not think that ""nerfing"" weapons individually is the correct solution. If you want balance, you have to make everything powerful.  There is really no point in altering weapons if the map pool stays the same. No new maps = no new meta = same old stale shit."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,twoLegsJimmy,2,Wed May 20 14:41:14 2015 UTC,Claymore. Damage reduced AT THE VERY LEAST to be more like SoW.

ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Anstii,8,Tue May 19 22:31:50 2015 UTC,This doesn't add on to the discussion at all...
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,KevinSpacey-,-3,Wed May 20 04:42:20 2015 UTC,How does it not add to the discussion? I'm just saying nothing really needs to be reworked or nerfed.
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Anstii,3,Tue May 19 23:13:00 2015 UTC,"Please explain to me how you could remotely think that vanilla is more balanced than mercs, I'm legitimately blown away by this statement"
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,KevinSpacey-,-3,Wed May 20 13:49:30 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, there's the age old adage ""What isn't broken doesn't need fixing"" And secondly, when you play mercs, you change the entire game. It is no longer Chivalry Medieval Warfare, it's Chivlary: Autistic Neckbeard Edition. Frankly I wouldn't mind playing it, and learning it, but then I couldn't play Medieval Warfare, it's one or the other. Mercs has changed too much, switching between them is possible, but only succeeds in dulling your senses. I'd rather be competitive in a FFA and shit against 5 guys from Meta or Tempest, than good against 10 nerds and awful against the 2000 casuals that play this game."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Anstii,5,Wed May 20 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"You sound soo mad man, chill out. Mercs didn't change everything, it just balanced weapons. It plays the same its just more fair. You've got a very uninformed cookie cutter ignorant opinion on the matter. You think vanilla claymore is balanced? Fork LMB? Archer damage? See you're mad about it because you clearly have no idea what mercs is about and what was specifically changed."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,KevinSpacey-,-2,Wed May 20 18:44:16 2015 UTC,"You ask me to explain my statement, and then you just call me mad and ask me to chill out. I love this behavior in chiv, yet in all official mercs tournaments I can neither teabag, nor name call."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Anstii,3,Wed May 20 20:36:19 2015 UTC,"I said chill out because you're slinging insults like Chivlary: Autistic Neckbeard Edition which is just uncalled for. You're nitpicking lmao, I answered you and this is your response? Going off topic and derailing? I can see we're done here"
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Clayton-BigsB,-1,Wed May 20 22:56:29 2015 UTC,"I'll see you on the vanilla duel server.  Also, I've voiced my reasons for not liking Mercs, in detail many times, and I understand the reasons for some of the changes, but I still don't agree with you for them. I like vanilla chiv, I put up with spear lmbs, I try to beat claymore feinting virgins, and I accept MAA backstabs."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,CavemanMetaBestMeta,2,Wed May 20 23:17:44 2015 UTC,"I don't have the patience/time for vanilla anything, let alone duels. I don't understand how you could favor vanilla over mercs but whatever, all opinion in the end anyways."
ChivalryGame,36jsr5,Keiji99,3,Wed May 20 23:34:19 2015 UTC,"i would agree that mercs isn't perfect.. but this current ""medieval warfare"" is NOT the game I used to play... it's fucking pretty garbage if you would have had experienced any of the really good days and when the game had some actually good states of play in it. It's pretty just garbage spammy hit tradey bullshit fuckup warfare now man.  Mercs is OP. Everything is OP. Everyone dies in like 1.5 seconds and you need 150 FOV to be competitive."
ChivalryGame,36glw2,bi11y10,22,Tue May 19 06:02:30 2015 UTC,The only reason I check this subreddit is for new videos since it's all just clan drama now. I prefer just random montages or commentaries  like what HEXEN/Yarnu/Vertiigo did.

A lot of us still have a long, looong way to go. I think it's important that we have more skilled players making more videos because it helps keep people around who would otherwise leave after ""graduating"" from the low rank servers."
ChivalryGame,36glw2,ACobb,5,Wed May 20 22:26:50 2015 UTC,I think there's two distinct types of videos that you can do. Informative and montage/scrim footage.   Informative videos will mostly appeal to newer players who are trying to improve and learn the game. I doubt many vets are terribly interested in watching a video about CFtP.  Montages and scrim footage have a broader appeal and I think it appeals to both types of players. A good mix of both is probably the best.
ChivalryGame,36glw2,PreparetobePlaned,3,Tue May 19 11:07:10 2015 UTC,"Wi11, definitely continue what you're doing - your videos are always a pleasure to watch (i'm also a big fan of your music selections)! Scrim montages are always enjoyable. I feel like the basic how-to videos are well covered, but more videos covering intermediate/advanced topics would be helpful for the community (e.g. dragging, team engagements, 2 v 1s, how to play the classes properly etc). I'm also a huge fan of single weapon montages (e.g. your polehammer vid) and would love to see you make more"

ChivalryGame,36gl5i,YourMoneyOrYourLife,5,Tue May 19 06:22:04 2015 UTC,"Moe Pork has a bunch of good beginner videos. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1oSCVt4bxJSM3aBf20kQrw  To just generally get good, I would recommend playing some duels, because when you die in a 1v1 you can tell what mistakes you made which led to your death and try to stop doing that. The best players tend to be in classic duel servers (actual gametype is free for all but everyone duels) so if you want to go straight to Chivalry on hard mode you can join those, just bow to someone and if they bow back duel them. You'll probably learn fastest there plus as stealthyrayning said, people can tell you stuff. Normal duel servers are ok too though, they're a little easier cause the people in them aren't as good, so if you want to still win the occasional duel you can go there."

ChivalryGame,36gl5i,sesstreets,4,Tue May 19 13:36:49 2015 UTC,"The game is 55% distance management keeping an eye on your opponents and your friendlies AND where their weapons go when they attack AND how fast that happens.  Beyond that 25% is about parrying, riposting, ftp, cftp, proper attacking, good drags, good feints, good feint reading, etc: Mechanics  20% DO NOT RAGE. This game is VERY abused and has had it's engine pushed to the limits and every animation or mechanic at some point being used and abused in this nonsensical arms race of animation abuse. Learn to laugh and find a group of friends.  While the game is on it's last limb tbh, it's still fun, we have tournaments coming up, and you can always find a few servers with people in them."

The loading screen goes by too quick for me to read it (the struggles of an SSD amirite) and I'm just too lazy to look at keybinds. Much more fun to learn them through playing. I've got down basic movement, fighting, and blocking. And yelling. Obviously yelling. But I don't know how to jump back and shit when someone attacks you. I was in a 1v1 with someone when I was Archer and he was a Vanguard (I think that's what it's called) and he kept jumping around when I'd try to hit him with my shortsword. Luckily I let him hit me and he got cocky so I stabbed him and killed him."

I like goofing off in FFA and see how many people I can get to ally/not kill me. There's always some rank 45-5* player that will never stop trying to kill me (and usually a couple sub-20s). It is pretty funny when they try to pound me for awhile while I just block all their attacks without attacking back and they give up after a bit.
ChivalryGame,36gl5i,HEXENACI,1 point,Wed May 20 00:44:31 2015 UTC,"First, just play alot, you will be bad until you put in at least a couple hundred hours.  I started using a quick weapon (Billhook, claymore, SoW, or Norse) and primarily going MAA. You don't need to learn to drag right away just get good defensively and learn parry timings. With those weapons you can win by just playing solid and riposting at the right times.  Don't push to get good right away, just play to enjoy the game a bit before you really dig into it."

ChivalryGame,36e79d,Louisflakes,14,Mon May 18 18:16:39 2015 UTC,"Current Playerbase Size  Yeah, there's been a substantial drop in NA players.  If you'd like the data, prepare to frown.  From December 2014, there were an average 2447 players, with a peak count of 6127.   In the last 30 days, there's an average of 1116 players, with a peak count of 2149  You don't have to be a math genius to see that over half of the player base has vanished in 6 months. Compare this to Chivalry's  all time player count of January 2013, with average 4867, and peaking with a whopping 23,094 players, and you get an idea for how the game is holding up.  I love this game as much as all of these other great players in the sub do, but that last 30 day figure is probably still an overestimate, and we won't get the real count until the end of the month, but at it's current rate it won't be long until the worldwide average player count is <1000, and we're already at the all time lowest average count anyway.  What caused this drop? Unfortunately I can't give a nice laundry list of answers, but I'd be glad to speculate.   Low level servers, which i'd say helped scare off any players after    ""graduating"" level 15, while at the same time starving the normal servers of players. Lack of support from TB, This one is pretty obvious as any comp player would tell you, and it pretty much drove the community to look to Mercs as the answer. Toxicity in the community, Which may or may not be fair, as many popular games are similarly toxic, (CSGO, DOTA 2)  An 'isolated' Comp scene, Everyone should face the facts that our tourneys and scrims were rarely ""open"" to newer players, who weren't given a fair shot to play smaller 5v5/6v6 TO's and LTS's for a long time, which I personally think greatly contributed to our current state of counting NA clans on one hand. Lastly and most bleakly, Replayability. After 3 years, most casual players get tired of the same day in and day out sword swinging, and some people just won't find it as fun as others, especially if they haven't improved.   How has the game changed over time  Oh let me count the ways, different meta's, tactics and strategies, of course, but more importantly I'd say the game has such a different attitude then it used to have. I know for me it has lost the magic it used to have, I get angry faster when i play it, although i'm leagues ahead of where I was two years ago. The game feels like it's lost it's flavor and is more bland and dry than it used to be.   Teams, at least of recently seem far more fractured than they used to be only months ago. People are playing different games, and with that clan efficacy is far lower than it was before, and people are now sure that since the game is on an overall decline, any reason to take the game extremely seriously is pretty much behind us.   On a plus side it really seems like this sub in particular has grown kinder as new players have given up hope, and its just the rest of us sitting here making memes and Hitler videos.   Giant Slayer, Black Knight, Lazersword, Warmod, and all the other great mods have made Chivalry a more complete expierence, and I have no reservations in saying that the modding community helped to bring and keep more players playing.   Looking Forward  I'm going to refrain from saying things like the game isn't worth saving, or that we should let it die, Or say that the game will always have a player base, or that this is only a temporary drop. Instead here's my piece of advice to anyone who likes having players in this game to stick around.  Be nice, don't rage at new players or vote kick them when you could be positive or even teach them a thing or two. Being negative at this point is only going to drive people away, so consider that before starting a kick or saying something mean spirited.   Besides all this what can I say. None of us can say for sure what the future of this game holds, but to all of your great people I've shared the pleasure of playing it with, Thank you.   Thank you for embracing me into your clans, and sharing stories and jokes in your teamspeaks. Thank you for playing with me in pubs and public games, thank you for teaching me the mechanics and how to be a better teammate. Thank you all for everything, It's been amazing. :D"

ChivalryGame,36e79d,BEACHES_AND_SHORES,5,Tue May 19 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"All the highly successful esports have one thing in common and that's a well defined ranked mode. It's the carrot on a stick approach that keeps your average person coming back. A ranked matchmaking system is absolutely necessary and if you make one of the ranked modes a 5v5 or 6v6 TO it's going to make people familiar with comp strategies early instead of trail by fire. It will also allow people to progressively get better instead of throwing them to the wolves the instant they hit a certain point.  I have about 600 hours in over the last couple years on this game and I had no fucking idea what to do my first couple scrims due to the large part of my experience being 24 man TO servers or duelyards and I blame TB for that. After that experience however I've realized it's probably the most fun I've ever had playing Chivalry even if I get stomped. This experience needs to be replicated. Playing small TOs with people of equal skill just works perfect with this game and I believe would draw people in quickly, and retain them.  Of course this will never happen and I blame TB for not going with a tried and true approach to keeping a multiplayer game buzzing with activity."

It's the carrot on a stick approach that keeps your average person coming back.   I'm not the most actively involved community member but this is the one recommendation I posted on the TB forums a long time ago. Kimiko told me to get involved with a clan. She was right but I never did and now I don't have the time and after years of playing I've lost the drive to play on a competitive level. Like you said, if a small group of friends could jump into a matchmaking system whenever they were all available they would be more inclined to come back and play again to try and get better, or get that rank higher.   Of course this will never happen and I blame TB for not going with a tried and true approach to keeping a multiplayer game buzzing with activity.   Although somewhat true - completely unnecessary."

ChivalryGame,36e79d,Oilystool,3,Wed May 20 15:16:36 2015 UTC,"There has been a noticeable drop in the player base ,that is true. But if Torn Banner wants to grow as a company it would be in their best interests to keep Chivalry going. For the players who stick around the game and play,will be possible future customers of what ever Torn Banner is doing next. A small investment on improving the game should be considered because its a fun game but, it has room for improvement and expansion. if I were to do this I would.   Examine the current learning game curve for the game, around the lower levels It can be a fun experience for the new player,but at higher levels It can be a frustrating experience. Intended of not,some of the games battle mechanics can make for frustrating game play for some players. More content, add more maps,which next patch adds -more gameplay types more achievements.   -Open up the workshop, allow any weapon or helmet,charge if you will, but make all DLC to be hideable on the players side. Give us a menu that allows you to check and uncheck the DLC you want to see. So if you want your Chiv experience to look more on the fantasy side,then you can allow the DLC that fits your taste.   More contests Veteran mode, when you reach 50,lets you reset your level, achievements and special helmets and weapons for veterans, Hosted Tournaments, offer prizes for the best fighters in Chivalry Reform the kick system   Stuff like this would be cool.."
ChivalryGame,36e79d,yrdraziWciretosE,5,Tue May 19 08:37:13 2015 UTC,"Just like the samurai culture in Japan eventually died, so will be the fate of Chivalry. Warrior culture always evolves though, slasher when??"
ChivalryGame,36e79d,YourMoneyOrYourLife,6,Mon May 18 19:51:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should try to ""save"" the community.  The game is relatively old and I think we should just let it die naturally if it wants to do so.  Usually when I see people trying to save a game or community, it just makes things feel sad because they're bound to fail despite all their efforts.  This is a great game and I'd like it to have a nice death, so to speak, instead of having the dwindling fanbase clawing for anything to keep it afloat.  That said, I really think that if there was some Youtuber who was semi-popular and was actually good at the game it would have done wonders for this community, at least when the game was somewhat young.  It'd get more people into the game and these people would have a good idea on how to play instead of mindlessly swinging and thinking drags are exploits.  But its a bit late for that so. again, i don't think there's much we should do except wait for TB's next big project, whatever that is."
ChivalryGame,36e79d,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Mon May 18 18:45:54 2015 UTC,"Bu- bu- but muh Teripper!  On a serious note, I'll probably never let go of chivalry until something can replace it. I was not much of a gamer back then, but since I picked up Chivalry, I have played from 8pm-3am every night. No other game can replace the fun I have had in this game. I'll do whatever I can to try to keep the game alive, even knowing that it will eventually die because I love the game too much. I have nothing better to do anyways."
ChivalryGame,36e79d,YourMoneyOrYourLife,5,Mon May 18 19:40:56 2015 UTC,"Terriper isn't really a casual youtuber, though.  And, IMO, his personality and style of videos doesn't appeal to a great deal of players.  Hexen and Yarnu more come to mind but they quit :("

It's still a fun game to play occasionally, but once it became impossible to ignore the fact that it will never be fixed and made into a viable e-sports title, it lost a lot of shine for most serious players. Why bother to practice so hard to dominate in a game that doesn't have a future? Striving to perfect my play was always the best thing about this game for me, but as soon as it became apparent that it was pointless and impossible with all the bugs, imbalances and inconsistencies, I pretty much lost interest in playing it on any other level than some casual fun to kill half an hour here and there. I know a lot of players went down the same road.  Anyway, no point in trying to save it, just enjoy it for what it is while it still lasts; there are many similar titles coming out in the future. Since tibbs pretty much confirmed that there will be a chiv 2 on the forums recently, it's not so depressing anyway."

I go backwards and forwards on this, but I'm thinking that their unannounced ue4 project is indeed chiv 2 at the moment, and they're staying quiet on it because they're trying to solve the problems like the one talked about in that thread, without having to molleycoddle and placate the famously lovely and cuddly hardcore chiv fanbase all the time."
ChivalryGame,36e79d,arenagamer,3,Tue May 19 14:19:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely not this.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j73cxLiqc2U  Of course its worth trying. I think we can all agree that the game itself is great! Sure there are small things to bitch about here and there, but at the end of the day we have an awesome first person slasher that has skill-dependent game mechanics, awesome art design and amazing (often hilarious) sound.   The problem is not the game. The problem has always been Torn Banner's marketing  and promotion.  Why aren't they having a sale every other weekend at this point?  Why aren't they hosting official tournaments and offering some kind of prize pool? Even if its a few hundred bucks it would be cool to have an official tournament.   Why aren't they adding more official maps?  Why aren't they paying twitch streamers that already get a ton of views to play some Chivalry every now and then?  These are the reasons the player base is dwindling. Marketing."
ChivalryGame,36e79d,arenagamer,3,Mon May 18 20:45:51 2015 UTC,"The problem is not the game. The problem has always been Torn Banner's marketing and promotion.   I honestly really disagree with you here, so I'll talk about it a little bit. I don't have another suggestion right now for what the problem is, but I don't think this is it   Why aren't they having a sale every other weekend at this point?   Chivalry has been on sale so, so, so, soooo many times. Both on Steam, on humble bundle, on gog, on so many other sites. It's not uncommon to see chivalry be on the front page of sales during the esteemed steam winter sale and has seen a lot of free weekends, one of the few games to do it as often as it has. They don't need sales that often, I think that would bring stuff down if anything, but they have done a great job with sales so far.   Why aren't they hosting official tournaments and offering some kind of prize pool? Even if its a few hundred bucks it would be cool to have an official tournament.   After kicking in a few thousands dollars, I believe, in the infamous 'bigs' tourney I'd imagine they would be hesitant to continue. This tourney really hurt chiv as a whole, had a lot of salt and failures in it, and was terrible for torn banner and the community. I would imagine they learned their lesson.   Why aren't they adding more official maps?   I mean, they added more maps in the second half of chiv's life than they did for the first half. They started and fostered the community driven maps in a huge way and now they are our regular every-day maps.   Why aren't they paying twitch streamers that already get a ton of views to play some Chivalry every now and then?   Do companies actually do that? Chiv has gained a lot of popularity from youtubers and some big streamers back in the earlier days and still often nowadays  Anyhow, I think that they could have approached things better. They certainly didn't do it perfectly. However, I think you had some misinformation that led you to make a poor conclusion."
ChivalryGame,36e79d,Killua-,4,Mon May 18 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"No, I disagree.    Chivalry has been on sale so, so, so, soooo many times.   At this point Chivalry isn't a new game. Regular price should be no more than $14.99 and sale price should probably be $4.99. Obviously cost is a big factor for new players. Yes, they have had many sales, they need to continue to do so. Except better.    This tourney really hurt chiv as a whole, had a lot of salt and failures in it, and was terrible for torn banner and the community. I would imagine they learned their lesson.   Again, your defeatism is showing through here. Is ""their lesson"" to give up? So they fucked up a tournament in the past. Does that mean they should never attempt to host one again? Of course not.  Official Tournaments raise a lot of interest in games like this. You learn from your mistakes and you do better. You look a the successes of other games and you adopt what works and drop what doesn't work.   On a related note, WHY HASN'T TB PUT A LITTLE WORK INTO MAKING CHIV MORE SPECTATOR FRIENDLY?   They could add in some sweet overlays like CS:GO does so that the spectators will have more information about the players. It would not even entail that much work; its not just a priority for TB.    Do companies actually do that? Chiv has gained a lot of popularity from youtubers and some big streamers back in the earlier days and still often nowadays   Frequently. And no, Chiv is not popular on twitch right now. I know many of us watch a lot of chiv youtube videos, but the exposure is very limited in terms of the newer content.  I'm not knocking what's out there; I think a lot of people are doing a great job with their Chiv youtube content. I just wish the interest was there for new viewers to be directed to it.     However, I think you had some misinformation that led you to  make a poor conclusion.   I don't think its a poor conclusion because it differs from ""do nothing"""
ChivalryGame,36e79d,YourMoneyOrYourLife,5,Mon May 18 21:35:38 2015 UTC,"Sales I disagree on, but I don't really have a solution to offer   WHY HASN'T TB PUT A LITTLE WORK INTO MAKING CHIV MORE SPECTATOR FRIENDLY?   They did include tournament mode within the last 12 months as well as the new ui that both made spectating nicer.   It would not even entail that much work   I think it would be a lot of work for the hundred people who would get something out of it  As for the youtube content, I think that the people who are actually known in chiv obviously don't provide to a larger community. However, there are still some people with millions of subs that have posted the odd youtube video that gave chiv a lot of attention"

We've got a decent community here, Height and some others have held a decent number of tournaments, comp scene is still kicking...

ChivalryGame,36e79d,Charles_K,4,Tue May 19 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"There is no future for chivalry, only the genre, hopefully in the eSports scene. It has ridiculous spectator potential with virtually no level of knowledge necessary to foster an enjoyable viewer experience.  I think the answer to 99% of Chivalry's problems is user interface. A good user interface will literally keep people addicted. You can seamlessly integrate a great UI into microtransactions, in-game spectating, rewards systems, ranked and un-ranked matchmaking, balance feedback (and statistics), leader boards, community shit posting, BANS, tournaments, prize pools, user created content (maps and hats), etc.   User interface will make or break a game, regardless of how good or bad the mechanics are. But yeah, we should just keep changing and rechanging windup times... I'm sure new players will appreciate the milliseconds of difference on all of the flawlessly animated pole weapons."

ChivalryGame,36citr,_autodidact,13,Mon May 18 07:58:24 2015 UTC,"Opening up balancing to absolutely everyone makes no sense. Like anything in life, not everyone's input is qualified or weighed equally. The idea of having informed, minimally biased individuals on a council that actually represent their respective clan members (bringing their concerns/ideas to meetings) makes more sense than anything else. And yeah, everybody’s going to have a fit when deciding who actually is an ‘informed, minimally biased individual’. As for this new NA mod versus MERCs, I don't get why it has to be a Crushed versus Height kind of deal, as if either had full control over the events that led up to the split. Crushed made a solid mod that the competitive scene fully embraced, and is a monumental step up from vanilla. No one's going to take that away, no one is trying to. From my understanding, disagreements became too common, disrespect started running too high, the salt factor increased, and the balance council was a shadow of its formal self. For Crushed to blame Height for the fallout is silly, especially since I haven't seen Height make his own full-blown statement yet in defense.  The real concern that people who actually care about the comp scene should be focused on is making sure every clan commits to ONE mod. We all know how fragile the scene is to begin with, and splitting between two mods is going to destroy it completely.  And finally, to end my most-likely pointless rant, where are all the sensible people on this subreddit? Seems to me we have a massive imbalance of trolling-to-true-opinion-sharing ratio. Would be great to get some input from the non-troll members of the community, you know?"

You know, I was a bit bummed for not being invited to bolonce council at first but if I really felt like I had something to say, I still had Plasticeracer, Keys, and Infrenol to talk to give bolonce suggestions to at the time.

Even if it had more EU players not too many would want to talk about balance at 4 AM. The scenes are different in many aspects 'hence both sides would have different kinds of input. From an archer's perspective some weapons aren't used at all in EU but considered maybe even OP in NA and vise versa. That is because there aren't enough good archers in one scene to main every single viable weapon and people tend to use the same weapons.

The less people you have voting the easier it is to make huge changes with little input or insight despite the opinions people may get from outside sources. The duty will always fall upon those even fewer members and the mod will probably tend to reflect their interests over those of everyone else.

On Friday 13th, 1307 a papal bull was issued condemning the Holy Order The English way if saying fuck you,involved holding up your index and middle fingers, legend had it when the French captured a longbowman they would cut off their drawing fingers toake sure they would never fire a bow again. The gesture was used as an act of defiance when fighting the French. Longbows required such strength that bodies of dead longbowman oftan have enlarged bones on their drawing arm The crossbow was invented in ancient China,hundreds of years before the medieval period.   -The longbow,often associated with the English was actually Welsh,but was adapted by the English after they subjugated the welsh.

It's hard to actually know due to the unreliability of sources, translation errors, and many just being folktales and myths.  For example, take the Children's Crusade, which might not actually be little kids travelling to the Holy Land and becoming enslaved. Some sources say children as ""Children of God."" Translation errors are also still possible, as the name ""Children's Crusade"" is peregrinatio puerorum in latin. Apparently, Puer not only means child, but servant/churl. Most accounts claim that the band of crusaders never even made it to Italy, as they lacked the funds to travel there on boats from Italy.  It could quite definetely not have any children involved at all, or just be very exaggerated. No reliable sources of the time can confirm the whole event. Would make a great movie though."

A study published in 1977 casts doubt on the existence of these events, and many historians came to believe that they were not (or not primarily) children but multiple bands of ""wandering poor"" in Germany and France, some of whom tried to reach the Holy Land and others who never intended to do so. Early versions of events, of which there are many variations told over the centuries, are largely apocryphal.

Knights were the warrior elite in the Medieval world, the Man at Arms was the professional paid solider and the archers were the hated underclass,often criminals pardoned into service for their freedom. In 1415 King Henry V of England with a small army consisting mostly of archers, defeated a French force of heavily mounted Knights, close to three times their size. The English lost some 100 men,while French losses numbered in the 7000-1000 range. The battle decimated the French Nobility.   -During a siege, an infirm Richard the Lionheart, was carried around in a stretcher,shooting at targets during the siege.

ChivalryGame,36ak0g,ExtremistShakiraFan,3,Mon May 18 12:13:07 2015 UTC,"As a Medieval Historian I have a very minor gripe with the 2nd bullet.  A knight was simply a noble man of whom may or may not have been trained since birth. By the time Chivalry Medieval Warfare takes place (which would be around the late 15th century going by the presence of German Maximillian Armor and the early Milanese armor types. This however gets strange when Vangaurds wear obsolete 12th century heavy armor and Great Helms which fell out of favor by the 3rd Crusade) becoming a knight was extreamly expensive to the point where ""true"" knights trained from childhood with a complement of trainers and squires started to dwindle. By then a Man at Arms was simply a trained man in plate armor while a knight would be a train nobleman in plate armor. The two where not much different besides the knight being loaded and having good connections in politics.  Another thing is archers (in the nations that had the ecosystem for good bows and the money for producing them), while not respected in most places, where largely respected in England. They where not the highest order nor would they ever be but the English saw their worth and focused heavily on their production and use in the grand battleplan. Britain (as in the Island) itself had the advantage of having copious amounts of Yew wood. Henry the V of England, after reforming and fixing the English economy which was struggling at the time appointed a Fletcher by the name of Nicholas Mynot to get to setting up the foundation of a nationwide arrow production system. Over 1.1 million Goose Feathers would be used for a single campaign as thousands of arrows where produced for the war against the French. Most nations would have archers as little more than hunter boys that used game bows made from cheap wood and arrows made in their spare time. The English however put great effort into their bow and arrow production which is why English Longbow men are what people think of when they imagine archers. Massive longbows firing at 200 yards that can pierce armor and rain constant hell. All this took a massive amount of mass production and training that wasn't seen on such scales regularly until the 1740's when the industrial revolution started to kick off. So archers where far more respected than say an English spear Levi. At least so in the British Isles.

ChivalryGame,36ak0g,redditors_r_manginas,2,Thu May 21 11:35:11 2015 UTC,"Was the third point referring to the Battle of Agincourt?  English archers were indeed prominent there but not particularly against the mounted knights. I'm unsure of the source but I believe it had something to do with the muddy terrain that gave the English a huge advantage over the cavalry. When they were dismounted by halberd formations & such the knights were pretty much screwed as they got sucked into the mud and were finished off by pretty much every soldier carrying a rondel dagger, an edgeless dagger with only a point and a flat pommel. The dagger was typically intended to finish off fallen enemies / knights in particular as the flat pommel allowed it to be hammered in with the off-hand and driven through the visors of fallen knights.  For clarity I'm not attributing English success to the rondel lol, just an interesting weapon & tactic employed. I'm unsure how the French lost but I know for certain that the longbows did not contribute greatly to beating the cavalry, unless their horses were vulnerable?"
ChivalryGame,369faf,elwebbaro,11,Sun May 17 13:46:35 2015 UTC,"OP, it's possible that those small suits of armor weren't crafted for full grown men. After full plate armor became less prevalent due to the development of firearms, suits of full plate were still every now and then extravagantly made for the young brats of lords for parades and such :P  Although those small suits of armor looked rather fit for battlefield use, so I'm unsure as to who they were made for. Interesting speculation, though."

ChivalryGame,369faf,Siduss,1 point,Mon May 18 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"They would often test a suit of armour with a musket shot to prove that the armour could stop one. That could explain the dents. It is true that on average people were smaller due to nutrition, but the kind of people who wore suits of armour were by no means average, they were the lords and highly paid professional soldiers who would be fed well their whole life, and would therefore be taller than the average man of the time. That makes me think that the small suits of armour would be for the kids, maybe for training? Alternatively they may be adult pieces not assembled to their full height."

Many players leave after they hit rank 16 for the exact reasons you describe.   Once you reach rank 16,you can't go back. Your only option is another account.   I can suggest you watch some how to videos to learn more;  Moe Pork is a dedicated channel to show you game mechanics (but hasn't had any updates for a while)   Teripper has many many tactics and how to vids (some of the earlier ones are out of date by now) and he's pretty entertaining.   There are others who show advanced tactics, but start with these two.   If you have not played the tutorial yet, play that.   Feel free to ask questions, either here or in game.   Do you have any specific questions right now that I can help with?"

I started regularly kinda-sorta breaking even in TO after 150 hours.  If you're from EU, where there are mutliple populated servers, you should look for non-stacked servers. Servers with approx 33/33/33 percent division between ranks 25+, 30+ and 40/50+ can be found and this is where you should play. Sometimes you can join a server where 20 out of 30 players are ranks 47-55, leave immediately, you won't be able to do anything.  Pick Messer, it's the easiest to use and easiest to do well with. Learn to riposte -it's crucial. Stay close to your team, don't go lone-wolfing. Try not to get frustrated for the next 100+ hours. After you struggled through tough times and you're able to do decently it'll be all fun."

I'm usually playing with 100 to 120 ping though. So I have to be a little faster to parry. Most Australian's can't read feints due to inexperience as well though. Most the community frowns on feinting. So feinting hardly exists.

Sometimes he gets a name wrong or something but I think he is the most consistent and popular Chiv youtuber atm.  ohyouhanz still uploads leet montages from time to time just like cologne stark.  CRUSHED used to upload dank vids, the best was him pwning Sophax (best Knight NA+EU+JPN combined, most op class then any other) but unfortunately he took it down because it threatened the very balance of mercs mod and Chivalry as a whole."

ChivalryGame,368a2k,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,0,Sun May 17 05:53:34 2015 UTC,"Personally, I found that Crush caused more problems than anything. He took weeks to implement new things, put in ghost changes, would refuse to add in things he didn't like (I am not going to implement) until we had to almost force him to, and in general just be toxic. Before, he refused to change mercs on 1.9, but later removed his comment on the 1.9 thread and reverted the audio changes only after people got really pissed at him. He only changed it back because of the negative backlash. We actually couldn't scrim lg today because everytime you kill somebody it makes a loud blowhorn noise. This stupid act was just the last straw.  He might of made Mercs mod, but that doesn't mean he can just troll and make the whole competitive scene look like a big joke.  It's not too hard to grab somebody else who can plug in numbers to a code and not cause a bunch of problems. It's easy to understand why TB doesn't bother with Mercs now, when it's just a joke to the founder of the mod. And for me, that's why I choose to not deal with Mercs or Crush anymore."

ChivalryGame,368a2k,cienade,3,Mon May 18 19:53:49 2015 UTC,"Slow down there bud, first of all I never took weeks to implement anything - a few days max after I have gotten the changelog and only one time it took a week because I was buy with RL stuff and noone gave me a proper changelog. Most of the time it was on the same day or 1-2 days after. I never added ghost changes, this is a dumb myth and I'm not sure why you believe it. The only ""ghost changes"" were the longsword in the initial release of Mercs that was in there in a while cause I forgot about it. I would have given anyone the source code if they had doubts and asked me about it, but noone ever did.  The reason there was a bit of hesitation on some things was because there was some flat out dumb changes, which also got reverted later. If I wouldnt have been so critical of some of you MERCS would have gone to shit real fast.  I did not comment on that 1.9 thread and nor did I remove any comment. I was going to revert the silly stuff today morning - I did it earlier because people where whined to me like a little kid getting his toy taken away. Literally tears, its very embarassing and rather sad. I actually convincingly told some EU players that this would be permanent as joke and noone got mad at me or asked for a revert. Honestly we had a blast in EU which is all that matters to me.  Im sorry you couldnt do that one scrim. I have been told by Height that I caused a PR disaster and caused irreparable political damage.   Take a deep breath and let that sink in for a minute, this is a dying game with less then 60 NA comp players. Wake the fuck up. This is a mod on a silly game that happens to be competitive out of pure luck. Its not a big mainstream esport title. Just shows you have zero respect for mercs and how it improved the game with the initial release of it. If you couldnt handle a few hours of some silly sounds then you dont deserve this. I had a bad feeling about height and the council when it started, but honestly spook, Omega and some others saved it. RAW and zombo etc agree'd with me that the council was quite a joke and if I wasnt as ""toxic"" or ""difficult do deal with"" it would have gone to shit.  Maybe I shouldve just uploaded it as a seperate mod so this was a dumb thing to do, lesson learned. I'm sorry you missed your one scrim in those 5 hours the shit was up - hope it didnt cause any serious lasting damage for missing that."

ChivalryGame,368a2k,faktorfaktor,1 point,Sun May 17 21:52:12 2015 UTC,So you only include the skins that aren't accepted into the normal game? Do you just do it right away or ask the creator first?
ChivalryGame,368a2k,redditors_r_manginas,2,Sun May 17 21:58:02 2015 UTC,Theres no point including skins that are already in the game because.. they are already there. I cant do it right away because I need the packages/files of the skins so ofcourse I talk to the creators first. So far everyone I asked has been supportive of this.

They had infiltrated all branches of government. They would pull strings to get phone numbers, P.O. Boxes, Addresses, Number plates etc. with as many doubled digits as possible. They were friends with secretaries and clerks. This was their primary method of bringing members into the fold. It was a way to establish seniority. Prospective members would get a single DUB assigned to them. A single dub is common enough so as to not arouse suspicion. More senior members would then perform a background check on the prospective member. I got on my bike one evening and followed the scary men to their secret meeting at a cultural heritage site. I thought it was like a satanic cult or something. They powered each other up by sucking each others dicks. They had buttsex. They performed the strangest dances imaginable. It was Crushed and his band of lackeys."

My advice is to watch some videos from higher-level players like terriper and just playing with the intent to improve specific skills, such as blocking, footwork, dragging, etc.  And, IMO, forget about ROHs."

ChivalryGame,367i5p,Mestarrr,0,Sun May 17 03:27:09 2015 UTC,"There are three four different ""levels"" of players in this game. Basically it goes something like this.   Those who can't drag Those who can drag but don't know how to FtP or CFtP (feint to parry, combofeint to parry)  Those who do know how to drag, FtP and CFtP, but can't read feints Those who are good at reading and punishing feints and know how to use all mechanics to their advantage"
ChivalryGame,367i5p,MajorGrempington,1 point,Sun May 17 10:07:16 2015 UTC,"Not really,   There's at least three more levels to add to that.  It's not just about reading feints and performing drags. There's some mindgaming aswell. Using your footwork to control the pressure on your enemy and on yourself, matrixing (in my opinion knowing how to matrix changes the warhammer for example from being half decent to being downright op)   This is also why duels are not enough because you learn how to use your footwork mkre efficiently faster in team gamemodes, especially when teamed against. And that skill carries back to dueling"
ChivalryGame,367i5p,Mestarrr,1 point,Sun May 17 00:53:13 2015 UTC,"Of course those four levels don't cover every aspect, just a general guideline to different levels of play most players go through, or a level they are comfortable at and aren't interested in rising up from.  Typical pubbers fall into one of those categories pretty strictly IMO, but at higher skill levels it becomes much more complicated and you can't categorise different types of players anymore. Inexperienced players always have at least one of those three big holes in their defense, and they really can't compete (at least 1v1) with anyone who is at the ""fourth level"".   Matrixing was something I forgot to add though, but in my experience it's something you could start to learn at pretty much any level - something that usually comes when learning good footwork.   And I'm of course talking about 1v1 situations, teamwork is a totally different entity and changes the dynamic between players."
ChivalryGame,367i5p,Manzanis,1 point,Sun May 17 02:59:05 2015 UTC,"I know how to CFtP and can read feints with the weapons that have readable feints, but CFtP is for scrubs. I don't use it, because it uses a broken game mechanic to avoid the need for good accuracy and timing."

That's why these message boards, where you have to SAY what you mean, are so popular with My People. And no, this isn't pasta. It's not. It's something born from the casual way the term 'autist' is thrown around on the boards. A douchebag is not necessarily autistic . A neurotic is not necessarily autistic. Someone who is meticulous and dislikes misrepresentation or just made-up bullshit confusing things is not necessarily an autist."

ChivalryGame,35unso,aleatoric,7,Wed May 13 19:37:13 2015 UTC,"you'll be hard pressed to find much like them. Sonically, Beirut has an Eastern European flavor but are more in the direction of folk and less away from lo-fi indie. Fanfarlo's in the same boat. If you want something more abrasive, maybe Andrew Jackson Jihad.   Lyrically it's hard to find anything that matches as well. Sufjan Stevens is up there, and maybe The Mountain Goats (John Darnielle) although he has a far different style in both delivery and tone (more plainspoken). Early Mountain Goats will hit on that lo-fi edge some. Phil Elvrum (The Microphones, Mount Eerie) deserves mention as well, although not for being completely similar but for being image-driven music with a distinct style of its own that can't really be compared to anyone else. He also frequently transitions between softer acoustic music and much louder, dissonant music."
ChivalryGame,35unso,heechum,2,Wed May 13 20:18:22 2015 UTC,"Andrew Jackson Jihad, Sufjan Stevens, and The Mountain Goats are amazing. Violent Femmes are also really good! Giles Corey is a different genre but it is probably my all-time favorite band along with Have A Nice Life."

Moving up In the world!  But Yea its too bad they couldn't do it on ps4, that would be so much better..  As for your archer predicament... Is it possible to use mouse and keyboard on chiv on ps3? Cause its pretty much impossible to play archer without keys and mouse"
ChivalryGame,35v43c,XXLpeanuts,1 point,Thu May 14 01:13:46 2015 UTC,No M&K support but the PS4 does allow M&K if you choose to use it
ChivalryGame,35v43c,MrJoeSteam,2,Thu May 14 01:53:45 2015 UTC,"For real, you can plug and play m+k to ps4?"
ChivalryGame,35v43c,feeeggsdragdad,1 point,Fri May 15 11:40:22 2015 UTC,"Only if the developers of a game allow it. Yes any developer has the option to allow keyboard and mouse. I think its a great way to help disabled gamers. Mostly games that were or are on pc have it. You can play WarThunder with a M&K, or you can play Warframe with a M&K etc there is also a device called XIM4 that let's you play ANY console with a keyboard and mouse if that's your thing. I don't see a problem with it as I mostly play all games with aim assist off and eventually learn to aim better without it but a few people arnt too happy which is understandable. (In this case it'd be understandable that they'd allow console chiv to use it as its not that hard to aim a sword and you really don't have that big an advantage against controllers unless you were an archer."
ChivalryGame,35v43c,heechum,9,Fri May 15 11:52:03 2015 UTC,"I believe they said something awhile back about it, saying that the newer consoles would be harder for them to work with.. Chivalry imo would be great on the PS4. PS3 version seems like such shit and heavily downgraded. If it was made on ps4, it would probably be so much better and more like the PC version. PCMASTERRACE is a true fact, but anyone who also comments on this lets not call this guy a faggot, he probably as a better spine than us because he gets to use a couch."
ChivalryGame,35v43c,DasHeadCrapHGN,2,Wed May 13 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"Your right, he already knows hes a console peasant no reason to shame him more. I would also advise not using a controller too often since it'll give you a severe disadvantage."

Seriously PC can be used with or without controllers, there's tons of different custom gamepads like the Nostomo and a PC can be hooked up in the living room to a massive HD flatscreen TV and commanded via wireless mouse and keyboard. Not to mention my desk PC can just have a lazy boy or a comfy office chair brought to it with spinal support designed for my back. Stop with these ""hur durr PC guys can't play on the couch"" arguments. It just makes you look like a colossal idiot that doesn't know jack shit about hardware or home furniture.  To clarify this isn't an argument of PC vs Console. I'm only debating his little joke about PC users not having the option to game on the couch."

ChivalryGame,35qj2z,bi11y10,10,Tue May 12 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"You can backpedal them fairly easy  You dont even need to block reverses, you can just run the opposite direction the second you think hes going to spin, he will miss completely, and if he feints he just wasted his time and stamina and probably confused himself ;P  EDIT: forgot to add you can dodge knight reverse overheads with simple leanback matrixes, reverse lmb thats a different story though ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) dem eu strats"
ChivalryGame,35qj2z,Kesby,2,Tue May 12 19:54:42 2015 UTC,They always wind up facing backwards from you after missing. They seem so lost for about one second. I love it.
ChivalryGame,35qj2z,gentlemandinosaur,4,Wed May 13 01:55:48 2015 UTC,Because people have gotten good at reverse overheads and people have gotten good at blocking them. It's the natural next step in the meta.
ChivalryGame,35qj2z,Alice_Ex,3,Tue May 12 22:46:47 2015 UTC,Who blocks them? I just back pedal and they miss... And I stab the shit out them laugh and dance around.
ChivalryGame,35qj2z,gentlemandinosaur,7,Wed May 13 01:57:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, a MAA's S key is far more overpowered than any reverse overhead.  Sometimes you need to stop pressing S, though. Like when there's enemies or a wall behind you."

ChivalryGame,35qj2z,Manzanis,3,Sat May 16 15:29:37 2015 UTC,"I roh feint a decent amount because good players can parry your reverse overhand. and since the Roh feint is such a flash, you're immediately in a balanced position: You can either hit the enemy, as they are in parry recovery, or you can defend against whatever the hell else is happening.  ROH feints fall under my category of ""Seems like a good idea at the time"" and they rarely let me down. Because my playstyle is basically a combonation of feint sales and gambles, it works pretty well."
ChivalryGame,35qj2z,cienade,4,Tue May 12 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"Facehug stab feints are already hard enough, we don't need ROH feints.  Of course ROH feints are effective, but they're cheesy as fuck and unreadable in my opinion. I've been playing Grand Mace lately and I'm liking it. One of the downsides is that you don't have very good feints besides the stab which doesn't do that much damage, but it's not like I'm gonna ROH feint just so I can get that kill."

Reverse overheads are stupid with the gmace but you can defend against them if you know the other person won't feint it."

If you feel like it, you can create two keybind 'presets' and bind them to your numpad, so that numpad1 activates MAA mode and numpad2 activates other-mode."

ChivalryGame,35qcsg,a_fookin_T-Rex,3,Wed May 13 12:47:19 2015 UTC,I think you mean Double-tap dodge.   It's still there; look in the Configuration > Game menu to find it and adjust the slider.  Also uncheck One Button Dodge.  Doubletap takes more time to activate and I disabled it using .ini tweaks because I found myself accidentally dodging while trying to WASD. (I use stutter steps to bait people)
ChivalryGame,35qcsg,Reithur,1 point,Wed May 13 15:18:46 2015 UTC,"Okay I will take another look, thank you. I know it is slower but I don't use MAA much anyway but back when I did I got used to double tapping."

Or, you can get a mouse that does mouse profiles like mine, even though I don't use them."

Post 15 was a wake up call for me and it wasn't fun at first.  The absence of low rank servers are a blessing in disguise friend.
ChivalryGame,35pcc2,JckFox,7,Tue May 12 17:03:32 2015 UTC,"Chivalry life begins at rank 16.   Before that, its just lmb."
ChivalryGame,35pcc2,arenagamer,6,Tue May 12 21:55:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah because going against level 50s who are using every trick in the book at you sucks when you're level 0-5 and are trying to learn how to use different attacks instead of just LMB. You don't know what you're doing, let alone anyone else. That first 15 levels is just a practice of core mechanics instead of being actually competitive, and it's actually pretty decent at teaching you how to deal with players for the first 8 hours or so. Bad habits made in 10 hours are easy to fix. Forcing low levels into the bloodbath is just frustrating and hard and makes people quit.   Tl;dr: you have to learn to crawl before you can walk before you can run. We shouldn't force people who can't crawl to fight people who are Olympic sprinters."

ChivalryGame,35nsgs,Charles_K,5,Tue May 12 00:56:36 2015 UTC,"It's better than that. When you're on 32 player servers with decent ping and you get those equally distributed levels; the game feels SO much more polished, fun, and exciting. If you're low leveled then you can run with a higher level and see REAL fighting and not LMB festivals. If you're high leveled then you get a chance to feel like a god against the noobs of course BUT there will probably be a few other 50s slinking around waiting to pounce and you being aware of them will make you a better player."

ChivalryGame,35nsgs,Reithur,3,Wed May 13 15:39:25 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, the reason some clans do that is because quite a few casual players aren't focused on the more organized aspects of teamplay, or in some cases, the objective itself. Unfortunately, those that aren't focused on the teamplay usually aren't rallied by an impassioned plea to rush a cart or defend a point.  It sucks that there's such a divide due to that point, but for many comp players, especially newer clans that need the practice, that's the only way they can strengthen themselves when other clans aren't available."
ChivalryGame,35nsgs,ExileTheWolf,2,Tue May 12 01:11:10 2015 UTC,I have no problem with like 4 clan dudes on one side in a 32 player game. But when you are playing against a team that's almost entirely one clan it gets annoying.

ChivalryGame,35lglf,SiberianHAMMY,14,Mon May 11 13:55:21 2015 UTC,"THE CLAYTON WALL OF TEXT SPECIAL!!!  the big things for me are that torn banner tried to remove flinch in release which I thought would be great considering how inconsistent flinch in release was (sometimes it happened sometimes it didn't kind of thing). So they attempted to fix it but instead kind of made flinching itself very inconsistent which leads to people just swinging and hit trading all the time. Considering you only need a certain bit of distance from someone to complete a windup, and even less for short windup weapons... almost every attack from 2 relatively even windup speed weapons results in a hit trade. This leads to more weapons being obsolete because they just don't do damage. Now the topkek weapons in the game at least pub wise and even comp are like maul, zwei, messer, norse, claymore.   This also led to the addition of what we refer to as ""Aimpunch"" in which when you hit trade or when you SHOULD hit trade, and one hit hits slightly earlier and makes the other person's strike invalid with a combination of knockback and tracer modification. So this not only in a way flinches you causing your attack to not do any damage, but it also utilizes your stamina since you technically missed a swing as well. That makes this new gem SO MUCH WORSE than the original flinch in release. Also, archers can do this with their arrows, so flinch was taken away from archer arrows, but now they do this aimpunch thing which is 100x worse than flinching IMO because they do damage and stam drain. Furthermore, you might even get hit 2 times in the process because instead of landing a hit, you go into attack recovery.  A lot of bullshit in the game that also doesn't make sense is why hitting someone and going into attack recovery is longer than flinch recovery, so they essentially get the initiative after being hit. This was not really patch affected but it's just another gripe I have with the game that makes no fucking sense to me.  Then there's the archer ""nerf""... they took away like 10-15 damage off the light crossbow, and nerfed broadheads so that they don't 1 shot archers, as well as taking the backstab bonus away. So, the backstab bonus being gone is pretty great, but lets face it, if you get hit by an arrow you're pretty much fucked in like 1-2 hits anyway, and with weapons like the shortsword, if you land a stab the 2nd overhead off the combo is pretty much free if you do it right. The game also has a 4 archer limit, but that doesn't seem to affect the archer dominance and them controlling the entire game still.  Charge attacks are still as fucked up as ever, they did have one patch that actually seemed to make them more consistent, but then the patch or 2 after just fucked them all up again.  Sprint speeds and 3rd person animations are complete garbage (3rd person being what you see the other people doing, not the animations you see of yourself while in 3rd person). There are weapons liek claymore and norse sword in which the game can literally not animate fast enough to keep up with their speed. The shield norse combo is quite a gem, and with both these weapons they have the added ability of being able to desync the game with ease.  Oh speaking of sprint speed, we now have the Nitrous fast and the furious modification so that the chase mechanic still is slow as fuck to initiate, but when it does you go into paul walker mode and speed into battle like a fucking nightmare. I'll be fighting someone and see no one within 100 yards, then all of a sudden as if a thief in the night i've got some dickweed stabbing me in the asscrack.  You've got these knights running around to where I never feel like i'm as fast when I move around because I feel like a slug, yet they somehow run around like vanguards probabaly getting the chase boost out of someone that triggered the chase mech from a mile away. Then you've got the vanguards hitbox which is as thin as a piece of string it seems when they dance around with their swords running in and out of combat like a racecar. You can't even hit them and land your combo because by the time that happens they've continued to sprint out of range not skipping a beat.  Did I mentioned archers are still little fucksticks and probably the most powerful class in the game still?  I've also got other issues of my own where the game decided to skip right at the moment I either need to parry, or read a feint, or some bullshit. Citadel still crashes. Most maps have horrid FPS. 32 man servers rein supreme and are completely imbalanced always being WAY easier to defend and nigh impossible for the attacking team.  Should I go on or am I salty enough?"

Hell i'll cleave through like 10 of them usually before going down but come prime hours of chiv when the big boys come on and you have like 1-2 good archers on defense as well as some actually competent melee, it's pretty much impossible on certain maps."

ChivalryGame,35lglf,LordKefkaPalazzo,2,Mon May 11 14:04:48 2015 UTC,"Except this game wasn't designed with that as an intended mechanic.   It's not 'git gud' when an advanced player is whooping your ass with b0ckswing feints, drags are never explained in the tutorial beyond a basic level, feint animations are REALLY dumb, and just the overall way the game was handled by the devs makes it so that 'the more techniques people learn' aren't actually techniques but just tryhards trying to get an edge on tryhards and breaking the game even further."

Notably, Archer backstab has been removed, Chase Mechanic was buffed, Vanguard Footspeed was buffed, MAA Dodge was nerfed.  I recall something about Knight Stamina being buffed, but can't remember.  As Kefka states, more people have learned how to do more advanced techniques.  Many How-To vids can be found on Youtube, so people have access and exposure to techniques that were once taught only in clan duelyards.  Some examples are Backswings (reverse overheads), Combo-Feint-to-Parry and advanced drag techniques like Waterfalls or Fake Reverse Overheads.  Aside from the above techniques, a widespread tactic these days is to put on a high damage weapon and hit-trade everyone to victory.  Not particularly skillful, but it's ez mode."

If you become a regular player on a few servers you'll get to know the other regs.   The in-game chat can be pretty toxic and  generally attention seeking so it's worthwhile to ignore it or turn it off in the options if it's a particularly bad night. The public player base seems to be younger so you can expect that sort of vibe throughout most of the experience.   People definitely get pissed at TKs and excessive team damage and will vote kick for it. If you show that you're trying to learn and you don't just ignore the issue (ie, not apologizing in chat for TKs or obviously bad damage), people will generally understand because we've all been there before.  I'd pick up the game especially if you can get it for <10 bucks but try to bring a friend with you--it'll make learning a lot more fun and the chat more bearable haha. Chivalry has a steep learning curve and is almost impossible to master but it's an incredibly satisfying experience. It's well worth your time if you like a challenge and don't mind a commitment."

ChivalryGame,35dazd,nsto,8,Sat May 9 05:17:32 2015 UTC,"Howdy. The reason the server feels laggy is to do with how Chivalry and the Unreal Engine is coded. The Unreal Engine is very CPU dependent as is and adding more players increases the performance hit.   To break it down let's go over what the CPU does while in game. The CPU is responsible for many things. Most importantly the CPU draws everything. The more draw calls you have the more work the CPU has to do. The CPU draws the players in the environment and the environment itself. The GPU renders or shades them in and the amount of detail is based on the settings you set. The more players you have the more calculations the CPU must perform. The CPU handles how the player interacts with the world. The CPU also does collision calculations for everything happening in game. Imagine the amount of collisions 64 or more players have in any given instant. Every weapon, footstep, player, and environment objects must be calculated.   Another important factor is the lighting. The Unreal Engine uses a feature called Lightmass for a more realistic environment. Lightmass is heavily CPU dependent and as such will bog down your game. Turning dynamic lighting, light shafts, etc off should add an extra few frames depending on your system. The rag doll count obviously adds a huge frame rate hit when turned up too. All the extra bodies can bog the CPU something fierce.   Ping will play a factor in your interactions with other players but doesn't always add lag. You may move smoothly in your game but notice other players jump around or stagger about. Ping is determined by the distance you are from the server, in this case Seattle, Washington, and how your packets are being routed based on your ISP. The more switches or hops your packets go through the more ping you will have. Other factors are if you are using a router and if your system is placed on the highest priority on that router. In some occurrences you may get what is known as packet loss. This might be because your ping is too low. For instance you send too many packets or send them too fast to the server. The server thinks you are doubling packets and drops the newest one causing your system to resend the information. This is more rare but happens when multiple packets are sent before the server refreshes itself.   Finally an important factor on lag are the maps. Some maps are better optimized than others and it is a well known problem that the maps will bug out. Chivalry is a great game but damn if it has its bugs. Citadel for one is a map that bugs quite often, especially so with high player counts. A final food for thought is the more players you have congested into one area the more lag you will get. Bigger maps will lag less because the players are spread out. When you get maps that clump forty or more players together you will notice large spikes. This is not because the [FOR] server cannot handle the traffic, it is because your CPU cannot process everything happening. All the rendering happening in game is done on the local system. The server transfers the information back and forth and host a centralized location for it.  Example of everything above explained:  You join a server that has 80 people playing. All this information is uploaded to the [FOR] server and then sent to each client from the host. Your local machine will process all the information it receives from the host and then sends the updated information back. The server does not host each instant of the world for all 80 players. There are 80 instances of the world running at one time on each player's machine. The updates are transferred to each player via the server. Any lag encountered during the event is either a local issue or a ping issue. 90% of the time lag comes from the CPU bottlenecking your GPU. It may also be a lack of ram or too many background processes running.   Some things you can do to counteract the lag is: Overclock your CPU, unpark your cores, set the processor affinity if needed, set the priority of Chivalry to real time, disabled unneeded background services, refresh your modem and router, lower settings, play on the server when it is less congested.   If there is still any doubt here are the server specs used to run the [FOR] 100 man server.  Specs: CPU: Intel Xeon E3-1270v3 @ 3.9 GHZ  RAM: 32 GB DDR3-1600 ECC (Error Correcting Code Memory) HDD: 2 TB, 7200 RPM  aSSD: 240 GB  LAN: One Gigabit symmentrical connection   These specs are more than enough to ferry packets between 100 clients or less. Enjoy the game gentlemen and ladies! The server isn't the problem!  Benefits of the [FOR] server: Active admins, new custom maps weekly, huge map list, huge player list, top notch server specs, low server ping, good player base, fun community, no abusive admins!!"
ChivalryGame,35dazd,NinjaSushi2,1 point,Sat May 9 17:06:49 2015 UTC,"Where do I even begin with this?  LAG refers to network latency. Your ping. You wrote up this huge post assuming when I said lag I meant ""low framerate.""   My framerate is perfectly fine, that's not the issue. Lag doesn't mean your framerate is low, lag means your ping is high.   When the server has 70+ people and the ping of EVERY SINGLE PERSON in the server skyrockets to over 150, yes, that is absolutely a server issue. And it seems to do that every single game I play in that server.  Luckily when pings skyrocket it's easier to get people to quit and join a different server."
ChivalryGame,35dazd,NinjaSushi2,5,Sat May 9 17:18:49 2015 UTC,"My folly brother.   I assumed you generalized the term like most people. Even at 70 and 80 people there are those who claim they have no lag and fps dips. If you didn't find my information useful that is fine. I am not sure what you are trying to accomplish with this thread though. It seems you just want to bash on the [FOR] server. You are entitled to your opinions, certainly, but this is not helpful in any fashion.   Might I suggest if you do not enjoy the server then don't use it? The 100 man server was a test to see if it was possible. No one has ever done it you see and we were curious. :)   I should note my ping averages 120 after 70 or so players and my frames sit about at 80 fps, so it is playable for me. I've seen people with around 60 ping even above 80 players so it is all situational and circumstantial.   Edit: Where is your location and whom is your ISP?"

Playing on the [FOR] server is like fighting a dragon naked and barefisted while your teammates shoot arrows at you. :) But when you get a good crowd of people player -- not these level 1s and 2s -- the TK can be fairly minimal.  People need to learn to feint out of swings or drag out. Though there are certain glorious gory maps like AOCTO-MountainPeak_P which are guaranteed to be a slaughter fest.

I never have any kind of lag or stuttering, unless we are playing on an experimental/new map that hasn't been optimized yet. The team damage doesn't bother me, especially when I take into consideration that there are 50 or more people. It's gonna be a clusterfuck.  They cycle the stock maps but also throw in some new content, which is something I love. I can only play Stoneshill TO or Moor LTS so many times before I get bored.  Some of my favorite people to play with on the server are regulars. Hell, I didn't even have Steam friends from Chiv until I played on the server regularly. To sum up...  It sucks you had some technical issues, but I've not once run into them on that server. If you aren't a fan, run your own server or chill in the empties until people show up. If it wasn't a kick ass server, you wouldn't see it growing in popularity. It used to be a 64 player-slot setup, but they kept hitting max capacity.  [FOR] Server is best server. You're entitled to your opinion and I'm sure some of your feedback is useful to those who pay to provide some fun for all of us. However, it seems like your experience is in the minority."

ChivalryGame,356qgb,Reithur,1 point,Tue May 12 18:00:55 2015 UTC,"Well I'm up to rank 33 now, and yeah I've definitely watched teripper's videos; he's helped a lot.   I'm pretty good at stomping newbs in pubs and can usually win 1v1s against higher level players, but I still have some higher level frontiers to cross:  -reading feints  -reliably blocking daggers  -footwork can always be improved"
ChivalryGame,356qgb,arenagamer,2,Tue May 12 21:47:48 2015 UTC,"That's quite the list lol  Reading feints takes practice.  Practice means getting smashed in the face a few thousand times while feeling like a fool for falling for a feint.  Try these;  *Easiest is keep backing away from them and not letting them get to facehug range.  *You can also try crouching and leaning back.  This is a very defensive move and can severely limit your mobility, but it may keep you alive by giving you some more room to see if it's a real attack or a feint.  *Alternately, keep strafing to their left to buy yourself a bit more time; this helps you maintain some mobility.  *When you attack, your character makes a grunt or agressive sound; listen for the opponent to make a grunt to show they're committed to attacking.  *Sometimes you end up guessing.  We call this gambling.  Blocking daggers;  try backing up and waiting for the next strike before parrying.  You may have to eat a hit or two to get the timing, then give them a kick and back up to buy yourself enough distance to switch to your secondary weapon.  Footwork; WASD to victory!  Keep your opponent off balance by moving in ways they don't expect.  *Always strafe to keep yourself away from the center of their vision; it's harder to see your attack animations if half your body is off their screen.  *Sprinting in combat is very effective; it makes all your movements much quicker, but at the cost of stamina regeneration.  Remember to let go of sprint to recover some stam.  *I use a start-stop method to throw them off;  I'll sprint forward while strafing to keep my movement a bit strange, then stop just before I reach their weapon range; almost everyone tries to attack, so just wait for their swing to pass, then sprint forward and get your free hit on them while they're in recovery.  Some weapons can be dragged to a standstill and I've run into them, so watch out for that (Longsword, Messer, Zwei, Halberd, Polehammer).  For those who don't attack, try to fake them again and see if they'll take the bait.  Hover at the edge of their range and just step back if they swing.  *Start-stop works against ranged attacks as well; watch for them to release and just stop, then resume your run.  Hope some of this helps!"
ChivalryGame,356qgb,Peasant420,1 point,Wed May 13 02:47:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for replying Reithur.   You really touched on a lot of good points here.   Bonus tip: your lean-back crouching idea can actually work pretty good against daggers as well as feint spammers!
ChivalryGame,356qgb,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Thu May 14 20:21:15 2015 UTC,"Glad I could help.  The lean-back stuff is more useful in duels, since you don't often have enough time in a TO; as soon as you stop moving, someone else comes in and kills you.  ...it's just occurred to me that you've seen me get rekt repeatedly by Spook, Beef, and teripper lol  Those guys spend a lot of time duelling, but I prefer TOs; give me an objective with a 3v1 and I'll collect two kills, an assist, and some laughs about the TK I forced!  Let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to answer.  I'm slowly working on a general tips & tricks guide to Chiv, so threads like this help build up content for me ;)"
ChivalryGame,356qgb,Charles_K,2,Thu May 14 21:13:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely agree, dueling daggers or at least a 1v1 is the situation I was talking about. In a TO, a little footwork and a zwei overhead will easily dispatch most dagger users.   I feel ya. I'm in one of terippers videos myself where I try to challenge him to a few duels on a ffa server. I think i hit him maybe twice and he killed me like 5 times lol. But that was a while ago, teripper if you read this i challenge you again!"

ChivalryGame,352r9c,haxic,3,Wed May 6 16:51:26 2015 UTC,I play at 1600 dpi 25 sens and can manage to drag well and flip my camera around relatively quickly.
ChivalryGame,352r9c,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,3,Wed May 6 17:07:52 2015 UTC,Am I correct in my understanding that higher DPI coupled with a lower sens provides smoother cursor movement?  btw big meta fan <3 loved your scrim against moorland on chivitational few weeks ago. I learned a lot.
ChivalryGame,352r9c,ACobb,2,Wed May 6 17:14:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, the more dpi (dots per inch) the more smoother it is. Sensitivity just changes how fast your cursor goes. You just have to find the perfect balance, really.  And thanks! Always wanted a fan. Intense game we had there, had lots of fun playing."
ChivalryGame,352r9c,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Wed May 6 17:42:08 2015 UTC,More dpi doesn't always mean a better feel. Alot of pro Counter strike players use like 400 to 600 dpi

ChivalryGame,352r9c,goatsedotcx,1 point,Wed May 6 17:05:25 2015 UTC,I play at 10 sensitivity and 3200 dpi. I notice from the other two posts that the dpi and sensitivity ratios are somewhat connected. We're probably all playing at about the same sensitivity in-game.
ChivalryGame,352r9c,MajorGrempington,1 point,Wed May 6 17:12:06 2015 UTC,"25 Sensitivity 800 DPI here,  for me it's really all about mouse placement.   Sensitivity has a large role obviously but mouse placement on your mouse pad is also important."
ChivalryGame,352r9c,bi11y10,1 point,Wed May 6 17:32:52 2015 UTC,There is a turncap in game so if you move really quickly you will be slowed down so it prevents people from having like 90000000 sensitivity with 6000000000 dpi to do 1080 yolo drags.  The thing about drags isn't to violently move your mouse around it's actually a really fluid and simple movement that can be done two ways.   You can start the swing as a drag and all you do is aim your swing the furthest you can from your opponent and give your weapon its maximum release time until it hits your target. With this drag you don't even need any sort of special mouse movement.  The second is starting your attack at a minimum distance between your opponent and yourself and then simply moving the weapon tracer to that same far point as before and then letting the release time and animations of the weapon do the work. You aren't constantly move your weapon away and flailing it around or moving left and right it's simply a swipe across the mousepad in one fluid motion.
ChivalryGame,352r9c,ia_Flame,1 point,Wed May 6 18:59:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know how to do drags. Its not hard to do 360 spin, but I often fail in the midst of combat because I start moving my mouse to fast... I wish the mechanics would work that it is set at maximum rotational speed instead of slowing or freezing your drag when you move your mouse at higher than that."
ChivalryGame,352r9c,ia_Flame,3,Wed May 6 19:57:28 2015 UTC,If it was centered around your mouse input then you would simply have people with crazy high sensitivity whirling their characters around and you probably wouldn't even be able to see their weapon or any movements to help parry

I've played a lot of archer recently and noticed almost everyone tries to feint me which is hilarious considering as knight almost no one feints me  by the way getting the let it rain achievement is one of my worst chiv experiences so far, I'm going to enjoy archer hunting after I'm done with this"

They're so squishy it's better to risk blocking and be wrong than to risk not blocking and be wrong I guess.   Also, that achievement is a nightmare. It was that achievement where I realized that there are people (usually high levels) that do nothing but run around behind the map to whack archers with greatswords. It's really annoying."

I don't know, for some reason it feels like I have a LOT more time to stare at the windup and check if it's a feint.   But besides that... Feinting only archers usually means you never learned how to feint properly."

ChivalryGame,351fom,Koiuki,2,Fri May 8 00:17:17 2015 UTC,"Just because they balance some areas doesn't mean the rest make sense. They've make sweeping changes to some aspects of the gameplay that shouldn't be tinkered with every other week. The idea of being able to change a thing or two about the game that torn banner won't, like hit trading makes sense, but weapon speeds and reverses are a big deal, id understand one or two weapons needing their speed adjusted, but they've changed every single one, and at this point, its basically without just cause, its whatever sounds the good at the time, and its pretty fucking arbitrary if  you ask me."
ChivalryGame,351fom,LordKefkaPalazzo,1 point,Fri May 8 00:30:27 2015 UTC,"Your entire opinion on mercs is based off an assumption, you're assuming they don't have a cause and that they just go off of whatever sounds good to them which you have no proof to make that statement a fact, but you state it as if it's a fact regardless, you're an idiot."

ChivalryGame,351fom,LordKefkaPalazzo,0,Fri May 8 04:52:20 2015 UTC,"I'd like to just point out that we'd like to think that we are indeed looking at the bigger picture.  Much conversation has been had about the speed changes.  The reason why so many changes to the speeds of weapons are necessary on the faster swings is that First Hit Flinch broke some things with attacks that are too fast.  Essentially EVERY fast swing got a buff, so we've had to play balancing acts to compensate.  I think we're getting really close to a good balance point.  I've seen more viable weapons being used in Mercs scrims than at any point in history.  Scrims feel fun.  The combat feels good.  There is definitely a bit of fine tuning to be done, but these have all been TEST builds (which is why they are being altered every other week.  The mod hasn't even been released yet, and 2 weeks gives a good amount of time to test things and consider them and what not).    When you have a project like this, it is sure not to please everyone.  The important thing I think, though, is whether it is better on whole than vanilla on the whole.  There are some things I don't care for in MERCS, but I remind myself that those tidbits are easily worth swallowing to get the gains that the package brings."
ChivalryGame,351fom,AceofSpades916,7,Fri May 8 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"yea thats true, I just don't understand how people can say it sucks and would rather be traded to death by the unflinchable m0l, just makes no sense to me, yet to hear a valid reason why people wont play it, when people play on it and they get handle hit with dubaxe or something, they instantly blame the mod, like the other day, I seen someone on mercs that got a 200 pingspike and died because of it and spammed chat with ""Lol shit mod makes me lag"", senseless mongols everywhere"

They've changed so many things about the game, it's not the same game anymore, hittrading and some balance issues aside since TB never seems to fix anything, changing the timing and tracers on every weapon is such garbage, removing reverses which people have been practicing since the dawn of time and more, the only people that will be good are the 2-4 clans that practice on Mercs more than vanilla."

ChivalryGame,351fom,Xylvion,1 point,Wed May 6 09:47:34 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I've actually tried out Mercs though (after they rebalanced some weapons), so maybe I have just fallen out of the opinion train. At least a few months ago I couldn't find anyone who didn't like it, but that was when there was only FHF and a couple of windup increases.   I stopped actively playing Chivalry a few weeks ago when I got bored of the spamming and hit trading. I just don't see the meta evolving without flinch in release. Unbalanced Mercs is better than ""balanced"" vanilla IMO."
ChivalryGame,351fom,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,-3,Wed May 6 10:08:50 2015 UTC,"This is the thing though, FHF and a few other mechanical changes are great, FHF is somewhat implemented in a lazy way, however with the tick system it can be changed slightly so that it punishes gamblers and that's it.  Either way, what I dislike about mercs is the awful balance decisions, balance should make all weapons viable (by viable I don't mean 1hit everything, but there should be a reason to chose waraxe instead of flanged mace, or the opposite), merc fails to do that according to me and several others (which is most likely why it's not used in EU comp either). It's not like vanilla is balanced either, but if I had to chose one of the two I'd actually prefer sticking to vanilla."
ChivalryGame,351fom,ia_Flame,2,Wed May 6 10:23:06 2015 UTC,Waraxe is one of the best man at arms primaries in mercs it's crazy good. Same with the mace. The balancing has actually begun to level out at this point and I would say it's worth a try.

At any rate, Perfect balance is nearly impossible to achieve by people who have been studying game design for years.  Hell, many companies work perfect imbalance into their game to keep metagames fresh and because it doesn't have quite the lofty, impossible goal.  I'd still say that MERCS approaches it a lot close than Vanilla, which is really what matters."

The times where your swing stops is when you are flinched which is when you are hit during your windup phase. Windup times are different for every weapon.

ChivalryGame,34wits,slapyourownbutt,12,Tue May 5 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"I think the real problem is prediction, you have to stop predicting and actually watch what's happening. You get caught in a loop of knowing people's styles, and knowing which combos are effective and expect certain things, so you're subconsciously reacting.  I stopped playing for about a month and came back and I had way less problems with feints because I knew that if I wasn't already hit then they hadn't attacked if I waited too long. Take a break, come back and you'll be much more relaxed in fights I think.  P.S. I still suck, but less than before my break."
ChivalryGame,34wits,electricspit,15,Tue May 5 04:01:28 2015 UTC,"STEP ASIDE MERICANS, HERE COMES ADVANCED EU STRATS  If you want to read feints like good ol giru giru, then it all comes down to footwork. The way to read a SoW stab up close, is to be side-stepping like a twat with A and D (and S, to an extent) which will give you more time to not only block the attack, but also to see if it's a feint, because the enemy player has to adjust his aim to track you which will buy you PRECIOUS MICROSECONDS to determine whether it is a feint, or if it is indeed a spooky real attack  prediction is for noobs and gamblers (it is true tho, that some people are so predictable when they feint), you will be crushed by greater players if you just try to predict your feints, or even worse, gamble before i finish my feint, haha"
ChivalryGame,34wits,Kesby,3,Tue May 5 06:24:27 2015 UTC,I do that and it really helps as an MAA. I've never heard of anyone else in NA doing this but I'm pretty sure they do.
ChivalryGame,34wits,ParkRangerStan,4,Tue May 5 06:39:25 2015 UTC,"I thought everyone did that- whether they realize it or not. It's just implied that backpedaling and strafing buy you time during the release to read it. Just as using footwork in the fight to keep your distance so feints are easier to read. I never really considered it a ""strat"", it's instinct that being further away or side stepping buys you just a bit of time. It's the same reason you see people lean back. Although I don't like doing that much because you're not as mobile."

Dunno how much you've been practicing, but I'd probably take a break for a few days and then see how you perform in a scrim setting!"
ChivalryGame,34wits,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,4,Tue May 5 04:01:22 2015 UTC,"^ probably the best advice here. Don't let this game take you over man.   Sometimes you just gotta accept the fact that some feints are unreadable due to ping, bad tracers, and human reaction. There comes a point where you have to predict a little bit, catch on to patterns and put yourself in situations where you can't be feinted a lot. For example, whenever I scrim you and you read my feint, all I have to do is hit you with a really fast attack or feint you again. Discipline yourself to attack after somebody feints you and you gain back the initiative in a fight. If you're using a fast weapon like a Norse or mace or whatever you use and punish the feint at a reasonable speed, you shouldn't be flinched or even traded."
ChivalryGame,34wits,CRUSHED1337,1 point,Tue May 5 04:15:12 2015 UTC,"I've tried to punish feints but if it's a really fast attack then I'm going to get traded. If I'm at facehug range and someone does a messer overhead feint and then I do a lookdown with the mace, I usually get hit traded.  Also, after modding the game, looking at how ping affects the game and my reaction time, I think that I have the ability to read most feints. When I'm practicing with the guy playing on the script, it seems like there is time to react. Sometimes when I'm practicing with him, I'll be reading most of the feints just because my mind is clear."
ChivalryGame,34wits,Peasant420,6,Tue May 5 05:34:50 2015 UTC,"I just read the majority of feints by muscle memory i just dont parry and dont think about them and its like ""oh i read a feint ok""  Then in the more tough situations i do good predictions, for example an easily predictable feint is when that person is on his last stamina but has enough for a feint  Predictions help me against the feints i fuckup to read with muscle memory, but you need a shitload of skill and experience for both. Predictions dont work always though so never rely on that, but when youre very experienced then they work often especially because it takes a great mind and great player to realize when they are being predictable in the moment to change his decision on the fly. These people are so rare that predictions is actually viable  Never gamble though, only predict/anticipate. Dont rely 100% on those, just use them to help you read the best feints."
ChivalryGame,34wits,electricspit,2,Tue May 5 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"You can always dodge the need to read by kicking as a reflex. It's pretty safe if you learn how to land them right and respond quickly enough, but it is not the end all be all solution to feints."

There's a window where an attack isn't hitting you but also can't be feinted, at that point you block. Watch the weapon to see where you need to block, but I can't really rely on watching the weapon to see the feint, it's all timing for me (lag fucks my shit up doe mang.)  Also, an important habit to get in to is if you can't tell what an attack is, then don't panic parry, just let it hit you (obviously this is from a knight mains' point of view, so I can fuck up more than a MAA.)

And when fights get intense there are certain moments and combos that are almost certainly going to be feints (risk vs gain moments) , so you react accordingly and keep your calm ye"
ChivalryGame,34wits,muchverygood,2,Tue May 5 07:47:47 2015 UTC,"gotta keep a calm head at all times during a fight, even when its intense, if you're stressed you wont react as quickly and you're likely to panic.  If you're really struggling with feints just remember they need to actually be in range to feint, and if they're in your range and you can force a block/attempt a attack safely you should be taking the initiative.  Feinting punishes defensive players who typically only know how to fight off of ripostes."

ChivalryGame,34wits,muchverygood,3,Tue May 5 17:27:36 2015 UTC,"i doubt most people will bother trying to read if they're just in a random pub game, which, judging from the overall bad-vibe i'm getting from your post, is what you're talking about  i've seen people read norse feints, it's not a particularly rare thing if you're focused. on the other hand since norse is a weapon you can easily trade with most weapons so a lot of times simply gambling can be worth more especially with vanguard and maa  generally you're not going to read feints if you aren't focused - which no one ever really bothers with in pubs"
ChivalryGame,34wits,Stael,1 point,Tue May 5 18:08:07 2015 UTC,"Must be some legendary good ping then. My problem with ""fast"" weapons and their feints is that if you go for a last second block to try and read a possible feint, you are taking a massive risk of being hit by a near insta-hit drag like look down overheads. SOW, Norse, and Claymore are all bullshit weapons for this reason IMO, but I'm kinda stuck using norse since I main maa, and the BS does not even remotely compare. I don't really mind other weapons and their feints like polearms, messers, and other slower crap because you can totally go for last second blocks on those to save yourself from feints."
ChivalryGame,34wits,nitram916,2,Tue May 5 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"idk about you but in order for me to read feints i have to assume this kind of mentality where i'm not afraid of taking hits at all  you just sort of relax really hard and try to remove yourself from the game a bit, like the opposite of immersing yourself. also you need to watch the actual animation - if you're not thinking about it you'll panic parry simply from the weapon snapping back to idle after a feint  my ping is actually really mediocre, usually around 60-80, but even if i play away from home with better pings i don't really feel like that changes much, most of reading is just getting into a kind of big-dick state of mind - no matter how you look at it feints are the ultimate confidence game"

Open Steam > Right Click Chivalry > Properties > Local Files > Browse Local Files  You should now be in Chiv install directory. Go to /UDKGame/Config/. In the link I posted below, you'll find UDKEngine.ini and UDKSystemSettings.ini. Open them and copy the contents and paste them into their respective .ini files. They will probably be named DefaultEngine.ini and DefaultSystemSettings.ini.   If you don't have those files, then just look for (something)Engine.ini or (something)SystemDefaults.ini.  https://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/30ufr5/fps_config/  Make sure to read everything in the link as well.   PS, there are probably commands in there that are not relevant to Mac and Linux but I'm too lazy to figure them out.  Edit: You could also use the Runescape config for more FPS savings, but Chiv crashes on map change."

No udkengine udksystemsettings, nothing, literally just the game.  Is this because i havent downloaded chiv beta? or another problem?  thanks"
ChivalryGame,34y3xy,CuddlyNeedle,1 point,Tue May 5 16:44:43 2015 UTC,I've no idea. Maybe you can open the app file. Says here that you can right click the app file and show contents. Try that.  http://fileinfo.com/extension/app

So now im in chivalry.app/contents/resources/UDKGame/config  and i have similar files to ones you mentioned, i have defaultengine.ini and defaultengineUDK.ini - now i take it that it is the second one, but what programme do i open this sort of file with? word? mac terminal?  thanks again for your help  edit: just read your original post, they are meant to be called that, sorry haha, but what programme should i use to open them?"
ChivalryGame,34y3xy,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Tue May 5 18:11:36 2015 UTC,Any text editor on Mac. You could use word but that is slow and clunky. Make sure you click save and not save as. If you save as you may save it as a .txt file instead of a .ini file.

Then all three clans saw them in the tournament.  SEE YOU IN THE TOURNA---wizardish caught speedhacking in tournament  SEE YOU IN THE OPEN CHALLE---Sarge has been removed from Tempest  SEE YOU IN THE E VS RANGERS. Cock block me once, shame on you.

ChivalryGame,34reqw,bi11y10,14,Sun May 3 22:26:34 2015 UTC,Longbow broadhead should 2 shot MAA to the chest instead of 3. That is all.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,DragonPC-ca,2,Mon May 4 01:48:26 2015 UTC,I think this makes sense and should be implemented. I also really want to see what people think about the idea of letting archers drawing bows move at a faster walk speed. Like shortbow or light xbow can walk faster when drawn/aiming. This may make shortbow op as fuck considering its already really good.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,DragonPC-ca,3,Mon May 4 04:13:43 2015 UTC,The only weapon that might need this is the warbow. I think the reason it still isn't really used is because it makes you too prone to throwing axes and counter arching.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,J-P_,3,Mon May 4 12:08:51 2015 UTC,So it isn't used 'cause it's harder to play with? I often shoot people with the lcb without moving an inch and still don't get shot. It just requires more positioning and awareness. Something like javs are pretty hard to avoid though. You can shoot them once and then you're at their mercy. Just gotta make sure the harder to use weapon is worth it.  The fact is less mobility = harder to use against good archers. Obviously something like heavy xbow doesn't really follow this rule. You can always go behind full cover to reload since the reload is slow no matter what.  I'd much rather make some of the other weapons more prone to counter-archering than make even more weapons easier to use.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,DragonPC-ca,2,Mon May 4 13:31:43 2015 UTC,"I often shoot people with the lcb without moving an inch and still don't get shot.   Well yeah, but I'm willing to bet you keep an eye out for threats and start to move if the other team's archer is zoning in on you. If not you're playing against shitty archers.  To me the biggest offset of going up a bow should be the draw time. Smaller bow = quicker draw = more arrows per minute, the tradeoff being less damage and a lower projectile velocity. I would actually prefer if all bows had a strafe speed while drawn similar to the longbow, but at the very least I think the warbow movement speed while drawn needs to be increased.  I think the best argument for increasing it is that it's the only archer weapon that makes you sitting meat while drawn. It made sense when warbow was the only weapon that could one-shot other archers so you were making a trade-off (one-shot archers in exchange for opening yourself up more to other archers), but that's not longer the case now that all bows have an archer one-shot capability."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,J-P_,2,Mon May 4 18:45:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not really familiar with the exact numbers anymore. Just trying to state facts. When I do scrim it's usually not on mercs.   In my opinion warbow should always be the number one counter-archer weapon but I guess that's not the case anymore. Shortbow should definitely not be able to oneshot archers even to the head, none of the spammy weapons should. They should be solely for focusing and flinching melee. I don't see why the weapons with the fastest fire rates should be just as viable for counter-archering as warbow and be harder to counter-archer. Doesn't make sense to me.   Well yeah, but I'm willing to bet you keep an eye out for threats and start to move if the other team's archer is zoning in on you. If not you're playing against shitty archers.   My point was that if you have enough sense of awareness and positioning it's doable, but the question is if it's worth the effort when you can have both mobility and counter-archer abilities with some other weapon. If it's not, it needs to be made worth it maybe by giving it a bigger advantage counter-archering wise."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,DragonPC-ca,1 point,Mon May 4 23:04:12 2015 UTC,"The shortbow + broadhead one shots them to the head.  Longbow broadhead oneshots to the body.  For those reasons, warbow movement speed needs a buff. That's basically my argument."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,J-P_,2,Mon May 4 23:11:52 2015 UTC,"Sure it does if that's the case. I just believe that the fastest weapon still able to oneshot archers to the chest is always going to be better for counter-archering. This is why I think the damage on archers should be sort of brought up a notch. Make warbow broadheads the only weapon able to oneshot archers to the chest,  longbow broadheads the only weapon able to oneshot archers to the head and shortbow not able to oneshot archers at all.   This way longbow would be the mid-ground weapon, shortbow the melee flinching weapon, and warbow the counter-archer weapon. The least mobile archer weapon that is the most prone to counter-archering should also be clearly the best at counter-archering."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,J-P_,2,Mon May 4 23:40:06 2015 UTC,I think not. The mobility that walking already offers allows bows to keep shooting all the time while moving behind cover and away from cover and to get closer for easier shots to mitigate for the slower projectile speed. This is what in my opinion makes using bows a lot easier positioning and awareness wise than lcb since with it you can't move back into cover to reload every single time if you really wanna be successful.  The advantage of mobility becomes even more apparent with sling and javelins.  I don't think weapons should be balanced by making them easier to use.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,ia_Flame,1 point,Mon May 4 12:28:36 2015 UTC,I just want the warbow to be fixed so that the bodkins one shot headshot man at arms again and I would love love love if the one shot head shot to vanguards could come back I really miss those head explosions

ChivalryGame,34reqw,Cerebral_Harlot,2,Mon May 4 15:05:48 2015 UTC,I think your underestimating how good other archer weapons are in mercs compared to Javs.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,ia_Flame,2,Mon May 4 14:55:47 2015 UTC,i don't see how that justifies buffing an already powerful weapon further
ChivalryGame,34reqw,Peasant420,2,Mon May 4 15:02:45 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that the jav has a huge drawback when you throw it, the buckler doesn't come up for a solid 500 ms or so. Compare this to the weapon switch times of bow-secondary or the combo feint to parry times of any weapon and there is a huge discrepancy."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Mon May 4 15:07:43 2015 UTC,"and it's outweighed by the fact that you can throw and parry without having to switch weapons. good javelineers don't really get hit unless they don't know you're there, same as other archers  i mean you might as well say bow archers are at a disadvantage because they aren't able to parry the moment they change weapons. if you miss your shot that you held for too long anyway, you deserve to get hit and not be able to instantly parry.  similarly, a good jav archer will realise the risk he's taking by taking a shot when he can get hit in recovery. it makes sense that a missed throw while in melee range should be punishable, javelin archers already have way too much leeway in melee as it is"
ChivalryGame,34reqw,Peasant420,2,Mon May 4 16:14:43 2015 UTC,The problem is that this seems to be a bug. Sometimes the parry after throw is responsive and normal and at that 500 ms mark which isn't all that bad when it is consistent. What the issue at hand is about is that the shield won't come up at all it just gets stuck in a sense for a second or two and usually makes a weird animation where it jitters up and down but doesn't do anything. So even if the thrower makes the right throw at the proper range this bug happens for so long that they still can't get the shield up in time and it gets them killed through no fault of their own.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Tue May 5 00:18:35 2015 UTC,"if this is being an issue for you it's just a l2p issue, good archers never have problems with ranging melees - javelin archers least of all"

ChivalryGame,34reqw,mobinstime,1 point,Mon May 4 16:52:30 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter, lots of archers not gonna name names but lots of archers disable particles in their files so smoke doesn't even appear on screen when thrown so they can shoot right through no problem. If this didn't exist though I totally agree I love using smoke to cover advances against those I'm fairly certain haven't killed particles and that way my team gets shot less and especially on stones hill it helps with the cart pushing objective"

ChivalryGame,34reqw,mobinstime,2,Tue May 5 04:16:26 2015 UTC,"Every knight (not sure about maa) weapon with shield is WAY too fast. Non-shield user will get stammed or traded to death unless the shield-user has awful footwork. I'm not sure how this affects the game outside of duels, but it is definitely broken in favor of shield during duels. Flanged mace needs a damage nerf. 2htk with head shots vs knight is too good. Baseball Bat needs a longer windup on the lmb, potentially pole axe as well. I am uncertain if it is combo times or release times for billhook, but it feels too fast, to the point that if you get hit once its nearly a guaranteed second hit as well. This is a biased opinion, as I find all pole weapons to be super easy to play, so feel free to ignore this one. Retire Maul permanently since Spook is gone.   Overall, I would suggest that you seriously consider rethinking the Mercs design philosophy with regards to the removal of weapons. I personally believe that different weapons should be more noticeably different, more distinct from each other. Many weapons in Chivalry are so similar that I can't help but question why they're even in the game beyond giving a player the choice between broken animations and readable animations."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,sesstreets,1 point,Mon May 4 22:55:25 2015 UTC,"Shield weapons release times are incredible bullshit right now tbh I think flanged combo speed should be reduced IMO, damage not awful  Polearms are actually quite slow in terms of numbers, but they still feel pretty fast. (Billhook has similar times to longsword) The way it is so fast and sp00ky is due to the animations that we can't really fix :( Personally I don't find them that downright awful, just takes a little getting used to the handles"
ChivalryGame,34reqw,Cerebral_Harlot,1 point,Tue May 5 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"Maybe a nerf to flanged headshot damage?  I still think the polearms need more adjusting. If you can't change the animation, maybe adjust the numbers to reflect how fast a 12 foot pole with an axe on the end SHOULD be, rather than how it is in chivalry. The range in FHF is already ridiculously good on any weapon, so I don't think the speed difference is significant enough. Just my 2c."

ChivalryGame,34reqw,Cerebral_Harlot,3,Tue May 5 03:14:58 2015 UTC,"I would really love it if they removed dodge out of parry. It's pretty much the reason why I will avoid dueling another MAA at all costs. Although I really like dueling knight vs. knight, I will admit that MAA dueling can be fun at times if neither player is dodge spamming and dodging out of parries."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,sesstreets,6,Mon May 4 00:31:18 2015 UTC,"I disagree entirely, you can refer to this conversation between Sir Loin and I :  http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/34cdf2/maa_dodge_out_of_parry/cqtw3rf"
ChivalryGame,34reqw,sesstreets,3,Mon May 4 02:34:49 2015 UTC,I actually think a faster maa without dodge sounds fun as hell. Maybe it would fuck with chase mechanic though cause knights would have to get crazy speed boosts to catch up. The idea sounds cool though.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,Politician_Cranberry,4,Mon May 4 13:22:00 2015 UTC,"Have the option to put it on like equipping different weapons; choose one option, you get normal MAA w/ dodge.  Pick the other, you get no dodge, but a foot speed & acceleration buff."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,sesstreets,2,Mon May 4 14:18:53 2015 UTC,I don't really think that a knight should be able to catch up to an maa who has a good lead on them. My idea is no dodge but sideways run being enabled and a higher top speed for sprinting. Hell I'd even be ok with how maa speed is but with no dodge and 'dodging' instead makes you run 2x speed but it uses stamina 20/sec just like dodge.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,CRUSHED1337,1 point,Mon May 4 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"As long as a maa couldn't just run away from a duel anytime they want to regen health or stamina it would work I think. I guess it depends how much of a speed and acceleration increase they need to be viable which we can't really know without trying it. Or chase mechanic could always be increased but it just seems a little messed up to let slow classes run that fast. The 2x speed thing sounds pretty good too, I feel like I would enjoy playing maa more if evading attacks was more about using footwork instead of using dodge. Idk if the mercs people would want to make such a huge change to the game though."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,ia_Flame,1 point,Tue May 5 00:26:17 2015 UTC,I don't like the way the chase mechanic is implemented and wish it made more sense and had a different acceleration curve. It feels like x2 when it should be ln(x) which is more natural instead of the fzero speed boost pads we have now.

ChivalryGame,34reqw,ia_Flame,1 point,Sun May 3 22:45:12 2015 UTC,Idk I just think the weapon can be manipulated in so many ways because of how long it is and the release times. Its just too viable at the moment there isnt much reason to choose any other van weapon besides polehammer or spear. And even then the Halberd is already good at doing the same job as those weapons.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,sesstreets,1 point,Mon May 4 04:07:55 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with the tracers except that they are set a little bit to the right of the weapon. It's not game breaking, it actually makes it harder for the user to land hits based on the model of the weapon, but at the same time it might be a little deceiving for the person parrying it although it won't matter as much since parrying is much easier than landing the hit."

ChivalryGame,34reqw,sesstreets,1 point,Mon May 4 07:11:42 2015 UTC,I think it is more or less people not being acquainted with the animations of the weapon. Everyone uses swords and know swords well and only recently have polearms begun to come back into play. No one knows how to deal with them as well and now are outraged about it.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,ia_Flame,2,Mon May 4 08:19:20 2015 UTC,It's mostly because the halbard hits you before it looks like it hits you especially with the alt slash.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,sesstreets,2,Mon May 4 15:45:45 2015 UTC,That would probably be connected with the handle hits although I'm not sure if the alt slash would make this appearance I would think the overhead would be the culprit of this problem as the handle would hit far before the blade and give that deceiving look.

ChivalryGame,34reqw,Stael,3,Mon May 4 04:46:24 2015 UTC,The falchion was already buffed quite a bit in mercs and it is actually a really strong weapon. I think it is being used less at the moment because of the norse combo times.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,sesstreets,2,Mon May 4 06:08:30 2015 UTC,"It has nothing going for it except damage. The knight 3 shot is nice but when the mstar and fmace exist why use it? The maa 2 shot is nice but when the norse exists as it is with the 2 stab to the chest why use it?   It's outgamed by most, if not all, of the maa arsenal. I know the intention of mercs to is to at least make every weapon MORE viable but the falchion is still kinda stuck."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,ia_Flame,3,Mon May 4 12:26:26 2015 UTC,"Norse doesn't 2 shot maa to the chest with stabs, that was planned originally but we changed our minds b/c it would be the only knight secondary ever used and would be a large indirect nerf to maa"

ChivalryGame,34reqw,ia_Flame,1 point,Mon May 4 12:47:50 2015 UTC,The falchion doesn't have to be balanced as a MAA primary. I think of it as a great secondary and a viable primary.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,Stael,2,Mon May 4 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"That's like saying ""The zweihander doesn't have to be balanced as a vanguard primary"" no? Excluding the fork I'm not sure which vanguard weapon isn't viable and I feel its almost the same for knights."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,ia_Flame,1 point,Mon May 4 18:43:56 2015 UTC,The falchion is viable though. It two hit kills vanguards and one shots archers. It just doesn't fall in the man at arms meta of stab feint to dodge out of parry because it is a little shorter. It can easily be made to work but most man at arms players don't like the play style that comes with it so it isn't used as often. It works great with a knight and shield because people use the proper play style with it. If a man at arms also acknowledges that it's stabs aren't all that great and it has a shorter range then they can alter their style a bit to make use of its amazing power.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,sesstreets,1 point,Mon May 4 18:55:24 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't fall in the man at arms meta of stab feint to dodge out of parry because it is a little shorter.  It just doesn't fall in the vanguard meta of doing instant slash-riposte, abusing op knockback, and bad animations because...   I know the stabs are garbage; don't strawman me please. Secondly, nobody needs the banter and the implications that all MAA do a cyclical, unoriginal string of plays OR that this is somehow the reason why the falchion isn't viable. Real reason? Its terrible reach that doesn't have speed, weird overhead animations that hit above and to the left of the weapon, and exceptionally slow timings for being such a short sword PLUS the fact that there are strictly better options. Broad and Norse BOTH can two shot vanguards and the Broad can even 3 shot knights. Why use the falchion when the MStar can deal with every class in the game with better speed and easier blunt damage.  None of this game is in a vacuum. ""well some $foo do $bar so that's why they can't use $bin"" is not a good argument. A better counter argument against your point is the fact that to this day the only time I saw a falchion being used on a maa was raw boner doing a random loadout challenge."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,sesstreets,1 point,Mon May 4 19:30:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not straw manning, and sure the broad and Norse are comparable but you need to land stabs to the head to be able to pull off those hit to kills whereas the falchion has easier to land attacks that can accomplish the same job and I believe for vanguards you only need torso hits but I could be wrong I can't remember the numbers exactly right now and I can't get to the spreadsheet atm either. But Like I said it isnt a popular weapon because it falls outside the regular meta. The only time I don't see a man at arms using a Norse or broad is with chris who uses the flanged mace I believe. You can kind of compare it to the halberd pre handle buff where no one ever used it. It was always a decent and fair weapon but it was a little harder to use because of it's weird phase throughs and really slow windup times. It could be used effectively if you tried, but it wasn't going to be as effective as the traditional brandistock or zweihander or greats word or even the spear and billhook. Then people wanted it buffed for mercs and so it got handle hits to make it better and now people complain it is overpowered because it just became a really good weapon by making it fall closer within the meta of rewarding fast, hard to read if feinted attacks. I don't think the solution is to buff every weapon like crazy but rather have them all be viable if you choose to try it out. People said the Norse sword just wasn't good enough and direly ""needed"" the combo time buff in order to compete with the broadsword and now look it is extremely overpowered as it not only just combo flinches everything but it also two shots man at arms with the stab to the torso. Now it is a really amazing weapon with little drawback because people keep wanting buffs to suit their play styles. I say make weapons decent and average and then let the user take the weapon to the next level rather than let the weapon carry them.  Edit* I didn't realize that the change was never implemented could've sworn it was where Norse two shot maa but the argument still holds with the combo times"

ChivalryGame,34reqw,LordKefkaPalazzo,1 point,Mon May 4 08:05:34 2015 UTC,"I am unsure of that last point. Firstly, we already have a balance element in that you can carry more knives than axes. As for realism, do throwing knives travel farther than axes? Throwing knives may be lighter but as a result you cannot put as much force behind your throw. If anything I feel knives should go faster but axes should go farther."
ChivalryGame,34reqw,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,3,Mon May 4 06:47:38 2015 UTC,"quantity might be a balancing element, but it doesn't change the fact that no one would ever take throwing knives in a competitive scrim"

ChivalryGame,34reqw,LordKefkaPalazzo,2,Mon May 4 08:21:49 2015 UTC,"knives aren't effective because the time for throwables is just before an engagement, when both teams are getting close. this means you only have a limited amount of time to get your throws off before the melee begins, and if you still have throwables out by the time the engagement begins you're not being effective  knives take too long to get off, unlike axes where you can typically throw both axes by the time you get close"
ChivalryGame,34reqw,MrJoeSteam,1 point,Mon May 4 10:13:10 2015 UTC,I have to disagree with you on that I don't think I have ever seen people not be able to get their knives off on time. It really doesn't take that long.
ChivalryGame,34reqw,LordKefkaPalazzo,2,Mon May 4 17:17:19 2015 UTC,yeah you can get your knives off if you start throwing at long range where you'll miss or stay in mid-range while your team is engaging - either way throwing axes are faster and deal almost the same damage if you land everything
ChivalryGame,34reqw,drivingtexter,1 point,Mon May 4 17:40:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know, it actually feels like the velocity of the knives is greater and you have a better chance of landing more hits as you have more knives.

ChivalryGame,34reqw,ExileTheWolf,1 point,Mon May 4 18:13:12 2015 UTC,"The overhead, to me, is about aiming for the spot right about the hands as that seems to be the lowest spot for the tracer. The alt slash and alt overhead, I think, just have poor animations."

ChivalryGame,34qkoh,Lartin1995,4,Sun May 3 18:09:54 2015 UTC,the main thing that would make a difference in pubs is the immunity to feints. Although in a team scenario the shield knight can engage first so all of the enemy team will surround him letting his team to get around behind the enemy and stab them in the back. The shield knight really is a support class. The downside to the shield knight is that you cannot riposte making it virtually impossible to 2v1.
ChivalryGame,34qkoh,Arctomys,3,Sun May 3 18:19:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly, so in pub it's pointless you might as well go in without a shield. Kinda sucks as in duels I like using it but always hate the fact that people don't really lose stamina for hitting on shields."

Now its at like this awkward middleground where noone wants to use them and they dont block that many hits but its better than having them be useless or god-like.  Its difficult to balance shields i guess. I'd like them to feature more because it feels more realistic but as current balance is they just are not very useful."

ChivalryGame,34qkoh,DasHeadCrapHGN,0,Sun May 3 19:59:53 2015 UTC,"Mind you Chivalry's armor shows that it takes place in the late 15th century and shields had fallen almost completely out of favor by then. So no, in real life they would be useless not useful."
ChivalryGame,34qkoh,DasHeadCrapHGN,1 point,Mon May 4 03:07:21 2015 UTC,I didnt know this ^ guess i just like how shield fighting looks and also hollywood kinda ruins perceptions of medieval fighting.
ChivalryGame,34qkoh,Stael,0,Sun May 3 20:10:46 2015 UTC,"Because Hollywood doesn't know that weapons and armor did change a ton between 400 B.C. and 1400 A.D. Showing knights in full Gothic plate using swords and shields would be like showing U.S. marines in Iraq fighting with Silk body armor and muskets. Pole arms, pikes, and messer knives had taken to being the tools of the trade by 1480. Much like how in Chivalry Messer, Maul, and      Axe knights are meta opposed to sword of war and the likes."
ChivalryGame,34qkoh,MobiWanKenobi,0,Sun May 3 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"I find shield knights to be highly effective competitively. The largest reason is no one ever uses them so no one knows how to counter them. The downside I find is shields lose effectiveness compared to parrys when you're fighting multiple people where as I feel a shield is superior to a parry in a 1 v 1. Simply because you can't do all the animation block tricks to stop hoards of people with a shield. But as a knight going shieldless is fine since arrows glance off of you, you get one free head shot without dying, and you can parry with long swords, pole arms, short swords, and axes."
ChivalryGame,34q1dv,johnnyp1231,7,Sun May 3 15:17:18 2015 UTC,Don't use the tech preview for everyday use
ChivalryGame,34q1dv,CrazyViking,4,Sun May 3 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"That's probably good advice (there's a stupid Microsoft keylogger as part of the preview - that's right, I'm talking about you), but here's my experience.  I've been using the preview every day for some time now and haven't regretted it yet. It actually fixed some issues I was having with windows 8 (which a re-install would have fixed, granted), so that was nice.  I've personally only ran into one problem with game compatibility; F.E.A.R. 3 won't start-up for some reason, but that game is pretty meh to me anyways right now. But Chivalry, for instance, plays fine. I have 400+ games on steam ... I haven't tested nearly that many of them with Windows 10, but none of the ones I frequent have given me grief! Just F.E.A.R. 3 so far. Also, for whatever it's worth, you can set things to run in compatibility mode for different versions of Windows. Hell, I would try that with F.E.A.R. 3 if I really cared!  I can't promise that you'll have the same experience, but I would say that it's likely that it'll have minimal repercussions. If you only have a few games that you depend on playing, where one or even two games (just to be safe) not working would leave you very bored then it may not be worth the risk. If you have a decent library of games that you frequent, rest assured that pretty much all of them will work. And most probably Chivalry since it works for me :D.  Anyways, good luck in whatever you choose good sir!"

There have been some issues in the past with less than stellar frames, but that seems to have been worked out over the past few months.   I play on the 64 player servers pretty often and I don't have any problems. At least nothing specific to Chivalry.   One bug, if you happen to have a Corsair RGB k70, is that sometimes hitting the Caps Lock key can lock your system up and require a hard reboot. I've run into that maybe a half dozen times; doesn't seem to be every time I hit Caps, just sometimes. Since caps is in between ""sprint"" and ""scoreboard"" for me, it makes you a little nervous to hit it by mistake.   However, that's probably just a specific bug with my keyboard and the Corsair software. Chivalry should run fine for you."

ChivalryGame,34nzr5,Reithur,5,Mon May 4 14:26:25 2015 UTC,I think it's when there's an update.  If you've updated you'll only be able to see servers that have also updated.  If you haven't updated you'll only be able to see servers that also haven't updated.  Because not all servers update at the same time you end up with a split where half are on new version and half are on old version.  It resolves itself pretty quick though.  In my experience you're better off updating as quickly as possible to get the most active servers

ChivalryGame,34o7yf,BioshockEndingD00D,10,Sat May 2 23:58:29 2015 UTC,"Knight is the most broken and shittiest class in the game - by das truck  After reading the umpteenth thread regarding archers being op I'd like to try and put things into perspective and remind people of what the actual most unfair, under powered, and broken class is in chivalry: Knight.  Some may think we have fallen to complacency. Nah. Literally there were way better things to do than beat you over and over again with or without A roster, which ended up being more interesting than Chiv has gotten.  Please, remove stunning after you've been kicked when you wear shield, its absolutely non-realistic. Reduce damage from thrusting with such weapons as messer, sabre, maul, falchion.   Remove fork and brandistock, add warlance and pike(with great range), add one/two-handed spear for vanguard and shield for vanguard. Thats will be really historically correct. Need to write official petition i suppose?  Yarnu dog, hexen aci, and sir clay are all the best players in world. Pretty sure colonial star guys is good too. he make montage with music. He NEVER die in montage, and he always READ all feint en montage. But that whole nemesis clan is rlly good. best players. and most toxic clan NA.  He Doesn't Help, He Randoms and Spawn kills, if he gets hit He Fountain Chugs. (This was Within Syns Classic Duel Server) All in All, he randomed roughly 60 or so times, With around 50-55 of those being spawn kills. He is NOT what the Community is to be. Randoming and Spawn killing in a CLASSIC duel server (Apparently he doesn't understand what that is despite Multiple explanations).  The last fun thing Nemesis did as a clan was play fucking Chivalry: Deadliest Warrior. Shit was fun though, we would all stack one class like Pirates and make a fucking Revolutionary War firing line and just mow the ninjas who would eventually overwhelm us when we missed or ran out of ammo. Great Palaceer strategy (who is the 2nd best Palaceer in the game) is to throw firepot and then shoot them with shotgun in the duelyard mode. Palaceer read ALL feint en montage and Colonial NEVER dodge en montage, but that Renatus guy is best Longsword knight NA because he kills tearofgrace and doesn't afraid of anything.  Those apex, f, and T guys aren't much compared to Palaceer. Palaceer is the best player I've ever seen. He is 150% better than me in all aspects. He uses every mechanic of the game to his advantage. Palaceer will win this fight over Mayweather, calling it.  On the behalf of Memesis, I'd like to thank Height for hosting this memeament. This was the first memeament for every single memer in our lineup, and we learned that there is a lot more to learn about memework and strategy from our matches. It was incredibly challenging and fun, and we got a great first impression of memeaments. Also thanks to the memers of the teams we faced that exhibited good memesmanship and spirit. Without players like those, tournaments like these would not be possible. Each team we faced were tough to fight, forcing us to bring out the best of us.  This used to be a good game, until everyone took advantage of the extremely broken mechanics....... for starters blocking is now obsolete as the knights and vanguards do some ballerina stuff.... do some spins and your dead. Also there is this thing called the chase mechanic, where knight or vanguard (the slowest classes) can catch up with man at arms (the fastest class) and then one shot you. This game NEEDS to be fixed, its complete **** at the moment.

I would wonder why some people's attacks are ""faster"".  In fact, now that I am a rank 53, people say that to me ""how do you make your weapon so fast.."" and so on.   Honestly there is no secret perk, or anything.  Often times high rank players play at a much higher ""tempo"" than lower ranked players.  They see and recognize alot of moves and can react to them much faster.  They also know the timings of weapons very well and know that they can interrupt or flinch attacks.  When you factor in skilled drags or accels that hide animations + better footwork, it really does seem like higher ranks have faster swings. All I can say to you:  practice a lot if you wanna get better.  Play those guys that destroy everyone else on the server.

ChivalryGame,34lpyp,seandamiller,4,Sat May 2 19:46:08 2015 UTC,"ex. You swing, but miss. Your opponent attacks to hit you during your recovery. Instead, you start a combo but then feint the combo. Now you're back at the idle position and can parry the incoming attack. If you feint the combo just when it starts, it looks like you never started a combo."

ChivalryGame,34lpyp,arhythm,1 point,Sat May 2 21:00:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, so starting the second swing of a combo and feinting/parrying is faster than waiting for the 1st swing to snap back to idle and then parrying?"
ChivalryGame,34lpyp,PostPostModernism,2,Sat May 2 20:49:08 2015 UTC,Yup. Allows you to return to idle and then parry faster than letting the 1 attack finish and then parry.
ChivalryGame,34lpyp,kyle_gibson,1 point,Sat May 2 21:50:39 2015 UTC,"coasterman covered it pretty well.  But just in case it's not clear, the point of this is to let you parry more quickly after a missed attack.  Whenever someone is able to block your counterattack immediately after they miss swinging at you, it's because they did cftp.  Don't try to abuse it because it takes a good bit of stam to do (stam from missing a swing + from feinting).  But it's valuable if you mess up in a duel.    Also I hope it's obvious, but if not: this only works with weapons that can combo.  Stuff like the spear class and javelins don't have the option of comboing, so they can't do cftp.  It's their bigger downside to make up for being really good otherwise."
ChivalryGame,34lpyp,PostPostModernism,-1,Sat May 2 20:16:57 2015 UTC,"So basically it's just parrying right after a missed swing, because we cnn call feinting and parrying the same thing in this case. This comes pretty natural, it didn't know is was a strategy needing designation like that.  Edit: so apparently starting a combo and feinting/parrying the second swing is faster than waiting for the 1st swing to snap back to idle and parrying then, is the point?"
ChivalryGame,34lpyp,YourMoneyOrYourLife,1 point,Sat May 2 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"It's a deliberate tactic.  Normally if you miss a swing, there's a delay in which you can't parry or do anything but move around, so your opponent (if they're quick) can get a free hit in.  But the way the game divides up time for different activities, there's almost no delay between initiating a combo, feinting an attack, and turning that feint into a parry.  Those three things can all happen almost instantly after one another, and much faster than if you wait for the delay after a normal swing to parry.

And I love how you're always watching everything around you.  0:05 is a great example.  You block one guy, and turn around to block the other but you don't actually block unless you see an incoming attack.  And then when you kick stun the shield knight, you don't go in for the hit because you see the vangaurd coming in from behind.  If I were in that position, I'd definitely go for the kill or do some ROH just because he can't do anything about it but then I'd get hit by the vanguard and get mad about vanguard charges.  Also, that double beheading at 1:42 was hilarious."

ChivalryGame,34jx38,aStarving0rphan,7,Fri May 1 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"Some of you may remember my quote from spook's post:  ""When the dying light first peeped into existence, we all saw it. We all knew the end was coming. But rather abandon ship that instant, some of us stayed aboard, knowing good and well where that ship was heading. We battened down the hatches, raised up the sails, had all hands on deck, for we knew it would be a rough and bumpy ride. We knew that those who jumped ship when they first saw the light wouldn't be the last to leave us before it was all over. No, there would be many to follow in their path, even those who we thought would make it to the end. Those that could say they fought the good fight, that they sailed the good voyage. But even they falter, even they wary, even they, those who we thought would lead us, who would stand until the end, must step down. And tonight, as we say goodbye to another member of the crew, we say it not filled with sadness, not enraged by anger, not bitter out of spite, but happy, happy to have shared in the experiences along the way. May we remember them til the end.""  Steve ""Papa John"" Jobs  And the one from Omega's:  ""And now, as the second Titan succumbs to the beckoning sea, we remain steadfast, ever mindful of the light breaking over the horizon. The storm is ever stronger, the wind, gusting sideways over the ship, it will blow the weaker over. ""Can we not but mourn over our fallen comrades?"" many of you will say. But you must never tarry, the fight requires your entire attention, those who don't give it all are tempted to jump by the things they see off the ship.  Don't go quietly by the light, for the light deceives you. You must always struggle and fight, with a fervor anew.  You'll lose friends along the way, these you knew all too well. Dying is the light which you see today, like a prisoner,trapped in a cell.  Death shall come in its wake, the world will ever quake, in the rays of the dying light. But in the end it won't matter, men will be ever sadder, in remembrance of our plight.  Don't go quietly into the light, don't go quietly into the dying Light.""   Osama ""420 Blaze it"" Bin Laden   But now we have one for Golden:  ""Long ago men warned us of this Light, the ever present Light.  The Light, which at the mere mention of it's name, brought fear into the hearts of lions.  They told us to watch for it, but not to wait on it, for it wasn't worth waiting on, but it was worth watching out for.  Because it is dangerous.  The Light can tear apart the closest of bonds, destroy the truest of friendships, and instill terror into the bravest of men.  Seeing two of our comrades now, lying dead in the ocean's water, may scare some of you.  But, as I have said before, Let it not make you weak!  Be strengthened by their spirits, that is what they would wish for you.  Today, we celebrate a crew member stepping down from the rail of the ship, tempted ever so by the calling waves.  Not that they are calm and peaceful, but that the stormy waves seem to posses a more pleasant fate than what lies ahead of us.  We stay together, we fight together, we die together!""

ChivalryGame,34lcit,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,3,Sat May 2 05:23:35 2015 UTC,It just isn't fun for competitive as there is nothing forcing players to make contact and furthermore the game mode was kind of ruined by torn banners implementation of the icons above people's heads at the end of the round. I believe they can be disabled but it's still annoying to have to do that and make sure the server runs properly and all.
ChivalryGame,34lcit,ia_Flame,3,Sat May 2 08:11:32 2015 UTC,I like lts with no archers. Easier to arrange 3v3s than full TO's as well.

ChivalryGame,34lcit,Chuckdatass,2,Sat May 2 14:47:39 2015 UTC,"2v2/3v3 is fine, anything more is just a fester pit of mauls. Slightly more bearable when you go 3v3+ on merc mod, however. Wouldn't advise it though  archers aren't allowed in comp LTS either, why? because archers aren't fun to play against and your team are going to get smashed by the TRUE WARRIORS while your rat archer sits at the back and potentially manages to get 1shot off before his team dies 3v2"

ChivalryGame,34kj8e,TrooperDave,4,Sun May 3 14:58:07 2015 UTC,"Wow! I didn't realize anyone thought this way. I personally think dueling the last player on the other teams shows respect for him makes the game much more exciting because the losing team could still come back. IMO, if the last guy makes it through 3 or so duels he's earned the victory for his team."
ChivalryGame,34kj8e,Occidental666,9,Sat May 2 18:45:28 2015 UTC,"But it's not duels. It's a team game mode.  If your interested in 'respect' and proving your own abilities pay duels or FFA. Having more teammates by the end and sweeping is the point of the game mode. Reducing it to duels renders any team play pointless. Just like teaming in FFA it goes against the spirit of the game mode, and robs the majority of players eliminated of play time.  And no I don't think a team made of a majority mediocre players and one good player deserves a win via dueling. If he can fight multiple players simultaneously, all working against him then they deserve a win, because he's proven he's capable in a team fighting situation."

ChivalryGame,34kj8e,Casserino,3,Wed May 6 10:45:43 2015 UTC,"hear for the ripostes? lately the game doesn't even play the parry sound and visual fx for me  besides, I barely ever feel the need to reverse. There are lots of other viable attacks  This wasn't a rant on reverses because I can't deal with them. It's because I usually feel the opponent would literally fight better without it."
ChivalryGame,34kj8e,MajorGrempington,1 point,Wed May 6 10:50:57 2015 UTC,"sucks to be  you haha, I hear perfectly fine, and you can see them riposte wtih shadows and everything,"
ChivalryGame,34kj8e,Casserino,2,Wed May 6 10:53:09 2015 UTC,"by the way cass when you saw me lose so many duels it was basically because I barely get the chance to duel the really good players compared to how many times they duel each other, so when I do I'm still out of shape compared to them. Not to mention I lack practice with feints.   So if you want we can duel some just like I do sometimes with giru. Most old duel servers nowadays are either laggy or filled with lowranks trying to find that same group of players to rek them. I never considered myself top good to begin with"

The production value and passion by few for the game are at a ridiculous all time high, we've never seen anything like this. Having the finals of a tournament stream used to be cool, now we can have ever since game streamed with, I know it sounds small, but dozens of viewers on each.   It's not dead by any means. There's a lot of active teams and still quite a few vets from the old age of DAG still about. It's changed, the scene and the game, but not to any extremes.   The game won't go out in  a bang, like some seemingly suppose; instead, it will be like most games and die in a whimper a year or so down the line.   The actions of a few community members have made immeasurable gains, both in the past and now, and they are what keeps the scene and the game alive. It's Important to recognize both so he efforts they make can feel worthwhile.  Im excited to see how the scene moves now. It's open to new ideas, strategies, and a slew of new players ready to join the fray. I'll be trying to take a more active part streaming/casting (I'll put vods on here) and doing some scrims."
ChivalryGame,34jxm1,HELPMEIMGONADIE,3,Fri May 1 20:19:40 2015 UTC,"I agree in the idea that the production value by certain players is very high at the moment compared to the past. While there may have been more activity in the past, there is still interest in keeping the game alive by many.  I just have this fear that people claiming the game is dead will make the game dead."
ChivalryGame,34jxm1,HELPMEIMGONADIE,3,Fri May 1 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"Not many people are making it, other than those in teams who's toxicity and ego destroyed them far in the past.   It's not even just certain players pushing production value, it's everyone. It's impressive"
ChivalryGame,34jxm1,beermatt,3,Fri May 1 20:26:21 2015 UTC,"Relatively casual player here, but I'm going to have the balls to speak up about something like this.  I've seen similar things in the past with other games, where a handful of competitive players/clans think the game revolves around them.  Do you literally mean keeping THE GAME alive, or your specific competitions and tournaments?  Torn Banner is here to make a profit, all game companies are, and there's nothing wrong with that if you go about it the right way.  It's in Torn Banner's interest to get the game to appeal to a wide user base as possible, because correct me if I'm wrong but it seems that's how they make their money.  I don't know much about this, so asking a genuine question - do any of these tournaments, clans, and competitive play actually bring in any revenue for TB?  I'm not saying they don't but I can't see how.  You buy the game once, and then expect TB to continually release patches, bug fixes, etc, just to support your partiuclar play style for free.  You might criticise noobs etc, but new players are the ones BUYING the game, that's what makes TB money, and unless I'm missing something that's what literally keeps the game alive."

The only clans that I can think of that really scrim often are Meta, Syndicate, Phoenix, Moorland, Genesis, LG, Fight Club, Rangers, and maybe Omega. Have they been participating in more scrims lately?  With such a small competitive community, Bellator and Tempest going down is not good. I don't think that Bellator and Tempest leaving the chiv comp scene is confirmed, but it seems very likely with the players leaving."

ChivalryGame,34jxm1,MostToxicplayer,1 point,Sat May 2 00:50:51 2015 UTC,"Just throwing this out there, but I have a theory/hunch this scene will never die. It is a hopeful and admittedly biased one on my part. But consider the gameplay itself. Honestly, outside of some single player stuff, I've not seen a multiplayer game with melee mechanics comparable to Chiv. Now I don't think Chivalry is necessarily always going to be the home of this scene. With the development of, what, at least two other games (?) taking on Chiv's melee mechanics and doing whatever they're trying to do, I could see the scene shifting to a competitor. It really depends on which developer is willing to step up and improve on balancing, bug fixing, and integration with competitive playstyle. In all honesty when the other games are finished being devved, I'm SERIOUSLY hoping they will actually be good playable games to compete with Chivalry, possibly even for the sake of forcing Torn Banner to step up their game and make this shit better. Who knows? Maybe their new project is Chiv 2 (part of me doubts it), if not I hope they don't throw Chivalry under the bus and end all fixing. But iirc they did just kind of announce an end to major patching, didn't they?  As for this game being dead, yeah it's not there yet. But with the problems servers have been having with desyncing and just general crashing (I have seen more server crashing in the last month than I have in the two years of playing this game) we are definitely in a stagnant period. A pity because I JUST got a friend of mine into this damn game, and it's embarassing the kinds of problems it has. So far it hasn't deterred him thankfully."
ChivalryGame,34jxm1,MostToxicplayer,1 point,Sat May 2 16:15:52 2015 UTC,Unfortunately they announced the opposite of major patching. They announced no more valence fixes and that they are focusing on their new project.  Enter mercs mod and the balance council.

ChivalryGame,34j7wi,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Fri May 1 17:53:25 2015 UTC,"It's just the latest instalment of the slow-burning cash grab that began with Deadliest Warrior. I don't particularly mind anymore, but it just seems to me like the patches are few and far between these days, and all I've really noticed recently is TBS pumping out cosmetic fluff.  By all means generate income through DLC if you're struggling, but this seems misguided to me. The skin quality is great, and a patch with a handful of fixes is certainly better than no patch... But i'd sooner pay for a map pack, game modes or something that actually adds more depth to the game instead of a bizarrely themed set of skins bundled with a few meagre map fixes. TBS gonna TBS."
ChivalryGame,34j7wi,King-Zog,4,Fri May 1 18:40:44 2015 UTC,"Most of this stuff is made by the community, even the maps. They should be implementing the new maps soon next patch for free."
ChivalryGame,34j7wi,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Fri May 1 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"True. Well, i've got my moneys worth 100x over from this game. It's just that a high quality map pack or something similar is exactly the kind of thing I would happily pay for. Not something cosmetic that will probably only appeal to a very niche selection of the player base. I'm not trying to sound like an entitled dickhead, it's just disappointing to see a brand new patch only to find out that it's simply another set of skins."
ChivalryGame,34j7wi,King-Zog,2,Fri May 1 19:18:21 2015 UTC,Also a tad disappointment they did no include more community made artwork :(

ChivalryGame,34j7wi,King-Zog,2,Fri May 1 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, TB have abandoned the game. All the updates will be meant just for small fixes or money stuff.

ChivalryGame,34hey2,Charles_K,2,Fri May 1 05:59:55 2015 UTC,just imagine if they gave Chiv a story mode. Where you would have a cutscene or something and you would then go into a real battle and the outcome of that battle would affect the next scene and the rest of the story...

ChivalryGame,34hey2,ColonelHerro,2,Sat May 2 13:12:46 2015 UTC,"I've always thought you could just about string the original chiv maps into a coherent timeline - someone a while back worked out some possible orders, all I remember was Stoneshill came after Dark Forest (you hear MaA yell about a valley in Dark Forest, and on Stoneshill you hear them say they've got through the valley).   You could even see some of the characters from the tutorial in spawn, yelling the objective - that'd be a nice touch."
ChivalryGame,34hey2,Charles_K,2,Fri May 1 08:44:47 2015 UTC,"You are correct, the map list order is mostly chronological with random ass barbarians in snow and the jungle added.  Hillside is interesting, not sure where that one belongs."
ChivalryGame,34hey2,ColonelHerro,6,Fri May 1 11:12:27 2015 UTC,"I'm going to quote /u/bi11y10, whose comment I found:   TO maps are technically a storyline. It starts with Agatha returning from a crusade and finding the masons have taken control of the capitol (Battlegrounds map). The masons react to the loss at Battlegrounds by killing Feydrid (Stoneshill) and also poisoning the water supply and killing the heirs to the Agathian throne (Darkforest).  Agatha says fuck all that noise and head straight (After moving through the coast which is the map Hillside) to Mount Doom and cut Malrics head off after freeing all their dirty peasants (Citadel).  That's the story that Team Objective maps tell.   Another version I've heard has Hillside as the first map, as it's the one where the Agathian fleet returns from crusade - I guess it could fit in before Battlegrounds."
ChivalryGame,34hey2,Anti-assholes_police,3,Fri May 1 11:32:51 2015 UTC,This reinforces my point that a multiplayer-campaign game mode like Max Payne 3's would be a huge success.

ChivalryGame,34h14d,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Fri May 1 17:55:18 2015 UTC,I won't say for spoilers sake!
ChivalryGame,34h14d,MobiWanKenobi,2,Fri May 1 20:22:45 2015 UTC,I've never seen the game as anything other than 1v1 or at most 2v2 when it comes to competitive.
ChivalryGame,34h14d,Keiji99,1 point,Fri May 1 13:24:08 2015 UTC,"Well here you go! Sizes can vary a lot.   In fact, I'd argue that duels aren't terribly competitive at all. Teams are what make the scene interesting, complex, difficult, and innovative."
ChivalryGame,34gt0z,Clayton-BigsB,8,Fri May 1 00:54:51 2015 UTC,i think he's referring to flinch.  for me.. when archers stop my parry... oooooh i want to rip a peice of paper straight in half i'm so mad.
ChivalryGame,34gt0z,Kapparoo_LoL,7,Fri May 1 13:10:10 2015 UTC,An entire piece of paper? I think you may need anger management counselling.
ChivalryGame,34gt0z,BioshockEndingD00D,3,Fri May 1 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, love some maa hitting you from behind followed by having to eat that delicious maul overhead. I don't think it's whine about because it's pretty rare, but yeah, it's retarded."

ChivalryGame,34gt0z,feeeggsdragdad,1 point,Fri May 1 01:33:40 2015 UTC,"Hes talking about FLINCHING. I at least that what im interpreting. Also you can only ""Block"" with a shield, anything else is a parry which is more of a deflection in real life."
ChivalryGame,34gt0z,CoasterMan,1 point,Fri May 1 05:33:54 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, when you say block do you mean a shield or parrying without a shield? Parries are supposed to be instant (I think), if you parry and get hit it's because you either weren't looking at the weapon or latency. When blocking with a shield, your shield must be raised for it to block an attack (which is not instant), and so you have to right click earlier than when parrying.  You can get stunned only if you get heavy kicked while your shield is raised or if you parry/block an attack with no stamina. I can't think of any other actual stuns.  If a player plays perfectly they could potentially defeat 6 opponents, but it's more likely that they would either miss a parry and die to trades, or run out of stamina from constant feint to parries."
ChivalryGame,34gt0z,ia_Flame,1 point,Fri May 1 02:25:10 2015 UTC,"OK, ima try again. Not only with shields, also with parries, as in, BEFORE your actual damage preventing part of the block/parry with a sword OR shield or anything else, is a short point in the animation that is the block equivalent to wind up. that parry or block windup can be stunned, by anything, so the block doesn't go through"
ChivalryGame,34gt0z,iam__,4,Fri May 1 02:31:53 2015 UTC,"This is just flinching. If you are hit by something and don't parry it then you go into a brief state where you are kind of a potato more or less and can't do much. In the current live version projectiles do not do this to you. What they do in fact do is stop your sprint and they can mess with animations so you will parry but it might not show up on screen. If you are talking about flinching, which I believe you are as it is the only explanation, it is a vital part of this game and it is what allows people to be killed aside from stamina otherwise you would be able to parry while being hit in the face by Something else and thus render you only able to take damage from one opponent at a time. This would severely dumb down gameplay in that it would be too easy to survive and hit trade thereafter."
ChivalryGame,34eomm,JasonLavoie,2,Thu Apr 30 15:06:59 2015 UTC,would be a cool warbow over longbow but very nice!
ChivalryGame,34eomm,yrdraziWciretosE,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:18:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks yrdrazi, it looks like both the Longbow and Warbow need some attention so if this set gets in I would be more than happy to look into doing a Warbow as well.   I love hearing what you all are looking for in items, please keep sharing your ideas!"
ChivalryGame,34eomm,ia_Flame,2,Fri May 1 00:06:10 2015 UTC,Maybe a darker almost sleek black version of the warbow. Just something to make it not look simply like a stick with some string on it

Chivalry, at this point in time, is a bad habit akin to smoking fags. It was fun and cool at first, but the buzz no longer competes with the headaches and coughing.  I'm done as well, just haven't formally come out with it yet. Tried my damnedest to keep myself interested and the game relevant with that shitty CME series... but it's just over, and has been for a while.  The game just isn't fun to play anymore and the youtube counterpart has become rather unfulfilling as well. I could shoot, edit and upload a video of my cat being a dork in 20 minutes and get the same kind of feedback as Chivalry videos requiring multiple hours of editing.  Like you said, it's been one hell of a ride, and a fun one for much of the time, but it is time to part ways and say a fond farewell.   Again, good for you spook. We'll see you around ;)"

ChivalryGame,34c6ka,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,4,Fri May 1 02:04:53 2015 UTC,"""When the dying light first peeped into existence, we all saw it.  We all knew the end was coming.  But rather abandon ship that instant, some of us stayed aboard, knowing good and well where that ship was heading.  We battened down the hatches, raised up the sails, had all hands on deck, for we knew it would be a rough and bumpy ride.  We knew that those who jumped ship when they first saw the light wouldn't be the last to leave us before it was all over.  No, there would be many to follow in their path, even those who we thought would make it to the end.  Those that could say they fought the good fight, that they sailed the good voyage.  But even they falter, even they wary, even they, those who we thought would lead us, who would stand until the end, must step down.  And tonight, as we say goodbye to another member of the crew, we say it not filled with sadness, not enraged by anger, not bitter out of spite, but happy, happy to have shared in the experiences along the way.

I'm not done with chiv myself, but I've been moving between some other games so that when i play chiv i can maybe not take it seriously anymore or just have a little fun playing.   EU comp scene dead, NA comp scene being kept alive by mercs and i'm pretty certain that if mercs didn't come about the vanilla comp scene would have already died.  The game is almost too frustratingly broken and abandoned by the developers that the people that once loved and appreciated the strike of genius that shot torn banner in the ass are the only ones really keeping it alive. (and of course those that know no better) Sure it's still fun to fuck around in and nice to have a good game vs. good players, but it's just a complete mess and torn banner is ghost town mode (like the forums).  Plus, there's tons of really fun NOT broken games to play. For instance a post a week or 2 back was all like... damn chiv dead cuz gta5 came out. Well there's a good reason for that, GTAV functions well, is fun and not a frustrating broken mess... and did I mention it's fun?  anyhow, long story short... sad to see ya go. Hopefully we'll still see ya around the teamspeak. And don't forget to pop in on my shitty streams... maybe i'll make it seem fun enough to play for about 20 minutes lol. (tomorrow 9pm est)"

ChivalryGame,34c6ka,Kesby,2,Thu Apr 30 08:57:51 2015 UTC,"FUCK that. Dota breeds contempt among your friends. The game is absolutely toxic unless all 5 of you are of near equal skill and not a single one of you is the kind to cry during video games. You need absolute perfect life-is-only-sustainable-on-planet-Earth conditions to have 5 friends playing matchmaking Dota and have fun. Unless you're playing an inhouse. Shit is really fun and hilarious then.  Hell, I remember reading some Christian Gamer review on Dota 2. ""Fellow worshippers were berating each other, sighing under their breaths, and distancing themselves playing the game. Imagine how secular people would treat one another?""  FUCK that. I am extremely reluctant to play Dota 2 with anyone other than my brother because he is like the only person I know IRL who is any good + isn't a fucking crybaby.  At least we can shoot the shit (literally and figuratively) in CS:GO. Or Heroes of the Storm, aka casual Dota (and much more fun with the mechanics and game design, not nearly as arbitrary as Dota's weirder shit). Fuck, you can't even enjoy the very things that make Dota interesting 90% of the time in pubs. Can't even pick the FUCKING HERO YOU WANT TO PLAY most of the time. Imagine in a scrim, ""Oh, I main Knight, I want to play Knigth OH WAIT MY TEAM ALREADY PICKED 5 KNIGHTS NOW I'M FORCED TO PLAY FUCKING ARCHER""."

ChivalryGame,349t2y,gentlemandinosaur,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:24:50 2015 UTC,It's idolizing to me frankly.
ChivalryGame,349t2y,gentlemandinosaur,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:00:14 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree. Considering I have unbound dodge altogether and primary as an MAA.   And though I am not the best... I think plenty of people can attest that I can be quite a fucker on the battlefield. I have not used a single dodge in almost a year.   Sure, it took me a long time to get good without dodge. But, its a crutch and I won't use it.   Footwork is the main advantage that MAA has. With stab reach being the second.   And I don't even know what to say about saying the broadsword is ""weak"". That is just laughable.   So, I guess in my opinion... anyone that says that MAA NEEDS dodge to be usable just does not know how to play MAA, really. I am pretty fucking good without it."
ChivalryGame,349t2y,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Wed Apr 29 16:15:12 2015 UTC,"Being good at something doesn't mean it's viable. Just because I'm good at fork doesn't mean it's a good. The same thing goes with MAA not using dodge -- just because you're good with it does not make it viable. MAA would simply be the weakest class in the game when it comes to team fights in a competitive format.  Anyways, playing in pubs as a MAA and saying you're good at it does not really say much. You can literally stare at 75% people in face hug and people and they parry you. It's laughable. I would love to see how well you would fare in a competitive scrim without dodge with people more on your level.   Edit: had to bold and clarify."
ChivalryGame,349t2y,gentlemandinosaur,-3,Wed Apr 29 17:10:05 2015 UTC,"Viable - capable of working successfully; feasible  I think you are confused as to exactly WHAT viable means. I am quite good at it and I am only an above average vet. I am no where near as good as say Spook with MAA. Spook would beat my ass all the time. So, if I can do it... any MAA can do it.   I do play with F|C in scrims. And I do not use the official pubs much.... so.... Mostly I stay in F|C servers. Which though are public consistently play with a 45+ crowd."
ChivalryGame,349t2y,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,4,Wed Apr 29 17:16:24 2015 UTC,"Here, let's nitpick another definition of viable:  Viable- having a reasonable chance of succeeding &amp;lt;a viable candidate>   What you propose is just not viable. An MAA without dodge is no better than a vanguard. Vanguard gets one and two shot by significantly less weapons and has much more damage and range than any other MAA weapon. And let's not act like they're that much slower either. The fact is that the vanguard is much more viable and reasonable than a MAA.   The saving grace however for MAA is its dodge which can help them get out of trouble. All it takes is one one miscalculated mistake, and you are done, bang. That's why the dodge is so important; without it, it's incredibly difficult to play. Of course there will be a few exceptions to the rule such as Alice or you but that's a very small pool of players and both you and Alice are crippling yourselves holding onto your code of ""honor"" by not using a ""crutch"" mechanic. It's simply not feasible compared to the other classes. It's hard to play because you can't afford to make any mistakes and only dodge can save you. unless you can read every feint and defend against any drag, you're in trouble because everybody else has bigger, faster, and stronger weapons than you that will destroy you. MAA would be so easy to kill without dodge."
ChivalryGame,349t2y,gentlemandinosaur,0,Wed Apr 29 17:45:04 2015 UTC,"Like I said in a previous comment. I will give you the ""one mistake you are dead"" thing. I concede that is totally true.   But I do not think that makes it unviable. Just takes a change in mentality. I don't face hug... I am team oriented... And I am an opportunist. I use mind games and rely on common play tactics of others. It's one of the reasons I do poorly again spook. Sure he has patterns but he also can read incredibly well and adapts effectively. Once someone starts adapting to my ""unconventional"" play style my chances of success drop, admittedly.   But to be honest I wouldn't have it any other way. I like running around like a fool and dancing my way out.   It seems to work well in TO scrims against people on average much better than me. But there are individuals that absolutely wipe the floor with me.   But fine, I concede you might be right about it not being for everyone. But I still think it's completely viable and MAAs should not be written off if they didn't have dodge.   If that day comes guess who will rule the roost? :D"
ChivalryGame,349t2y,Anti-assholes_police,0,Wed Apr 29 17:58:41 2015 UTC,"They still have norse feints and speed, and the insane drag capacity of the Dane axe, the latter being pretty powerful on mercs -- it's like a little messer on a MAA's hand. How would the MAA become useless?"
ChivalryGame,349t2y,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,4,Wed Apr 29 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"Because the Dane isn't as near as strong as messer, and they get 1 shot by most weapons. A single target switch on them from behind and there goes their head. In a game where it's still very easy to force hittrades and gambling, they're fucked. MAA needs dodge out of parry because one mistake and they're gg. Knight, however, can make several more mistakes due to their large amount of health.   They are only good at duels honestly, but I would much rather take a vanguard to a team fight which is much easier to learn."
ChivalryGame,349t2y,gentlemandinosaur,2,Wed Apr 29 15:51:42 2015 UTC,"I will give you the ""one mistake"" part. That is true.   Just not related to dodge. But if they fuck up in anything they do they are dead. Makes them more technical to me. But I feel Knights are the most balanced and skillful class to play."
ChivalryGame,349t2y,Anti-assholes_police,0,Wed Apr 29 17:49:55 2015 UTC,"Why do we keep comparing MAA and Knight classes? It makes sense with VG and K but not with MAA. MAAs are supposed to be unbalanced. They do not offer brawn, they offer brain. Their speed and maneuvering is very useful in the right hands. MAAs are great for supporting teams and doing objectives. With firepots, they can reduce the necessary hits to kill their opponents in 1 or 2. With shields, they can outflank you, distract you and/or focus on the objective.  Just because they can't kill as much as a knight doesn't mean they're completely useless. And if a player panics and parries too early, 2 bad. That's why shields exist."

It's been so long since I've heard anyone complain about MAA. It's almost nostalgic.  With Mercs mod slowly becoming the standard for competitive Chiv and seeing as how it's still in fairly early stages of balancing I think there should definitely be some discussion about the class. Finding a balance is a tough proposition when you have to factor in the relevance of footwork and stamina management, as well as the higher learning curve that may lead to in both fighting as and against the MAA.  It's easy to bump percentages just because people on both sides don't know how to adapt, but the solution is never that easy. MAA will never be balanced (to the point where people stop bitching) in vanilla but there is definitely an opportunity with competitive mods.  And maybe we can do something about the broadsword's pike stab."

You feint, they parry, realize mistake and backdodge, you chase, and by the time you reach them they have parry ready again. If they fail that parry, guess what, dodge is ready again. It's a stam war that the heavy loses."
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,TobiwanK3nobi,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:24:25 2015 UTC,"How do you read if someone will do a dodge? Even if you do you have to feint and lose 15 stamina for it, at the worse case scenario you miss the attack and have to CFtP because they decide to attack right after the dodge causing you to lose around 40 stamina."
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,Xylvion,5,Thu Apr 30 11:49:43 2015 UTC,But then your just playing MaA as a knight with less health and worse weapons (except for firepot).
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,bi11y10,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:05:46 2015 UTC,There has to be some middle ground.
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,sesstreets,5,Thu Apr 30 16:57:48 2015 UTC,I mean there is middle ground but the class is so squishy and just not good in team fights that there has to be some useful mechanic like this to have it stand out from other classes.
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,bi11y10,-5,Thu Apr 30 17:02:09 2015 UTC,I want dodge taken out and I want raw acceleration slightly increased AND max run speed increased. Maa should be a small slippery dude that crosses great distances fast and has the ability to switch between targets slightly easier than the other 3 classes due to being able to jet the fuck out of a bad engagement.  But no more dodge. It's so dumb.
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,sesstreets,4,Thu Apr 30 17:13:59 2015 UTC,"""I want dodge taken out"" lol come on man. At least come up with a realistic fix, the other suggestions were at least decent."
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,bi11y10,-4,Thu Apr 30 17:21:20 2015 UTC,"There is literally not a single relevant fix in this thread. If you know of what other people are considering a fair fix then I'm all ears because I haven't heard.  It's not 'just remove dodge lol' the fact that a maa has higher acceleration means they don't need dodging and the distance running will actually wind up being very fair but very powerful. Got lmb mastered by a messer? Well guess what, even though you're attacking on DF and the cart is by the bridge, if your team backs up a little you'll be able to meet up with them in no time.  Sidepoint: Chase mechanic is really bad right now but imagine maa's being able to reach that speed by just running in a straight line."
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,sesstreets,3,Thu Apr 30 17:24:31 2015 UTC,"Tb buffed chase mechanic, if you can aim your cursor correctly you can chase any class as a knight so don't blame that.   And I honestly believe there doesn't need to be a change. If your willing to play a class like MaA with the limited range and such low health you should be rewarded with the ability to dodge. Even dodge out of parry.  So many people complain about dodge out of parry. Yet if a MaA does it even just twice you can stam them out so easily as a knight or van. It's just a matter of parry-riposte at that point.  And besides weren't you talking about how maa isn't as op as other classes like a week ago with flame making the argument that you should be able to dodge out of parry a halberd? Seems as though you have a totally different stance in the span of a week.  There are counters to every class, Dodge out of parry is part of MaAs ability to counter say a heavy knight or spammy vanguard."
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,bi11y10,-5,Thu Apr 30 17:38:36 2015 UTC,Yet if a MaA does it even just twice you can stam them out so easily as a knight or van. It's just a matter of parry-riposte at that point.   That's wrong though. Actually in a 1v1 situation a maa is able to 100% win based on stamina using kicks and dodge out of parry.   And besides weren't you talking about how maa isn't as op as other classes like a week ago with flame making the argument that you should be able to dodge out of parry a halberd? Seems as though you have a totally different stance in the span of a week.   MAA isn't op like other classes but I don't want it to be op; just balanced without game breaking techniques. At the same time I feel that dodge out of active parry breaks the fundamentals of the game. If that's what you got out of my points from my conversation with flame then you're missing out a whole bunch (and I think so did he).
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,sesstreets,5,Thu Apr 30 17:55:05 2015 UTC,"maa is able to 100% win based on stamina using kicks   You surely cant be serious, did you just say to use kicks? The most inconsistent mechanic in the game by far. Maybe very skilled MaA vs a lesser skilled player could do this, but we're talking about Mercs Mod and the competitive scene here, attempting to do that will get you Messer 1-Shotted really quickly.   MAA isn't op like other classes   So you agree that other classes are inherently better than MaA! Therefore your argument to further nerf your own class just doesnt make sense to me.   It's just strange that you have been so Pro-MaA in the past and anti anything good against them, that you now have hopped on the hate Dodge out of Parry bandwagon. This is also strange considering every time I play against you, you dodge out of parry very liberally."

Outside of duels, 1 maa is not going to win a TO or LTS by dodging out of parry. MAA does not need to be nerfed."

ChivalryGame,34cdf2,sesstreets,5,Thu Apr 30 16:58:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not SUPER pro dodge out of parry. In fact, I hate that it's in the game. There are a lot of things in this game that I hate, but I also realize they can't be changed while attempting to maintain balance. Vanguards have the best weapons in the game and can target switch with ease even when they’re seemingly out of position because of their ludicrous reach and damage. Knights have several weapons that one shot the other classes while still being able to tank and gamble, think about how many mistakes a knight can make in a fight (The answer: quite a few). Archers can sit on the objective AND point-and-click at everybody from a distance.  MAA is balanced around being a glass cannon that excels in 1v1 situations at the cost of high stamina usage in the process. Because of the way this class was designed, it is usually not fun to fight against. However, the association between anti-fun and overpowered is a dangerous misconception to have if you don’t understand the current competitive meta of the game. The Mercs balance council balances the game based upon TO situations more than anything else. We all came to the conclusion that while dodge out of parry is an unfortunate solution to balancing the class, without it, MAA in TO would be a useless choice over another vanguard. Better strafing and sprinting speeds aren't enough to counter balance how squishy the class is, and how easy it is to beat with feints.   Additionally, defeating a MAA is achieved by one of two ways: Either stam them out by baiting dodges and forcing them to parry multiple people, or by staying in range with constant pressure and predictive strikes based upon where the MAA will likely dodge to. A face-hugging knight with a norse or broad will be able to punish any direction a MAA dodges to after they parry. A vanguard with a halberd/sword can punish any direction a MAA dodges to if the vanguard properly maintains their range and pressure (It’s not hard to do when the weapon is as long as the halberd).  People need to stop fighting MAA as if they were fighting another knight or vanguard. It’s a different class that requires different tactics to beat. If you feint the MAA to bait his dodge out of parry, don’t follow up with a punish right away – and instead delay it, track the MAA, and follow up when he’s in recovery after the dodge."
ChivalryGame,34cdf2,Captain_Keyes,0,Thu Apr 30 23:46:11 2015 UTC,"I feel the role of a MAA is a melee support class that helps team knights/vanguards win engagements via several quick and high damage attacks spread out among several opponents to flinch and damage them, has an oil pot w/ammo crates on most maps and maybe knives because you get 4 of them sometimes heater for archer hunting, and flanks to get the objective when you're team is handling a split push properly or your 5 is handling their 6.   If there is a simple way to modify the run speed of MAA I'd like to be able to test a few ideas. Namely:   Burst sprint that drains stam at 20 stam/sec Dodge @ n% stamina other than 20"

ChivalryGame,34cdf2,Killua-,0,Thu Apr 30 04:09:13 2015 UTC,"A lot of people in here seem to think that dodging out of parries is the only useful dodge but there are plenty of other ways you can utilize dodge. You can use dodge to get out of a 2v1 sandwich, disengage from a fight, manipulate distance in your favor, and to make the opponent miss.  I think that the footspeed and dodge(excluding dodge out of parry) is enough for the maa. I'm not a stellar player or anything but I do just fine without dodging out of parries."

Its easy to develop bad chiv playing habits by playing on those low rank servers then when your finally made to switch to the regular servers you get stomped even though you have developed skills or habits that put you at the top of the scoreboard in the low ranks.  Id suggest playing on one of the 64 player west coast servers. The ranks are usually pretty viaried and 64 players can make for an exciting battlefield.

ChivalryGame,346314,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,0,Tue Apr 28 16:46:44 2015 UTC,Team objective boils down to repeated LTS interactions. It can be a fun break from auto picking dark forest every time. Same with playing hillside.
ChivalryGame,346314,sesstreets,4,Wed Apr 29 13:02:24 2015 UTC,If you mean competitive LTS well it used to be the standard competitive game a while back. But the scene switched to TO because LTS was rather dull in that it became all about fire pots and who had the better archer. Entire rounds would even end in a stand off of just the archers firing back and forth and people would even just sit on both sides just to tie rounds until the next one.

ChivalryGame,344jev,faktorfaktor,3,Tue Apr 28 09:50:04 2015 UTC,"Yes. Hittrading can be a tactic, but the best tactic is tricking your opponent into either not blocking or being unable to block. What it boils down to is hitting them before they know what's going on or tricking them into parrying and hitting them while they're recovering.  A couple examples of each: Fork lmb riposte or reverse overheads for most weapons are examples of hitting the opponent almost too fast to react to.  Dragging and feinting are examples of getting an opponent to parry too early and hitting them when they're recovering."

ChivalryGame,33zke8,Stealths,10,Mon Apr 27 02:42:01 2015 UTC,This is probably as result of you lifting your mouse off the pad ever so slightly and with high enough dpi or sensitivity your mouse laser covers a lot more distance as it swoops across your mouse pad and so it would be as if you moved your mouse across the pad insanely fast but really you kinda just tilted it off of the pad so the laser shot forward and skimmed across the pad. It's pretty common

I caught it once because I was watching a friend stream and I happened to do it in his view. People typically say that when i do 1080 that i just desynced. That's why you never see people do a swing with liek 1080 spin, it's because you desync during that."

ChivalryGame,33zke8,CoasterMan,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:12:49 2015 UTC,"while turning   You mean while turning with an attack right? Sometimes your attack gets desynced and for other people they won't see you swing, and since you're not swinging you can turn quickly. Normally there's a turn speed cap so you move the mouse a lot and turn a small amount, but if the cap is not there (because you're desynced) then you accidentally turn too much."
ChivalryGame,33zke8,bi11y10,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:08:17 2015 UTC,Actually it has happened while not attacking.

ChivalryGame,33xtj1,Tritanx,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:13:06 2015 UTC,"it's like an open chat room except voice, you can join and just listen or if you  have a mic you can use it. It's not a ""call"" per se, just a voice enabled chat room basically."

ChivalryGame,341j4p,JohnWitch,14,Mon Apr 27 16:00:55 2015 UTC,I'm confused as to why you think that people who put more time in shouldn't be able to consistently kill those who don't. I can't think of any games where that is the case.
ChivalryGame,341j4p,ia_Flame,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:04:56 2015 UTC,"I never said that. I just think the gap is much wider than in other games. I may be wrong because there's a lot I forgot in the meanwhile, but it seems to me that the game was full of weird things like players who bent over backwards and killed people like that, or dragged their swords around just chopping up n00bz. There's a bizarre dissonance between the reasonably realistic and awesome swordplay and the more gimmicky and in my opinion probably unintended techniques. But like I said, I'm very inexperienced so I might just be talking out of my ass.  Anyway, maybe it's because it's not a shooter, where there's always at least a small element of luck involved so casual players can still kill the occasional guy with 10000000000000 hours of playing."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Mon Apr 27 16:13:17 2015 UTC,"Casuals can still kill very gud players if you 2v1 and remember how to parry. Most players are too busy killing their teammates in the way to get a kill on the enemy than actually getting the kill. Play smart, and you win, even against the super spinning nerds. Though the gap will always be wide due to this game having a relatively high skill ceiling."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,ia_Flame,0,Mon Apr 27 16:22:04 2015 UTC,"That's true. I was good enough to avoid just spamming LMB and killing half my team, but not good enough to hold my own against most high-ranked players. I still don't like the drags and weird stuff like reverse overhands, but apart from that many high-ranked players just seem to have an insane, awesome sense of timing and ability to predict blows."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,blahblahwhateverblah,2,Mon Apr 27 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"All I can say is that this game has been out for over 2 years and so there will be a huge gap of experience regardless of technique. As for the  techniques that you don't like, I'm sorry to say they are still in the game, however, they shouldn't be hard to learn to counter if you put a little time in so that you may at least hold your own."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,CRUSHED1337,-1,Mon Apr 27 16:33:47 2015 UTC,"But can I hit high ranked players without resorting to those techniques? I don't mind taking the time to learn how to counter them, but I don't have an interest in learning how to use them."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,ia_Flame,10,Mon Apr 27 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"The beauty of the game is that there are so many ways to play the game. So many players have their own style, and a lot of the really good guys have their own unique characteristics; thus, there are different ways u can always counter good players.  My most commonly used technique against lvl50s is to usually position my body facing away from them, press hold W and the shift key. I just keep doing that without looking back."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Mon Apr 27 18:22:11 2015 UTC,best players dont use spins often (eu atleast) although dragging gets used
ChivalryGame,341j4p,PreparetobePlaned,2,Mon Apr 27 18:07:05 2015 UTC,Yes you can kill them if your defense and footwork are good enough. But usually in order to counter those things you have to learn how to use them and through that know the disadvantages of the techniques so when they're used against you then you will know what position to put yourself in to be able to counter it effectively.
ChivalryGame,341j4p,Chuckdatass,2,Mon Apr 27 16:44:34 2015 UTC,"I don't really do it, you just have to counter it. When they spin around like crazy, the are suspect to quick ripostes and feints. You have to use your footwork and range well to win."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,mobinstime,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you will be playing at a disadvantage if you don't use feints, drags, and ROH."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,St0uty,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:38:40 2015 UTC,Them be bads. I don't feint or drag much in pubs and still rekt. The only time I have to do something spicy is against an actually decent player. If you die to non spicy techniques then you have alot of practicing to do.
ChivalryGame,341j4p,crazylimeassault,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:41:44 2015 UTC,"It all depends which weapon you use. Weapons like sword of war, spear, and norse sword will do fine without dragging if you use feints instead. Weapons like zweihander, messer, and maul will probably need drags to do well with though. Also depends which torso movements you count as being exploits lol. People don't delay fast weapons as much, but they still do look down overheads."

It just seems to me that the developers are a bit lazy, and I hate dragging/reverse overhands/stuff like that. I don't even mind feints (although I don't use them personally)."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,bltrocker,2,Tue Apr 28 09:59:56 2015 UTC,"the skill gap is still there, but it's definitely better for casual... as this game is super casual."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,Clayton-BigsB,-2,Tue Apr 28 10:27:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, I see how the final state of the game is a bit easier for casuals to get into with all the hit trading, but it's still nowhere near casual. It still means something when playing, especially in close or meaningful fights during TO. You would really say it fits in with a game like Mario Kart? Are hit trades really as bad as being blown up by a blue shell as far as a casual experience, especially when you can adjust your playstyle to minimize their impact?"
ChivalryGame,341j4p,bltrocker,3,Mon Apr 27 16:10:54 2015 UTC,"yeah, blue shell = crossbow, javs, bow.  i can't adjust my playstyle to minimize their impact, it's too great.  Even melee man, the game is obviously better for casual when you can LMB around getting kills on even good players in numbers just by constantly swinging."

DONT TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE.  no-flinch doesn't really help right now unless they actually don't flinch. I'd say about 75% of the time they either still flinch (just as you still get flinched in release by melee weapons) or they aimpunch which is a worse version of flinching essentially.  I also have the disadvantage of specific archers targeting me all the time. Being on a chivalry stream, people tend to go after you I feel for a reason or two. Either they want to see themselves killing me, or they just enjoy pissing me off and seeing my shitty reaction. I probably get shot more often than anyone else in the entire game bro."
ChivalryGame,341j4p,mobinstime,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:59:48 2015 UTC,I feel you on the aimpunch. Nothing worse than having an archer dead to rights and seeing your weapon animate through them as they whip out their dagger to finish you off.
ChivalryGame,341j4p,LordKefkaPalazzo,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"The weapons are more balanced. Experienced players still usually win and people still drag.

What's important to remember is that you must control the pacing of the battle. Fight on your terms. They only have to hit you once, but they should never get the chance.  I don't follow any of this advice. This is just what people told me when I asked how to git güd as a MAA. I do recommend getting good at judging how much health your opponent has left and carrying a knife to finish them off. If anything, it's entertaining.

ChivalryGame,33sw3e,Anthonian,3,Sat Apr 25 14:27:22 2015 UTC,spear or halberd vg shits on maa
ChivalryGame,33sw3e,Stael,2,Sat Apr 25 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"MAA is fast which means you can sidestep a lot of pubbing rank 40's and 50's by just pressing A or D without even having to matrix. Use the speed to your advantage, not attacking? backpedal. Didn't read a feint? dodge. Have a hard time reading a persons ripostes? dodge. Missed an attack and forgot to combo so you could parry the next incoming attack? dodge to bypass recovery. Did you get hit? dodge to bypass flinch. Getting low on stamina? backpedal.  Seems like MAA's strength is to deplete the enemies stamina bar because they have to CftP all the time, two well timed dodges can give you a major advantage in any 1v1 situation. But the new caveman meta is scary and you might fall victim for a hit trade, which can be devastating considering knight primaries 1-2 hit MAA's."
ChivalryGame,33sw3e,Xylvion,2,Mon Apr 27 09:47:31 2015 UTC,"MAA is weaker in team fights.  Dodge is not as valuable when you have multiple enemies running around.  Enemies will key on you because they know they can 1 or 2 shot you and they worry about you sneaking up on them.  In a duel you can control all the variables and so MAA is quite strong.  In team fights, a lot of random bullshit out of your control happens and thus armor is more valuable than mobility.  So what can you do?  #1, revise your expectations.  Don't play MAA in TO or TD with the expectation of being MVP.  #2, play your role.  Use your speed to get to objectives.  Run the long way around and flank the enemy team to aid your comrades.  Use firepots to block terrain or direct enemies a certain way.  Get to the enemy archers and slaughter them from their petty perches.  When you do fight, maintain situational awareness.  Sure, sometimes you can take on multiple enemies and dodge like a madman, but people aren't noobs anymore at this game and that stuff rarely works these days.  Stay on the edge, pick your spots to dive in and poke someone who is distracted.  Find stragglers and slice em up."

ChivalryGame,33sw3e,mokdemos,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:48:51 2015 UTC,"Everyone telling you to dodge often is going to make you dependent on your dodge key. Unbind it. I unbound my dodge for a few months and learned to fight without it. All you need is footwork, timing, and to not let yourself get psyched out. Once you can win duels against knights and vanguards without dodge, rebind it and add it in sparingly for when you really need it."
ChivalryGame,33sw3e,JordanLorenz,0,Wed Apr 29 18:48:14 2015 UTC,"I main maa and I have a few tips. First off, rebind dodge to spacebar, jump to c, and warcry to v. This will seem a little weird at first but its an amazing setup when you get used to it. Now for fighting. You are faster than other classes sp you can often simply backpedal swings and run in to attack. This is the simplest way to score hits. If a vg/knight goes ballerina mode don't freak out, it all just smoke and mirrors to trick you. Wait for a good opportunity to get in and interrupt the combo, or run in and get an unexpected parry. When you get a parry, don't just riposte over and over, its predictable and pointless, instead try withholding an attack and wait for a panic parry. You will be amazed how often this works. You can also throw in a body twitch, jump fakeout, or feint against better ppl to force the panic parry. If you can't seem to get panic parries, another good way to score hits as maa is to use your speed to get around blocks. Start a stab as you're running to the right of the opponents block and try to drag it around their flank. Same goes for overhead to the left. Even experienced player can fall for theses attacks if you are facehugging. As for defense, you shouldn't be overly aggressive as maa, pick your advances wisely, as many things can 1-2 shot you. Learn to not rely on dodge as it drains a lot of stamina, and wont work if you do it late. I only dodge if I'm feinted, panic parry, or do something to open myself to attack. Don't use dodge to attack, it might work the first few times but ppl will figure it out and combo into your dodge and you'll be donezo. It also doesn't make sense to use dodge spam strategy in TO cuz stamina. As for loadout, use norse, not broad. Despite what ppl may tell you norse is superior. It is faster, and the range/damage is negligible. I use a heater shield, but always fight without it equipped for riposte ability EXCEPT in these few instances: Archers are being dicks, you are engaged in a huge teamfight where kicks and duels aren't happening and swords are literally flying everywhere, or you need to body block an objective. As for team position in TO, your place is not in the middle of the fray. That's for knights/vgs with health and reach to create a battle area. You should stick to the sides or flank since you are faster and can throw in finishing blows or assists. Or you can flank archers or duel stragglers. MAA is a hard class to play, imo the hardest and a lot of ppl believe its op cuz dodge. Well these ppl are usually claymore/messer knights/vgs who cry when their ""mlg"" mega combos don't work against experienced maa who simply dodge or parry the predictable nonsense moves. Pay them no attention because they are retarded. IMPORTANT TIP I ALMOST FORGOT! If facing a shield user, simply do the following: Block first attack, sprint forward into enemy shield and HOLD f for heavy kick while running forward. This gives you a moving kick into the shield. If they stagger, overhead combo once into face, then run around while still comboimg to the back. This can kill a maa or archer shield user in 3 seconds. Good luck, watch some YouTube vids, and piss everyone off with your "" supar OP dodge abiluhtees""."

If a player strikes another player's parry box during release, both players have their attacks deflected. This doesn't apply during windup, as you can see in the video. Parries and ripostes operate normally.   The next stage will be to replace the clashing parry box with a parry box attached to the player's weapon, resulting in true weapon-to-weapon clashing. Regular parries will still use the current parry box.  The final stage will completely replace the parry box. Parries will have new custom animations, where the actual weapon will be used to parry attacks."

Also sorry for not making you seek to exactly when the strike happens, forcing you to rewind and re buffer. The point is,  he did attempt a spinning strike. That was actually the second one he attempted that round.  Point is, they actually do ""spin around wildly.""   Honestly, I'm just sick and tired of the bitching about drags like that. With very few exceptions, the only people who bitch about them are those who cant figure out how to do them. They dont even strike in a way that's harder to block. Don't panic, press the right mouse button, and you will block them. Fuck."

I'm talking about matrixing and reverse overheads.   And spinning moves are fine if you want to throw them once in a while- in real life or in chivalry.  That's not wild spinning, or matrixing. You know damn well what I'm talking about but you're taking time to attack me because you likely prefer that play style. And you know what? I'm getting tired of people advocating that shit!!! I never said it wasn't easy to defend against. I just hate it because it looks dumb as fuck.

ChivalryGame,33r45q,ExplosiveLiquid,2,Fri Apr 24 23:13:11 2015 UTC,"I think the retarded looking combat goes well with the over the top voice acting, the fact that ""filthy peasants"" just run around randomly with their hands over their heads while you slaughter them, the ridiculous looking skins, and everything like that. Chivalry is not some super serious realistic immersion game even if you take away torso movements. It's a funny game to mess around with that also has a high skill ceiling (although that part actually would decrease without all the weird looking torso movements).  Also just to be clear, I'm defending matrixing and using torso movements to dodge attacks more than reverse overheads, because reverses aren't hard to do and I have no idea whether they add to the skill ceiling, but dodging attacks takes a lot of skill."

ChivalryGame,33lacb,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,0,Thu Apr 23 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"You can dodge it easily unless you are face hug, not to mention you can side dodge as well, on top of it being one of the slowest weapons in the game.

ChivalryGame,33lacb,slapyourownbutt,5,Thu Apr 23 17:31:06 2015 UTC,"I just hate the halberd because it has terrible animations. I'd much rather get feinted by a billhook or a spear than a halberd. It gives you time to react but it's hard to distinguish when the person has feinted it and when the person is doing a real attack. A weapon like a spear has a big animation letting you know that they feinted it. I always duel as a knight and I don't dodge out of parries, but I really hate the halberd."

ChivalryGame,33lacb,ia_Flame,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"I am obviously biased to be pro halberd but from what I can tell you in my experience being a halberd player is that, especially in mercs, if you see a halberd feint and immediately attack after you will probably be able to hit me before I can ftp or land a strike on you. Sometimes, actually a lot of times, you can double parry. So if you get feinted just immediately parry after because the only thing we can do is attack right away or else get interrupted/parried. Halberd has long recovery times and if you waste stamina with it you're boned."

MAA are not in any way underpowered or not viable. They play a large role in teams and can easily turn the tide because they are so good at countering everything. I seriously cannot believe that making more weapons less viable against them is a good idea simply for the fact that without those counter weapons certain classes go unchecked and turn into overpowered game changers. No one should be fully immune to everything. There should b a dynamic between classes. If this were a single class system where all the characters had the same attributes then yes you may have an argument but that isn't the case."

ChivalryGame,33lacb,Peasant420,0,Fri Apr 24 18:37:44 2015 UTC,"Nah I take a stance like that when I have known a lot of these players for a long time and know their agendas.   Nah, you take a stance where you assume to know a lot more than you do. Even if you do understand somebody's agenda, like in this circumstance, you should still respect an equally skilled player rather than making petty insults and taking cheap shots... but oh wait!   If someone's idea of balance is to remove a weapon from the game I'm not going to reply back with respect because they've already lost it.   What exactly is the value of your respect? Do you think people are going to take your opinions seriously when communicate the way you do?  Beyond your complete lack of tact, the agenda that you promote isn't exactly an exemplary demonstration of good balancing habits. You won't even consider removing a single weapon from the game!? Ha! The hell is the point of having you on the balance council if the best suggestion you can come up with has absolutely 0 original thought to it?   Honestly, just remove the handle hits from it.   Wow, groundbreaking concept. You won't even throw your full support behind it or flesh it out, and go so far as to acknowledge the flaws in your proposed suggestion. More:   The ghost swings are really annoying, but I have learned to deal with them over time and to me the knockback and stamina drain are so much more important for when the average lookdown spin master crosses my path. Gives me an outlet to use footwork more rather than praying I flinch him in a combo instead of getting interrupted by a reverse and then one shot at that point. Or similarly, for when Mr.Maul comes around and expects to be able to kill me by constantly overheading me until my stamina is gone.   So what, because you're used to a single buggy weapon, everybody should be used to it? Come on man, your argument stems from the same bias that Loin's argument does, a playstyle bias.  Before someone asks, here is a better idea for halberd balance, if possible in the game engine.  1) Remove handle hits for only overhead swings. Hits phasing though seem  to be more common on alt slash and regular slashes than overheads. 2) Nerf overhead and stab feints. The range on halberd alone is good, it doesn't need godly feints as well, similar to the way it doesn't need insta hitting OH reverses or lookdowns.  The worst part about halberd is that its animations make it wildly unpredictable to fight against. If you can't change a weapon's animations, change it's ability to feint. You can at least influence the Halberd weapon to be more predictable this way, and hopefully return some of the burden of skill to the player's shoulders."
ChivalryGame,33lacb,ia_Flame,2,Sat Apr 25 01:42:03 2015 UTC,"My respect is whatever someone else values it to be. I treat people nicely if they are nice.  As for not considering removing a weapon from the game, that's a basic rule in the council. To keep torn banners actual content in the game. Do not call me out or call me unoriginal or feeble minded simply because I am adhering to the council's set limitations and standards.  As for my comment saying that I was used to it, that means I am used to dealing with the swings when executing them. This means that I have learned to compensate for the halberd's phase throughs when I use it. I made that comment to show other readers that I, as a halberd player, would not mind handle hits being removed again because I can work around it. It was myself showing willingness to compromise in a reasonable way. I think you misunderstood what I said to be that everyone else should learn to read the swing animations which isn't what I was implying. I merely said that I believe knockback and stamina drain to be more important to myself over the handle hits and that if either were to go, I would choose the handle hits.  You are correct on the analysis of the handle hit phase through being prominent on the lmb attacks and less on the overhead.  I do not agree with your feint nerfs as the halberd windup times are the second slowest in the game and even if you fall for a feint with it you can usually double parry it. Nerfing it would make feinting almost impossible or at least not worth the cost in stamina.  And although you inserted your tiny comment at the end about putting some skill back into the player which makes me assume that you are calling myself and other halberd players rather skilless, I would have you know I rarely feint and still do well. I don't use these ""godly feints"" to give myself ""unpredictable animations"" and like I said I can still do well.   If you're going to call me out and then put a small insult geared towards me at the end of your post perhaps you should take some of your own advice and have a little more tact.  Aside from that, thanks for the suggestions as they are always appreciated. But as always, you must consider multiple sides of the argument of which I have noted yours and I will address it to my fellow council members."
ChivalryGame,33lacb,Peasant420,1 point,Sat Apr 25 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not insulting you as a player, just trying to point out where you seem to be blinded by your own bias. How can you claim to treat people nicely when the very first thing you said to Loin was:   If you play maa I can see why you want it gone because it's one of the only weapons you can't dodge out of parry from. Must be hard to deal with when you're used to never hitting rmb.   -.-   If you're going to call me out and then put a small insult geared towards me at the end of your post perhaps you should take some of your own advice and have a little more tact.   I am so sorry if you twisted my meaning to be a personal insult to you, it must have felt shitty. I agree, it is a very unproductive way to argue with someone.  I think halberd is in general less skillful weapon. It is objectively very good, hence your own thread where you suggest nerfing it.  As far as a balance council explicitly stating that nothing should be removed, well, I can't help but disagree with that policy. There is no perfect balance solution, and I'm not saying that removing certain weapons will save the game, but it should at least be open for consideration or testing.  EDIT: Formatting, added a second quote."

ChivalryGame,33luyz,Diconius,7,Thu Apr 23 16:03:56 2015 UTC,Most people do not have a fov above the slider.  The people that are groundsniffing are either playing in 3rd person or they are just comfortable enough with 1st person to play without always looking directly at their opponent.
ChivalryGame,33luyz,YourMoneyOrYourLife,10,Thu Apr 23 16:22:14 2015 UTC,"They aren't staring at the dirt, they are watching the ground for surprise attacks from ants and swing at them when they see them.

ChivalryGame,33luyz,ia_Flame,3,Thu Apr 23 17:27:38 2015 UTC,"It depends. When they attack you with overhead while looking at the ground it doesn't necessarily mean 3rd person - it's a way of accelerating attack to hit the enemy faster and probably every quarter-decent player uses this technique at least to some degree.  But if they're running bent over all the time, then yes, they're playing third person. No point in trying to sneak and hit them from behind, because they see you. You also have to be prepared to block even when they have their back turned on you, as they often start attacks facing away and then turn around to catch you oof guard."
ChivalryGame,33luyz,suitntiemotherfucker,3,Thu Apr 23 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"That's probably people playing in 3rd person. If done 'correctly' ground sniffing is effective because of how fast the attacks come. Best way to deal with it? Let them run out of stamina by keeping your distance and letting their attacks go nowhere while you wait for a moment to strike and get damage in.  Footwork is literally everything in this game. Being in control of where your character is in relation to the rest of the game (attacks, objectives, other players) and using it to your advantage is the single most powerful technique in this game."
ChivalryGame,33luyz,sesstreets,2,Thu Apr 23 16:20:39 2015 UTC,Ahhh gotcha. So is that frowned upon in the competitive scene then? Accelerated attacks only work with vertical hits while looking down or can you speed up horizontal slashes as well? I only play Archer as I feel 1 shotting multiple people with a giant 2h sword seems a bit mongoloid. Trying to work on my melee skills with the dagger/shortsword weapons.
ChivalryGame,33luyz,JarlBallin_,2,Thu Apr 23 17:33:15 2015 UTC,In the competitive scene you don't have people constantly looking at the ground because 3rd person is disabled.  That's primarily a pub thing.
ChivalryGame,33luyz,sesstreets,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:06:34 2015 UTC,"Frowned? No way. Doing correct lookdowns are important in competitive but its 1st person locked. You can accelerate all attacks, even stabs, by following the rule of ""making your weapon touch your opponent faster by positioning yourself either where the weapon goes into release is hitting your opponent or very soon after""  Shortsword 4 life. Its gud learn it."

Round time is what you are looking for, i know also for instance LTS you can set how many rounds to win and such, in TDM you can set the ticket count. Not all settings worked back when I had a server though, but those are the settings you would have to change.  Just look for AOC_Duel or something like that, it will have all the settings for that mode underneath which you can change.

There is a max time and you can edit the kills to win it looks like although I'm not sure why both values are 1. In other modes you'll have a more static number in there you can edit, the duel mode might be locked down in a way so ... idk. I know some server providers allow you to edit more with a config manager, but maybe someone else can let you know more.   It seems that for some game modes the settings are locked down a bit more, and even in others where you can see the edits, changing them doesn't affect the game."

ChivalryGame,33cogk,Tongfa,7,Tue Apr 21 13:30:23 2015 UTC,"In duels, you will always lose in riposte war, you will lose in trades and you will lose if you try to rush. The most important thing when playing spear is to always be in control of the fight and never get into a back-and-forth situation. In order to achieve this, you can do a few things:   Because of spear range, you will typically be able to hit a player twice before he makes it into range often. Making use of this will keep your enemy hesitant and make it more risky for him to get close. Don't be afraid to show your superior testicular fortitude by attacking while sidestepping attacks that would otherwise just hit you. When doing this, you will need to watch your enemy's animation closely to see if he will hit you or not and ftp instead. This will make your enemy devote more attention to actually hitting your character rather than edging his drags, making it easier for you to parry attacks you can't sidestep. If your enemy is moving his camera a lot while attacking, use accelerated slash ripostes. If he just did a reverse overhead or some really sketchy drag, he's typically not going to be able to parry it reliably. If he starts parrying your ripostes he's just gambling and you can act like you're going to riposte and get a free panic hit. This helps to counter spin2win. Spear stab ripostes can be really hard to read. As such, you will be able to land hidden ripostes as well as panics from these quite often. Spear is decent at dragging around parries, even at close range. Typically you can start a stab towards one side and then drag it over to the other. These can be fairly hard to read, forcing your enemy to divert more attention to defense and less on offense. Know your timings. Both your own and your enemy's. If you know your enemy is likely going to attack soon, use a slash or an overhead to try and flinch him quickly. The only way you will ever stam someone out is by making them ftp, but I find that I can typically manage my own stamina well enough in duels by combining footwork (causing the enemy to miss) and forcing ftps by messing up enemy timings.   You're going to be fairly even against most vanguard weapons except zweihander, which will shit on you. Against knights you're going to do fine if your enemy isn't playing sow or (to a lesser extent) messer, in which case you will also get shit on. Maul knights are non-existant. Against shield users you will either shit or get shit on, oddly enough I find there is no middle ground between the two. You will farm maas. Archers will shit on you because you're not playing knight.  Besides the class matchups you will struggle most against rushdown setups/playstyles, since your lack of combos makes you unable to maintain momentum besides slashing if you know your enemy is going to gamble a trade after taking a hit. Against control setups you will have a much easier time provided you don't get stammed, which will typically only happen if your enemy is only lmb riposting in no-feint duel and you lose the stam war, or you fuck up and forget to distance yourself in time.  I main spear competitively with 1500ish hours. If you're on eu or you want to ask me something I guess you can hit me up on http://steamcommunity.com/id/staelakagod"
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Stael,2,Tue Apr 21 17:37:02 2015 UTC,"Oh so I'm a spear user here. Level 35, but I can duel practically anyone and pose at least a small threat and sometimes beat high levels too  Feints are awesome. I don't use them, but they are effective, so you're shooting yourself in the foot.  So one thing I'll tell you now is that every attack with spear is useful. Spear is unique compared to all other weapons in that it has every kind of attack speed. The long stab has a very slow windup, the overhand stab has a meduim windup and the lmb is very fast. You need to mix them all in. Yes, it's true that the long stab is the strongest, but you don't necessarily need to use the strongest to kill. For instance: With the fork, if you give a vanguard two long chest stabs and then one lmb, they die. Or a knight, three chest stabs and an lmb is death. With brandi on vanguard, one long stab and an lmb is death. You can mix and match swings.  The spear riposte is something everyone hates. If you riposte with lmb and then quickly look to your right, it is very hard to see, and with fork it is near instant. mix these in. Same with overhead stabs, riposting with them is very quick for fork and spear. Then, mix it up where you don't always riposte. Many people freak out and are expecting some ridiculous fast attack and panic parry, that's when you strike.  Long stab is good for hitting them when they make mistakes, weakening stamina and controlling ground. There's some tactics here. With overly defensive players, stay just enough in reach for you to keepm jabbing them with spear, but far enough away that they can't riposte without missing and exposing themselves. With a defensive player, they will likely try to stay out of a fight for a bit, and you can take advantage of this to weaken their stamina. Most mid level maul players for instance typically play very defensively and are not good playing against spear.  For more balanced(between aggressive and defensive) players, the long spear is good for goading them into making mistakes. Instead of keeping them at the tip of your weapon range, stay just past the tip of their weapon range. A balanced player is more likely to try and swing at you from the edge of their range. Take advantage of this, and move back just when they try to swing at you. Block if you're scared of a hit, but if you think you can make it, don't parry. Instead, longstab them during their recovery. Many players aren't good with cftp, so usually you'll land a hit, and at least you'll make them waste a good chunk of stamina. This tactic even works if their weapon is longer than yours, but it's much harder, so be careful.  Aggressive players are the hardest to fight IMO, but all you need to do is get comfortable with their facehugging and use your fast lmb and overstabs. It's harder for them to see them coming, so you'll likely land a few good hits. Just watch out because they riposte a lot and when they're next to you parrying is much harder.  There you have it. Pro spear user.   If you want weapon recommendations, brandi is best for multiplayer fights, and fork is spectacular for duels. Spear is a good balance between them. I use fork almost exclusively, as duelling is basically all I do  edit: Also, people's strategy changes mid battle usually, so change yours accordingly. Don't play for what will win. Play for what will beat their tactics."
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Raknarg,3,Tue Apr 21 15:39:48 2015 UTC,"this actually summarises how spear works very well, especially considering you're only rank 35. you've got the style down pretty well, so i guess you just need to practice and maybe try and get into sidestepping, since that works notoriously well with spear  you should consider ditching fork for spear, since fork is really only strong against vanguard in a gimmick way with the 2 htk, and gets shit on heavily by control knight, where spear plays pretty much the same but just in a more reliable way. if you go up against really good players, spear is typically going to be better since you will benefit less from the fork speed against better players"
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Stael,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:03:53 2015 UTC,"I'm rank 35 but I have thousands of duels under belt and I've played a lot of duelyard too :-P  There's a very good reason i suggested fork, because of the speed and it's nice slow stab. It 3 shots vanguards and 4 shots Knights with good hits. However I believe that is simply the tradeoff for less damage. It's very good at making playing make mistakes, so the fact that it is weak is offset by how many shots you are able to land.   Furthermore, fork takes advantage of the speed difference between attacks. The swing is very very fast,  and the stab is nice and average. So in many cases not blocking right after a riposte may end for you getting lmb'd or mwu'd,  so even high level players panic parry sometimes. If they do,  free mwd. But I try not to rely on that exclusively.   If more people were comfortable with fighting fork,  I would agree with you. However as it stands it's the onoy weapon I've been able to use to compete with players at any level without having to resort to feints.   Thanks for your advice though.   edit: also not saying you're wrong, but I've played all weapons and this is the one I have success with personally"
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Raknarg,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:12:13 2015 UTC,"really spear is just outright better than fork, and if you picked it up you'd probably do better with it after getting used to it. spear has a lot more depth to it once you get comfortable with it, especially if you start practising footwork. winning a duel without parrying is just so fucking satisfying  overall i find spear to be a much more interesting weapon to play, and well there's a reason why no one in comp ever plays fork"
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Stael,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"I've played all the spears. I used to main regular spear. I didn't pick up the fork until a few months ago.   I'm personally of the opinion that fork doesn't exist in comp mode because no one's used it long enough, and it appears as a very shit weapon until you get used to it. I know the first time playing this game and having fun testing stuff out I found fork to be pretty useless. However once I got enough skill,  I found its uses. I like all the spears, I just like fork the most.  I don't think spear is outright better than fork,  simply because the speed difference is large. If that wasn't an advantage, no one would use SoW.  So far you haven't really said anything about why fork is bad in comparison."
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Raknarg,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:39:39 2015 UTC,"People use SoW because it has insane control. The reason for this is its speed in combination with its htk and drag cap. The htk on SoW allows it to 2 htk vanguard while being able to trade. Fork can't trade even against other vanguards. The drag cap makes it hard to footwork SoW, where fork is very easy to footwork. You also lose a lot of range when you play fork over spear.  m8 i have 1550 hours and have played competitively since 2013, fork is just not as good. It's like how some people will call Claymore op when really it's just good at farming bad players that can't handle the speed and panic themselves to death. In reality, Claymore is a 3rd or 4th tier weapon which is outclassed in almost every way by Greatsword and Zweihander. Similarly, fork is outclassed by Spear and Brandistock."

ChivalryGame,33cogk,Charles_K,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:43:01 2015 UTC,"Spear is pretty bad for dueling without feints. Even the slow thrust feint is rather readable until you're in facehug, but you risk getting flinched or gambled and losing at that point. The quick stab feints are much harder to read, but they have a shorter range so they still won't fall for them far away.  The LMB feints are basically unreadable on the live version of the game, but LMBs do very little damage so people don't mind gambling those and going for the hit because 1.) you feint, they attack blindly, you are forced to feint-to-parry or get hit by the attack or 2.) you didn't feint and actually LMB'd, you hit them, they take like 20 damage lol and may or may not get flinched if they were swinging depending on how early you attacked (if they don't get flinched, you trade unfavorably because 20 damage is pathetic). Because spear can't combo, you basically lose initiative or are on even footing again after the LMB lands... depending on when the LMB hit, of course.  Sometimes, you will have a tiny initiative advantage if you hit the LMB late. Sometimes, they will be able to start a windup before you can if you hit really early on the spear LMB.  Let's say they fall for your LMB feint. Don't follow it up with LMB, the punishment damage is pathetic. Use the slow thrust for maximum damage and punishment while backpedalling to create distance at the same time (also crouch right before weapon release, so that your character doesn't do that involuntary step forward). If they fall for feint but panicked early and you fear that they will be able to double-parry you by the time your slow thrust reaches them, just go for the quick stab headshot instead.  If you ever get really good and start scrimming and facing top players and stuff, you'll find that a lot of people will start reading your thrust feints on 1v1 scenarios. Thrust and quick stab feints are very effective in team fights where it's much more chaotic. Actually, one of the best things about the spear is its mere presence due to the range. Just keep feinting for your teammates to open up the enemy to receive a Maul to the face. Spear is a great teamwork and defensive weapon. However, it's a bit slow to kill when you're on the offense/need to kill fast for clutch situations due to the low damage output and lack of combos.  Stael posted some good tips for duels. Overall, spear is a very straightforward weapon and honestly one of the simpler ones. It really just tests your fundamentals rather than exploiting bullshit speed or reverses or anything like that. Very honest weapon except for the LMB speed in live, you will need to learn a power weapon as Vanguard though to switch off to for certain objectives or compositions. Spear is an excellent dueling weapon when you don't run out of stamina (i.e. your opponent fell for enough feints to die before you run out of juice), lol."
ChivalryGame,33cogk,aStarving0rphan,1 point,Fri Apr 24 09:25:38 2015 UTC,"Use the feints mate, they're really strong with spear/brandi.    I main claymore and brandistock, so most of the brandi strats are applicable to spears.   Jump look down stab works pretty well. intentional miss with the beginning of a thrust and drag the end into them Feint lmb and then alt lmb.  Hits them in the back of the head most of the time Target switch with your dragability Use your range to stay out of theirs if you are face hugging, a stab will hit directly at the end of the wind up cause the hit box is so big"
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Clayton-BigsB,3,Tue Apr 21 14:39:06 2015 UTC,"only things here is   1.) why would you alt lmb if you feinted successfully with lmb? wouldn't you want to use your strongest attack when you have a free hit? At the very least i would do an overhead and aim for face.  2.) there is no target switching in duels lul.  otherwise yeah, that's pretty much spear strats. I guess it would also depend whether you're in vanilla or mercs duels, in mercs you could probably just flinch the hell out of people with lmb and overheads. Plus use dem kicks whenever they decide to function."
ChivalryGame,33cogk,aStarving0rphan,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:23:28 2015 UTC,"For 1, the strongest attack with the brandi takes forever and a day to wind up, giving most people enough time to parry the next attack.  I mostly use that to finish people off since a stab plus that kills all but knights."
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Clayton-BigsB,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:33:59 2015 UTC,"i guess it depends on whether you use the spear or brandi, i was going off of OP thinking he was using the spear and not the brandi.

ChivalryGame,33cogk,Raknarg,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:55:12 2015 UTC,Its actually a useful tool if you can count hits. Two fork stabs and an lmb kills vanguard. Three chest stabs and lmb kills knight.
ChivalryGame,33cogk,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:17:13 2015 UTC,"Use the short stab, same speed as spear but two shots vans to chest. It's OP."
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Ad_For_Nike,-1,Tue Apr 21 16:00:12 2015 UTC,"I main the spear, I can easily go 50-10 on a large TO server with a spear.  Anyway, for duels some advanced spear tactics I use;   Spin to the right and throw out a alt slash halfway through your 360 spin, hits behind you and catches a lot of people out, basically a spear backswing. Your bread and butter is the overhead, learn to love it. Slash is for interrupting people and creating space after a blocked overhead, dont rely on it for damage. You need to be bending your body almost at all time on the defensive, the key to a great spear is a great defence. The stab has uses in feinting people out, a quick flick upwards and back down again looks similar to the stab and will make a lot of people panic block if you establish first what a normal stab looks like, then throw out that body feint it'l get a panic block 70% of the time.   Other than that just know your spacing, spears shine in team fights but can be decent in duels as well, just make sure you use feints, footwork and spacing to come out on top, you have the longest weapon in the game so abuse it."
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Stael,0,Tue Apr 21 15:36:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but this isn't really that great advice. For instance, your b0ckswing is never going to land reliably against decent players, and if you get parried it's an almost guaranteed hit for your enemy unless he's garbage.  Stab > overhead in most situations. Overhead can only be fast and isn't very draggable, where the stab is much more versatile. The HTKs are the same in almost every situation, so overhead doesn't really give you much.  I suppose using footwork makes sense, but typically if you start bending a lot to avoid an attack you're screaming 'ftp me please' at whatever you're trying to hit.  This advice only goes for rank 30-40ish at best"
ChivalryGame,33cogk,Ad_For_Nike,-1,Tue Apr 21 17:51:34 2015 UTC,"I scrim with spears and manage to do pretty well. /o\  The stab has a awfull hitbox and reduced range over the overhead, I feel like it just feels harder to land than a overhead.   Generally though if im trying to melt someone quickly 1v1 il just feint slash > overhead (or maybe another slightly delayed slash depending on how they're moving)  spear isnt the best duelling weapon honestly, the brandi tends to work better in a 1v1 format IMO."

ChivalryGame,33b9dt,BioshockEndingD00D,2,Tue Apr 21 04:18:52 2015 UTC,"i always thought it was a good idea in dw, but the way they did the tracers and the part of the swings that do the most damage per weapon didn't make sense. For example the old longsword tracer in DW, dragging overheads actually allowed you to land the most damage hit. If implemented properly, it wouldn't be a bad chance, but then big zwei draggers would probably complain that they're no longer doing 50% damage to knights with their big dregz"
ChivalryGame,33b9dt,Clayton-BigsB,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:27:09 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you value in the game. If a certain 'truthiness' and immersive quality in the medieval combat (I'm not going to call it realism, because Chiv is not realistic) with all the sound, dudes charging in screaming, skulls crunching and all that stuff is what drew you into the game then watching limbo-dancer knights spinning around like whirling dervishes is pretty gamebreaking.   If you're purely after a competitive CQB game then the opposite will be true; any enforced restrictions on your ability to push the movement and directional control of your attacks and blocks as hard as you can will piss you off.   Of course those are two extremes... I'm somewhere between the two and, while I have no problem using the game engine to its fullest as it currently exists, I'd like a future Chiv with controlled/drag-able swings but without the most egregiously unrealistic stuff like the beybladers and the crazy 360spin-jump-420-Zwei shit (it's just too big and heavy to move like that, is all I'm saying)."
ChivalryGame,33b9dt,deviden,2,Wed Apr 22 11:37:35 2015 UTC,It would actually make more sense for strikes to do more damage at the end of the swing as that is when it would have the greatest acceleration in terms of realism. But this is a game where you can drag your swings which isn't really plausible in real life or makes a whole lot of sense since in real life your hesitation would just give your opponent more time to react and stop you plus your swing wouldn't do any damage if at all against an armored opponent side you are reducing the magnitude of the acceleration
ChivalryGame,33b9dt,ia_Flame,1 point,Tue Apr 21 04:06:14 2015 UTC,"You can TOTALLY drag in real life and in fact it's done the same way more or less.   Go get a broom, do a right to left horizontal slash and rotate your body first clockwise and then counterclockwise and see the difference. Crouching while doing an overhead slash makes your sword descend vertically which makes it hit faster and because I fenced for a few years I can say matter of fact that stab drags exist.  What we consider, we meaning people, fighting with swords in 2015 is hema style with a point system that rewards hits while maintaining initiative and not getting hit on the riposte. Say I hit you with an attack that slashes your chest from your top right shoulder to your left hip. If, while I was attacking you, you managed to hit me, neither of us get points, if you don't hit me back or I can manipulate my sword to deflect your attack and not have it touch me I get a point."
ChivalryGame,33b9dt,sesstreets,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:41:32 2015 UTC,You lose any power you would need when trying to pierce armor. This isn't just about touching your opponent. That's not what is effective. And crouching while swinging isn't realistically viable as that would prompt a parry and then result in a kick in the face or a blade shoved through your collar bone
ChivalryGame,33b9dt,ia_Flame,1 point,Fri Apr 24 21:37:33 2015 UTC,"Right but the system of initiative is whats important. A sword of war does just ""touch"" the opponent in release to do damage right?  Watch some hema bros go at it. Its very intense and people get hurt if they dont pad up. Hell fencing hurts if your lamay isnt on or you dont have your padding vest on."
ChivalryGame,33b9dt,sesstreets,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt it, but I was just referencing plate armor and what not where even if you did a half handed sword thrust with both of your hands straight into plate armor the most you would do is maybe an inch of penetration. So tapping wouldn't work well. Tapping in gaps in the armor followed through by a stronger force/stab I could see this be more applicable. I do agree, however, that initiative is very important as once you have it you control where and when your opponent reacts or does something which would give you the chance to pick a spot to attack and go for it"

ChivalryGame,339h22,NippleCannon,6,Wed Apr 22 15:43:16 2015 UTC,This is why competitive is on mercs mod to use first hit flinch mechanics so that messer and maul trading aren't rewarded and actual logical strikes are based on speed distance and positioning. This makes it less infuriating when kicks or de syncs happen because you aren't already pissed off at the guy who can just turn around whenever he wants to overhead you with a weapon that one or two shots you. In mercs kicks are also more rewarding because of first hit flinch so they are more worth the risk of the phase through because they will actually stop your opponent rather than you getting traded while kicking. Vanilla duels is kind of a joke at the moment because of the vanilla meta that has evolved to encourage mindless swinging with a select tier of weapons or simply to counter that via sow stab feints. In short I don't think you can do much if you're in vanilla but maybe try mercs mod

ChivalryGame,337ao9,Alice_Ex,6,Mon Apr 20 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"Well, about feinting in particular... You can read feints, but largely you have to predict them. Some people in the competitive community feel that ALL feints should be readable with enough practice, and that prediction shouldn't have a place in a skill based game- although prediction has skill involved. I know Fart Sniffer and I used to practice feint reading a lot (he's obsessed with it)- and he still does- and he's basically concluded (as did I) that some feints aren't readable in facehug range. With that being said, he feels that because of this, there is a detraction from what would otherwise be a very skill based mechanic. I have to somewhat agree. I concede that it's still a skill based mechanic, but it falls short of it's full potential as such."
ChivalryGame,337ao9,PostPostModernism,2,Thu Apr 23 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"With feints being in part predictive, that puts the test of skill more on the attacker than the defender - in the sense that it's on the attacker to vary his style and feinting enough to not be predicted all the time.

Props to him for coming up with creative strategies.  I think feints have too low risk vs reward: if you play cautiously there's very little risk because you can just back off or parry immediately if they aren't caught by the feint. But of course, if you really want to hit someone who's good you have to be aggressive at some point and if you commit to a feint-then-attack and somebody predicts it, you're getting stabbed in the face."

ChivalryGame,337ao9,Anstii,3,Tue Apr 21 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"I can tell you european community is basically a bunch of acquaintances and friends these days. Active players are a couple of hundreds and you'll know most of them after playing for a month or so.  The game is still fun and rewarding, but until Torn Banner's next project is out, a big part of the remaining community will be formed by high ranked players like me, who've playing more or less since release.   Torn Banner's technical mistakes and commercial tactics have caused some disappointment among the Chivalry veterans. Some of us are bitter about the state of the game (not me, I'm just apathic) and don't play 'fair' anymore, just troll and do casual stuff most of the time. Sometimes this involves farming low ranked players mechanically.  Depending on how sentient players are about the game and the hobby of gaming in general, feelings of disappointment range from mild boredom to opposition to the company, with results such as griefing, server hijacking and overall a noticeable experience impoverishment.  This does not really justify another players ruining your fun, but I hope it explains it to you, at least for some of the cases. Moreover, I've never seen Torn Banner enforce any specific policy or set up any strategy around the health and enjoyment of 'their' community.   TL;DR: the current state of the game is of high endogamy and varying feelings of bitterness about its quality, combined with the usual trolls inherent in the internet."

ChivalryGame,337ao9,arbyD,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:37:33 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your goals when playing the game. Feinting is great for 1v1. And that's about it. You can 1v1 any time, use feints, and recover your stamina and that feint wont affect you further.   That being said, I don't feint because I prepare and practice for, hopefully, a situation where I might use all my stamina without feinting. What does that mean?  It means that im hoping for an epic fight where I slay 5 foes in a row. It doesn't always happen, nor when it does do I do the slaying. I get rekt plenty. But all those times where I wipe the other team defending the objective, I wouldn't be able to continue combo-ing if I were out of stamina.   Basically, I choose not to feint as to reserve my stamina in case I need it. Do I always end up using it and reking the whole team? no. But im all that more excited when I do.   Also, if (hypothetically) we were to become rivals in a game, you feinting all the time and me not, wouldn't you honestly be the noobier player as I am trying to play with a self imposed handicap. Food for thought.  (bitches don't like it when I do feint tho)"
ChivalryGame,337ao9,YouShallKnow,0,Mon Apr 20 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"It's a combination of a few things.     Losing in face-to-face combat, especially when it's when 1v1, feels a lot worse than being shot in a typical shooter.  It feels a lot more personal. Since this game has been out for so long and people have played a LOT, a lot of players no longer fall for simple strikes and drags.  Instead, a lot of the advanced skills look like players are floating and spinning like the Tasmanian Devil with an occasional blade sticking out. There's a huge skill ceiling in this game and, if you lose, it's usually because you were outsmarted or outskilled.  That causes a lot of rage. The high skill ceiling means there's a big gap between skill levels.  A level 50 is basically untouchable if you don't have at least 40-60 hours into this game.  Even a level 35 is difficult. In simpler games, you can usually get at least a few kills in.  In this game, you can easily end with a k/d like 0.1 at the end of a match.  Inexperienced players end up raging while experienced players get cocky. The gameplay is evolving to be more similar to twitch shooters where being able to deal with crazy mouse sensitivities and point-and-click with incredible precision/accuracy trumps strategy. A lot of the advanced skills are arguably ridiculous (if anything, aesthetically) and a lot of the moderate skills like feinting and dragging depend on deceiving the enemy, which can be infuriating. This game's setting attracts a lot of autists and socially awkward people who love and romanticize the medieval time period and probably wish or fantasize they were knights/lords in the time period. The game's humor isn't for everyone and it depends a lot on randomness and over-the-top reactions.  It does tend to attract strange people.   Edit: Added bullet points for better formatting"

ChivalryGame,3364pt,statedtheobvious,8,Sun Apr 19 22:23:48 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling the more decorative ones weren't meant for combat, but display or even as a display of a families heritage.   The extremely elaborate samurai armor most people imagine, was never meant for combat, but were more of a dick measuring contest among different clans. When it came to combat, more practical armor was used, so I imagine the same goes for medieval armor."
ChivalryGame,3364pt,artuno,6,Sun Apr 19 23:19:32 2015 UTC,"Oh! Just wrote a long-ass essay on armor! The decorative ones WOULDN'T have been worn in battle. In fact, it would have been a really bad idea to wear it into battle. Fancy decorative armor was made from weaker metal, and all of the fancy goldwork would really impact the strength. They would have been worn in parades/other public appearances by people that had a lot of money and wanted to show it off. In fact, a lot of super decorative armor like that was made after firearms began to become a thing, and people stopped wearing a whole set of plate armor. Fun fact: a lot of the surviving decorative armor is tiny, simply because it was made for a kid with a lot of money, and only worn a handful of times before he outgrew it. Grown men would have put a lot more wear on their armor, so there's a lower chance that it would survive to today."

Someone recorded as being 64"" tall then doesn't directly translate to 64"" today; could be more like 66""-68"", depending on when and where the recording was made.

ChivalryGame,3364pt,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:22:36 2015 UTC,"Section 27. Image of article  Napoleon:       Napoleon has become a worldwide cultural icon who symbolises military genius and political power. Martin van Creveld described him as ""the most competent human being who ever lived"".  Since his death, many towns, streets, ships, and even cartoon characters have been named after him. He has been portrayed in hundreds of films and discussed in hundreds of thousands of books and articles.   During the Napoleonic Wars he was taken seriously by the British press as a dangerous tyrant, poised to invade. He was often referred to by the British as Boney. A nursery rhyme warned children that Bonaparte ravenously ate naughty people; the ""bogeyman"".  The British Tory press sometimes depicted Napoleon as much smaller than average height, and this image persists. Confusion about his height also results from the difference between the French pouce and British inch—2.71 cm and 2.54 cm, respectively; he was 1.68 metres (5 ft 6 in) tall, average height for the period.   In 1908 Alfred Adler, a psychologist, cited Napoleon to describe an inferiority complex in which short people adopt an over-aggressive behaviour to compensate for lack of height; this inspired the term Napoleon complex.  The stock character of Napoleon is a comically short ""petty tyrant"" and this has become a cliché in popular culture. He is often portrayed wearing a large bicorne hat with a hand-in-waistcoat gesture—a reference to the painting produced in 1812 by Jacques-Louis David.

Quite silly really
ChivalryGame,335bvn,PreparetobePlaned,-3,Sun Apr 19 19:35:21 2015 UTC,"Too bad you're wrong. Not only does it teach you that hit trading is good because mercs mod players RARELY experience it, but changing the tracers and speeds of every weapon even by tiny fractions does in fact change gameplay drastically.   Very often I'll see ""famous"" players like Gangsterofnerds come into a vanilla map and go 10-10 because he's not used to hit trading.  Practicing on mercs will in fact ruin your ability to play vanilla, but the nerds who practice on mercs are often better players, and will make you better at the game by virtue of playing with them."

When the right player mixes it up by embracing the contrast between the two extremes it can be devastating on me. I definitely back this.
ChivalryGame,32mweb,Palaceer,8,Wed Apr 15 14:12:32 2015 UTC,double axe quad feint ---> lookdown overhead ---> combo to reverse overhead
ChivalryGame,32mweb,DatsunZ,3,Wed Apr 15 07:35:56 2015 UTC,Best combo on a halberd is Alt-LMB to Stab. Very hard to see it coming even when the enemy can see your body clearly.

ChivalryGame,32mweb,Oskoff,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:50:15 2015 UTC,Setting a slow pace entering a fight with a drag then following up with a fast thrust is definitely tight. The animation(s) leading into the thrust seem more difficult to read if you begin with the alt swing too - also good.

ChivalryGame,32mweb,CoasterMan,3,Wed Apr 15 16:02:46 2015 UTC,I like to purposely miss alt over head attacks on the halberd and combo into a regular overhead and then drag the shit out of it. Crazy amount of delay to ensure even top players will parry early.

ChivalryGame,32mweb,bi11y10,2,Wed Apr 15 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"a generic riposte stab into delayed overhead with the halberd is deceptively slow and I like to use it, you almost don't even have to do anything fancy, as people are used to look downs (though most players probably aren't as scared of polearms now as they used to with the handle hits)"
ChivalryGame,32mweb,Reithur,1 point,Wed Apr 15 04:10:43 2015 UTC,Were polearms nerfed at close range or something? I'm not sure exactly what you mean in ( ).  I've always found it frustrating when facing someone with that much range and the ability to both drag so slow and force so fast. Lots of opportunity to throw your opponent's timing off and land unexpected hits - it's good!
ChivalryGame,32mweb,dievert,2,Wed Apr 15 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"Polearms used to be very quick at close range with the overhead attack. The reason is because the entire weapon used to have tracers, so you could hit your opponent with the butt end of the polearm as you overhead and look down. Eventually TBS made a patch that removed the tracers from the hilt area which caused the overhead takes a lot longer to connect. I believe the halberd was all around faster as well, so it was a very effective weapon."

ChivalryGame,32mweb,Charles_K,2,Thu Apr 16 14:10:34 2015 UTC,Recently got into the polehammer and the overhead into stab feint is really stupid with it.  Also overhead into reverse alt-overhead is hard to read because of the awkward angle of the alt swing.
ChivalryGame,32mweb,Killua-,2,Wed Apr 15 15:59:32 2015 UTC,Any one-handed weapon: Alt-LMB into Stab.  Hides the stab windup because it looks like the recovery for the Alt-LMB.  Add a little twist to your right to hide it a bit more.
ChivalryGame,32mweb,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Wed Apr 15 16:10:50 2015 UTC,I almost always use: drag oh > lmb > reverse oh or stab

Feel free to add me on steam. http://steamcommunity.com/id/Waiterboy/  Anyways, competitive isn't really a huge time commitment, but it depends on the clan you are in. Most active competitive players play at least every other day and then there's fat neckbeards who play all day like me. It depends on how much time you want to put in the game to get better and what clan you are in, honestly. There's a lot of more casual clans who really don't care if you get on often but none I have met require any time specific commitment, though you're highly encouraged to get on daily and scrim in the more competitive ones. Usually around your mid 40s dueling in the classic duel servers you'll about time to play competitive. It's the next step!"

Try hanging out on Classic Duelyard servers and talking to people with clan tags.

ChivalryGame,32iqxf,Arctomys,5,Tue Apr 14 02:54:54 2015 UTC,"Here is a link for initial sign ups..  This is just to get rough numbers, skill levels, and class distribution of those interested.  Once a date is decided upon we will have another sign up to confirm who will be able to play.  The rules and requirements are as follows * This is open to any player, not just exclusive to those in clans. * This will be played on Vanilla Chivalry.  There is another event like this being planned for clans that will be using Mercs Mod. * Have Teamspeak, you do not need a mic, but must be able to listen and get organized and receive instructions.  If there are more than 60 people that sign up those with mics will be given priority to play. * Trolling is an automatic ban from both the Chivalry server and the Teamspeak(s) we will be using.  Zero tolerance on trolling. * This isn't competitive, but that doesn't mean to act like an ass.  Don't t-bag, insult, or anything of the sort. * Be open to playing a class other than your primary. * Due to the large server we don't expect everyone to have <100 ping.  If you are playing please go in acknowledging that fact and be aware that you might see weird shit happening.  REMEMBER, THIS IS FOR FUN.  That said, we're hoping to have everyone at a somewhat reasonable ping.  So we will kindly ask people with excessive ping to get it fixed and if they can't ask them to leave.  Last resort will be to ban from the servers. * We will be using the 50% rule.  (This will eventually be ignored when we start doing more hilarious and fun strategies/scenarios) * Be open to playing new strategies and different scenarios.  I.e. 2 teams of shield walls with spears behind, 30 shield knight tower wall backed into a corner vs 30 MaA (with no firepots), 59 pebbles vs 1 maul (when archer gets killed switch to maul), and any more people can think of.  In regards to the squads I have a couple other ideas, some very similar to /u/Arctomys.  In my opinion we can go with the rough layout and teams can adapt as they see fit, or they can change drastically.    Team/Squad composition * 30 vs 30 * Either 6 or 5 man squads Either * 2 knight, 2 (or 1) van, 1 maa, 1 archer * All of one class per squad.  This will probably be less feasible as groups of one class running around together would leave parts of the maps open.  Communication * Squad leaders use Teamspeak's Commander feature to talk to other commanders and coordinate. * Squad leaders in 2 separate channels, their squads and the commanders channel.  This way commanders would always hear each other and be able to more quickly call out commands.  Downside is that they could be more easily distracted hearing ~10 people total. * Archers in 2 separate channels.  This way they are able to go with their squad but also talk to other archers to warn of other archers or focus fire in specific areas.  Again, these are all just ideas and can easily be used, ignored, changed, or anything that a team would want.  Also, if the first round of this goes well and people want to keep playing we can completely switch it up.  As in mixed class squads the first game, single class squads the second, single class teams, etc.  Please feel free to offer an ideas or something you'd like to do during this event.  I'll post again in a couple of days to make sure people see this and have a chance to sign up.  We'll be choosing the date by this Sunday 4/19, but please try to respond sooner so we can get this organized."

ChivalryGame,32k2ly,cbickle,3,Tue Apr 14 12:47:30 2015 UTC,I posted this in another thread.  I hope it helps.  The spinning attacks are attempts to put their weapon tracers in unexpected places as soon as the attack's release phase (damage-dealing phase) starts or to delay the attack long enough for your parry to expire.

ChivalryGame,32k2ly,MajorGrempington,3,Wed Apr 15 00:28:55 2015 UTC,"Come on, man. I was just kidding.  The way you worded it made it sound like you hit rank 16, joined a non low-rank server, saw the circus that awaited you, and noped the fuck out for a year. It happens a lot.  I was going to say something helpful but all of the usual relevant links were already posted. Though I can give you the 'Chiv Player's Standard Advice for Not Dying as Much':  Don't parry unless your opponent actually attacks. It sounds patronizing, but everyone fucks it up. Just because your opponent can riposte doesn't mean they will. You need to be patient and alert so you don't end up parrying a non-attack leaving yourself open to a real one.  You can use this offensively as well. You'll find that when you parry your opponent they'll often throw up a block anticipating your riposte. Don't riposte. Wait for their parry and hit them as it goes down. Some people won't panic as easily so you have to sell it with a feint or by doing a quick sprint toward them and wiggling your mouse.  Sorry if I sounded like a douche. In hindsight what I said was fairly douchey."

ChivalryGame,32ejy0,Arctomys,9,Mon Apr 13 03:35:33 2015 UTC,"Battlegrounds, Belmez, and Coldfront (no love) are the biggest three maps no doubt. Citadel also might work but, it and Coldfront have been known to give FPS problems to some players.  The best way to organize an event like this and assuming we use either 24 or 32 players a team, then squads of 5 or 6 would work best. It would work like this: assign a single captain or commander for each squad, and put each squad in a separate teamspeak channel. (Separating the players would mean less idle chatter and less noise, letting the players focus on the game) The commanders would be able to communicate with each other through commander chat. This way the commanders can coordinate their actions with the other commanders, such as focusing on a certain objective or using a certain strategy.  Let's say we did something like 2 or 3 clans vs 2 or 3 other clans. Put each teams in separate teamspeaks, maybe the TS of which ever clan hosts the event.  Additionally, it would be best to host the event on a server larger enough so that there are people who can sub in for a squad in case someone has to leave, which no doubt there will be. That way we won't have to pause for uneven teams. For example, we have a 48p event on a 64p server or something like that.  And for something like this to work, EVERYONE must agree to cooperate and not troll. If someone does troll, then an admin can simply kick them.  EDIT: Please post suggestions."
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,Keiji99,3,Mon Apr 13 04:19:44 2015 UTC,Glad to see you have some great ideas man! right now i'm contacting Simrai to see if there are servers available that can handle a load like that.  Edit: The best solution seems to be a 50p server (we could run 24p teams).
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,Chicken713,2,Mon Apr 13 04:44:01 2015 UTC,Kick and taken out of game with no replacement sub. Make the rules strong against the troll. no dq or nothing just down a guy. A big game it can mean a lot or a little.
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,Cageweek,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:21:45 2015 UTC,"Ehh, to chime in my opinion, I think making the battles organized with teamspeak and whatnot will make them too complicated for people to join. It'd be cool but I doubt it'll work.  Something I really want to see is just trying to organize events into large servers, where we just fill it up as much as possible. Maybe a 128 player server, those have been tried before. But then again who'd host that!"
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,Keiji99,2,Mon Apr 13 16:39:43 2015 UTC,"128p wouldn't be fun because of the lag. I played on the TBS 128p and the lag made it unplayable. It just wasn't fun.  As for people trying to join TS, you could just PM a clan leader that you want to have join the event and tell them the TS. They could simply PM the people attending the teamspeak and other info. It's not really that complicated."
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,Cageweek,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:33:54 2015 UTC,"As a user of TS, no, it's not complicated at all. But not everyone has it or understands how easy it is to use. It's about drawing people in but less are if they think they have to put an effort in, and we want a full server after all."
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,Keiji99,3,Mon Apr 13 19:12:30 2015 UTC,"It's either a clan-only PUG or a PUG where anyone can join. I can't think of a clan that plays competitively that doesn't use TS or something similar. It's also not like it requires a tremendous amount of effort to install teamspeak and copy+paste the address into ""connect"".   A non-teamspeak (or Mumble) PUG, would be horrendously unorganized. Also, a PUG is suppose to be like a casual scrimmage, where players don't have to try their hardest, but can at least try to win."
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,teripper,3,Mon Apr 13 19:48:48 2015 UTC,"As long as I don't lag like hell, this will make one heck of a stream/video. Sign me up!"
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,felix45,4,Mon Apr 13 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"If you want to do this you need to make a steam group for it! Sounds like fun to me.   Basically all you need is a mumble server. Once you have the 2 teams have each team go over strategy. Like others mentioned groups of 5 or 6 following a captain would be good, but that is up to each team to decide.  Anyway if someone makes a steam group I would be willing to do this on the weekend :)"
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,PolarisH18,3,Mon Apr 13 13:53:25 2015 UTC,I like that steam group idea
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,ExileTheWolf,3,Mon Apr 13 14:27:21 2015 UTC,The idea of a huge multi-clan team objective game has always appealed to me. I'd definitely be down to help organize something like this!

ChivalryGame,32ejy0,arhythm,3,Mon Apr 13 11:44:40 2015 UTC,I've been wanting to do this for a while and will definitely help you or anyone else organize this.

ChivalryGame,32ejy0,wonderdij,2,Tue Apr 14 04:01:25 2015 UTC,I would definitely be interested.
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Mon Apr 13 14:44:02 2015 UTC,"Hardest part about this is the organization of a large group while controlling everyone. Even a single LTS round would look fantastic in a 32v32 format for competive players, and reviatlaizing a 128 man server is still possible. We've already seen large scale tournaments, most notably the 10v10 and 15v15 tournament. One hosted by me and another by Height."
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,bi11y10,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yea the organization would be very difficult but I believe its possible. As far as communication I believe we could do it in a squad format, As of now it is an idea but I believe with the right amount of support it could be done."
ChivalryGame,32ejy0,Reithur,2,Mon Apr 13 03:40:44 2015 UTC,I was casting with Sarge at the time and I really like this idea. Contacting NFO or Simrai to get a server that can handle this would be the first step

ChivalryGame,32c1kb,HELPMEIMGONADIE,6,Sun Apr 12 17:09:45 2015 UTC,"Could add a little note to show how many those numbers actually mean. Ergo, you have killed 31922 people, 11922 more than died in the Battle of Teutoburg Forest.  Now that may be kind of dark, but I think you get what I mean. Probably stick to Medeival, ancient warfare of known battles or something. I think it would be interesting.   Edit : you can't really see much out of the graph. Maybe zoom in some more to show the slope being more meaningful"
ChivalryGame,32c1kb,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:14:09 2015 UTC,You are a genius! This is just the stuff that I wanted to hear. I can just keep adding and adding panels for more and more stats so anything like that is awesome.  I will remove the graph because it's not really that helpful anyway.
ChivalryGame,32c1kb,Reithur,2,Sun Apr 12 17:25:08 2015 UTC,"I must say the Ui is lovely. If you need any help with closing battle so wars or whatever you end up doing feel free to ask!   Even if this is simple, maybe somewhere to put in your hours and it gives you kills per hour, per minute, whatever."
ChivalryGame,32c1kb,NippleCannon,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:34:01 2015 UTC,The graph would be helpful if it was on a meaningful scale and large enough to see properly.    reduce the max rank displayed to player entry +10 or cap it at 70; 100 is to high use Log scale on the XP axis

ChivalryGame,32c1kb,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:22:15 2015 UTC,So I've had a look at doing this and coded a test page which gets the data out quite well... only thing is the data doesn't seem to be accurate. It states I've only had 3 longsword kills in my whole chivalry career. Does your UDKStats data look correct if you mind having a quick scan?

ChivalryGame,3294dx,Zachariahmandosa,2,Sat Apr 11 18:22:07 2015 UTC,"This looks fine, except I'd go for a smaller faster hard drive. If you're just hosting a server for games you don't need 3TB. Servers don't take 80GB like games do, you can run like 100 servers on a 120GB SSD which will provide much better performance.  5400RPM is just garbage anyway."
ChivalryGame,3294dx,electricspit,1 point,Sat Apr 11 18:55:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, I completely forgot to include the SSD in that build, oops.  The WD RED HDD is actually for my NAS, as I'm going to use this server for storage as well.   I don't plan on running a large amount of servers at all (definitely under 10), so what size SSD would you recommend?"
ChivalryGame,3294dx,electricspit,2,Sat Apr 11 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"Just 120GB, since you want the OS on there as well for quick access/restart times when needed. You might be able to pull off 64GB but I forget how big the OS is."
ChivalryGame,3294dx,sesstreets,2,Sat Apr 11 19:37:14 2015 UTC,"This is probably the wrong sub (and there is some misinformation in this thread) for this  (correct one is r/homelab) but server stuff is my career so lemme help.  First off you're going to have a bad time with this server built as is. That A10 is meant for gaming on a budget and you are running a server which doesn't need graphics at all more or less. I would suggest you find a ivy bridge or sandy bridge i5 processor or an 83xx something octo core AMD processor.  No reason for a cpu cooler. It'll get 'warm' but servers rarely need more than the stock (included with CPU) heatsink/fan.  What you want with the motherboard is just something that works, try to get a full atx board for the pci lanes when you want to inevitably expand.  8gb ram is enough for a chivalry server and 'nas' functionality. I don't know your $ situation but ram is an easy way to save money. You usually need less than you think.  The 850 evo should obviously be the OS drive plus servers drive. Getting a  red is fine but don't get 3tb drives. They are consistently more likely to fail than even storage sized drives (2, 4).  Case is whatever. If space is an issue then get what you need. If space isn't an issue get the NZXT 210.  Power Supply is fine.  No need for case fan.  PM me if you want more help."

Said archive probably includes a lot more than the community items in the game, and you need to redownload it in its entirety. This is for optimization purposes. Earlier, when for example you'd try to select your Knight player model, you'll be able to see ""Default Mason Knight"" for example. Then, you'll see some empty space, and only then would you able to see the dreadnaught and barabrian knights in the list. This patch makes it so that the empty space will disappear."

ChivalryGame,325cdn,zhuliks,2,Mon Apr 13 02:54:01 2015 UTC,Yeah it's pretty awful. It also doesn't do any damage when you die before you hit them.
ChivalryGame,325cdn,zhuliks,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:03:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah when you see that Vanguard Zweihander in the corner of your eye charging towards you ready to sprint attack, but you ignore them, staying focused on your original target which you know is more important than your impending death.  Your aim and timing is perfect, you don't mind being cut down because it's worth it for that really important kill...... then as you check the scoreboard it slowly dawns on you that the arrow was cancelled out inches away from landing.  I wish they'd remove that.  It's bad enough sometimes in melee (as if a maul overhead in it's final split seconds of hurtling downwards would be affected by the wielder losing consciousness), but is even worse for projectiles."
ChivalryGame,325cdn,BioshockEndingD00D,1 point,Fri Apr 10 18:59:10 2015 UTC,I'm not complaining about arrows disappearing after death and I actually like that implementation it prevents dumb trades and awkward situations that lots of people complain about happening in other games where latency will cause you to die far after you have killed the person and moved away. I'm complaining about shooting someone and dealing no damage far before death. The opponent just keeps running around. I am also talking about firing and switching to your weapon after causing the arrow to disappear
ChivalryGame,325cdn,POWER-99,2,Fri Apr 10 21:10:40 2015 UTC,"I more dislike the other feature. Often I see an arrow pass me and i think to myself: ""Whew, it almost got me"" then i make a step and die from a headshot."
ChivalryGame,325cdn,bltrocker,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:06:34 2015 UTC,What you're experiencing is a result of the arrow indeed hitting you but what you are looking at is the tracer visual that is set too high above the actual arrow so always expect the actual arrow to be flying lower than the visual flight tracer. The arrow itself is fine it's just the white shit behind it that's messed up.
ChivalryGame,325cdn,Manzanis,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:26:21 2015 UTC,Does tracer go 1 second if front of an actual arrow?
ChivalryGame,324vyc,CakeCranky,9,Fri Apr 10 16:32:36 2015 UTC,Only good in duels. Not that great in team fights because of its small reach.
ChivalryGame,324vyc,Keiji99,7,Fri Apr 10 16:42:11 2015 UTC,"Its reach is okay if you get used to knowing what you can and cant go for. Whats really the killer is the lack of handlehit and knockback from others being too great. You mostly miss with it because you cant riposte after being knocked back by vanguards, also cant catch vans or lower because of road-runner acceleration"

ChivalryGame,324vyc,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,0,Sat Apr 11 06:37:09 2015 UTC,They are for me. It all depends on the player. Team speak shield wall where you all stab like crazy into any MAA works amazingly well. War hammers will easily kill anything else. Of course shield walls are both hard as fuck to maintain and not that efficient in chivalry so when needed we all just put our shields on our backs and beyblade into the enemy lines with warhammers.

ChivalryGame,324vyc,Koiuki,0,Mon Apr 13 21:26:19 2015 UTC,Very constructive. Mind backing up your point? Because to me a 2 hit kill weapon that trades very easily like the warhammer is overpowered.
ChivalryGame,324vyc,Koiuki,3,Fri Apr 10 16:37:06 2015 UTC,"the feint isn't very hard to read if you keep your distance, anytime an annoying warhammer comes up to you just kick him away and use some form of range to your advantage, i'm not really sure what situation you find it op in but if it's anything that isn't one on one you can usually get teammates to back you up. It can't trade if you don't facehug. also feint to parry op  edit: you said it was in the context of duels, in duels you can try fancy tricks like z-stab and heavy kick to get around shield depending on what weapon you're using, honestly shields kind of hold most people back in duels, most people who are great with the shield wont use it in duels"
ChivalryGame,324vyc,mobinstime,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. However range seems overrated. If he comes at me, all I can do is, Kick, Heavy Kick, Trade then f2p. If your opponent has decent reactions, he won't fall for the heavy kick. Leaving Kick and trade to get him out of my face.  A lot of people use it in Duels. And they don't fall for the ole zigzag stabs around the shield or anything like that. At least the players I've fought against don't."

ChivalryGame,324vyc,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Fri Apr 10 16:50:46 2015 UTC,I see it in NA occasionally. I think people just don't use it in duels super often because it isn't as fun as something where you actually have to read feints and drags. When people do use it they can destroy most other knights easily. It's not as effective against van and maa but still probably one of the most powerful dueling setups imo.
ChivalryGame,324vyc,My_Hands_Are_Weird,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:54:30 2015 UTC,I actually played against warhammer no shield today in kendo before a scrim and noticed that its feints were fairly easy to read because I have never read a feint before and I read multiple perfectly from the person I was dueling against. Maybe it's harder to read with shield?
ChivalryGame,324vyc,My_Hands_Are_Weird,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:16:13 2015 UTC,I believe shields speed up the attacks to make up for not having reposts so that makes feints a bit harder to read. It's still one of the easier weapons to read but the fact that you can't feint them back or drag effectively if they have a shield and that it can kill a knight in two hits is what makes it so good.
ChivalryGame,324vyc,ia_Flame,1 point,Sat Apr 11 07:41:53 2015 UTC,"Oh I see. I just assumed everyone played in the EU in this subreddit for some reason. But as I said, being good with warhammer + shield really isn't that hard. That's the biggest problem I have with it."

ChivalryGame,324vyc,YourMoneyOrYourLife,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:40:31 2015 UTC,I think that abusing range limits on it is common so tons of footwork and feint reads.  It's hard to play offensively against because it's so easy to force a trade with a war hammer. Lots of kicks.
ChivalryGame,324vyc,Clayton-BigsB,3,Fri Apr 10 16:42:21 2015 UTC,Yeah. Problem is kick isn't a reliable enough mechanic to lean on atm. With it phasing through enemies. It just takes such a high skill cap to deal with such an easy setup that I believe it needs a nerf.

ChivalryGame,326zzi,ItsShiva,5,Sat Apr 11 10:46:40 2015 UTC,"FFA can get really tiring easily.  Id really recommend trying out TO as the combat can get just as fast paced, if not more, and the group fights are more structured and interesting imo since there are 2 teams and its not just every man for himself, or every group of dudes vs the rest of the players.  The main thing id suggest trying to change is play a bit more conservatively so you arent always dying and respawning and watch out for teammates.  Also, i find that there are more toxic players in FFA than other game modes."
ChivalryGame,326zzi,YourMoneyOrYourLife,2,Sat Apr 11 03:21:42 2015 UTC,Sometimes other players of rank 40+ try to team up with me in ffa. It's annoying because they're often the only player in the server I could be having good fights with but they just want to kill new players without any challenge. Feels like a dick move to keep attacking someone who refuses to fight back so I usually just get bored and leave. I could understand low rank players teaming up so they don't die so quickly but it seems like it's always the competitive or high level pub players who do it. I don't care that much cause I don't play ffa often anyway but it's just weird.

ChivalryGame,322ka5,crazylimeassault,4,Tue Apr 21 01:53:54 2015 UTC,"Team balance needs to be based on approximate rank.  Not that rank is equivalent to skill, but chances are the rank 50 is going to be more effective than the rank 14.   Right now auto balance may just stack a team even more than it is already.    I would also like server admin commands to allow a rank rebalance during a match, not just if teams are un-even.  So I would have the option of setting it to rebalance after each objective, or if a series of objectives are being completed very quickly one after another (sign of unbalanced match).   With all these mods going around, I wonder if a server admin mod is in order.  Things like commands to display team damage per player at any point in the match, or how much team damage has occurred against me should be possible.  Every 5 minutes you could have a server broadcast message showing the top 5 team damagers in terms of % of total damage."
ChivalryGame,322ka5,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:27:49 2015 UTC,"I highly disagree with many of your claims. I believe it will lead to a more toxic and unnecessary hateful/toxic community in public servers.  Rank still means literally nothing, people have abused it and still do despite that. Don't give them more reasons to do so. There's no need to kick a ridiculous amount of undeserving people from the server when their names ""pop up on the screen for tking"""
ChivalryGame,322ka5,crazylimeassault,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:25:25 2015 UTC,"Im not sure if you read my comment or someone elses.  These aren't claims, they are suggestions, and ideas.    I'm not advocating kicking people for being high rank or not, or discriminating against people because of their rank.  I am suggesting an auto balance method that could result in fairer teams.  I will make the following claim however.  People abuse new and less experienced players by stacking a single team with high ranks, or rather, more experienced players, whatever you prefer to call them.    It doesn't happen always, but often enough.  Which I think is frustrating for those looking for a good game, and those who are less experienced.    Concerning your second point, there is no other way of determining someones team damage other than votekicking them outright, which I think results in more votekicks than are necessary.  Is the guy that hit me 3 times in a row a troll? Or was it just a legitimate accident, I'm not going to bother votekicking if his TD is 5%, but I will if its 40%.  Right now the only way I can tell is by starting a votekick against a potentially legitimate player.  Maybe an MOTD broadcast isn't the best implementation of that feature, that wasnt the main thrust of my point, having the ability to determine someones team damage BEFORE a votekick is a good idea.  What might be a better idea would be to allow administrators to set a threshold, so that if someone rises above a certain team damage percentage, in a given amount of time, then an auto kick or auto votekick would be initiated.  Similar to the ping threshold kicking that's been implimented on some servers.  Right now, with the votekick restrictions, its almost impossible to clear a server of AFKs, Troll team damagers, and people with 200+ ping.  Some type of threshold system is needed if official servers are going to limit player's ability to clean up the servers themselves."
ChivalryGame,322ka5,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:05:45 2015 UTC,"You can actually see the player tk percent in the player list. Same with ping and other info.   If a few friends want to play together and can't due to what will soon be bitched at to no end for the awful auto balance. This is hurting  your 'hardcore' player base and unfairly splits teams for no reason. It will encourage more people to use alt accounts as the player base grows smaller. I see no reason to split teams on random lines. Hell this could makes things worse as they currently are. If a high level team comes into stack, yes it shitty and I don't have another offer to make to amend it. For 'cleaning up'  official servers you can always ask an official admin to join as well.   The ping kicking threshold is hilariously broken and dysfunctional.   edit : what game splits it's multiplayer player base based on time played?"
ChivalryGame,322ka5,Yazuak,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:29:47 2015 UTC,"The ping kicking threshold is hilariously broken and dysfunctional.   Just because TBS can't make shit that works doesn't mean it can't be made.  I personally thing it makes more sense to rebalance based on a mix of total kills and assists combined with objective completion time (it makes sense that the defending side would have more kills than the attacking side, for example), but perhaps rank could be weighed in their too somehow. Of course it would only need to rebalance if things were clearly and dramatically stacked.  It's undeniable that the current balancing system is shitty and needs work, though. The ideal would be for players to have a rating like LoL or starcraft and have it balance based on that but I hate ratings because they discourage fucking around."
ChivalryGame,322ka5,HELPMEIMGONADIE,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:18:41 2015 UTC,"If it could be made I think it would be alright, however in the grand scheme of things could hurt the community as it grows smaller.   A rebalance like that sounds like a more fair system, but in pubs that I've been in for awhile I don't see a need to implement it honestly."
ChivalryGame,322ka5,Xylvion,3,Mon Apr 13 16:23:29 2015 UTC,They actually changed it from the last person to die to the last few who joined then died.
ChivalryGame,322ka5,Mestarrr,3,Mon Apr 13 20:14:06 2015 UTC,"Wow, good job downvoting facts.  It seems people don't understand the difference between joining a server and joining a team after the map changed."
ChivalryGame,322ka5,Xylvion,2,Fri Apr 10 12:03:24 2015 UTC,People don't like being corrected it seems.
ChivalryGame,322ka5,thebadz,0,Sat Apr 11 06:37:19 2015 UTC,"That's garbage, I was one of the first on agatha. My first death I was instantly moved to  mason."
ChivalryGame,322ka5,Xylvion,3,Sat Apr 11 11:34:53 2015 UTC,First on Agatha doesn't mean you were the first on the server.
ChivalryGame,322ka5,Xylvion,0,Fri Apr 10 13:34:38 2015 UTC,"It's also extremely unlikely he was one of the last on the server, though.  Also stop downvoting like a bitch just because people disagree with you."
ChivalryGame,322ka5,Xylvion,3,Fri Apr 10 19:01:27 2015 UTC,"How is it highly likely that he wasn't one of the last on the server? Maybe he joined at the last 5 seconds of the last round for all we know.   As I said, they changed it to be one of the last few, the last few is more than 1 person, they can't blance a person on Mason to be in Mason now can they? I'm not entirely sure about how the pool for autobalance looks like, but I've been playing chivalry long enough to know the autobalance is much better now than when it randomly balanced the first one to die. Either way if a person of the ""last joined"" have been on the server for 30 minutes, 30 minutes is still shorter than 60 minutes, simple maths."
ChivalryGame,322ka5,ImSpl2iG,-2,Fri Apr 10 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"Because if he's the very first person on a team he's probably not one of the last people to join. Pretty simple.  And like I said, THREE rounds in a row either me or my buddy were autobalanced the other night, and we definitely weren't the last in the servers.  Plus nothing has changed in the server config files regarding autobalance. I can't find anything on Google or the forums that even suggests autobalance has changed at all, so I'm just gonna go ahead and say you're full of shit. Prove me wrong, if you can."
ChivalryGame,322ka5,HELPMEIMGONADIE,2,Fri Apr 10 19:23:27 2015 UTC,"I've already told you, just because he was the first to join agatha of one round doesn't mean he was the first to join the server that's been up for several hours and obviously had people playing on it. A new round doesn't magically turn you into the first person on the server.  http://forums.tornbanner.com/showthread.php/21433-Chivalry-Medieval-Warfare-Patch-29-%28Battle-for-Balance%29  Auto balance now selects from a threshold of the 1/5th most recently joined players on death  There, I got proof, can you stop spouting nonsense now please?"

ChivalryGame,322cmr,gundog48,7,Fri Apr 10 00:39:44 2015 UTC,"It has a lot to do with who you play with. If you join lobbies with high ranked players you will run into the beybladers. It's only natural that someone who is a high rank will have played a lot and will have gotten very good at the game.  You hit a wall at a certain point where, in order to get any better, you have to learn the silly ballerina moves. People who decide not to scale that wall generally stop playing shortly thereafter because they stop progressing. Not many people can continue to play a game if they don't feel like they're improving.  My advice is to stop giving a shit. Get really annoyingly good with a stupid weapon like the quarterstaff or the hatchet and fuck up their meta. You'd be surprised how many 2leet4u players can't cope with fighting weapons that they don't practice for eons against in classic duel servers. And the best part is they look like a tosspot when they complain in the chat about how OP the cudgel is. (Don't actually use the cudgel. It's really bad.)  This doesn't work against everyone. You might still get rekt by the gold helms who actually know what they're doing instead of acting solely on testosterone and muscle memory.  If that doesn't work you can just try to find a group of people to play with. Join a teamspeak or something."

ChivalryGame,322cmr,YourMoneyOrYourLife,26,Fri Apr 10 17:20:14 2015 UTC,"I think its really unfair that casual players consider them better than ""tryhards"" because casual players are only playing for ""fun"".  You can play the game however you want, and so can we.  You're complaining that we're ruining the game for you because we use drags and feints but have you thought that the hordes of ""casual"" players ruin the game for us?  Unreasonable votekicks, not votekicking somebody whose tking or lagging like hell, raging in the chat, unnecessary tking, often times not contributing to the objective, calling out ""tryhards"" for using the game's mechanics, etc.  The players that you're talking about, as in the good players that are in a pub, are playing for fun.  If they were playing to get better, they'd be probably be in a scrim or duels.  They know the mechanics and they use them because they're like second nature not because they've memorized the most optimal combo to win.  Its fun to beat people; thats the point of most games and certainly this game.  Besides, most of the servers that I play in usually have none or only a couple ""tryhards""."
ChivalryGame,322cmr,DasHeadCrapHGN,3,Fri Apr 10 00:59:02 2015 UTC,"I hope I made it clear that I had nothing against people that chose to play it like that, I'd just rather the two could play separately, which it sounds like you would like too.  It just seems that the spirit is dead. I used to be quite good, but then sometimes you'd get stomped all over, and it'd be okay, because it wasn't about winning, and you could respect the other guy. You'd normally joke about it in chat, get a friendly rivalry going, and often end up playing the next game together. I really miss the banter that used to go on, everyone was so friendly. I don't know if the community's just got bigger or what. But there's something about getting killed by someone flailing around like a nutter, moving and crouching in a way no human would that never fails to annoy me, you feel cheated. Because that's no longer 'medieval warfare', it looks like you're being killed by some moron flopping around on the floor."
ChivalryGame,322cmr,PreparetobePlaned,3,Fri Apr 10 01:24:32 2015 UTC,Expecting a true reenactment of Medieval warfare from Chivalry is as dumb as expecting a real reenactment of modern combat from Call of Duty. Go play Mount and Blade or War of the Roses if you want a medieval warfare simulator.
ChivalryGame,322cmr,Gudakesa_,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:23:43 2015 UTC,"Dunno what you are talking about I still have those experiences pretty much every time I pub. I also rarely see anyone RoH or even feint in pubs, usually it's only used in duels or scrims."
ChivalryGame,322cmr,Koiuki,-1,Fri Apr 10 21:41:03 2015 UTC,"Bro, just learn how to play. It's like if you complained about players using flashbangs too well on counter strike or something.  The game is more about who has the advantage and who has the disadvantage. It's a rhythm in combat like waves. You must first understand the rhythm to manipulate it into crushing your enemy. Your rhythm must be unpredictable. Imagine yourself as a buoy gently floating over them but remaining in place. That is your state of mind. Everything else is just swordplay, but the game is won in your head."
ChivalryGame,322cmr,TobiwanK3nobi,-4,Fri Apr 10 05:19:25 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree about the flashbang comment. I used to play this shitty korean CS clone called War Rock where you could hold down your prone key and switch instantly between prone and crouching repeatedly, there was no delay on it. It just looked unrealistic and stupid, same for those who went from standing to prone in a millisecond in close quarters. It's that sort of thing, it feels like you've been cheated and it's not grounded in reality.  Dying never bothered me, I used to do it a lot, mostly because I used to play drunk all the damn time! I know exactly what you mean about the rhythm, you kinda have to tune into it and it makes everything easier. But as I say, it's not dying that bothers me, it's the spirit of the game which just seems to have disappeared. The people on there used to be so much fun, now I just can't seem to find it."
ChivalryGame,322cmr,HELPMEIMGONADIE,6,Fri Apr 10 11:26:48 2015 UTC,"if nobody tryharded the playerbase would eventually die. you can only play so much before you get good enough to parry everyone's lmb spam and  same goes for them, nothings going to happen besides a bunch of clings from one person to the next, it would basically be a fight to see who runs out of stamina first, I'm sure quite a bit of players who you consider ""try-hards"" only played the game for fun and eventually stopped having fun with constant lmb into parry into riposte into parry ect. there would be no point to play after a certain point if nobody tryharded."
ChivalryGame,322cmr,the_kanguru,14,Fri Apr 10 06:59:27 2015 UTC,"Public games are still 90% casual players who haven't even mastered the basics, so I don't know what you mean by 'too serious.'  I think you're approaching CMW with the wrong mindset though. It's not a silly silly funtiems game where we chuckle about heads being chopped off. It wasn't intended to be. That kind of fun only lasts for a few dozen hours of play, and doesn't even touch the amount of fun you can have in CMW if you approach it with the mindset of wanting to get better and win.  If you want casual fun, I recommend trying some of the modded servers - low gravity, slow-mo/accelerated gamespeed, giant slayers, and black knight."
ChivalryGame,322cmr,ParkRangerStan,8,Fri Apr 10 02:31:22 2015 UTC,Really solid advice here.  If you live in North America I highly recommend the FOR custom map server as well. Great rotation and they do mods or specific nights for class restrictions and the like.

I don't see how this ruins the game for casual players apart from the fact that they might die a lot and potentially lose.

Jesus fucking christ when ever I hear ""try hard"" I imagine a little kid wanting everyone to hand him their head on a silver platter without putting up a fight."
ChivalryGame,322cmr,bltrocker,0,Fri Apr 10 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"To me, trying hard is when you start to deconstruct the game in a way that sacrifices the 'spirit' of the game. So dragging and being generally good playing in a normal way is what I would expect. It's when you start going with ridiculous FOVs and moving around like a person without bones that I consider it a problem, because at that point you're no longer playing a game, you're breaking it down into it's component parts and the sword or spear just becomes a skin to aim at hitboxes.  In CS:GO I try hard on competitive. Apart from a few dodgey spots there's not much there that feels like you're exploiting the game. But when you play comp, you play to win, and unwriten rules go out of the window. But when you play casual or gungame and the like, there's certain times you might pass up a kill because you see that your teammate is in with a good chance of getting a knife kill, or because someone's AFK and it'd be cheeky to kill them before they get back!"
ChivalryGame,322cmr,Manzanis,2,Fri Apr 10 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"Even most comp players don't play at insane Fovs, i think most people stick around 120-130 which still looks completely normal. Mastering the movements and drags is just a consequence of getting good at controlling your character. You are still very much playing the game, it isn't as abstract as you are making it out to be. Nobody plays according to a set combo or set of moves that they have planned out ahead of time. Everything is still very fluid and dynamic, which is what keeps the game so interesting even after hundreds of hours of gameplay.  I don't get why it bothers you so much anyway. Just play the game the way you enjoy it and ignore those who play it differently. I jump into pubs if I just want to fool around and have some fun. I'll play on a duel server if I want to play more seriously. It's insulting calling someone a tryhard if just because they are better at the game then you are. If you refuse to learn the more advanced techniques that's your issue, don't insult the people that have put hundreds of hours into learning those techniques and getting good at the game."

Imagine Zorro doing the Z mark on a wall and his weapon slowing down every time after drawing a line (and because he couldn't complete his Z mark in 0.6 seconds it was only drawn halfway :D)  The turning/dragging speed decrease was there to prevent you from attacking in complex S-like patterns to confuse your enemy. It had its problems though: If your mouse were to suddenly hit a rough spot and change direction (while not actually visibly doing so) on its own it would cause your weapon to slow down and cause you to completely miss an attack without any apparent reason.

ChivalryGame,320ive,PreparetobePlaned,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:39:59 2015 UTC,Right? Without parrying we wouldn't even need to drag and feint! Removing parry would make the game so much better.
ChivalryGame,320ive,Xylvion,2,Thu Apr 9 21:46:44 2015 UTC,Even if it's a troll post. . . Perfect parry mod should be implemented as it'd require you to actually aim your parry properly and remove backparries.
ChivalryGame,320ive,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:05:33 2015 UTC,Parrying is EZ. Look in opposite direction and can still parry

It's purile, counter productive and the usual kind of neckbeard call to arms used to summon other members of the cheddary circle-jerk to mock and invalidate the opinions of people not on your team speak. I'm not even mad though."
ChivalryGame,320ive,twoLegsJimmy,-1,Thu Apr 9 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"If they truly were veterans they would be able to see that reverses are one of the easiest things to deal with and that low levels will never kill you with them unless you aren't paying attention. They are a dumb mechanic that has the potential to be fixed but these same ""veterans"" you defend are blind bats to people trying to fix the game and don't even know what is good for them because all they do is play public matches and consider feinting and dragging exploiting like a bunch of morons. These same people are literally championing for a simple, mind numbing melee game with the combat depth of a single key stroke or mouse click. Perhaps if they put in 1200 hours into learning how to use foot work, dragging, parrying, and analyzing the fact that reverses are only a problem in duels where two people must remain close by and must fight each other, they would see that perhaps you can beat these tactics by doing more than vanguard charging into people and lmbing through crowds to keep leveling up in public matches to give them some sort of appearance of being more knowledgeable than other low levels when really all they have mastered are low level tactics and are often found using zweihanders, mauls, messers, and claymores. These same people are vilely opposed to mercs for reasons not known as they don't make any sort of case against it. There are reasons to not like mercs and I have herd them from different people but the people that I talk to are not the same people that complain everywhere else. The people I talk to are informed and knowledgeable. The people complaining don't even know enough about the game they play because they delusion themselves into thinking their limited play style of pub stomping grants them any sort of comprehension of game mechanics. If only they would actually look at alternative options into game fixing rather than crying on forums because of their incompetence and neglecting other efforts to alleviate problems in the game then I would actually respect them. But as of right now, all I am seeing are people that don't know the game they play and are swaying the minds of others to believe them and thus completely derail efforts leading to a better game for everyone or at least the efforts of maintaining a community to play with. This is why I am making the sarcastic post."
ChivalryGame,320ive,Stael,2,Thu Apr 9 18:45:03 2015 UTC,"these same ""veterans"" you defend are blind bats to people trying to fix the game and don't even know what is good for them because all they do is play public matches and consider feinting and dragging exploiting like a bunch of morons.   I don't think people are saying the currents state is utilizing exploits--more that everyone is playing with a mature meta that is cheesy as hell. To discount that feeling because pub players are the most vocal about it (in your eyes) just goes to show the elitism and entitlement apparent in a subset of the comp player base i.e. the less than 1% of the total player base. Look at how popular the previous post is, and keep in mind that people probably aren't visiting this sub unless they're enthusiasts. It's counterproductive to create strawman arguments from the other side if you're actually looking to change hearts.   These same people are vilely opposed to mercs for reasons not known as they don't make any sort of case against it.   Another strawman. Top 6 things that I hate about mercs: archer flinch reinstated, windups increased without actually being able to fix certain broken animations causing overall regression to the mean for weapons, van's class ability removed, extraneous mechanics being proposed before the core game is perfectly balanced, proposed bounce off mechanic at face value clearly will cause more problems than solutions, and adrenaline mechanic encourages lone wolf play that should be neutral or if anything, punished. I've gone into detail on a few of these, and could extrapolate on any one of them.   The people complaining don't even know enough about the game they play because they delusion themselves into thinking their limited play style of pub stomping grants them any sort of comprehension of game mechanics.   Again, the ""dismissing the plebs"" type of thinking.   If only they would actually look at alternative options into game fixing rather than crying on forums because of their incompetence and neglecting other efforts to alleviate problems in the game then I would actually respect them.   I don't have an interest in testing and supporting a mod that clearly isn't for me (or almost 100% of Chiv players), and I have no interest in wasting time trying to support any other 3rd party solutions to further Chiv. I'm fine with mercs as ""competitive mod""; the only reason I care to publicly bag on it is because of the expressed hope by the modders that some of the changes make it into the standard game. While I probably don't have another 900 hours to put into the game, I'd like the time I do have remaining to be without a poor mod as the standard."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,AllUrMemes,51,Tue Apr 7 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"The over used broken mechanics is what did it in for me. I don't really mind that you can hit someone with a behind the back bay-blade maneuver, but using it almost constantly just ruins the fun. And there's no variation in fights anymore. You're either fighting someone who's using these mechanics to their advantage or you're fighting someone who's hasn't learned how to do them yet"

ChivalryGame,31t42a,PM_ME_YOUR_DATSUN,24,Wed Apr 8 01:22:46 2015 UTC,I used to love this game.  This post perfectly summarizes why I quit playing regularly. I only really log in now for the occasional duel
ChivalryGame,31t42a,PM_ME_YOUR_DATSUN,0,Wed Apr 8 03:21:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, I mainly prefer to duel, as it allows me to focus on a single opponent. While I dont use these trick techniques myself, I'm fairly versed in dealing with them, though I tire of fighting spindrag beybladers quickly. It's still fun to find those few honorable duelers and fight a good match"
ChivalryGame,31t42a,Something_Syck,3,Wed Apr 8 10:47:55 2015 UTC,"Duel is what I avoid like the plague now.  I go messer knight 90% of the time. I go against a vanguard who is spinning around so much he looks like the tasmanian devil cartoon just with occasional swords poking out of it, and he calls me a faggot for feinting.   this is 99% of duel servers now from what I've seen.   Although I found a great way to either shut them up or make their rage elevate to hilarious levels, all I say is ""I wouldn't feint so much if you wouldn't fall for it every single time"""
ChivalryGame,31t42a,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,7,Wed Apr 8 10:53:05 2015 UTC,Duel servers are toxic with their unspoken code of honor. Classic duel servers nobody gives a shit what code of honor you have as long as you now to duel.
ChivalryGame,31t42a,Raknarg,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:38:28 2015 UTC,I like duel servers. I usually have a great time there except for the few cases of straight up asshole players

Spoils all the fun of using actual tactics. Feinting is cheap and boring. I could feint too, but it would only make the fight that much easier for me. I prefer a fight mutually free of feints."

It's gotten to the point where I have to just predict my opponents movements without actually seeing his animation, which has improved my overall tactical abilities but leaves me feeling disgruntled with the game every time a feint leads into an instant overhead rendered in a single frame that is impossible to see.  I loved this game, but shit has just gotten ridiculous. Gonna wait for Chivalry 2, or ditch it entirely for whatever this Slasher stuff might be."

ChivalryGame,31t42a,kyle_gibson,13,Wed Apr 8 00:52:37 2015 UTC,"I have a few main issues with chiv but I continue to play because I still have fun. But, I agree with a lot you said.  The backswings are pretty broken at times, and it WAS cool when few people did it. The power of youtube and twitch and just playing has made it standard to just use any kind of backswing and make the whole spin to win meta ""the"" meta. I see so many retards spinning around, and people that can't even execute properly spin around and miss and that's funny, but then in comp you get good people that do the most broken backswings.  Archers are overpowered.  The maul one shots  Flinch is completely broken in live. I didn't like flinch in release because it was inconsistent and you didn't know when it would happen, yet I don't like constantly getting hit traded either as meta.  Aimpunch.  Claymore and a few other weapons are too fast to animate properly,  and also animations are kind of fucked up at times. There are weapons that literally force the game into desync and that's why i mention the claymore. Norse is broken as hell and I use it all the time as maa because of how brokenly overpowered it is.  Inconsistent kicks, stuck spots on maps, anything over 24 man servers making objectives impossible to complete with a semi not even really good defending team.  Now lets get to mercs mod - for duels its a fucking godsend. It's the best thing to happen to duels in a while. For team fighting, i'm not 100% sold on it. I do love the fact that you can flinch, but flinching that far into release kind of feels broken to me. I'lll get a lot of mercs people hating me for saying that because hit trades should never happen in most eyes, but sometimes they should (and still do in mercs). The balance seems to be somehow focused on duels though and weapon v weapon instead of how it is in team fighting, and doesn't really capture much balance in teamfights. I feel like you do need a certain level of imbalance in teamfights, but it hasn't captured that perfectly for me. I basically wanted mercs to be an archer nerf and the return of flinch as well as fixing some really broken weapons like claymore and thank god charge attacks are gone for now... and they've nerfed archers a bit and then gone back a step or two, and then flinch is kind of too much at times, and some of the handle hits have returned in too big of a way.   Anyway man, wall of text aside... the fact that the live game was left in such a shitty state, the forums are completely dead in talking about game mechanics now because torn banner has basically said we're fucked and stuck with it now is pretty shitty. Leaving all these cunty archers feeling like gods, and all the melee getting fucked by hit trades all day is pretty ridiculous. And now the mercs community has to try and save us all, but in my opinion the mercs changes in full will NEVER go into live, because it's too pro for most players and they will get rekt constantly and just quit and then there will be no public player base.  My opinions all of them, so don't take them personally."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,sesstreets,6,Wed Apr 8 01:11:19 2015 UTC,"Norse is OP now? Jesus Christ I stopped using the broadsword a while ago so you bastards would stop complaining about its overpoweredness , now you want to take my Norse away? What will satisfy you?"
ChivalryGame,31t42a,Clayton-BigsB,3,Wed Apr 8 11:14:28 2015 UTC,"I mained maa for 1800 hours and honestly the broadsword was OP. There was no reason to use any other weapon was there?  Norse isn't OP, it just has wonky animations."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,BioshockEndingD00D,6,Wed Apr 8 15:36:18 2015 UTC,"after broadsword nerf, norse is new broadsword man. I can hardly notice the less range, and it's faster with the same HTK so...   i shouldn't have said overpowered though, just broken. The combo times, stab times, and recovery times are crazy and I feel like i just get free hits on people the whole time. Combine it with a shield and good day sir."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,faktorfaktor,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:32:05 2015 UTC,That and it has lower stab recovery so poking endlessly aka 90% of maa players is better with norse as well. Maa pokes knight. Knight spams mousewheel down with his norse because maa didn't combo. Maa is spamming mousewheel up because he likes spooky stab spam. Result is usually a trade lol. And in mercs I'm pretty sure the maa will flinch you lol but I haven't tried dueling maa with the latest version so Idk.
ChivalryGame,31t42a,sesstreets,3,Wed Apr 8 23:26:14 2015 UTC,Implying there is a reason to use any other weapon than norse outside mercs after the broadsword nerf.
ChivalryGame,31t42a,Clayton-BigsB,2,Fri Apr 10 09:27:38 2015 UTC,In live? Its norse 100% bc nothing else has the speed to keep up w/ everything else. In mercs? Take your pick. Besides the hatchet everything is viable.
ChivalryGame,31t42a,thefranchise23,3,Wed Apr 8 20:07:09 2015 UTC,i used norse in mercs as well.

I have to anticipate it a little, just like the claymore (i'm playing with 40-60 ping btw). It feels better to fight against in mercs while still being a good weapon, but in vanilla, it is pretty much the only weapon I see used by maa."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,muchverygood,1 point,Wed Apr 8 23:26:37 2015 UTC,"i shouldn't have said overpowered, but it is pretty broken. It's also the only maa weapon you need right now, not saying the others are not 'viable', but the norse is > any other maa weapon. Before handle hit nerf and broadsword nerf, broadsword was the best, and then morningstar had it's uses too. Still good, but too slow on overheads to beat anything to the punch without getting traded and it's not worth it to trade as maa.  norse is also best secondary for knights too."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,0,Thu Apr 9 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"Wasn't aware norse was op. Granted its ripostes and feints are probably too fast, but its the only viable maa weapon atm."

ChivalryGame,31t42a,twoLegsJimmy,6,Wed Apr 8 12:38:41 2015 UTC,"I feel much the same, especially about the ROH meta. I'm even seeing level 30-40s doing that shit now, people who don't even play the game regularly. No offense to people like Mauldini, I know he's skilled, but that kind of fighting is a huge turn-off for me about CMW.  I think throwing out a reverse now and again is fine, but not to utilize it for its deceptiveness to bypass parry. I used one yesterday, but it was because I thought an enemy was approaching from behind and I needed to look that way while finishing my other opponent.  It's just flawed combat mechanics all-around, but I can't expect perfect polish on TB's first attempt. Hopefully some of these oversights will be corrected in CMW2.  Luckily, Mercs mod plans to fix ROH along with a lot of other broken things. I don't much like segregating myself from the rest of the community(I love slaughtering noobs), but if it's to play a more polished CMW, I guess I'll have to."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,Reithur,8,Thu Apr 9 00:05:37 2015 UTC,"This post really resonates with me. I got into the game a bit late (right as glitched rank and bubble patch were happening), but still early enough that learning good footwork and smart attacks as a noob maa got me to #1-3 on the TO scoreboard consistently with under 50 hours of playtime. Now, it's a straight cheesefest. All the 43+ are pulling the dumbest shit in order to win, and I'm one of them. While it's pretty fun to join Clay on Friday and play against all the high ranks he draws to pubs, it's just not the same as it used to be being a mid-level playing against all the other mid-levels. I guess that's why I've been hanging out in the FOR server lately; I can let my mind go and just hang out and bash shit. The game is too niche for the constant mlg attitude that's left in the admittedly pretty weak community."

ChivalryGame,31t42a,bltrocker,5,Wed Apr 8 04:53:40 2015 UTC,"Good post. I've stopped playing over the past few days, after having played daily since it was released; I've finally had enough with it.  It's just no fun anymore. TO is just stacking and archers, and duel is just who can do the most fucked up manoeuvre to invalidate the animations. Last time I duelled, I got FFA'd to death twice in a row as soon as I joined by high level players trolling, then I fought one of them and he ran to the fountain to heal twice and then called me a cunt when I still won, and then I fought some ""Major Somthington"" guy who was about to lose so he did some weird unanimated thing that looked like an activated speedhack and wrote something slick in chat about it. By that point I thought 'fuck this' and left shortly after.  Also, this hits the nail on the head about archers : ""... they want to be a CoD sniper where no one else has guns except them.""  The game's really on it's last legs now, even the official forums are dead."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,Reithur,6,Wed Apr 8 16:20:01 2015 UTC,"FYI, Mercenary's Mod addresses most of this and we're hoping these changes will be accepted by Torn Banner.   Reverse Overheads: the first 1 or two frames of the overhead's release animation will result in a bounce as if they struck the ground or a map object (specifically the first two Ticks in the new timing system) Archer Weapons: damage and ammo capacity have been adjusted.  Won't stop the snipers from sniping, but it'll reduce their damage somewhat Most Weapons: have had wind-up and release speed adjustments"
ChivalryGame,31t42a,the_kanguru,1 point,Wed Apr 8 13:29:03 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I understand what you said about ROH... If you try to ROH your attack will fail?  Or it just won't hit during the first 2 frames?
ChivalryGame,31t42a,bltrocker,6,Tue Apr 7 23:58:52 2015 UTC,"Both; it won't cause damage at the beginning of release.  It's like you tried to LMB at someone and hit a tree or wall instead.  Merc's is not really tracking frames; they've changed how the timing system works to make it easier for programming.  Check out Spook's vid that explains the new Tick system.  At the very beginning of an overhead's release phase (first two ticks), it will bounce off a player as if you hit the ground.  This will make ROH very difficult to use."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,Nohlium,0,Wed Apr 8 00:01:31 2015 UTC,"It will punish players for trying to roh, like Will said a while back. People will still try to learn how to use roh's by ever so slightly timing the new mechanic."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,sesstreets,4,Wed Apr 8 00:37:27 2015 UTC,"They can try.  Not sure how you'll be able to time it in reverse to get a b0ckswing; when you turn and lean back, it usually starts the attack with the weapon tracers inside the opponent.   You'd have to be relying on an opponent to walk/run into the strike after it's started.  You can drag it all the way around to hit them at the end of release; this is already done as a fake ROH.  I'm estimating that you'll get accidental attack cancellations if you connect a normal overhead with someone who was behind you that you didn't know was there."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,Nohlium,-4,Wed Apr 8 13:38:00 2015 UTC,"I know you're a cool and nice dude, but what you're saying is just not true.

ChivalryGame,31t42a,sesstreets,6,Wed Apr 8 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not particularly optimistic that the changes in Mercs will be adopted by TB.  I've seen favourite games abandoned by the devs before; I used to run the official forum for one.  It's sad.  But I will say that this is the most concerted effort put forth by the players that I've witnessed.  So I'm hopeful, but not enough that I'm holding my breath.  Until Slasher or Chiv 2 comes out, Mercs seems to fix parts of the game that need fixing.  And that's good enough for me for now.

Look at Slasher, and I am sure many more indie or AAA titles are coming that will feature similar Chivalry combat.  Also, Chivalry's combat is kinda fun, but retarded most of the time.. Reverse Overheads, no clashing, no chambering, fucking kicks never work, tornbanner doesn't even FUCKING patch anything, working on their ""secret project"" oh fuck off tornbanner just fuck off.  Chivalry isn't gonna get any better"
ChivalryGame,31t42a,mobinstime,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:15:56 2015 UTC,"Ha, no.  Chivalry gave birth to a genre, how it is not a great base since it clearly inspired similar games? Bushido goes Standalone, DayZ goes standalone, Project Reality (Battlefield) goes standalone, that has nothing to do with the solid base concept of the game, they derived their concept from.  Now, I really really really don't want clashing brought into Chivalry, thats stupid, and never happened in the battlefield. Think about it, you purposefully are trying to destroy your own weapon as some kind of basic defence mechanism. I'd rather have little awkward fights, than movie-tropes brought into the game."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,0,Wed Apr 8 18:24:14 2015 UTC,"Clashing could actually happen on the battlefield, but not often.  When I say Clashing I mean weapons colliding with each other.  Chivalry doesn't have that, which is kinda stupid.  Just my opinion though.  Movie tropes?  Chivalry already has enough movie tropes.  Heads come off easily, legs get chopped off easily, and a lot more.  The game isn't realistic at all.    Just because Chivalry was the first fucking game to function as a  first person slasher with a good parrying system and attack directions doesn't mean it owns the right to the concept.    Seriously, what do you mean it never happened in the battlefield? You think fucking weapons just went through each other and hit their opponent? In slasher it's perfectly possible to stop clashing and do something to actually hit your opponent."

Reverse is often only usable in duels, but duels still happen in TO. Maul is the epitome of idiotic too-long drag and instant reverse mixups, especially with ping factored in. It literally looks the same and you can accidentally miss the reverse instant then convert it into a 180 super drag.  TBS probably did all their playtesting on LAN or something lol that's why we have weapons like old HWS."
ChivalryGame,31t42a,Nohlium,3,Wed Apr 8 05:05:42 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I haven't played Chivalry for half a year, but before that I put something like 700 hours into it (yes, I know, I'm a noob).  When I started playing, facing a level 40+ player was fucking awesome, I would get destroyed because they had better footwork, awereness or parries, but it felt good and I was learning all the time.  Eventually I became better and better, but facing 40+ players was still awesome. I still remember some of those duels.   Then I hit 40. I was stomping low level players and most of the 40+ players. I had never seen anyone at level 50. Fighting was still fun but I started to see dragging and ROH's.. More and more.. And learned them myself as well.  Now, I'm at 48 and probably will stay there. Fighting experienced players is fun no more. It's not about footwork, awereness, or timing, but who can pull out the most fucked up move this time. Duels used to be awesome with lots of movement, parries, blocks, but now it's just a drag fest - triple feint - roh - drag stabbing (seriously, drag stabbing, what the heck, you drag the side of your blade to an enemy?) Either I lose because of cheap tactics, or I win with the same cheap tactics and feel more disgusted than rewarded about it.  Chivalry is a great, maybe the best multiplayer game for casual playing, but it completely breaks down when players reach certain skill level."

Key words are ""the use of"" -- I don't ""defend"" the mechanics themselves, they're part of the reason I rarely play any more just like OP, but I will always defend the player's right to use them unless they're literally broken as in glitches / bugs. While this game is a buggy piece of shit, not many of the bugs are advantageous to combat, despite how some people will say reverse overheads and such are exploits when they're really not."

Its the same reason I don't like the NFL much- the rules favor throwing all passes and handicap the defense and running games, and that's what I like.  I liked Chiv better when you would use footwork and strategy to land hits rather than insane acceleration or drags or ROH. I love the idea of drags and acceleration its just that you can do it too much... Only having one frame to block a claymore is not fun to me. It makes the game all about reflex rather than thinking.  I don't have the reflexes to compete. That's why I liked Chiv  versus other FPS games. But now its turning into medieval CoD and I dislike that."

ChivalryGame,31um4f,OmarWarOgre,3,Wed Apr 8 07:33:20 2015 UTC,What is the mod aiming to do? Make the game more realistic?
ChivalryGame,31um4f,XXLpeanuts,5,Wed Apr 8 15:57:48 2015 UTC,"It's designed to improve team play and give the game more depth. Ultimately it will be a total overhaul of combat, UI, gamemodes, and really everything else in Chivalry.   In a lot of ways it does make the game more realistic - classes now have more specific strengths and weaknesses based on the kind of armour they're wearing, and so do weapons. For example, knights are almost invulnerable to slashing attacks now (as would be realistic for a knight in full plate). However, they now have an added vulnerability to blunt weapons. Blunt weapons in turn have been made poor parrying weapons, so their specific role as armour busters is both realistic and fun gameplay wise. They can easily kill knights with a few hits, but can't mix it up close with a swordman. Every weapon and class matchup is dynamic and interesting, rather than the greatsword/messer/broadsword fest of vanilla.  I've also added in half-swording which gives swords more versatility.  There are new mechanics to encourage players to group up and fight together, like the Momentum mechanic - players receive a small defensive buff for every friendly standing next to them. That's not the only thing though, since I've also made teammates impassable to attacks. They still take team damage, but team fights are now more manageable and fair - no more enemy weapons stabbing through their teammates to hit you. So far feedback has been really positive about this, and personally I've found it causes really awesome fights between big groups of players.   There's a whole bunch of tweaks and changes, the full details are on the mods steam page (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=292007783)"
ChivalryGame,31um4f,XXLpeanuts,2,Wed Apr 8 23:36:30 2015 UTC,This genuinely sounds like perfection. I hope it takes off.

There might still be starting classes, or everyone might just start as a single base class and upgrade their gear at will (not certain yet).   Custom maps would be cool, but for the forseeable future (unless any mappers want to join the team) we'd be altering existing maps."

I'd captured @ 60fps 720p, then after editing I had to try a wide array of rendering/exporting settings. Premier would crash with 90% of them. The 10% which worked were very large (1.5GB compared to the 300MB youtube preset export settings I wanted to use).   After exhausting all the debugging fixes I'd found in forums I ended up rendering/exporting twice just to get it to work.. think the final FPS dropped to 24 as opposed to the 60 originally captured. I know there are ways to create blended frames between frames for a more smooth video but didn't have the patience to read into it (yet). That probably explains the choppiness at times.. I may have even exported to 30 fps then re-exported that to 24 fps lol.  Mind if I ask what program you edit with and what general settings you export with? (fps, resolution, should I worry about video size like I'd mentioned above?). I happened to watch your maa knifing video last night and remember it looked great!"

ChivalryGame,31tdjf,nitram916,2,Wed Apr 8 20:18:50 2015 UTC,"I rarely crouch unless either forcing an overhead or making someone believe I'm going to force and follow with a drag. Most rev-overheads are by lining up my right shoulder with their face with the swing's wind-up beginning just before or as I begin turning around. The key is to hide it coming as long as possible. Also with rev-oh's - I try to choose rotation direction on the fly contingent on where my target is in comparison to where the maul is or is going to be at the end of next combo'd swing, etc.   To me, effective mauling focuses on delivering an unpredictable and wide contrast between drag and force swings, swing timing as well as precision footwork. Many times when I'm winning it's not so much that I'm doing something special as much as I take opportunities to punish mistakes, and hard. If you want to play real aggressive against good players it's crucial to have a clear plan or direction you're taking the fight. Similar to Protoss on SC2 I've found I can do well going into fights without much of an offensive plan and play reactionary.. changing what I'm doing to best contend with whatever they've led with. Opportunist.. Less risk, more room for error. It's also made me a pretty strong defensive player and rounded me well with all sorts of goofy metagame play. I tried to keep the video pretty creative to inspire others to mix it up and try new combos and styles. With the wide-range of swing speeds and 360 deg horizontal n vertical aiming I like to think there's still room for innovative play in the game!  TLDR: I lik mol."

Also, from my guide (now available on the sidebar!);   You may have to create a new display resolution for the game to detect it; use your graphics card's control application to create a custom video resolution (use the same aspect ratio as your maximum resolution for best results)   Example: 1920x1080 (HD) is the same aspect ratio as 1600x900, 1366x768, or 1280x720  Also, if you're on linux;  From /u/Kevinismus; I'd like to add a solution for my fellow Linux-users who have got NVIDIA graphics cards: After turning down the graphics quality in Chivalry's menu (including the resolution), you may notice that the changes are not applied (i.e. there is no difference in terms of frame rate). In order to fix this problem, you have to set your system's display resolution manually (for example from 1920x1080 to 1280x720) via NVIDIA X Server Settings. Afterwards, you can start Chivalry, recheck the graphics settings and enjoy the game. FYI: I'm using Linux Mint 17 Xfce (x64)."

ChivalryGame,31n2n5,Reithur,6,Mon Apr 6 16:33:57 2015 UTC,I feel like any FOV between 120-140 is reasonable. I personally play with 130; it provides enough peripherals without distorting the screen too much. Sensitivity is something you should muck around with until you get comfortable. Mine is 80 in game and I've just continued to increase my mouse DPI to 8.5k. 1st person only.
ChivalryGame,31n2n5,CrimsonArmada,3,Mon Apr 6 16:52:37 2015 UTC,80 in game and 8500 DPI? How in the world is that even possible to have any kind of accuracy?
ChivalryGame,31n2n5,PostPostModernism,5,Tue Apr 7 20:16:12 2015 UTC,"First person is easier to gauge distance, parry incoming attacks, and to accurately aim your own attacks.  Wider FOV allows you to see opponents approach from the side easier than a narrow FOV.  This vid shows a pretty good example of different FOV settings.  You learn quickly to look around and keep track of your opponents when in 1st person.  I play with first person, 130 FOV and have gotten used to distortions (some people call it ""fishbowl"" effect).  It did take time to adjust and accurately gauge range for longer weapons that come in from the side of your view; greatswords & zweihanders can look like you are out of range, but the fishbowl effect can distort your depth perception for a while until you adapt.  You can achieve a higher FOV than 120 by opening your console (~ key) and typing fov 130 (or any number you choose).  If you do this in-game instead of at the main menu, you have to switch weapons for it to take effect, or respawn.  If you're used to playing at FOV 95, I suggest increasing by 5 or 10, playing for a few hours to acclimatize yourself, then go up another 5 or 10 until you're comfortable.  If you find fishbowl distortion harms your gameplay, reduce FOV until you're happy again.  I don't think I've heard of a player in the competitive scene that uses less than 100; most use 100-140.  3rd person allows you to see more to the sides and even behind you, but it skews your perception of distance and makes it difficult to defend against attacks.  Most 3rd person players I've seen use heavy weapons with knight or vanguard and rely on hit-trading to score kills, trusting their high damage & health to win fights (called ""cavemanning"" and is not limited to 3rd person users).  You can usually tell when someone is in 3rd person because they often run crouched over (we call it ""ground sniffing"") so they can see behind them and to make their overhead attacks connect faster.  Many competitive clan servers in North America have 3rd person view disabled, and I don't believe it's allowed in NA tournaments.  My mouse settings are 30 (default for game) w/ a 3500 dpi mouse."

ChivalryGame,31n2n5,Reithur,2,Tue Apr 7 06:48:29 2015 UTC,"I think you're just messing with your head using this aspect ratio; you're not actually gaining a wider view, just stretching a small window wider.  I think this actually gives you a narrower FOV."

You just need to give yourself time to adapt.    Low FOV is much better for playing archer, however, a higher FOV is better for melee combat.  Consider using some config scripts that adjust your FOV based on the weapon you are using.  Personally, I dont play archer much, and usually am playing with an FOV of 150.  I dont have an issue parrying attacks and it certainly gives me an advantage in terms of seeing whats happening on the battlefield."

Only keybinds I have are mouse buttons for dodge, alt slash, and alt overhead. I also have the archer zoom bind, not only for archer but I use it as my ""elvish eyes"" when playing melee to spot archers in the distance, even though it will not stop me from getting shot.

ChivalryGame,31n2n5,Xylvion,2,Mon Apr 6 21:24:36 2015 UTC,I play with 136fov and get 120fps on my 144hz monitor.  A higher fov will probably help you but really it's down to practise.  Specifically you start to build into your muscle memory the animations of each type of swing and the timings for it. Once you can identify which type of swing( as well as telling when it is a drag) they are doing and when it will land then you can start doing them yourself. Soon you will be pro.
ChivalryGame,31n2n5,MajorGrempington,2,Tue Apr 7 03:28:02 2015 UTC,"Sensitivity matters far less than some people think it does. I take a lot of breaks from Chiv and every time I come back, I adjust to a new sensitivity. I've played with some crazy high shit (5cm/360°) as well as some low shit (45cm/360°), just try to find something you're comfortable with and stick to it. TB isn't very good at preserving your settings between updates so it's probably worth writing down the numerical value of your in-game sensitivity so you can restore it when it gets reset."

I use LMB for stab, right side mouse button for swing, left side mouse button for alt swing, scroll down for overhead, scroll up for alt overhead.

If you have neighbours using wifi on the same channels as yours, your router will have to sort through their traffic as well.  Pick a different channel for your router to use; usually will show you other networks in range.  Another tip is use a wired connection; your router will often prioritize wired connections over wifi and poor signal strength or someone using the microwave won't disrupt your game.

(below is copied from another post I made)   Try to use the same aspect ratio your current monitor uses)    - you may have to create a new display resolution for the game to detect it; use your graphics card's control application to create a custom video resolution (as stated above, use the same aspect ratio as your maximum resolution for best results)    - Example: 1920x1080 (HD) is the same aspect ratio as 1600x900, 1366x768, or 1280x720   Your game may not be using your video card. Check the 3D render settings in your card's control application and set it to use ""CMW. exe"". This last point may fix all your issues."

Just started happening within the last few weeks, pretty much after the game reset all my settings (and yes i've re-done them all).  I also notice a high level of desync going on, people will not even windup and their body just looks at me and apparently I die. I've also noticed a great deal of really fucked up animations.  It always seems to be only me experiencing this shit, we had a scrim on mercs last night and I didn't see any of it. Typically happens a lot more when I'm on a 32 man server (which i despise but have to play a lot).  My settings are on absolutely lowest possible except for my resolution.

ChivalryGame,31k8km,Reithur,2,Sun Apr 5 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"It's the same thing. As if your swing gets flinched, except with a parry. So if you've right clicked to parry but someone hits you before the actual blocking part of the animation and than it gets flinched, so someone else can come in and smack you where you would've blocked them if not for being flinched"
ChivalryGame,31k8km,Alice_Ex,2,Mon Apr 6 08:01:28 2015 UTC,You are looking for the parry action to have no windup time and go straight to release?  This would fundamentally change the game and probably make every fight last until someone runs out of stamina.  I do not believe the Mercs council will remove parry/shield windup.
ChivalryGame,31k8km,Reithur,3,Sun Apr 5 22:55:32 2015 UTC,"I think what he's talking about is if you get hit while blocking (like from behind) it won't let you block again until your parry recovery has expired.  I think that instead of taking you straight out of recovery, getting hit simply shouldn't cancel blocks. For example, Mr.messer is about to overhead you and you block, but right at that moment you get stabbed from behind by Mr. sneaky MAA, then the messer overhead comes down and chops your face off because your parry was cancelled by Mr. sneaky MAA. I think it would be good if the parry wasn't cancelled, meaning the messer swing would be blocked despite getting stabbed."
ChivalryGame,31k8km,Stael,2,Sun Apr 5 23:31:04 2015 UTC,That makes a lot more sense.  I would agree with this kind of change.
ChivalryGame,31k8km,Alice_Ex,2,Sun Apr 5 23:40:37 2015 UTC,"flanking would be the same  let's be real, flinching someone's parry just as your teammate is about to hit him only ever happens incidentally. thinking about it, flinchable parries don't contribute to anything but making the game more one-shotty than it has to be  one person bypassing my parry in a brief 2v1 situation shouldn't make me die instantly"
ChivalryGame,31k8km,ia_Flame,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:45:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, you would have to attack intelligently, but you should be doing that already anyway. Everybody goes into a blood frenzy when it's 1vsMany and forget that continually swinging at someone is a bad way to kill them, regardless of how many people are attacking at once..."
ChivalryGame,31k8km,Alice_Ex,2,Mon Apr 6 14:16:28 2015 UTC,"Eh, people should be rewarded for team play, this only promotes lone wolf gameplay I can't really agree with this"
ChivalryGame,31k8km,ia_Flame,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:57:05 2015 UTC,"I can see wanting to balance things towards team play, but this isn't even really a balance change, more of a fix for just another one of those poorly thought out edge cases in chivalry.  I don't care if you support the change or not, but ""people should be rewarded for team play"" is bad reason not to fix a broken mechanic."
ChivalryGame,31k8km,Alice_Ex,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:55:20 2015 UTC,"Well first it isn't a broken mechanic if anything it makes sense your parry is cancelled by being hit in the back by someone. This change would just allow people to never ending party others in a 2 v 1 and only take half the damage and thus reward people for exploiting that fact perhaps just to stay alive longer until someone else comes or they can find a moment to reposition themselves in order to win rather than dying as they should have for being outflanked and being out numbered. This change would make lone wolfing so much easier and make surviving multiple engagements so much easier. So in that regard, supporting team play by rewarding flanking and multiple coinciding attacks/slightly off timed attacks to get around party windows is a good argument. Then imagine this mechanic with man at arms dodging, how fun would it be to be able to dodge out of parry and have the ability to block 50% of attacks regardless of timing differences. I don't see this change ever coming to fruition"
ChivalryGame,31k8km,Manzanis,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:43:56 2015 UTC,"it makes sense your parry is cancelled by being hit in the back by someone.   I take it you're talking about make sense in a ""real life"" sort of way. First of all that's a terrible metric to judge mechanics by. Second of all, it does in fact make sense - if you're a seasoned warrior with adrenaline pumping through you I'm pretty sure you can still block a sword coming at your face despite getting slashed in the back at the same moment.   This change would just allow people to never ending party others in a 2 v 1 and only take half the damage and thus reward people for exploiting that fact   No, it would mean that just because it's a 2v1 doesn't mean you can be more reckless. You would have to use the same tactics you use in 1v1 - feints, intimidation, etc to get around their parry rather than just trying to overwhelm your opponent with sheer numbers. It would be like a 1v1 but with the added help of being able to attack from both sides. Two smart, non-greedy players will still be able to dispatch one person with some coordination, but I agree that if you fuck it up and play stupidly it might even be easier to 2v1 for him because you're feeding him ripostes.   This change would make lone wolfing so much easier and make surviving multiple engagements so much easier.   It would definitely make it easier but I think you're overestimating the impact. This situation rarely happens in my experience. It would be one less situation where death is out of your control, and one more situation where your skill can shine through, if you have it.   supporting team play by rewarding flanking and multiple coinciding attacks/slightly off timed attacks to get around party windows is a good argument.   You make it sound like people do it on purpose, when really 99% of the time in a 2v1 if you have an opening to damage someone you're going to take it, regardless of the timing. The real meta of 2v1s is to get on either side of a person, because they can't block both places at once. So what if they can block one person? They're still getting stabbed every second and are going to die quickly, plus the other person can just feint them or make them panic parry.   Then imagine this mechanic with man at arms dodging, how fun would it be to be able to dodge out of parry and have the ability to block 50% of attacks regardless of timing differences.   Having a hard time visualizing this situation.   I don't see this change ever coming to fruition   Neither do I, just like all the changes I suggest. TBS doesn't care and I don't care about mercs mod. It's just to get people thinking."
ChivalryGame,31k8km,ia_Flame,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:59:14 2015 UTC,Sounds like you think this game should be based on numbers rather than skill. Maybe you're a little sore about ganging up on a guy and getting humiliated when he beats you and your friend at the same time?

ChivalryGame,31hxw6,removeremovers,2,Sun Apr 5 12:16:53 2015 UTC,Bastard swods existed back then and where used by both Scottish highland tribes and a few Germanic tribes. So they would be fun to include.
ChivalryGame,31hxw6,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Sun Apr 5 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"It'd be a cool concept but you would also miss out on some of the diversity of MW. To be historically accurate, there would be a lot of weapons missing and phalanxes don't sound too appealing to me. I just wanna lmb through people. It would make a really good expansion though."
ChivalryGame,31hxw6,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,8,Sun Apr 5 06:20:37 2015 UTC,Phalanxes fell out of favor by 280 BC when Rome came into power. Besides not only where there just as many weapons and different armors but the whole Phalanx argument just doesn't work. In real life during the medieval period (which in Chivalry is around the year 1200 looking at the armor) complex formations and drill where already commonplace yet we don't see that in Chivalry.
ChivalryGame,31hxw6,CRUSHED1337,-2,Sun Apr 5 06:52:55 2015 UTC,"Yet in Medieval Warfare dueling was valued and drilled upon much more than in Roman times. Most battles consisted of large shield walls and massed soldiers pushing against eachother, not really dueling since most battles were in formation and fencing and swordsmanship weren't really used. However in medieval times, duels were very commonplace and there were many small skirmishes and more value on solo skill. Chivalry is a game based around duels and small skirmishes, not large team battles."
ChivalryGame,31hxw6,Reithur,7,Sun Apr 5 08:40:28 2015 UTC,"That's pure romanticizing. Okay lets look at the battle of Hastings in 1066 first. We had formations or English soldiers taking on formations of Norman infantry with large groups of English longbow men and Norman Crossbowmen firing by ranks into the battlefield. Each side had their Generals that where both trying to combat eachother and the English even used a hill to get an unfair advantage.  Next: Battle of Acre 1291. In this battle we see Templar infantry using tight formations to hold off a massive organized assault of Muslims. With such large amounts of people on both sides formational fighting is a must. The Templars where known as an elite fighting force that utilized heavy armor and great organization.  Battle of Grunwald 1410: Polish-Lithuanion cavalry formations engage the Teutonic order and win a decisive victory in one of the largest battles of the medieval ages. Polish cavalry formations charged into the ranks of Teutonic knights which separated them and allowed Polish-Lithuanian infantry to move in and win with few casualties. This spelt the end of the Teutonic order and the rise of the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth which would remain powerful until the 18th century.  In the words of Christine de Pizan, a man who actually lived in Medieval times and studied warfare ""Two great evils .... can follow from a disordered formation: one is that enemies can easily break into it; the other is that the formations may be so compressed that they cannot fight. Thus it is important to keep the formation in ranks and tight and joined together like a wall""  Philippe Contamine, a prominent medieval historian born in 1932 noted 3 common formations used in the Medieval ages. ""The wall"" ""The circle"" and ""Deep formations"". He was a member of the Royal Historical Society and seeing as this man noted formations existing in Medieval times your idea that the Romans where more organized in 280 BC is laughable.   Lastly. Rome fell in 1453 A.D. and with that being said they where around well into the Medieval period to use formational tactics.   All said and done the only reason we don't see formations in Chivalry is formations require a commander, drill, and cooperation to do. Since formations don't happen in Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is see no reason why formations would have to happen in a hypothetical Chivalry: Roman Warfare."

Yeah, I felt the exact same; Skyrim's nature as a simple, spam-LMB hack and slash really comes to light once you get a taste of stabs, directional attacks, parried, and so on.  If you're playing on PC, my advice is to experiment with some combat mods. My personal favorite is Deadly Combat, combined with TK Hitstop, and possibly TK Dodge. All excellent mods, which make combat much quicker and encourage you to mix it up with blocks, footwork, and power attacks. I can't link any with ease on mobile, my apologies, brother.

Eg make the classes selection (van, MaA, knight, etc) a starting point only giving you base stats, and from then on you can throw points into health, speed, stamina, etc.  Buy weapons that are faster and do higher damage, armour that offers better protection.

ChivalryGame,31gd52,Reithur,4,Sun Apr 5 21:10:55 2015 UTC,"CANNOT AGREE ENOUGH!  Haha, I was wondering about posting the same thing.  I know Skyrim is an RPG whereas Chivalry is completely action, but Skyrim just doesn't feel right anymore.  Literally, Chivalry ruined it for me.  When I play Skyrim now I'm watching my footwork, timing my swings, trying to drag, wondering why I can't parry and riposte.  Trying to do alt-overheads.  It just look similar enough to feel like it should respond the same.  I used to love it but just feels wrong now"
ChivalryGame,31gd52,beermatt,4,Sun Apr 5 02:41:02 2015 UTC,I felt this too. Installing new parrying sounds/ animations helped spice up the melee combat for me. If you play on PC you could try things like that.

ChivalryGame,31gd52,KhalifahEmpire,4,Sun Apr 5 06:11:09 2015 UTC,"Overall, I don't really enjoy skyrim that much to be honest, one of the largest reasons is the lack of a good melee combat system. Chivalrys would be a interesting because direction/aim based melee combat hasn't really been done in a RPG before outside of M&B. But really, the elderscrolls series needs to evolve its combat and gameplay. It works well ranged but melee combat just pales in comparison to other ARPG's like the souls series."

I'm a bit worried about playing a game that's similar but with slightly different mechanics as it might confuse the two experiences and compromise my hard earned skills at chivalry lol!  Even still, I love games based upon more historically accurate  themes so I'd have to give it a go.  That's actually one of the things I like about Chivalry, I know it's a pretend plot and setting, but the armour, weapons, sieges, etc are actually quite realistic. At least compared to fantasy based games."
ChivalryGame,31gd52,beermatt,-2,Tue Apr 7 14:56:44 2015 UTC,The Souls series has some of the most clunky combat ever. Someone once told me I'd like its combat if I liked Chivalry. They were wrong. Shit's not even sort of similar.
ChivalryGame,31gd52,Manzanis,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:47:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of people would disagree with that. The souls series has slow combat focused on timing and memorizing enemy patterns. Clunky implies ""bad"" which it definitely is not, but its not for everyone.   The second comment is right though, chivalry and the souls series combat is nothing close to similar. I like both, but the only similarity is the fact they use melee weapons."
ChivalryGame,31gd52,Antrix32,-2,Sun Apr 5 19:20:46 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls combat is nowhere near as fluid as Chivalry. Rolls are nearly useless, parrying has fucked up frames, and the lack of directional attacks makes you get caught on walls all the time when you swing."

I personally recommend Ultimate Combat and Revenge of the Enemies. Between those two and maybe some animation mods, combat feels like it has more weight, stamina management is important, there's locational damage, power attacks and stuns are very useful, and enemies are a little smarter and will sometimes dodge your attack altogether."

I'm just a filthy casual so I don't know off the top of my head what the old values for every weapon in the game are. :\ The mod feels better with every patch though. Dane axe is broken, but I love it (seriously though, aside from the stab it was fine in live now its too good).  Dumb suggestions:  1) Persistent random class choice with no archer  2) MAA with javelins, please it'd be so awesome  3) Gauntlet as weapon choice in duel server for fist2sword duels  Good suggestions:  1) Stat tracking and leaderboards, MMR. This would save you guys from quite a bit of subjective opinion evaluation, because you could look at actual data. Not an end all be all, simply more information to supplement player input.  2) Seriously though, MAAvelins, please.  Thanks for the continued effort, you guys are really pumping out changes."

ChivalryGame,31hn37,BeastlyIguana,2,Sun Apr 5 14:32:37 2015 UTC,Basically the slashes on it are now excellent vs less heavily armed targets and both the slash and the OH just plain do more damage.  As far as hit to kills:  Slash now 1shots archers to torso and 1shots MAA's to the head Overhead 1shots archers to torso.

ChivalryGame,31hn37,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,2,Sun Apr 5 04:21:43 2015 UTC,New claymore stats are disgraceful.  The whole reason it's fast is cause it can't drag for shit
ChivalryGame,31hn37,aStarving0rphan,3,Sun Apr 5 14:15:09 2015 UTC,"They're virtually what the claymore used to be.  Only back then there was no first hit flinch, so they wanted to give it more identity as well as make it a bit more viable by speedin it up and lowering damage values to compensate.  Now that it flinches, it's been expressed claymore is too fast.  We're seeing if this 1.85 claymore is preferable to the previous MERCS claymores.  Use it in scrims and let us know what ya think please :)  I personally feel like claymore's feint strength, riposte speeds, and flinchability in general as well as its strength against 3 of the 4 classes makes it still a viable choice.  Hell, there might be some damage synergies as well as the fact it can now 3 shot knights with 2 stabs... I think it might be in a better place now.  Still, only time and testing will tell."

In addition to that, if you parry within 90ms of the swing hitting you, your parry won't work and you'll get hit anyway. As for how you can simulate that... sorry, I don't know."

The unreal engine is a pretty remarkable piece of tech that roughly attempts to mold to your PC. My guess is that you're probably playing with settings that are way too high and this is the engine or DX moving memory around to accommodate but it could easily be audio or some other hardware limited resource.

ChivalryGame,31g58t,Reithur,2,Sat Apr 4 19:43:16 2015 UTC,Citadel and coldfront are pretty bad for fps. The swampy part of belmez is also bad :(  Many maps aren't optimized.
ChivalryGame,31g18t,Manzanis,3,Sat Apr 4 19:06:54 2015 UTC,You suck at asking questions. You probably also suck at aiming your parries and keep getting hit.
ChivalryGame,31g18t,philihp,3,Sat Apr 4 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"Try to aim for the tip of your opponent's weapon. If you just block without aiming then you will get hit. Also, all high ranks will be good at getting around your parry, so don't get frustrated if they are. Just keep practicing and you'll get it"

ChivalryGame,31brao,sharknice,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're totally right. I generally have always adhered to that rule. Low sens. high DPI. However I grew really comfortable with 1000 DPI and 30 sens. in Chivalry and I generally believe if something isn't broke, don't fix it (I think my mouse max's at 2,500 DPI though). In the end, it's whatever works best for you- even if it's not the optimal setting. If I wanted to, I could just go up to 2,000 DPI and lower my sens. to 15, I believe it would be the same thing as far as feel."

ChivalryGame,31brao,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Sun Apr 12 21:48:15 2015 UTC,450 dpi with 22 sensitivity   There is turnspeed lock while attacking so a higher sensitivity isn't any better at dragging or accelerating since everyone performs those actions at the same speed due to the way the game works.  Lower sensitivity is better for accuracy and control so that micro movements don't completely throw off your aim. Also i've gotten used to low dpi from playing shooters
ChivalryGame,31brao,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Fri Apr 3 19:50:58 2015 UTC,I've thought about this often when searching for more control using slow weapons. My flow between attacks improved dramatically when I changed my sensitivity from 30 to 50. I found more flexibility at 50 by far. Even though there are max speed limits on an attack's force/drag input you can still gain advantage on how quickly you can accel/decel when the movement is available. Mauldini and his silly moves were born that day..

ChivalryGame,3162n8,Peasant420,9,Thu Apr 2 07:22:32 2015 UTC,"The balance council doesn't have the ability to just throw in extra animations. We are doing the best we can with what we have to balance and polish the game to make it more predictable and therefore more skill based. Slow weapons are still viable and are getting some damage alterations to justify their speed drawback. You just can't trade with them all the time now as before. If you time your strikes right you can trade but no more blatant maul spinning and non stop stamina warfare where you are too scared to attack and only parry because of trades. The maul and other similarly handled weapons must actually think when they attack.  As for the man at arms, they are being updated at the moment to adjust for the wind up nerf through an adjustment of their dodge state capabilities and slight modifications to primary weapon damages.  As for the stamina issue that you seem adamant about and your inherent distaste with pole arms, I can only say that polearms are now actually viable instead of the game being just chivalry sword warfare. The handle hits' slight extension (which is less extreme as the original handle hit set for polearms that was patched out a long time ago) creates more variety in weapon choice. Before, using weapons like the halberd or polehammer was pretty disadvantageous with how slow the halberd was especially. With first hit flinch it was even more useless as it had no speed to protect from trades nor power to justify that same disadvantage. So, the handle hits are a nice compromise that give it one attack for flinching that also makes lmb and overheads more consistent on it and less likely to phase through people as it always used to do. The knock back on polearms are a must as they are the only real protection against the general meta of face hugging where polearms have less of an advantage in duels and team fights. As for the stamina drain, you must be only referring to duels which isn't great for weapon balance. You should guide your judgement from team play where the stamina drain is a mere nuisance and where the halberd can be countered quite easily by a variety of weapons and feinting.   Overall I simply believe you are a bit uninformed or at least biased from what I presume to be duels where weapon balance is not properly highlighted as there are clear dueling weapon picks for larger margins of success.  I would also like to reiterate that mercs is not finished and still in the works with some cool features to come. We're doing our best with what we have. My advice is to wait a little longer before deciding for or against the mod."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,ia_Flame,3,Thu Apr 2 15:38:35 2015 UTC,"""The maul and other similarly handled weapons must actually think when they attack."" So slow weapon users have to think, but any weapon with speed or range does not. Mauls used to win with trades and gambles, now its pole-arms and spam weapons.  Pole weapons in live and mercs have always been able to benefit from, if nothing else, bullshit animations. I get that you want to make more weapons viable, but taking the weapon group with the worst animations in the game and giving them extra speed/hit boxes is not balance, at least not unless you have the ability to fix the animations which as you've said, you do not.  Longer ranged weapons should be played at longer range, and if someone gets in your face it SHOULD be difficult to get them away, otherwise you're only making high range/knock-back weapons BETTER than other weapons, rather than equal to other weapons. You said I seem to be biased from duels, but if that is so, then your claims on the necessity of big knock backs must also be duel biased, as I've never found the face-hugging meta to take away from the effectiveness of reach weapons in teamfights (because it doesn't).  I'm not deciding against the mod, but with no transparency as far as how these decisions are made, its very hard to take this seriously. Who is suggesting all of these changes? I think it is important to know, because while I can hop on reddit and be downvoted to shit for having a bias, at least I am here claiming ownership of my bias. Anyone on the ""balance council"" can suggest changes without the community knowing who suggested what, and without opening themselves up to criticism or having to acknowledge their own (perhaps self-serving) biases.  I like this game, and I like that other enthusiastic people are working on improving it. Why the secrecy though? Make a forum, post your council recordings or something, I just want to know whats happening and where everyone on the council stands."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,6,Thu Apr 2 18:50:24 2015 UTC,"Lets not pretend polearms are spam weapons, because they are not. They're slow as fuck and terrible in vanilla with ghost swings and what not, and now they are actually a bit more viable. They have half of their handle tracers now which makes it not hit with the handle of the weapon unlike swords, so the swords will STILL hit faster, not even mentioning weapon windup times. Have you seen windup times on sow, messer, or even Longsword? Most weapons are considerably faster than the polearm weapons, especially the swords. For example, the Billhook is easily the fastest polearm, yet its overhead and lmb windup times are .55. The Longsword in comparison? Much quicker. Hell, even the messer has comparable speed. Compare it to the halberd with its .6 oh and lmb windups and .725 stab it's a lot slower. You can literally wait for them to windup and look down overhead them on reaction and interrupt combos quite easily. This is not even mentioning how all of those weapons I mentioned so easily 2 shot vanguards and have a large health advantage over them. You act like just because Mercs has made more weapons viable with handle hits. Polearms and blunt weapons are actually almost on par with swords now!! Oh no! Good thing Mercs 1.8 is out and knight sword weps are nerfed."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,Stael,2,Thu Apr 2 19:33:45 2015 UTC,"I didn't call pole arms spam weapons, which is why I used the word ""and"". I'm talking about knives, short sword, 1h ls, holy water, etc. Sorry you typed all that out..."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,4,Thu Apr 2 20:13:53 2015 UTC,"fast weapons have always been strong in a gimmick type of way, but only in duels. in any team play you just can't play like that"

You might need to start accepting that kiddo fanbois playing developer is beginning to be a joke. Mercs mod is more aptly titled, ""Mercs: We're using Chivalry code to play a whole other game"". By all means, continue working on the mod, though. I'm loving the spectacle of a slow motion train wreck."

ChivalryGame,3162n8,Kesby,4,Fri Apr 3 04:49:04 2015 UTC,"You are being purposefully blunt which is silly because it shoild be pretty clear how much better mercs is than live. Its pretty much unanimous at this point.  Trades with a maul or messer was near 100% hated by the entire chiv community because it blatently broke the idea of initiative and lead most team encounters to become a cluster fuck.  The handle hit on the poles is HALF of what it was pre handle hit patch which makes them strong again but not op. The weapons stam drain values now come into play and the ability to actually hit people again without phasing through them im sure is very much enjoyed by the hal mains.  Once the maa changes go through the next thing will be the tick system, clashing, and then the nerfing of reverse overheads. Things that will make chivalry more skill based rather than who can spam sow stabs faster."

ChivalryGame,3162n8,Kesby,5,Thu Apr 2 17:03:13 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your feedback.   Can we get some more info on Mercs update release dates?   Soon™, we don't normally have specific dates for build releases as a lot can change and we need to be sure we're satisfied with the changes. It's tough to pinpoint a date.   Potential map changes which could help balance?   This is planned for after class/weapon/mechanic balance.   Can we have even a tiny bit more transparency as far as what the ""balance"" council is contemplating, because so far the intended nerfs have been ineffective and not significantly altered anyone's playstyle, including the cavemen.   Please keep in mind that the balance decisions are not final, any concerns regarding balance decisions can be brought up either in a private message (if you don't want to be flamed) or on here/the official forum post.   Is there anywhere we can give feedback other than shitposting on reddit?   See above.  If you have any other questions, feel free to contact me."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,5,Fri Apr 3 00:06:49 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with your first point, because i can use a grandmace/poleaxe/polehammer/bardiche and it works fine, try me m8  Your second point i would also disagree with, 1v1 me and say stamina is negligible. I will also punish you for misses because im not risking a trade from a late combo, so actually merc mod is better than vanilla in this regard  Your 3rd point comes from your inability to block backswings, i think. Try playing vs more spinners and blocking them  Your 4th point i would also disagree with, i've seen my own clan mates playing MAA on mercs finish the game with top frags. Maa isn't underpowered, flinch in release makes the class 10x better  Your 5th point; animations that i used to cry about i just learnt to deal with from experience  Your 6th point, just no, basically.  Your 7th point however, i would actually agree with this. Kicks are rather broken"
ChivalryGame,3162n8,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,4,Thu Apr 2 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"Anymore who says MAA is awful is just lying to themselves. I don't even play MAA but I don't find it too difficult to land top on the team in games I've played. You can't run into the battle and be like a knight, you have to isolate people and harass them with firepots and what not. Sure, MAA might be the harder class but if you play with half a brain it really isn't that hard and you shouldn't be losing very many duels. And considering the MAA weapons buff that's going to be in 1.8 buffs nearly every weapon, they are gonna be pretty good and more weapons will be viable as well."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,Kesby,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:28:03 2015 UTC,"Try playing MAA vs a stack, or even a slight disadvantage, and your perspective might change."

ChivalryGame,3162n8,Stael,2,Thu Apr 2 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"Do you consider any of those weapons slow with handle hits, or lacking range?  Sure man, lets duel. Uh, no. My third point comes from the fact that reverses and some stabs still hit faster than almost any attack, meaning you can reverse without worrying about getting traded or hit, the only limiter being your ability to parry a riposte and not panic which is... not hard. If one or two good players can top score with MAA, this doesn't mean the class is as good, only that the players are skilled. Also, you can't judge a MAA performance without also looking at his allied knights/vanguards, and I'd be willing to bet stacked teams play a big role in the efficacy of any MAA. I don't believe you, having seen you panic parry and misread feints in several duel videos. Check your ego. Just yes basically. You can't argue that stamina is important and then immediately turn around and claim that Halberd's stam drain is even remotely fair, mercs or live."

ChivalryGame,3162n8,Stael,1 point,Fri Apr 3 06:35:37 2015 UTC,"those weapons actually got stronger in mercs because the biggest downside to using them is that they all feel ""floaty"" on live, that is, they can't maintain momentum for shit kekekekekekek idk man if you parry an attack and then hesitate for long enough to let the enemy attack again, before you can flinch him, you just misplayed. don't need to reverse to do that he's probably talking about scrims, though they must have been facing some deep teams or their maa just happened to be on fire that day. i still think maa is underpowered because it's so easily countered by a good spear vanguard or similar you know, it's not like good players only get better at defence, and if two people of similar skill face each other then their defensive and offensive skills will sort of like, even out? halberd stam drain is retarded in duels lol, but it feels fine in TO"
ChivalryGame,3162n8,Stael,3,Thu Apr 2 21:48:59 2015 UTC,"idk what to say, this post just reeks of bad. i really don't understand how some people can keep convincing themselves that they are the last voice of reason left in the world, with unparalleled insight into the current state of affairs. if better players than you tell you it's better than live, then it probably is. like honestly just ask 'is this a problem at all or am i just bad' instead of saying 'this is a problem and if you don't agree you're just a shitposter'  FHF reduces amount of trades significantly because if you actually want to force a trade, you're going to have to make it obvious.  the slow weapons vs fast weapons balance concern doesn't really matter because you're balancing from a duel standpoint. weapon speed nerfs help with feint readability   There is no advantage to playing MAA in TO when every class can one shot you, out stam you, out dps you, and chase you down.   if you think maa is underpowered for these reasons then you're playing maa like a knight or vanguard. see this. maa is underpowered because it lost a lot of it's manoeuvrability in TO, and the broadsword nerf probably also had something to do with it idk read that other thread or something  they can only change timings on animations, or even swap animation presets. for instance, it would be possible to have a maul with longsword animations. as far as i know it's not possible to change the actual animations (or they just haven't figured out how to do it well yet)  halberd was really, really fucking strong in duels pre-handlehit nerf and the reintroduction of some of these handlehits obviously made it stronger again. still, this is true mostly for duels, and pre-handlehit nerf halberd was still on-par with spear and zweihander, and not actually overpowered in TO. first hit flinch has however significantly buffed vanguard in TO, as it makes it easier for vanguards to keep enemies locked in flinch, and i've heard people say that pole weapons especially are semi-overpowered, so it might be that poles need a nerf of sorts  kicks are only a problem in duel and it's the same on live  writing this on phone no time for grammar"
ChivalryGame,3162n8,bi11y10,7,Thu Apr 2 09:51:25 2015 UTC,"Idk he's not that off on some things. M star and 1h ls have stupid stab ripostes that you don't even see with 50 ping lol. Halberd is pretty retarded even if it's not that op compared to other van weapons, but the only reason you can say that is because van is just the best of the 3 melee classes in mercs. Van just needs some big knockback nerfs right now, I think the class will be more in line then. And yeah, pole weapons in general lol. Billhook and spear are fucking retarded. Aaaaand kicks are pretty silly in duels. I mean, you can always just jump and overhead if you know some guy is just gonna kick you to gain initiative back ezpz and drain your stam to boot but they're still kinda silly. But he's wrong on fhf in general being a bad idea. That part of the mod is great, and I'm not worried about the mod not being great since they're still working on it and everyone is aware of all the retarded but fixable problems. My post probably looks like a mess but I'm not gonna edit it lol."

ChivalryGame,3162n8,bi11y10,3,Thu Apr 2 12:36:28 2015 UTC,"You're extremely hostile for having agreed with me for over half your post, lol.  FHF: There are less trades, only because faster and longer weapons can be spammed to interrupt. This may have reduced trades, but cave manning is just as common as before.  Duel VS TO: Yeah, I was speaking almost entirely from a duel perspective, however the balance in duels is similar to the balance in TO. Not analogous, only similar.  MAA Under powered: Yeah. It doesn't help that there are maybe 5 viable weapons, if that.  I have nothing else to say because you started agreeing with me at that point."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,sesstreets,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:10:13 2015 UTC,"i'm always toxic, doesn't matter  FHF makes it more rewarding to play weapons that don't have strong control. On live, weapons like SoW/Messer dominate because they are so insanely good at controlling the opponent, but in mercs, due to FHF, you can actually play weapons like Halberd, Spear and Poleaxe without getting yolotraded by SoW/Messer knights 24/7.  Overall FHF makes it easier to maintain control for the player who has earned that control. If you take a hit in live in some matchups, you can cheese your way to a trade way too often. On mercs, this doesn't happen because the player who flinched you is able to maintain that control. This is why FHF is so great  Duels are incredibly unbalanced and extremely different from TO. In duels you don't get punished for tunnel visioning, positioning doesn't exist, and range only means that the opponent sometimes has to parry twice before he gets in range (still matters but not in the same way). In duels some setups that are good in TO are completely non-existant, and vice versa. You don't see shields in TO, ever. Similarly, there are no Poleaxe users in duel.  In TO stam drain doesn't really matter either, because it's really obvious and easy to avoid. Same goes for kicks; it's really risky because you can easily get swapped to if you do it.  MAA is underpowered, but this is pretty much common knowledge and it's going to be addressed soon. The only real, viable setups are broad (or norse but it's the same thing really) and morning star"
ChivalryGame,3162n8,bi11y10,2,Thu Apr 2 20:41:23 2015 UTC,"FHF reduces amount of trades significantly because if you actually want to force a trade, you're going to have to make it obvious.   While you are correct in saying it reduces the amount of trades, it raises the amount of gambling in duels and TO scrims. Because you are going to get flinched if you dont hit first, it acts as an incentive for you to really want to get your hit off first.   As an example: Spear LMB gambles pay off so well its ridiculous, the spear lmb takes 5(4?) hits to kill a knight right now. Thats pretty bad but it doesnt matter because they cant get a swing off cause every time they go to windup, I smack them in the face with a spear. I should not be able to do that.  Also dragging is now significantly worse, considering as soon as someone recognizes a drag they are going to get lookdowned. There isnt much that can be done about this problem because of the nature of the FHF system."

Im not saying all people do is gamble every duel, but it pays off way more than it should due to FHF."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,sesstreets,0,Thu Apr 2 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"Dont feint when you would usually feint, first step to become less predictable and will get you freehits against all those gamblers  its not that hard seriously.. also the gambles you are talking about arent affected by FHF, if someone feints in live and gets gambled, the gambler will flinch him aswell  now people reading feints and then attacking to punish? thats not gambling, thats just you getting outplayed. People instantly starting attacks after getting parried? thats gambling yes, but its very very easy to beat and not a problem in my eyes, at all"
ChivalryGame,3162n8,bi11y10,4,Thu Apr 2 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"Im not talking about being predictable. I agree with you in saying that predictability and people reading your feints can lead to you being punished with a lookdown or accelerated attack.   But that is entirely different than a gamble. Im talking about people deciding to swing at random times  hoping their opponent is going to feint or drag them, these random swings are not planned and are basically ""fuck it, I'll lmb real quick right now"" moments. These swings cause an inherent problem because people are being rewarded with a flinch on their opponent by swinging randomly. Yes, even good players do this.   And yes, the gambles I am talking about are affected by FHF because, say I decide to drag somebody and they decide to gamble me at the same time I start my swing. In live I would probably still get my attack off and trade the attack. In Mercs there is a significantly less likely chance that I trade them. Now there is no real solution to this problem that I can think of without removing FHF, which I am against. Maybe this is something the balance council can discuss further."

ChivalryGame,3162n8,bi11y10,-1,Thu Apr 2 20:42:48 2015 UTC,/me is super chill  The point of mercs is to eventually add things like clashing and the bounce off mechanic so that gambling is almost impossible.
ChivalryGame,3162n8,bi11y10,3,Thu Apr 2 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"Alright, well the bounce off mechanism would never work as intended and I have already discussed that with Spook in a previous post.   As for the clashing mechanism, I'm not entirely sure it could be implemented the way you guys want it to be, but thats entirely up to the competence of the modder at that point.   It is my opinion that the balance council should focus on balance first and testing new mechanics later when the game is sorted out. Because as it stands, many people agree 1.7 is the worst version thus far."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,bi11y10,-1,Thu Apr 2 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"Could you explain why bounce off won't work with ticks?  Ticks.  What are the main gripes with 1.7? Also, 1.8 LITERALLY just released."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,Reithur,2,Thu Apr 2 18:30:56 2015 UTC,"In the way that the bounce of mechanism was explained in the post by Spook, hitting someone in the first two ticks would result in a cancelled swing(he explained it like hitting a wall).   Not only does this make absolutely no sense whatsoever, it will result in like half of accelerated attacks being cancelled. Tempest accelerates attacks all the time, they are some of the best at it. Surely many of their attacks would be cancelled, is that really what they want the game to be like?  Also wasnt 1.8 supposed to be out like last Sunday? The gripes I was hearing about were the lack of knight/van balances while most other classes were getting changes for the worst. Most people (not me) hate mercs because it essentially makes the game Knight/Van Warfare and disreagards the other classes."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,Koiuki,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:40:52 2015 UTC,"I think that it deserves a chance to be considered if it is possible since ser jon's video shows that even if you're ready for the maul revoh you can still get hit in parry release which imo fundamentally breaks the game, and honestly it should be but again it comes down, as you said, to the skill of maceman.  MAA and archer both got lots of attention in 1.8 since archers do slightly more damage, xbows kill maa better, and most if not all of the maa primaries now are useful. I would consider this all 4 classes getting attention.  As much as it pains me to say this, vans and knights make more of a difference in TO as of right now but we shall see during the 1.8 test scrims how it works out with maa being that much stronger."
ChivalryGame,3162n8,Brandon2828,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:18:18 2015 UTC,"I am thankful for the changes, but I think the council may have looked past one of the problems with MaAs, but atleast from what Keyes and I have noticed is that it is really easy to flinch a MaA. It should be the other way around, MaA should flinch everyone else.   You buffed their damage and dodges/movement speed if I am correct, but this doesnt do much if their still getting flinched by Van swords, which is what happens usually when I go to trade with Keyes."

ChivalryGame,3162n8,sesstreets,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:20:09 2015 UTC,"There are two more major releases for Mercs. More changes are being made to vanguards and MAA, with tweaks for weapons as well.  Knights and vanguards top the board because that's what most of the long time players prefer to play. There are some good MAAs out there who can top the boards,  either in Mercs or normal modes, but not many because the squishy health of MAA tends to drive players to use knight or vanguard.   I wouldn't call MAA weak, just not as forgiving as knight."

The mod was made with one purpose in mind and that was to re implement mechanical abuses that allowed players who had invested a great number of hours to destroy new players. This is coming from a guy who has logged over 700 hours on chivalry, I will always remember the patch they got rid of look down overhead and facehugging mechanics."

ChivalryGame,30ym5w,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:48:30 2015 UTC,How many players were in the server? Who were they? What server was it?
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,JUSTICEvvBEAVER,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:16:05 2015 UTC,It said official mod server East or West. and rather full.
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,Reithur,1 point,Tue Mar 31 19:47:25 2015 UTC,And who were the guys allegedly tking you?
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,cienade,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:26:28 2015 UTC,I was TKd once and then kicked.   The name of the archer was Bobby Digital. I did not catch the name of the TKer.  I was accused by said Archer that the only reason that I proposed the kick on his idle firing archer in base was to be the archer myself. This dialog was what sparked the mob mentality that got me kicked.  He in no way moved from his spawn (except firing at the wall) until I initiated a kick on him the SECOND match he was doing this.
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,Feelguk,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:28:45 2015 UTC,This info can make a big difference; random players trolling people on a server is very different from a server full of clannies who want to duel and are following the duelling rules.
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,Feelguk,-1,Tue Mar 31 21:21:16 2015 UTC,"Hi Fox Tango, I was in the server with you the other day when this happened.  Bobby Digital was a rank 44 archer and he was one of the better ones I've seen lately. Everyone was consistently bitching in chat about...stuff, because competetive players like to bitch.  This was on Kingsgarden right? Firstly, everyone remembered you when you started the vote because at one point you said ""So all I see different in this mod is salty chat"" or something like that. This did not make you friends  Then you tried to kick a relatively high rank archer who, despite his afkness, had been playing well previous to that. This did not make you friends.  A thirdly, when the kick WAS started on you, everyone looked at Bobby's rank, then at yours, and that basically decided it.  This game is rank racist.  So to answers your question,  Yes, really.  The competetive community apologies and wishes you luck in your future endeavours."
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,Feelguk,4,Tue Mar 31 19:51:19 2015 UTC,"So its okay for Bobby to tie up a 1 slot server by afk wall shooting? Just how it is? no thanks. Enjoy playing with people like that, I for one will not."
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,cutecatgirl,-6,Wed Apr 1 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's okay for me to tie up a slot on a server that's not even full because I need to AFK for 5-10 minutes and don't think its necessary to leave the server for it. I still contributed more to the team.  The mistake was kicking you after for trying to kick me, I honestly didn't expect it to pass and I apologize for that.  Edit: My friends didnt try to kick you..I did it myself.."
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,twoLegsJimmy,4,Wed Apr 1 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"Out right lie. You were afk the entire match previous and started the new match doing the same thing, only moving EXACTLY when I initiated a vote on you.  You initiated the kick, your friend TK'd me."
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,maul_exe,-5,Thu Apr 2 01:21:55 2015 UTC,"You can exaggerate how long I was AFK..you can even call me toxic! But the underlying truth is that you were kicked for being a whining bitch and the rest of the server clearly wasn't interested in playing with someone so negative.  I didn't round up my boys to gang up on you and get a vote kick passed, I kicked you for trying to kick me without good reason and over 70% of the server agreed with me.  Don't bash a successful mod or the people in it just because they'd rather play then listen to your complaints. This post is a great example.. You got kicked from a server and had to make a post about the toxicity of the community? .......  -____-   I don't have enough clout to kick someone with 0% team damage and a good ping.. Did some people vote no for me because I'm good? Yeah. But they made up their own minds when they voted yes for you."
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,twoLegsJimmy,6,Thu Apr 2 02:16:10 2015 UTC,Ha.  Play it cool all you want.  You were gone for that long and any comments i made were jokes directed at chat of which people laughed understanding that the contents of chat were filed with bitching from vet players of the mod .  You not only called for my vote but then lied in game saying that i was idle and only kicking you to steal the archer slot.   You are a liar and not someone i would ever want to game with.
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,maul_exe,-6,Thu Apr 2 19:28:22 2015 UTC,"Ha, I gave no reason for voting you out..mostly because I didn't need one. I wasn't the only one that wanted you gone.   I'm not worried about playing with you again.. not that I wouldn't, I would.. but I expect you'll play for another week or two before you come across someone worse than me, and based off your reaction here..you'll rage quit, uninstall, and never play again because the ""toxic community"" ruined it for you. Tragic."
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,twoLegsJimmy,5,Thu Apr 2 20:07:57 2015 UTC,Behold the liar.
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,sesstreets,-6,Thu Apr 2 20:47:33 2015 UTC,So entitled. That archer is doing a great job: stopping people like you who default to archer every. single. time.   Go play a normal class.
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,twoLegsJimmy,0,Thu Apr 2 23:39:11 2015 UTC,Upvoted. Fuck archers. I bet you killjoy fuckwits throw darts at people playing chess in the park.  The game is better without you.
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,sesstreets,0,Wed Apr 1 04:17:57 2015 UTC,"See its people like you who make the chiv community toxic. Yes must I remind people YET AGAIN that archers EXISTED in medieval times as well, and it also EXISTS in chivalry for a reason. You honestly have no clue how much support a good archer does for a team in TO for the rest of the team. Yeah, it sucks getting killed by an archer when you're dueling another player, but tough shit, suck it up it happens. Just don't get so salty over it and enjoy the game."
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,twoLegsJimmy,4,Wed Apr 1 14:32:04 2015 UTC,It'd be easier to enjoy if you stopped playing.
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,sesstreets,-2,Wed Apr 1 15:10:02 2015 UTC,Dare I ask how many hours you have in this game?
ChivalryGame,30ym5w,twoLegsJimmy,3,Wed Apr 1 15:15:24 2015 UTC,"~ 2300  You?  I have no problem with archers existing in the game, but their current state makes them anti-fun for everyone else. Archers were a thing in medieval times, but they weren't the supermen they are in chivalry. They should at least be easy to punish if they let you get close. 'Fucking archers' is the most common thing you here in a team objective game, and they're so unbalanced they're the only class that's had an artificial limit put on their use."

ChivalryGame,30wj5n,mobinstime,5,Tue Mar 31 07:36:34 2015 UTC,"When you do it standing up you want to strafe to the opposite direction of the drag to ensure that you don't overdrag it.  That way you can have slightly more control over the overhead since the footwork becomes part of the drag and doesn't account for mousecap, so you can use your extra mouse movement to keep your attack in check while the enemy is trying to dodge it.   I myself still prefer crouching, though"
ChivalryGame,30wj5n,MajorGrempington,1 point,Tue Mar 31 09:58:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I will try this."
ChivalryGame,30wj5n,Messybear,2,Tue Mar 31 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"Ive always done them while crouching. It's just personal preference, whatever works best for you, it helps me if I crouch just because I move slower and feel like I have more control."
ChivalryGame,30wj5n,Clayton-BigsB,2,Tue Mar 31 08:03:12 2015 UTC,"what is a footdrag? I do drags while standing and not crouching. If you crouch while dragging, you're going to hit sooner than you normally would which kind of defeats the purpose."
ChivalryGame,30wj5n,Nohlium,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:38:35 2015 UTC,You hit the foot with an overhead drag. By crouching he probably mean crouch at the last second to aim at the foot. If you don't crouch you need to visualize where the foot is. A little harder to do I guess.
ChivalryGame,30wj5n,Clayton-BigsB,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:49:46 2015 UTC,"in that case i stay standing the entire time too, just at the last point of release drag my mouse back down a bit and curl."
ChivalryGame,30wj5n,Nohlium,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:58:50 2015 UTC,Crouching in a duel should only be done when your on the defensive IMO. The maneuverability cost is just too great. Doing it while standing up is harder but it should be your long term goal.
ChivalryGame,30wj5n,Xylvion,1 point,Tue Mar 31 10:56:51 2015 UTC,"I do footdrags while standing. They're easier to land if you, right when release is about to start, drag to the side of a person as it looks similar to a regular attack which makes them harder to parry. I only crouch if I really have to keep the drag ""alive"" for a longer period of time, usually to get head or torso hits, or while using 1handers.  I guess a mix of both is the best way to go, sometimes your opponent is further away and you'll miss if you crouch, but if you stand up you can easily reach them with some footwork."
ChivalryGame,30wj5n,bi11y10,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:43:13 2015 UTC,"I never crouch while dragging, it puts you closer to the ground so therefore your attack will hit sooner (assuming it is an overhead).  I also never go for footdrags, they can definitely be effective and all but I'd rather go for the shoulder or chest and get the extra damage than go for a footdrag which, depending on your skill level, can be easier/harder to do."
ChivalryGame,30wj5n,BioshockEndingD00D,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:04:37 2015 UTC,"Stand. Crouching will just make you miss if they backpedal. The important part is that you don't make the delay obvious; ya know, looking straight up at the sky before winding up an overhead. Begin your overhead like any other lookdown and then drag your swing to the upper left."

Yes, it has issues, yes, they will never be fixed. But, the communities for both 360 and PS3 are thriving well enough to find a server pretty much any time of the day, and are still growing. You can play single player offline, but it does get redundant and boring because you can't play every map/mode, and fighting NPCs doesn't at all teach you what methods are needed for survival in actual pvp combat.  Start off frequenting duel servers and free for all servers, research how to use your classes before you use them vigorously, blah blah blah anything that any other experienced chiv player would tell you. The biggest issue with console is the lag, and honestly, it isn't typically game-breaking enough to make me not want to play."

And still there is mercs mod which brings many changes to the game.  I honestly ignored everything you said after calling things exploits, saying people who use a high fov should be banned,  and saying archers shouldn't be able to shoot at you from behind their teammates.  And what youre suggesting are not legit balance changes."
ChivalryGame,30ttyc,Mestarrr,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:54:39 2015 UTC,"I've never said archers shouldn't be able to shoot you from behind their teammates. I said they should be more vulnerable to people penetrating said teammates lines and going for the archers in melee combat should ALWAYS have the upper hand. Archer should pay for their misses.  But i don't expect you to know that since you said you didn't read anything, so it's ok. This thread gave me a general idea about what the community is like, especially this subreddit that's frequented by higher level, hence fov abusing players."

ChivalryGame,30ttyc,BagOfShenanigans,1 point,Tue Mar 31 08:19:07 2015 UTC,Of course we're not going to respond well to you when you come in with very little knowledge regarding the actual mechanics of the game and start calling things exploits and saying other things arent fair and need to be nerfed.
ChivalryGame,30ttyc,Opportune_Gif,1 point,Tue Mar 31 08:21:06 2015 UTC,"But that's my opinion and how i see things. And i am not the only one, go read a few reviews of the game and the same thing is gonna come up."
ChivalryGame,30ttyc,arenagamer,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:34:55 2015 UTC,"The idea that many parts of the game are considered exploits has been discussed a lot already.  Most veterans are pretty tired of hearing newer players or just players that won't accept the game's meta claiming that things are exploits.  Thats one of the major problems with this game, IMO.  People come in thinking its just a casual slasher where you decapitate your friends but its actually a really competitive game with a steep learning curve.  And then when new players get killed over and over by some guy doing reverse overheads and complicated drags, they get mad and call him a cheater or hacker or whatever and either try to votekick him or post on some forum about how stuff is unrealistic and how its an exploit and needs to be removed.  I'd recommend reading through this recent post to get a better sense of the veterans vs. ""scrubs"" debate thats been going on for a while.  FYI, Feranor used to be pretty active on this sub maybe over a year ago and would always call drags and lookdowns exploits and generally being a dick to everyone."
ChivalryGame,30ttyc,arenagamer,7,Tue Mar 31 12:20:13 2015 UTC,"Wow another expert thread by someone who probably just ranked up to 18.   Not saying you can't have an opinion, I'm just saying that you don't know anything about anything."

ChivalryGame,30ttyc,Anstii,6,Mon Mar 30 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, we understand.   Knights should be able to blindly lmb mash their way through opponents (because you never bothered to try man at arms and learn proper footwork) Archers should have to line up in the middle of the map to be spanked for being naughty (because you never took the time to learn how to use/dodge a bow or learned not to panic parry when the archer pulls out a pen knife) And anyone who dares to progress the meta any further should be banned (because this game doesn't deserve depth if it means you may have to actually learn how to play.)   Is that right? Did I get everything?  This isn't Monty Python: The Game. It's a complex first person slasher with a rich meta, a high learning curve, and a very competitive playerbase. And as far as I can tell, it's pretty much the only game of its kind. There are plenty of casual slashing experiences out there that consist mostly of whipping a pointy thing back and forth until you are the only thing left alive (skyrim, minecraft, mount and blade, dead island, chivalry DW, etc) not all of them are medieval themed, but they are all much closer to the game you're describing.  One of my favorite shooters of all time is Call of Duty: World at War. I can't play it anymore. The 360 and PS3 servers are either empty or full of hackers, and the PC scene is dominated solely by players who insist on some sort of weird meta game where players cannot sprint and must crouch-walk to move. They think these restrictions make the game more fun, but they don't. CoD is not a slow, methodical fps. But instead of buying a more fitting game like Red Orchestra, they coopted my favorite game and ruined it with their shitty rules that were never intended by the developers. I despise what they've done to my favorite shooter with their arbitrary restrictions on how the game can be played and I certainly wouldn't like to see it happen again to my new favorite game.  Archers are shit. They've been nerfed and nerfed again and again. They finally behave like real archers (hiding in the back and shooting as opposed to being MAAs with bows.) If you can't kill them it's a statement of your skill, not them being overpowered.  Learn the meta. Play for 300 hours at the bottom of the scoreboard like everyone else did. Chivalry doesn't respect the no-child-left-behind, everyone-is-a-winner mentality. It's a meritocracy like any competitive game.  TL;DR: git güd."
ChivalryGame,30ttyc,Teocyn,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:52:47 2015 UTC,"Rank 32, 200+ hours on 1 acc, probably around 250 on 2 accounts.  Archers aren't shit, their melee weapons are OP, they shouldn't be.   Meta's are about people changing tactics, changing classes and weapons, not teh settings to give themselves and advantage. And it also isn't a meta when this has been happening since the beginning of Chiv."

ChivalryGame,30qpfr,Reithur,1 point,Mon Mar 30 02:21:26 2015 UTC,Can't see it. It's probably on spam filter again.
