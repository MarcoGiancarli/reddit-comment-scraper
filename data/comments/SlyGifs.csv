SlyGifs,3due96,BluePolitico,11,Mon Jul 20 01:11:44 2015 UTC,That's definitely what happened. Look at his hand when he makes the motion. His fingers are curled. Nobody shakes hands like that.

SlyGifs,3due96,Thorrtun,12,Sun Jul 19 19:35:07 2015 UTC,That's a funny narrative but it looks more like he's motioning for Letterman to sit. His hand travels up too far and he's bending over to sit himself when he makes the gesture.

Actually it's a bit frowned upon since the bottle might very well be dirty and you don't want to end up having all of this in your beer.

SlyGifs,3c4j0t,TheLawlrus,14,Sat Jul 4 19:09:21 2015 UTC,Baseball is full of unwritten rules. It's possible that if the batter didn't move the next pitch would have been at his head.

SlyGifs,3c4j0t,laser-TITS,11,Sat Jul 4 23:38:16 2015 UTC,A guy is trying to move a base closer to home plate. Every time someone crosses home plate it equals a point. So he is trying to move ahead and if the guy who has the ball tags him before he gets to the white square he is out and therefore has no chance of scoring. Make any sense?
SlyGifs,3c4j0t,Notelpats,2,Sun Jul 5 00:10:37 2015 UTC,"Yes it does, thanks !"
SlyGifs,3c4j0t,ihahp,2,Sun Jul 5 07:53:31 2015 UTC,"In baseball, you get someone ""out"" by either tagging the base that they are running too (if they are in a situation where they cannot run backward, like in the instance that someone else is on the previous base) or the runner themselves. The baseman failed to tag the runner out since he was not touching the base and did not touch the player before he reached it."
SlyGifs,3c4j0t,FlyingSandals,2,Sun Jul 5 07:36:32 2015 UTC,you can get a baserunner out by tagging the base only if it's a force (as in they are being force to move up a base due to a basehit)   this play wasn't a force so he had to tag the player for the out.
SlyGifs,3c4j0t,laser-TITS,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:16:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation. Makes sense now.
SlyGifs,3c4j0t,teenytiny212,8,Sun Jul 5 07:53:22 2015 UTC,why did he lift his hand? the guy has to touch the base eventually right?
SlyGifs,3c4j0t,Tezot,10,Sat Jul 4 19:59:52 2015 UTC,Yeah it really was a miss play on the 3rd basemen. He should have just left it there
SlyGifs,3c4j0t,mirrorwolf,3,Sat Jul 4 21:35:16 2015 UTC,"That's old habits from when you could get away with it. Before replay (which wasn't implemented until 2008, and wasn't really fully implemented until last year) the umpire would give the third baseman that call every time, as long as his arm was there in time. Now with replay you have to be sure you actually tagged the runner, but this guy just brought his arm up. Great play by Rizzo and a great call by the ump.  tl;dr He should have kept his arm down, old habits die hard."

SlyGifs,3ak664,RainbowEffingDash,16,Sun Jun 21 00:38:23 2015 UTC,It's not a boneless heel flip either. Is a no comply flip. Also. This was posted in the skateboarding subreddit if you wanted to check it out.  Also. I say not boneless because a boneless involves grabbing the board before stepping off AND generally one foot stays on the whole time. Unless you do a finger flip of sorts before you land. Either way. Clearly not that. :)
SlyGifs,3ak664,Longsocksandsexalots,3,Sun Jun 21 01:34:20 2015 UTC,More like a no comply heelflip indy..
SlyGifs,3ak664,youonlylive9times,6,Sun Jun 21 03:35:18 2015 UTC,You can't call it a heel flip at any point. Flipping that way doesn't make it a heel flip.   Even If he just ollied flat then before hitting the ground he flicked with hid heel it wouldn't be called an Ollie heel flip. It would be an Ollie late heel.    See what I'm saying.

The shooter will start holding the basketball with both hands downward in front of their body with both arms extended. The shooter will then quickly raise the ball, keeping their arms extended, and release the ball before the arms become perpendicular to the body.

SlyGifs,38l7kz,kehlder,2,Fri Jun 5 08:32:36 2015 UTC,It looked like an AR-15 to me. What rifle is it?
SlyGifs,38l7kz,giedow1995,26,Fri Jun 5 08:36:43 2015 UTC,"It was an AR-15. They are not inherently automatic rifles, even though the name has it right there. An automatic rifle fires repeatedly from a single pull of the trigger. This is not legal to buy for the vast majority of citizens, it takes quite a bit of paperwork to legally purchase one. As such, you will not see one for sale in a storefront. No one who's buying one will be window shopping for it. The process is so regulated that most stores don't carry them because even they probably don't have the proper permits. Most AR-15s are single fire, they only fire one bullet per trigger pull."
SlyGifs,38l7kz,kehlder,37,Fri Jun 5 08:51:12 2015 UTC,"The AR in AR-15 doesn't stands for ""automatic rifle"", it stands for Armalite, that company that originally produced the gun."

SlyGifs,38l7kz,u1tralord,4,Fri Jun 5 18:05:25 2015 UTC,"I'd also expect it to fire the bullets at a higher velocity, but hey, what do I know?"

However some things will need to be made slightly different to accommodate how the trigger group functions differently. Everything except the trigger group are obtainable without having to worry about licenses and such. You just have to do your homework.  Getting your hands on a trigger group legally is very time consuming and costly and using one criminally is very stupid. Getting your hands on a stolen one has its own problems, obviously. If you just want one for possible apocalypse scenarios, try and get your hands on it legally. Otherwise don't bother. Full automatic is very inefficient. We're trained to shoot single fire only in the Army.  P.S. Getting one legally will get your name on a list."

SlyGifs,38l7kz,TommiHPunkt,6,Fri Jun 5 09:23:30 2015 UTC,"Oh, so it's a language difference thing. That makes sense.   It's referred to semi auto because the gun does everything ""automatically"", in that it cycles the round and puts another in the chamber for you to shoot. And all you're doing is pulling the trigger again, instead of like in bolt or pump action where you cycle the action and put the next round up."
SlyGifs,38l7kz,cry_wolf23,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:55:53 2015 UTC,Automatic is synonymous with semi-automatic for pistols.

SlyGifs,38l7kz,McDutchy,3,Fri Jun 5 13:12:00 2015 UTC,That looks like an ARmalite-15 aka AR-15 is a semi-automatic rifle. Meaning that you have to pull the trigger each time you want to send a round down range. An automatic will continuously send rounds down range as long as you have the trigger pulled. It doesnt have to be a bolt action to be semi-automatic.
SlyGifs,38l7kz,Roma_Victor,3,Fri Jun 5 09:09:25 2015 UTC,A bolt action isn't even semi auto.
SlyGifs,38l7kz,cry_wolf23,3,Fri Jun 5 09:56:48 2015 UTC,Derp.  I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.
SlyGifs,38l7kz,Roma_Victor,0,Fri Jun 5 10:06:08 2015 UTC,"I know that, but it appears naming is what causes confusion  between us here. Some people make a distinction between automatic and fully automatic. Other don't, and I fit it in that first category. AR-15 could be seen as automatic but not fully automatic, since you do not need to reload a bullet in the chamber to fire again, just pull the trigger again. Edit: And bolt action is not semiautomatic, its bolt action."
SlyGifs,38l7kz,McDutchy,2,Fri Jun 5 10:09:12 2015 UTC,It seems like a language thing. In German (and I'm guessing Dutch too) automatic encompasses both semi and fully automatic guns

His partner then does whatever he needs to, like stuffing a fucking assault rifle into your jeans, and then you're in the clear.

SlyGifs,38b1b2,nekoningen,0,Wed Jun 3 23:38:50 2015 UTC,Don't know man I'm not that easily convinced with visuals. The pen getting clipped to the shirt is was kills this for me. Would I like it to be true? Yes. Do I believe it? Nope. Not falling for this one.
SlyGifs,38b1b2,lun0tic,2,Thu Jun 4 01:11:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know what to say other than you're really bad determining real from fake. If anything, the fact it clipped onto the shirt proves it more likely to be legit than faked. The effort that would be put into manipulating something like that would be more effort than it would be to just actually do it, and giving the physics involved it's more likely to clip than you apparently think.  Try throwing a pen into a cup with a thin edge for awhile, when you get to the point where you can consistently hit the edge as it goes in, see how many times it clips on compared to how many times it doesn't."
SlyGifs,38b1b2,nekoningen,-2,Thu Jun 4 03:34:49 2015 UTC,"Well I COULD say that you are gullible for believing and defending and event caught on camera (on the internet) that you were not a part of but I won't do that. This isn't that hard to manipulate on camera by a skilled individual. The pen clip on the pocket is what makes me question the gif. The clip on the shirt is what convinces you yet, its a billion times harder to pull this off versus the pen simply falling in the shirt. Had it just done exactly that I would believe it."
SlyGifs,38b1b2,lun0tic,2,Thu Jun 4 03:52:57 2015 UTC,"The clip on the shirt is what convinces you yet   I didn't say that, what convinces me is the reaction of the guy when he's expecting to be hit by the pen but isn't. I'm just saying your reasoning is wrong and backwards.   I COULD say that you are gullible for believing and defending and event caught on camera (on the internet) that you were not a part of but I won't do that.   And I could say that you're paranoid for going out of your way to accuse someone of faking a video of a barely impressive and frankly less than unimportant stunt just to make you fall for it, but i'm not going to pretend i didn't say just that.  I'd also like to point out that i'm not defending the video, it could be fake (it probably isn't), but i don't care, I just don't like people who feel they must protect themselves from any possibility of getting ""got"" by someone about trivial matters and decide to call out everyone as fakes as a defense tactic. It irks me."
SlyGifs,38b1b2,nekoningen,-2,Thu Jun 4 04:16:58 2015 UTC,"If anything, the fact it clipped onto the shirt proves it more likely to be legit than faked   Sounds like what convinced you to me.   it could be fake (it probably isn't)   Sounds like I COULD be right. You go with real. I'll stick with fake."
SlyGifs,38b1b2,lun0tic,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:30:01 2015 UTC,"""If anything, the fact it clipped onto the shirt proves it more likely to be legit than faked"" doesn't say anything about how convincing it is, and it on it's own wouldn't be convincing at all. All it says, nothing more nothing less, it that it points more in the direction of being legit than it does in the direction of being fake. And somehow you interpreted it the other way.  And yes, it could be fake. You could be fake. the internet could fake, the moon landing could be fake, my computer could be fake, food could be fake, colour could be fake. I could be a fly person gone mad confined in a padded room in an asylum hallucinating an entire reality.  I'm probably not, but i could be."

Christian missionaries were delivering a gift to a tribe, but it was not safe to deliver it in person, so they flew in a circle and lowered a bucket so it would be somewhat stationary on the ground.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Auca#Initial_contact"
SlyGifs,37l0b6,joeyadams,3,Thu May 28 12:47:10 2015 UTC,"Section 3. Initial contact of article  Operation Auca:       The first stage of Operation Auca began in September 1955. Saint, McCully, Elliot, and fellow missionary Johnny Keenan decided to initiate contact with the Huaorani and began periodically searching for them by air. By the end of the month, they had identified several clearings in the jungle. Meanwhile, Elliot learned several phrases in the language of the Huaorani from Dayuma, a young Huaorani woman who had left her society and become friends with Rachel Saint, a missionary and the sister of Nate Saint. The missionaries hoped that by regularly giving gifts to the Huaorani and attempting to communicate with them in their language, they would be able to win them over as friends.

SlyGifs,36a2bh,SparklingLimeade,5,Mon May 18 11:13:15 2015 UTC,Does the pitcher do that completely on purpose???  He doesn't even looked shocked. Asshole.  Why does my ignorance receive down votes?
SlyGifs,36a2bh,Longsocksandsexalots,39,Sun May 17 18:07:50 2015 UTC,"Usually it's an accident. Pitching inside (i.e., close to the batter) is important and is done intentionally all the time, but actually hitting the guy is rarely on purpose because it doesn't benefit the pitcher's team at all. Also, it's just part of the game, so the pitcher doesn't apologize. Everyone knows it was a mistake, unless it's one of those extremely rare moments where a couple of players are having an intense (and illegal) rivalry. Hitting batters on purpose gets pitchers ejected from games (and sometimes suspended) immediately, as soon as the umpire can determine it was intentional, which is usually after about two batters at most. So, no -- he isn't shocked because it's part of the game, and he did not do it on purpose."
SlyGifs,36a2bh,helpful_hank,22,Sun May 17 20:00:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation.

SlyGifs,36a2bh,NeXuid,16,Sun May 17 20:13:33 2015 UTC,"The batter gets an automatic pass to first base. There are two other bases, second and third, and then the batter returns home (the white plate on the ground in front of where he's standing waiting for the pitch). Once the runner crosses home, his team gets a point, which is called a Run. The team with the most runs wins the game, so pitchers generally want to protect against batters reaching base, so that they can't then get around the bases and back to home to score a run.  In short, when the batter is hit, his team doesn't get a point, but they get a chance at scoring one that they might not otherwise have had, so it's not in the pitcher's interest to hit batters. It reflects badly on him and potentially hurts his team.  edit: You can also see in the gif that the pitcher smacks his glove in frustration after hitting the batter. (This is actually rather unprofessional; a mature pitcher usually doesn't react at all.)"
SlyGifs,36a2bh,helpful_hank,1 point,Sun May 17 20:16:32 2015 UTC,"If I may also ask a question: I really don't know anything about baseball, but I assume the man standing behind the batter and the other player is like a referee, right? Why does he have that reaction? Was he concerned that the batter might be injured or is it something else? I know this is super ignorant but there have been a lot of baseball related gifs on Reddit today and now I'm curious."
SlyGifs,36a2bh,hydrapower,8,Mon May 18 00:10:04 2015 UTC,That's the umpire.  He was worried that the batter would charge the mound (start a fight) and was running alongside the guy who got hit to make sure that didn't happen.
SlyGifs,36a2bh,wickedfarts,2,Mon May 18 00:28:47 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. Thanks so much!"
SlyGifs,36a2bh,hydrapower,8,Mon May 18 00:32:51 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's no problem and feel free to ask me a baseball question anytime. Just mention /u/helpful_hank and I'll get an alert.  Yes, the guy behind the batter and the catcher is the umpire, who is like a referee. Usually they don't react that much to batters being hit by pitches because it's pretty common. He must have been concerned about the batter's well-being -- that's the best guess I can make for the tiny context the gif provides. He's also not making any umpire-like gesticulations that are getting people's attention (like a ref making a hand signal, to which the batter and the pitcher would be reacting).  There are weird little rules here and there; for instance, if a batted ball hits a runner while he's between bases, he's out. He interfered with the ball in play, so he's automatically out. There's a good reason for all of the weird little rules. I don't think there is a weird rule about batters catching the ball. I've been a baseball fan for more than 15 years and I've never heard of that."
SlyGifs,36a2bh,helpful_hank,2,Mon May 18 00:34:47 2015 UTC,"Very interesting... I've never watched a baseball game in my life (I'm European, there's not much of a culture around baseball where I live) but to be honest it seems like it could be fun! Pretty cool atmosphere. Thanks for your time!"

SlyGifs,35nxc6,Destroyer333,27,Tue May 12 01:30:01 2015 UTC,"On my phone, I open the link, press play, and just a minute ago it froze my entire phone up. I vote no vines"

SlyGifs,35nxc6,salmonfishing,12,Tue May 12 01:34:11 2015 UTC,Yeah the fact that you're asking is a good sign.   Basically when I open it it'll play the sound without the video. Then you have to tap it and it'll freeze before playing. Finally after playing once it'll cover the video with comments or text or whatever which is not something you especially want for subs like this where you want to see multiple times.
SlyGifs,35nxc6,salmonfishing,7,Tue May 12 01:41:06 2015 UTC,"That's silly. I'll ask some other mods if anyone knows a good vine-gif converter. I can put it in the wiki or something, in case anyone cares enough to read that :P"

SlyGifs,35nxc6,ConfuciusCubed,8,Tue May 12 01:52:17 2015 UTC,One user suggested putting [Vine] in the title to notify other users. I think that might be a solid compromise. What do you think?
SlyGifs,35nxc6,ConfuciusCubed,3,Tue May 12 01:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely is useful and it's settled!"

At least that way I'd be less likely to accidentally click one of those posts, and the people that are cool with it can still enjoy them."
SlyGifs,35nxc6,ConfuciusCubed,7,Tue May 12 01:47:59 2015 UTC,"That seems fair. This is called slyGIFS but I don't necessarily want to turn other content away, especially since I have so much trouble finding content myself."

SlyGifs,35nxc6,david0990,6,Tue May 12 05:16:05 2015 UTC,sure - maybe flare  them as vines?
SlyGifs,35nxc6,TJBacon,8,Tue May 19 02:10:14 2015 UTC,Vines are fine by me. Perhaps add a [Vine] flare because I think they don't work properly for some people.
SlyGifs,35nxc6,Dr_Death_Defy24,6,Tue May 12 01:53:31 2015 UTC,Hmm...we could potentially do some flairing. This is a sub that's really low on content though so I'd be iffy on that for now.

It then takes more than half the fall before it spreads out its legs to slow the fall and to cushion the fall. After that, its speed is nearly constant no matter how far it falls. That means the the most dangerous height to fall for a cat is around three floors, because then it doesn't have time to spread out its legs."

SlyGifs,34394p,k_ing_lucas,60,Mon Apr 27 23:26:50 2015 UTC,Imagine if he wasn't wearing gloves...
SlyGifs,34394p,AhrmiintheUnseen,33,Tue Apr 28 12:45:03 2015 UTC,he would have rolled
SlyGifs,34394p,the_television,7,Tue Apr 28 13:43:01 2015 UTC,Into his face
SlyGifs,34394p,Stevey854,33,Tue Apr 28 22:09:15 2015 UTC,RIP shoes.
SlyGifs,34394p,SecureNetwork,13,Tue Apr 28 11:17:03 2015 UTC,That's damn impressive
SlyGifs,34394p,Jo_MamaSo,8,Tue Apr 28 07:35:57 2015 UTC,does he have knee pads on??
SlyGifs,34394p,NZ_Shadow-Fox,7,Tue Apr 28 13:12:24 2015 UTC,"I think he does, he should've done an electric slide."
SlyGifs,34394p,PacoTaco321,11,Tue Apr 28 13:57:27 2015 UTC,"At the end when he lifts his hands off the ground, you can see the right palm exposed. The gloves got fucking disintegrated."
SlyGifs,34394p,rzezzy1,40,Tue Apr 28 13:28:34 2015 UTC,That's not his palm. Its a piece of what's most likely granite or sandstone. Longboarders attach pieces to their gloves so they can touch the ground when they slide without destroying their gloves/hands in the process.
SlyGifs,34394p,InternalDemons,11,Tue Apr 28 13:57:47 2015 UTC,"Wait, so they plan this shit?"
SlyGifs,34394p,Kongo204,21,Tue Apr 28 15:38:44 2015 UTC,From the last time this gif was posted:  For any non Longboarders wondering why he still has hands  https://www.google.com/search?q=slide+gloves&prmd=ivns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=QPgEVf-dHab9sASntIKIAQ&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ  Also it is important to note the main reason for these gloves is not to prevent damage but are mainly used for doing tricks like this:  http://i.imgur.com/H5oQQju.gif
SlyGifs,34394p,Pyromantom,5,Tue Apr 28 15:59:00 2015 UTC,"Ok, so this guy really is as awesome as he looks."
SlyGifs,34394p,Kongo204,3,Tue Apr 28 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered, what makes longboards more effective or popular for doing things like this instead of a regular skateboard?"
SlyGifs,34394p,avelertimetr,10,Fri May 1 12:44:02 2015 UTC,"Longboards are longer and more flexible. The springiness of most longboards allows you to go over a lot more surfaces without effort and at higher speeds than skateboards.  Longboard wheels are thicker and much more absorbing. This allows the board to go over cracks, at much higher speeds, and over more surfaces than skateboards. The wheels also allow for the rider to slide the board.  The combination of the thicker smoother wheels and springiness of the board allow users to use less energy while going longer distances and allow users to use less energy to accelerate.  Sliding permitted by the wheels on longboards allow users a way besides footbreaking to slow down. They can slow down over longer periods of time and go down much steeper gradients of hills."
SlyGifs,34394p,Pyromantom,3,Sat May 2 10:12:01 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the explanation! That's pretty awesome.
SlyGifs,34394p,avelertimetr,2,Sat May 2 14:44:36 2015 UTC,When you get on a skateboard you're aware that you're going to be in this position sooner or later.
SlyGifs,34394p,MedusaOblongGato,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:55:25 2015 UTC,"Huh, I always heard that they used cut up pieces of cutting boards for that. I feel like granite or sandstone would start to get expensive after a while."

SlyGifs,34394p,failtolaunch28,0,Tue May 12 21:05:37 2015 UTC,It's wax so they can slide super low to the ground

SlyGifs,34394p,Nextasy,1 point,Tue May 19 00:58:56 2015 UTC,This is how you're supposed to bail in the event this happens.  When I go practice sliding this happens to me multiple times in a day.
