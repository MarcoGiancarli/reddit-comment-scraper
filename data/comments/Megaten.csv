I'd put P1MC above P3MC if it weren't for the fact that the P1MC's two alternate portrayals (good natured tease yet a bit conflicted in the manga; compassionate and a bit of a jokester in the CD Drama) don't align with his in-game personality, which is nearly nonexistent; the P3MC is also decent in Q, whereas his movie portrayal is my absolute least favorite portrayal of any of the MCs.

Megaten,3dyiyp,Hammerbro20,2,Mon Jul 20 21:05:49 2015 UTC,"It's a tie between Naoya, Minato, and Yu. I like Yu because of his ideas of human potential and always chasing after the truth. I like Minato because in the games he can be very charismatic but at the same time can take himself and his social interactions too seriously for my taste. That's one aspect about him that I like Yu more for.  I like Naoya because he's very compassionate but at the same time very assertive and self-respecting.

Megaten,3dzwxx,Norix596,4,Tue Jul 21 00:53:21 2015 UTC,"That hadn't occurred to me; but I bet they had some sort of plan before they started in earnest though - they probably wouldn't have committed to a project they just couldn't localize. while Japan is the primary audience, a fair share of sales come from NA too. Maybe they're either going to leave the songs as they originally were if there are a lot of them or maybe there are going to be fewer songs with vocals than we might guess at this point. An easy cop out might be to have obscured faces during vocals -- either with some mask equivalent or different camera angles when vocals are going on to at least make the job easier."
Megaten,3dzwxx,Norix596,3,Tue Jul 21 00:56:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe they're either going to leave the songs as they originally were if there are a lot of them   That's what I hope they do, but I'm not going to hold my breath."
Megaten,3dzwxx,Bluezrhap,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:55 2015 UTC,"They could even have a funny little lamp-shading about why it's clearly a different voice singing the song. ""Oh yeah, these idols can't actually sing - they're just lip-syncing on stage to the actual singers in the back."""
Megaten,3dzwxx,Ribose5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:50 2015 UTC,They got away with just pretending there was no difference in Kids on the Slope.
Megaten,3dzwxx,DenkouNova,2,Tue Jul 21 08:30:55 2015 UTC,"It makes sense considering songs are really the hardest thing for any translation project, regardless of the source and destination languages, just because of how much has to be considered if you want to ""do it right""."
Megaten,3dzwxx,MachoFan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:42 2015 UTC,"Are there many other games with both translated songs and lip synch?  Stuff like openings or insert songs in Tales Of or Final Fantasy are easy enough, but with lip synch..."
Megaten,3dzwxx,Norix596,10,Tue Jul 21 16:14:00 2015 UTC,"I love the work done but my biggest problem with the localization is the use of Honorifics. It might just be me, but growing up with some massive weebs that used them in ""normal"" conversation pretty much imprinted a massive dislike of hearing someone speak English but use -chan and -senpai and the like. Honestly the only complaint I have when it comes to Persona's voice work."
Megaten,3dzwxx,Timewinders,8,Tue Jul 21 03:06:56 2015 UTC,I could go either way on the honorifics.
Megaten,3dzwxx,Zangam,4,Tue Jul 21 04:05:24 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with it, but the voice actors don't pronounce them right a lot of the time. Like ""kun"" being pronounced as ""koon""."
Megaten,3dzwxx,Timewinders,8,Tue Jul 21 03:26:00 2015 UTC,"But doesn't ""u"" make an ""oo"" sound in Japanese phonetics?"
Megaten,3dzwxx,CplGunshow,3,Tue Jul 21 03:43:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that, but I do know that when you hear Japanese voice acting the ""u"" isn't as elongated as it sometimes is in the dub. Even within the dub there's some variation - sometimes it's pronounced with a short ""u"" and sometimes with a long ""u"". It's not consistent."
Megaten,3dzwxx,DenkouNova,2,Tue Jul 21 03:47:18 2015 UTC,"Did a couple of years of Japanese language, I'll try my best to explain with my crappy knowledge. ""Ku"" makes a very light Ooh sound, but not quite an ""ooh"" try pronouncing it but cutting off half way through, imagine the evil loli girl laugh (ku ku ku ku ku). I think the main change comes from the N on the end. In nipponese you pronounce the ""n"" a bit longer and drag out the sound slightly, imagine it as a ""nn"" (like when you would agree with something but not speak, mmm)  Welp I hope that makes it easier instead of harder, Japanese pronunciation was a fun part of learning the language."
Megaten,3dzwxx,Zangam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:55:42 2015 UTC,"English is really bad to emulate fast-speaking languages because of the emphasis system. Pronouncing ""Yukari"" in English means you're going to spend more time on the middle syllable then on the rest of the word. English-pronounced kun is a lone syllable, so it has the emphasis like con in ""pros and cons"" even though it shouldn't, like con in ""consumer"".  But yeah, wouldn't people think it sounds weird without the elongated ""u"", though?  Already the way I see it, people would think they're trying to hard if they went out of their way to pronounce the Japanese R's, so if they would mess with vowel timings, surely people would be resistant."
Megaten,3dzwxx,DenkouNova,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"Ah. Well, I know that Hawaiian vowels go ""Ah, Ey, Ee, Oh, Oo"" and from the sounds of it they're relatively similar. I just kinda assumed they were that way too."

Megaten,3dzwxx,auragar,-20,Tue Jul 21 16:47:51 2015 UTC,Finally more or less (less) confirms P5 is 2016. His wording plus many other factors confirm it.

Megaten,3dzwxx,auragar,-16,Mon Jul 20 23:05:11 2015 UTC,"No it wasn't. It was worded that way because they haven't started working on P5's translation. As for it being a month ago means they could have started by now, but that still leaves very little hope with only 5 months left in the year, and many other factors."

I agree with you by the way - I don't see how P5 is realistically going to be 2015 in NA, and I'm surprised people think so - but I feel I don't get downvoted even when I state that opinion because I try to stay civil.  Your later posts were good, also, I upvoted them. It made a somewhat interesting conversation, so I'm looking forward to see more of you on the subreddit! :)"
Megaten,3dzwxx,Bluezrhap,2,Tue Jul 21 19:14:44 2015 UTC,"I am used to being ostracized. I wasn't really too well known in high school besides from the teachers as I was a honor student.  I suppose, it is hard to stay civil in this sub where there are soooooo many people here who love to do nothing but shitpost and try to troll people. The general atmosphere of this sub is horrible. I am not saying this is true of every member. I love /u/toidiedud for example, even if he is a bit too deluded in regards to P5 and Atlus' marketing and release strategy for the game, but he is such a nice guy, and his flair is pretty shweet (Raiho ftw).  That particular comment didn't seem to sit well with Ribose, but I am not afraid to claim myself as a huge Atlus fan. A huge Persona fan. Though I do like other games as well, just not anywhere near as much as Atlus', especially Persona. Or at least Persona 5. 4 was alright. 3 was pretty good. 2 is not bad. I'd put it on par with 4. And 1 was... eh. No terrible but not great. But P5, P5 man it looks so good, and seems to be made for me (I know it isn't, Atlus doesn't know me, and even if they did I am still just some nobody why would they make a game catering to me specifically, especially since they can't possibly know exactly what I would like (though I swear it seems like they do with P5 man, it just looks so perfect for me)). As for seeing more of me, I only really comment on P5 articles, and recently Illusory Revelations to try to defend it because this sub (and really a lot of the internet) are far too harsh on it, and I am as I said fine with people having their own opinion on the game, and not liking it, just don't keep saying it over and over, and don't go to threads specifically just to say that, or make threads specifically to bash it. I do sometimes visit other threads, but really most of this thread isn't really that great, as I explained above. I have been around for a while and I will continue to be around, just as frequently as before, no more, no less."
Megaten,3dzwxx,Bluezrhap,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:37 2015 UTC,"Hey man I was super hopeful!Of course I also thought Sony would have nothing to announce this year so they'd pressure Atlus to deviate from normal :P  I agree with ya on P5 though,it almost feels tailor-made. FFXV does to me as well but gosh both look so good to me.  Of course I still think P5 can come out this year(At this point it all depends on when its out in Japan)or at the worst first chunk of next year, I'll still hope for 2015 until I can actually pre-order the game with a solid date.  Heck at this point I wouldn't mind it being pushed so I have more time for Fallout 4 and Xenoblade Chronicles X.  Also wooh compliment out of nowhere!"

Megaten,3dzwxx,auragar,3,Mon Jul 20 23:04:02 2015 UTC,"Well, there's several factors to consider, like how loyal is ATLUS to release dates. Do they have a history of pushing back release dates?  Also, how big a game is persona 5 compared to 3 and 4."
Megaten,3dzwxx,Bluezrhap,-10,Mon Jul 20 23:13:30 2015 UTC,"Yes they do have a history of pushing back release dates actually, and this game is clearly going to be as large if not larger than 3 and 4 which were huge games with tons of content. Also consider P4DAN which has very little content and is still taking 3 months to come out here. And had its voicing done 5 months before release, when this has shit all done yet."
Megaten,3dzwxx,auragar,2,Mon Jul 20 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah?  Search ""release date"" on /r/megaten and tell me how many times you see something that says ""pushed back"" any more than a few weeks at most."

Megaten,3dyv71,Ceiiu,14,Mon Jul 20 17:27:45 2015 UTC,"Shit, that's pretty good. I was all for Sherlock being the main villain Persona, but maybe we'll have him grudgingly team up with the party to fight Fantomas.  Or maybe if MCs Persona is actually Fantomas and becomes Arsene for real... Shit, we might even get inspector Javert as a villain in on this since the whole theme is break free and I'm getting a really strong government conspiracy vibe for the story."
Megaten,3dyv71,Bluezrhap,3,Mon Jul 20 17:35:33 2015 UTC,Haha yeah that'd be pretty neat. Or even adult detective Naoto teaming up with the new protagonists! That'd be a wonderful cameo.
Megaten,3dyv71,Bluezrhap,8,Mon Jul 20 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"Okay, I don't know about that. Maybe a passing mention of her like they've done in previous games but I don't want Persona 4-2."
Megaten,3dyv71,Meno_Self,8,Mon Jul 20 17:39:11 2015 UTC,Yea you're right it's been milked enough already.
Megaten,3dyv71,Toidiedud,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:14 2015 UTC,I'd be okay if they had a short arc referencing P4 in P5 like the Gekkoukan trip in P4 did as long as it doesn't spend more than 2 to 3 days in game and serves an actual purpose in the plot and isn't just fanservicey filler.
Megaten,3dyv71,crimsonfist101,8,Mon Jul 20 23:46:30 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine Fantomas would be an ally who later on is revealed to be the true mastermind behind all the events happening.  It's a thieves story so we have to have at least one betrayal. So even if he's not evil at the start, whoever ends up with Fantomas betraying you would be good.  The real interesting thing right now though is we know nothing of the plot so it's super hard to even place what kind of role an Antagonist would have right now."
Megaten,3dyv71,johneawesome,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:28:25 2015 UTC,Agreed
Megaten,3dyv71,aalleepphh,6,Mon Jul 20 19:40:00 2015 UTC,Now he sounds like he would make a good foil to the more honourable gentleman thief that Arsene is supposed to be. I can see that working really well.

Megaten,3dyv71,IzanApollo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:42 2015 UTC,"If Fantomas is the name of the bad guy in P5 it will be very weird here in France.

Megaten,3dxj9m,Timewinders,5,Mon Jul 20 13:32:36 2015 UTC,"I also made a post about this before: https://www.reddit.com/r/Megaten/comments/1wi6p8/reason_for_the_mythology_similarity_between/. The more interesting question to me was why the writers of P3 and P4 chose to use that connection between the protagonists. See also here for similar myths: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_to_the_underworld. Gilgamesh was the other one that came to mind. I'm not sure why the idea of going to the underworld is so common in mythology. Maybe it's because if you believe in an afterlife it's logical to want to go there to bring back the people you love. As for why the theme was used in both P3 and P4, I think /u/Sharkfinnigan might have been right about it being about defying fate or the ""will of mankind"" and the mark of a true hero. Despite the connection, though, there are some differences: Orpheus is used in Persona 3 in connection to defying death and Izanagi is used in Persona 4 for realizing and accepting the truth (that Izanami is truly dead), so they're not quite the same in that sense."
Megaten,3dxj9m,awesomejp,3,Mon Jul 20 15:34:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the links, and yeah, I was curious about that as well. I think that explanation for the differences between the two (defying death) and (accepting the truth) are really spot on based on not only their personas, but also from the 2 characters interactions with the final bosses of their games."

(I suppose you could say P1 protag's ultimate persona, Amon-Ra, is similar to Yu's in that he's a god that gave birth to itself and possibly helped give birth to everything else past the Ogdoad similarly to Izanagi, but that might be stretching things a bit lol)."

Megaten,3dxj9m,DarkStar5758,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:58 2015 UTC,"Actually it's not just a hell. There are several. Like, there's a hell for those who steal food (they're devoured by Oni [or demons]) or there's a hell for a women who's jealous of her husband having several wives or concubines (where she's turned into a snake and latched on to him and his other lovers who are also snakes), kinda like the many circles of Hell in Christianity. They get really graphic and interesting, and many scholars think the similarities between the 2 might actually be from the influence of Christianity and Zoroastrianism in Southwestern Asia making the Pure Land sect of Buddhism (where all you need to reach the ""Western Paradise"" is chant Amitaba's name 10 times and have faith he will save you..... sound familiar?)."

As such, they already know full well the myths and possible symbolic significance of their personas, more-so than most people in the West know of Greco-Roman myth even. (Like for example Yukiko's second tier persona, Amaterasu, is literally the most famous kami in all of Japan and the actually the deity of the imperial family. Also, fun fact, supposedly the emperor is capable of tracing his family lineage all the way back to her.)"

P2:IS was pretty stale yeah, just because of the easiness of the game. P2:EP though was pretty hard especially on a couple bosses, but going through both hardly felt like a trudge because the great plot kept me going, and it was more than worth it.   P3 was probably the least stale, just because of one more, assists, all-outs and all that. Haven't played P4.   If anything though, combat and dungeons are Persona's weakest factor so there's that."

Megaten,3e1kyr,SCO_1,6,Tue Jul 21 10:51:29 2015 UTC,"I love dungeon crawling above all else in rpgs so it never got stale with so much combat since its very speedy combat.  It has flair and panache but brevity and simplicity at its core. No final fantasy pretty but horribly long animations or ones that take too long for a simple action.  Also a healthy break and palate cleanser helps alleviate those ""just one more floor"" sessions that can just kill the momentum.  Maybe you just need to go in with a different mindset and plan of attack,or utterly lose yourself in it.   At least persona isn't super hardcore dungeon crawling so that helps."
Megaten,3e1kyr,Toidiedud,5,Tue Jul 21 07:20:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, especially in p3 and p4 because the ""once more"" system is basically a dumbed down Press turn system. The press turn system is a lot more engaging, and has a lot more strategy imho."
Megaten,3e1kyr,LightningLordL,3,Tue Jul 21 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"The one more system has a few merits that Press Turn does not, like having a more rigid turn order and requiring you to plan ahead unlike how it's much easier to adapt to a situation with every action in Press Turn. It's just fucking broken in any game that isn't P3 FES."
Megaten,3e1kyr,Bluezrhap,4,Tue Jul 21 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"I find press turn more risky than once more, which is why I love it. If you do something good in pressturn, like attack a weakness, it is more helpful than in the ""once more system."" But if you miss an attack, or an enemy gets a weakness on you, it could be harder to recover.   It's just fucking broken in any game that isn't P3 FES.   This is the thing I dislike about once more, by endgame, its easy as shit to exploit."
Megaten,3e1kyr,LightningLordL,0,Tue Jul 21 21:10:45 2015 UTC,"Press Turn is also pretty easy to exploit. Sukukaja/sukunda can get you through most encounters if you use them enough. While Press Turn is more punishing for your mistakes, it's definitely more forgiving in giving you the means to deal with them.  All this is why I insist that tactics are objectively better in Persona."
Megaten,3e1kyr,Bluezrhap,2,Tue Jul 21 21:20:01 2015 UTC,"I mean yeah, it is pretty easy to exploit. IDK tho, I just find Persona 4's combat boring in the end game, just hit Hassou Tobi and/or any powerful move, and ded. Obvs, Fes did not have this big of a problem. Also, boss battles dragged out way too long in Persona, while being uninteresting. Because there were no weaknesses in them, it just felt like a generic long fight."
Megaten,3e1kyr,LightningLordL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:58 2015 UTC,"That's also true, but boss fights aren't as common in Persona as they are in SMT. I think dragging them out adds some challenge to them and gives them some emphasis on their importance"
Megaten,3e1kyr,Bluezrhap,2,Tue Jul 21 21:24:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is true, but I did not fear bosses, but just wanted to get them done with. In Persona 3 tho, the bosses were fun and exciting. All bringing new challenges."
Megaten,3e1kyr,LightningLordL,4,Tue Jul 21 21:30:58 2015 UTC,"If Persona didn't have a good story it would be a terrible game series. The story is really what carries the games. Persona 4, for example, I HATE going into dungeons. I hate grinding, and I hate wasting SP just to try and find a weakness only to find out that the enemy doesn't have a weakness. But I power through it for the sake of saving my friends.  Then after you rescue someone you have downtime. You get a lot of story and talking to friends and just generally hanging out. By the time someone gets captured again I'm almost itching to go back in, like I've forgotten that the combat isn't very good. If it weren't for the well written characters and interesting story, I would have quit the game long ago.  I get this way with all JRPG's, though. They all require grinding and leveling up and usually don't have that amazing of combat, it's usually pretty slow. The Persona series does a lot to try and alleviate that monotony of dungeon crawling, though."
Megaten,3e1kyr,ifancytacos,2,Tue Jul 21 09:53:04 2015 UTC,"After beating persona 4 three times, I'd have to agree with you.  Not because the combat is bad, but because I've just played the damn thing so much.

Megaten,3e1kyr,ArnoldNorris,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:43:45 2015 UTC,"Yes ofc it becomes stale, considering it's bloody easy and becomes easier as you go on. The major bosses are ok (in P3).  If only persona valkyria chronicles existed... well, that is still easy, but at least it's more involving."
Megaten,3e1kyr,SCO_1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:48:11 2015 UTC,"I enjoy easy grinding, so I'll spend countless hours in the dungeons of 3&4 to get my characters up to level 99 (which was only worth it for the P3 games with the stat upgrade - very disappointing how that didn't happen in 4, lol).  I never hit a wall, but if I find myself not as enthused as usual, I just do some story bits/social links before hitting the grind again."
Megaten,3e1kyr,itsavgbltpta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:48 2015 UTC,Personally I think that the semi-random encounters do get a bit boring since in the early sections of the game you tend to have to grind quite a bit since your Personas and abilities are nothing spectacular.  But then the game tends to hit a certain point around 3/4 of the way through where all of a sudden your Personas are AWESOME. Your abilities allow you to one shot most encounters. AND the story is ramping up towards a pretty epic conclusion. Plus by then the bosses become less like fights and more like giant puzzles.  BUT Persona 5 looks like it is going to be innovating on the combat quite a bit. Rather than random Shadow enemies it looks like it is returning to the series routes and having the enemies be Personas that you can later summon.
Megaten,3e1kyr,apollo151,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:45 2015 UTC,its very simplistic but thats kind of what makes it enjoyable.  i would feel more bored on console thats for sure.  but being able to play it on handheld and stop whenever just makes it the perfect application.  so easy to turn it on knock off a floor of a dungeon then continue what you were doing.  also so many jrpgs lately are action based or at least have atb that actual turn based system is a nice change of pace.

Megaten,3e1kyr,PictoShark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:13 2015 UTC,I never really got too tired of Persona's battles. Trying to get and fuse new personas made me want to keep playing. The only time I got tired of it was in P3 being in Tartarus for a long stretch of time and then die without saving. I usually just take a break after that happens.
Megaten,3e1kyr,HumanGiant13,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:56 2015 UTC,"Not really, for me, outside of P3P or Golden.  While Persona 3 Portable and Persona 4 Golden do expand on the content in some ways, they turn the dungeon crawls into jokes, which in turn neuters the combat system's lethality. While I've played both games for their story aspects, neither is very good at tackling the gameplay portions of the games.  A large part of the difficulty of Persona 3/Persona 3:FES and Persona 4 vanilla is that your ability to stay in the dungeon-crawling areas is sharply limited, by the Fatigue/Sickness system in Persona 3/FES and by the limitation on SP recovery in Persona 4 vanilla. Every fight, unless you manage to get through it flawlessly without using SP or HP, is another cut in a death of a thousand. Party members become useless and have to bail (in Persona 3) or just plain run out of SP and are therefor fairly vulnerable and useless (in Persona 4), which makes every fight a cumulative, drawn out face punch to the player.  When you enter Tartarus in P3/FES or the various dungeons of Persona 4 vanilla, you're going to be forced to turn back sooner or later. It's all a matter of how well you can push through each encounter without losing too much of your limited resources before you're forced to turn back, and a matter of how much progress you've made.  Persona 4: Golden and P3P both crap all over that balance, unfortunately.  As an aside, if you're really having trouble with keeping the battles interesting, try bumping up the difficulty and starting fresh. Even if you know what to expect, those can keep you on your toes with just how punishing a single mistake can be."

Megaten,3dzby5,hyliangamepad,2,Tue Jul 21 05:59:32 2015 UTC,"Law as defined by mainline is more than order though. Even chaos has some level of order. Gotou has a nationalistic order idea. Ozawa runs an inner city state. All the places in the abyss are run like city states, and lucifer as well as you on some chaos ends are actual kings. Yama is a chaotic angel of judgement. The hierarchical order has always been a staple of chaos. Its not like they literally do nothing but run around punching eachother. War is considered chaotic, yet armies have a lot of internal order. Chaos involves conflict on both the individual, but also group level. And group distinction involves a little order. By DnD standards he might be harder to place, but smt would place him pretty chaos."
Megaten,3dzby5,bunker_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:56 2015 UTC,"Yes. But apparently not if you go by the desuII anime's standards.

I also noticed that the guide has you wrap up all relationships by what seems like a good couple of months before when the game should end.    Does this mean that even though I'm slightly behind now, there's enough leeway to give me a chance to finish everything in time?"

Megaten,3dw5h6,DenkouNova,9,Mon Jul 20 01:02:21 2015 UTC,"I always missed this thread by 2-3 days. Let's go! I'm on day 3, just before Beldr. One of the designs I like the least in Megaten, I tell you. Hard pointy metal nipples and a satellite dish head, I just can't.  MC  I named him Minegishi Kazuya, like... some manga version I think.  No auto button for dialogues  Overclocked is voiced now and there is a lot of dialogue. I wish I could press ""auto"" and hold the 3DS with one hand (esp. in public transportation, sometimes you need to hold a bar or smth), but I gotta keep pressing that NEXT button. :(  Yuzu at the beginning is dumb  If culture critics actually played games, they would have a field day with how dumb Yuzu is at the beginning of the game. Atsurou is just like ""so COMPs communicate with each other"" and Yuzu goes straight into ""OMG PLEASE STOP THESE COMPLICATED WORDS HURT MY WEE BRAIN"" mode. She's better later on though.  You fight demons all the time, but Midori isn't allowed to do it  That's just stupid. I just grinded for 10 battles in a row in order to survive in a battle in which Keisuke tells Midori to stop fighting and to let go of her COMP. She's obviously better than us, Keisuke, we're level 22 and she has two Lv25 Cait Siths. Fuckin' Keisuke. Do you want to do everything for your future girlfriends, Keisuke? Do you want insecure, weak girls, and for whom you will always have to decide? No you don't, Keisuke. You shut up and let Midori do what she fucking wants.  Haru's chest shifts in and out of existence  Seriously what? You would assume Haru's chest fills her top, but when she lewdly lets her straps slip down - which is ALL THE TIME, and in front of MINORS - everyone sees she's actually a 32B wearing a top three cups too high filled with air. And also that she has no nipples. Where are they?? Fuckin' Yasuda, man.  Auctions are not a well done mechanic  All you have to do is bid like 85% of the buy-it-now price. The Auction is a cheaper demon compendium with randomized demons. That's what it is. And when you try to use it like a real auction and bid small increments, you end up in a bid war and then the price finishes at 95% of the buy-it-now price. Why introduce a mechanic and then encourage people not to use it?  Fusions are great  I don't think all games should show you the demons that you don't have yet, but for DeSu it fits quite well.  There are not enough slots for skills and I don't really like that  I kind of see where they were going - they want you to have a lot of demons- not just 8 - but I like having just a few demons that are really strong. Every demon only has 3 active and 3 passive skills, and half are filled with dubious skills when you make a new demon. For now all of my demons are either Wendigos or Kikuri-Hime with three resistance skills, and since I want to keep these resistances (they make me live and give extra turns), my next demons are going to be Silky and Power, because they're the next two ones without default support skills (actually there's also Orcus, but Orcus is ugly).  Also the map skills are a really great idea. It makes you appreciate the different families a lot more."
Megaten,3dw5h6,Ninto55,4,Mon Jul 20 01:19:56 2015 UTC,"I've never considered the Midori perspective of her being better than you. Though, I still think stopping her is the right thing to do ultimately anyway, she was going to end up getting herself killed by humans eventually no matter how well she handles demons. Also, what happens to her demons when she joins the group? It would be great if when people joined your party they brought a couple of demons with them.  Yeah auctions are dumb. I would usually just bid a certain amount and then increase it a certain amount (just 10 early on, but later a few hundred each time) until the other bidders dropped out. It felt terrible to buy a demon for more money, to lose a good demon by being outbid, or bidding way too much. Unless you go into the game and make the decision to not save scum, you'll probably just save before every bid and make sure you do it perfectly.  Yeah the skill limits are annoying, but I like the way it encourages you to have passives. When I play most SMT games, I just focus on whatever offensive or healing spells I can get, and only focus on passives when I'm going for something specific (a fire boost for a fire centered demon, a healing boost for my healer, a pierce for my brute, etc.), but DeSu makes you set aside half of a demon's skillset for passives. This affects me more than it would players who play the games the way they're supposed to, but I don't mind the limitations. Better than Raidou 1's implementation where you only had two active spells and two passives, which I'm pretty sure was only in place because when you controlled the demon in a solo battle they only had two face buttons to spare to let you cast the spells. Raidou 1 was done like that to make up for a design flaw, DeSu is built like that to encourage a diverse set of demons. And hey, at least they let you have a bunch of Wendigos or Kikuri-Himes. Imagine how rought DeSu would be if you had the usual limit of having only one demon of each type in your party. That would be terrible.  And /u/cuntscicle64, I know you're just shit posting, but Minegishi probably fits in the Japanese version (which I assume he's playing)."
Megaten,3dw5h6,DenkouNova,4,Mon Jul 20 02:34:27 2015 UTC,"I've never considered the Midori perspective of her being better than you.   Well unless you've grinded tons, she's higher level than all of you, which I feel is important. It's not like she goes in battle with two Pixies, so Keisuke has no reason to indulge in his scenario where Midori is defenseless and she has to be protected. I find it a bit creepy. :(  Also yes, JP version. JP Overclocked is crazy expensive, it came out over there at 90-100$ I think. They really made Overclocked as a special limited final version that nobody is supposed to own, like Nocturne Maniacs, whereas in NA it was just like ""yeah here's a game or whatever, 30$""."
Megaten,3dw5h6,Ninto55,2,Mon Jul 20 02:50:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah I see what you mean about her not being defenseless, and while I can easily look at the Keisuke situation as him making Midori his waifu and being overly protective, but I never got a creepy feeling from it. I felt like he was genuinely upset about people turning on the person protecting them more than anything, which relates to that backstory about bullies or something. Now I'm wondering if there is some translation differences that make the English version less creepy than it was originally.  Wow, I had no idea Overclocked was so limited there. Someone mentioned the sales of the DeSu games on here recently, and I just thought overclocked didn't sell well. What a weird decision. Same for Maniacs. They both add a lot, and it is weird to think that it is hard to come by. What about Record Breaker?"
Megaten,3dw5h6,DenkouNova,2,Mon Jul 20 03:01:10 2015 UTC,"Now I'm wondering if there is some translation differences that make the English version less creepy than it was originally.   Maybe just a little. Most of the interpretation differences between you and I are probably because 1- I like fighter women way too much, and 2- I saw in the last 10 years from the people around me that you don't achieve social success by being a weak white knight. :D  I'm exaggerating a little though. I'm a weird person.  That being said, Atsurou said ""something happened to Keisuke"", and hopefully I'll discover that later in the game - surely that'll change my views."

Megaten,3dw5h6,magmafanatic,2,Mon Jul 20 17:29:54 2015 UTC,"As a relative noob to the series, I'm curious if the Devil Survivor games are the only ones where the demon races matter beyond arbitrary fusion rules. Racial skills really went a long way to make them matter to me.  SMTIV throws a huge list of demons at you that Mido can't even display in one fusion search, and they all seem fairly interchangeable, it was one of the few complaints I had with IV."
Megaten,3dw5h6,DenkouNova,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:11:38 2015 UTC,"No other translated games have racial skills, unfortunately (actually I haven't played both Raidou games, so maybe those...). A 1994 Japan only game called Majin Tensei had something similar where race affected movement and battle roles (tank, healer, etc), but the skills were better done in DeSu.  I don't mind it, demons have their stories and personalities and strengths and stuff. Personally I don't think the DeSu race skills are that game-changing."
Megaten,3dw5h6,Ninto55,2,Mon Jul 20 02:36:42 2015 UTC,"The Raidou games used the demon races only for the investigation skills. If you needed to read people's mind you would get demons of the race that read people's mind, or could fly, or could stop you in the middle of gameplay for like 20 seconds just to pick up 100 yen and then brag about it, fucking Mokoi. They have no affect in gameplay besides occasionally hitting a point in the game where you're required to have a demon of a certain race. Which means running back to Victor to buy the cheapest one you can.  I like to hear about the similarities between DeSu and Majin Tensei, though they don't sound that important there. Though I do think the DeSu racial skills are game-changing, when most strategies for beating bosses revolve around using certain racial skills to get to the boss quicker, or attack it from afar, or attack multiple times. Racial skills make a huge difference to gameplay. Without them the games would be a lot simpler, and not in a good way."

I haven't done anything past ending selection yet, but I'm looking forward to how it ends. So far I feel like shit about my ending and feel like it's by far the worst option to choose (Like goddamn, Yuzu has some nice yoohoos but that bitch has problems). Honestly probably would have gone Naoya's if it weren't for the fact that Naoya is just a COMPLETE dick the entire game.  I'm really trying to just finish the game fast and do a New Game+ without letting so many people die and with actually getting new party members. Keisuke was hardly with me for even a day before he ran off, and other than the original 3 I just got Midori (who I feel like you get no matter what).

Megaten,3dt822,kiss-tits,2,Sun Jul 19 05:58:08 2015 UTC,"You can probably make do with a simple blue shirt and gloves, especially if you get the silver hair color too. Did you make the apron?  It looks spot on."
Megaten,3dt822,d3lness,4,Sun Jul 19 06:01:16 2015 UTC,"I was going to wear a black button up and tie, since thats what he wears under his coat, and then black pants with blue sides sewn on. And the wig I'm getting is this one here in Light Grey: http://arda-wigs.com/products/marty  And yeah I made the apron! I started it at noon today and finished at 10pm. But I did spend a good chunk of that time running to the store to buy things because those darn ruffles broke my sewing machine's foot lmao..."
Megaten,3dt822,nin_ninja,41,Sun Jul 19 06:07:02 2015 UTC,FYI: This sub shits on literally everything even vaguely MegaTen. Literally. Everything. Except the music sometimes...
Megaten,3dt822,GozuTennoh,19,Sun Jul 19 06:20:55 2015 UTC,I think Meguro and Kaneko are often the only things not given shit
Megaten,3dt822,awesomejp,7,Sun Jul 19 07:35:13 2015 UTC,nah. SMT II and SJ will never be shat on
Megaten,3dt822,Meltriom,6,Sun Jul 19 08:52:14 2015 UTC,"Sadly, SJ gets shat on. SMT2 almost never along with 1 because not a lot of whiny people have tried them."
Megaten,3dt822,Bluezrhap,5,Sun Jul 19 14:06:52 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's a neat parallel between the SMT and Persona community."
Megaten,3dt822,Amppelix,4,Sun Jul 19 15:05:11 2015 UTC,I think there are probably still a lot more people in the SMT crowd that have played SMT I and II than there are people in the Persona crowd that have played Persona 1 and 2.
Megaten,3dt822,Bluezrhap,6,Sun Jul 19 15:28:15 2015 UTC,SJ is shit

Megaten,3dt822,nin_ninja,0,Mon Jul 20 00:41:58 2015 UTC,Don't talk back to your father. Otherwise I won't buy you Persona Q.
Megaten,3dt822,Pomguo,9,Mon Jul 20 00:43:41 2015 UTC,"People had issues with the game, whether it be the story, characterization, EO style gameplay, or just the fact it exists.  Personally I really loved the game and enjoyed all my time with it"
Megaten,3dt822,kiss-tits,11,Sun Jul 19 07:36:02 2015 UTC,"Frickin' loved it. It was like the Ember Island Players episode of Last Airbender - the devs poking fun at P3+P4 and its characters. But yeah, having EO's awesome gameplay helped it along a bunch."
Megaten,3dt822,tiduscrying,2,Sun Jul 19 09:03:39 2015 UTC,Do you draw your own maps in EO as well? That was a bit of a strange mechanic. You do kinda get used to it though.
Megaten,3dt822,Pomguo,2,Sun Jul 19 18:20:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's like a core mechanic of the entire EO series. They're really awesome games. The first ones on DS were all game play and pretty much no story, but the remakes on 3DS add a story mode and everything. There's a new one coming out next month, too!"
Megaten,3dt822,thed0ctah,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was pretty much the core mechanic of the EO series. It's emulating old 80s RPGs where games came with grid paper, and you'd draw the dungeons by hand in real life."
Megaten,3dt822,OtakuMecha,4,Sun Jul 19 23:04:14 2015 UTC,I don't hate PQ.
Megaten,3dt822,Yukiko_Amagi,3,Sun Jul 19 08:12:53 2015 UTC,The fanservice is like a third of the reason some people don't like it.
Megaten,3dt822,OtakuMecha,31,Sun Jul 19 06:22:44 2015 UTC,it's literally a fanservice game.  That isn't a legitimate reason to hate it.
Megaten,3dt822,d3lness,4,Sun Jul 19 06:54:52 2015 UTC,And some people don't like fanservice games.
Megaten,3dt822,RyeDo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:03:15 2015 UTC,But on meth it is.
Megaten,3dt822,Yukiko_Amagi,0,Sun Jul 19 06:57:17 2015 UTC,"Fan service is a legitimate reason not to enjoy something.  And not that PQ was super guilty of this, but the other kind of fan service, the kind where tits and ass are just waved in your face constantly, is definitely a legitimate reason to hate something."
Megaten,3dt822,RyeDo,3,Mon Jul 20 06:45:52 2015 UTC,"except it isn't in the case of Persona Q.  It's a game to please the fans, a last hurrah to the P3 cast, and the second last game with the P4 cast.  Claiming that the game is too fanservice-y is not a legitimate reason to hate it because that's the whole point."
Megaten,3dt822,nin_ninja,0,Mon Jul 20 13:04:31 2015 UTC,But if you're not a fan then it has absolutely no value to you because it offers nothing a non-fan can engage with. That's a weakness the game has and to say it's immune to criticism for it is really ridiculous. Of course people who aren't die hard fans of P3 and P4 would dislike it. And people who know nothing about P3 and P4 also might not care for it at all. You really think that people who haven't played either wouldn't express interest in this game? Guess again. There's a thread almost once a week here asking if PQ is worth it and part of the time it's from people who maybe haven't played 1 or both of the games PQ draws from.
Megaten,3dt822,nin_ninja,7,Mon Jul 20 13:59:50 2015 UTC,Ignoring the PQ salt-antisalt going on right now I will say that it is a very well made apron.  You don't look whipped enough to be Theo though.
Megaten,3dt822,CapnGregginz,2,Sun Jul 19 07:41:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah sadly I am thin and short. I've been trying to beef up but when I work 40+ hours a week and am incredibly lazy, its been tough. Good thing PQ is all chibi style, I can pass off as chibi Theo.  But thanks for the compliment!"
Megaten,3dt822,ShinyProtagonist,3,Sun Jul 19 14:49:42 2015 UTC,Whipped not ripped. You don't look like you've had the soul drained out of you by two sisters
Megaten,3dt822,magmafanatic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:04:32 2015 UTC,Oh lol. Idk I grew up with two older brothers so I've had my share of being bullied haha
Megaten,3dt822,ShinyProtagonist,10,Sun Jul 19 20:45:56 2015 UTC,"Dang, dat apron looks hawt. Solid work, got the strawberry and everything.  And to answer the PQ answer that has been asked now a multitude of times in the last week, PQ isn't a bad game but it's not a good one either. It's harmless. I got to smack things with both Junpei and Kanji in my party. That's everything I've ever wanted. But the hate makes total sense. Every character is bastardized, dungeons overstay their welcome for hours and the story doesn't matter in any way for either P3 or P4's story or characters."
Megaten,3dt822,magmafanatic,9,Sun Jul 19 06:42:37 2015 UTC,Overstay their welcome   Fuck you 4th dungeon
Megaten,3dt822,SilverKry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:46:57 2015 UTC,3rd dungeon for me  4th one was cake
Megaten,3dt822,Bluezrhap,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:26:03 2015 UTC,"3rd dungeon final puzzle with the 4 rooms, screw that.  Main reason for my hate on the 4th dungeon is close to the end there was a LONG hallway you had to go through for completing a puzzle. Oh im sorry did you accidentally pass through the wrong way? K, go do it all over again"
Megaten,3dt822,bbqburner,2,Mon Jul 20 01:34:17 2015 UTC,"Guess I play too much Etrian, I noted the banner colors on the map and then planned my route out. Also I took Naoto with me for that dungeon, so that helped. That one giant enemy was less annoying than the Fate Seeker(?) of Dungeon 3, and the boss was taken out on my first try though Endure+Diarahan scared me.  In the 3rd dungeon I was way less prepared, and between that move that made the cops act first and the FOEs that wouldn't leave me alone, I despised the place. The four rooms with the quadrants confused the heck out of me, since I thought I was picking up pieces of some really long algebra problem or something. UGH!  Still haven't beat the boss of Labyrinth 5. Need ice magic."
Megaten,3dt822,ifancytacos,4,Mon Jul 20 01:49:02 2015 UTC,Haha the strawberry is also made with glitter fabric. For effect. Thanks!
Megaten,3dt822,nin_ninja,2,Sun Jul 19 06:59:12 2015 UTC,Characters basterdized is hardly a problem given the game takes place before any developnent does in their respective games. Only fucked up characters is Akihiko and Theodore.
Megaten,3dt822,magmafanatic,2,Sun Jul 19 18:04:29 2015 UTC,Right. Lack of being developed means it's okay if a person's personality boils down to a joke.
Megaten,3dt822,magmafanatic,12,Sun Jul 19 18:34:01 2015 UTC,"No no. PQ is fine. We are just that kinda bunch who for some reason have this love-hate relationship with everything Megaten. (Also, I love the fuck out of Genei Ibunroku when it was revealed. Inb4 ragestorm.)"
Megaten,3dt822,rare_umbreon,11,Sun Jul 19 11:12:42 2015 UTC,fyi i regret making that my title now. i just wanted to show off the apron i made but now my thread has become a PQ debate. i should have thought through my title more
Megaten,3dt822,umberwitch,5,Sun Jul 19 06:29:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, every thread that has ""PQ"" in the title brings in a shitstorm of comments like this. Give it a year and people will find something new to hate and love.  Nice work on the apron though! I don't cosplay much myself, but I love seeing the dedication people put into theirs!"
Megaten,3dt822,ghostFOUR7,3,Sun Jul 19 21:03:38 2015 UTC,"I was also afraid of comments of ""wtf is this pink shit"" because of people who didnt immediately recognize it from PQ ahaha....  And thanks! I work hard on all my cosplay haha"
Megaten,3dt822,Bluezrhap,0,Sun Jul 19 21:07:09 2015 UTC,Give it a year and people will find something new to hate and love.   Yeah because this sub has such a short attention span when it comes to the games
Megaten,3dt822,Steelyx,2,Mon Jul 20 02:25:40 2015 UTC,"There were a few loud people over the past week who've been bashing the game mercilessly.  Your post is just another log for the fire, just bad timing on your part.  Good work on the apron though!"
Megaten,3dt822,mccartneytm,2,Mon Jul 20 01:29:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah I kinda saw some thread titles asking why people didnt like PQ, but I didn't even click them. I should have known better ahaha  And thanks!!"

Megaten,3dt822,smtsj,3,Sun Jul 19 14:49:47 2015 UTC,"Excellent apron! All you need now is a blue shirt underneath.  Also, as someone who had never played a persona game, or an Etrian odyssey one, I liked PQ."
Megaten,3dt822,smtsj,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:54:14 2015 UTC,Thanks! And yeah I'll have the rest of it soon enough!
Megaten,3dt822,cuntscicle64,0,Sun Jul 19 14:50:41 2015 UTC,"Play a Persona game, and an Etrian Odyssey game. I did before, and that was probably why PQ more than anything just disappointed me. I bought the Limited Edition full price on launch day and everything."
Megaten,3dt822,Bluezrhap,3,Sun Jul 19 14:52:48 2015 UTC,"Huh, odd, I've not seen much of any negative response to PQ, though mind I don't frequent this sub-reddit too much, so I guess it slips through the cracks for me, still I really enjoy the game, still haven't completed it because I get distracted too easily, but I like pretty much everything it throws at me, the EO styled gameplay can be a bit boring at times but even then it's not horrible.  Anyway on the cosplay, it's perfect XD. All you need now is a wig, the velvet room suit and Margret and Elizabeth cosplayers to be the worst sisters ever and it would be complete. Xp"

Megaten,3dt822,CplGunshow,2,Sun Jul 19 16:03:16 2015 UTC,Ive noticed haha
Megaten,3dt822,cuntscicle64,2,Sun Jul 19 20:46:53 2015 UTC,I liked Persona Q. It was funny and delightful with a fair amount of challenge.

Megaten,3dt822,magmafanatic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:56 2015 UTC,"In a few hours? How few are we talking?  I kinda do believe you. There aren't any noticeable problems with it, so you're already a step ahead of some official merch I've seen. Seriously, you did a bang-up job."
Megaten,3dt822,L33TMAXX0R,2,Mon Jul 20 16:28:47 2015 UTC,"Its hard to be completely accurate because I took a lot of breaks. I started cutting the fabric out around noon (fabric bought the day before). I had to trim the fabric multiple times because it was too much like a skirt and not enough like an apron. I finished sewing the bottom portion of the apron, and part of the top part, before breaking my last needle and the foot of my machine (it was a plastic foot so i could be extra precise in the placement). So it was about 3pm when that happened? Something like that.  So at that point, I was frustrated and had to go to the repair shop and buy new needles and machine foot. Then i stopped into Joann fabrics too in order to buy correct thread color and more ribbon. Then I stopped at Michaels to buy cotton batting for the inside of the top part.  So I got home around... 4:30? 5? Something like that.  And I finished sewing it at 10pm. I took a lot of breaks in the final two hours of sewing though because my dad had turned the TV to some History Channel show that was super interesting and I kwpt getting distracted  TL;DR: I sewed from 12-3, then 5-10. So 8 hours of sewing? With frequent breaks.  But thanks so much. I did my best. I think I have some parts I could really fix though. You can't see in the picture, but there's a bow in the back thats actually a bit too small for the cartoony look I'm going for. But I need it to match the satin on the waistband, which was bias tape so I can't make it bigger and match OTL oh well"

Megaten,3dt822,colonelfarva,3,Sun Jul 19 16:24:40 2015 UTC,"Basically I don't like mazes, long dungeons and first person battles. I also prefer when there is more story and character interaction than combat, and as far as I know EO is kinda thin in the story department. I played one on the DS for about an hour or two and I don't want to touch that series ever again.  I am not saying that it's a bad game, just not for everyone, sort of like Monster Hunter.  You'll actually have to play me to play EO or Monster Hunter ahah"
Megaten,3dt822,IzanApollo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:44:46 2015 UTC,Well that's true. It's a series that's basically for people who grew up playing the old first person dungeon crawler games on the PC. :)

I can deal with SMT games because they usually have a great story to boot, which is probably the most important part of an RPG to me. If the story is not interesting, the gameplay is not going to save it for me."
Megaten,3dt822,cuntscicle64,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:18:05 2015 UTC,"I'm an EO fan too, but I can acknowledge it's not for everyone. It's pretty much the opposite of P3 & P4 in many ways.  Turn down the difficulty in P4, it becomes a dating sim. Turn down the difficulty in EO4, it becomes a turn-based airship sim with interactive graph paper."
Megaten,3dt822,Bluezrhap,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:07:30 2015 UTC,"Haven't met anyone who really hates it, but I've never heard anyone say it's amazing either.   I personally think it's a bit too combat heavy and lacks the social links and character development of the main series. It's fun and has it's quirky moments, but the highest score I'd give it is 6/10."
Megaten,3dt822,cuntscicle64,9,Sun Jul 19 07:32:09 2015 UTC,Game is bad because no social links and too much game   The white were right
Megaten,3dt822,Bluezrhap,-1,Sun Jul 19 07:52:08 2015 UTC,"It's a P3/P4 spinoff. Social links are a defining component of their gameplay.  If someone made a Tetris game where you participate in RPG battles instead of matching blocks, that wouldn't be ""too much game,"" it would be ""the wrong type of game.""  actually that would be awesome"
Megaten,3dt822,TheCommonSense,5,Sun Jul 19 19:01:36 2015 UTC,It's a Persona 3/4 spinoff that wasn't meant to play anything like Persona 3/4.  More like expecting to solve dungeon puzzles in Hyrule Warriors.

Megaten,3dv6ts,Bluezrhap,8,Sun Jul 19 20:41:16 2015 UTC,"Just fight things when you see them and you'll never fall short of the levels or cash you need.

Megaten,3dv6ts,keelay18,2,Sun Jul 19 20:56:11 2015 UTC,Thanks! I've got the fox social link. Should I return to the start to have him heal me if need be? And any tips for protecting against physical attacks?
Megaten,3dv6ts,nin_ninja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:22:36 2015 UTC,"Try to level the fox s.link up as quickly as you can, as the higher it goes, the more of a discount you get on healing. At low levels, it's way too expensive to be that useful."
Megaten,3dv6ts,Illidan1943,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:37:26 2015 UTC,"try to get good armor at the stores(battle enemies then sell there shit) or from the gold chests in the dungeons if you have keys also its random what you get from them,  try fusing personas with physical resist or high endurance. Aries is a good persona with physical resist that you can get if anything look up fusion guides"

Megaten,3dv6ts,assassassin_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:42:52 2015 UTC,Look at the size of the shadows. If they are big and/or red they will be difficult. If they are medium size they are around your level. If they are tiny they are weaker than you.  If they are too big go back to previous dungeons or floors to grind.

Megaten,3dv6ts,nin_ninja,7,Tue Jul 21 02:03:54 2015 UTC,"Use teddy often, scan enemies to check their weakness and then hit them with the appropriate element.The key to get fast battles is to knock all opponents down and finish them with the all out attack.Level up xour social links to gain faster persona levels."
Megaten,3dv6ts,MelonNinja,2,Sun Jul 19 20:14:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the serious response. What do I do if they don't have a weakness? And I also feel like I'm using a lot of SP. Anything I can do about that?
Megaten,3dv6ts,Bluezrhap,4,Sun Jul 19 20:39:39 2015 UTC,If they don't have a weakness use physical skills like bash instead of magic. Physical skills cost hp while magic costs sp. And it only costs 3 sp to heal a decent amount of hp.
Megaten,3dv6ts,Bluezrhap,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:16:06 2015 UTC,What about reclaiming SP? I've got TaP soda and soul drops but they both only restore 10.
Megaten,3dv6ts,Bluezrhap,3,Sun Jul 19 21:26:57 2015 UTC,"Yup, you can use items, tap soda is good because you can stock up on it once a week. Your best bet is picking the chalice card in shuffle time (assuming you're playing Golden.) The fox is a good option too, but it can be expensive if your Hermit social link isn't high enough. Otherwise you could just leave the dungeon and come back the next day."
Megaten,3dv6ts,Illidan1943,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:36:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm on regular Persona 4, not golden. Thanks!"
Megaten,3dv6ts,ifancytacos,3,Sun Jul 19 21:39:23 2015 UTC,Persona 4 is harder because SP recovery is much more difficult in that game (plus the more difficult bosses all around and the fact you can't choose the skills when making a new persona).  If you can try and do the Fox's SL as quickly as possible as he is really needed in that game (until late game when SP recovery is a skill you can get).
Megaten,3dv6ts,ifancytacos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:31:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've done a couple of the fox quests. Definitely need to do more, but I think I'm at an okay place with him now."

Megaten,3dv6ts,LvLupXD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:56:22 2015 UTC,"Here's what I did. When my party was about to run out of sp in 3-4 battles, I encountered a few battles, or went to a much easier dungeon and did the shuffle time, picking a persona or blank card. Then If I saw the card judgement or death, I would take that chance. Upright judgement restores all of your party's sp and upright death restores all of your party's sp, but drops their health to 1 and kicks you out of the dungeon. From there I would heal up using dia spells. This is how I could grind in a dungeon for hours and clear them in 1 day."

Megaten,3dv6ts,nin_ninja,2,Sun Jul 19 22:02:52 2015 UTC,"Use items, talk to the fox. Do his social link to make SP cheaper. You'll always have enough money for it if you keep fighting.  If they don't have a weakness, then just hit them until they're dead. It's not like hitting them with something that isn't their weakness completely fucks you over."
Megaten,3dv6ts,assassassin_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"Certainly, I'm just taking a lot of damage especially against Bribed Fuzz shadows."
Megaten,3dv6ts,LvLupXD,2,Sun Jul 19 21:26:19 2015 UTC,So be prepared to heal it off and take them out first. The game will never throw something at you that you can't handle.

Megaten,3dv6ts,Norix596,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:32:27 2015 UTC,"SMT games want you to use a ton of mana/sp, don't worry about it, it's a way to pace the player so that they don't get bored for dungeoning too much  Don't use too much SP when you see enemies are so weak that you can easily kill them fast"
Megaten,3dv6ts,Norix596,7,Tue Jul 21 02:10:47 2015 UTC,"The big gimmick with persona combat is the ""1 More!"" you get when you exploit a weakness. If you hit an enemy with their weakness, they fall down, if all enemies fall down, you can get an all out attack that does good damage to everyone. If you hit a fallen enemy with their weakness again it can dizzy them, skipping their next turn.  Now, to make sure you're the right level, just completely explore the entire dungeon and fight every enemy. This will put you AROUND the correct level for the entire game, if things feel too hard, feel free to grind.  You get plenty of time to explore the TV, so I say to just go all out and use up all of your SP and when you run out and can't fight anymore, use a Goho-M to leave the dungeon and exit the TV. As an experienced player, I like to do the dungeons all in one day, but I don't recommend doing that until you've got a firm grasp on the combat system.  You can look up enemy weaknesses online so you don't have to trial and error it. No this isn't cheating, this is called SP conservation and there is no shame in it.  You should try and do the Fox social link as well. Not only does it make him cheaper, but they're fun little sidequests. They often span over a couple days, but only the last day when you return the ema to the fox actually consumes time.  And lastly, ignore the people that are saying git gud or judging you for playing persona. Persona 4 is a great game and can be hard when you first get into it. The early bosses are not forgiving and if you're not used to games that push you like that, it can be frustrating. Just keep playing, you'll get the hang of it."

Also the 5th floor of Kanji's dungeon tends to have an abundance of Golden Hands (at least on Golden, don't remember if its true with the original) which are these tough enemies worth a lot of gold and exp. Its good to farm them since they will pretty much give you a level up and money for the fox"

Megaten,3dv6ts,Zangam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:23:24 2015 UTC,"Avoid elements since they often are resistant to them. Your best bet is to use Chie or the MC and use physical attacks since if you can critical hit them it'll lead to the 1 MORE and they are much weaker when downed.  The hands are a type of JRPG enemy that shows up a lot where they have insanely high defences, but like 10 health and give a lot of exp and money.  EDIT: Also I forget if they are in the original this early, but any skills that raise critical hits, accuracy, and lower enemy evasion are good too. Yosuke would have them"

Megaten,3dv6ts,Yukiko_Amagi,3,Mon Jul 20 04:55:44 2015 UTC,"Most of the time you should be trying to hit the enemy's weakness. Your goal is to get an all out attack, so once you knock one enemy down focus on knocking down the others. If you don't know an enemy's weakness, you just have to experiment and keep using different stuff till you find it. If an enemy doesn't have a weakness, you should use physical Persona skills (like bash, skewer, etc) instead of regular attack. Basically you should never use the regular attack command. This helps save SP, because you can usually heal the recoil damage from multiple physical skill attacks with one dia or media, where you'd have to use multiple magic attacks to do the same amount of damage. (For example, 3 cleaves + 1 dia = 3 sp, while 3 agi's = 12 sp.) But you should only do this when the enemy doesn't have a weakness, or if it's an element that you don't have."
Megaten,3dv6ts,SCO_1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:46:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that's super helpful!"
Megaten,3dv6ts,cuntscicle64,2,Sun Jul 19 21:28:01 2015 UTC,"For the enemies that aren't weak to anything, try instant kill spells like Hama and Mudo.  They won't always hit, but your chances of success with instant kill spells increases if the enemy is weak."
Megaten,3dv6ts,IzanApollo,2,Sun Jul 19 21:59:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah basically every time you encounter an enemy, try using every damage type you can against it. Even if it dies, that next time you encounter that enemy type, use Teddie Scan to see what types you haven't used yet, until you find a weakness. Then, to the best of your ability always use the element that the enemies are weak to so they they get knocked down and give you extra turns like you learned about in the tutorial, and when all enemies are knocked down you get to trigger an ""all out attack"" which does heavy damage to all enemies. One you do that the typical battle goes like this - ""ok those enemies are weak to fire, have my MC switch to a persona that has an aoe (or even single target I guess) fire attack"", knock all enemies over, then do an All out attack which should kill all enemies immediatly 95% of random battles. And as other people have said, leveling up the Fox S.Link for cheaper SP restoration (which translates into HP restoration too with healing spells) is of immense help."

Megaten,3dv6ts,Qwencex,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:14:36 2015 UTC,"Oh one more point, this was kinda implied in my and other advice but the greatest asset of the protagonist in this system is the ability to have access to lots of types of spells -- it's better for general purpose usage to have a persona that can use lower level spells of several elements that that specializes in one - at least until later on in the game when you have more slots for lots of personas and have more options available to you."
Megaten,3duxm2,Elvosz,16,Sun Jul 19 18:46:47 2015 UTC,Kanji's Takemikazuchi is how he sees Takemikazuchi.
Megaten,3duxm2,Bluezrhap,5,Sun Jul 19 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"The artbook is great because it points out that the reason the Personas look like they do is because the characters imagined they would be that way.   Yosuke thought ninjas hid well hence the camo scarf, and the wind element made him think of turbines.   Kanji thought his guy needed to be buff and because of the electricity his arms look like generators and the skull appears since it looks like a cartoon character getting shocked.  etc, etc, for each character"
Megaten,3duxm2,nin_ninja,3,Mon Jul 20 03:54:38 2015 UTC,"Oh damn i never thought of it that way, now we all know why Kamui has a rocket up his ass."
Megaten,3duxm2,ArnoldNorris,6,Mon Jul 20 15:42:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, so a Persona is basically a representation of how a person wants others to see them. Basically, each arcana represents a different type of personality, so depending on what your personality is, that's the persona you get. The more unique your personality is, the more unique your persona is and the less likely it is for someone else to have the same one. People with the wild card are an exception, since they can basically change their persona to whatever they want. So if the generic NPC's in the game had personas, I could definitely see some of them having the same ones. I think it's kind of similar to how shadows work. Most generic shadows all look the same, but once they become strong enough they become unique.   This is all my opinion, but look into the Jungian persona if you want to learn more about what Personas are based on.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(psychology)"
Megaten,3duxm2,assassassin_,12,Sun Jul 19 21:10:28 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""persona is a shadow.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a Kirijo scientist who studies shadows, I am telling you, specifically, in jungian mythology, no one calls personas shadows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""shadow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Demonae, which includes things from Archangels to Jacks to Moirae Sisters.  So your reasoning for calling a shaodw a persona is because random people ""call the black ones shadows?"" Let's get black samurai and blackfrost in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a persona user or a summoner? It's not one or the other, that's not how demonomony works. They're both. A persona is a persona and a member of the shadow family. But that's not what you said. You said a persona is a shadow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the shadow family shadows, which means you'd call jack frost, angel, and other demons, persona, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

Megaten,3duxm2,nin_ninja,2,Mon Jul 20 03:55:53 2015 UTC,"People possibly could have the same Persona, but since the Persona is just a manifestation of one's self and not the actual god/person/demon it takes its name after then its not like it would be conflicting for multiple people to have the same named persona.  However, they would look very different from each other because like I said a Persona is just one's reflected self. It mixes in traits of their personality and being with what they may sub-consciously assume that god/person/demon would be like.  Also there's the fact that Japan has so many deities and famous people to draw from to make Personas there's never gonna be a reason to give somebody a persona that has already been used before. I mean look at P5 MC's persona which is named after a book character from France."
Megaten,3duxm2,nin_ninja,2,Mon Jul 20 03:59:52 2015 UTC,"I think it quite probable that demons, personas and shadows in the settings don't exactly have singular bodies or even a singular existence, being more like a distributed system across universes of myth (hell, some myth figures subsumed and absorbed others even in 'real life').  What i do think separates these categories is the degree of self-determination. Minor shadows are feral and cunning, but not exactly verbal. Major shadows, like Ryoji are obviously on par with Demons in self-awareness - although, maybe not in self-determination (he 'had' to usher the Fall). Teddy seems to be free. Maybe he's well on his way to become a demon, or remember being one ;)  Personas barely seem sentient, being a integrated extension of a individual, instead of a rebellious one like free shadows (their art indicates individual 'tailoring' of the myth to the person).  Finally demons seem to be the most self aware of them all.  All of these have copies/avatars/incarnations/subsets everywhere, except Teddy (maybe the bodies count). Ryoji is both Thanatos, the appraiser, Pharos, part of Nyx, probably the Reaper, the twelve moon shadows and who the fuck knows. Trash mob shadows are obviously duplicated everywhere. Personas are fused and stored in compendiums and cards.  It all seems to indicate that Demons are 'collective' free-willed shadows that are too vast to be a 'facet' of a single person, and personas a singular part of that collective that can be tailored to a 'face'. Or some bullshit like that.  That in game, Personas will only talk when fused - even Thanatos - indicates that even more strongly. Maybe when you fuse or gain a persona in another way what is actually happening is that the reified concept accepts you as worthy of his retarded clone power instead of you discovering a facet of your self. Or what if there is no difference? ;)"
Megaten,3duxm2,SCO_1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:45:05 2015 UTC,"You're right, and you're friend is wrong. It is just a gameplay convention that there's only one of each persona in Q. There are several examples that I'm too lazy to list, but it would be pretty easy to find them on a wiki somewhere. The persona that appears is whichever one best fits the user's psyche/situation in life. Just like each social link loosely follows the ""story"" associated with the card. e.i. Tower=a fall from grace, Emperor=wanting to control your surroundings, etc. As for what they look like, that's partly based on what the user wants in life. Soejima said in the artbook that since Kanji wants to appear more manly, he made Take-Mikazuchi look like a macho-wrestler-dude, and Izanagi looks like a bancho cause you're the leader. The non-Soejima personae/demons are just based on how the demon traditionally is described as in mythology.    Hope that helps man!"
Megaten,3duxm2,dogman710,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:41 2015 UTC,"So, one of my questions is, can more than one person in the Persona universe share the exact same demon/persona?   Yes.  For example, in Persona 1 and 2, you can fight pixie demons and summon a pixie persona, etc..  I think there's a difference between the personas used by the Wild Card users, and a person's ""main"" persona.  The ones the wild card has are drawn from the collective unconscious, while the ""main"" ones are more molded to the individual, I feel.  Either that, or Take-Mikazuchi's design is purely a design thing, and it actually is the same Persona being used, it's just that the design of it changed over the course of the two games.  But if you were to see P3 MC and Kanji both summon Take-Mikazuchi in the same game, they would probably have the same design.  (That's probably why they avoided this in PQ, because it would make Kanji's persona appear less unique)   Also my other question regards to what personas are made from or how they come to be. I understand that personas/shadows are the manifestation or living embodiment of someones psyche. However, what I get confused on is if the personas are how an individual sees themselves. Say for instance Mitsuru. Does her persona look the way it does because of how she views herself? And how come Penthesilea is the demon that comes from her? Why didn't any other thing appear after she used the evoker for the first time?    It probably includes that, among many things.  But it's not like a Persona's appearance comes purely from its holder's imagination.  They draw on the collective unconscious.  I doubt everyone with a persona is secretly really fond of mythology and knows all about the legend behind their persona.  The ideas of the demons come from the collective thoughts of everybody.  For example, the P4 protag probably didn't even know who Izanagi was until the lecture with Edogawa.  So he wouldn't have had a ""mental image"" of what Izanagi looks like.  Izanagi's appearance comes more from a combination of Izanagi's legend, and the Protagonist's personality."

Megaten,3duxm2,HolyKnightPrime,-5,Sun Jul 19 19:15:54 2015 UTC,"TLDR: can two people have the same persona and if they can does it have to look different from another person  with the same persona, and is the design of a persona based on how that person views themselves.   And if you're too lazy to read my TLDR then read the first sentence, aside from that you should get sticky next time."

Megaten,3dr8o9,TylerTheDragon,3,Sun Jul 19 05:07:57 2015 UTC,"Real talk for a bit. Lets briefly live in a world where Catherine 2 could be a thing.  New Stages, New block types and power ups. Maybe a block that will warp you to a sister block that is close by, or a block that can be walked through AND can be stood upon but not moved.   Maybe have a power up that lets you push a block once from afar, or one that temporarily freezes over a row of blocks or something. Maybe be able to play as Various members of the cast each having slight differences in speed in movement, climbing or pushing. (though I sort of like the idea of both players having the same rule kit.)   It's a very unique take on what one might consider to be a fighting game. It has some merit for being updated in some fashion. I'd love to see even something as silly as a stand-alone version of the multi-player."
Megaten,3dr8o9,Ardailec,4,Sun Jul 19 06:14:48 2015 UTC,"There's so much they can do with a sequel. They don't even need a story, a single player and multiplayer mode is enough...

Megaten,3dqn4m,JimmyFatts,9,Sun Jul 19 00:00:04 2015 UTC,My favorite match was that Margaret-Tahichi/Aigis-Koichi matchup - super high intensity.
Megaten,3dqn4m,Norix596,8,Sat Jul 18 16:35:07 2015 UTC,"Man was it ever. Best match of the day, without a doubt. Tahichi's Margaret is super impressive to watch, and his fucking blocking was on point the whole time. It's a shame that this level of P4AU is rarely seen, and will only decline as the game gets older. Oh well.   Thanks for the VOD Link /u/PaladinJoe!"
Megaten,3dqn4m,ColdBlackCage,4,Sat Jul 18 18:36:11 2015 UTC,It's sort of a shame by comparison that the grand finals were rather one-sided. At least in my book that makes them relatively less exciting to watch.

Tahichi just couldn't find the space to get something out most of the time, and Superboy was just so clean, you can tell from the first round he was on game - Superboy only went below 50% health once.  Matches like that are exciting in the moment, but really unsatisfying afterwards though, I agree."

Megaten,3dqn4m,nin_ninja,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:50:04 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that a lot of people, like myself, played it more because it was a Persona game and not because it was a fighting game.

Megaten,3dsvc3,auragar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:48:40 2015 UTC,It could be male or female. It could be a kilt rather than a dress. And I might be wrong but isn't a dress a full garment from the looks it would a skirt which is a separate garment from the shirt/blouse.
Megaten,3dsvc3,auragar,2,Sun Jul 19 05:02:02 2015 UTC,Yeah the axe mirage is in shadows on the site. And I don't think Tiki is related to a Cathedral of Shadows type system due to the fact that there are no demons in this game.
Megaten,3dsvc3,auragar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:51:40 2015 UTC,"By cathedral of shadows I meant the system of gaining new mirages. Not literally the cathedral of shadows, just whatever the mirage equivalent is."
Megaten,3dsvc3,auragar,0,Sun Jul 19 05:23:28 2015 UTC,I understand. There still won't be a system like that. The mirage you have is the one you are stuck with. The way new characters obtain their mirage is through a battle with them to subdue them.
Megaten,3dsvc3,auragar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:36:52 2015 UTC,"Well in the trailer we see a completely new mirage holding the same spear as the dude with red hair, so either we can get new mirages or mirages can promote. Either way, we'll have to wait and see, but that's just the vibe I get from Tiki and that altar."
Megaten,3dsvc3,auragar,0,Sun Jul 19 20:51:31 2015 UTC,"If you could get me a picture of that, that would be helpful. Considering this is a sort of crossover between SMT and FE, and mirages are based more on FE, I would say of those two options the more likely is promotion. Though I doubt either of those, but I could be wrong, and the picture of the ""new"" mirage would be helpful."

Megaten,3dt3am,cuntscicle64,-3,Sun Jul 19 15:47:02 2015 UTC,"That's a boldfaced lie. Nocturne is praised out the ass in here, and while not as bad as Illusoiry Revelations #FE, Persona is definitely put down a lot more than other games, such as games from the SMT family."

Megaten,3dt3am,Bluezrhap,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:32:48 2015 UTC,"Persona 2 is circlejerked pretty well here. 90% of those who do circlejerk it haven't played it. P3 is my favorite. P1 is just there for some. And P4 is either the casuals who love it and haven't played any thing else, or the true true goddess reincarnation fans who hate it for being popurar  Nocturne is a god tier game which you probably haven't played since there aren't social links and ""it's too hard"" right?"
Megaten,3dt3am,DaLinkster,0,Sun Jul 19 05:42:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you still haven't finished it, have you?"
Megaten,3dt3am,Bluezrhap,-3,Sun Jul 19 05:50:59 2015 UTC,"Persona 2 is circlejerked amongst fans of Persona because people want to feel elite. Most people here feel that eliteness by acting like Persona is trash when it isn't. P3 is definitely the best Persona so far (P5 is looking better so far imo.) 1 is eh, not bad, but not great either. 4 is alright, and far too popular amongst Persona fans, but eh it has helped the series and Atlus in the long run so I am not too upset, especially since they will finally be moving on from P4 now thank the gods.  I've played Nocturne, I am not a false fan who only plays Persona. Don't try to lump me into groups I am not in. This is one of the reasons I hate you, you are a literal piece of trash and assume things and shitpost more than anybody else I have seen here."

Megaten,3dt3am,NeoLeo2143,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't really mean it, I just thought it was funny and somewhat fitting. I don't think anybody here criticizes games they haven't played. Or at least I hope so."
Megaten,3dt3am,DaLinkster,6,Sun Jul 19 18:28:29 2015 UTC,"Once you're familiar with the games, maybe you'll understand why there are a few people who are upset about the looks of Ginei Ibunroku # FE. I'm not, but the point is play a real Shin Magoomy Tensay game like Nocturne and Strange Journey.  Welcome to the club man, have fun.  Besides, the thread here isn't to whine about the game itself, it's to whine about how the commentator doesn't have any idea what he's talking about."
Megaten,3dt3am,Bluezrhap,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:32:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll try to get into them as best I can.   I can sorta see the hate, such as the gameplay differences like social links, the less mature feeling of the game, an visual novel style, slow story pacing, and among other things.  I can see how the commentator isn't that great as I just looked at the wiki and saw his Jack Frost's name is Hee Ho in Japanese mistake, so I'm not going to take the video to greatly as a guide."
Megaten,3dt3am,Bluezrhap,3,Sun Jul 19 18:57:35 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what his idea of a mature story is coming from. Any story that makes some kinda social commentary can be thought of as mature in my opinion.
Megaten,3dt3am,Bluezrhap,2,Sun Jul 19 19:53:51 2015 UTC,"That's a good way to look at it, and that way of thinking would alleviate a lot of problems if more people thought like you about it.   But I'm talking about how less serious Persona looks. Bear in mind I never played the main line games so please correct me if I'm wrong because I'm going to base this off what I know about Persona4. For startes persona is more colorful and whimsical. Although serious events like death are in the game, Persona still manages to feel light hearted with the calendar chalk full of silly events fit for a slice of life anime. The dialogue although poetic at times are silly with phrases like ""Fsteaks"" and ""I'm renovate your ASS"", nothing wrong with that just another observation. I don't know much about the themes of the other games, but I hope they are more original and more thought out than ""reach out for the truth and learn to accept yourself""."
Megaten,3dt3am,ShinyProtagonist,2,Sun Jul 19 20:04:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true enough.  Hyperdimension Neptunia makes a social commentary about the console wars.  I know it's a parody and it's self aware when it's juvenile. It's serious in that regard. But the tone? The tone and presentation are radically different is what I'm getting at. The tone of HDN is incredibly weird and silly, even if at heart it's a self-aware parody/commentary."

You can't call yourself a True Fate Fan unless you've read it three times. Once in it's original unpatched PC state. Once with the old Realta Nua patch that only added the music and voices and CGs without removing anything. And once again with the recent Realta Nua patch that has the alt scenes from the PS2/Vita versions.

Megaten,3dwa1y,Please_PM_your_b00bs,7,Mon Jul 20 03:07:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really isn't widespread at all. Besides, if I can google you're ""meme"" and not find a single result, then it isn't really a meme."
Megaten,3dwa1y,Please_PM_your_b00bs,-15,Mon Jul 20 03:14:44 2015 UTC,Please stop harassing me.
Megaten,3dwa1y,Please_PM_your_b00bs,6,Mon Jul 20 03:15:45 2015 UTC,I'd hardly call two comments harassment but okay.
Megaten,3dwa1y,Please_PM_your_b00bs,-14,Mon Jul 20 03:29:24 2015 UTC,Look I already reported you so you might as well just stop. This isn't going to end well nerd.
Megaten,3dwa1y,Ehkoe,8,Mon Jul 20 03:30:28 2015 UTC,"I feel like unnecessary reporting is closer to harassment than saying your joke isn't as common as you seem to think, but okay."
Megaten,3dwa1y,Harry-kun,-12,Mon Jul 20 03:37:11 2015 UTC,"Unnecessary? The proof is all over this thread. You can't escape what's coming to you. I suggested the mods contact the police as well, which they probably will. What you're doing is taken seriously around here and if you think the internet is truly anonymous then you screwed up big time pal. Good luck."
Megaten,3dwa1y,DenkouNova,7,Mon Jul 20 03:57:59 2015 UTC,"You lost me. What did I do to you, again?"
Megaten,3dwa1y,aLolipopPrince,-8,Mon Jul 20 04:01:54 2015 UTC,"I don't have anything left to say to you. I've asked you to stop harassing me several times now and you insist on continuing. I'll let the mods and police take over from here, no matter how much you keep harassing me I will not respond."
Megaten,3dwa1y,MinatoHikari,3,Mon Jul 20 04:05:26 2015 UTC,Clearly it's not that well spread if people outside our shitpost circlejerk here didn't get it.
Megaten,3dwa1y,IzanApollo,16,Mon Jul 20 07:12:43 2015 UTC,Okay.
Megaten,3dwa1y,cuntscicle64,10,Mon Jul 20 02:14:14 2015 UTC,"I know 5-6 people that have played Megatens but they don't come here, and none would be able to say that this was a joke.  I think the most important part here is that Poe's law is in full action here. There's just no way to tell whether someone saying that is genuinely an asshole or just some person screwing around by pretending to be an asshole. So it's a bit dangerous to do that kind of jest.  Maybe it would have been better to pretend you own an Adachi hug pillow. I don't pretend that personally, because I really own an Adachi hug pillow.  I don't.  I do, actually.  Just kidding I don't.  I don't know."

Megaten,3dpvxl,PaladinJoe,6,Sat Jul 18 08:45:33 2015 UTC,"Of course, but you have to admire his dedication. Labrys is bottom tier."
Megaten,3dpvxl,Cyclone-,3,Sat Jul 18 08:54:56 2015 UTC,"Look, just because she has very slow normals, some of the worst defensive options in the game, and requires momentum to do real damage, doesn't mean people can't do well with her.         Oh, you aren't talking about gameplay tier lists, are you?"
Megaten,3dpvxl,PaladinJoe,2,Sun Jul 19 08:02:10 2015 UTC,"That actually is what I meant. I'd never call Labrys bottom tier when not referring to gameplay, her accent is too cute."
Megaten,3dpvxl,ArnoldNorris,6,Sun Jul 19 14:58:18 2015 UTC,She has tough competition admittedly.

Megaten,3dpvxl,CplGunshow,-1,Sat Jul 18 09:08:26 2015 UTC,Mettis has no reason to exist.
Megaten,3dpvxl,PaladinJoe,10,Sat Jul 18 15:11:35 2015 UTC,Yes she does. She is there to further prove that Labrys is bottom tier. Here is the Robo tier list Aigis > Metis > my toaster > my fridge > Labrys.
Megaten,3dpvxl,ArnoldNorris,7,Sat Jul 18 15:16:23 2015 UTC,You rate your toaster and fridge lower than some crappy robo plot device? Things my toaster and fridge do:   Toast my bread Keep my food fresh Help me cool down when I'm really hot on a Summers day and decide to stick my head in the fridge to feel like I belong on planet earth Give me something to look at when I walk into the kitchen when I'm not really hungry but still want to look at food for some unknown reason   Things Metis does:   Is a shit Doesn't fuck off Is a shit
Megaten,3dpvxl,Shinjiro_Aragaki,2,Sat Jul 18 18:27:10 2015 UTC,Lol those are great examples. I think you have convinced me. Aigis is still top tier Waifu though. The only reason I rate Metis highly is because her relationship with the one true Robo.

Megaten,3dpvxl,nin_ninja,5,Sat Jul 18 12:44:25 2015 UTC,I still cannot place that accent but it sounds so familiar to me.
Megaten,3dpvxl,Cyclone-,2,Sat Jul 18 13:45:18 2015 UTC,She sounds like the girl who takes pictures of crashes in Full Throttle.

Megaten,3doed7,SCO_1,5,Sat Jul 18 00:55:29 2015 UTC,Maken Shao   It was in europe thou. The cutscenes are in Nihon-go and subtitles in english.
Megaten,3doed7,brodo-swaggins-,4,Sat Jul 18 02:25:08 2015 UTC,So it doesn't have that corny dub? Aww
Megaten,3doed7,brodo-swaggins-,2,Sat Jul 18 05:59:34 2015 UTC,"Kei (the main character besides you know) sounds just as bad... It's actually amusing how bad i react to 99% of female Japanese vocals.  I'm always left thinking, 'this character can't possibly be this childish...', it's a stereotype that is really pandered to.

I would have gladly payed a few bucks more for a better cover but oh well, what can you do? Anyways enjoy the game as it's really good! Also a Dreamcast doesn't cost too much money, most now are about 20 to 40 bucks and the library is one of the most unique and fun for sure so it's definitely worth it :D"
Megaten,3doed7,Downeddragon,7,Sat Jul 18 01:44:09 2015 UTC,This game has amazingly bad dialog ( i watched a LP a while ago ).

Neat story, cool characters, awesome combat. Definitely a game to pick up for SMT fans (though it's a first person hack n slash but I would still recommend it)."
Megaten,3doed7,Contralto,3,Fri Jul 17 23:58:39 2015 UTC,"Huh, didn't know about this.   Might have to try picking it up sometime purely for collection as I don't own a Dreamcast(Would like one but it and good games for it is a bit too big investment right now)and it'll look good on a shelf."
Megaten,3doed7,Contralto,2,Sat Jul 18 01:37:06 2015 UTC,You can emulate the Maken Shao ps2 European version.

Megaten,3doed7,MachoFan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:25:41 2015 UTC,That's why I got it. And the little booklet.

Megaten,3doed7,badmisterfrosty,3,Sat Jul 18 01:09:10 2015 UTC,Yo! I found that game through the Wikia and that's what finally pushed me into getting a Dreamcast!
Megaten,3doed7,Captain-matt,3,Sat Jul 18 01:34:46 2015 UTC,That game was really good. I've been meaning to replay it soon.

Megaten,3dotyc,Ninto55,4,Sat Jul 18 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"His post Atlus work seems sad to me. A couple of PSP rpgs that don't seem that interesting (from what little I know), a couple of iphone games, and a cancelled wii space game that we know next to nothing about. The comments on that Siliconera article says he left after Nocturne failed. I was completely unaware that Nocturne had any problems when it first released. Hopefully Maniax helped somewhat, but it is sad that he left on what seems to be bad terms. We think of the PS2 as the golden age of SMT, but looking at the releases, besides Nocturne all of them stray away from SMT in some way. Digital Devil Saga is the to draw the Final Fantasy crowd in, Raidou is to give it more action, and Persona experimented with the school sim thing. Maybe this is part of why the Raidou version of Nocturne was packaged with Raidou 2, to try to get the people who only played Raidou 1 and 2 to try the turn based games.  I would love to learn more about how the games were received upon initial release. Today Nocturne is considered one of the greatest SMT games (even in Japan, remember we got interviews with those two new Atlus employees and they both spoke about how great Nocturne was?), but I guess it was just a commercial flop. Anyone know why?"
Megaten,3dotyc,brodo-swaggins-,3,Sat Jul 18 02:17:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think it was a flop commercially necessarily, I just guess he was disappointed that it didn't make the impact he wanted it to as I remember reading in an old interview that he really wanted to make megaten break into the mainstream by around the turn of the century and I think he thought nocturne was going to be the game that did that."
Megaten,3dotyc,Ninto55,2,Sat Jul 18 05:37:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes it sound so much sadder. I wonder how he feels about it now, with at least Persona becoming mainstream, with SMT4 getting a lot more attention."

It's been interesting, but I'm not entirely sure why he thought it needed a Dolly Kadmon or how he expected players to use it. I don't think ATLUS hasn't suffered too badly with him leaving, but SMT's definitely experienced some more creative free reign with him gone, for better or worse."

Megaten,3dlqu7,seynical,11,Fri Jul 17 09:45:23 2015 UTC,Was the biggest cause for its failure again? The memcard prices or the lack of actually worthwhile games for launch?
Megaten,3dlqu7,brodo-swaggins-,17,Fri Jul 17 10:26:58 2015 UTC,"Far more the second than the first. although the rise of smart phone ""games"" was almost certainly a factor in what caused the lack of games in the first place."

Megaten,3dlqu7,-J_C-,8,Fri Jul 17 17:28:40 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm concerned, good games are good games. Whether they're exclusive or not doesn't matter.

Let alone all of the great PS1 and PSP games."
Megaten,3dlqu7,Purrrrsona,4,Fri Jul 17 17:38:34 2015 UTC,"I bought the Vita for MGS HD collection alone, a couple games I'd already played through 1000 times as it is. Not only had I enjoyed them again, but I'd also discovered quite a variety of other games as well. Games I probably wouldn't have found otherwise. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the Vita, its a shame that it may just end up being the Dreamcast of portable systems."
Megaten,3dlqu7,-J_C-,2,Fri Jul 17 17:48:58 2015 UTC,Doesn't that title go to the neo geo pocket or the game gear?
Megaten,3dlqu7,brodo-swaggins-,7,Fri Jul 17 18:03:30 2015 UTC,It's a bit unfortunate that the systems power isn't going to use with a lot of games that are mostly very low budget niche Japanese niche games (not that I don't like those) when there seemed to be some promising visuals in some games earlier in the vitas life
Megaten,3dlqu7,brodo-swaggins-,10,Fri Jul 17 10:46:42 2015 UTC,"I think one of the main flaws of the Vita is that nobody really knew where they were going with it. Like, is it supposed to be a full-on ""nearly-living-room"" level portable console? That explains the battery life, etc, but no one really wants to develop ""living-room"" games for portable consoles (does it really make sense anyway???). Is it full ""anymay-wtf-japan-seriously"" games? But some of those had ties with Nintendo so it wouldn't really reign over that market.  In the end I think everyone was pretty confused. OTOH, the DS/3DS had their solid lineups (lots of good ole Nintendo franchises + a certain number of carefully chosen exclusives, the biggest of which being Monster Hunter imo). They were the go-to system for portable gaming, and Nintendo's historical stance also helps in that (I mean, the PSP kinda had the same problem so Sony didn't get the same aura that they were able to achieve with the PS1 for living room consoles).  Mobile phone gaming hit hard on both Nintendo and Sony's handheld plans though, so I don't know what they're going to be looking at in the future. Nintendo's New 3DS seems like an enormous bullshit and I really don't know what they intend to do with it. Sony doesn't seem to be in a hurry to replace the Vita (and I mean, who would blame them). I guess everyone's kinda wondering where the market is headed. I'd hate for handhelds to die, though, I hate playing on my cellphone and I prefer to keep it separated..."

Megaten,3dlqu7,brodo-swaggins-,2,Fri Jul 17 12:41:39 2015 UTC,I hate playing on my cellphone   The most annoying thing to me is that we're also seeing more and more phones without removable storage. It doesn't take that many vita sized games to eat up storage space.   That and how many people seem to still see gamepad support in their smartphone games as a secondary concern at best.

Megaten,3dozel,GozuTennoh,19,Sat Jul 18 02:53:34 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""persona is a shadow.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a Kirijo scientist who studies shadows, I am telling you, specifically, in jungian mythology, no one calls personas shadows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""shadow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Demonae, which includes things from Archangels to Jacks to Moirae Sisters.  So your reasoning for calling a shaodw a persona is because random people ""call the black ones shadows?"" Let's get black samurai and blackfrost in there, then, too.  Also, calling someone a persona user or a summoner? It's not one or the other, that's not how demonomony works. They're both. A persona is a persona and a member of the shadow family. But that's not what you said. You said a persona is a shadow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the shadow family shadows, which means you'd call jack frost, angel, and other demons, persona, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

Megaten,3dozel,DenkouNova,2,Sat Jul 18 11:46:56 2015 UTC,Anybody want to give me a quick refresh on Jungian psychology?  All I remember from Psych was that he was some dude from Switzerland.
Megaten,3dozel,arayofhope,2,Sat Jul 18 06:27:40 2015 UTC,"Basically, his main theory was that all humans shared some collective programming of specific themes, which he referred to as archetypes, that as a collective, he referred to as the collective unconscious, and these were cross-cultural and universal.  Archetype examples include ""The wise old woman"", ""the giant"", ""the innocent"", etc.  A lot of that ties in with the tarot motifs in Persona.  Beyond that he had a theory on personality formation that in front of our true self, we had facade of public behavior that was our ""Persona"".  There were both risks and rewards to breaking it, but it was also risky to NOT break it, so the crux of a lot of Jungian therapy is actually the deconstruction and reformation of the Persona in order to better reflect the true self in a society-appropriate manner.  The gulf between a poorly conceived persona and the true self was the shadow, and it led to trouble."

But the only thing I could find about Dennou Eizo Seisakusho Ltd. is that they made a game called Hellnight (side note: Don't stare at Mika's chest) which was some weird first person survival horror game. It was also published by Atlus, but Konami published the EU version. The thing is, according to the wikipedia page it was developed by Atlus. I can find no other information about Dennou Eizo Seisakusho Ltd., google quickly turns into the weird shit that looks like a computer generated it from a bunch of public documents. Weird shit.  deSPIRIA looks cool too, but it isn't in English. Looks to be the same engine as Hellnight but with RPG combat.  What a weird set of games. You ever play this OP, or did you just look into obscure Atlus games after the Maken post? I would love to hear your experiences."
Megaten,3dozcu,Ninto55,4,Sat Jul 18 02:50:28 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! My friend being a heavy importer and knowing I'm a huge Atlus fan showed me this game a while back. I remember it being one of the coolest and oddest experiences I've had with gaming (other than maybe LSD on ps1). I'm not one who imports often as I don't understand the language. I watched him play through and it was really weird because it felt so ""immersive"" even though I had no clue what was going on. It was just so bizarre and surreal that I really wanted it to come out in English but of course that never happened. So I thought I'd share it with the Megaten community as I had forgotten about it for a while until I saw the Maken X post."

Easier to get rekt (when you get the chip that lets you save anywhere equip that shit and never let it go), but easier to take care of enemies too.  Mostly because of Nemissa.  Focus on vitality, Strength, and Agility on MC with most in STR, and for Nemissa just dump points into magic and intelligence, with enough agility to attack early in the turn and enough vitality to not die easily. MC can't use magic, by the way. Only Nemissa can. Never run from random battles or you'll run out of MAG. Keep fighting and you'll have a ridiculous excess. When prompted early in the game, say Hitomi is sexy. That makes Nemissa learn electric skills and that's really helpful in this game. That's about all you need to know going in, have fun dude."

Megaten,3dikdh,Brlghtslde,4,Thu Jul 16 19:05:03 2015 UTC,It's really really good. There's really only two major problems with the game one of which will be fixed by the time it becomes relevant to you. The first of which is this game starts out really slow combat wise. I mean really slow. Like for example the class lancer? You will likely be spamming one ability in dungeons and 2-3 outside of dungeons until your mid 30's. Other classes have something similar as a problem but not nearly as pronounced as lancer.  The second major problem is right now lack of end game content. It's very easy to to just catch up to endgame right now with it being a new expansion and SE slow rolling content. But like I mentioned by the time you reach max level that complaint will no longer be relevant.   Other then that though I think XIV is at the apex for being the best mmo on the market right now or for the last five years and heavensward has a very BC WoW feel to it. I suspect the only reason why it's pop #s can't compete with wow is mostly wow's inertia and that the mmo market is drying up.
Megaten,3dikdh,Rari-Roro,2,Thu Jul 16 19:35:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I haven't had this much fun with an MMO since WotLK.  It's solid on all levels, aside from early leveling. The music is fantastic, the story is great outside of a few slogs (looking at YOU level 30), the world is beautiful and every area sees use in some form or another.  Oh, and being able to level every class on one character is amazing."

Megaten,3dlv6c,filthyblasphemer,8,Fri Jul 17 13:00:20 2015 UTC,"I'd rather it continue to be an action-RPG series.

Megaten,3dkm8u,sarinn13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:30:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's just because P4 has pacing issues. The entire game consisted of a ""Hurry up and wait"" feeling.

Megaten,3dkm8u,awesomejp,2,Fri Jul 17 04:00:35 2015 UTC,"have fun running around the world map and potentially getting into a building with level 40+ enemies at early game when you're only around level 20 if you're not gonna use guides to at least know where to go next. I mean yeah, it's possible but it's gonna be composed of running around aimlessly, SMT2 is a bit more clear on objectives so far at least."
Megaten,3dkm8u,Ninto55,2,Fri Jul 17 04:58:45 2015 UTC,"That building with the high leveled demons was great though. Nerve bullets still kill most everything in there, and you get like three levels per fight at first. If final bosses could be hit by status ailments, you could kill them from level 1 with nerve bullets."
Megaten,3dkm8u,awesomejp,2,Fri Jul 17 13:39:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried my luck out once and tried killing at least one encounter and killed around 4 Rakshasas and got around 2-3 levels from that one encounter all with the help of nerve bullets.    If final bosses could be hit by status ailments, you could kill them from level 1 with nerve bullets.   If only success rate was enough to guarantee that. I remember charming SJ last boss tho, pretty good experience."
Megaten,3dkm8u,Ninto55,2,Fri Jul 17 13:50:20 2015 UTC,You can charm the SJ last boss? Good to know. I probably never would have tried.

Megaten,3dkm8u,filthyblasphemer,3,Fri Jul 17 07:13:06 2015 UTC,"The first SMT. Getting back into the franchise after a long hiatus. I plan to truck through the remaining games that I haven't beaten, starting with SMT and SMT 2, most likely."
Megaten,3dkm8u,sarinn13,3,Fri Jul 17 02:56:29 2015 UTC,"Just finished DeSu2: RB.  I was a bit disappointed with it. From everything that I had heard, I was expecting something on the level of Final Fantasy Tactics, but instead got Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. The story was simple, and characters were flat (though I did like Fumi, Jungo and Daichi). Combat was ok, but felt a bit broken when it came to being able to attack at range, and I had to spend a few hours grinding free battles at the end as I was waaaaay under leveled for the end boss.  It wasn't a horrible game, it just wasn't awesome either. I'm sure I'll go through NG+ sometime in the future when I have nothing else to play. I wouldn't mind checking out Overclocked, but after I'm not in a rush to run out and get it.  I still have to do the Triangulum Arc. I'm debating if I want to do that now, or maybe sometime down the road after going through NG+.  I've also started SMT IV, but am two hours into it, so can't make any decisions on the game yet."
Megaten,3dkm8u,awesomejp,2,Fri Jul 17 13:51:28 2015 UTC,"Definitely play DeSu1. It's a lot better in terms of theme, atmosphere, plot and characters as alignment representations, which is something DeSu2 failed in. But expect a less polished combat system than DeSu2, which was the only thing DeSu2 did right, for me at least.   I feel that DeSu2 is a bad introduction to the Devil Survivor series because it was hardly about Devils nor Surviving and more on Fate and Aliens. DeSu1 on the other hand was all about Devil's and Surviving, and lime i said, better theme, atmosphere and plot because it is more similar to mainline SMT, while DeSu2 is a bit more like Persona3-4."
Megaten,3dkm8u,sarinn13,2,Fri Jul 17 16:29:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I'll pick up DeSu1 after I'm done SMT IV. I'm fine with a rougher combat system as long as the story is there!  Edit: The more I think about it, the more it seems like DeSu2 had all these good ideas, but no idea how to really implement them together lol"
Megaten,3dkm8u,magmafanatic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:49:00 2015 UTC,"I'd say the Triangulum Arc is worth it, if only for Keita's and Ronaldo's scenes, which made me like them a lot more. The stakes get raised further and the plot certainly gets convoluted, but I had fun with it.  It's not really epic all the way through, like other SMTs, but it's fun as hell.  Then again, I loved FFTA, so..."
Megaten,3dkm8u,Ninto55,2,Fri Jul 17 21:14:54 2015 UTC,"Finished Raidou 2! Man, the alignment had very little purpose in that game. It basically just decides whether spoiler or spoiler die, and hell spoiler and there is next to know difference between chaos and neutral. It felt kind of forced in there and pointless.  Started Strange Journey, it has been fun so far. I really like the general mood around with the only people you're interacting with are military people and everyone is here for the mission. Just started Sector B, so I haven't gotten far enough for the dungeon crawling to become bullshit yet. The fusion seems weird though. And demon co-op is better than I expected it to be, but it isn't as interesting as press turn. Hitting weaknesses does more damage, which is weird because they already do more damage. So the incentive of the demon co-op isn't to do more damage by hitting weaknesses, but it is to encourage you to have a party of the same alignment. Where as in most SMT games, it doesn't matter what alignment a demon is as long as you can summon it."
Megaten,3dkm8u,awesomejp,2,Fri Jul 17 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"I loved Bootes Boss a lot because of the topic he talks about. Bootes is pretty BS tho but not as much as two others. And I don't see how the fusion is weird, felt pretty normal to me. And yeah, Full team Demon Co-Op move is very useful for a lot of bosses and i really liked how SJ handled demon alignments."
Megaten,3dkm8u,Ninto55,2,Fri Jul 17 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"Played a bit more, and I think I'm saved right before the fight with Mitra. I just beat the invisible demon. Mitra already talked to me a bit before sending me back to the ship and it was interesting. I was kind of hoping they'd actually let me make an alignment decision about what to do, but it never even bothered to ask me. Also, I met Mastema, man that guy is shady as hell. Even without all the memes I probably would've realized that instantly.  And for the fusion thing, I was referring to how it seems like you can't reroll and the way that the demon sources work. I asked about it on the questions thread."
Megaten,3dkm8u,awesomejp,2,Fri Jul 17 03:54:11 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie, SJ was my first mainline after my fist MegaTen game(DeSu1) and I was Mastema's no. 1 follower. I even went full Law actually because I was a lawfag, until this one point in the game which just made me rethink my morals and all that. SJ is really a better entry point than Nocturne because it shows how alignments taken to the extremes play out, not to mention better negotiation and fusion mechanics. Playing Nocturne and so far I still don't know who's aligned with what. But it's pretty great so far"
Megaten,3dkm8u,Ninto55,2,Fri Jul 17 04:39:47 2015 UTC,"The alignments work very differently in Nocturne, especially because they aren't even alignments really. From the perspective of alignments, Nocturne is a terrible place to start off, because I think part of the point of Nocturne is to play with your expectations from SMT 1 and 2. From what little I know, SJ or SMT4 would be a better place to start with to get a handle on alignments, though Nocturne is still a great game to start with for other gameplay reasons. Also, thanks for answering the question. I'll try out using sources next time I fuse."
Megaten,3dkm8u,awesomejp,2,Fri Jul 17 04:46:54 2015 UTC,"BTW, to get sources you need to have that demon fully analyzed, then level it up. Other tips would be, to be patient with Sector 5, and don't feel guilty if you search maps of it because it's pretty BS. Anyway, have fun because SJ is really great."
Megaten,3dkm8u,ByakurenX,2,Fri Jul 17 04:56:24 2015 UTC,"Almost finished with P3P. I wish I had the means to play FES because I'll definitely play it for The Answer and other features. At least I can play again as FeMC.  When I get a PS3 for P5 and other megaten games, I'll probably get FES at some point."
Megaten,3dkm8u,BluCommander,2,Fri Jul 17 02:36:05 2015 UTC,"I just finished my first nocturne playthrough 2 days ago and got the neutral ending, which felt pretty rewarding.  I just ordered a flashcart that plays ds games on the 3ds, and I plan to get Strange Journey and play through that.  I will also get the Devil Survivor games on there, unless I decide I want to shell out the extra cash for Overclocked (I don't think it adds enough to be worth it though atm)  Pretty excited for Strange Journey.  I heard it was the ""true"" SMTIV so it should be fun.  I heard some of the dungeons get tedious, but I would say the same was true of nocturne.  I'll just find a walkthrough if it gets to the point where I stop enjoying figuring out the puzzles and such."

I highly recommend every SMT fan at least try it out at some point. Many might feel bogged down by the fact that the entire game is essentially one massive dungeon with different sections, but I thought it was a fun and interesting experience to see the origins of one of my favorite series.  I'm currently playing through the Megami Tensei II half and so far it's great. Much like SMT1, it's pretty difficult and requires you to really pay attention to what people say, but I'd definitely recommend it to ANY classic SMT fan. It's truly a genuine predecessor to mainline SMT, and features a lot of the gameplay and story elements found in later games, even moreso than Megami Tensei I did. Plus it's just dang fun to play."
Megaten,3dkm8u,Toidiedud,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:23:27 2015 UTC,"Playing Devil Survivor 2, enjoying it so far but I still wish it had a dang item system. Hopefully added for the third game.  Not sure how I feel about it so far v.s the first game(which I've played extensively and is probably one of my favorite SMT games)since I'm only on Day 4 but it feels a bit more sparse so far in terms of day to day content.  Though the whole mini-social link system with join cracking is fantastic and makes me wish it was patched into Overclocked.  Oh and I don't like the new auction at all but that's not too big a deal, hopefully the next game has some slight negotiation as well so you don't have to rely on auctions only."

You can make a good story with a new IP. Sequels are also easier to come up with in new IPs, and also nobody will go ""I don't wanna play because I haven't played the original games"".

Sorry for the bombardment of questions. I want to get a decent pair of headphones and I am making sure they are worth it before I dish out that much money. I like wearing my headphones as much as possible so I am just look for some that look nice and are durable. Thanks!
Megaten,3de71l,hmohamed11214,4,Wed Jul 15 19:09:37 2015 UTC,I wear them for pretty much everything. You can see right here on how they custom designs are. I made this via illustrator and sent it to them to put on the plates :D.  You can also get new plates if you want at a later date.    I actually forget sometimes that they are around my neck lol. They actually come with a hard headphones zipper case that protects them from any damage when traveling when you are not using them. I cannot recommend these enough.    Sound quality is the best I have ever heard really but I never used any other headphones other than the around this price range...but still the music quality is amazing.   They also have a professional quality Mic that can plug into the headset and use it for gaming.  It has its own volume control and works with PS4.  The mic is sold separately tho. It does come with a phone mic that doesn't really work well IMO.   My sister actually recommended me them since i was looking for a really good pair of comfy headphones.  These re definitely worth the money. Also the cable it comes with is extremely well made.

Megaten,3deczf,yuiokino,3,Wed Jul 15 21:51:57 2015 UTC,What apparently occurs during the Atlus game localisation process. Seriously SMTIV was never released physically but only as an eShop title in PAL territories. While US get the game cartridge and special editions as well.   -_-

Megaten,3dg93p,iwasannon,13,Thu Jul 16 01:02:14 2015 UTC,I recently finished watching Welcome to the NHK. Amazing anime.
Megaten,3dg93p,awesomejp,4,Thu Jul 16 01:08:57 2015 UTC,great. now watch Tatami Galaxy :D
Megaten,3dg93p,Harry-kun,3,Thu Jul 16 01:59:30 2015 UTC,"Damn that ending though I finished it recently to and  I would absolutely recommend reading the manga cause that ending just left me feeling empty, and just to give you a heads up the manga had the same depressing, naive tone of the show but it's a lot more intense.   Aside from that after I finished welcome to the N.H.K I watched Plastic Memories, and after that I watched Your lie in April, their both entertaining, happy yet depressing kind of shows but they really filled the gap that Welcome to the N.H.K left. So make sure to have lots of buckets so that your tears don't end up flooding your house.  Edit:Just to clarify I didn't mean empty in a bad way I just felt so connected to the characters that I really just wanted more, after all an ending with two remaining characters out of like, five really makes it an emotionally depressing ending , it really hit me hard, but in the end but I loved the show."

I have done some research on how to make a good podcast and it can get pretty extensive. You have to have art for it, equipment, social media, and good chemistry.  I personally don't have any equipment for it but, I can get some with a little time.  Have you thought about what direction you want to take it?  It has to have something that differentiates it for it to get even close to being reasonably popular. Since none of us here are E-famous I am guessing."

True Ending was actually as good as it was hyped up to be and i think it may be on my top 5 endings to anything. Just so many twists and turns, even when i saw something coming there was another twist to offset that. Still have a few questions about certain things, but i'm hoping that the next games have answers to those. But man what a game, totally recommend anyone who hasn't played it to pick it up.  Now i'm doing a blind play through of  VLR right now and so far  it's pretty good. spoiler. I also love that so far no one has ever brought up the fact that Alice is pretty much topless."

Well that definitely has me hyped, Anything that can top all the crazy shenanigans that happens in 999 has to be good. And yeah dude, i kind of had the same thing happen in 999 for me, and it was something that was kinda big. I decided to look  up fan art for the game, and there was a certain picture of a certain someone, and under that certain someone was the caption, ""OMG TOTAL RUSEMASTER"", which kind of led me to believe that this person was Zero.spoiler. But yeah, now i won't look up even art since the possibility of spoilers is always out there.  spoiler  Man i'm really hoping ZE3 will be good."
Megaten,3dg93p,ralexand,3,Thu Jul 16 05:26:17 2015 UTC,"Better than 999 is a matter of opinion I don't share. :D But you have to see for yourself! VLR at least has better gameplay because of reasons hehe. Also Zero Escape made me read Vonnegut's ""Cat's Cradle"", because ZE took Ice-9 from that book. Kurt Vonnegut is amazing and the ZE writer knew that."
Megaten,3dg93p,d6Rv7jckWmDBDXE,2,Thu Jul 16 13:58:14 2015 UTC,"I mean it fucker. Unless you have the actual vita/3ds in your goddamn hands I don't want to see you so much as mention the words ""virtues"" ""last"" or ""reward"".  Also, don't save during an escape section, it has the possibility to nuke your save."
Megaten,3dg93p,KoolaidLegend,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:36:46 2015 UTC,"Lol you don't have to worry about that, i'm aware that even the tiniest bit of info can ruin it.  And thanks for the info, that's good to know. Do you know if rotating saves would help? or does everything just get fucked?"
Megaten,3dg93p,BluCommander,2,Thu Jul 16 05:49:06 2015 UTC,"If you mean rotating saves in order to see all the different endings in VLR, that isn't necessary.  There are various points in time you can return to whenever you want, so having multiple saves at different sections aren't necessary."
Megaten,3dg93p,KoolaidLegend,2,Sat Jul 18 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"Actually i was referring to how he said there's a bug that nukes your save, so i was wondering if it just nuked one of the saves or all saves that i'd be rotating  (I know i didn't make that clear at  all :/). But i already looked it up and apparently it's only a problem for the physical 3DS version so i don't really have to worry since i'm using the Vita version.  But i wasn't aware that you could return to points in the game, so thanks for that! I was actually wondering if i had to play through paths again like 999, but now i know."
Megaten,3dg93p,nin_ninja,2,Sat Jul 18 04:32:42 2015 UTC,I have to finish VLR at some point. I did like 70% of that game without getting most of the endings. Its a really interesting game with a great cast and a super good sense of humour and feelings. Plus the cast of the game rivals Persona 3 and 4 in terms of how many good members it has (helps that most of them were VAs for a Persona game at some point or other).
Megaten,3dg93p,d6Rv7jckWmDBDXE,4,Thu Jul 16 12:59:31 2015 UTC,Just finished virtues last reward and was quite pleased with it. I felt it was even better than the first game. I really appreciate the attention to detail in so many facets of the game virtues last reward spoiler. I'm also happy that the game managed to avoid the plot holes the last game had spoiler.  Though it did have one pretty odd plot hole spoiler Though truly that one I'm more okay with.  Looking forward to the finale next year.
Megaten,3dg93p,bunker_man,3,Thu Jul 16 02:22:02 2015 UTC,"I don't get the plot hole of why dio was an asshole for no reason. He was trying to escape. Why not blend in instead of make everyone hate him? There's no way anyone would not pick betray against him past round 1. The only guess I can make is that his cult convinced him so much how inferior regular people were that he thought they were basically animals. But even that doesn't make sense, since its not like he struggled to see them as people or acted like he didn't know what communication was. The entire plot seems like they tried to make it as convoluted as possible but for no reason. Also, wasn't his cult not about them being better, but about them all being the same? Was his personality an act, or not?  In fact an easy way to not have everyone die is to point out to everyone before round one that anyone who picks betray first round no one will not betray against past then. And the only thing they can gain is maybe winning a round earlier but probably not. So they have nothing to gain. If they managed this for one round, no one would have any reason to in the next one since it would no longer save them time. And for round three no one would either. There aren't even any traps, and it was never implied there was a time limit either.  And why Did zero III need to act like an asshole too? So many things were totally arbitrary. And who would just ""not notice"" they were old. Or that things fell to the ground in an odd way."

Being shitty at academics?  My only comment on college living is, I hope you live in a single because fuck living in the same room as someone who you aren't really close with. I just awkwardly played vidya while my roommate was trying to sleep for two years. The second two years was so much better with a single I could do what I want in my room and not be judged by my walls.  Otherwise the nice thing about college (caskets too, shitty auto correct) is you should be able to find the small group of people who want to do things you like, music, gaming, computer science, whatever, and hang out with them."

I was hoping I'd get a solo dorm, but I got a suite with three other people and I'll be sharing a room with one of them. That is the part that gets me the most, just having to sleep in the same room with a stranger. Hopefully he isn't an asshole or anything."

Megaten,3dg93p,sendhelpto,4,Thu Jul 16 01:21:18 2015 UTC,"Hyrule Warriors, it's an extremely fun hack n' slash with a staggering amount of content, even without the DLC (which is modestly priced). The OST is also really good. DKCR:TF, great platformer with a solid challenge, though it's probably still kinda pricey. Pikmin 3, it's not as good as the second game, as it's shorter, but it's still a blast, and it's only ~$40 now I think. Wonderful 101, great challenging gameplay, very fun. Mario Kart 8, nothing more to say, if you like MK definitely grab it. It's another really fun entry to the series with an actual decent online multiplayer for once. NSMBU/NSLU, they may not be for everyone, but if you can get them cheap for ~$20 and you're not tired of Mario platformers then grab it.  Kirby and the Rainbow Curse, if you played Canvas Curse on the DS you'll like this, it's an alright game. SM3DW, it's a fun game, but also very easy. The only difficult levels would be the last extra worlds in all honesty. Yoshi's Woolly World, looks alright, but I haven't played it. Nintendoland, it's kinda fun if you have friends to shit around in it with and yell at each other. Game & Wario, it's shit, only grab it if it looks kinda interesting to you and if you can get it for <$10. LoZ:WW HD, same shit better graphics (kinda), if you liked WW and wanna play it in HD then grab this.   In the future there's Starfox Zero, XBCX, GI#FE, LoZ U, Mario Tennis U (more similar to the 3DS entry that 64, so not that good) and apparently the next proper 3D Mario entry, more similar to 64/Galaxy. Hopefully that helped, Wii U does have some solid games, but not that many, in all honesty."

Rather than unlocking endings by doing certain missions with certain items is gone and replaces it with NG+ modes that get way tougher on each playthrough.  3 went full on weeaboo."
Megaten,3dg93p,IzanApollo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:26:12 2015 UTC,How's the soundtrack? Like is there anything memorable at all? Song of Ancients alone sold me on NieR.
Megaten,3dg93p,CapnGregginz,2,Thu Jul 16 03:08:39 2015 UTC,"Growing Wings immediately comes to mind when I think of the soundtrack. The string section is what really drives most of the soundtrack and I love it. It's got a lot of looming and powerful tracks that really adds to the urgency of the plot. It loops a ton though, so it might get annoying for the longer levels."
Megaten,3dg93p,IzanApollo,2,Thu Jul 16 03:40:16 2015 UTC,It sounds like the singer in Growing Wings is also the same from NieR. I'm already sold on it.
Megaten,3dg93p,awesomejp,2,Thu Jul 16 03:52:02 2015 UTC,playing Drakengard1 a bit and so far it's Spam []+x:The Game. I hear it's got good plot though.
Megaten,3dg93p,IzanApollo,2,Thu Jul 16 02:07:03 2015 UTC,I've heard that the running theme for all the games is that almost if not all of the endings are bad. Didn't look into it though because spoilers.
Megaten,3dg93p,awesomejp,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:12:42 2015 UTC,"As much as I play any game for the plot, and am willing to trudge through anything, Drakengard 1 is pretty hard to trudge through for me. Maybe i'd put in a couple more hours before dropping or something"
Megaten,3dg93p,7mad,2,Thu Jul 16 02:32:59 2015 UTC,They are weird as fuck and they aren't that similar to NieR. They are still good games tho so yeah check em out.
Megaten,3dg93p,HumanGiant13,2,Thu Jul 16 06:36:06 2015 UTC,Can anybody recommend a super over the top anime like Gurren Lagann or Fooly Cooly? I've been wanting to find something like them that I haven't watched yet but nothing's really grabbed my attention yet.
Megaten,3dg93p,Ribose5,3,Thu Jul 16 02:57:08 2015 UTC,KLK is made by the people who made TTGL. I liked one and that got me into the other. I think they are both fantastic but there are a lot of people who would call my tastes shit. Try it at least.

Megaten,3dg93p,NebulaVII,2,Thu Jul 16 02:46:29 2015 UTC,"I mean here the Asado is way more popular, churrasco is kinda something you cook when you are too lazy to set up the entire BBQ. Lots of people say that, our übermensch cows are the best."

I felt that I was missing something like I could have enjoyed it more if I was a Gundam fan or had some experience with another Gundam series. I thought the animation sound was amazing and the dub was perfect. And those action scenes were godly but I dunno the actual story about Laplace's Box and characters weren't much of a hit with me. So...any Gundam fans here? Maybe I was ""missing"" something I'm not sure."
Megaten,3dg93p,renewedapathy,2,Thu Jul 16 01:20:05 2015 UTC,"In the end Gundam Unicorn amounts to nothing but the ride was enjoyable. Knowing the overarching plot makes it a bit better but also makes it a bit painful when you realize nothing changes.  There are characters that are hit-or-miss (Riddhe...) and the plot (when not worrying about what happens after Unicorn) is fine, but everything else is the tits."
Megaten,3dg93p,Akoto1,2,Thu Jul 16 01:48:57 2015 UTC,"In the words of a friend, Unicorn's story doesn't amount to anything if you don't know the rest of UC, but why care when there's Marida piloting Unicorn Banshee and some ridiculous fight scenes. I personally had the same experience as you, enjoyed it but didn't understand shit (well, not before the same friend gave me a huge lecture on the story of UC and everything that led up to Unicorn. Which I didn't want to hear, but oh well.)"
Megaten,3dg93p,nin_ninja,2,Thu Jul 16 01:58:17 2015 UTC,"Unicorn is weird because its part of Gundam's main timeline which is the UC timeline. There's tons of history in the UC timeline (like 5 shows, two movie remakes, two OVAs, and tons of material in books and whatnot) but Unicorn takes place so long after the fact it doesn't really matter a whole bunch if you haven't seen the stuff that came before it.  The issue I would see happening is that Unicorn is a great series for fans of the various mechs and seeing them or variations showing up and being used is great for those fans.  The other issue is that many people feel like Unicorn got a little stupidly powerful by the end, to the point of the ending suffering for it. This is not uncommon for Gundam, but it really serves as a parallel to other pilots who succeeded early on because of the suit but later on because of their skill."

The only one I've heard that is good is ffx hd which I've got though I hear a lot of the ps2 ports like mgs, ratchet and clank, etc. have big performance issues. Do any of you guys know which are generally the best of these hd ports?"
Megaten,3dg93p,7mad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:29:48 2015 UTC,P4G is obvious but other than that there really isn't a good port at all. How about games that aren't remasters? Want any recommendations of those?

Megaten,3dhwt0,Cumstack,-9,Thu Jul 16 12:28:19 2015 UTC,"All right, so? Catherine has demons in it, unlike #FE. Catherine's characters also make cameo appearances in a few Persona games. The only cameos in #FE are Fire Emblem characters.."
Megaten,3dhwt0,LightningLordL,21,Thu Jul 16 13:26:37 2015 UTC,"The only cameos in #FE are Fire Emblem characters..   Ahem Hee-ho has a cameo, which is more of a homage to smt than Teddie is."
Megaten,3dhwt0,capybaraluver,6,Thu Jul 16 13:48:48 2015 UTC,Does Hee-ho use the rapier he had in all the games?
Megaten,3dhwt0,LightningLordL,-7,Thu Jul 16 16:54:56 2015 UTC,Jack Frost on a billboard is now considered a cameo   Really?
Megaten,3dhwt0,gordallott,8,Thu Jul 16 14:10:52 2015 UTC,"K, not really a cameo, but a little reference. Still more of a megaten than catherine that has a little teddie easter egg, and gameplay nothing like Megaten. And cameos do not really make a game part of a series, I was just mentioning them because you did. Dante had an appearance in Nocturne, while DMC is not a megaten."
Megaten,3dhwt0,Harry-kun,10,Thu Jul 16 14:20:25 2015 UTC,you're assuming a lot from a game that hasn't come out yet
Megaten,3dhwt0,LightningLordL,2,Thu Jul 16 13:40:40 2015 UTC,"As I said before these games need a place to be discussed, it's a cross between Persona Megaten and Fire Emblem, so we have as much as a right to talk about it here as /r/fireemblem does and if  /r/Megaten doesn't discuss things regarding the game and /r/fireemblem doesn't then who will?"
Megaten,3dhwt0,Kazhero22,11,Thu Jul 16 14:08:29 2015 UTC,"It is a Megaten game as it uses spells from the game, and the battle system is influenced by it, and it takes some themes from Megaten. While they are small, there are still some. Heck, Demi-kids is considered a megaten but has a lighthearted story, and mostly uses different demon designs. Because it shares some elements with smt, it is considered megaten."
Megaten,3dhwt0,Sailor_Gallifrey,2,Thu Jul 16 13:50:40 2015 UTC,And because Shin Megami Tensei is right in the title.
Megaten,3dhwt0,magmafanatic,2,Thu Jul 16 20:43:39 2015 UTC,I'll take your word for it.
Megaten,3dhwt0,S-J-S,10,Fri Jul 17 00:02:55 2015 UTC,Because it IS a MegaTen game? Dumb question.
Megaten,3dhwt0,crimsonfist101,5,Thu Jul 16 16:28:45 2015 UTC,"It's not that it's not MegaTen. It is obviously that.  When you hear talk about what #FE isn't, it's usually being said that it's not SMT, which is true. SMT refers to the ""core"" franchise, which consists of similarly themed numerical entries to a franchise specifically labelled as ""Shin Megami Tensei"" in Japan, as well as Strange Journey. Games like Persona, Devil Survivor, etc. generally do not fall under the SMT header in Japan, and are instead just accepted as MegaTen.  At least, this is how it should be. Actually, we're seeing the developers of #FE confusingly refer to it as an SMT game in interviews, right after they clearly ditched their intentions to actually use SMT series characters as shown in the first ""trailer"". If this all sounds baffling to you, it's okay - it is to us too right now, and it poses some really weird questions about the future of SMT specifically."

Megaten,3dhwt0,ZenRain,3,Thu Jul 16 17:04:50 2015 UTC,Because your salty tears a delicious
Megaten,3dhwt0,SCO_1,2,Thu Jul 16 19:50:37 2015 UTC,"...because no matter how much you wish it wasn't, it's clearly a MegaTen game?  Not SMT, but definitely MegaTen."

Megaten,3dbolo,chnginthehouseofpies,3,Wed Jul 15 21:08:41 2015 UTC,RIP in peaces  Loved listening to these guys on the commute and grinding in SMT games.
Megaten,3dbolo,Yukiko_Amagi,2,Wed Jul 15 03:31:30 2015 UTC,SMT podcasts are dropping like flies
Megaten,3dbolo,PaladinJoe,3,Wed Jul 15 12:41:37 2015 UTC,Only SMT Network is left since S. Link FM covers all RPG's now :(. Thankfully they are my favorite though. I don't think they will be quiting any time soon. Everyone on it seems genually excited for Megaten still.
Megaten,3dbolo,brodo-swaggins-,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:20 2015 UTC,"Never heard of SMT network, what's it like? Is it similar to CoS in format and how many hosts are there in it?"
Megaten,3dbolo,PaladinJoe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:51:04 2015 UTC,Their are three host 1 male and 2 female. Usually they will talk about news first and then they answer fan questions. Occasionally their will be a interview with a VA. They got John(Atlus PR rep he is on all their YouTube videos) on the podcast a while ago which was cool. I like the personalities of the people that's what keeps me listening.
Megaten,3dbolo,filthyblasphemer,2,Wed Jul 15 23:05:29 2015 UTC,Anyone here thinking about starting a new one?
Megaten,3dbolo,HowardHeyman,2,Wed Jul 15 14:46:49 2015 UTC,"I was kinda, but need peeps."
Megaten,3dbolo,filthyblasphemer,3,Wed Jul 15 16:23:44 2015 UTC,Just make sure you choose someone you have chemistry with. I wouldn't want it to be awkward.
Megaten,3dbolo,mccartneytm,2,Wed Jul 15 17:59:36 2015 UTC,"I would volunteer since I have an alright voice and decent knowledge of SMT, but don't have much spare time. Try making a post asking for assistance."
Megaten,3dbolo,nyxcrisis,2,Wed Jul 15 16:39:35 2015 UTC,"I would also like to volunteer,  I have some times that won't work. But most of the time I am free."
Megaten,3dbolo,filthyblasphemer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:50:13 2015 UTC,"If be down to give it a shot, but we'd have to develop some rapport before we just jump in."
Megaten,3dbolo,cuntscicle64,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:15:54 2015 UTC,"Since I wrote that comment, me and some peeps from an SMT Facebook group are doing just that. We'll probably have our first episode today or tomorrow."

Megaten,3dbolo,PictoShark,3,Wed Jul 15 03:11:37 2015 UTC,didn't have the energy to keep making episodes and felt as if they talked enough about Megaten in podcast form.

Megaten,3dbomc,Rtyuiope,6,Wed Jul 15 00:50:41 2015 UTC,Wow this is awesome I remember really liking the story when played it about a year and half ago. Unfortunately my memory is shit and I dont remember a good chunck of the plot. So this was an amazing  refresher for me. Thank you.
Megaten,3dbomc,sourmilkandcereal,3,Wed Jul 15 01:16:53 2015 UTC,"So I may or may not be interested in playing Persona 2. Do I need to play persona 1 first, because unlike 3,4, and nocturne and smt4 which i have played, I've heard the story is actually continuous like DDS?"
Megaten,3dbomc,ChampionBeef,4,Wed Jul 15 02:07:45 2015 UTC,"A few of the cast members come back in P2 as minor characters (except Yukino who is a major character.) And the only other Nods to P1 are Philemon, Nyarlethotep, and the Velvet Room, other than that you don't need to play P1, and you can watch my other video covering P1's story if you still want to know what happens. I think you should at least try P1 but I'm not going to force you, it can be tedious to certain people."
Megaten,3dbomc,ChampionBeef,3,Wed Jul 15 02:11:21 2015 UTC,"well, i dont really like the first person dungeon crawler tbh. I tried a bit of strange jounrey and didn't like it for that reason. I believe P2 is different but I know P1 is first person crawler"
Megaten,3dbomc,HowardHeyman,3,Wed Jul 15 02:22:59 2015 UTC,He made a recap of the Persona 1 story if you're interested
Megaten,3dbomc,cuntscicle64,3,Wed Jul 15 02:28:47 2015 UTC,Muh story!  EP > IS

Megaten,3dbomc,ThatAeroGuy,2,Wed Jul 15 20:50:17 2015 UTC,"There were a few plot points and characters i had to leave out for time reasons but i tried to explain the game best as i can, hope you enjoy!"
Megaten,3dbomc,Goldreaver,2,Wed Jul 15 00:51:23 2015 UTC,I'm really glad to see a video explaining the plot. I did beat the game but I had to give it some big breaks between play sessions so by the end I kind of forgot the plot but I was to far to go back from the beginning.
Megaten,3dbomc,NebulaVII,2,Thu Jul 16 04:25:44 2015 UTC,"Really wish when they remade this game on PSP, they made the battle system a bit more fast-paced. Seriously, I remember playing the PS1 version and for some reason I remember it being faster than the PSP version. Not saying a P3 battle system, but just one that's easier to use."
