listentothis,3dxiv0,gingerballs45,19,Mon Jul 20 13:30:47 2015 UTC,It definitely has nu-jazz electronic feel.
listentothis,3dxiv0,Shizu_senpai,6,Mon Jul 20 13:40:36 2015 UTC,"I'm probabilly just not updated on music genre adjectives. Jazz is something very specific, i'm not a superstar musician but i know it pretty well and i can't hear any of the features through whom you recognize jazz music, in this piece i hear more of an electronic R&B feel or something like that.. but hey, i'm not gonna start an arguement just because of that, i just happen to point out things when is something which i care about, just that. I don't wanna sound like a ""music grammar nazi"" or something like that.."
listentothis,3dxiv0,gingerballs45,11,Mon Jul 20 14:54:05 2015 UTC,Nu-Jazz is more of an emulated jazz to me. It keeps similar scales and keys but it obviously more simplified. The main similarity between Jazz and Nu-Jazz is mainly the synths and rhythm. I don't really understand how the synth in this song doesn't sound extremely similar to an electronic jazz style piano?
listentothis,3dxiv0,Shizu_senpai,7,Mon Jul 20 15:20:07 2015 UTC,"I think i got why we aren't on the same page, we just have different references for what jazz is. I was talking about typical features of jazz music as such as harmony structures, swing rythmics, instrumental solos, you are referring to jazz by sounds that are amenable to it. I'm more of a traditional jazz guy so i don't know much of the modern electronic experiments and contaminations so i guess that's the thing."
listentothis,3dxiv0,gingerballs45,6,Mon Jul 20 15:36:44 2015 UTC,"That's totally fair. I guess I'm very open to what can be considered different genre's now because it is very hard to be original without stretching some boundaries in the present age. But trust me I love Jazz just the same, I was at an underground Jazz club last night actually and I always forget how technical and precise you have to be to be a jazz musician."
listentothis,3dxiv0,Shizu_senpai,4,Mon Jul 20 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with that, nowadays is probabilly impossible to find some music which is not influenced by something which came beforehand so the line that separates one thing to another is pretty thin in most cases. Jazz nowadays tend to be very technical indeed even though it wasn't at all at the beginning. If you think about it the first jazz records sounded much more like a ""When the saints go marching here"" kind of thing. You know, as a jazz musician, having a good background of discography references is much more of a struggle than technical improvement cause it takes a lot more time, but you probabilly know that aswell."

It's one of the things you listen if you want to understand how the transition from traditional jazz to modern contaminations took places. Or something from Herbie Hancock, like the piece called ""Cantaloupe island"" or ""Watermelon man"". Those are too good examples of jazz evolving in a more groovy style."

listentothis,3dxiv0,Shizu_senpai,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:30:42 2015 UTC,"Art Blakey's Jazz messengers are a good example of what i (and nearly anyone) intend for jazz music. Of course there're a lot of different artists and styles among jazz discographies, in fact there's something more modern like medeski, martin & wood who take something from the jazz language and implement it with funk and other contaminations so it's really a huge world. Now the third link you put is something very far away from what jazz is, or maybe i'm just misunderstanding and you were not meaning that. Anyway the first link would be the most appropriate, even if there's still a HUGE load artists which came many years before  Art Blakey (who doesn't know Luis Armstrong) and many others came after him, so the jazz language took huge changes throughout the years. But you probabilly already know all that."
listentothis,3dxiv0,trouty,5,Mon Jul 20 15:45:53 2015 UTC,"True. I'm not trying to split hairs with you - just identifying some folks who have explored specifically why jazz, by virtue, does not have many parameters at all.   That's kind of the genius of Naked City, where John Zorn, Bill Frisell, and Joey Baron getting together and say, ""fuck you, this is jazz."" At least that's my interpretation of it. They are each contemporary masters, hallowed to be some of the best jazz musicians of the late 20th century. It kind of throws a wrench in the entire notion of what jazz is. It came at a time with the offshoot of so many subgenres of jazz, they suggest if this and that can be jazz, so can this.   The groups I mentioned earlier were the first that popped in my mind, but there are some others that I love that definitely bring into question the same ideas.  Heernt - Sea Urchin. See Urchin Run.  Darryl Reeves - Southern Lights  Pharoah Sanders - The Creator Has A Master Plan  Bill Frisell - Shenandoah  Sun Ra - Nuclear War  **edit - another personal favorite, not necessarily avant garde, but on the bleeding edge of jazz:  Stan Getz - Dum Dum Dum"
