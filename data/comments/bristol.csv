If you're left homeless when you show up, come bearing paperwork. Lots of paperwork. Bank statements, a letter from your university stating that you're to be a permanent student.  I was prepared to pay 6 months in advance, but asked my employer (read: visa sponsor) to send them a letter stating how important I am and how much they're paying me. It's different for a student, but all you have to do is convince them you're in it to win it. Professor's recommendation or a letter from the university.

As for Harbourside Property Group, I've never heard of them but some estate agents in bristol can be a nightmare to deal with.

It's got some decent Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood paintings upstairs, the only downside is that because it's a varied collection (not just paintings), it doesn't go into a great deal of depth on any one thing. The shop is great if you want to learn more about local Bristol history, lots of stuff in there.  The M-Shed is another free museum in Bristol. That's more focused, covering the history of Bristol, though I would have liked some more depth in certain areas (e.g., I'd enjoy a more extensive display on musical developments in the city, like '90s trip hop).  Plenty of nice walks around Bristol. E.g., Troopers Hill, Ashton Court. Also lots of pleasant bike rides too, like the one I did recently next to a river (can't remember exactly where that was, but I think it was somewhere around Eastville Park).

Bristol rents are high and increasing rapidly, there's not enough rental properties to provide for all the people moving here, Bristol is pretty fashionable presently.  Hopefully there are places for everyone when the September comes, there has been some new student accommodation being developed in the city centre, but I think that presently it's a case of just getting whatever you can find."
bristol,3dq9ef,ShadowOfTheWasp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:15:09 2015 UTC,"To me, the Marketgate is decent, but my brother, who lives in Birmingham made a comment that I could've found much cheaper accommodations (but wouldn't help me find it) and that 5610 pounds is very very very expensive like I'm living in a palace expensive, just because he lives in a shabby neighborhood and pays 250 a month. That made my Chinese dad flip, and now suddenly he's pressuring me to find cheaper.   As a person who's disabled and can't walk far, I need a bus stop to be right in front. But my dad, now thinking there are cheaper accommodations, is flipping out.   Thank you for your advice though. It'll be nice to tell him my brother's 'observation' is bullshit."
bristol,3dq9ef,ShadowOfTheWasp,2,Sun Jul 19 05:40:53 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you can convince your dad but yes, your brother is wrong. Birmingham is quite a bit cheaper than Bristol, I'd say about 20/25% cheaper, for rented property.  If you need proof I'd recommend getting some results from Rightmove, if you do two identical searches for both Bristol & Birmingham (say, 1BR, 1 mile radius, sub £450pcm) the results will be massively different. Even allowing for the size difference (Bristol is approx 0.5 million population, Birmingham is 1 million) it is still obvious that Bristol is more expensive.  Other than that there is plenty of evidence here on this sub, lots of old posts with people saying how expensive rent is here and how difficult it is to find a place, even though it's anecdotal hopefully that will help you prove the point.

The article says he was involved with the Bristol Muslim cultural society prior to his work as a government advisor. Isn't it equally as relevant to say ""former government advisor convicted of rape""? That is, if we're mentioning it because he's been in a position of trust.   I don't mean to undermine these very serious charges, but the claim that he is a Muslim leader seems tenuous at best, and I feel like if someone lived an identical life but was raised in a Christian household rather than Muslim, we wouldn't be mentioning his religion in this headline."

I mean, is there any suggestion anywhere at all that levels of sexual crime are higher in Muslim communities than non Muslim communities? Because that is exactly what these stories are insinuating."
bristol,3dmhlp,Jizzicle,6,Fri Jul 17 18:06:36 2015 UTC,"Not a 'suggestion' but there seems to be/have been sex grooming gangs of predominantly muslim men operating at an industrial level in the UK. Just google it, theres pages of it."

No, figure it out, scum are scum whether Muslim or Christian or Spagetti Monster scum, religion is irrelevant to this, its just yet another attempt to demonise Muslims."
bristol,3dmhlp,AbubakarD,6,Sat Jul 18 02:57:48 2015 UTC,"stop trying to gloss over this crime, and the crime of other Muslims as though it's naught but oppression and racism. Have you EVER complained that numerous articles about child-molesting Catholic Priests that mention their religion? No. Like the rapist discussed in this thread, those Priests are leaders in their faith. Their crime is, therefore, inextricably linked to their faith.  Yet, when it comes to a Muslim leader charged with being a rapist, you defend him by insinuating that the entire discussion is based on islamophobia. It's not evidence of his innocence which causes you to defend him but purely that he is Muslim. You'd prefer that a Muslim rapist were left un-challenged, than that any Muslim were accused of any crime, any time. It is people like you who give space and permission to evil, allowing it to fester and grow in your community until it owns you all. You're as bad as the (some) white people who blame all crime in their neighbourhood on black kids, while ignoring what their own brats are up to. Your attitude is exactly why rape gangs and terrorism take hold...because people like you defend the indefensible so long as it's done by a fellow Muslim who you prefer over white people.  You are the racist here and the sad thing is, that the damage that your racism causes affects everyone across society. This is exactly the OPPOSITE of demonisation of Muslims by others.  It is the WORSHIP of Muslims - by you.  Stop worshipping other men. All men have the capacity for evil, whatever their religion, and all religious leaders represent their religion. They ESPECIALLY must be held to account because what they do reflects in other's experience of YOUR GOD. So, if you love your god, instead of defending them, hold to account those in your community who besmirch it  with their actions. Support society's attempts to police and to administer justice instead of acting as if Muslims are gods, incapable of crime and unanswerable for their sins."

bristol,3dmhlp,cowbutt6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:12:40 2015 UTC,"The line you cut out is very important for context. Perhaps I could have phrased it more succinctly.   The article is making an issue of him being a Muslim. I doubt they would admit religious prejudice, so I'm assuming that the issue with him being a Muslim community leader emphasises that he was in a position of trust and leadership above the fact that he believes in magic sky people and heavens full of virgins.  In that case, his later work as a government adviser is equally concerning.  To address your point though, why is the fact that religion plays a major role in his life relevant to the fact that he's an evil rapist monster? He's not the first, and we've seen atrocities committed by people from all walks of life."

He's not the first, and we've seen atrocities committed by people from all walks of life.   If Siddique was merely a devoted Muslim believer in his personal life, and his professional life was unrelated to that (say, he was a personal fitness trainer, or advising the government on business policy), I very much doubt his personal religious beliefs would get, or warrant, a mention (and rightly so).  But he has held two ""professional Muslim"" roles. If a priest, vicar, bishop, Spiritual Peer ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_Spiritual ) etc. was being charged with a serious offence, I would expect their religious beliefs to warrant a mention too.  So it's not the fact that Islam plays a major role in his life, but that it plays a major role in his professional life that warrants the mention.  EDIT: I'd also encourage you to note that he is innocent until proven guilty of being ""an evil rapist monster""."

bristol,3dlwia,jqm0,3,Fri Jul 17 11:26:10 2015 UTC,True although the area in question here appears to be a shared space for cyclists and pedestrians: map key source  The problem here is poor planning as pedestrians and cyclists are forced into conflict.  This whole issue being discussed here pales in comparison to the genuine problem of deaths on the road due to poor design. This narrative only distracts from the fact that people are regularly killed or seriously injured on the roads and more could be done to prevent that.  It sucks that some people are assholes (whether driving a car or riding a bike) but there's a bigger problem here.

I am not trying to make small of what you are saying, but the whole thing could be avoided by people sticking to driving/riding safely rather than the usual finger pointing by drivers/cyclists (I am neither and get the wrath of both).  Edit - Oh and yeah I know about the ""Shared"" space, and agree that it is stupid planning that caused it. The other one that annoys me on a regular basis is cyclists speeding through Queen Square. Interesting fact, did you know that the ""Cycle Path"" specifically shows that you should go around the edge rather than across it?"

bristol,3dj1r3,MiserableLie,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"At this stage we're just trying to get a general sense of the place and where we should be looking.  I'm doing some wider reading but there's no substitute for local knowledge.  We've visited previously, but obviously visiting is a long way from living somewhere."
bristol,3dj1r3,HelmutVillam,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:19:04 2015 UTC,KW and fartcliffe aren't that bad really. Knowle Park is actually quite nice. Avoid Brislington which is a traffic nightmare.
bristol,3dj1r3,islandbaggers,5,Fri Jul 17 09:15:22 2015 UTC,"St Werburghs.  It's 30 mins walk to the centre, close to the motorway, great community spirit, close to vibrant Gloucester Road but not hectic and noisy all hours of the night, close to Eastville Tesco, great park (Mina Road), city farm, several great pubs, and I can afford to rent a big two bedroom house with a big garden for 825 a month."
bristol,3dj1r3,alxw,5,Fri Jul 17 09:30:53 2015 UTC,"Looking through your history you look like a petrolhead. I'd suggest avoiding the central areas BS1, 2, 3 and 8 unless you rent out a garage/driveway as on street parking is a nightmare and someone will scratch/dent it.  Bristol is not car friendly and is worse than driving through central London at times. I suggest moving to the side of the city you think you'd more likely use. South for the countryside, North for the M4, East for countryside, West for M5."
bristol,3dj1r3,alxw,2,Fri Jul 17 11:17:05 2015 UTC,"Cheers, that's a really valuable insight. It looked annoying to drive through when we visited. Are you a petrolhead yourself?"
bristol,3dj1r3,evelynsmee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:39:15 2015 UTC,"Nah, can't afford it. A few mates are though and I'd suggest checking out Castle Combe track days as they can be a laugh."
bristol,3dj1r3,spiltmonkeez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:03:45 2015 UTC,This might be the best advice in the thread. Especially if one intends to drive to work.
bristol,3dj1r3,Taucher1979,4,Sun Jul 19 18:42:55 2015 UTC,"I have recently moved from a small place in Sneyd Park to a bigger place in Shirehampton. I though it was going to be horrible but I love it. Great High Street, good neighbours and low prices. Handy for motorway, Portway and plenty of public transport into town or up to cribs. I have noticed that houses and flats are snapped up quick sharp whether for sale or rent ."
bristol,3dj1r3,spiltmonkeez,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:04 2015 UTC,Hmm. Going to be buying next year and have identified Shirehampton as the perfect place to buy. Bit worried that things are selling quick - seems like property in Bristol is crazy and I'm not the only one who fancies the Shire.
bristol,3dj1r3,iamwilmot,2,Fri Jul 17 08:51:06 2015 UTC,Well I guess that's a good thing. No point investing time and money into an area where it takes ages to sell. It'll be for a reason. I recommend the area. It's no frills at a sensible price. Hope where ever you choose works out for you!
bristol,3dj1r3,ThatFilthyMonkey,5,Sat Jul 18 03:37:17 2015 UTC,"Around north street in bedminster/southville is great. Its nice, not too expensive (although rents are rising), you can walk to town and has decent transport links, although getting to temple meads is a ball ache at night. Seriously, why isn't there a bus other than the extortionate A1? We've got an Aldi, lidl, and a huge asda too. It's...pretty great."
bristol,3dj1r3,JasminaChillibeaner,4,Thu Jul 16 20:37:00 2015 UTC,"Recently moved to Cadbury Heath, heard it was a bit dodgy but seems that was some years ago, so far its been pretty quiet and nice for us.   Used to be a very working class area, but seems a lot of the houses around here are being gutted, refurbed and sold as semi upscale homes.  Grew up in Filton, and parents still live there, and every time I visit them Filton looks a little more depressing and dilapidated. Although they do now have both a Nandos AND a Costa, which was the talk of the town."
bristol,3dj1r3,allykatte,2,Thu Jul 16 21:37:05 2015 UTC,Avonmouth sometimes smells like poo!    There are sewage treatment facilities nearby so do your househunting around there on a warm day.
bristol,3dj1r3,lamellicorn,2,Fri Jul 17 03:50:47 2015 UTC,"I recently moved to Bedminster/Southville border from Montpelier and while its hardly the bustling metropolis it is nice. More chill. Though I do miss the Asian/middle eastern food shops, world food is pricey here. And I got told 'ere, don't go doggin' me up next time, yeh?' In Aldi."
bristol,3dj1r3,allykatte,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:09:58 2015 UTC,Does anyone what Lawrence Hill is really like? I'm gonna be moving there real soon but not sure if i need to be aware of anything..
bristol,3dj1r3,DanWelsh86,2,Thu Jul 16 20:38:22 2015 UTC,Just don't go to the Pack Horse.
bristol,3dj1r3,kateykatey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:07:02 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Lawrence Hill for about two years, pretty near the train station. It's not the most exciting place, but the centre is walkable and it's pretty convenient for food shopping and stuff. Like someone else in this thread said, it can depend on the street, but I've never had any problems walking around the area - I've been warned the bike path gets a bit dodgy at night, but that's easy enough to avoid. I walk home from town at night fairly regularly and go jogging in the evenings without feeling any more cautious than I would generally, tbh. It's just a bit dull compared to the trendier areas of Bristol."
bristol,3dj1r3,CulturalTortoise,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:21:58 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call it cheap. Just not ridiculous prices. Money spent commuting may as well go on rent regardless.
bristol,3dj1r3,paparatti,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:02:02 2015 UTC,What are you looking for? Budget for renting/buying would be helpful too! Everywhere has pros and cons!
bristol,3dj1r3,alxw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:18:26 2015 UTC,I was looking at moving to hartcliffe soon and have heard nothing but bad things.. Why is it meant to be so bad there? Around the bs130ns area?
bristol,3dj1r3,hoffi_coffi,4,Thu Jul 16 23:57:45 2015 UTC,"It's just got a bit of a legacy of poverty, underemployment and crime. There are a lot of great people out there, and it's very affordable to live... but you just have to be prepared for the odd encounter with junkies/marauding kids/poorly socialised people who will try and start something just because you glance in their direction. If you know how to handle yourself, you'll be fine. Never sit on the top deck of the #75 after Redcliffe Hill when you're going south.  You'll be fine!"
bristol,3dj1r3,MeaMaximaCunt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:31:39 2015 UTC,I've had friends rent in Hartcliffe. All of them had moved before their 12 month tenancy was up. Most cited unsociable neighbours shouting at 3am or playing unce-unce music.
bristol,3dj1r3,alxw,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:54:04 2015 UTC,"It depends what you are looking for, plus don't go entirely by first impressions. When I first strolled through Montpelier and saw rows of terraced houses and graffiti I assumed it was a complete no-go. But it is a lovely area. Bristol can change quite dramatically quite quickly too, a few streets over from a posh townhouse and you are rubbing shoulders with crackheads. Avoid Hartcliffe though."
