Scams,3e0apn,oliveranch,3,Tue Jul 21 02:48:50 2015 UTC,You can initiate a credit freeze online. You can also initiate a fraud alert. These are two different things. Type each into Google to see the difference between each. A fraud alert is temporary and a freeze is permanent until you disable it or remove it.   This should make it harder for any scammer to open new credit in your name. I would tell all banks and existing credit agencies to put a fraud alert on your accounts. They may also send you new cards.   You can also call the attorney generals office in your state and inquire if they are aware of the scam. The FBI generally handles interstate online scams just as an FYI. You should document all of this before you call the authorities so that you can give them a complete report.
Scams,3e0apn,Dormont,0,Tue Jul 21 02:54:05 2015 UTC,"This appears to be a clearinghouse for loan consolidation. They collect a fee to match you to a lender. I'd be mostly concerned about you being matched with a lender who is going to take advantage of you and rope you into a bad loan. Bad loans could be high interest, variable interest rates, default rates if you miss a payment or are late or any combination of such things. There end of the scam is taking the upfront payment for the matching; after that you will never hear from them again.   Secondly, data security is an issue. Because these companies operate in a realm of less than ethical practices, the people they hire aren't the type of people a reputable financial institution would hire. Who sees your personal information may be someone who is making $9 an hour and with a criminal record. I worked very briefly with a place when I was in college that was like this, not the same industry, but handled personal info. The people would get social security numbers, address info, credit card numbers and such from people, with very little control or supervision.   Follow the advice of others and make these changes to start securing your data. If you get a loan agreement from them, do not sign it until it can be reviewed by someone with knowledge of such matters."

Because if you stay there and she is NOT a friend, she is going to threaten and force you to give up your new information. Get some counseling, ask for a SAFE PLACE to stay, while you clear your head.  You were in an abusive home. Oftentimes the abuser convinces you to come back or this friend of yours convinces you to keep doing what you are doing. Once again, this is ALL based on the fact that this MAY be a scam. ASSUME that it is for NOW and get to the bank to change your account info! Then get a free credit report (not from Facebook) but from the REAL Transunion. Keep an eye on your credit report/account.

Scams,3dubob,Nitro_Thunder,5,Sun Jul 19 22:14:23 2015 UTC,"I currently work for one of the few companies who are contracted with the government to conduct these background investigations. Every comment in here speaks a bit of truth. I'll try to summarize here:  1 - Reading your post is a dead on hit for how typical for this type of background investigation begins from your point of view. You mentioned that he was in the Navy (or joining the Navy). Your name could have been given by him/her during their initial and rather lengthy personal interview. We need to cover certain aspects of an individuals life. This could be educational, residential, employment and/or personal aspects. Your name could have even been brought up by a friend of a friend of a friend. That's how vast these things can be.   2 - You made a comment that you were surprised that your name came up in the investigation. This is very common. I read on a daily basis about people who have little to no contact outside or work or maybe have had no real good contact with our Subject in X amount of years. Your name could have come up because the initial investigator might have asked your friend ""Hey, can you give me the name of a person you specifically worked with together when you were working at McDonald's?"". Or maybe someone else was interviewed on this case before you and mentioned ""You know, i think u/iamsaltedpeanuts worked with them at Home Depot before, maybe you can talk to them too?""  3 - Meeting happening at a Starbucks, Library or somewhere else is 100% common. u/Anikando mentions that they once had one of these interviews over the phone. Both scenarios are 100% common and true. By policy, all interviews are supposed to be conducted in person / face to face. However when it comes to you (not our Subject), those can be done over the phone if you specifically ask for it to be that way. Say your too busy or can't meet in person, you just need to mention it to them and it would be very quick and painless. The Investigators should not be offering this option right out of the gate, rather they should be using it as an Option B.  Also, in regards to length of this interview - thats dependent on you. If your a chatter box then you can be there for awhile. Maybe your Investigator is very detailed with questions and that can make it run 30-45 minutes. Or maybe you have nothing really to say and its done and over in 10-15. It varies on the person, the Subject & the Investigator.   4 - to follow up on u/BrainBurrito - They sometimes will ask you personal details about the person being interviewed. IE: where do they live, any problems with law enforcement, any problems when you 2 worked together, any drinking issues etc. You don't have to answer these questions nor you do not have to participate in general with the interview. This is 100000% voluntary on your part and you should feel no pressure to cooperate. You will not be damaging your friend or hindering their chance at a career by choosing not to participate or not give specific information to questions. You have to know that an agency (such as the Navy) is paying A LOT of money for one of these investigations to occur. They are attempting to get as big of picture as they can about the Subject in question to make sure they are a fit for certain positions and/or future positions.   So to summarize - This more than likely is legit and its your choice on how you want to proceed. You either participate or you don't. If you do participate then you don't have to answer anything you don't want to as YOU are not the person they are interested in, the company is solely interested in the Subject of the investigation."

One person was just renewing their clearance so I'm guessing the investigators were able to plan way ahead and meet me in person.

Scams,3dsind,BibbyNocturnal,6,Sun Jul 19 01:05:52 2015 UTC,"yeah, you got owned really hard.  The certificate issue with trusted sites means there is a ""hosts"" file on your computer that redirects you when you try to access that domain.  Very, very risky to use that computer to do anything else, i suggest you close those accounts and clean reinstall the entire OS.  I am reluctant to even say that you should figure out a way to save the data from it.  Do not log in to ANYTHING ANYWHERE On that computer, assume that hackers can read every keystroke you type on that keyboard until you reinstall windows."
Scams,3dsind,davvblack,7,Sun Jul 19 02:53:00 2015 UTC,"If you haven't already done so, disconnect that computer from the Internet immediately. From a different computer, change all, literally all, account information for any and all accounts ever accessed from that computer. It is not exaggerating to say that you should assume all information on that computer is now known to the people who scammed you, the least of which would be any account and password information (like a text file that contains all of the usernames and passwords for everything you do online, and which you should be discouraged from keeping, with the possible exception being if it's encrypted and stored some place not always connected to the computer, like on a removable drive  or USB stick). If you want, you could move things like your personal documents, images, video, and audio files to an external hard drive, and have all of it scanned for anything in the way of viruses and/or malware. It's not all that common, but viruses can be passed that way. You should probably delete all executables (like installation apps) and *.zip files. Whomever scammed you might not have put any such malware in these forms on your computer, but you seem like the type who would have such types of infected files on your computer anyway, so just be safe. If you try to go this route (save personal files and have them scanned), let whomever is going to scan the files know BEFOREHAND, and that person should be pretty technically savvy.  Next, have the computer completely wiped and everything reinstalled from scratch. If the computer is a brand name computer that was purchased with the OS and other software already installed, you should be able to restore the system to a factory state since most such computers usually have a factory image stored on a seperate partition. You should probably call technical support for the manufacturer of the computer and they should be able to walk you through it; this usually involves something like holding down the F9 key as you power on the computer. Your computer should be restored to the brand new state, meaning that any applications you purchased and installed after you booted it up the first time when you originally got the machine will have to be reinstalled.  Going forward, Malwarebytes, Kaspersky, and AVG are fine for protection, but if you're going to use those, go directly to their official site yourself, and purchase and run the installer yourself, or go to a brick and mortar store and buy the software directly. If someone else absolutely must install anti-virus software for you, it should only be someone who you know personally and trust, and who is technically savvy, or it should be a professional computer service person at a physical location, like a repair shop (I don't know if Best Buy's Geek Squad or Fry's does that). I don't know anyone who suggests McAfee or Norton/Symantec. Faceless people contacting you out of the blue, over the phone and/or via the Internet, offering their services should NEVER be trusted.  NOTE: You should also be aware that Microsoft will NEVER call you. If anyone ever contacts you and says they are with ""Windows Support"", and they are detecting viruses or other problems on your computer, it is a scam. Not ""some times"" or ""most of the time"", but every single time that person is calling to scam you. A dead giveaway is if the caller has an Indian (as in, from India) accent. Don't try to discuss or clarify anything with them; just hang up. Don't even try writing down the phone number so you can call the FBI to report them since they are almost certainly calling from India using VoIP and displaying a spoofed number."

Talk to the people who actually work there, those clubs are all the same when you work in them. I mean do some real research at least. Even I've done that much and it's not my subject.  You are only a tourist, WTF would you know unless you worked there.  The clubs you are talking about like in Kings Cross in Sydney are sleazy dirt bags, because the men made them that way. Australian men are insecure around strong women, so they keep them down and call them con artists. You are calling them con artists, because you are ashamed of yourself for not realizing what the club was when you walked in there, so you blame the club and the women.  But it's the women who suffer, because you put them that much further down on the totem pole of hierarchical society.  Australia has been bleeding its most beautiful and intelligent women since year do, because of forever being put down put down put down. You make everything sleazy and disgusting, nobody is allowed any pride in their work, they all have to be desperate. . Also because of idiots like you writing about women being con artists, because they can't get decent paid work in the straight world. And why not, when they get told they are overqualified for a normal job in Australia, or are a con artist for trying to not be on the dole bludging off Australian tax payers or their parents.  Australia's employment and DNA problem is because of idiots like you who have no real world education and put down women who want to do better for themselves without charity.  When visitors come to Australia they see under 21 year olds who can't handle their alcohol in the bars causing fights; really good look for Australia that is. This doesn't happen in California because the age for drinking is 21, when humans are physically and mentally better able to handle substances, and in Europe they simply have better educations.  Overseas, Australian men are an embarrassment. They can't handle their alcohol and they don't know how to act around strong women, or in public.  Write a book about that and you might have an international best seller. There are lot more strong women than men outside of Australia, plus all the Ozzy anything fans, they'd love reading it.  Get out of the gutter, as you really don't know what is there, because you are only a tourist. You are complaining of the same thing you are doing, being a con artist, selling false information.  Write about what you know, which is idiot Australian men.  FYI: My day job is audience development for writers.  Let me know when you are working on that book, I may be interested in helping you."

There is a huge dropout rate at these places.  The institution isn't very concerned about whether the student eventually drops out because they're guaranteed to get that grant.  It's basically a grant-leaching (federal funds) scam and to top it off, the degrees from many of those places are worthless.  I've talked to employers who said applications with degrees from those types of places went right in the trash.    The Pell Grant is a great idea and should definitely exist but it's being abused by some of those for-profit colleges.  Low-income minorities are worst affected because they're the most attracted to a ""cheaper"" (because it's intensive, short & vocation oriented) education.  These places pander to their worries about education costs, use them for the Pell Grant, then kick them out the door with a bunch of debt and shitty degree.  The reality is, they could go to a city/community college and get a better education for a lot less."

Scams,3d9arw,isnotscott,9,Tue Jul 14 14:39:08 2015 UTC,"Real process servers do not call in advance.  They only serve papers.  They don't discuss what the papers are about, who to phone about the papers, or who to contact to settle what the papers are about or to ""stop"" a lawsuit.  You will not know they are coming until they knock on the door.  All they will do is ask for a particular person and if you indicate that person lives there they will leave the papers with you (might have you sign).  If you indicate that person does not live there they will usually ask if you know the person and if you know where they live or how to contact them.  That's it.  The fact that someone called you in advance indicates it is NOT a process server.  It is either a scam or a collection agency.  You do not owe them any identification, personal information (of you or anyone else), nor need to sign anything.  If they call or come to the door just tell them you do not know this person (through a closed door) and then ignore them."
Scams,3d9arw,Junkmans1,3,Tue Jul 14 16:22:16 2015 UTC,Block the number. Don't answer it if you can't block it. You can file a complaint with the ftc if you wish. You can also contact a lawyer if you want to seek damages if the calls continue after giving notice. The lawyer can guide you through the specific process in your state (there are state and federal laws concerning collection practices).

Did your mother give them her address, or am I missing something?  Any way it goes, if someone does show up on your doorstep, ask them to identify themselves before opening the door. If they identify themselves as associated with this group (or refuse to identify), call your family in the PD and have them there to sort this out.   DO NOT sign anything; DO NOT accept custody of anything (letters, packages, etc.)  As to what it is, it's probably a company who refuses to believe that this person doesn't actually live there, and is convinced you're lying. Which will really suck for them the day you decide to press suit against the company for harassing calls."

They have your number as the number of the person they are chasing down, which may have been this lady's old number or she may have made one up which happens to be yours.  Debt companies are not allowed to threaten anything like that, but the less scrupilous ones do.  Sometimes they say they have contacted the sherif, etc.....  They will not come to your house.  It is highly illegal what they are doing, they are acting under the impression you are all lying and you do know this woman, and maybe your mom actually is this woman.  It is a scare tactic to have her call the number to try to get back the debt.  Next time they call, ask what company they are calling from, and then report them, as they will get in a lot of trouble for this."
Scams,3d9arw,JoeRudisghost,2,Wed Jul 15 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"It is more than likely a scam, as others have noted, process servers don't call and let you know they are coming.  This is a fear tactic to elicit behavior that makes the mark more likely to pay over the phone.  Just look at the amount of action it has elicited from your mother so far.  And that is when the call isn't even for her.  You say the callback number was an answering service?  Not sure how an answering service 'seems legit', but did it happen to list a company name?  Google the number you called, google the name of the company, etc.  You can find out a lot by just that call back number.  And don't discount them impersonating a legitimate company that you do find real info on.  Just because I give you a magic jack number and a automated message that says I'm the U.S. Treasury doesn't mean I actually am.  I would immediately ask for a company name, address and phone number.  If they will not give you that then they are either a shady debt collector or a full on scam.  If they happen to be a real company that just isn't listening you would have some redress.  FDCPA  Edit: forgot to mention this is extremely common to threaten process serving, arrest, etc.  I get these calls probably once a week.  Sometimes for me, sometimes for people I've never heard of.  Just a name and a number on a spreadsheet that was stolen, or bought, or sold, then bought, then stolen again, then shared...etc."

I'd advise her to go to the Singaporean consulate and let them know. They'll probably cancel her passport and issue a new one, and get the old one on a list.  Best of luck getting this sorted."

Although there are some Kickstarter campaigns that also are straight up bullshit. GoFundme and other fundraising sites also have a problem with scams that rarely if ever get addressed. Asking for money online is wrought with abuse.   It's not only scams ruining their integrity, it is also this wave of irrelevant type fundraisers that keep popping up.   Once reserved for those in need, in times of emergency or disaster, it is now becoming ""LOL, I want to go on vacation and buy an XBox One, help me raise $5,000."" Sure they aren't successful, but by allowing them to post, it gives a bad impression of the site.   I was at a wedding last summer that mailed out fundraiser cards for a ""honeymoon"" fund. This was in addition to the regular gifts. The link provided tried to politely explain that they wanted the extra money for a luxury honeymoon, that they felt they deserved, but also wanted to save wedding money for other things, like a house down payment. It was a joke, but they were dead serious and had no shame in asking."

Scams,3cn1kj,gnapster,2,Thu Jul 9 07:32:42 2015 UTC,You can pick up his mail at any post office in the area? That would be pretty cool if mail service actually worked like that. Obvious scam.
Scams,3cmkdi,DjWater,2,Thu Jul 9 01:58:51 2015 UTC,"This is a scam. Real mystery shopping jobs don't pay that much, and they don't e-mail you out of nowhere.   You can report the e-mail as spam, but since the perpetrators could be anywhere, there isn't really anywhere to report them to.   If mystery shopping interests you, check out http://www.jobslinger.com to get started."
Scams,3cmkdi,jeffersonbible,2,Thu Jul 9 03:26:25 2015 UTC,"This is a version of the basic check scam.  Since they are ""inspecting"" Western Union the scam will be that they'll send you a check for both your pay and some extra money to be used in the ""inspection"".  The instructions will be for you to deposit the check, retain your pay and send the rest of the money back to them via Western Union.    The way the scam works, as all check scams do, is that the check you receive will clear within a day or two.  You'll then send them their money only to find that days, weeks, even months, later the check will be no good and charged back to you by the bank.   People get fooled into this because they think that since the check ""cleared"" that it means it was good.  In reality checks clear in a day or so based on banking rules but that doesn't mean the check was verified as good.  As the check routes through the system it will be discovered to be bad and ultimately come back to you."
Scams,3cmkdi,Junkmans1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:39:02 2015 UTC,Scam. I've done some actual mystery shopping...they would never list the client in a help-wanted listing. The fact that it's Western Union is a huge red flag. Walk away from this thing.
Scams,3cmkdi,squarepeg0000,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:09:22 2015 UTC,"LOL, the scammer want you to ""test"" Western Union by having you send the scammer money by Western Union.  Once you send money by Western Union, it is gone and untraceable.  There's really nothing that anyone can do about it, so at best reporting it will only serve to add to the statistics of how often the scam is attempted."
Scams,3cmkdi,nimble2,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:56:51 2015 UTC,"First of all, you don't shop ""when and where you want"" as a mystery shopper. You have specific assignments, with specific times, scenarios and deviating from any of those can get your shop thrown out.  Second of all, you are NEVER prepaid to do an assignment. Your assignment is done and IF accepted by the client, you are paid 30-60 days later.  Third, there is NO shop that pays $170 ""except"" if you are video shopping (hidden camera in a dentists office as example) or have a large route where you cover a greater area. There are a few rare shops that pay this but you are heavily involved in the shop, with time consuming narratives and weekly reports. The average shop pays $10 to $15 dollars. Always remember this when you see a HIGH prepaid fee with a LARGE check for over $1,000."
Scams,3cl37t,TheDerpAgent,9,Wed Jul 8 19:18:00 2015 UTC,"Extremely unlikely this was done BY paypal. Either that's not an official email address, or an email was somehow disguised as coming from an official address, or some malware on your computer intercepted you on the way to the paypal website.  Paypal as a company would have no interest in pulling something like this."
Scams,3cl37t,TardisTechnologist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:21:02 2015 UTC,"Yet i never got a second email by paypal. Paypal's policy is they ALWAYS reply within 24 hours. Within 24 hours this is the only email i have gotten.   Even more confused now, so either paypal has terrible customer service or are trying to scam??  Regarding your malware statement, no way there's any malware on my pc. I keep it clean and do daily checkups."

It is trivially easy to spoof email addresses; the headers within the email gives a much more valid clue as to where it may have come from, at least at the server level."

I actually looked up their website (a legit travel agency), and they only operate in European markets from the looks of it.  The same lady never responded to me when I asked why they were hiring an American travel coordinator who hasn't even been overseas for a European company.

Scams,3cig79,Gentlemanlygamer1992,2,Wed Jul 8 04:00:43 2015 UTC,"It might be helpful to post some of the content of your emails. Though the fact that you haven't talked to him on the phone and that you can't find any information on him is already suspicious. Maybe you can send an email the foundation and ask them if he exists.   I'm certain it's a scam since enough people searched for ""trevor onderdonk rockefeller"" on google for it to come up as a suggested search. And the top link for it is a scam search site. Even though they have no information on it, again, enough people have searched for ""him"" that it shows up first on Google. Unless he's going through personal assistants every hour, you can be sure it's not legit."
Scams,3cig79,skinnyjunk,2,Wed Jul 8 04:09:43 2015 UTC,"Well, I just realized something that I think confirms it. In the first email he referred to me as ""applicant"" and then asked my name and stuff for a background check. And Then the second email I was referred to by name. Isn't that usually how scams go?"
Scams,3cig79,skinnyjunk,2,Wed Jul 8 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that sounds like it. A lot of these job scams seem to be for ""personal assistant"" positions, I'm guessing so that they can be vague in their description of the job responsibilities, and so that they can eventually ask you to take care of some business for them and proceed to send you the old fake check that you get to ""keep"" a part of."
Scams,3cig79,skinnyjunk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:22:44 2015 UTC,"He did say he sent me check that I get to ""keep"" a part of. So you got that pretty down. Said I take out my first weeks pay and then donate the rest to an orphanage in the Philippines. I figure, if it turns out to be a real check and I can cash it, what's the harm?"
Scams,3cig79,jayguazu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:43:13 2015 UTC,"It's not going to be a real check. There's zero chance of that. These scams work because they prey on people's greed for easy money, which clouds their better judgment. Just recently we had a thread in this sub of the exact same scam, with the exact same story about the orphanage. If you cash the check YOU are going to get in legal trouble, not the scammer. Sometimes it takes the banks weeks to figure out the check was fake. Don't do it or you'll be back here asking ""What do I do now?"""
Scams,3cig79,skinnyjunk,2,Thu Jul 9 17:20:40 2015 UTC,I did notice the Google thing too
Scams,3cig79,Merhouse,2,Wed Jul 8 04:16:04 2015 UTC,"Can I just add that this is a far from foolproof way of identifying a scam. They do quite often use the names of real people at real companies - I dealt with one once who who claimed to be, and used the name of. the head of HSBC Malaysia, and of course there are th myriad ones that pretend to be former presidents of Liberia and so on."
Scams,3cig79,Merhouse,2,Wed Jul 8 12:26:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe not, but if enough people searched a scam site for the name, someone is pretending to be them. It's not the only thing to look for, but in addition to everything else it's pretty clear in this case."
Scams,3cig79,Merhouse,2,Wed Jul 8 16:10:46 2015 UTC,"Morning Edit: I can't find his name ANYwhere. I really thought this was the Rockefeller impersonator, but that is a completely different guy: This  is the guy I was thinking of. Not sure how I got him mixed up with your guy.   Anyway, I looked at The 2013 Rockefeller Foundation Annual Report, and Trevor doesn't show up anywhere within their staff or trustees. The 2014 report doesn't seem to be published yet.  Bottom line, I have to believe this is a scam, which you probably really already know.  Hope this helps even a little. (What I said earlier is below, just for full disclosure)    Edit! This is not the guy I was thinking of; I will link to him once I'm on a computer.  Thing is, though, I know THIS name from someplace and will continue looking.  OK, now bedtime :x  This guy was in the news years ago. As I recall,  he was calling himself a Rockefeller,  married some woman, and there was a huge scandal about it. Whether this is actually the same guy or just someone using the name, I'd stay pretty far away.  I'm on mobile right now and dead tired, but if you'd like I can try to find more information about him (tomorrow)."
Scams,3cig79,inlandquarter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:51:30 2015 UTC,I appreciate all the help you put into that. But it's not necessary. I think everyone here has convinced me it's a scam and I'm just going to ignore him from now on. I thank you for you're help though.
Scams,3cig79,inlandquarter,2,Wed Jul 8 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"You're most welcome. I have to admit, though, it kind of became an obsession because I still think I know the name Onderdonk, but nothing at all comes up that makes any sense.   I really thought he was the Rockefeller impersonator, and at that point I just had to find the ""real"" impostor (is that such a thing? A real impostor?) just to make sure I wasn't completely crazy.  OK, this doesn't mean I'm not completely crazy, but at least I do know I wasn't imaging the whole impostor thing ;)"
Scams,3cig79,inlandquarter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:08:59 2015 UTC,"Well, he sent me another email saying that my first weeks paycheck is in the mail along with some extra money I'm supposed to donate to an orphanage in the Philippines. That's kind of odd. It's supposed to be in the mail tomorrow. I figure if there really is a check, and I can really cash it, then I'll go along with it as long as possible."
Scams,3cig79,inlandquarter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:40:30 2015 UTC,"Uhm, NO!  This is the classic bogus check scheme. He will send you a check that will look like it will clear, and sometime down the road, it will come back as a fraudulent check. Meanwhile, you've sent money to this ""Philippine Orphanage"" (which I imagine doesn't exactly exist), and guess what -- YOU are out the money.  Best thing you can do, if anything, is to notify the police and the FBI, give them the check if they will take it, and let them try to trace down this scammer.  Believe me, nothing good will come from this!"
Scams,3cig79,inlandquarter,2,Thu Jul 9 16:48:28 2015 UTC,Sounds good to me.
Scams,3cig79,inlandquarter,2,Thu Jul 9 16:54:52 2015 UTC,"Just got the same email. It sounds like a nigerian prince type scam. Literally same exact text and all. I decided to give a quick google search because of the ""formal"" business man type vocabulary... I gave them my info D:"
Scams,3cig79,SecretAgentPauli,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:35 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it. I gave him my info too before I came here in the hopes it would be real. The check they sent me got seized and I haven't heard anything about it. The check they send you may or may not be seized and if it isn't can be cashed. But I would be weary about cashing it. From what I read up, it can cash just fine then a few weeks later it is caught as fraudulent and you get charged with felonies and stuff unless the company/bank you cashed it with is nice enough to just let you pay off what the fraudulent amount was for. All depends on the situation."
Scams,3cist8,VivoAzzurro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:14:54 2015 UTC,"It sounds like a scam (99.99% sure), but it's hard to be 100% sure until they actually pull the trigger on the scam (like say if they send you a realistic looking cashier's check for more than you are asking and then request that you send some of the extra money to their ""shipper"" because for some reason they just can't make it to pick up the goods themselves).  You gave your e-mail address to someone who may be a scammer.  You're not in any danger."
Scams,3cist8,nimble2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:08:05 2015 UTC,I definitely over reacted when i made this post. I don't know why i thought I was in so much trouble.. (It was at 4 am though)

Scams,3cist8,dmightx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"Three big hallmarks of this, the common false check Craigslist scam:   Never refers to the ""item"" by name, only as ""the item"" - or otherwise copies item description verbatim from Craigslist listing Irrelevant backstory in email ""God bless"" in signature   Two others that you haven't yet gotten up to:   Despite what the buyer said about inspecting the ""item"", they never will (because they are in Nigeria obviously). The backstory plays into this later - there will be some far-fetched excuse for not being able to come in person. Instead they will send you a check for far more than the item's value, and request that you wire a sum from the check's proceeds to their ""shipping agent"" via Western Union or Moneygram. The check will look as if it has cleared in days but is in fact fake, the shipping agents are the scammers, and the target will have lost the wired amount and a dishonoured check fee. They will describe themselves as deaf-mute, hard of hearing, or some other variation to avoid talking to you on the phone.    The last bit is why it's of little consequence if you have given away your number but just be wary because your number could be shared amongst scammers. All smartphone models have number blocking so if you receive any calls with an unusual country code, you can just block it with little effort."

Scams,3ccjxu,coolhandmarie,3,Tue Jul 7 00:41:54 2015 UTC,"OP's strategy does potentially put you in less immediate financial risk. Cashing it at the issuing bank rather than your bank does mean that it will take a lot longer and will take a lawsuit to get to the step of forcing you to repay for the bad check... as in, you could still face charges or would still be sued by the issuing bank, but if you had gone to YOUR bank, they would just immediately debit the money right back out of your account the moment the check comes up bad. So, I mean, if you were in a desperate enough position and you have a documented, prudent, good faith reason to believe the check IS good, and you need the money for something urgent, then the better option for you personally, in the short term, is in fact to do what OP said.  Either bank will call police and either bank will make you repay, but only YOUR bank can make you repay immediately."
Scams,3ccjxu,coolhandmarie,2,Tue Jul 7 01:39:53 2015 UTC,"The bank that produced said check will know immediately if the check is real, they can check on funds.

Scams,3c1vh2,Cyndikate,6,Sat Jul 4 00:07:12 2015 UTC,No. In most States you need a State insurance license. The thing is with selling insurance or other securities you have to deliver sales or you will be out the door ASAP. But if you obtain an State insurance license or permit you can easily change agencies or even be able to start your own insurance agency. Insurance sales is a cut throat industry so you must deliver the clients to buy their products or good bye.
Scams,3c1vh2,mcx9099,3,Sat Jul 4 01:39:28 2015 UTC,"Many years ago, I took a sales position at Combined Insurance. I went through 2 weeks of license training and then another 2 weeks of sales training. Was paid a small per diem to cover meals and they picked up the hotel tab.  After a few months of unsuccessfully knocking on doors, I decided to leave and still had my license. No out of pocket but a lot less than what you are being/going to be paid while in training. The license is yours to walk away with at the end of your tenure."
Scams,3c1vh2,Floor_Jack,3,Sat Jul 4 02:52:46 2015 UTC,MetLife is a completely legitimate company. They can't and won't hire you until you are licensed by your state. It is a benefit and convenience though that they are offering the license classes. I recommend accepting their offer. You will be compensated for your training and will earn a base pay plus commissions after that. What do you have to lose? You might actually be good at selling insurance and financial products and make a lot of money. Or you might hate it...but you got paid to learn about insurance and financial products and how they impact people's lives. Good luck.
Scams,3c1vh2,squarepeg0000,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:58:25 2015 UTC,"No. I don't smell scam at all. They are making you pay for a few things which makes it seem more real. It seems reasonable that you need to pay $100 for a license. The training is not paid. Some companies (never worked for insurance) want the employee to pay for certain things, such as their own license and some even the background checks. You are not paying to be hired. You are paying to be licensed and you always have to pay that yourself, think drivers license, investigators license. This does not sound like a scam. The pay is decent. However, it could be a totally crappy job that is hard to fill and you quit. I say give it a chance. Don't be surprised that you might have to pay for more things as you go along, such as materials, some training, travel, fees, this is all part of the insurance industry and it does not mean this is a scam but an essential part of your job. Think realtor, they have to have a license, they have to pay for that, it's $200. As example:  3. Get Licensed Real estate licenses require the passing of state and national exams. In addition, you may have to provide a criminal background check. Between the exam and license fees for a real estate salesperson, you can expect to pay at least $200, thought prices vary from state-to-state."

The paper says ” By sending an email that repels all but the most gullible the scammer gets the most promising marks to self-select, and tilts the true to false positive ratio in his favor.” In other words, the scammer isn’t worried that most recipients delete their appeals without bothering to read the text, but those who do and become interested (the self-selected) are likely to respond to the scammer and become a potential source of profit."""

So, and this may not be reassuring at all, but I guess if you're in danger then I may be as well. I'm not sure which scammer you interacted with, but the one I did posts all over the country. Nothing has happened yet, but I'm still keeping my eyes open, and I think you should too."

If you want to placate them, (and any time a car is to be shipped to you, it's a scam unless it's a vintage car possibly), give them a car detailer's address because as soon as it's shipped, you're going to have ""work done on it""."
