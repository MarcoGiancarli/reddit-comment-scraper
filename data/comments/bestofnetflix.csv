bestofnetflix,3e2qua,infectedtwin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:43:02 2015 UTC,and I am surprised they are funding Adam Sandler new movie.  They might start to lose customers.
bestofnetflix,3e1jyl,driveLikeYouStoleIt,3,Tue Jul 21 06:27:38 2015 UTC,A pretty upsetting film knowing this was reality for many women.
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,delos_1,8,Mon Jul 20 09:27:25 2015 UTC,"Watched this last night. Wasn't what I expected, but did turn out to be a pretty intriguing character study. Think it might turn out to be a grower."
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,geoelectric,7,Mon Jul 20 15:16:14 2015 UTC,Watched it Friday. Very high creepy factor. I recommend it.
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,EdgHG,6,Mon Jul 20 12:32:20 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone went along and watched this and posted about it here. I am a big fan of Duplass but I HATE the whole ""found footage"" genre. Will definitely watch now, thanks OP!"
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,Justbret,4,Mon Jul 20 17:38:41 2015 UTC,I'm the exact same. Love Duplass and hate found footage. I have never heard of this and totally looking forward to it now!
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,Negative_Clank,5,Mon Jul 20 21:00:45 2015 UTC,made me very uncomfortable watching something that is so realistic and can hit close to home. creeeeppy
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,ummmyeeeahhh,4,Mon Jul 20 21:18:49 2015 UTC,"Probably not gonna watch this (I hate scary movies), but imagining Pete from the League in a horror movie is a very intriguing concept to me."
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,thebuttpirater,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:34:48 2015 UTC,It's not that scary really just creepy as hell
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,Siegelement,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:11:45 2015 UTC,I get scared waaaaaay too easily from movies so it'd probably be scary to me haha.
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,thebuttpirater,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:02:45 2015 UTC,"Same here, I cant hang with horror movies at all. Theres only a few ""jump scares"" but they're really obvious and not really meant to scare you I don't think, hard to explain. But the plot was really original and hella creepy imo."
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,Siegelement,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:10:34 2015 UTC,"Huh. Well, I still have my doubts (not doubting you, it's just that movies that people were like ""yeah it's not scary, it's just creepy"" still scared the shit outta me), but maybe I'll check it out one of these days."
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,thebuttpirater,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:11 2015 UTC,Hahaha no worries. Im not down with watchin  scary movies either. This felt more like a psychological tense thriller than a horror movie
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,Siegelement,3,Tue Jul 21 05:01:13 2015 UTC,"Watching it right now. Duplass is freaky so far. Especially in the beginning with his ""tubby"" scene."
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,Imma_boop_you,2,Tue Jul 21 04:03:23 2015 UTC,"This movie was nothing special. Not very creepy, but actually rather comedic."
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,otherworlds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:21:08 2015 UTC,Is it a supernatural/ghost type film or more based in reality?
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,DoctorSugarbear,3,Tue Jul 21 00:41:25 2015 UTC,"Not supernatural at all, and so so worth watching."
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,limitedsupply,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:12:40 2015 UTC,I enjoyed it.
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,driveLikeYouStoleIt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:04 2015 UTC,"I give it a 6/10. It's a short movie. I liked the story and the movie has a great way of making you so scared that you think their is a jumpscare coming up, but there isn't."
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,powertaffy,0,Tue Jul 21 23:44:18 2015 UTC,"Can anyone help me rationalize the ending? When Josef made the call to the guy who wasn't Aaron and then put the DVD in the bookshelf, I just kinda screamed ""What the fuck?"". Especially after that last jumpscare with Josef screaming"
bestofnetflix,3dxesa,arnielsAdumbration,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:06:04 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS  I don't understand if youre joking or just dont get it. Well if you didn't know by watching the whole thing + ending, Joseph is a serial killer and he's fucked in the head. Part of his serial killerness(?)  is he likes everything being filmed including their death. So his only requirement is for a person to bring a camera (and themselves) which will unknowingly be the only proof of how they died. The ending is basically him showing us his huge collection of people he has killed and adding aaron's video to the collection. You can tell he has been killing for a long time because there are video tapes AND DVDs. The last jumpscare is him just being weird."
bestofnetflix,3dxbcn,Cheech_Jarritos,7,Mon Jul 20 08:36:19 2015 UTC,Not a bad film but I Sell The Dead is much better.
bestofnetflix,3dxbcn,necrohonkey,9,Mon Jul 20 09:24:37 2015 UTC,"This is really bad, don't be fooled by the cast."
bestofnetflix,3dxbcn,Astrimedes,3,Mon Jul 20 12:06:16 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree. It's not something that would win any awards, but I thought it was a fun, entertaining movie. I certainly don't regret watching it in the slightest."
bestofnetflix,3dxbcn,cupids_hitman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:04:18 2015 UTC,"Well, you're certainly free to disagree. I just posted what I would have liked to see before I watched it :)"
bestofnetflix,3dxbcn,Astrimedes,5,Mon Jul 20 22:49:52 2015 UTC,"Simon Pegg AND Andy Serkis, why would you exclude Gollum?!?!"
bestofnetflix,3dxbcn,gargolito,4,Mon Jul 20 12:13:09 2015 UTC,Simon Pegg has a bad track record in comedies he starred in without Edgar Wright directing or Nick Frost Co starring.
bestofnetflix,3dxbcn,ablebodiedmango,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:17 2015 UTC,"This one isn't that bad. Not a must watch, but definitely worth watching if you have some time."
bestofnetflix,3dxbcn,cupids_hitman,2,Mon Jul 20 21:05:34 2015 UTC,"Quite depressingly unfunny. In fact, the idea that the same director could have made Kentucky Fried Movie, The Blues Brothers, and American Werewolf in London, just makes it worse :("
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,Th3MonkeyKing,26,Sat Jul 18 23:10:29 2015 UTC,This is one of my favorite films of all time. I highly recommend it.
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,evil_twinkie,10,Sun Jul 19 02:18:52 2015 UTC,"Absolutely brilliant film - one that will stay with you forever. I probably reference or think about it once a month or so and I saw it years ago. So great, if crushing at times."
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,greebytime,6,Sun Jul 19 02:31:16 2015 UTC,Hand or foot?
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,I_Need_Redemption,4,Sun Jul 19 04:47:28 2015 UTC,That scene is tough.
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,Col_Monstrosity,6,Sun Jul 19 17:13:03 2015 UTC,"If any one is interested in another Brazilian movie, Elite Squad is also pretty good. Right now Netflix only seems to have the sequel, The Enemy Within to stream which isn't as good as the original"
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,PalpatineDidNoWrong,2,Sun Jul 19 13:50:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen the first one yet. But I watched the second recently, and have to say that I REALLY liked it. I was worried because I hadn't seen the first that I'd be missing some crucial backstory or something. But whether or not the movie was pertaining to the same story arc or not it really held up well as a separate movie."
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,TheNinjaCow,5,Sun Jul 19 16:51:36 2015 UTC,Now I have to watch it again. It's been a while.
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,doggscube,5,Sun Jul 19 03:25:52 2015 UTC,A movie I rewatch often. Incredible directing and writing to an incredible true story.
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,Fifty_Stalins,4,Sun Jul 19 04:45:57 2015 UTC,"Watched this movie a few weeks ago, indeed very good."
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,HazeXL,3,Sun Jul 19 03:56:41 2015 UTC,this is a staple for any serious filmatic. at this point people who havent seen it yet are on the outside. fuck even the city of men is borderline classic now
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,laser-TITS,2,Sun Jul 19 07:19:57 2015 UTC,I saw this a decade ago and it still one my favorites.
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,goonerfan10,2,Sun Jul 19 15:13:25 2015 UTC,It's a rather incredible movie. The scene where the kid takes a shower for the first time wasn't even scripted; it was just chit chat between the actors.
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,mrpopenfresh,4,Sun Jul 19 15:33:05 2015 UTC,"Definitely recommended. But a warning, it is extremely violent as you would expect.  The amount of death and misery just shows a hard way of life in Brazil Favelas."
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,burns13,4,Sun Jul 19 04:14:01 2015 UTC,The amazing thing about this film though is that they still managed to fit in some humor and lighthearted moments in a way that didn't feel forced at all.
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,paper-tigers,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:40:18 2015 UTC,"Brilliant film. Everything about this film from the cinematography to the characters, is mind blowing. It should get a Criterion release"
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,Monteitoro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:49:10 2015 UTC,"I saw this in the theater when it came out.  On a first date.  Not a good first date movie, fyi.  But.... an incredible film!"
bestofnetflix,3ds6vu,Twonix,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:53 2015 UTC,One of my all time favorites.  This should be on your bucket list of movies.  Its brilliant.
bestofnetflix,3drha0,riftmasterflex,5,Sat Jul 18 19:19:23 2015 UTC,"I love General Tso's, so I might be biased, but I loved the documentary. Although they dig into the mystery behind the name and the origin of the dish, they actually spend like 70% of the documentary just focusing on the history of American-Chinese cuisine. The Chinese might be right about our taste buds, but I can't help it if I like things that are sweet and spicy! :)"
bestofnetflix,3drha0,stoudman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:40:57 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed how they went into all the different facets of what separates American-Chinese cuisine from authentic Chinese.
bestofnetflix,3drha0,RobChromatik,2,Sun Jul 19 01:14:05 2015 UTC,"This documentary was alright. It didn't hold my complete attention, though I didn't give it the fairest chance. It's basically like a travel channel documentary (without the host)."
bestofnetflix,3drha0,natstrap,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:29:43 2015 UTC,How is this? It seems like it'll either be really good or really bad. Don't wanna waste my time.
bestofnetflix,3drha0,TornadoPuppies,2,Sat Jul 18 23:23:43 2015 UTC,I watched it in two sittings but its pretty well done and definitely answers the questions it asks in the start.
bestofnetflix,3drha0,adjur,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:34:44 2015 UTC,watched this last weekend and enjoyed it. Starting craving Chinese food immediately after and actually just got back from dinner... where I ordered Gen. Tso's chicken.
bestofnetflix,3dps0d,superokgo,2,Sat Jul 18 06:59:23 2015 UTC,"I watched this and I liked it.  If you liked this, may I recommend ""all is lost"", also in Netflix."
bestofnetflix,3dno3s,woodgobblins,7,Fri Jul 17 19:17:58 2015 UTC,I watched it and was pretty bad. Almost turned it off several times but gutted through it only to be disappointed. Completely ridiculous and pathetic ufo b.s.
bestofnetflix,3dno3s,slick_bridges,2,Sat Jul 18 02:59:50 2015 UTC,"I'm always suspicious of anyone using the title 'Dr.' who isn't medical professional,  but it turns out this guy is a medical doctor.   Now I'm just suspicious because he's described as a ufologist."
bestofnetflix,3dno3s,ohno,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:17:42 2015 UTC,Suspicious of non-medical doctorates?
bestofnetflix,3dno3s,-Manananggal-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:11:59 2015 UTC,"No, I'm suspicious of people with non-medical PhDs who us the honorific ""Dr."".  Properly, that is reserved for people with specific degrees."

bestofnetflix,3dno3s,Dillweed7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:45:58 2015 UTC,It covered a lot more than expected it to. Found the suppression of free energy inventions very interesting.
bestofnetflix,3djl5u,MushroomGoats1,8,Thu Jul 16 20:09:24 2015 UTC,Good movie. I didn't know anything about it before watching either. The first 15 minutes or so make you think it's going to be a much different tone.
bestofnetflix,3djl5u,owlymctavish,2,Thu Jul 16 21:47:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. Never really knew what to expect all the way to the end.
bestofnetflix,3djl5u,dinosaur_train,2,Thu Jul 16 22:28:01 2015 UTC,I'll throw in my recommendation too. It is worth the watch.
bestofnetflix,3djl5u,nosoccertoday,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:52:51 2015 UTC,Watched it last night.  Strong independent flavor.  Very enjoyable and rewarding.

bestofnetflix,3dhc8q,exit6,4,Thu Jul 16 17:04:40 2015 UTC,"This movie, and that song by America, got etched into my soul when I was 12 years old.  Beautifully haunting."
bestofnetflix,3dhc8q,mrfunktastic,5,Thu Jul 16 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this movie has been with me since I was a kid.  I have it on DVD now and got it signed by Peter Beagle when he did a theater tour of this movie last summer.  It was totally worth it, though I'm pretty sure Peter Beagle was slightly drunk at the time."
bestofnetflix,3dhc8q,secretly_an_alpaca,3,Thu Jul 16 17:47:44 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, yeah. I already forgot about this movie.   It was so creepy as the tree tries to seduce the mage (if I remember correctly) ....the whole movie was creepy like shit!  I have to watch it again."
bestofnetflix,3dhc8q,Zitrone1337,3,Thu Jul 16 10:23:04 2015 UTC,"The book was way better, IMO. I could see how it would scare a kid."
bestofnetflix,3dhc8q,Mule2go,2,Thu Jul 16 10:54:28 2015 UTC,I didn't realize there was a movie and I just read this book as an adult. I found it to be slow and not very well written but by the time they reached the castle I was absolutely captivated! Now I need to watch the movie :)
bestofnetflix,3dhc8q,sandepants,3,Thu Jul 16 16:55:44 2015 UTC,I grew up on this!
bestofnetflix,3dhc8q,katiedoyle100,3,Thu Jul 16 17:02:51 2015 UTC,There are no happy endings because nothing ever ends.    The 12 year old girl who still dwells in the pink boudoir of my soul will never stop loving this movie.
bestofnetflix,3dhc8q,MsAlign,2,Thu Jul 16 20:59:50 2015 UTC,One of my favorite movies. Was just talking about it yesterday. I loved it as a kid. I recorded it off HBO when it first came on and wore out the vhs I watched it so much
bestofnetflix,3dhc8q,Davryanna,2,Thu Jul 16 15:14:10 2015 UTC,This makes me think of the movie Legend
bestofnetflix,3dhc8q,serviceenginesoon,2,Thu Jul 16 19:45:16 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: the animation studio behind this, Topcraft, was essentially a proto-Studio Ghibli. When it went bankrupt, Miyazaki and others bought it out and renamed it, taking on board most of the animation staff."

bestofnetflix,3dbmdq,cannellbd,5,Wed Jul 15 04:49:02 2015 UTC,This show is fantastic.
bestofnetflix,3dbmdq,Lettuceout,4,Wed Jul 15 02:39:27 2015 UTC,"The subtitles are what ended up annoying me.  There was a sense of vagueness in their translation.  I know many shows/movies suffer from this, but after the first 6 or 7 episodes, I was just feeling worn out, like i was missing a lot of the flavor in the dialogue.  I'll have to give it another try eventually."
bestofnetflix,3dbmdq,F0reverlad,2,Wed Jul 15 04:18:00 2015 UTC,"I think there are plenty of reasons to dislike subtitles without being lazy. I think it forces me to look at the bottom of the screen instead of the action, which is especially annoying if there is a lot of overlapping dialogue."
bestofnetflix,3dbmdq,wasser24,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:10:33 2015 UTC,They don't even seem to be translating everything. Often times they'll skip over a character's lines entirely.

bestofnetflix,3dbmdq,Zhangar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:39:57 2015 UTC,Is it normal for people to have sexual relations so freely into their 40s? Most single women I know does it a whole lot less than Rita. Is she unrealistic - kind of like Samantha in Sex in the City was?
bestofnetflix,3dbmdq,ernestborgnine2013,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it wouldnt surprise me. Single women in their 40's can be promiscuous and we arent as conservative as America when it comes to sex. It wouldnt be looked down upon here. Sex is just sex."

The list started off with some shortcuts and buffering recommendations which I found to be mildly interesting. Then as the tips and tricks continued to degrade as the list wore on, the author skillfully included silly gifs and images to fluff up the content. Sensing something was wrong, I stopped scrolling and noticed that they were recommending the use of an Unblock service in order to view Netflix while abroad.

Pretty much she went over there and made it seem like the Vietnamese were treating the POW good and kind when in reality they were torturing them. She earned the nickname ""Hanoi Jane"". Fonda admitted to former American POWs and their families that she regretted the pain she caused them.  But it's something a lot of people aren't willing to forgets.

He stayed to take every question people had and finished the night just chatting to a handful of people in the cramped little lobby of the Downer Theater. He was such a genuinely good guy. The movie does a good job of showing all of his facets, and he is certainly as flawed as anybody else, but at his core there is a real nobility and goodness. It was an honor getting to shake his hand."

The movie did a great job at condensing a fucking ton of psychology and philosophy and misdirection into something that could be appreciated as a film.  And if a fan really thinks about it, the end of the film is probably better than the comic.  I have read the comic 5 or 6 times now and always end up watching the movie shortly after finishing the comic.  They are both masterpieces.  P.S.

bestofnetflix,3cfcl5,geoelectric,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:42:48 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I don't. Watching the Motion Comic comes extremely close to reading it, though, even though it is abridged. Think of it as an audiobook with the frames as visuals, but slightly animated. Its version of chapter 4 (Watchmaker) is one of the best things that has ever happened to a comic book for me."

bestofnetflix,3c9i54,rocknrollguy19,33,Mon Jul 6 04:51:35 2015 UTC,I believe the Netflix rating is how much they think you will like the movie based on your pervious ratings. It's not an aggregate of user reviews.
bestofnetflix,3c9i54,icoup,6,Mon Jul 6 05:04:39 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, you might be right. I tend to watch well known american films, so when a smaller foreign film pops up I guess it assumes I wouldn't enjoy it as much. Its not a very good system for promoting independent films for me haha. But the moral is don't assume a movie is good or bad just on the ratings. If you like the genre and the description , go for it"
bestofnetflix,3c9i54,rocknrollguy19,4,Mon Jul 6 05:32:36 2015 UTC,"It's very unconventional. Black and White, non-traditional approach to telling the story, etc. If a typical audience sees it, they would give a very different rating than critics did."

That is why he bought out the barbershop owner and disguised himself that way so he could stay close to his family and watch over them.   It was a pretty easy plot twist to explain, still not a great movie but it is refreshing to see Adam Sandler take on a real acting role again instead of making diarrhea like Jack and Jill. His last watchable movie was Funny People and his last good movie would be Spanglish or Punch Drunk Love.  Edit: sorry let me correct myself, Reign Over Me was a great movie also."

Did it want to be a parody of superhero movies or did it want to be taken seriously? The movie seemed to jump back and forth between both and ended up becoming a weird mishmash of awkward scenes where you don't know whether you should laugh or not. As a result, you get some scenes that don't make sense at all given either context.  I feel like this could have been such a well-made movie if it had just figured out what it wanted to be and stuck with it. As it is, I do enjoy the premise enough and there are some laughs to be had regardless. I'd give it a 5/10."

bestofnetflix,3b95ko,merrickx,6,Sat Jun 27 00:06:32 2015 UTC,"When I was working within a school district, I spent a couple months working at a school which was occupied by grades 1 through 8, so I like to think I got a good idea of what kids eat and are served at schools overall.  It's really eye-opening how terrible the food is. The ""healthy"" items that occasional appear on the plates, would probably be more accurately described as ""less unhealthy items."" Another big thing was the immense amount of edible food that is thrown away by kids. Sometimes, there were efforts to have the kids return the packaged stuff that they weren't eating, but even then, a lot of stuff thrown away.  Of course, they can't collect the stuff that isn't packaged, and even if they could, it would often be bitten into perhaps once, and not touched again thereafter because it just tasted so awful that the kids would rather just eat their 4 or 5 apple slices and go play.  High school wasn't too long ago for me- I remember the only healthy thing able to be bought, outside of the regular food program, was a to-go tray of salad, of which there only existed like 5 to 8 of at each snack bar. They'd be gone within 30 seconds of the bell ringing."

bestofnetflix,3b38vc,ihennebe,2,Fri Jun 26 07:48:20 2015 UTC,"I didn't like this movie. Hector is a complete jerk towards his girlfriend. He does what he wants, including cheating on her, demeaning her verbally, and strings her on emotionally by alluding that he's not certain he wants to be with her. I feel like a regular or strong willed person would have left Hector, but his girlfriend clearly has a submissive personality by doing everything for him. Also there were a lot of parts of the movie that were really boring, like him on the plane. He also must be very rich to be able to afford those plane tickets, that apartment, that model plane and so on, and yet when asked if he is rich he says no. Just one of the many lies Hector tells. He's not a likeable character and I found the most happiness when this movie ended."

There were a couple of truly amazing action sequences (the church fight in particular) but the plot was mediocre at best.

As a native to the sf bay area, it was extra creepy.   I remember when the movie ended, I went to the bathroom. I was standing at a urinal next to another guy and had this brief moment where I wondered if he was a normal person or if he had been replaced by a pod person. I had a very brief but very real moment of paranoia from the movie. It really stuck with me and remains one of my favorite horror flicks."

bestofnetflix,3altv9,LeSpatula,12,Sun Jun 21 14:10:58 2015 UTC,"I watched through Ascension a few days ago and I thought it was alright. It's nothing spectacular and has the 'run of the mill' Syfy acting, but the story in and of itself is interesting, if a bit obvious.   Most of the sets are practical and use very little of SyFi's usual horrible CGI. I liked their ship, the Ascension, far more than I liked any character. It has a nice 'modern 1960s' feel to it. Which is another change of pace that I like.  Its similar to Fallout's retro aesthetic.   If you can get past the 'soap opera' filler drama scenes and poor acting from some of the crew, it's a fun watch. I easily binged on it. Syfi is also looking to turn it into a multiseason series. Which would be neat. Could potentially become another BSG if they can spread their wings."

Like confusing-for-the-sake-of-being-confusing films, which I generally do not like.   My advice is to watch it, but don't expect to get everything, then read an explanation of the plot and watch it again. I'm fairly confident that you will enjoy it much more on the second viewing than you would ever expect. This is certainly a movie that puts more of a burden on its viewer, but sometimes really good art requires this sort of effort to be appreciated."

Plot explanation  Important general points to be aware of, with basic timeline  As /u/amemut said you should probably use these resources before a second viewing. This movie is a real treat for the brain. Never has a film strained my mind so much (I watched it a few times without using these guides). If you're the kind of person who enjoys solving complex math problems, rubik's cubes or playing chess or poker, you may enjoy committing 5+ hours to solving this film on your own.

This is in great part, I imagine, for fear of taking risks with a franchise and running against the grain of the existing fanbase which is one of the greatest assets in making sure a movie like this makes money.  While I do like well-done movies that are more faithful to a franchise, like LOTR, I miss movies that took risks with commonly known stories and characters and try to create something new. With the Super Mario Bros movie, it was just fun to recognize their interpretations of various things like Bowser, Yoshi, power-up mushrooms, etc.   For me, that in itself made it worth watching."

In both movies there is long, drawn out build up to very punctuated moments of extreme violence. Everything seems unravel very quickly compared to the pacing of the movies.  It's also how slick things felt compared to just how dirty everything is. In a gross envrionment, everything seems to have a very extravagant flair to it which can be representative of the main characters' choice of professions.  The note we ended on is that we felt that a movie with the two characters facing off could work very well. Their demeanor and vehicular obsession would play off one another well."

The show starts to pick up towards the backhalf of the first season, but it feels a little too late. Also to me the premise wasn't made clear and honestly didn't really make sense once it was explained. The lead character lacks anything to make her likable outside of being hot and action stuff.

It has many of the hallmarks of what I look for in a great Netflix original: good acting, lesser known actors, edgy material, etc.  However, as someone who has spent a little time in a correctional facility (shout out to Baltimore Pretrial peeps), I was outraged at the generalities and generally sympathetic, watered down portrayal of the conditions and day to day lives of people on the inside. My experience undermined my ability to appreciate the story arc, the sets, and the writing, so I had rage quit watching a couple episodes into season two.  TL;DR: watch OITNB if you enjoy campy prison dramas, don't watch if you have experience and are outraged at misrepresentations.  I don't mean to offend anybody, I just had to vent."
bestofnetflix,39josr,MrTeDak,2,Mon Jun 15 21:24:39 2015 UTC,So...you're saying the show portrays inmates to be kinder than you believe them to be?
bestofnetflix,39josr,musteatbrainz,3,Mon Jun 15 23:20:34 2015 UTC,"Well, no, not specifically. The details that upset me more involved the portrayal of the guards and their ""power,"" the personal needs being met by the institution (i.e. convicts being readily able to meet with superintendents, the availability of medical treatment, etc), and how weakly the show illustrates the institutionalized dehumanization in American correctional facilities.  Again, I'm not disputing anyone enjoying the show, I just felt that it trivialized the tragedy of injustice that our prisons have become, and I couldn't watch it."

bestofnetflix,39josr,DeepRoast,9,Tue Jun 16 02:46:31 2015 UTC,"Just finished today, really wasn't any good.  Writing sucked ass, first 2 episodes could be completely removed from the series and noone would notice. Rest are just ""where X came from"" for various actors. I did enjoy learning more about the characters and the fact they focused more on the main prisoners.  But still it felt like they shoehorned the back-stories in between multiple semi-solid mini-plots.      Piper and the whole panty theme  could be removed.  There is one, golden nugget though. I really loved Big Boo this season. Her backstory was nice, but her lines and dramatic actiing were solid.  Made me wish all the episodes in S3 were written like that. You know, feeling something and actually caring about the characters.  The whole ""messiah"" thing was annoying and over done.  The concept of the prison going from federal to private, I feel was a nice attempt at political discussion.  Few lines make you think but the thing as a whole was poorly executed.  In the end I simply couldn't feel sorry or have any feelings really toward anyone involved.   S3 can be summed up in a 15 second clip.   Marine jumps on a bomb, as soon as he lands they change to a clip of a dog fart. I wish I was kidding.   Really had high hopes for bennet. Kept thinking maybe he'll show up near/after the birth, explain he moved away to find a better job, new house or something.  Never seen from again, and to much airtime on pornstash and his mother who I really didn't care about."

bestofnetflix,39josr,xxtruthxx,5,Fri Jul 3 05:57:50 2015 UTC,They need to focus less on the Alex character. She is annoying at the level of Anthony Sopranos' sister from the show The Sopranos.
bestofnetflix,39josr,Mortimer1234,3,Mon Jun 22 02:26:17 2015 UTC,"Here's a nice recap of the last episode in case anyone needs it.   If anyone has a better recap of the whole season, that would be awesome!"
bestofnetflix,39josr,gsomething,3,Fri Jun 12 05:36:14 2015 UTC,Netflix included a 5min recap of season 2 that you can play ahead of the new season. Its pretty awesome.
bestofnetflix,39josr,ghosteria,5,Fri Jun 12 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"I tried to watch it, after the second episode I just wasn't feeling it. Seems too soap dramaish."
bestofnetflix,39josr,musteatbrainz,0,Sat Jun 13 23:46:42 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Season 1 was amazing.  Season 2 started off strong and then got insipid pretty quickly.  Season 3 continues down this path.  RIP Orange.

bestofnetflix,39josr,DeepRoast,2,Sun Jun 14 15:24:53 2015 UTC,Good read and pretty much how I felt.  Big Boo truly kicked ass this season and made me love her.
bestofnetflix,39josr,DeepRoast,0,Wed Jun 17 18:37:48 2015 UTC,"Timeline error?  At the end Piper says ""That'll be me in 6-12 months"". Referring to her release date.  So all of S1-3 took place within a 1-6 month time line? Piper was only in Prison for a lil over a year."
bestofnetflix,3922ku,screamrave,12,Mon Jun 8 18:11:34 2015 UTC,I really liked it too. I really hope they do a second season.
bestofnetflix,3922ku,atom138,13,Mon Jun 8 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"About halfway through I was finding it hard to believe they would leave it open for a season 2, then I thought how cool would it be if they did it true detective style and a new season would be a new family and new drama. Then at the end I thought it was clear they set it up for a second season with the same people."
bestofnetflix,3922ku,thats_not_what_I_do,2,Mon Jun 8 19:52:20 2015 UTC,Apparently the creators have enough material for many seasons of the same family. Very interesting. Love the first season! One of my new favorites.

bestofnetflix,3922ku,fuzzyperson98,3,Tue Jun 9 04:45:27 2015 UTC,I've watched two episodes and it has been great so far. I'm wondering how people like Bloodline compared to Sense8 which is next up for us.
bestofnetflix,3922ku,htallen,3,Mon Jun 8 19:03:31 2015 UTC,"Sense8 has had a very divisive response. Personally, it's easily one of my favorite shows of all time.  I will say that it starts of a little weak, and not just because it's a slow burner like Bloodline but some of the scenes and dialogue came off as a little hokey or uninteresting, but by episode 4 I had completely fallen in love with it.  Overall the style doesn't share much with Bloodline.  If you've seen Cloud Atlas that might give you a better sense of what to expect."
bestofnetflix,3922ku,AwayFromReality,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:52:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched that yet, it's in my queue as well."
bestofnetflix,3922ku,bruhman5thfloor,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:22:21 2015 UTC,"Sense8 was fantastic.  Binged the whole thing over the weekend, best character development I've seen in a single season of any show since perhaps Marco Polo or maybe even Firefly.  Without spoiling too much I really began to feel like the groups shared experiences were melding them, much like the premise.  Hadn't heard of bloodline before but I'll be checking it out now."
bestofnetflix,3922ku,AwayFromReality,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:26:32 2015 UTC,"Personally I felt Sense8 had somewhat cliched characters (indian girl marrying a guy she doesn't love, never seen that before /s). It was also way too preachy at least towards the beginning of the season. I don't mind gay or transgender characters, in fact its great to see those in new shows. But when those characters' identity revolves around their orientation or gender then I have a problem (Orange is the new black actually handled the transgender character pretty well, she was part of the cast but her gender was not that big a deal). Finally, and this might just be me being nitpicky, attention to details was severely lacking. For example, cop calls for backup on radio but doesn't identify himself, who will the dispatch send backup to? Another example, a couple of the core 8 actually question why they have the connection and get a decent explanation for it, but everyone else just kinda says ""alright I guess we are connected don't need any explanation"". I have a few more complaints but they are probably spoilers and I don't wanna ruin the story for you. Overall not the worst show but not the best either. I was still compelled to keep watching the next episode"
bestofnetflix,3922ku,pendulus,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:06:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of these criticisms, especially about the cliches and melodrama. Sense8 is a great concept but still kinda falls flat; it has too many boring and unnecessary parts (concert of births comes to mind), which makes viewings arduous at times."
bestofnetflix,3922ku,SuperSulf,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:36:14 2015 UTC,Yeah what did that scene even accomplish? Did we really need to see each of them actually being born in a graphic way to connect to them. Also the sex scene with the orgy of all the characters. It feels like they just threw those scenes in to be edgy but it really didn't promote the plot any further

bestofnetflix,38uzzv,all_hail_cthulhu,4,Sun Jun 7 07:38:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I rolled my eyes so fucking hard that I turned into the undertaker at the wachowskis shoehorning a trans woman into their show.   I don't have a problem with her in general, it was just mind numbingly pretentious for Lana to basically write herself into the show."
bestofnetflix,38uzzv,smell_my_thoughts,6,Sun Jun 7 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"That's kinda what it seemed like at first,  but I think they were more just picking characters from all walks of life. The lesbian couple actually get a few twist thrown at them that I think we're pretty interesting/entertaining. This show definitely isn't for everybody (conservative people who might feel uncomfortable with certain aspects of life) but I think that just adds more character to the show."
bestofnetflix,38uzzv,CatAstrophy11,-2,Sun Jun 7 15:40:43 2015 UTC,"So if it's a trans character it's intentional, but if it's anyone else it's just a regular character. Sounds like a personal problem."
bestofnetflix,38uzzv,timetogetpaid,0,Sun Jun 7 15:10:41 2015 UTC,"I like how you can extrapolate based on an assumption but that couldn't be further from the truth. I deal with trans women on a regular basis and count them among friends of mine.   My problem is with Lana Wachowski seemingly using the show as a pretentious soap box. It doesn't seem like much of a secret that the wachowskis think they're much more clever than they actually are, but I continue to give them chances in hopes that they can capture the magic that was the original matrix film."
bestofnetflix,38uzzv,AgentOrangeJuice,-3,Sun Jun 7 16:10:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, the ol' ""I'm friends with trans people so I can say what I want."" That's lame. Why isn't your complaint that it's a bad character? You only don't like that they're a bad character because they're trans and you think it's shoehorning."
bestofnetflix,38uzzv,Randal_Paul,0,Sun Jun 7 19:46:36 2015 UTC,This alone means I won't give it a chance. I expect better writing from a Netflix original series.

bestofnetflix,38uzzv,TimeTravelVandal,3,Mon Jun 8 23:49:41 2015 UTC,"I don't have that, either, but it certainly didn't hold my attention. There were too many characters with cliche story-lines, and after 45 minutes, I was ready for the plot, but it never came. If you want me to watch your show, you should be able to hook me in the first episode. It's the same with a book. Why should I continue if I don't think it will be worth my time?"

Def give the wachowskis a pass on the shoehorning, i was astounded at how well they pulled it off, even if it was extra deliberate. It just plain worked.

bestofnetflix,38slud,ciscomd,5,Sat Jun 6 19:11:44 2015 UTC,"Well, according to the opening credits, M. Méliès released both a black and white print and a hand-colored print. About 10 years ago a copy of the colored print, long thought lost, was discovered. Working from what was left of this nitrate print a restoration was created. It does not in any way diminish the quality of the existing black and white print.  However, the new music's a little odd to my tastes. Still well worth 15 minutes of your time."
bestofnetflix,38slud,chickenboneneck,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:06:00 2015 UTC,"So maybe it's something new that's still good. I saw the original as a kid, studied it in film school, and I've watched it as an adult. It's cool. It might also be cool to see an art collaboration across more than 100 years."
bestofnetflix,38slud,ciscomd,-2,Sat Jun 6 20:52:08 2015 UTC,Its not a collaboration if the original artist has no say in whether or not it even happens.
bestofnetflix,38veq4,madonnac,2,Sun Jun 7 03:57:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely in my eyes where Nomi finds Bug and gets all the gear. This is where it gets interesting, instead of being ahhh help me I'm all confused and don't know what's going on. Back to the hacking roots. Finding out who these people are how to disengage them. The dynamic changes from being hunted to hunter, especially the on screen connection between Nomi and Nita. Knowing that there is force behind the sensates. They're not alone instead of the cliche 'we can't tell anyone, we have to be selfless and do it ourselves!'   It's an interesting concept which I hope continues. The dialogue is quite dire, but I think that'll pick up during series. Essence of Orphan Black about it. With obviously that Netflix Original style! Well done I look forward to the next season!"
bestofnetflix,38rthb,skoutNova,5,Sat Jun 6 07:00:57 2015 UTC,Just watched the first two episodes and I am pretty annoyed that I have to stop watching because I have work in the morning.
bestofnetflix,38rthb,senor_apollo,5,Sat Jun 6 09:01:48 2015 UTC,"I'll admit, the first episode was slow and felt kind of cheesy at points, but after all the characters have had their introductions and the plot starts rolling it gets much much better. I was really impressed by the scenes in which their lives merge together. Some of these scenes are extremely complicated and it must be really challenging to make them work. They must have some sort of movie scientists. I don't know. They did it very well. My wife and I watched 4 episodes last night. We are trying to resist watching the rest of it today. Also has an awesome sound track. The 4 non blonde - what's up scene was so much fun! (episode 4 I think)"
bestofnetflix,38rthb,_Party_Pooper_,2,Sat Jun 6 15:44:06 2015 UTC,Haha yeah the 'what's going on' scene was amazing... Really demonstrates how much fun they can have with the concept.
bestofnetflix,38rthb,HamrheadEagleiThrust,15,Sat Jun 6 20:11:24 2015 UTC,"Like so many Wachowski projects, the series is overly ambitious. The show overextends itself by introducing too many characters initially than spending too much time following too few of them. Occasionally they throw in an unnecessary (for the plot), and largely forgettable scene, with one of the less talked about characters so that you don't completely forget about them. The idea being that you get a lot of time with each character so you can connect to or start to understand them, however the choppy narrative and extremely slow pacing created a real barrier for me. There are times when the ""sci-fi"" aspect seems like it was an inconvenience to the director so they just sort of toss it in. Seriously, you'd think a show about some kind of super-telepathy that connects strangers around the world would be more intriguing, but this feels like it's more of a character drama with scifi tacked on. Even after the first two episodes (the episodes are an hour long btw) you know no more than you did at the start.   TLDR: It's alright."
bestofnetflix,38rthb,ChildishSerpent,9,Sat Jun 6 09:54:29 2015 UTC,Everything you said is completely true. That said: I'm hooked. I binged the whole thing.
bestofnetflix,38rthb,ForestKing,6,Sat Jun 6 12:30:51 2015 UTC,"I think that's the key.  All the reviews are bad because reviewers only saw the first 3 episodes.  I watched 4 straight, by the end of 4 I was hooked. After that I burned through and it was awesome.    I feel like its trendy now to be negative on wochowski films.  But this was made for Netflix and it was exactly what I expected. I enjoyed it.  Then again I also liked Jupiter Ascending beyond the dialogue...   I love SciFi and this show was solid. Ive stopped reading Netflix reviewers because its obvious they haven't even watched the whole show.  They shit on Marco Polo and I loved that show too."
bestofnetflix,38rthb,ForestKing,3,Sat Jun 6 19:15:12 2015 UTC,Cloud Atlas is one of my favorite movies ever.  I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of Jupiter Ascending.  If I was high then it'd be a different story.
bestofnetflix,38rthb,IntentionalMisnomer,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:51:41 2015 UTC,The weird thing is...I liked everything about Jupiter Ascending except for Kunis and Tatum.  I feel like they were forced into the movie by the studios...  The dialogue was atrocious... The him being a wolf and them making jokes about wanting to fuck their dog was so dumb...  But the world they built and the ships... They were refreshing and impressive.  In fact I couldnt help thinking that a Wochowski Dune would be pretty badass...
bestofnetflix,38rthb,ferapy,0,Sun Jun 7 02:09:49 2015 UTC,Wachowski*  Sorry.  Your spelling error just annoyed the fuck out of me.  I didn't watch enough of it to take it seriously.  It was just terrible.

bestofnetflix,38rthb,temujinkhan321,5,Sat Jun 6 10:53:17 2015 UTC,"Just finished watching all of Season 1. If I can offer one piece of advice it would be to keep an open mind and don't form an opinion until after episode 6. I was hooked from the start, but I can understand the critical views of people judging it after the first few episodes. I absolutely LOVED this series and I am a huge fan of The Wachowskis. After the 6th episode if you are not completely hooked you might need to check your pulse. The task to develop 8 separate characters is a huge task and I thought they did a fantastic job. One of my favorite series on Netflix. I recommend every person to give this series a try and not be dissuaded by the critical reviews."
bestofnetflix,38rthb,temujinkhan321,5,Sat Jun 6 21:49:06 2015 UTC,2 episodes in and really enjoying it so far. Hoping it pays off on the idea. The opening setup was really well staged. Was totally onboard after the first 10 minutes.
bestofnetflix,38rthb,ForestKing,6,Sat Jun 6 08:40:16 2015 UTC,"I should also mention that this series is not only written and directed by the Wachowskis, but J.

bestofnetflix,38p89g,the_ram_that_bops,2,Sat Jun 6 03:21:44 2015 UTC,"I gave it a try but it's just...it's hard to describe.  It lacks the ""punch"" of Breaking Bad.  It's pretty well acted, fairly well directed, some of the editing is kind of wonky but it's a quality series.  The problem is. Breaking Bad goes out of the way to really knock you for a loop while watching and this series, while good, just lacks that effort.  I'll provide an example from the first episode, hopefully without spoiling anything, the Winnebago in the American series veers off the road, down into a ditch and BAM it slams hard into the rocky edge of the ditch.  There's a real impact to be felt.  You can almost feel it in your teeth.  In the Columbian version it drives over a few rocks and comes to a stop."

bestofnetflix,37yaqa,Mechanical_Owl,17,Sun May 31 14:30:18 2015 UTC,Just a point of clarification: there's nothing illegal in using a different node when accessing Netflix if you're a paying customer.  Edit: down votes without explaining why. Not very conducive to teaching or convincing.

bestofnetflix,37yaqa,ohno,2,Sun May 31 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"No doubt. It's the confusion between who is the relevant authority figure (government or corporate), compounded by the ignorance regarding VPNs."

bestofnetflix,37orfq,npJustForReading,3,Fri May 29 06:49:07 2015 UTC,"Section 11. Criticism by Levon Helm of article  The Last Waltz:       Levon Helm, in his 1993 autobiography This Wheel's on Fire, expresses serious reservations about Scorsese's handling of the film, claiming that Scorsese and Robbie Robertson (who produced the film) conspired to make the Band look like Robbie Robertson's sidemen. He states that Robertson, who is depicted singing powerful backing vocals, was actually singing into a microphone that was turned off throughout most of the concert (a typical practice during their live performances).   Helm also discusses Manuel's and Hudson's minimal screen time, such as when Manuel sings during the closing number ""I Shall Be Released"", but Manuel is hidden behind the phalanx of guest performers. There are several shots catching Ronnie Hawkins looking around but not singing, yet Manuel remains invisible. However, during the same segment, in the background, it appears that a cameraman is attempting to get a shot of Manuel at the piano but gives up due to technical problems or the impossibility of the shot.   Helm went so far as to say that Last Waltz was ""the biggest fuckin' rip-off that ever happened to the Band"", citing that he, Manuel, Danko and Hudson never received any money for the various home videos, DVDs and soundtracks released by Warner Bros. after the project.

It seemed to me like it was more an advertisement for a vegan lifestyle without using the word ""vegan"" and instead calling it a ""whole foods, plant based diet"" over and over again. The results are great, but there are other ways to cure obesity."
bestofnetflix,35ukm9,quirkymonster,6,Wed May 13 18:15:31 2015 UTC,"They are right to draw a distinction between a plant based diet and vegan. Vegan is a philosophy with a large dietary component. Vegans extend the rejection of animal products to things like leather clothing, honey or the use of bone derived clarification of beer (for example, Guinness is not vegan due to the use of isinglass for clarification). The justification for this is a philosophical statement about the relative merits of animal and human intelligence. It may not be a philosophy you agree with, or even recognize as a coherent, or well thought out, but it is a philosophy.    By comparison, the plant based diet being advocated in Forks over Knives has no philosophical component. It is strictly focused on increasing health. There are no injunctions against the use of leather or honey and their stance on beer is more practical (don't do it to excess). The results and recommendations are driven by the studies cited in the show and in this thread by crazymusicman. If one disagrees, the science is there to critique.    And yes, the results are great, extending far beyond obesity and into cancer prevention and increased cardiovascular health. And as for the other cures for obesity, given it's still epidemic nature, very few other solutions really offer so simple, inexpensive and effective a prescription."

There is also primitive research on unprocessed foods' straches being less completely absrobed relative to processed foods. Or this video review about processed meat and carcinogens in the body  The long term consequences of choosing this over that is not visible by only looking at calories in/out.  The bigger point of this movie, however, is to show the benefits of a plant based (vegan) diet and the risks of a animal protein based diet. Particularly with heart disease - the USA's #1 killer - an animal protein diet is a huge risk factor. Animal proteins are high in saturated fat and cholesterol and sodium. Then when it comes to cancer (#2 killer) there is a growing body of evidence that shows a plant based diet is the single best preventative measure one can take. I could link to a bunch of studies, but I will link to a doctors review videos that each have links to these studies.  diet is #1 is preventing cancer how finland's national approach to science based nutrition has curved mortality of non communicative diseases how there is ""no discussion at all of the scientific research on the health consequences of eating meat"" by the committee developing the USDA Dietary Guidelines Over 14 years, a plant based is more effective than 14 years of daily strenuous exercise at preventing cancer growth in vitro even two weeks on a plant based diet improves the body's ability to fight cancer  generally, just check out this list of videos on lifestyle and cancer, each with their own sources"

And even if all of those truly are negatives, what about all of the positives of meat consumption?  Meat is nutrient dense, doesn't raise blood sugar, and has some very important vitamins and minerals that are next to impossible to source from other foods, at least in a bio-available form.  Not to mention the amino acid benefits of meat."
bestofnetflix,35ukm9,well_here_I_am,0,Sat May 16 21:55:21 2015 UTC,"I never said fat makes you fat. I said that saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium are all contributors to heart disease. You haven't addressed any of the links about cancer so let's just stick with animal products consequences on heart disease then.  So can you name me some meat that is low in all three? like I originally asked for? Is there evidence you have that LDL doesn't contribute to plaque? I will grant you that beef and chicken and fish are lower in sodium than I expected (I had to look that up). What are sources I can look up for ""the whole sodium issue has also been turned on its head recently""?  Plant proteins are about 10% less bio-available compared to animal sources, which aren't 100% absorb-able either. With the exceptions of pea and egg proteins. Nuts are nutrient dense. Cooked leafy greens or beans or mushrooms are nutrient dense. Most vegan foods are fiber rich, which stabilizes blood sugar. Plenty of vegan foods are ""complete"" proteins in that they have all essential amino acids - chickpeas and mushrooms and cauliflower come to mind."

A few scenes end rather abruptly, and it loses most of its steam in the final 20-30 minutes.

Having had both sets of grandparents go west to homestead, my opinion is based on actual events. When she asks the neighbor man to marry her, he would have said yes and the movie would have been over. She was land rich and her ranch was prospering. He wouldn't have cared if she was ugly or deformed, as long as she could get on a horse and herd cattle. Bossy and strong willed? Damned straight. but any woman who could survive a hard winter on the open plains was worth her weight in salt. My grandfather, who had big aspirations, acquired 2600 acres by hook and by crook, back in the day, and one way he did it was by marrying the college educated woman who owned the neighboring section."

bestofnetflix,34z9hm,lazyman73125,2,Tue May 5 23:23:04 2015 UTC,Not really that I recall. It focuses a lot more on his process versus Takahata's and shows minimal clips from either of their movies. It goes into very little detail about the content of either of their films.
bestofnetflix,34z9hm,badattitude4u,1 point,Tue May 5 23:49:57 2015 UTC,"Do you recommend watching one of his films before I watch this doc, or does it not matter?"
bestofnetflix,34z9hm,lazyman73125,2,Tue May 5 23:52:42 2015 UTC,Honestly yes. It really presupposes that you are familiar with Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli and it references a lot of works with a sort of reverence that I feel like would seem hollow out of context.
bestofnetflix,34z9hm,badattitude4u,2,Wed May 6 00:10:41 2015 UTC,"Ok, one more question, I swear. ;) Which film do you recommend watching first by Miyazaki? Thanks."
bestofnetflix,34z9hm,lazyman73125,4,Wed May 6 00:32:51 2015 UTC,"Haha no need to apologize. I started with Spirited Away which is probably his most purely imaginative film and a movie I thoroughly enjoy.  However, I think most people would recommend you start with Princess Mononoke  because it's probably more accessible, grounded, and substitantive and I don't think they'd be wrong but you really couldn't go wrong either way."
bestofnetflix,34z9hm,badattitude4u,3,Wed May 6 00:41:56 2015 UTC,"Spirited away and Princess Mononoke took me away from this world for 2 hours as a child. Watching them again as an adult made me realize how symbolic, profound, and beautiful the films are."

Ended up turning it off because it was repetitive -_-   Keep watching Brotherhood. The original FMA started while the manga was still running, and caught up around the fifth laboratory arc (maybe 20 episodes in or so?). After that, it deviates very, very far from the source material.  Brotherhood was fully developed after the manga ended, and follows the creator's intended storyline much better. I think Brotherhood is tough to get into initially because it really shortcuts some of the earlier material, at least partially because people already saw those things in the original series.  Ultimately both of the animes are good in their own way and very different experiences. There are a few dramatic moments earlier in the series that the original handles better (like Nina and Alexander, and Hughes), but ultimately I think the second half of Brotherhood is much stronger than the original."
bestofnetflix,34f1h5,jseanbrooks,2,Mon May 4 19:05:24 2015 UTC,"Leaves? NOOOO!! This is a great show. and like /u/uberdungeon says check out brotherhood too.

bestofnetflix,34f1h5,monkey7247,1 point,Sat May 2 04:40:15 2015 UTC,Will it is better i'd say watch the 2003 one first then brotherhood as brotherhood spends less time repeating 2003 than the other way.
bestofnetflix,34dnqk,l0rdv4d3r,6,Thu Apr 30 08:35:13 2015 UTC,"Hot Fuzz is a personal favorite of mine, but Babadook - as I think about it more and more - I find myself disliking.  I liked it upon first viewing. I didn't go to bed afraid of the dark, I thought the voice used for the Babadook was INCREDIBLY cheesy, like pull me out of this film cheesy, but I didn't hate it. I liked the concept that the monster was depression and thus it lived in the basement.  But then I kept thinking about it; man that was an underwhelming film. It's being heralded as the best modern horror film, as better than any other contender (Conjuring being the main one people pit it against with good reason as the two are similar enough but one puts a little more oomph in the monster).   But really, is it truly that good? Was the monster design good? No. Looked like a cartoon character. Was the sound good? Hardly, forgettable score and laughable monster voice. Were the themes good and integrated well? No, same old at best, hit you in the face at worst.  So it's just another modern horror film. But I don't get why it's being seen as this amazing BEST HORROR EVER film, when It Follows also recently came out and literally had 100x what Babadook had. It had a better monster, SIGNIFICANTLY better sound (I literally listen to the soundtrack quite often), and thematic devices that, while not unique in any way, done well and an homage to horror films of the 70's and 80's.  That's just me though. It's not a waste of time, but it's not the best thing ever made as some claim."
bestofnetflix,34dnqk,Watertor,1 point,Fri May 1 04:54:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think the monster was actually even meant to be all that scary.  Personally, the most scary part was the mothers' fall into insanity, and the fear that her son has for her approaching the end of the movie.  The scene where she is standing over her son with the knife in the living room was particularly horrifying."

bestofnetflix,34dnqk,wykydtronsf,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"For the record in regards to my comment. Three Kings is by no means a bad movie. I just keep seeing it heralded as this amazing movie all over reddit. It was anything but to me.   I haven't see Life Itself or Babdook yet but the rest of that list is solid. Although it could have used more diversity. While spinal tap, Hot Fuzz and Big Lebowski are extremely different. They're still at their cores a comedy. I would have preferred to see one of Netflix's better Foreign movie offerings in their stead. Some examples, I Saw the Devil, Let the Right One In, or The Man From Nowhere."

I was feeling a little curious and after reading some good reviews on it decided to watch this documentary. It does a great job of presenting the story from different points of view and all of them of people who were one way or another involved with Jonestown. Before watching this documentary I thought these people were just crazy cult followers but in reality, there’s something a lot deeper and darker behind it. Also it’s very well acted – not like other docudramas I’ve seen in which the acting is a huge turn-off."

bestofnetflix,33lefp,aveydey,6,Thu Apr 23 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie from the moment I saw the first trailer where they all walk through the space-police lineup.  It hit theaters in August of '14.  In May of '14 I lost my Mom to a sudden and unpredictable brain hemorrhage.  I wasn't really sure what kind of movie I would be seeing and was just hoping for a fun escape from my broken heart.  I can not express enough how deeply this movie touched me.  From the first scene when Quill loses his mother, despite being 30 years old I was that little boy screaming outside the hospital.  I knew that kid's pain right down to the unopened birthday card (my Mom died 1 week before my birthday and I discovered a birthday card she had prepared for me).  I went from tears streaming out of my eyes when Quill loses his mother to smiling and laughing as he dances around an abandoned world fucking with space lizards.  I was riveted for every minute of that film.  James Gunn really nailed how it feels to, in the words of Star-Lord, ""be a loser"".  The feelings of loss, loneliness, family and what it's like to be an outsider are portrayed beautifully and seamlessly.    Even the soundtrack is great! Yeah, they're all forgotten hits from the 70s and 80s, but in this anthology they really capture the tone of the film.  I listened to that soundtrack almost endlessly through that summer.  If Star Wars is a space opera, Guardians of the Galaxy is a space rock opera.  Gunn had the music blasting during filming so the actors and crew could properly use the music to enhance their performances.  This movie is for the misfits and the losers.  My girlfriend and I saw it 4 times in the theatre and I love the characters, world and music.  I can not recommend enough... People who don't like this movie, well, they probably don't know what it feels like to be an outsider or a loser."

The Meet The Spartans movie (and all the Movie-Movies) are terrible films that thinks making a reference in a funny voice is the same as making a joke, which it isn't.  Wet Hot American Summer was a great movie. Hot Rod follows in it's footsteps. So does this. I really liked it.   They are all silly movies, but they have heart, and they are nowhere near as dumb as Meet The Spartans.   Edit: in my opinion"

Already frustrated with a lack of explanation of his powers (ex : ""tell me whats in the room"" ""yeah, sure no problem""), and his abilities (my Dad was a tough sonuvabitch boxer, so I'm an insanely good martial artist). The fight scene's are tight, but the one at the end of episode 2 felt more like a ripoff than an ode to Oldboy's. Seems like they're trying to make Kingpin more complicated than he heeds to be. And finally what the fuck? Was that Bullseye who fucked him up at the begining of episode 2? Is he coming back? C'mon!   I'm still going to finish it. I do enjoy it enough for that, i'll just quit being a sourpuss. It still kind of cracks me up they put a Mighty Duck in it."
bestofnetflix,3339kd,yourkindhere,6,Sun Apr 19 18:46:07 2015 UTC,"They explain some of the back story more later, especially once you meet Stick. His powers are basically enhanced speed, strength, and reflexes, all four of his normal senses being enhanced, his ""radar sense"" that let's him know where things are based on electromagnetics iirc, and other senses such as sensing air pressure or something.

bestofnetflix,3339kd,Hopper23,2,Tue Apr 21 03:21:45 2015 UTC,"Foggy's not just about comic relief though.  Stick tried to teach Matthew that his emotions held him back from his full potential.  Matthew understands this, but can't let go of his feelings regardless, so the best he can do is try to control and not outwardly display them.  So it's sort of through Foggy's over-expression of emotions that we get to experience some of the emotions that Matthew holds deep inside, realizing that Matthew feels the exact same ways as Foggy does, but just can't allow himself to express those feelings in the same way."

I for one loved it.  I fucking loved it.  It's okay that people disagree because we all have different tastes, but I just wanted to say for those who haven't seen it yet:  there are plenty of us who believe it's an excellent film.  Critics were raving about this before I saw it, so I went in with high expectations, but still ended up extremely impressed.  Watch it yourself and see what you think.  In order to help you gauge whether or not we share similar tastes, I am a huge fan of the horror genre.  However, my preferences are for supernatural horror that deals with human psychology and the human condition.  Gore doesn't scare me.  I consider it cheap if used inappropriately (as I feel it is in the sub-genre of ""torture-porn"").  Same with jump-scares.    Please feel free to disagree with me, but let's stay civil."

bestofnetflix,32wpf2,concretegirl87,2,Mon Apr 20 20:09:04 2015 UTC,I've seen this movie in a sneak preview. The whole cinema couldn't stop laughing because it was unbelievably bad.
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,aqswdefrgthzjukilo,3,Sun May 3 22:35:20 2015 UTC,"I saw this well before it was hyped up, and while I respect it for creating one of the most original, genuinely terrifying horror villains to grace the screen in quite some time, I felt the 'less is more' approach the filmmakers took as far as the actual amount of screen time the titular character gets to be the major disappointment for me.    And this is probably just me, but for some reason every moment spent with the mother gave me the same uncomfortable feeling I experienced during my first viewing of Requiem for a Dream - specifically any of the scenes with the mother on speed.   EDIT: Also I feel in the right hands, a sequel could be amazing."
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,ChanceyGardener,3,Sat Apr 18 22:09:35 2015 UTC,"I definitely respect your opinion.  I was excited to see it and that could be the problem... It was overly hyped for me and I came out in the end feeling meh.   The atmosphere was amazingly perfect.  I felt creeped out.  The sound of the Babadook is what did it for me.  The looks of the creature didn't fit right with me, but that's OK.   Overall,  I would rate it 5.5/10  ;   I have still yet to see  It Follows, which I heard was supposed to be amazing (hopefully not another letdown)."
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,aids_bot,17,Sat Apr 18 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"absolutely loved it. original, creepy and sometimes funny take on the haunted house format! i'm australian, and sometimes i wonder if it's the drab and depressing lower class australian-ness that turns some people off it."
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,ozias_leduc,2,Fri Apr 17 12:37:55 2015 UTC,Off topic a bit but I love and crave the scary Australian films that feature the crazy vastness and isolation that you have and the scary folks that are living out there waiting for you. That is horror right there!
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,motherofkatana,3,Fri Apr 17 21:32:55 2015 UTC,Wolf Creek wasn't a bad Australian horror. That guy who played the villain did a great job.
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,GeeSpot007,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:32:55 2015 UTC,Agreed!
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,motherofkatana,12,Sat Apr 18 00:44:03 2015 UTC,The kid and the mother were both really great. But the last 1/4 of the movie lost me.
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,adineko,4,Fri Apr 17 13:25:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think there are two things going on with that boy. For one, he appears to have high functioning autism, hence why he is easily agitated and his grasp on reality seems distant. It also explains her unfortunate resentment of him and his overly aggressive outbursts, and why she's scared of him choking her (because he probably did at some point). One of my best friends has a child with severe autism and she suffers with a lot of the same issues. The ending kinda lost me, too. I thought the movie was a fun, atmospheric ride up until the close. Mental illness (on multiple levels) was definitely the crux of this story, but I didn't think that came across in the way it was intended, and that's probably because the mythos of the monster sold the audience before they reached the more metaphorical conclusion. It's disappointing to see such distaste for the film here in the comments, but to each their own. I really appreciated the film's production value, performances and moody atmosphere (the blue tinted house was particularly oppressive and sad). I'm also impressed with the film considering the $30k budget. What the director manages to pull off on with so little money is admirable."
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,SirNarwhal,6,Fri Apr 17 22:43:16 2015 UTC,It's not metaphorical if you pay attention. Even from the first scene you can tell that she is actually the Babadook and she wrote this book and had snapped long before the film even started and was planning on killing her son.
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,Zer0_the_Her0,2,Sat Apr 18 03:57:22 2015 UTC,Uhm wat? ELI5? I saw the movie and did not get that interpretation at all
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,SirNarwhal,-2,Thu Apr 30 23:56:02 2015 UTC,One sentence summary: she wrote the book; she is the Babadook.

bestofnetflix,32wpf2,john_o,9,Fri May 1 01:00:52 2015 UTC,"I really liked the concept and the atmosphere was good, but there were a few things that really bugged me.  The obvious one is the kid.  I personally think he did a good job, but the problem is he did too good of a job.  He was supposed to be an annoying kid, and god damn did it work.  More importantly, the soundtrack really took me out of it.  It was just more of the cheesy ""la la la"" little kid choir cliche.  It's supposed to sound creepy but it always comes across as silly to me.  For insight into what I usually like, I think It Follows had a perfect horror movie soundtrack."

bestofnetflix,32wpf2,Mirracle,17,Fri Apr 17 18:43:55 2015 UTC,I consider myself a pretty big horror buff and I think the film is pretty mediocre.  Definitely worth watching if you have the time for it but I wouldn't go out of my to watch it.  The child acting really broke my immersion but it had some really nice effects and was pretty scary.  Overall 6/10
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,SirNarwhal,3,Fri Apr 17 12:32:59 2015 UTC,"I can't even consider it a horror movie, quite frankly. Without spoiling, it's much more a movie about mental illness in reality than horror."
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,JanineIRL,7,Fri Apr 17 17:58:18 2015 UTC,"I was going to say the same thing. I feel like I'm the only one who wasn't impressed by this movie. It was alright (definitely not horrible or anything) and thematically it was enjoyable...but as a whole it just didn't do it for me.   I see nothing but awesome reviews for this movie and was psyched to finally see it - but ended up being pretty let down. Then again,  I also feel like it's been years since I've seen a legitimately good horror movie, so maybe I'm just cynical."
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,AllwaysConfused,3,Fri Apr 17 13:13:19 2015 UTC,Ditto. The Babadook book featured in the movie was cool but the child's acting really broke it for me. I felt like I spent most of the movie watching a whiny bratty child throw a temper tantrum.
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,JanineIRL,3,Fri Apr 17 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed! I mean, I get that being a single parent can be stressful and that was the underlining theme of the movie - but half the time I wanted to slap that kid across the head. No wonder she went crazy."
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,rukind91,2,Fri Apr 17 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"I must be cynical too, I completely agree with you.  If you want to see a movie for the sake of seeing an overrated movie this is the one... Paid for this movie after seeing all the reviews, and was incredibly disappointed.  Hey if you haven't seen It Follows, I think you'll love it (I paid to see this in theaters).  Best horror movie I have seen since Let the Right One In... But in my opinion that movie is good as a standalone film.    It Follows is a nod to eighties horror films, and the premise actually makes you feel horrified... STDs are scary!"
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,JanineIRL,3,Fri Apr 17 13:24:15 2015 UTC,"I think I would have been pretty upset if I had actually paid to see it. I feel like the genre is saturated with shitty movies right now, so when one comes around that is sightly better than average it gets hailed as a masterpiece. It's not a masterpiece - it's just a little bit better than all the garbage people have been swallowing lately.  God, just typing that sentence made me feel old and crotchety lol"
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,rukind91,2,Fri Apr 17 13:26:34 2015 UTC,Yeah its a perfect movie for netflix since you've already paid for it... But honestly would have loved the time to watch a different movie.

bestofnetflix,32wpf2,rukind91,2,Fri Apr 17 16:42:39 2015 UTC,"With no spoilers, it leaves you wanting more.  Some may see the film as just dropping off, but I definitely could have sat through another thirty minutes.  I much prefer this over a film that explains everything, falls flat, and then drags out a resolution that is mediocre.  The soundtrack alone is modern and retro and worth checking out, but I would suggest waiting to see the movie so you can experience it for the first time with the film...  This film has style imho.  And I have very high standards for horror films (trying not to sound to pretentious, but seriously why is it fifty years later and movies like Rosemary's Baby and The Shining have no modern equivalents (imo of course)...   I will sit through mediocre horror flicks, but that doesn't mean I will be blown away.  I don't want to hype the movie up too much.  I had low expectations going in, and was pleasantly surprised.  If you check it out, report back.  Maybe i'm just crazy!  The premise actually made feel like: fuck that nope nope nope I do not want that happening to me.  Psychologically it was disturbing, and that's what I look for in a horror movie...  I don't need gore or tons of over the top violence. Too often (imo) violence is over the top in horror movies and adds a level of ridiculousness that makes them hard to relate to."

For me, the entire point of going to see a horror movie is that thrill of being scared. While a lot of movies rely on ""torture porn"" or jump scares, this film utilized thematic elements that (again imo) really got under the skin.  When watching it, I was brought right back that scared feeling you'd get as a kid. It was honestly anxiety inducing (in all the right ways). Very well done."

bestofnetflix,32wpf2,angrytortilla,5,Fri May 22 23:43:41 2015 UTC,The circle jerk on reddit over this movie is unreal. It's passable as horror but you gotta have proper actors to make it scary.
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,Donger69,4,Fri Apr 17 16:12:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I thought the acting by Noah Wiseman (the little boy) was on par with Danny Lloyd, the child actor from The Shining."
bestofnetflix,32wpf2,Mirracle,2,Fri Apr 17 12:42:36 2015 UTC,"While I disagree, even if the acting was on the same level this child had a much larger role to play in terms of his performance being believable is one of the core aspects that the movie relied on in order to carry the story.  I personally hate child actors in large roles because I've never seen one that didn't break my immersion to some extent."

bestofnetflix,32984o,legatic,2,Sun Apr 12 16:16:04 2015 UTC,"For those that have been wanting to see Marvel experiment with more serious material, the wait is over. Daredevil is bloodier, darker, and edgier than anything the Marvel Cinematic Universe has done thus far. Characters are well developed, the villainous threats feel real, and the action is very well done (E2 hallway scene & the E5 car scene for two examples).  Best of all, I firmly believe Kingpin/Wilson Fisk is the best MCU villain to date. The strength of his character is drawn from the smart decision to draw parallels between him and the protagonist, Matt Murdock/Daredevil. He's far and away the most relatable, sympathetic, and most human character that Marvel's cinematic universe has to offer. Seeing as Loki is a demigod, Ultron is a robot, and Thanos is an alien titan who acquires a gauntlet that makes him do basically anything he wants, Kingpin may hold this distinction for a long while.  Be warned that while there's bits of humor sprinkled throughout, but the tone resembles The Dark Knight more than it does any of the lighthearted/humorous MCU films. Adjust those expectations accordingly."

Specifics in the spoiler section below.   The first transformation sequence starts with his penis. There's a werewolf human sex scene with female nudity. A lot of people get shot, and a lot of people get mutilated. One guy gets his eye stabbed out, another guy gets his face ripped off and runs around screaming.

The character clashes in a beautiful way with what the show was. The same can't be said for Will Ferrel's character. I think his three-episode story arch is the worst part of The Office, by miles."
bestofnetflix,31pkc3,faster_than_sound,-9,Tue Apr 7 22:32:30 2015 UTC,"British Office first, to see the roots.   US Office second, to get extra luls.   I personally like the British Office better."
bestofnetflix,31pkc3,Porrick,12,Tue Apr 7 23:18:43 2015 UTC,"Eh, the British version lays down the foundation, but the characters in the American version are undeniably better and more fleshed out.  Take Gareth vs. Dwight, for example. Gareth is fairly one dimensional, essentially filling the ""creepy guy"" role. But he isn't as full as Dwight is. You never really get a true feel for who Gareth is outside of being Tim's foil and David's lackey. Dwight, on the other hand, is entirely his own person, with a fleshed out background, and a very distinct personality.   Another good example is David vs. Michael. David is kind of a douche. He's pretty much just unlikable in every scene, simply because he's written to be the sleazy guy in the office that everyone can rally around to hate. Michael, while still being pretty insufferable, has many endearing qualities, such as an intense loyalty to his staff and his desire to just be loved for example, and in the end is a far more likable character than David.  The main difference between David and Michael is that David is so egotistical that he assumes everyone loves him, and Michael has such low self esteem that he desperately hopes and wants everyone to love him. That's a very important difference to the likability of the characters, imo."
bestofnetflix,31pkc3,m63646,2,Tue Apr 7 23:33:31 2015 UTC,"That's a function of the American one having so much more time with all the characters. The same is true of the American House of Cards - the British one is far more caricature-based, more compact, and better in the first season.  The American versions of both HoC and The Office really get going when they stop trying to tell the exact same stories as the originals, and embrace what is new and different about the re-imagined characters.  The only problem I have with the American The Office is that it is a far more conventional sitcom than the original. It's a very good sitcom, of course, so I can't really get worked up over it.  Edit: To your David-vs-Michael comparison, I think this is a really good microcosm of the difference between British and American comedy. Brits want their Unsympathetic Comedy Protagonists to be genuinely unsympathetic, while Americans tend to prefer that there are redeeming graces.   Here's Stephen Fry shiteing on about it more eloquently than I can  Edit 2: He loses me at the end there - there are plenty of neurotics in American comedy, and lots of American comedy about failure. I think the main difference, though, is that the American comics want you to be on their side."
bestofnetflix,31pkc3,Porrick,3,Tue Apr 7 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"Fry nutshells British comedy fairly well there but he doesn't begin to understand American comedy, at least going by what he said there."

bestofnetflix,31ahih,DrHenryPym,6,Fri Apr 3 08:33:23 2015 UTC,"I was really surprised on this one. Didn't think I'd like it at first...only because the beginning scene seemed so cheesy. I love Joaquin Phoenix as an actor so I continued with the movie. His performance obviously is incomparable to his more recent films but you could tell he was still learning. He seemed like he was reciting lines instead of interpreting them as the character at times. Ed Harris was fantastic in this movie. I read that he was picked to do the Top but he felt more identifiable with Lt. Bergman. There were some scenes that annoyed me. One being how the lower ranked soldiers acted around the higher ranked soldiers. Obviously, this is a movie so I had to ignore it.  This is a good film and has some really great moments."
bestofnetflix,31ahih,familyinchords,2,Fri Apr 3 23:40:37 2015 UTC,"I am so glad to finally see this up on streaming, this is absolutely one of the funniest movies ever made. Based on a Robert O' Connor's novel of the same name.   I actually was in my teens around the time the movie took place in a military family and remember reading in the military times magazines about all the problems with criminal activities within the military itself. It ultimately led to a decision not to join when I previously had been committed to doing so. My father also retired from the military around that time because he couldn't stand it anymore.  I've talked to friends over the years about what it was like during that time, with this movie they can finally see how bad it was.  In the early 1980's it led to a service wide stand down of the military so they could clean out the bad apples, only to have to relax standards when the second Gulf War started up after 9-11 and they couldn't get enough recruits to fight the war.   Also this review from a former Army brat who reviewed the film on Netflix, apologies in advance for posting without their permission, just wanted to prove my point that life in the military was not all roses and sunshine during those years.  'As a former Army brat, that grew up in West Germany. I must say this movie is 100% accurate. I do not know if the events in this movie took place the way they said it did. But too much of what they were describing in this film were very much a way of life. When the wall came down, and capitolism took to the east. It really was, ""Steal all you can Steal."" This movie is in no way ""anti-Army"". It shows the ambitious side of self preservation. So you can then say this movie is very, ""Pro American.""'"

I can't recommend Mr. Nobody enough, an excellent cerebral film, I feel doesn't get enough credit in most discussions. Short Term 12 is a very well done story, however all in all, I wouldn't exactly call it ground breaking. Submarine is worth a look if you like The Arctic Monkeys/Alex Turner, as he did the entire sound track. Detachment is okay... Bare with me, its a good film, but it almost tries to hard to be ""weird"", still worth a watch if you like Adrien Brody."
bestofnetflix,31357o,NahToday,4,Wed Apr 1 20:32:41 2015 UTC,Mr. Nobody is my favorite one on that list!  Phenomenal film that doesn't get nearly enough recognition.  Submarine appears to be the only on the list that is no longer streaming. (in US at least)
bestofnetflix,31357o,GinjaNinger,3,Wed Apr 1 20:41:46 2015 UTC,"My problem with Detachment was that the film tried to be too many things without being any one thing. It started with a sort of documentary feel, but drifted away and then back again, only to shift gears again. Great premise. Brody was fun to watch. But just not enough focus to really slam it home.  Edit, wrong word."

bestofnetflix,31357o,predalienmack,6,Wed Apr 1 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"The Station Agent is an odd film. It's at times depressing, but the realistic characters and their relationships really bring the film to life in a relatable way. Dinklage is fantastic in the film, demonstrating (with a much earlier film) that he is far more skilled and dynamic as an actor than just being a perfect fit to play the witty Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones. The film addresses the elephant in the room that would naturally occur in any realistic story with Dinklage playing a character: his naturally short stature. The film does this in a mature way and, through the quality writing and Dinklage's acting, makes his natural disadvantages in society and how those factors affect his character relatable and understandable to the viewer, which is a relatively rare quality. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a ""different"" character-focused movie to watch."

bestofnetflix,31357o,Watertor,2,Thu Apr 2 04:36:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you mean by ""like it""  Do you mean movies where protagonist has a problem like Dwarfism that is an ""elephant in the room"" scenario on top of an otherwise totally normal character and helps take what would be a derivative (even if handled well like Station Agent) plot and transcend it?  Or do you mean movies where protagonist is a quiet person being pushed around on several fronts to be more outgoing and, through natural character arcs, becomes more social and reveals to their friends and us what their true personality is and what they can offer the world?  I like both kinds of movies, personally. The Way Way Back is a personal favorite of the latter. It's coming-of-age but it's handled realistically like Station, and the quirk is (with most coming-of-age films) teenage awkwardness. However, I think this particular film handles it near-perfectly, and we get great performances from the lead, Steve Carell, and Sam Rockwell, the crazy guy from Green Mile and lead of Moon fame.  As for the former, it depends on how close you want it to be to Station Agent. I think As Good as it Gets with Jack Nicholson is very similar. Instead of a physical disability, it's more of an OCD type of character - not the tumblr/reddit kind of OCD where something is out of place so people ""dislike"" it, but real OCD where you need to do something a certain way or else your brain spirals out of control. The character juggles with romance, society in general, how to be social, as I said it has several of the themes of Station.   But then also we could branch out to Forrest Gump, Bubble Boy even (though I don't think many people like it but I'm a sucker for Gyllenhaal).   There are more but it's late and I'm struggling to pull many films from memory. Hope that helps though."

On the other hand, it uses almost allegorical metaphors and imagery that gets you thinking right off the bat.  It doesn't have a steep learning curve.

bestofnetflix,305g74,lastshot,2,Wed Mar 25 06:29:35 2015 UTC,"What happened is that there are aspects of the world as experienced where a given set of conditions can yield more than one possible outcome, depending upon the path taken, like a cusp in Catastrophe Theory.  The incongruities get suppressed by our neural processing, like continuity errors in movies, which we notice only occasionally.  Like a Necker cube, reality can appear to shift suddenly, and we intuit that what we are witnessing is some kind of illusion, and assume that there must be a more stable reality underlying the world as perceived.  Many recent movies have been dealing in one way or another with the sense that reality is richer and more complex than the image which meets our eyes.  In Awake, the protagonist knows that what he experiences is real, despite the growing clarity that the phenomena he observes is explainable as a psychological defense mechanism.  Similarly we know that the story did not end when the show was cancelled.  Its visualization has only become more demanding."

The trick of slow-releasing glimpses of the past and future really help to create momentum.  By contrast, we've been watching also American Crime (on ABC), and even though the quality of everything in it is superb, it has begun to feel as if each show is just a set of vignettes with little movement. I find myself looking forward to watching the next episode of Bloodline much more, perhaps partly because it feels as when you watch it you feel like you're on a moving train, time has a direction, events are unfolding inexorably and you know something is going to happen; and we will get to find out more about those brief and puzzling flash forwards and flash backs."

bestofnetflix,2zecns,laser-TITS,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"For me this movie worked even beyond showing how immoral it is for news outlets to chase ratings. Yes, this is an extreme version but it's a story. And this is movie does a fantastic job of storytelling. You have a situation where a sociopath has found his niche in media. It's not that far-fetched. A lot of successful people have very sociopathic tendencies, it keeps them from slowing down for what others seem to worry about.   Lou basically operates as a business, but in human-form. So you don't have to relate to him, but you can relate to people around him. Those who are appalled at his actions. You have the outright skeptic (Frank), the intrigued (Nina), and the cautious (Rick). At the very least, one of these characters will match your viewpoint and give you some perspective.   On top of that, the acting is superb. Honestly I think it may be Jake's best work since Zodiac. All in all, it's a haunting, chilling, well-told story and a great film. In my opinion of course."

bestofnetflix,2zecns,noprotein,15,Wed Mar 18 06:12:31 2015 UTC,"Lol. Truly a film connoisseur. One who MUST identify/sympathize with a character to enjoy a story. Sometimes, it's just an introspective into an aspect of society with an exaggerated story or characters. Ever watch a Lynch flick? Weird shit happens, you don't like or understand the people, you're not sure what's a dream and then it ends. Nothing answered, only questions.  Film is not just spoon feeding, it's still technically art and may require a bit more to understand or appreciate. I hated all the characters in it and very much loved the movie. Also called it in saying it wouldn't be well received because of that exact fact (of which many here have proven true)."

Also worth noting for those with no knowledge of what the Irish War of Independence . . . this is an incredibly violent and sad film."

I ended up getting sucked in.  The plot itself isn't anything new or special, but what made me love it was the b-movie/bad effects that were really reminiscent of old school movies. The film makes no attempt at making the creatures seem real (as some zombie movies do) and doesn't attempt to take itself seriously. It felt like those silly b-movies from the 50's, but with color and intricate details.   It's also found footage, which I adore.   It's very gory, violent, etc. Humorous and not overly dark or serious. A fun movie that immediately launched to my top ten. If you're looking for something fun and gory this is a great choice."

bestofnetflix,2z9vgi,GravCat,10,Mon Mar 16 20:49:25 2015 UTC,"This movie is amazing, both as a zombie movie and a product of the 1960's. As a zombie movie, Romero is basically laying the foundations of the genre: zombies eat people, can't talk, shuffle/run, etc. As a commentary on the 1960's it's a work of genius: Romero uses his zombies as a metaphor for late-60's social violence and bigotry. It's tons of fun, do yourself a favor and watch it tonight.    Fun fact: there was never a copyright on the film, due to a mix-up involving a changed title that didn't get the little trademark logo. Technically, the film has been public domain since it was released, meaning Romero never got any money for it, and it's freely available on Youtube."
bestofnetflix,2z9vgi,TheGoshDarnedBatman,3,Mon Mar 16 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"I use Night of the Living Dead as an explanation on why things need to come into public domain faster.   If this was copyrighted, Romero would have the ability to stop the filming of pretty much any zombie film since then, but because it started in public domain, zombie films have become some of the horror genres most popular films.  While it sucks that Romero never made a cent of the movies official release (at least that's what he claims,) the exposure helped his career, and set him up with gigs for life.  Point of all of this, when films, characters, and stories enter public domain, society benefits."

Most of the scenes start with really well made miniature sets, that have moving parts, and they're not afraid to blow them up. This helps create a narrative that can take place anywhere because they just build it.   The acting is fun too. They probably won't be nominated for an Emmy, but I don't think they give those to Aussie shows anyway, so no loss there.  The second season is different from the first which is good because the show has a lot running gags and having everyone in different situations keeps it fun. Seeing how the only other comedy I know from the country/continent is Wilfred, which is also a fun non-family sitcom, I love the quirkiness of this show. And everybody is good looking."
bestofnetflix,2ysnyu,Laterface,3,Fri Mar 13 02:56:38 2015 UTC,"I couldn't get through season 2, I hated how they changed the look/feel of the show :-("
bestofnetflix,2ysnyu,scuba7183,2,Sat Mar 21 17:25:56 2015 UTC,"To each their own. The first season was really good; they could have milked that for a while longer, no doubt. But I really like tv that tries to do something different. Especially sitcoms, since most here in the states are focused squarely on the family dynamic. It's why I like some of the animated stuff out there so much; like Archer, Veture brothers, and Metalocalypse.   Danger 5 figured out how to do crazy story lines on a small budget because they don't have to film at location and can still tell the story they want tell. I hope someone picks up the torch and makes it, or something similar, for Netflix."
bestofnetflix,2ysnyu,Laterface,1 point,Sat Mar 21 20:03:56 2015 UTC,They are satires on different decades. The second season is making fun of 80s films so its supposed to be entirely different. If you go into the show with the idea in mind that most things are a satire of the films from the decade its making fun of it makes it much more enjoyable. I always enjoyed super cheesy 80s action movies so I loved the second season.
bestofnetflix,2ysnyu,Ordinary_Fella,8,Sun Apr 5 00:07:35 2015 UTC,"I watched the complete Season 1 and I can't actually say if I liked it.  It was absurdist and at times truly funny, but I never really connected to it like I did with something like Archer.    I started watching Season 2 and it's even more difficult.  The 80's spoofing seems like a funny premise but it feels less fun and funny than Season 1."
bestofnetflix,2ysnyu,EugeneHarlot,8,Thu Mar 12 14:50:45 2015 UTC,"The thunderbirds feel of season one added to the show making it an interesting watch for me. I didn't need constant comedy because I liked the feel of the show.  But season two didn't have that quality, the eighties just aren't as visually...appealing? Iconic? I am not sure but it just falls flat for me."

bestofnetflix,2ymosq,Netprincess,0,Wed Mar 11 22:45:28 2015 UTC,"who said that?  the story was made for film.      Tykwer's not a bad director, but he could have done more with the source material, even on a smaller budget.  admittedly i have no idea how many days he had to shoot what he did, but he agreed to cast De Niro (perhaps, in his defense, for visibility at a studio's insistence), and agreed again to give him WAY more screentime than the part deserved, likely at the expense of the segment i lamented not getting to see.    that book's narrative afforded an opportunity to explore uncharted territory in filmic semiology.  and if i'm being entirely candid, i'd say whiffing that kind of lob relegated Tykwer to Arronofsky/Fincher-type legacy-- he's a competent executor with an unremarkable voice.    though it's not entirely fair to invoke luminaries in critiques like this, humor me for a sec and imagine what, say, Kubrick would have done with the same story."

She rises to every challenge with strength an determination while maintaining an unassailable optimism. She is, truly, unbreakable.  Do not mistake this as just a 30 Rock/Parks and Rec/The Office clone. Yes, if you like those shows, you will probably like this. too; but being a big fan myself, I think that this might be the best of them all.   Yes, it shares characteristics from the whole old NBC lineup, but it isn't just like any one of them. I've heard several jokes repeated word-for-word from 30 Rock episodes, it has Jane Krakowski as a character that's basically a more relatable Jenna Maroney and the guy who played D'Fwan. Ellie Kemper basically plays her same role from The Office. And the appeal of the show is a cast that makes you root for every single character like Parks and Rec.

From the perspective of supporting Dan Harmon the artist, I have never watched Season 4, and will not. But after seeing this documentary, I can sort of see why Sony fired him. As Donald Glover rather coolly says, ""It's a business.""  Also the documentary showed in plain terms that Harmon has a fairly substantial alcohol problem. I know that lots of people cheer it on, but watching him pour a red plastic cup full of vodka on the rocks as a nightcap seemed a little shocking."

My favorite part of his last special was the olive garden proposal so I hope he does a pure crowd work tour at some point because he seems to light up doing it in a way that's completely different from his prepared bits.  One thing I think really failed was the crowd participation. Either the audio mixing was completely off or the crowd was really lackluster because it felt like a really half hearted smattering whenever he asked the crowd to clap. When he performed the same bits in a 100 person club, the bits killed because you could hear everyone. During this show, it just seemed awkward and uncomfortable."

He said he didn't really hate Americans but instead our politics. Really, if you look at the US from a foreign perspective, all they see is what makes the news for the most part.

Battle Royale was insanely popular.  Among many people who don't watch foreign films this was the only foreign film they had seen.  This is why there was a controversy to begin with....Hunger Games came out and was immediately noticed as appearing to be a BR knock off by the millions and millions of BR fans that already existed.  It seems that you're applying the high school mentality  that only new things that are around today in your youth are the best and everything else that came before is esoteric.   It's the same thought process that leads kids to think LeBron James is the best basketball player ever even though he doesn't come close to touching Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul Jabbar or Wilt Chamberlain. The ""if it didn't happen within the past 5 years when I was in high school it never happened"" thought process."

They are told there can only be one survivor. They both have kids!

One of the main characters in BR is solely there for the purpose of avenging the death of his GF in the last melee and two of the last survivors have a love plot developing throughout the story.  The only ""love"" element in HG was the fake romance b/w the two D12 tributes."

bestofnetflix,2wxlif,chickenboneneck,-2,Tue Feb 24 15:47:30 2015 UTC,"Collins' work is one part Animal Farm, one part Lord of the Flies, and three parts Battle Royale, minus any literary nuance or talent.

They were just done far more skillfully."

It takes all the energy of the 1st movie and turns up even higher with more creative fight scenes, a ton of different and unique settings, new characters, and a pretty good plot to wrap it all up in. It drags a little in the beginning but the second half of this movie is a marvel of choreography and just plain fun."

A straightforward sprint through a ton of armed drug dealers.  The Raid 2 is far more expansive, it has a slower pace but it's filled with content.  It's a triathlon to the Raid's 100 meter sprint.  It's really good but I'd almost recommend splitting it into 2 separate viewings unless you're trying to kill an entire evening."

I can say, however, that Israel's influence on the region is heavily positive. They brought dozens of modern practices and technologies to the region, from irrigation to defending an area in which one lived. (With many of the Palestinian natives being Bedouins, both concepts were relatively alien.) One can argue that its influence destabilized the region, but if one examines the situation, it was already quite destabilized and Israel just represented a mutual target for the countries established in that area."

bestofnetflix,2v2axk,7573,20,Sat Feb 7 15:09:56 2015 UTC,"Regardless of Heinlein's original intentions for the book, Verhoeven made the film a scathing indictment of jingoistic militarism, but he mimicked the films he was mocking so well that a lot of people don't get the point. The heroes are supposed to be beautiful but dead behind the eyes; the uniforms are supposed to look Third Reich-ish...I think his intent was to make a sci-fi Triumph of the Will, a rah-rah propaganda film promoting a regime we know is evil. Anyone who thinks Starship Troopers sucks needs to watch it again, bearing in mind that the humans are not the good guys."
bestofnetflix,2v2axk,RipTatermen,7,Sat Feb 7 16:14:16 2015 UTC,"Verhoeven takes essentially Sci-Fi B-movie scripts and inserts an underlying theme/subplot into it. So on the surface the movie seems pretty dumb, but there is a whole lot more going on there if you care to look. Robocop is a pretty terrible movie as just Sci-Fi action, but when you start getting into the themes of what makes someone human/the ghost in the machine and the dangers of corporate power, it turns into a surprisingly intelligent movie. The same thing happens in Starship Troopers with the ultra-nationalism/fascism and propaganda themes that underlie the plot of shooting a bunch of CGI giant insects.  Both movies are a satire in the sense of taking an otherwise largely stupid plot/concept that Verhoeven seems to be mocking, but inserting a serious message into it."

After playing around on Google for a few minutes, I think I figured out what I was remembering wrong (and, there for, trying to get at):  I remember reading somewhere that Starship Troopers was created because the directors of The Matrix wanted to thoroughly test the CGI that they were going to use in the Matrix.  I could not find anything saying that this was the case, so I'm not sure where I got it from, but I remember it from way back in the day.   I does seem that people think ST CGI stands up better with time than the Matrix does. This might be because they used the same CGI and Matrix came out two years later, causing Matrix to look like it was using old tech, (which indicate that I might be remembering right), or they just went with a totally different company.

Perhaps the poster above you is from the UK where they refer to a season as a series.  Where we in the U.S. say Seinfeld season 1, season 2, season 3, etc. they say Seinfeld series 1, series 2, series 3 etc.   As stated by others, the 2nd season was made while Andy was receiving treatment for his cancer.  They did a prequel to hold fans over until Andy was healthy enough to resume his role as Spartacus in season 3.  As it turned out, that never happened.  He died from his lymphoma and they had to carry on with another actor playing Spartacus for seasons 3 and 4."

bestofnetflix,2uja1t,I_Can_Haz_Brainz,-2,Mon Feb 2 21:18:53 2015 UTC,Conan kind off comes of as a dick in this movie. NBC did pay him 40 million after the whole debockle. And non of it would have happened in the first place if he did a better job with the Tonight Show in the first place. His ratings were terrible. What was NBC supposed to do?
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,TPUBGU,10,Mon Feb 2 22:21:54 2015 UTC,"That being said, the doc is worth a watch imho for that reason. It seems pretty honest."
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,littleguyalex,-2,Tue Feb 3 01:02:43 2015 UTC,True. It was a good doc. Very honest. Was probably more entertaining then Conan's stage shows were (which looked like they were mainly just him playing guitar).
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,TPUBGU,7,Tue Feb 3 01:10:03 2015 UTC,NBC should have stuck to their agreement and let Leno leave when he was supposed to.
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,CharlesChaplined,2,Tue Feb 3 01:17:33 2015 UTC,"Have you actually seen the documentary?  He doesn't come off as a dick to NBC, he just comes off to a dick in general.  To his staff, to his friends, to his fans... he's just a heel all around.  Not to mention, a huge egomaniac."
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,theultrayik,-2,Tue Feb 3 19:57:19 2015 UTC,NBC is in the business of making money. Ratings = Money. Leno had the best ratings in late night and Conan did not.
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,TPUBGU,7,Tue Feb 3 04:04:34 2015 UTC,"Leno never left though, he kept hosting a show at an earlier time slot that he wasn't supposed to. People were confused and continued to watch Leno. Conan got like 4 months at most before they were trying to give his time slot back to Leno, they didn't give him a chance."
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,mr_walnut,-6,Tue Feb 3 04:11:39 2015 UTC,"""wasn't supposed to"" you make it  seem like Leno just decided on his own to go on the air at 10 with another show and put it on the air against NBC's will. That was their decision based on how horrible Conan was doing with the Tonight Show."
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,TPUBGU,4,Tue Feb 3 04:13:27 2015 UTC,"they didn't put him on because of the ratings, and in fact the new Leno show quickly made the ratings for everyone awful (the leno show, the local news, and the tonight show)  It was a bad for the tonight show for Leno to stay at NBC on the new show.  Execs kept him around because they were afraid to lose him and they also had no patience for losing the old people demographic which is the main audience Conan lost.  But in the end they ended up losing old people and alienating the youth."
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,mr_walnut,-6,Tue Feb 3 05:40:47 2015 UTC,"The simple fact is if Conan could get viewers none of this would have happened to him. He had a fair shot at the Tonight Show and he blew it. Letterman kicked his ass hard (something that never happened since the early 90s).   and for everyone who thinks that Jay is so evil for what he did to Conan, why don't you think Conan is so evil for what he did to George Lopez at TBS?? Conan came in, took his timeslot, and eventually TBS realized they could not afford both shows so they canned Lopez.   Fuck that ginger fuck."
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,TPUBGU,3,Tue Feb 3 08:37:30 2015 UTC,Does Fallon get ratings? Can't imagine he could be anywhere close to what Conan had in his original time slot. To me it all just seems to show how mismanaged the network is. There is a reason some of their new shows lose out on ratings to even just reruns of some other networks.
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,redpandaeater,-7,Tue Feb 3 06:03:23 2015 UTC,Yes he does much better than Conan ever did with The Tonight Show. From the start.   It's not anymore complicated than the ratings. That's what drove every single decision that happened.
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,TPUBGU,2,Tue Feb 3 08:26:33 2015 UTC,"Totally felt the same way. Not as much of a dick as an egomaniac. But maybe his ego was just so hurt after his failure with his new spot that he was in a weird place. Either way, I was having a hard time figuring if it was a shtick or he was for real, and it made me like him less."
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,ShockingConclusion,2,Thu Feb 5 03:28:31 2015 UTC,"Agree. I love Conan and started watching him in the mid nineties.  Still like him but this documentary was the one that knocked him down a few pegs.  I understand that he just got dicked over by NBC but it was his almost elitist like attitude that threw me off, I mean he did go to Harvard.  I see the same 'tude in Colin Jost who appears to be the new Conan in training.  When he was backstage acting like all these people that wanted to see him were too much or beneath him, really showed a side to him I didn't realize he had.    He is still hilarious but has a bit more ego to his edge now that used to be his funny loser type syndrome on cheap late night tv.  The tonight show adventure changed him a bit.  Still liked the documentary and still like Conan but he went kinda rockstar on it and his schtick doesn't match with that as well."
bestofnetflix,2uja1t,drawkbox,4,Sat Feb 7 00:29:40 2015 UTC,We were saying the same thing when we watched it. It really spoiled my desire to watch his new show.

Mike Farrell tried to persuade Burghoff to stay on the show, citing the lackluster careers of former MAS*H regulars Larry Linville and McLean Stevenson after their departures.  Covering the conclusion of MAS*H for TV Guide in 1983, Burt Prelutsky wrote, ""Although nobody wanted to be quoted for the record, the feelings about Gary Burghoff's leaving were fairly unanimous: loved Radar, hated Burghoff. As summed up by one of the principals: 'Gary had personality problems. He always felt there was a conspiracy against him. He was rude to everyone, but if anyone ever said anything back to him, he'd throw a tantrum. He had frequent spats with his cast members, particularly with Alan Alda. Once his other cast member, Mike Farrell told him that his problem was that he could dish it out but he couldn't take it, and Gary said, ""And I'm getting real sick and tired of dishing it out."" The poor guy didn't even realize what he'd said.'""[9]"

We're one of the more popular ones, as we've lasted this long and we've actually franchised to different locations nationally. We've been on discovery, travel channel, food network, cooking channel, and have people come from as far as Canada just to try our food. Even then, its gruelling hard stressful work, and we still struggle to stay afloat. Over these past 4 years ive seen so many people, young and old alike wander in trying get their piece of the pie and get eaten alive within six months, walking away with tens of thousands of dollars in debt.  Food trucks aren't the quick easy money most people think they are, they consume your life (often ill find myself on the truck 60+ hours a week) and the payoff is very small.

I like strong female leads, but this is past the point of absurd. She said something along the lines of she had a hundred college degrees. All her male contemporaries are just the biggest dopes, and the only male who isn't a dope is the serial killer. And Stella Gibson's biggest flaw is that she cares too much for the women she's saving. But if men have House and Batman, why not? It's still worth the watch even if it has some sizeable plot holes."

It's really, really good. Like, way better than it has any right to be. It has a clear beginning, middle, and ending that ties into the beginning of the original 1960s show."

After Mirror Mask I resolved that no low budget movie can do Neil Gaiman justice. The movie is super confusing and mashed together. Like a bad anime based on a manga. They try to cram way too much in a too limited time span and its a CGI overload, which for movies in the fantasy genre is necessary, and definitely for this book, but not on the budget this movie was on. There were way too many scenes where the focus was on the subpar CGI and the movie was far from fluid. Unless you've read the book differentiating between the switch between protagonists early in the movie is hard, and characters are introduced and dropped within seconds. This movie fucking sucks, like every other Neil Gaiman adaptation. If you're a Neil Gaiman fan this movie will disappoint. If you dont know him you'll be confused and feel like you've watched some B fantasy movie. I honestly velieve Neil Gaiman can not be pulled off properly on the budgets his adaptations are offered, for his novels are far too detailed and with movies like this one it seems like they emphasize the wrong details and leave out the important ones. Super confusing, definitely no Princess Bride, the screenplay was miles from fluid."

bestofnetflix,2sdnnh,Cacklion,3,Mon Jan 19 20:43:52 2015 UTC,"I know I'm late but I want to comment on this thread because it made me watch the movie. Spoilers ahead!   This movie was kind of a let down for me. They misguided the audience by making the funeral party seem like it would be fun and taking the goofy pictures and focusing on the sharing of stories.   In the end, the big funeral party had no stories shared about him, but rather a depressing story that really wasn't that interesting. Why is he so ashamed that he couldn't save his lover from a house fire caused by her abusive husband? Why would that make a man hide for 40 years?   Anyway the movie just bored me except for the middle. The middle was fun and wild and set me up for a fun ending that never came. They could have included the fire story and still turned the funeral party into a fun experience. They literally had any road to go down because nobody knows about the old man. They could have made up anything and had people share funny stories."
bestofnetflix,2sdnnh,IAmBecomeGay,2,Mon Jan 19 21:04:57 2015 UTC,I enjoyed the movie overall but I completely agree with your assessment.  Not only was his story not really shameful like you said but the crowd didn't care at all.  They stared blankly until they announced the winners who then cheered in poor taste.  I suppose that's the most realistic scenario but it just ended up being depressing after the whole move was making it seem like the ending was going to be a grand spectacle or something.

Game of Thrones style kill off in episode 6 so be prepared. I found that after being bored for the first few episodes, it really does pick up after that.

bestofnetflix,2s3tf4,CaptainTeemers,1 point,Sun Jan 18 10:56:13 2015 UTC,"It kinda boils down to whether you enjoy the company of these characters. I really like the hippie doctor, the black lady, and especially the asshole. They are such fun characters that bring a lot of humor to the show. The other characters I don't love them, but they are not super annoying either.  Once you get sucked into liking the characters, you can forgive a lot of the low production value look.  And let's be real -- if they made this show like 5 years ago we would've thought the production value is pretty good. The main reason why this show looks cheap is because TWD looks SOOOO expensive. TWD basically has film-quality cinematography.   Whereas ZNation is obviously crappy in comparison to TWD, but not bad if looked at through normal lenses."

bestofnetflix,2row5t,oolichan,20,Thu Jan 8 00:57:30 2015 UTC,"I dont feel like being long winded here, but the article talks about the end of the watercooler talk about shows. This simply isnt the case. Ive had plenty of talks where the first thing is to establish where each other is at in the season, then reflect on what each other has seen up to that point. It's not the same as you both guessing as to what is going to happen next,  but by no means does it just end the conversation at ""im watching orange is the new black"" ""yeah,  me too"""
bestofnetflix,2row5t,deanstreat,-5,Thu Jan 8 04:34:56 2015 UTC,"I think this model that Netflix uses of publishing the entire season at once completely ruins the watercooler talk.  There is too much to worry about with spoilers and it's so hard to figure out what people are up to.  I like binge watching older shows or something I need to catch up with, like catching up with Breaking Bad in time to watch the final season week to week, but I prefer the week to week model for the regular conversations you could have.  Now you have to sit there and try to sort out where you are in the story without accidentally giving spoilers.  ""So, you watched up to episode 5?  Did Red start her new business?  Oh, no?  I mean... oh, don't worry.  It's coming soon.  Did Boo and Nicky have their contest?  Oh, ok.  good, yeah that was funny.  I can't believe Boo won!  Oh, shit!  They didn't show that yet?  Damn.  Sorry."""
bestofnetflix,2row5t,barnacledoor,10,Thu Jan 8 05:22:49 2015 UTC,It is pretty easy... Determine who is at the earliest point and let them lead the conversation.
bestofnetflix,2row5t,monkeymonger1,6,Thu Jan 8 09:16:08 2015 UTC,Yeah this and Netflix has opened also some doors in the watercooler talk.   Instead of promoting a show by it's episodes you can promote it by the season.
bestofnetflix,2row5t,bosskis,1 point,Thu Jan 8 12:26:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but if the person who is behind in the series makes a prediction to the other, the on that is ahead might already know if that prediction comes true and has to avoid giving it away.    This doesn't effect me too much personally, as I never really had a show where I would make predictions with someone else, except Dexter.  Can honestly say no one predicted that ending /shutters."
bestofnetflix,2row5t,dquizzle,3,Sat Jan 10 01:33:29 2015 UTC,"I think it brings forth a new type of water cooler conversation because it's now about what shows you have in common and turning each other on to new shows and if your tv tastes match up, it's almost like you found a new friend who gets you. And I'm okay with that. Also, my friends who are ahead of me in shows I'm currently binge watching will sit and rewatch episodes with me without spoiling anything."

bestofnetflix,2rn6fk,BackOff_ImAScientist,6,Wed Jan 7 17:03:15 2015 UTC,Very well made film and has quite a chilling conclusion.
bestofnetflix,2rn6fk,predalien33,2,Wed Jan 7 19:06:22 2015 UTC,The ending IMO was the most perfect it could have possibly been
bestofnetflix,2rn6fk,babelincoln61,1 point,Thu Jan 8 05:10:42 2015 UTC,convince me as to why it was perfect. please.
bestofnetflix,2rn6fk,iFucksuperheroes,2,Fri Jan 9 10:25:27 2015 UTC,"Spoiler tag isn't working so Spoilers... obviously.  Ok so there were two bad guys in the film. The old bad guy was Peer and the younger bad guy was Timo for reference. Over the course of the film, Timo becomes rot with guilt and worries about being caught from what they did 20 years in the past together. Throughout the film, we realize that Peer is a really fucked up child molester/pornographer. (more so than just what he and Timo did together) This renders Peer an obvious outsider who can't share his fucked up passions with anyone else. Anyone else that is, but Timo. To Peer, Timo is his only friend, the only person he can confide in, who understands him, the only person he could love in a fucked up way.   So in the end, the investigators get close to figuring out that it was Timo who was involved in the rape/murders. This drives Timo mad and Timo kills himself after trying to talk to Peer. Peer never gets caught and I can see here why people don't like that. But to me, it's better this way. Peer lost his only and closest friend. Peer has to live on knowing that it was his fault that Timo killed himself. Now he has to suffer a loss similar to all of those families he hurt. It seems to me that this is a punishment worse than simply being arrested.   It's been a while since I've seen this movie, so let me know if I missed anything or am off on some of the story points."
bestofnetflix,2rn6fk,babelincoln61,1 point,Fri Jan 9 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"thank you so much for typing this. this is what I tried to explain to my girlfriend too but she sees it the other way, she didn't like that she got away and I too can see her side as to why it's fucked up. it's just an all around controversial fucked up ending.   have you ever watched the series Black Mirror? there's an episode that this movie reminded me of and you seem like a pretty complex thinker who may enjoy the series."
bestofnetflix,2rn6fk,iFucksuperheroes,2,Fri Jan 9 18:37:51 2015 UTC,"No problem :) I know a lot of people reacted the same way your GF did. It's definitely a controversial ending and I can totally see why people feel that way, but I feel it was perfect for the tone of the film.   And yeah, I think this stuff might be a little more personal for women. If this was real life, I would rather see the fucker burn. But in the narrative, poetic justice is far worse than him simply going to jail or being put to death. Because in his mind, he would still be in the right and he wouldn't suffer by going to jail or being killed. ninja edit: That last shot was so fucking perfect. Idk why, but it just struck a chord with me.  Black Mirror is on my List on Netflix and now after this suggestion, it's risen to the top haha. Thanks! :)  As far as suggestions go... have you seen Se7en?"
bestofnetflix,2rn6fk,babelincoln61,1 point,Fri Jan 9 18:58:39 2015 UTC,"it really was perfect based on the tone the whole film set, I agree.

bestofnetflix,2rj164,antigravity21,11,Tue Jan 6 16:57:09 2015 UTC,"I put this show on recently and enjoyed it quite a bit.  I blew through all 3 seasons over a few days.  It starts off a bit weird, but then kinda turns into a police procedural, investigating present day crimes with future tech and an over-arching storyline linking most of the cases to the terrorist group's activities while Kiera tries desperately to get home to 2077.  It starts to hit its stride in the back half of season 1 and kept me really entertained.  There is a lot of social commentary in this series, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Pretty decent writing and acting.  There are some plot holes, as with any story involving time travel.  Just ignore the holes they don't fill up so you can enjoy the show  It got renewed recently for it's 4th and final season, which should air sometime in between 2015 and 2077.  I'm curious to see how it plays out, because season 3 ended in such a... steep cliffhanger."
bestofnetflix,2rj164,fitzjack,4,Tue Jan 6 17:05:21 2015 UTC,Give it a fair shot and it will turn out to be a pretty entertaining show.  It took a few episodes before I started to like it.

She's from the year 2077 so (of course) she has all kinds of cool tech like a body suit that she can use to make her invisible even her face which is not covered but that's ok because if everything was invisible except her face then all you'd see is a face floating around and that would be really stupid.  But it's not stupid because she's really beautiful and she kicks ass and she yearns oh she yearns.  And she can tell if you're lying.

There's something to be said for having a grey morality to the show... but it feels more like they just kept coming up with ""cool ideas"" than an intentional eschewing of traditional morality roles.  I also agree with some criticism about how Keira seems to change her goals and acceptance of things rather suddenly and without any real explanation in season 3.

The show was cancelled after one season because of low ratings, which were based on a few issues: first, the network didn't do much to promote. second, when the network DID promote, it was commercials based on the the stupid terrier mascot and title, which had literally nothing to do with the show.  Again, the show has almost nothing to do with dogs. The title was poorly chosen and really screwed the show's potential for ratings. Whoever chose the title was trying to call to mind the image of scrappy, tenacious, likable underdogs, which is how you could easily describe the two protagonists.  The worst part about this show's fate is that four years later, they still haven't released the series to Blu-Ray or DVD. I would buy it in an instant, because this is one of my favorite shows ever."

The story was poorly written, situations were contrived to get to the next pretty shots of landscape, characters constantly made dumb decisions just to move the plot along, it constantly switches tones, it thinks it's funnier then it actually is, Ben Stiller's strange fantasy scenes are obnoxious & feel like they were only put in to have action scenes early in the film and the opening scene is a fucking eharmony commercial."

It could have been a mini series or something with 3 hour long episodes.  I got bored halfway through and started paying attention last 2.5 episodes.  There were just a a lot of weird sub-plots in there that seemed pointless, put in for filler.  Either way, not sure how I feel about season 2 if they do a similar thing."
bestofnetflix,2rhr9h,Thelonous,2,Sat Jan 10 16:30:25 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, I accidentally skipped the fourth episode.  The third episode ended on a cliffhanger where they discover footage of the father at the scene of the crime, and thought to myself ""I bet it's only an affair"" and the fifth episode basically begins with a ""Well, now that that's over!"" confirming exactly that and moving onward with the investigation.  Truth be told, I was pretty disappointed with the mystery. It fell into the easy trap of taking a simple mystery and surrounding it with a whole slew of convenient red herrings instead of having a rich mystery that got deeper and deeper the more it was explored.  And boy was that mystery simple, bordering on outright contrived.  I mean, it was terribly disappointing that the show took this bold stance of saying paedophile-fearing ""your neighbor could be a monster"" suburban hysteria is misguided and harmful with David Bradley's character arc, only to turn around and quite contrivedly make the killer a secret paedophile murderer anyway."

bestofnetflix,2rg80i,johnsaysthings,2,Mon Jan 5 22:57:50 2015 UTC,"Both The Trip and The Trip to Italy are trimmed down versions of six 29 minute TV episodes. So to Italy's run time has already had about 70 minutes trimmed out.  It's surprising you were surprised at how well it was shot considering how good the original The Trip looked and it's director; well known, well respected, award winning and regularly nominated Michael Winterbottom who has no shortage of beautifully shot films.  While The Trip and The Trip to Italy are fairly light on plot it does really drive at the personal lives and ambitions of fairly famous but aging actor/comedians. The majority of the scenes are simply them interacting in a very loosely scripted way in beautiful locations.  The emotional core of the movie/episodes is showing a rather unsettling side to this life. It's especially unsettling if you're a fan of the actors as they are portraying versions of themselves. You really feel tense as they do something that you feel won't end well for them because you're emotionally linking it to the real version of them, not the fake version on screen.  I imagine both guys would have to feel fairly secure in their personal lives to make this sort of thing. If there was tension in certain relationships just watching these films/episodes could tip things over, even if there's no actual correlation to their real lives.  For the most part it's entertaining charm. But it does have that unsettling theme. Well worth the watch. Pity they didn't put the full 6 eps up."

bestofnetflix,2r9kwe,FuckBigots4,3,Tue Jan 6 11:39:19 2015 UTC,"Okay so sure, it's become the ""College Freshmen"" movie of the last 15 years.  But I doubt many are fully understanding the point of the film.  Let me summarize the genius of this film, and Hunter Thompson with one magnificent quote:   “Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. Five years later? Six? It seems like a lifetime, or at least a Main Era—the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of. Maybe it meant something. Maybe not, in the long run . . . but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world. Whatever it meant. . . .  ""History is hard to know, because of all the hired bullshit, but even without being sure of “history” it seems entirely reasonable to think that every now and then the energy of a whole generation comes to a head in a long fine flash, for reasons that nobody really understands at the time—and which never explain, in retrospect, what actually happened.""  ""My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights—or very early mornings—when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .""  ""There was madness in any direction, at any hour. If not across the Bay, then up the Golden Gate or down 101 to Los Altos or La Honda. . . . You could strike sparks anywhere. There was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right, that we were winning. . . .""  ""And that, I think, was the handle—that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of Old and Evil. Not in any mean or military sense; we didn’t need that. Our energy would simply prevail. There was no point in fighting—on our side or theirs. We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave. . . .""  ""So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look West, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high-water mark—that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.”   The people who champion this movie because of the drugs, alcohol and reckless behavior don't understand the main point of this movie.  Sure those parts are fun, but it's about the loss of opportunity, about the passing of time, and reflecting if any of it really mattered."

bestofnetflix,2r5pvb,Scudstock,3,Sat Jan 3 06:57:07 2015 UTC,"It was definitely a twist, but I just don't see the point.  [SPOILERS AHEAD]  Okay, so she was kept in a park and basically made to participate in a nightmarish scenario based upon how she killed (help kill?) the little girl. So why wipe her memory every day? Wiping someone's memory essentially creates a new person, and the point of punishment is to say, ""You did something horrible and now you're suffering for it,"" so all they're doing is punishing someone who is, in a way, innocent. The lesson is lost on her."
bestofnetflix,2r5pvb,TheDemonClown,21,Sat Jan 3 07:04:48 2015 UTC,"Spoilers ahead for White Bear  The way I saw it is it's not really supposed to be a 'just' punishment. She participated in and stood by as an onlooker during an innocent little girls brutal death. So her punishment was to make her 'innocent' (by wiping her memory for the most part) and be mentally tortured while everyone watched. It was to simulate, to some degree, what the little girl had gone through.  The way I see it that the point of it isn't that this punishment is fair or right by any means, but it's meant to make you examine who exactly the onlookers were. So many people giggling and taking photos while a confused woman screams for her life and even at one point screams ""I am a human being! Help me!"" while they giggle to themselves and take pleasure in her torture (presumably) as much as she did in the past.  I see it as more of a look of our societies sense of justice. We were meant to feel for her and root for her. She was innocent in both our eyes and hers and when it's revealed who she really is it seems cruel and almost unnecessary. As you said, she is essentially innocent. there is no lesson for her. But there isn't supposed to be. It's about the joy we get watching people 'get what's coming to them'.  Anyways, that's just my take on the episode. One of my favorites (as you could probably tell hahaha) but I can see where I lot of people don't care for it as much as others. Sorry for rambling, haha."

Also, I think it was more of a commentary on how bloodthirsty the general public is for justice, as a whole.  They want her to suffer, but make some sort of amusement out of it...filming her, laughing with their kids, and buying tomatoes for $2.00 at the end to throw at her car.

Someone given the death penalty isn't exactly learning a lesson either. But at the same time she had those flashbacks, little snippets of memories from previous days so its possible that the wipe wasn't 100% effective but she clearly didn't remember the core concept. I think it was more of a twist on the justice system and media coverage, they turned it into more than just social discussion, it was practically an amusement park.   Idk, I usually don't read too deeply into possible ideas or messages but this show is definitely different and I like the combination of technology, society and the little twists that make you think.

Think about it.  Wilson was his best friend for four years. Now, there is still a part of Chuck that knows and understands that Wilson is just an inanimate object, but there is a much bigger and  emotionally attached part that views Wilson as an essential companion. I don't think Chuck would have been able to easily give up the very important friend he had in Wilson at the first sign of civilization. He probably would have lashed out at anyone attempting to take the ball away from him.   They would have surely deemed him mentally unstable, and thus not fit to re-enter society.   Chuck would have lived out his days in a padded room with Wilson by his side."

I did enjoy the series, it has really nice shots, and a blind man doing Kung fu - what could go wrong? :). It's not AMAZING but certainly worth a watch IMHO!"

bestofnetflix,2r2dt7,vdowd,6,Fri Jan 2 16:58:44 2015 UTC,"Slight Spoiler While the existence of Marco Polo is questioned, I did some research on other characters and events of the show and found them to actually be quite accurate.  Marco Polo is still taught as a historical person in most schools and if you believe in his journey and existence, the show actually really lines up.  And if you don't believe, the other events and major players are historically accurate.  As a history teacher I was pretty impressed by the actual accuracy of the show.  The only major thing that I noticed was that the siege machine was actually used by Genghis Khan, Kublai Khan's grandfather, as he saw the effectiveness of the machine through his conquests in the West.  Therefore Kublai Khan would have been well acquainted with this technology.  A small difference in the grand scheme of the story. I don't think mentioning this will spoil the show for anyone.  I have been reccommending this show to everyone that I know.  Great story, great character development and as it turned out, pretty educational."

However, there are so many different versions of the book that it is hard to see fact from fiction.  Some versions of the book were even added onto long after his supposed death.  There is actually a documentary on Netflix about this."

The amazingly gifted white dude in mysterious Asia?  The Asia girl squeeze? Really, couldn't they have done something more original?  I really thought they would have had the chance here to do something amazing by showing parts of real Mongolian culture and by exposing more actual history. Even if it was made fantastical, it would be impressive.  I had high hopes, but I felt as if I had already watched it before I could get very far."

bestofnetflix,2r2dt7,htallen,9,Fri Jan 2 06:09:46 2015 UTC,"Keep watching, in about the 6th or 7th episode it starts flipping all of these tropes on their head and it turns out that her acting isn't flat because she's no good but by design.  It feels a lot like Agents of SHIELDs first season did.  The first half is okay but everything feels kind of flat and cardboard cutoutish but about mid first season things start to unravel themselves and feel exciting.  Even the blind swordsman becomes unique in his own way."

The only reason I don't give FOX the same benefit of the doubt is, in my experience, the network meddles too much with shows and cater to the lowest common denominator rather than let the show run its course."
bestofnetflix,2r2dt7,down_vote_city__,1 point,Fri Jan 2 15:32:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, the plot devices were a bit generic in their conception, but in their execution it's as well done as anything else. And that generic nature evolves into a plot line of itself that does have some compelling nature to it ie: If you watched it and know how the swordsman was blinded, that obviously adds a bit of depth to the whole thing. Though I generally do agree, he could have just not been blind... and be a fantastic character. It is a little bit odd because if you needed to rewrite the script where he is not blind, you would probably only have to change a paragraph. The choreography wouldn't even change. Because the whole cliche is that the blind kung fu master fights as well / better than any kung fu master with sight and the choreography wouldn't need to change and he would still be a badass."

My break down is like this:   Kung-Fu scenes are spectacularly choreographed and shot.  A+ Larger scale battle scenes can leave something to be desired. B Seriously, how can we get like 5+ solid minutes of gushing blood with ""blond""-guy de-arming in Ep.7 and then right when the first battle of Xiangyiang battle starts it cuts to Marco narrating it out? It almost feels like they ran out of budget.  The character quality are very polarized.  I love Khan and Sidao-- their acting helps makes up for the copious amounts of poor script/dialog.  I feel like Blue Princess is like the worst character & plot arc in the show. Jingim has great development. Treasurer is a notch or two above Kokachin quality and believability. B The overall plot arc is entertaining, but I feel the scene-to-scene flow of the show feels poorly prioritized and the dialog can be really bad sometimes. B- Love the historical references & time-period/cultural inside.  I wish they spent more time on this.

bestofnetflix,2r2dt7,fredcash,4,Tue Jan 20 04:35:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Critics have high standards, and some of them won't like stuff that I enjoy. But any critic that claims to be objective is a complete and total moron, or so deluded and arrogant that they arn't worth listening to. Most good critics will say ""Look I know there are things I enjoy that other people won't necessarily enjoy, I'm going to describe and explain my experience and tell you how and why I felt the way I did about a movie / T.V. Show.""  That's really all they can do. They aren't ""Wrong"" about things unless they are actually lying about their experience / opinions.  If I say ""I didn't enjoy avatar"" And someone else says ""Oh well I loved that movie."" That's fine, neither of us is wrong. I'm not going to say ""You are wrong."" To someone who enjoys something I didn't like. Critics just happen to be people who are typically very articulate and experienced and have a lot of experience in whatever field that they are reviewing things in."

A couple of years later he got a chance to do the TV show for the WB. (You kids remember the WB? I'm so old.)  After the series ended with Season 7, the comic book started with ""Season 8.""

I'd recommend Brotherhood."

The first third or so of the story is the same in both series, but they start diverging after that, and eventually the endings are completely and totally different. Brotherhood is generally considered to be superior, but if you love Brotherhood and don't mind re-watching the first part of the storyline, you could definitely go back and watch FMA for a different take on the premise."

If you're expecting a show with child like themes of good and evil, you'll be surprised.  This is a show with complex themes of corruption and power, as well as fully formed villains.  To top it off, it may well literally have the most epic ending you'll see.  Like, 10 episodes straight of jaw dropping scene after scene.  Stick through to the end, that's where this one seriously pays off."
bestofnetflix,2qol9j,radford_6920,3,Tue Dec 30 04:37:45 2014 UTC,"It's contains all of the best elements of great anime, a huge cast of fun and original characters, an expansive and epic plot based around a well developed concept, great humor and tragedy, and a wee bit of fanservice to boot.

I mean sure, every comedian has his niche, but Bill's feels like it's growing more narrow with every special.   It's not a bad special though. Just more of the same."
bestofnetflix,2q5rci,elroy_,6,Tue Dec 23 16:16:39 2014 UTC,He did say that he mentioned it in all his specials.  I'm assuming he's just sticking with it.  And that was just a few minutes out of well over an hour of material.

bestofnetflix,2q4b8v,masterofdisaster595,2,Thu Dec 25 21:44:30 2014 UTC,"The show reminds me a lot of Alias and Dollhouse. However, IMO the plot progression is much better than the other two. It moves quickly (in a good way) so that you never really know how the story is going to end. Maggie Q is a great actress and really delivers. The show also has a satisfying ending, which can be pretty hard to come by.  Synopsis: ""When she was a deeply troubled teenager, Nikita was rescued from death row by a secret U.S. agency known only as Division, who faked her execution and told her she was being given a second chance to start a new life and serve her country. What they didn't tell her was that she was being trained as a spy and assassin. Throughout her grueling training at Division, Nikita never lost her humanity, even falling in love with a civilian. When her fiancé was murdered, Nikita realized she had been betrayed and her dreams shattered by the only people she thought she could trust, so she did what no one else before her had been able to do: she escaped. Now, after three years in hiding, Nikita is seeking retribution and making it clear to her former bosses that she will stop at nothing to expose and destroy their covert operation."""

bestofnetflix,2pxxrc,GoldenGopher1,10,Sun Dec 21 04:10:45 2014 UTC,"Definitely, I would say Korengal is less focused on the emotions of the soldiers and more on their actions. I think it gives you a little more detail on day to day operations. Both great films."
bestofnetflix,2pxxrc,GoldenGopher1,5,Sun Dec 21 16:50:34 2014 UTC,I think you're spot on. Complimentary films. I think Korengal focuses on how the emotions evident in Restrepo need to be suppressed in order to function.
bestofnetflix,2pxxrc,zestysteve,14,Sun Dec 21 16:54:09 2014 UTC,Watched this twice. Not afraid to admit tears both times. Some of the most surreal moments I've ever seen in raw human emotions.

I also got a chuckle from the fact that murder follows this dude wherever he goes.   -Invited as a guest to an secluded English manor? Murder.   -relaxing vacation on a private yacht to Egypt? Murder.   -Woke from sleep for a late night snack? You guessed it... Murder (I don't think that one happened).   I realize that's the point of a murder mystery. But seriously, If you were ever burdened to meet this guy or even be in the same damn city, turn and run.   Edit: words"

At least they can make fun of themselves. :) Also I like Poirot a lot but I think the director or writer or something changed for the ones post-2010 and I don't like those as much."

bestofnetflix,2pnoc2,berglando,2,Thu Dec 18 21:25:39 2014 UTC,I seem to recall him being pissed off a lot at the travel channel producers so I guess CNN probably doesn't try to censor him so much.

Some great jokes but a lot of absolutely terrible ones too. I haven't watched the extended version yet but I doubt it makes it any less tedious.

bestofnetflix,2pbwyh,tynamite,5,Mon Dec 15 18:06:14 2014 UTC,"Is the original any better? I watched the extended, and it was pretty grueling to watch. Even when there was a good joke, it was beaten to death."

As you are wandering through the library, if you see something you might enjoy, you can add it to your queue so you can easily find it later(like a bookmark in your web browser). Relating it to a bookmark in your browser is the best way to explain it.   In speaking of the DVD service, you can add titles to your queue(i have around 300 right now in my DVD queue) and each title is numbered 1-whatever. The number is simply showing you what disc will be shipping next. You can update your queue arrangement at any time.  I personally use the Netflix BluRay service and it's one of the largest draws for me. Netflix streaming just doesn't match the quality or selection of the BluRay titles they offer."

Most of the scenes were offset, so you really got to see how much money they put into it. I think the next season is going to be way better since the introduction to the characters was really interesting. It reminds me of game of thrones, without the huge plot twists at the end of the season... which kinda sucks."

The dialogue is really well written and honestly my favorite part of the show.  So pull the trigger, power through a few episodes and enjoy the rest."

Basically, it's a lot of visual pornography: kung-fu flick martial arts, forced nudity, and clumsy character interaction. That said, it's an awesome television show to play in the background while doing rote work. The plot isn't so intricate that not looking up every now and again will jeopardize the whole of the series. But it's really just visual cheesecake: thick, rich and cloying.

It has developed a cult following for good reason, and an english dub is available on Netflix. (Personally I prefer the french voices.) Currently unavailable on Netflix are a few 45 minute long animated Specials, but are definitely worth watching after watching the series.   Besides being a pleasure to look at, the show is full of fun characters, great character design, humor, and it has its fair share of dark moments. Personally I feel that it rivals Avatar in its quality, and beats most animated shows visually. If you like cartoons, Wakfu is a must see."

bestofnetflix,2orkmt,Colorado222,3,Wed Dec 10 05:36:41 2014 UTC,This shit was enjoyable. There's a convention where mall Santas from all over the world meet up to talk about milk and cookies and other Christmas stuff. It follows around like 4 or 5 Santas as they prepare for Christmas. The gay Santa reuniting with his long distance lover will put tears in your eyes.

I dont think the ""concert film"" approach works for these guys.  Id much rather watch Krauss or Dawkins go at length in one of their many videos on youtube.  There are so many good debates out there with these guys and it much better captures there comments in context.    again, there is nothing wrong with being a little cocky, this film is obviously for atheists.  they are just absolutely brilliant men and they have a lot of content, on many different subjects, but this doc glosses over it all.  watch a youtube debate with Krauss and William Lane Craig, or any muslim apologist. hes always entertaining."

bestofnetflix,2o1nk1,OriginalCarbon,4,Thu Dec 4 02:46:22 2014 UTC,Just finished watching both seasons on Netflix. Scary brilliant. This series is a glimpse into a potential dark future. This level of intricate design in user-ability tech is plausible.  Never have I seen a series metaphorically present such visions in a clever way. I became a fan instantly. The show is purely authentic. Each episode is its own movie. Cerebral at its very core yet appropriately humorous at times. It questions the status quo of society through our own human vulnerabilities.   The darkest concept of the show is such technological feats are plausible in the years ahead. Such concepts of social media are already in place. The evolution of technology is a burden for pleasure and pain. Are we destined to be cyborgs? We may already be.  Black Mirror poetically opens Pandora's Box of a modern future. Recommended for all who dare question the world and themselves.

I feel like once you introduce something like flying or something crazy I can accept that, it's a part of a different fictional universe. I have a hard time accepting hard to believe things when the show portrayed itself as being in pretty much the universe as us (except with different names). It also why I stopped watching bones and csi. Tried to pretend to be in the same universe, and they got stupid with it. Ended up watching episode two, and that was much more enjoyable to me for the reasons stated above."

I think 'Come Fly With Me' and 'Little Britain' and 'Little Britain USA' are some of the funniest things on TV. I also think 'Snuff Box' is hilarious too. It also gets an 8/10 rating on IMDB and I would trust their ratings over most. 'Come Fly With Me' gets a 7.5/10. 'Little Britain gets 7.7 out of 10, Little Britain USA gets 7.7/10.   I think it's safe to say as far as numbers go all of these series are rated pretty highly and for good reason. Hopefully the Netflix community on reddit will give them another chance."
bestofnetflix,2nyd9u,NotYoursTruly,3,Tue Dec 2 03:46:05 2014 UTC,At the time of it being on the Beeb it was a classic comedy series. I suspect that a lot of the negative comments are from a non-British audience. Have to say Little Britain USA wasnt nearly as good

This particular film, however, is an exception. The cinematography is wonderful, however the story and acting are mostly horrendous (There were a few actors that did an amazing job, but quite a few sucked really bad). It's almost like they asked a class of 1st graders to write a story, and then took the kid who's story sounded the ""most science-fictiony"" and made it into a script for a movie."

Frankly there seemed to be a lot of plot holes, but they didn't bother me as much as the ending. blowing up the train was just stupid, it doesn't solve anything and they pretty much doomed the human race. it would have been much better to stop the train in a nice area, and utilize the resources on the train to start a new society. but thats just me  still worth a watch though, 7.5/10"

He was fighting for control the entire time. Why else rise up? Did he not think it through? How was the guy giving him the power any different from him taking it. Those two people that survived are going to last a few hours at most in the cold. I expected them to at least find a small village that survived but nope. Humanity is gone now."

What?   When he saw the kids crammed into the machinery of the engine, he realized he wouldn't ever have that power. The parts of the system he hated weren't there because of malicious whims, they were necessary, they were inseparable from life on the train.   He realized that ""making the changes he wanted"" had to mean stopping the train itself, and there was only one real way to do that without it immediately being undone.    He was fighting for control the entire time.   Exactly, and he finally was confronted with the fact that his society's survival required all the terrible things he'd hated. It was when he obtained ""control"" that he realized how little it could change, how few choices he had. He effectively only had one.    Those two people that survived are going to last a few hours at most in the cold. I expected them to at least find a small village that survived but nope. Humanity is gone now.   It's implied that, as little hope is there is, there's still some small glimmer. Temperatures are at least slightly warmer than when the first group left and froze.

The point was that they had no way to ""safely"" stop the cycle, they'd face too much opposition to move humanity off the train in a more ""reasonable"" way. They decide that, no matter what they think they know, no matter how bleak the alternative, the current system is inherently intolerable and must be ended at any cost.   You're not supposed to wholeheartedly agree with them, but the fact that they felt pushed to that extent is supposed to make you think. What would it take for you to put your world's survival on the line like that?"
bestofnetflix,2nwrk1,Suradner,1 point,Mon Dec 1 16:31:43 2014 UTC,I thought that at first too but I'm beginning to think it wasn't about surviving as much as it was getting off of the train. They weren't planning on having the human race survive just being able to leave and live the rest of theirs. Sure it didn't work out exactly like that but they stopped the current system.

The avalanche at the end, how could there not have been more avalanches in 18 years of perpetual snow storms? Who kept them clear? How would they maintain the wheels/axles/whatever? The train cars themselves do not make up a proper ecosystem that humans need to survive. The train aspect killed most of the movie for me. The not bothering to explain things kills the rest. Why the fuck did they waste bullets shooting at each other while the train was spiraling? Why was the train spiraling? It's just a Sy-Fy original movie with a huge budget. There was no real plot just a weak story line of ""You're at the back and you need to get to the front."" And why would a man who ate fucking babies be upset that they were fed bug blocks? Fuck this movie."

No.  Is Schwarzenegger's performance top class? Do you seriously watch a Schwarzenegger movie expecting something other than fucking Schwarzenegger? Fuck you! You can't complain about that!  The main problem with this movie is that half of it is missing. It feels like the movie was originally 3 hours long and then it was cut down to under 2. So much goes unexplained as it jumps from one scenario to the next, especially during the first half of the movie (towards the end it get a bit better).   If you want to watch a dark and gritty (seriously dark at certain times!) crime/action/drama featuring Schwarzenegger then isn't your ordinary run-of-the-mill action movie with explosions every 10 sec then this is it."

bestofnetflix,2nmhy7,ChaosForger,1 point,Fri Nov 28 12:35:21 2014 UTC,"I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in Thompson or Bill Murray. It's a different atmosphere completely from Fear and Loathing. It's less psychedelic and more straightforward while still retaining all that makes Thompson and his writing what it is. It's worth watching if for no other reason then to compare the performances of the stars.  Peter Boyle and Benicio del Toro might as well be playing different characters,  and going in with the knowledge that Thompson pretty much hated how his friend was portrayed in Loathing (he said his attorney was always carefully dressed and though he definitely did drugs he also was known as a powerful orator who stood up for the underprivileged) adds a whole other layer.  Depp definitley hit Thompson on a bender while Murray is more an overall character analysis.  Very good movie."

Even Light's father and other members of L's team note that he seems obsessed about it.

bestofnetflix,2n6vcf,Jacques_Cormery,11,Mon Nov 24 00:53:04 2014 UTC,"As a long time fan of Agent's of Shield I want to encourage new fans to explore and enjoy this great show. The beginning of season 1 starts put slow, but it's mostly world building as the writers/producers were waiting for Cap 2 to come out  so they could really dig into the story.  Which deals heavily with the aftermath of the film. Though, the early episodes did give the actors time to really feel out the characters and make them whole.   If you can't stand the earlier eps just skip to the Seeds episode and go from there. It gets really, really good about Turn, Turn, Turn and has kept up the momentum well through season 2.   Give it a chance, it's a good show when it's finally allowed to stretch it'd legs and is a great addition to the MCU.   Join us over at /r/shield Though, keep in mind that we're into season 2, if you want to avoid Spoilers."
bestofnetflix,2n6vcf,1ilypad,8,Sun Nov 23 21:06:28 2014 UTC,"So I've been watching this, and I enjoy it.    If you can't stand the earlier eps just skip to the Seeds episode and go from there.

But that first season: IS WHY THE SHOW MADE IT TO AIR so it is usually the best. Just in my opinion. I certainly dont watch every show.  *of course shows that make it to air from huge movies with built in fan bases are different i guess. You can really only compare this to the star wars cartoons."

bestofnetflix,2mieh6,drawkbox,4,Mon Nov 17 00:12:18 2014 UTC,"If you are looking for something similar after enjoying this (which you will if you are interested in films and how they are made), you will also enjoy the series The Story of Film. It follows film through the ages from the initial invention, to its establishment as an art form, to what it is today.   The series covers major periods and people in film's history, as well as lesser known players that had a very large impact on what we all watch now. Great jumping off point if you want to know what the heck /r/truefilm is talking about."

bestofnetflix,2mieh6,zxbc,1 point,Thu Nov 20 08:10:05 2014 UTC,"The story of film is one of my favorite documentary series. Primarily because of the depths they go into, but also because almost all my favorite directors are discussed in depth. It reminds me of a Ken Burns documentary."
bestofnetflix,2mieh6,test-poster,2,Thu Nov 20 16:34:45 2014 UTC,"Well made documentary with lots of great directors takes on digital vs film.    This really shows that the digital change in production has really just began, it will be amazing to see where it goes.    Nolan is the biggest proponent of film in the movie but it also shows how access to the picture/film immediately and at a low cost has changed acting, directing, cinematography, feedback loop and what you can do when film is digitized.  Most directors can't go back to film after digital just because of the creative freedoms it brings.  With less breaks for film and cheaper cost actors also have to work harder with less breaks as there is no real cut in filming anymore."

bestofnetflix,2mfra0,KarmalitaBonita,5,Sun Nov 16 09:19:13 2014 UTC,I watched Nebraska last night and thought it was horrible. I think the acting was good but it just seemed pointless and completely mundane. The best way I can describe my impression of it is a movie about re-living a life not worth anything. The ending was predictable and unsatisfying. I gave it one star to counter the perplexing high-star rating that made me watch it.
bestofnetflix,2mfra0,love_the_dakka,2,Sun Nov 16 19:25:50 2014 UTC,"It has to be one of the more polarizing movies that have come out recently. I agree with you, the acting is great...plus I'll add that the cinematography was fantastic, and the use of black and white perfectly complimented the dreary tone.   But man...this movie is a bummer. As you watch the film, it becomes increasingly apparent how everything will end. While that in and of itself doesn't ruin the movie for me, the fact that the movie is so consistently dour makes it a real chore to watch in light of anticipating the depressing ending. Anecdotally, the movie also hits a little too close to home if you have alcoholics in your family. I love when films explore alcoholism and drug abuse in a compelling way, but ideally it would be for some greater artistic end. This movie just seemed to stagnate in it's portrayal of alcoholism for no other reason than to constantly remind you how sad of an existence these characters lead."

Since I saw it the first time I've come back to it three times now, just so much going on in the film it rewards another viewing or two.  Chris Pine did an amazing job in the film. At first I thought it was Rob Lowe, comes from watching 'Californication' where he was playing a similar role. After I looked up the info on the film afterwards I was surprised it was Chris Pine, the mannerisms are just so far off from previous roles for him. Kudos for him as an actor.  Also, not a Hasselhoff fan but the guy acted his ass off in his role, turned me around on my opinion of him. Also Ray Liotta did a great job in his role, as well as Jessica Alba.   The story, setting, other actors are all first rate. Whoever ques this up will not be disappointed, a real winner!"

bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,mhyquel,10,Thu Nov 13 21:41:33 2014 UTC,"The first three episodes were pretty lackluster, but it does get better.  I found if you look at everyone like the 20 somethings they are rather than the 15-17 year olds they are portrayed as, it gets better.  CW is pretty heavy on the HS drama aspect with all of their shows."
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,Mechanical_Owl,8,Thu Nov 13 21:47:05 2014 UTC,"I made it about 4 or 5 episodes in, but I have to still agree with /u/mhyquel.  The core concept is absurd beyond belief and I just couldn't find a single character appealing on even a basic level.  Here's the synopsis of the show's concept:   Set 97 years after a nuclear war has destroyed civilization, when a spaceship housing humanity's lone survivors sends 100 juvenile delinquents back to Earth in hopes of possibly re-populating the planet.   Really? You sent 100 juvenile delinquents to earth as humanity's saviors? Seriously?  Why?!  The show never adequately explains the logic behind this.  I suspect because there is none.  They just wanted an excuse to have a cast of attractive, young actors who appeal to their target audience.  All of which I could forgive if the show had good writing, but it doesn't.  It doesn't have even halfway decent writing.  How this even got made is completely beyond reckoning."
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,suikascans,9,Thu Nov 13 23:33:37 2014 UTC,Sounds like Australia.  Send a bunch of prisoners to a land filled with giant mutant spiders and reptiles.
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,newnamesam,12,Fri Nov 14 00:45:02 2014 UTC,"Not to change your mind, but they stated why they chose them In The very first episode.    Being that they were on the space station, the rules and laws were very strict.  If you were under 18 you were put in jail for any crime, while if you were over 18 and committed a crime, you were killed by being forced out an airlock.  They sent the 100 juveniles down because the governing body ruling the space station knew the station was going to run out of air and wanted to just see if the ground was inhabitable.  Nobody on the ""ark"" but a select few thought the earth would be habitable.   The stations government didn't expect anyone to live and hence why they sent people that had already broken their laws but the only people alive that had.  Every bit of information was kept a secret from the stations populace including  the sending of the people to earth to the fact the station was not going to be habitable in a couple months.  It is stated they did this to stop rioting or a revolt both of which are perfectly viable reaction by the workers on the station."
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,cetyal,2,Fri Nov 14 00:07:43 2014 UTC,"Wouldn't a space station that had enough fresh air for 100 years have a way of recycling the air supply?   I was on the fence until I read your reply, and now I think I'd hate this movie too.   If the premise is illogical then that can't bode well for the rest of the show."

bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,we_r_legun1993,0,Tue Dec 30 06:35:16 2014 UTC,"The reasoning behind it made sense- they didn't need them to survive, it was a suicide mission to see if by chance, the Earth was inhabitable again. They spaceship was low on air so sending down the people who don't do much anyway would save air for the rest of people, and also get a feel for the Earth's functioning.  That said, I am about 6 or so episodes in and it's getting pretty lame- definitely not the best acting though I think the main character Clark is pretty believable."

Their space station is failing and can't support life for everyone. Sending 100 people down to Earth to see if it's habitable allows the station to conserve resources. However, why they can monitor vitals but didn't bother to include actual two way communication is just bad writing."
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,wescotte,1 point,Fri Nov 14 06:52:32 2014 UTC,"They did include two way communication but it was damaged in the landing. It's stated in the first episode that the only tech and connections to the ark not broken are the wrist bands.   These people have foreshadowing, parallels to stories in the bible, history, and I think a little bit of shakespear in it. Where is the bad writing?  Not to mention the whole ""how should a society run and what should it's values be?"" theme?"
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,FuckBigots4,1 point,Sun Nov 16 02:11:25 2014 UTC,"I don't remember that happening maybe I'll wait the pilot again.   I've seen every episode and I'll continue to watch it (I have a soft spot for SciFi even if it's not great) but I feel they overload each episode with unnecessary tension/drama.   I'm struggling to recall specific examples in episodes so I'll just give some general examples...   Lot of people are seriously hurt/wounded. They make it into this huge deal about how serious the injury is but they recover from it almost instantly.  The whole idea that Clarks father was executed for his crime yet her mother is pardoned no problem doesn't fly for me. They seem to flip/flop on the zero tolerance frequency.   It seems silly that they haven't confirmed the planet was safe or there was life on it. They send their ship down and magically they run into multiple tribes out of the blue yet nobody sent probes, used telescopes, whatever,  to locate people during the entire 100 years they've been on the ark?  They whole air/resource crisis on the ark was handled horribly. There is no way in hell they lived up there that long and had it creep up on them like that. If everything is so tightly rationed and accounted for there is no way I buy they could hide an entire person's existence for seventeen years.   It just seems like they have too many characters and too many stories and all of them suffer because of it. It reminds me of LOST where they are just introducing too much drama for too many characters and the whole show feels disjointed because of it."
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,suikascans,1 point,Sun Nov 16 07:22:28 2014 UTC,"The zero tolerance policy is ""wishy washy"" specifically because people are starting to see what's wrong. Clarks mom is pardoned because jaha regrets floating clarks dad.  ""Too many stories"" is how you make something good and not just another ""BOOM! HERE COMES INVADERS! OH LOOK EXPLOSION! NOW THE BAD GUYS ARE DEAD! WHOA LOOK PEOPLE ARE HAVING SEX NOW!"" The shit that passes as good sucks specifically because it doesn't HAVE a story.   I haven't seen lost so I wouldn't know about that.   Yeah the injuries are plot devices but every show has that."
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,suikascans,3,Sun Nov 16 18:20:32 2014 UTC,"20 minutes in, acting is horrendous and why didn't they just send food with them to earth. I mean did you see how much space there was in the pod? Even if they didn't plan to miss the mountain they still could have stocked it with supplies."
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,noprotein,2,Fri Nov 14 00:42:38 2014 UTC,"First off, They didn't expect The 100 to live as they thought the earth was uninhabitable.    Secondly, this ""mission"" was kept a secret from the populace of the space station and there were only limited supplies on the ark.  Someone would have noticed the supplies went missing which is theft.  Like I said, the first episodes are bad and very teenie-boppie, but by episode five, they really get into the social dynamics of everyone alive much better."
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,eatyourdog,1 point,Fri Nov 14 01:14:21 2014 UTC,Even if they had limited supplies here's a great idea. Send 20 of them and give them a small amount of food so that way they can actually see how long they are able to survive. (considering they think it's uninhabitable)
bestofnetflix,2m7wt5,JesusLoves,3,Fri Nov 14 01:23:41 2014 UTC,"Another reason was it was a culling of the populace that was using valuable resources on the station.  This comes into play a lot in later episodes.  They knew the ark was ""dying"" and the governing body was just trying to extend the life of the others."

It seems like it is going to be a poorly done teen drama with love triangles and other high school nonsense. This is just a setup for how naive the 100 are. It gets REALLY dark after that. Think of it as a Lord of the Flies type story of where it just keeps getting worse for the poor survivors. It also is well written in that there is no black and white morality here. Everything is grey and very complicated. A lot of people will be turned off by the immaturity of the first few episodes and miss a really good show.

Haven't actually cared what network/day a tv show has aired on in years. Like others have said, the beginning wasn't so great. I just had it playing mostly in the background, but the story, characters, and acting improved and soon enough I was hooked.  Only thing that really bothers me is a lot of really drastic shifts in character personalities.  It works to a degree to keep you invested in the different stories going on, but most the time its too sudden. I get that a character might experience something that alters them, but I'd expect to see more traumatized or questioning, rather than complete flip-flopping.  For a show that's targeting the teen demographic it does a good job of having both strong female and male characters in a way that isn't screaming about it."

Like say gutting an entire wall to do spray foam insulation, when blown in cellulose would be perfectly sufficient.  I'd like to see the homeowners reaction if he billed them the full cost.    Granted I wish they would talk about costs and budget more often I have been enjoying this old house for many years.

bestofnetflix,2lvgog,dropkickninja,2,Mon Nov 10 17:38:20 2014 UTC,"I don't know.. I just didn't like Burton and Nicholson's Joker. It was like he was only adversaries with Batman because Batman was getting press and he wanted to be the one in the news.   Imo, the Joker defies conventional motives like jealousy or greed. The only motive he has is to be the Yang to Batman's Yin. Batman is methodical, the Joker is chaotic. He sees chaos as a necessary component to life, and as such he does chaotic things that really have no real purpose or meaning. It's just to promote more chaos."
bestofnetflix,2lvgog,GoT_LoL,16,Mon Nov 10 17:51:42 2014 UTC,"It seems to me that your opinion of what the Joker should be is heavily influenced by Nolan's movies. Which, while decent, are not the end all be all to the characters portrayed.  The Joker in the 89 film is more heavily influenced by the 50 years (at the time) of comics that preceded that film. The dichotomy between Batman and Joker that has been shown in comics and movies since then is a fairly modern construct that I believe has its genesis in Alan Moore's ""The Killing Joke"".  In the 89 movie, Joker didn't just want to be adversaries with Batman because of him getting press, though he was jealous of it. Joker blames Batman for the chemical plant incident and his subsequent decent into becoming the Joker, and even tells him as much during their final confrontation at the church.   Now, I'm not saying you should or shouldn't like what you want to like. I just think you're basing your opinion of the Joker on a very small slice of what that character has represented over the very long time he has been  in existence."
bestofnetflix,2lvgog,Steapenhyll,2,Mon Nov 10 18:12:07 2014 UTC,"Well said.  It would have been too much of a stretch to portray The Joker as Nolan does now, back in 1989.  The general audience wasnt ready for it.  Nicholson's Joker was actually the darkest representation of the Joker on screen (TV,Film) to that point.  I remember watching this movie when it came out, and being blown away by how dark the movie was, and how insane the Joker was.  To put it in context, the Joker in everyone's mind at the time was still largely Ceasar Romero's clown-like portrayal from the Adam West era Batman.  Burton and Nicholson flipped that on it's head."

I've been reading Batman comics since I was a kid through Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns to the one where he shot and crippled Barbara Gordon.

She then proceed to play in her room. The movie does follow the actual story of Alice, but it takes a nightmarish version of the favorite characters. For example, the White Rabbit constantly looses his stuffing, only to pull his watch out of his stomach to proclaim that ""He is very late for a date"". He refills himself by eating wood chips that immediately fall back out of him. At the Mad Hatter party, a wind-up March Hare sits during the entire scene and butters watches to make sure that the gears get oiled. The lady who was watching the baby who is actually a pig is portrayed in this film as a frog footman who battles flies with a very lifelike tongue. Even the smallest of characters are evil. There is a scene with a door mouse that crawls up Alice's head when she is sitting in a pool of her own tears, and proceeds to set up camp in her hair."

bestofnetflix,2lj8nm,AvatarIII,11,Fri Nov 7 10:07:45 2014 UTC,"I don't mean to be aggressive or mean or anything, and I can see that if you have never read the books that I suppose that movie could be enjoyable.  But the Jim Carrey film is one of the most egregious bastardizations of a film to movie adaptation that I've ever seen.  I would really urge you to read a couple of the books, they are absolutely spectacular and could not be any further from the movie.  I really think that you would change your opinion if you read a few."
bestofnetflix,2lj8nm,oilpit,3,Mon Nov 10 09:08:44 2014 UTC,"That's fine, I had never even heard of them until the movie came out, by which time I was 18 and not interested in reading books aimed at children. However I don't think I will ever change my opinion of the movie. regardless of how well it was adapted from the books the movie was fun, creepy, charming and beautifully shot, these opinions will not change just because it is a bad adaptation of the books. Books and movies are completely different media, and you have to make changes/sacrifices when adapting one to the other. It's a common complaint from people that have read the books that movie adaptations ""butchered the story"" or ""missed the point"" or are ""egregious bastardisations"" as you put it, but being a bad adaptation does not make it a bad movie. Blade Runner is an AWFUL adaptation of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, but most people consider it a masterpiece, where a perfect adaptation would be an absolute mess. so please, do not mistake your disappointment with the movie as an adaptation with objective criticism."

There are loads of movie versions of books that deviate heavily from the original and are still as good or better than the original (Fight Club comes to mind, and of course, as you mentioned, Bladerunner).  But the Series of Unfortunate Events film really can't be compared to those, it's more like His Dark Materials or War of the Worlds, in which they took a good book (or in this case, 3 good books) changed a bunch of stuff around, hired some famous actors and tried to make a quick buck while completely losing what made the original so captivating.  I'm not trying to make you stop enjoying something that you like, I just encourage you to give the books a read, the first few aren't much more than 100 pages long and they really are some of the cleverest books I've ever read."

Contains minor spoilers  So a group of friends and I all met up to try acid for our first time, except one of us who was the guy that had the hook-up.   After doing stupid shit like playing smash bros. for a couple hours, we decide to find the trippiest movie on Netflix we can find.  We landed on Enter the Void.  Holy shit, the opening credits were incredible. We had hit gold. The visuals of the first scene made me question if any of this was really happening. How did we find such a perfect movie for our first time on acid?  Well this went down hill quick. If you've seen the movie, you can see why. There were some disturbing scenes, and I leave the group to go look up cool shit on my computer. Four of my friends remained watching the movie.  After about an hour, that seemed like ages later at the time, I checked up on my buddies. The conversation that followed goes like this:  Me - You guys are watching an abortion.  Buddy #1 - I know this movie is bad, but it isn't that bad.  Buddy #2 - Whoa, Bojanger is right. This is an abortion.  Buddy #1 - What are you talking about?  Buddy #1 - OH SHIT!

Set in the neon-lit nightclub environments of Tokyo, the story follows Oscar, a young American drug dealer who gets shot by the police, but continues to watch succeeding events during an out-of-body experience. The film is shot from a first-person viewpoint, which often floats above the city streets, and occasionally features Oscar staring over his own shoulder as he recalls moments from his past. Noé labels the film as a ""psychedelic melodrama"".

bestofnetflix,2lh8tv,Cragoholica,20,Thu Nov 6 17:32:07 2014 UTC,This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. Poorly acted and it meanders and wanders for far too long that it loses any interest. The sex scenes seem to be made for shock value instead of moving the story forward.
bestofnetflix,2lh8tv,IllegalThings,7,Thu Nov 6 16:50:34 2014 UTC,"I actually liked the movie a lot, but I certainly agree with you that it dragged on for wayyy too long. It's almost like I enjoyed the first half of it, then I realized it wasn't ending halfway through, then it continued not ending for an entire other half. The acting did suck, but I went into it expecting the acting to suck.   The DMT scene at the beginning was probably one of the most onpoint film interpretations of a drug I've ever seen though."
bestofnetflix,2lh8tv,Rionoko,2,Thu Nov 6 21:37:33 2014 UTC,"interestingly, a friend of mine (a non drug user) had heard of DMT, and decided it was something she actually wanted to try, and had told me about it (at the time i did not know what it was). she had not tried drugs before, and as we were talking, looked it up online. one of the results was the DMT scene from this movie, and she played it and the conversation moved on from that point.   exactly a week later, someone had recommended watching enter the void, so i watched it, and sure enough, that scene came on, and it was trippy that i just HAPPENED to stumble across the movie right after watching the youtube clip (which had nothing related to the movie in the title, or description, it was just titled ""DMT"". it was definitely making me question my grip on reality for a couple seconds.  this is definitely a movie that will make you question whether you may have taken something before watching it.   in case you are wondering, neither she nor I have tried DMT yet, but i believe she still intends to at some point. she just wants a different delivery system, as she ""doesn't want to look like she's smoking meth"""

Oh and I ended up fast forwarding the titles, i just found that annoying.  It certainly has it's merits, it's an art film that explores the medium to tell an unusual story.

bestofnetflix,2lh8tv,SquashyO,3,Thu Nov 6 17:05:20 2014 UTC,I assumed that was deliberate too. I figured it might be to make the viewer feel as if there was a veil between them and the 'real world' so you felt more like you were watching through someone else's eyes.  Of course it could just be the result of a low budget.

bestofnetflix,2l8lja,pm_me_ur_pajamas,3,Tue Nov 4 23:19:09 2014 UTC,"I feel like my response did answer the question.  I'll try and explain better.  If you use one of those unblocking services (or a VPN) you can change the DNS of your streaming devices, gaming devices and smart TVs. Netflix will think you are in another region. Both of those sites have detailed instructions on how to setup your favorite streaming device to use it. I personally have my PS3 setup like that. It was pretty easy to setup. Took like 45 seconds. Those two sites also have free trials for like a week (I think). Try before you buy. Way better than some possible shady spyware infested chrome/firefox extension."

bestofnetflix,2kxr3s,Fsoprokon,20,Sat Nov 1 02:15:43 2014 UTC,"The Wire is as unglamorous as a series can get. It's a slow drama in a criminal/cop storyline. Looking at it from afar the show would seem pretty bad. But there are many things that make it the best series ever made.   Fantastic Acting   The acting on both sides (both cops and criminals) is so good that you forget that you are watching ""entertainment""   A realistic Universe   Where some shows (The Shield, I am looking at you) go so hard for trying to be gritty to create realism. The Wire doesn't, it's like if you put a news crew in one of these neighborhoods and record what unfolds. It feels real.   The sound   Not many people mention this about the show because it is pretty subtle, but the sound effect and ambience is amazing. If they film inside an apartment you can hear pipes creaking, if they film the projects you can hear car alarms reverberate off the walls in the distance.   Storyline   The story is very complex and has many angles, but it does not rely on cliffhangers or simple drama formulas like obvious turns.   Social Commentary   David Simon is known for his almost satirical social commentary, and boy does he pull it off in The Wire. He even manages to make baltimore city politics interesting!  Personally, I really don't like cop shows. But I am glad I gave the wire a shot, the show sucks you in after a few episodes. You just have to be ready to step into David Simons brain. The Wire is demanding, but incredibly rewarding and it's a work of art compared to pop shows."

After that (and it's necessary to watch in order to get the rest of the show), each episode is better than the previous and each season is better than the previous.

The cinematography, the pacing, the focus on the true impact on many people of one violent act, really did it for me. Just my opinion!"

I loved it."

bestofnetflix,2kt6ns,Kingdonk0,22,Thu Oct 30 20:29:55 2014 UTC,"To give the other side:  The premise is really ridiculous. I can suspend my disbelief with the best of them in order to appreciate sci-fi but this one is a tough pill to swallow.  The ""moral of the story"" is really heavy handed. There are some ""deeper"" theories of what it is about but even if you accept them it is still ham fisted moralizing.  Those two things said, the cinematography is quite nice and if you aren't driven mad by the weird storyline it is enjoyable."
bestofnetflix,2kt6ns,CupBeEmpty,4,Fri Oct 31 01:34:03 2014 UTC,"Bong Joon-ho is like that.  If you haven't, check out The Host, his other big flick.  His messages are heavy handed and cheesey a lot of the time.  Its kind of tongue in cheek humor.  That's not really what he's about though.  He very much about great artistic style.  His movies look amazing.  They are also very original.  They don't always make sense, but they're interesting as hell."

I gave it 3 stars, mainly because I enjoyed the asians. It's just so hard to suspend disbelief with this movie, and that just kind of ruined it for me. The acting wasn't bad, but the plot is just...meh."

The train, and the world it's traveling in are ridiculous. But this is a science 'fiction' movie and what happens inside the train is important to follow. This is an allegory about class structure. About a lower class kept under thumb to long, and are ready for a revolution! But .. it is just a movie, and it's not going to entertain everyone. To each their own. I personally loved it."
bestofnetflix,2kt6ns,decksauce,6,Fri Oct 31 02:14:55 2014 UTC,This movie made me so angry. In a good way
bestofnetflix,2kt6ns,Athterath,6,Fri Oct 31 01:25:38 2014 UTC,"It's an allegory. . .a very blunt, undisguised allegory.  Near the end of the movie they even explicitly state the elements and what each represents, in case you missed it (not that I can imagine how you could).  Think Pilgrim's Progress, but less literary and focussed on global inequality instead of Christian morality.  If you go in understanding that rather than suffering under the misapprehension (understandable, given the way it was advertised) that it's a science fiction action flick, you'll probably find the logical inconsistencies less irritating."
bestofnetflix,2kt6ns,Borsaid,6,Fri Oct 31 06:53:26 2014 UTC,"I couldn't get past the absurdity of a post apocalyptic world where the only survivors have to be on an always moving train. It just doesn't make any sense as a matter of survival. Sure, I appreciated the artistic value behind everything, but it was not enough to overcome the bizarre premise of survival. Between that and the story having more holes than Sonny Corleone, I just thought the movie was a waste of time."
bestofnetflix,2kt6ns,PopWhatMagnitude,1 point,Fri Oct 31 13:08:12 2014 UTC,"To me the moving train is the only part I could suspend disbelief about. In my mind he made a perpetual motion machine and it needed to be in motion to stay working which created water and heat. It's a stretch but I gave benefit of the doubt on that.   The rest of the movie was just bizarre and not in a good way IMO. It was full of plot holes and not at all a subtle allegory.  Hell, unless I just checked out it never even gave a valid reason why there needed to be a class system.   I picked this movie for my entire family to watch and they all hated it. Even worse was I kept reading about a twist ending that paid off and made it all worth it, which didn't."

I knew nothing about it aside from what I'd seen on the poster, and I wondered why something with such an odd title would be playing at The Angelika every time I walked past. In spite of the somewhat heavy-handed ""Walking Away from Omelas"" morality play, this was a phenomenal film. Thank you for the recommendation, it came on a night when I really needed a good movie."

No sun, no points of demarcation between days and moments. Time disappears. Instead of a lighted space the film is more of a complete blackness with small peaks of light scattered here and there. It's very theatrical in it's framing. Many shots are cut out and floated in blackness like a human diorama. The visual influences are also great. Many of the color work and geometry takes cues from Mondriaan's Neoplastics while the textures and atmosphere is similar to the movie Brazil. Very good film. Too close to home."

Now that I've seen this I have the utmost respect for him as a director, and I cannot wait to see what he does next.  With The Double he creates unlike anything I've seen in film for a long time.

bestofnetflix,2kexxv,SoMuchMoreEagle,0,Mon Oct 27 20:44:52 2014 UTC,"Yes it does . The only way to get rid of it completely is education at the lowest level . Child infanticide is a major problem in India but as we've moved into the 21 century, these cases have declined . By making it illegal it has deterred a lot of people who would have otherwise taken this step nonchalantly."
bestofnetflix,2kexxv,goonerfan10,3,Mon Oct 27 21:21:17 2014 UTC,"No, the only way to get rid of it completely is for girls to be as desirable to have as boys are.   Girls and women are still very marginalized in India."
bestofnetflix,2kexxv,SoMuchMoreEagle,0,Mon Oct 27 21:43:54 2014 UTC,"Educated people don't really see the difference between a girl and a boy child . For them he/she is simply a child . There can be many factors that can be attributed to female child infanticide like dowry, extreme poverty , ignorance , a general lack of education or just being messed up in the head .  Your statement is  not necessarily true . Women in India hold very high positions in the government , judiciary and civil services ."
bestofnetflix,2kexxv,goonerfan10,1 point,Mon Oct 27 22:02:03 2014 UTC,"goonerfan10, I read your comments as though you are an Indian man who has high hopes, as you should, but I am not sure that the change you speak of is happening fast enough.  India can't even bring itself to finally and fully abolish the caste system.  Marginalization, as a norm, is inherent in so much more than just gender and thus, I feel, is the cultural standard and will not go away in my lifetime.   Source: I am an Indian daughter of two doctors, my father admitted to me he had wanted sons. Dowry is still a thing.   Edit: I felt it necessary to add that my entire family, even extended, hold multiple degrees and are all traditionally doctors, lawyers, engineers, and educated in the west in Ivy League schools.  The cultural norms are much stronger than all the education in the world, largely because so many women within the system perpetuate the same beliefs.  Psychologically speaking, certainly it makes logical sense to raise sons to value women, and to raise women to value themselves, but the way many elder generations of women feel is that if they had to go through life the way they did, why should any of the younger generations escape that fate?   I would bring your attention to the breast burning tradition of Cameroon.  Instead of addressing the men and their treatment of women, mothers burn their daughters breasts to disfigure them and make them less attractive to men. In the UK, there are still cases of genital mutilation, in a country outside of the one from where the norms are born, but that doesn't stop it."
bestofnetflix,2kexxv,namesofpens,1 point,Mon Oct 27 23:53:43 2014 UTC,"There will always be a group of people who are wrongfully judged, cast aside because they are of lower caste . The only way that can be changed is less ignorant people like me and you treat them equally and may be teaching young kids the importance of equality is the way we prevent the younger generation from falling for it .  I don't see the caste system going away so soon . Look how long it took  to get rid of aristocracy in England.   For every doctor , lawyer who would rather have sons , there is a bus driver who sent all 3 of his girls to college . I'm sure your dad's gonna feel like a dick someday for having said those things . May be I oversimplified the solution to this  as education alone, I do realise that educated people can be ignorant too ."
bestofnetflix,2kexxv,goonerfan10,1 point,Tue Oct 28 11:25:47 2014 UTC,"You are correct. I apologize for coming off strongly or harsh, I am just very resentful of being raised in that kind of a cultural climate.     My dad didn't say those things to be a dick to me but out of honesty with knowing that India was no place for a headstrong girl. For that reason, and many others, it is simply easier to raise a son. I am beyond grateful that my father was honest with me and raised me to know my own strength but he knew he had to take me out of the country to give me that.   I love my country, and I'd really like to love it more and truly, as opposed to out of some sense of nationalism, but they don't love me back. They never will. That has been a bitter pill to swallow and fighting the self loathing that comes along with that is not easy."

It's nice to have a little girl to play dress up with, the issues with how she will handle the world at large don't really hit until pre-puberty.    Honestly, I'd tell you all the reasons why I feel they don't love me back but I'd be giving away very conspicuous markers of my identity. Let's just say I am a firangi. I prefer jeans over saris. I identify with the Amazonian women of greek mythology. Let's just say I'm outspoken about my opinions which differ greatly from those following cultural traditions and if I stepped foot in India and said these things out loud, I'd be killed for them, or at least made to pay with pain, punished with anguish for the rest of my time on earth.  Which, I feel, is completely devoid of any of the ""tolerance"" that Hindus lay claim to, and this opinion is indicative of the ""threat"" I bear to the culture at large.   This quote from Oscar Wilde is most indicative of how I feel."

bestofnetflix,2kfmc8,rit100,2,Mon Oct 27 03:53:16 2014 UTC,Before a dust storm the static electricity was so bad that people would keep lengths of chain in their cars.  When they saw a storm coming they'd drag the chain along behind their cars in order to conduct the static electricity to a ground source.  People couldn't even shake hands when this was going on because of the painful static electrical charge that would pass between them when they touched.  Sometimes when you reached out to touch a car the electricity would hit you up to six inches before you even touched it.

Little does he know, orcs and a witch known as Tyrant Princess are on the hunt for the last Scandinavian elf, Starfire (TM). With only the power of the NRA and a Mystical Indian named White Bandage (a blind man who drives through the power of metal bending), can our intrepid heroes save a far-away kingdom only accessible through a magical moon maze-cave between the hours of 10 AM to 10 PM?Filled with brilliant casting, Nostalgia Critic-level special effects, and a hidden, blood-play romance between Starfire and Hand-Mc-Nohand orc, you will be on the edge of your seat as you embark upon this wild ride. My only complaint was the number of unanswered questions left behind: Is TP the true moon goddess and how will the churches respond? Will White Bandage and Real Estate Lady ever accept their illegitimate son's decision to become the last dragon? Will travel costs decrease with the discovery of teleportation and how will it affect the American unemployment rate? Will Abs Strong ever find a new rocking chair to soothe his Symbolic Dreams (TM)?

bestofnetflix,2k8p2z,theotterone,2,Sat Oct 25 12:24:54 2014 UTC,"I used to work in a corporate office park with a creek running through the middle of it.   On my breaks I would walk on either side of the marsh five times a day checking out the wildlife that lived there. On one of my walks I discovered a beaver lodge and made a point of being out there and the surrounding area a little after sunrise and just before sundown.   Every now and then I would actually see the beaver that lived there going about their daily activities and eventually see the entire family on top of the lodge during some severe flooding in the winter months.   A couple of years back I counted 7-9 family members huddled on top waiting out the flood before they could get back inside. Also pretty good populations of river otter and, unfortunately, nutria. And of course raccoons, muskrat, long tailed weasels and once a coyote. Every now and then residents would even spot a red fox.   All during this time my co-workers would go on their breaks, head to the lunchroom with no windows and trade gossip about their sordid lives or what TV show was on the night before. . . They never knew what was just a hundred feet away. . .   I just watched this documentary and really enjoyed it, brought back a lot of memories of my little buddies out there.

bestofnetflix,2k55r8,SpazzyBaby,2,Wed Jan 28 16:44:20 2015 UTC,I'm about an hour into the movie and I wasn't impressed at all. It felt like a mish mash of cliche horror movie elements brought together in an organized but predictable fashion.   The acting was a bit cheesy so maybe that's why it never got me. I'm pretty easy to please its this kind of stuff but this didn't meet the hype for me.

Roughly the same era as Peaky Blinders at the beginning of the season. Like Peaky Blinders, it takes a few episodes to get into and learn who the main players are, but it draws you in hard if you're into period crime dramas. Superbly castes.

It seems like the show tries hard to find out something troubling the person has went through then urges if not forces them to talk about as often as possible.   It really creates a weird undertone throughout the show for me. With thay sad, it really can be a very fun show to watch."

They posted a video that allegedly showed one of their performers getting beat up in the subway while wearing a Jar Jar Binks costume and asked their followers for help in identifying the assailant.  For the remainder of the day, concerned comments piled up under the posting, whereas anything that revealed it to be an April Fools hoax was deleted. (Because they ""didn't want to spoil the fun"".)   When they revealed the hoax themselves on April 2nd, many of their fans called them out on how faking a violent assault and feigning distress wasn't very funny. One of the founders (I think, definitely a high-ranking member of the group) replied to those comments saying that obviously April 1st was a good time to get rid of some fans with no sense of humor. At that point I decided they were jerks who didn't deserve any more of my attention."

The book tells of the trio during the Depression and Prohibition in rural Virginia, who made a living bootlegging moonshine. The novel is told from both the perspectives of the three Bondurant brothers, mainly focusing on the youngest, Jack, and that of the writer Sherwood Anderson. He described Franklin County in that period as the ""wettest county in the world"" while working there as a journalist during Prohibition.  The 2012 film Lawless, directed by John Hillcoat, is based on the book with a screenplay by Nick Cave.

bestofnetflix,2im2ou,psilontech,6,Wed Oct 8 13:06:20 2014 UTC,"I'm not that much of an anime person at all, but I absolutely loved the show and was blown away with how emotionally attaching and simply how, I don't know, amazing it was? The only words you could possibly use to describe it are ones I'd hate to since they're so over-used like ""epic"", but damn if it isn't.  Also, I was crying like an absolute baby on  the last episode."
bestofnetflix,2im2ou,Pootytang001,3,Wed Oct 8 13:29:06 2014 UTC,Agreed. The feels though.

bestofnetflix,2im2ou,sHaDowpUpPetxxx,2,Wed Oct 8 20:40:33 2014 UTC,It always gets me when people call 2 cour (24-26 episode) anime short. Most anime released in the past decade are half that.
bestofnetflix,2im2ou,sHaDowpUpPetxxx,3,Wed Oct 8 22:20:38 2014 UTC,"I say that because I think when a lot of people who aren't that knowledgeable about anime, including myself, think of anime, they think of  the famous ""long"" ones like DBZ, Bleach, Naruto, etc., and it's less intimidating to know that."

Some said the show was going downhill, like it had lost something when the original mystery wrapped up. My take on it is that most everyone involved was still at the top of their game throughout, but they made some bad plot decisions. Namely, the replacement arch-villain was a fucking bore. The cliche of human chess was beneath you, Twin Peaks. That dragged the late 2nd season down by itself. The 3rd season could have been a winner."

bestofnetflix,2igzb8,300apmCameron,7,Mon Oct 6 21:29:32 2014 UTC,One of my favorite shows of all time. Fully deserving of the praise it gets for kicking off the 'Golden Age of TV'. A completely groundbreaking show that is as relevant today as it was when it came out.
bestofnetflix,2igzb8,AwayFromReality,8,Mon Oct 6 21:08:14 2014 UTC,Can somebody convince me to give this show another try? Everyone keeps raving about it and I really want to like it. But I got through the first season and feel like the show is just being weird for weird's sake
bestofnetflix,2igzb8,HTSamurai,5,Tue Oct 7 02:49:58 2014 UTC,"it's definitely not for everyone. It feels like there are a lot of people i know claiming to love it because being a fan is cool right now.  You have to love it for the characters, for one. There's a really deep sense of Twin Peaks being it's own little world, and those who live in it are happy with that and so their existence isn't treated like Friends or Sienfeld where you probably know a few people who fit the character archetypes. Instead they're treated like very normal anomalies self aware only to an extent. And so we get to know these characters just as they are in their context, because outside of it they don't make sense.   And that's kind of what Lynch is amazing at. Building these worlds that don't make sense without, either, being really into it naturally because of personal taste and experience, or some serious cognitive dissonance to get past that hump then learn to enjoy it. Kind of like bourbon, it's not really enjoyable to most people at first, but once you learn to appreciate it it gets to be something special.  The other thing you have to, not endure, but appreciate, is the actual story being told. For example Breaking Bad is amazing, probably my favorite show I've ever watched. It's amazing in that it tells you a story and doesn't get too self important, like reading Chronicle of a Death Foretold, eh...not a great comparison actually, more like 100 Years of Solitude, where you're just being told a great story by a great story teller. Which makes it super enjoyable, this understanding of people leads to being able to express things without having to blatantly say them. Hank's obsession with rocks/minerals as an excuse to not have to dwell on what's going on and the turmoil that both things bring to his marriage and his overall life. His relationships with everyone changing for the worst and him feeling helpless for, maybe, the first time in his life. Maybe 15seconds of television. It's fucking fantastic. Twin Peaks instead is more like being told an interesting story, which is interesting only if you like the elements found in it (murder, seclusion, anxiety, the occult, the idea of not knowing how to handle emotions or situations), in an interesting way. That is, disjointed, seemingly haphazardly (almost amateurly at times), and leaving a lot of things open to interpretation, to an extent at least. Like, is the place mentioned often, and visited by a few people (wont say what it is because you haven't seen the series), is it a real place or a metaphor for something, and however you want to answer that how does it affect the last few episodes and the whole of the series in turn? And if it is a real place can we take a lot of the  happenings seriously? and if it's not what does it imply about the people of Twin Peaks?   I'd say give it a shot again, if you don't like it it's not a big deal. Like I said, it's not for everyone. Just like a lot of shit isn't for everyone, even if it's cool to like it right now. But if you do give it another shot, approach it with out any expectations or hopes and just watch it, if you don't like it don't waste your time on it, just like you wouldn't with a book that sucks :)  TL;DR: it's definitely taken on airs of self importance, and a lot of people are really hipsetery about it. But at it's core it's an interesting story told in an interesting way and has a lot of elements that fascinate people. Give it another shot but with no expectations :)"
bestofnetflix,2igzb8,AwayFromReality,1 point,Tue Oct 7 14:18:54 2014 UTC,"Wow, that is an awesome description of the show and from what I have seen so far, fits perfectly. I agree that the show is left up to the user's interpretation for the most part which can come off as haphazard storyline. This was the major reason I was not enjoying the series, because the story kept jumping all over the place without defining the events properly.   I think I will give it another shot and won't be expecting the story to be properly laid out this time. Although I didn't like the characters much the first time around so that might put me off the show again. Thanks for your much detailed review"

bestofnetflix,2igzb8,HTSamurai,1 point,Tue Oct 14 05:19:43 2014 UTC,"the second season lags pretty hard, and it loses a lot of the charm of the first. Basically it's a long stretch of essentially build up or filler episodes, then the middle gets pretty good, drops off for a bit again, then crams so much shit into the last 2-3 episodes that you might want to watch them twice.  I'm not a huge fan of the second season, but the way it ends is nice. I can't say anymore without giving too much away :)"

bestofnetflix,2igzb8,nbenzi,1 point,Tue Oct 7 23:16:32 2014 UTC,"What lynch did was to shoot a TV series, a prime time soap opera, as a film, and not just a film but a David Lynch film.  There are many many layers to Twin Peaks, just as there is with any Lynch film. There are entire subliminal stories being told in the background of almost every scene that subliminally reinforce the emotional story, or reveal things that the characters are not aware of. Take a single example of the establishing shot of Mrs. Palmer in the kitchen. What is in the background? The Quaker Oats mascot and the Captain Crunch mascot- good and evil reflections of each other. Almost every shot is full of this subliminal stuff.  There are divisions of awareness/self-awareness throughout. For example the prime time soap opera was a cliche, the show embraces this. It is aware of what it is and purposefully includes every cliche of the genre, but turns each on its head in the execution. ""Meta"" was not a term in use then, but the viewers are people watching the soap opera in which the characters are people watching a soap opera. Many times the duality of the themes spins into a larger circular cycle that involves the viewer.  The show is not perfect by any standard, parts of it are downright awful, BUT it does have stretches of pure genius that far outweigh the low points. Basically anytime Lynch was at the helm everything goes right.  You also have to keep in mind that prime time television was brain dead when Twin Peaks aired. The emotional strength of the pilot demonstrated what was possible on TV and was used to reinvent television. The music and visuals were miles away from standard TV fare. It is safe to say that, in the pilot, the long slow pan downward of the phone cord, accompanied by the descending octaves of the music was the first time an audience was manipulated into bursting out crying on cue, en masse, on national TV before. It would have been unheard of to spend that amount of time for emotional effect on a TV show- it would have been considered wasted time. Once the emotional payoff was proved it opened the door for creative direction on television. The shows you enjoy today most likely owe a great deal to Twin Peaks."

Having watched this in the past though it is an awesome movie that does a great job of telling the story and getting you to care about what's going with the protagonist."
bestofnetflix,2i95y2,SilasDG,12,Sat Oct 4 06:23:14 2014 UTC,It always annoys me when characters talk to themselves in full sentences while alone for the sake of the audience.    This movie proves how unnecessary that can be. Dialogue would take me right out of this movie. All the emotion and motivation being conveyed through nonverbal expression and circumstance was a great way to build and sustain tension and emphasize the loneliness and helplessness of the character.

bestofnetflix,2i6oze,AirBacon,1 point,Sat Oct 4 02:47:44 2014 UTC,I assume to judge demand for quality cooking shows on netflix. It actually makes sense for netflix and food network/cooking channel (same company) given you can pull the episode up on your phone or laptop with a tap to pause and play while you follow along.   Plus Alton Brown is the best cooking show host possibly ever.
bestofnetflix,2i6oze,Fire2box,-5,Mon Oct 6 19:34:50 2014 UTC,I had to watch this show daily for my nutrition class in high school. There are some interesting facts but it was very sleep worthy at the time. Might have to check it out again though.

bestofnetflix,2i6oze,Dawnsc2,1 point,Sat Oct 4 16:16:39 2014 UTC,"Identifying an obviously condescending comment as condescending makes it seem as if you think you are the only one with the brain power to understand inflection.

bestofnetflix,2i0vh0,dumbest_comment,2,Thu Oct 2 10:42:59 2014 UTC,They have done that with a few British shows now... I guess because they're the sole distributor or something in the US?

No sport has changed so drastically in such a short span of time like skateboarding did.  From the Z Boys in the 70s to Bones Brigade in the 80s, skating changed virtually overnight, and a small handful of innovative teenagers and twenty-somethings are to thank for that.  As a preface to this documentary I would recommend Dogtown & Z-Boys, also directed by Peralta, and just as good."
bestofnetflix,2hntcw,tortus,1 point,Sun Sep 28 01:06:14 2014 UTC,"What I find even more interesting is since then, skateboarding really hasn't changed much at all. After these guys revolutionized it, there was a few years of refining it. But from there, it's been super stable.

bestofnetflix,2hk3fq,ChaosDesigned,9,Fri Sep 26 20:06:39 2014 UTC,Decent show. I wish they focused more on space than history lessons. Neil deGrasse Tyson spends many episodes getting off on science.   Lots of neat images. Very educational. Falls off after the first few episodes.
bestofnetflix,2hk3fq,The_Realest_Ninja,3,Sat Sep 27 17:57:55 2014 UTC,"I kinda agree with you on that point. I feel there is an underlying tone throughout the entire series that kinda has something to prove, and they go about it a little too preachy. My friend I watch it with often tells me it sounds like they're trying to sell Science as a Religion or at least an alternative. I get the impression they are trying hard to disprove Christian's for the most part, and other anti-science religions.   The show does taper off after a while, kinda straying from the wonders of the universe, but the history lessons I feel are very well done, and very important to the overall theme of the show. It shows that Science is not just one person saying, Point A, it's one person saying, I have an idea and testing it, then another person taking that idea and expanding on it, or disproving it, and it's a constant system of people correcting, and reexamining what they know to be true, (Unlikely Religion).  It also shows how they came to understand some of the things they explain in the first 2 Episodes. My first question through out the first few episodes was ""How the fuck do they know this!?"" Then the history lessons kinda explain to you the process that went through to them being able to discern this information as true."

I then explained it to them really simply, and they all had to stop because I was the one explaining and they were just having their minds blown. My cousin couldn't comprehend the event that just occured and was constantly saying how the fuck does he know that...  In other words great show...science is the shit..."

bestofnetflix,2hedem,stupdizbu,6,Thu Sep 25 03:45:14 2014 UTC,"Watched this after a previous reddit recommendation. I gave it 2/5 stars. Basically it's an interesting premise that quickly turns into fantasy porn and then into a head-scratching game of Wait-Why-Did-They-Do-That.   The frustrating part is that the characters' motivations are always totally opaque. Yeah, they were broke and are now happy to have money. Yeah, they are being manipulated by a magic teapot. I understand that some suspension of disbelief is required.  But they flip the switch between greed and altruism so many times it's like they're testing the light. There just isn't any real character development after the first 2 minutes of the movie, and when they ""muster their inner moral reserves"", the audience has no clue where it came from.   Audience: ""Oh, I guess their true love was enough to occasionally overpower this ancient object. Huh. I wouldn't have guessed that, since all they've done is have sex and buy things.""  Wasn't really impressed by the main actress's acting either, and she seemed weirdly too young for the role."

Huge tension from start to finish; top notch acting; and, paradoxically scenic and bleak. It's an excellent show.  I spent the first few episodes thinking that ""Happy Valley"" was an ironic title. It turns out that it is a district of West Yorkshire, nicknamed for its drug problem.  Sarah Lancashire is amazing and should receive awards for her performance. Happy Valley has confirmed a Season 2 is in production."

With Arrested Development they added a little (Semi-) in front of ""Original"", but this show is being renewed for another season by BBC One.  I guess it's because BBC doesn't technically broadcast in America, or maybe it does with some kind of satellite or special cable subscription. Either way, I agree that it's unfortunately misleading."
bestofnetflix,2h8283,masterbatesAlot,2,Wed Sep 24 12:28:04 2014 UTC,Maybe they part funded the production? They might have then received the global streaming rights. Netflix then are producers. Just as bbc are.

Cry-Baby and Serial Mom are the only two that I can think of off the top of my head that I really enjoyed.  So as a person who is not a John Waters fan, This Filthy World is great. I've watched it a couple times over the years. It's genuinely really funny and interesting and I find myself pretty often re-telling snippets from it to people.  But it is hard to get other people to watch it, because those who don't know who John Waters is don't care because they don't know who he is and those who do know who he is don't want to watch it because they know who he is."
bestofnetflix,2h6a5u,CoruscantSunset,4,Tue Sep 23 11:16:06 2014 UTC,"""To weak"" made me cringe. Almost makes me not want to give this movie a chance. I'm familiar with who john Waters is. I certainly haven't seen anything that would make me sick or ""to weak"" to watch any of his other material.   Terrible description OP."
bestofnetflix,2h6a5u,MisterTanuki,2,Tue Sep 23 11:47:16 2014 UTC,"I agree. I didn't really get that comment, because This Filthy World isn't a film. It's a lecture Waters gave, so it's like stand up.  It's just him talking about his life, influences and telling anecdotes. Many of those anecdotes are about Pink Flamingos, but This Filthy World isn't like a watered down version of Pink Flamingos for squeamish people or something...  But bad description aside, I do recommend it. It's an interesting assortment of stories about life growing up different and the trials and tribulations of film-making, especially when the films you're making are of the sort Waters and Divine made."

Farscape's a bit long in the tooth now but had a pretty big cult following (I own all the DVDs).  And then there's things like The Secret Circle.

bestofnetflix,2gs44w,Jemer12,1 point,Fri Sep 19 01:51:20 2014 UTC,"I liked a lot of aspects of this movie. Most of the fights were great, the high wire one being the notable exception. The visual style was mostly interesting. It fully committed to it's premise, which a lot of referential/meta movies do not.  But all the character stuff fell flat. And a lot of time was spent on the character stuff. There was far too much of it for both the protagonists and antagonists. There were incredibly superfluous characters that were just there to reference some things and they were still given a lot of screen time and suffered badly from we-have-to-give-them-something-to-do syndrome (I'm looking at you, Woody & Demi).  A lot of the reference/meta stuff felt forced too, as it often does when it's a cross cultural reference.  I'd say it's worth a watch but it's a seriously flawed film."

It shows how different people have different perceptions on what is Horror. I didn't think I would enjoy it but I really did and I recommend it to any horror fans."

bestofnetflix,2gqeq3,antigravity21,3,Thu Sep 18 06:07:32 2014 UTC,Yeah it's a bit of mixed bag with the different shorts depending on tastes. But some of them are awesome and it's beautifully shot through most of it.
bestofnetflix,2gqeq3,x0mbigrl,3,Thu Sep 18 06:27:30 2014 UTC,"This movie plays way better in a group than on a solo mission.  It starts off very strong and goes downhill from there, with a few flashes of brilliance here and there.  There is something for everyone in here though.  A few of the shorts were excellent, but most of them were meh and a few were awful.  At least the awful ones don't drag on for too long.  Letters A, D and (i think) L were my favorites.  D is actually up there with some of the best pieces of film making I have seen of the past few years and is really unforgettable.  If you like horror and have a couple friends with you that enjoy horror too, definitely watch it.  You can talk and laugh and have fun while the movie is playing without worrying about missing dialogue.  More enjoyable that way."

bestofnetflix,2glyzd,philly_beans,6,Wed Sep 17 04:29:48 2014 UTC,Best thing about this show imo is the way they really make Crichton a believable character. Its like they sat down and thought out the challenges a human being would have in a totally alien environment. I believe in one of early episodes he complains about how he still hasn't figured out how the doors work on the alien ship. I recommend it to all my friends.

From the Trivia section in IMDB:    The event described in the beginning of the film is based on an actual event. In February 2000 at a US military facility located in the center of Seoul, a US military civilian employee named Mr. McFarland was ordered to dispose of formaldehyde by dumping it into the sewer system that led to the Han River, despite the objection of a South Korean subordinate. The government attempted to prosecute Mr. McFarland in court, but the US military refused to hand over the custody of Mr. McFarland to the South Korean legal system. Later, a South Korean judge convicted Mr. McFarland in absentia. The Public was enraged at the government's inability to enforce its law on its own soil. In 2005, nearly five years after the original incident, Mr. McFarland was finally found guilty in a court in his presence. However, he never served the actual prison sentence, and there have been no sightings of a mutant creature in the Han River - yet."

I get that it's a drama and things are going to be changed around for more dramatic effect, but the whole ""everyone hates Stacy Peralta"" thing just bugs me. Stacy was not an outsider amongst the Zephyr team. He wasn't some straight laced nerd that only made it on the team because he proved himself worthy after the fact. Stacy was one of the best. There was never any question that he was going to be on the Zephyr team.   It's just small things like that. Like cooking the three main members' personalities down to just their bases. Jay = bad boy, Tony = rockstar, Stacy = straight laced goodie good... The characters are more caricatures of their real life counterparts than actual realistic representations.

For me, it's been the only anime to hold my attention for a whole season.   Many of the characters do look alike; that's a plot point. There's a reason for it, and it's very interesting how this population came to have so many people look so much like each other.  There are deep questions here, ethical and political. Their society has evolved away from what Earth societies were like. And they aren't the only world-ship to have escaped the end of Earth.   Good stuff."

That being said, it kept my attention for 12 episodes.    I liked it and will watch future seasons, but I wish the show spent less time sidetracking into teenage romance drama.  The only part of the romance that was remotely interesting was the concept of a character that can choose their gender to match their partner, and the implications of that.  But the writers don't really explore the idea much since the main character friend-zones him/her right off the bat.  Also, the space fight visuals use a lot of CG and kinda clash with the hand-drawn art."

Sailing is hard, and operating a boat that size alone would be exhausting, especially given the stress of the situation.

bestofnetflix,2frtvm,cavehobbit,2,Mon Sep 8 22:49:07 2014 UTC,"HAH! We were watching at the same time.  Pretty mice little doc, lots of famous voices even if the actors that perform them are not. Some are, and some are surprising. They cover voices from a U.S./English perspective, but include those who have done voices for games and dubs for foreign films like Cowboy Bebop, so it is a wide range of actors"
bestofnetflix,2frtvm,Sr900400,1 point,Mon Sep 8 11:08:27 2014 UTC,"Haha nice!! Yeah I was pleasantly surprised at how many different perspectives of the profession they talked about, not just creating different voices and staying in character and doing a bunch of takes. I enjoyed that they talked about video games, foreign animation films, the history of voice work, and how they each got into that type of acting and how different they are from actors whose faces we actually see on the big screen. And they all seem to be influenced by and have a huge amount of respect for one another."

The show does change quite a bit once it is near the end of the first season, and sort of has a groove going by then. So if you don't like it by the end of the first season, I would say the show probably is not for you."

bestofnetflix,2f7bz1,wpiman,5,Tue Sep 2 00:56:52 2014 UTC,Yeah it is far from that. It has a tone more like shows such as Weeds or a bit like Fargo. The tone is much lighter than the Sopranos.
bestofnetflix,2f7bz1,horking,2,Tue Sep 2 01:00:14 2014 UTC,I originally avoided it because I thought it would be something like The Sopranos. After reading reviews about it I thought I would give it a look see and I'm glad I did. Very happy it was not like the typical crime-family celebrating shtick.

However you don't see this until later in the series. You see that they are a lot less 2-D and see who they are and why (especially with Bojack).  Its really funny, with some of the best continuity in any animation. There is also a surprising amount of emotion and themes being explored too, it can get pretty bleak and sad at times.

You realize how organized everything ends up being and it takes away from how ""free"" the event is. There is barely any focus on the event which is what would make this exciting, instead of an incredibly boring documentary of people in cubicles and warehouses."

There's plenty of footage of the actual BM event, you rarely see the same crazy vehicle or person twice, but it does deal primarily with the background of the running of the event, and the problems they face as it grows.

Or rather, their spending isn't in proportion to their income, like the rest of us.  Tried to explain to my brother-in-law during the last presidential election. We were talking about billionaires, I explained to him that if my gross was my net, and I saved every single penny, it would take me more than 568,000 years to get to Buffet's net worth. Granted, that's a bit of a made up example, there aren't a lot of Buffets and it assumes I didn't invest my money but stuck in in a shoe box.  But still, I'm doing pretty well. I make more than twice the national median income. And he still has more than 1/2 million times as much money as me."

I live in Oregon (moved here 4 years ago), haven't been to a baseball game in 20 years, and suddenly, I have VERY strong feelings about what the only real baseball team in Portland is, :)"
bestofnetflix,2d16ck,GoodOnNetflixdotcom,3,Sat Aug 9 04:37:18 2014 UTC,"As a British expat living in the USA, I've watched a few ball games, ultimately deciding that America’s pastime isn't in the same league as cricket. I was, however, almost tempted to change my mind by this documentary’s archive footage of a feverish 1970s Civic Stadium, letting me in on the vibrant joie de vivre of fiercely loyal fans witnessing one of the greatest underdog stories in sporting history. Not only that, this movie transcends the game itself and I’d even recommend it to non-sports fans, as well as people who (like me) just don’t know an RBI from a balk.  Here are some other reasons to watch:   Kurt Russell's stories of his father and the Mavericks are a winning highlight, as are the somewhat sweary recollections of Todd Field (yes, the Todd Field that's now a Hollywood director). This movie is for those who enjoy seeing rebelliousness, passion and individualism being rewarded with victory over the establishment. Beyond the drama and comedy, there's a more serious message about the corporatization of sport and how it has consigned the barnstorming zeal of personalities like Bing Russell to a bygone era.   But in the interests of balance, here are some reasons you might not like it:   It's an utterly biased and nepotistic hagiography by the writers and directors, who are paying tribute to Bing Russell (their grandfather), while playing fast and loose with a few of the facts. The direction isn't that innovative and some key moments aren't on film, so this has the feel of a glorified home movie, albeit one lent a corporate sheen by being a Netflix production. The documentary peters out a little towards the end, with an anticlimactic conclusion that would have been rewritten for a fictional movie."

bestofnetflix,2d3xws,Jpakolypse,12,Sun Aug 10 00:19:48 2014 UTC,"I would seriously not recommend watching this film. It is the worst documentary I have ever seen. There is not one single fact given about fracking in the entire film. It's not even really a film about fracking, it's a film about how farmers are pissed about the fact that they got stiffed the benefits of leases on their properties.  At best it's about the politics of fracking and gives you zero information on fracking itself but that is even a serious stretch. I have never watched such a less informative documentary. At times it even felt like a straight up commercial and moved to completely arbitrary topics."
bestofnetflix,2d3xws,bronzekite,-3,Sun Aug 10 13:27:27 2014 UTC,"There is not one single fact given about fracking in the entire film.   What do you mean? They discuss elements of the process of hydrolic fracturing to extract natural gas at several points in the movie. They speak to experts like Bruce Ames of UC Berkel. They talk to property owners who have wells operating on their land and those who have been affected by legislation targeting the natural gas industry.   they got stiffed the benefits of leases on their properties.   The farmers which they spoke to believe they got stiffed by regulation which outright banned fracking in their area. He tried to discuss the issue with the Director of the Delaware River Bason Commission.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYYhLFbSX-Q   At times it even felt like a straight up commercial and moved to completely arbitrary topics.   Every topic discussed in FrackNation was either related to the fracking or Josh Fox's film.    I have never watched such a less informative documentary.   You're just being dramatic. The message of the film is primarily that Josh Fox's film Gasland is fairly inaccurate in the way it frames the argument, and at times, creates an untruthful narrative to advance the message of the film. The most evident example involves the scene where Fox ignites well water in Burning Springs and then attributes the phenomenon to local fracking practices. The truth is that the water source of Burning Springs has been known to be flammable for centuries, and was even known by understood by Fox himself. This is even documented on Gasland's wikipedia page:   The documentary film FrackNation was inspired when documentary filmmaker Phelim McAleer confronted Gasland director Josh Fox at an event in Chicago. McAleer confronted Fox about the historical records of people being able to ignite natural gas in water at ""burning springs"" long before fracking started. Fox responded to McAleer's questions by saying that this information was not included in Gasland because Fox did not think it was relevant. After the video of the questioning [37] was made public, Fox and his lawyers had the video removed from YouTube and Vimeo, although the FrackNation filmmakers successfully fought to have the video reinstated. This further led McAleer to believe that FrackNation was necessary to counter the ""one-sided approach taken by the media, 'outsiders' and 'urban elites'"".    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasland#Negative  Here is the short youtube clip mentioned in the article.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9CfUm0QeOk  And here are a couple more examples where Mr. Fox embellished the truth to support his film.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9gMOJpyYzo  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j4pnF8GzqQ"

Its not one of those so bad its good movies either. This movie contains giant robots, mysterious mad scientists, secret island bases, Gwyneth Paltrow, an air base (pretty much exactly like the Avengers'), and gratuitous dogfights both above and below the sea. If any one of those things don't intrigue you enough to watch the movie then you need to sit down and reassess your life choices.

bestofnetflix,2cfv5k,byzantinebobby,1 point,Tue Aug 5 01:16:20 2014 UTC,"My review of this movie: SPOOGE!!! GAH!!!  I love this movie and the people who created it. It's not a perfect movie but it is a great fun movie. I would LOVE LOVE LOVE to see more of this style from Kerry Conran. He proved you could make a stylized digital reality with next to no budget and basically home computers. He was the first to do this and this still outshines a lot of digital crap being pumped out today with true style and masterful design. It is a walking encyclopedia of fantasy and sci-fi culture and design. Fleischer brothers robots, Buck Rogers, Captain Midnight, Dan Dare, King Kong, Lost Horizons- just too much glorious stuff to catalog.  To put this film into context, it is a modern version of what Karel Zeman was doing in the 1950s and 1960s with his Verne and Munchhausen films- paying homage to past futurism by creating magic out of nothing. If that doesn't mean anything to you or get you excited, then go ahead and hate, it won't change how great this movie is.  I love the story line with all the subtext that is visual rather than outright explained. The opening shot establishes that this is an alternate reality when a dirigible docks at the empire state building, which it was built to do but never got the chance. This sums up the movie, it puts on display all the promises of futurism that never came to pass.   There are clever nods and clues all through the film. We see the ship ""The Venture"" sunken on Totenkopf Island, telling us this is Skull Island from Willis O'Brien's King Kong (totenkopf means skull). The same shot reveals underwater Greek ruins indicating it is also Harryhausen's Mysterious Island. Later we see the chains of guardian beasts that indicate it is ALSO one of Harryhausen's Sinbad islands. I just love the hell out of this movie.  There are flaws to be sure, but almost all of them can be traced to the original creators running out of time and money and having the thing handed over to the studio for fast and half-assed completion. You can almost tell exactly where this happens throughout the film. I like to think of this as a half finished project rather than a whole film. It is too bad it couldn't have been released as a cliff-hanger featurette instead of a hobbled together movie. If it went over this could be a whole new money-making draw for studios- the rebirth of the serial.  For me there are a couple of nagging annoyances that I always hoped were due to the hand off- that damn camera for one thing. It magically switches between flash bulbs and electronic strobes, and magically switches between parallax viewfinder and through the lens viewfinder. The creators were just so obsessed with detail that this in particular really really annoys me."

bestofnetflix,2btb1v,foedufafa,2,Sat Jul 26 22:35:33 2014 UTC,I've been to two of Spalding's performances and he was such a great storyteller. I remember that everyone was rolling in the aisles as he told the story of losing his sight in one eye and the journey to find a cure.  I was fortunate to meet him after the performance and he was such a warm human being. Someone who's missed as much as if he were family.
bestofnetflix,2btb1v,NotYoursTruly,1 point,Thu Jul 31 00:38:20 2014 UTC,This is such a phenomenal documentary about one of the absolute greats in spoken word/monologue theater.
bestofnetflix,2bnjmb,cowsinspace,10,Fri Jul 25 01:53:17 2014 UTC,"I've commented every time I see this film posted.. This movie is truly outstanding. It's really not something to watch because you're expecting some plot of massive scope and resolution, but rather because you want to get lost in a few incredibly deep characters (Joaquin is AMAZING in this film).   In addition, the film raises questions about human nature, the necessity to be lead by someone, gender roles, etc. It doesn't necessarily answer them, though (it really depends what you get out of the film). The film is loosely about scientology, but I think the purpose of it is far larger than just creating an L Ron Hubbard like character.  If you don't like it and find it boring, it's completely understandable. But it's well worth the viewing purely for the portrayals of the characters."
bestofnetflix,2bnjmb,OhTheStatic,0,Fri Jul 25 14:33:23 2014 UTC,The end scene is brilliant. Happiness by his own hand; no leader needed.

bestofnetflix,2bnjmb,filmingej,2,Fri Jul 25 20:15:33 2014 UTC,"Really, it's not about the cult though.  It's more of a character study about the two leads, and watching how their characters grow and change over time, or in some ways, how they stay the same.    There's a lot to this movie, and a lot that I know went right over my head.  Saying it's about Scientology doesn't do it justice.  I think it's bigger than that."

bestofnetflix,2bnjmb,filmingej,6,Fri Jul 25 16:03:02 2014 UTC,Agreed. From certain technical perspectives (cinematography and acting) this film is fantastic. From a story perspectives there's just so much that is wrong with it.

bestofnetflix,29uhrk,PotentialApathy,1 point,Fri Jul 4 22:30:42 2014 UTC,"I thought it was actually pretty good. It definitely gets more interesting as it goes on, and even though they're super amazing at attention to detail, it's still a harder sci-fi than say, any of the Stargate shows.  I think of it as ""BSG-lite"". It has more compelling ethical dilemmas than most ""teen"" shows (it's not like this is Mako Mermaids or something). People have to make choices where there isn't a clear answer, and they don't always makes the correct choice in retrospect. Characters are also killed off suddenly and unexpectedly - and not just as the culmination of the final episode. The themes and feels of surviving against all odds while making tough ethical choices really does feel like BSG, or perhaps more accurately Tomorrow, when the war began.  But like I said, this is still ""BSG-lite"". A lot of the time the characters seem to be holding the idiot ball a bit much (though I suppose they are supposed to be teenagers). Some of the romance gets a bit cheesy, though not that bad - and no worse than the later seasons of BSG. They also mess up the orbital mechanics sometimes, but every show does that anyway."
bestofnetflix,29uhrk,Astrokiwi,4,Sat Jul 5 03:16:28 2014 UTC,"Just the worst show.  Couldn't even make it through the first episode.  Terrible acting, cringe-worthy dialogue and a pretty dumb story idea to boot.  1/10 would not recommend."

It has humorous moments but it also made me cry. It is very sad at times and definitely not a light hearted comedy as I expected it to be."

A true gem of a movie.

bestofnetflix,29c2f5,SmallTownMinds,5,Sat Jun 28 21:59:36 2014 UTC,I really liked it. Sad but beautiful film.  I think it's the chemistry between Cheadle and Sandler that really makes the movie work. I'd say most people sees the movie through Cheadle's character and how he tries to understand what has happened to his friend and how he can reach out to him.
bestofnetflix,29c2f5,iamlogan,6,Sat Jun 28 22:16:31 2014 UTC,"I've always been interested in seeing this movie, but I have been hesitant  because I'm worried that it will be devastatingly sad a la, Click.   Can anyone speak to level of sadness I am likely to feel from watching this movie?   Without being too spoilery, I would at the very least like to know that the movie doesn't end on a sad note."
bestofnetflix,29c2f5,acuteboy,7,Sun Jun 29 03:33:36 2014 UTC,It's not as sad as Click...it's 3000 times more sad. It's a roller coaster of emotion. Definitely a must see. It ends...better. Things aren't good but they're better.
bestofnetflix,29c2f5,SmallTownMinds,3,Sun Jun 29 06:05:44 2014 UTC,Goddamn Click was a sad movie. Why did they make it so sad??

I think the fact that it caught me off guard played a big part as well.  I went in expecting a Sandler flick with an interesting, supernatural-ish plot device, kind of in the same vein as Liar, Liar or Yes Man, but DAMN.   Half hour in and it was all downhill from there.   Sad Sandler is just too sad for me."
bestofnetflix,29c2f5,jkain,2,Sun Jun 29 03:45:05 2014 UTC,"Does Click remind you of The Family Man with Nicolas Cage at all?  I thought that movie was touching many years ago.  I think I need to see Click.  And speaking of sad, Funny People made me want to slit my wrists."

bestofnetflix,2971i7,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 26 23:29:23 2014 UTC,"Kon-Tiki:       Kon-Tiki was the raft used by Norwegian explorer and writer Thor Heyerdahl in his 1947 expedition across the Pacific Ocean from South America to the Polynesian islands. It was named after the Inca sun god, Viracocha, for whom ""Kon-Tiki"" was said to be an old name. Kon-Tiki is also the name of Heyerdahl's book; the Academy Award-winning documentary film chronicling his adventures; and the 2012 dramatised feature film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.  Heyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in pre-Columbian times. Although most anthropologists as of 2010 had come to the conclusion they did not,    in 2011, new genetic evidence was uncovered by Erik Thorsby that Easter Island inhabitants in fact do have some South American DNA,  lending credence to at least some of Heyerdahl's theses. His aim in mounting the Kon-Tiki expedition was to show, by using only the materials and technologies available to those people at the time, that there were no technical reasons to prevent them from having done so. Although the expedition carried some modern equipment, such as a radio, watches, charts, sextant, and metal knives, Heyerdahl argued they were incidental to the purpose of proving that the raft itself could make the journey.  The Kon-Tiki expedition was funded by private loans, along with donations of equipment from the United States Army. Heyerdahl and a small team went to Peru, where, with the help of dockyard facilities provided by the Peruvian authorities, they constructed the raft out of balsa logs and other native materials in an indigenous style as recorded in illustrations by Spanish conquistadores. The trip began on April 28, 1947. Heyerdahl and five companions sailed the raft for 101 days over 6900 km (4,300 miles) across the Pacific Ocean before smashing into a reef at Raroia in the Tuamotu Islands on August 7, 1947. The crew made successful landfall and all returned safely.

bestofnetflix,28x178,Jerfy,3,Tue Jun 24 04:25:48 2014 UTC,I Watched it and thought it was very cringe worthy and likely scripted in some parts.   Which is unfortunate because i thought I would enjoy it.   Basically this documentary is about a bunch of nerdy ass kids and it sucks balls
bestofnetflix,28x178,BIGsean3000,3,Tue Jun 24 15:17:40 2014 UTC,"As a magician, there is several problems with this.  Tannen's Magic Camp, while being fun for kids, is far from the most prestigious magic institution in the world.  That distinction would probably either go to the Magic Castle, the IBM, the SAM or the FISM awards.  Tannen's was the world's most famous magic shop sixty years ago but now, magic shops have been sidelined and marginalized by the rise of youtube and video editing.  Young magicians used to be (mostly) a group of young people who would put together decks of cards, build things out of string and cardboard, cigar boxes and household objects and spend hundreds upon hundreds of hours reinventing effects and attempting to perfect routines.  I watched five minutes of this doc and it was nothing but kids with parents who throw lots of disposable income at them to buy ready-made effects from magic shops, spend a few dozen hours performing them and then throw the effects up on a stage at a magic camp or competition.    There's a reason magicians are seen as laughing stock instead of genuine artists now and this is a big part of that reason."
bestofnetflix,28x178,alsorobots,3,Tue Jun 24 00:03:31 2014 UTC,"Why is it more ""real"" if they use shitty cigar boxes and cardboard?"
bestofnetflix,28x178,TPUBGU,1 point,Tue Jun 24 06:30:41 2014 UTC,"First of all, most commercial magic effects are little more than exactly that.  The first mirror box I ever bought from a magic store was three color cardboard and it cost around forty bucks.  Secondly, because it encourages creativity!  It's good for kids to buy a magic book instead of a prop or effect and actually put in the work to build one themselves out of items lying around the house.  Commercial effects CAN be (in some cases) indispensable, for example, when David Copperfield started in magic as a teenager (by the name Davino, Boy Magician) he bought a dancing cane from Tannen's and ended up on national television performing that routine!  The construction of professional canes can be so precise that they're unable to be constructed at home, but as many magicians will tell you, unless it's a thumb tip or a machined coin or machined brass cups, most of it can be built at home using magic books.  So I guess my bottom line as to why is READ THE FREAKING BOOKS.  They're dirt cheap and readily available in book stores, libraries, (online), etc.  edit: Not sure why the downvote, unless I'm surrounded by wealthy magicians who hate reading.  Seriously, though.  When you bought Tarbells, either in mail form or in book form, it didn't come with coupons to buy 300 dollar effects that you may use once or twice.  It told you where to find the building materials and asked you to build it yourself.  It's part of the magic experience, to construct your own unique props.  I've gotten more pride performing McDonald's aces than any other effect and all that costs is a 7 dollar deck of specially printed cards.  Other than that, it's all practice.  Sure, you can buy the DVD that teaches you the effect, but unless you're David Copperfield, no one is going to look at your sparky velvet change bag and think ""wow, this is amazing because he spent 40 bucks on that prop!"""

bestofnetflix,28x178,PLSfeel,-1,Tue Jun 24 02:34:58 2014 UTC,"The documentary is presenting these kids as if they are a ""real-life Hogwarts"" which is not only bizarre but disrespectful of actual magicians and performers in that vein.   I don't mean to sound harsh to any kids that may enjoy the escape of a magic camp, but the art needs serious students if it is to continue and thrive.  Bottom line: magic as a live performance art form is basically dead, or on it's last few breaths.  I hope some kid comes along and revives the art form.  edit: I'm not smart enough.  Maybe someone else will be."

The role of the American Evangelical church and it's missionaries in Uganda, especially in the country's politics. American Evangelicals feel called by God to bring their mission to Uganda, constructing large churches, creating schools and spreading the political and moral views of the Evangelical church. The film suggests that North American influences lead to the establishing of the cruel and controversial Ugandan Anti-Homosexuality Act which makes homosexuality as a criminal offense, punishable by life imprisonment or death penalty. The film also touches on the North American influences had in the Bush era on the control of the AIDS/HIV epidemic specifically in Uganda. The church promoting abstinence over use of contraceptives and sex education."

To be honest, there's an obvious turning point where people get sick of watching it and the level of entertainment definitely takes a downturn.   However, I don't even watch much Anime so Death Note provided a great pace and watchable storyline that didn't seem extremely far fetched or riddled with untidy plot holes. It's an extremely serious and captivating question about power and corruption, and touches upon the dualities of morality.  It's really an amazing watch and I would implore anyone to give this show a try, even for just the pilot episode.

Whether you approve of the subject matter or not (street art), you will still appreciate how engaging this film is and how it depicts the powerful impact of an iconic artist like Banksy, demonstrates the evolution of a function-driven designer like Fairey, and how it unveils a daft impostor like Brainwash.  CHECK THIS FILM OUT! It made waves when it was released and not without reason"
bestofnetflix,282w7h,WarrenHarding,1 point,Tue Jun 17 21:45:50 2014 UTC,I always had the theory that Thierry is Banksy and he was hiding under our noses the whole time
bestofnetflix,282w7h,robotbeard,3,Sat Jun 14 01:35:06 2014 UTC,"I've heard that too, but Bansky was active across the globe before Thierry ever discovered the street art movement."
bestofnetflix,282w7h,WarrenHarding,2,Sat Jun 14 18:36:26 2014 UTC,"Right, because he didn't discover the movement, he was part of it, according to the theory"
bestofnetflix,282w7h,robotbeard,3,Sat Jun 14 18:41:30 2014 UTC,"That means he was running a second-hand store in America and flying overseas to make art for years just to separate his two personas, that he would later very publicly associate.   That would also make Bansky the most committed and convincing actor and filmmaker ever. I think he's just an amazing artist who saw Theirry's enthusiasm and raw footage as a challenging medium to work in."
bestofnetflix,282w7h,WarrenHarding,2,Sat Jun 14 18:50:42 2014 UTC,"You're acting as if Thierry's life story couldn't have been an alibi though. His family could have all been actors. I'm saying this movie could barely be a documentary. Again, just a theory though."
bestofnetflix,282w7h,robotbeard,1 point,Sat Jun 14 18:55:21 2014 UTC,"Now were getting in some 9/11-conspiracy-sounding theories.  Yes, maybe he set out to make this film over the course of several years, hired actors, set up a store for them to run, flew back and forth from USA to UK constantly, all while shooting enough unnecessary footage to make Theirry's cut of the movie. Also, not shooting himself (or the actor[s?] playing Bansky) installing and creating tons of art, so that the movie would feel like these two characters were meeting for the first time in the movie.  Let's go ahead and assume you're Bansky too and you're putting these theories out there just to add buzz to your movie."
bestofnetflix,282w7h,WarrenHarding,1 point,Sat Jun 14 19:07:44 2014 UTC,"Lol when you see a movie that takes place in a random store do you think ""man it sucks they had to set up that shop and pretend to run it while they were shooting""... Or if you see a movie that take place in two different countries do you think ""wow I can't believe they had to go back and forth between countries to do this"". When you watch the office do you wonder how much paper they managed to sell while making the show?  What I'm saying is that it's a movie, just like any other movie. It's just made to look like a documentary. And it's not that hard to do either. They didn't have to run a real shop or fly back and forth between countries to make a movie. They probably filmed all scenes in Europe and then filmed all scenes in the US, because in my theory, none of the stuff in the movie is real."
bestofnetflix,282w7h,robotbeard,1 point,Sat Jun 14 19:22:27 2014 UTC,"Here's the best evidence I can muster. I found nothing compelling saying he was a fraud. From Mr. Brainwash's wiki page:   An LA Times investigation found ""[the] details of Guetta's unlikely biography are broadly supported by a review of public records, which trace his life in Los Angeles from his arrival as a teenager in the early 1980s. They are also consistent with the accounts of friends, former business associates and employees over those years.""[19] Friends the Times interviewed confirmed the film's story that Guetta was constantly filming and several notarized documents prove that he hired someone to assist with the construction of his film Life Remote Control.   I'm pretty convinced he's an actual separate person."

bestofnetflix,27ze4a,ilikeeatingbrains,3,Fri Jun 13 01:22:03 2014 UTC,"I didn't really enjoy this movie, primarily because the entire story revolves around people forcing things in her pussy. It's like they left out the part where they mention that the movie takes place in Sexual-Assault City.  If the main character had been sexually aggressive and evil with her pussy teeth, it would have been more fun and easier to watch."
bestofnetflix,27ze4a,robotbeard,4,Thu Jun 12 21:53:50 2014 UTC,"So I just watched it and I only counted one rape, one gynecological mishap, one mid-coitus mood swing, and one deliberate penis mutilation. I thought it was amusing but I can see how someone may find the subject disturbing."
bestofnetflix,27ze4a,NirodhaAvidya,2,Fri Jun 13 00:17:15 2014 UTC,"Gynecological mishap   He straight up molested that girl. That was probably my least favorite part. Vagina teeth or no, that guy should have lost his licence and gone to jail.  I think the idea of a sexually deviant gynecologist is a lot scarier than vagina-dentata."

His voice is completely monotone, his insights are basic, and he focuses entirely too much on himself.  The documentary is supposed to be about the subject, not the documentarian.  Some of the interviews, when you get past all the fanboys, are interesting and provide understanding of the world of syndicated comics, but when it comes to talking about the strip itself, there is absolutely nothing new brought to the table, and it just devolves into a public forum for people to suck Watterson's dick.  Like we haven't done that enough already.  I love the strip too.  I'm not going to make a movie showing myself telling the world I love it."
bestofnetflix,27fby0,WhereMyKnickersAt,7,Fri Jun 6 13:59:04 2014 UTC,"Agreed completely. Recently turned it off halfway thru. It was, frankly, just a giant circle jerk of people who love Calvin and Hobbes. I love C&H a ton, hence my interest in the movie, but it had no point."

There's honestly a scene where he's just flipping through an old binder of the newspaper strips that he cut out as a kid. This goes on for like, 3 minutes."
bestofnetflix,27fby0,bohawkn,2,Fri Jun 6 15:33:40 2014 UTC,"You hit on all of my complaints as well. The narrator's voice was monotone and kinda lispy, but I'll forgive the errors just because it was wonderful that he interviewed so many other cartoonists and we heard more professional opinions of Calvin and Hobbes.  I think that in the case of Dear Mr. Watterson, with the subject being famous for their shyness from the media spotlight there is only so much you can do. So rather than make the film about Mr. Watterson (a rather impossible feat given how reclusive he has been) they made it about the comic strip and the impact that it's had on the lives of those who read it; documentarian included."

Seems like a big over-reaction to just thinking an idea was dumb.  I guess maybe he thought that the audience would hate it so much they would focus on it and ridicule that one scene forever?  That scene was never one of my favourites from the film (I personally love when Ed O'Neill steals the camera and walks off with it, telling it some sordid tale of murder and Wayne has to come back and tell him that he isn't allowed to talk to the camera) but the scene is decent and certainly not something I would have seen him getting so mad over.  Maybe he was mostly annoyed at the time that he didn't think of it.  Anyway, thanks for that tidbit! I had never heard that before."

bestofnetflix,27bd8n,akambe,3,Thu Jun 5 07:01:50 2014 UTC,Quality jokes never get old.  I've seen comedies released in just the last few years that seem more dated than Wayne's World.  Or perhaps it's the nostalgia factor. It pretty much packages up and delivers a massive blast of funny from the time just before things like grunge and britpop came along and changed the scene.

I think Ricky tries to stuff too much drama into 5-6 23 minute episodes and it feels forced as a result.

bestofnetflix,276hph,OtherLutris,4,Tue Jun 3 13:32:53 2014 UTC,"One of the best fantasy movies ever made. Overflowing with rich anachronism, humor, and philosophy. Also, perhaps, my favorite ending of all time.  With that prefaced, it is important to go into it with the right mindset. There are a lot of non-sense fantasy movies that meander in whimsey. It's sad to say but this has meant that people don't understand the difference between very deliberate constructive works like Alice in Wonderland and Baron Munchausen and their imitators.  The difference is that in the real deal you get rewarded for paying attention, for expecting things. Very few works would be ambitious to contemplate the scientific enlightenment, the meaning of improbable stories, loss and death, in the same work as spinning godheads (literally)."

What sucked was i was expecting basically a long music video with everybody saying what an awesome soundtrack there is.  The music in it is good, just not nearly enough.  The stories were lacking in background and why things were happening.

That place is hands down the most racist place I have ever been in my life. I was a sophomore in high school and played football and basketball games against the fucks who were the subjects of this film. If anyone watched this documentary and wanted some more insight into the whole issue or just an opinion from someone directly impacted, thought I'd offer it out.

A lot of people aren't openly racist, but if you get someone talking for a few minutes, it's almost a guarantee that they'll say something racist. It's just the way that area is unfortunately.  The man that was murdered was actually at a party that I was at a few days before he was killed. He was playing pool with his friend and his girlfriend (wife? I forget). He seemed like a nice person. He wasn't causing any trouble or being loud/annoying/stupid. It was weird to think that a few days before he was at my house having a beer and a good time and then gets killed over his skin color.  I wasn't aware that they made a documentary over this. I'm definitely going to check it out.  Edit: Just finished watching it. A lot of people I know were in it. It was an okay documentary. Nothing special, but it was interesting just because I knew some of the people involved. The ""friend"" that was at the party with him that I alluded to earlier was actually Victor.

You might also want to watch it a couple of times even if it doesn't ""take"" on the first viewing.   I've always been a fan of the Kenneth Branagh version with him as Benedick and Emma Thompson as Beatrice. It has the advantage of a soundtrack that guides the mood and a kind of laugh track in that they is almost always a crowd around the characters who are speaking and that crowd laughs when something is funny. It made it a lot easier to understand for someone who only had ever read Shakespeare in high school and didn't like it then.

One of the reasons its a complete mess is that the head writer is a big 9/11 ""truther"" and tried to make 90% of it into an allegory for what he thinks really happened with 9/11 and, since that idea is a complete mess that makes no sense, so was the movie based on the conspiracy theroy.  On top of that, when people didn't like the movie the same writer then further angered fans by calling them stupid children.

I'm a star trek fan myself, and I wonder how much of the negative response is coming from people who were upset that they remade one of their favorite movies and not necessarily because the movie itself was all that flawed.  It had its problems,  sure, but for me, those problems pale in comparison to the problems felt by other star trek movies.  But we dont have to all agree.

That's a grade A terrible movie. If one needs a metric for bad Star Trek movies, that's where to begin. Anything else seems like gold after that... As far as the most recent one and the remake prior to that, I don't have any problem with either of them, I think they're both pretty good and I'm sure most who have seen them would agree.  In a 'reboot' of a series, of course elements aren't going to match up... It's a reboot. . . A fresh start, more or less. Same with the new 'Star Wars' movie."

I'm not a big star trek fan though I am somewhat fond of the old show. With that said, I didn't like this movie. The crazy thing is its hard to say why other than its execution was just off. For all the big action scenes I never felt any suspense, and the dialogue was terrible. Sadly as a huge Star Wars fan I think jj abrams is gonna further ruin Star Wars, and people who point to these new star trek movies as successes are lost on me since I would not watch this again."

bestofnetflix,25efut,crotchkiss,1 point,Mon May 12 22:58:55 2014 UTC,"98% on Rotten Tomatoes  Website  Story  Born in South East London the same week the Nazis began bombing, Ginger Baker’s first memory was running after a train that carried his father off to death in WWII. From his music to his life, at the expense of family and fortune, Ginger would never be left behind on the tracks again.  Though best known for his work with Eric Clapton in Cream and Blind Faith, the world’s greatest drummer did not hit his stride until years later in 1972 when he drove the first Range Rover ever produced from London to Nigeria in pursuit of the African rhythms and musical icon, Fela Kuti. There he found his Mecca of drumming, introducing the African beat and “world music” to the West, years before any other musicians in the field.  Unfortunately, Ginger’s African glory days were short-lived as he found himself looking down the barrel of a Nigerian officer’s machine gun. Signaling his departure from the continent and the loss of his fortune, Ginger returned to England where a pattern of divorces, self-destruction, and countless groundbreaking musical works continue on to Italy, California, Colorado, and current day South Africa where he lives inside a fortified compound with his 29-year-old internet bride and 39 polo ponies.  Chain smoking and ingesting copious amounts of morphine while sitting in his leather recliner, the 73-year-old reflects back on his life as we concurrently witness his current law suits, local disputes, and yet another chapter in his path of destruction. Unfortunately, Ginger’s ginger hair has faded, and we wonder if he is physically capable of saving himself by playing the instrument that has defined him. In his own words, “God is punishing me for my past wickedness by keeping me alive and in as much pain as he can. I wasn’t planning on living this long!” In true Ginger Baker fashion, 3 years into shooting the film, after squandering yet another fortune, Ginger Baker triumphantly returns to the stage. As he went on a 30 date sold out European tour, we were there to capture it.  The documentary includes stories from his ex-wives, children, and many of the greatest living musicians that worked with Ginger including Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Charlie Watts, Mickey Hart, Carlos Santana, Max Weinberg, Chad Smith, Femi Kuti, Neal Peart, Simon Kirke, Marky Ramone and many more.  This documentary is one such story – a marriage of the film and music worlds through the life of one of the most unforgettable and controversial musicians. He was there the night Jimi Hendrix died, shared the drugs, the music, the names, the groups, while stripping away the other voices as the conductor, time keeper, the master drummer of our time. Beware of Mr. Baker catapults the viewer into his beat – with every smash of the bass drum there is a man behind it smashing his way through life.

I have to sort of take issue with one thing though:  Jesse Eisenberg, though often cast exactly as ""Budget Michael Cera"" is actually a good actor.  I would personally adjust your statement to ""...have a hard time watching Michael Cera."" :)  Check out ""The Squid and the Whale"" - he doesn't play Budget Michael Cera - he's kind of an asshole teenager who's parents are going through a rough divorce and it's a pretty good showcase of his acting ability and a good drama."

bestofnetflix,2439p0,mverlei,2,Sun Apr 27 16:29:17 2014 UTC,I found the interviewer a bit cringy he seemed to anger many of the comics especially one in particular
bestofnetflix,2439p0,mrwazsx,3,Sun Apr 27 20:07:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah, he just didnt seem like a very socialable person. I remember a comic was telling a long story to him and when the story was over the interviewer didnt laugh and he just said, oh i thought they were selling food(or something else i dont remember)"
bestofnetflix,2439p0,AtTheParty,3,Wed Apr 30 22:52:12 2014 UTC,"Definitely, the one i was thinking about was the comic that told him the story about the name tags then after he finished the story the interviewer asked if the name tags were on balloons and the comic freaked out and started sulking"
bestofnetflix,2439p0,mrwazsx,2,Thu May 1 06:36:28 2014 UTC,"It was a place called ""House of Names.""  The names were on cups and the interviewer missed that.  I can see how you could get distracted while recording.  I didn't find the ""Tunic"" joke very funny. There were times in the documentary that it was suggested that non-Jews didn't get certain jokes because of their background.  No, it was because the jokes were lame."
bestofnetflix,2439p0,heliotropedit,2,Mon Oct 6 16:12:20 2014 UTC,"I wasn't sure if the interviewer was being cringy or the subjects were just being very difficult and overly-stereotypically Jewish?

bestofnetflix,2439p0,heliotropedit,1 point,Mon Oct 6 16:13:18 2014 UTC,"There were some funny moments and I enjoyed hearing about 20th Century Yiddishkeit. (I'm not Jewish, but am a New Yorker, so much of this culture was familiar, although the participants seemed very insular.)  The points about assimilation and comfort being deadly to comedy were true (which is why many successful assimilated comics satirize world events now, not personal experiences).  The film did not prove its thesis that Jews were, or are uniquely funny. As one older comedian said, in paraphrase, if a Jew was a comic, he was damned good, but there were plenty of funny Irishmen and Italians.  There was no discussion of the exclusion of black comedians.  I also began to tire of the filmmaker's personal issues. It really did begin to seem as if he was trying to atone for being a non-bar mitzvahed (I think he said that) Jew who'd married a non-Jew from another country.  It's also hard to be 60 years old, be married to a 38-year-old woman, and have a toddler."
bestofnetflix,2439p0,heliotropedit,2,Mon Oct 6 16:08:52 2014 UTC,It was interesting to me that no one mentioned the rather obvious misogyny underlying a lot of Jewish humor.  The stuff about certain sounds disappearing such as old Jews slurping soup seemed to me to typical of any poor ethnic group that has succeeded.

bestofnetflix,24025v,Astrokiwi,-4,Sat Apr 26 04:06:59 2014 UTC,"I felt it was almost more ""alternate history"" than sci-fi, but it's definitely debatable.

It's worth watching because it's the most realistic depiction of High School students I've ever seen. The characters are lovable and easy to like (especially if you're a film buff) and the movie is just really well made considering the circumstances.  What circumstances? This movie was shot with no budget, no script, no names, and a general lack of organization. All filmed and edited by a few young Canadians who are really good at what they do. The acting is great, the ""writing"" is great, and the cinematography is great for a movie made with no money."

Committed to her job and in love with kindhearted co-worker Mason (John Gallagher Jr.), she's still struggling to make sense of her own troubled past when she learns that her life is about to change forever. Meanwhile, into the facility walks a young girl who's been constantly shifted between group homes due to dangerous behavior. Almost immediately, Grace forges a powerful connection with her new charge.

Most of the jokes are in the red-band trailer, and other than a few Craig Robinson lines, you might find yourself giving up before it's over.  The cast does their best, but the script is super-weak."

bestofnetflix,235b8q,alsorobots,1 point,Wed Apr 16 14:39:24 2014 UTC,"Yikes.  You poor, poor thing.  This film wasn't a cash-grab like what you watched, but it's ultra-low budget and some might find the lack of sets a bit constrictive (the anti-christ lives in a mid-sized mansion with a vintage anti-aircraft gun mounted by the pool??).  Some of the actors are really pushing to make the film better than it is (Anna Gasteyer and Craig Robinson really try to make the film shine).  But Anna Kendrick sort of phones it in (perhaps due to the weak script) and a lot of the jokes that had promise are abandoned in lieu of pot-smoking jokes and sex jokes.  I would have liked to see more of the apocalypse, as the crows and locusts were pretty funny, even if they were basically the same joke twice.  Take the antichrist angle away and make him ruler of a third world country and the movie would basically be the same premise.  The ending is left vague (and a bit too convenient) with no clue as to whether good or evil won in the end.  Overall it's basically a mixture of Zombieland, Napoleon Dynamite and the Hangover with a much weaker script than those films and a LOT of reused jokes from other films."

I feel like from the start the actors never took it very seriously and it shows but really that's not bad.

Regardless, if you enjoyed The Silence of The Lambs I highly recommend checking out Red Dragon.  It's the third release in the series but it's actually a prequel, so you can watch it without having to watch Hannibal.  Edward Norton gives a great performance in the film if you are a fan of him."

Sure, it does a great job showcasing the camionetas and bringing up the issues with the cartels but that's about it.  We don't see anything into the past, there isn't any real characterization, and the film fails to provide a thesis.  Maybe I'm biased having already been familiar with the process..

It would have been better as a bad sci fi movie. It should have stuck to the same story line as the comic books that the film makers put out to promote the movie. Those comics were dark with a compelling story.   But for the movie, it appears the filmmakers were too unsure of themselves so they laugh at themselves the whole time. I say pass."

bestofnetflix,22wzps,Hawtdickitydang,4,Sun Apr 13 10:45:36 2014 UTC,"SAO is one of those anime that tries to cram in way more than it should have, making it a massive package of meh instead of doing two seasons building off tension from the main premise.   But, you can't blame SAO, because the problem is how the anime industry demands content. Rarely do you have two-season splits if they can anticipate a 25 episode run being successful based on manga sales.   Still, I'd recommend SAO. It's a good balance of corny, high-intensity action and drama. The end of the series is really interesting, and it answers most of the questions regarding the premise's real-world applications--I really appreciated that aspect."
bestofnetflix,22wzps,Puffin415,3,Sun Apr 13 13:47:10 2014 UTC,"Yeah, a first season devoted purely to one setting would have made the most sense, although I'm not sure if ALfheim really would have warranted a full second season.

bestofnetflix,22q07u,iminalotoftrouble,9,Fri Apr 11 03:40:07 2014 UTC,"Foster a dog for a couple weeks. It should have several beneficial affects to those in your situation and I speak about this from experience. Being lonely makes you feel depressed and one way to get out of it is feel good for doing something to make a difference for someone/something else because you are making a real difference in the life of an animal in need which would otherwise be alone and scared while possibly heading towards being put down. It takes your mind off of your problems and helps you get out of your head space where in these situations the longer you are left to think about your issues might just reinforce them as insurmountably bad. You get the positive reinforcement of being loved and needed while you have a friend to play with and have positive feelings about/with. Dogs give us nothing but happiness and joy which is something that a whole lot of people could use.   Movies and shows take your mind off of the issues temporarily, but dogs can give you the positive energy that you need to deal with your issues and it might be the very thing that actually does deal with your issues if your unhappiness stems mostly from loneliness."
bestofnetflix,22q07u,BasedRex,6,Thu Apr 10 22:28:18 2014 UTC,"As someone who never had a dog until he was 29 years old, I strongly second this.  What's with the downvotes?"

bestofnetflix,22nu3q,nasua,3,Thu Apr 10 02:23:06 2014 UTC,Just saw this movie a few days ago. Good stuff.
bestofnetflix,22nu3q,Col_Monstrosity,2,Thu Apr 10 20:15:07 2014 UTC,"I had no idea it was glorified so much, the culture around the Narcos is unbelievable.  I suppose you could argue that it's no different from when hiphop appeared and started glorifying the gang/criminal life, but something about the narco culture just doesn't sit well with me.  The main thing that has just left me shaking my head was the contrast between the csi worker who risks death everyday and sees his colleagues taken out yet he has no other job opportunities, and the school girls who all wanna be the wives of narcos like they're football stars."
bestofnetflix,22nu3q,wax_addict,2,Sat Apr 12 18:17:03 2014 UTC,"I know, it is almost painful to watch how all these people glorify the culture. People have a bad tendency to glorify criminals. The outlaws of the west, bank robbers of the depression era, pirates, etc. are all seen in such a romantic light. it is easy to trivialize these things and turn them into stories of desperadoes.   As for the girls, that is the one way that they know they won't be poor. As bad as the work and life situation is for men, it is much worse for women. A narco boyfriend means that no one else will abuse her and that she will have some financial security and luxury. It's really depressing.   I think the narco culture is somehow more disturbing than other criminal cultures for various reasons. First, it's more violent. As violent as the gang wars of South L.A. can be, you don't see decapitations and such, you don't see mass murder of civilians just to send a message. The second problem is that these are men who have always been in violence and have had no access to education whatsoever so they don't create anything, despite their wealth and power. The style of music you hear in the documentary is nothing new, it has always been around, it is only the lyrical content that has changed. You may notice the influence of polka, inherited from German immigrants from a century ago.    The worst part of it all is that nobody is ready to acknowledge how bad it really is. I have seen narcos send cops on errands. They are funding the politicians all over Mexico, Central and South America. People think that narcos are in control of the rural areas of Latin America, but the truth is that their power and influence is massive and widespread. It's just a matter of time before we really begin to see the strength of their influence at a socio-political level in the Southwestern US."

SPOILER  So they skip 5 years forward, jumping past a huge number of events that they never tell the audience about, but keep mentioning in passing. This could work if it was used for any other reason than to confuse the audience, especially when it comes to red arrow, ms. M and SB's relationship, artemis and wally, tim drake, etc. Especially because everything they mention seems waaaaay more interesting than what happens during the course of the season."

bestofnetflix,22blm0,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Apr 6 04:00:45 2014 UTC,"Wiki for Nicky  Extra from movie of Nicky and Frank's first talk since he ratted on him  From Rottentomatoes:  ""As the political revolt, consciousness expansion, and calls for racial equality that dominated the late '60s gave way to the apathy, drug abuse, and materialism that would define much of the 1970s, Nicky Barnes was a man who seemed to symbolize this time all too well. Born and raised in a troubled household, Barnes grew up with few desires other than getting rich, and he did just that. Barnes was a drug dealer who promoted himself as the man with the best heroin and cocaine in New York City, and between 1970 and 1975 he became the wealthiest and most powerful illegal drug dealer in America. Heading an underground organization known as ""The Council,"" Barnes had a handful of top drug peddlers working under him, and shrewdly aligned himself with Mafia-connected drug importers, cutting out middlemen and offering himself a measure of protection at the same time. The booming market for heroin and cocaine (drugs Barnes himself used with enthusiasm) made Barnes a multi-millionaire, but as pride comes before a fall, Barnes' certainty that the police could not catch up with him led to his downfall, as one of his underlings unwittingly gave him up to authorities. In time, Barnes went into the FBI's Witness Protection Program and obtained his freedom by informing on the associates who helped make him a success. Barnes co-authored an autobiography in 2007, and filmmaker Marc Levin persuaded Barnes to tell his story on camera (though without revealing his face); Levin's interviews formed the basis of Mr. Untouchable, a documentary on Barnes' rise, fall, and disappearance into Middle America. Barnes' story was also featured in another 2007 release, American Gangster, a fact-based drama which portrays both Barnes and another powerful drug kingpin, Frank Lucas. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi"""
bestofnetflix,228dxh,bryanttt,6,Fri Apr 4 23:28:04 2014 UTC,"this movie will be most enjoyed by people who enjoy stand up comedy! the dialogue and interactions between characters is often played out similar to how a stand up comedian would speak on stage.  this means that for some people (who like stand up), the movie will be very funny and enjoyable. to others who aren't into over the top, exaggerated and dialogue-driven humour, it is difficult to watch, and extremely unbelievable and kind of annoying, really.  this movie is basically a hipsters typical movie. Hell, the co-founder of Vice Magazine created it. While I liked the plot, the acting and dialogue could have been done much better.  i'll give it a 6/10."

Why would the kid follow the dude into the Heroin house, and then get pissed for getting beat up? Are you FUCKING stupid? what did he think was gonna happen?   Hey let's film my infidelity, and just leave it on the counter. Also it was stupid how she just walked up and watched the footage, she showed no interest in what they were filming before.  When he told his wife that he quit his job, how did he not expect her to react like that? After the fight they had THAT MORNING it should be abundantly clear that she wouldn't support that decision.  The scene in the bar where the roommate orders wine was fucking unbearable. Costco-Joseph-Gordon Levitt looked so fucking smug I wanted to punch him. The roommate is right, HEROIN IS FUCKED!

However, Inception is just filled with so much awe and wonder, it's really hard for me to even begin to put this movie above it. It's not just production value either- there is something about the fantastical nature of inception that kept bringing me back to the theater- 3 times in total. I love all of his movies though, even if the opinion of him (and his movies) seems to be plummeting. Dark Knight, Inception, and Momento are all top 10 movies for me. Prestige is like a top 50.  I personally can't wait for Interstellar!"

I had seen it so many times that I could actually follow things they were saying and keep up with the movie.  It basically stopped me from freaking out and made me optimistic about the whole trip.  Good movie."

bestofnetflix,21z1od,BlindSpotGuy,1 point,Sun Apr 6 11:19:31 2014 UTC,"The thing about this movie is, that many people who didn't like it don't understand, is that it is not really a traditional sci-fi movie, but more so a French farce in a sci-fi setting. People who went into this movie thinking they were gonna get a serious action packed sci-fi film, like the trailers advertised, were instead greeted with a goofy movie with some action elements, but mostly absurd characters, and a pretty ridiculous plot, however that is exactly what it was intended to be by the director. Most audiences didn't get that it was meant to be the way it was."

bestofnetflix,21ymwr,LegendaryJay,14,Tue Apr 1 22:01:09 2014 UTC,"I recommend it because of its mind twisting and thought provoking nature. It makes you wonder about the decisions that have been made and the possibilities that could have been.   It's a tad confusing because it interweaves several stories together, so you actually have to watch closely rather than multitask.   IMDb: 7.9"
bestofnetflix,21ymwr,Swem188,3,Tue Apr 1 22:13:10 2014 UTC,"It was a bit confusing reminded me a bit of the butterfly effect but was able to figure out what was going on, it was when he started talking about the boy on the platform to the reporter that I understood exactly what was going on, you also have to keep in mind the bit about the angels at the beginning which makes him a not so typical person.  When he was a boy standing on the train platform he basically split in two and lived two maybe three different lives, as the old man he's telling stories from each of these lives and mostly why I guess he doesn't know who he is. When he watches the video of himself in the run down house he tells himself that he has to live until a certain date and time, at that time the boy on the platform decides which path to go because he then knows everything about his choice. At the time the old man dies the boy makes his choice then time goes in reverse so the old man can live that 1 life."

I remember thinking ""I wonder if this is what Cloud Atlas (a movie I haven't seen) is like"". Thanks for answering that for me.  This movie is also like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", ""The Science of Sleep"", kind of like ""Primer"", and kind of like ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"".  An m-theory love story? A child playing life ultra-chess? It's a several year old, very interesting movie with a huge budget that I never heard of before it appeared on Netflix. Pretty good stuff!"
bestofnetflix,21ymwr,colin_sick,4,Fri Apr 4 02:48:26 2014 UTC,"To be needlessly picky, it would be a ""many worlds"" love story- an interpretation of quantum mechanics in which parallel universes are made from each decision. M-theory is a byproduct of string theory in which entirely different and separate universes exist. Most universes in m-theory cannot support life as we know it... Or even stars and galaxies. The more you know, right?  But ya, if you like this movie, go see cloud Atlas. It was really good!"

bestofnetflix,21ymwr,psycho_pete,1 point,Tue Apr 15 01:52:06 2014 UTC,hated this movie. I watched it after someone made a post with the top list of scifi movies. I found it to be one of those movies that pretends to be deep and ultimately leaves you feeling like you wasted your time watching. Part of my disappointment is that I like for my stories to have satisfying conclusions. This movie felt like a hodgepodge of ideas that left me feeling empty. I would love to hear from people who watched it and also feel like it wasted their time.  Edit: Added this link which outlines some of my problems with this movie: http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/review-amateurish-muddled-sci-fi-romance-mr-nobody-starring-jared-leto-20130927  I've found three posts about this movie on the first few pages of this subreddit so I am copy/pasting this response to all three in hopes of a discussion.

Too much Asuna fan service and not enough plot or backstory to the gigantic harem where every girl wants the male lead's manhood.   SAO was based on a Light Novel which was BASED on a cell phone novel. Producers wanted a long story and had to stretch out what little content was available to pad it obsessively. Now there's well over 14 volumes with different MMO's and death became not an issue. THe whole science fiction virtual reality thing was shoved aside in favor of more girls and more terrible villains. I know this show is obscenely popular among anime fans but I just can't see the appeal here.   As an alternative to a similiar setting, I suggest watching or even playing .Hack GU for a much better character, setting and story."

bestofnetflix,20mulz,dabigua,5,Mon Mar 17 19:21:45 2014 UTC,It is black comedy. The dentist scene in the first episode is one such example. You giggle behind your hands that are clutched to your face in horror.
bestofnetflix,20mulz,dabigua,0,Mon Mar 17 21:44:42 2014 UTC,"Good example. Rather than giggling, I was wincing, and at the conclusion of the protagonist's effort, shocked. There was no really amusement - for me - in that part.  No doubt the difference is in the mind of the viewer. I will readily admit the show was very handsomely mounted and the structure of intertwining past and future was compelling.   One thing I wonder. I haven't much experience reading in the field, but the widespread perception is that Russian literature is often bleak and gloomy. This production of a Russian work reinforced that perception. Any thoughts?"

The Jonny Depp flick was thousands of times better in every possible way.  Recommend avoiding this one so not disappointed.  Was one of those films that does not age well.  As the previous commentator stated, very bad script if it could be called that at all. My impression is the actors were given basic information and told to just ad lib their way through it and by doing so the results were pretty forgettable.  Also a big Hunter Thompson fan and this is not something he would have signed off on knowing it ended as poorly as it did.  Just watch 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' twice and save watching both of these movies back to back. You will be happy you did."

Bill Murray and Peter Boyle do the best they can with a poor script, but in many cases, with no fault of there own, make for some cringe worthy scenes .   I'm a big HST fan. I really, really wanted to love this film. It's got Murray playing Thompson for Christ sake , so how could you not want to love this picture?

bestofnetflix,20f5r9,wellsdb,3,Fri Mar 14 23:19:47 2014 UTC,"I remember Fear and Loathing vividly, I hardly remember Where the Buffalo Roam. Fear and Loathing makes this movie obsolete.   Just compare this: http://myfiero.com/uploads/4800_.jpg  To this: http://24.media.tumblr.com/9647a01c577eac68bff7092cc60e1b09/tumblr_muionkVs1x1swzgjxo1_500.gif"
bestofnetflix,20f5r9,autowikibot,1 point,Sat Mar 15 05:12:13 2014 UTC,"Where The Buffalo Roam is loosely based upon the short story The Banshee Screams For Buffalo Meat by HST.  That story concerned Hunter's relationship with his friend Oscar Acosta, a chicano lawyer.  Hunter did not approve of the script which somehow became a mash up of several of his stories (F&L on the Campaign Trail 72', F&L in Las Vegas and elements from The Great Shark Hunt).  ""Thompson agreed to have it optioned without seeing a screenplay figuring that the film would never get made, as the vastly more popular Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas had been optioned several times and was never made.""  Bill Murray famously spent time with HST for the role and almost died when they got into a contest of who could out Houdini who.  Hunter tied Bill to a chair and threw him in a pool.  He almost drowned before they could fish him out.  After filming the movie, when Bill returned for a new season of Saturday Night Live, he was still in character.  He terrorized the staff and annoyed everyone by continuing to act like Hunter for several weeks into production.  The film is a bit uneven but worth the price of admission to see Bill Murray's take on Hunter.  Even the film's detractors admit the tone of the movie is spot on.  I love this film because it was made before most people even knew who Hunter was and paved the way for Johnny Depp's portrayal later on.    Lastly, the score originally had Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Temptations, the Four Tops and Creedence Clearwater.  However, when the rights to this music expired, a generic soundtrack was substituted.  Later copies of the film have this parody soundtrack.  The Hendrix family refuses to allow Jimi's music to be used in any film with explicit drug use.  If you enjoy anarchic comedy like MASH or early Monty Python I think you'll enjoy it.  For me it's a classic right along side other comedies that were bashed by critics when released (Blues Brothers & Animal House).  Where the Buffalo Roam"
bestofnetflix,20f3sc,EugeneHarlot,6,Fri Mar 14 18:05:27 2014 UTC,"Posted this on the other sub as well, but:  I really love this movie; it's tied with Kikujiro for my favorite Takeshi film. As said elsewhere, the mix of calm, almost meditative and childish fun at the beach house in Okinawa and the stark, very deadpan violence of other parts of the film is what makes this movie so uniquely enjoyable. This might be a little strange for people going in at first, but it's very much worth it. Also, absolutely love the beautiful synth soundtrack by one of the world's greatest film composers, Hisaishi Joe. He's best known as Miyazaki Hayao's constant companion and composer for very nearly all of Miyazaki's films, from Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind to Princess Mononoke to Spirited Away onwards. Hisaishi provided the soundtracks for all of Takeshi's early films up until they had a bit of a falling out."

Either that, or they have a hard time themselves finding DVD's which are out-of-print."

But it is arguably my favorite movie of all time. I love the subtleties, the relationship the two or them develop throughout the movie, the sense of bewilderment of being in such a foreign environment. It's not fast paced and is more about what is not said than what is said."

I've walked down the same roads they do but with doors linguistically open to me that to them were closed. It makes for a bit of a strange viewing experience."

Her cousin is actress Q'orianka Kilcher who is best known for her role as Pocahontas opposite Colin Farrell and Christian Bale in director Terrence Malick Academy Award-nominated motion picture, The New World (2005).   Jewel identifies as a feminist and has said, ""I don't think I started off young as a feminist. I read a lot of books in Alaska, I was pretty isolated where I grew up, and I think that I never thought I was any different than a man; I was raised in a place where pioneer women were very strong still.

I spent a lot of my childhood around the area where the film was shot too. My grandmother lived on a similar apartment estate, and I always loved how the film (and the book) communicated the snowy silence and isolation of the place. In the winter months the streets were always deserted, apart from people heading home drunk from the few places that would open to sell beer. Sounds dark and not nice, but those were the things that made it beautiful for me."

If you can find a translation that doesn't change the original author's tone of voice or language, or modernize it somehow, and just gives you the additional information you need to understand what's going on as footnotes, you realize two things:  1) It is a brilliantly written book written by a brilliant man who is making a lot of important points about his world in an absolutely hilarious fashion.  2) Everything, every political point, every joke, every character, in some way, is also a euphemism for a dick joke.  Dr. Strangelove is the modern reincarnation of Don Quixote.  It is a hilarious movie that has the intelligence to make a really scathing critique of modern 1950s culture in more ways than can probably be fully digested in a single viewing.  And yet at the same time, literally everything in this movie is also a dick joke.  Even the name, Dr. Strangelove, is a sexual phrase.

Sometimes I feel like the the only person who hated it. And I'm normally a fan of all things British, Simon and Nick seem to be the only exceptions.   Essentially it's over rated crap in my book."
bestofnetflix,1z6pz6,takesometimetoday,8,Fri Feb 28 21:28:00 2014 UTC,"I feel like that is the over all impression from people who didn't see it the first time around, but watched it at the suggestion of friends.  Not saying that is the case with you, but it seems that those that watched it without all of the overbearing hype that surrounds it enjoy it more.  The same goes for Napoleon Dynamite."
bestofnetflix,1z6pz6,Chemical_Cutthroat,-5,Fri Feb 28 22:56:31 2014 UTC,I watched it unfortunately in theatres. I didn't hear all the hype till later. Although working at a movie store certainly deepened my hatred for it.

bestofnetflix,1z6pz6,SapientSlut,10,Fri Feb 28 22:53:09 2014 UTC,"I'm a pretty harsh critic when it comes to horror films and I tend to shun anything that gets shoved in my face family guy style. Regardless of those facts I really loved Cabin in the Woods. It was a mix of how smart and self aware the writing was, the embrace of horror stereotypes and the absolute phantasmagoria at the climax. It was a new concept we hadn't seen before and the novel adaptation was mostly sound. Now I'm not saying at any point was it genuinely scary. The closest thing to scary in the film was miss Patience Bruckner played by horror darling Jodelle Ferland(seriously this girls résumé is just outstanding for her age). Her role was fairly small and I definitely could have done with a little more footage of her hunt.   My only problem with the film had nothing to do with anything other than the final choice made by the characters. I mean seriously dude?! That's what you're going with? Hopefully this is spoiler free. Cabin in the Woods is a must see in my book for fans of this new generation of horror. While not as genuinely startling as horror films of past generations they aren't without merit.   TL:DR - if you're looking to kill a couple hours with a horror flick see Cabin in the Woods before you subject yourself to a low budget US or Korean flick you've never heard of."

bestofnetflix,1z6pz6,falcon_jab,3,Fri Feb 28 18:48:35 2014 UTC,I think it's funniest if you like laughing at movie tropes. It's basically only funny if you enjoy the meta-ness of it. Otherwise it is literally just a shitty horror movie.

This case is very interesting from the perspective of coerced confessions and how easy it is to make them happen. I believe all but 1 of the accused  ended up signing written confessions as well as verbally confessing after interrogation. Excited to check this out."
bestofnetflix,1yo6tu,madgreed,3,Sun Feb 23 06:55:34 2014 UTC,I was really engrossed by this one
bestofnetflix,1yo6tu,quizzle,3,Sun Feb 23 08:11:41 2014 UTC,"Great film. Yusef Salaam, one of the five convicted, actually spoke at my University last weekend. He's a great guy."
bestofnetflix,1yo6tu,pisstones,1 point,Sun Feb 23 18:34:14 2014 UTC,That's pretty awesome.
bestofnetflix,1yo5w6,wesleyt89,3,Sun Feb 23 02:03:16 2014 UTC,It has been on Netflix before and I really enjoyed it. There is another documentary about the asylum mentioned in Cropsey that is interesting as well.
bestofnetflix,1yo5w6,amyorainbow74,3,Sun Feb 23 08:23:19 2014 UTC,"Just watched this last night! Good doc, what is the name of the doc about the asylum, I would have like more details on how it got I to that state!"
bestofnetflix,1yo5w6,UB13,2,Sun Feb 23 16:21:35 2014 UTC,Interesting and disturbing. Glad the treatments for mental health have GREATLY improved since then.
bestofnetflix,1yo67p,wesleyt89,3,Sun Feb 23 02:07:41 2014 UTC,"I have watched this twice so far. I love it. Can you suggest any similar titles? I have already seen Catfish, TalHotBlond and Imposter."
bestofnetflix,1yo67p,johnmcdracula,1 point,Sun Feb 23 21:50:09 2014 UTC,The Brandon Teena Story perhaps.
bestofnetflix,1yo67p,johnmcdracula,2,Mon Feb 24 05:13:32 2014 UTC,"I watched that just this week. Pretty good, except for the long country music interludes."
bestofnetflix,1yo67p,GamecockGirl04,1 point,Mon Feb 24 05:27:53 2014 UTC,"Central Park Five, Sons of Perdition."
bestofnetflix,1yo67p,johnmcdracula,3,Mon Feb 24 05:36:33 2014 UTC,Just watched Sons of Perdition because of your comment. Great suggestion - thanks!
bestofnetflix,1yo67p,johnmcdracula,1 point,Fri Feb 28 02:09:39 2014 UTC,Np. Glad you liked it.  Crazy doc.
bestofnetflix,1yo67p,BostonCab,2,Fri Feb 28 08:27:13 2014 UTC,Central Park Five it is!
bestofnetflix,1yo67p,johnmcdracula,1 point,Mon Feb 24 05:40:00 2014 UTC,Lemme know how ya like it.
bestofnetflix,1yo67p,lovearc,2,Mon Feb 24 05:41:51 2014 UTC,Sure! Thanks for the suggestion.
bestofnetflix,1yngjt,wesleyt89,9,Sat Feb 22 21:20:29 2014 UTC,Toooommmyyy? Tommy how's the peeping? How's the peeping Tommy?
bestofnetflix,1yngjt,polishprince76,2,Sun Feb 23 03:30:15 2014 UTC,"Watched this movie for the first time a few months ago, great movie!"
bestofnetflix,1yngjt,Monkey5,2,Sun Feb 23 08:11:42 2014 UTC,I thought the beginning was very slow but in the end I enjoyed it. Not that though in my opinion
bestofnetflix,1ynfe9,wesleyt89,5,Sat Feb 22 21:07:56 2014 UTC,Great show! Can't wait for Series 3 to show up on Netflix.
bestofnetflix,1ynfe9,cannellbd,4,Sun Feb 23 05:12:13 2014 UTC,IF YOU LIKE SHERLOCK YOU WILL LOVE LUTHER
bestofnetflix,1ynfe9,xboxaddict501,2,Sun Feb 23 05:09:00 2014 UTC,All I needed to hear.
bestofnetflix,1ynfe9,pokedrawer,1 point,Sun Feb 23 08:36:28 2014 UTC,This sounds like another rendition of The Cop Show.  A show where police solve one crime per episode. Am I wrong?
bestofnetflix,1ynfe9,the_whalerus,3,Sun Feb 23 19:25:47 2014 UTC,"I mean, yeah. If you wanted me to give as generic a description as possible? ""Show where police solve a crime"" fits the bill."
bestofnetflix,1ynfe9,cannellbd,2,Mon Feb 24 01:26:29 2014 UTC,Sometimes the crime extends into two shows.  :/
bestofnetflix,1ynfe9,the_whalerus,-2,Mon Feb 24 05:14:49 2014 UTC,REVOLUTIONARY!
bestofnetflix,1ynfe9,monkeymonger1,2,Mon Feb 24 05:38:30 2014 UTC,"Is this such a ghastly concept in America? It is a standard format in England.  If you want to lay everything out in such simple terms, then nothing will be interested."
bestofnetflix,1ynfe9,the_whalerus,1 point,Tue Feb 25 22:31:22 2014 UTC,It's a standard format here as well. A standard format that I have seen in enough iterations that I have zero interest in seeing it again. I swear every other show follows that format.   It got to the point I stopped thinking of them as different shows. They're all different episodes of a larger meta-show called The Cop Show.  It's the most popular show on television.
bestofnetflix,1ynfe9,the_whalerus,1 point,Wed Feb 26 00:44:34 2014 UTC,Can't argue with you there.  I probably wouldn't have checked it out if Elba wasn't in it.    I saw him in The Wire and he was great in that show.  Have you seen The Wire?  It's funny because that show is actually an exception regarding the norm and Cop Shows.  It's just as much about the criminals and the community as it is the cops but it is probably the realest cop show out there.
bestofnetflix,1ynh9c,wesleyt89,3,Sat Feb 22 21:28:30 2014 UTC,It's like a good version of Natural Born Killers
bestofnetflix,1ynh9c,slapstick2099,2,Sun Feb 23 04:21:23 2014 UTC,This is a great movie. One of my all time favorites.
bestofnetflix,1ynh9c,TheLawIsi,1 point,Sun Feb 23 04:58:49 2014 UTC,Just might have to watch this tonight thanks!
bestofnetflix,1ynh9c,sfdmfcssfd,0,Sun Feb 23 05:39:52 2014 UTC,This movie sucks.
