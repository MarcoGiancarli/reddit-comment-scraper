books,3e16d8,InfinitPossibilities,5,Tue Jul 21 14:51:17 2015 UTC,I came into this thread feeling bad about the tendency until this comment. I have no problem juggling multiple shows at a time and honestly can't imagine just watching just one at a time. I don't think it makes sense for me to feel differently about books. Not sure why I was hung up on that.
books,3e16d8,hegemonistic,4,Tue Jul 21 14:13:12 2015 UTC,"I put 'shows' in there kind of haphazardly. I don't really do this with shows at all.  Shows are a mindless activity that don't take any effort. You just turn it on and watch.   With a book, you're the only thing that keeps the pages moving. A show will keep moving whether you do anything or not."
books,3e16d8,SteveNick,3,Tue Jul 21 14:36:12 2015 UTC,"I almost couldn't disagree more. If you consider turning the page effort, then shows just have longer pages, because you still have to watch the next episode. Otherwise all you have to do is scan your eyes along the page or cast your gaze upon the TV. You can just as easily get lost in your own thoughts reading a book as you can watching a show. But I say this as someone that really loves television but rarely watches shows when they air, so I'm not just sitting in front of the TV having the viewing experience served to me. I arguably put more thought into the shows I watch than most of the books I read, considering I usually finish a book in <3-8 hours and maybe have a conversation or two about it at the most, but I often spend 20-50+ hours watching shows like True Detective, The Wire, The Americans, etc. almost always engaging in an episode discussion once every hour or so of that. (I'd love to discuss books more but I'm not part of any book clubs so it can be hard finding fellow readers.)"

I'm able to read everyday now so I've been grinding through books like crazy. Finished all the ones started and am on my 20th book of the year. I found a good system to use, I call it the triple system, where I have three books going at once for different times of the day.  I'm currently reading Neuromancer as my day book to read in the morning or afternoon, House of Leaves as my scary / horror book to read at night, and The Anatomy of Evil to read as my educational / fictional.

The Gunslinger is a little challenging to get through, just because it doesn't tell you what it's about. But it's only like 180 pages. But as soon as I got to the first door in Drawing of the Three, I was hooked and I lost a lot of sleep finishing that."

books,3e16d8,bpakish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:40 2015 UTC,"Oh yes. At first I felt a little guilty, but eventually I realized it's often indicative of a flaw in the book. The pacing, plotting, or even the prose is not quite rewarding enough. A good book should carry me through; even if there's a lull in plot movement there should be somethimg rewarding about every chapter, whether it's a subtle bit of character development or just some lovely prose.   I find a lot of books start to sag at the halfway point for me. It's as if a lot of authors have fun setting up the world at the beginning, and know where they want to end up, but they can lapse into just bumbling through the middle without a real grasp of the psychology of pacing. A well-written book should have no ""boring parts.""  I do make an effort to finish anyway sometimes, if just assure myself that it's not just me being lazy with my attention span. But more and more I will let the book go and not finish. Time's too short in my life to read sub-par books."

And that this is an accomplishment worth being proud of won't change, even if this is the last book you read (though I hope it isn't).   It took me a couple of days to read The Children of Hurin.   I still haven't finished reading The Children of Húrin, so you're ahead of me on that.   if you asked me right now to retell you the story in the book I'd have a difficult time and would probably only be able to give you a general outline of what happened.   Eh; I read all the time, and this still describes a large number of the books I've read. I tend to go back and read books more than once, so I eventually remember most of the important details, but I can rarely remember exactly what happened and in what order after a first read.  Despite my love for the legendarium, tales from Tolkien's Middle Earth are particularly difficult for me in this regard.   I am, however, surprisingly proud of myself for reading a book.   You should be, and it's not at all something to be embarrassed about. In 2013, roughly 24% of adult Americans hadn't read a book in the past year. I don't have data to back this up, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if a majority of those people hadn't read a book since high school. You're no longer a part of that group."

I'm a huge fan of L.E. Modesitt Jr.  He's written a ton of great books- ""The Timegod"" and ""The Forever Hero"" are a couple of my favorites. The first one is about a race of time traveling immortals that manipulate entire civilizations to sustain their own, loosely modeled on Norse mythology. The second features the story of a single immortal on a centuries-long mission to restore a shattered Earth to habitability after a cataclysmic war.  Both have a way of getting into the ramifications of immortality that I don't think I've seen anywhere else. Great characters, interesting ethical questions, sleazy politics, and general badassery are to be found throughout both.  /End rave  Edit: spelling"

books,3dy66g,notkenneth,15,Tue Jul 21 06:54:54 2015 UTC,"The Silmarillion is tough. I tried it years ago, made it about a quarter of the way through the Valaquenta and decided that I was never going to read the Silmarillion.  It's very complex, written as lore (and what I mean by that is that it's effectively a historical/legendary text in universe written by the elves) and has a huge amount of names, place-names, and names for different characters; characters will often get a new name when something important happens, or will be referred to by different names according to who's referring to them. Places and geography are referred to throughout, and it can be difficult to remember exactly what the hell is going on. There will be characters or items that are introduced, named, catalogued and then never referred to again; as an example, Tolkien explicitly names the horns (the Ulumuri) used by the Vala in charge of the Seas to play a song that once heard can never be forgotten. Music's a theme, but as far as I can remember, the horns' name is never brought up again; you'll never get to a point where someone is referring to that and have to remember that ""Oh! Those are the horns!"", but on your first read through, you can't know that you won't have to know that, really.  It is very intimidating. It's very difficult.   You should read it.  Because here's the thing with the Silmarillion; once you get into the groove and understand what's being referred to when, and once you start being able to connect different parts of the mythology, it is flat-out awesome. Everything that you liked about Lord of the Rings is effectively a much smaller echo for the scale on which things are happening in the Silmarillion. And, because you just finished a book about Turin, you get more of what led up to his father's capture, you get the construction of many of the places in The Children of Hurin, and you get echoes of the story both before and afterward. Beyond that, you get literally earth-shattering wars, you get the creation of the world, you get things like the story of Beren and Luthien and you get things like an elf named Fingolfin demanding single combat against one of the most powerful creatures in existence in a scene that can only be described as unrelentingly metal, though I'm sure Tolkien wouldn't have used quite that phrasing.  What I found very helpful was the Silmarillion Seminar a series of podcasts by a professor who led an online class on the Silmarillion. Most of the students hadn't read it before, so it goes at a fairly reasonable pace and gets in-depth into what's going on in each chapter.  They're very long, though. Much more of a ""chapter a week"" sort of project, but I found it to be a very helpful way to get through the Silmarillion."
books,3dy66g,TheFinalStorm,2,Tue Jul 21 01:32:27 2015 UTC,"Ah damn it, you might have just convinced me to go and try and read the Silmarillion again. Tried reading it back when I was about 14 or 15 but it was way too much for me. Since I was such a huge reader at that age that's saying something too. Do you think it will be worth another shot? My reading is much more casual and in smaller doses than it used to be, so I might not be able to commit to it."

And I loved reading Tolkien, and I consider myself a moderately fast reader and it still took a while to get through The Children of Hurin. The Silmarillion might be my favorite, it is tough beause it does have a ton of those obscure landmarks and soo many names and stuff but it does click after a while and you get the idea of the story and it's very epic and very cool and it's not important to worry too much on the details and you don't have to memorize all the descriptions of everything because what matters is just having a feel of the story and knowing what's happening, pretty much. I have a hard time getting myself to read sometimes, there were some times where I spent years without reading and I feel a little bad afterwards because it's really great and I feel like I missed out so I'll try to keep reading.

That's not to mention how strange the first bit about creation can be. If you insist on ploughing through it, I'd recommend a few visual aids:  Evan Palmer's illustrated Ainulindalë (the first part of The Silmarillion) - http://www.evanpalmercomics.com/ainulindale/ This is beautifully done and really captures the spirit of the Ainulindalë. It's also very nice to have since it is an obscure and abstract topic presented with very flowery writing.   Family tree's of the elves and men - you can find these all over the Internet. (I don't have any particular ones that I prefer or I'd link them.) These are pretty handy to help you get through long, convoluted genealogies and keep names straight.   A timeline of events - The Silmarillion contains an incredible amount of events and it can be hard to remember them, let alone keep them straight. It's also nice to keep around as a refresher of what's happened 'up to this point'.  Congrats on your first book and welcome to the world of Tolkien!"

Why aren't you reading the LOTR trilogy, for crying out loud?  It's much more engaging.  It's got a lot more going on than is represented in the movies.

Those can be harsh decisions, as there are billions of choices available.  Isn't it great?  Congratulations on your first book. Really, my sincere congratulations. I should mention that ""Children of Hurin"" is an immensely complicated boom to read, specially as a first read.  Don't stop now. Keep reading. Grab another one, maybe from another movie that you like. Harry Potter, anything from Stephen King, whatever. The process of movie to book is much richer than book to movie. You'll have a blast.

This isn't to say you shouldn't read it, but don't expect to easily follow the lives of individuals or keep track of which characters are doing what in which places.  While it's been formed into a coherent story, it's nevertheless a work of mythology. Huge, sweeping events spread over centuries, with a focus on the greater work rather than the individual narratives. While there is dialogue, it's much more like a narrator telling you what was said than an individual saying it.  After having read The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit, one has a sense of where the world is going. Then, when someone like Galadriel or Elrond shows up in the Silmarillion, the reader can use the ""later"" books as a tether: ""This person, I know."" But even so, a lot of people find that they can't make it through the Silmarillion because it's not really a story in the sense of your typical novel."

I have never read it through, and probably never will. I found myself spending so much time Googling, that I decided it would be better to just Google everything I wanted, and needed to know instead."

Second, I haven't even bothered trying to read TCOH because (a) it looks unnecessarily difficult and (b) I don't believe it is likely to be some of JRRT's best work.   Dude, if you loved the movies of LOTR, try the books, which are approximately one bazillion times better.  Start with The Hobbit, which is super easy and fun and not at all what you will be expecting based on the movies, but which is the actual origin of all this stuff.  You'll get a taste of the real Tolkien.  Then, if you like it, consider reading the rest.    There are lots of great and, probably, much easier reads out there -- if you want to ask for suggestions I'm sure lots of folks will be happy to make them."

Sounds like I picked a great first book, huh."

books,3dy66g,ChickenChic,5,Mon Jul 20 22:49:33 2015 UTC,"The Hobbit is definitely a kid's book, and it's a little weird and goofy.  If you are used to the Peter Jackson versions, you will probably find it amateurish and a little lacking in seriousness; I mean, at several points he makes asides to the reader as though telling stories to children (which he was).  But it's the real thing, and it's where all of Middle-Earth* and most of modern fantasy started, and it is also, fortunately, a wonderful book and absolutely fun to read.  After that, it's really interesting to read the first book of LOTR, which starts out in much the same vein, as clearly an attempt to write a sequel to The Hobbit.  After a few chapters it suddenly starts turning serious and grave, and by the end of the book it is something else entirely.  It's amazing to watch that transition happened as JRRT totally changed what he was writing.  Anyway, yes, read The Hobbit.  But don't get stuck in Tolkien, or even in sci-fi and fantasy (and especially not in cheesy sci-fi and fantasy).  For example, to pick a favorite Catch-22 is one of the most amazing things I've ever read, and while it's a lot harder than The Hobbit, it's probably a lot easier than The Children of Hurin.  * Obligatory JRRT pedant footnote: Yes, he had been working on the Elvish languages and parts of the Silmarillion for a long time before The Hobbit.  But this was when his ""secret vice"" finally came out into the world, and he started."

This encountered played out in a rather friendlier manner in the first editions of the book than in later editions, which were changed to better match the greater mythos of The Ring. However, any edition you're likely to find at a general book store will have the darker version of events, as these have been part of every printing since the 1950s."

Were they simply not available or was there some social or financial reason you did not read them beyond simply not wanting to? I imagine not reading a book would be pretty common for someone in your age group but was there never a point before LOTR that someone or something prompted you to read a book? What was it about LOTR that made you take the plunge compared to other insanely popular media franchises?  You also don't really seem to struggle with writing in general. Do you do a lot of reading outside of books? Like texts, surfing the internet, etc?"
books,3dy66g,Comedynerd,7,Tue Jul 21 08:05:07 2015 UTC,"Bravo, sir!  I teach university, and every year I have a few students who aren't used to reading complete books, as well as students who, in their words, ""read slowly"" and thus have trouble keeping up, so I've dealt with some of the problems people have with it.  A few pieces of advice I often give:  (1) Don't feel obligated to parse every bit of information. I find that some people who aren't used to reading feel obliged to pay attention to and remember every detail on the page, and end up overwhelming themselves with exposition. Often, what you lose by skimming a little is made up for by keeping the story moving.  (2) Getting acclimated to the story is often the biggest challenge. When you first start a book, and have no idea yet what characters are important, what their goals are, what you should be hoping for, or what details are vital (vs just background and color), it can be difficult to retain information. If you find you have this problem, it sometimes helps to read a short summary of the book in order to wrap your head around where the story is going (nothing elaborate enough to give away endings, but enough to provide the plot's set-up). The first 50 pages or so are usually the hardest, because once the plot is underway and you know the major characters, it becomes much easier to continue on with the story. As such, giving yourself a little help with those early pages can make a big difference.  I hope you stick with it!"
books,3dy66g,7LeagueBoots,5,Mon Jul 20 15:34:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I would have been one of those students who had never read. I stopped buying textbooks my junior year.   I appreciate the advice. That's actually really helpful. Knowing that I don't have to re-read a paragraph or sentence over and over to fully understand is a big relief. With future books I will try to focus less on understanding every single detail and more on getting the story. I also decided to read the preface for the Children of Hurin. While also confusing, it still helped set the background for the book. So because of that, I will definitely continue reading brief outlines of the story before I dive in. At least until I have a couple more books under my belt."

I didn't put off reading as much as you did, but as far as reading books in my own leisure (and not for academic purposes), I can probably count on two hands the books I've read since high school.  I just never made the time for them.  That changed for me very recently, and now I can't stop! Trying to hit on all the classics I've missed out on over the years.  Whatever you do, don't feel discouraged or even embarrassed.  Some people go their whole lives without reading a book.  I've found /r/books to be a fantastic resource.  Do some research and find something that sounds interesting to you and go crazy!  Another thing to remember: as with any skill in life, you can only get better at it through repetition.

books,3dy66g,vandeley_industries,3,Mon Jul 20 23:51:55 2015 UTC,"The Silmarillion is a hard read even for people who have already read the other Middle-earth books.  It's written very much like ancient mythology, which means it jumps from one narrative to the next constantly (entire stories happen within a paragraph, or within a sentence) and there are countless names (which includes many Elves that have very similar names).  If you are going to read the Silmarillion next, you have to know that you're not going to remember every character or detail the first time.  You can look up a name sometimes if you need to be reminded, but other times it's probably going to work better for you to just read what's in front of you.  If you're always trying to remember every single thing, it's going to slow down your reading and make it harder to finish the book.  I haven't read the Children of Hurin yet, but reading that first that might help you with certain sections of the Silmarillion, since the Children of Hurin story was originally told in the Silmarillion (the Silmarillion includes pretty much everything in Middle-earth, so that also includes the events of the Hobbit and LOTR).  I would still recommend reading the books in the order of The Hobbit, LOTR, and then the Silmarillion.  The Hobbit is a fun, accessible little story in Middle-earth.  LOTR is a bigger story in both scope and style; One aspect that the LOTR movies never really handled was that the characters reference events that happened in the Silmarillion (they look to their own history/mythology during the War of the Ring).  So LOTR gives you a foundation of knowledge about certain important tales in the Silmarillion, so that you're even more prepared.  One other thing is that loving the Hobbit and LOTR books makes you invested in the world enough to search deeper in its history (although it sounds like you're very invested already)."

books,3dy66g,ChanklaChucker,2,Tue Jul 21 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"Don't worry bro (or sis?), Tolkien is not exactly reader friendly, even for people used to reading a lot. I think you picked a somewhat tough author for beginners. Children of Hurin and The Silmarillion are even worse, because they were never intended to the public, they are basically a huge compilation of Tolkien's reference material. I suggest you read The Hobbit, and then the Lord of the Rings trilogy, there's plenty that the movies don't cover (Peter Jackson basically destroyed Faramir, one of the coolest characters in the books), or maybe, if you'd like a change of pace:  If you like action, swordplay and vikings, try The Last Kingdom (The Warrior Chronicles, Book 1), from Bernard Cornwell. Its centered on the life of an english man during the viking era. Pretty cool, and epic too, while keeping things grounded on reality. The author, Bernard Cornwell, is the best at conveying action and fights. He'll keep you glued in your seat like Tolkien could never do (not that it makes it better or worse, its just a different thing). Maybe you're looking for something lighter, and still on the fantasy genre, so... Harry Potter. Seriously. The Philosophers Stone is what turned me, and millions of kids worldwide, into a reader. Its intended for kids, I guess (I read the first book when I was 11), its kinda short and a bit silly, but in a good way. Try just the first chapters, I bet you'll get hooked.  Theres also Ready Player One, by Ernest Cline, on a very different note than the other recommendations I made. Its pretty cool, the writer has good pacing. Plus its being adapted into film, directed by Steven Spielberg, probably gonna be a huge hit. If you read it now, you'll be able to tell your friends that you knew it before it was cool."

I think it applies to people who have just started reading more, but it's a pretty good philosophy nonetheless.   I have always been an avid reader, ever since I was a little kid reading the Chronicles of Narnia and the Goosebumps series. And I apologize if someone has already mentioned this, but if not, I hope you find it useful.   When I was in college, I read an article (I think it was Malcom Gladwell in the New Yorker, but don't quote me on that), where the author is talking about how important reading is. But he makes a point that what you are reading is not the most important thing. Even if you're reading the back of a cereal box, that's still good for you. And he said this, which completely changed my perspective: if you are reading a book that you are struggling with -- PUT IT DOWN. Just forget it and move on.   What happens is, you feel like you need to finish whatever book you're reading. But the problem is that you don't want to read it, so you keep putting it down, and eventually you just stop reading.   So, don't feel some real or imagined pressure to read this book or that. Even if the whole world thinks Moby Dick is the best book in there world, it's not worth it if it causes you to stop reading.   Anyway, good for you for starting to read. There's a whole world out there that you can now experience! My father didn't read a single book in his adult life until he retired, and by chance picked up a book by Lee Child in the Jack Reacher series that my mom and I read. He loved it so much, he went on to was the rest of the books in the series (15+ books), and he hasn't looked back!"

That being said, I still try not to let any book put me off other books from that genre or era.

I never read a book in school, including high school and college. I would usually pass by reading spark notes or asking my friends before tests and quizzes.    I'm not trying to be offensive, but this saddens me that someone just a bit younger than me has not read a book prior to this.

books,3dy66g,Questhook,2,Tue Jul 21 07:41:19 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as a bad reader. There is an inexperienced reader, which isn't the same thing. As you read more, if you decide to read more, you will find that parsing and retaining what you read will go much more quickly and well, and reading will become even more fun!  It's exactly the same with games - someone who is experienced with games and how they work can pick up Shadows of Mordor and play it almost automatically. There may be a control here or there that they need to look up, but in general, they know what's up. Someone who's never opened anything more advanced than Word will definitely not do as well.  I'm sure you are being overwhelmed by recommendations for your future reading exploits, but I want to add my two cents:  Since you seem to like fantasy, you could do worse than Robin Hobb. Her entire opus is a bit intimidating, but the books themselves aren't that long, and the story and writing is really amazing.

You just took your first step into the strange and wonderful world of books. A step you will not regret.  I read The Hobbit a few months ago myself, a wonderful book that I enjoyed immensely.   I found myself struggling to remember what I had just read. In fact, if you asked me right now to retell you the story in the book I'd have a difficult time and would probably only be able to give you a general outline of what happened.   I personally see that as something normal. You can't be expected to remember everything that happens in a book, especially a LOTR book. The good new is that with time you'll be able to remember more and more, all you have to do is keep reading.   I'm not a very good reader. I'll admit it.   Keep reading, you can only get better.   I am, however, surprisingly proud of myself for reading a book.   As you should, lots of people don't read. Where I live, a lot of young people see reading as a waste of time. They've been spoiled by movies and video games (I'm a big video game fan myself). They've become too lazy to imagine on their own, without the help of some artist or actor.  Congratulations once more and I hope to see more posts from you in the future. And don't forget to keep on reading.  P.S If you have an iPad, I suggest you download the Kindle app. It'll make your reading life a lot easier."

At 22, similar to you, I didn't want to read books (I did read for school); I preferred to believe I was living enough that I didn't need to read.  Then Life became too real and I started to withdraw.  Working full time and part time college was too much.  The term is burnout.  A friend that I admired at the time asked me if I had read LOTR.  When I said I'd never heard of it, he bashed me pretty good.  When I defended myself by saying I didn't need to read books, he pretty much reamed me a new one.  And on a dare, I bought the Hobbit.  Finished it in a bit over a day.  Bought the LOTR and finished them all the same week, still working full time.  Finished all four a second time through the next week.  All while working full time.  What I learned was manners do count, in all their forms, and the place I was in was not it.  My friend left town 'for good' he said on a Sunday eve.

I'm not a very good reader. I'll admit it. I am, however, surprisingly proud of myself for reading a book. This is something children do, which is a bit embarrassing   Eh.  Some people make it to 24 without ever having played a video game, watched a movie, played baseball, or seen more than half an episode of 5-season TV show.  Do you see them being embarrassed about it? Nope. So, as far as hobbies go: to each their own!       Memory and reading speed don't necessarily reflect on your reading ability. I have pretty poor recall once I've finished a book, too, and I've been reading my whole life. Reading speed can also be a function of wording and grammar, and of how much you let your mind wander around the story while you read (I do this a lot!) rather than focusing purely on consuming the next words on the page.  Reading's a very personal experience, much more so than watching a movie. Everyone experiences it at a different pace and takes away their own impressions from the story, the characters, even the structure and flow of the prose. You're not reading to ""beat"" the book but to enjoy your own experience and get lost in it, so just meander along at whatever pace suits you and lets you enjoy it the most.        I haven't read The Children of Hurin but I will add my voice to the chorus here in warning about the Silmarillion: it's much more in the style of a history text book than a novel. If you don't enjoy reading history text books... you'll probably find it isn't for you. (It wasn't for me: far too dry and heavy-going to finish, one of the very few books ever to beat my stubbornness.)  Heck, reward yourself and grab The Hobbit! It's much more entertaining and will give you insight into the world of LotR beyond the movie trilogy. And, of course, the LotR books themselves are absolutely worth the read too."

books,3e2459,dagwood111,4,Tue Jul 21 11:53:44 2015 UTC,"I give them ""Childhood's End"" by Arthur C. Clarke. It is my second favorite book (1st place goes to ""Speaker for the Dead"" by Orson Scott Card, but they would really need to read ""Ender's Game"" first, and I consider it to be the weaker of the two novels.) and it is a grand introduction to Science Fiction I think. It demonstrates the the philosophical and speculative nature of the genre, and it's an entertaining read even if you don't read very deeply into it's bigger themes. The ending is such a mind blow, that to this day I get a little freaked out when I reread it. It is the perfect example of what science fiction as a genre is, in my humble opinion."
books,3e2459,MatthewLoumin,2,Tue Jul 21 11:24:35 2015 UTC,"I was going to say either Fahrenheit 451 or Speaker for the Dead, actually! I haven't read any of Clarke's books, although I very nearly bought a signed copy of 2001 a few years back! Is his stuff hard to read?"
books,3e2459,SuperiorCoconut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:41:08 2015 UTC,"Naw, not for the most part. The concepts aren't that complicated so it's pretty accessible, but the worlds are so complex that there's plenty of substance.  Fahrenheit 451 is a strong 3rd. I've read that book at least ten times, sometimes three times in a row. It's short enough that I can read it in a day, which I love. Each time I read it I see something new or better understand something or just have a better appreciation for the work as a whole. The prose is entirely poetic and beautiful and heartbreaking and frightening all at the same time at some points.   Also, I haven't been able to talk to very many people who liked Speaker for the Dead. All of my friends loved Ender's Game but couldn't stomach Speaker because it wasn't about war, which I can respect. I tore through the Ender's Shadow series because of the strategic aspect."

I agree completely with you on Fahrenheit 451, it's mesmerising and almost hypnotic in the way it's told!  I loved Ender's game with a burning passion (read it in one sitting) so I have it written down to read the others, but the order of which are prequels/sequels can be confusing. I know Ender's Shadow is written from the perspective of a friend of his whose name escapes me right now, so at least I have that down ;)"
books,3e2459,SuperiorCoconut,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:08:07 2015 UTC,I find Childhood's End a bit too philosophical for first timers. For Clarke I would prefer Rendezvous with Rama.  Do Android Dream of Electric Sheep would also be a good choice if Childhood's End is a good choice.
books,3e2459,blackgranite,4,Tue Jul 21 13:33:40 2015 UTC,"Sometimes a high school English teacher here. I include a whole lot of genre fiction in my classes, in addition to the standard classics, mainly because the kids I teach typically have absolutely no interest in reading. Also, kids tend to finish genre books faster, allowing me to teach more novels/short stories/poetry. I absolutely hate teaching from a text book and refuse to do it. Genre fiction can break that automatic ""books suck"" attitude, and allow me to move from a SF novel to something like Gulliver's Travels or earlier genre works like Frankenstein, showing them the parallels and make it a bit more interesting for them.  I teach 9th-12th grade... books with more mature themes are typically only read senior year. I'll cop out and give you a few rather than one:   Ender's Game by Card  - Standard at this point for a lot of high schools. I read it in 9th grade. It's great at that age.  Gateway by Pohl - My favorite SF novel of all time. It's an only senior read, but not difficult to get through. There's a whole lot going on here, and I can easily introduce Freud, philosophical theories about time, and determinism when discussing it. Plus, it's entertaining as hell.  Casino Royal by Flemming - Senior read, usually. Book Bond is great, because he's completely different from what the kids expect given their experience of Movie Bond. There's a lot of nasty historical stuff about the USSR that we can get into for discussion here, as well as slowly letting them come to the revelation that no, James Bond isn't all that great of a guy.  Starship Troopers by Heinlein - If they know about it, they typically know it from the movie. This is a great, great novel about what it means to be a citizen, in addition to a lot of bug fights in power armor. I typically teach this to 9th graders after we've read Ender's Game, and also include some easy readings from ""The Republic"" and give some notes on Sparta.   A Clockwork Orange by Burgess  - Obviously seniors only. It's the language that interests me most here... if they've read 1984 or Brave New World, there's a lot we can discuss concerning both double-speak and the dating system (After Ford) of BNW. If not, power systems, the importance of culture, and general ""What the fuck?"" Sadly, I can't show them the movie where I teach... I'm stunned they let them read this.   So, it's heavy on the SF. I do teach a few other works, like ""The Quiet American"" and ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,"" as well. I know I'm cheating by giving you a list rather than one... but, I figured it might be interesting hearing from a teacher who does just that: teaches genre fiction, though as a way to access the humanities in a broader sense."

books,3e2459,Cockrocker,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:38 2015 UTC,"I think for fantasy I'd pick Mists of Avalon, it just wowed when I read it, is a fun reinterpretation of King Arthur lore, and isn't part of a series.  Sci-fi is super hard for me. I'm a fan of softer sci-fi so I lean on Ubik or The Stars My Destination. Both are just super fun stories that don't get caught up in the genre. People expect a lot of technobabble and shit, these are both very fast moving adventure stories. Philip K. Dick is an undisputed master, Alfred Bester lacks the recognition but I feel he should be up there.  Added: since Canada considers Canadian fiction a genre, I'd use Timothy Findley as an introduction to it, either Pilgrim or Famous Last Words which are my personal favourites of his."

Larry doesn't make great characters for the most part, and sci fi doesn't need them per se, but his imagination was top notch.  And imagination is key.  Such great nods to real science, and wonderous ideas of what could happen or what we could do with it.  ....and space.  Gotta have space in sci fi.  Fantasy - Name of the Wind, by Patrick Rothfuss.  I know KKC gets thrown around excessively on reddit, but I fully believe it to be the best fantasy.  Fantasy needs real memorable characters, and Pat did this in spades...and its not just the main character, but the minor people are also very well written.  Fantasy needs a comprehensive world.  People tend to love Tolkein for his worldbuilding...I think Pat did even better as you learn about the world from interactions....you don't need to read a Simarillion.  Fantasy needs magic, and Pat's magic is memorable.  Lastly, Fantasy needs (in my opinion) and underdog that rises to fame/power.  Afterall, who doesn't dream of becoming something more?  Something powerful?"

Levithan Wakes is also nice, in the sense that it spans near future (only Solar System), but again need to dive into cultural clashes you mentioned.  Scifi can either be a book about ideas of book about people, it makes it much more easier to create a series out of writing about cultural conflicts.

I used to be a serial book quitter, so now I have a personal rule against giving up on books just to avoid sliding back.

I guess what I am saying is that maybe we should take a step back and wonder why these books stood out to one of the most insightful minds of the 20th century rather than starting an intellectual hockey brawl about whether Ayn Rand sucks or not.

The problem with Rand is how she presents her argument in one long, drawn out example that in and of itself has a focused agenda to it.  Nietzsche breaks down altruism into selflessness which is not possible, but rather promotes a moral egoism. I see Rand trying for this but failing, so I still respect her writing.  I'm not entirely sure it needs to be on the high school curriculum, but I did not regret reading her.

Note HST doesn't actually recommend Atlas. Atlas shrugged felt like a philosophical treatise jammed into the mouth of a couple of unbelievable caricatures written by and for a teenager. The fountainhead was a more personal story about a brilliant but emotionally broken domestic terrorist who finds his twisted morals compel him to blow up hard work done to improve the lives of the needy. It was compelling and darkly fascinating to watch it all unfold and I completely understand why HST loved it. It was about a dark, evil, powerful man who was obsessed with owning ideas and his mind completely shatters when others use and share and develop them, even if for the best of causes. A cautionary tale about grasping too hard at things you truly don't own, and conflating your identity with your work."

All of these books give a different frame work for approaching an ideological problem. I'd even argue every great author gives you a different frame of reference to objectively approach framing your thought processes on a whole litany of issues, whether political or personal. You can't honestly approach any issue objectively until you can understand the different ways to approach it from a subjective sense. Basically what I'm saying is definitely read things you agree with but read things you disagree with more vigorously. Reading after all, is the free exchange of ideas in a very intimate medium. The intimacy of it helps, me at least, to understand different approaches to problem solving, idea debate, and conflict resolution on a much deeper level than just listening to politicians spouting party points or friends arguing why their ideas are more valid than mine. Also, this is just a difference of opinion, or interpretation, in a small portion of the enormous spectrum of ideology. For me, and I'm sure others, its all about reading and growing, and reading and growing, and reading and growing.  Edit: Grammars and spellings"

I've felt this way for awhile however, I wasn't able to express it in words that where meaningful and concise enough until after I kind of talked it out. I thought this was almost the perfect opportunity to post me ideas/conclusions about both challenging myself and broadening horizons. I feel like good authors have a special way of conveying their feelings towards a subject or an idea through pure allegory and emotion. I don't want to be told what's right and what's wrong, I want to come away from a good read with a better understanding of the things that lead people to perceive issues the way they do. If i can understand the driving forces behind ideologies I can then have better conversations with people I don't necessarily agree with. Sometimes, I even come away and have to reaccess how I approach things. I feel like you can't get that experience out of much else other than a good ink on paper novel. Sure biographies, autobiographies, and historical fiction/nonfiction is entertaining to read but, it's not really stimulating or thought challenging.

In regards to quality her vocabulary was superlatively(one of her favorite words) repetitive, which is not something I have noticed before.  I'm sure that comparatively she was a good author, books from that time were a different breed, but if Atlas Shrugged were written today I don't think it would have gotten away with being so ham fisted and retain it's popularity."

Atlas was unpleasant and it is easy to see how people get the wrong idea about her and her writings (be it industrialists proclaiming it to be the bible while accepting bailouts from the government, or liberal hipster kids denouncing it as poison).  I would further say that The Fountainhead transcends Rand herself whom I gather was somewhat frightful and absolutely non-adherent to her own philosophy, it is a true masterwork."

There's only one time I've ever burned a book, and it was in celebration. I was having a Harry Potter party and had converted my Grandparent's old barn into a Hogwarts. I had loads of broken-beyond-reading copies of the books picked up from Charity Shops, boot sales and such. I tea stained them and scattered them on the floor as a sort of bedding. At the end of the second night we gathered them up and had a bonfire while drinking butterbeer. :D"

Then begins s horribly out of place extremely right wing political rant. Then everyone gets magical amnesia. Then the other main character gets some torture.

""If you want to be a slave in life, then continue going around asking others to do for you. They will oblige, but you will find the price is your choices, your freedom, your life itself. They will do for you, and as a result you will be in bondage to them forever, having given your identity away for a paltry price. Then, and only then, you will be a nobody, a slave, because you yourself and nobody else made it so.""  and...  ""Life is the future, not the past. The past can teach us, through experience, how to accomplish things in the future, comfort us with cherished memories, and provide the foundation of what has already been accomplished. But only the future holds life. To live in the past is to embrace what is dead. To live life to its fullest, each day must be created a new.""  and...  ""You don't have any idea what love really is. You can't love anyone or anything until you love your own existence, first. Love can only grow out of a respect for your own life. When you love yourself, your own existence, then you love someone who can enhance your existence, share it with you, and make it more pleasurable. When you hate yourself and believe your existence is evil, then you can only hate, you can only experience the shell of love, that longing for something good, but you have nothing to base it in but hatred."""

I remember his response was something like he didn't truly know so he couldn't tell them. I was just glad this series ended far better than some of his other works.

books,3e2y4m,georgiespies12,4,Tue Jul 21 15:36:30 2015 UTC,"Hi! I think I might take a stab at answering this. Now I've only read The Road and Blood Meridian by McCarthy, but I've also been struck by his tendency to write about dead babies. I'd like to suggest that the reasons for this are both to provide a gut-wrenching, visceral (slightly unrealistic) landscape, and to provide symbolic imagery in support of his driving themes  The tree of dead babies in meridian is a perfect example to work from. First, it's important to realize that the drive with this image is most likely NOT realism. However, if I remember right, it's implied that this may have been the work of Native Americans who are shown later in the book to be extremely brutal. For purposes of the book, though, I'd say this image gives a definite and grotesque element to the landscape of Meridian's America. In this hyper-realistic setting, trees of dead babies are just as real as the stunning landscapes. This is important to think about in a novel about america, and gives you a tangible insight into the brutality of early expansion.  Now symbolically, a dead baby can say a lot. Babies are directly symbolic of so many things: youth, purity, innocence, preservation of the species etc. So to kill a baby (or a tree of babies) is to eliminate these benign symbolic pieces. You can come to your own reading, but in Meridian, I see this as a symbol of the decay of the morality present during early westward expansion. The Wild West of scalping and brutality is a betrayal of the legal and ethical code (debatable if this existed) of the early settlers of eastern u.s. These are men betraying their roots, so an image of dead babies is very interesting.   I hope that gave an idea. Maybe McCarthy just hates babies. Not sure really lol"
books,3e2y4m,Deus_Fax_Machina,2,Tue Jul 21 15:56:19 2015 UTC,I found this to be a very compelling read; thank you for your thoughtful contribution.  That the point was not realism certainly puts things in a different light and makes a lot of sense in the context that the book is an homage to Moby Dick.
books,3e2y4m,doktorgonzo,3,Tue Jul 21 15:59:11 2015 UTC,"I dunno, his books are grotesque by nature. I don't think the babies are any more grotesque than the adults in his stories- you just aren't as used to seeing them that way. Also, his books are meant to plumb the depths, and the killing of innocent children is one of the darkest lows humanity has historically sunk to. Many of his books, especially Blood Meridian, are rooted in actual historical events, so while I can't confirm the tree of dead babies was real, I wouldn't be so quick to call it unrealistic.  I can see an argument being made for it being excessive, but I think it works well in some books of his, like Outer Dark."

books,3e2y4m,the_ragamuffin,3,Tue Jul 21 16:51:28 2015 UTC,"Great rant. You asked for a rebuttal...   I think that you put the moral responsibility on the author and not the characters in a work of fiction is your first mistake. You're the first person I know that ever interpreted these books as the author's personal war on babies. You made another gross error by assuming all the babies would be the same age/size/placed at the same time on the mentioned tree.  IIRC it was depicted as a warning in the book. Irregardless its symbolically valid in the apocalyptic atmosphere of the work. I completely understand how some people might not enjoy this kind of art, but at least understand what you're looking at. Having real life baby raising experience, babies are fussy (loud), require constant attention and food, and get ill easily (esp without antibiotics).  Having them die in those setting is believable. I've read babies were subject to being killed on the Underground Railroad if they weren't quiet.  Babies have always historically been killed by their mothers for convenience. Or by attackers-its in the Bible. Eating babies... Again you assume. I imagine eating a baby that died is a logical insanity in that world. Not only that but thinning the herd is well established as a human practice when resources are limited. Neil Gaiman references this in American Gods. Your problem with Spanish illustrates you're a lazy reader or you are too demanding.  Look it up with google, guess using context clues, or skip over it an move on. There is no rule you have to understand everything in a book.  Otherwise, why read at all?  If you want to be spoon fed try something lighter."
books,3e2y4m,doktorgonzo,3,Tue Jul 21 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"Is ANY of this baby killing necessary? Does it ever add?   It solidifies the gruesomeness and grotesqueness of the worlds he sets his books in. It creates a visceral response in the reader, as evidenced by your disgusted reaction.   Or is it just a cheap parlor trick he thinks he’s entitled to in the same way he’s entitled to write pages upon pages of Spanish with no translation?   He is entitled to that. It's his book. He is fully entitled to write whatever he likes. You don't have to read it.   Or in the same way he has the right to look down his nose at authors who deal with issues of life and death   Source?   (I’d NEVER describe his work as that… I mean, no one EVER DIES in his books, right?)   Book featuring death =/= book about death.   I don’t get it. And beyond the baby killing, what’s with the absolute venom he uses when describing said babies? I mean, one could argue that’s Lester talking when he describes the baby as a “drooling little monster,”   You answered your own question.   but let’s be real here, he underlines that this is what he really thinks by giving this baby supernatural coordination so he can capture a robin and rip its legs off with his mouth…   One baby doing a bad thing means he thinks all babies are that way? His books are full of people doing horrible things, why single that specific instance out?   You ever tried to catch a bird with your hands before? It’s almost impossible… no baby that is still drooling on itself is capable of that kind of magic.   Isn't the robin given to the child by Lester?   Which brings up my next point… Why is this guy lauded as the greatest of our time when he writes all these totally implausible scenarios? A TREE of dead babies…how many babies were surviving in a small settlement during that time period? Surely not enough to decorate a tree with!   Source or this is a meaningless statement.   Here’s another: in a post-apocalyptic society, there would be not medical services. Maternal and infant death rates would skyrocket.   Correct.   If a baby DID manage to make it out unscathed, we wouldn’t barbeque it! It’s too precious! A mother’s body is built to feed that baby during famine regardless of how hungry she is... If the mother is dead, a woman can actually start lactation by repeated attempts to feed the child… There is NO REASON to believe we would be eating babies.    Here's a list of recorded times people have turned to cannibalism.   Dogs and even adults make more sense.   Why? People don't fight back. Dogs are useful as guards and hunters. Babies serve no purpose in a post-apocalyptic world when your own survival is all you care about. They are loud and require constant taking care of. The people eating babies in The Road are doing it because they have no connection to the babies they're eating - they have their captives birth them, then they eat them. It's a purely utilitarian relationship, used to show the darkness and evil the people in the world of The Road have descended to in order to survive.   It seems (brace yourself) SLOPPY.   No it doesn't.   Just like the lack of proper punctuation seems LAZY (Please don’t jump in with that oral tradition argument, the man himself says “[There’s no reason to clutter up the page with a bunch of stupid dots]”… He doesn’t even try to defend himself reasonably like his fans do).   It's the style he writes in because he likes that style. If you don't, don't read it or listen to an audiobook version.   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. This is what the protagonist would hear as he would hear it, but the point of fiction isn’t to be a faithful record… it never actually happened, so there is no way for it to be a faithful record… the point of fiction is to be read, and if we can’t comprehend what we’re reading, then the point is missed. The story is lost.   The book is written from the point of view of the main character. That's the point - it's a fixed perspective. We see and hear what he sees and hears. The character doesn't understand, so we don't understand. To translate would completely break from the style of the book and we would lose all immersion. This doesn't take from the story, it adds to it by increasing our understanding of, and empathy with, the main character. McCarthy is not the only author to do this, nor should he be.   Am I crazy here? Can someone write a good rebuttal as to why we need a dead baby to make a good Cormac McCarthy novel?   Hope you enjoyed your rebuttal."

I don't understand how showing babies dying is evidence that the writer thinks his audience is easy to manipulate. Are you saying that baby deaths aren't visceral and upsetting..?

I couldn't find the whole scene online, but I did find this, which says that the bird is given to the child, and then the adults leave and come back later to find that the girl has bitten the legs off to stop the bird from escaping. I fail to see how this is impossible.   In response to your section about the Road: Does it make any sense to have a farm of ""animals"" that have a gestation period of 9 months? Absolutely not. A baby will feed you for how many days, sir? I'm sorry, you've failed to convince me that this makes any sense.   This would be a valid complaint if the book were set in anything like our world, but it's not. The world of The Road, there aren't any farm animals. Even birds are rare. The cannibals are, for want of a better word, making the best of the situation they're in. One group resorts to captive adults as a food source, another uses a group of captured women as a renewable source. You're right, it won't feed them for long. That's the point. They're doing what they have to in order to survive.   Telling me I don't have to read things and that I'm wrong isn't a rebuttal   Telling you you're wrong is the definition of a rebuttal, so long as I also provide arguments - which I have done, twice now."

I don't think it's that clear-cut in the novel. It's on page 251 and the line starts with 'Her voice was heavy with sarcasm: ""We've agreed that they're backward...' So yeah, heavy with sarcasm.   Also I disagree with this line:   She claims to be color blind, but makes only the barest of attempts to communicate with her old maid Calpurnia.   I thought that scene was one of the most emotional in the book, she basically breaks down in front of Calpurnia when she realizes the racial divide that is separating them."

I agree some of the sentences run on way too long and I didn't particularly care for the character descriptions, as I felt the writer over-explained character traits that didn't really have any effect on the character at all. I also paid little attention to the astrological themes of the book (aside from the one element that becomes a pretty big plot point). That being said, I though the setting, dialogue and intricate storylines were fantastic. It felt like I was reading a very well-made HBO miniseries. I would recommend trudging through as the chapters get shorter and the stories more gripping as the book ends. Every little detail gets explained and unfolds in a very clever way. If you're not going to finish it now, you probably never will, since it's a hard book to get back into if you put it away. Of course if it's not for you, it's simply not for you. I thought it was a great and ambitious novel despite its minor problems."

Throw in any side points that you might be trying to make ie. a connection beyond the work, case in point about trouble grammatically, how it shaped your expectations for books to come and made you think about ones behind.  Then a recommendation statement as detailed as you think the book deserves.  Another thing you might want to include are content warnings if you feel it requires them, though personally I don't find those super important considering in many cases you know what you're getting into.  One thing that plagues those sites is the prevalence of gif-heavy reviews, so if you want to draw people of a certain but very vocal ilk to your reviews you can use gifs and images to portray emotions that might be far harder to phrase.  Personally I don't have a problem with them but in doing so you open your reviews up to the people who don't like them and so on and so forth with other stylistic choices.  In the end the main point I'd harp on is to be descriptive without giving too much away, you don't want to write a 3 line review that looks like it could easily be robot generated but you also don't want to give away important plot points without usage of the spoiler tag.  I have been attempting to write better reviews myself, and it feels thus far that at some point I'll cross over into doing it, but until then what I've been trying to do is give as complete a view as possible without going over any personal boundaries I've laid out for myself."

The new Richard Howard translation: ""'If I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked,' the little prince said to himself, 'I'd walk very slowly toward a water fountain.'"""

books,3dxzaq,frecklyface,4,Tue Jul 21 03:52:13 2015 UTC,"Here's another example, this time the most famous quote from the book. This is a fragment from another Amazon review that describes exactly why the new translation loses all the charm of the original French. Very sad that this ""streamlining"" is common in many new translations...    Katherine Woods' translation reads: ""It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."" She uses the beautiful rhetorical mode: ""What is essential..."" In the original French: ""...on ne voit bien qu'avec le coeur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux."" In English, ""l'essentiel"" might be rendered ""the essential things"" or be put, as Woods does, in the rhetorical form: ""What is essential...""  Howard's ""new"" translation of the same line reads: ""One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes."" Huh? ""Anything essential is invisible to the eyes""? Far from expressing Antoine de Saint Exupéry's meaning, this generalization means, in effect, nothing. And it is obviously not true: Water is essential, and you can see it (more or less).  Katherine Woods' exquisite translation captures the essence of this line: ""It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."" Quintessential, no line in the book is more important. It epitomizes her entire translation. (Woods employs the poetic English idiom ""eye"" for ""les yeux"", a superior choice of wording.) It is ironic that, in translating The Little Prince, Richard Howard should lose ""that which is essential"" and that he should be unable to ""see with his heart."""

The best starting point on Polish history from an English-speaking writer.    Fun reads by Polish authors without connection to Polish history:  On the Silver Globe by Jerzy Zulawski - part of ""The Lunar Trilogy"". I am a fan of sci-fi so I couldn't leave this one out. A tough one, very demanding but very rewarding. It's a story building on Verne's idea about shooting people to the moon from a fuck-off cannon.  Only instead of adventures we get Dune over 50 years before Herbert (written in 1900's, even before WW1). Really mind-blowing stuff. Shook me as a kid even though I had trouble understanding it properly. It's very little known but it's a gem. Turn of 19th and 20th centuries.  Solaris by Stanislaw Lem - a sci-fi classic. If you like it try his other books and for a lot of fun try the Cyberiad which is sci-fi done in  something resembling Terry Pratchett's or Douglas Adams' style. Unfortunately you do need a good translation since it's very fairy-tale-ish and heavy on crazy neologisms. Trurl and Klapaucjusz rule! 2nd half 20th century.  Ferdydurke by Gombrowicz - a very meta-heavy and all around great book. Might also be seriously nerfed by a poor translation.2nd half 20th century.  Anything by Slawomir Mrozek if you are heavy on absurdist humour - he's most known as a dramatist but his short stories are also awesome.Good translations required. 20th century  Pharaoh by Boleslaw Prus - a very good (even by today's standards) novel on Ancient Egypt with a lot of insights into the social and political stuff. If you like to find out what Polish Dickens' would be like try his The Doll - also great if not for everyone. Obviously mid 19th century.  The Witcher - by Andrzej Sapkowski - because you have to know what the whole noise is really about. Start with short stories as they are much better than the saga. Shame about the early translations though since they lacked a lot of the cultural context (not an easy thing to get right). Suprisingly smart for purely commercial stuff - early late 80s and 90s.  The Deluge a pop-historical novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz set in XVII century back when Poland could into space, if you are into finding out about where some of the ridiculous Polish traditions come from. Might be not your cup of tea but you'll understand Poles (and other Slavs) a bit better. Mid 19th century - under Russian/Prussian/Austrian occupation.  I can't recommend a lot of modern Polish literature because I haven't been in touch for a long time and media promote typically politically biased (left or right) pretentious crap. Perhaps someone can help out here.  FYI Joseph Conrad the author of The Heart of Darkness was a British citizen who nevertheless always considered himself Polish and was very active culturally and politically."

''Dervish and death'' is my favorite of these three. Andric is great, but Selimovic is my favorite Serbian writer. There's just something beautiful in his  writting style, inner world of protagonist will drive you in more then overall plot.  ''Migrations'' shouldn't be overlooked either.

His 'Buddha's Little Finger' (English translation, in Russian, it's actually called 'Chapaev and the Void') is one of my favorites but may have too many cultural meta references that will probably escape the average non-Russian reader."

In particular, the first shows the impossibility of being somebody different (it's packed with philosophy, it's an intense read but also entertaining), the second is more satirical and focuses on what it means to be impotent in a society obsessed with sex and virility."

Since people upvote things they agree with, which in threads like this means books they know and like, books that are popular mainly in other languages/countries sink to the bottom, while American/British/etc. books rise to the top of the thread.  There's nothing wrong with that, but I appreciate threads like this, because there's a higher chance to find something new and exciting. If the thread was ""open"" to American lit, the top posts would probably be things like The Great Gatsby, Mark Twain and others simply because a lot of redditors know them.  And yes, translations of books that were originally published in English are very prevalent in many countries.

His writing can be very verbose and he is an author I would put in the ""not afraid of description"" category.  Some authors can do it without dulling the book down, and SK is one who can do that 8/10 times.  Some of the books I particularly loved (this is a hard list as I really love most of his work):  Gunslinger Series  The Stand  It  The Eyes of the Dragon  Night Shift (short stories)  Skeleton Crew (short stories)   The Green Mile  One thing I especially love about him is how he weaves other characters or themes throughout his other novels.  If you have read a lot of King, you will find things pop up in other books as well.  It isn't needed, but it is something fun for those who have read the books."

books,3e2jae,Ciaran1892,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:41 2015 UTC,"Most of his novels are ""normal"" horror/modern fantasy for about 200 pages then the last 200 pages are usually off-the-rails crazy. Also, violence is an art form for him. Very graphic but I think it comes from his gift of visualizing scenes with such detail and depicting so well the emotional response of characters to what they see and endure.  He uses a lot of words, very wordy, but his descriptions of setting and character are worth it. Sometimes he plays into religious stereotypes that are not authentic, but as a Christian believer, instead of being offended, I take it as ""this is how others sometimes see us"" so be better than this. I think he is a spiritual person, and he has keen insights to spirituality even if I don't always agree with him. He does get the idea of a spiritual realm or ""excluded middle"" zone, though.   He deals with the concepts of fate and chance and the struggle between the two. The novel Insomnia is a great example. A good example of descriptive setting is 11/22/63. For character development, Under the Dome, lots of unique and engaging characters to track.   I haven't read all of his novels and short stories so there may be better examples out there."

As an author, once I have that, once I have people telling me how much the love a character, I don't want to let it go.   But, the story dictates where the story goes. It may sound weird, but I don't really make those decisions on who dies. If you write about violent situations, sometimes the only logical outcome of a plot thread is injury or death. The thing I think I do well is that I don't have convenient escapes for my characters, and I never bring them back from the dead. I think it's an easy emotional ploy to ""kill"" characters only to bring them back to life again, so I don't do that (but bringing them back as zombies or other undead is a whole different thing ...)."

The scariest part about staring at the blank screen is knowing how much emotional turmoil awaits me. I never have a shortage of ideas (in fact, I have so many that they screw up my projects because I always want to start something new). When I start, though, I have enough experience to know what's coming — months of doubt, self-sabotage, anxiety, and the absolutely shitty feeling that comes when you realize the 10,000 words you wrote for a particular plot line no longer apply, and they have to be cut. That's the worst part. It's like saying ""Hey, know those two weeks you spent crafting that piece of the story that you absolutely love? Well, those are gone, and that time was mostly wasted. Have a nice day!""  I pour all of me into every book I write. I want it to be the best it can be for the readers. If I'm asking for your money — or even your time if you only do the free stuff — it has to be top-notch. I can't take shortcuts, and I die a little every time I see mistakes make it to the end reader. It's hard to do this. Best job in the world (since I don't look like LeBron, I mean), but it takes chunks out of your soul to create these stories and bring them through the full editorial process."
books,3dy3y5,aurawn,3,Mon Jul 20 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I totally feel that way when I start a piece. I guess it's why I gravitate towards writing short stories. I can finish a rough draft in a sitting or two (or three, or four) and then strictly focus on editing/improving certain sections.   I have so many novel starts where I can't figure out where the characters will go or what comes next. I've read so many books about the creative process that explain how good writers will let their characters guide the story. I find that with short stories I can pinpoint better turning points within the characters journey. While, on the other hand, when I begin a novel, the anxiety and self doubt of where the story is headed makes me want to give up.   Thanks for expressing your feelings when writing."

Which character is the most similar to the real me? Hmmmm. The tenacity of Quentin Barnes is something I have, and is the reason for any level of success I've attained. Once I lock my jaws on something, I simply do not quit. Even if I fail at that goal — and I often do — that failure will never come because I didn't work hard enough to win.   I think I'm also similar to Pookie. He likes everyone, tries to be nice to everyone, tries to make everyone feel welcome and special. However, his quick, rapier wit is just fantasy fulfillment for me — I wish I could do what he does. He feels very real, like a guy we'd all want to go get beers with.   And finally, perhaps Em from ALIVE. So much of my writing career has come from operating in areas where there are no rules, no structure, new technologies that no one has utilized yet. I'm pretty good at saying ""Screw it, we'll figure it out as we go"" and diving in. That's what Em is like in ALIVE. There is no leader, no structure, no law, so she does the best she can to step into that void and help her people survive. It's a stretch of a connection, for sure, but it feels like me."

The whole back story and timelines of it seem so fascinating.    Is there any chance you'll write a book or series set in the more 'near future' that details the various wars and eventual Kreterakian takeover?

This is actually how I started my career and got my “big break.” In March 2005, I started giving away EARTHCORE as a serialized audiobook. The audience grew over three more books, and when we put out a paperback of ANCESTOR in 2007, it hit #1 on Amazon in Scifi and Horror. And that was before Amazon was even selling eBooks, so it was an apples-to-apples comparison to the big New York publishing books that were out then. That happened because of the audience who listened for free deciding to support my work by buying the book. Random House saw that, made an offer, and the rest is history."

It frustrates me at first, but eventually I'm happy with it because that means the characters are more realistic than the thin versions I initially conceive.

It's like watching a movie when I read a book. I don't care that much if I remember it all, I'm enjoying the experience as I get sucked deeper and deeper into the world I'm reading about.  If you want to understand what you're reading? Try reading out loud at least one paragraph a chapter. I find this really increases my focus on the fact that I need to go over EVERY word. You don't skip words when you read out loud, but you might be skipping words when you just read in your head. Even just reading maybe 10% of the time out loud (but fairly regularly during your reading sessions) really helps you focus in on the text."

books,3e1wn9,drummmergeorge,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:15:27 2015 UTC,"I think it is first important to acknowledge the semi-autobiographical nature of the book, whilst distinguishing it as a work of literacy on its own (although it does nicely fill in the missing gaps in her journals). It is important to note the parallels between the two characters. They are both high achievers, perfectionists and successful. Both of them independent young women. I would argue that while Ester is repulsed and critical of the society and influences around her, Joan is impressionable but tormented by her inability to fit in however much she tries to echo the stereotypical 50s women. Ester is tormented by the very expectations of the society and not wanting to fit in. Joan died by hanging (if I remember it is implied) - she sees not future resulting from her human condition; she is a victim of society. Ester on the other hand although admittedly defeated, is liberated by her own indepedance (ironically what she envied in Joan) and her self confidence now placed in herself rather than the expectations of society. The bell jar is lifted as she steps into the room at the end.  Plath killed herself a month after its publication. I'd advise reading up on her life, and her poetry (paticuarly the collection 'Ariel') to understand the context and themes of the book better."

books,3e1phy,pithyretort,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:30:41 2015 UTC,"Speaking from the US here, but library cards are supposed to expire. They are free for local residents (usually county) and have a fee for non-residents. This is because local taxes fund them so it should be free to the ones who already paid. By expiring cards, it forces people to go renew them (usually every 3-5 years) to prove they are still residents and help the county gauge interest for funding. Here in the US, you would not be allowed to get your own card until you turn 18, but could be added to an adult's card before then. This is because it's a contract with rules governing late fees and appropriate usage and legally speaking, only people 18 or older can sign contracts.   I personally had to renew my card last summer and it consisted of ""Have you moved since last time? No? Okay, you're good for another 5 years."" It took 10 seconds.

According to this article by wired, libraries had to pay 78 dollars for an ebook copy of The Cuckoo's Calling, whereas a physical copy would have cost them 14.40. Publishers ask enormous amounts of money for an ebook, because their reasoning is, the ebook never degrades, so the library will never buy another copy. On top of that, some publishers put a limit on the amount of times a book can be lent, before the library has to buy a new copy. Basically publishers put a lot of restrictions on the lending abilities of libraries with regards to ebooks. That's why libraries don't have unlimited amounts of ebooks."

Unlike pretty much every other publisher out there, you'd have to download the file to a PC and move it over a USB cable.

books,3dvm1m,YourPassportNumber,6,Mon Jul 20 07:25:50 2015 UTC,"No, because then you would be a not so good citizen by breaking the law and depriving the author, editor, designer and printer of the book from the just reward for the work they did to entertain and educate you.   On top of that, because you are no longer a member of your library, the argument could be made that the library should receive less money because nobody uses the library any more these days. Which would cause the library to be less capable of buying the books that members want to read, which will mean that the library will have fewer members because everybody will be pirating or, you know, buying the books legally, which will most likely mean that the library will receive less money, which will cause fewer members, which will mean the library gets less money, etc etc etc. I think you get the point by now.

Currently funding is at about just enough, if you got paid 1 cent per loan then a release like harry potter would cost the library millions per book, while most of their budget is in thousands.

If you solve the problem by giving the author a payment every time the book is borrowed, a library will never know how much they will spend when they offer a book in their catalogue. Basically you are shifting all the risk of costs to the library. No library (or any well-run company) would accept those risks of costs if there is not also a reward connected to those risks. For a library there isn't, because they don't get funded by the amount of borrows in their library.   That the system that you have described doesn't work can be seen when you look at the various ebook subscription companies. Scribd recently announced that they had to change the books on offer, because members were reading too much. Scribd pays publishers on a pay-per-borrow basis for a large part of their catalogue, and it simply wasn't sustainable.   There are definitely problems with the current system, but a pay-per-borrow is not the solution either. Not sure what is..."

The libraries and vendors don't choose the lending model for titles (one copy/one user, cost per circulation, etc.)- the publishers do. Publishers only offer their titles in digital formats because they can make money like they can the physical version. If publishers gave away one copy of a book that never got lost or damaged and 1000s were reading it at once they'd make no money and neither would the authors. There are various models like simultaneous use and cost per circ that allow multiple ppl to read one copy but at the end of the day the publishers are the ones who select how to make their titles available as well as the pricing models. It's important to remember that the service is free to library users and so, while it is digital, it's better to think of these books like the physical library books. You may have to wait but you aren't paying for the right to read it. If you'd rather not wait then of course you can always pay to purchase the title."

What he actually said was,   If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generation of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis that all things are made of atoms — little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.   I see what you are saying, and I agree that a sentence about germ theory would also be very important - but if the atom sentence is undermined without a definition of an atom, the phrasing of the germ sentence is worse.   What qualifies 'filth'? Bacteria (which are not animals) do not live just in filth. The big revelation of germ theory is that something may be contaminated with bacteria despite appearing (looking, smelling) 'clean'.   What qualifies sickness? That sentence does not explain parasitic diseases (likely to be far more prevalent in a post-apocalyptic society than now), viral diseases, or hereditary diseases (or prion diseases, or syndromes caused by diet, and so on).   I think what we're coming up against here is that it is hard to fit all the information you would want into one sentence ;). Feynman's point was that from atomic theory you can infer a lot about the rest of physics."

I used ""filth"" because if you consider it to be filthy, then there's a good chance bacteria are living in it. Yes, there are bacteria in even places that appear clean, but a pre-renaissance society likely won't be able to do anything about that even if they knew.  I used ""sickness"" because honestly there's little harm in improving your sanitation, even if you're not suffering from something caused by infection. A word like ""infection"" would mean nothing, so there's no point in elaborating further.  Ultimately, my point is that basic information about hygiene and medicine would be far more useful, if we're starting from square 1, than knowing about atoms would be - especially in terms of ability to apply the information."

Chuck Palahniuk originally turned in Invisible Monsters to his publishers and they rejected it, saying it was too disturbing.  In response, he wrote Fight Club, intentionally trying to be even more shocking and disturbing.  Originally, Fight Club was a short story published in 1995, but he expanded it to a novel in 1996.  The short story is now chapter 6 in the novel if you care to read what it originally was.  I agree, it seems like he does try really hard to disturb you.

They're our hyperidealized selves not just in raw power but in terms of morality as well. Which is why the premise of Civil War is so appealing, it deals with the reality that our society has more than one moral ideal."
books,3dtht2,RatchetBro,48,Sun Jul 19 15:07:59 2015 UTC,"I thought Civil War was completely ruined, even though the premise could be good. Instead of presenting the two sides as both having real points, they turned it so the pro-reg people were basically totally wrong and overreaching and willing to violate their own morality while the anti-reg people were the clear heroes.   It's doubly annoying because the pro-reg people are obviously right: in the real world, we wouldn't want private citizens with no regulation to be using superpowers in public like that... just like we don't allow any random citizen to purchase tanks, bazookas, and nuclear bombs. It takes a lot of narrative twisting to make people who are against registering what are essentially nuclear bombs held in private hands into heroes."

I don't think he is at all blind to the idea of wanting to be the superhero - Watchmen for instance is all about the people who wanted to be superheroes, not about people who wanted superheroes to save them.  In reality, the really big, systemic problems and the giant geopolitical and economic problems are too big and complex for individualistic saving. To the extent that superheroes can influence these big social issues, they do so by imposing their own view of what the solution to the social question should look like. And that's essentially fascism.  His point was not just that people want superheroes to come and save them (though, especially with Doctor Manhattan, that is clearly part of his point), but that the desire to be a superhero doesn't just entail a desire for the power to save people, but a desire for the power to determine who needs ""saving"" and how."

Take the last avengers. Tony Stark tries to play god with a machine defense system, and ends up causing the deaths of thousands and almost the destruction of life on earth. Not only does he not actually, I dunno, get sent to jail for life or suffer any kind of punishment he saves the day by... playing god by making a superpowered machine. He literally saves the day the same way he threatens the day.   Same movie: Hulk goes crazy and does massive damage, probably killing many. We see him sulking and feeling bad about it, but he again isn't imprisoned or hidden away from society to stop him constantly killing people. (I know the movies don't show him killing exactly, but if you are smashing over buildings then people are dying).   Batman hacks everyone's cellphones, suffers no punishment for it. so on and so forth. The good guys ""learn a lesson"" but never get punished. That's part of the fantasy."

Superheros are at their core vigilantes: people who illegally fight crime outside of official channels. They break and enter, assault people, and do lots of other things that legal law enforcers are not supposed to do. But the idea is that since they are ""good"" and have good motives, it's cool that they constantly break the law.   But it goes beyond just that. Every psychic character violates not just the minds of evil villains but also, at some point, heroes/friends/family in order to save the day. Every tech genius type violates privacy and hacks into databases to save the day. You can go to Cracked.com types sites and see tons of lists of ""insane punishments by Superheroes"" where they do really messed up things to supervillains that would certainly violate our ethical standards if a police officer did them.   etc.   Superheroes embody the ""end justifies the means"" ideal."

Not only is the individual paramount, but only 'special', gifted individuals have any real ability to effect change in the DC/Marvel universes.  This mirrors how the comics books have been written for decades.    It's an interesting thing to watch.  You have the prevailing ideological norm reflected in this overwhelmingly popular pop culture phenomenon - one that's existed since the fifties but only caught the mainstream imagination now.   For me, I'm just... tired.  These movies have taken up so much space in our culture and I can't understand how the millennials can sustain this relentless enthusiasm for them.  Moreover, the actual comic book industry isn't doing significantly better than it was in the late 90s.

Of course, you can enjoy these films anyway and just ignore those readings, but they're still there.

But these are just degrees. One of the things that makes Bruce Wayne a rather interesting character is that, at the end of the day, he is just as fucked up as any of the people that he goes up against.

Edit: That said, you can of course like something without agreeing with its ideology. I just bristle when people get defensive over this type of analysis, and try to say that its all ""overthinking"" and pointing out things that arent ""really there"". I mean, how could something possibly be ""just Batman""? If dudes are dressing up as animals in the name of justice, something just a little fucking weird has to be going on.

And on a deeper level, as Moore points out, it can also lead to this psychological state of helplessness where you become less self reliant, and more dependent on some other more powerful entity to solve your problems for you.   I don't think he's saying that millennials are bad, the reality is that marketing being what it is, you guys had no choice but to accept what is thrust upon you, especially at a younger age. What 8-10 year old would not like Batman?  But the problem is that by having this art form that is decades old thrust upon you again, for the profit of the older generations, it prevents you from shaping your own cultural values that may be different from superhero worship.   If you break it down by looking at something like Campbell's 'Hero With a Thousand Faces', most tales like this follow a similar narrative in terms of overall structure. So as you said, you ""care about the character that has been developed, not that they're super powered"".  So I think Moore is saying that you can have those same tales in which the hero is faced with similar challenges to his personality, ethics, morality, without it having to be placed in a superhero setting, that your generation can tell tales of the issues and values important to it, without relying on techniques at least 3 generations old."

books,3dtht2,Iamnothereorthere,49,Sun Jul 19 16:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yet... that's an incredibly lazy reading of why people ""just like"" things. Moore's point is that all superheroes valorize the virtues of the self-motivated individual, and, arguably, the soldier. Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk, Batman, etc etc etc, are just (rich/not-poor) soldiers.  This doesn't limit people's enjoyment of the movie in terms of entertainment value, or complex characterization, but it also helps explain some of its mega-popularity right now. I like some of the Batman movies, but I hate his character. This is not to say I hate his characterization, just that his character is nothing to valorize or relate to, and not deserving of any kind of empathy. His version of saving the world is yet another appeal to authoritarianism.   For the same reasons, I don't like most of the Marvel movies because I'm not interested in the moralizing of rich soldiers and scientists working on weaponizing themselves or others to perpetuate the narrative that the soldier is a necessary evil. The movies are never about anything else. They always circle around the concept of developing, and then being forced to contend with, some kind of weapon. Iron Man and his army of weapons needs to stop other weapons, and limit the weaponizing of his suit (as though that weren't the case already? Stark isn't denying the military industrial complex, he is the M-I-C). Captain America movies are all about some super weapon or military-like structure working in whatever kind of way so that the soldier can come in and save the world. And it goes on and on and on.   It's literally always the same fucking thing thinly veiled by yet another tired origin story about murder, or being weaponized, or weapons testing gone amok. From that the soldier emerges, the soldier encounters the same narratives about weapons, and then the soldier saves the world with whatever weapon they have to use against the other one. To my mind, there's nothing to like, relate to, or accept about any of these stories.   And so I don't think its insane popularity is so easily explained by people liking the characterization, or the comics. Because seriously, every fucking Marvel and DC movie is the exact same thing minus the trite details of whether or not the villain was good enough to satisfy whatever. So I think there's a claim to be made that while you (and others) may not ""care about"" or agree with the right wing, ultraconservative, neoliberal, entrepreneurial self-driven individualism, you most definitely sympathize with its narratives and heroes. So what does that say when you broaden the view to culture more generally when these are its heroes making billions and billions of dollars?"

Dude, supermen have popular for millenia.  Consider the Norse Gods, Beowulf, Hercules, etc.  None of this is new.  I love Moore but he can be an insufferable pretentious jackass at times.  This is one of them."
books,3dtht2,K3wp,56,Sun Jul 19 14:05:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, the essential idea of people with superhuman powers has been around for millennia, but there are very important differences between different incarnations. Indeed, almost all of the things that Moore and others are complaining about are unique to modern superheroes. I'll give a few examples of important differences to illustrate this, using Greek classical heroes as a counterpoint because that's what I'm familiar with:   Classical heroes are ultimately subject to the will of the gods and fate. This is not remotely trivial, but is instrumental to how the stories work: as an example, a large portion of the narrative of Homer is given over to the actions of the gods, and most of the great feats accomplished by the heroes are due to the aid of a god. This hugely diminished the Rand-esque undertones of the whole thing, as the heroes are no longer special just because of how fantastic people they are, but because of the favour of the gods, and hence the implied ideology changes radically: the message changes from ""talented individuals are extremely important and should be given free reign to exercise their brilliance"" to ""the will of the gods is very important and man should show due deference to the gods"".  Classical heroes are not portrayed as so unambiguously good and righteous. They, by and large, aren't saving the world, or even pursuing selfless ends, but pursuing their own personal goals for their own personal reasons: Heracles performs his labours to purge himself of personal guilt; Odysseus voyages home because he wants to get home; Achilles fights for little more than the sake of his glory (and later to avenge Patroclus). Classical heroes are held up as fascinating, and ideals in strength and cleverness and devotion to the gods, but not as moral ideals in the same way that modern superheroes are. This also means that they do not rule over the fates of normal people in the same way that modern superheroes do, as their adventures are largely on a personal scale - the message that society's problems can be solved by a small number of exceptional individuals is, in this manner, completely removed.  The actions of classical heroes were set in the real world. This is very important when you consider that one of Moore's main objections to superheroes given in the interview was that they represent ""a retreat from the admittedly overwhelming complexities of modern existence"". Classical heroes were not designed as high fantasy: Homer saw himself as telling historical events, and he was certainly exploring issues relevant to the real world culture he lived in. Achilles wore armour and used weapons much like real soldiers of the time: Superman wears spandex and has a long flowing cape. Of course the classical stories weren't entirely realistic, but they weren't as divorced from reality as current superhero stories are.   tl;dr: ""None of this is new"" is true only if you take a very broad look, but in doing so you miss crucial details. The concept of the superman isn't new in itself, but superheroes in their current form certainly represent a lot that is new - and, indeed, all the details that are being complained about do not really exist in the stories of classical heroes."

books,3dtht2,pharmaceus,29,Sun Jul 19 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"I like how Grant Morrison took the roots for that escapist fantasy and expanded it even further:   In the end, I saw Superman not as a superhero or even a science fiction character, but as a story of Everyman. We’re all Superman in our own adventures. We have our own Fortresses of Solitude we retreat to, with our own special collections of valued stuff, our own super–pets, our own “Bottle Cities” that we feel guilty for neglecting. We have our own peers and rivals and bizarre emotional or moral tangles to deal with.  I felt I’d really grasped the concept when I saw him as Everyman, or rather as the dreamself of Everyman. That “S” is the radiant emblem of divinity we reveal when we rip off our stuffy shirts, our social masks, our neuroses, our constructed selves, and become who we truly are.  Batman is obviously much cooler, but that’s because he’s a very energetic and adolescent fantasy character: a handsome billionaire playboy in black leather with a butler at this beck and call, better cars and gadgetry than James Bond, a horde of fetish femme fatales baying around his heels and no boss. That guy’s Superman day and night.  Superman grew up baling hay on a farm. He goes to work, for a boss, in an office. He pines after a hard–working gal. Only when he tears off his shirt does that heroic, ideal inner self come to life. That’s actually a much more adult fantasy than the one Batman’s peddling but it also makes Superman a little harder to sell. He’s much more of a working class superhero, which is why we ended the whole book with the image of a laboring Superman.  He’s Everyman operating on a sci–fi Paul Bunyan scale. His worries and emotional problems are the same as ours… except that when he falls out with his girlfriend, the world trembles."

""People have to be told"".   I thought that his ethos of ""never compromise, even in the face of armegeddon"" was a good contrast to the other heroes.   He believed that the truth was important, and morality is not a fickle construct. As someone who believes that there are certain moral truths (if we agree on certain axioms, which I believe we can) I liked Rorschach. He might have got the morality wrong, but he didn't justify immorality, which was Ozymandias' whole schtick.   He also gloriously lays bare the folly of Ozy's conceit. After all - the character he decided to model himself on was the one from the poem. And remember how the end of the poem went.   ""Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare  The lone and level sands stretch far away""   To me - Ozymandias was far more reprehensible than Rorschach."

Within that context superheroes are fine, because there usually are super-villains to defeat. Those are not real so I am not overly tempted to think about superheroes in our reality. Now, if they would start to fix real problems, like disease, famine, pollution, that would hit too close to home, I think, and cause less people to sympathize.

Basically, movies are driven by the global market now and the only thing that does well in the global markets are flashy big budget action films that can be enjoyed across cultures even if you don't understand all the subtext.   On top of that, people flock towards familiar names, so turning widely known comic book characters who have been around for decades into movies is just the obvious course.   I'd lump these Superhero films in with Harry Potter, Hunger Games, and the rest of the big budget action franchises in this regard. The trend is towards that more than superheros per se."

It's easy to equate re-telling superhero stories with other tales (Homer, Shakespeare, Melville, etc) and it could be viewed in the same light.  But I think Moore's complaint is that these stories are too simplistic, too escapist - infantile I think he said - and it's not retelling a story to understand today, it's retelling a story to escape today.   Hamlet and the Illiad, for instance (two oft retold tales) are definitively not escapist.  The Iliad has some great action, for sure, but it's very much about the role of pride, and vengeance, and the way combat/war wastes humanity.  I personally think Achilles is a pretty great blueprint for a superhero.  Of course, there is a level of ""who the fuck cares"" I feel about this.  I mean they made a big budget Achilles and it sucked balls.  So in the end, sadly, it is The Movie Machine that churns out crap.

The illiterate masses loved it, which should at least make you think about our time, when even educated people in their 40s and 50s treat the Avengers or some young adult novel like the pinnacle of pop storytelling.   He's also not saying comics can't be realistic, which would be ridiculous for someone who's used the medium in service of his vision himself. He's saying they aren't realistic right now, and one of the reasons is the obsession with Marvel and DC. While there might be some good stories in both of those universes, at the end of the day, the good guys never stay corrupted or stay dead, the bad guys don't stay dead either, keep going for the same kinds of schemes, almost everyone has a similar body type, etc.    And what's more, there isn't much reward for digging deeply into the universes. Sure, there are a few, cool obscure characters and stories that buck trends that people might not access without doing some legwork, but those pale in comparison to the number of stock, cliche ones. And that's not just because of the details of how these things are written, but because of structural features of the industry and our culture itself. At the end of the day, the economic and cultural forces that keep those kinds of comics alive don't allow for strange, new ideas nearly as much as they encourage stagnation and simplicity.   Reading the winding biography of one of these characters since their creation several decades ago yields pretty much no permanent changes or rational arc in development, but just a series of disconnected episodes with seemingly ""epic"" but ultimately artificially bloated, cheap stakes. If you clear your mind of preconceptions, step back for a second, and read a couple of characters' entries on Marvel/DC wikis, I think you'll see exactly what I mean. Is it really worth knowing the differences between the times Cap fought Kang the Conqueror and Doctor Faustus?

People are often critical or find funny that characters consistently come back to life, but I think that is based somewhat on a misunderstanding of comic book characters.  Comic books have a somewhat unique trait of having many authors write a single character. To understand the story of a character to be one continuous, chronological stream of personhood is a mistake. Batman is a clear example of this. People have likely seen the old internet D&D alignment chart justifying every possible alignment for Batman. This starts to get to the idea.  Different authors explore different sides of this character we all know as Batman. In some ways, Batman is a well-known character. We all know how prepared he is, that his parents were killed, and that he is Bruce Wayne during the day. But WHO is Batman? Well, that changes based on who writes him. In this way, Batman (or any other character) is a tool through which we can explore what it means to be human in new and different ways. I think that is the value of comic books (or at least, the value of the way comic books are written).  Each story is a little thought experiment. Supposing a human had these abilities and was put in this situation, how might they behave? Those traits that the characters share with us, perhaps those traits are the most human."

It is easier to finance a Batman movie than an original story when you are planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars. Just ask the producers of Tomorrowland.   Superheroes represent a safe investment. They have built in fanbases, there is endless speculation about the movie's plot and characters, and they can form nested sequels while retaining the ability to appeal to new viewers. Thus you end up with a movie that appeals to a dedicated fanbase and a first time viewer.   The silver lining is that TV is much more open to original stories.

Like did anyone but the biggest comic book nerds ever even hear of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" before it was a movie?

He's essentially making the argument people made in the 1970s and 1980s who argued that HIS WORK wasn't art, because comics are for kids.   Superheroes today serve the same purpose that other mythological pantheons have served throughout human history. The only significant difference I see is that the people who adore these new gods, KNOW they are fictional.   Frankly, I'd rather there be hundreds more superhero movies than one more ""based on a true story"" movie that is almost wholly fictionalized. Superheroes are acknowledged fantasy, and those sorts of stories make people feel good. But unlike the war dramas and such that we get today (and I am a combat veteran), no one is claiming that these stories are true in any sort of literal sense.   Is it childish? Maybe. But there's nothing wrong with stories that appeal to the childlike part in society. This kind of reminds me of the complaints people make about ""edgy"" comedy that goes for laughs first and ""important societal messaging"" second (or not at all)."

There were moments of absolute, striking beauty were I could really feel the magic of the circus, but they were not enough to redeem the story for me. The beautiful, haunting concepts were never fully explored in a meaningful way; they played second fiddle to a REALLY reallllllly boring/generic teen romance kind of story. The characters felt very 1 dimensional, and rarely interacted with each other. They seemed plot motivated rather than motivated by their own desires.  The only truly fleshed out character was the circus itself, due to the wonderful descriptive writing, but that was all.   To each his/her own I guess, but I felt like there was a lot of wasted potential with the story/setting. I still finished the book, which means I didn't think it was THAT horrible, but I just felt that it could have been so much more."

Personally, I find it the perfect summer read, but from what I remember it isn't the biggest on action in the usual sense.   I started with Neverwhere. It's his first solo novel (he wrote Good Omens with Terry Pratchett before this), and as such the writing isn't quite as solid as with his later works, but this book really shows off his unique voice and some of the more surreal qualities to his writing."

I must be one of a very small few who didn't fall in love with the book, but I did enjoy his writing and his creativity. So I tried Neverwhere, and I really enjoyed it. Then I read The Graveyard Book and Coraline, loved them too. I read Stardust and I wasn't a fan. Then I read American Gods, and it was all right. Currently reading Anansi Boys and I love it.  So I say start with Neverwhere, because that was the one that got me to truly enjoy him. But everyone is different!"

That said, If you didn't like the first 60 pages of the first book you may not like the series. It's more like fantasy than it is like horror and while the first book doesn't have the full roster of characters or the more controlled feel of later books it has the core of what I found enjoyable all in place.  As an aside, if you're worried about reading such a huge series don't be. You can enjoy the first book as a stand alone. With the exception of The Waste Lands I would say these are all excellent books. It's not like the Lord of the Rings where the books are so closely connected that you need to read all three or it's not worth reading any."

books,3dycs9,TheGrinchOfSR,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"Although the series does start off fairly slowly, once things pick up they never really stop. One of my favourite things about it are the number of unexpected plot developments (both great and small). Aspects you think have been dropped show up again, and it's interesting to see elements/links to some of his other works that you'll pick up on having read those.  Every book almost centres on a different genre so there's a nice variation on style/content from book to book. It can be a pain in the ass if you're less of a fan of that particular genre (my SO stopped at book 4 partly for this reason), but as others have suggested you should know during book 2/3 whether or not you want to continue with the series.   I'm starting the final book again tonight, and am already not looking forward to finishing the series. It does take time to get through them, especially the first reading, but I think because you invest so much time and energy in them you really feel like you've joined the quest for the Dark Tower.

I haven't read much by him, just his original memoir, Zeitoun, and A Hologram for a King, but looking online at reviews of his other stuff, it seems his earlier memoirs and fiction were pretty acclaimed, though not without their critics. I really liked his memoir. Zeitoun was a bit dry, but still alright. However, his more recent stuff has not been as well-received. A Hologram for a King was just plain awful. The Circle seems to have gotten mixed reviews, but most of the positive ones focus more on the subject matter than the actual quality of the writing, plot, or characters. And his most recent novel was panned everywhere.    If you mean as a person, I know there was a controversy with A Heartbreaking Work... because he made it sound like he was the main care giver for his brother when in reality his sister helped out a lot. He's come off as egotistical as a result. A lot of people also view his subject matter as pandering to audiences without really getting as involved in things as he should be, and, apparently, he has a bad habit of injecting his view points into characters. I haven't read The Circle, but lots of people are criticizing the way he handles many of the characters, who are there to spout of what he wants to say.   He is also the founder of McSweeney's, a publishing firm that many people seem to dislike, though I'm not sure why.

books,3dy08x,thisishowitwentwrong,2,Mon Jul 20 19:07:50 2015 UTC,"For me Eggers is like Dan Brown. His books are numerous, easily digestible, strangely addictive, and downright terrible.   I read all of A Hologram for the King and I have no idea why. I hated every minute of it. It was like Holden Caufield had grown up to be a whiney bitch of an adult and the author wanted to make way too many overly laborious points.   The Circle was much the same. The author takes a steadily more unlikeable character and uses them as a soap box to spout his views on the world. It's an experience somewhat like a mild Ayn Rand mixed with ""Old Man Shakes Fist at Cloud.""  But for some reason I read the whole bloody thing. Cover to cover. The books were strangely addictive.   At the end I was annoyed, dissatisfied, and angry at the waste of my time. There's only two people to blame for this: myself and Dave Eggers. Hence why I think Eggers gets so much hate, people can only loathe themselves so long before they start pushing the hate onto someone else."

I gave him the benefit of the doubt seeing as it was autobiographical and he had some hard experiences. He does go on to say how brilliant he is and how many girls he's slept with but that doesn't bother me. It fits together in the end, we all have a heartbreaking work of staggering genius to tell. (It's a while since I read this so I might be a bit wrong on the specifics).  I was very impressed with ""What is the What"".  Basically a lot of people saw him as a stereotypical 'douche' or whatever you'd call it (I'm British)."
books,3dy08x,Brichals,2,Mon Jul 20 20:54:07 2015 UTC,"The Circle is the reason I have a 50 page rule. It was lent to me by a friend whose opinion I trust and he enthused about it so much. I wanted to stop about 4 times, I kept asking him if anything emerges later in the book that is fundamentally any different to / divergent from the first 50 pages or so. He said there was. I kept reading. I wish I didn't.   It's not that the ideas in the book are not worthwhile, but Eggers could have written the entire substance of that novel on a page. And, as one Goodreads review pointed out, every idea in that novel has been explored much better elsewhere.   The book overall struck me as sophomoric. I was actually very surprised to discover he's a very established author. The characters are utterly unbelievable, the prose is actually painful to read, and the writing came off as trying to be clever without achieving it.   I don't know if any of that sums up why many people hate Eggers. It is simply why I hate that book. I have no feelings about Eggers as a person: I don't know him. But I probably won't read another of his books."

Honestly, I expected more from a book with a title like ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius."" Heartbreaking, yes, in parts. Staggering genius, probably not.   On the other hand, I liked the different prefaces and appendices he put in at the beginning, and appreciated the riskiness of a move like that.

For example, the King James version of Isaiah 7:14 is ""Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel"" whereas the Jewish Publication Society translation is ""Assuredly, my Lord will give you a sign of His own accord! Look, the young woman is with child and about to give birth to a son. Let her name him Immanuel.""

The only thing I can imagine is that you are in a country where books are generally expensive, and then you saw it on the (U.S.) Target website for cheap. No bookseller would mark a new release hardcover up - we mark them down if anything, because hardcovers are a pain in the ass to sell. Something is missing from this picture.  As for why large chains (and bookstores in general) can sell books cheaply, someone mentioned loss-leaders. It's that, and it's also bulk discounts that bookstores get from a distributor or publisher, which could be as much as 45%. A big, important release will often be sold at a good 20 or 30% off, to capitalize on the buzz and move lots of hardcover units while it lasts."
books,3dy37k,floer_homology,2,Mon Jul 20 14:03:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this is a very thought-provoking post. With the wide availability of articles and news coverage on the internet, I'm inclined to believe that nonfiction writing is becoming more appealing to general audiences than it has been in the past. The two authors that come to mind are David Sedaris and Mary Roach. Both write (primarily) nonfiction; Sedaris writes humorous personal essays and Roach writes easy-to-digest books on various scientific topics, particularly ones that are morbidly interesting or ""gross,"" her most notable book being Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers.  Despite the difference in tone and subject matter, nonfiction is really hitting a resurgence. Whether it's writing like Sedaris's that draws on the unique experiences of the individual or like Roach's that taps into the natural curiosity of humans that has perhaps increased due to the wide availability of information on the internet, I'd say that the paradigm is shifting in favor of nonfiction."

She's an unflinching feminist and opposition of patriarchy society, but she makes these points through arguably the most patriarchal modes of writing: fairy stories. She does this by giving well known tales a gothic twist, as well as the inclusion of many taboo subjects like incest and necrophilia, all of which are deeply allegorical. I have read many feminist writers, but none who present their message by dark parody.   Laline Paull wrote 'The Bees' very recently. I remeber it well, because she blends the strangest of genres, animal fiction, sci-fi and Arthurian Literature to great effect. Keatsian romanticism is blended with the language of robotics. I hope that, in future, there will be more stimulating blends of genres."

Books are something you have to learn to appreciate, it's not just simply easy to read books they require effort.    I don't have the attention span to sit there for hours and constantly read words. It just becomes tedious to me. It doesn't mean I'm not smart, it doesn't mean that I'm any less intelligent than people who read books.   I'm sorry but I'm going to have to disagree here. If your attention span is too short to 'read words' you're probably not as intelligent as you give yourself credit for. If you're interested in looking more into this watch some videos on youtube into how the internet changes your brain and affects your attention. Lack of attention in society actually leads to whole variety of societal problems from lack of empathy to full blown bigotry. If you don't have the attention to read words on a page you're unlikely to give another opposing viewpoint the attention it requires to understand.  On a lighter note you just need to find some books that appeal to you. Find books within a genre of the kind of movies/video games you like to watch/play and go from there. However this will take time. You won't be able to just pick up a giant book and demolish it, you have to start slowly but the payoff will be worth it. You will become a more intelligent thoughtful and imaginative human being with a less limited set of mental traits.   The reason people fuss about this is because once you get into reading you will understand how beneficial it can be in life. I'd pursue it further if I was you and see where it will take you.

For example, my first ebook reader was a Sony, then I got a Kindle, I'm now on kobo, I also sometimes buy books from iTunes.   It appears this imply it is now illegal to change books from one format (say, kindle to kobo) to another.  So if you already own a substantial library in one, but you move to a different device, or if the company decides to change the proprietary format their device utilize, then you can only legally read the books you purchased in the old device, transforming them to a different format through calibre is now illegal, and this is supposed to be a 'win' for writers.  As well, if you purchased audiobooks in CD formats, it is now illegal to drag and drop them into your phone, or a usb for your car -- you have to buy them again if you want to listen to them in a different format.  Did I interpret that right?  This seems like a particularly offensive way to punish paying customers, more to the point, it seems they are explicitly trying to force users to buy a separate copy for each kind of device, to me it seems really unfair, but I know there are a few authors in this group, so I want to know how they feel about it."

With a Kindle it's nice to 99% of the time never worry about having a book in stock the same day if I'm really itching to start in on something new. I still spend time in my favorite bookstores even though I don't purchase as much from them anymore.  As far as the technical aspects go it's a really convenient device. Anyone who owns one will tell you the battery lasts forever and it's almost the truth. Seriously, owning something that I only need to charge once every two weeks or so feels great. It weighs almost nothing, so I like to boast that I carry around the majority of my library with me wherever I go.  I like it, it's a fun device. If you can afford it and read a lot you might find it the same."
books,3dzjum,moardownboats,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:08 2015 UTC,"I have been considering getting the paper white. I own a nook tablet but haven't used it in a while because the battery doesn't last very long. I took it camping once and had to read in the car as I was charging it super slowly. I should've gone with a dedicated e-reader. The other draw back of e-reader is that often time physical books are cheaper than e-books (at least older books). I have about 15 physical books in my queue. I gotta get through these before I make the investment on the kindle paper white. However, I was really amazed at how light, comfortable, and small it is. I really want one. Decisions suck :("
books,3dzjum,Screamyahualica,6,Mon Jul 20 20:38:50 2015 UTC,Its not one extreme or the other. You can still read physical books if you own a kindle. Do whatever helps you read more. Down side is used book stores are fucking awesome and right now i'm in a phase where I haven't even touched my nook. I know I will again tho
books,3dzjum,operator-as-fuck,5,Mon Jul 20 20:37:02 2015 UTC,"I was against getting an ereader for the longest time.  Mainly for the reason of it needing to be a physical book, and I felt like I was going to be taking away from the reading experience if I got a Kindle.  But one day, I finally decided to get one.  And you know what?  It really doesn't take away from it at all.  I took it on vacation and loved the fact that when I got tired of reading the book I had started, I was able to just switch to another one, without having to rummage through my suitcase to find it.  Although it is WAY too easy to get a new book - just a tap of the finger :)  Plus you can get a free book each month.  I decided that if it was something I could get at my local B&N, I would buy the physical book, but if I needed to order it from Amazon, I'd just do the ebook.  Best of both worlds!  I say do it.  And if you are disappointed in it, I'm sure you can sell it very easily.  Although if you're prone to spilling things on books, it might not be a good idea ;)"

Pros:    ridiculously easy to read on, the screen is great; nothing like an iPad. I'm still marveling at the screen and smooth fonts. weighs almost nothing I was in a bookstore the other day and was about to buy a paperback, but decided to check the Kindle version's price, and it was half as expensive.   Cons:   navigating pages is a pain in the ASS (turning pages is easy, but going back to find a passage somewhere sucks) it's another damn gadget you have to care about and care for. I was reading a physical copy of a Joseph Campbell book on the subway the other day and a nearby woman began talking to me because she saw what I was reading. Had a fantastic conversation that never would have occurred if I'd been reading it on a Kindle.   Overall I'm pleased I got it and it's not like I'm going to stop reading physical books just because I have this thing. Hopefully it lasts years. Do it. Spend your money. CONSUME!! Buy BUY BUY!!!!"

The front-lit screen is so convenient for reading in bed, or on a plane. The instant delivery of new books is awesome, especially if I finish a book early on vacation or while traveling. Also, being able to carry hundreds of books while traveling is a huge plus. I still buy used books when the prices are significantly better than the Kindle store, so keep in mind you don't necessarily have to read exclusively on the Kindle."

books,3dzjum,matilda93,3,Mon Jul 20 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"For sure, get one. I have the Kindle Fire 6 for books and it's great, and only $100. I have about 50 books on there, and I generally read about five at once -- so kindle is good because I never know what I'll be in the mood to read, and carrying 5 physical books is silly for obvious reasons.  A nice kindle bonus, and this may work with other tablets too, is free books. Tons of free books. You can borrow books from other kindle owners, from the library, and you can download free books from amazon. The last one was a nice find when I got my kindle -- many books are old enough to be past copyright, so there are free electronic copies, and many of them are spectacular.  A few free ones on my kindle that I can recommend: Walden, Death Valley in '49 (one of the best I've ever read), Autobiography of Ben Franklin, Canterbury Tales, Correspondence of Cicero, Meditations, Sailing Alone Around the World, Two Years Before the Mast, The Works of Edgar Allen Poe (vols 1-5), War and Peace.  For more ideas, just search for ""free books at amazon"" or ""books past copyright at amazon"" and you'll find lists.  Also, you may not need a kindle at all. If you have a phone that's big enough and good enough for reading, just get the kindle app and you're in business."

They who never go to the holy land in their walks, as they pretend, are indeed mere idlers and vagabonds, but they who do go there are saunterers in the good sense, such as I mean. Some, however, would derive the word from sans terre, without land or a home, which, therefore, in the good sense, will mean, having no particular home, but equally at home everywhere. For this is the secret of successful sauntering. He who sits still in a house all the time may be the greatest vagrant of all, but the Saunterer, in the good sense, is no more vagrant than the meandering river, which is all the while sedulously seeking the shortest course to the sea. But I prefer the first, which indeed is the most probable derivation. For every walk is a sort of crusade, preached by some Peter the Hermit in us, to go forth and reconquer this holy land from the hands of the Infidels.""  This is why I love taking walks."

Don't get me wrong, they're both great books that are worth reading, but I think the other commenters are right that these books just don't quite mean the same thing to readers today that they did when they were written. They're definitely worthy of significant praise even today, I just didn't find any of the big perspective-altering insights I was expecting. Now Animal Farm, that's a book that's as relevant today as it was way back when, and every bit as enjoyable. I mean he explained the Russian revolution in like 100 pages in such a way that an 8 year old could understand it.

I don't remember the details, but I think he kills at least one kid, and really injures another one?  Like okay, it was in self-defense so he's not legally accountable or whatever, but he's not held morally or emotionally accountable either.

Your first point is a completely justifiable one, and one with which I struggled when reading the novel. The second point, though, is a bit complicated in my opinion: yes, Ender is absolved legally, but I don't think that he's at all let off the hook (by himself) emotionally or psychologically, as he seems haunted by thoughts of violence, and by thoughts of his similarities to his brother, Peter, all throughout the novel.   Additionally, there's this interesting nugget, which I think made the justice of Ender's legal exoneration more ambiguous morally:   Ender: “So they didn’t know what they were doing.”, Mazer says “Don’t start apologizing for them, Ender. Just because they didn’t know they were killing human beings doesn’t mean they weren’t killing human beings.”"

Edit: The Guardian article better articulated what I'm trying to get at  34. Metamorphosis is a story in which a man suffers a terrible and inexplicable misfortune, is reduced to an abject and alien state, then is made to suffer doubly by the attitude of his ostensible loved ones, who make clear they would be better off without him – a verdict that he, with a passivity that seems culpable, accepts."

And yet, when you are at your best, you find that you don't have time for all the attention you're getting.  People are selfish and they don't even realize it most of the time.  It takes a strong and compassionate individual to recognize these tendencies, and to push their own apprehensions aside and be there for another person in their most desperate times.  I only have two people in my life that meet this standard, and one is my mom :(  Edit 2:  And just to add one more thing.  Most people, despite how they react in the circumstance, are aware of this condition.  That being said, most people, after seeing someone when they are down, attempting to pull themselves up by their boot-straps, will become inspired to assist.  Think of a man broken down on the side of the road just sitting next to his car.  You're inclined to pass right on by.

Or his mother and sister move about his furniture, pull out his lockers and such... What do you think they found? Kafka himself is supposed to have had a rather freaky porn stash locked up in his locker. And note also that the father plays pretty much no role whatsoever in the story, just sits there. He's not really going to be the cause of any shame.  And then Gregor tries to save himself in that he will just love his sister for her music. How would those other men treat her anyway? Not very well! ... A little something touching on incest there.  And then there's the end. Gregor's parents just happening to notice that his sister has grown up to be a beautiful young woman.   I could go more into detail too. But I mean if you're a dude this should be pretty easy. I wouldn't want my mum and sister rooting around in my room either. That's basically the story.  Edit: Nice negs bros. But this interpretation is blatantly correct. God you lot are boring."
books,3drbum,berkomamba,6,Sat Jul 18 22:00:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly think you've taken the one scene about his ""shame"" about his picture of a woman. In the original version (which I'm aware is probably not as well-read as translations) there is no allusions to the woman's nudity or sex appeal. His reaction though is painted with sexual shame. I just disagree with your simplistic reading of the Metamorphosis; it ignores so many other important details, and I really, really did not understand Gregor and his sister's relationship to be to any degree incestuous.   If you're going to make one broad statement about what The Metamorphosis is about, I'd argue that it's is a depiction of Marxist's theory of alienation as a result of the capitalist condition. I'll explain:   Alienation of the worker from the work — from the product of his labour. Gregor is a mere salesman who studies train schedules instead of enjoying his youth. He is absolutely estranged from his work. He doesn't produce any of the cloth samples he tries to peddle to customers here there and everywhere. This leads nicely into the second type of alienation. Alienation of the worker from working — from the act of producing. Imagine a carpenter building a chair. He likely forms the legs of the chair, the seat, the back, you name it, the carpenter puts his heart and soul into designing and building the chair such that the chair has some of his personality in it -- he can feel satisfied with the end product, despite the work he put in. Gregor, on the other hand, is a traveling salesman for the means of ensuring his family's security and his sister's opportunity to attend the Observatory (IIRC). His hard work goes into traveling across the country, a slave to the train schedule and that is almost literally the first thing he complains about: traveling.    3.Alienation of the worker from himself, as a producer — from his Gattungswesen (species-essence). This type of alienation, in my opinion, is the most obvious. Gregor literally becomes a ""Ungeziefer"", which depending on how you want to translate is either: a pest, a cockroach, or a beetle. His transformation has to be understood as literal because he is able to climb on walls and the ceiling, the chief clerk who comes to check on him reacts immediately to the sight of Gregor, Gregor has trouble getting out of bed, etc.. Gregor is so alienated from himself that the foods he loves, which his sister brings, he cannot stand. He prefers the moldy food to the food he once enjoyed.    Alienation of the worker from other workers. I think this type of alienation is most evident towards the end of the book when Gregor's sister has a job and has become increasingly negligent towards him (justifiably so). His father, who he never got along with in the book (which mirrors Kafka's relationship to his real father, but I digress...), is a hard-working man by the end of the book and is completely apathetic to Gregor's plight which is shown by his absence from any direct interaction with Gregor after pegging him good with an apple.    Also, despite all I've written, I encourage you to challenge my reading of the Metamorphosis. It has long confused readers and I find Kafka to be incredibly talented at his ability to instill an emotion without ever telling you why you should feel that way. I really take issue with anyone claiming that their interpretation of a reading is correct. They are words on a page, barring translation, neither you nor I have any idea what Kafka meant, it's possible that Kafka didn't mean anything and was a serious loon. It's all speculation, so speculate away.  edit:some formatting 2nd edit: the second 1 should be a 4. I don't know why it persists as one, also source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation#Types_of_alienation"
books,3drbum,torpiddynamo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:14:13 2015 UTC,"First off, I’ll say that I very much concur with your appreciation of Kafka, and find it brilliant of him myself that he should so capture readers like he does. Without a doubt the man was a master.  That said, however, he was certainly no loon, and with every story I’ve read of him, I’ve seen a very obvious and clear message. Just because he writes in dreams – which is what he had intended in doing most probably (and yes, to capture the mind, because there is little else which will inspire wonder like dreams) – does not mean that he is writing nothing at all, merely to amuse. The man very clearly had a spiritualistic turn about him, which is quite clearly evinced in his writings, letters, and so on, and, even, I think, in his requesting that all his manuscripts, letters, etc., be burned given his death, almost as if a final question put upon the world. Where does fire come into death? I’ll let you puzzle that one out for yourself. But it only stands to reason then that such a man should write something actually real, if you are to accept that he was such a man.  The Hunger Artist, for example. What else could this be about but the moralist, the real moralist? There is an allusion to Jesus Christ Himself within the story. But then Kafka says of the moralist ‘artist’, because that is all he really amounts to – a spectacle. It does not matter that this supposed artist’s only wish is that we should know how easy it is, only the effect he has had. I actually always picture Nietzsche as the hunger artist, personally.  Or A Message From the Emperor. What else does this text speak of but a question as to whether or not a man’s life has had purpose, as to whether or not there exists a god? But sure, what we’re most immediately left with is a queer feeling in our bellies, because he does not explicitly state what it is he is getting at. But what else? A man is dying and he waits upon a message from the Emperor. What does this bear striking resemblance to?  And then there is The Metamorphosis. It is quite clear also that Kafka had considerable hang-ups when it came to human connection. Does one need anything more than the beautiful quote ‘I am a cage, in search of a bird’ to illustrate this? And how perfectly then would his musical sister fit into that cage in the finish-up of The Metamorphosis? But let’s explore the previous idea a little further, shall we? How about the father, for instance? What does he do within the story? Merely sits there, right? Works Gregor. What picture does this paint of human connection? And in the finish-up it is realised by the parents that Gregor’s sister has grown up to be beautiful; is this not the parents realising they have a certain capital still, once Gregor is said  and done with? And so we find our setting. The story is about the family, not capitalism or such. Sure, Gregor has dreams, he aspires to go places, which is the interest in train schedules… But what does this detract from the story being about family relation? Why should he feel an enormous insect in the workplace? Simply because he does not feel up to the job? Perhaps. But perhaps it is better read that he harboured a certain sort of selfishness also, that his dreams fed a conception of himself which paralleled his father’s siring Gregor just to work for him. And so the Dame im Pelz takes significance too. A woman in dead animal skins. Did Kafka himself not turn vegetarian, speak of things such as a relief from guilt in doing so? The insect is not to paint a picture of something pitiful, something beaten, but of self-disgust. And so he finds a sudden change in his tastes, not because he has literally transformed, but because he has psychologically transformed – he has taken a good long look at himself. And then this feeds into all the rest that I’ve said, about the story being about sexual guilt. And you mention the boss coming to see him even – again, human connection. What does the boss think of him in this state, where he sees him at his most personal? How is Gregor to rise (have a look back at my reading of A Message From the Emperor here) given this existence of his? What is he but a great, grotesque insect? And what does the apple symbolise? That apple which found itself lodged in Gregor’s insect body’s scales? Knowledge of good and evil. And in the end he pleads that he will just love the music of it, that he does not need any more than that (see again, his letters - all he wants is to have his head petted for eternity). And so on. You do the story an injustice by removing it from most immediate humanity. Kafka is so much the beautiful moralist that it is heart-breaking. He was no ideologist, but an existentialist. But people are mostly fools, I suppose (see The Hunger Artist)."

Brod published selected pieces against his wishes because he felt the world should have them. The mental health aspect I think makes the whole issue about more than a dick move on Brod's part. Could Kafka really have been considered of sound mind when he gave that order? If he had been well, what would he have requested then? If he really didn't want anybody to see them, why didn't he destroy them himself? To what extent are artistic works the property of the creator, or of the public?  I don't have the answer to any of those questions, but I definitely think they're worth raising.

Gregor feels repulsive and helpless, and becomes increasingly withdrawn; his family act as though it is his fault and he could change back if he wanted to, and find it difficult to know how to react; even his initially patient sister eventually loses interest in him. When Gregor finally dies, rather than mourning him, the family find themselves free, an idea some depressives use as a justification for their suicides."

books,3drbum,classicrocker883,16,Sun Jul 19 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"We read this when I was a freshman in college. So as each one of our groups presented, the teacher would stop and say something or ask questions. She would try to hint what's really going on in the story. So then after a series of questions, that I answered to the class as a group was presenting, the hint was that this man who believed he was a bug was a human to his family and only a bug to himself. After saying this in a different way after those questions, the ones presenting never got it, they kept saying he was a bug, or insect. The truth is he only imagined that he was one because it says at the end of his life he let out one last breath. This is one point when the teacher stopped and I answered saying that insects breathe through their skin, and he couldn't actually let out a breath if he was one. Another point is that if you or anyone in your family saw a giant bug in the place of another person, you would think that they were eaten by it or you would simply want to exterminate it. So if Kafka's character was actually a huge bug, then why would his family or sister take care of him? how would she know it was him? These classmates took the words of the novella so seriously that I couldn't believe they didn't think harder about what the story was about, why would an English teacher make us read a fictional story about someone transformed into a helpless creature. The thing to take away from this that I don't think anyone of my classmates did is this human being suffered one day as he woke up and believed he was incapable of performing his duty as the breadwinner, for whatever reason, and he believed that his family could change him back, but they couldn't, and changing back had to happen from the inside of his mind. I looked up and and saw an early illustrated cover showing a disturbed man coming out of his room disheveled and hand in his face, not wanting to see the world or part take in it."
books,3drbum,torpiddynamo,17,Sun Jul 19 01:25:00 2015 UTC,"He was literally transformed into a bug. He was able to run on the ceilings which he said he enjoyed, he struggled with opening the door when his boss came to check on him in the morning, that same boss, after taking one look at Gregor, stumbled backwards down the stairs and took off -- speechless, he had an apple lodged in his carapace (described with such words). Honestly, I can go on and on and on. Don't assume your simplistic reading of a truly befuddling work is somehow superior.   One has to understand the metamorphosis as an actual physical condition, otherwise everyone: his sister, mother, father, and boss, are crazy for reacting to Gregor as they did. Hell, his mother couldn't bear to look at him the first morning, if he was only a bug to himself, why would others react like they did?  Edit: I doubt Kafka knew that bugs breathe through their skin, I understand Gregor's last breath as symbolic of his death, not literal."
books,3drbum,Bananasauru5rex,3,Sun Jul 19 05:43:30 2015 UTC,"The whole thing is always symbolic from the beginning--perhaps the literal reading is one in which he truly has a carapace and slobbers the chopped spittle of the bug. But of course it speaks so clearly about modernity in the mode of Bartleby the Scrivener--on the one hand, the man who resists by refusing, and on the other, the man who is pummeled into helplessness.  I could imagine a perfectly consistent reading that looks at the hiding in the bed, the crawling on walls, etc. as metaphorical. I don't even mean to suggest that they are representative or symbolic (the most obvious readings), where at the literal level we have a bug, and beneath the surface we have a story of helplessness and abjection. Rather, one could read every movement of the bug as simply a convenient description of the depressed person (what they might've called the melancholic in 1915). So, when Gregor retreats under his covers from the responsibilities he can't face-> he masticates his mandibles and smarts in the dark beneath his bed.

I answered saying that insects breathe through their skin, and he couldn't actually let out a breath if he was one.    Then how do you explain his ability to crawl up the wall? The fact that Kafka didn't know the anatomy of beetle breathing is more likely a mistake (or a mistranslation on the translator's part).

His condition and eventual death allowed her to live a more adult and independent life.  I believe the last paragraph of the story is the family talking about her working and finding a husband.

Nothing that would seriously detract from the books, but I would recommend reading the Robot series first, Empire series then Foundation.  This is the story chronological order.

The Empire books aren't even really critical to the Foundation series other than that it's the same Empire, none of the events or characters in Empire are mentioned  in Foundation."

You can find a seriesguide here for that.  This is what Isaac himself recommended.  Some folks suggest adding ""End of Eternity"" to the beginning or end of the reading.  Alternatively, here is another person's suggestion which splits things up a bit, and optimize the gradual discovery of the universe in a way that makes things exciting.  I have read Asimov's complete works several times in different orders. I think if I could go back, I would opt to start with the last option I listed, then complete the supplemental reading suggested at the bottom of the same infographic.

I usually try and ignore keeping up with authors too much as real people, because inevitably things they say or do end up tarnishing their work in some way (I'm looking at you, Orson Scott Card), but the skullduggery here is hard to ignore.  Having said that, I finished ""Go Set A Watchman"" yesterday, and I have to say it's still a pretty darn good book. The flashbacks to Scout's childhood still resonate strongly with ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" and you can see why an editor would suggest to her on her second draft to focus more on that.  But more broadly, I think Watchman also works as a companion novel to Mockingbird. Like you said, any intention we wish to ascribe to this fact is fiction of our own, but where Atticus of Mockingbird is this romantic figure serving as a shining beacon of justice to a child, Atticus of Watchman is a real person. As inspirational as the former is, the existence of the latter actually inspires in ways that a lot of people might find helpful for their real lives. There's still value to be had here, exploitation or not."

books,3dtizb,PM_ME_YOUR_DALEKS,3,Sun Jul 19 21:26:25 2015 UTC,"Good summation, OP. I would just add a few pertinent facts:  In 2007, Harper Lee signed over the rights of To Kill a Mockingbird to her literary agent, Samuel Pinkus. The agreement was renewed in 2011 with Tonja Carter notarizing it. However, despite having notarized said agreement, Carter then brought a lawsuit against Samuel Pinkus in 2013 arguing that Harper Lee had been infirm since suffering a stroke in 2007 and lacked the capabilities to understand and agree to any contracts, and that Pinkus 'abused his power' in getting a blind, deaf and senile Lee to sign the contract turning over her rights. The case was settled in 2013 and the rights were returned to Harper Lee. (When asked by a journalist how Lee could be infirm and unable to consent to a contract in 2007 yet do so in 2015 to publish Watchman, Carter refused to comment).  Since Alice Lee's death, Tonja Carter has controlled every aspect of Harper Lee's life, including her finances and even the visitors to her nursing home. After gaining the rights to TKAM back, Carter promptly filed a copyright infringement suit against the local museum in Monroeville, Alabama for selling TKAM themed gifts. Meanwhile Tonja and her husband opened a competing restaurant nearby on Courthouse Square in Monroeville. (Carter's husband was also involved in a land dispute in Monroeville).  In addition to lying about the discovery of Go Set a Watchman, Tonja Carter has been caught in open lies regarding Lee's consent re: the book. Despite a statement supposedly from Harper Lee about how thrilled she was about the discovery of Watchman, in a Wall Street Journal article last month, Carter acknowledged that only she and Lee's new literary agent read the book before it was sent to the publisher, and Harper Lee did not. Keep in mind that not only did Carter previously acknowledge that Lee had forgotten the existence of Watchman at all, but Carter had also released a statement claiming that Harper had shared the draft with friends who encouraged her to publish it. Now she was admitting that not only had Harper not read it, but there were no ""friends"" who had read it and encouraged her to publish it either. (When Alice Lee was alive, she had previously chastened Tonja Carter for releasing false statements to the press under Harper Lee's name when Carter knew that Harper Lee was infirm and couldn't understand what was asked of her.)  HarperCollins has also acknowledged that they have had zero contact with Harper Lee in the publication of Watchman. Jonathan Burnham of HarperCollins told the New York Times: ""We have never spoken directly to Ms. Lee about the book and have communicated solely through her lawyer, Ms. Carter, and her literary agent, Andrew Nurnberg. The statement Ms. Lee provided expressing her delight that the new novel will finally be published was delivered through her lawyer, Ms. Carter."""

It seems that someone could make the argument that, at this point in her life and in her current condition, there's not much of a chance that she'll be subjected to the ""pressure and publicity"" that seemed to be her main motive for not publishing the book in the first place.   I'm not gonna be that guy. But I think someone could argue that her wishes are still being respected.  You should also throw some spoiler tags on your original post.

Can't remember right now). It is really, really hard for me to believe that a family of lawyers would not have planned for a time when both Harper and Alice were unavailable to make decisions. If not when the book was first published, certainly at least by the late 70s or early 80s, its popularity and longevity were well-cemented.  As for Harper's alleged senility, as far as I know, it's still alleged, and it can be hard to measure engagedness with a mostly blind and deaf individual. My grandmother is older than Ms Lee, also blind and deaf, but no more senile than I am. There's plenty of people who want to say they know Harper Lee or are her good friend; but who are in no better of a position to comment on her mental state than me. Maybe she's senile, maybe she isn't, but I think to presume that she is just because one guy said it (which quote then got propagated around the internet) and because of course all 97-yr-olds are senile is infantilizing.  I want to be cautiously optimistic that she's okay with it. But I admit I just don't know."

books,3dtizb,Catch_42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:43:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to comment on whether or not Lee was coerced into publishing, but I am going to comment on this part:   Also, I don’t understand why people are acting like Lee made Atticus more racist with age as an intentional character arc. GSAW was written a full two years before TKAM, and is in fact the first draft. Lee sent GSAW over to her publisher and it was rejected, with the advice that the story should be reworked to focus on Jean Louise as a girl. That led to GSAW undergoing a heavy rewrite and being transformed into TKAM. This rewrite included changing racist Atticus into shining knight and moral compass Atticus, a similar but definitely different character. Indeed, these are similar, but alternate universes. For example, Tom Robinson is found guilty in TKAM but is acquitted in GSOW. This is not the same story, people: GSAW is not a sequel as it was written first, and is but a rough sketch of what TKAM would become. And I’m not upset because I idolized Atticus before GSOW. I think making Atticus grow disillusioned with age, or having Scout realize she didn’t actually understand everything about her father as a child, would make for a compelling story. But if you want to claim that was Lee's intention with GSAW, then you're making up fiction yourself.   Interpretations of Atticus's character arc have very little to do with what Lee intended. The author's intent doesn't really matter for the interpretation of the text itself. There are all kinds of interesting readings that one can do of TKAM and GSAW, and these readings shouldn't be constrained by our hypotheses about what Lee may or may not have been thinking when she wrote them.   For one thing, we don't really know and will never really know what she was thinking when she wrote it. This is true of all authors, but it's particularly true in the case of Lee, who has made it pretty clear in her previous statements to the public that she doesn't want to be treated as the authority on the interpretation of her work. She has refused to engage in the endless conversation over what she ""really means"" or was thinking at the time. Her suspected ailments only add to this - the author is not going to come and rescue us from the ambiguity this text and its unusual path to publication have left us with.  Additionally, GSAW means something very different to the public today than it would have if it had been released in the late 1950s, prior to To Kill A Mockingbird. Our reaction as an audience matters. Viewing the work of art as separate from its creator frees us to respond in a greater variety of ways and allows the meaning of the artwork to continue to evolve as the context of its audience evolves.

books,3dtizb,kinako-,2,Sun Jul 19 18:48:49 2015 UTC,"Sure, the reader can certainly interpret TKAM or GSAW anyway they so choose. You're missing my point, though: I'm not trying to say Harper's intentions are the Word of God here.   It is indeed possible for people to misinterpret things, no? My point with the passage you selected is that many critics and readers are misinterpreting the events of TKAM and GSAW as one continuous story, when they are actually, and this is a fact, set in similar but alternate universes. Even if you don't believe, as I do, that Atticus simply has a different personality rather than a more developed one, you can look to the changing of important plot points as proof of this fact."

All you need to know that it is a modernist Odyssey and the rest is for you to decide on. Know the classics may make it a little more enjoyable but I wouldn't bend over backward to make yourself familiar if you aren't already. Go through Wikipedia a little and familiarize yourself with the structure and scenes of the Odyssey. Other than that just read it like a normal book.

One thing I would recommend is reading a little on Charles Stewart Parnell, he's very relevant to Joyce. If you get lost, Shmoop do a simple summary of the action, I used that a few times whenever it got too heavy."
books,3dvoem,shemthepen,3,Mon Jul 20 06:57:09 2015 UTC,"If you're having trouble at the beginning skip to the fourth chapter with Mr Bloom making breakfast. His interior monologue is what first drew me in to the book & still the most fun on rereads and further study. Don't worry about the Odyssey or trying to understand thematic stuff at first, just follow along with Mr Bloom's day & his thoughts. If there are other parts you don't understand that's okay but use Mr Bloom as a guide to get you through at first."

books,3dvoem,wecanreadit,2,Mon Jul 20 04:44:01 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes, part 1 requires some knowledge of the historical/Homer allusions, plus of Stephen Dedalus as a character to really appreciate it. Otherwise it might come off as boring or just confusing. Part 2 requires nothing, Mr Bloom is starting his day & you join him. That's where the book really kicked in for me the 1st time I read it."

books,3dvoem,piwikiwi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:02:54 2015 UTC,I would also add that if you want to understand the first part and Stephen Dedalus' character you should read Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man as that is truly Stephen's story and gives you a good intro to the modernist style.
books,3dvoem,Jewcunt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:37:44 2015 UTC,"I would say that most of the first six chapters are fine. Of these, Chapter 3 (when Stephen goes to the beach and Joyce gives us a long stream-of-consciousness section) is more tricky, but get through it and you're into Chapter 4. What's not to like about Bloom, whose morning begins there? But always be prepared for Joyce to go into a new style. There must be literally dozens of different styles pastiched and parodied in this novel.  I read it, more or less unaided, a few years ago. My (fairly detailed) reading journal might help. It's here."

""I’ve put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant, and that’s the only way of insuring one’s immortality.""  Just try and slog through. Loads of people love it, even still today. Personally I finished it on principle and wish I'd spent the time on something else."

Maybe it's just because there are very few narrators who are actually good at doing multiple voices. They tend to overdo it and it becomes very grating very quickly.

I don't usually like multiple narrators, but the Orphan Masters was good that way, and the Maddaddam trilogy by Atwood. I agree, some narrators are awful and distracting. Fortunately, on Audible you can preview the narration. Some books (Dickens, e.g.) seem written to be read aloud and I've loved the luxury of hearing them. Some authors do a great job of reading their work (Cold Mountain, Charles Frazier) and other not so such (John le Carre.)"

I can't remember anything specifically, but my mom used to listen to a lot of mystery audiobooks around the house, and they were all narrated by men who read the female voices like it was a Monty Python sketch.   You might prefer full cast recordings, since it's actual different voices instead of one person doing different voices. You would probably also like anything narrated by Neil Gaiman...I've never heard him try to do a voice."

It's really hard to put a finger on, but I guess ennui would be the best word to describe it for me.  Other than that, it is a funnily sad story. The first few lines gave me a smirk on my lips, because it is so absurd. BUT, that is the brilliant thing about Metamorphosis, as Jonathan Franzen said,    ""Nobody ever wrote a more autobiographical story than ""The Metamorphosis"".   And this is what fiction is good for, communicating feelings and emotions, and personal stories. And that is why Metamorphosis is so good, it communicated these emotions that would be impossible to describe in any other way than some absurd story."

In many ways, it is the true dystopia come to life. It, in a very prescient demonstrates the corrosive force of the bureaucracy of society on sense of self. It shows how we often find ourselves trapped in roles we didn't want by unseen and malicious forces, without recourse, and how we find ourselves unwilling or unable to cope. It demonstrates the more banal yet still disturbing nature of existential angst in the modern world--- a visualization of basing suspicion in many of us, and offering an understanding of where it develops. In many ways, it cuts to the heart of the real, existential pain of the modern person.  It also  serves as a vehicle for many interpretations, existential, Marxist, feminist, biographical, historical, christian, etc. It I'd surprisingly adept at being analyzed successfully from a number of perspectives  ."

One should never identify as a victim, and that is exactly what many readers of The Metamorphosis come to do. At the time that Kafka wrote the story, it may simply have been a slightly juvenile look at stigma. However, in today's age of identity politics, it's become a hateful story to me."

My advice would be to just jump in and go with it.  I have enjoyed the challenge.   It is often confusing but that seems to be Pynchons intention.  I have read six other books whilst I've read this.  That's is my advice I suppose.  At times it can be mentally exhausting or maybe at a particular time I wanted to read but my brain wasn't in 'Pynchon mode' so I would just read other things.  It would refresh my pallet so to say and I would come back to GR excited to dive in and appreciate it. But the general consensus on GR is just to dive in and go, don't worry about not comprehending everything because it's impossible.  I've heard some say that it's much clearer on a second read, which I don't know if I really believe but perhaps.

'It's too hot for housework,' she thought,"" he would write ""Annie sat on her front porch swing.  It is too hot for housework.""

But they're enjoyable movies, and you'll probably like them.  I'd say the first two are the worst, and then they get a lot better. I think Prisoner of Azkaban was probably the best.

The plots are solid standing on their own (meaning they make sense without having read the books), but having the extra details from the books does enrich the experience. But the movies move at a movie pace, focusing more on action and problem-solving involving HHR and letting everyone else take a backseat, supporting role for the most part. I can't think of any major contradictions between the films and the movies. I'm sure after reading the entire series thrice, you could nitpick the films if you were so inclined. I think that would be selling them short.  The acting is the good. Obviously, a lot of love and hard work went into the films. And money, don't forget money.  The first book came out just before I started college. Didn't read it. My first taste of Harry Potter was the first film in 2001. I continued to watch and enjoy the films as they came out without reading the books until the Deathly Hallows part 2 in 2011. At that time, I picked up every book in hardback and read them in the few weeks leading up to the premiere of the last movie. I was satisfied with both experiences. Hauling 7 hardback books back from London, OTOH, was a chore.  tl;dr Films are good if you let them be films with film pacing."

He used to be my favorite author, and I read virtually everything he wrote up to a certain time.  (Actually, come to think of it, I stopped reading everything of his after listening to the audiobook of ""Angles and Other Stories"", which I listened to late at night, and which creeped me right the fuck out.  Seriously, what. the. fuck.)  Anyway.  Once you've read any three of his books, you'll start to recognize The Moment.  That one point, in every book, where a casual throw-away sort of slightly wrong moment occurs.  You can read any one or two books, and probably not notice it (except Songmaster).  But eventually, it becomes too blatant to miss.  Especially if you've read Songmaster.  I actually think Songmaster is an excellent book -- but you'll feel icky if you read it, and you'll never think of Card in the same way.  Once you've read enough, you start to reach the conclusion that there might be something bad in his past.  I'm not going to say he's gay, or that there actually is anything bad in his past... but... well... read Songmaster, then read basically any two other works of his, and see if you can resist drawing conclusions."

At the Mountains of Madness is a novella that inspired a lot of the common themes in sci-fi horror.  The Nameless City inspired most of the crack-pot conspiracy theories about ancient aliens and giant reptilians in the center of the earth.  My favorite types of stories that he writes are about an individuals slow realization of a world that we can't normally and should never really try to comprehend.  I really recommend checking out authors that contributed to his Mythos. There are many famous and not so famous authors who have carried on his ideas and have done REALLY well with it.

With the recent Supreme Court ruling, the gay marriage issue becomes moot. The Full Faith and Credit clause of the Constitution will, sooner or later, give legal force in every state to any marriage contract recognized by any other state.

Like I really liked The Mists of Avalon but Bradley in her life was accused of covering for her husband, who was a child molester.  If she were still alive, that would definitely be enough for me to question whether I should buy her books or not,  but now there's no real point to boycotting and while I haven't read any in the Avalon series since I found that out, I don't think it informed her work much at all.  If the author's views really come forward in their work, though, it's harder to get through.  Dostoevsky at least has written some great atheist characters (I really love Ivan from The Brothers Karamazov).    HP Lovecraft's racism does come through in a lot of his work which makes it harder to enjoy when it comes up, and I don't blame the reader when it's too much to enjoy him at all."

He's eventually redeemed by adopting said young man as his heir, and then they all live happily ever after.   Me reading it without knowing anything at all: ""That's fucked up.  She writes a lot about sexuality and gender roles, though.  Is this some form of commentary on rapey romance tropes?"" Me reading it after hearing rumors about Breen: ""Ah, he's is a stand-in for Breen and she's trying to reform him or something.""

And there's a whole chunk of the Count of Monte Cristo that takes place in Italy that I just completely ignore because it's so incredibly misogynistic, but there's still so many other parts of that book that are great.

The way I think of it, when you have a guy that writes stories as good as Lovecraft, why should his personal beliefs matter?

books,3dr6ix,fforiwr,4,Sat Jul 18 21:38:05 2015 UTC,"Even an ardent racist and homophobe can write a compelling and amazing story. Personally I don't find that the author matters for fiction books. I still have no idea about even the most basic details of J.K. Rowling's life for instance. If she were a horrible and wicked person, would I care? Not really, no. She wrote her story, the story interests me, and I don't need real world issues muddying up my perception of the story. Harry Potter stands on its own. It has become an entity unto itself, as any well made fantasy world should. Obviously, if I found out the author of a series I liked was using their profits to fund illegal activities of some sort, then it would matter. But how often does that happen? And when it does I won't really be able to avoid hearing about it, if the author has written any remotely popular books.  All that being said, there is one genre where knowing and understanding the author is as important, if not more so, than knowing and understanding the book you are reading. History books! Having majored in history this may just be a pet peeve, but being the inexact and quirky science that it is, history (and the other social sciences) are uniquely vulnerable to human biases and whatnot. So any work concerning those subjects demands intense scrutinizing of the author and their sources that is very thorough. There's an interesting book, called Lying About Hitler if I recall correctly, that focuses on just this issue, and the case of a particular author who made a fortune misconstruing historical data in order to make a quick buck and promote his personal ideology. Kind of disturbing how easy and widespread such activity is, too."

I don't mind when an author stitches their views into a story, but when you make an entire chapter of characters only discussing the merits of your views on religion or government (a lot of Mormonism/similar beliefs and libertarianism in sci-fi/fantasy) that does nothing to advance the plot, well...

And I think if we could somehow make people into truly good individuals, that would solve an awful lot of problems.  Now, admittedly, God may be capable of doing that, but religion simply speaking has ever been unable to produce deep internal changes like what Dostoevsky envisioned.

Well, they can't surrender to anything, even movies and TV. ""But that's all right"", they think, ""because in these cases there is not much time lost or anything"".   But, when comes to books, people suddenly ""realize"" that this should be taken seriously. You know, smart people read. And in school we read to become smart. Study. Books have knowledge. Knowledge isn't fun. Also, reading takes time. I'm a busy person. I have other things to do. If I'm investing time on reading, it's because it is serious. Okay, I'm not that busy, but I do have lot of others things to do. Gaming. Driving. The lawn. Drinking. Enjoying myself. People will think things about me if they realize I read a lot. Bad things. Make fun.   And that sort of bullshit. People don't seem to realize that the purpose of reading can be to have fun! So they come to reading with lightness. With a foot hold back.  My advice is: take the plunge. Dive into the book. Forget everything else. Make yourself a cup of coffee or tea. If you realize the beverage gets often cold, you're getting the grip. You're so absorbed by the book you forget about your drink. That's the spirit. If you realize you're getting distracted, re-read what you missed, consciously. Say the words if you need to, don't be ashamed of it. And find a position that suits you. I like reading with the book on the floor, layed belly down on the couch/bed with the arms by my side and only my head sticking out of said furniture, staring at the book on the floor. So what? I can't read sitting down like a nun waiting for the pope. I practice some contorcionism while I read, and normally end up in a moderate amount of pain.

When I started decreasing the time I spent on the internet, flipping back and forth through twenty different tabs, two things happened: my mood improved, and my concentration improved.

books,3duk96,fail_forward92,7,Sun Jul 19 16:53:15 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, there is no real average. It depends on your comprehension speed and the type of material you're reading.   /u/PisseGuri82 has suggested reading non-fiction to hone this skill, but I disagree. The best way to do this would be to read fiction and non-fiction at the same time. Pick something light and concise for your non-fiction choice, and something complex and deep for your fiction. What you're aiming to do is speed up your rate of comprehension. The faster you can read a word, identify its meaning, and analyze it within the context of the sentence, paragraph, and chapter in which it is contained, the more efficiently you will be able to identify the meaning of your own thoughts in English and translate them to physical words.   What I mean by this is that your thoughts are abstract processes. They occur symbolically, and often the most complex thoughts do not occur in English words (or in the first language of the speaker), they occur in pictures, feelings, emotions, and various other things I can't concisely describe. It is often the case with 'scatter brains' that their thoughts are many in number but sometimes incomplete, and branching in many different directions at once. They tend to lose track of one thought in favor of another easily, and they are usually juggling many different levels of thought at once (for example, level 1 would be a grocery list that you have to keep in your short term memory for later that day, and the thoughts would become more complex until, at level 10, you are analyzing yourself in the context of everything that is going on around you, including emotions etc etc). Level 1 thoughts usually occur in your first spoken language, so it is relatively easy to tell somebody what's on your grocery list, but if that person asks you your political opinion on each item of the grocery list (for a stupid example), it becomes a little bit harder to speak because you are combining multiple levels to relay your thoughts. Scatterbrains sometimes can't 'hear' their thoughts, either, in the sense that they can't focus in on what their brain is doing and accurately describe just what is going on.   So what you want to be doing is learning how to complete individual thoughts, and how to translate abstract concepts into English words. Fiction is a very effective way to do this. Although most people will say that non-fiction works are more complex to read, I disagree with that as well. Non-fiction books tend to explain concepts dealing with one specific area of interest, whereas fiction often combines various relevant concepts such as emotional expression, social or political analyses, period-specific observations, and a host of other variables. If you are analyzing and comprehending the fiction you're reading to the highest degree of complexity that is possible for your individual brain, you are actually absorbing much more information than you would from most non-fiction and at a much faster pace-- faster because you are not wading through pools of technical jargon and unfamiliar concepts, and are instead following a logically defined plot from its beginning to its end (exactly the way you want your brain to be working in order to communicate). Fiction provides the logical structure necessary for thought completion, but it also branches into other areas of thought necessary to keep a 'scatter brain' engaged. Non-fiction can and will do this, eventually, but after a few fiction novels you'll start gaining comprehension speed quickly. That's your goal-- read as fast as possible while still understanding what is going on in the book. You want to come to the end of a chapter or paragraph and be able to recall what happened without reading over it.   Another benefit to fiction for this process is dialogue between characters. You will have the distinct advantage of understanding at least one character's true thoughts while also analyzing what that character communicates to other characters. You can spend as much time as you want thinking about why which character said what they said and why it caused whatever impact that it caused.   The reason reading works for the purposes you've defined is because you are physically changing the structure of your brain as you read. When you are reading, you are analyzing an abstract concept (written language) to extract the concepts it is trying to relay by converting the words to their meaning, then converting that meaning to the symbolic language of your unique brain. It is basically the opposite process of conveying thoughts (abstract thought -> extract meaning -> convert meaning to English -> communicate in English). The more you read, the more proficient your brain is at following neuronal pathways that translate abstract concepts leading from the beginning to its end conclusion. Analyzing concepts in this structured way therefore becomes habitual, it becomes natural because you are activating the same crucial neurons over and over again. The more you read, the faster this process becomes, the more you will be able to structure your thoughts and communicate them from that structure. Your brain will modify the relative concentration of neurotransmitters and receptors at synapses according to how much you are using a specific pathway-- it will gain strength in the area you focus on.   I would also suggest that you take up writing. You don't even need to keep a journal. In fact, what I do is keep what is called a commonplace book. It's a small little notepad that I take with me almost everywhere. If I have a thought I can't figure out, I write it down. If I make an observation that inspires me, I write it down. I do the same for quotes, I draw in it, I doodle in it, I do whatever the hell I want in it. Sometimes I'm so scattered that I take an hour to myself and just write out my thoughts in an attempt to understand them more clearly.   You can also simply write in the margins of books you're reading (if you own them). Mark passages and dialogue which seem crucial to the plot somehow, organize your thoughts about the work on the page itself. Make comments, highlight inspirative text etc etc. Even just keep a notebook on you as you read. And don't be afraid to read a page more than twice, if that's what it takes for you to comprehend the words. People who go without reading for a long time often struggle with this, because their thoughts wander.  Anyways, that's all I can say for now. I'm a scatter brain myself, so if you need me to clarify anything just say so."

books,3duk96,littletuckoo,2,Sun Jul 19 22:37:05 2015 UTC,"I doubt anyone could give you a number, even an average. The more you read, the better you'll get, although reading by itself won't help--you need to actually practice writing and speaking. I think there's an important distinction to be made, which is that good writers are not necessarily good speakers, and vice versa. Personally, I believe that practicing to become well-spoken requires a progression of reading -> writing -> speaking. (I'm a very visual learner though, so ymmv)  Reading will expose you to different ways of expressing your thoughts, writing will help you order your thoughts and implement the things you pick up from reading, and speaking will hone your thought processes so you can say express yourself as clearly and efficiently as possible."
books,3duk96,LiterallyAnscombe,2,Sun Jul 19 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"The first step would simply be to seek a very broad background of knowledge, both so you have comparison between concepts, and so you'll have the freedom to make analogies between things that are not necessarily related. This background most of us find in cultural anthropology, history, and sciences, (especially about the topic of our expertise) which largely complement each other after a while.   The second is to find authors who simply write heavy sentences. This used to be why Latin education was so strongly encouraged in education, but you can gather some of the same affect by finding authors in the past and present who think very strongly about the rhythm of a sentence. For the past, I can't encourage Samuel Johnson's essays enough, as well as John Ruskin's work starting with Unto this Last, and Christine Rossetti's poetry. As to the present, Elizabeth Bishop's prose and poetry, Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man and essays and John Crowley's novels.  The third is simply to read authors that can write lightly about a great deal of subjects at the same time. George Eliot frequently wrote about common people while never forgetting either English History or Economic Philosophy, and nobody can write more satirically about what people think they're feeling quite like Dickens and Tolstoy.  I would really avoid putting a number on how many books are necessary, simply because some people need to start sooner or later than others, and becoming articulate by reading is not so much a process of education, so much as a world you're participating in. Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, to take two of many professionals, made clear that even while they were working through their experiments and writing articles, they were still searching out new philosophy to read and re-reading their favourites to come up with new analogies to describe their work to others."

The catch is that I'm 60 years old!  We started my sophomore year reading short stories.  When our teacher asked us to write about the stories, part of the assignment was to write in the style of the author, stripped down and terse for Hemingway, complex sentence structure for Faulkner, etc.  We only had to write a paragraph or two per story, but it helped us learn how great writers express themselves, and to find a voice and style of our own.  Give it a try."

But when you think of how skilled authors like Hemingway and Faulkner can fashion complete thoughts into their own style of sentence structure (I always appreciate the sentences whose perioda punch me in the gut!), it's the same way we fashion our thoughts into spoken word.  It sounds great of your teachers to train your writing by having you emulate some of the best."

Can't really put my finger on why I like it though. I guess I find the characters engaging and their life and mishaps are wierdly and absurdly funny.   The movie is similarly great but in my opinion more accessible. Plus the acting and the whole visual thing is really well done and that might be why I rewatch the movie instead of reread the book.

books,3dtk04,strangenchanted,4,Sun Jul 19 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"Some of my favorite movies based on books:   The Big Sleep - Bogart and Bacall. What else can you ask for? Well, maybe Nick and Nora Charles. The Thin Man - There you go, the witty, half-drunk banter of Nick and Nora Charles. The Maltese Falcon - Bogie again. Not as fun as The Big Sleep, but still a wonderful classic. LA Confidential - It diverges quite a bit from the hefty novel, but it's a fine work on its own right. I recommend seeing the film before reading the book (and you should read The Big Nowhere first). Jackie Brown - My favorite Tarantino film, and a great Elmore Leonard adaptation. Out of Sight - The other great Elmore Leonard adaptation. There's also Get Shorty, which I'll have to revisit. High and Low - Amazing crime procedural and drama from Kurosawa. I honestly love it more than his samurai films. Blade Runner - Classic sci-fi noir. Personally, I prefer this film to the source material. Well, I'm not a big PKD fan. Howl's Moving Castle - Finally, we leave the crime genre. This is a Miyazaki work, so you know it's worth seeing. Fantastic Mr. Fox - I'm a big Wes Anderson fan. This is one of his best. Personally, I like it more than Moonrise Kingdom. A Clockwork Orange - Not for the faint-hearted. Disturbing and powerful. A masterpiece. Women In Love - This movie is batshit insane. A bit unbalanced and messy, but what a cinematic experience. Misery - Nasty little movie, but if you love a tense, fraught thriller, this is for you. Hard to say if the book or the film is better. Clueless - It's the film that got me reading Jane Austen. Pretty lightweight, but it's entertaining and fun.    Some movies that missed the point:   The Hotel New Hampshire - It's supposed to be funny. Well, not funny exactly, but comic in some way. I don't know why the film isn't funny, or even memorable. Okay, it's not easy to make incest and all the other depressing crap in the book comic on screen. A whimper of a movie. Watch The Royal Tenenbaums instead, it's a lot closer to the feel of the novel than this lackluster adaptation. Breakfast of Champions - Never watched it, but there are some hilarious articles on the web about this movie. Probably a good idea to read those instead of watching this. Look up the one The AV Club did. This reminds me, I need to revisit Kubrick's Lolita. The English Patient - Not really a bad film, but it lacks the wonderful ambiguity of the source novel. And it's sappy, while the book is not. Watchmen - They're not supposed to be superheroes. Lots of good stuff in this film, but Snyder missed the point of the story. Love in the Time of Cholera - A huge disappointment. It's got Javier Bardem, surely it's worth seeing? NO. Holy hell, is it awful.  Memoirs of a Geisha - I love Zhang Ziyi but God do I hate her in this film. It's insufferable, except for Gong Li, she really stands out in this mediocre (if pretty-looking) film."

They were a huge part of my childhood, though, so of course they have a very special place in my heart. I just feel like there are so many little things that could have been executed so much better that, eventually, added up to make some sub par films.  I don't have much to say about the Jurassic Park movie versus the book, but it's worth mentioning (to me), just because of fond memories associated with it. In my seventh grade science class, we were assigned the book to read, then once we were finished, we watched the movie together as a class. That is probably my favorite memory of that class.  Not a fan of The Fault in Our Stars, don't think it should've been made into a movie. These feelings were exacerbated by my fourteen-year-old sister's hype over the novel/movie. Same applies to 50 Shades of Gray (minus the part about my sister).  As someone else mentioned, Clueless is great. I've never actually read Emma, but it's on my list, and Clueless is one of my favorite movies (even though it was released three years before I was even born... yikes).

I actually really enjoyed this movie in its own right; I don't necessarily feel that a film adaptation should be diligently faithful to the book. That said the whole point of the story is completely inverted by the ending of the film. People have pointed out that the alternate ending fixes this and it's true up to a point but it strikes me as pretty token in any case and it still fails to really hammer home the same point about the world belonging to a different group of people now...  Personally I feel that the vampires needed to remain vampires for the story to really work and I can totally accept that this would not have worked in the modern Hollywood climate, which is one reason why I don't actually mind the film being so different."
books,3dtk04,slightly_pretentious,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:39:47 2015 UTC,"I don't read a ton of modern literature, so your have to excuse my obscure references.  I think that classical literature very rarely works in movies. Far from the Maddening Crowd was awful, as is most versions of Jane Eyre, and Mrs Dalloway. I think the point is that books which are more focused on the inner monologues of the characters as opposed to plots rarely work you movies, they simply cut out so many of the beautiful nuances in the book.  On the other hand, TKAM, and Orlando worked extremely well, for vastly different reasons. TKAM for Peck's stunning performance and it's ability to capture childish innocence, and Orlando for its visually stunning, if not bordering on weird, filming.  I do, however, like most television adaptions of novels. I think when they are stretched into a few episodes, the director has the opportunity to examine the characters more as opposed to just focusing on plot. My favourites include the 90's version of Pride and Prejudice, which captures the development of Lizzie and Darcy's relationship acutely, and the 2004 version of 'North and South', where the complex, and sometimes paradoxical elements of Margaret Hale's personality is explored."

I had no idea how many Ebooks were available for check out. And the audio selection for my library is outstanding. Sometimes there are long wait lists but I just put a hold and when it's my turn it automatically checks out.  This might not work for book clubs but for people on a budget who love to read this is amazing. I have been reading tons of cookbook Ebooks and haven't bought a Kindle dAily deal book in months. If you have a small local library the selection might be limited. San Francisco just requires California residency so I've taken advantage of their huge selection.

With LOTR, Tolkien lays out massive amounts of history and ancestry, often times (and not as a knock to the text) quite blandly. This one begat that one. And LOTR starts right out of the gate with that kind of rattling off of ancestry, so it can be kind of a challenge to really get into it. Whereas HP starts as a children book, so it starts to build characters in a simple way, but as the text goes on, it gets more mature, but you already know most of the characters having built the history in simple terms. It just adds more emotionally mature layers.  Basically, I'd read HP before LOTR (and I reread HP at least once every year or two, less often with LOTR). But I would definitely read LOTR too.  As for the movies, I love the LOTR trilogy (it was efficient in laying out the stories and the sheer scale is awe-inspiring), not a big fan of the HP series (Couldn't tell you why). Also hated The Hobbit films (too bloated, distracting CGI and none of the humanity of the LOTR films). I know you didn't ask about the films, but if you move on to them after reading...those are my thoughts."

You're right about the bloat in LotR too... Which is not a criticism of JRRT, necessarily, it is what it is...  I would suggest, though, that more than the amount of reading OP has done overall, it is the amount of reading of older works that have different pacing and older language that is important. If you've read thousands of relatively recent novels all action-packed and fast paced and simply structured, LotR is probably not a good next read. If you've read and enjoyed even a few slower, older works it may well be..."

books,3dvsbm,bibliophile445,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:19:58 2015 UTC,"I have a similar problem right now, and I would say it's a combination of a focus problem (I'm really distracted right now) and the fact that I'm getting more picky. Going through phases in reading is normal and totally okay.  I trust my instinct with this stuff but I try to be sure to spend a dedicated amount of time each week to reading. So if I want to switch books, then I will switch. If the book really did pique my interest I will usually come back to it.  I have several friends who read two, three, or even four books at a time. It's okay to try that, too. Just don't waste your time on books you don't really like because you feel bad about ""not finishing them."""
books,3dvsbm,stubbytuna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"That's certainly happened to me, and it bummed me out for quite a long time. I would suggest less internet time, more time away from the screen and existing in the real world. For myself personally, when I spend a bunch of time on the internet, I am flipping back and forth between this article and that, this site and that, experiencing the empty joy of instant gratification. Now that I've been limiting my online time, I enjoy whatever I'm reading more, and I have a better chance of finishing the book. If you feel compelled, I'd also suggest meditation. It doesn't happen overnight, of course, but I have faith that you'll soon get out of the reading rut you're in."

I realized I was picking up books that sounded interesting but actually weren't when I started reading them. I had to find my genre, which is either Fantasy or Sci-Fi, at least for now.   You have to find your genre. I know I can't just hop around from genre to genre when I'm just reading for fun."

Firstly, Grover breaks down the fourth wall and talks to the kids directly. When kids turn the page, they are actively engaging and creating the story happening to Grover. That is a sophisticated concept for kids but it totally works.  Secondly, as someone else pointed out, one of the main themes is not judging things and people too quickly.  And finally, it speaks to the concepts around anticipation and regret, the inevitable passing of time, and, no matter how much we may want to resist, time will pass and we will all eventually die so we might as well just enjoy life as best we can. (plus, I have used this book many times to get (adult) girls back into my room. ""hey, do you want to come to my room, I've got the greatest kid book ever? I'll read it too you."")

Upon seeing this I am overcome by the memory of my mom reading this book in full character. She emphatically voiced every word of Grover, and really made me believe as a child that each page brought us closer to some spooky monster. It's funny really, seeing something like this and being overwhelmed all at once by how much I miss my mom; my god do I miss her and the way she read books. If there's one thing I can suggest it's to read to your kids as much you can and as silly as you can parents. Nothing can ever change that my mom is gone, but I will never forget the way she used to read us books and voice every character and how much fun it was for the whole family.

It was one of the most eye opening parts of student teaching I had, because I never knew how much thought is put into GOOD books for young readers. There is so much going on when a kid is learning to read, or learning in general, that you've probably never thought about.  Take this book for example.   The word MONSTER is in red each time it's printed? So that the kid can start ""reading"" monster the second or third time you've read it aloud to the kid? yes, please  Oh, showing an obvious progression of the story in the pictures, so that the child realizes ""man, we read books left to right?"" I'll take one.  Talk about the cover in the story to let the kid know the title is supposed to give an idea of what the whole book is about?  hnngghh  Build suspense of a monster at the end of the book (that the child is IN CONTROL OF BY TURNING PAGES), so that the child wants to finish and see what happens at the end?

In one way or another, the book found it's way into my life .    Fast forward to my son being born early, and a NICU stay.  The first time we made it out of the room to one of the family nights on the ward, they were doing Bingo.  We ended up being the only ones to show up.

I was always annoyed that people would have the book facing them to read the page, then turn the book to the class so they could finally see the picture.

books,3drlza,curmudgeon99,5,Sat Jul 18 20:46:37 2015 UTC,"Well, themes are near universal. Dostoyevsky's treatment of these themes, I think, is where you can see Dickens' influence most. Specifically, his focus on the poor and the desperate. The use of eccentrics. Endowing his characters with comic tics and quirks. Driving story in large fractions of his novels with dialogue.   Then I think Dickens soaks in some Dostoyevskian elements himself. I find the characters of John Jasper and Neville Landless in The Mystery of Edmund Drood could have stepped right out of the great Russian's work."

These theme (as well as objectivity and ""capturing"" life vs imagining it) are what influenced the Realist movement in writing (Flaubert, Zola, Maupassant, Tolstoy) a movement of which Dostoyevsky was a part of."
books,3drlza,NotActuallyCezanne,2,Sun Jul 19 16:55:22 2015 UTC,"For me Dickens is ""flowery"" only by comparison with the Modernists and with contemporary prose. In literary studies he is called a Victorian. The Victorian era of English literature incorporates some later Romantics at its start but eventually proceeds to a point that Realism predominates.  When you compare the Dickens prose style to the true Romantic prose writers (the Bronte sisters, Mary Shelley, Goethe in Germany, Poe and Hawthorne in the US), you realize his prose style (even in Pickwick) is much more like that of the Realists and even Naturalists (both of whom were prompted by Dickens' influence) than the Romantics.   So I'd say to you that in Dickens we already have the more accessible prose style (indebted to Austen, too) the great Russian Realists will draw from."

Ulysses, Gravity's Rainbow, Finnegan's Wake, Infinite Jest, the crazy doorstops, you know.    I think it's great to feel proud about reading, I think pride is a great motivator for the act of reading a book, along with motivators like growing knowledge and escaping reality and any other reason you can find.

It's described by Cortazar to be a ""counter-novel"". The first page contains a table of instructions on how to read the book, with the order in which one should read the 150ish chapters. It's around 700 pages long on paperback, 590 on the hardcover.

He, ironically, is known for writing really good endings. I suggest you try out the first book of either the Mistborn Trilogy (called The Final Empire or just Mistborn on some covers) or The Stormlight Archives (called The Way of Kings) to see if you like his other works more. You could also try The Emperor's Soul, which is a novella set in the same world as Elantris, but, in my opinion, is much better (and a Hugo award winner) - it won't take up much of your time."

I checked Amazon a few days ago - partly due to a discussion on the relative size of Sanderson books compared to another series - and considered grabbing the full first trilogy when I saw it was only $20.   I decided to wait until I finished Elantris since, as you know, a lot of authors write great concepts and just cannot stick the landing. After finishing Elantris today, I was really worried about continuing.  Since you mention he's known for good endings, I'm more optimistic, but I think I'll still wait for the library copy just in case.

Unlike Elantris (which is the weakest of his that I've read, and I definitely wouldn't judge his work based on it) he pretty much ties up every plot point in the end (even ones that as a reader I had completely forgotten about), the final novel has so many moments where I was just like ""Wait - what?!

books,3dsqpy,CompletePlague,2,Sun Jul 19 22:06:42 2015 UTC,"So, Brandon Sanderson is currently my favorite author.  I have read almost all of his published works (I have some catching up to do this summer)  To your specific comments:  Plot Device/A Mistake -- this is actually a mistake.  It's vague because Sanderson didn't have it worked out right in his head, and it is wrong.  He's actually rewritten The Mistake scene in the latest edition which is due out sometime-soonish.  Otherwise:  Sanderson's early work in particular suffers a bit from the avalanche effect -- he was better at setting things up than at resolving them, and so the end of several of his early works kind of crashes down upon you in a great heap at the end, with too much resolution all at once, leaving you with the feelings you describe.  The first Mistborn book suffers from this problem, though to a significantly smaller degree than Elantris.  His later works are progressively better in this regard.  Despite this being evidenced somewhat in Mistborn (especially the first book), I absolutely love Mistborn, and I hope you will too.  The initial trilogy (Mistborn, Well of Ascension, and Hero of Ages) tell a complete story that comes to a conclusion. (Each work has its own complete story arc as well, and Mistborn stands reasonably well on its own), so it isn't a gigantic commitment to give it a try."

During my teens I stopped reading and now I can only manage 20 pages per hour.   Obviously this has also got to do with the fact I know read books that are more challenging but nonetheless I would like to improve.
books,3dsr69,MiguelKoch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:33:56 2015 UTC,"20 pages per hour is ok depending on what you're reading. Are you talking about reading for fun or reading for school? And if it's for school, what subject? You can be stuck on one page of a quantum mechanics textbook for an hour, but for history 20 pages might be on the low side. Go to the library and find a book on speed reading. You don't need to be one of those really intense people who can do 600 wpm or more, but you will be able to increase your speed with a few tricks without reducing your comprehension too much. Skimming (which definitely reduces comprehension) might be good enough for some things you have to read. Being able to judge what is and isn't important in a text is one of the key things to learn to help your reading."

In my 11th grade ELA class where I hope to use the texts this year, I hope that gender roles and how they are revealed, questioned, and reinforced through literature will become a central theme, and hope that this collection will be one of the major ""texts"" with which to explore it.    In this case, since the question is about why someone would produce this text in this way: surely, food and nutrition - which was the theme of the World's Fair itself this year - still typify the place of women in many cultures; the novel was commissioned for a week or two focusing on women during the 6 month fair.   I, too, long for a world where gendered voices are not isolated, or given two weeks focus in a 6 month period, but I accept that the focus - like Latino Heritage Month in the US, which I also discuss with some distaste with my students - often allows for a focus that otherwise may not be had, and which is still felt and explored by writers themselves."

His and Franzen's emergency wall-breaks to protect themselves are very similar, sudden fictionally inappropriate signals of (usually) class inferiority, of threateningly uncollegiate manner or rural habit or unsophisticated consumption, sent bursting through the page.  Example from Wallace, since I have the book handy:   Do you think anybody cared about Victor Frankl or admired his humanity until he gave them Man's Search for Meaning?   One sentence later:   What if I did it to you? Raped you with a bottle?   You could say ""but that's his point,"" but it doesn't feel like it is.

books,3dsplx,StephenKong,4,Sun Jul 19 12:02:11 2015 UTC,"Franzen is basically hated because he's a grumpy opinionated guy who is willing to state his opinions even if it means getting people mad. He doesn't play the ""like/reblog/share!"" economy of modern technology where it pays to be super positive about books and authors all the time... unless you are attacking one of the preapproved targets like EL James or, well, Franzen.   I don't even like Franzen's work much, but the hate he gets is silly.   What are the roots? There are two main ones  1) In the early 00s he picked a fight with experimental and literary authors essentially arguing that good fiction is popular with readers and follows conventional narrative structure, and posing experimental literature as some kind of threat to good fiction. A lot of experimental writers took issue with this, especially because... why bother picking on writers that so few people read anyway? How are experimental writers a ""threat"" to reading when most people have never even picked up a single book of experimental writing?   2) The Oprah Book Club debacle where he expressed some ambivalence about being picked for the club, worrying that he'd be read as a beach read instead of as a serious work of fiction. This got him accused of sexism and cemented his reputation as an elitist literary snob.... despite item 1).   So. After the above, Franzen was kind of hated by BOTH the postmodern/experimental/forward thinking lit world AND the populist/middle brow fiction world. Not a great position to be in.   Then two pretty crappy chick lit writers, Picoult and Wiener, decided to boost their own careers by whining about how Franzen was getting too much attention for FREEDOM and claiming it was proof of both sexism and of ""popular fiction"" being overlooked. There IS plenty of sexism in literature, but the second claim is pure nonsense because Franzen is a massively best-selling author. The Corrections and Freedom both are in the top 10 year-end best seller lists... no Picoult or Weiner books are. So by their own logic, he should be getting far more attention.   Anyway, both of them have big twitter followings so they convinced an army of chick lit fans that Franzen was this evil literary snob. So now he was hated by the high brow/experimental set, the middle brow/Oprah populism set, AND the low brow chick lit world.   After that, every time Franzen whines about something--and to be sure, he does whine a lot--(twitter, global warming, whatever)--or says anything negative about an author (DFW, Salinger, Edith Wharton) he gets a swell of hate from all sides.  If he'd just sat back and been positive about everything and cheered everyone on, no one would hate him."

From what I remember (and Google it yourself if you care to fact-check), Oprah selected The Corrections for her book club. Jonathan Franzen made some comment(s) about how he didn't like that The Corrections was part of the book club because he wanted it to be treated as serious literature, not something that just middle-aged women read. Some people found his comment misogynistic. Some people accurately pointed out that the current publishing industry would not exist without middle-aged women. Oprah took The Corrections off the book club. Franzen has later made comments saying that the hubbub helped sell even more copies of the book than if Oprah had left the book in the club. I think they made up on-air at some point, probably when Freedom came out.  Anyway, he can come off as sexist sometimes. And I think for a lot of people he embodies the straight, white, intellectual male writer whom they dislike for being oppressive/self-obsessed and/or for being forced to read those types in high school."

When I met him, I'll admit I was a bit starstruck, but that changed throughout the course of the meal.

As for the ending, I think it's commentary on everything just read. It's a reminder that although of course it is a piece of fiction, there is truth in the story. Despite our awareness that people and events in fictional stories are created by the author, they really do have their own life. I know it's mainly a statement on the power of an author to do as he pleases, but we can see the power we have as readers too. Every reader will have their own reaction and connection. As readers we will have an experience separate from the author when they are creating the novel. Thus the author never has full control of what they make. Yet it remains a struggle because we are still observers.... That's mainly how I reconciled with the ending because it's kind of a cheap one honestly. It's similar to a kid's story where they wake up at the end and realize it was a all dream? But nevertheless it made me smile and think. :)"

Its rarely ever mentioned. It was my first book because it was suggested to me 3 years ago.   This book alone is responsible for the biggest change in my life since then. I became heavily interested in Buddhism. I've read countless books , attended numerous retreats, meditated here and there and I have integrated it into everything I do. The biggest change has been done recently. I have given up on my career oriented education and made it into my personal education. I've dropped two years of IT for moving into religions and philosophy. I'm  hoping to start in September. Should be fun.  I regret nothing because I'm a shadow of the man who was always questioning and being unhappy. I had a difficult life until a few months before this book. Too many words are  needed to describe my suffering. Id rather not mope and share a great story with ye. My childhood began after reading this book. That is how happy and interested I was in learning more because of this book.  So here's my review that no one expected.  I am aware that books are subjective. But I'm hoping that this book or that another book will have such an effect to inspire you further.      tldr for the lazy The book basically changed a person who had only known sadness and isolation for 22 years of his life into a happier, social person. Also the life in which in I now  live and will live belongs to this book, my starting point."

Aristophanes is the best comedic play write, probably The Clouds being his defining work. Philosophically, Plato and Aristotle are the go-to's. Thucydides and Herodotus for history. Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days are both excellent myth stories, In the Roman world, I personally love Ovid's Metamorphoses, keeping with the mythological theme. On the poetry side, Catullus is one of my favorites of all time. Depending on what genre you like, I can suggest different works. Apuleius' Golden Ass, Lucretius' On the Nature of Things, or Livy's Ab Urbe Condita. And of course the ""must-read"" Latin of Cicero. He wrote a lot of philosophy and letters, but his oratories are some of the best ever written, with In Catilinam being the most famous (and also the defining moment of his career).

books,3dqn30,rhcp6131,4,Sat Jul 18 22:51:07 2015 UTC,I don't agree with any before you die list. Everyone is different and everyone enjoys different things. I would be pretty bummed if I wasted my life reading 100 books someone else liked but ended up hating and then died.
books,3dqn30,raisin_reason,2,Sat Jul 18 20:55:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like half the books on that list were more like ""books to read before you turn 30"". Catch-22, To Kill A Mockingbird, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies, Brave New World, Things Fall Apart, Slaughterhouse-5, Animal Farm, Pride and Prejudice, The Great Gatsby... Many of those are on (and belong on) high school reading lists. I'd get rid of a bunch of those (not all). I mean, if we're talking about books to read before you die, maybe you want to branch out a bit, outside of the 20th/21st century American secondary school curriculum. I'd also get rid of any repeat authors. I'm sure Philip Roth is great, but does he really deserve 2 books on that list? Same with Virginia Woolf - actually, both Mrs Dalloway and To The Lighthouse are amazing, but like, it can be narrowed down (my vote goes to keep To The Lighthouse on the list). Lastly I would take out the completely irrelevant books (Clarissa?? Really?? I need to read that one before I die? I'll pass, and I don't think I'm alone on that.)   As for what I would add - I would definitely add some creative non-fiction, essays, books of poetry, and genre fiction. The list had little to no science fiction, mysteries, westerns. I can think of worthy books in each category. For creative non-fiction, it needed Joan Didion, of course. And for poetry, it needed one of Philip Larkin's poetry books. And like other people have mentioned, it needed more international literature, but I mostly read American works, so I can't contribute to the expansion of that front, but I support it."

You could go there a hundred thousand times, and that Eskimo would still be just finished catching those two fish, the birds would still be on their way south, the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole […]. Nobody'd be different. The only thing that would be different would be you. Not that you'd be so much older or anything. It wouldn't be that exactly. You'd just be different, that's all. You'd have an overcoat on this time. Or that kid that was your partner in line last time had got scarlet fever and you'd have a new partner. Or you'd have a substitute taking the class, instead of Miss Aigletinger. Or you'd heard your mother and father having a terrific fight in the bathroom. Or you'd just passed by one of those puddles in the street with gasoline rainbows in them. I mean you'd be different in some way – I can't explain what I mean.

books,3dsalu,domocke,3,Sun Jul 19 00:07:51 2015 UTC,"Practical advice - Listen to the audiobook while you are reading. If you can't focus on the words, then you are still hearing the story.  Machiavelli's The Prince and Voltaire's Candide were a bit difficult for me to focus on (both of them are available for free at https://www.gutenberg.org/ btw, along with other classic books); if you want to read classics (I'm talking before 1950 or so) you can find free audiobooks to them on YouTube, I just download the mp3 files and listen with headphones if I'm outside.  When people begin reading, they suffer a sort of mental fatigue since the idea of looking at words on a piece of paper is odd to them. It happened to me, and honestly, the only thing I can say to remedy this (based on anecdotal evidence) is to read often, consistently, and read things you want to read.   I like to compare reading to exercising: you don't start working biceps using 50s, you start at 10s then 15s and so on, in that same respect, establishing your reading habit with a book like Gravity's Rainbow (which, in terms of complexity/comprehension is probably a 7 out of 10) is going to end with your disdain. Start with something that won't intimidate you, and go up from there."

I find I get through the books much quicker this way (I also listen at 1.5-2x speed) as I have both the game and the story to motivate me to keep going.  Other than that, I guess I would start with books with short chapters. I'm currently reading The Martian (which I cannot recommend enough) and the ""chapters"" in that are usually 1-2 pages long.

I work for an online bookseller, and we use Amazon, so I've seen similar situations. It's most likely a few things are happening here.   Are they the only sellers with the book? If so, it's possible there's a messed-up pricing algorithm. Or they don't know the sales history and just put it up at a high price in the hopes of it selling for that much.   Most likely, they're no inventory sellers. They have their eyes on another website (Abebooks, Alibris, Biblio, etc.) or even at other listings on Amazon. The sellers see they can purchase the book for a few hundred dollars, sometimes far less, and put up a listing that is well over the asking price of other sellers. Someone might buy their copy and all the seller needs to do is order one of the cheaper ones, which is then shipped to their customer directly from the inexpensive vendor. Some guys in the business refer to it as drop shipping."

I wish I could be of more help, but this is what sparknotes has to say:   Analysis: Chapter 3  As the Director and Mustapha Mond explain to the boys how the World State works in an abstract way, the interspliced scenes of Lenina and Bernard show the society in action. The sexual play of the children at recess, the boys’ discomfort at the word mother,Lenina’s relaxed nakedness, and the conversation between Henry and the Predestinator all serve to illustrate how the traditional taboos regarding sexuality have been discarded. Bernard is the sole character to protest—almost silently—the way the system works. His discomfort with the commodification of sex marks him as a misfit. It is worth noting that the novel explicitly establishes that Bernard’s dissatisfaction with the State stems from his own isolation within it, introducing Bernard with the words “Those who feel themselves despised do well to look despising.” Bernard may be a rebel, but that rebellion does not come from any ideological objection to the World State. It comes from a sense that he might never fully belong to that society. This facet of Bernard’s character will be brought into play as the novel progresses."

books,3dqy1r,ilybicd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:00:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's absolutely necessary to enjoy this book, but I do agree that reading some of Camus' other works could broaden your understanding of this novel.  I'd suggest the novel The Stranger and the essay The Myth of Sisyphus. Probably the essay first since Camus does a pretty good laying out his idea of life's absurdity AND how man can be expected to cope in the face of universal indifference. Contrasting Clamence with Meursault, the protagonist of The Stranger, is particularly fruitful. Meursault is seemingly indifferent to the world and the effects of his actions, including the unprovoked murder of an Arab, he also never denies responsibility for his actions or their consequences. Clamence, OTOH, seems to want to talk himself out of responsibility."
books,3dqy1r,ilybicd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:57:04 2015 UTC,"Repenting? Not exactly. He's trying to unburden his guilt by making another person understand. He's confessing but not necessarily accepting responsibility for his bad acts.  The bar Mexico City that Clamence frequents is in the last layer of ""Hell"" which, in Dante's Inferno, is reserved for treachery, the worst of sins in Dante's view. Judas, Brutus and Cassius are all here, each being consumed by one of Satan's faces while Satan himself is trapped in ice.  Thus, the ""fall"" of the title is as much about Clamence's fall from Paris' upper class as it a reference to falling into Hell and sin. But the treachery that winds Clamence up in Hell may be less the bad acts he did to others as it is his wrestling to reconcile his bad actions with the belief that he isn't a bad person, or at least not any worse than anybody else, and, of course, that he may have been justified in what he has done. He betrays himself by neither adjudging the consequences as not bad nor accepting that his decisions caused them.  It doesn't sound like you've made it to the judge-penitent section yet. Keep reading. You'll see Clamence is not repenting so much as seeking absolution. Of course, since he is both the penitent and the judge, his appeals to a stranger in a bar (or to us, the reader), cannot really relieve him of his guilt."

Its unfortunate his son couldnt live up to his writing but still commendable that he tried anyway.  and yea it is amazing! Half a century ago and its so god damn relevant. Once someone told me that it was essentially an alegory for the oil crisis+Lawrence of Arabia the book kinda clicked for me. to me tho its more like oil crisis+LOA+Game of thrones :)"

To watch his rise in Dune only to see him being manipulated in some respects by his own bureaucracy and religion was at times hard to swallow - but it poses the interesting question of where does the true power lie, with the man or with the movement? Overall I liked it, but not nearly as much as Dune."

OH! and keep an eye out for the ww2 parralells in Watership! It's a whole nother layer to the book that's likely to be missed by a modern reader without the context who wrote it and when, but it makes the whole thing a lot more compelling.

books,3dqb82,aszymier,3,Sat Jul 18 12:19:55 2015 UTC,"This, from an old essay by Warren French, might help you get a handle on it:   Doctor Sax, which begins when the narrator is about eight years old, is Ti Jean's account of his discovery of the creative power within himself, a frightening but ultimately liberating event. The book is puzzling, however, because Kerouac never has his narrator explain what he is doing in this work; he simply presents the reader with a strange variety of situations narrated in a mixture of styles with which the reader must come to terms in a fashion similar to the way in which the incipient artist himself had to handle his perception of the talent that sets him apart from others. [...] Much of the novel is taken up with the narrator's struggle to break away from the reassuring comfort of his family and familiar scenes in order to internalize and exploit his new power. [...] Kerouac is trying to create here, possibly from early writings of his own, the kind of lurid allegory that aspiring fourteen-year-olds [write], a successful recapturing of the excesses of juvenilia that Joyce accomplished also in his A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.   It's fiction ""as performance,"" a pubertal novel of puberty. That's partly so the reader can (ideally) experience something analogous to what the narrator experiences, partly because real-life Kerouac was still (and always) failing to write himself free of Home.  I don't recommend doing this, at least not your first time through, but if you know Kerouac's life story and want to read Dr. Sax as poetic autobiography—not of his childhood but of the time when it was written—think of the Doctor as William Burroughs."

I was forced to read Atlas Shrugged as part of a college course on theories of government, and in the end I'd probably recommend it. You can skip most of the third part of the book, and especially the Galt speech, and still get most of the worthwhile parts out of it. The parts that are most valuable are those that are based on her father's experiences during the communist revolution in Russia (he owned a pharmacy that was seized), and the overall insights into human collusion of various forms, corporate and government. The Galt speech though is basically more of a fever dream.  Right now I'm reading The Full Catastrophe by James Angelos about the current Greek social/political/economic dysfunction, and much of it is way crazier than anything in Atlas Shrugged, such as the chapter on the guy who gunned down the town mayor and still couldn't be fired because of the constitutional jobs for life guarantee for civil servants in the Greek constitution. There's nothing anywhere near that crazy in Atlas Shrugged. Sometimes life is stranger than fiction."

My local church is pretty progressive, even by Methodist standards and opinions about Zealot were still a pretty even 50/50 split so controversial is pretty much dead on for that book."

I disagree with a lot of it, but Marx had some good ideas which can be adapted for a more proven economic system.

books,3dogsd,pyrespirit,3,Sat Jul 18 01:13:52 2015 UTC,Care to share the passage?
books,3dogsd,eselle,3,Sat Jul 18 14:26:24 2015 UTC,"Happy to!  The full passage is as follows:   The foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion, religion does not make man. Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man – state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d’honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion.  Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.  The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.  Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.   Rather than comparing religion to a drug, it instead makes the claim that religion creates an illness so that it can sell itself as a cure, and that the criticism of religion is to deny the illness that religion claims we suffer from which means that we simply have no need of it's ""cure.""  The part about ""the opium of the people"" is more about religion being a painkiller for the illusory pain that it claims we all suffer so that it can peddle a cure for us."

I have also never had to use the dictionary on my kindle as aggressively as I have when reading Miéville's works.  Some of these fucking words, man! ""perspicacity"" for instance. He makes me feel like I have such a poor vocabulary, haha!  Sometimes I don't know if the words he drops are real or made up, because he does make up a lot words.

I think if you like The City and the City and The Scar for their relatively more coherent worldbuilding you might like Railsea. To be fair, I think it's written with a slightly younger audience in mind, but I thought its world was one of his most interesting ones. Though of course, if you're particularly attached to Bas-Lag, I'd recommend his other Bas-Lag novels too. One thing I've noticed, and have heard mentioned, is that Mieville sort of has two ""types"" of books, one which is full of crazy creations thrown onto a page like idea-vomit (ex. Perdido Street Station or Kraken), and the other which is more of a focused exploration of the implications of a central wild idea (ex. The City and the City or Embassytown). I prefer the latter, but even his books that I don't like as much are still better than a lot of the fantasy I've read. And obviously some of the other commenters here seem to like the former more, too. So basically my recommendation is: keep reading his books and find out what you like!  (last thought I feel the need to throw out there - dude is fucking hot)"

I like series because I like to try to understand how a particular world works. I want to read of the Bas Lag books because it's such a complex and unique world.  I read that he wants to write a book in every genre; The City and the City is a dark police mystery, the Bas Lag novels are steampunk nautical adventures, and another one (I forget the name) is influenced by the American west. I can totally dig that. His books are very interesting and I will definitely read more.  Also, yes. He's a babe."

However I'm seeing a lot of hate towards him in this thread (as I do in any thread that mentions him) so I'd like to tell a story;  I read the Da Vinci Code when I was 16. Up until that point I had never read a book by choice, only when forced to by school (and even then I skimmed them) and I thought reading was a boring chore.   Then one day while I was stuck in an airport for a few hours with nothing else to do I wandered into a book shop, grabbed a book I remembered hearing mentioned on TV (Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code) and started reading. My copy was around 600 pages and being a very inexperienced reader I set myself the lofty goal to read 10 pages that day (and 10 per day thereafter) and I figured it would take me a couple of months to read. I read that book in 2 days.  It hooked me from the first short chapter and I went from probably never reading a whole book in my life to reading 600 pages in a couple of sittings. Since then I've read hundreds of books and reading has become one of my favourite activities. I've read books from a variety of genres, I've read long ones and short ones, and I've read ones far better and far worse than the Da Vinci Code.  So my point is this; no matter how much you hate a book, be it Twilight, Fifty Shades of Grey or Kim Kardashian's biography, don't be a dick about it. People are reading that book, people are enjoying that book, and many of the people reading it may never have read a book before. If an author like Dan Brown can get people like me into reading by producing thrillers of questionable quality, more power to him. He's given me what is probably the best gift I've ever received.  TL;DR The Da Vinci Code was the first book I ever read, and I owe Dan Brown a great deal of gratitude for showing me that books can be interesting, enjoyable experiences. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but don't be a dick."

There's absolutely nothing bad about Nickelback, people just love to hate them (particularly on reddit) for no reason other than they write easy rock songs that appeal to the masses.   Trash is trash. Why are books held to such lofty heights that no matter what tripe it is we say ""well, at least they're reading.""   Well I feel the same way about other mediums; even if you think it sucks don't belittle people who like it.

I don’t like Brown because he writes bad genre fiction. The plots are clunky as hell. The suspense is always tricked up by inserting a meaningless chapter break. And the seasoned intrigue/suspense reader sees his twists coming a mile away.   IIRC, in The Da Vinci Code there was a scene where they find a dead body lying on the ground, having scrawled a nine digit number in his own blood with his last dying strength. Many pages later, but not long after in the book’s realtime, pursuing the very mystery that began with the dead man and his nine digit number, they are confronted with a safety deposit box or something of that ilk, which, as it turns out, requires a nine digit number to open. The characters then spend about 1400 pages discussing the wonder of math and the number of possible nine digit number combinations there could be, bemoaning the utter futility of their ever figuring out how to open the safety box-like thing.   But then, finally, somebody suggests that possibly they ought to try that nine digit number that that guy had scrawled in his own blood with his dying breath about an hour ago – not that you can scrawl with your breath, but you follow the point – and they are all fucking amazed to learn that the nine digit number works.   Details may be off a bit, because that was the moment that I hurled Dan brown across the room, covers flapping like a bird, and I have never read him since."

That transmitted live footage of the bomb to them.  That transmitted live footage of the bomb to them.

He is one of the writers who can make your heart beat faster and make you forget about time. There are some repetitions in his novels, that is true (I have read each and every one), but the way he talks is unique, he knows how to keep your attention and all that is spiced with some historical background and great action.

Sure they grab your attention, but it's less ""oh my God I didn't see that coming wow I can't wait to see what happens next"" and more ""oh my God I've seen all this before it's so obvious I should put down the goddamn book why am I still reading"", especially since the plots of his books are basically the same thing (hell, all his prologues even start the same way).  It's a consequence of trying to write extremely intelligent characters while keeping the plot and explanations accessible to the average reader. He writes out of his field: while the historical underpinnings are constructed well, the science the plot rests on is inadequate. So there's quite a bit of Idiot Ball holding.   For instance, in Angels and Demons they spend half the book frantically trying to figure out where the antimatter bomb was, and I'm like for God's sake people it's transmitting a signal to you just trace the fucking signal, are you a world-class security force or nah. Another (I don't remember what book it was lol they all blur together in my head) is the one about the ""prime difference between the isotopes"". Like, U-235 and U-238. Difference. 3. The reader catches on long before this room of experts and while you're waiting for them to get it you just feel like throwing the book through a wall because it's making it look so much more complicated than it is.  Plus you can see the plot itself coming from a mile away (""Oh no! The wise older mentor was the bad guy all along! Who would've thought?"") because he uses the same ones all the time. That and his writing style is bland at best. To risk sounding like a snob, Hemingway's prose is short, to the point and easy to read too but you can't compare the writing in A Farewell to Arms and The Da Vinci Code.   Dan Brown's prose would be so much better if he could just stop with the metaphors. We get it, flowery writing isn't his strong suit, and that's not a bad thing. If he stuck with clean and punchy his style would be comfortable and excellent."

We used Angels & Demons as a sort of treasure hunt tour guide for the city to see what was real, what we could find, etc. We got to see the end of a wedding at one church where we were following a rose line. There were smaller churches and statues around the city that we wouldn't have bothered to look for otherwise. We walked 99% of the time and got lost a few times.

The godawful Lost Symbol made me never want read him again, and solidified the fact that he writes the same book over and over again just with a few details changed. And Inferno confirmed that yet again.   Also, the plot twists are laughably predictable to anyone who's ever taken Art History 101. Some of the MAJOR REVELATIONS were seriously stupid and obvious, like the location of the ""pyramid"" in Washington, D.C. Or Harvard art history professor Robert Langdon puzzling for days about mysterious gates in Florence, Italy. Hey professor, try the Gates of Paradise in the Baptistry, one of the top three biggest tourist destinations in all of Florence (and literally the subject of my first day of art history class in college).  It's easy to predict who's the villain in each book after you've read a couple (hint: probably someone you thought was your friend). There's usually a tortured flirtation in each book.

Its like a typical pop culture book, popular, somewhat intriguing, good ideas and plot (that sometimes don't fully make sense) but nothing that great.

The real backlash and hate comes from the fact that he is just so popular when there are far better writers out there. It's become cool to call him 'awful' etc ... he's not. He's ok and even good at what he does in that repetitive sort of way ... he's just not at the level of a Gaimon or Palahniuk.

It's quick, it's sloppy, it doesn't have any overarching themes or messages and exists to make you say ""oh SHIT"" instead of making you think.  You really need a strong ability to suspend your disbelief to enjoy books like his. But I'm someone that read through almost all of Matthew Reilly's catalog and he's Dan Brown but 10x worse, and I fucking love it. I remember one specific scene involved a 747 jumbo jet landing in the middle of a highway and engaging in a ""car"" chase with a dozen vehicles.   Basically, if you can't turn your brain off and enjoy movies like The Expendables or The Fast And The Furious you won't be able to enjoy ""airport fiction"" authors like Dan Brown. If you're over the age of 18 and you seriously take anything he says as true you really need to learn to think more critically about what you're reading."
books,3dn0mx,hallflukai,-9,Sat Jul 18 02:15:40 2015 UTC,"Short answer: a lot of people are snobs.   I worked at a bookstore when ""The Da Vinci Code"" hit big. It was a very weird phenomenon, in which an established author suddenly exploded seemingly overnight. I would compare it to the E.L. James eruption, but Brown had already been published prior, so I look at it more like when John Grisham first broke through -- lots of money, movie deals, popularity. It created a lot of jealousy amongst other authors.  Readers were divided, too. For the people who liked him, they considered it a popcorn read, something that they could read and enjoy and then move on from without any deeper consideration. Snobs, though, couldn't stand it. Their books had to have a deeper meaning, and had to be 1,000 pages thick and require a college-level course in lit theory to fully comprehend.  Secondarily, there was a rumor at the time that Brown had not actually written ""The Da Vinci Code,"" because it was so vastly different from his earlier books, all the way down to the style of the writing. I always figured he just got a better editor, but that big gap in his styles seemed to turn people off, as well.   All anecdotal evidence, but that's what I remember. BTW, thanks for bringing up a more ""current"" author, even if it is one I don't read. I see a lot of talk on these boards that just falls into the ""literary"" category, and it's nice to talk about something a little less ""classic"" and ""serious."""

The Briggs translation is an extremely easy, exciting and rewarding read. As I've not read any other translations I can't compare it but this translation is great in my opinion because Briggs translated all the French into English and simply included ""he spoke in French"" or phrases like that to indicate when French was being spoken.

I'm sticking with it though, this version has excellent notes and also a helpful part-by-part summary.  EDIT: But I don't know whether the comparison to Monte Cristo is fair though.

A lot of the more intense musical analysis is in footnoes (there are extensive notes at the back, some of them take up nearly a page), so you can skip them if that's not your bag.   The only thing that would've been better about it is if Swafford had given recommendations on which recordings of the pieces he's discussing to listen to.

Not usually my typical read but I read a glowing review in the Times and got a free copy and figured why not? Really a great writer and I loved her depictions of the female relationships in her life  Men:Notes from an Ongoing Investigation by Laura Kipnis-- Collection of sociological essays about masculinity.  I really enjoy the writer for her biting humor and sharp analysis, and it's an interesting coverage of pop culture icons.  Fiction:  The Scar by China Miéville--  My favorite sci-fi book ever.  Just masterfully written and has such an intense world / plot / AHH it was so good.  When We Were Animals by Joshua Gaylord-- Something of a coming of age story, with a gothic twist.  It had some of the most beautiful writing I've ever come across and I felt like I was in a hypnotic state I was reading it.    The Royal We by Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan-- This was basically really fun Kate Middleton fan fiction and I highly highly enjoyed it.  Great romance, equal parts cute and angsty.  Right now I am currently reading Picnic in Provence, a pretty good memoir about living in France, because I fucking miss France.  Listening to The Goldfinch on audiobook, which is taking me forever because this book is so long but definitely enjoyable.  Good narrator, although I think the book may have been a bit over hyped for me."

books,3dp4ub,turtlesandrobots,2,Sat Jul 18 11:17:25 2015 UTC,"I would advise against it. The first three books introduce some vital characters, I mean you could probably read a summary online but I personally enjoyed them."
books,3dp4ub,DaedalusMinion,9,Sat Jul 18 11:57:51 2015 UTC,Yes! Very much so.  It's one of the few series that actually keeps getting better the longer it goes.    After book 3 is when things start to get noticeably better.  The other books are decent but it get really good later on.

Figure ""hey, why not give it another shot?"" and read it.  Had it done by the end of the week. Plot was excellent, the characters felt great, and the villain was wonderful. I was missing backstory, but if you can deal with something like ASOIAF this won't be a problem. Butcher does a good job providing everything that's relevant. You could try repeating what I did, but there is a chronological order to the books. I'm still catching up on the early books (Caught up with #6-15, haven't touched #2-5) so I can't say whether the series immediately improved or not. By the time Butcher really got the series going though, it was good."

The books definetly get better as they go along.  Butcher improved as a writer a lot over the course of a series.  The plot complexity increases somewhat, but its generally always Harry and his friends, against dark forces.  The pervading theme of the entire series is that there's a current of evil trying to do some seriously bad things.  Harry starts out on the outside as a minor player, and over the series he slowly becomes a major player in what's going on.  But in the beginning he's just what he seems.  A magician detective who's desperately trying to pay his rent while not falling to the same fate as Victor."

Then Skin Game came out and blew Ghost Story and Cold Days out of the water IMO and I can't wait to read Peace Talks."

books,3dp4ub,holydragonnall,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:01:12 2015 UTC,"So, this is kinda old, but the thing about this series is that it continually iterates on itself to make the characters better and the story more compelling as it goes on. It also helps that Butcher has become a MUCH better writer over the course of the series. So in general, the Dresden files starts off kinda meh but just continually gets better as the series moves on, the characters grow, motivations get better, the setting becomes more entrenched, and everything starts to have cumulative effects on the world in the story.  Harry starts off as a small-time nobody and by the end of the most recent book he's a serious mover and shaker and has the attention of almost all the most powerful supernaturals and tons of connections to other characters both good and bad."

I let this subreddit tell me the 2nd one was better . . . I read it; it wasn't.  Then I let this subreddit insist that really the series doesn't get good until the 3rd or 4th book . . . I read them; it didn't.  The response was that the 5th book is where it all comes together. Lol. Did try listening to the 14th one on an airplane -- it was the same old thing: a middle-school wish-fulfillment fantasy with paper-thin characters and a tired by-the-numbers plot that didn't even try to present a compelling mystery.  I'm not inherently opposed to the genre -- Mike Carey and Ben Aaronovitch have written some similar stuff that's quite good imo and really ""works"" on the plot & character levels -- but Jim Butcher is not operating at that level."

At first I hated her for all her flaws and selfishness, but the books gives such keen insight into her thoughts and hopes and dreams eventually I found myself loving her simply because I understood her so deeply. I don't think I've ever been that deeply empathetic with someone so different from me before or since."
books,3dmz9o,Mystprism,5,Fri Jul 17 17:29:46 2015 UTC,Mitchell was brilliant in her ability to make us love a very flawed character. I also loved how well she managed to get us readers to understand the viewpoints of other characters (such as Rhett or Ashley) when Scarlett clearly didn't understand them.  GWTW is a great movie. But it really is an outstanding book. I understand all the reasons it was (and is) so popular.

So much more of it was about his early stand up days and the particulars of his career in television which is fine, but I was just under the impression that it was more of a memoir about an addiction and how it impacted his life interwoven with some real funny shit given the strangeness of the whole situation. What I feel like I read was a long winded series of events with a few too many overly prose-y elements that were misplaced and references that were just a little too look-at-me-ish.   Having said that, the same kind of attitue about that last part is what my friends say to me about why they don't like his stand up, which I love. Seriously I can't get enough it.

books,3dqtx2,maverick_ninefingers,15,Sat Jul 18 15:53:25 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna go through point-by-point. You make some really good connections but some of them are just extremely common tropes.   Kvothe discovers magical talents as a child   Not really. He gets taught by a sympathist he meets on his travels, whereas Harry was always destined to be a wizard.   Parents killed by Haliax/Voldemort   Sure, but this trope (tribe/village dying) is one of the most common in fantasy. And the result of these are wildly different. Kvothe has to fend for himself for years before he even gets to school, whereas Harry was brought up by family, albeit extremely abusive family.   Death Eaters/Chandrian   Lord of the Rings - Orcs  Star Wars - Empire/Sith  John Dies At The End - Penis Monsters  Stories usually have bad guys, and trying to make a connection between the two is reaching at best.   Attends blank to escape blank   Kvothe attends University because he wanted to attend University, which also meant escaping Tarbean. Harry is rescued from the Dursleys to attend Hogwarts, through no effort or knowledge of his own. But I will give you that ""leaving dire circumstances to go to betters ones"" is a solid connection.   Under-thing/Chamber of Secrets   Not even close. The Under-thing is the sewers, the Chamber of Secrets is an ancient plot-object.   Auri/Myrtle   Weird, quirky characters are weird and quirky.   Ambrose/Malfoy   School rivals tend to pop up in anything regarding schools.   Wilem & Simmon/Ron & Hermione   Main characters have supporting characters.   Fila/Cho-Chang   Love interests are love interests. The similarities between these two end right there.   Master Hemme/Professor Snape   I think the difference here is that Hemme had some good reasons to be hard on Kvothe, whereas Snape was just a jackass. Like the Malfoy thing, though, most fiction that involves schools will have the ""asshole teacher"" trope.   Arcanum/Restricted Library   ""Main character needs information and has to break the rules to get it""   Eccentric Masters   Any specialized master in any field is going to be eccentric by virtue of them being a master in that field. Every single professor I've ever had could be considered ""eccentric"". People that aren't eccentric don't tend to study Gregorian Chant for 30+ years of their life.  What you've stumbled onto is the idea of tropes. The thing is, stories are almost always made up of tropes. Especially once you have a lot of material to dig from (Harry Potter has 7 books, Kvothe has 2 lengthy books) you can dig up connections out of the wazoo and it doesn't really mean anything. For example:    Lord of the Rings Harry Potter    Eccentric Master Wizard (Gandalf) Eccentric Master Wizard (Dumbledore)   Everyday person given a huge task (Frodo) Harry   Big bad isn't at full power (Sauron) Voldemort   Big bad's soul is in another object (Ring) Horcruxes   Sarumon is a double agent Snape is a triple agent   The ring is a source of power coveted by everyone The elder want is a source of power coveted by everyone that knows about it   Gandalf and Sarumon have a falling out Dumbledore and Grindelwald have a falling out   The eagles are neutral to a fault The centaurs are neutral to a fault   Elrond tells a prophecy Trelawney tells a prophecy"

If you tried, people would call you tasteless and unrefined. Yet you do it against Rand, and suddenly everyone's nodding their heads?

books,3dn1wl,The_Parsee_Man,0,Fri Jul 17 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"Great thing about Rand's writing is, unlike the garbled sentence of the Modernists, anyone with a rational mind can understand it.  Here are a couple of my favorites:   She sat listening to the music. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they were the essence and the form of upward motion, they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean, and left nothing but the joy of an unobstructed effort. Only a faint echo within the sounds spoke of that from which the music had escaped, but spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain, and there never had to be. It was the song of an immense deliverance.   She likely wrote this while listening to a Tchaikovsky or Rachmaninoff concerto, but you don't have to know that in order to understand exactly what she's talking about. It's a huge, almost physical image of sound.   The great oak tree had stood on a hill over the Hudson, in a lonely spot of the Taggart estate.  Eddie Willers, aged seven, liked to come and look at that tree.  It had stood there for hundreds of years, and he thought it would always stand there.  Its roots clutched the hill like a fist with fingers sunk into the soil, and he thought that if a giant were to seize it by the top, he would not be able to uproot it, but would swing the hill and the whole of the earth with it, like a ball at the end of a string.  He felt safe in the oak tree’s presence; it was a thing that nothing could change or threaten; it was his greatest symbol of strength.  One night, lightning struck the oak tree.  Eddie saw it the next morning.  It lay broken in half, and he looked into its trunk as into the mouth of a black tunnel.  The trunk was only an empty shell; its heart had rotted away long ago; there was nothing inside – just a thing gray dust that was being dispersed by the whim of the faintest wind.  The living power had gone, and the shape it left had not be able to stand without it.  It was an immense betrayal – the more terrible because he could not grasp what it was that had been betrayed.  It was not himself, he knew, nor his trust; it was something else.  He stood there for a while, making no sound, then he walked back to the house.  He never spoke about it to anyone, then or since.”   This is a right at the beginning of Atlas, and it sets the attitude for and foreshadows the entire: the greatness of the earth, which had once seemed indestructible, all of a sudden obliterated. It's a very somber, chilling, and clear image.   What is the nature of the guilt that your teachers call his Original Sin? What are the evils man acquired when he fell from a state they consider perfection? Their myth declares that he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge—he acquired a mind and became a rational being. It was the knowledge of good and evil—he became a moral being. He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor—he became a productive being. He was sentenced to experience desire—he acquired the capacity of sexual enjoyment. The evils for which they damn him are reason, morality, creativeness, joy—all the cardinal values of his existence. It is not his vices that their myth of man’s fall is designed to explain and condemn, it is not his errors that they hold as his guilt, but the essence of his nature as man.

books,3dn1wl,lumloon,0,Sat Jul 18 11:37:03 2015 UTC,"For Rand, it's not possible for any novelist to write without a philosophical emphasis. She said somewhere (can't find the source) that the only reason she became a philosopher was so she could write better fiction:   The fundamental motive of a writer—by implication of the activity, whether he knows it or not—is to objectify his values, his view of what is important in life. . . . In this sense, every writer is a moral philosopher.  people only enjoyed it because it validated selfishness and lambasted altruism   Wouldn't that make you even more curious of the work, since people, who are just like you and me, would like something that goes against all explicit societal structures?  I won't go into the whole ""validating selfishness"" and ""lambasting altruism,"" since that's more a discussion of philosophy; but if you look a little closer, you'll see that when Rand says ""selfishness"" (read the second quote very closely) and ""altruism"" she doesn't mean them in the sense that most people mean them—she means them by the formal philosophical definitions of them. And based on what she valued, it follows that she would defend selfishness and reject altruism."

The latter two will literally stop their magna opera right in the middle, and talk to the reader directly; even though they're literarily brilliant, they have nothing to do with the plot. At least Rand has the courtesy of being both literarily brilliant and having a legitimate context in the plot for these ideas to be expounded (e.g., it makes sense why a strike leader would talk as long as he does in Atlas; he wants to explain the reasons for the strike).  Rand said that literature was composed of four indispensable and connected elements: Plot—Characterization—Themes—Style. If you read novels only for the plot, of course you'll find great works of literature tedious: there many other things to enjoy.  I didn't mind the monologues, since the person who recommended Atlas to me told me that it existed for the monologues, and that everything else is just exposition so you can understand them.

Went to store and bought all the others and had probably all the books up to confessor read in a month. Have reread most of them multiple times. Had me hooked.   Then my same friend recommended brandon sandersons way of kings. Such a awesome book. Word of radiance was just as good if not better. Cant wait for book 3 of stormlight.

It really introduced me to the whole idea of transgressive fiction, which is now my favorite genre to read and to write. A Clockwork Orange by Burgess and Waiting Period by Hubert Selby Jr. (author of Requiem For A Dream) were the books that kind of sealed the deal with that genre for me."

Brandon Sanderson is very good at his own books and finished off the WoT series, some loved it some hated it but think that was more because of where previous books left the series before he took over.  Malazan book of the fallen series is great very complex and multi layered but it's not for everyone jumping into the middle of an on going story arc."

It's amazing and I think I'm about due for my yearly re-read.  I'm not the typical reddit OMG GUISE THIS MAKES ME CRY! but there's definitely themes in the book that resonate pretty deeply after a few years deployed in Iraq/Afghanistan.  I'll be damned if the ending of the Crippled God (okay, most of the book) doesn't slam me in the gut every time.    Lynch had more than writer's block.  Guy had his whole life come crashing down more or less plus some mental issues that he's been quite open about.  I respect his not writing more than someone like GRRM because he's honest about it.  He's also been ridiculously apologetic about not writing."

So I went back two pages, still confused. Went back five pages, still confused. I ended up reading two entire chapters again and not understand this one sentence in a paragraph.

Wheel of Time is phenomenal for four books. Then opinions vary on when it gets too full of filler, but most everyone agrees book 10 was the worst, book 11 sets up a comeback and 12-14 (by Sanderson working to finish Jordan's story) knock it out of the park. I think the series overall is impressive, but there are chapters and even whole volumes I've encouraged people to skip, on the theory that if they actually finish the good ones, skipping (as bad as it sounds) is worth it.

Do you still like her in book eight? If the answer is no, skip all her chapters until book eleven. Skip the entire Faile saga until book eleven if you want - it just drags on and on and on.

General consensus over at /r/wot/ is that the main (not only) reason those felt so slow is that books 12-14 didn't come out for quite a while afterwards, so there was a lengthy wait.   Wheel of Time has top-tier worldbuilding, and the best dynamic character development I've ever seen. It may take you a while to get through it (when I re-read the series, I take about a year, but I'm just casually reading it, so ymmv), but it's worth it.

The section you're in now is my least favourite bit in either of the books.  I remember forcing myself to read it in one sitting just so I could get through it.  I just grabbed my copy off the shelf and found the chapter where I said to myself ""okay, finally, things are picking up,"" and that is page 246.  That is where you start to get a feel for what the rest of the book is like.  Just try to make it to there, and then the book will become a much easier/fun read (in my opinion)."

books,3dj68x,rra94,10,Thu Jul 16 21:33:08 2015 UTC,"Dune is amazing, and the rest of the series is good, but be warned - it veers wildly as you progress through the series in tone and subject matter. I think they're all worth reading, but opinions vary to say the least. Honestly, you can just read Dune and not read the whole series - it stands on it's own just fine. I do not recommend the novels written by his son unless you are absolutely in love with the universe created in the other books.   Wheel of Time is also a great series, but fair warning again - the first 3 (4? I forget where I feel he really starting losing the thread) books are fantastic, but as Jordan introduces more and more characters, the books start to get more and more split up into various story lines and the pace gets very slow. Jordan died before finishing the series, but left extensive notes and Brandon Sanderson finished the project, tying up a lot of loose ends, compressing storylines and getting the plot really moving again."

books,3dj68x,arcadium83,12,Thu Jul 16 19:54:08 2015 UTC,I know I'm about to get down voted to oblivion but I feel like I'm the only one who was not impressed with this book.   A friend recommended it and talked about how great it was so I gave it a try. I just don't understand what everyone thinks is so great about it. I found it to be mildly entertaining at best and generic and predictable at the worst. And the ending left me not even remotely caring about reading the sequel.
books,3dj68x,lordxi,7,Thu Jul 16 19:45:25 2015 UTC,"Nope, I'm with you here. I found the prose more thesaurus-bashing than genuinely well-crafted, the character of Kvothe unlikeable at best and a Gary Stu for whom the world bends before his feet at worst, the plot is tiresome and repetitive (how many times does KVOTHE NEEDS MONEY need to be done?) and it never fulfills the central premise of actually tackling how a person becomes legend.  [SPOILERS]  e.g. He becomes known worldwide as ""Six'String"" (wtf is that apostrophe there for?) because he played a lute with six strings once. Like, he does something mildly impressive, and for some reason everyone is immediately talking about it the day after and spreading it to everybody they know. That's not how mythologising works. Most myths are created posthumously, after the person dies and people just ascribe things to them because they were alive at the time and assume correlation between a person and event due to timeline similarity.  In fact, in the second book, we learn it wasn't actually exaggeration at all. People talked about him banging the magical sex fairy and surviving, and... that's not an exaggeration at all. It's exactly what happened.  He goes to the Ademre and gets invited to learn all of their secrets and is welcomed as one of them? Yep, again, that's exactly what happened. Absolutely no deconstruction, just accurate and factual accounts. Because Kvothe is literally that awesome and flawless."

books,3dj68x,SmarmySalamander,2,Fri Jul 17 07:34:14 2015 UTC,It seemed to lack depth... or actual events for that matter. There was really no (rhetorical) climax or resolution. Just finished the book wondering why I didnt learn anything about the seemingly awesome backstory.
books,3dj68x,PM_Me_Smiles_Pls,3,Thu Jul 16 22:28:23 2015 UTC,"The Name of the Wind is an amazing piece of storytelling, and a great book to cement a love of books, stories, and storytelling.  Book 2 might not be quite as phenomenal, but I'll happily read any book that's half as good as the Name of the Wind.   I'm jealous that you get to start The Wheel of Time at a time when the series is actually complete.  I basically gave up after book 8 or 9 and just got tired of waiting... It definitely slows down after the first 4 books or so, but if you can keep reading it through without waiting between books it's a lot better.  American Gods is great, but the best Neil Gaiman truly is the Sandman comics.  ""Preludes and Nocturnes"" is the first book, and it will blow you away.  Before you get through Gaiman books do yourself a favor and find Good Omens, because that will introduce you to Terry Pratchett as well.  That deep feeling of satisfaction from a well told story is found all throughout Pratchett's books, even when they seem like a funny light read.  I also want to through another mention on the pile for Philip Pullman.  If you feel like branching a little further outside of fantasy, I suggest Douglas Adams (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), and Kurt Vonnegut (Cat's Cradle, or The Sirens of Titan) are great places to start.  The truth is though, there will always be another marvelous book to read, you'll never make it through them all :D"

There's just way too much moaning about how all men are wool-headed fools. Most of the main characters have the personality of an angst-filled teenager. There are too many characters without much depth, a lot of names that are painful to pronounce, loose ends that get resolved poorly or not at all. Robert Jordan does a really fantastic job describing women's fashion, which is about 1/4 of the material. Really nothing good to say about this series."

The Wheel of Time is one of my favourites but it has issues.

This is not the same as ""debunking"" anything. AFAIK there is nothing in it that is actually ""wrong"" or even unaccepted by the anthropological community.

Diamond might not be right on everything, but from what I've read his critics are so up their own asses.   Here's a representative quote from the oh so eloquently named ""Fuck Jared Diamond"":    ""Everything Diamond does is motivated by an environmental determinism that takes the physical environment, including the climate, to be a determinant on human society. Diamond and his partners in crime, such as Jeffrey Sachs, argue that we can look to patterns of environmental change or geographical difference as a way to understand trajectories of human and social development and, by so doing, explain why some societies flourish while others languish in poverty or even collapse.""  ""Diamond won a Pulitzer Prize because he made this ridiculous, racist argument sound like common sense.""   Oh no! Apparently Diamond is racist, white supremacist and an apologist for colonialism.

I would recommend finding a list of books to read in an order that you will get the most out of all of the connections, if you do intend to keep on going. Personally, i would recommend it. (I would put king as he modern-day Faulkner, in both scope, and intricate contentedness of stories/ characters.  If you happen to be interested, below is my personal reading chronology suggestion for the Dark Tower multiverse: 1. Gunslinger 2. Drawing of the three. 3. The Stand.  4. It.  5. The Waste Lands. 6. Wizard and Glass. 7. Insomnia.  (This  point is where a lot of Dark Tower fans place The Talisman and Black house, i'm not sure it's essential, but they are good books.) 8. Everything's Eventual. Short story from the collection by the same name. 9.Hearts in Atlantis. 10. Wind Through the Keyhole 11. Wolves of the Calla 11.a. 'Salem's Lot.  12. Song of Susannah 13. The Dark Tower"

The weird religious woman is like a monster whore who's vagina wants to eat him. Spirit things that don't even have bodies are horrible whores that try to seduce and destroy him. Daughter of the guy at that gas station or whatever... whore.

Also, there's a program called 'Cold Turkey' that will block/disable certain sites on your device for as long as you choose. You can use it to kick social media or reddit for a few hours while you read.   Better yet, read somewhere lacking your devices.

Not having access to the internet. As banal as that advice sounds it works. I am 19 currently studying abroad in Japan, and I have no access to the internet most of the time, but I took a book with me even though I don't have the habit, I still enjoy reading - this contradicts itself, but I take a book with me, in a case where I do actually read it. However, I find myself constantly at a coffee shop or park bench reading. It's so amazing when you don't have the internet in your ear, or worrying about Facebook. You really need to travel to get the urge in you again, that's how I see it. Or just cancel your internet to rekindle the connection, otherwise you're just going to go on the internet instead of picking up a book."
books,3dojvr,drummmergeorge,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:45:58 2015 UTC,"I went through this exact same thing about a year ago. Used to read a lot, didn't for about 6 years, and decided to get back into it only to find I had developed a horrible attention span.   I think a comparison to running sums it up nicely: you have to work your way back up to it again. Just because you ran a marathon 10 years ago doesn't mean you could jump right back in and do it again today. Start slow- assign yourself 10 or 20 or 30 minute blocks every day, and stick to it. When your thoughts start wandering too much, put the book down and do something else. You won't see progress every day, but compared to last month you'll notice improvement. Took me about a year to go from 10 minute blocks to being able to read for hours at a time. Just stick to it, practice every day even if it's only for 10 minutes, and you will make progress."

(one thing that i would do if i was feeling punchy would be to ask the parent about their comfort level with violence relative to that with sex or drugs, like if they're happy to let their kid see human beings have their bodies mangled and destroyed in JURASSIC WORLD. this probably will not win the parent over though. then i would go on a monster rant about the MPAA and how JURASSIC WORLD and the relentlessly gruesome THE DARK KNIGHT and plenty of other murder-porn movies are PG-13 but the motherfucking BREAKFAST CLUB is R. it's R!!

books,3dj4gc,throwaway124365789,2,Thu Jul 16 23:33:23 2015 UTC,"Hi Jesse! When I saw the trailer for the movie, I knew the story was for me. Coming-of-age stories have always been at the top of my list, and I'm glad to say that Me and Earl and The Dying Girl is there, too. I want to explain to you how this process played out. I bought the book and spent the next two days reading it. I couldn't put it down, and the flow of it was just simply amazing. My humor is so in sync with Greg's, and it felt like something I could've just pulled out of my head and put on to paper. I tried to finish it in time to see the final screening of the first day it released, but I only got to about page 220 in the book by the time I had to leave to make it in time. I thought ""eh, fuck it. I can read it later. I need to see this movie today."" So I took the book with me and left my apartment. I went alone because I knew already that this movie was going to hit me very personally, and I wanted to experience it by myself. I drove an hour and a half to Nashville, as it was a limited release, and got to the theatre just in time. I sat down, the movie started, laughed more than I have in a long time. I just remember laughing as my life fell apart in front of me. Then I just felt everything collapse on my chest. I felt a level of emotional pain I haven't felt since I watched The Perks of Being a Wallflower for the first time. I don't know what it is about you first time writers and your soul crippling coming-of-age stories, but I hope you keep it up. So the movie ended. I sat in the theater until everybody left, and then I started hysterically crying. I don't know why it hit me so hard, but it did. Maybe it was the realization that I've spent my life self-loathing, or the fact that I am an acquaintance with everybody because I wouldn't let myself get too close, or maybe it was just seeing somebody realize that they could spend every day with somebody and never really know who they were until they're gone. Nevertheless, my eyes were opened and I left the theatre a different person. In Nashville, there's a place called the Opryland Hotel. The hotel is one of my few safe havens that I go to when I need to get away. I like to go in the early hours of the morning because that's when nobody's around. Luckily it was 1 AM when I left the theatre and I was in desperate need of this place. Inside the hotel is a sort of little town, kind of like what you would expect if you went to the outskirts of Italy, but confined within a building. There's river running through it, exotic trees and plants growing everywhere. It's amazing. Anyway, there's one spot where they have a waterfall that you can sit under and relax in solitude, so I decided to take my book in and finish it there. I spent the next two hours taking my time savoring the final pages of that book, and when I finally finished I could feel myself beaming. I realized that I had just finished one of the most relevant books I've ever read. I've never felt so closely to a book, even the Perks. I had one of the most beautiful nights I've had in a long time, and I owe that to you Mr. Andrews. Ultimately, my one question to you is how does it feel to know that words you've written can affect someone's life so immensely? I'm currently working on an English/Dramatic Arts degree here in Tennessee, and it's my dream to be able to make someone feel the way you made me feel with your book/movie through acting or written word. Even if you don't reply, I hope you at least see this and know that I thank you very much for bringing this story to life."

books,3dj4gc,_neutrino,2,Thu Jul 16 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"you know, truffaut did not have an enormous impact on the book. THE 400 BLOWS is much more of a touchstone for alfonso (gomez-rejon, the director of the movie) than it is for me—i saw it very long ago before i was really ready to pay attention to it. so it has much more of a presence in the script/movie than in the book.  greg gaines in the book has a much more haphazard omnivorous diet of movies—he just ate whatever was in front of him, like i did when i was his age."

I work in health care, and unfortunately have seen my share of devastating situations, and found you to be spot on with many things.  It felt like the point you were making is that we can find real humanity (and escape) in triviality. To me, Earl seems like the character who most represents the ""real world"" and Rachel a false reality that exists only in his mind. She comes into play when he discovers a need to come of age, and disappears when he accepts this.   Do you agree with those generalities? Was that your point-- that we can find meaning (and humanity/maturity) in the trivial?"

I'm currently in the middle of adapting a manuscript I wrote into a screenplay which is a very interesting experience.  My question for you is: What sort of jobs do you think someone with an English degree should go for while trying to publish their own book and also what is your suggestion for making dialogue sound more realistic as it is the hardest part of writing for me.

BUT, it's greg's story, and it's (among other things) the story of him learning to pay attention. which means that for most of the movie, he's not paying great attention to the people around him. it's a balancing act that becomes a lot easier when you get to hand it off to an actor as talented as rj."

books,3dnzkf,tcreo,3,Fri Jul 17 20:44:11 2015 UTC,"IMO, I think that the ending was up to a lot of interpretation. I read it earlier this year, and thought that the ending showed how everything has a beginning and end - same with Macondo and the Buendias. It also expressed a sense of ""lessened"" free will, because the entire history of the Buendias were inscribed in those scrolls.   I think that everyone takes something different out of the stories that they read - and One Hundred Years of Solitude can give you so many different morals and interpretations during each read. I personally believe that the story served not only to discuss free will, but the importance of memories and how we think. Everything is connected within the book - each character is related in some way or another for the most part, and the interaction with other characters define the present and shape the future. For example, some characters are forgotten immediately after they die, while others are brought up continuously even after they die. I think the ending showing the scroll containing the entire history of the Buendia family served to tie together the interconnectedness of the family's past, present, and future."

books,3dnzkf,rollingbackup,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:24:44 2015 UTC,"I think that maybe solitude is only tangentially related to Macondo's downfall.  Instead, I believe that the towns eventual demise is due to the fact that the Buendias' were unable to cope and learn from their past mistakes, and were therefore doomed to repeat it.  Consider the train. Sure, it was marked as the downfall, but in my opinion, it was only the downfall because despite this rush of new technology linking Macondo to the outside world, the Buendias' still remain in their solitude and continue to do what they have been doing for generations past. Therefore, when the novel reaches its end, the Buendias' are being punished for their inability to learn from their past mistakes, and their experience with the railway just exemplifies the fact that the family is completely unwilling to look to the future. The world moves on, but they don't.  So finally, when the baby born of incest has a tail, Garcia Marquez is linking the end of the story to the beginning, where this superstition was mentioned heavily. This creates another link between the mistakes of the past Buendias generations and the current ones, which result in their destruction.   Essentially, those who don't learn from their mistakes are bound to repeat it, and if you repeat them, things are not going to end well."

books,3dlu93,LoioshDwaggie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:02:45 2015 UTC,"Two recommendations for you that feature excellent, clear prose. One fantasy and one science fiction -  Mistborn: The Final Empire by Brandon Sanderson - Sanderson is recognized as one of the most clear authors in terms of prose. His characters have motivations and goals that are presented to the reader and his narratives flow naturally. Sanderson is the author to take with you when you need a break from literary criticism and want to love to read a good story. (Fantasy)  Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie - Soft sci-fi that focuses on the unique form of relationships that science fiction / future worlds can provide. The primary story focuses on a unique being who has suffered a great loss and is trying to define what it is to be her when her purpose and powers have been taken. -- Ann's writing style is lovely, but the best feature is that she brings a unique touch to science fiction. If you'd like an alternative (it's so hard to distill to just 2), The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin is fantastic. Both wonderful authors with unique takes."

She's off to meet her new employer, and take over her new command.  She's no longer a Commander of Fleet... now, she's the Captain of the good ship Sweet Delight -- a ridiculous pink-and-purple pleasure yacht owned by one Lady Cecelia de Marktos a Bellinveau, off on a voyage to Lord Thornbuckle's Estate (that is, his private planet) for the fox hunting season (yes, like chasing foxes on horseback, french horns, the whole anachronistic bit.  What else do you expect the amazingly rich families of the galaxy to do with their time?)  The first volume is relatively self contained, and follows more or less along the lines of my blurb.  Afterwards, however, it expands, and you get a much more interesting view into the functioning of the society of the Familias Regnant (the interstellar realm for which Fleet is the space navy, and of which Lady Cecelia is a peer), and it gets even more interesting."
books,3dlu93,LoioshDwaggie,2,Sun Jul 19 07:48:16 2015 UTC,"Given your list, I suggest three for you:  A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge is probably exactly what you are looking for if you want a unique science fiction experience that thematically fits in with Dune, Lost Fleet and Old Man's War. Actiony but not a war book. Vast empires, but not political. It's a great one. Phase 3  Pandora's Star by Peter F. Hamilton - If you like the war fighting of Lost Fleet and Old Man's War, but wanted a bit more character to your characters, Peter F. Hamilton is your guy. The duology starts slow, with the discovery of worm hole technology and the impact of that on the future of humanity, but it is filled with numerous fascinating characters and species. Distilled, it is far future fascinating humanity and aliens. Phase 2  Leviathan Wakes by James S.A. Corey (pen name of Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck) - This is my #1 recommendation for your tastes. If you've read Daniel's fantasy you know he's an incredible talent with clear prose and wonderful characters and together with Ty they've made an incredible series. Follows the exploits of a far-too-honest man caught in the middle of a war he wanted nothing to do with. Hard sci-fi in terms of the physics of movement and technology.

books,3dlu93,LoioshDwaggie,2,Sun Jul 19 02:34:42 2015 UTC,"Ender's Game is a young adult book that follows a highly skilled tactician being trained for leadership. It is a good read and significantly better than the movie, but not darkly themed or suspenseful. It's more like an action movie (think something like Oblivion)  Dune is a political novel about a galactic-spanning empire, writ-small. It focuses on a single planet that is critical to the powers of the empire, Dune, and the fortunes of one house forced to administrate it.   Dark without depressing, suspenseful, but cool - Blindsight by Peter Watts. It's a difficult read (in that the plot is a little hard to follow). If you're looking to get into novels I'd suggest saving Dune and Blindsight for later.  I have three odd-ball suggestions for you which I will explain:  All My Sins Remembered by Joe Haldeman - You like action but want something darker where no one wins and every move could be your last, this is your book. It's a dark, suspenseful, great read. Single book, short and well written.   Kushiel's Dart by Jacqueline Carey - You want The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, but like something with more depth and a more expansive world. It's a fantasy story set in a world where the Son of God believes truly in love thy neighbor. The protagonist is a skilled courtesan who is ripped from her life when her master is murdered. Bereft of friends, outcast and hunted, she must find who destroyed her family and is out to kill her.  The Warded Man by Peter V. Brett - Set in a world where demons are slowly winning the war against humans, one man sets out to hunt the killers of humanity. Dark, gritty, suspenseful and filled with action and mystery, this is a great start."

books,3dlu93,LoioshDwaggie,4,Sat Jul 18 22:28:10 2015 UTC,"Very wide selection, if you could give an idea of what specifically you like (prose quality, character or cultural focus, first person or third person, etc) it would help, but here's a few:  Accelerando by Charles Stross - This is a single book that covers all aspects of transhumanism from augmentation's affects on the individual, to society, the loss of, and progression in the far future. This is my highest recommendation for a single book on transhumanism.  The Quantum Thief by Hannu Rajaniemi - Human personality stored as a memetic fractal, a society based on post-humanity transition to thought, and a prison where every participant is you playing a never-ending Prisoner's Dilemma against other versions of you are just the start of the fascinating transhumanism series. Note that the main protagonist is mostly human, we see things through his eyes.  Count To A Trillion or The Golden Age by John C Wright - These are two series one unfinished and one finished. Count To A Trillion focuses on a literal transhuman who experiments on himself to increase his awareness and intelligence and deals with the fallout of that. It's a wide-ranging series that follows humanity through millennia of transformations (both forward and regressive) - It is incomplete at this time. The Golden Age is a trilogy that deals with post-sentience in the far future of humanity. Both stories follow an augmented protagonist dealing with a primary conflict. I suggest these lightly in case society is your interest over the internal conflict of a transhuman. -- NOTE -- There are issues with this author's views on culture (like homosexuality) outside of his novels. So beware if you do not wish to support that kind of author.  Pandora's Star by Peter F. Hamilton (but more in particular, the sequel series The Dreaming Void, Temporal Void and Evolutionary Void) - Follows numerous humans and post-humans and transhumans all in conflict or working together. One of my personal favorite series, but the real focus on transhumans comes only in the second series, so lightly recommended.  Blindsight by Peter Watts - Cannot believe I forgot this after writing all this up. A book that features a crew of transhumans out to discover and understand an artifact. Peter's breadth of research (he's a marine biologist) makes for a case of fantastic oddities and unknowns all interacting together. Highly recommended provided you do not mind some dense and difficult prose.  My #1 recommendation for you if you want coverage on all sides (societal, first person, third person, and holy shit borg people who are actually okay menwomen! is -- Revelation Space series by Alastair Reynolds - Please make sure to follow the suggestion reading order as all of the short stories and novels integrate in a complex tapestries of transhumanism and follow difficult cultures and players as they move in and out of interacting with each other. The first short story begins with a tale of a man welcomed into a borg-like culture and follows his changes and adjustments to that world. Wow!   Sorry for the long post. tl;dr version: Read the 'Great Wall of Mars' short in Galactic North from Alastair Reynolds followed by the novel Accelerando by Stross."

books,3dlu93,joshburnsy,2,Sun Jul 19 01:49:27 2015 UTC,"A Clockwork Orange is my favourite ever book! high five  The first Burgess book I bought after Orange was The Wanting Seed. It's more of a typical dystopian novel and depicts a world where overpopulation has become such a problem that homosexuality is prescribed and heterosexual relationships are scorned (the production of babies is very often punished). It's kinda bleak and gets steadily more interesting with the introduction of group human-meat barbecues and outdoor orgy parties... Not too long a book though.  An odd suggestion: The Old Man and the Sea by Hemingway. For most of his books, Hemingway's incredibly minimalistic style is difficult to get into and is very much an acquired taste. The Old Man and the Sea, however, is very short and very simple (relatively). In my opinion it is as elegant (and even beautiful) as it is simple."

books,3dlu93,joshburnsy,3,Sat Jul 18 23:46:22 2015 UTC,"Cool man, no problem :) I hope to read Mozart and the Wolf Gang by Burgess soon - its form is really crazy in that the entire book is a dialogue between many different composers in heaven. IIRC the form of the novel itself is an attempt at a literary rendition of Mozart's symphony No. 40, which (as a music student) blows my mind.  Interestingly, it's partly because of my interest in music that A Clockwork Orange is my favourite book. The whole book is written in sonata form, in that: the first section (the 'exposition', if it was music) introduces and develops the main material and motifs; the second section (the 'development') develops and departs from these themes, introducing new ones (e.g. the setting moves from the streets to the prison); and the third section (the 'recapitulation') returns to a restatement of the opening themes (e.g. setting changes back). Further evidence is the prominence of classical music in the book, and in such specific details as (for example) the use of the sentence, 'What's it going to be then, eh?'. Notice how this exact sentence is used to introduce the first and third sections of the book (as well as the final chapter)? As if it were the opening melody of the exposition, repeated to introduce the recapitulation (exactly as would happen in a sonata)? Anthony Burgess was actually an amateur composer and in fact has written some pieces. He loved to experiment with mixing these two art forms, which is partly why I love his writing.  But I could go on and on - sorry for the bombardment. It's something that I've read up on and find incredibly interesting, and I thought a fellow fan might appreciate the knowledge too!"
books,3dlu93,874920781543334,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:26:53 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. Thanks for sharing this information. Clockwork used to be my favorite book until I watched the movie and no longer saw Anthony Burgess as an innovative novelist rehashing forgotten portions of the psyche in a fascinating way, but instead as a conniving propagandist. Movies are honestly disgusting, they ruin everything.   Anyways, I'm musically inclined but not musically talented, so most of what you provided here sounded like jargon to me but I can sort through it and get to the general concept. That's honestly intriguing. I'm sure that having the mathematical understanding of music as you do allows you to bond with the author's work in a unique way. Clockwork is probably one of those strange artifacts you'll keep forever, hard copy.   I'll probably never read the book again but I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate your post and your relationship with this artform."

There's always Watson's ""The Double Helix""; the treatment of Rosalind Franklin remains an unrighted wrong, it gives a pretty unbalanced view of Linus Pauling, and Watson has since become a eugenicist, but it's still a readable, first hand account of a major discovery (the structure of DNA), and properly supplemented is worth reading.  If you like the personalities behind science, there's a book called ""Free Radicals: The Secret Anarchy of Science"" by Michael Brooks that covers the topic of 'scientists behaving badly', and although I have some issues with the writing itself, he did a great job of finding stories that more people should know about, particularly from the modern era."

His biggest problem is Coates using deliberately visceral imagery, which is probably not that shocking given the tradition that Coates says he tried to write in (edit- e.g. he's invoked James Baldwin in interviews).  Maybe Coates is glib. The book was rushed to publication after all! But how the hell is it not glib to follow ""You distort history"" with the frankly forced narrative of ""There’s a Lincoln for every Jefferson Davis and a Harlem Children’s Zone for every K.K.K?-- and usually vastly more than one?""

Violence is embedded in America, but it is not close to the totality of America.   The American dream sullied is not a lie. The American dream of equal opportunity, social mobility and ever more perfect democracy cherishes the future more than the past. It abandons old wrongs and transcends old sins for the sake of a better tomorrow.    This dream is a secular faith that has unified people across every known divide. It has unleashed ennobling energies and mobilized heroic social reform movements.    By dissolving the dream under the acid of an excessive realism, (imagined oppression?) you trap generations in the past and destroy the guiding star that points to a better future.

I've talked to someone else about the title and their interesting theory was the first bad man was the kid she baby sitted long ago and then continued to reappear as different people throughout her life.   I think one ongoing theme in the book is the dichotomy of satisfaction and harm in interpersonal relationships, especially those involving idealistic fantasies and the entropy of that fantasy, especially in unconventional relationships, especially between eccentric individuals with incongruent perceptions and values.  Every relationship is a complex interaction of expectations and realities, giving and taking, wants and needs. Most relationships are born in simple desires which will often become perverted and compromised. Ultimately the idealized fantasy is turned on its head.  The child-parent relationship is one of the most fundamental and it embodies these concepts well because the baby is a blank slate with no preconceived notions about relationships. It is easy to create pure beliefs about your newborn child. But everyone knows the parent child relationship is doomed to disharmonious passages and actually the lack of expectations and experiences, the one-sidedness of the relationship, is what makes it ultimately so easily turn to dissonance.  A baby is only wants, needs and taking. The first bad man is a recurring archetype in your life. It is the first failure of interpersonal harmony, and then it's every failure after that, especially the failures that are born in optimism. one day, your own child disappoints you, and even if only for a moment, your child is the same first bad man you recognized when you first realized perfection doesn't last and everyone disappoints.   That sounds grim, which is reflected in the purposefully frustrating and obnoxious characters in the book. However, I think the epilogue shows that in the face of impending disappointment you still have the valid choice to remain optimistic, and that choice itself can change the outcome of two people's interaction."
books,3dmiik,TheKnifeBusiness,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:18:08 2015 UTC,"To be honest I just felt the title referred to the phrase it was used in within the book, when Clee and Cheryl were acting out the gang attack video and Cheryl couldn't work out which of the gang members Clee was pretending to be:   ""What are you doing?"" she hissed. ""I'm over here.""  ""Which one are you?""  (...) ""I'm the first man,"" she said.  ""The one in denim?""  ""The first bad man.""  It was the way she was standing when she said it - her feet planted wide, her big hands waiting in the air. Just like a bad man, the kind that comes to a sleepy town and makes all kind of trouble before galloping off again. She wasn't the first bad man ever but the first I'd ever met who had long blond hair and pink velour pants.   So in that sense I thought 'The First Bad Man' as the title just referred to the changing point the Clee and the fights have on Cheryl's life, and not to any literal man.  I don't know.  I just don't think I could go for describing Kubelko Bondy as 'bad' for her; even though logically we know she's going to have fights with Jack at some points in their life and that the relationship is bound to be destructive as well as constructive, I don't think she thinks of him - or Kubelko Bondy - that way.  I think she thinks it is wholly positive.  Personally I don't think that's what the book is fundamentally about.  Loving another perspective, though.

I'm pretty biased when it come to making books into movies though...I tend not to like them as much because so many of the little details that make the book so magical get lost.
books,3dmu13,StephenKong,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:32:48 2015 UTC,"The most difficult question is whether a novelist should ever publish their early, previously uncirculated works. Of his first three books, Carey later concluded, “They were no good to start with, and they hadn’t gotten any better.”   That about sums up my feelings about most previously unpublished works. But I still think it's cool if they're published anyway. Like it says in the article, fans of well-known, beloved authors are often hungry for more works. I know I would read the heck out of Joan Didion's screenplays. If previously unpublished works are really no good, they'll go back out of print quickly anyway, no harm no foul. Interesting read and food for thought."

The Stranger is still great, but it's almost a philosophical parable or allegory, a story to drive home Camus's absurd, while The Plague is a much more complete novel. The characters are the richest I've ever seen, the prose, even in translation, was hauntingly beautiful, and the plot is captivating."

If you're just starting it, I must say it does get better throughout, in my opinion. I know for the first 80ish pages I wasn't loving it but later on I did fall in love with the book.   What I liked so much about the book is how Camus manages to portray human behavior throughout the novel. Be it from the descriptions of daily life in the city and the monotony of the routine and the city before the plague, to the way that Rieux's team tries to pull themselves together in the face of adversity. The characters are all very well developed. Joseph Grand and his novel, and the old man that counts time by passing peas from one bowl to another are two descriptions that have stuck with me ever since I finished reading the book."

I was pretty crushed when I found out most of his recent output was not available in English because of this (IIRC he refused to have it translated by someone else, as well) because his critical work was good enough to make me want to read everything he had written.  I'm glad that he's begun to translate his work into English again, though, because he is a consummate talent and Wizard of the Crow is one of the best novels I have had the pleasure of reading.

In college, however, I kind of want to say The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle or Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami.   All of these novel(la)s had some sort of important effect on my thinking. Of Mice and Men was the first fiction I'd ever read that induced such strong emotions and sent me on a quest to find more like it, and my love of literature solidified. I found Cannery Row to be interesting because it used an unfamiliar (at the time) narrative structure and for the most part seemed rather plotless yet somehow kept me enthralled the whole time. Kafka on the Shore was my first encounter with Murakami and it was the first thing I'd ever read that was so weird in content and structure, and even though the Kafka Tamura narration focused on the minutia, it still managed to captivate me. This is the book that re-ignited my love for reading in college. I read The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (also by Murakami) while I was going through a period of depression and anxiety and the novel felt like kind of an escape as well as I was able to really identify with the protagonist at that point in my life."

Usually a couple times a year it will come up on here and lots of us have a similar tattoo inspired by the book. The final chapter/line is the best ending to a book I've ever read. I got a little sidetracked halfway through because it's very long, but just keep on truckin'! Happy reading!  Edit: I just saw your second question and yes, it absolutely is! Admittedly I went to his alma mater so reading Faulkner was hammered into me as an English major pretty hard, but I recently read Light in August solo and it was wonderful.

You're either swept off your feet from the beginning and you won't see the pages go by, or you're not, and then I suggest letting the book down, it'll be a bore. If you do like it, it's extremely entertaining, as the characters are both all too human and extraordinary, and though it's all exaggerated it's also incredibly true - you recognize people you know, or yourself, situations you've seen or lived on every page, because we're small, we're great, we're beautiful, we're ridiculous... and Cohen shows it all.  It's beautiful, hilarious, incredibly sad, grand, petty... all of life is present in these pages, and you can feel the love of the author for it all."

I thought it was full of cliches, that the flashbacks were awkwardly written, and full of tedious amounts of preaching by both Jean Louise and Uncle Jack.  I think that initially, Harper Lee tried to fit too much into one book. It was a journey of mediation, of self-contemplation, of romance, of the grey areas of right and wrong, and of political friction in the South. The reason TKAM is more critically acclaimed is that it adhered very closely to the 'rite of passage' and social critique genres, and Lee didn't try and do anything weird with the passage of time. Very few writers that I have experienced have successfully recounted past events without some degree of self-analysis, and Harper Lee is unfortunately not one of them."

They work things out over time instead of an apology or sexual encounter wiping it all away. In the end it strengthens their bond. I think they are one of the most realistic romantic relationships I've seen in a book.  I like Jamie and Claire, too, but I think they're more codependent on one another. Romantic, yes.

That he got away with it all because of his social status and financial situation and was left wondering if he imagined everything because the people around him were too superficial and too selfish to suspect poor invisible Patrick Bateman. Upon reflection, it would be pretty easy for someone like him, in his position, to get away with it. I also think the book did a much better job of showing his level of insanity, it wasn't just about killing and gore, he was also doing shit like running down the streets screaming like a banshee in between going to work and dinner parties. I always thought it was Ellis' statement on society, more than on mental illness."

I think he leaves it ambiguous enough in the book to let readers decide for themselves, but it is so much stronger a statement if Bateman did do everything he thinks he did. It makes for a more solid conclusion toward society than it does if he just made it all up... besides, if he did make it all up then Ellis wrote the book to be goreish, and I don't think he meant to make it a slash piece."

books,3djj3f,italkyoubored,14,Fri Jul 17 20:36:25 2015 UTC,"interesting take on american psycho here:   A two decade old novel might seem appropriate now, of haves in glass towers and have nots protesting in the streets, a book which is supposedly either a literal story of an investment banker who is a serial killer, or an investment banker who only imagines that he kills a series of men and women, his murder spree a “metaphor” for his profession’s indifference to larger society and the damage he does to it. Curious about whether this book would shed light on the turmoil now, I found a third theme – the book is a cryptomorph, its subject neither mass murder, or a metaphor for the financial world, but about being gay and closeted during the first years of the AIDS outbreak. This is not a case of a symbolic undercurrent; almost all the male characters, including Patrick Bateman and Timothy Price are gay closeted men, with that aspect of their lives, off-stage and unspoken directly of, but most certainly there.

books,3djj3f,Bernie_Crane,11,Fri Jul 17 00:00:56 2015 UTC,"Brett Easton Ellis has this nasty habit of trying to be vague/open-to-interpretation but not quite pulling it off. I always thought moments like the flowers trying to mask the corpses smell and the real estate lady showing clear recognition of him as being too far off into the ""he did it"" territory for me to think it was just in his mind. You can easily excuse ""I just had dinner with Paul Owen in London ten days ago"" has his lawyer not knowing who Paul Owen actually is. I mean, in one conversation he calls Patrick three different names. Plus, Detective Kimball mentions that someone else also managed to misidentify someone for Paul Owen."
books,3djj3f,TheTranscendent1,6,Thu Jul 16 20:08:26 2015 UTC,That makes sense as well. I'm pretty on the fence of the whole thing. I feel like the real estate woman wouldn't report the mess left by Patrick in order to sell the apartment at full price. Also the whole thing where the cab driver recognizes him on a wanted poster for killing Sully cements the he did kill thing. But the poster could've just as easily been someone else considering all the yuppies look alike
books,3djj3f,Bernie_Crane,3,Thu Jul 16 20:14:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is that you're also hearing things through Bateman. Part of Bateman's frustration is that he BELIEVES he's just a useless cog in the machine- you're hearing his twisted version of the world. So it would make sense that you start envisioning things that align with your views.   The fact that Bateman believes he murdered is way more important than the question of if Bateman is actually a killer imo. These ""killings"" happened even though this book is fiction, and just because (if) they happened in his head it doesn't mean it didn't happen.  By leaving the text ambiguous the author can simultaneously do 2 things:   If the murders DID happen: Critique society's social structure- how does he even get away from this? This IS unusual, after all. If they didn't: Critique society's social pressures- why does he need escapism so bad? Perhaps he isn't even psycho... he's just one of us, an American ""psycho"". We all have escapist fantasies.   I'm not really a ""whatever the author says goes"" type of guy (because that ruins the point of reading and discussing), but for what it's worth:  ""Regarding the murders, I was always on the fence about whether they were fantasy or real.

When he wrote Lunar Park he said ""of course he didnt"". When he was on Marc Marons podcast he said ""I dont know, man"".   For what its worth, though, if he did kill them and got away with it, I always assumed it had to do with patriarchal/white supremacist undercurrents of upper class WASP society. Straight white men running the game and doing as they please. Unchecked privilege etc.."
books,3djj3f,Bernie_Crane,4,Fri Jul 17 01:22:23 2015 UTC,"I always figured he did it and the reason no one cares was because of the time period it was portraying. This is when people got raped in Central Park in broad daylight with no one helping. This is when people were killed in front of an apartment building with people watching and no one calling the police.   In my mind, the murders happened and no one cared because (like Bateman) everyone was completely self engrossed. It wasn't about privilege, it was about individual egos trumping the care for others."

The second time I read more carefully and came to the conclusion that it was all metaphoric, it really works either way.

He clearly has some form of mental illness and/or substance abuse problems, but because he's good looking, wears the right clothes, eats at the right places and all that other stuff, the people close to him point blank refuse to see that there's anything wrong with him.

Amazon made it possible for small publishers (like our company) to be successful in a marketplace that was originally dominated by a few large publishers (the Big Six). The Big Six functioned like an oligarchy, and now they are crying foul.   The Big Six are pissing themselves now, just like the music industry did before them. They failed to innovate, and failed to pay their mid-listers a living wage. So when authors began to jump ship in droves (like Joe Konrath and Barry Eisler), the large publishers started to panic. And they're still panicking, and complaining. That's been their only response.   Amazon has competitors in the marketplace (like B&N) but they are powerful because they deliver a good product in a timely fashion and they pay better ebook royalties than traditional publishers.   Traditional publishers could do more to compete with Amazon, but they would rather complain."

However it has nothing whatsoever to do with how Amazon has treated competitors, publishers, traditional authors, and - in the long-term - readers and book-lovers.  The Big Five (it hasn't been ""six"" for almost two years) aren't ""pissing themselves"" - they are doing their job, creating careers for writers and content for readers, and juggling the risks and costs and adaptations of their industry.  This comment is simplistic, zealous, and uninformed."
books,3djj6n,WakeUpOnFire,3,Fri Jul 17 21:37:58 2015 UTC,"A nice narrative, but it is still ignoring a lot.  It's funny you bring up small presses - Amazon's ill treatment and manipulation of (established) small presses was one of its first notable controversies. I've noticed that the only people going out of their way to defend Amazon are typically either dedicated customers who don't have much of the information, or they are people like self-publishers who are already tied closely to Amazon's platform, like yourself.   It's also funny that you would cherry pick a few authors who ""jumped ship"", in a post that is all about many highly-successful authors making statements to the contrary. Just as they did in the Hachette controversy. People whose entire lives are formed around the book industry are trying to give the public an important message about a legitimate issue.  It is always good to think critically, but ignoring such a clear outcry of concern is selective reality.  As far as the major publishers - there are certainly things that could be better, and believe it or it, they seem to know this. Publishers large and small have struggled with Amazon's market control and resulting leverage. That is one of the big complaints here - that the financial strong-arming by Amazon is killing the midlist and making an already risky business even harder. Publishers in my observation are actually trying to push more innovations, opportunity, and diversity than Amazon, who is still essentially a gigantic retailer weilding its power as both an effective monopoly and monopsony - see also, Walmart. There is no viable argument that having one entity in control of an industry could possibly be desirable, and that is Amazon's implicit long-term goal.   It seems like a case here of having only one side of the story."

You believe that major publishers ""seem to know"" there's a problem? I haven't seen any evidence that any of the major publishers are trying to come close to Amazon's royalty share. Why don't they just pay their authors more? It really is that simple.   I only mentioned Joe and Barry because they are two of the most vocal authors in this game, but there are thousands of others who share the same opinion.   Kiana Davenport, a bestselling and highly respected Hawaiian author, discussed years ago about how she was almost driven to suicide by the treatment of her major publisher. She ended up publishing with Amazon's imprint, and leaving her ""big"" publisher.   Some of the worst abuses are in the ""pink ghetto"" (romance), where almost everyone is a mid-lister. Harlequin actually created an offshore company to ""license"" content back to themselves. This translated into abysmal royalties of about 3% to their authors (who were supposed to be making about 50% of the cover price). The class action suit is outlined here: http://www.harlequinlawsuit.com.  Just reading the details of the suit, these abuses are recent. Harlequin is the biggest romance publisher on earth. Harlequin wasn't trying to compete with Amazon, and make it ""better"" for their authors. They were doing exactly the opposite. They were actively trying to pay their authors less money than they contractually agreed to pay. So many of their authors left, and are now self-publishing on Amazon's KDP platform. And most of them are making more money. Can you really blame authors for jumping ship?  Authors deserve to be paid fairly for their content, especially if they have an existing fan base. People have a right to be critical of Amazon, but don't blame authors for wanting to get paid a living wage."

They have used anticompetitive strategies, such as extreme below-cost loss-leading, to undercut any reasonable competition or producer viability - which is only possible due to Wall St. investment and their lucrative ventures outside of bookselling (as opposed to the usual paths of success, such as generating profit. They dominate online book retail, despite rarely reporting profits). And having thus created such a prominent platform for consumer access, they are able to leverage untenable terms with publishers and authors. There is a history of this.

If Preston wants to make the argument that Amazon's market power has led to less expression or a less robust marketplace of ideas, doesn't he also have to acknowledge that by making self-publishing easier and more lucrative, Amazon has enabled people who haven't been able to access traditional publishers to reach an audience? If anything, I would say that the marketplace of ideas has become far more robust over the past few years.  I don't really see Preston making an argument that Amazon has broken any laws. I see some examples of how the DOJ and the courts have handled other industries in the past, but very little that explains how decisions made about those industries are relevant here. There are many substantial differences between Comcast and Amazon. Comcast is in a business where the barrier to entry is enormous. It's often the only cable TV provider or even the only broadband ISP that people have access to. By contrast, anyone can buy books on whatever website they want.  A lot of this seems like people appealing to high-minded ideals in order to advocate a position that's financially beneficial to themselves."

The soreness was not a permanent thing, it goes away after 2-3 weeks once your body gets used to the fact that you're doing manual labor for 10-12 hours a day. Plus it was good money considering the job required no skills and they gave me the night shift I asked for so I could interview at internships during the day, knowing that I wouldn't be there any longer than I had to be(most companies wouldn't hire me when they learned this).  It did get hot in the warehouses on the few times I was there during the day but they were installing cooling units when I started there and those brought it down to a much more reasonable temperature. When I finally did quit because I had found an internship I was glad to be done with it but honestly if my career fell apart or something and it was back to near-minimum wage jobs again I'd probably apply there again while I figured things out."

books,3dmbwq,akdrag,13,Fri Jul 17 12:57:10 2015 UTC,"I've honestly never understood this (and similar) point of view. Invariably, the book and the movie are different. Not only different media, but also different tones, paces, and sometimes even characters and plots. There's no reason at all why the existence of one should affect your enjoyment of the other. What the movie-watchers experience when they watch the movie differs almost entirely from what you experience when reading the book, so this response doesn't make sense even if we accept ""fairness of experience"" as a valid reason for upset.  Beyond that, the possessiveness of such a response is worrisome. The whole thing centers around the idea that the story was somehow yours and that the unwashed masses getting to experience it as well, without putting in the time you did, is simply unacceptable. But whatever gave you the idea that your experiences should dictate the experiences of other people?  An analogy: I really like apple pies. I particularly like homemade apple pies. I enjoy the smell of them while they're cooking, the sight of them cooling on the counter, the anticipation while waiting for them to be ready, the crunch of a perfectly-crisped crust, and, of course, the taste of the apple filling. But do you know what else I like? Those little individually wrapped apple ""pies"" you can buy off the rack at most convenience stores. How bizarre would it be if I got angry at Hostess and such for making these things for no other reason than that it allows other people to experience apple pies in one or two minutes while I spent hours waiting for and enjoying the homemade version?"
books,3dmbwq,RCHO,5,Fri Jul 17 13:16:18 2015 UTC,"I think it's a little bit closed minded to sweepingly generalize people who enjoy movies as 'slobs and fanboys'. I mean really. They're different art forms entirely. If a book gets made into a movie it has no (or certainly shouldn't have any) bearing on your enjoyment of the book.   You don't enjoy films, you prefer books, that's fair enough but I think it's worth re-evaluating your opinion. A movie adaptation being made makes no difference to anything you care about; the book you love is still sat there on the shelf for you to enjoy.   Whether or not the movie is better than the book is entirely subjective. The Cohen Brother's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men for example I think was better than the book. Anybody who has seen the movie isn't in a position to opine on this because they aren't in a position where they haven't got the movie's scenes in the mind. I read the book first, and the iconic scenes in the film such as the gas station scene and the motel were really brought into flower with the movie and that adaptation helps the book on subsequent readings in my opinion. The book was rather monochrome I thought, first time round. The film improved on it immesureably.   They each have their own merits, films and books. To just deride all film watchers as slobs and fanboys betrays a certain immaturity, if I'm being brutally honest."

That is fucking crazy, and also utter nonsense, you aren't experiencing the book, you're experiencing a different work of art. It's like saying 'I hate all these ugly greek statues, I can't believe they ruined all those great ancient myths!' You mention the Shining, you claim it is an 'imitation' of an original piece of art, have you read the book? The movie is not only exceptional, but it is clearly a separate aesthetic undertaking. It's a little pretentious to be so closed to the notion of films as art. But then again this entire quote is pretentious, honestly. 'But when a good book gets adapted into a movie I get really angry I mean slobs and movie fan boys just that in that experience which I have treasured for months or years in just under 2-3 hours.

The book universe is not 'better' that's super naive and immature, I didn't actually know that was your quote, I am assuming you are in highschool or middleschool? Just a grammatical hunch. Again it isn't 'bad', but it's super pretentious to say every book is better than every movie. Like I agree, an astonishing work of literature can't be turned into a film, but that doesn't mean film is not art. For the record, though I like king, the novel 'The Shining' was a tedious and petty little ghost story, the movie was turned by Kubrick into a work of genius. That's my opinion. And not that it matters, but I am making judgements on inane comments, like, it is easy to judge that quote, because it makes you sound like a cock who thumbs his nose at everyone else for watching 'simple' movies. I'm sure you think video games and fantasy novels are the only respite for the challenged intellectual like yourself, but when you get a bit older you might realize there is more to aesthetics than 'BOOKS R GR8T I M NRD LOL'."

After 2, that's how you knew the Potter movies were gonna be great, same for the Martian.  I typically won't watch a movie adaptation of a book I disliked like Time Traveler's Wife or the Lovely Bones.  Who care's what every one else's experience with the book is?  I'm sure that you've watched a movie that you didn't know was adapted from a book.  I can guarantee the readers of the book didn't give two shits what you, random stranger, thought.  You said ""slobs and movie fan boys,"" mentioned the Martian, and Stephen King, which leads me to assume you're talking primarily about fantasy/sci-fi, and horror adaptations.  You should know that there are classics in these film genres that transcend their original source material, enhance it, or flat out beat it out, not the least of which is the Shining (which Stephen King hated bc it deviated from his book so much, which caused him to authorize another Shining adaptation in 1997), Solaris and Stalker, both by Tarkovsky, Under the Skin, Blade Runner, Children of Men, Game of Thrones, and Fucking Minority Report.

You'll 'always have Paris' - the memories and feelings that were created in you.  The adaptation of books into movies/television not only can encourage people to read more by seeking out the books, but gives people with different ways of spending their leisure time the opportunity to enjoy great stories.  The relatively recent introduction of the masses to traditionally geeky/nerdy/fringe media is a good thing. For instance, the popularity of the movie versions of Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, the Marvel movies, the Dark Knight trilogy, Game of Thrones etc. It can bring people together, give them common ground, lessen the stigma attached to otherwise fringe interests. It brings out the inner geek in the 'regular people'."

I mean, I knew it would bad be going into it, but I went anyway because apparently I am a masochist and it was worse than I could have imagined. What a waste. But the good thing is that when books are turned into bad movies, they are forgotten pretty quickly. The Giver movie only came out a year ago, but already I don't think anybody remembers it.  Sometimes you do get movies based on books that aren't bad, just different, and I recognize that I feel a little bit prejudiced against them just because I got to the book first.

That could all be complete rubbish, and the two of them might be getting along well, but it is an interesting thought nonetheless.   I was slightly irritated by the book's lack of cohesive explaination for the environment. The Father does internalise some thoughts regarding the beginning of the event that led to the calamity, but the longer that the premise is read into, the less sense it begins to make.   In summary, the goal of the father and the son is to travel south along the road to escape the grips of winter, and presumably they have been placed somewhere around the west coast of North America. They start either around Canada or Washington, and gradually head south, until at the end the boy reaches an area similar to San Francisco or San Diego. At some point they do walk through a mountain pass and spend a short while at a ski resort, so possibly they took a diagonal route through Colorado, but there is where my grasp of the geography falls apart.   The boy was a baby at the start of the event that ruined the world, and is 7 or 8 at the time of the book. That means that there has been that many winters which they have lived through, and if memory serves me correctly, the mother had already vanished some years before. I wonder how the urge to flee didn't come sooner, or years sooner at that. The road has almost spiritual significance as a path which the survivers have gradually trickled down for some time, so those with the urge to seek warmer and stable land had been doing so for some time. I wish that McCarthy had better explained why the father had left it so late.   It has been many years now since I read the book, and I might be wrong on a few of my now quite hazy recollections. I've always very much been the sort of person to seek reasoning behind each action, rather than get any enjoyment out of the simple emotion of the whole experience. I kept on wondering why the whole endeavour couldn't have been resolved by fleeing south as a whole family years before, perhaps before the other survivors had either perished from scavenging the world barren or turned partially barbaric and resorted to cannabalism."

The biblical aspects to me, mixed with the late travels show me a hope in a dying faith; a hope that something will protect them. In a way, they have been protected from the cannibals since everything started. They're ""carrying the fire."" The hope is mixed and confused, which makes me happy McCarthy didn't explain it more. It gave more sorrow and more hope. It was like seeing a light in a tunnel that no one knows it even there or existent. Maybe that was the fire he was mentioning..."
books,3dm170,Dawens,2,Fri Jul 17 14:49:08 2015 UTC,"I will concede as I did before in my excessively long original comment, that the time that has elapsed since I read the book has made my recollection of it hazy and incomplete.   As to the setting of the book, the lack of any proper nouns used to refer to the locations in the wasteland, as one might expect from a story about a world where old meanings were lost and stripped away, I took a warm place in the south to be Central America. From that I deduced that the road must be on the western half of North America for that connection, rather than the east where the travelling pair would have reached the coast of the Gulf.   I have long had a problem with writers speculating that, given a catastrophic event which could plunge civilisation into collapse, it's population would so rapidly deteriorate. All evidence to draw upon from societies actually being uprooted would all suggest that knowledge of the past is clung to orally with complete devotion, and at no point would the Father ever just give up on his old understanding of the world. Pure hope and animal desperation would be the emotions of the child - being the one with no a priori concept of the world before - but instead it is often the child who behaves with a brave degree of stoicism and endures after his dependency literally kills his father from over-exertion.   In conclusion, it might be worth giving it a second read one day, but I do not share your favouritism for the work, if you'll pardon me for feeling that way."

Midnight's Children, for example, could just as easily be described as an alternate history / urban fantasy. White Teeth is also a family saga. The Handmaid's Tale is dystopian fiction.  For me, the whole debate is flawed because it assumes literary fiction and genre fiction are two mutually exclusive categories, something I find not to be true. Literary fiction is more 'worthy' and 'meaningful' than other fiction, because that's all that literary fiction means. The term literary fiction is increasingly genre-blind, and the literary fiction vs. genre fiction debate is becoming increasingly meaningless."

That we use them in discussion with friends is just because they have become shorthand.  To my mind one of the best novels ever written is Master & Margarita, which is, essentially, a fantasy, as any Faust tale is, and is also a work of the highest literary order. It also satisfies the requirements listed by OP, namely that it is deeply philosophical while utterly detached from conventional reality."

Hard and fast truth of it is, genres themselves exist so that booksellers and publishers can market books to the right folks, and genre-ist behavior in criticism (whether literary or popular, and make no mistake, those are very different creatures) exists so that one side can feel more important, more vital, than the other."

Two books being equal, if the author has to additionally flesh out a non-real world/timeline/what-have-you, I think it would necessarily take some focus away from the pure vision.  Besides that theory, I feel like it's also borne out empirically with what has been produced in both genre fiction and literary fiction (not much of the former can be held up to the latter).  I don't think your friend is right about definitive limits like ""half the impact"" though, or that all genre fiction has no thematic or philosophical merit.

This kind of ""genre"" really does exist too, bookstores are filled with it.  BUT BUT BUT ""genre"" also refers to books that are every bit as artistic and meaningful as ""literary fiction"" but just happen to feature some tropes that we've clumped together and called a genre.

Are richly detailed paracosms and thoughtful commentary mutually exclusive?""  Personally I find the separation from reality in most fantasy books to actually bring a greater degree of insight and transformation to my world view. This I believe is because having a fantasy world allows the reader to vicariously engage the characters free from real world prejudices and social patterns. I can be entirely open and honest with other worlds in a childlike manner as I ultimately control the depth and consistency of my engagement. As my perception of the real world is formed from my internal choices and notions then these can be wholly open to transformation when reading. Which in turn if I experience very liberating reading material my experience and thoughts there are then in turn projected back into reality. So for me at least there is a real marriage of the symbolism and themes in fantasy and the style of influence it has in my day to day life. Hope that's helpful!"

books,3dim1p,ItsDannyFields,2,Fri Jul 17 07:56:43 2015 UTC,"It's always worth noting that categories like ""genre"" and ""literary"" are relatively recent inventions in the context of human storytelling; they are, more or less, a product of bookshops needing to put stuff places. Homer never had to worry about where to shelve the Illiad.   For the vast majority of human history, much of our storytelling came in the form of myths, legends and parables which often featured fantastical gods and monsters, heroes and demons, and golems which were actually metaphors. And people seemed to find them fairly meaningful and interesting.  One might argue that modern human beings no longer think of gods and monsters as literal parts of the world, as our ancestors did--in effect, the ""Jason and the Argonauts"" was down-to-Earth literary fiction by the standards of its time, because people thought of Zeus and his gang as actual parts of the real world.   But then, why did we think that? Well, because the stories of Zeus and his gang (or Jupiter and his gang, or whichever Old God you choose) stuck in those ancient minds so strongly that they seemed like convincing explanations for the world.   (And I think it sells previous generations of humanity a bit short to think that every single one of them credulously believed stories of the Old Gods and Heroes were literally true; some people would have surely seen them for parables).  Whether they're literary or genre, or cabbage or cheese, all stories are false (especially the ones claiming to be true); they're all constructs designed to communicate a feeling or idea. And human beings have had far more practice communicating through tales of gods and monsters, heroes and epics, than anything in what we rather presumptuously think of as the real and modern world.   ...Also, by 21st century standards, ""Hamlet,"" ""The Tempest,"" ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and ""Macbeth"" are all technically fantasy.

To answer the question, as I'm still relatively at the beginning, the most amazing thing in this book is how Herbert makes his world come to life. Without more than a sentence here or there to describe the environment, he still manages to create a vivid image of a universe that appears to be, while beeing vastly different from ours, so incredibly familiar that I think I know exactly what can be found behind the next corner.   New information is seldom delivered by purely decriptive paragraphs, but weaved into dialogues and thoughts of characters letting you percieve the world as well as the plot through their eyes and learning about their intentions at the same time.    I really like being dragged into worlds different from ours, without having to read pages and pages of Tolkien like discriptions of forests and fields.

As in, the main conflict of the plot doesn't occur until about 400 pages in; but once you finish the book, besides being able to say that you finished a work of Dostoevsky's - which is an achievement in and of itself - the payoff lies in the philosophies discussed and the ideas portrayed. It truly is a masterpiece, and I would highly recommend finishing it; preferably, read it somewhere comfortable and quiet where you can think about all of the things you are reading. That really helped me understand and appreciate it. Good luck!"

books,3dhvlu,La-Boun,2,Thu Jul 16 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"The book isn't so much about the plot. To me it's about the characters, recognizing people that actually exist in our lives (turned into extremes), all 3 brothers, Smerdiakov, the father... One central idea, the way I read it, is that no one intends to be bad. Everyone loves Alexei, the innocent, the beautiful one, and I believe everyone, in a way, would like to be like him, to be good to all, a solace to all. But Alexei is sort of ""blessed"", he seems to simply be good, when the others are struggling through their own passions (jealousy, desire for revenge after years of humiliation...)  I read this book as both an extremely accurate look at different human natures, and as an expression of forgiveness for all of our failures. Dostoievski lets us see both the frightening side of the killer and his very sad side, and in the end, we understand him, which doesn't mean it erases the murder, but we pity the murderer more than anything else."

The introduction of the book is a lot of letting a ""narrator"" talk and set up the characters and setting, and the narrator tries to explain who these people are and goes into quite a lot of detail. But I didn't get it, it seemed the narrator was making things up because no person can be like this. But then Father Karamazov spoke and I literally understood almost the entirety of his character just from the first time he opened his mouth. I think that's what really sold me on the translation and the book in general."

books,3dhvlu,thoughtlessfox,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:45:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly I feel like 1984 is at least a little more relevant, not in the total oppression sort of way, but more in the twisting of words and ideologies. Examples such as the terms terrorist, Patriot Act, Liberal, Conservative. If you protest Police brutality, that means you don't support the police. Think about the way pot has been demonized for so long also. And I have to admit, I didn't like BNW, and it didn't terrify me either. If I had to choose between living in 1984 or BNW, BNW would at least be fun lol."
books,3dhvlu,WesRicketts,3,Thu Jul 16 21:17:40 2015 UTC,"The difference is how the gov't controls its citizens.  A gov't that uses fear and intimidation (1984) produces more violent uprising than one that just encourages its citizens to spend their time with trivial matters (BNW).    BNW is much more realistic and I believe America is living this now, people don't spend much time thinking about millions of displaced folks fleeing Syria and other war torn lands, they're much more interested in what Caitlyn Jenner said last night on TV."

As I was reading 1984, I thought it was interesting at best, but when I finished it I just spaced out for a while and it became one of my favorites. It's just so disturbing. I know a lot of people will laugh at those who compare our world to 1984, but it is so accurate. Words, phrases, ideas and language are manipulated in such ways that cause confusion and discourse. Just go to yahoo comments to watch ignorant people argue and it is chilling to see how much they ""buy in"" to certain ideas and labels. Anytime I see an example of words and ideas being manipulated, I think about 1984. Great book."

Must just not be your cup of tea.   To be completely honest, I think it may even be a good thing that you can't I.D' with it. It's a book about struggling to just live and enjoy life, something Wallace struggled with himself. I think people that are familiar with the struggle of not being a self-absorbed dick can connect better than those who are O.K with their life.

This is the Bible in narrative form, very thorough for a children's version, not watered down.  Many people raised in the church learn the Bible more through oral stories than by reading, and this was even more true hundreds of years ago when not everyone could read.  This is the Bible as if narrated by a highly-knowledgeable grandmother."

The poetry is really beautiful in the King James version, but the outdated language really bogs down the rest of the text.  Of course, there are certain quirks of the King James that you won't find in any other version.  For example, I read a book a while back that had a reference to 'red pottage', after some research I found it in the King James, modern translations say 'red lentil soup' or something similar."

And so, let it be said that this aforementioned gentleman spent his times of leisure--which meant most of the year--reading books of chivalry with so much devotion and enthusiasm that he forgot almost completely about the hunt and even about the adminstration of his estate; and in his rash curiosity and folly he went so far as to sell acres of arable land in order to buy books of chivalry to read, and he brought as many of them as he could into his house; and he thought none was as fine as those composed by the worthy Feliciano de Silva, because the clarity of his prose and complexity of his language seemed to him more valuable than pearls, in particular when he read the declarations and missives of love, where he would often find written: The reason for the unreason to which my reason turns so weakens my reason that with reason I complain of thy beauty. And also when he read: ...the heavens on high divinely heighten thy divinity with the stars and make thee deserving of the deserts thy greatness deserves.  With these words and phrases the poor gentleman lost his mind, and he spent sleepless nights trying to understand them and extract their meaning, which Aristotle himself, if he came back to life for only that purpose, would not have been able to decipher or understand."
books,3dhvlu,JellyCream,25,Thu Jul 16 19:45:11 2015 UTC,Catcher in the rye.  Not only is it a fun book but the ideas and symbolism make it a must read for any angst filled teenager.
books,3dhvlu,antennarius,13,Thu Jul 16 12:38:55 2015 UTC,Only if they read it before they're 20.  I read it in my 20s and wanted to smack Holden for being a self entitled whiny bitch.  It was well written as the voice of a teenager but I didn't really care for the book. It's one of those that you have to read it at a certain time in your life otherwise you'll hate it.
books,3dhvlu,Hitlers_Unborn_Fetus,12,Thu Jul 16 14:51:54 2015 UTC,"When I was a teenager, I was a ""good kid"" and I absolutely hated Holden. I think if I read it again now, I might feel differently, since I'm able to look at him as someone outside my generation."
books,3dhvlu,La-Boun,16,Thu Jul 16 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"100% disagree. I read it when I was 22, and I certainly didn't agree with him, but I also certainly didn't want to smack him. I felt bad for the poor kid.  I get that once you're out of your teenage years and have moved past that mindset that you no longer relate to Holden, but don't you remember what it was like to be like that?  It annoys the shit out of me when people write off Holden Caufield as a whiny piece of shit, because most people are whiny pieces of shit when they're his age.   You're not meant to agree with him, you're meant to emphasise with him. Growing up is arguably the only experience that is common to 100% of the adult population, have a little god damn sympathy."
books,3dhvlu,wjbc,2,Thu Jul 16 16:21:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. I read it when I was 24, and it moved me beyond anything I had read for a while. Holden is a great kid, with such a clever outlook on life - just look at how he understands people around him. He loves life - I can't help but think about him when I see 2 people dancing well together, for that piece when he describes how and why his little sister is a great dancer.  But he's having a rough time. Sometime you get depressed, and then it's hard to get yourself to do anything, this happens! How can you want to smack someone who's already down? He's a kid feeling sad without anyone to talk to. So many people have felt like this at some point in their lives, it's clear to my why this book appeals to so many people."

books,3dhvlu,BookBookRead,9,Thu Jul 16 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"I think it's a book that absolutely should be read because it really demonstrates the power of language.  On the surface, you could say it's a book about a pedophile.  But I once read a review that called it ""the most convincing love story ever written"" or something to that effect.  The way it is written makes you forget the unseemly reality of the story and empathize with Humbert Humbert.    Basically, the answer to ""why is a book about a pedophile considered an American classic"" is really, really worth finding out."

My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip of the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta.  She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four feet ten in one sock. She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita. Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In point of fact, there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one summer, an initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what the seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns.

It's one of the more philosophical and complex sonnets of the time, which generally go into lots of details about the beauty and charms of the author's lover. This seems to contemplate the passage of time, and the importance of literature in preserving feelings and people which would otherwise have been lost in the course of history,"

books,3dklsn,anaphoricalsynthesis,2,Fri Jul 17 00:58:42 2015 UTC,"What is this book even about? I don't even know what I'm supposed to be taking away from this book. Is it about communism? The futility of life? The dangers of listening to insane people? What?   Well, Nabokov himself said plenty of times that he didn't want people taking anything away from his books. Whenever he wrote a novel, he did it just to tell a story, and he always insisted that there was no authorial intent to make any sort of allegory or deeper meaning.   I myself think that Zembla isn't real, and Kinbote is a very, very deluded man (or maybe Zembla is real within the novel and Kinbote just imagines his relationship with it). Nabokov himself said that Kinbote is actually Professor Botkine (a secondary character only mentioned in passing a couple of times), but most critics dismiss that as ""authorial trespassing"". There's a critic that says that the entire book is inspired by the ghost of Shade's dead daughter.   I for one think that this open-endedness is what makes the novel so great. It creates this world and then makes you constantly question your assumptions about it. I first read it when I was a teenager, and took the entire story at face value. Then I reread it (this is a book that really rewards rereads) and realized that Kinbote is a very unreliable narrator, that everything he says must be taken with a huge grain of salt, and that entire chunks of the narrative are probably delusions.   But we can never know for sure: all we have is our own interpretations of the narrative -hence why this is considered a masterpiece of postmodern novel. Personally, I think that reading it as a puzzle with a single, objectively right solution, only lessens the book's impact and charm. Nabokov made a book so open-ended that there's a whole lot of different interpretations of its story, and that's it. Maybe every time you reread it you will think that a different interpretation is true."
books,3dklsn,Jewcunt,2,Fri Jul 17 08:12:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I went into the book too unprepared. I knew absolutely nothing about it, other than that it's by Nabokov and supposedly his best work. I read the poem first, and didn't realized until I got to the commentary that there was much more to the book than I'd thought. I'm definitely going to have to reread it at some point.  Also, what's ""authorial trespassing""?"
books,3dklsn,asbestos-i-can,2,Fri Jul 17 14:30:57 2015 UTC,"This book was fantastic. When I reading it I took Kinbote's story pretty much at face value, although reading through the comments now I definitely see how he's a good candidate for an unreliable narrator. Still, I personally believe that Zembla is real and Kinbote is the former king in disguise, no matter how improbable, simply because it's a beautiful and enchanting story that matches the beauty and enchantment of the poem. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide.  As for the meaning of the book, again, there are a ton of different angles you can read it from, but for me, what stuck out as a central theme was a sentence that gets repeated a few times, about our lives simply being footnotes to a larger artistic work. Kinbote's life story is revealed through the footnotes to Shade's life story, but you would never guessed at any of it just reading Shade's poem alone. What happens in the peripheries of stories can be just as fascinating or even more so than the main story."

However, like you said, there are LOADS of possibilities, such as the foreign professor actually being the escaped king, etc.  I'm not sure if I'm making this up, but I recall an interview with old Nabby himself who suggested that the whole thing was fiction and a clever work by one of the other academics described in the faculty meetings. He was described as unpleasant which makes this self-deprecating even more fun.   One of my favorites, hands down."

This is a book that doesn't tell you how to read it, what it means what it's about. I read it straight through, meaning if a footnote was called for then I followed it and if it referenced another footnote then I followed that then back to the poem once all the trails had been followed. Some of my classmates (read it for an English Master's class) read it straight through, some of them didn't read the intro or the commentary until we got to class so they were surprised that it wasn't just a poem. Nabokov's brilliance is in his refusal to meet any of the reader's expectations. Don't ask what it means but instead ask what does it mean to you? If you liked it then you might like ""S"" by J.J.

It's hard to argue with the convenience, but they have some pretty terrible business practices, especially in how they treat their workers. I also seriously think the Washington Post has been going downhill since Jeff Bezos bought it out, but that's been going on for a while so it might not be entirely his fault. On the other hand, the publishers are not exactly blameless, either. I think if libraries hadn't existed before publishers did, the publishers would never allow them to exist."

In the early days, publishers loved Amazon and the expanded access to consumers, and it was a mutually beneficial relationship. There was hope that online retail would strengthen all arms of the book business. But books were never what drove Amazon - its ambition has always been as a (wildly successful) experiment in omnipotent modern online retail. Bezos is frank about this. And the result of that success has been a company with such inordinate power over the marketplace that it negatively affects not only competitors but publishers and authors.  I'd say the only people Amazon could be said to benefit now are its self-publishing writers. And of course anyone who lives far away from any other source of books, and relies on mail-order. You can't even say Amazon benefits its many Wall Street investors - the stocks rise, but they waited forever for them to turn a decent profit!"

Anna Karenina is probably the easiest one to start with, as War and Peace has much more characters, and the story is much more complex.   A word of warning though: I don't know  what kind of books you usually read, but both War and Peace and Anna Karenina are full of Tolstoi's musings on history, society, politics and religion, and sometimes prevent the plot from going further for some time. So if you're looking for a fast-paced story, these are not books you should consider reading. Still an amazing read though!"

books,3di8ju,Falldog,22,Thu Jul 16 14:09:32 2015 UTC,"I finished Armada as part of another book club and I'm interested to see how people here reacted to it. Ready Player One got/gets a lot of hype and I had conflicted feelings the first time I read through it. Since then, because of the hype, the oft contrarian in me tended to reflect negatively back on RPO. In order to refresh myself and treat Armada openly I went through RPO a second time (the audio book version as well). For the most part I liked RPO. I could get past some of the unnatural and silly setting issues because, at its core, I viewed the novel as a way for Cline to share his love of the 80s. Both times I went through I was negatively impacted by the amount of references at times. RPO's reference structure often supports the overall narrative but there are points where it's either superfluous or adversely burdening to the narrative.  As such, for better or worse, I came into Aramda after enjoying RPO. I know some people say that the two shouldn't be compared but I disagree. There are a lot of similarities between the two, both in the narrative and the flaws.  I ended up writing 7 pages in an attempt to convey my feelings toward RPO and Armada, warning - it contains minor RPO and major Armada spoilers, http://otakurevolution.com/content/ernest-cline%E2%80%99s-armada-a-book-review-comparison-to-ready-player-one  I can't recommend Armada to anyone. There are just too many issues with the characters, the story, the dialog, and the reference style. I've seen posts by people as to why they like'd Armada but haven't seen anything that didn't seem to be parroting the promotional material or were very simplistic. If you'd recommend Armada to others, I'm genuinely interested as to why.  Edit: Looks like Zack's last name is a WarGames reference as is Crystal Palace. Those are the kinds of references Armada should be full of, where you either feel slick for catching it off the get-go or weeks/months/years later while watching source.

I mean, I liked rp1 a lot but I think even that wasn't written very well but it least it had a fresh take on things. Armada, with it's musical/video game references and etc etc is like a shadow of rp1. I can't recommend it to anyone, seriously. What a bummer."

I laughed, I cried, I questioned a lot of preconceived notions I had about Geek and Gaming culture.  I laughed - at the horrible plot, juvenile writing, and embarrassing gary-sue style sci-fi masturbation.  I cried - after realizing I had spent money and time on getting through this book.  I questioned - whether this book had actually managed single handedly to make me dislike so many geek and gaming culture concepts that I usually love.  There are just so many moments where I cringed at the words I was reading. His description of the history of Armada reads like someone who has no concept of how video game development works. His ending is the largest deus ex machina happy-ending tripe I've read in a long time.  I just don't get it. I LOVED Ready Player One. It often held a space within my list of favorite books, ever, just because it was so fun.  Armada isn't fun. It's sad.

books,3di8ju,IndieGeekGamer,11,Sun Jul 19 01:51:23 2015 UTC,"I finished the book yesterday.  I enjoyed RP1 as a light, fun read and I found that the references were often woven into the story which helped make them work. In Armada the references were a lot more forced and really felt like Cline was putting them in because they were expected to be put in. I think Cline used referencing things like Ender's Game and The Last Starfighter as his way of justifying copying a tired, unoriginal plot. RP1 wasn't a unique plot either, but the references being interwoven into the quest and the setting made it stand apart a bit, whereas in Armada everything just falls flat.  Armada seems to be Cline's attempt to cash in on the success of RP1 without really trying. The plot is simple and predictable, many parts are rushed near the end, and the references serve very little point in the book.  I was hoping to finish and at least say that I could recommend it to people who enjoyed RP1, but I can't even do that. Armada feels like the inevitable copying of RP1's format done by Cline himself."
books,3di8ju,Seanv112,8,Thu Jul 16 18:39:49 2015 UTC,I don't think cline is trying to cash in on RPO... that's being a little harsh.. I think it's hard to write a second book. He probly had RPO in his head for years and when it was successful it's hard to come back with a second book. He probly tried to see what people liked about RPO and copied it. I'm not an author but I would bet the second book you write is the most difficult.

books,3di8ju,xerograde,4,Fri Jul 17 02:16:00 2015 UTC,I'd say read something like Ender's Game first. Armada references it a ton (and borrows a lot of the plot) and Ender is far superior.

Perhaps Wil Wheaton can bring this to life for me in the same way he did 'Ready Player One.' The issues I'm having so far are that that the emotional character of the protagonist is unwieldy (experiencing anger, boredom, sadness within a heartbeat) which makes setting the tenor of any scene a bit difficult to gauge; the eighties references seems much more ham-fisted in the text (there seems to be more of an effort to get the '80s prop/language inserted into a scene than in RP1, and more exposition regarding the props/language which hobbles the narrative); and the premise seems a bit tired. Perhaps it will pick up and surprise me in the final stretch; but right now it's feeling like a bit of a slog. :-/  EDIT: Removed typos from the phrase ""inserted into a scene than in RP1"""
books,3di8ju,likertj,3,Thu Jul 16 17:18:44 2015 UTC,"I finished the book this morning, and I somewhat disagree on the tenor of Zack Lightman.  He's an angsty teen full of many broiling emotions.  Knowing that was enough for me to try to understand where his mind was at any given time.  On the other hand, I agree with you on the overabundance of pop culture references which seemed to be every other sentence.  My friends and I are pretty big SciFi fans, and we don't use video game or Star Wars references every time we speak.  I felt, in the end, it was a weakness that relied on the readers ""understanding"" of pop culture references to drive dialogue between the characters instead of the characters having their own voice.  Almost every single dialogue between the characters used a reference from a movie, or game or musical lyric.  In this way, no character was unique in how they responded to the world, or the events that happened.  I also felt that the plot was too derivative of Enders Game and the Last Starfighter.  There was barely enough context to show differentiation between those stories and what the reader, was presented with.  Combine that with the steady pop culture references and you end up with an semi-entertaining book with bland characters.  To me, the most interesting characters were secondary in the book, namely Lex and Chen, and even Dagh.  They didn't speak only in references, had their own unique voice.  Sure, Lex was still the stereotypical punk-hair-cut-super-hacker-female vibe going for her overall, but at least she wasn't dripping pop culture references every other sentence."

Cline isn't for everyone of course. I think a lot of people on this sub are too infatuated with the classics, or hard literature,  that when they read hyped up books such as RPO, The Martian, or this book, they expect hard literature. But that isn't what this is. It's like comparing Guardians of the Galaxy to The Godfather. Both are great movies, but you can't really compare them. Guardians has a fun story with a lot of culture references, and The Godfather is a serious drama. I wish readers could see how both styles can have quality. Armada was very creative, and I loved the ending. It leaves it open for potential sequels Cline has talked about. I could relate to Zack very much. I'm a high schooler as well, and have always dreamed of some adventure since grade school. This book is a love letter those childhood daydreams. The references are enough to make any geek smile. People say he over uses them, but I think not. They help the story flow. I finished it last night and can't get it out of my head. Such a good book.

This is also the reason why I've heard they don't want to release a hard set in-universe timeline for the books (such as when ""x"" or ""y"" happened and what year/month/day, etc.), because they want it to be loose-form storytelling based more around the character interaction (with an emphasis on the action) than based on dates, mechanical specifications, and such.   That being said, the amount of dangerous situations the main characters have gotten themselves in and managed to Han Solo their way out of should be a pretty good indicator of the story itself... it's primarily pulp fiction, but I mean that as a total compliment. This is the most fun space series I've gotten into since ""Star Wars,"" primarily because it doesn't take itself too seriously or dour."
books,3dejxl,darthstupidious,2,Wed Jul 15 23:12:16 2015 UTC,"Well they managed to stick true to hard sci-fi throughout much of it.  While it's not completely hard sci-fi, there's enough solid science in it to make it really enjoyable for people who like hard sci-fi.   because they want it to be loose-form storytelling based more around the character interaction (with an emphasis on the action) than based on dates, mechanical specifications, and such.    That's not really necessary for hard sci-fi. Hard sci-fi is more about being based upon solid science; an authenticity to scientific and engineering knowledge.  The Expanse definitely has this; a lot of the choices made about details in the universe match up closely to our current understanding of science, which makes it an enjoyable read for those of us who tend to shake our fists at some of the fantasy-in-space stuff pulled by other sci-fi series'."

I didn't mean to say that the authors don't do any research or try to create realistic sci-fi machinery in their novels, but they're not the type to over-explain everything in their universe like other sci-fi/space opera novelists (Alastair Reynolds comes to mind). I just meant that the focus of the books isn't necessarily built around world-building and an explanation of how humans got to where they are, but rather a focus on the characters interacting and exploring the universe among each other."

It may SEEM like a small deal but I don't believe it is.   People don't have to purchase physical books. In the world of easily available pirated EBooks, libraries, Kindle, etc... I would argue that most the people still purchasing SciFi/Fantasy in physical formats are collectors. I read a LOT but I only buy stuff that I want to display on my shelf and see sitting there, looking pretty all the time. Perfect example: I'd already read all the Expanse books twice from the library before I got some extra money and purchased copies for my collection. I might not have done this if I knew this was going to happen with the covers.   Maybe this makes sense in a make-money way, but I have my doubts.

Spoilers following in questions:  Leviathan Wakes was such an tightly crafted universe in which humanity finds itself with space travel but is still bottled up in a single star system, and very unique as such. In later books, of course, you move beyond that. I'm curious: was that always the intention from the beginning, or did you find the single solar system element too constraining mid-stream?  Sub - or parallel - question: considering the epic scope of The Expanse series, how far out has everything been planned?

Was there any particular inspiration for that? When this is adapted into the show, will there be any subtitles, or is the audience left to determine the meaning on their own?"

So one thing I was curious about, especially after the most recent book (which I haven't finished yet, so nobody spoil the ending please!), was what sorts of influences you took from history. I've noticed a few times parallels to historical events (most recently a plot line from Nemesis Gate that reminds me an awful lot of the fears about Soviet arms during the break up in the 90's), and I was curious if it's something you guys do intentionally, if it's just an accidental bleed through, or if I'm just a nerd who reads too much into things. If you are doing it intentionally, are there a few that you find yourselves turning to repeatedly?   Thanks again guys!  Edit: also, I just read you guys originally formed this as an mmo, and then as a campaign. So like, what would it take to get you to toss an ol'fan like me your campaign notes?

First off, I want to say that I just finished Caliban's War the other week and it was one of the most entertaining reads I’ve been through in a while! The  Rocinante crew are the best. The idea that someone who’s lived off Earth their entire lift might never have stepped ‘outside’ without a spacesuit was particularly awesome.  Here are my questions:  While reading Leviathan Wakes I noticed that the heliopolitical structure and the Expanse universe features a lot of similarities to that laid out by Clarke in Rendezvous with Rama. Where did you get the inspiration for the universe and did Clarke’s work influence that?  Part of what I’ve been enjoying thus far is your is your approach to the Sol system as previously mentioned. It somehow feels expansive and full of potential but claustrophobic and full of hardship at the same time. I understand that things start to take a turn more toward the galactic stage and feature more extrasolar activities/foes. Was it a difficult task to switch from a basis grounded in realism and transition to one… how should I say it... out of this world?  And, while I’m at it, what’s it like to write a cohesive narrative like this as co-authors?  Thanks a ton!"

The description of how Scout (and by extension the rest of the readership) had made Atticus into a God, was very well placed. I'm sure I have more to add, but right now I just kind of want to discuss it with other people since no one else I know has finished it.  I also loved Dr. Finch's role in the book. It's funny seeing the quote on the back, I assumed it would be Atticus.   It's funny how the world works in that this book written so long ago can be released at a time when a lot of the conversations had in this book are going on STILL in this country.  One thing I didn't like (and it has much more to do with the state of our media than it does the book) was how everyone made it out to be ATTICUS IS THE DEVIL YOUR WORLD WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. But in reality if they would pull their head out of their collective ass and read it, they might have discovered the key to feeling that way within. </rant>  Overall I'm glad I bought it and read it before too many of those reviews and articles were in my face.

books,3dg0g1,ForcesEqualZero,37,Thu Jul 16 00:47:55 2015 UTC,"After reading the book, I think the early reviews did not take time to observe the complexities of Atticus.  The reviewers reacted the same way Scout did; since Atticus is racist, he's a disgusting man who doesn't deserve the time of day.  Apparently Dr. Finch wasn't around for the reviewers. And I think that's what I took away from the book. Yes, Atticus has views I find disgusting. But does that undo the good he did in TKAM? Does that make him a bad father?  Does that mean he's evil?    The world we live in is not black and white. No one is without flaws. But I'm not so sure the flaws doom us all to be labeled evil."
books,3dg0g1,BlackRind,12,Thu Jul 16 02:14:37 2015 UTC,"Our literary world thrives off of conflict. Harper Lee  is amazing at swinging both ways, the pendulum strikes our heart muscle, then swings the other way and strikes our limbic system. It's a rough ride reading her work, as such, many readers come away angry that the novel didn't resolve itself in the way they expected, and that's exactly what Lee intended. It's a psychological carnival ride, much less a psychological mystery. Many people don't like their moral positions questioned, even through reading a novel. I believe many people who left negative reviews, were still stinging after looking into the mirror, which is what reading a great novel can be; a mirror."

As someone who grew up in Alabama, and now lives pretty close to Maycomb (Monroeville), I can attest to the fact that this book is still very accurate and relevant. This revelation of ""my hero has a dark side"" is a step  that I think everyone has to take. If people think it's so terrible for a fictional hero to be revealed to be a racist, then they probably haven't looked close enough at people they actually know, and love."
books,3dg0g1,Scamwau,7,Sat Jul 18 23:28:10 2015 UTC,Can you please explain why Atticus is so different to how he was in TKAM? What has happened to him over the 20 years to change him so dramatically?
books,3dg0g1,golfpinotnut,39,Thu Jul 16 13:00:43 2015 UTC,"The point of the book, I think, is that the Atticus we see in TKAM is an idealized perfect father who can do no wrong.  Scout (Jean-Louise) slowly comes to realizes in Go Set a Watchman that Atticus isn't quite the perfect man. I think Harper Lee did this extremely well.  Initially the reader expects that there is some mistake -- that Scout has misinterpreted her father somehow, and  you keep waiting for the big reveal on how Scout's perceptions have betrayed her.  We are even given a flashback scene where Scout, as a child, humorously becomes convinced that she's pregnant because of her incomplete understanding of how one gets pregnant.  I was expecting some similar revelation to appear to explain what we're shown about Atticus.  We learn that Atticus is a benevolent Segregationist (if such a thing can exist). He's not a cross-burning member of the KKK, but he does believe that the black people in the 50's aren't equipped to vote, and certainly lack the capacity to govern.  His bigotry is driven, at least in part, by a fear of whites being outnumbered by blacks.    If you haven't read the book, this sounds horrible.  Atticus, a racist?  But what Harper Lee does is gently explain to the reader that Atticus is a very good man who has spent his life using the law to help people. His perspective is probably the same perspective most enlightened and intelligent whites had at the time.  Racial equality is essentially a foreign concept in that place at that time.  Is Atticus a bad man because of it?  That's for the reader to decide, but I think the answer is no."

books,3dg0g1,Gamingviper,2,Thu Jul 16 12:06:53 2015 UTC,I think your words here best explain how I felt about Atticus as well. Thank you for your explanation
books,3dg0g1,TheDutchJr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:55:27 2015 UTC,"POTENTIAL SPOILERS:   After finishing the novel, I have a different take. Atticus has two intentions for being involved with the segregationist movement - for the express purpose of keeping an eye on things in town, and to give Jean Louise a reason to become her own person, separate of Atticus with her own beliefs and morals. Henry says as much, and Dr. Finch seems to confirm it when he says (paraphrasing) ""your father and I were looking for a way to uncouple your consciousness from his"". He's referring to the fact that Jean Louise sees her father as a God figure, and both Dr. Finch and Atticus believe this needs to stop at some point. So, Atticus' role with the segregationist movement is twofold: 1) to keep an eye on what's happening there (it's going to happen with or without him - as Henry says, so it's better to be inside it and keep tabs than outside and not know what's happening) and 2) Atticus plays the part of segregationist in the big fight with Jean Louise to implement a plan he and Dr. Finch made to uncouple Jean Louise from Atticus, the result of which is JL finally becoming an independent person.   Another way of saying this is it's Atticus' final life lesson for Scout. One may be brought up a certain way, to believe things are right, but eventually one must make their own decisions on what is right. Atticus knows segregation is wrong (rather, teaches her that fairness and justice matter above all else), and raised his daughter to believe so. But in order for her to become her own person, he must destroy the image of himself she has come to know and love. It's a two-part maneuver, implemented by Atticus and cleaned up by Dr. Finch, who comes to the house IMMEDIATELY after JL and Atticus fight. It's like Atticus called Dr. Finch right away and said ""Ok, now it's time for your part of the plan.""   I may be a little rosey-eyed with this interpretation, but the subtext is certainly there for assessment."
books,3dg0g1,price-iz-right,4,Thu Jul 16 15:58:07 2015 UTC,"Just finished the book and I'm coincidentally turning 26 this month. I had my ""become your own person"" moment a little earlier than Scout. Being in the military at a young age and seeing the world these past 8 years only to come back home periodically and realize my parents and others I knew are, in fact, human with faults and differing opinions/beliefs/morals was a big part of my adult life. This book is going to confuse a lot of people and I think it was purposefully written to juxtapose the readers thoughts just like the characters. Bottom line people are going to see what they want to see in this story, but overall the message was clear as day to me: you need those juxtapositions in your life. You may not like what someone has to say but it says a lot about your character in how you react to what is said. What a great coming of age book...I see this being part of mandatory reading in high school in 10-20 years."

The third-person omniscient narrator didn't have near the charm that Scout's TKAM perspective did, and I found that the general dialogue suffered in a similar way stylistically. Additionally, the transitions from the narrator's explication to Jean Louise's thoughts were a bit clunky for my liking (I say this as someone fond of Faulkner and Joyce).   Finally, the narrative didn't seem to cohere well (I believe I remember seeing a critic refer to the work as ""anecdotal"", and that's something with which I agree, to GSaW's detriment).  I too am glad that I read it, though; it was at least interesting to see what all the hubbub was about."

You guys!  So here is a little back story bout me.   My name is Ash. I am thirty years old. I am female. I am working though gender identity issues. I am a lesbian. I am Catholic. I want to be a priest and I want to get married.  Now whole the pope is really kind and vocally non-judgemental, my current church is not so kind towards gays. And people ask me why do you want to be a part of this church. But I think I finally understand why...its because I am not bigoted.. The way bigotry is defined in this book.   As a black woman..who went to a predominately white Catholic school..I heard all kinds of slurs against my race. But I was some how able to stay. Perhaps because while I saw and heard awful things I was also able to see beautiful things. I was able to see white people open their homes to me. Open their vacations to me.  Treat me so wonderfully. A lot of the racism just really seemed to have been taught to them. And when I was a little kid growing up with their children I like to think I taught them something else.  And that's what I think is important. I think it important to stay and face opinions that we don't like because ...to not sound overly religious..they know not what they do.   It was just so cool for me to hear the way they talked about brown v education!! I mean did it not remind people about the courts recent ruling on marriage equality. Everyone saying that the court is unchecked! It needs to be handled by the states ( which I agree with) but that's whole mother post  I dunno..this book was very important to me.

The best I've read so far was in The Guardian: http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/17/go-set-a-watchman-harper-lee-review-novel  I read Watchman in a couple days; I didn't enjoy it as a novel. I found it mediocre at best--the kind of thing I'd expect to buy self published off Kindle for 1.99.   I think where it's really interesting is as a point of evolution for Mockingbird, which I'm currently rereading because it's been years. In Watchman she lays out the Big Ideas she's trying to talk about via characters as talking heads. To see that become a story where the ideas are conveyed not by characters telling each other things, but through action and event, that was interesting. What I really wish was that it had been done as an annotated edition with correspondence about editorial changes, like the Lish edits of the Carver story the New Yorker published a while back, so you can see how it changed and why.  Watchman is very clearly not a 'prequel' or a 'sequel' -- it's an early draft, and the book changes considerably, but the elements of the story are largely there. And what I see rereading it is Atticus isn't this paragon of tolerance that people are remembering. I mean in the first 30 pages of Mockingbird, he basically tells Scout the Ewells are trash, always been trash, and always gonna be trash. He may not be racist, but he's certainly classist."
books,3dg0g1,spamboymeister,19,Sat Jul 18 23:26:58 2015 UTC,"Just finished it. Very thought-provoking. Definitely felt looser than Mockingbird, but I suspect it will stick with me, and many others, in much the same way as that novel.  I'd like to hear people's thoughts on Atticus? (Undoubtedly the million-dollar question regarding this book.) I don't think he is portrayed quite as badly as the media has made it out to be. Let me be clear - he is a segregationist, etc. but SPOILERS as the confrontation between him and Scout shows, it is never that simple. I'm not racist, I don't think, being of a minority race in a liberal part of the US, but some of Atticus' points definitely resonated with me... very thought-provoking."
books,3dg0g1,PlanksterMcGee,16,Tue Jul 21 08:36:23 2015 UTC,"I feel that a lot of reviewers reacted exactly like Jean Louise did to Atticus.   Unfortunately, they missed the point that Jean Louise's viewpoint is in part being criticized by Harper Lee. No one in this book has a wholly reasonable viewpoint. And that's the point.   TKM is about putting yourself in someone else's place and considering their perspective. Go Set a Watchman has exactly the same message, with Jean Louise learning to understand a worldview that she previously dismissed out of hand.   I think most of the criticism of Atticus stems from readers being, like Jean Louise, unwilling to confront opinions that they don't share. This is especially true in a world without nuance. Our political beliefs (like those of Jean Louise) are black-and-white. This Atticus lives very much in a context of gray and nuance."
books,3dg0g1,Palatyibeast,7,Thu Jul 16 00:47:55 2015 UTC,"If the message of 'TKAM' is we are all people and hating other because of race is stupid, then GSAW is: that goes for bigots, too. We are all flawed people with value and screaming at bigots is not going to change that or them. We have to be more nuanced in our approach."
books,3dg0g1,igotnothingtosay,12,Thu Jul 16 05:46:22 2015 UTC,"I very much agree with you. I found that we see Atticus in the eyes of a child in TKAM and in the eyes of a young adult who has developed her own views in GSAW. I still loved my father when I found out he was human, I still love Atticus, knowing he, too is human. I cannot judge a person or a character for making decisions in a context I have never experienced."
books,3dg0g1,Titanosaurus,5,Fri Jul 17 10:31:14 2015 UTC,"Its interesting! Scout is very anti Brown v. Board. But that in itself adds to the complexity of both Atticus, and the people of the South as a whole. As even Atticus says, ""You make me look liberal by comparison."" I can't remember the quote. But Scout wasn't raised the way Atticus was raised. Atticus was raised as a southerner, and the books goes into great detail how Atticus was shaped by that. In contrast, Scout was not and its greatly implied that Atticus did not want Scout growing up as a southern belle. In Scout's confrontation of that, she goes on saying that she could have easily been just another Lady of Macomb, at least she would have been happy. And in so many words, or lack thereof, Atticus didn't want that for Scout.  Its a fascinating and lovely read! I hope this thread is still active when I get back from work. I will say this. It puts Mockingbird in a realistic perspective. You read mockingbird as a child, but you read Watchman as an adult."
books,3dg0g1,pietya,7,Thu Jul 16 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"I have to agree that Atticus was very much taken as God and in the American lore perceived as the patron saint of what a lawyer ought to be.

books,3dg0g1,Okay_Pal,36,Thu Jul 16 01:26:03 2015 UTC,"I loved To Kill a Mockingbird.  It is one of my favorite books of all time, and I can quote it extensively.  I felt I had to read this, though all the hype made me question if this was going to ruin my perceptions of my favorite characters.    As for Go Set a Watchman, I didn’t hate it.  I liked revisiting ""old friends.""  The conflict is so damn timely and demoralizing, but I can’t quite decide if it’s Harper Lee’s big “F you” to the world. It’s like she woke up one morning and said, “God!  I can’t take it anymore!  I can’t have Atticus Finch quoted at me like the damn bible anymore!  I’ll show them what he was really like!  And then the world can stop seeing themselves as an 8 year old girl and grow the hell up!”  That being said, I liked seeing Scout growing up and becoming her own person, independent of her family.  She (and we) finally see Atticus as a fully fleshed out and flawed human being.  He has ideas that clash with Scout's conscience.  and as Uncle Jack points out, conscience isn’t collective.  Each person has to find his or her own way.  Atticus can’t speak for everyone because we don’t know his inner thoughts like we thought we did.  So, this leads me to consider my affection for Atticus.  Can I still love him despite his politics?  I feel like this is perhaps the most timely part of the story in the current state of political discord.  Can we still love our friends and family even if we vehemently oppose their politics?  I feel much like Jean Louise at the end of the book in that I can and do.  There are problems in this book, clearly.  The end was too rushed, and the prose lacked the charm of* To Kill a Mockingbird.*  It didn't have the advantage of being polished and cleaned up like Mockingbird did.  I don't think it damages Mockingbird or Lee's legacy as a literary disaster as some of the early reviews and articles claim."

To clarify, I meant in terms of releasing the book now, after all these years and after saying she would never publish again, releasing this earlier version of Atticus as a way to get back at all the hype and people who idolized Atticus to the point she couldn't escape it.    Looking at it as an early draft, the best writing in Watchman is found in the flashbacks.  This is the prose that stands out, and it really feels like we are back in Maycomb in those scenes."

I think she always longed to publish, and is doing so here at the end of her life figuring To Kill A Mockingbird has done it's work.

books,3dg0g1,eigil,9,Tue Jul 21 09:03:56 2015 UTC,"It was never so clear to me how the two books complement each other thematically than when I got to the Uncle Jack section when he tells Jean Louise she needs to ""open [her] eyes"" while explaining the ""connections"" in Maycomb County. This is very much a close echo to the passage in To Kill a Mockingbird where Atticus tells Scout the same sentiment about having to climb into a person's skin and walk around to understand his point of view. Both books are about the main character having to learn the life lesson that everyone's experiences inform their own perspective and actions. The important thing is to be able to empathize and regard each other as equals, whether we necessarily agree with each other or not. In Mockingbird, six-year-old Scout had to learn that lesson through Boo Radley; in Watchman the focus is on Atticus.  The issue I had after finishing it was kind of the same as yours. It was too rushed. The climactic chapter between Jean Louise and Atticus needed editing. It felt at several points unfocused to me, like there wasn't consistent characterization. Atticus acted more patronizing than I remember him ever being in Mockingbird, addressing Jean Louise multiple times as ""honey"" and referring to her ""feminine reasoning"" and telling her ""honey, use your head"" to see a point he was making that didn't sound like Atticus to me. Jean Louise also came off as histrionic towards the end in a way that seemed poorly written, like it was too theatrical and artificial. To Kill a Mockingbird was quite effective in that, like Atticus, everything was reasoned and controlled. It just presented injustice as how it was which made it more powerful.  I actually felt that both Uncle Jack's scenes with Jean Louise at the end were superior to the Atticus scene, which is no surprise since it felt to me in Watchman that Uncle Jack was basically given the voice-of-reason role that Atticus had in Mockingbird. I had a better sense of who Uncle Jack was than Atticus who mostly was away at the edges most of the novel and was amorphous during his big scene."
books,3dg0g1,pythus,7,Tue Jul 21 09:00:57 2015 UTC,Why do we need to think of them as the same Atticus?    I don't think they need to be reconciled. Authors often find their characters changing in surprising ways as they revise and rewrite their stories.

Like, if Harper Lee wrote Mockingbird and then Watchman (or vice versa) and intended that the young Atticus in Mockingbird grows into the old Atticus in Watchman.  But that's not what happened. Watchman is just a draft. It was drafted and edited and completely rewritten into Mockingbird, and while both are published now, they are not part of the same continuous universe. One easy proof of this is that in Watchman, Tom Robinson is acquitted. In Mockingbird, Tom is found guilty. It's not the same exact ""world."" Not the same exact Atticus."

It just seemed tedious.  There were flashes of what TKAM would become.  Notably the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, particularly the pregnancy and falsies buts that were enjoyable.

books,3dg0g1,buddhafig,13,Thu Jul 16 13:17:36 2015 UTC,"I'm feeling like I'm creating a bit of an echo chamber in here, but I'll add in my two cents.  I reread TKAM in preparation of the release of GSAW. In that read through, I was reminded of how much I revered Atticus -- how he was the pinnacle of what a human should be. I remembered being 13 or so my first go-around and being wildly in love with him, while also knowing I wanted to mirror his actions. (I mean, c'mon. That scene with the rabid dog and he just throws his glasses down? Hot.)  So hearing the news around GSAW, I was worried. And then the book started, and we got a glimpse into what Scout was seeing about who Atticus truly was, and I was angry right along with her. (Seriously. I slammed my Kindle down and walked away for a bit.) For me, Scout's journey of accepting her father as a person and not a god was my acceptance of him as well.  Authorial intentions aside, I'm really struck by how well the timing of these two novels have worked out. Readers have lived through young-Scout's eyes for the past 55 years. We, as an audience, have done exactly what Scout learned the hard way -- not to idolize our parents, a character, anyone. GSAW coming out now, well after TKAM, and even after the relative canonization of both TKAM and Atticus, force us into Scout's perspective in a way that Lee could not have possibly accounted for when she originally wrote GSAW and then published TKAM. Fascinating stuff.   Future generations introduced to these novels will never experience the same heartbreak and shock that this release has unveiled. So despite the book's flaws (of which there are several) and in spite of the surrounding controversy of the publication, I do feel that readers and long-time devotees of the Church of Atticus Finch have experienced something truly miraculous in modern literature -- an honest, visceral reaction drawn straight from protagonist to reader.

So what I think is especially interesting about the book is how it explores, from a first person real-time perspective, the conundrum of being a forward-thinking progressive in the Brown v. Bd of Ed era in the South.  We have Scout, who is clearly the closest approximation to a 21st century progressive in her thinking about race relations.  She's color-blind.  We're told that at least twice in the novel. But even she is angered by the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Bd. Of Education.  She explains that she's shocked that the Supreme Court gutted the 10th amendment with their decision.  This is an especially thoughtful reflection, I think, because the 10th amendment hasn't meant a thing since the Warren and Burger Courts gutted it in the 50s and 60s.  Scout, despite all her forward-thinking equality is a states' rights advocate.  And to hear Harper Lee tell it, the Civil War wasn't about slavery - it was about preserving the status quo.  Atticus tells us that the black man in the post-depression South wasn't mentally prepared for voting rights or equality.  Atticus also tells us that the Southerner was most afraid of being outnumbered by a black majority that wasn't prepared to govern.  Shocking stuff.  Edit - cleaning up my spoiler tags"

books,3dg0g1,Titanosaurus,4,Thu Jul 16 00:05:05 2015 UTC,"I really liked it. You need to see it as a first draft which was slightly edited. It isn't as well executed and polished as a book edited for years, but it's good.   It fits the TKAM world and expands it. It's a must read for a TKAM lover. It shows dimensions of Atticus we didn't see and how Scout grew up. I don't want to say too much and spoil it for people, but the themes in the book are still relevant today, especially finding yourself.  It's a shame that Harper Lee didn't edited it and published it decades ago, because it's a good book, but it could've been great. You see the potential. It has a lot of speeches in it, and that's common in first drafts."
books,3dg0g1,privatestudy,9,Thu Jul 16 01:57:28 2015 UTC,"I've just finished reading it, and in my honest opinion, it was absolutely terrible.   I hated the weird omniscient narrator, and how the author transitioned between childhood memories and present day adulthood. It was just so uncreative. Also, that horribly, cliched love affair with Jean and Henry. When I read the line: ' She was almost in love with him.. no, that's impossible, you either are or you aren't', I knew it was going to be a book full of cliches, and I think I was right, from revelation at the end of the book, to her break-up with Henry. I just knew.   It is worth mentioning, though, that there is an interesting sense of continuity between TKAM and this book. I realise that it was written before, but it does reveal something about the romanticism of youth, how Scout perceived her father in a God like manner, something which was revealed to not be true. It also asserts that black and white views of right and wrong may not always be applicable to society and the best way to achieve 'fairness'. This all indicates the radical change in thought which is so present between childhood and adulthood, and of course, leads on from TKAM.  Yet, the book was just so preachy. It reminded me a little of Fanny in Mansfield Park, where she goes off on those long tirades about the will of God and morality and such. Well, I feel Jean Louise is one of these do-gooders in this book. Yes, she is naive, but the anger she shows, the pages of ranting on equality, is just so tedious to read. Thank God it was a short book with large writing."
books,3dg0g1,YeezusChristSupersta,3,Thu Jul 16 17:42:34 2015 UTC,The preachiness kinda got to me. Jean Louise preaching to Atticus and then Uncle Jack preaching. I wouldn't go so far as terrible however.

books,3dg0g1,brojangles,3,Fri Jul 17 04:17:41 2015 UTC,I think that although it needed a little polish from an editor the story was really good. Jean Louise was a fantastically sculpted character and her interactions with Atticus seemed reasonable.   But I think I will need a few days to think and digest the book to truly appreciate it.
books,3dg0g1,ILIKETHECOLORRED,3,Thu Jul 16 03:21:51 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed it. Agree with other commenters that the reviewers seemed to have a hissy fit over Atticus' change of views (in the same way as Scout does, ironically!) and that we need to take this for what it is; a draft of a book written and not heavily edited for over 50 years. That being said, I loved reading the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, which in turn became the premise for TKAM."
books,3dg0g1,ILIKETHECOLORRED,2,Thu Jul 16 01:23:00 2015 UTC,"Go Set A Watchman is truly a great novel. The ending is one of the best parts of the book because of the message it sends. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and it wouldn't be right if everyone told us what to think or do. I loved Dr. Finch's discussion at the end of the story with Scout because he was not only holding up a mirror to Scout, but also to the reader in general. Scout was a bigot because she refused to accept Atticus' views and tried to convince him to change. Atticus never fought back or tried to convince her to adopt his views because he not only wanted her to form her own opinions, instead of just copying his, but also to stop revering him as a god because he is only just a human being, and humans make mistakes. But going back to what I said about Dr. Finch holding up a mirror to the reader; I don't know about other people who read the book, but it sure made me stop and think about how I react to people who have opinions that differ from mine. I never really thought much about it, but I too occasionally have moments where I react like Scout did when she confronted Atticus. But yelling and trying to hurt someone else for having different beliefs, no matter how ugly they are, is not the way to go. It just makes you a bigot.  I'm not saying that we should instantly accept any new or differing idea that comes our way. What I'm trying, and the book (in my opinion) were trying to say, is that we should listen to what other people have to say and they in turn should listen to what we have to say and let each person form their opinions. If we do this, then we'd have more intelligent discussions among people, instead of fighting and name calling (even if they really are a ring-tailed son-of-a-bitch)."

books,3dg0g1,ForcesEqualZero,4,Thu Jul 16 01:37:17 2015 UTC,I respect your opinion. I see it differently. The books together can give a great deal of insight into the perspective of individuals and they age and come into their own. TKAM was through the eyes of a child. SGAW was through the eyes of an adult. How many people have taken their parents off of a pedestal when they developed their own world view and found it didn't match their heroes? They work well together as a pair.

I think it was published for the sake of controversy, and the controversy was leveraged in order to make sales (and why not?)

This will be a footnote of discussion or extended reading recommendation as people continue to read Too Kill A Mockingbird with reverence."

I read nearly 100 books a year and can say that the quality of this literature far surpasses much of what is written today. Will it be a legacy? I can't say. I don't believe the author thought she provided us with a legacy when To Kill a Mockingbird was published, but she did. Time, and our progeny will tell.  I've read much of the controversy. I don't know what is true and what is fiction. I'm not sure that is what is important to me. I'm glad, however, for having had the opportunity to read the book and I,maybe only one person, will remember it far longer than the controversy.

The Atticus as portrayed by in Go Set A Watchmen very much expresses the reality of my parents.  They were deeply bigoted souls who would not tolerate an injustice being done to an African American in front of them.  I have never been able to work out in my mind how they could be so painfully just while tolerating such ugliness in their minds and souls.

At turns it captures the elegance of Mockingbird, and at turns it glows with a dry wit that I don't even think is fully realised in Mockingbird, though at times there is the roughness that you'd expect in a draft of a classic. As for Atticus, I loved the balance she got - he remains a good man, a deeply good man, and the racism he harbours is pretty much what you'd expect of the most liberal Southerners at that time."
books,3dg0g1,seetler,2,Fri Jul 17 23:02:24 2015 UTC,"This book demonstrates how quickly the civil rights movement escalated after the Great Depression and WWII. Scout grew up in the 1930s. Racial tensions were probably pretty tame because people were gripping with economic turmoil. Black people and White people in Maycomb just orbited around each other as the country tried to get itself together again. At best, it was separate but equal. At worst, well... how Tom Robinson was treated.   This is the case again with WWII. After the US triumphs overseas, people begin focusing back on domestic matters. Organizers (particularly in the north) reignite the fight for civil rights. Racial tensions jet up (think hockey stick on a graph), especially with Brown v Board. People in Maycomb have their dander up. Atticus' evolution is a reflection of the times and the community he lives in.   Atticus is interested in helping his protege Hank climb the ladder of influence (perhaps Hank runs for his old seat in the legislature). You can't do that in modern Maycomb (modern being 1950s) without the blessing of organizations like the Citizens' Council. Machine politics have also developed rapidly in span of 20 years.   Since Harper Lee wrote both books around the same time, there is no alternate universe scenario here. Prior to reading 'Watchman, I was in camp AU. But having read the book, I changed my mind. Lee had the sketches for these characters in her head and chose to emphasize them differently between the two."
books,3dg0g1,golfpinotnut,2,Fri Jul 17 15:19:29 2015 UTC,"I finished the book a few hours ago and I thougnt it was very good, especially for a draft. I was not upset that Atticus is a racist. I do not find it surprising.  What did shock me was Scout Finch agreeing with her father that African-Americans are a backwards people. I found that rather jolting to read. All everyone else will talk about is Atticus, but I haven't seen this mentioneed yet.  Did anyone else have a strong reaction to that phrase?"
books,3dg0g1,seetler,2,Fri Jul 17 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"I wonder what sort of impression of Atticus you'd get from this book without having read TKAM to cloud your perception.  I didn't find that the characterisation of Atticus was very strong in this book  (I really enjoyed Uncle Jack), and I wonder whether Lee's editor told her ""Great. Now show me why Atticus being a segregationist would come as such a shock to Scout."""
books,3dg0g1,jazzhot,2,Sat Jul 18 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"I can see this book becoming very controversial, but I absolutely loved it! I particularly thought that the choice of title was very relevant:   Isaiah 21:6 - For thus the Lord said to me: “Go, set a watchman; let him announce what he sees.""   The relevance of the quote wasn't apparent to me until towards the end when Atticus calls Jean Louise a bigot for not seeing their point of view. Even though I too disagreed with their point of view (found myself cheering on Jean Louise at many points in the book), I came to recognize its validity in the discussion. Ignoring their point of view by merit of its content would be bigotry. Listening to others, no matter how hard, is always valuable, and can be constructive."
books,3dg0g1,golfpinotnut,3,Mon Jul 20 03:30:48 2015 UTC,"I found a review that were in line with my views.   Harper Lee released her new book yesterday, and readers across America have been abuzz with hollow chimes of Atticus's segregationist ways, like the long-winded prose of A Tale of Two Cities, or the excess gore of Kill Bill. Go Set a Watchman delivers a sharp significance worthy of a true American classic.  Go Set a Watchman was the draft submission of To Kill a Mockingbird. At the advise of her editor, Harper rewrote vast majorities of the book before its initial publication in 1960. Though there are clear correlations between the two books; they are, without a doubt, separate novels with distinct storylines.  In Go Set a Watchman, Scout returns to Maycomb county as a twenty-six year old lady on her annual trip back home. The narrative constantly shifts between the present and Scout's juvenile years. The novel feels idyllic for the first three quarters, reading like innocuous journal entries of mundane events and everyday conversations in the Southern town. Over the course of a few days, Scout slowly discovers that her father Atticus is a segregationist, which leads to conflicts between Scout's progressive views and that of her aging father. But the focus isn't on race, it's a story of coming of age, and understanding the world around you.  When the illusion of a perfect man slowly fades to a human of varying natures, so too complicates an understanding of the self. The idyllic misadventures of her childhood forever enraptures the fond memories of her roots in Maycomb, but the conversations between neighbors confirm the subtleties once seen as ordinary. People often hold abrasive views, but everyone has the right to speak them. You don't have to agree with another, in fact, you should fight against the evils that you feel evident, but the ability to set your own watchman, and the willingness to understand another's, is what a makes a person a person.    Go Set a Watchman wont be lauded anytime soon, because it's too liberal for our society, especially with the recent social prerogative that Harper ironically outlined 50 years ago. There's already backlash from sources that fail to understand the focus of the book, which purports only the death of a moral compass, and stops short of accepting a person as a whole.  Go Set a Watchman is a beautifully crafted tale that will stand the test of time. Mark Lawson of The Guardian said it better than anyone else, ""This publication intensifies the regret that Harper Lee published so little."""

books,3dg0g1,merlinicorpus,5,Thu Jul 16 19:34:52 2015 UTC,"Why I Decided Not to Buy Go Set a Watchman (and why this book is AU and not a sequel)   Let me start off with why this is not a sequel. This is really the first draft of the story that became Mockingbird. If we think of a story as a vehicle to explore larger questions, then Harper Lee was still wrestling with the same questions in this first draft, but took it in another direction (drastically changed the age of the narrator and the focus of the plot, moved from 3rd to 1st person) after talking with her editor. These characters are then not the same characters we know. This Atticus Finch is a different Atticus Finch- he's an alternate universe ""AU"" Atticus Finch. From everything I've read about his character in the new book, I don't see TKAM's Atticus becoming this AU Atticus. The AU Atticus is just a vehicle for exploring the same issues in a different story. This also leaves us space to imagine a less tragic future for another Watchman casualty. It seems Lee only needed to kill that character off to make space for another character in Watchman (which is a first draft, so it's clear there's no reason to kill him off in the final draft). There's a .05% chance Harper Lee wants us to read this. From all available evidence, this is a violation of her wishes. Is it shocking that mere months after her sister Alice died, Lee was shocked to discover this novel survived and existed and anxious to share it with us? So we're all supposed to believe that her editor, Tay Hohoff, (also dead), never discussed this idea with her in the decades after Mockingbird's release? Now, with varying reports about her own health and mental condition, things change. Was she manipulated into publishing this? Probably. TKAM and Harper Lee super-fan Oprah has not spoken on this, and she even had lunch with Harper Lee. Until Oprah gives her blessing, I'm reading the volumes spoken by her silence. Do I still want to read a first draft of one of my favorite books? Yup. But I'm becoming increasingly uneasy about my complicity in the crime of violating Harper Lee's rights. That's not to say I'm not itching to pick up a copy. I'm not saying I'm never going to read it, but I'm not voting with my dollar on this one. I hope that if they really did discover a ""3rd novel,"" we all ask questions and speak out for Harper Lee."

Okay - I'll grant you this.  Why does it matter whether it is a sequel or not?  Would you want to read it if it were entirely new characters in an entirely new setting?    These characters are then not the same characters we know. This Atticus Finch is a different Atticus Finch- he's an alternate universe ""AU"" Atticus Finch. From everything I've read about his character in the new book, I don't see TKAM's Atticus becoming this AU Atticus.

It seems Lee only needed to kill that character off to make space for another character in Watchman (which is a first draft, so it's clear there's no reason to kill him off in the final draft).   Having read the book, to me this paragraph perfectly demonstrates why you should read the book.  The one thing Go Set a Watchman does beautifully is shows us that the Atticus we see in TKAM is an idealized caricature of the perfect father/man.  This new novel is all about Scout/Jean-Louise figuring it out.   There's a .05% chance Harper Lee wants us to read this. From all available evidence, this is a violation of her wishes. Is it shocking that mere months after her sister Alice died, Lee was shocked to discover this novel survived and existed and anxious to share it with us?

Now, with varying reports about her own health and mental condition, things change. Was she manipulated into publishing this? Probably.   This is nothing but bald speculation.  She's old.  She's mostly blind and mostly deaf.  She has white hair.  She lives in a nursing home.  So obviously she was manipulated.  Crazy.  No justification for this point of view.  Read this article which will succinctly explain why you're wrong.   TKAM and Harper Lee super-fan Oprah has not spoken on this, and she even had lunch with Harper Lee. Until Oprah gives her blessing, I'm reading the volumes spoken by her silence.   Really?  You let Oprah tell you when its okay to read something?  Not sure that's the best criterion I've ever heard.  Oprah won't like this book, though, because it topples the mythology of Atticus as the great white hope who has the courage to stand against white trash racists.   Do I still want to read a first draft of one of my favorite books? Yup. But I'm becoming increasingly uneasy about my complicity in the crime of violating Harper Lee's rights. That's not to say I'm not itching to pick up a copy. I'm not saying I'm never going to read it, but I'm not voting with my dollar on this one. I hope that if they really did discover a ""3rd novel,"" we all ask questions and speak out for Harper Lee.   Again, as noted above, Harper Lee isn't a victim here.  And do you really think ""voting with your dollar"" is helping Harper Lee?  She makes more in royalties every year from TKAM than most authors make in their entire career.

I think in five to ten years people will reflect on the novel in a more positive manner. While some of the continuity from the two books does not match, I'm glad that the novel was released as is, rather than changed to match To Kill A Mockingbird 100%."
books,3dg0g1,CFinley97,2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:05 2015 UTC,"Hello everyone. I just finished the book a few minutes ago, and gave the thread a quick look. At the risk of echoing the voices of some of you folks, I wanted to pitch in my two cents worth before the impact of this thing wears off. I come from the camp of reverence for To Kill a Mockingbird. I too re-read it upon hearing the release of this 'sequel.' I have much more exposure to the film, having seen it at least five or six times, and I find Atticus Finch to be one of the great titans of literary characters. As far as my perception goes, Go Set a Watchman has augmented this status significantly. Discussions of detail and polish aside, I was absolutely floored by this novel. I find it a worthy extension of the original novel in every way. There is no way of duplicating the magic of Mockingbird. It is a novel that looks at very adult issues through very child-like eyes. Heavier on plot and, dare I say, more simplified in its character illustrations, Mockingbird presents us with a society and issue where right and wrong are very clearly defined and as an audience we know quite well on which side of the line we belong and so whole-heartedly endorse. It laid a foundation that Watchman builds on, yet the time between the release of each novel and the stir this new novel has created has complicated our perception of it. For decades, Atticus Finch was the quintessential White Knight and crusader of all things righteous and pure in a polluted and complicated society. I'll not stray too far into the realm of semantics concerning the circumstances of the release of this novel, beyond saying that had Watchman been released within the same decade as Mockingbird, I believe our initial reaction for the latter novel would be more open and accepting to the development of these characters that Ms. Lee presents to us, without the issue of such a great span of time serving as an obstacle for readers to deal with in the accepting of Atticus Finch as anything lesser than the Marble Man of literature he has become. Watchman is a character piece, and a damn good one. Revolving mostly around conversation and inner conflict, it adds nuances and complications to the characters we know and love from Mockingbird. Whether or not these nuances are welcomed or deemed necessary by the reader is up to our individual preference. I, for one, have a greater appreciation for Mockingbird and the Finches having read Watchman. Mockingbird presented a view of the South with a great dash of fantasy, in how it presented Atticus as a pillar of purity. To understand the Atticus of Watchman, one would do well to study Lincoln's masterly politicking.  Progress is hard. It takes time, diligence, and a great deal of interacting with people so fundamentally different in opinion from ourselves as to make us physically ill, but in order to move forward we must persevere, and treat our opposition with the respect that Freedom of Speech and Thought entitles them to. Right makes Might. To try to bulldoze them, riding a cloud of Righteousness is to make an attempt at an achievable end by impossible means. It is not palatable by any stretch, but it's the way things work, and to have any hope in hell of moving forward, we must accept the obstacles presented by the opposition. This is the great catch of Democracy."

I didnt much like TKAM in high school and probably even less now as an adult.  GSAW seems pedantic in its content, but TKAM seemed so contrived when i first read it, i truly thought it was propaganda.  Without giving off any spoilers, i found the supposedly shocking revalations in GSAW to be ridiculous or at best tedious.  TKAM may have touched a nerve because of the race issues during the time it came out, but GSAW only makes TKAM look more like pablum for people who live in the age of Disney characters that promote social justice."

People don't want to accept the fact that their favorite character has changed for the worse. If you read GSAW with an open mind, its a great book! Lee really captures the romanticism of the South. Sure, its a tough pill to swallow that a character I loved changed so much for the worse but I don't see that as a reason to not read the book. GSAW just seems more real to me. TKAM is a great book with a great message that should not be overlooked, but it's almost too perfect. GSAW forces you to look at the world around us and really think about whats out there.   I'm glad I read it and I really enjoyed it."
books,3dg0g1,honeybfly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:58:32 2015 UTC,"Jean Louise’s realisation that Atticus is not perfect (never was) seems to be the completion of an arc.   Uncle Jack is the voice of reason who guides her through this.  While explaining Atticus’ apparent apathy in allowing Jean Louise to dress him down, Uncle Jack uses an explanation which I cannot help but feel works beyond the context of the novel itself:  “He was letting you break your icons one by one. He was letting you reduce him to the status of a human being”.    It is simple enough to attribute these sentiments to Harper Lee herself.  ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’ has always been held up by readers with reverence (by myself included… still is).  With all the literary awards, endless heaps of praise, presidential medals, etc., etc., was the mere existence of this sub-par work a reminder that Mockingbird too, was simply a novel?  By reading each page of an inferior novel is Lee anthropomorphizing her work, her status and herself?"
books,3dg0g1,budna,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:15:39 2015 UTC,"Heads up this is drawing from part 1 of Go Set a Watchman (so mild spoilers below). However I'm more interested in discussing a point being made there than the book.   Alexandra mentions Henry's background as a source of concern for Atticus. This is muddied by her opinion of his ""redneck"" folks, but do you think that if a person has a particular background (i.e. parents are drug addicts, child was an orphan, etc) that would be reason for a parent to disapprove of the idea of marriage or a lasting relationship?"
books,3dg0g1,Corbanis_Maximus,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:54:01 2015 UTC,"The book encompasses the reality of growing up. I think at one point or another every child discovers that their parents are only human. I could relate to scout on this level.  I once read somewhere "" the easiest way to dehumanize someone is to idolize them"" thats certainly the truth with Atticus. Even though he's image has been somewhat shattered, I feel as if he is more real now. The message I picked up from this is that one does not need to be perfect but it is honorable to do your best. I also loved the last line Scout tells her father. It raises the question as to wether we can truly love someone if we do not see or accept both their good and bad qualities."

I was hesitant after hearing all the rumblings about Atticus being racist, but the point was more in how Scout reacts to this revelation. I had similar stop-and-reread-and-go-""whoa"" moments in reading this book as I did with TKAM upon my first few readings. At her Coffee, I loved (and could totally relate to) her reaction to the girl blabbering on about nonsensical politics, basically saying, ""Wtf is wrong with you?"" We see people all the time develop their own ideas, and when they clash with ours (often in what we see as irreparable ideological clashes), I think people sometimes shut down. We struggle so much with empathizing and seeing how/where people could come up with ideas so far from what we consider to be the truth.   I think this story is important to our current political climate. Yes, we're sculpted by many influences, but ultimately, we each need to set our own watchman. But, like Jack gently urges Scout at the end, we can't just take our conscience and hide, frustrated with the other watchmen and too tired to care. We need to continue the discussion, seek to understand, and grow from there."

Nonetheless, I absolutely love French Literature, and don't think I'll be able to pick just one book.   Les Grande Meaulnes, by Alain Fornier: I read this when I was about twelve years old, I read it again recently. Only now, when I'm reaching that awkward stage of early adulthood, do I fully appreciate the sentimentality of the writing.   The Masterpiece, by Zola- I've read several Zolas, and love the realism and directness of his prose. While no one seems to like 'The Masterpiece' as well as I, I think it's a very stimulating work on the meaning of art, and the definition of perfection.   Various French Arthurian legends- I particularly love the works of Marie de France and Chretien de Troyes. I'm fascinated by the whole idea of chivalry, and find the similarities and differences between the French and English tales in intriguing. I love the French ones slightly more, though, because I think it's one of the first examples in literature of intense psychological examination."

Les Misérables: C'est le premier roman de Hugo que j'ai lu (cependant en Anglais), mais probablement le meillieur. On le sait déjà; je n'ai besoin de parler plus.  Notre-Dame de Paris: Un peu long et errant, mais dramatique et sombre.  J'ai entendu que Quatrevignt-treize est son meillieur, mais je n'ai le lu pas.

books,3dhicq,iLouminator,5,Thu Jul 16 14:05:53 2015 UTC,"Not just my favourite French writer but perhaps my favourite novel of the past 20 years - Au Bon Roman by Laurence Cossé.  It's been called satire and it's been called a 'bibliothriller', and that's accurate, to some extent. But the beauty of this novel is its sheer passion for books/the written word and the intense emotions fiction can evoke.  I think, as book lovers, you'll allow me to indulge myself with this lovely quote from the novel:   We need necessary books, books we can read the day after a funeral, when we have no tears left from all our crying, when we can hardly stand for the pain; books that will be there like loved ones… books for those nights when no matter how exhausted we are we cannot sleep, and all we want is to tear ourselves away from obsessive visions; books that have heft and do not let us down… We have no time to waste on insignificant books, hollow books, books that are here to please.  We want splendid books, books that immerse us in the splendour of reality and keep us there; books that prove to us that love is at work in the world next to evil, right up against it, at times indistinctly, and that it always will be, just the way that suffering will always ravage hearts. We want good novels. We want books that leave nothing out: neither human tragedy nor everyday wonders, books that bring fresh air to our lungs.  And even if there is only one such book per decade, even if there is only one Vies miniscules every ten years, that would be enough. We want nothing else.   On another note, there's a great deal of discussion between the characters of the great French novels, so my including it here seems very apt!  Edit: formatting."

Sartre: Well, shit, I don't need to say what an important writer he was. Try pairing him with some Simone de Beauvoir for good measure. Mauriac: Won the Nobel somewhere in the 50's. Therese is hearty fare, but definitely, definitely worth reading. Kundera: He's been writing in French for many years now, so I'd lump him in here. There is an argument to be made that he's never quite topped the books he wrote in Czech (The Joke, Unbearable Lightness), but books like Slowness and The Festival of Insignificance are wonderful books in my opinion.

I hate typing on kindle so I didn't go into it yesterday... anyway, the basic premise is about coal miners in northern France going on strike. It didn't sound that interesting to me but I picked it up on a whim and found myself really drawn in. It's a pretty bleak novel, one feels properly horrified at the working conditions then coupled with the near starvation of the workers barely making enough to feed themselves. I thought it did a fantastic job of painting the struggle of working class then and there were some really vivid scenes depicting mob mentality that'll stick with me for a long time. And you know how sometimes you read a modern book and things start climbing to that apex of dramatic events and, while thrilling, you just sorta know the main characters will be okay in the end?

Has a way to let feelings emerge without explaining anything. You can sometimes be unsure what he's talking about, but sure enough you'll get how he is feeling. It's very often simple poems, short verses, he doesn't say much, but you feel it more surely than if he had developed his thought. Alcools is a good place to start if you're curious.   As for novels, I didn't see Stendhal mentionned. Greatly entertaining, and so beautiful...

She’s a widow. This is a story about the limitless ecstasies of the imagination, but we want to respect the complex lives of our young viewers, so sometimes things are very real.   I was reading about this on a blog about screenwriting a while ago. Parents are often single in shows and movies at about this degree of separation from said parents (that is, a story not even about the kid, but about their dog or toys or imaginary adventures or something). Interaction with the parent happens often enough that they need to have some personality, but not so often for the script to need two characters in that position. So this removes both the need to pay another actor, for the writers to spend limited lines on conveying a  distinct style and personality, and on the viewers' imaginations and memory."

The US's not  so great policies when it came to combating the drug war.  She frames all of this within people/interviews with people she has met that are living in Colombia.  It was well written and kept me engaged throughout.    Ghost Wars - Steve Coll   Steve Coll writes of the CIA's involvement in Afghanistan, from the Soviet invasion up until Sept 11th.  Well researched and it is written so well it at times seemed like a fiction thriller.    1491 and 1493 - Charles Mann  1491 looks into how the Americas looked before Columbus arrived.  1493 looks at what they call the Columbian Exchange, and how things like food that came from the Americas made it around the world.    Understanding Power - Noam Chomsky  Now you should probably take what Chomsky has to say with a grain of salt.  He is no historian or political scientist, so his histories and analysis may be off.  I am no Chomskyite (I found the two other books of his I checked out uninteresting), but this book will always have a place in my top books because it got me to look at the world/people/politics from a different perspective than I was used to.  It is also the book that got me to look at the concept of power amongst people/nations.  The concept of power and the abuse of power is something that I still continue to read, write, and research about in my own personal capacity.  Even though I have ""moved on"" from Chomsky's analysis I feel this book had such an impact on my views that back in college (10+ years ago) one of my professors told me that the best papers I would write for his classes were the ones about people who were ""oppressed"" by ""power."""

Makes you wonder how the hell our country (if you're an American) could let one of its strongest cities once upon a time end up that way.  ""There Are No Children Here"" by Alex Kotlowitz is my go-to nonfiction book for people who are on the fence about nonfiction. Anyone I've ever known who's read it loves it and claims it changed how they view the world. It follows a pair of siblings growing up in inner city Chicago in the late 80's/early 90's. Incredibly moving. Another ""how did this happen in our country"" book with a more personal touch.  ""Helter Skelter"" by Vincent Bugliosi is great if you're into true crime at all, or simply want to understand the hows and/or whys of Charlie Manson. A lot of people find it to be procedural, but I found it to be absolutely chilling.  ""The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace"" is an engaging read about the struggle for a genius from the inner city to find his place in the world. I read this over Christmas break and found it to be well-written and moving, too.  ""Columbine"" should be required reading for anyone. Read that over Christmas break as well, and thought it was a great example of reporting and clarifying myths about the shooting that have pervaded for so long.  ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X' is a great standby. Can't go wrong there.  If you're looking for politics and lean left, ""The New New Deal"" about the stimulus package that Obama passed in 2008 is more than worthwhile. It's long but reads well and helps get into all the goings-on that led to the passage of a pretty darn big deal, even if the messaging and ""selling"" of it were terrible."

books,3dickf,Tzipity,2,Thu Jul 16 22:34:58 2015 UTC,"What kind of subjects are you interested in? Non-Fiction is incredibly broad and while some may bore you to tears, you can't go wrong following your interests.   I second the Math Roach books and that was my first thought. She's amusing and pretty factual but not boring at all.   Are you at all into memoirs or auto/biographies? I'm a big memoir fan as are my parents so we've been swapping memoirs and bios my whole life. Read one from your favorite singer or actor or politician. (You will probably like memoir better than a biography as biographies can get so overwhelmed in facts where as memoirs are written by the subject themselves and usually in a narrative style about a set period in their life). Check out funny ones like Tina Fey or Any Poehler, etc. I also think everyone should read Elie Weisel's Night which is a small book about his time in the Holocaust. Dark and sad but profound and probably the best on that subject.  I enjoy essays a lot and there's way more variation in the genre than you'd think. Many are kind of like brief memoirs. You could try a Best American Essays collection to get a taste of different writers and essay styles. I'm a big fan of that collection.   Most of all though I think the best non fiction to try is to find something that really lines up with your interests. So hard to recommend but I can almost assure you there's a non fiction book out there that will be perfect for you. I majored in Middle East Studies and am a political junkie and Israeli politics is my obsession. Found a book about an American who worked as a speech writer in the Israeli government. Was sort of a humorous memoir. And it blew my mind that it existed, like the perfect book for me specifically. And I adored it. But that's so niche-y most people probably wouldn't. I love finding books like that though. You almost can't go wrong if its a subject you're passionate about."

I've always had an interest in the psychology of literature, in both the narrators, and the characters themselves. Thus, I do admire the works of Oliver Sacks, who writes as prosaically as any great author. I would recommend 'The man who mistook his wife for a hat'.

One way to manage them, if you'd like to keep them but don't want to see them, is to put the book back on the shelf with the spine of the DJ facing in (covering the fore edges of the book), with the flaps and sides clapped to the outside of the book.  basically: on backwards.  That way, the dj is kept with the book, protects the boards/covers, and yet you can still see the cloth spine (if you prefer).  This will flatten the fold of the dust jacket where the flaps turn in, but better than losing it altogether or trying to store the things elsewhere.  I just keep them on.  They are a designed part of the 'experience' and, at least in theory, the author had some input (for books where the author has a rep and can dictate those sorts of things).  It's a paradox, but this is near-absolute truth.... the dust jacket (in the rare book world) is almost always far more valuable than the book itself.  Why? because people throw them away, they are rare, and collectors want the complete package.  My standard example...  A First Edition of The Great Gatsby (without the pictorial dust jacket) can be had for $20-30K.  WITH the dust jacket, that price can be $200,000 to $300,000  EDIT: added quick pic of what I meant"

books,3dgv5m,StephenKong,2,Thu Jul 16 22:12:57 2015 UTC,"Okay, well let's take a step back here and examine this from an outside the box perspective. It seems to me that the writer is limited by more than their imagination, and indeed, so is everyone who sets out with a creative vision. The budget argument begins to look a bit weak when you consider that factors such as time, access to proper equipment and materials, and pure circumstance are all things which can affect the development of books, TV, film, video games, and anything that is made. All of these are limiting factors which are more important than budget in a film. Of course, I'm forgetting the biggest factor, people. People are the most unpredictable factor in creative mediums. After all, your audience is the most important thing, is it not? But you can never ever second guess what your audience wants to experience, because people are complex and it is impossible to understand all of them."
books,3dgv5m,iamingreatpain,2,Thu Jul 16 22:48:15 2015 UTC,"Well we may just have to agree to disagree. Having worked some in film, the constraints of budget and other outside factors like shooting schedules for actors can drastically impact work. Scratch that, I'd say they ALWAYS impact every single TV show or film.   It's why TV shows do ""bottle"" episodes, or why certain segments of TV shows can be so much worse (example: the Dorne storyline in last season of Game of Thrones had a rush turnaround and much smaller film team).   Yeah, sure, of course all art forms get impacted by money and other factors, but a novelist will never have to write off a character because the actor lands a better gig or cancel their plan for an army of dragons because the FX budget can only make one. Those factors in film are huge.   But that doesn't mean film is better or worse than books. It's just one difference."

It's much easier to empathize and identify with a character on the page, subconsciously filling their shoes. Descriptions so lovely and evocative - yet everyone who reads it will have their own version in their mind."
books,3dgv5m,serke,4,Thu Jul 16 14:46:08 2015 UTC,"TLDR SHORT VERSION  Reading stimulates your brain, increases linguistic skill, increases empathy and helps keep the Alzheimer's away   http://www.buzzfeed.com/erinlarosa/12-scientific-ways-reading-can-actually-improve-your-life  It's scientifically probable the staring at a computer or TV screen will rot your eyes and not just your brain because the refresh rate causes your eyes to semi-permanently defocus themselves  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17150204  also TV sucks  TLDR MEDIUM VERSION  The people who write books are typically just better writers. It's not that there aren't also good screenwriters, but typically books have far more depth and you can do things that just don't work well on the screen. It's no surprise when you realize that so many movies were originally books - because the best writers are writing books.  The biggest problem with TV and film is the money making motive. Not that people who write books don't wish to make money from their art as well, but the issues of money inherent in the business prevent lots of good quality art from making it to the screen and damage the artistic integrity of the TV and Film industry far more than the world of poetry and prose.  REGARDING WHAT MOVIES DON'T HAVE  The format of a book allows the author to do things that just ""don't work"" in movies such as explain philosophical and conceptual material. The flip side of this is that many of the best books don't get made in to movies because the books are not visual enough.  This is also one of the main complaints by most people who read the book first and didn't like the movie - the movie is just a fraction of the depth and interest that exists in the book - it's a watered down and heavily edited (i.e. lots of important material is removed) to fit in a very narrow time band of between 1 and 3 hours.  There's also often a considerable amount of creative wordplay that just doesn't find its way in to movies, good examples of such creative wordplay are people such as James Joyce or Hunter S. Thompson - this type of verbal gymnastics just doesn't generally make for good screenplays because screenplays have an emphasis on human dialog and images rather than description, narration and exposition or creative pairings of words that please the mind. This type of strange and disjointed wordplay doesn't typically make for good human dialogue.  REGARDING THEATER AND FILM  Some films are great works of art, and even some screenplays, but typically those works of art are much more focused in the medium of visual expression and the artistic expression is a visual one. There are always exceptions to the rule, but this is the general rule.  Also, typically, theater stands a cut above television and movies due in large part because many if not most audiences are willing to be challenged by social issues and social commentary when they go to a real play with live actors and many if not most play houses will stage plays with content that just won't make it in to TV or movies because it doesn't sell or it's too controversial. As with anything there's good and bad - there are small art houses doing interesting performance, and there are big budget Broadway productions encouraging you to drool on your popcorn while you drink your diabetes through a straw.  Glengarry Glen Ross is an exception to this rule, but then again it was first a Tony Award winning play before adapted into a movie staring a young Kevin Spacey (who all too many people probably only now know for his role in Television on Netflix) and I can nearly guarantee that the movie version was not the kind of ""summer blockbuster hit"" (read between the lines: money maker) that e.g. Spiderman 57 was or whatever drivel was going around this year.  I personally love film, but it still generally stands true that the quality of craftsmanship (this means the words, because unless you're 5, books don't usually have pictures) in each medium goes:   #1 Good books #2 Good films #3 ... there is no number three because everything else is basically shit (poetry is so different it's difficult to compare and less relevant to this discussion) #666 below the shit, there's TV   REGARDING TELEVISION  I am unabashedly unapologetic when I say that TV is absolute shit. No sorry, I was incorrect, it's worse than shit and is the lowest form of thing in existence. It's the backwash, lukewarm, brain rotting device we have all been told it is by our parents. It's not that film and theater don't have their place, it's that TV is meaningless drivel with the worst writers with the most melodramatic acting and dialogue, and it's all built to sell products. Are there one or two shows that don't absolutely suck donkey rectum? Sure, but even those are generally trite, superficial, slapstick or overly melodramatic and on and on. HBO is somewhere in between, they're higher class TV but they're still TV.  Frank Zappa succinctly expressed some thoughts about what gets lost and some of the other problems of a pictorial medium, specifically regarding MTV, also highly relevant to e.g. the Grammy Awards, Academy Awards etc:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgVUei2853A (approx listening time 3-4min)"
books,3dgv5m,upvotz4u,5,Thu Jul 16 05:03:29 2015 UTC,"See I can't say I agree with that quality of craftsmanship rating. Film is probably the MOST DIFFICULT artistic medium to work in. Even cheap movies can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and require hundreds of people all collaborating to make it happen.   Now I know what you're thinking: ""effort does not equate to quality, you fuckass."" Fair point, but if we're talking about CRAFTSMANSHIP, I feel like effort is something to take into consideration.   Plus, I personally consider film to be the ultimate art form in the sense that incorporates damn near every other medium into it. Music, drama, photography, writing, costume/set design, dance, etc etc. Just in this scene from The Fall right here there is so much shit going on. You can analyze it through the lens of several different art forms."

Screenwriters are still a step below in my opinion. Playwrites blur the lines a bit because there's often, as I mentioned more ""challenging"" subject material and audiences are willing to watch things at a play that they won't accept in a movie. But still there's the usually unescapable eventuality that your play must be rooted in more-or-less generally-understandable human dialogue in order for your audience to not get completely lost. And if you talk about plays with no words, well, you're basically talking about performance art, which some of it can be good, but again, it's apples an oranges to compare the visual parts of the medium and the linguistic parts, so it doesn't do us much good to bother with comparisons of the music in a film or the particular imagery in a performance art piece.  Films absolutely have great art and music, as I mentioned, I love film - but as much as I love film, as far as actual writing goes, authors of books stand (again in general) a cut above screenwriters in terms of quality.  I can think of several actually amazing literary original screenplays that I love, but again, consider how much most of ""the movies"" poach material from books - because that's where the best writers go, to write novels.  That's just the way it is, and I think it's because the best writers, who are at the peak of their craft, understand, that, writing wise, books are the medium with the most depth, the most challenge and the most expression, in terms of pure words and wording alone."

Although movies like Interstellar or Contact did a good job, Carl Sagan's novel on which Contact was based was a lot more in-depth, with many interesting details."

Japanese society fundamentally demand respect for elders and authority. A distopion society for them is one where the youth are disrespectful, apathetic, unintelligent and lazy, thus battle royale is born - to force the youth out of this state.

But they're a kid, they're not much of a leader.  Pretty soon they're Trotsky to a minor side character in the books, who is now in charge and taking the part of Stalin in that analogy.  The revolution goes on to become something horrific to the teen hero who is basically a good person and she doesn't realize that all along people were hitching their wagon to hers not because  they agreed but because they knew the old order would fall and didn't want to end up dead or ruined financially.  The new leader is rewriting the history books and suddenly things SHE did are credited to the leader!  Then a short time later she is painted as the villain! A counter-revolutionary!  The ruling party now killed or threw out anyone with actual experience, so they're running things in such a disastrous way it would be funny if not for the starvation deaths and the prison camps.  And then it happens, arrested for anti-revolutionary acts she is back in prison again.  There is a man with a clip board looking her over the way a man chooses a golf club.  ""Might make a good midfield scrabbler,"" he says, to his colleague.  ""she's too skinny, she'd get creamed in a fistfight""  ""Sniper? Backfield defense, big rifle""  The man nods, ""I should say yes, rocket rifle, save points off the roster if we skimp on the armor.""  She sighed, ""do they still call it the arena?"" She asked.  The man's face turned severe, ""the arena was counter-revolutionary! A travesty! And you will not speak until spoken to, player!""  She looked down, out of habit, old well-worn habit, from when she was a girl... A girl that played midfield, with a carbine and a few flares.    ""You are to play the great game,"" the man continued.  She didn't react, she couldn't anymore.

In other books there are hints that Palpatine and the Chiss (the most well known of which is Grand Admiral Thrawn who was also notable for being one of few aliens employed by the Empire, and at such a high rank) knew of some undisclosed, extra-galactic threat. Sooo... what if all of Palpatine's machinations and planet-destroying-weapon-building (see also, the Sun Crusher) wasn't really to take over the galaxy, but to protect it from an invasion that no one else was capable of fighting? And while the Rebellion may have been nice in the short term what if it really ended up costing billions of lives and planets and historical records and culture when they couldn't fight the Vong as effectively as Palpatine could have?

Also, since reading the Darth Bane book (I've only read the first.) I really don't like the Jedis, I'm rooting for the Sith because they're the only ones I feel that truly understand the force.

They don't understand the force any better than the Jedi, as evidenced by the toll their use of the dark-side takes on their bodies. There's an argument that the Jedi also don't inherently understand the force any better than the Sith, but that's a different can of worms.  Also, the empire was pretty bad in a lot of ways, including summary execution of civilians not charged with a crime (see Luke's foster parents) enslavement of entire species (wookies), and the leadership-approved anhilation of one of the empire's most populous planets.  Tarkin was just one leader, but his crew went along with it and he took action with the consent of the Emperor. This is evidence of much more wide-spread corruption and evil within the Empire, all of which we cannot be shown because of the limitations of how much time they have to show the empire on-screen.  Naturally, the Empire will have decent people working for it, but evidence lends to the conclusion that these are the exception, and corruption is the rule."

People tend to think that if an action has risk, it's inherently bad- but there's really not a whole lot of perfectly safe options when playing around with cosmic forces. The logical extreme of safety is pretty much what TTGL's setting looked like, at the start of the show- people living dirty, meaningless lives of drudgery, accomplishing nothing and going nowhere. The Anti-Spiral was imposing a ridiculous extreme of safety on the universe; even if we accept the obvious, that moderation in all things is necessary, removing the presently extremist state of things is needed to achieve moderation- even if it also opens up the possibility of going overboard to the other end. To achieve positive change, you have to first drill through the status quo that prevents all change.  That's also what TTGL is about, though- the faith that people will get it right eventually. Believe in humanity, and all that jazz.   Sorry if I got a bit rambly, but I think that the 'lel simon fukt up and he was the real bad guy' interpretation of TTGL doesn't do the show enough justice."

There were obviously going to be cases like Bernard and Helmholtz that didn't quite fit in their model, but they had a solution for that too by sending them to the islands.

Offhand, I can't think of any specifically YA dystopian fiction with a ""Utopia Justifies The Means"" ending (although there's more than a few with a whiff of it), but there's plenty of SF classics that use it to good effect - e.g. the already mentioned 1984, as well its inseperable companions Brave New World and Fahrenheit 451.    You might also be surprised just how much New Wave SF fits this description - try Harry Harrison's less comedic works such as the To The Stars trilogy (Homeworld, Wheelworld, & Starworld), and In Our Hands, The Stars (alt. title The Daleth Effect). There's also an early Robert Asprin work, The Cold Cash War, which has a tinge of darkness to it.  I can think of a couple of almost fitting dystopian YA works - look for Robert C. O'Brien's Z for Zachariah (yes the guy who wrote Mrs Frisby & the Rats of Nimh), or the much harder to find Waiting for the End of the World by Lee Harding.  But if you really want some fucked up YA fiction where the bad guys win most of the time, try some Robert Cormier. It's not dystopian, but it is depressing as all hell."

There are two main characters who try to change the dominating system. One wants to join them and change it from the inside, not breaking the law and showing that you can bring change without risking the lives of innocents. The other character, whom we follow for most of the series hates the system so much, that he is willing to kill whoever stands in his way. He starts a rebellion and commits quite a few warcrimes and uses very dirty tactics, even disposing the lives of comrades to teick the enemy. The interesting twist at the end of the story is, that both of them look back on the things they had to do to reach the spot they ended up in and then both decide that they have to pay for their sins. This is then followed by an excellent twist in that both characters finally work together and sacrifice themselves for the people, corrupting their legacy and building a lie, that could male the world a better place."

I had been looking for the same thing as you and getting mightily tired of all the ""fight the powa"" YA books going around... Red Rising is a cure-all to that. It starts off very typical... and slowly sees the main character transforming into all that he originally hated, while realizing that there is value in his new role and behavior.  The author handles that interior conflict wonderfully well. It's really a genius series, that I'll be sad to see coming to an end next year. Give it a run.

The rebellion made no sense (they all got lost on the way?)  The ending was terrible.  The fight scenes were typical flashy Korean cinema nonsense.  Where did they even have cows for steak?  Why a goddamn sushi bar?  Why did the rebellion pause for school?  Why were the people in the back of the train kept at all?  Why did the club kids get all riled up, march 20 feet, and then just pose on one side of a little walkway for the rest of the movie?  There are few movies that irritate me as much as Snowpiercer.

books,3dap3g,MrMurgatroyd,22,Tue Jul 14 21:25:45 2015 UTC,"Judge it for what it is, a surrealistic comment on society. The film, I believe, is meant to feel somewhat fantastical. Tilda's character is a complete caricature, the sushi car is ridiculous, and surely there are better ways to repair the small spaces in the engine than keeping a group of people in subhuman conditions only to take their kids every once in a while.   But if you are irritated by the film's lack of realism then you're looking at it the wrong way. Do you get irritated by the same thing in Alice in Wonderland? As a surreal sci-fi allegorical film, snowpiercer is superb and that's why it has such good reviews."

I get the societal allegories of Snowpiercer, but so much of it was just badly slapped together and seemed to lose any cohesive timing whenever they entered a new train car.  The broad idea is great, the actual execution and lack of story or planning past ""stop the train, the snow is melting"" made the movie a miserable failure for myself."

books,3dap3g,Minitell,5,Tue Jul 14 23:32:48 2015 UTC,"I like this idea, too, but it's essentially anathemic to young adult fiction.  The whole concept is that teens want to identify and feel empowered by fiction aimed at them.  Adults Are Useless, always evil, or just outright not present at all; because otherwise the teen protagonist wouldn't have the time to stand out and be special.  The first step to letting the teen be the hero and fix the problems is to eliminate or suppress the dozen or so much, much easier ways to fix the situation via adults and the established government as it is.  The Hunger Games comes just about the closest to this trope, because the adults who try to work with/use Katniss are giving her advice that's generally very right, and she just stubbornly ignores them or just gets used and manipulated anyway.  She's really only the hero because they needed someone to be the hero.  I realize your post is basically a variant of ""why are teens so stupid"", and I recognize it as the largely sarcastic and frustrated outlet that it is, but the nugget of truth in it is that teens just aren't old enough to understand most of the world, but they think they are.  YA fiction just panders to that.  If they felt like actually thinking instead, there's plenty of other books for them to read, like 1984 and Ender's Game."

Everyone references Gone Girl, which is accurate in terms of its reliability, but its not the same thing. Although just for recommending purposes Sharp Objects I think was a better book than Gone Girl and if you haven't read that yet you should check it out."

It was a little jarring the first time she switched which character's perspective I was reading.  My fault for not paying attention to the chapter title, but I still didn't like the transition."

books,3de1gr,SmashAction,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:05:39 2015 UTC,I'm the opposite.  It took me weeks to get through this book because I just couldn't get into it.  I almost had to force myself to finish it.  I have the ending figured out pretty early on and wasn't too surprised by it at all.    The book was fine but not even close to one of my favorite mysteries I've read.  I feel like I shoud like it a lot more but I just don't and I think the reason why is that I didn't like any of the characters in the story.

If you read it on Kindle, check out the Popular Highlights section. Being brutally honest, the ""I'm so emotionally torn, all my life is darkness and pain!"" sob stuff and crazy logic from the female characters just made my eyes roll. I would recommend it tho.

It gets lumped in with Gone Girl because both narrators are deeply flawed, unreliable women. That sort of protagonist is usually a middle aged man, so when it's not, people take notice. I found the book emotionally draining, not because of exhilaration or plot twists, but because it's downright claustrophobic. You're trapped in the head of a bitter woman trapped in a small and squalid life."

With which of your Ready Player One characters do you most identify? Are there any memorable experiences you can share from the creation of Fanboys? What are your own all-time favourite video games?

books,3da3q3,CryoftheBanshee,163,Tue Jul 14 19:33:48 2015 UTC,"What thrills/concerns do you have regarding the upcoming film adaptation of Ready Player One?   It's all thrills now, really, since I'm blessed enough to have one of the most successful directors in the history of cinema adapting my novel. I will confess that when I think about the possibility of John Williams scoring the film, my brain starts to shut down.   With which of your Ready Player One characters do you most identify?   I try my best to get under the skin of all of my characters while I'm writing them, but Wade and Halliday are probably the two I identify with the most. I'm not nearly as good at programming or video games as either of them though.   Are there any memorable experiences you can share from the creation of Fanboys?   I have a small non-speaking role in Fanboys. I play one of the Star Trek fans in Seth Rogen's posse in Riverside, Iowa and also in the Vegas scenes. I got to tackle Hutch, the character based on me, and I was also in a scene with William Shatner! But the best moment for me was probably when I got to go to Skywalker Ranch to help with the final sound mix on the film. I think I'm the first Star Wars fanboy in history to ever break in to Skywalker Ranch by writing a movie about doing that very thing. You can read a lot more anecdotes from the making of the film on my blog: ernestcline.com/blog   What are your own all-time favourite video games?   Black Tiger and Battlezone. Those are the only two coin-op arcade machines I own, and each one played a role in inspiring RPO and ARMADA.   How do you think the increasing popularity of Virtual Reality will affect us?   It's going to change everything! Not just gaming, but also movies, television - even the way you record your graduation or wedding. It's a very exciting time."

It was a really nice adventure and I am looking forward to Armada to come to Brazil.  I would like to know more about the process of creating the references in the book Ready Player One (Did not read Armada yet). Did you replay the games, listened to the songs and watched most of it as you were writing and tried to fit them in certain parts of the story or did they come naturally from your memories as you were writing them?   Also, is the movie really coming out? I can see the problems with copyright and i am actually surprised to see it work out - but i hope it will! What are the problems you are facing other than the copyright issues ?  For my last question, something more fun: Let's say someone read Ready Player One and loved it but decided not to read Armada.

And yes, I did replay certain games and movies while I was writing RPO, but only to make sure I got certain details correct. For example, I rewatched the scenes in WarGames that appear in the book to refresh my memory. I also used MAME to jump to the final Pac-Man split screen, to make sure I described playing through it properly. Thanks for your questions!"

He's the narrator of the audiobook for ARMADA, too, and he just kills it. I'm so lucky and grateful to have him collaborate with me. I really hope he also nabs a role in the film.

Negative reviews of Armada have focused on the palpable usage of pop culture as not much more than a roll call of in-jokes and obscure references for their own sake, nothing deeper. I'd love to hear your reaction."
books,3da3q3,Moustache_Ryder,156,Tue Jul 14 19:29:21 2015 UTC,"I personally don't see any difference between culture and pop culture. Pop culture is the culture I grew up in - the only culture I've ever really known. And if something isn't considered a part of popular culture, then what is it? Unpopular culture? Why would you make an unpopular culture reference, unless you're trying to be obscure?  I view pop culture references as just one of the many tools I have as a writer to tell my story and convey meaning to the reader. But I also do my best to make sure the story still works for readers who aren't familiar with any of the things I reference, just as I did with Ready Player One. In the end, you can't write to please critics - you have to write the kind of story you enjoy telling in the way you want to tell it, and trust that other people with a similar sensibility will enjoy reading it."

books,3da3q3,QFDRKF,51,Wed Jul 15 01:06:32 2015 UTC,"About 15 years ago, I stumbled across an spoken-word comedy album called Ultraman is Airwolf, by Ernie Cline. (The album went missing a few years later, and I strongly suspect an ex-girlfriend appropriated it when we split. However, a quick Google search shows me it is now available as a free download. Yay!)  Because of my love for that album, I discovered a movie written by that same person a few years later called Fanboys. And, of course, it was impossible to miss the media blitzkrieg of Ready Player One and Armada. I'm so incredibly pleased to see you succeed and reach a nationwide audience like your talent deserves. But Ultraman is Airwolf remains - to me - as the best product you have published to date. (though, to be fair, I haven't read Armada yet...)  Perhaps it's nostalgia, or because I listened to the album so many times that I memorized some of the bits, or because it was the first thing that you put out that I got to hear. But your short-form comedy essays are still hilarious, and I only wish there were more. So I guess my question is: do you still write short-form comedic essays? Have you considered releasing (or even re-releasing) a collection of short-form essays, now that you have significant name recognition?"
books,3da3q3,turkeybacon97401009,56,Tue Jul 14 20:32:02 2015 UTC,"Hey Mr. Cline,  I'm going to throw you a pretty heavy question here. Both Ready Player One and Armada, due to the increasing popularity of both books, have come under mixed literary scrutiny. In particular, a review by Slate has heavily critisized Armada, remarking that its plot is highly similar (possibly identical in ways) to The Last Starfighter and even Ender's Game. The review concludes with:   Armada is ... a book-length love letter of cultural hyperlinks that refer you elsewhere but contain no meaningful content themselves. Take away the shoutouts and the plot points borrowed wholesale from far better works of science fiction, and the story in Armada doesn't just fall apart—it doesn't exist at all. It’s simply a long series of secret handshakes, designed to grant access to the most enduring and beloved fantasy world of so many aging gamers: the idea that nothing will ever be more important than the things they loved when they were young.   I know many people here don't care much about what critics have to say, myself included, but I am interested in hearing what your reaction is to the above quoted statement.   Do you believe that your books should be viewed primarily as fun works of entertainment, designed to appeal to geek culture, or do your books possess thematic merit beyond what is superficially stated in the text through its plot and multitudinous allusions? In other words, is there a message, moral, or social critique that you are offering in your novels? What is the significance of your writing style's heavy use of references?  What do you have to say in response to the Slate review that Armada appropriates the plot of other sci fi stories and is consequently unoriginal?"
books,3da3q3,bluesuz,68,Tue Jul 14 21:12:38 2015 UTC,"Just finsihed Ready Player One in preparation for reading Armada as part of the /r/books bookclub and enjoyed it.  Money plays heavily in the story with IOI wanting to futher monetize OASIS; a large part of the population is poor and relying on assistance programs or shady means to aquire the funds to maintain their real and virtual lives; the prize money for finding the egg and more.   Wade seems to be both wealthy and barely making it by the middle of the book with his high bills, low paying job, prize money, and endoresement income. Is this an inconsistancy or an impovrished 18 yearold handling finances for the first time? It's mentioned that GSS keeps increasing teleportation fees which sounds like an omonous bit of forshadowing that they aren't as virtuous as hoped when compared to IOI. Was this a red herring? A throw away bit of story telling to show that Wade's new wealth doesn't actually go that far? or something else?   Identity seems to be another strong theme. The characters all define a new identity of their own making in OASIS; privacy & guarding one's real name is very important; characters reject or choose not to conform to the identities bestowed upon them by birth.   With the talks of movie adaptations and the importance of the phsyicality of the characters, are you worried about the casting or artistic decisions for the characters and their avatars? will you be part of these decisions?   Thanks for being our first bookclub author!"

books,3da3q3,Clizznas,9,Tue Jul 14 19:13:45 2015 UTC,"I noticed that RPO includes a lot of popcultural references outside of the 80's, specifically ones that are popular to todays nerd: WoW, Cowboy Bebop, Firefly, etc.  Did you consciously consider that all pop culture seems to end at 2015 in the RPO? Did you ever toy with making up a work from sometime after 2014?  I really liked the book, but that oberservation took me out a little from the suspension of disbelief."
books,3da3q3,kdd9000,12,Tue Jul 14 22:12:09 2015 UTC,"This was a disappointing AMA - literally 7 responses from Cline.   I get the feeling that RPO was written with the intention of making it a screenplay - but rather than focusing on thought provoking allegories that may translate well to the screen, he focused on aesthetics and broad-segment 'insider' references that have a high likelihood of being licensed for the movie.  I read RPO, and I was left with a feeling that each and every pop-culture reference could have been replaced with any other pop-culture reference. E.g., instead of 'three is the magic number' - use some vague reference to 'The Three Amigos'.  After reading the book I was asking myself if maybe I was not deep enough into the 80s to get the deeper themes - I was hoping for confirmation of that with this AMA. But nope - the most interesting insight I got out of it was that Jaws is the only other 'first novel' Spielberg has adapted... Ugh.  Anyway, sorry to be so negative. It could still be a great movie - but Spielberg will have to bring some genius into the story."

So I was wondering if you read any books to get ready to write RP1? I'm not sure if authors do that but it kinda seems like they would. I guess I'm asking what your biggest inspirations for RP1 were, other than the obvious movies and games mentioned in the book. Thanks!"

My question is, the world of Ready Player One is huge and has a history covered in the book, but have you considered making more books or maybe even short stories that aren't continuing Wade's story, but gives more depth and insight to the OASIS and the history behind it, or maybe even a full version of Anorak's Almanac?"

My favorite band of all time, Rush, plays a prominent role (I really hope you can get the rights to give them that role in the movie). Do you love Rush as much as Halliday and Wade? If so, what are some of your favorite Rush songs, and what is one that you think is really underappreciated? Do you have other bands you really love?

Thank you for restoring my love of reading with this imaginative story.  Now for a question. I'ma huge film nerd, and was beyond excited when Spielberg was announced to direct.

In RPO, it seems like the near ending of the story tries to flip this on its head by introducing two prominent female protagonists. However, multiple times in the same book, the same kind of ""filthy casual"" infighting is depicted as a positive thing, even leading to certain plot points being easily surpassed by Wade while his opponents failed. Do you feel like your message is somewhat scrambled by your protagonist using that same toxic culture to actually win the Oasis egg hunt?"

Your awesome story along with Wil Wheaton's voice is perfect. Also, I am uber jealous of your DeLorean as I love your videos on Youtube showing it off. A few questions: 1. You mention in RPO that LadyHawke is cannon for the hunt. Was this movie a guilty pleasure of yours? 2. Why did you pick Joust as the game to fight Acererak to get the copper key? Also, was this game actually easier playing the left side (ostrich)?  3. Somewhere in my basement I have an Activision Explorers' Club patch that I got from playing Pitfall on my Atari 2600 and snapping a photo of my high score and sending it in.

I stopped at the airport book store looking for something to tide me over for the duration of the flight. The bookstore clerk handed me your book. At first I did not think I would enjoy it, but after 2 hours of waiting, I started reading. Time faded, nothing mattered. I spent 10 hours reading until my flight was able to leave. All in all I spent 32 hours straight reading your book front to back during my flights, when I finished I just started over. At the time, I was not in a good place. It was very dark. I did try to end my life. Being able to escape reality and forget about everything, was something I didn't think could happen. From that day on, I would read Ready Player One whenever I started to fall back into that mindset. No matter how bad I felt your book always made me feel better.

We also host a bunch of events and programs that relate to an aspect of the book. Last year's (2014) pick was Ready Player One.   I have to say, I was so excited by how many of my customers commented to me that they ""never knew they liked SciFi"" and ""would have to find more books like Ready Player One.""  Until I started working at a public library in central Kentucky, I don't think I really understood just how little attention science fiction gets within the general population. But Ready Player One definitely makes the genre accessible to people who would ordinarily only come in for the newest James Patterson or Janet Evanovitch novel. It was great to see my personal favorite genre get some love from the every-man."

As an aspiring writer, I'm curious about your authorship process. How did you stay motivated while writing? Did you ever hit any especially difficult walls as you worked?

Further, do you have any advice for authors who are curious, if not about following in your footsteps (keeping in mind that some shoes can prove quite hard to fill), then about pursuing success as writers?

I am having trouble transitioning from, as you know, a very stripped-down and concise form of writing to prose. I am wondering if you encountered the same problem?

books,3da3q3,The_Eagle_Has_Landed,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:13 2015 UTC,"Mr Cline,  Firstly, thank you for Ready Player One. For as long as I can remember I've had difficulty reading books. Don't get me wrong, I can read an article, or a review, a news story or even a whole wall of text on reedit, but I've always had trouble with reading an actual book.   Ever since I was a wee child I can always remember loving games, and growing up it moved into film too. Owning all of the older consoles and the newer ones too, gaming is still part of my life. I think the thing that really grips my attention is the detail of the story telling and the visuals that film and games provide. I haven't got the most vivid imagination and books have always been a struggle for me. In an attempt to get me to read, my girlfriend purchased an autobiography of a particular someone for Christmas one year, someone that I had always been interested in. A third of the way through was the best I could do before laying it to rest. I haven't read it since.   We recently went away on holiday and on the flight there I noticed she had Ready Player One in her bag. A 6 hour flight put me in a position where reading the first few chapters would help ""kill some time"". Boy, was I right. The way the book was written, how descriptive you were with the characters and how you brought them to life just gripped me like nothing else I had ever read. For the rest of the holiday I spent my spare time just reading Ready Player One, often reading the same page twice because of what had happened in a particular paragraph. I found myself physically gasping and shouting ""what the heck?!"" when certain events unfolded (obviously no spoilers, just in case!), something of which I've never done before with anything I've ever read.   However, at the end of my holiday and after finishing your book I felt pretty hollow. What could I possibly read next that would grip me as much as this book did? True enough, I've ordered Armada, in the hope that the way you tell a story flows through into this new adventure, but if for some reason it doesn't grab me in the same way that Ready Player One did, then at least I found one book that I'm proud to display in my cabinet.   Secondly, if you did, thank you for taking the time to read this. Good luck with Armada and whatever the future brings!"

I told my girlfriend she should read it and after months of pushing her she finally picked it up and is completely in love. You have given her a new-found zest for the nerdy arts and therefore have given us a whole lot of new activities to do together and things to talk about. I really think it's great that you are preserving the things we all loved as kids by putting them into written word(and soon film!) I literally was just invited to attend a VR conference this fall in Seattle, WA because I brought up your book during a VR discussion with my new client and they all perked up and asked if I would like to attend because you would be there. I hope to see you there!   I wish I had known you were doing this AMA so I could have planned a little bit better. If you are ever bored in Seattle let's go to the Add-A-Ball and play some video games. Cheers!   P.S. I loved your role in the ATARI ET documentary.

books,3dcsi5,RabbitInHeadlights,223,Wed Jul 15 06:53:38 2015 UTC,"I found it bland and predictable.  For the nostalga (having been a teen and pre-teen in the 80s) it was ok, but story-wise I didn't find much to be impressed by.  Even the 80s references were more of a ""greatest hits"" sort of thing and didn't really reflect a truly nerdy delving into any of the more esoteric aspects of 80s culture that could have given the story extra depth.  The main character was very much a wish-fulfillment character.  Someone once described it as, ""Twilight for geeks,"" which is a pretty accurate description in my book."

I didn't realize how ""young adult"" the novel would be. It doesn't take long for Wade to go from being a (slightly) sympathetic underdog to a Rich Kid of Instagram, replete with an elitist attitude. Among young adult lit, RPO at least has a novel setting, but other than that, it focused too much on nostalgia porn and what I'll dismiss as ""typical teen issues,"" e.g., romance, money problems, family, fitting-in, &c. It would be difficult to write about a teenager without getting into these issues, but I think that they came at the cost of shifting the novel's attention from the dystopian world (and socio-cultural critique therein) down to the navel."

books,3dcsi5,HarryManilow,47,Wed Jul 15 13:54:32 2015 UTC,"Even though if I enjoyed the ride a lot, there were some flaws in the book that didn't make me enjoy the story at the fullest:   Wade/Parzival, except for his physical appearance, is basically a Gary Stu of gaming and pop culture. He knows pretty much everything and masters a lot of games - including doing a freaking Perfect Game in Pac-Man. The author, through Wade, brought a big load of references to the story - even though knowing them by heart and mastering everything Wade can do would take much more than 5 years. I found mind-boggling that the first riddle hasn't been solved in 5 years even though it was that simple to solve. And actually nobody even found it by accident - in 5 years, the probability of finding this ""randomly"" is still pretty high. And Wade isn't the first gunter to have Latin courses in school... Most people would have made the connection between learning and Ludus.  Pretty much nothing was created from scratch after the OASIS was launched (or it isn't mentioned at all). It seems like from 2012 to 2044, people lived in their past creations - without having a trace of new stories, new heroes, new universes. Basically, any culture that could have existed is basically nonexistent or is dumbed down as something bad. The real world is underexploited - after all, without real world power and energy, the OASIS can't exist.   Cline wanted to put so much references that he probably forgot about the overall coherence of the story. Even though, I really enjoyed it - but some parts made me wonder why, or were quite predictable. It's a first book though.  Could have been the perfect book with more coherence - ends up being just good.   EDIT: A word."

I think my biggest issue was just how two dimensional its appreciation of geek culture is.  I feel like so many people who are into video games/comic books/science fiction have stopped discussing what they like about their favorite things, and instead only talk about how much they like their favorite things.  It's as though I'm supposed to read...

Oh poor Mrs. Oldwoman under my house, the only person who was ever nice to me!...Oh well.   There was definitely a lot of that. The whole book seemed to thrive most of all on the references to old videogame and 80's subculture.

These don't seem to be impediments for most readers, but for some reason they were for me. It felt like a love song to someone I wasn't in love with at all, y'know? And I wasn't in the mood for the romance that was inevitably coming, so I dropped it."

I did however take the audio book out from the library last year to give it a shot on my longer driving nights. I made it about half way through before DNF'ing it and returning it to the library.   The world of RPO was designed in the image of one man, the man who became the most important/influential in the world, and as a result everyone aped him: liked what he liked, watched what he watched, listened to what he listened to, read what he read, etc. so the entire world of RPO was filtered through a white, American, male, suburban, geek experience.   I realized early on that this was a world, just to take one exams, where rap literally didn't exist. And as a child of the 80's, rap was huge as it continued its rise to a significant global art form, and this made no sense to me. This is just one example though.   Pulling back, This to me was sloppy. That the idea hadn't been thought through to its logical ends (think about all the cultures wiped out and the stagnated growth of the existing culture). I wanted to read the story of the people rebelling against this system. So I stopped.   I'll hold off on judging the movie and may even go see it when it comes out.

The ludicrous James Bondish fantasy sequence where he infiltrates the enemy factory. The cartoonishly evil enemy corporation (just ONE?) that is both sinisterly threatening and so incompetent that they don't notice his infiltration. And the inevitable love interest. All topped off with the ham-fisted moral about how all these skills and obsessions that I just literally made sure you needed to have in order to get here?

My big problem was that the book kept going on and on about somewhat mutually exclusive concepts trying to make things seem horrible. Like describing how the main character's life was horrible...but not too horrible, its ok compared with others. At least he's like everybody else around him. Except that for some reason, the fact that he had to get his clothes out of the donation bin (like everybody else) singled him out for being teased and taunted by the others. Nobody has money to spend on anything, so they spend all their money on Oasis. The game that is free to play, except that they come right out and tell you that it costs THOUSANDS of dollars just to leave the starting world (remember, there are no quests or other money generating activities on the starting world). That is literally saying ""You bought this game for free, and now that you are done with the tutorial, you need to pay me $2K to actually play.""  People don't have enough money to spend on food, yet they can spend it on a nice couch in their game? Most people cannot afford the mega-sense rigs that he gets later in the book, so it is not like they are getting any real benefit out of having that couch.  Even further, they show how 'easy' it is to reach max level and how you can support yourself in real life by just running quests and stuff in the game at those levels. Yes the main character is an OP game player (IE: The pac-man scene), but remember all the lessons we get from things like World of Warcraft and Starcraft. People get good at those games just because they are fun, imagine how many people would be good at those games if the ingame rewards could literally pay for their livelihood instead of a shitty job working at a fast food restaurant?  Back and forth, back and forth, constantly just telling you how horrible the world is using examples that are mutually exclusive of each other.  Once he no longer cared about the rest of the world and could just focus on the game, things got better because we no longer heard every 5 pages the stuff I mentioned already.  All that said, I'm pretty stoked for the movie."

Hundreds of planets have been part of an empire under the Padishah emperor, for what seems a very long time (~ maybe 90 generations). The main long distance transport system relies on a guild of navigators, who can make one point identical to another and as such move matter through space fairly easily. All rely on CHOAM, a trading market the whole  known universe gets in on, and the main product it a spice called melange from planet Arrakis, which is a unique product. It let's the guild move stuff through space, as well as increasing lifespan and giving people some clairvoyant powers. The story begins during a period of relative peace on a planet with a charismatic leader whose wife is of the bene gesserit, an organization who are known for some level of manipulation and may themselves rely on the spice melange. Go from there, it's very good."

I think they're actually pretty good. I loved the books and have read them several times. They grow on you quickly.

I hang around a lot of book websites and such so I feel like I'm a lot more in the know about literary fiction so like I know about books that aren't the kind of popular of say James Patterson but are relatively popular amongst booknerd types.   Anyway, gonna take a stab at this with a couple of books and authors that cross my  mind. I'm a huge, huge fan of Israeli author Etgar Keret. He's got a memoir out I need to pick up and gets his short stories published in New Yorker and the like (so check out a piece by him online if you're curious) and I just really love his style. Short, short fiction primarily which I never would've thought I'd like so much but he says so much in so few words and it's maybe a bit quirky or absurdist yet kind of poignant or makes you think. I can't do him justice beyond just saying his work is unlike anything else I've read and just super enjoyable. He ranks high on my favorite contemporary authors list.  I'm also obsessed with Joan Didion. Loved The Year of Magical Thinking (memoir) and just adore her essays though probably not for everyone. I actually haven't read any of her fiction yet though.   Another very acclaimed but not widely read book that just blows my mind by its beauty and the story it tells is The History of Love by Nicole Krauss.   Another breathtaking book I think everyone should read but few have heard of is Rebecca Brown's The Gifts of the Body. It's about a healthcare worker who takes care of AIDS patients from a wide variety of backgrounds. Yes, it will make you cry but it is also just beautiful and such an important work, humanizes AIDS and disease in general.   And okay I'm boring or I like serious books too much. Lol. Also had a lot of trouble deciding what was underrated and just zipped through my favorites list on GR. Im completely out of touch with any sense of the majority or what's popular and just follow my interests (so I majored in Middle East Studies and love ME lit, love essays and memoirs, lgbt books...). I love a good adult oriented (meaning for adults not like erotic lol) graphic novel too. Some truly amazing works there and if you're at all interested I can give you a list of those to check out."

I try to pretend that I am there with them, hanging out in the car/apartment and just experience it as it comes without trying to make a bunch of grandiose connections about what it all means."

Even women who loved him were seriously hurt by him, and it seemed he used the women in his life with disregard for their own well-being.  It's been a long time since I read any of On the Road, but from what I remember the narrator Sal tends to revere Moriarty. Consider that you can step past the narrator's perspective to realize the damage these men cause to the people around them with apparent disregard.  I enjoyed the Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, a book about Ken Kesey and his crew that included Neal Cassady, perhaps because Tom Wolfe was a more neutral observer. Kesey and his crew definitely caused a lot of strife and mayhem even as they professed a desire to explore new moral realms and break free of the bonds of traditionalism.

Some people love it because its a rip-roaring party book, and in some respects, it is. But it is also a post WWII novel about people that had absolutely no idea how to live in the world they had helped build. For what it's worth, I toss it in the stack of work that I'd describe as apocalyptic. Read it with Brautigan's Trout Fishing in America, Carson's Silent Spring, McCarthy's The Road, DeLillo's Point Omega, Harrison's A Good Day to Die maybe watch Mad Max while you're at it... In that context, you probably still wouldn't like the diction or the characters, but if the end doesn't rip your heart and your guts right out, I'm not sure what would. I always liked On the Road, but I liked it a lot more when I understood how senseless and self-destructive all the parties were, and exactly how chronically unhappy everybody was despite the assurances that they were having the time of their lives. Of course, my reading is in no way exclusive or definitive, but there you have it."

What I find is when you're reading his books, you appreciate it a bit more for what what you would call the ""rambling mess"" then the story in general. His books aren't so much  about the ending but more about the journey, on the road specifically. Kerouac is truly a poet in my opinion and when I read his books I find beauty and peace in his words. He was a lover of the world and the people and things in it, and he had this truly honest way of plunging you into his beautiful mind. Its definitely not for everyone I can admit, but I can't compare the way his books make me feel to any other author."

Going around randomly as crooks, exploiting everyone they meet, being general douchebags to all, lastly being forgiven for it somewhat seemingly due to white privelege.  I just couldn't empathize with any of those mad bastards (even though I'm  pretty sure it was the author's intent that I wasn't supposed to). I guess I just wasn't literate enough to suspend my own ego for the sake of someone else's fictional work.   Ah I actually felt the same way about Gene Wolfe's Book of the New Sun stuff.

It seems to me that some books are meant to be read over and over, On the Road being one of them, his style really is a reflection of his environment and the journey he was on. Extremely heavy drinking and drug use, in fact, and I can't be 100% on this but there should be a study confirming it I'll see if I can find it, but examining On the Road is basically a case study in the effects of speed on the brain.  Mad typing, half-formed ideas, seeming madness on the page, as if his mind was moving much too fast for the typewriter to keep up and even with that he typed the 120-ft scroll of On The Road in little over two or three weeks, single spaced, no edits.  In the end he's a mad typist that seems to just let the machine, be it car or typewriter, take him places.

He was really influenced by James Joyce, so I try to read Kerouac's stuff with the whole stream-of-consciousness thing in mind. Not to mention On The Road was written on a Benzedrine binge in I think 3 weeks. Also, the difference between the original scroll and the edited version is insane, so it depends on the text you were reading. I personally started on the edited version, and while it's still pretty rambley it's way more straightforward (and, I mean, there's actual punctuation), but I switched the the original scroll because I have a (theoretical, I'm a chick) hard-on for Jack and I think there's more truth in the original scroll.       His poetry might be more your style, but also the beatniks are known for having a misogynistic undertone (I mean it was the 40's) so that could be part of it. Honestly the women beatniks are mostly (there are some good ones) annoying because all they talk about is men and love. But you can still be into beatnik lit and not like Kerouac. I don't care for a lot of Ginsberg's stuff but I know a bunch of people who do. Sorry this is kind of rambley too! Maybe also try the Dharma Bums. It's post-OTR but before Big Sur where he's honestly pretty depressing. Dharma Bums is more about Zen Buddhism (which is arguably not real Buddhism but that's a whole other topic), and the beatniks (especially Jack) were the first to like really get it going."

Thinking about it more now that my coffee kicked in, that first book, since I haven't read Big Sur yet, is a rambling mess simply because any sort of off the cuff travelling adventure is a big rambling mess.  I have a suspicion of the overall point, but the theme I've always come away with from that book is that their adventures, not unlike life, are not a clean, prepackaged affair, but filthy, covered in the occasional bout of incoherence, joy, and confusion, in the current typical meaning as well as the Neal Stephenson sense of con-fusion, of many things coming together.

Maybe reading it now I'd feel differently, but at the time he just felt like a hypocrite and a pompous ass.  I remember particularly hating his ""haiku"" which was really just a sentence as it was not in haiku format and he's going on about how it's this brilliant haiku.  I also wasn't particularly fond of his ""you can't fall off a mountain"" epiphany.  You can't fall off but you sure as hell can fall down and tumble to your death.  Interestingly enough, as much as I hate Kerouac, I loved Ginsberg.  We read Howl in that same class I thought it was brilliant."

He does way more with language than Kerouac ever did, and he's just overall a better wordsmith.  But okay that makes sense, sure. I like to think that Kerouac isn't exactly about logic and form though. Like for him, a good haiku isn't the one that is in pristine haiku form. And a good epiphany isn't the one you can take to your First-Order logic class. I always felt like that was much the point.

books,3ddk2c,donjindra,3,Thu Jul 16 19:41:25 2015 UTC,"I remember having to read The Subterraneans in a college class. I remember thinking that the first twenty pages or so were a complete mess, an undoing of thinking. I tried reading it over a few times, but kept losing my place, forgetting previously read sentences, and generally blanking out. What could I do but continue to read this load of shit? I had to do it for class. But as I trudged on, I started coming across particular lines and paragraphs of brilliance where the whole narrative seemed to telescope upon, all the words I'd thought I couldn't 'get' converged and blew apart again in one silent and beautiful big bang holy moment--       Our little pleasures at home ar night, she eats an orange, she makes a lot of noise sucking it—    When I laugh she looks at me with little round black eyes that hide themselves in her lids because she laughs hard (contorting all her face, showing the little teeth, making lights everywhere) (the first time I saw her, at Larry O’Hara’s, in the corner, I remember, I’d put my face close to hers to talk about books, she’d turn her face to me close, it was an ocean of melting things and drowning, I could have swimmed in it, I was afraid of all that richness and looked away)—    With her rose bandana she always puts on for the pleasures of the bed, like a gypsy, rose, and then later the purple one, and the little hairs falling black from the phosphorescent purple in her brown as brown as wood—    Her little eyes moving like cats—    We play Gerry Mulligan loud when he arrives in the night, she listens and chews her fingernails, her head moves slowly side to side like a nun in profound prayer—    When she smoked she raises her cigarette to her mouth and slits her eyes—    She reads will gray dawn, head on one arm, Don Quixote, Proust, anything—    We lie down, look at each other seriously saying nothing, head to head on the pillow—    Sometimes when she speaks and I have my head under hers on the pillow and I see her jaw the dimple the woman in her neck, I see her deeply, richly, the neck, the deep chin, I know she’s one of the most enwomaned women I’ve seen, a brunette of eternity incomprehensibly beautiful and for always sad, profound, calm—    When I catch her in the house, small, squeeze her, she yells out, tickles me furiously, I laugh, she laughs, her eyes shine, she punches me, she wants to beat me with a switch, she says she likes me—    I’m hiding with her in the secret house of the night—    Dawn finds us mystical in our shrouds, heart to heart—    ‘My sister!’ I’d thought suddenly the first time I saw her—     A lot of people only know Kerouac through On the Road, which I think does him a huge disservice. He wrote in many different styles, as can be shown between The Town and the City, And the Hippos Were Boiled in Their Tanks, Trisstessa, Desolation Angels, and his poetry. Where On the Road can seem pretentious, flighty, mad, much more mad than a roman candle burning on both ends, books like The Subterraneans and Trisstessa reveal Keroauc to be completely vulnerable and uncensured, in thought, form and expression WHILE maintaining a complete focus on an axiom of characters, feelings and events.      For me, Kerouac was revelatory. I completely lusted for those images of love, insane little poems in the midst of a garbled mess of inadequacy, complete portraits of imperfect people, little diamonds in a sea of sand! How could a passage (like the one above) come to fruition without all the ugliness in between? Those moments were like the end of an equation, over and again, what Kerouac really meant when he said he was for the mad ones, the mad to live. This is the reason these real life poets live the way they live, for maddeningly human moments that define us all.      Anyway, it's my opinion that with authors as viscerally honest and experimental as Keroauc, one needs to cultivate personal connections to fully appreciate the journey. If you can't find that attraction, then quit reading Kerouac entirely. The worst thing you could do is spoil a book by forcing yourself to read today what should be read tomorrow.      Apologies for my own splooge of sappy mess here."
books,3ddk2c,Spirouac,3,Wed Jul 15 20:39:12 2015 UTC,"Here are a few other passages I love entirely:      From Trisstessa:       Tristessa lifts up her tender hands helplessly and looks at me affectionately and sadly, to indicate, 'It is my Pigeon'--'my pretty white Pigeon--what can I do about it?' 'I love it so'.      some people have vibrations that come straight from the vibrating heart of the sun, unjaded..       From Visions of Cody (which was a book made of the notes he took of Neal Cassidy, many of which were transformed in to On the Road):       I'm in love with my life and I'm sticking to it--I mean the belief in it. I may be a distracted wretch but I am still a man and I know how to fight and survive, I have before. Gods, if not help me, if instead barb me, be careful of me, I can catch thunderbolts and pull you down and have done it before. Adieu!      No possible way of avoiding enigmas. Like people in cafeterias smile when they're arriving and sitting down at the table but when they're leaving, when in unison their chairs scrape back they pick up their coats and things with glum faces (all of them the same degree of semi-glumness which is a special glumness that is disappointed that the promise of the first arriving smiling moment didn't come out or if it did it died after a short life)--and during that short life which has the same blind unconscious quality as the orgasm, everything is happening to all their souls--this is the GO--the summation pinnacle possible in human relationships--lasts a second--the vibratory message is on--yet it's not so mystic either, it's love and sympathy in a flash. Similarly, we who make the mad night all the way (four-way sex orgies, three-day conversations, uninterrupted transcontinental drives) have that momentary glumness that advertises the need for sleep we can call it up again mixing it with unlimited other beautiful combinations--shuffle the old file cards of the soul in demented hallucinated sleep--So the people in the cafeteria have that look but only until their hats and things are picked up, because the glumness is also a signal they send one another, a kind of ""Goodnight Ladies"" of perhaps interior heart politeness. What kind of friend would grin openly in the faces of his friends when it's the time for glum coatpicking and bending to leave? So it's a sign of ""Now we're leaving this table which had promised so much--this is our obsequy to the sad."" The glumness goes as soon as someone says something and they head for the door--laughing they fling back echoes to the scene of their human disaster--they go off down the street in the new air provided by the world. Ah the mad hearts of us all."

All the while he's recording this, writing his Big Sur, not forgoing any detail, no matter how stupid or weak or jerkish he might seem through it all.

The style and philosophy are very beat, though his writing is associated with the beat culture I don't know to what degree he participated in it. Tropic of Cancer is very much a Narrative, in fact it is almost exclusively narrative, and his pros are phenomenal. Stream of consciousness stuff, and very autobiographical. That is why I make the comparison with Kerouac. He even mentions not correcting his work, which Kerouac spoke of as well. Most of it is about him running around Paris broke and starving and lusting after women, mostly prostitutes, while he writes and consorts with other writers. Very good stuff, and I would rank it among the best of that generation"

books,3dgh5o,thesoxpride11,3,Thu Jul 16 02:26:34 2015 UTC,"Accelerated Reader has a pretty large database of books with their reading level. They have two ways of measuring it, IL and BL. BL centers on the difficulty of the text while IL matches the content of the book to a corresponding grade.     What is Interest Level (IL)?  Interest level is based on a book's content including theme, characterization, and plot. The interest level attached to the book indicates age group appropriateness. Interest level designations reflect the judgment of the book's publisher and the professionals at Renaissance Learning. We group content appropriateness into these categories: LG = Lower Grades (K-3); MG = Middle Grades (4-8); MG+ = Upper Middle Grades (6 and up); and UG = Upper Grades (9-12). Most MG+ books are marketed as YA (Young Adult) for Interest Level. However, the final decision as to whether the content of a specific book is appropriate for a particular student is the responsibility of school librarians, teachers, and parents.  What is ATOS Book Level (BL)?  ATOS Book Levels are reported using the ATOS readability formula and represent the difficulty of the text. For example, a book level of 4.5 means the text could likely be read independently by a student whose reading skills are at the level of a typical fourth grader during the fifth month of school.

He was at home and from his yard he can look across the freeways and the dried out river bed and see Nixon's burial place.

You can really tell how Delillo will turn out as a writer, it's full of big sweeping cultural damnations, a plot that exists but isn't really central to too much of what he has to say, and just brilliant brilliant prose coupled with a feeling of paranoia and dread.

The march toward death is a lonely one.   If you've ever been around someone who's dying you'll see that all this is true; it takes real character to confront death head on, in yourself or in other people. Tolstoy knew that and he shone a spotlight on those uncomfortable truths."

books,3devgn,golfpinotnut,2,Wed Jul 15 19:29:39 2015 UTC,"Have you read it?   Also, it did actually get past a first reading at a publisher. It couldn't have become TKAM if it hadn't. I suspect the reason why it wasn't published and why it didn't get more publisher attention at the time was because a lot of the stuff it had to say was highly taboo."
books,3devgn,golfpinotnut,5,Wed Jul 15 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"I have read it.  I finished it this morning.  I enjoyed it a great deal, but I completely disagree that this book surpasses what TKAM gave us.  You have a right to your opinion, of course, but it is difficult for me to believe that anyone who has read both books would put Go Set A Watchman ahead of To Kill a Mockingbird.  And we're arguing semantics, of course, but you can't really call this book a first draft of TKAM.  Even the central feature of TKAM, the trial of Tom Robinson, had a different result."
books,3devgn,golfpinotnut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's a different book, but this was the manuscript that attracted the editor who convinced Lee to expand the flashbacks from Scout's childhood into TKAM. IMO GSAW is not exactly a first draft or a sequel, but something in between.  What did you like better about TKAM?"
books,3devgn,StudentofDuckworth,4,Wed Jul 15 19:57:06 2015 UTC,What did you like better about TKAM?   The writing.  The story.  The perspective of the narration.  The idealism.
books,3devgn,Mariner11663,3,Wed Jul 15 20:14:09 2015 UTC,"The idealism is the worst part of TKAM. It allows people to believe that we don't have to engage in difficult political struggle; we just have to be decent people in our daily lives. TKAM is a little more nuanced since Atticus actually loses the case, but a lot of people treat that as if it's incidental to Atticus's heroism. GSAW, on the other hand, shows how standing up against racism even in daily life is not just a matter of being nice to everyone. Jean Louise being nice couldn't fix the way Calpurnia and her family had been treated while she was in New York. Confronting racism means conflict with the racist relatives and friends whose racism you're confronting. It's a lot more real and adult.  The plot of TKAM is definitely better, but for me that's not a central concern. The inconsistent narration is poor writing, although I didn't find it to be as distracting as other people did. A proper editing I think would have resulted in first-person narration throughout. But the general structure of the novel, the characters, the message, etc. - all that I think is fundamentally strong. And I still do think there are some seriously beautiful passages in GSAW, though."
books,3devgn,Joelog,2,Fri Jul 17 17:27:33 2015 UTC,"I just finished it this morning as well and I couldn't disagree with you more. In my opinion, this is the book Harper Lee meant to write. To me, it far more interesting, daring, and thought provoking than TKAM, and I see it as an instant classic. It is a brilliant book, one that affected me more than any other book I've read in the last 10 years."
books,3devgn,StudentofDuckworth,3,Fri Jul 17 16:04:12 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, Go Set a Watchman (like you said) is more daring and realistic in its portrayal of the south and racism.

I became more emotianally attached to GSAW, beacause of the heroic status of Atticus in TKAM. The two books together says something which is bound to happen to us all, detatching from our parents. I think TKAM and GSAW together become world-class literature"
books,3devgn,candle1983,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:45:30 2015 UTC,"This. What a rare trick pulled off here. How often do we as readers want to connect with the characters we are reading about. How astounding that Jean Louise's anguish is OUR OWN! What other book in history allows us to so live in the person's life because her memory of her father and her memory of her town, are our memory of her father and our memory of our town. The struggles she goes through are the exact struggles we experience, on a personal level, as we are reading it.   It, for me, was an incredible, life changing, experience."

books,3dgw47,varunvicky93,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:01:59 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna mix it up a bit and do my top 3 authors of two genres.    Science-Fiction Top 3 Vernor Vinge (hard scifi) The best hard sci-fi I've ever read, and still manages to have excellent character work and plotting. Try A Deepness in the Sky or A Fire Upon the Deep.    Connie Willis (time travel/social sci-fi) Great stories, great range - drama, comedy, suspense, deep shit. Doomsday Book goes back to the middle ages, Blackout/All Clear to WWII, To Say Nothing of the Dog to Victorian times.    Lois McMaster Bujold  (science-fiction) The bulk of her writing is a sci-fi series called the Vorkosigan saga which is really excellent stuff. The series spans the subgenres - military scifi, action/adventure, mystery, social commentary, comedy.    Fantasy Top 3 Steven Erikson (epic fantasy) If you put The Lord of the Rings, Glen Cook's Black Company series, and A Song of Ice and Fire into a blender, you might get something a little like The Malazan Book of the Fallen. It's an ambitious ten volume series, with an absolutely massive cast of characters. It can be daunting, but it's also hugely rewarding and epic.      Neil Gaiman (fantasy) The most versatile author on the list. Mostly got his start in comics, creating the hugely popular The Sandman series. He's done some excellent miniseries and guest writing - Marvel 1602, Eternals, Batman: Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader, et al. In novels he's done religious satire - Good Omens with Terry Pratchett, fairytale - Stardust, urban fantasy - Neverwhere, dark fantasy - American Gods, all ages creepy stuff - Coraline, The Graveyard Book.    Lois McMaster Bujold (kingdom fantasy, romantic fantasy) I think her 'Chalion' fantasy work is some of her strongest - The Curse of Chalion, Paladin of Souls, The Hallowed Hunt. I don't usually pay too much attention to what's won what awards, but there's a reason these were finalist/winners of Hugos and Nebulas and Locus awards. She also did a romantic/rural fantasy series called the Sharing Knife, and a book called The Spirit Ring set in a magical Renaissance Italy."

books,3dgtl3,KennyG23,3,Thu Jul 16 03:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm a book blogger without just being a book blogger. I've run a nerd-centric blog for about three years and for the entirety of that time I've been the primary book and comic book reviewer.   My suggestion is that you first figure out what kind of blogging you want to do. What books are you going to review? Will you review anything or are you genre specific? That's important to decide early on because it will help you in making connections within the community but also in doing one of the single most important things any blogger will do: naming your blog. That's my second recommendation. Come up with a good name for your blog and make sure it's not already taken. It'll need to be memorable, marketable, and preferably short (though that's not always necessary if it's really catchy).  As for formatting that's really something you'll have to figure out for yourself. How you write your reviews will be a big draw certainly. But there is no right or wrong way to do it.  Once you have given it a go a few times around you'll start to figure out how you want to do things. Not everyone uses starred reviews. Not everyone does # out of 10. Some people spoil the shit out of books when reviewing them, etc. You'll figure out your own style as you go along.  The most important thing for you to do right now is write reviews. Write them for books you've read, books you're reading, etc. You need to establish consistency before anything else matters. There are places you can get free books, blog tours you can join, etc. but all of those resources require some show of dedication. Once you can consistently commit to a blog and show that you've done so for three to six months then you can start looking into that sort of thing.  Exceptions to the rule: GoodReads, LibraryThing, and Penguin First Reads. You can get books from them simply as a site user.  Write more than just reviews. Write top ten lists, recommendation lists, etc. Those are the quirky things that bring in readers and the sort of things that get hits from social media. Speaking of which, follow authors and publishers on Twitter and Instagram and such. Use hashtags well. That all helps get your blog out there."
books,3dgtl3,8bitesq,2,Thu Jul 16 23:40:36 2015 UTC,"I started a book blog about a year ago, but have neglected it for the past few months (my laptop broke while I was at university but now that I'm back home hopefully I'll start up again). I used WordPress; it's free and formatting is super easy. I'd say that and Blogger are the two most popular choices.  WordPress allows you to tag your posts and for other people to search posts with those tags. I gained a couple hundred followers in a nice time span there, which allowed me to get free ARCS from other websites to review (always a plus when you love books!). One great way to meet other bloggers and readers is to participate in various tags, such as Top Ten Tuesday, which links different bloggers together to discuss a different bookish theme each week.  I hope your blogging goes well! It really can be awesome!"

Total chaos, with brief glimpses of clarity and cohesive vision.      It is far and away from a true literary classic but, as a fan of his works, I pushed through.      For those familiar with the popular books and not all of his works, this is effectively the creation story for Tolkien's fantasy world.  It starts from nothingness and goes to the creation of the rings of power.   It was created after The Hobbit, but never completed/published until after his death.  The original manuscript was edited by his son, to fill in gaps and blend in/edit out, in reference to his other works.       It doesn't follow the mold of the hero vs. villain that is so often the basis in fantasy.  As such, it got some pretty harsh reviews (though somewhat deserved).  It does provide a unique insight into how Tolkien came up with his stories.  I count it as one of my biggest reading achievements, albeit not high on the list of all-time favorite books."

books,3dfxzy,pithyretort,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:59:31 2015 UTC,"storing a book in an enclosed plastic bag (of any type) means that there is some amount of moisture in that bag, whatever the conditions were when bagged.  outside the bag, temperatures and conditions can change, and if it is colder, then condensation can form. even if now moisture forms, mildew can be encouraged.  books need to breathe.  a microclimate (like a book box) is preferred, but not being hermetically sealed.  long term storage in a sealed bag isn't recommended, especially 'tightly'.  people tend to over-correct when doing what they think is 'protecting' books.  these things tend to do mare more damage than leaving them alone.  EDIT: spelling"
books,3dfxzy,strychnineman,2,Fri Jul 17 14:02:16 2015 UTC,"I meant plastic containers like tubs, bins, etc, not bags.    If OP is concerned about bed bugs, books probably aren't the first thing that would be at risk anyway (unless they store their books near the head of their bed) but plastic storage is best at keeping bed bugs out because there are fewer places for them to live.  When I used to work at a job where we helped people with bed bug infestations, even switching to those plastic drawers as a temporary replacement for wooden dressers was helpful but most people had trouble with bedding, clothing, and furniture as opposed to books.  I guess metal is as good at plastic in that regard, so OP could just move all their possessions into a filing cabinets to have the same protection from bed bugs without being airtight, but that seemed less practical than plastic tubs. Again, though, I never saw someone with bed bugs in their books so even just moving any bookshelves away from beds might be sufficient if OP is concerned about finding a balance between storage that is tight enough to not let bugs in that would also let air out.  I don't buy plastic bags often, but it's hard for me to imaging Ziplock makes plastic bags big enough to be a practical storage option for a collection of books.

books,3desxh,Storme0x,4,Wed Jul 15 18:35:14 2015 UTC,"Books are fantastic but by themselves are not enough to educate you. Education is more than knowledge it is understanding. What I would do is read a variety of books, maybe some historical fiction, maybe some popular series like Harry Potter, and some classics like Pride and Prejudice and Catch 22. Mix it up.   Then while reading books, throw some news in there so that you don't lose track of what's going on in the real world. I like the NPR app because while they are pretty left leaning, they approach issues with facts and explain the logic behind the opinions they state. Other news sources are more likely to state opinions as facts. Al Jazeera is also good to get a look at the rest of the world since NPR focuses on US news.   Oh and for your free electives in your major, take something that sounds interesting but that you know nothing about. I took History of Religion in America and given that I was raised atheist it turned out to be one of the most useful classes in terms of understanding culture and most of my friends backgrounds. Geology is also a good one, or anthropology. It's your chance to learn anything that you want to know."
books,3desxh,k_alva,2,Wed Jul 15 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"First you need to decide what exactly you want to learn about. Maybe you already know this in your head but ""becoming informed about my surroundings"" is not a particularly descriptive way of outlining a goal with text. One of the collateral benefits of reading anything, however, is that you will learn to speak and write more articulately, and then maybe by asking more pointed questions you will get better answers.  I recommend you peruse Principles of Modern Chemistry by Daniel Oxtoby if you mean you want to learn more about the physical world. Its a massive tome that I had for a college chemistry class, but it will go into minute detail for pretty much every physical phenomenon you can think of. Guns, Germs, and Steel gives a great outline of pretty much all of human history and prehistory if you want to learn about history (also a daunting read, though). Otherwise, biographies of people in interesting fields will often give you some insight into that field, as well as pertinent historical references. Turing's Cathedral by George Dyson is a really interesting biography/history about the invention of the computer. I'm also in CS and it really made me wonder why we still use almost exclusively Von Neumann computer architecture in our modern computers. This architecture was thought of in the 50's and we haven't really gotten away from it since. Computers can likely do much, much more than they are doing currently if we developed more sophisticated data processing systems.  But beware. If you aren't interested in non-fiction it can be hard to get through. I would start with fiction, as it is an indispensable way to learn about the human experience. In this case becoming ""informed about your surroundings"" could mean anything from taking social cues in pre-Bolshevik Russia to learning the peculiar eating habits of hobbits. You could start with poetry if you just want a short, thought-provoking read to get started. I'm a big fan of Czeslaw Milosz and Walt Whitman. Or you could start with an easy novel. The Alchemist by Paulo Coehlo is a good starter and should inspire you to keep learning. Work your way to harder and harder authors. Maybe go to Stephen King, JRR Tolkien, Isaac Asimov, Michael Crichton for more fun sci-fi/fantasy reads. Work up to the literary heavy weights over time. Jane Austen, Steinbeck, Dostoevsky, and Ken Kesey are some of my favorites, but if you aren't ready for Austen you will quickly lose interest. A good, beginner literary work might be Fathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev.  Hopefully that helps. The main thing is that you read every day. If you do this, you will become smarter without even trying.  PS: If you're American, every American should read Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird. Its a great blend of historical fiction/bildingsroman and anyone that has missed out on this read is missing out on life."

Kindle Paperwhite is very popular, while I personally prefer Kobo's offerings. A Kindle Fire is a non-e-ink tablet which, while it can be used for reading, is an inferior choice to a dedicated ereader.  Generally I recommend that anyone who reads frequently should get an ereader. They're very much worth the expense."

I save on average only 2-5 dollars on each book, meaning I need to read anywhere between 20 and 50 books just to see any savings, and it would be even more if it weren't on sale when I bought it. On the other hand it's a huge plus that I only have to bring an ereader with me when I travel in stead of taking a bunch of space in my suitcase for books."

The biggest pro to my mind is the ability to press your finger on a word and it instantly brings up either a dictionary definition or the Wikipedia page for the term.

Very often in the Hobbit I would be knocked out of the book by the narrative. Like you said the voice is too omniscient. I don't remember the specific passage but more than once in the Hobbit Tolkien compares things like Smaug's voice to that of a rumbling truck engine. Things like that. You are aware that you're reading a book written by someone in our world. You aren't reading a memoir from a hobbit. LoTR sticks completely to it's world from start to finish and you can tell he grew as an author.    holy moly The Hobbit is fantastic!   I completely agree."

He invested such a huge chunk of his life in the creation of this universe, and I guess it threw me a little to think that someone who was otherwise so thorough (hello, Appendix A-F?H? at the end of LotR!) had no history there for the character beforehand.   I know what you mean about the the narrator being from our world, honestly I let it go because of the fact he was writing for children, and it didn't really bother me all that much (it did kind of add to the humour in places). I didn't take it as Bilbo's memoir, it's just that at the end he mentions he wrote one, so I guess that could lead to speculation. Thanks for the reply!"

That being said, your post was the first to even give me a hint as to why someone might remove a dust jacket (I love them)."

I don't ever cram them into bags, fold corners, curl the cover back, or break the spine too wide.  I just boringly read them in bed or on the floor and then set them carefully back on the shelf (I've worked in several bookstores, so maybe that's why my default is ""Don't hurt the book!"").  It just never occurred to me that someone might casually throw away part of someone else's property, or treat it badly enough to damage it.  Probably in the same way he never thought someone would mind if he read a book in a way that was comfortable to him."

Even people who don't like dust jackets would probably remove them before reading your book and putting it somewhere safe before doing so.  Throwing it out is a definite red flag towards someone who doesn't respect other people's things.  For me, if I buy a hardcover, I'll read it and put it away, and then when the softcover is released I'll buy that so I can keep it on me.  I like to bring my books around on the train or if I'm leaving my home for the day.  If I ever find myself bored or waiting on something I'll just pull it out and read."

After this, you really can't mess up the original jacket.  I always loved library books for this reason, but it never occurred to me I could simply add their ""service"" myself, whenever and however I wanted. Since reading a hardback is much more pleasurable to me, since it's larger and has wider margins than a paperback, and often has better cover art, adding my own ""library""-style protective cover is the finishing touch.  Do this, and your collection is protected; your books look and feel awesome; you aren't worried about staining or dampening your jacket just by handling it; and you've sort of put your own stamp on them. I feel sure that doing this is much preferable to what so many people here have been doing out of practicality and a certain aversion to bookjackets: just removing them. You can even tape down the jacket at the flaps, and the whole thing won't even slide around.  Humbly, I propose that this is the secret to loving hardback books."

It's not bigger than any other book, it has a ribbon bookmark and it's blocked and printed. Of course the binding is ""only"" that textured vaux-buckram, but it sure beats a paperback or something with a dust jacket on. It also wasn't that expensive either. I hope they'll release the rest of the Discworld novels in that edition.   But yeah, bottom line: You are certainly not alone.

Hence, the cover should be discrete, not too colorful etc.  A dust jacket allows for this screaming-silent duality by being removable after buying, that's a beautiful solution!"

The writing style is entertaining, but awkward and unclear at several points and the concluding quarter of the book contains a couple of (in my opinion) fairly monotonous chapters. Basically, exactly how you would expect a 'first book' to be.  I would say TKAM is a more entertaining read, but Go Set a Watchman is more challenging in that it focuses on the grey, more so than black or white, if you understand what I mean.  I'd definitely say it is worth the read. It certainly hasn't changed my view on TKAM, because there is a certain disconnect between the two worlds helped by the fact there is a fairly big time gap between the two stories; although they certainly are the same characters, if I were to reread TKAM now, it wouldn't alter my opinion of them."

She dreaded reading assigned books back when we were in high school, especially the classics.  One time, we got into the topic of the Harry Potter book series.  Being one of my most favourite series, I completely went off on a tangent and just kept talking about how different of an experience it is reading the books compared to just watching the movies.  I guess that hit something in her because a few weeks later she said she read a book for the purposes of entertainment for the first time in her life.  I was so incredibly happy for her and now we frequent book stores together.  I think, in her case, it definitely had a lot to do with the book genre.
