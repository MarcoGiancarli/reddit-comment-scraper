cleanjokes,2y7kh0,EuphemismTreadmill,3,Sat Mar 7 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"Nice joke. But what if the Vulcan really didn't know if he wanted a drink. You can have three states: yes but don't know about others, don't know and don't know about others, no."
cleanjokes,2y7kh0,gauderio,4,Sat Mar 7 21:41:31 2015 UTC,But if the first one didn't want a drink then his answer would have been no as there would be no way for them 'all' to want a drink.
cleanjokes,2y7kh0,WolfianDecadence,2,Sat Mar 7 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"But what if the first one didn't know if he wanted a drink or not? What's the difference between ""I don't know (if the others want a drink)"" with ""I don't know (if I want a drink)""?"
cleanjokes,2y7kh0,gauderio,2,Sun Mar 8 00:34:03 2015 UTC,"Good point. Arguably we could take ""not knowing"" as ""not yes"" and therefore the equivalent of ""no."" Of course the keyword is arguably."
