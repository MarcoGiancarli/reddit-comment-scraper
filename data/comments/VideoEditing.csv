VideoEditing,3e3xrx,Namisaur,3,Wed Jul 22 02:06:40 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised no one has a dedicated hdd or ssd for cache and preview files. I'm doing OS/software on one ssd, cache / preview / misc docs on another , and video files / source footage on a couple big hdds with a couple extra int and ext for backups. Even with a blazing fast computer, read / write times will be limited by your storage system. Changing my disk setup alone has increased rendering times."
VideoEditing,3e3xrx,vaipandotcom,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:10:27 2015 UTC,yep. bought a 6G 60GB SSD on impulse and that's just where programs keep all that info. Figured out that photoshop had a video cache to it the other day purging that opened up load of space.
VideoEditing,3e3xrx,wellitsbouttime,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:11:06 2015 UTC,This. Clearing this directory manually or purging/clearing caches in-game can make massive gains in hard drive space.

VideoEditing,3e676s,ejayshun,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:02:12 2015 UTC,"try turning the preview quality down, to something like half or draft. what type of footage are you using? is it h.264? that's really intensive to decode on the fly and even with the best cpu and storage you still can't expect perfect playback. is it effects heavy? if your computer is having to process effects as well as decode heavily compressed footage then that will mess with your playback. what sort of drive are you using? ssd? mechanical? 5400 or 7200 rpm? or external? the speed of your drive can affect your playback performance. etc etc etc."
VideoEditing,3e6ja2,Vaehatiel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:53:01 2015 UTC,"It looks fine to me. By default the video quality was set to 360p, but you can change it to 1080p60HD."

VideoEditing,3e57cs,NOOfx,2,Wed Jul 22 01:23:28 2015 UTC,"Well that depends on if the files are split seamlessly, or if some frames get dropped when it switches from one file to the next.  If it buffers the new file with a few duplicate frames from the last, then all you would need to do is find out where it overlaps and chop it off there.  If it drops frames between one and the next, I don't known what can be done since those files were presumably not recorded."
VideoEditing,3e57cs,MacintoshEddie,2,Wed Jul 22 01:28:37 2015 UTC,"Well I've just discovered that the clips actually lose some frames at the beginning after importing them into Premiere. Outside of Premiere, with all the frames there, they seem like they could possibly line up with eachother..."
VideoEditing,3e57cs,MacintoshEddie,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:28:32 2015 UTC,Hmm.  I'm not a premier expert by any means so I have no real suggestions there other than try to re-import it a few times and see if magic happens.
VideoEditing,3e57cs,greenysmac,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:40:08 2015 UTC,"I've never seen the HDRCX160....  But if these are spanned clips, you might try the Media Browser for import. It understands professional cameras (such as P2, XDCam or RED) and may correctly combine these clips for you."

VideoEditing,3e36ah,Somentus,2,Tue Jul 21 16:34:41 2015 UTC,"Project Files do not contain video data. What you had done was make sequences or subclips (does Vegas do subclips?) which all reference the original media.  You can try exporting the relevant sections, but by recompressing your media you will lose quality unless you go to a high-quality mezzanine/intermediate codec like DNxHD. You can try doing pass-through in a tool like ffmpeg, but that will require knowing where I-frames are and whatnot if you want to make sure you don't screw anything up."

VideoEditing,3e22pa,Spyron10,3,Tue Jul 21 10:38:09 2015 UTC,"You can easily do it in After FX, scale your text with keyframes in order to match the zoom in/outs. There are many tutorials on youtube on how to do it!"
VideoEditing,3e22pa,Alovens,2,Tue Jul 21 10:45:55 2015 UTC,thanks! is there a name for this effect?
VideoEditing,3e22pa,LocalMexican,5,Tue Jul 21 10:46:42 2015 UTC,Tracking.  You need to create the animated text first. Track the motion in your clip and apply the tracking data to your animated text layer.
VideoEditing,3e22pa,Alovens,4,Tue Jul 21 14:09:47 2015 UTC,"Not really, but another way ( and I think it's the way they did it) is to make a camera setup within After FX and track the 3D text to give it a more realistic zoom out feeling.  Edit : Videocopilot offers great tutorials for that stuff, you might want to check it out!"
VideoEditing,3e22pa,gingerstick,-3,Tue Jul 21 10:50:16 2015 UTC,You could probably find something similar on fiverr.com for $5
VideoEditing,3e2l7e,mike_mol,2,Tue Jul 21 13:55:38 2015 UTC,Try clicking the composition mode button (the one with 2 green squares next to the level slider) on the track and selecting screen. If I'm not mistaken this should get rid of the black part of the video and allow you to put a clip under it.
VideoEditing,3e2l7e,Kapheon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:44 2015 UTC,ps. don't mind the (media offline) on the black clip
VideoEditing,3e2l7e,MarkDG,3,Tue Jul 21 13:56:32 2015 UTC,Use chroma key and make the color black instead of green. This should work.

VideoEditing,3e19br,Senescere,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:04 2015 UTC,The brightness/contrast changing is due to the gamma shift.  To prevent that I usually export lossless and encode with x264 in Sorenson Squeeze.
VideoEditing,3e19br,Alovens,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:26:49 2015 UTC,"Different players interpret H.264's gamma curve different ways, and there's very little you can do about what's going to happen down the line. It might look OK on your computer, but someone else's settings might be screwed up. Your best bet is to view your video on as many different devices and players as possible and color grade it so it looks as good as possible on as many screens as possible.  Oh, and FYI: don't capture at 30.00 if you're going to export at 29.97, that can create weird frame rate conversion issues. It's recommended you use one frame rate across the board, and 29.97 will be the most compatible."
VideoEditing,3e2cpb,X1Cygnus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:36:05 2015 UTC,"I'd love to help, got a couple of questions:  -Are you exporting a video to your computer and then simply burning that file onto the CD, or are you using these freeware programs to both edit the video and burn the disc and turn the CD into something with menus etc?  -Have you tried reburning the disc at a lower write speed?"
VideoEditing,3e2cpb,1slander,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for offering assistance!  The videos are all complete and have even posted to YouTube previously.  The DVD I am attempting to make is for a friend in another state who has no internet access.  I keep an archive of all my video work, so I am using the same copies that I tucked away after they were exported from Adobe Premiere Pro.  I am not doing any additional editing to the video files at this time.  I am bringing them into the DVD creation software and setting up a menu so that they are available to be selected and played individually, or as one long play list.  I have set the ""priority"" to ""Above Normal"" and I believe I'm burning at 4x, but will check for a lower write speed setting."
VideoEditing,3e2cpb,1slander,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:14 2015 UTC,"An alternative method might be to burn the video files onto the DvD without using the menu making software. This way the DvD player will just see that the DvD has on it X amount of video files and will play them, each one being a ""chapter"" if you were to skip them on your remote. I hope that makes sense."

VideoEditing,3e1kr5,greenysmac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:17 2015 UTC,yeah but I will to retain full rights of the video production and not have people directed elsewhere when the click upon the vid...  Any providers you recommend?
VideoEditing,3e1kr5,1slander,2,Tue Jul 21 12:09:07 2015 UTC,"Say you have a website and you pay for hosting space. If you include a video in your website, and it is locally sourced within your website and formatted correctly so it has a video player, then visitors to your website will not be redirected. However, this will eat your hosting space as videos tend to be big in size (the higher the quality, the more data it will hold, and will be a bigger file).  edit: my website is hosted by www.m247.com, they have a great customer service dept. and I've had no issues with their usability."
VideoEditing,3e1kr5,Kichigai,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:04 2015 UTC,"SmugMug is known for having terms of service that are extremely respectful of people's ownership and rights restrictions, unlike Youtube and Vimeo. It's primary purpose is as a photo sharing site, but I'm pretty sure it also had a video feature, but it may be a premium option.  If you want to host it, that's fine, but keep in mind what kind of bandwidth restrictions you're going to have to deal with. For example, I have unlimited storage and unlimited traffic with my hosting provider, Dreamhost (if you want to help me out, here's a referral link), but the bandwidth they provide me isn't enough to stream HD video very well. SD video does well enough, most of the time.  The other big issue is that it makes playing with bandwidth adaptive streaming much more difficult. You know that trick where instead of buffering Netflix will downgrade video quality if you're connection is congested? That's the kind of thing I'm talking about. It requires a lot more work to make happen on your own."
