flexibility,3dvo2k,Beignet,2,Mon Jul 20 05:01:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, it means you are stretching your ligaments in the knees instead of the inner thighs. Strengthening the inner thighs may help, because weak muscles tend to tighten up and stretching then won't work well. Work on strengthening the glutes and hip rotators, as they are the opposing muscle groups for the inner thighs, and strength and stability in the hips may help convince them that it's okay to release and open up. Also find other stretches which target the inner thigh but easier on the knee (half frog works for me for example).  Avoid pushing that stretch if you feel that concentrated pain on the insides of your knees. You might overstretch the ligaments and de-stabilize the knee joint. Trust me, not fun at all."

flexibility,3dwq3u,ThomClaire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:11:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if there's concrete research on this, there might be, but it's a consensus that the pain we feel in our muscles when we nearing the end of range of motion is our nervous system kicking in to prevent our limbs to go into places where the body doesn't have good control of them (ie strength).   That means that the strength that helps flexibility is strength present in on the extremes of your range of motion, not strength in the regular range. You can have bitchin' strong quads and yet they would be too tight for you to touch heel to butt, and it's not a contradiction to the above.    That said, you can gain flexibility without doing strengthening exercises. It work better in a younger age, but it's not impossible. So it's not the One True Way, just one of many to sooth, trick or bypass  the nervous system and let us go deeper."
flexibility,3dwq3u,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:01 2015 UTC,"To make something more mobile you have to add stability elsewhere.  Like Clockwork said, stronger doesn't necessarily mean more flexible (often times the stronger a muscle group is the less flexible it is because it get contracted longer and more often... think of giant body builders who move pretty stiffly). The question you need to ask is ""Why are my hamstrings so tight?""  It's less likely because of weakness and more likely about the position they are held and trained in.  I'm sure there are plenty of people sick of me mentioning this here, but hamstring mobility is directly tied to the pelvis.  If your pelvis is stuck in anterior tilt, the hamstrings are stuck in a long, contracted position.  Control the pelvis the hammies to be able relax and 'be shortened.'    Core strength and stability is also huge because something has to hold you up while something else is moving.  Your legs can't be stable and mobile at the same time.  It's rarely the case that stretching something tight solves the problem.  Find the cause to the tightness... the answer lies there."
flexibility,3dwq3u,ruffolous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:26:10 2015 UTC,"Will you elaborate on the relationship between the hamstrings and pelvis? I know that if I try to do a sitting pike my hip flexors tighten up so much it's more of a cramp, and I just have to get out of it right away. So, maybe that's my issue? Although I would think that that has nothing to do with the weird (bad) feeling behind my knees when trying to stretch in a pike?"
flexibility,3dwq3u,ruffolous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:05:35 2015 UTC,"Sure.  The hamstrings are attached to the bottom of the pelvis.  If your pelvis lives in anterior tilt, the bottom of the pelvis is tilted towards your head, keeping the hamstrings 'lengthened'.  They reside in a stretched position, making further efforts to stretch them quite uncomfortable.  When the pelvis tilts posteriorly, the bottom of your pelvis (think tailbone) tilts forward, towards your belly button, shortening the distance of the hamstring attachment, and alleviating tension.  The anterior tilt also affects your hip flexors.  The top of the pelvis is tilted downward, towards your knees.  Typically it's the super strong, really thick hip flexors that PULL the top of your pelvis downward and keep it there.  The body likes easy, so it lets these big guys do as much as possible, and the lower, deep abdominals tag along for the ride.  The hip flexors get stronger and the abs get weaker, further exacerbating the issue, as it's the lower abs that pull the body into posterior tilt.    When you sit, you're using the the strong hip flexors to hold you up because they're stronger then the abs.  Then you fold over, and they try to do that too.  (Which is easier, two thick ropes to perform flexion -- the hip flexors -- or a piece of paper -- the abdominals?  Again, the body will always go with the easiest method unless reprogrammed or repositioned).  The result is cramping because you're asking the flexors to do too much.  Reset the pelvis and press your legs down into the ground so the abs can do the work of holding you up (you should feel them 'turn on') and the hips can be released into flexion.  There's a good visual and further highlights between the flexors and posterior chain here: http://www.postcompetitiveinsight.com/2014/07/the-pelvis.html"

flexibility,3d8s1a,ReverendBizarre,9,Tue Jul 14 11:47:03 2015 UTC,"Emmet started helping me with my flexibility earlier this year. My first goal was to hit my head to my toe.  I started off somewhat flexible and had a nice full pike. My first session consisted of getting my elbow to my toe.  In just a few days, I had already gotten much closer to my toes.  ~15 days after starting, I hit my forehead to my toe. Not a week later, I started sniffing my toes.  I am currently working on getting my head to my toe while standing and here are some pictures from that progress:  An attempt of pulling my leg off the stall bars and to my head while standing and the other side.  My yoga forward bends got a lot better  And now I'm getting increasingly closer to touching my toes to my head while standing  All in all, this method has done absolute wonders for me. I was flexible when I started using it, but my pike had stagnated and I had not felt progress (I honestly thought I had hit my max) for something like 6 months."
flexibility,3d8s1a,Antranik,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:56:15 2015 UTC,"Nice work. Here's my log (continued in comments as well) from when I started doing it 4 months ago as well.  I made more gains in my forward fold than I have had in a very long time in just the 3 weeks or something that I stuck to it.  I had stopped cause my knee felt funny at one point and I stopped it completely, to ensure I don't hurt myself (cause FUCK INJURY). Coincidentally, I did a couple hundred reps yesterday during my dog walk and I'm really inspired to continue now that this video is out!"

flexibility,3d8s1a,benjimann91,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:57:48 2015 UTC,probably cause they're to be done with a straight leg
flexibility,3d8s1a,Antranik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:14:49 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't phrase that properly. I wasn't trying to sound skeptical, I'm genuinely curious if this will help with terminal knee extension, or just calf flexibility. Is calf flexibility even related to terminal knee extension?  When I sit in dandasana the backs of my knees are a good inch away from the floor, even though I have pretty good hamstring/pike flexibility (palms to floor). I considered giving this question its own post, but I figured you'd be someone who might know about this sort of thing."
flexibility,3d8s1a,benjimann91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:10:49 2015 UTC,"Yea, of course they are related! :D"
flexibility,3d8s1a,Antranik,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:24:59 2015 UTC,"What then, helps with terminal elbow extension? Tight biceps? or could there be another culprit.   I've seen the stretch where you basically lay prone with your elbows straight underneath you, and I wasn't sure if there was an equivalent of that stretch for the knee joint."
flexibility,3d8s1a,benjimann91,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:29:44 2015 UTC,You want more elbow extension?  And Not sure why you want more knee extension... That's not a typical goal... If you can't straighten them Tight hamstrings/calves would be the thing to stretch.
flexibility,3d8s1a,Blashyyrkh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, both my elbows and knees aren't anywhere close to full extension - only about 160-170 degrees each limb.  So when I'm hanging out in dandasana or a seated one-leg-out hamstring stretch, my foot starts to go numb because so much pressure/weight is on the heel (calcaneus) because the calf and back of the knee can't touch the floor. Hope that makes sense.  Again, my hamstring flexibility is decent, so I'll give straight leg calf stretching a little while longer and see if I progress. Thanks for your replies."
flexibility,3d8s1a,ClockworkMagpie,2,Fri Jul 17 18:36:29 2015 UTC,"Ok what the hell is this sorcery. Why does this work so well? I've been at it for a mere six days, and already crushed my hamstring flexibility plateau. My front splits always felt like they were limited by the hammies, but just now I got much further than ever before.  For those interested, I haven't been kind to myself and followed Emmet's program daily plus some additional reps throughout the day, whenever I had a minute alone in the office. Grueling, yet effective. Also, Kit's roll stretch, which felt nice, but no idea whether it actually contributed.  A thousand thanks to Antranik and Emmet for your amazing work on this subreddit!"

flexibility,3dats7,MyKoalas,2,Tue Jul 14 21:00:02 2015 UTC,"Do you mean you round it down if you bend forward or sit up straight?  Except for the very flexible out there, most people resort to rounding down when they fold forward in the butterfly, because otherwise it's hard to relax. Straight back forward folding in butterfly is a very deep hip opener, takes time to develop. So if you need to round down to relax in that position, then so be it. Just remember to do the straight back version as well.  If you round your back instead of sitting up straight, then you basically have the same inflexibility issue as above, just somewhat more acute. Try to lean back, supporting your torso by your hands behind you and find that maximal angle where you can straighten your back.   Try to work on sitting up straight in a straddle and pike as well. Work on sticking out your bum and leaning forward without rounding the back. Pulse back and forth from tucking the tailbone and sticking the butt out to loosen the hips."
flexibility,3dats7,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"I stopped doing that stretch when I injured myself doing what you're describing. I actually did it twice.  I was leaning in trying to hold my face near my feet and something popped in my back causing a jolt up through me spine. Scared the shit out of me, I got all flushed euphoric and I wondered for a second or two if I was really hurt... Tweaked it pretty good and took a while to heal."
flexibility,3dats7,Telluride12,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:55:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you want to stretch. If you want to gain flexibility in the thigh muscles, then you need to stretch the thigh muscles and not the upper back, makes sense right :) The degree of flexibility is measured by the angle between the spine and the legs, not the number of inches between the head and the feet.  But many people can't keep their back straight just sitting up straight in butterfly, so you're not alone. You can approach several different ways.   One is to have feet farther away from hips, more of a diamond shape (I think that's what you're trying to say you do already). You can lean back on your hands too, preferably with fingers facing forwards, keeping the chest broad and lengthening the torso away from the hips. As your legs relax, you can waggle your knees up and down (not like a butterfly but one at a time), and then maybe scoot your butt closer to your feet as is comfortable.  You can sit on a block or blanket, however much height it takes to straighten your lower back.  You can sit with your back against a wall, and your feet as far away as necessary to avoid any pain. Props under your knees at the height they can reach will help allow your muscles to relax.  You can alternate which muscles to engage in the process. For example, trying to open your knees with your adductor muscles i.e. outer thighs towards the ground; pressing your knees into your hands towards your head; pressing your feet into each other.  With these muscles, usually with gradual consistent stretching you'll see rapid progress in the beginning and then an eventual plateau. But try to avoid shortcuts like rounding the back because this does little to help with flexibility in the muscles that need stretching the most :)"

flexibility,3d9t66,wanderer779,2,Tue Jul 14 16:51:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure if you include them in your sun salutation, but Westerners can usually use focused hip flexor attention, so some lunge variation (anjanayesa).    You might consider some hip flexion+external rotation, so some pigeon variation.    Finally I would really encourage 5min of sitting + 'take rest' (savasana) at the end.    Your sequence is more Iyengar-based sequence --- as a consideration, you might place standing postures after sun salutations, seated + belly poses in the middle, then end with inversions (head+shoulderstand)."

flexibility,3d9t66,fr_eyes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:50:50 2015 UTC,That's interesting. And makes me wonder if seiza is better for prolonged sitting than actual sitting.
flexibility,3d9t66,ClockworkMagpie,2,Wed Jul 15 19:06:09 2015 UTC,Less/no squatting and/or seiza position means I anticipate less hip mobility.

If you're looking for something to aid with that think about using a foam roller but nothing is going to work like stretching it more.

flexibility,3ctdnk,creamsoda1991,22,Fri Jul 10 16:53:02 2015 UTC,"it isn't just your hamstrings or your back.  the muscle-tendon mechanism starts in your feet, goes up through the backs of your calves and your thighs, through your glutes, up through your back, into your rear neck muscles, then over the top of the head and connects to the bones where your eyebrows stick out.  it is ALL connected, which is why you can have pain in one place, and it will give you an additional pain in another place...such as a headache.  2 suggestions:  1)  stand a few inches away from a solid wall...one that will take your weight, because you're going to lean your bum into the wall and bend over.  DROP YOUR HEAD, too.  count to 30 or 40, but most importantly, BREATHE until your breathing evens out...and let your body drop a teensy bit each time you EXHALE.  don't bounce, unless you want to pop something and spend 10 weeks in various levels of pain.  bend the knees, then hands on knees, tuck the butt under, and slowly come up using your gut, thighs, glutes, hamstrings...NEVER the back.  pretend your back is made of glass.  take some breaths until breathing is stabilized.  now, do the same thing, but rather than hanging down in the center, hang down and rest your hands on your right leg at the thigh, shin, ankle or heel...whichever you can do.  count to 30 or 40 again, and try to stabilize your breathing until it's even.  let the torso move back to the center and bend the knees, hands on knees, butt under, slowly rise, using gut, thighs, hamstrings and glutes.  repeat this for the left leg...and come back up.  REPEAT all three bends, center, right, left...so you've done everything twice.  do this twice a day every day for one week, and i GUARANTEE you will see a difference.  END OF EXERCISE ONE.  2)  sit on a hard chair...kind of on the edge...on your sitz bones.  GENTLY lift one leg and place the ankle on top of the opposite knee...like you're being rude in the subway.  count 30-40, stabilize breathing...then HELP YOUR LEG BACK DOWN.  don't be cocky about bring the leg back down, because you've just insulted your knee joint and your hip joint.  this one should KILL you in the hip and glute of the leg you've lifted up onto the opposite knee.  now, gently lift the other leg up and place the ankle on top of the opposite knee.  blah, blah, count 30-40...breathe stabilization, gently help the leg back down.  DO THE WHOLE THING AGAIN...both sides.  END OF EXERCISE TWO.  i teach yoga to a bunch of old-timers like me at my PF, and one of the guys is a stroke victim in his 40s.  one is skinny 57-year-old male.  one has bad right hip and right knee.  one is 66-year-old woman with poor flexibility and circulation problems in her legs (where the calves get all swollen and have those red dots on them).  they are ALL benefiting from doing the things i've just described here...and the stroke victim just touched his toes after 4 weeks of our little class, monday thru friday.  this CAN and WILL work for you, if you are religious about doing these stretches every single day.  if you want more stretches to stretch out feet, thighs, spine, etc., PM me or something, and i'll give you more stretches that will cause you short-term pain, but long-term flexibility!  :)"

flexibility,3ctdnk,ClockworkMagpie,3,Sat Jul 11 07:40:22 2015 UTC,"It's your hamstrings. You should not stretch your lower back in hamstring stretches, your hamstrings need to do all the work and your back should remain straight and unstained. It is very common to feel it in your back and needing to lean back when your hamstrings are very tight.   Are you sure you hinge in the hips? Do you fold forward with your back totally straight? Even if you don't go really far, it's better to lean forward with straight back, sticking out your butt then round the back and put pressure on it. But in any way, just keep stretching the hamstrings and it will get better over time."
flexibility,3ctdnk,ClockworkMagpie,2,Fri Jul 10 17:22:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I've been told to do but I thought I had to do deal with my back. I basically just feel like I need to bend my back to touch my feet which is annoying. I will keep practicing, thanks."
flexibility,3ctdnk,Tesla_2,2,Fri Jul 10 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"Nope, that's just your body trying to let you touch your toes despite your hamstrings not being flexible enough. Since the goal is not to touch the toes but actually to stretch the hamstrings, you should try to keep the stretch out on the back by not rounding down."
flexibility,3ctdnk,ClockworkMagpie,3,Fri Jul 10 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"Not to hijack the thread here, but is there a good way to stretch hamstrings with back problems? Doing my best to keep my back flat, I can hinge forward about 20-25 degrees before hitting 'this doesn't feel healthy' levels of pain. I've tried laying flat and having my SO raise my legs but even trying to keep my hips against the floor it doesn't seem to work the hamstrings the same way."
flexibility,3ctdnk,darkgraycanary,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:52:47 2015 UTC,"How about single leg stretches? The ones where you bend towards one leg only, and not both at the same time. Did you try any? I feel like these are easier on the back."

However, here are some things that has helped me out.  Heating pad (on the floor on my back) for about 30 minutes. While I am doing that I do tiny little ""stretches"", like try to bring my knees to my chest SLOWLY, as well as barely lift my bottom off the ground (and i mean as soon as you're off the ground, you go back down). I did 2 reps of 15 of each of those.  Then after I feel a little more warmed up I like to do cat/cow into childs pose. I do that a few times. I also do a bit of cobra pose, but if I feel it in the back I ease up on that.  When I finally got more range in my lower back returned, I would do modified versions bridge pose.

flexibility,3ctdnk,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:48:54 2015 UTC,Sounds like you could have psoas issues; if you have pain in your lower back while try to bend over/ stretch. Just a thought.
flexibility,3ctdnk,fatboy_SRK,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:10:27 2015 UTC,"Psoas is a hip flexor, meaning it is at its shortest when the hip is flexed, which happens when you bring the leg forward. So no metter how tight it is, in a pike it would be the most relaxed and just can't tug on the lower back."

But if your psoas is sprained and you're isometrically contracting it to support your torso while bending over,  couldn't that cause pain...  I had a bad IP sprain and need 12 weeks of PT to help it. And the pain in the pike position was one of the major symptoms.  This was who therapist diagnosed and helped me, she is awesome.   http://embodyphysicaltherapy.com/rachel-krentzman/  FYI, I am no expert. Just sharing my personal experience.

I was just sincerely confused as to why you stated it, but your reply now clears that up.  I totally agree that if your psoas is hurt it might be scared to work during this stretch, which it needs, and it could tug on the lower back.   The issue was that most people don't have that, you can assume their hip flexors are not angry, and give your advice from that perspective.  If you do what want to give it as a probable cause for what OP had, it would have been better if you mentioned the psoas sprain you had in your original post. Without that bit of info, if just sound like hip flexors are part of the stretch and may tug on the lower back. If I didn't know any better, I'd assume it might as well be since it's all complicated.   Also, there probably were other symptoms to the sprain, weren't there? It probably hurts like hell in a lunge or something like that. Asking OP about them would confirm your suspicion and give OP a good reason to go get professional assessment.  I just felt like if I didn't try to clear this up, somebody out there will go out of this thread under the notion that hip flexors can tug in a pike stretch, and we have enough misinformation and confusion as it is. So I'm glad we cleared this up, and I'm happy to come here and learn from your experience."

I had an ergonomic assessment done on my work environment due to tight flexors and lower back pain, and the ergo expert said that the knees should be at 90, feet flat on the floor, shins perpendicular to the floor, hips at 90 and lower back supported and neutral. She said that this is the only position in which the hip flexors are not in constant static tension, and therefore they will stop to tight up.  I call bullshit. How can a person sit without moving an inch for 8 hours, barring small breaks (which she recommended), all 90 degrees in every limb? How can that be any more healthy than fidgeting on the chair, one leg over the other then the other over the first then some other half added sit? Or better yet, how can that be better than a standing desk? You can tell I'm not happy about this.  I thought about sitting more in a butterfly and ankle on thigh positions to at least have decent external rotation and maybe lengthen slightly these tight hip flexors but after your post I doubt it would elevate the hip flexor tightness.

I'm no expert but I've been working on my splits for a few months now and my overall flexibility, it's really improved my ROM. As far as your back, you should relieve that pain first with some stretches and yoga poses. Check out the youtube channel called PsycheTruth, I love their follow along videos, they have yoga instructors, massage therapists, dancers, etc that have workouts and stretches for all levels! I would suggest being consistent with your stretches, I do mine everyday or try to and if I miss a day I don't try to make up for it with hour long split stretches; I just do 20 mins or so after I have worked out or warmed up my muscles. The main issue a lot of people have is tight hips and hamstrings which come from sitting a lot. Toe touches, pigeon pose for the glutes, backbends for your back flexibility, lunges, and so on really open you up! Best of luck :)"

That might, over time, ease the breathing issue, because right now you are straining to sit up straight, which doesn't aid your breathing. The more time you spend with a better posture, the more your body will get accustomed to being in it (breathing, that is).   You can also take up swimming, which does amazing things for lung capacity and back strengthening. Running, yoga or any other activity in which breathing is important might benefit your lungs, and help with your posture. Stretching alone won't fix anything, and you might not even need it at all."

If I practiced the front splits at night and then went to sleep, I will wake up the next morning without the same range. I would have to limber up for at least a few minutes to regain that level of flexibility that I had just last night.  In my experience, I could go 1-2 weeks without stretching before I truly lose my capabilities even after I've warmed up and limbered up, similar to strength-training.   But to answer your question, work on active flexibility as opposed to passive flexibility and that should help solidify your gains. Active flexibility/mobility means that you not only can get into that ROM, but also have strength and control in that range. What is your current routine? And what area(s) are you trying to increase the range of?"
flexibility,3cf6s0,Antranik,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:27:17 2015 UTC,"What is your current routine? And what area(s) are you trying to increase the range of?   Current areas of concern with regards to flexibility are Hip flexors, Quads, and hammies.  With regards to ROM (which is more important to me that flexibility), interior and exterior hip rotation.    Current routine is     Foam Rolling (rumble roller) on IT Band (~1 min each side) Foam Rolling (rumble roller) on quads/hip flexors (from just above knee cap to lower abdomen) (~1 min each side) Knee circles - lie on back, one leg flat, one pulled to chest, then move knee in circular motion, (30 reps clockwise, 30 reps counterclockwise each leg) On stomach quad stretch - Modified such that the foot from the leg not being stretched is flat on the ground. I have a spikey ball under the quad that I am stretching, and rotate my stretched leg toward my other leg. So, if you were to stand in front of me as I do this, you'd see the leg I'm stretching rotate clockwise from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock(ish).   I'll do this for 2-5 minutes each leg depending on how tight/immobile I feel.  This is the best exercise I do - loosens my quads, hip flexors, improves hip rotation and feels like it frees my sacrum. Standing static hip flexor stretch, 1 minute each side - similar to this, except I stand and put my front leg on an elevated surface. I have a bit of an anterior pelvic tilt, and it's easier for me to keep my back in neutral in the standing position. Yoga Band Hamstring stretch - 1 min each side Front Plank - 1 min Side Plank - 1 min (each side) Glute Bridge - 1 min Modified Hollow Hold - 1 min   If I go two days without doing this routine, my lower back tightens up, sacrum becomes nearly immobile, my anterior pelvic tilt increases, and my hip mobility goes to shit. I want to get to the point where I don't have to do this routine 6 days a week to stay flexible/mobile."

I live in a major city, typically walk to the grocery store/other errands, work out, play sports, etc.  A typically 'recovery day' for me includes the above routine, and a 1-2 mile walk. Only a 1-3 days a month am I less active than that.  Of course there are exceptions (had a 9.5 hour flight two days ago), but something like that is unusual.

flexibility,3cb7dg,inamsterdamforaweek,7,Mon Jul 6 15:30:34 2015 UTC,"Don't worry! Static stretching without a warm-up is totally fine and no more dangerous than stretching is in and of itself. The only difference will be that with a warm-up (of e.g. a couple dynamic stretches) your muscles will be much more loose and pliable and you'll reach your max range of motion sooner than by stretching cold muscles. So, yes a warm-up is good but not necessary.  Also, please do yourself a favour and don't take everything Kelly Starrett says at face value. Unfortunately, I find that he's a little bit out of loop with his own profession, especially if it comes to the whole injury-pain-posture complex. I was a bit appalled by his rigid and obviously uninformed ideas about ""proper"" posture in Becoming a Supple Leopard, but I'll spare you my boring ramblings. Rather, if it's of any interest to you, check Anoop's review, which imho, albeit being a bit agitated in tone (he's also often too lazy to edit/proofread his articles), in essence does Starrett's book justice and reflects my stance for the most part. (Well, that is, as much as I even remember. I naively and very regrettably somehow bought into the hype back then, got the book pretty much when it came out for top Euro Dollars (~50€+), found it mostly useless for my own use, apart from ""training my contrarian viewpoints"", and so sold it right away for half-price.)  Now, stretching your hip flexors after every 30 minutes of sitting isn't necessarily bad advice, but like you said yourself it's totally impractical and simply won't ""counteract"" sitting. Apart from being much too simplistic reasoning, since there are many more muscles involved in sitting than just those 3 hip flexors, I find it also questionable if sitting is really that ""bad"". What's actually not that ideal about sitting isn't the exact posture in which you sit, but being in the same static posture for prolonged periods of time, this applies to slouching as well as sitting perfectly straight and everything in between. This will simply fatigue and at some point overwork those postural muscles which have to actively support you in a given posture and this is exactly why Starret's postural advice (e.g. contracting abs and glutes 20% at all times) is short-sighted.   Instead think of ""proper"" posture - there really is not such a thing! - as a fluid one, you can observe this easily next time you stand somewhere in line by watching the other people, notice how they constantly shift their weight and change posture slightly?! Even those who read K-star, because they, of course, can't consciously hold up the constant muscle tension. Reflect this back on sitting posture and you have a simple way to make it less ""strenuous"", just change your sitting posture frequently and try to stand up from time to time. A simple and more practical thing you can easily do after sitting is to clasp your hands and reach overhead as far as possible, this will extend your hips and spine and somewhat ""reset"" from slouching.  By all means, I'm not trying to say that you shouldn't stretch your hip flexors by the way! I, too, do that frequently, sometimes multiple times a day, if I feel like it.  tl;dr I don't know why this got so long. Maybe I still hold a bit of a grudge against the K-star?!?"

flexibility,3c37dc,ilikedessert,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"Like the others already said, left/right imbalances are pretty normal. The common way to even things out is to just stretch the weaker side twice as often.  If it's actual pain you're feeling in your quads (as opposed to regular ""stretching pain"" from going a bit too deep), you might just have (latent) trigger points in your hip flexors. All three - psoas, iliacus and rectus femoris portion of the quads - are likely culprits, since they all refer pain to the front of the thigh.   If that's the case, try a short self-massage right before your front splits or HF stretches, just a couple gentle strokes on each muscle should be enough. Foam rolling your thighs can help too, here as well 3-4 times up and down should be plenty. None of this has to be so intense that it hurts. Generally don't use a foam roller or massage ball for the upper part of your psoas, only hands, by the way, the aorta runs somewhat close to your left psoas and you really do not want to massage anything with a pulse."

However, later when the conditions are right I discover that my flexibility has improved slightly or returned since the deep stretch.  One way I have found to mitigate this stiffness is to do some active stretches.  This helps me in particular when doing frontbends and backbends.  I do reverse crunches (similar to cobras) with my feet under the couch without support from the arms or hands.  This is a great active stretch for the backbend.  I do crunches without help from the arms, I do not touch the legs or the floor with my arms or hands.  This is a great frontbend active stretch.  If you do these active stretching exercises it will help immensely to get past the stiffness and will help strengthen the muscles to protect you from injury.  Sometimes you just need some rest for your body to recuperate.  These stretches are not a cure all but will shorten the time needed between deep stretches dramatically!"

Then I do the passive stretches.  Active stretching trains the muscles to extend further without the need for support.  I find that passive stretching past the range of your active stretches provides a foundation to increase the range of your active stretches.  Active stretching also strengthens the muscles preventing injury while doing passive stretching.

Wouldn't small amounts of stress on the ligaments, tendons and bones stimulate adaptation of those tissues?  I'm pretty sure that is what happens in gymnastics training when doing work with fully locked out limbs develops strength in a locked out position (not talking about competitive gymnasts, who, by the nature of their training volume will likely suffer injuries of various sorts).   One thing does come to mind which supports the idea of not being straight.

Yeah I think there are so many different approaches and theories to how people stretch and gain flexibility, but when I did my ytt, we were taught that ligaments are like elastic bands, and if they are over stretched too much then they will lose their elasticity and thus eventually leave your joints and bones in danger :(   I believe there is also some research done on hyper extending and relying mainly on bones stacking on one another can lead to osteoporosis; but this is certainly over a long amount of time and yes, could be also to do with how much stretching is actually done.  Does that clear things up a bit? I'm not trying to say I'm an expert, that is just what I have learnt.

From what I understand, I don't think ligaments necessarily stretch out so much as they develop micro tears which, if they don't have time to heal and strengthen, can lead to larger tears.   I also think that bones stacking might be more of a problem for the soft tissue if there is repeated impact on a straight limb (like jumping or bouncing on a straight leg) but I don't know if that would contribute to osteoporosis (a weakening of the bones from age, diet or medication).   I hope you don't mind my mentioning contrary viewpoints, this is helping me understand things better :)"

It is also easier to add weight to the stick rather than a band or a towel. This is essential once you get to a certain point.  On top of this, they also fix the hand position so if you are doing dislocates to help with other exercises, doing them with a stick makes sure you are not rotating your arms.

flexibility,3budqt,JVorhees,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:30:54 2015 UTC,A band. You can slow down and really let it stretch where needed. You can also fight the tension with your pecs (stretch the band) as necessary through part of the range if something feels too tender.
flexibility,3budqt,Lipofect,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:31:50 2015 UTC,"A band is really much better, you don't risk injury with one. I started doing BD's with a short broom, but my grip was too narrow.

flexibility,3budqt,benjimann91,2,Thu Jul 2 13:35:54 2015 UTC,damn. was it a sudden tear or over time?   The cue I'm following is to not feel any grinding in the shoulder joint with the stick dislocates. I think I read that in an old Coach Sommer post somewhere.

In fact, it gave me some shoulder pain in my right shoulder.  I have been doing a lot of hanging and one arm dumbbell overhead presses focusing on perfect form. Perfect form means always trying to activate the serratus anterior and the lower trap in order to upwardly rotate the scapula. This is an important component in shoulder flexion. If you cannot do this, stretching might not be the best thing to do right now.  My shoulders are still far from open, but I'm having positive results and my shoulders feel healthy."
flexibility,3budqt,darrensurrey,5,Thu Jul 2 07:49:03 2015 UTC,"That has been my experience too.  Scapular mobility and the ability to properly move the scapular in the correct manner for shoulder flexion were/are my biggest problems, rather than tightness with the muscles attached to the humerus.  I have found that practising the T part of the IYT exercises and focusing primarily on maintaining a feeling of posterior scapular tilt allows upward rotation of my scapular to occur more effectively."

You can feel how lower trap activation feels using the Y of the ywtl exercices.  To explain serraturs anterior is more difficult. You can try this. Stand straight(spine straight, lift chest). One side is facing a mirror. Now perform a wall slide(without wall) with your arm facing the mirror while keeping your serratus anterior activated. Go slow and if you start feeling pain dont go higher. If you dont have to much body fat around your ribs, you should see your serratus muscle contracting."

I was told I have subpar mobility by those experts and but that it probably wouldn't have ever be a hinderance had I not started lifting (at 38 years old, so there's that, too).   Anyway, I have a bunch of tweaks but a major one that has prevented me from doing overhead work or back barbell squats is on again/off again discomfort verging on pain is at the top of my bicep and/or front delt on both arms and that might be referred pain from the shoulders (that's what my former trainer guessed).   I'd love to really focus on increasing mobility very gradually in that area. Are there specific things I could do to rehab? Fwiw, I have always stretched before lifting and have done the door jamb stretch and shoulder dislocations with both bands and broom sticks but still this problem arises. I used to foam roll but haven't in a while just because the discomfort is acute and I'm in lazy bum mode (trying to dig myself out of the hole).  TIA!"

Practice forward folds, starting with your knees bent and focusing more on keeping your back flat rather than rounding your spine. Also if you really want to focus on the splits, you will need to work your hip flexor flexibility as well as hamstring flexibility so move between a low lunge to straightening front leg sending buttocks back towards heels and lowering your chest over your front thigh (this is called half monkey pose in yoga) The main thing is to keep practicing daily! It's better to do 10 minutes a day for a week instead of one hour once a week. Consistency is key- have fun and be safe :)"
flexibility,3bva1d,sting_rae,5,Thu Jul 2 13:02:05 2015 UTC,"You're stretching the sciatic nerve, be a bit cautious with that and take it as a sign that you're taking your stretch too far. Maybe see if gentle nerve flossing helps.  Also reading that you're hypermobile, I find it very questionable if you actually should be stretching those muscles, maybe even at all!? The muscle tension you're experiencing is likely a protective mechanism due to joint instability and not a lack of mobility. In that case, working on joint stability within the bounds of ""healthy"" range of motion will serve you so much better.   Yoga is, imho, actually a really poor choice for hypermobile people. Instructors are often poorly educated and none of the yoga schools I know focus systematically on joint stability. Rather I'd highly recommend you search for an able PT with good understanding on how to assess and work with people with joint hypermobility (syndrome).   There's a short article by Eric Cressey that might be interesting in this regard (particularly #1, maybe #2, #3 and #11 as well)."
flexibility,3bva1d,GoGoGoemon,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:13:19 2015 UTC,TIL. I thought my feet were just weird. Is there a good way to improve joint stability?
flexibility,3bva1d,serotoninlove,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:04:46 2015 UTC,"You are talking about your ankles I suppose?   If you are experiencing any actual problems (pain etc.) at any joint due to possible hypermobility, really go see a physical therapist, especially one who is trained in these matters! This isn't exactly rocket science, but it can be hard to do by yourself and you might need some starting help.  For general ankle stability and proprioception, lots of balancing exercises will be beneficial. Learn to use the feet as a tripod with even pressure on the side of the little toe, big toe and heel to preserve the arch of the foot and not collapse the ankle. Start by simply standing on one leg, once that gets easy move on to standing on uneven surfaces (e.g. a cushion) and unstable surfaces like wobble boards. I'm a big fan of Star excursions! I have a dodgy left ankle and these are pretty challenging on my left side! Try not to collapse your ankle as much as he does in the video and brace your core a bit for some added core stability goodness. Go for quality of movement rather then arbitrary sets/reps. You are not trying to build up raw strength, but proprioception, ""proper"" muscle recruitment and some endurance."
flexibility,3bva1d,GoGoGoemon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:08:04 2015 UTC,"You seem to be knowledgeable. I (am pretty sure I) have hypermobile joints as well as being flexible, to the point where I am mildly worried about my health. I have very recently dislocated a knee just from running and I assume it happened so simply because of the hypermobility. There are other things that happen but I don't think I need to go into detail  I always thought that yoga would be good as it would allow me to strengthen my muscles when extended so my range of motion would still be as large as it is but much stronger. So I am wondering, if yoga is bad what could I be doing?"
flexibility,3bva1d,HanumanKingBar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:09:09 2015 UTC,"Dislocations suck big time! Sorry, man!  I am really not that knowledgeable and the internet is generally a shitty doctor! So, especially since you are experiencing complications, I'd strongly suggest you go seek the help of a professional. But I might be able to give you a couple pointers for now.  As I've written above this isn't exactly rocket science, for the most part you will want to strengthen the muscles surrounding the joint and develop better proprioception (awareness of body position) mainly in regards to not hyperextending joints. Simple as that, but especially developing proprioception can be very tricky in hypermobile joints and for that you might simply need a bit of hands-on starting help by a professional with keen eyes. I would look out for a PT who is not only knowledgeable in hypermobility but who also actively trains preferably in the same sports you do, or in things like gymnastics, general strength training, any practice that puts stress on pretty much all joints.  The balance exercises I've listed above are generally a good thing (really for everyone - hypermobile or stiff zombie). I really like the Star excursions for balance and some glute medius strength. Hip airplanes are also great for the very same reasons (especially the later single-leg progressions). There is a good article on somastruct exactly about hyperextending knees with a list of proper strengthening exercises (Romanian deadlifts, lunges, squats, hip thrusts, calf raises).   Generally, you want to build up proprioception how not to go beyond full (neutral) extension (sometimes referred to as closed-packed position). In order to do that, like its mentioned in the article above too, train this in front of a mirror or take a video of yourself. If you've never done this before, you might be surprised how far off your body position often is from what your body is telling you! But don't fret! That happens to all of us!  Also don't worry too much about being hypermobile or having the ""condition"" of hypermobility. Interestingly pain neuroscience tells us that the very thought of ""danger, illness, possible injury, bad posture"" itself can cause pain without any actual trauma or injury even being present. Rather see it as an advantage! Just think of all the hours someone stiffer like me has to put in. On the flip side you probably will have to put more stress on and hours into developing joint stability (ability to stiffen your joints) by strengthening the surrounding muscles.  Now, yoga isn't bad per se, but its practice is primarily focused on end ranges of joint motion, which is fine for you, you just need to learn not to exceed ""healthy"" or ""normal"" range of motion. It's also not a very balanced physical practice (e.g. no upper body pulling movements) and doesn't put too much focus on strength and stability in general. You will have to supplement with additional exercises. I wouldn't rely on yoga instructors to teach you either of that, you might get lucky and have an experienced and well-educated one with a clear understanding of particular students needs, but then many won't be. That's too much of a gamble for me! Rather get knowledgeable yourself!  By the way, the Hypermobility Syndromes Association has a forum, but they charge for annual membership. I really can't tell if it's worth joining?! They have a couple resources for free though."

Cause is usually a disc defect.  Overstretching can tear or bulge a disc.  Usually, this kind of thing self resolves after a couple months.  At 2 months, it warrants a visit to a spine doctor.  See your orthopedist (MD).  They can confirm, and make recommendations for treatment.    Since it only hurts when turning that way, don't turn that way past the feeling of hurt until you talk to the MD.  If it bugs you while waiting for the appointment, ice sometimes helps, as does otc anti-inflammatories.  But don't take medical advice from the internet, and don't try to self diagnose from WebMD.

Put the inside of your foot to the pole, hold the pole with both hands gripping from opposite directions. Start lowering your torso and raising your other leg at the same time until you are in a straddle position with your torso horizontal (almost in position basically!). Hook the ankle of the top leg on the pole and bring your body in front of the pole (that is, from the other side of the pole where the feet are) as much as your flexibility allows. Some can only get their neck through, but I think you'll be able to get into it with your armpits on the pole and your hands free.

It's more of a safety measure, because if you grip with both hands from the same side (think thumb to thumb) and lose balance you'll fall on your face and we don't want them.

I can't say that training like this is 'good' for your feet, but it will get you a good strong point in the end:  Get a theraband. You wanna fold it over in half width-ways so its quite firm, and then sit on the floor with legs straight out in front of you. Wrap the theraband under your foot so you are holding both ends with your hands and your toes are pressed up into the folded bit. Now pull back with your hands until you feel good resistance. Now, point those toes. Imagine its your MIDDLE toe that is folding forward, from the middle of your foot. Sort of like closing a book. PUSH your toes into the theraband, then release, and you will feel like it wants to snap back but RESIST and return to the starting position slowly and with control. Repeat this like 20x each side.

Avoid letting the foot sickling in during this, when you point in general there should be no sickling, and the inner side of your leg should form a straight line from the inner thigh to the big toe.

flexibility,3bm20n,wifewithalife,5,Tue Jun 30 09:13:37 2015 UTC,"Hi! I don't have a structured routine as such. I'm in the circus, and so I do a lot of flexibility training with that, this normally just consists of all three splits, pancake and pike, plus various other upper and lower body stretches. One piece of advice that I have though, read Relax Into Stretch by Pavel Tsatsouline, the contrast breathing method explained in that book is a method that I use about three days a week, and I've noticed a lot of improvements!  Specifically for my pike, I stand on an elevated surface like a bench or some bricks and I hang down and relax as much as possible. When my muscles start to feel a stretch I employ the contrast breathing technique from Relax Into Stretch. I normally warm up with some skipping and some dynamic stretching for a little bit, and then get into my contrast breathing for all splits, (I don't do contrast breathing for my back because that can be somewhat injury-inducing!)."
flexibility,3bm20n,wifewithalife,2,Tue Jun 30 10:13:07 2015 UTC,Skipping is awesome. I'm a grown ass adult who enjoys skipping as well.

flexibility,3biz4s,ClockworkMagpie,6,Mon Jun 29 16:46:09 2015 UTC,Sliding into a front split with the back knee on the ground (elevated if needed) should allow you do add load pretty readily. Cody Sunkel has a video on this that works if you don't already have your front splits
flexibility,3biz4s,phrakture,2,Mon Jun 29 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"I've been using the ISO splits Cody shows here but with the back knee off the ground, supporting on my toes at the back and heel at the front, and wearing socks on a polished wood floor so I can slide deeper into the stretch and have to use a stronger contraction to hold it at any point. It is working well! 3x30s holds on either side 2 or 3 times per week. You can bend the front leg slightly to make it more hip flexor focused if you need."

flexibility,3biz4s,Masklin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:26:18 2015 UTC,I saw that one before. It doesn't isolate the hip flexors though. I mostly feel it in the hamstrings since they are in the final stretched out position and probably try to compensate for my inflexible hip flexors.
flexibility,3biz4s,phrakture,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:40:52 2015 UTC,You're probably forward bending a lot more than you think. Stay as vertical as possible. I can definitely change where the load is applied based on torso position.
flexibility,3biz4s,phrakture,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:23:14 2015 UTC,"I might be but I doubt that. I try to keep upright in my splits as much as I can. Otherwise it just shifts weight away from my hips and lessen the load on the back leg. I can already lay down on my front leg, so staying upright is definitely something I watch out for."

flexibility,3biz4s,fr_eyes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:26:20 2015 UTC,That does seem like a lot of backbend.  You know how there's the variation on the kneeling lunge where you tuck the pelvis first? Try that before sliding forward in the front split.
flexibility,3biz4s,fr_eyes,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:42:57 2015 UTC,"Let me grab 3 random splits pics: one, two and three. I just pulled them off the google images trying to get both sexes, different disciplines and clear view of the hips. Look how their hip tilt forward while having perfect splits and upright torso. I didn't carefully selected these either.  Everybody have their splits with a pelvis tilted forward, except maybe few rare unicorns. The sitting upright comes a lot from the lower back for most, because for most, the hip flexors are willing to open up to only 30 degrees or so.   If any, now that I compare my photo to these, maybe I'm overdoing the tucking under the tailbone to work on my hip flexors, and don't realize my full split potential."

But I really want to focus on them solely because I'm pretty sure they are what stops me from having flat splits."

flexibility,3biz4s,Mellor88,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:37:54 2015 UTC,"Simple partner stretches are one possible way.  The other is to add weight to a standing lunge stretch. I would recommend to start off with Kit's Solo hip flexor stretch, this is already a pretty intense hf stretch in and of itself and also ""loaded"", just not with external weight. You can then progress that by using weights and maybe elevating your front leg.  As for ""loaded progressive"" stretching I think this is actually Ido Portal's trademark or not? It feels a bit redundant to me, since any stretch is loaded with a percentage of bodyweight and progressive by definition. I don't have a better term though. However, afaik he uses his diagonal stretch for loaded progressive HF stretching. I like this one a lot, but I'd call this an advanced stretch due to somewhat complicated lumbar spine positioning and required balance. Also my lower back doesn't always appreciate the twisting."

I've had an issue with the term being bandied about, but it's always bugged me as basically any good stretch should have some load applied to the muscle.   Any passive stretch will be loaded to some degree, but LPS differs (at least in my understanding) in that the plan is to add external resistance over time. So the load will eventually be greater than the corresponding BW stretch. If its only the ROM, time, sets etc that's progressing, then its not LPS imo. Although, its by no means less valid as a stretch."

This sounds a lot like the traditional weights vs calisthenics arguments. Varying position and poses will increase the load once you have maxed out a stretch in the same manner as external resistance.  Don't get me wrong, I love external resistance. I just don't see it as some brand new epiphany."
flexibility,3biz4s,SunMakerr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:13:17 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love external resistance. I just don't see it as some brand new epiphany.   Nor do I. I think Ido was just coining a phrase for a group of existing stretches. The phrase isn't needed, but I like it as it describes the parameters well. I also don't think that Ido should retain ownership of the phrase as its dimmy basic English adjectives"
flexibility,3biz4s,SunMakerr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:33:58 2015 UTC,"If you take a look at Ido's diagonal stretch that I've linked above, he's clearly selling that as LPS. Here he's only using increasing leverage (and instability). Since he's the one who coined this term, to my knowledge, I guess we can safely assume that he isn't talking about using external resistance exclusively. His quote below also shows that he's making use of all kinds of resistance training variables and not just external weights.    I am not even sure that there is such a thing as a clear LPS methodology, It seems that this is just how Ido calls his stretching system and it kind of took off from there. From what I've seen he lumps all kinds of stretches in there that are primarily aimed at strengthening end ROM and are not ""relaxed"":   How, you ask? Using Loaded Progressive Stretching.  Basically - use resistance to fight against, increase training variables such as amount of resistance, time under tension, number of reps and total volume and make sure to progress these variables and your flexibility will progress along side.  I do not make use of relaxed stretching any more, besides one scenario where I view it as beneficial: at night to calm the nervous system down after a day of training.  If you are an inflexible person looking to increase ranges of motion, do not waste your time on relaxed stretching. Use Loaded Progressive Stretching and the results are soon to follow.   So, revising my statement from above, I guess more precise terms are already there, mainly isometric and dynamic stretching, both possibly weighted. ;-)"

Since he's the one who coined this term, to my knowledge, I guess we can safely assume that he isn't talking about using external resistance exclusively   I wasn't trying to say that LPS uses external exclusively. Sorry, I can see how it read that way. What I meant was that the load was progressive over time. But it's not the only progression in my eyes, time, sets, reps etc. basically as mentioned in his quote. I've never looked at any of Ifos stuff tbh. My starting point was Emmet Louis video in the FAO, which gives a similar overview.   So, revising my statement from above, I guess more precise terms are already there, mainly isometric and dynamic stretching, both possibly weighted. ;-)   Yeah sure. As I said, the phrase wasn't needed, existing words describe various types of stretching well enough already. I simply like the phrase LPS as it describes a particular part of my stretching plan well (to me at least). I detailed it in a progress post last week. It involves precisely what you said, loaded isometric & dynamic stretches. LIDS - that can be the new acronym ;)"
flexibility,3biz4s,SunMakerr,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:54:50 2015 UTC,"I was referring to a progressive way to stretch the hip flexors, which is usually done by added weight and reps over time, like I've seen with pikes and pancakes. I thought that progressive loaded stretching was that, but maybe I misunderstood it.   Having somebody to put your thigh where it supposed to go is awesome, but usually I don't have that luxury when I stretch. That solo stretch never worked for me, it just puts some unexplained stress on my back knee (could be tight quads, but I can easy bring my foot the the bum so they are not that tight).   That diagonal stretch is weird and new to me. I'll be checking that one out."
flexibility,3biz4s,Antranik,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:57:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hadn't really thought much about it until this thread, I was just taking a jab at Ido for coining such a, in my opinion, redundant and funny term. As it seems LPS just refers to Ido's general flexibility system, in which he lumps all kinds of stretches that use resistance to develop strength in end ROM, so weighted dynamic stretches like pike and pancake good mornings that you mention, or more isometric ones like his diagonal stretch or horse stance, that probably includes his wushu protocol of ballistic stretches as well. Emmet's interpretation in deed seems to be more narrow though. Anyway, it's just words.  Partner stretches are usually inconvenient for me too. I sometimes wonder if that's the real reason why Thomas Kurz hates them so much?! He just never had anyone around because he's such a gruff, haha!  I don't think I've ever used weights for HF stretching, the regular ones have so far already been intense enough for me. I use that diagonal stretch sometimes dynamically (even ballistically) though, usually for high reps by just bouncing back and forth. I also modify it sometimes, especially if I go for long stretches of 40-60 slow breaths, by not twisting and putting my rear foot fully on the ground. It's a very scalable stretch!  By the way, I just rememberd there was a gymnasticbodies' thread a while back on weighted HF stretches in general. I don't think there was much more than what is already in this thread (weighted Thomas test possibly, which could actually work quite well done dynamically for reps), but maybe you get some more ideas from there?"
flexibility,3bfxm4,bbbrapbbbrap,6,Sun Jun 28 21:44:38 2015 UTC,"It depends entirely on your purpose. There are basically the configurations you're looking for during flexibility practice:   Strengthening a muscle in the extreme lengthened position Strengthening a muscle in the extreme shortened position (active flexibility) Relaxing a muscle in the extreme lengthened position   The first two work to help your practical flexibility, the 3rd to adjust the resting tension in the body. If you're looking to improve the first element then you want to contact strongly throughout the hold (possibly letting the stretch go deeper then ree engaging the contraction). If you're looking for the third than you want to look at relaxing the muscle as much as possible (again letting it go deeper and then recuing relaxation where necessary)  I wrote a more detailed article on this topic which you can read here"

flexibility,3bfxm4,Cragdor,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:48:09 2015 UTC,"It depends what you mean by passive. If you focus on relaxing, then you may achieve your splits on the floor, but not have the strength to hold them off the ground like Thomas kurz shows in my article (yellow shirt). I know a lot of people like this, and this way of doing things typically has 2 problems, the first is that you are exposed to the possibility of injury due to having extreme range without strength, the second is it is often the case that people with this kind of flexibility need a big warmup before they can make use of it.  My recommendation is to do one or two sessions of relaxation style per week, and then 4 or more strength based sessions per week."

flexibility,3bdnq3,Hereformarks,3,Fri Jul 3 00:30:40 2015 UTC,"Low back pain is a really complicated topic, your particular solution might be as easy as ""stretch this, strengthen that"", but it might also not be. That it doesn't seem to be a spinal problem itself (disc protrusion etc.) is certainly good news. I'm not sure if I can help you much, all I can do is present you with a true ""shotgun approach"" (of mostly current self-help literature), that might help you narrow down the cause of your back pain.  Generally, my first suspicion would be that (muscular) trigger points are involved. This has been true more often than not for myself, and also that there is no sign of any kind of injury is a tell-tale sign for trigger points, to my understanding. In short and very rough terms, trigger points are muscle ""knots"", constantly contracted muscle fibers, which form at the muscle-nerve innervations and can refer pain (and other more weird symptoms, like dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, one-sided headaches, supposedly even impotence, etc etc) to other body parts (often to the very next joint, more rarely at point of origin itself, which makes diagnosis a bit complicated). They are caused by overworking or overstretching a muscle habitually (all sorts of daily movement patterns, sleeping posture etc.) or all sorts of one-time traumata (from something severe as an impact accident to something harmless as a heavy squat, deadlift).  I've only experienced low back pain once myself, in my case it was caused by trigger points in the gluteus medius and easily resolved for good by massage and gentle stretching within mere days. So, gluteus medius is definitely a good starting point; psoas and iliacus (hip flexors) as ClockworkMagpie said are a good bet as well, but there are plenty of others which all or only some could be involved. I'd check them all:   gluteus medius, psoas/iliacus, both deep and superficial spinal muscles themselves, quadratus lumborum, gluteus maximus, rectus abdominus, soleus, muscles of the pelvic floor    So, how to check yourself for trigger points? In short, just rub your muscles in question and search for ""exquisitely"" painful spots, sometimes you can even feel a ""knot"" in the muscle (like a tiny pea or uncooked piece of spaghetti). These are the spots you want to massage. How often? I'd go for a couple times a day. Try at least once a day, if you're pressed for time, but don't beat yourself up if you miss a day. How long? I'd go for roughly 30 secs each spot, more if you feel like it. There really isn't a limit, go by feel! How intense? So intense that it's still ""exquisitely"" painful, rather err on the side of too gentle! A cue that works for me, is to stay in a ""pain zone"" of just before I'd have to squint my eyes. How to massage? There are so many intricacies, but for simplicities sake, just dig a bit into the muscle and rub the painful spot back and forth, or in a circular motion, or stay on the painful spot for some time and apply gentle pressure (this works especially good with very painful spots/active trigger points). Your general goal is to relax the muscle! I prefer to use my fingers, knuckles and massage balls. Some people seem to do okay with a foam roller, but I found that to be much too awkward for all muscles except the quads.  You can try this pretty much now. I often get an immediate response, if trigger points are involved or the sole cause, in that the pain/symptoms lessen or even go away while massaging the right spot. But don't be surprised if the pain comes back quite quickly. It often takes a while to make muscular changes really stick.  I highly recommend (to everyone really) to get yourself a copy of Clair Davies' excellent The Trigger Point Therapy Workbook. The english version is dirt-cheap, but so incredibly useful for self-diagnosing these things! It's sorted by pain symptoms and provides muscle charts of trigger point sites and referred pain patterns, easy accessible guides for massage techniques, how to differentiate ""good"" and ""bad"" pain, how to access certain deeper muscles and all that.  Although some massage therapists contraindicate stretching (because aggressive stretching itself can cause trigger points and worse), I've found a combined approach the most effective for myself. In my opinion, this will come down to general body-awareness and how experienced someone is with stretching. Do both mindfully, stretching as well as self-massage. In some cases massage alone didn't do it for me and I needed to do gentle, long-duration stretches (4+ minutes) to get a lasting effect, my glute medius were such a case. Thinking about it, nowadays I use self-massage actually more as a sort of myofascial self-diagnostic tool and stretching as my primary ""treatment"", YMMV though.  Kit Laughlin's Overcome Neck & Back Pain presents a very thorough approach of self-diagnosis and self-treatment through stretching and strengthening. This comes highly recommended, as anything Kit does so far! The newest edition doesn't come so cheap though, there's a free sample on the page I linked btw. Kit's book is really easy to understand and follow as well, but while Davies' Trigger Point presents more of an abridged reference guide to various symptoms, this one is specifically designed for your kind of problem. He has also a hell of a lot of unsorted, free stretches on yt, here are a couple that might be relevant to back problems:   Floor piriformis stretch (involves glute medius as well), Wall hip flexor, Chair lower back stretch (involves quadratus lumborum), Standing lower back stretch   Last, there is Stuart McGill's Ultimate Back Fitness and Performance. This one is a bit of a mixed bag. It's simply brilliant, no doubt, and McGill is the expert (in science and practice) on low back pain and all things spinal health, but his book is aimed at very informed readers (fitness professionals etc.). As such it provides one with a great tool-set on how to build strong backs and how to rehabilitate ""bad"" backs, but it leaves the programming to the reader (questions of how much, how often, what exercise to do when etc.). So, while I would recommend the other two books wholeheartedly to everyone, this one could proof to be very frustrating and overwhelming for many. The main reason I put this here is that it might serve as a good ""screening test"", if you're on the search for a good PT, at least if you're living in the english-speaking world that is. If a ""back specialist"" isn't aware of McGill's research, I simply wouldn't bother with that one to be honest.  On a very basic level Mc Gill's approach is simply strengthening the core and glutes and developing core control to protect the lower back. For this he uses his ""big three"" core exercises (curl-up, side bridge, birddog) and some glute activation drills (glute bridge, clam, one-legged squats and hip airplanes) for a good general, albeit very basic, low back stability starting routine. I use all these in my warm-up, starting off with ~10 gentle reps of cat/camel. You could try to use them as a sort of back rehab, but only do the ones that don't aggravate your back, of course. Don't worry too much about sets/reps/hold times, instead aim for quality of movement and stop at form breakdown, these are more meant as muscle activation drills. The ones you're really weak at, will tell you which strength imbalances might be involved as well in your back pain.  tl;dr I could have written a shorter comment, but didn't have the time."

Hip flexors, which connect to the lower back, can tug on it and cause the pain you experience. They also seem to be a muscle you work out in your training so they have a reason to tighten without stretching.  You could try to do lunges for a month or so, see it that elevates the pain. But if it's so severe that you take pain meds, maybe you shouldn't shoot in the dark and just get diagnosed. Your body, your health and the quality of your life are worth that money. A Chiropractor might be able to help you as well, if that's more in your budget."

flexibility,3bdnq3,m1sta,-1,Sun Jun 28 08:44:57 2015 UTC,"My wild bet is that your hips are twisted. When you bend it causes a movement that results in your spinal disc bulging. The lack of flexibility is actually the result of nerve pressure, not muscle tension. I've met a lot of phyisos who are unable to diagnose and treat such things but they're not difficult. They do take some time though. Stop anything that aggravates the pain immediately.  When you bend forward at the hips to you naturally stay centred and square?"
flexibility,3bag85,Tombawun,7,Sat Jun 27 09:14:05 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!  That's a solid pike, but it looks like a lot of the ROM is in 1-2 vertebrae. You have tons of potential to open your hamstrings, hips, and lower back. Don't let your pursuit of a shape ruin your back."

Obviously opening the hips and legs places less mobility requirement on the spine.   For my completely flat lumbar spine, I've been been working on articulations (weighted and unweighted), and spinal twists. I've had some decent success so far.  Dunno what to do about hypermobile segments."

flexibility,3bag85,potted_petunias,5,Sat Jun 27 09:17:30 2015 UTC,"Tips: Start with half forward fold with a back that's relatively straight and parallel to the group, and hands on shins. Feet can be hip width distance apart or even a tad wider. From here you can bend the knees slightly, internally rotate the thighs just a bit, but keep relaxing the fronts of the thighs. Allow your abdomen to start working towards the thighs without losing the straightness of the back - this usually involves keeping the abdomen pulling in towards the spine which protects the back and will prevent you from flexing only in the upper lumbar region. If anything you want to see if you get the lowest tips of your ribcage on your thighs, and then try to keep lengthening the spine, working the top of your head closer to the floor rather than forehead to knees.  Your head will likely be nowhere near your knees, but I imagine this will feel like a completely different stretch :)  I don't know if it's hamstrings or lumbar region that's tight for you, maybe both, but working this way might help loosen those areas."

That really means a lot to me, actually :) Just noticed I wrote ""parallel to the group"" instead of the ground, whoops.  Note these instructions only work for a while....at some point it will be good to include engaging the front thighs(which will encourage the hamstrings to release more) and working the sits bones towards the sky. You'll find different variations of engaged leg muscle groups will provide different release in the lower back and abdomen."
flexibility,3bag85,broscientologist,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:13:19 2015 UTC,"When in your pike try to stick out your butt more. You can back off a little to allow some more wiggle room for that motion. The more you stick out your butt, the more the stretch goes into the hamstrings.  Also try to straighten that microbend in the knees (unless that the best their got). A slight bend at the knees lessens the stretch in the hamstrings and we want more of it not less.  Lastly, try to transfer your weight forward to your toes."

Have given /u/potted_petunias advice a whirl as well, Seems to feel like the beginning of the rest of the road but but sticky outyness and hip rotation has got to be a big part of it right?

flexibility,3bbl9l,JCFPE,5,Sat Jun 27 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"A vast majority if lack of flexibility is merely a ""use it or lose it"" thing. If you don't use advanced ROM regularly, you neurologically adapt to not use it.  Basically: stretch and do other things over full ranges of motion regularly, and you will get better over time. It can take a long time, so be patient."
flexibility,3bbl9l,phrakture,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:21:14 2015 UTC,"Without knowing more about your overall fitness, my first thought would be tight muscles that are preventing you from being flexible. As you know, muscles work through Agonist-Antagonist pairs with the joints being the pivot point connecting the two groups. In order to bend your knees, for example, hamstrings have to contract while your quadraceps have to relax at the same time. If your quads don't relax, movement at the knee joint is limited. Hydration could also play a role as it tends to prevent relaxation if you're dry."

flexibility,3bbl9l,emprameen,2,Sat Jun 27 19:06:29 2015 UTC,"Fascial constrictions are a likely culprit. Also, muscles and tendons typically have the capability of moving the entire range of motion of joints, but are frequently restricted by our stretch reflex (Which is, in essence, a nerve response). I think the exception to this is in people who lift weights regularly in order to bulk up (which is largely due to scar tissue formation) and fail to extend their reps the full range of motion of the joint. Even then, the fascial layers are doing to be a major restrictor of movement.  It's possible that ligaments can tighten up, but ligamentous changes, like tendonous ones, are slow.   The fascia around your muscles will also become inflexible, dense, and gluelike due to lack of movement in those areas.   Stretch reflexes can be changed in a number of ways, including weight training, and static active stretching. Fascial restrictions of many layers can be rehydrated through bodywork (Rolfers specialize in this).  And the dense connective tissue of ligaments and tendons can be stretched, but it takes about 6-10 weeks for this tissue to heal and strengthen due to lack of blood flow. Don't over-do it! It's probably not the the main issue in of your inflexibility anyway.  And generally, not being adequately hydrated will probably make your issues worse."

flexibility,3bbl9l,phrakture,2,Sat Jun 27 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"Drink water. Stretch normally, carefully, and regularly. Talk to a knowledgeable weight trainer about increasing range-of-motion-- our movements can be restricted by strength imbalances/deficiencies, not necessarily just lack of muscle length, so weight training can be helpful. Get fascia-focused hands-on bodywork done, like Rolfing."

flexibility,3bbl9l,emprameen,4,Sun Jun 28 17:19:30 2015 UTC,"Contractile properties of fascia have in research shown to be very weak compared to muscles themselves, yes, but structurally fascia is incredibly strong. This is why the claim in the fascial therapy field, that fascial properties can be changed through massage or foam rolling might ultimately prove wrong (or just not as right), since it's simply too strong to be deformed that easily.   Last I checked a final verdict on fascial ""adhesions"" still stands out, but if I understood Robert Schleip correctly his research has shown that fascia can actually be structurally changed and elastic movement properties can be restored (through rapid dynamic stretching e.g.).  Unfortunately, you are certainly right in that there's a lot of hogwash surrounding the whole fascia topic, which makes it annoyingly hard to find the few relevant bits and pieces that we safely can assume to be true and useful to us. Also scientific research is simply still lacking in this field, give it another 10 years or so and we can hopefully have more meaningful discussions about this."
flexibility,3bbl9l,emprameen,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:51:18 2015 UTC,"I appreciate this response. And even as someone who is training to be a bodyworker, I agree that it's very likely even strong touch won't change the structure of the fascia that easily. The ""adhesions"" theory is still just theory-- although there is proof that tissue structures tend to build up where there is lack of movement as demonstrated post-mortem. We're not sure what that entails to a living person yet.   One of the components of touch is that it naturally stimulates the nervous system, sometimes out of a tense state. It's been theorized that this is also the case with acupuncture sometimes. The hands-on approach is pretty dynamic in that respect. It can stimulate blood-flow, move lymph, provide neuromuscular possibilities of movement where one's body was unsure. And, there is definitely a hydration component when it comes to moving tissue that seems to lack movement.   Addressing your last paragraph: Something that's not accepted in the scientific community doesn't exclude its possible usefulness, or an experiential truth for someone else. In other words, if it works for someone, then it works for them. If we're talking about this nature of mobility issues, I imagine the medical advice would be to get some imaging done, and maybe surgery, or to see a physical therapist, who would be providing some amount of hands-on work, strength-training, and maybe those weird tens machines, which I suppose, are employed because they work for some people."
flexibility,3bbl9l,emprameen,0,Mon Jun 29 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"Having been in a cadaver lab and yanked on fascia personally, I can assure you fascia actually has rather amazing tensile strength.   Mostly there aren't many published articles regarding fascia and it's role in movement in our bodies. What I can attest to, is seeing dozens and dozens of clients' before and after photos after having fascia focused body-work done. And I actually speak with many of them. I've personally seen amazing results after working hands-on with athletes regarding this. Medical rational isn't as interesting to me as results, and if OP is looking for results, reading medical papers isn't going to give them. Trying things that have worked for other people is a more effective suggestion, don't you think?  In light of that, I'm not really going to bother posting tons of articles for something that I know works, and have seen results from learning about and giving attention to."

One thing I learned in the cadaver lab is that skin is also a huge factor in mobility. You'd be surprised how differently bodies move when the superficial layers of skin and fascia are reflected. If it's muscle, tendon, or ligamentous tissue that's restricting mobility, then this shouldn't be the case. If it's a stretch reflex causing muscles to contract before reaching the end-range of motion of a joint, then the cadaver with superficial layers in tact should have mobility through that range of motion-- but this is not always the case, leaving the only possible explanations to be other sources of restriction like fascial and dermal tissues."

I work a full-time cubicle job, in a chair that really isn't the best. The day I took that picture, my back was feeling so stiff and just sending shooting pains down my legs. I was standing up several times a day trying to twist my back to pop it, cause it was just so tense. I remember sitting and thinking ""welp, my body is only going down hill from here."" And thinking that thought broke my heart. I never even explored or learned what my body was capable of. I remembered seeing contortionists on TV as a kid and recalled the awe and admiration I had for them, and I just got angry! I went to the bathroom and tried a bridge, and obviously the results were pretty pathetic. I recorded it on my phone because I wanted to make sure they got better.   During the past 7 months my back has ached so badly that I thought I'd never walk again. I didn't realize how many muscles I've never even touched! After a back session I would be SUPER sore for sometimes days afterward. With time, the pain has faded, my back doesn't hurt at work anymore, and I can do a back stretching session and feel nothing but relaxed and loosened the next day. The same thing has happened with my hips too. I used to get Charlie horses in my hips just sitting two-up on my SO's motorcycle.

flexibility,3b7jxi,snakehouse,6,Fri Jun 26 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"Pain is quite a subjective feeling, and people have different pain tolerance. Different muscles give a different pain feeling, broad muscles might feel more painful the stretch because of how big they are and how they make the pain seem ""big"". So it's hard to quantify how much pain we should feel from stretching.  You need to learn to distinguish 2 kinds of pain - the good pain and the bad one.   The good pain is the pain you feel when the muscle first tenses up. It's your nervous system warns you that you are entering danger territory. It shouldn't be teeth grinding strong pain, and some people consider it more of a discomfort rather than actual pain. After a while the muscle will get tired to stay tensed up and release, and that pain will go away. That's the good pain that you need to learn to love.  The bad pain is completely different, and hopefully you'll never get to meet it. Sometimes you don't even feel pain when you injury yourself, but you can definitely tell apart the pain that your nervous system fires to your brain than the pain of actually inflicting damage to your muscles/tendons. I don't have a good desperation of it, but we you feel it you'll know it.   If you have a pain that lingers after you stop stretching, it's a bad pain as well. There's pain that persists after you finished your stretching or on the following day, and it's not muscle soreness then it's a bad pain.  Either way, when you encounter pain, you need to wait it out (or use other techniques) to let it subside before you push further. If you try to push though the pain, even the good pain, you risk injury. When you feel the good pain your muscle is all tensed up, and if you push into it, the muscles won't relax to let you go further, it will just strain or tear. So don't listen to your instructor."

flexibility,3b1q2w,ClockworkMagpie,7,Thu Jun 25 10:24:24 2015 UTC,"Background: I’ve never been particularly flexible. Over the last few years I’ve become more active, to the point where I am training 4-8 times a week (strength, conditioning, BJJ, MMA). I try to train smart, and invest time in my mobility and I actually feel that my mobility is good, within the confines of my existing flexibility. By that I mean, I can squat ATG no problem, from a S&C coaching point of view there are no mobility dysfunctions. But I simply didn’t don’t have the flexibility to do a controlled head kick. My hamstrings are tight, as are my hips generally. I can only just about touch my toes. And my middle and front splits were not pretty. Most other guys at the gym just naturally have more flexibility.  Late last year, as part of my general all over mobility work and stretching, I started doing some hip stretches, followed by middle spits seated on the floor against the wall. It was uncomfortable, but I could see some progress, but it was unquantified. After the Christmas holidays, I started taking photos of my max ROM in seat middle spilts. The top photo above shows where I was at on Jan 30th. 115degrees I was doing nothing special, just frog splits, pigeon, and building up time stretching against the wall. I made steady progress for a few weeks. I got up to 121degs, but then it stagnated for weeks. I couldn’t get beyond that. I realised that if I was going to progress past this, I’d need to take a really aggressive approach. Gentle, relaxed stretching wasn’t working.  Loaded Progressive Stretching A couple of methodologies interested me. But the two that stood out were Power Splits (Passive/Loaded Dynamic splits on rings, with a static hold at end of each ""set"") and /u/AmazingEmmets ‘s video on Loaded Progressive Stretching (see the FAQ).  I decided to combine both of these methods into one routine.  Loaded Progressive Splits Routine consists of 3 Days per week stretching with at least 1 day rest between each day  Day 1: Power Splits 3 x 10 reps with a 15 second hold on final rep 1 x 30 second hold on rings (no reps for this last set)  Days 2 & 3: Quasi-Isometric holds 5 x 30 second holds  The following week, sets and reps stay the same, but the holds increase by 15 seconds.  So week 2 will have a 30sec hold after the reps and 45 sec after the hold only sets. When you get to 3mins, stop increasing the time, and add additional load to your bodyweight. Very little weight is needed, you want just enough weight to increase the ROM. Maybe 1-2.5kg starting out  During the holds, you'll need to maintain a lot of tension in the muscles being stretched. Pull your legs together as if you are ""pinching"" the ground, aim for 90%+ of max contraction, almost as hard as you can.  Depending on your current ability you may need work up to max ROM holds on rings, or you might be already ready to jump ahead to longer holds.  So as I said above, before trying the above, I was stalled at 121 degrees for a while. I've been following that routine for 6 weeks now and I'm up to 130deg. Still pretty poor compared to the some of the regulars here, but amazing progress for me. At this pint I'm adding about 1deg per week. (I take a photo like the above and measure it every week)"

flexibility,3b1wuy,cazzah123,8,Thu Jun 25 08:32:25 2015 UTC,"In my mind yoga is a well rounded practice which improves flexibility, strength, balance and calmness of mind. The poses are not meant to be just stretches, they meant to benefit your body in other ways as well. I feel like you can't just take a subset of poses and call it a yoga practice, you should use the wisdom of those who practiced it before you and perfected it bit by bit.   I also think it's a good stretching routine, because it includes things that you and I wouldn't know we should work on. When I started making up my stretching routine, it was all passive stretching and nothing else. I couldn't know that it's not just about stretching your target muscles (which are not always obvious either), but also work and strength and firing up the right muscles to allow others to relax. In Yoga, someone else already figured all of this out for you so you don't have to.   It could be that yoga is not for you, and you can try to find a different program to develop your flexibility or come up with your own. To me it's seems like you haven't done proper yoga practice (20 minutes? A fast paced primary series Ashtanga Yoga take about 1-1.5 hours I think).   Starting Stretching is nice, but if you want to do more than limber up you probably need to allocate more time for your stretching. If you are content with Starting Stretching, then why bother with yoga?"
flexibility,3b1wuy,ClockworkMagpie,-4,Thu Jun 25 16:49:14 2015 UTC,"1-1.5 hours? That's crazy. But that's fine if you do yoga, but I don't have time for that.  I just want a effective way to gain flexibility everywhere. I thought that was yoga. Then I followed a few YouTube videos and didn't feel like it was going anywhere."
flexibility,3b1wuy,ReverendBizarre,4,Thu Jun 25 18:42:26 2015 UTC,"Those 1-1.5 hours involve not just sitting in poses.

If you don't feel that the pose is helping you at all with your stretches try and adjust it slightly so that you get a stretch, with almost all the poses in yoga there should be some form of at least a mild stretch. It really depends on your goals and what you find helps if you prefer stretches, then stretch away and vice versa. Hope this helps!"

The 90 minute classes are pure heaven and there is no way I would have had the knowledge (not even discipline but the KNOWLEDGE) for what to do during that time.  Yoga has taught me not just how to stretch but how to MOVE and FLOW and TRANSITION between moves... not just like, go into the splits and go out of it and stand up and walk about, but to fluidly move within them and get out of it mindfully into something else.  Plus, it's one of the only activities that always puts emphasis on the breath. I'm a little bias though, as yoga changed my life."

Then, spend time in a bent-at-the-waist-touching-your-toes position.  (Yin yoga holds poses for 3-5 minutes apiece but tailor it to your needs!)  You can sit with straight legs and just let yourself sink into the stretch.  Slowly focusing on your breath and release of it will help you feel the ""edge"" your body naturally has to the stretch and it will help you pass it.

flexibility,3auno0,Antranik,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:38:24 2015 UTC,"Stretching Micro-tears in muscles, tendons, and ligaments Inflammation brings repair parts Collagen and muscle fill the tears  Pain is from nerves stretching and reacting to prostaglandins released during the stretch damage.  This is why your muscles may feel the same afterstretching as they do after exercise.  Over time, you get longer, thicker fibers, and muscle tone + collagen elasticity keeps it from being flappy.  There is also some retraining due to different motor structures, but that is minor.  There is also stretching of the nerves that trigger contraction of the opposite muscles, but that is less of it.  Basically, those nerves get triggered less because your ROM is greater before they get activated by compression, stretching, or stretch-damage.  It's similar to how scar tissue grows.  This is why the day after exercise or stretching, everything feels stiff.    You can and should gently massage or gently use the next day too so the new growth is properly aligned and stretched as well. Do not do serious stretching on off days though.  It all needs time to heal. Good examples might be walking or simple ROM tests on off days."

flexibility,3aqauv,sis_masis,6,Mon Jun 22 17:13:57 2015 UTC,I personally stretch when I get out of bed. Before a workout. After a workout. Before I go to bed.   You cannot overdo proper stretching. My morning stretch gets my muscles to wake up after my body has not moved much if at all during the night. My pre-workout stretching loosens up my muscles before I abuse them in my workout. My post - workout stretching is my apology to my muscles for the abuse. My pre-sleep stretching just relaxes me before I go to sleep.    Minimally I would say you should stretch before and after every workout. I feel a lot of people skip the post - workout stretching. However I feel it is as important as stretching before you workout.

flexibility,3aqauv,PanaceaIV,3,Mon Jun 22 19:15:35 2015 UTC,"No, the stretches vary. Some are just static stretching some are yoga poses. TBH sometimes I will do something like body weight squats. Not exactly stretching but it can be if your goal is to get deeper in each movement. I have a decent arsenal to pull from since I have done this for a while. I try to learn at least one new stretch a week just to continue learning. Pretty sure I could spend a lifetime doing Yoga and always be learning and mastering some aspect of it. Generally I try to make sure I hit most muscle groups. I'll focus more on muscles which I feel are unhappy. It is a sensation I have developed through time.   If it's legs day, I'll focus a little heavier on legs that day. Possibly the day after as well, again depending on how I physically feel. I'm not perfect and some times I will miss a muscle group entirely. Currently I am working on my ankles and calves so they're getting a little more attention than most right now. I started by just working out and not stretching. Then realized the importance and stretched before hand.. eventually getting to stretchinh 2-4 times a day. (We're talking years collectively here). Just like exercise, it's a marathon not a sprint. Truly a lifestyle change. So don't expect to just wake up and be stretching 4 times a day. Build up a repertoire and then add in more frequency. Don't make it a chore, enjoy it. That makes it a lasting change.  Edit: Time varies too. Maybe 10 minutes on a busy morning. 30 minutes on average pre and post workouts. I don't think I have gone above an hour and if I have it's not frequent. Sometimes I just get bored of it. I'll do it until my goal for that session is met with the hope to push through and do more."
flexibility,3aqauv,PanaceaIV,2,Mon Jun 22 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks for the info!   I'll start stretching in the morning and before going to sleep. I'll keep it short. Will probably focus on my back the most. Hopefully I will see results soon and will adjust from there. If I see that it helps me during my day or with my sleep, I will probably increase the amount of time I spend stretching during these 2 times of the day.  I also like your idea of learning new things frequently. That really keeps things fun and challenges your body to adapt to new movements. For now, Insanity keeps me going. It has varying moves and is really fun. Once I reach my weight goal, I will certainly bring in bodyweight training into my routine. I am currently reading up on that subject, and it has caught my attention.   But the one thing I also think is important is focus. I want to focus on one thing, learn it, ""master it"", and then learn new things. I want to take things slow and be focused on my goal. I do believe a goal is important and when you deviate from it or keep changing your goal, you lose interest. In my case, I know a goal will keep me going.   Again, appreciate the input, thank you!"

However just because it is what I do or works for me doesn't mean it works for everyone. Although you really cannot go wrong with stretching. However you might find more suitable times for yourself.  Morning stretching has helped me feel less tight during the day. This is even more prevalent  the day after legs day for me. If I was running late and didn't get my morning stretch in, I can tell. I mean it's not something ridiculously substantial but I can tell nonetheless.   I agree with you to truly learn a movement before you move on. There is not a whole lot to be gained from changing it day to day before you really learned a movement. However, when you really know the proper technique (even if you need a quick refresher on proper technique but know the movement), you can change it day to day to suit your specific needs. But this gets me in trouble sometimes as I will be walking into Looney Bakery for my morning coffee and realize ""Bro.. are we not caring about our rotator cuff today?"" Oopse. Time for a quick parkinglot stretch. I do accidentally skip things sometimes.   I find it easier to have different routines, just as I would for lifting. So I am more on autopilot yet know that I will get a well rounded full body stretch in. Then add on a movement to target where I feel tight. I have done this long enough to where learning one new exercise a week doesn't hinder my progress. It just feeds my appetite to learn.  One cool YouTube channel I REALLY like is FitnessBlender. I have learned a lot from them for stretching, Yoga, Pilates, and HIIT. Might want to check them out if you have some time. Good luck and keep working towards your goals!"

flexibility,3ap1cz,splits_ahoy,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:47:52 2015 UTC,"The lack of responses is an answer on it's own. I don't have any experience with your situation, and probably others in this sub as well.   But I'll try to answer, solely based on my existing understanding of how these things work. This it my educated guess:  You were always very flexible without putting an effort, which means you are not used to actually work on your flexibility. It's almost like being a newbie to stretching, but with already flexible muscles. You probably don't know what stretches work for your hamstrings now, especially now that your hamstrings changed. Your body in junior high responded so much better to stretching than your body now.   Basically what I'm trying to say is don't be quick to say this doesn't work for me. Flexibility takes time, even if you had it once. One, two or even a week of stretching is not nearly enough to determine whether it works for you. Try to stick with something for a few months, see if it gets you back to splits.   Do hamstring stretches after you end each shift. You can add light stretching during the shift.   Do a stretching session at least once a week. It doesn't have to be long, just a few hamstring stretches and splits if you are at that level of ease with flexibility.  Try to engage your core when you are leaning over. Sometimes hamstrings make up for lack of core control, so you could be using them more than you need.   This one I'm not sure, but maybe rounding or straightening the lower back can help lift some of the tension off the hamstrings. But I honestly have no idea which could work actually, so you'd have to research it some.  Good luck!"

For most people who don't ""need"" to point their foot (basically everyone besides ballet dancers, gymnasts, pole dancers, or I guess people who just want pointy feet) it is a lack of strength in the arch of the foot that leads to the cramping. Rolling the arch like SunMaker said will help but you just have to consistently point your foot or do arch strengthening exercises in order to get the muscles strong enough to not cramp. I personally think it's great to strengthen and stretch the arches as it can help your posture and improve your balance!

Probably in a reasonable time frame since you aren't 50 and probably can touch your toes.  Now as an older person, you have to use other methods apart from simply stretching or doing yoga. This is definitely true of males as females can sometimes ""relax"" into a full stretch over time. This might be what your yoga teacher is referencing. In that respect, she is right. Your neuromuscular system is less responsive than it was at a young age, so you have to trick it by doing things like ""progressive overload stretching"" (Ido's term) or other related measures.

Unless you have a bone deformity or severe calcification or scar tissue impeding your hip joints you can definitely get straddle splits. Just may take you a year or three. Just listen to your body and don't stay in straddle for long periods of time in the beginning. Ligaments (especially those around the knee and groin) can get overstretched if you sit in straddle too long before you're ready. I've noticed that small spurts sitting in position with calm breathing is better than just hanging out in a forced split at first. Then, when you're getting used to your straddle, up your time by 30seconds each week or two weeks depending on how you're doing. Soon enough you will be heading into pancake and chillin for a minute or two. Add isometric stretching and gravity stretching (laying on back with legs straddled on wall in front of you) will help you along. You can totally do it!"

That you need diversity in your training if you get stuck. Some things just don't seem to work and some things work really work. What works for you seems to be based mostly on your previous training. E.g. I did a lot of passive stretching in yoga before and had a good pike. However, I added high frequency ballistic stretching to try and get head to toe and I went from ""elbow to toe"" to ""head to toe"" in 2 weeks. My routine consists of pancake straddle ups, the lowest I can sit down on and get back up without the use of my hands is 10 cm, isometric split holds for 4x30s, deepest I get down there is 30 cm and adductor flies for high reps, currently at one big set of ~70 reps."

Also, is adductor flies where you lay on your back, opening into a straddle and closing back together?   I find that external hip rotation plays a big role in straddles, probably more than adductor flexibility. For strength, I feel like aerial straddles can really help you as well (things like hanging from a bar and bringing your legs up into a straddle) or holding a dance tilt (only looks easy)."
flexibility,3a7dkb,ReverendBizarre,2,Thu Jun 18 17:04:24 2015 UTC,Pancake straddle ups are simply going into a straddle on the floor and then trying to sit down to the floor or a support. Then moving back up without the use of your hands. I do this for reps and then hold the bottom on the final rep for time.  External hip rotation definitely has a lot to do with straddles and it's only recently that I've started noticing that. The pancake straddle ups help you with that since you kind of force you into it due to the lean forward.  I'll try those aerial straddles on my rings :)

I usually just barely touch it and then go back up and just use it to know how deep I am going.  Eventually, you should be able to do this to the floor with a very wide straddle. I'll try to find a video of that.  Edit: Here's /u/codysunkel doing them (it's the second movement). Another one."

flexibility,3a7dkb,Vincinho,2,Fri Jun 19 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"R/L splits!  There's nothing directly helpful for my gst/calisthenics besides just having more flexible hamstrings/ hip flexors. However I've always seen the splits (F/L/Middle) as the pinnacle of flexibility. I now know that's not very accurate but I still want to pursue those along with thoracic bridging.  Tuck your pelvis to target hip flexors, arch your pelvis to target hamstrings. There are many subtle things that I still often forget such as ""reaching forward"". Basically it helps me to push my back leg backward and my front leg...well...forward. I don't know exactly how it helps technically but it feels like it gives me a bit of wiggle room in my hip sockets compared to when I just sink down.  My favorite R/L split specific exercise is something I saw Cody Sunkel and Justin Goodhart do.   https://instagram.com/p/zfxkRNg8do/?taken-by=codysunkel https://instagram.com/p/3PUN2FEdp8/?taken-by=wrathlete   It's hard but it helps me more than isometric contractions do at the moment, although Iso Stretching was how I started my journey months ago and helped me greatly.

It was weird because I have a pretty good pancake split, butterfly, and a complete pike but never could do right and left splits which drove me crazy. I guess I needed to open up some other part of my hip that I wasn't working before and that 1/2 split business along with the other stretches in this vid made it way more possible.

flexibility,3a7dkb,SunMakerr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:32:34 2015 UTC,"Man that straddle is intense!!  Yea I was never flexible as a kid especially in my lower half. After R/L I'm tackling the straddle because I cant even get to 90° without a bit of work, and there's no way I can do even that without rounding my entire back, which is weird because standing I can get quite farther and can keep an arch in my back when it's parallel to the floor.  I'll look into the video, I've hammered my hip flexors so much that now I think it's my hamstrings holding my back from my next breakthrough. When I get into a lunge my upper legs get to 180° but when I try to stiffen my front those last few degrees I have to come up a bit. I'm also working on good mornings with locked knees focusing on arching as hard as I can to try to replicate the demand on the hamstrings in the splits. I use an empty barbell or less on some days and get a REALLY good stretch.  OH and congrats on your splits!"

I do recall reading one person swearing by pushing between her bed and a wall while laying if her back on the floor. Her reclines split is beautiful now.  Also, I'm seriously impressed with that splits strength exercise. It seems like a really good was to develop strength in that position and also get the muscles tired and go lower."

I think a lot of it is that I've been working on my splits for quite long (on and off ~2 years) and I kinda just want to say I can do it.   However, I do spend the majority of my splits training squaring up as best I can. I like to alternate the two because I find that they both give more ROM to the other. When I do it I either just use ""reaching"" as a cue and don't move at all, or I actually slide a bit, take a few seconds, and then repeat.  The person you mention with the bed is pretty interesting.

I know for certain that hip flexors are the limiting factor in my ability to split, so I'm focusing on them.   As an advanced pole dancer, many moves involve some kind split variation, and not having my splits really holds me back from achieving a lot of cool stuff. Not to mention flexible hip flexors play a role in backbending, which is another part of my training I'm working towards.  I've learned that I did lunges wrong for way too long. I would let my hips tilt forward and just feel stuck, without any stretch. Proper hip flexor stretching lunge consist of engaging the core, tucking the tailbone under, creating space in the hip by lengthening up, keeping the hips as square as possible and engaging the hamstring/glute muscles. Now I definitely feel my hip flexors when I lunge!  My friend is a flexibility instructor and has hip flexor flexibility is to die for (she does a low lunge with her thigh completely on the floor). She swears by this one exercise: Get into a high lunge, but with the front leg further forward, so that the foot is ahead of the knee. Stack the torso over the hips, and arms over head, back knee straight. Pulse up and down very slowly with control and keep everything engaged to hold yourself up there without assistance.

Then he goes on to write this:   If you’d asked me before this experiment how much experience I had with stretching, I probably would have said, “Lots!” And that would have been true … in some ways. But the inspiration for the project was my red-faced insight that I have never actually stretched with enough dogged consistency and uncomfortable intensity to claim to really know how it affects me. For a prominent stretching skeptic, that’s a little uncomfortable to realize. I had to put it right.  The goal here was to be disciplined enough to remove all doubt that I have really tried “hard enough” — certainly quite a bit harder than most other people will ever bother with.

I can't say with certainty that there's more to it than that. Personally, I experience the same benefits to sore muscles from stretching as I do from light exercise (like doing pushups for sore pecs). You'd be better off foam rolling them to help break up any knots.  I would recommend against statically stretching your quads during a squat set because it is known to reduce strength. The only reason you would statically stretch your quads between sets is if you WANT them inhibited because they are taking too much of the load away from your glutes, for example."

Still thanks for the post! Although I'm fairly certain it's a very frequent repost. ;-)  Ultimately, as I understand it, flexibility won't be the limiting factor for some people in developing an ""uncompensated"", no-buttwink deep squat like the overhead one he shows in his post, but rather hip anatomy will be. Some people have what's known as ""Celtic"" hips, very deep hip sockets which limit their ability to squat much below parallel without rounding the back and tilting the pelvis posteriorly (people from Ireland, Scotland, Normandy have a tendency for Celtic hips). On the other end of the spectrum there are people with more shallow hip sockets, which enable them to squat very deeply. There's a reason, which is not only due to cultural resting habits, that the deep squat is often referred to as a slav or asian squat. Not surprisingly many high-performing olympic lifters come from the same regions.  So, while the lunge test is interesting, the cm value given from Kasayama's study might not be all that comparable to non-Japanese people (except maybe other East Asians)."

flexibility,3a4ccp,BruceWinchell,2,Wed Jun 17 03:16:01 2015 UTC,"Stretching cold muscles isn't really a no-no, it's just that your cold flexibility is always less than your warm flexibility. This means simply if you don't warm up prior to a stretching session you might need significantly longer to reach your end range of motion in a cold muscle.  Just do some dynamic stretches before your stretching session for the muscles you're planning to stretch. This will loosen and warm them up and will also help you develop active flexibility, as well as help getting your active flexibility closer to your passive flexibility, which ideally should be pretty close to each other.  Hot baths/showers will loosen your muscles up as well, but won't help you by developing active flex, so why even bother? A little bit of foam rolling/self-massage before dynamic stretching will be helpful too.  Put on tights/thermals (Kit Laughlin even suggests a double layer) to keep the heat in the muscles. 5 minutes of inactivity before muscles cool down is what I have in my head as a value, not sure how ""exact"" that is though. This will, of course, also depend somewhat on ambient temperature."

flexibility,3a46lf,codybear11,3,Wed Jun 17 02:23:19 2015 UTC,"More flexibility ≠ less injury!  Hate to say it, but it's a gross, also simply false, oversimplification to think that increased range of motion (ROM) will prevent injuries. The relationship between flexibility and injury unfortunately isn't that clear-cut. Now hypomobility (compromised flexibility) obviously isn't ideal, but the ""surplus"" of flexibility/ROM that's desirable for anyone is generally activity specific. Common rule of thumb is that you should aim for just a little bit more, as a sort of buffer, than what is required by your athletic (or daily life) activity. If you're a runner for example, you might not even want to develop too much hamstring flexibility, because hammies that become too lax will be compromised in their springiness and in turn compromise your running performance. It's obviously a different picture for gymnasts, dancers, yogis, martial artists etc.  Just to be clear, I'm not saying ""don't get flexible"", all I'm trying to say is you should know why. If you feel restricted in certain movements, go ahead and stretch. Evening out gross left/right flexibility imbalances might also be desirable. If you desire to achieve certain poses, like splits or whatever, by all means go work on them! If you just simply enjoy to stretch, go stretch! Just be aware that great flexibility won't make you bulletproof. On the contrary too much flexibility might actually set you up for instability and injuries. People with hypermobile joints often suffer from chronic pain in those same joints.  Ultimately, what's going to be more important for general health and injury prevention is to develop good joint stability (ability to stiffen your joints), joint mobility (strength and control in movement through active ROM, which ideally should be close to your passive ROM) and core stability and control (ability to co-contract your abdominal wall throughout all movement to protect the spine). How you develop this is again somewhat activity specific.  I realise this isn't an easy answer, but chances are in a way you're already working on those qualities, if you're doing any kind of sports practice.  If not, simple dynamic joint rotations are a good starting point and also, imho, something that really anyone should be doing as a morning routine for general joint health. Add Stuart McGill's ""big three"" core exercises (curl-up, side bridge, birddog) and some glute activation drills (glute bridge, clam, one-legged squats and hip airplanes) for a good general core stability starting routine."

flexibility,39y4ip,saiuke,4,Mon Jun 15 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  First of all, I want to start off by saying that yoga is awesome because the practice itself develops your flexibility and strength in a balanced well. You do not need to prepare to start yoga, just do it! Yoga alone will make you meet your flexibility goals. It will take you longer to learn and develop a good routine that works for you, while you already have it all in yoga.   But that aside, let's try to answer your questions: 1. There are rare cases where the shape of the hip socket prevent you from going into middle splits, and even rarer cases where side splits are not anatomically possible. It's definitely can't be determined from a frontal standing pic, but until you really start to get a very specific bone on bone pain in your hips, assume you are just inflexible.   There are a few methods to develop leg and back flexibility, but again, yoga covers that. I heartily suggest yoga, if yoga is your goal! Aim to zero injuries please. You should not pull or strain your muscles, even though accidents do happen even to the most careful trainees. You will feel your muscles getting sore, especially in the beginning, but that's not the same as pulled muscles. Sore = worked, pulled = injured. It's very individual and depends how well the stretches work for your body. Toe touching is usually fast (many people got it within the month long challenge we did wat back when), side splits will take months, middle split might be years. Back flexibility may take month or years depending on your body, your goals and how accurate is your training. It won't happen overnight but it gets better little by little."
flexibility,39y4ip,ClockworkMagpie,2,Mon Jun 15 21:39:33 2015 UTC,"My biggest piece of advice is warm up, warm up, WARM UP before you do big poses like scorpion or even splits.   A few random pieces of advice:  When bending at the waist to touch your toes, lead with your collarbones and do not round your back. Don't be afraid to bend your knees.   Your backbends depend heavily on your abdominal muscles for safety. Also, always go up and back, not just straight back or you'll start bending from your low back and that can lead to injury.   No, it's not your body. It's the time you spend. Make sure you hold your stretches for 3-5 breaths minimum. 10 breaths if you can.   You mentioned scorpion so I'll touch on that - strength through your shoulders and forearms is most important in this pose, not the backbend. Before you start trying to touch your toes to your head, make sure you can do forearm stand with your legs/body straight. Your back might be too bendy from the beginning and without the proper foundation, you could hurt yourself.   Hope that helps!  Edit: to your last questions:  I've never pulled a muscle but I have broken a wrist. Don't push your body too far!  Depends on you. With your age and gender, if you practice daily you should see results relatively quickly. Within a couple of months."

Try a similar set up to a banded distraction, but instead of just having the band on the bottom of the shin, place the band in the groove between the foot and leg. You're going to need to use a thin band, ideally a rounded one similar to the cord on a Gray Cook band. Get some real good tension and work the knee over the foot. Best to do it barefoot.  EDIT: /u/anduim posted a video of exactly what I was talking about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xRPSMCF-F4"

flexibility,39unck,ezzypezzy,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:20:09 2015 UTC,Thank you! I have this foam L-shaped block that elevates my foot then I strap my leg to it. This forces my leg straight. I had a hamstring graft for the surgery so keeping the it straight was/is a struggle. I did a lot of forward bends standing and sitting for hamstrings and lunges to work on the hip flexors. At first I was just putting my knee on a higher surface then dropping the hip since I couldn't do lunges. Splits were never my goal. I really just wanted to walk without a limp and get that leg straight. I still can't do both without a lot of stretching before hand but the progress feels great.
flexibility,39thqv,King_Yogert,3,Sun Jun 14 16:56:45 2015 UTC,"What have you been doing that hasn't helped?  Couch stretch and third world squats have helped me with tight hips, although I still have a ways to go.  Shoulder dislocates focusing on externally rotating the shoulders (my focus is arm pits to the ceiling, it helps me externally rotate) and wall angels have helped my shoulders, but again I have much more progress to make.  Anyway, hope that helps."

flexibility,39thqv,JohnTesh,3,Sun Jun 14 19:19:43 2015 UTC,"The thing about the couch stretch is to keep your glute tight on the side you are stretching, and don't let the stretch come from the back. It should come from the hip and quad. Also, never stretch into pain. When I started the couch stretch, I couldn't if get my chest up and had to stay on the floor on my elbows.

flexibility,39qjmm,Iluminari,16,Sat Jun 13 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"Well guess what? You are stretching it in your pike!   Look at the line of your back. It is perpendicular to your legs at the hips, and then goes into this deep forward curve in your mid back. That's how you find yourself touching your toes, your back takes a big role in your ability to reach forward.  The more you stick out your butt and make the lower back more horizontal, the more the stretch will go out of your lower back and into your hamstrings.  Try to keep your back super straight when going forward, look forward to the wall and think chest/throat to legs, not forehead. Doesn't metter if you don't reach your toes, as long as you keep the back straight and stick the butt out and feel it in your hamstrings, then you're all good."
flexibility,39qjmm,ClockworkMagpie,2,Sat Jun 13 21:07:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! Just out of curiosity, is it bad for me the way i'm doing it, like am I going to hurt myself?

flexibility,39qjmm,ClockworkMagpie,3,Sat Jun 13 21:13:39 2015 UTC,"For hamstrings stretches you should definitely avoid this, because you just cheat yourself and stretch the wrong part.   Even if you want to dub into front bending, you still want to get that bend at the hip first, and then get the back do the rest of the bending.   Rounding forward at the back is a common compensation beginners do because the mid/upper back allows it and you try to reach as for forward at all costs. It gets easier as you gain more hamstrings flexibility, but I think that concentrating the stretch in the hamstrings from the start can get you to that comfortable level sooner.  It's the same with pancake, but for squats I'm not sure. All I know you should not be rounding there..."

flexibility,39qjmm,ClockworkMagpie,2,Sat Jun 13 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"I just realized it's not a pike, just one leg forward. In that case OP probably leans to that legs slightly as it is kind of easier than getting both shoulders at the same level as the lower one. Not a big deal though, once you get one elbow to the floor you'll have to correct to put the other one down."

flexibility,39qjmm,avantar112,2,Sat Jun 13 21:13:58 2015 UTC,"Rounding your back like that involves lengthening muscles. IMO this stretch (janu sirasana) is a fanastic stretch for the side of the lower back. Having said that it looks like your lower back and hamstrings are tight enough that your mid back is rounding, which I'm not a huge fan of (it's already probably too good at that).  As /u/ClockworkMagpie said, if you want to stretch your hamstring keep your back straight and imagine you're sit bone is moving backwards. Think about getting your stomach to your thigh, not your hands to your toes."

flexibility,39qwqf,SupriseGinger,3,Sat Jun 13 21:52:57 2015 UTC,"Didn't look for research to back it up but here's the bits and pieces I gathered from my instructors and professionals along the way.  30 seconds is the minimum time to be in a stretch for most stretches. Different muscles react differently and some require more time to pass the initial tension. If you can up it to a minute it will likely have more effect.  Doing sets is a very good idea. It gives the body time to get used to the stretch and adapt to it. The second and third set will definitely feel better than the first one. Also, muscle love movement and it calm them down, so even the getting out and back it probably helps the stretch.   You'd have to go by how it feels and how much time you can devote. Some stretches will not feel like staying in them over minutes or doing one more set helps them, some will. Try to catch the sense of progress and ride on it as much as you can, because it's hard to come by in flexibility training.  As for stretching throughout the day, I'd suggest only easy limbering movements without pushing it. If you sit a lot, then lightly stretching out your legs and hips will feel nice, but getting into actual stretches and pushing them, not so much. You need a good warmup before performing stretches, which you probably won't do 3-5 times a day. Also, you might be aggravating tight muscles if you don't let them rest and heal and keep bugging them. Sometimes a rest day is the best stretching routine you could do."

What else did she change alongside taking magnesium, e.g. changes in her diet, hydration level, exercise program, sleep, any reduction of stressors in her life?   Since magnesium is so important for various muscle and nerve functions and a deficiency is possibly linked to muscle cramps, hypertension, decreased physical performance in general etc etc, I'd suspect she simply didn't get enough through her diet itself, which appears to be quite common. If she even really experienced an increase in flexibility caused by a higher magnesium intake that is, and not just a random flexibility ""leap"", changed her stretching program or possible confirmation bias etc. No offense to your friend intended, but people often don't tell even half of a story.  I couldn't find much of substance (there's sure a lot of general internet chatter) about a possible relationship between magnesium and flexibility. Examine.com provides a general overview, but nothing about flexibility. I found one study (which I can't access) in which they tested the influence of a topical magnesium cream on flexibility, results were negative though.  In short, if you have a deficiency, it might help. But then any deficiency will be a cause of stress, which is generally detrimental to flexibility and strength gains. I highly doubt that it will have an effect on non-deficient people, but ""superloading"" magnesium seems to be quite safe, so might not hurt to try?"

Point the toes of your bottom foot about 45 degrees toward the wall and keep your other foot parallel to the ground like you would in your kick. Keep your leg locked and swing it as high as you can.  Rant about static stretching: Just about everything you read will tell you to avoid bouncing while stretching. That bit of information is based on the fact that sports can cause injury. You shouldn't be any more worried about it than you would kicking that high in the first place.  The problem with static stretching is that the stretch reflex that tightens your muscles to keep you from kicking too high are speed sensitive as well as position sensitive. You might be able to do the splits, but add the element of speed to the position and your nervous system starts freaking out again. Further, most static stretching relies on an outside force to keep your leg in position which means your muscles might simply not be strong enough in those extreme ranges to get your leg where you want it. Doing the stretch ballistically strengthens the muscles you need to get to that range in the first place in addition to conditioning your nervous system to relax the opposing muscles when you're kicking.  For the record, I have been a martial artist for over 20 years, have never been injured by stretching like this, and have kicked myself in the head more than once."

Do 3-5 sets of 30 seconds on each leg.   Between each set, do another drill using the wall/bar. Keep holding on in the same position and bring your leg up in round or side kick position. Kick and chamber back your leg. Make sure to keep your shoulders back and hip straight and keep your free hand in fighting stance position (fist infront of your chest). Do 3-5 sets of 10 between the stretching drill above.  If you can do more sets, hold for more than 30 seconds, or kick more than 10 times per set, go ahead! What i suggested is just standard for my beginner students or those who are not so flexible. As long as you keep consistant you can keep doing this much everyday without over exerting yourself every practice. It will take time, so be presistant and patient! Perseverence pays off in the end.  Sorry for any grammar errors by the way. English is not my native language :D."
flexibility,39djzp,queensbrin,2,Thu Jun 11 01:14:33 2015 UTC,"It harder because it doesn't bend backwards on it's own. You need to learn to engage muscles to open your chest and bend at the upper back. It's not easy and I'm still figuring it out myself.  I do suggest you to take it easy with your lower back. It will get flexible anyway when you practice back bending, but you should really focus on distributing the pressure evenly and not crunching the lower back. Try to do more upper back and  shoulder stretches, and actively take the bend out of the lower back up."

flexibility,397f0i,probably_dead,9,Tue Jun 9 20:12:05 2015 UTC,"No.  Is there an ultimate strength training routine? Is there an ultimate music playing routine? Of course not because a) response is highly individual and b) your goals matter.    Time is no issue, I can stretch for hours if it hits everything.   More stretching is not necessarily better! It's easy to go past your body's limits, tear tissue, and make your neuromuscular system even more protective. Consistency and self-exploration will trump spending hours a day stretching for a couple weeks then getting bored.   Also, keep in mind that your goal is to improve your mobility (passive range of motion + active control), not to ""stretch"". Passive static stretching is just one method. Your ""stretching"" can be passive or active; static, dynamic, or ballistic; you can develop mobility that you have cold, or you can develop mobility that you need to warm up to have; you can come deeper into positions with partner assistance, or with neurological tricks (e.g. reciprocal inhibition and the golgi tendon reflex arc); you can focus on just strengthening your muscles at the end of their ROM (you have literally 0 strength at and past your end range now); or you can transform your body just by learning to breathe and relax (almost all of the tightness/lack of flexibility in your body right now is caused by involuntary muscular contraction by your nervous system. Your muscles aren't tight, you are.)  Some suggestions:   accept that fundamentally changing your body may take a while.  take some yoga classes (in a studio). Talk to the teacher, explain at the start that you'll need some more help. Yoga has a great variety of movements, teaches you to breath, and as a beginner live feedback is immensely valuable. learn more about mobility. Listen to this podcast with Kit Laughlin and this one with Andreo Spina. There's tons of other material online. Stretching Scientifically is old, but good.  pick a goal and apply more effort to that. My original goal was to be able to sit comfortably on the floor (cross legged, with legs out straight, in a squat). Saying I want to be more flexible everywhere, is a hard goal to measure let alone achieve.   Note:   injured myself before due to my inflexibility   The reason is probably just as much that you're weak and have poor body awareness. Strong muscles don't get injured easily, and if you load your body/joints in an unstable position you're going to get hurt."
flexibility,397f0i,orealy,2,Tue Jun 9 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have clarified a bit. I don't mean to stretch farther or for longer, just stretching more different muscles like all the ones in my hands, feet, neck, upper back, lower back, sides, etc more completely. As I understand it from some limited research, there are multiple ways to stretch many areas. Then again, what do I know.   I'll definitely check those links out. I'm not looking for a shortcut to flexibility, quite the opposite. I was hoping for a routine or what have you that hit every single muscle. Something that takes so long because it's thorough.

It's short enough that I can talk myself into doing it when I don't feel motivated. Afterwards I feel as if I just had a great 10 minute back massage.  Over the course of a few weeks it has improved my standing and sitting postures.   Take it slow and listen to your body. If you cannot maintain good form don't try to force yourself through it.

Self-palpation can be very helpful to develop the necessary proprioception. Start by just standing relaxed, put your hands on your hips, then simply tilt your pelvis forwards and backwards repeatedly and just feel that movement with your hands.  Then do a standing pike or straddle stretch and guide yourself with your hands. Put one hand on your lower back and make sure it stays extended/straight as you lower down. Push your hips back and engage your quads while you lower down. Once you've reached your endpoint, take both hands to pull your bum up (rotate your pelvis more forwardly), so that you end up a little bit deeper in the stretch."

flexibility,38rgyu,omglollerskates,2,Sat Jun 6 13:15:33 2015 UTC,"I started with that video with no prior experience with Foundation Training. With proper form, it is quite intense especially if you have the sort of muscle weaknesses that cause poor posture. I doubt you would hurt yourself though. Utilize a mirror for form check and if you feel it's too much, they have beginner versions on their channel."
flexibility,38rgyu,iamdamon,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:18:08 2015 UTC,started it without any other special video. It's intense and gets me sweating but I think as long as you focus on your form--don't round your back--you wouldn't have much chance of hurting yourself.
flexibility,38rgyu,ClockworkMagpie,4,Tue Jun 9 00:51:06 2015 UTC,"Tip number one - don't give up. For the longest time it felt like I could not move my hips at all in the pancake. I'm not inches from the floor and definitely hinging at the hips. Whenever you are, if you maintain good form (straight lower back, straight legs) and feel that stretch, you are taking steps in the right direction. It's a long journey and its hard to feel like you progress, so it might be disheartening now, but you'll get there!  Pike and pancake stretch a slightly different set of muscles, and they are not very comparable even though the technique seems to be the same at first. I like the suggestion you got here to do them both standing. Let gravity help you! Shift your weight forward to your toes and when you lower your torso do a swan dive.   For the seated versions keep your entire back straight, chest lifted, looking forward and lower as if you want to touch your throat to the legs/floor. Looking down makes your body want to round down, looking forward will make it want to extend towards the toes.  In every variation of each pose, once you feel comfortable with it you can try to remove the support of your hands, hold them cross on chest, or for more challenge extended above your head. It will add additional weight that will help you go further.  In the pike, you can play with the hip hinge by trying to stick the butt out and back. You'll feel it immediately in the hamstrings, which is great because it means that you took the stretch away from the lower back. For a pancake, you can tilt your hips back and forth while sitting up in a straddle (not as easy as it sound, mine were cemented for the longest time)."
flexibility,38rgyu,monsunland,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:42:58 2015 UTC,"Please show me a picture of someone in a pike, chest to knees, without bending at he lumbar spine.  I believe that's anatomically impossible. At some point, to maintain lumbar extension while being forward, the hips must be adducted and externally rotated, because the trochanter will impede movement. All good pikes are bent at the back moderately.  This illustrates why a pancake is so important for back health. Without he hip mobility to pancake, the spine is destined to overload at some point during activity. This may result in accute or overuse injury.  MobilityWOD did a splits episode where he talked about how 'if everyone could do the splits, we'd see a lot fewer back problems'."
flexibility,38rgyu,GoGoGoemon,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"Sure, in the final pike position the spine will be flexed, but ideally you'd want as much flexibility as possible coming from the hammies and hips and not let the lumbar spine take up their slack. For all we know the lower back thrives on stability and not so much on mobility. You need to learn how to tilt the pelvis as much forward as possible for pike and pancake anyway, also hip hinging is such a beneficial movement pattern especially under load.  I don't understand your other points, but am curious. Can you explain them a bit more detailed? Why would pancake mobility avoid spinal injury? I don't get the (front?) splits idea either?"
flexibility,38rgyu,monsunland,1 point,Sun Jun 7 11:17:48 2015 UTC,"Being able to pancake helps avoid spinal injury because the pancake position is the only (or the closest) way one can maintain neutral spine position while folded forward.   Without the hip mobility to adduct and externally rotate enough to pancake, the back will be placed under greater load during many movements that involve flexion of the hips. Starrett would likely agree, as he delves into why hip mobility is so important for squats.   Simple actions like hiking ones legs over a motorcycle to get on, climbing over a fence, climbing tall stairs, etc. all benefit from the ability to bring the tibia and fibia as high as possible without bending ones back to do so.   Another example: sit with your legs straight out in front of you, piked, but with your torso upright, on the floor. Try watching TV like that. See how long you last before you feel fatigued somewhere in your back.  Now sit cross legged (which involves external rotation and adduction and necessitates mobility in the adductors, piriformis, external hamstrings). Unless you are very inflexible and begin to feel pain in your knees, you will notice that you can sit longer cross legged than in the upright pike position.   This demonstrates what I mean. Even putting on a pair of shorts or pants while standing necessitates the ability to bring the leg up towards the torso. People who are inflexible in the hips will instead work from there they have more natural mobility, thus bringing their torso down towards their leg.   The problem with this is that the muscles of the back, namely the levator spinae, are not nearly as strong as the muscles of the hips. The pelvic girdle is multitudes of times more stable than the spine, most especially when under load."

flexibility,38hn56,olverine,3,Thu Jun 4 07:25:27 2015 UTC,"Whatever helps you focus on external rotation of the hips. It probably depends on anatomy but for me, thinking about tweaks to my program that helped me achieve better external rotation of my femurs is what helped me get started on my journey to side splits.   This, I believe though I could be wrong, is because the priformis was a limiting factor. Lots of people think that side splits is all about adductors but the piriformis is important too. Because without external rotation, the trochanter impinges with the illium/(acetabulum?).   Disclaimer: My anatomy knowledge is limited and I could be off base here.   EDIT: This thread from Kit's forums talks about the importance of pairing piriformis and adductor stretching. Again, most people think that the splits is all just about pulling the legs apart, but external rotation is also a big part of the equation.   Quoting Kit from the above link:   Solution? Turnout. Come up a bit from that excellent position, and externally rotate both legs and feet until the toes point (ideally) slightly behind the leg, then lower once more. Now it will be felt in the hamstrings as well, and no strain on the knee. Once my legs are 'turned out', I get at least 3-4"" lower. It's all to do with the structure go the hip joint itself. There's more, but that's enough for now.    Thomas Kurtz also talks about the importance of anterior pelvic tilt when doing sides."

Because without external rotation, the trochanter impinges with the illium/(acetabulum?).   I was going to mention that you can also achieve this with an anterior pelvic tilt - as this is more or less the same as externally rotating the femur, relative to the pelvis.  But then I seen you covered it at the end. Good post.   Thomas Kurtz also talks about the importance of anterior pelvic tilt when doing sides."
flexibility,38hn56,Mellor88,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:57:03 2015 UTC,Would you mind explaining this in more of layman's terms?
flexibility,38hn56,queensbrin,3,Thu Jun 4 16:11:17 2015 UTC,"For many people (like me) hip anatomy will be problematic in that part of the thigh bone will jam into the hip bone once their straddle gets wider, to prevent this they have to either tilt the pelvis forward or rotate the thigh outward (~ feet pointing up). If you experience pain somewhere in the outside hip or upper thigh region while straddling, then this is likely true for you as well.   Kurz, luckily, has an article explaining this in detail with a couple illustrations, which are probably more helpful than words.   To sum it all up, you cannot do the side split without either rotating your thighs outward or tilting the pelvis forward. The outward rotation or the forward tilt (hip flexion) unwinds capsular ligaments of the hip, among them the pubofemoral ligament, which resists excessive abduction. Spreading the legs without these additional movements twists and tightens the ligaments of the hip and pushes up the neck of the femur into the cartilage collar at the upper edge of the hip socket. For persons who have coxa vara (less than 135° angle between the neck and shaft of the femur), abducting the thigh without tilting the pelvis jams the greater trochanter against the hipbone above the acetabulum (hip joint cavity).  This jamming of either the neck of the femur into the cartilage or of greater trochanters against hip bones is the cause of pain and of a limit to the sideways movement in both the side split and the raising side kick."

flexibility,38hn56,monsunland,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:17:45 2015 UTC,"To me, sitting down and pressing my legs against a wall (or a coffee table in your case, I personally prefer a wall) gives me 100% control on the intensity of the stretch. I was push forward until I feel a good stretch and not a cm closer.  Also, (since my middles suck and I'm not close enough to the wall) I can still do other stretching while I sit there. Lean towards each leg, do lateral stretches, slide my hands up the wall to add back and shoulder curve, tilt hips back and forth and generally play around.  Standing and sliding down while keeping your torso horizontal to the floor gives you the same stretch, but you don't have as much control over the intensity. It could be a good thing because gravity can push you lower than you'd push yourself. It could be a bad thing, because it can make your body panic and tense up. I also find it harder to come out of it, because I can't just slide up easily and going forward actually intensifies the stretch.  There's also a standing knees up variation, in which you slide down from standing, but keep your torso vertical (hold onto sometimes high), turn out the legs and slide them to your sides. It's a different stretch but the end goal will be the same. It works more on external rotation, which might (or might not) be easier to develop."

flexibility,38hn56,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:14:20 2015 UTC,"When you do the coffee table version you start with the legs in front of you and open them out to the side. Your legs are perpendicular to your body throughout the entire way to the split.  With the knees up variation, you start standing, legs continuing the body, and then opening them out to the sides until they are perpendicular to it.  The different leg paths use different muscles to flex/extend, so you might be closer to middles using one way than the other."

But it stalled there. At stayed at that point for about 2 months, some days I wouldn't even get that far. Then I switched to loaded progressive stretching. 3 days a week (day 1 on rings, day 2+3 standing). I still do splits on the floor facing a wall on day 1, purely to gauge progress.

But I don't like the pressure on my heels, although this version puts less stress on the knees."

Ran a marathon and after that couldn't bend over to tie my shoes without pain or extreme discomfort in my upper inner thighs. Couldn't do any resistance against my adductors without pain. Did a TON of PT and saw some sports docs.. eventually saw a surgeon who diagnosed me with a sports hernia. Ended up getting Adductor Longus tenotomy on both legs. That pain went away but my inner thighs are WEAK. All the PT after the surgery really hasn't helped me build strength and slight things can even give me somewhat of a charlie horse.  Honestly, if you are SERIOUS about running, and want to get this properly diagnosed, contact dr brown in California. www.sportshernia.com  Even if it isn't a SH he should be able to tell you what is going on.  Do not run with this pain, it will only exacerbate the issue. If you want to try home PT stuff first PM me. I will give you all of the stretches and exercises given to me.

In norway we are wasting time on 4 languages, music classes, religion classes over several years that basicly covers the exact same thing over and over again.   Learning about maintaining good posture wouldn't be so bad. I also went to udemy and took the superlearner cource. I think every human that reads often should take that cource.   Anyways its a long way to go before anything like that will happen. My mother had back pain for 10 years. Doctors, chiropractors, physiotherapist were unable to fix it. I fixed it with a youtube video about backpain. Turns out they never thought about her tight hip flexors,her weak core or immobily thoracic spine. So basicly a plank a lunge stretch and a t-spine mobilisation drill helped more than they could in 10 years.   1 year ago I went in to the doctor becouse of rib flare. He looked, but ended up overlooking my hyperextended back. He ended up saying that it is completely normal. YES ITS NORMAL BECOUSE EVERYONE SITS ALL DAY. HOWEVER IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY.

Also Planks are the Magic Bullet for Hip Mobility seems to be up the same alley.  I have seen mentions of improper core control affecting shoulder mobility, but I haven't looked into it seriously yet.   Another related point that involves back bending is lack of proper lower abs engagement that makes hip flexors to be constantly tightened up. Even though tt won't directly prevent you from being able to backbend, it can possibly make you use your lower back more than you should and put more pressure on it."
flexibility,389ifz,GoGoGoemon,3,Wed Jun 3 20:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstood that video a little bit. In her case it's a movement problem in certain drills like the pike, due to a lack of core control and therefore lower back stability. That lack causes an ""up-regulation"" of the hamstrings as an overactive protection reflex to prevent (even more) excessive hyperextending of the lower back, in short the hammies are permanently switched on and already lengthened almost at max.   What Dave did is momentarily restore spinal stability with those core drills (and myofascial work etc, he mentions that in the article), so that the little one could finally display the hamstring flexibility she already had! Like he says in the beginning of the vid and in the earlier article he linked to, this is a problem that will likely affect people that lean more to the hypermobile side, which often comes with a lack of joint stability.  So, in short this isn't an approach to flexibility, it's a solution for a movement or joint stability problem. Not trying to be nit-picky here, but I think this is an important differentiation. Core control/spinal stability is, however, something that is of course important to all of us."

flexibility,384lg6,bruneo,4,Tue Jun 2 04:39:59 2015 UTC,"The problem is that's going to be highly individual and also sport specific to a degree.  At a very basic level you'll have to work on abdominal co-contraction (or ""bracing"") and spinal stability. For example McGill uses, very successfully, different progressions of his ""big three"" exercises: his curl-up, side bridges and birddog. I know that the Hybrid Perspective guys use a similar protocol in their wam-ups (not sure about McGill's curl-up, but side bridges and cross crawls/birddogs are a staple of theirs). This then includes breathing drills while co-contracting.  All of this (keeping a neutral spine while co-contracting) is then applied to many different movement patterns, and this is where it gets fuzzy and specific, e.g from different squatting and lunging patterns to one-legged squat variations, star exercises, All kinds of balancing exercises on labile surfaces, unilateral work (dumbbell carries, cable chops, archer push-ups, one-arm rows etc etc), overhead work, often while being prodded or tapped by someone to expose weak links in your abdominal corset/canister. Dave has a lengthy article with lots of, only somewhat, gymnastic specific ideas how to include this, which is actually pretty similar to McGill's excellent, but complicated, approach in Lower Back Fitness and Performance."

Go through your whole body from head to toe (or vice versa) in all directions for at least 10+ rotations. Do lots and lots more on those joints that give you trouble.

flexibility,382vsz,Quaker0ats,3,Mon Jun 1 13:38:16 2015 UTC,"So this pose exists in yoga and is called Lord of the Dance. The easier variation which you can probably do already is with the 'regular grip' where you grip the ankle from outside (or inside) and kick into the leg to rise up. I highly suggest to ask your instructor or look up in reliable yoga resources on the internet for technical pointers (should the hips be square or turned out, should the bottom knee be locked out or not etc).  As you are getting comfortable with this pose, you need to learn to flip the grip (ie grab the foot reaching the arm over your head and not to the side). This requires much more flexibility then the 'regular' grip in your shoulders and upper back. You can work on it from more grounded poses like Pigeon Pose (aka the King Pigeon Pose). Some hints here.  You can also use a strip if you can't grip the grip yet, and need to work on that overhead grip flexibility in the pose. Tie it around the ankle, and instead of grabbing the foot, grab the strap and practice the same motion of bringing the hand to your shoulder and the elbow around in front and then up over your head with the strapped leg and hold it there. Little by little that distance from your hand to the foot will shorten until you wouldn't need it anymore.  Once you can grab the foot and flip the grip, you can progress towards Needle Scale. The end pose is very advanced and involves high degree of back flexibility, splits and shoulder flexibility. And it's amazing."

flexibility,37r04f,GoGoGoemon,7,Fri May 29 18:20:52 2015 UTC,"Picture of the MRI is a screenshot I took from a mini documentary about snake woman 'Zlata'. Here is her going into the MRI scanner.  Short blogpost about her with a couple pictures, not very informative but it's the least annoying one I could find. I find her website quite annoying too and aesthetically displeasing as well, but there are some interesting pictures in the archive section to be found, although to be honest they all look suspiciously like cover shoots for an old-school porn magazine. Not surprisingly you'd have to pay to get to the full picture sets..  I got curious, searched a bit around and found two papers on the same whole-spine MRI study done on a group of contortionists, the papers don't differ that much:   first paper (behind paywall)  second paper (pdf warning; freely accessible)   The study was done on five female contortionists from a Mongolian circus school, between 20 and 49 years of age. Not so surprisingly they found multiple different spinal injuries (disc degeneration, disc bulges, osteophytes, limbus fractures) in all of them.  Interestingly, all five showed a ""straightening of normal cervical lordosis"" and a curvature of the spine to the right (dextroscoliosis) ""and reported that they preferred to deviate slightly to the right when moving into or out of extreme spinal contortion positions. It is not clear whether this is a congenital anatomical deviation, or a motor pattern that evolves into an anatomical deviation."" (All five are right-handed btw)  ""On the basis of our comparison of the vertebral angles achieved during flexion and extension, we speculate that the greatest risk of injury to the spine appears to be during extreme extension. During contortion training and performance, the artists are in continuous transition from one extreme posture to another, with each fully contorted position sustained only briefly, if at all. To hold the extreme position for more than a moment in the MR imaging scanner was unusual for them and not typical of their routine, hence the need for the use of rapid dynamic imaging.""  All quotes in brackets were from paper one, the following are from paper two:   The mechanism of limbus fractures is uncertain. They may result from a back injury, but in many cases, there is no trauma but a history of shearing and stress. The anterior limbus fractures encountered in these contortionists are likely related to hyperextension. One possibility is that when these contortionists hyperextend, the limbus fractures. There appears to be very little stress on the spinal column  during flexion, with most of the flexion occurring at the hips (more than 180°) and with the contortionists able to hyperflex for long periods comfortably.   However, they can only maintain hyperextension for a few minutes and experience back pain when holding the hyperextended positions for a longer period. Thus, it appears that the major stress on the spine occurs during hyperextension in these remarkable individuals. Since this study, the troupe has altered its training regimen and other exercises to minimize these types of injuries.   Finally, obligatory mentioning of hybridperspective's article on safer bridging, since these researchers suspect hyperextension to be the main culprit in the contortionist's spinal injuries: Bridge Mobility: Why Your Gymnasts May Be Struggling: Possible Injury Prevention For The Lower Back and Tips To Help"

In any case, it would probably be harder to do than you think since your muscles would get very sore. There is no point in stretching that long if you do not already stretch a lot. You are much better off stretching for 20 minutes or something every day."

flexibility,37ns96,FluentInTypo,2,Sun May 31 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"Dont assume its just your hammies. Toe touch flexibility requires proper form and proper form require you knees to be slightly bent, so your calf muscles are also stretching and weight-bareing. That and you should not be bending at your hips, but rather sliding your ass backwards and UP as you reach for your toes. If your hip flexors are tight, your quadraceps not engaged (contracting) this will not be happening. If that is not happening, your hammies could be in a constant state of being slightly over-strecthed even though that seems totally the opposite of how it feels and what you think is happening. Maybe someone could link this guy to the toe touch /ankle pivot excerices? They really help with knocking the body back  into proper form."

flexibility,37ns96,georgie_Fruit,2,Sun May 31 16:43:04 2015 UTC,"Make sure you're not completely locking out your knees in those straight leg poses. Most yoga poses, like forward fold, are done with straight, but not locked out/hyperextended, knees.   If you're doing these poses with locked out knees, then you'll experience some pain radiating from the back of the knee out into your upper calf/lower hamstring."

flexibility,37ns96,georgie_Fruit,3,Fri May 29 03:19:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know if the root cause of your pain is hamstring tightness, but stretching your hamstrings with bent knees is absolutely fine. I find that working with bent knees can allow you to open up your hips more and get greater glute activation, which is great for your hamstrings.   While you might have tight hamstrings, it's also possible that you could actually be overstretching your hamstrings in an attempt to overcome tightness in your hips/glutes."
flexibility,37ns96,ClockworkMagpie,2,Fri May 29 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"Why the glutes need to be activated in a hamstring stretch? They are part of the chain of muscles that stretches in forward bends. I'm not undermining your comment, just asking in case I overlooked anything about the glutes.  Also, and I know it's still a topic of controversy in the sub but I'm an avid protester against stretching hamstrings with bent knees. Straightening the knees completely requires serious quad activation, which in turn strengthen the muscles around the knee and helps you prevent stretch related knee injuries. Moreover, in stretches for pancake and middle splits it's essential to engage the knees in order to protect them. Last but not least, if your discipline entails poses with straight legs, then stretching with bent knees develops the bad habit of next straightening them, not to mention you wouldn't have the strength to straighten them. Just putting it out there for OP to see the other side of this coin."
flexibility,37ns96,georgie_Fruit,2,Fri May 29 04:21:20 2015 UTC,"By glute activation, I meant that the stretch should be felt into your glutes, mostly in the hip flexors. Calling it activation was a poor choice of words, since all muscular activation seems to be associated with contraction, not lengthening.   And while I understand your point of view, that there's plenty of benefits to performing straight-leg hamstring stretches, I still think that if proper form can't be done with straight legs then it's better to bend the knees than risk injury due to improper form.   In something like forward fold, if someone has tight hamstrings or hips but tries to bring their chest to the thighs, then the back has to round excessively and the spine will be stressed and at risk of injury if pushed too far. While it'd be nice to straighten the legs, activate the quads, and be able to relax and lengthen the hamstrings fully, it's not worth risking spinal health for. It's a good deal safer to work from from bent-knee folds to straight-leg folds than from rounded-back to straightened."
flexibility,37ns96,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Fri May 29 05:19:47 2015 UTC,"I kind of disagree with that. If you can't be in the end of ROM of your hamstrings without bending at the knees, it means you are not really ready to be there, and you sort of cheat by giving in the knees for those extra inches.   I agree that the back should be straight and everybody has the tendency to round down at the back to go lower. But you will still do it with bent knees, it's not like bending the knees will make you get into better back position. Also, you have to pull pretty damn hard to actually injure your rounded down back. So if you pull this hard with a straight back, it will go into the hamstrings and injure them instead. I just don't think it's probable.  Also, there's no hip flexor stretching in forward folds. Glutes and hip flexors are opposing muscle groups, if one flexes then the other stretches."
flexibility,37ns96,GoGoGoemon,2,Fri May 29 06:04:36 2015 UTC,"To me bent-leg pike and even more so bent-leg pancake stretches have proved to be quite useful. They allow me to focus the stretch higher up on the back of the leg, right at the hamstring-glute insertion or ""underbutt"" (or whatever it's called) area, which is an area I hardly can target otherwise so far. YMMV, of course, depending on where you are in your pike/pancake development. Straight leg versions should be worked as well, of course, to target the hammies in full from both ends so to say.  For example, Kit's ""Underbutt"" (4. E2) stretch works great for me in targeting areas no other stretch does! The equivalent pike version is great too!  By the way, there appears to be a relation between very tight hip flexors and an inhibition in forward bends and hip compression. I don't fully understand it, but I suspect there's some kind of protective tension going on due to a weak abdominal ""corset"" and a resulting lumbar spine in ""peril"" so to say. There is a short, somewhat unsatisfactory, thread on Kit's forum about this phenomenon. I've definitely seen this effect on other people and also experienced it myself, albeit not as strongly as Børge reports in that thread. For me it's on some days the difference of getting 1-2 cm deeper in e.g. a standing pike, but my HF are neither that tight, nor my core that weak."
flexibility,37ns96,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Fri May 29 10:43:30 2015 UTC,"Of course it's a different stretch, the more you bend the legs the more the target area changed. If I take it to the extreme for a moment, imagine a supine hamstring stretch. If you keep that leg straight is all hamstring and glory, but if you bend it to 90 degree you can push the thigh into the body and it turns into this deep squat-ish hip sort of stretch.   I'm not entirely against bending the legs in a pike. It's nice way to play around with the intensity, calm the muscles down with movement, move the stretch from one area to another. But I am against advocating for bent-knees only stretching due to the same bunch of reasons I already mentioned in this thread.  I'm also okay with a specific weird Kit Laughlin stretch which I'm sure targets this very specific thing in your legs. But a good, well formed pike, should be practiced with straight knee drills in my opinion. It also translated to other stretches and ultimately poses we are trying to achieve. Ever seen a standing split with a bent knee and said 'oh it's a well done standing split'? Me neither. These poses entail a straight leg and the way to achieve it is to practice it.   Regrading the hip flexors. I'm definitely not an expert, but imbalances in one part of the body can lead to a weird chain of adjustments that can reflect on strength and flexibility. Hip flexors do this for sure. But I wasn't talking about that, I merely said that a pike does not stretch them."
flexibility,37ns96,GoGoGoemon,1 point,Fri May 29 23:15:26 2015 UTC,"I'm an avid protester against stretching hamstrings with bent knees.   Sorry, I might have misunderstood you there, but you came off there to me as a ""straight-leg purist"", which is imho just as absurd as any ""bent-leg purism"" (no offence intended to either camp). I was just trying to make a case for a middle way, since both kinds of stretches have obviously their unique advantages and complement each other nicely.  I think we mostly agree here. Pike, pancake, (standing, side, front) splits, full bridges and such are all more or less end poses. They all constitute an impressive display of flexibility, but make for inefficient stretches in and of themselves, unless maybe you're closing in to the end position. To a varying degree you are simply better off dissecting their flexibility requirements and focusing the majority of your work on intermittent elements instead, which entails both imo bent-knees and straight.  I think there's also a point to be made in that poses with locked out knees put a lot of strain on people's knees. Pike maybe a little bit less so, but side splits are notoriously hard on the medial knee, no matter if quads are properly engaged or not. In a way you have to build up your tolerance and strength (""straight leg strength"", so to say) anyway, similar to what you have to do with straight arm strength for handstands etc. I see no good reason why you would limit your hamstring and adductor flexibility development because of weak knees. It seems much smarter to me to condition your knees with reasonable amounts of locked-out knee poses and add less strenuous bent-knee poses for more daily/weekly total end-range time (TERT) on top. In many cases once weak knees will be up to snuff long before flexibility will be.  No worries, I understood your point about HF! I was just sharing an interesting tidbit, after all isn't that what we are here for? All my comments are generally meant in the same spirit btw, I don't care much for winning arguments or about being ""right"". I try not to involve any ego into that sorta thing. I just like to deepen my knowledge and sharing perspectives, tidbits that I find interesting or useful."

When I fold, I definitely feel a stretch somewhere in my backside, likely the piriformis."
flexibility,37ns96,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Fri May 29 12:06:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, but if it's choosing between rounding the back or bending the knees to bring chest to thighs, then the latter is the better option.   Ideally you should not compromise form in both the knees and the back. If forgoing one of them brings you closer to your legs, it doesn't mean you get greater hamstring flexibility, it's just that, you used other things to get yourself lower.   True for plenty of people, but pre-existing back injuries seem to be rather common and it should be imperative to not re-inflame those injuries.   See, now this is where you and me disagree. I think it's safe for most people to round down, sometimes even welcomed if you what to just relax and sick deeper. I never read or heard about someone who had troubles with rounding down in a pike, and I've seen routines of certified instructors where they first make you bend forward with straight back and then round down and relax. It's not good form, but it's not unsafe. If a person has abnormal back issues, then they'll need to modify stretches accordingly. Engaging the knees, though, can benefit everybody.   It seems to help, though. Try it. I'm not quite sure why exactly it works, maybe it allows you to more easily engage your abs and straighten the back, but it works.   It works, because when you bend the knees, there's less tension in the hamstrings, which gives you room to turn you hips and stick your butt out more. Which means you were in a place where you didn't have enough flexibility to both straighten the knee and the back at the same time.   When I fold, I definitely feel a stretch somewhere in my backside, likely the piriformis. Piriformis is not a hip flexor. If you feel a stretch in your lower back, it is because you are stretching muscles there in a forward fold. The purpose of straightening the lower back is to isolate the stretch to the hamstrings and keep it out of the lower back."
flexibility,37ns96,FluentInTypo,2,Fri May 29 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"I think it all depends on form. I see people do straight leg toe touch without every sliding there ass out of ""first position"", meaning the just pivot and that doesnt contract the quads at all. You probably already use propoer form, where your ass naturally slides slightly backwards and up while you engage core and quad muscles. It is generally advised that newbies use slightly bent knees as that sort of forces that ass into position as well as force quad activation. Teach them form first so they will do proper straight leg stretches when the time comes. Bent knee also helps identify if you have tight calves as well, which most ""tight hammies"" have, but dont think the have."
flexibility,37ns96,ClockworkMagpie,0,Fri May 29 10:53:37 2015 UTC,"I can't see how bending the knees changes the tilt of your hips. Sure you can be so inflexible that just sitting up straight will be a good stretch to your hamstrings, but if it's that bad, then it's too early to even attempt to fold forwards (not to mention, pushing the backs of the knees down and releasing during the upright sitting can deepen the stretch without compromising form). For the less extreme case, the only explanation I have is that when an inexperienced person tries to bend forward, they don't keep the back straight. So when it's time to correct that, they already used up their available hamstring flexibility on the bend, and they can't stick the butt out without retracting. But when they bend the knees, it becomes more possible because now there's some room to tug from the hip side of the hamstring.  Also, I kind of can't see how it helps identify tight calves. These definitely don't stretch unless you push the knee straight and flex the foot. Bend the knee more and the calf will stretch less."
flexibility,37ns96,FluentInTypo,1 point,Fri May 29 19:50:06 2015 UTC,"This is sort of my point. You probably dont feel the tightness that the extremely inflexible people feel. A straight leg toe touch hardly feels tight to me, but as soon as i bend my knees, i feel the stretch thoughout my legs and glutes and can feel my hips open up and move into a different placement. The bend knee advice is for newbies who have extremely limited flexibilty, similar to how the alternating ankle flex toe touch exercises can make one able to touch there toes within minutes - its not about flexibility, its about reminding the body how to move."
flexibility,37ns96,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Sun May 31 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"It could be the calves actually. Straightening a leg that you bend towards requires flexibility in the hamstring and the calf, and you may feel it rather intensely behind the knee as well, because this is where they intervene into the knee joint, and it's a tight area for many people.  When you bend forward to perform the hamstring leg, engage your knees and straighten them. Do the same stretch pointing your toes and then flexing the foot entirely and pulling all the toes evenly towards you with your hand if you can grab them. It would feel awful at first, but it gets better."

I started dance (primarily ballet) in my late 20s and still did not have the splits when I started. After a lot of commitment to dance I realized I would never look as good as I wanted without that flexibility. Now after two years of dancing and six months of actually really trying to achieve splits (not just stretching half assed in my ballet class like I used to :/ ) I can do a full pancake and right splits, left split is almost there! It takes really working on stretching to achieve it but you can do it! I think that using your flexibility in movement or strength training like dance or yoga helps though to get you there faster, but maybe that's just me."

flexibility,37k84w,Beignet,5,Thu May 28 06:04:20 2015 UTC,"My knowledge is still a bit shaky here, I've been meaning to take a deeper look for curiosity's sake but haven't found the time yet.  From what I understand so far, long duration stretches appear to have more of a fascial character, in that they deform the collagenous connective tissues, tendons and such. They use this in rehab to clear fascial restrictions after surgery for example, usually by mechanically stretching using different devices. This is done at low loads or at a low stretch intensity, since you want to enable the patient to stay in this position comfortably for quite some time (10+ minutes). Now concerning duration for a more fascial stretch, I've seen all kinds of numbers been thrown around in different literature, basically from 5+ minutes at once up to 60 minutes a day of total end-range time (TERT) done in four sessions of 12-15 min.  Just anecdotally, I've been doing some easy seated stretches lately, exactly like you say while watching a movie or reading, for 5-15 minutes. My flexibility hasn't increased significantly (unfortunately I seem to be a slow gainer anyway), but it has already helped me by ""silencing"" some overactive trigger points.   Generally, I don't think you could go wrong with this. I wouldn't even worry too much about ""overstretching"", since it's quite hard to hold an intense stretch for such a prolonged period, but then some people really lack that kind of body intuition. So, simply ease into this mindfully and keep the intensity at a comfortable level.  Also iirc, Kit Laughlin recommends longer fascial stretches once the contract+relax method (~PNF) seems to have reached a sticking point and doesn't yield much progress.   So, in short, I do think (low intensity) long duration stretches have a place in a well-rounded stretching routine."

flexibility,37iaky,bwfnoob,0,Wed May 27 21:01:00 2015 UTC,"Ideally a follow along routine would have examples of a flexible instructor to show you the end goal, and a inflexible student to show you the modification for those who are not there yet.  But even without the student example, it's fairly easy to know what to do. You try to get into that pose like the instructor does, and you stop somewhere on the way due to lack of flexibility. So it's okay not to do the stretches just like the instructor, as long as you feel the stretch where it suppose to be. If you could do all the stretches like the flexible instructor then you wouldn't need the video in the first place.   I went through many YT routines for splits and pretty much all of them contain only stretches for all levels. Unless you chose a tutorial for a needle scale or some other super advanced pose by mistake, you should be able to follow along, doing your best within the boundaries of your flexibility."
flexibility,37huv1,kissbang23,4,Wed May 27 19:18:49 2015 UTC,"In short, you suffer from DOMS! :-)  Basically, microtears in muscle fibers and connective tissue, the very same you get from exercising! Nothing to worry about, unless it doesn't go away soon.   Stretching a muscle is pretty similar to the eccentric lengthening of a muscle you do in your strength work. It's really not uncommon to experience DOMS after intense stretching sessions. You've also done something your body isn't yet accustomed too or hasn't been exposed to in a longer time, which is usually a surefire way to get yourself some nasty DOMS. My own approach to new exercises/stretches therefore, for the first couple times at least, is that ""you can never go too light!"".  By the way, interestingly enough stretching (particularly with weights) can lead to significant hypertrophy as well!"

I wouldn't worry too much about some occasional mild soreness, but overly aggressive stretching can easily cause trigger points (and, of course, injuries on the too aggressive end).   However if it happens and you feel sore, I like to stretch through that, albeit in a very relaxed manner! Just do some very relaxed and gentle dynamic and static stretching the following day."

flexibility,37ahgf,baller_unicorn,11,Tue May 26 04:36:36 2015 UTC,"Just a couple things off the top of my head. Don't overarch your lumbar spine in back bends, instead use mainly your hip and thoracic spine flexibility to get into that position. They had a good article about safe bridge mobility over at Hybridperspective a while back. Generally you don't really want to feel your lower back working in back bends; cramps, a strong stretch sensation, pain of course are all signs that you overextend that area, which is not desirable, since the lower back is ""build"" more for stability and not so much flexibility.  Any good stretch teacher will always have you do gentle counterstreches, especially with spine bending! So, a gentle forward bend after back bends and vice versa.  According to Stu McGill, it's wise to not get into spinal bending first thing in the morning. The intervertebral discs are highly hydrated from lying all night (that's when and how the spine replenishes nutrients and recovers) and that excess fluid puts high compression loads on the spine, so you are at a higher risk of spinal injuries. McGill recommends no heavy spinal work (flexibility or strength) in the first hour after rising. After that spinal fluid levels should have normalised."
flexibility,37ahgf,GoGoGoemon,3,Tue May 26 07:00:27 2015 UTC,"Question and maybe relavent to the OP question: will bridges and back bends gradually ""even out"" the flexibility in your spine without imbalances?  IE:  if lumbar is tighter than thoracic or cervical. What ever the situation may be."

There are also so many daily movement patterns (and for some of us pesky anatomical challenges) you have to somewhat counteract if you desire balance."

flexibility,379k76,becasse,19,Mon May 25 23:55:24 2015 UTC,"Quads are the main issue here, other parts of the hip flexor can also be an issue.  The fix is relatively easy. Every time you're sitting to watch a movie or something, sit in this posture. Put a pillow between your legs and butt, make it a large enough pillow that it will elevate you to the point of no pain in the knees, but not do large that it avoids the stretch sensation entirely. Also if the pillow is super soft and deformable, it will move out of the way and allow you to sink as your quads loosen. Over time, you can change the pillow for smaller ones until you no longer need a pillow (weeks - months time period for most).  Supplement this with your favourite quad stretches and you'll be sweet to go! The trick is making this position part of your daily habit. Try to get at least 15 mins per day sitting like this. Never work through pain, however you will need to spend lots of time in discomfort. If you're unsure if a particular sensation is pain or discomfort, best to be cautious and avoid it, or very carefully and gently explore it for short periods of time. Over time you will get better at telling the difference."

flexibility,3798bi,standardwoman,3,Mon May 25 22:22:24 2015 UTC,"Personally I found that the worst stretch for the pancake...is the pancake.   However I have also found that if I think more of pulling my legs up towards me using a wall, rather than pulling my abdomen to the floor, I have made much more progress.   So, I do this in two ways. I find a low wall, one that I can grab onto the top of, and I lift my feet up (and out of course into a straddle) and either hook my heels onto it somehow or press my toes into the wall.   Then I grab the top of the wall (this would work well at a climbing gym, where you can use the hand holds) and try to straighten my torso. The force of the wall against my legs and the act of straightening my torso I have found helps me maintain better form and get more of a stretch.  I have actually not found a single picture of what I am talking about on the net so I plan to make a tutorial video of this sometime. But the basic idea is like THIS image, except with butt on the ground and feet ABOVE the hips. Lifting up into the position in the image would be something to work towards. In fact, doing the 'climbers splits' like this is my goal, more important to me than the pancake even (it's also a great arm and back workout).  An even more effective version I found of this is using a box, or in my case a bed, moved close to a wall. I straddle sitting on the edge of the bed, toes pressed into the wall, and sink down into the gap between the bed and wall until my butt hist the floor. Then, with my back against the bed and my feet elevated (a key feature of both these approaches...feet must be elevated higher than the hips), i press back into the bed. This gives me leverage to isolate the muscles involved with hip adduction and external rotation.   This may not make much sense. I really need to make a tutorial video about this because it's the ONLY way I have managed to progress. Just sitting on the floor and trying to stretch my torso down to the floor never worked at all for me.   In general, I have found, I make much more progress with apparatus and props. Same with back bend. I work with walls, boxes, furniture, trees, etc. When I try to stretch just on an open, bare floor I always strain myself and never make much progress. Using apparatus helps to isolate and leverage muscles.   EDIT: Another example image would be THIS type of wall split, except if there was something like a climbing hold to grab onto and lift the torso up and towards the wall, while pressing the legs and digging heel into the wall, getting leverage on those adductors(?)."

flexibility,3762qs,kuroiryu146,1 point,Mon May 25 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"Whatever you do just make sure you are not only warm, but have been actively using/working out the muscle group you are stretching that session. Like if you're focusing on legs make sure you do a bit of a jog or some squats beforehand in the gym, not just work on your arms that day. Anyway, being just warm from the sauna may give you a false sense of being warmed up within your muscles and you could injure yourself. The more you move around the better your stretches will be afterward, it's just a plus if your body is also physically warm too. I always stretch either right after a work out, or at night after I have been on my feet but before I get too comfortable. I also agree with ccSmiles that shorter intervals everyday will probably be better for you, as well as give you faster results."

flexibility,36yukj,Ateyx,2,Sat May 23 07:27:12 2015 UTC,"So what I was thinking was, is it possible for the surrounding muscles to maybe be pulling on my forearm muscles, causing stiffness?     Yeah, totally! Your muscles don't live in isolation. Especially when it comes to the elbow flexors, there are many different ones whose functions overlap. I have no idea what is causing your tight brachioradialis (brd), but for me, personally, my right BRD gets tight and I think one reason is because my right elbow doesn't extend all the way.  Anyway, the best way I found to self-massage that muscle specifically (without equipment) is to get on the ground, put my right forearm down on the ground with the palm facing down so the BRD is facing up, and I put my left hand on my right shoulder to help me put my left elbow tip on the right brachioradialis. So basically, the elbow-tip is a great self-massage tool I could use to apply a nice, pinpoint amount of pressure to knead out the muscle. I can even just stay over one spot, and then straighten/bend the left elbow to sublty change the positioning of the elbow-tip. That works, for me, but other than that, I use an ArmAid for overall self-massage of the forearms.  Although, there are other, free ways of self-massaging the forearms as well that I have made a video for as well like this that could help loosen the surrounding structures as well."

I find I get the most results when I stretch when I am very warm, like after class or a cardio session at the gym.  I try to stretch for 20-30 minutes.    I recommend that you pay attention to where/what is limiting your kicks and splits and focus on those areas.  For example, I have relatively inflexible hips, so I spend a lot of time doing hip openers.  I do things like lunges, butterflies, pigeon pose, stacked knees and attitudes on the barre for a good portion of my stretch time.  I also do my hamstrings because they're my second most inflexible area.  I like doing things like down dog, foot on barre, foot in hand, and splits while laying on my back.  I have a timer set for one minute intervals and I hold each position for one minute.  I repeat areas that give me trouble two or three times.  In addition, I find that foam rolling and trigger point release with a tennis/lacrosse ball really helps.  Get back in a ballet class too!  It's fun and a good way to get warm.  Good luck!"

Active isn't is separate kind of stretching. Ballistic is a type of passive stretching.   I mean what is olypic weightlifting if not a ballistic stretch even a loaded ballistic stretch That's not really what ballistic stretch is tbh.   You don't mention dynamic stretching either. Are you blurring the lines between the two.
flexibility,36slki,Mellor88,1 point,Fri May 22 02:42:41 2015 UTC,Who in the world is recommending ballistic stretching?
flexibility,36slki,phrakture,3,Thu May 21 22:27:55 2015 UTC,There are people who do recommend it if you can control the movement. I've seen gains from ballistic stretching and if used properly I cen see the benifit it has in protecting the muscle from injury. My PT had me doing very violent leg swings to reduce my hip and hamstrings reaction to a sudden movement before weightlifting and I saw amazing benifit in my catch in both the clean and snatch. There is room for it in a program if used properly.   I've always had good body control so that is a big factor in having the ability to use ballistic as a method. I mean what is olypic weightlifting if not a ballistic stretch even a loaded ballistic stretch. If you don't prepare your body properly for that sort of sudden force how are you going to keep from injury in that sport. Check out some of Dmitry Klokov's stretch videos. He uses ballistic stretching for a warmup.
flexibility,36slki,phrakture,1 point,Thu May 21 23:20:37 2015 UTC,Which video specifically has klokov using a ballistic stretch?
flexibility,36slki,phrakture,2,Fri May 22 00:08:56 2015 UTC,https://youtu.be/cVVUtV5W85I?t=33s Here he is using momentum to bounce into the stretch more. My understanding of stretching is this is more ballistic instead of dynamic. He is not controlled and gradually increasing the speed of the movement. He is using momentum to get into a range he doesn't have.
flexibility,36slki,GoGoGoemon,1 point,Fri May 22 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd call that ballistic stretching. He's moving in and out of the end ROM and that is fairly controlled - he's not simply letting himself fall.  I'd put that technique closer to the ""prying"" technique that comes from the RKC people.  Ballistic stretches, in my eyes, are more like wushu stretch kicks  Edit: his little squat dance is what I'd call ballistic, though"
flexibility,36slki,phrakture,3,Fri May 22 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"Depends on the definition of ballistic stretching, which is annoyingly quite fuzzy in the literature, especially regarding the not-so-clear distinction to dynamic stretching.  However, the better question to ask would really be who isn't recommending it? Just a couple off the top of my head of those who are in favour of ballistic type stretching, Mel Siff & Verkhoshansky in Supertraining, Michael Alter in Science of Flexibility, Nelson & Kokkonen in Stretching Anatomy, Ido Portal obviously (his Wushu Protocol), Robert Schleip, and, of course, Kit Laughlin and many of the members of his forum."

flexibility,36slki,phrakture,3,Fri May 22 11:29:01 2015 UTC,"Absolutely no typo! Although my phrasing is a bit off there admittedly, sorry!  I know ballistic stretching is kind of a controversial topic, although I'm not quite sure why actually. Most of the literature I've seen so far speaks quite favourable of ballistic stretching, despite the, unsubstantiated,  ""ballistic scare"" that seems to persist on many fitness forums and numerous crappy flexibility wikis."
flexibility,36slki,GoGoGoemon,0,Fri May 22 11:41:36 2015 UTC,Do you have Alter's recommendation available? I know without a doubt that he does not recommend ballistic stretching in Sport Stretch (http://imgur.com/ZqWPEne). I can't believe the book you mentioned is significantly different from his other book.  I also know that both NASM and ACSM bodies do not recommend it in their official manuals of recommendations. Can you provide me with specific references to these recommendations so I can look them up in my copies of these books?
flexibility,36slki,phrakture,3,Fri May 22 11:54:36 2015 UTC,"Sure! Luckily, I've been looking into ballistic stretching lately as a kind of personal side project, so I have actually a bunch of quotes ready at hand. Some quotes might be a bit out of context though, this collection is, for now, really more intended as a reminder for myself of who wrote what, where.  Alter might be one of the more interesting examples. I just wish his work would be a bit more up-to-date! He provides probably the most well balanced perspective, since he explains both, advantages and possible disadvantages, more detailed than most. (You can actually access that part in google preview, p. 157-9). His main concerns seem to be the danger of injury and possible invoking of the stretch reflex, but at the same time he also refutes both in a way:   ""Another point is raised by Shrier and Gossal (2000). They acknowledge that an increased risk of injury can be a concern. However, they add an important caveat for athletes: ""ballistic is more controlled than most athletic activities. Therefore it [ballistic stretching] is likely to be much less dangerous than the sport itself if performed properly and not over aggressively"" (p. 61)"" (Alter: Science of Flexibility. 2004, 3rd Edition, p. 158)  ""Vujnich and Dawson (1994) demonstrated that ballistic stretch after static stretch appears to be twice as effective as static stretch alone in reducing α-motor neurone pool excitability, which correlates with increased flexibility. This research ""contradicts traditional opinion that therapeutically applied rapid stretch results in a reflex contraction of muscle"" (Vujnovich 1995, p. 154)."" (Alter 158)   Some additional tidbits I had jotted down for myself. I particularly like the last bit, why does he give two sources on ""less boring""? Cracks me up!:   ""Ballistic training has been time-tested in various disciplines (e.g. martial arts). Most important, ballistic stretching helps to develop dynamic flexibility. Because most activities and movements are dynamic in nature, ballistic stretching permits specificity in training and warm-up."" (Alter 157)  ""Ballistic training may induce neural adaptations involving reflex responses (Zehr and Sale 1994). For example, Mortimer and webster (1983) found karate-trained (ballistically trained) subjects were able to manifest larger increases in the gain of long-latency mitotic pathways preceding movement, greater limb acceleration, and shorter rise times in initial agonist burst than untrained subjects were. Another possible advantage of ballistic training is the improvement of reflex reactions (Wallin et al. 1985)."" (Alter 157-8)  Finally, ballistic stretching can be less boring than static stretching (Dowsing 1978; Olcott 1980)."" (Alter 158)   Mel Siff & Verkhoshansky in Supertraining (2003, 6th Edition) provide the most precise and possibly best definition, I've seen so far, for ballistic stretching: ""which imposes passive momentum to exceed static ROM on (a) the relaxed or (b) the contracted muscle complex. The ballistic action may be done slowly or rapidly"" (p. 182). Further:   The Use of Ballistic Stretching  All too often, it is stated that ballistic stretching generally is harmful and should be avoided at all costs. This well-meaning, but very misleading, statement makes no distinction between the rates at which ballistic stretching is imposed or the different techniques that may be used in applying it. In fact, most forms of ballistic stretching could quite safely be included within the scope of PNF. If gentle bouncing forms of ballistic stretching are used over a gradually increasing range of movement, they will be seen to be a special type of contract-relax or hold-relax PNF activity and therefore may be applied safely and effectively. One may also alternate static stretches with periodic gentle ballistic stretches to enhance the effectiveness of any stretch and one may even carry out ballistic stretches against the resistance offered by stretched elastic bands to provide yet another variant. One may even apply a principle of progressive gradual stretching increase to increase safely and effectively the speed and range of ballistic stretching right up to the level of plyometric activity. This approach offers some benefits over static and conventional dynamic stretching because ballistic actions are a frequent component of most sports and other forms of stretching usually do not address this specificity of joint action.  Interestingly, Russian research has shown that ballistic stretching, can be most effectively and safely used if it is performed in 3-5 sets of 8-12 repetitions, with the amplitude of movement gradually increasing with each repetition (Matveyev, 1981). No further repetitions should be performed if the range of movement becomes impaired by fatigue, an approach which may be applied with equal validity to all other forms of stretching. (185-6)   Nelson & Kokkonen in Stretching Anatomy (2014, 2nd Edition) don't really go into much detail. Just a tiny paragraph in the beginning and later some recommendations to do certain warm-up stretches either dynamically or ballistically. They also fail to include sources. However, I've included them because one of their studies from 2001 on the effect of ballistic stretching as warm-up on 1RM performance of knee flexion/extension is often cited (e.g. in Kurz's Stretching Scientifically) in order to discredit ballistic stretching. But funny enough, all Nelson & Kokkonen aimed to show with their study is that ballistic stretching and static stretching lead equally to a reduced force output if done directly before strength training.      “Ballistic stretches involve bouncing movements and do not involve holding the stretch for any length of time. Since ballistic stretching can activate the stretch reflex, many people have postulated that ballistic stretching has a greater potential to cause muscle or tendon damage, especially in the tightest muscles. However, this assertion is purely speculative, and no published research supports the claim that ballistic stretching can cause injury.” (25)"
flexibility,36slki,noworriespete,1 point,Fri May 22 14:34:20 2015 UTC,"This helps to answer some of my question. They stated the use of ballistic after static so I can incorporate that order into my routine. It also confirmed my notion from years of athletics. That is all sports have some form of ballistic type stretch that can happen while playing. Even those of greater flexibility, so by incorporating ballistic into training the risk for injury may go down."
flexibility,36slki,phrakture,0,Fri May 22 14:57:30 2015 UTC,"As you've stated before, I think a lot of this is blurring the line between dynamic stretching and ballistic stretching. Like when Alter states ballistic is fine ""if performed properly and not over aggressively"". In my eyes, ballistic stretching is performed aggressively (wushu stretch kicks, for instance), and if you remove that from the equation, you just get dynamic stretching (the wushu kicks become leg swings)."

flexibility,36bb4y,Antranik,5,Mon May 18 02:47:32 2015 UTC,"Between my physical therapy clinic, my gym, and my own collection, I've tried a ton of different foam rollers. I used to like really intense rollers (lacrosse ball, rumble roller), but I've discovered that these can have more potential to aggravate muscle instead of helping. I've since found that using a softer roller, focusing on deep breathing, and really feeling out the progression of relaxation in the muscle is the best way to roll.  I like the grid quite a lot, except that it's much too short. It is good to have a roller long enough that you can lay on it length-wise along your spine. It's great for doing your legs, though, and the size makes it good for travel.  The standard black foam ones are awesome work horses. These are the ones at my PT clinic, and I would strongly recommend them. This is the most versatile foam roller I've tried.  This green j/fit roller is my favorite one. It's softer than the black high-density or the grid, but has more firmness than the white ones. I find it to be the most effective, but it takes a little bit more ""skill."" Rather than just rolling on top of a trigger point and sitting there, you need to slowly approach the trigger point, only rolling forward as the muscle relaxes. This roller accels with this technique because it has more ""give"" to it, while still retaining its shape.  Contrast this with the soft white foam rollers, which have lots of give but lose shape, and therefore aren't really effective. I would not recommend one.  The rumble roller is much too aggressive, imho. Even on my IT band legs. I can more effectively roll out my legs with the green j/fit. I like how intensity feels, but it's just not as effective for actually getting the muscle to relax.  I don't like PVC pipes. It's not that they're too intense for me, it's their slippery surface. Even on a yoga mat or carpet. Having a grippy material against your skin seems to make a foam roller work better—indeed, that's why I like the grid.  One of the very best foam rollers for your glutes and legs is the 7"" orb. Seriously, it's fucking awesome. Great for your chest, back, and shoulders/upper arms, too.  Lacrosse balls are nice. Really intense. Really great for pinpoint precision. Great for your chest. Be careful, though. I hurt my forearm going too intense with one of these. I prefer to use the Orb for what I used to use the lacrosse ball for.  I don't like tennis balls. Too slippery, with too much give."

flexibility,36bb4y,HeyzeusHChrist,1 point,Mon May 18 20:16:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for the clarification. I did mean the muscles that sort of surround the IT band, as noted by a commenter of that article:   [...] Pressure directly into the ITB, with the body completely perpendicular to the roller, isn’t beneficial. I’ve always rolled myself and my clients at that 40 degree angle you mention. I still considered it rolling the ITB but I understood the separation you talk about. Rolling at that angle also addresses the positional dysfunction of the TFL/ITB, which tends to roll anteriorly when too tight.   Good looking out!"

flexibility,36bb4y,shogunofsarcasm,2,Mon May 18 17:49:11 2015 UTC,"I picked up a lacrosse ball ($2.99) and a travel foam roller ($14.99). I have never tried an expensive foam roller. So I don't know if they would feel slightly better. However I will say the travel roller works and that's all I care about. Plus, I like that I can throw it in my gym bag and take it with me.   I really love using the lacrosse ball, best thing I have ever bought. Pretty cheap piece of equipment that you might like to consider. Tons of massages you can do with it. Personal favorite is using it for my glutes. It can be quite uncomfortable (I am downplaying heavily) however it really loosens up my glutes. It's adept at pin pointing and relieving knots. Where as the foam roller excels at more evenly applying pressure across a muscle. These two items compliment each other very well.  Side Note: I feel like a PVC pipe, as has been suggested, really would work just as well. Would also be substantially cheaper. I wish I would have thought of that."
flexibility,36bb4y,cchapp,1 point,Mon May 18 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"That raises a good point, the travel size of roller (6""-12"") is all you really need. Has anyone ran into an exercise that actually needed a longer roller?"

I am 6'2"" and there are some rolls for the inner groin which I am rolling on the edge at either the top or bottom of the movement. So I end up splitting up the movement into half. It was also a little difficult to keep under me at first due to it being shorter. However that is no longer an issue. So those are some drawbacks I have run into. However for me, it fitting in my backpack and not taking up much space outweighs the fixable drawbacks. I might go out and get PVC for longer rollers and keep them at home. I really never thought of using it. Smart and cost effective."

flexibility,369eiq,JohnTesh,2,Sun May 17 19:52:35 2015 UTC,"Something that works for me (but I discovered on accident, I have no video source to share) is a sort of folding half lotus.  Essentially, sit on the floor in a half lotus position. Whichever foot is on top, bend over and try to put the opposite shoulder on top of the knee of the foot on top. Don't force it, stop and let gravity do the work when you feel a stretch. Keep a neutral spine.  So for example, if in half lotus, your right foot is on top of your left knee, you would bring your left shoulder towards your right knee. As you breathe in and out, you should feel gravity working and giving you more range of motion.  Doing about 30 seconds on each side 3-5 times usually wow minutes back pain for me. Worst case it takes 2-3 days of doing this stretch, but normally this works it out by the next day for me.  Also, anyone with expertise, please jump in if this is terrible advice.

The problem with recommending yoga to an inflexible person is that it can be incredibly demotivating to go to a yoga class and not be able to do even the most basic poses.   I know this, because I am actually the most inflexible person ever, not /u/rotmgplaya1. (Or I was. I think I'm the fifth most inflexible person in the world now.) (Need to check the standings.)  Everyone, and I mean everyone just said, ""Try yoga"" when I mentioned my inflexibility. I just got nothing out of these classes because I couldn't come close to doing them. My inflexibility caused tremendous pain (physical and emotional.) I couldn't surf anymore, because I couldn't spread my legs far enough to straddle the board. I couldn't ride a motorcycle anymore. It hurt to walk. It hurt to SLEEP.   I finally saw a sports chiropractor, who showed me that genetically tight hips, combined with weak glutes and lower back muscles had actually caused my hips to rotate slightly. Stretching was actually only PART of what I've had to do to rehab. I do a ton of muscle activation and strengthening exercises and some light daily stretching. I also attend, twice a week, a ""yoga therapeutics"" class. (Really just stretching, but in a nice, supportive yoga environment.)  It's slowly (SLOWLY) starting to reap dividends. I expect that it will take six months to a year to achieve ""normal"" flexibility.  Anyway, sorry for the book, but for me, being told ""Try yoga"" was like spraining my ankle and being told ""Try running marathons."""

I can't touch my toes (forget the sit & reach), can't cross my leg over the opposite knee, my heels raise when I squat...I'm sure you know exactly the kind of stuff I'm getting at.  They're natural movements to seemingly everyone else.   I tried yoga and CrossFit and found it so demoralizing. I think people who suggest yoga probably can't fathom how stiff we really are. The instructors would give me modifications, and then have to modify the modification, and then seem genuinely perplexed when ""put your heels down"" (for one example) was an impossible demand.  So after 2+ years of this and making little progress with various classes and youtube videos, I visited a physical therapist 3 weeks ago.  Physical therapy is the best thing I've ever done! I felt stupid going in because I've never had an injury and don't have pain. It felt like a cosmetic issue, but my stretching had been so aimless. My assessment revealed stuff I hadn't even considered (my ankle joints are pretty stuck, but when that's been ""normal"" my whole life I didn't know my ankles are a big problem), and the exercises I've been given are making me sore in places I feel like I've never moved in my life. It's like there have been entire muscles my brain  ignored, so I'd compensate in other ways (resulting in bad form) or just not achieve full range of motion.    Anyway, I just had my third session yesterday, and I ideally do my stretches for about 90 minutes every day. One hour in the morning, and half an hour at night. But sometimes I can't do them all at once, so I spread them out and just try to do everything twice.  And I roll around like a cat on this foam roller. I'm not magically bendy or anything yet, and some of my exercises are super hard (""bridge stabilization""!), but I am optimistic because I'm finally learning how to move and feel how things are supposed to work. Like, until yesterday, I had never stretched my Achilles tendons. Ever. Might sound ridiculous for a runner, but my brain always engages the muscles in the front of my leg (tibialis anterior), and I had to focus and make a few clumsy attempts to shift the stretch to my calves (soleus & gastrocnemius muscles).    Oh, but here's the direct way to do it (which I was shown after locating the muscles in another pose), and it feels really good!: Best Calf Stretch Ever with /u/Antranik.  All his videos are great.  I'm excited to get to a point more of them become relevant & possible to me, haha.   So...right. Physical therapy is the first time in my life I've ever been given advice that's actually helpful and has real, immediately obvious results. Don't waste your time fussing around in yoga/fitness classes when the most basic poses and proper form aren't coming to you easily. There will be plenty of opportunities to enjoy them later on. :)"

(for you 1a in particular but all are important for handstand prehab) Start on your knees and work up to a plank position with the fingers facing backwards, push a bit and try to drag the wrists forwards on the floor (""against the stretch"" so to say) this will help straightening the elbows.  Passive hangs can also help. Simply hang from a bar and straighten your elbows in the hang for reps of 2-3 seconds, this will strengthen your elbow extension for handstands etc."

With that said, I would add in foam rolling.  Weight training has a tendency to gunk up connective tissue and regular self massage does wonders for restoring RoM restrictions.      Joe DeFranco's program Limber 11 is very good for squat mobility.  It doesn't cover anything upper body though.    From reading your post, when you say weightlifter I'm assuming that you're saying you lift weights, not that you're an athlete specializing in the sport of weightlifting (snatch/clean&jerk).  With that said, you should really try to incorporate overhead squats into your program as well as some other (the sport of) weightlifting stretches.  A solid overhead squat is really the hallmark of flexibility in the barbell world.  It demands a great deal of hip, ankle, back, and should flexibility to be stable deep in the hole.  These other weightlifting stretches are good and I can vouch for their effectiveness:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKLVlYt2Ioc  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwLM5n-rYmA  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLh0jF5M_gY  Note:  Weightlifters tend to have flexibility that is second only to gymnasts (despite many of them weighing well over 300 lbs).

No, i lift in powerlifting/bodybuilding style. I just didn't call myself powerlifter or bodybuilder because i don't compete.   I have DIY foam roller but it's too damn painful when i roll my quads/hip flexors, but i don't feel a thing when i roll my hamstrings or lower back. Should i get a ""real"" foam roller or they're all the same?  Ok now i have few programs but still   it's very difficult for me to stretch because i can get myself to feel right muscles. for example, lats, pecs - easy. but i can't feel my lower back, traps. when i stretch hip flexors it just hurts very much, i can't even do it."
flexibility,35xon6,Scientologst,3,Thu May 14 12:03:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for sure.  Joe knows what he is talking about.    That pain when foam rolling is indicative of just how gunked up those areas are.  Work those spots out every day (or even a couple times a day) and over time they will go away/stop being painful.    If you're not feeling anything in some areas (like hamstrings, glutes, etc.) it's likely because these are very thick tissue areas.  Try something harder (a thick pvc pipe or lacrosse ball).  My cousin has done powerlifting for 10+ years and trains with this guy named Donnie Thompson who rolls a 130lb steel cylindric ex-wife down the posterior chain for this (http://breakingmuscle.com/video/super-d-video-body-tempering-with-the-cold-hard-x-wife).    Different muscle groups may feel different when stretching.  Sometimes I've found it better to focus motion than feeling stretch in a particular muscle group.  As far as hip flexor pain goes... that's a call that you need to decide on your own, whether the pain is something that is worked out with stretching/rolling or is indicative of an actual problem.  Some pain is just a product of a stretch.  Some is bad.  You're the only one that can really make that kind of distinction."

Try ART for those areas, reciprocal inhibition, rolling out all the muscles in the area, testing for strength imbalances... If things are off in some extreme way it may be something you haven't thought of."

flexibility,35xon6,disanchez27,2,Thu May 14 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"Also a weightlifter working on improving his flexibility here. I've been doing a modified version of Joe DeFranco's limber 11 since January and have definitely seen improvements in both my posture and flexibility. Here's some advice based on my experiences so far:   Use templated programs as a way to get to know your body better,  but not as the be-all, end-all. The limber 11 is great but i found I personally needed to pay extra attention to my hips so i made a few tweaks to it to spend more time on them.  Foam rolling and other smr is crucial. I sometimes do it for an hour a day, it's definitely the major source of the improvements I've made.  As you lift, (and even as you go about your day) focus on engaging the muscles you didn't previously have access to. For me, some of those were parts of your hamstrings, glutes, delts, and abdominals. Improving flexibility isn't useful to you unless your strengthen your muscles across that new range of motion.    Hope that helps, good luck."

Without a warmup it'll take longer to hit your current max.   Should I repeat a stretch?   If you want to get better at that stretch, yes. Repeat as many times as it takes until another iteration doesn't yield a deeper stretch -- or you run out of time.   Should I focus on just one stretch/muscle group per session?   To make progress on a particular position you need to do it a lot. You will probably be better off picking a stretch that will have the most carry-over to your sport and do it as often as you can. For hips that'll probably be side split, front split, or pancake."

flexibility,35yl75,rassefrasse,5,Thu May 14 16:24:46 2015 UTC,"Stretching cold muscles isn't really a no-no, it's just that your cold flexibility is always less than your warm flexibility. This means simply if you don't warm up prior to a stretching session you will need significantly longer to reach your end range of motion in a cold muscle.  Just do some dynamic stretches before your stretching session for the muscles you're planning to stretch. This will loosen and warm them up and will also help you develop active flexibility, as well as help getting your cold flexibility closer to your warm flexibility."
flexibility,35yl75,GoGoGoemon,1 point,Thu May 14 18:40:08 2015 UTC,it's just that your cold flexibility is always less than your warm flexibility.    This isn't correct.  We had a large discussion this in a previous thread.
flexibility,35yl75,ReverendBizarre,1 point,Thu May 14 20:33:38 2015 UTC,"Are you certain this is a 1:1 translation? In my experience, even in my strongest ""cold stretches"", really warmed up I get a tiny bit further. I'm talking about a subtle difference here, something like a ratio of 1:0,9 warm to cold. 1 cm or 2 in side splits for example."
flexibility,35yl75,GoGoGoemon,1 point,Thu May 14 21:07:25 2015 UTC,"For the stretches where I've built my end range of motion completely through methods which allow me to access it cold, there is absolutely no difference between cold or warm.  For other stretches, where I also use passive stretching and such, there will be a difference.  But that's because of how I train, not because of how flexibility works."
flexibility,35yl75,ReverendBizarre,1 point,Fri May 15 07:31:29 2015 UTC,"I'm intrigued, but I've to say I'm also highly skeptical. Not only does my personal experience not reflect your claim but it also goes against the grain of what pretty much any flexibility ""expert"" I know says. Kit, for example, not only recommends a warm-up but also wearing thermals/tights to keep the heat in the muscles during stretch sessions.   Would you mind elaborating a bit more?  How does this relate to what Feldenkrais called ""parasitic"" tension?   How does this relate to connective tissue, fascia? From my understanding their elasticity is highly sensitive to temperature and also fluid levels, which are somewhat dependent on blood flow.  By the way, hot yoga, which you mentioned in the other thread, isn't a good example, since ambient temperature doesn't necessarily affect muscle temperature.  Also reading that you stretch right out of bed, better be a bit cautious with spinal movements, because the intervertebral discs are highly hydrated from lying all night, which puts high stress on your spine if you perform any spinal bending, especially under load, right after rising. According to Stuart McGill spinal bending and especially spinal flexion exercises should be avoided within the first hour after rising from bed, after that fluid levels in the spine normalise."
flexibility,35yl75,GoGoGoemon,1 point,Fri May 15 08:47:42 2015 UTC,"I never said a warm up help you get deeper into a stretch.  Flexibility isn't about your muscles getting longer, it's about altering sensation  With tthis in mind, how do you alter this sensation? Most people will warm up, get their muscles ready to go into this position. Most people associate this warming up with somehow making the muscle ready to elongate (hence the word stretching), but that's not the case. You are just telling your body   Hey, it's safe to go into this position that we thought was crazy.   But my point is that this isn't the only way to achieve this altered sensation. If you train in a different way and teach your body in a different matter that this position is safe, it is possible to achieve the same flexibility without warming up.  I'm not saying the latter is better. I'm simply saying that:   Your muscles aren't actually getting longer. At least not by any amount that matters. There is a method which allows you to access your maximal flexibility without an extensive warm up.   This method involves making your muscles stronger at the end of your range of motion. In other words, your muscles feel comfortable in those positions and are fine with staying there. Which is the exact same thing warming up (or certain breathing techniques usually taught in yoga) achieve.  Edit: Regarding spinal movements. Like I said before, I don't apply this methodology to everything. For personal reasons, I don't trust myself to do this with back bends for example simply because I think it looks scary doing them without warming up.  Edit 2:  Just to be absolutely clear. You stated that your cold flexibility will always be less than your warm flexibility. I refuted this by saying that if you train in a specific way, your cold flexibility can be the same as your warm flexibility.  Nothing more and nothing less. I still warm up for most things and think it's essential to working out."

I refuted this by saying that if you train in a specific way, your cold flexibility can be the same as your warm flexibility.   Yes, and for the most part I agree with what you are saying. Strengthening end ROM will bring your cold flexibility pretty damn close to your warm flexibility (and also bring your active flexibility closer to your passive), but not all the way. For all I know there's always going to be, at least, a subtle difference, somewhere in the 10% or less range. Acquiring flexibility isn't just (re-)teaching the CNS to allow access to a certain ROM, there are often other, physical, factors at play too, like adhesions, trigger points, ""parasitic"" tension. This is also in part due to physical limitations, i.e. viscosity of muscle tissue and connective tissue which both are sensitive to blood flow and temperature, or am I wrong here?   I never said a warm up help you get deeper into a stretch.   But exactly that is warm flexibility or not? Sorry but aren't you contradicting yourself here?  Apologies for nitpicking! I'm not trying to win an argument here. Just genuinely intrigued by your somewhat ""bold"" statement. Honestly, I have no ego invested in this! On the contrary, I'd be pretty glad to be wrong actually! ;-)"

If there are other factors at play, it gets more complicated for sure. I honestly have no idea how trigger points and such factor into this. Maybe you need a warm up to pass those but I've never had that problem so I can't really comment on it.  And regarding adhesion, even though I'm no expert on it, I think that lies outside both methods either way? You can remove those adhesions in multiple ways. I'm guessing one way would be to warm up and it might separate or you could just do it manually.  The only thing I have behind this is that my ""head to toe"" flexibility requires no proper warming up to reach end ROM. I can still put my chin to my toe with a straight leg whether I've just woken up (at this point, it takes ~50 reps of moving in and out of it, I don't call this warming up though) or after a 90 minute intense yoga class where I feel like jelly afterwards and the difficulty in achieving it is the same to me.  However, for now, this only applies to this particular stretch since most of my flexibility comes from when I'm warmed up anyway and I mostly use the other method to achieve what you describe: my cold flexibility is somewhere between 90 and ~98% of my warm flexibility.  So to me, it applies 100% to the things where I only worked on it with that method (for example head to toe stretches) while other stretches like front splits, pancake and bridges, are 90-98% cold since I work on those mostly through yoga but the former method helps with working on them cold.  There is a word missing in that second part, it was supposed to say:   I never said a warm up won't help you get deeper into a stretch.   And then I probably should have added:   But there are other ways of getting that same depth without warming up.   I think it's all a bit difficult to measure though since basically everyone starts with the typical ""stretching when warm"" routine and there will always be some leftovers from that."

I think we're pretty much on the same page, we're just arguing with different concepts of what constitutes a ""warm-up"" for stretching sessions in mind.   50 reps is way more than I would have suggested as a warm-up! Kurz recommends 10-20 reps, at max, of a given dynamic mobility drill, e.g. in Flexibility Express he uses 10 reps of a squat/good morning/overhead press combo with a very light weight as a warm-up for the entire wide squat series and that's it.

Some people say mobility is the amount of range you have in a joint that you can control and flexibility is the full range.  Others divide it into what sort of exercises you do. Mobility is dynamic drills for your joints (shoulder circles, ankle rotations) and flexibility is static (holding a stretch). Or mobility is manual therapy (lacrosse balls, foam rollers, banded distractions) and flexibility is regular ol' stretching.  afaict, people wanted a new term that did not have any old baggage associated with it so they could interest clients in a new (or just rebranded) kind of flexibility training. When you say ""flexibility"" or ""stretching"" people think, ""contortionism, painful static stretching, yoga -- no thanks"". When you say ""mobility"" they think, ""Something new -- I'll try it."""

flexibility,35rlb3,umbrot,3,Wed May 13 01:14:15 2015 UTC,"There's this general awareness that bridges and back bending are bad for the lumber spine. It stems from the fact that this is the only part of the spine that bends backwards, and it's just easier to crunch the backbend into that part instead of making all the back, shoulders and the hip take more equal role in bending back. Many people suffered lower back injuries because they didn't distribute the bend as they should have, but the notion remained that it's the bridges that are bad for your lumber spine, not the errors in the technique."
flexibility,35rlb3,umbrot,1 point,Wed May 13 04:49:52 2015 UTC,"Holy shit this makes a lot of stuff clear now. The lumbar stays stable but the shoulders, hips, and upper back are what bends. If you're balancing a plate on your lower abdomen it should stay stable while doing this, right? That's the kind of bend you're aiming for? Hips rotate, shoulders turn, upper back stabilises the shoulders and bends a bit, and that's it?"
flexibility,35rlb3,ReverendBizarre,5,Wed May 13 05:03:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, the bend should not concentrate just in the lumbar spine. The middle and upper back don't bend back naturally so you have to actively do it. Shoulder and hip flexibility also play a role here. I'm restricted in my shoulders so that's definitely an area that I'm trying to improve.   I don't consider, though, that the angle of the abdomen to be part of the alignment. It really depends how far away are your feet from the hands and if you straighten the legs, and how deep is the backbend. Also, the bend in the upper back, ideally should be as big as possible. It just so restricted by the ribcage, it wouldn't bend well if at all.  For a bridge this wide I'd consider this a good goal alignment: legs straight, spine evenly curves throughout the entire length, shoulders continuing the line of the back smoothly and further forward than the hands, arms straight. A nice water drop shaped bridge."

flexibility,35rlb3,umbrot,3,Thu May 14 16:56:17 2015 UTC,"As a beginner is hard not to crunch the lower spine, as it is the only area that bends backwards. It takes time, building strength and mobility, and learning to operate your body to stop doing that. I'm still figuring out how to bend at the upper back.   It's not totally harmful to bend at the lower back. More advanced backbends will require the lumbar spine to bend as well, and any noticeable increases in flexibility will be credited to your lower back. As long as you work on strength and try to even out the pressure on the spine, you should be fine.  Yes I'm (sort of) European originally, and not a native speaker. My English is a work in progress, just like my bridges."
flexibility,35rlb3,phrakture,1 point,Wed May 13 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"Your english is basically perfect, and the traits you express in your grammar may as well be a dialect, it's just a consequence of whatever your original language's (probably more sensible) grammar taught you to speak. It's entirely understandable, it's just taking a slightly different path to the same place.   how far away are your feet   Just a mixup of placement, it's really common and not that bad.   how far away your feet are   Similarly:   how deep is the backbend   Extremely common error, it happens for a reason.   how deep the backbend is   I hate english and I'm a native speaker. You're awesome to have learned it, it's not an easy language by any means."

flexibility,35tnu9,Mellor88,1 point,Wed May 13 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"It's not clear from your comment so far as to what the issue really is. From what I understood, If you are able to be in that position (laying on the back, legs straight pointing at the ceiling) if somebody pushes you there, but not on your own then you lack strength.  To raise your legs you need core and quad strength. You can try to raise one leg straight at the time and keep the other one either on the ground or pointing straight up. You can also raise them bent, straighten up to the ceiling and then lower them down very very slowly down. For an extra challenge lower them to the point where it's the hardest not to drop, and hold there for as long as you can. You can also raise them as far up as you can and hold there for as long as you can. Over time you'll build strength on both sides of this motion and will be able to connect them into a full leg raise."
flexibility,35tnu9,BetaCarotine20mg,1 point,Wed May 13 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"To raise your legs you need core and quad strength   Hip flexors strength more so that quad strength. With the exception of the rectus femoris, the quads don’t cross the hip. So they don’t flex it. RM, plus the other hip flexors are acting here."
flexibility,35nxbm,Ronit_Hazarika,3,Tue May 12 01:22:37 2015 UTC,"We are talking about middle/side/Chinese splits, right?  If so, sounds like your abductors are getting overworked. I get that too from frequent straddle work. Massage, massage, massage is my solution! Tensor fascia latae, lateral thigh (ilitobial band) and glutes (all of them and piriformis)!   Massage them directly before you do any straddle stretching. Massage them while you're in the side splits, if they start acting up. Massage them afterwards and anytime you feel like doing so. Don't go so hard that you have to squint your eyes!  Also make it a habit to do some light counterstretching after straddle sessions. There are plenty of good piriformis stretches, but I'm still on the hunt for a good TFL one, somehow the ones I know never really hit the spot."
flexibility,35nxbm,-_x,1 point,Tue May 12 06:36:19 2015 UTC,"It could be lack of external hip rotation that manifests itself in your middle splits. Some popular stretches are the pigeon pose (front leg is externally rotated), frog pose with feet together, Log Pose, pancake split. But do take the time and search up other stretches/routines that might benefit your body more."
flexibility,35nxbm,ClockworkMagpie,0,Tue May 12 19:49:15 2015 UTC,Could the pain be due to a pinch in the sciatic nerve ?
flexibility,35nxbm,ClockworkMagpie,1 point,Wed May 13 07:26:42 2015 UTC,"Even an actually professional can't tell you that over the internet.

flexibility,35kd91,zschrader,8,Mon May 11 05:01:31 2015 UTC,I call them bounces.
flexibility,35kd91,ReverendBizarre,1 point,Mon May 11 07:38:40 2015 UTC,That's the extremely technical term. Can you ELI5?
flexibility,35kd91,bo_knows,3,Mon May 11 11:22:45 2015 UTC,"Do whatever you want to stretch. Go the end of your range of motion, move in and out of it in a controlled manner for a lot of repetitions (I'm talking 300-500 per day).  Hence, ""bouncing"" or ""pulsing"".  So what's linked up top is a forward fold (or pike) bounce. You can also do bouncing pancakes or whatever you can think of. Though I'm not sure if it's effective for every type of stretch."
flexibility,35kd91,ReverendBizarre,2,Mon May 11 11:41:15 2015 UTC,"I was mostly joking, but thanks for the reply.  300-500 reps? Wooo! Maybe that's why I can't touch my toes, I don't do nearly enough volume."
flexibility,35kd91,bo_knows,3,Mon May 11 11:47:20 2015 UTC,"Haha, I realized you were joking but wrote it out anyway :p  I had a very good pike (hands wrapped around feet and all that) before starting this type of stretching but I didn't reach ""crazy levels"" until I did. Now I can touch my chin to my toes in a single leg pike and am getting pretty close to getting my forehead to my toes during a full pike."

flexibility,35iw4y,standardwoman,2,Sun May 10 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"Stretching is painful. You put your body in a position it seldom finds itself in, and the nervous system will alert you by tensing up and sending pain signals. I'd be more concerned if I didn't feel any kind of pain in a stretch.   You just need to go slow, do deep breaths, keep a calm relaxed state of mind, wait the tension and the pain over and try to deepen the stretch with an exhale."
flexibility,35iw4y,ClockworkMagpie,3,Mon May 11 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on the pain. If we're talking discomfort in the muscle. Fine. It could be weak muscles contracting very hard to resist a stretch. Or it could be some sort of groin injury or who knows what.  I wouldn't tell someone I've never seen that their pain is normal. The only thing we can recommend is to go get it checked out in person by a professional."

flexibility,35eypa,DiversDoitDeeper87,3,Sat May 9 22:09:57 2015 UTC,"If the stretch is hard enough on its own for you then stretching after the back muscles have been exhausted will likely increase your chance for injury - and spine injuries suck big time. If you're worried about the possible loss of strength with stretching pre-lift then maybe try back extensions (standing, prone) instead of full-on bridging post-lift for a few weeks.  Hope this helps."

I just want to know if anyone here has advice on some good stretches to get that scapula moving better to loosen the scar tissue.  Edit: want to point out I am pursuing a surgical option to repair the scar, I live in Canada but not within 500km of the border so the medical process takes a long time which is why I'm looking for stretches just to help for now."

My chiro has also given me some stretches but I know he can't know every good stretch so I figure, fuck it, I'll ask these nice folks on reddit. With this post I've already been pointed towards two new to me techniques that I'm very excited to bring to my chiro.

To work on it yourself: Foam roller, lacrosse ball, softball are tools you'll want to pick up (or for substantially more money there are these http://www.roguefitness.com/mobility-rehab/mobilitywod), check out mobilitywod.com and consider the book Becoming A Supple Leopard (I think the 2nd edition is coming out soon).
