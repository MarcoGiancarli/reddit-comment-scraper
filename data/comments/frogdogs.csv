frogdogs,3dqrz3,WharGoul666,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:27:17 2015 UTC,"yeah... That is most likely poison from the frog. If he's foaming from the mouth, don't take a picture. Take him to the vet. Now."
frogdogs,3dqrz3,junohd,18,Sat Jul 18 17:56:39 2015 UTC,"How about both? Not the first time this has happened. The frogs in the area do secrete a slight toxin that cause dogs to spit them out. After the first time this happened, the vet recommend to flush his mouth out with water and the situation will correct itself. My poor boy just refuses to learn from his mistakes."
frogdogs,3dqj4k,nikolastankovic,11,Sat Jul 18 14:01:19 2015 UTC,"The blues are not accepted by the AKC as they have skin and other allergy problems which are not prevalent in the accepted colors.  Frenchies have enough challenges without jumping out on a limb with additional allergy issues in my opinion.  While I agree that the blues are stunning, we stay away from them (and we've had frenchies for ~15 yrs now.  Currently have 3 of them).  I would also STRONGLY discourage you from a ""new breeder"".  Especially one who is breeding blues.  No reputable breeder is going to breed blues.  Frenchies are a very specialized breed for a breeder, and frankly I wouldn't be interested in buying from anyone who hasn't been breeding them for quite some time.    In a breeder, I tell people to look for someone who is an AKC Breeder of Merit, has FBDCA (french bulldog club of america) membership and can provide +5 generations of lineage (my dogs have 7 to +10 generations documented).  Genetic testing and spinal x-rays of parents are also very key things I like to find.  In short, I want to do the best I can to ensure we are getting dogs that will have the least amount of problems possible, and I do that by working with breeders who stand to lose a lot by selling/breeding shitty dogs."
frogdogs,3dqj4k,JeF4y,2,Sat Jul 18 16:41:18 2015 UTC,Thank you so much for your input. This was very helpful. By the way your dogs look awesome! Would it ever be possible for these blue dogs to become accepted though ? I'm going to go back to the searching game now.
frogdogs,3dqj4k,axianaa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:07:54 2015 UTC,"the reason blue frenchies aren't accepted by the akc is because the blue color in dogs can be linked to genetic issues such as alopecia (hair loss). that said, i don't think anyone has proven that there is a link in blue frenchies, just other types of blue dogs. so it's not necessarily true that blue frenchies will have health problems.  THAT SAID, the main reason you should avoid blue frenchies is because it's not an akc standard and therefore any reputable breeder will not breed them (since reputable breeders breed show dogs that fit akc standards). also, non-reputable breeders will sell blue dogs as ""rare"" color dogs for more money, but in reality they're only ""rare"" color dogs because reputable breeders won't breed them. so ultimately you're probably getting a lower quality dog (since the breeder is clearly out to make money, not breed show dogs) for a higher price."
frogdogs,3dqj4k,tallmiller,4,Sun Jul 19 18:11:34 2015 UTC,"We were pretty intrigued by blues for a long time too before we got Cooper (black brindle with a white chest).   After some research we found that the ""rare"" and expensive blue, chocolate colors are more marketing than anything to justify ridiculous pricing. They're just less common.   Frenchies as a whole (like a lot of pure breds) are prone to their own set of health concerns. I haven't heard of anything in regards to that relating to their coloring; but I could be wrong. If you're going with the breeder route, I would go visit a couple different ones and go talk to them and see their dogs."
frogdogs,3dqj4k,poortographer,4,Sat Jul 18 15:10:36 2015 UTC,"As the other poster stated, the less common colours are just an excuse to charge more; especially because blue, liver and mouse aren't registered AKC colours for the dog. That matters to some people, not to others. If anything they could be healthier because they obviously have something else bred in there.   All frenchies have health concerns, registered or unregistered. Breathing, wrinkles, eyes, back problems. You've just gotta do your best to mitigate them by keeping them at the correct weight, feeding them a high end food and regular vet checkups. Making sure they come from a good place in the first place also helps.   All that being said, I've never had or met a dog with the personality of a Frenchie. Playful, cheerful, hilarious, lazy, ever loving."
frogdogs,3dqj4k,JeF4y,5,Sat Jul 18 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"I've never had or met a dog with the personality of a Frenchie. Playful, cheerful, hilarious, lazy, ever loving.    People scoff when they find out I have several simply because of the price.  I tell them that my therapy bills without these dogs would greatly exceed the price for these kids!"
frogdogs,3dqj4k,poortographer,3,Sat Jul 18 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend would agree with you 100%. He's like a therapy dog.   And I'm not saying that other dogs aren't as capable, because I'm sure there are plenty that are, I just think frenchies are unique in their personality traits.   I always explain to people they cost so much because of artificial insemination and c-section birthing; but it's a small price to pay. All purebred dogs are pretty expensive these days."
frogdogs,3dqj4k,JeF4y,2,Sat Jul 18 16:59:59 2015 UTC,Yup. I honestly can't see ever not having at least one.
frogdogs,3dqj4k,alphasierratango,2,Sat Jul 18 17:38:51 2015 UTC,I know exactly what you mean! My mom has made remarks about how much my dog has improved my overall well being. Despite a few medical hiccups she maintains that he's worth his weight in gold.
frogdogs,3dqj4k,Jenjenmi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:22:15 2015 UTC,"I have a blue frogdog. I did not seek one out, but we came across a breeder with puppies once we had picked out this breed.  You might do better to stick with the breed standard.  My dog is just over a year. No significant health issues so far. He is adoreable and is a wonderful companion. He is my first dog and I don't know how I lived without one!"
frogdogs,3dqj4k,JackkHammerr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:42:31 2015 UTC,"They're only ""rare"" because most reputable breeders breed only what is within the ""standard"" of the AKC, and chocolate, blue, and tri-colored are not accepted colors from the AKC, yet... The health issues have been proven to be bullshit. The real reason they aren't accepted by the AKC is because at the time those colors were considered less desirable to most owners. Now they are in demand so that obviously isn't the case but the AKC is run by a bunch of old people that will take a very long time to decide to change their rules. They are great looking dogs, but I feel it is bullshit that breeders specifically breed them to sell them at an inflated price. There's nothing more special or rare about them aside from the fact that most reputable breeders don't breed them. But hey if you have the money and it's worth it to you go for it."

frogdogs,38si88,Taxing,1 point,Sat Jun 6 12:54:55 2015 UTC,"Be careful! Look for subtle warning signs your dog may give off when the baby bothers him/her:   lip licking yawning ""whale eyes"" (google ""whale eyes dog"") a stiffly wagging tail (not easy to spot with Frenchies)   These are the more subtle warning signs. When a dog displays these signs, you should remove your child and back off right away. When these more subtle warnings/calming signals are ignored, that is when dogs feel they need to give a stronger warning (growling, nipping, lunging, barking). When those are ignored (or scolded for that matter) that is when your dog says to him/herself ""how do I get through to these people? Guess I'll really have to show 'em"" and that is what leads to a bite.  Just a word of caution!"

frogdogs,35cvdk,KendrawrMac,2,Sat May 9 02:16:40 2015 UTC,Very beautiful frenchie. How do you keep her from getting brown stains under her eyes?
frogdogs,35cvdk,ddi38,5,Sat May 9 02:30:09 2015 UTC,I dilute Ketochlor shampoo (like maybe a tablespoon full) with distilled water (about 2 cups) and soak a bunch of 4x4 gauze pads in there...I wipe her face every other day and I give her 10mg Zyrtec twice a day. Sometimes i use NeoPolyDex eye ointment if her allergies are causing her to water up. She's on a Salmon protein grain free diet (Purina Beyond mixed with Purina JM prescription diet) which also helps with allergies/skin issues :)

He didn't get sick or anything was just a little blue for a few days. Scared the heck out of us but he was still his happy little self."

frogdogs,32swr3,HRH_Maddie,2,Thu Apr 16 16:31:01 2015 UTC,"I'm seeing this list of available dogs on their website: http://www.frenchbulldogrescue.org/adoption-info/available-dogs2/  But I know that cities/states often have their own rescue networks, so just do a bit of Googling or reach out to FBRN and see if they can point you to a nearby rescue."
frogdogs,32swr3,JeF4y,7,Thu Apr 16 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"You have to consider a couple of things.  Frenchies are a difficult dog to breed, and truly needs to be done by very seasoned professional breeders / veterinarians. That being the case, the BEST dogs you'll find will be ones that you may have to travel hundreds or thousands of miles for a well bred pup.  Further, you often can end up waiting 6months or more for a well bred pup.  In looking for a breeder, look for an AKC Breeder of Merit and FBDCA membership (french bulldog club of america).    Most of the time they will have a website.  The shittier the website, the better the breeder so it seems.  Dog breeders are NOT web developers, and for some reason they don't ever pay people to design a good site for them.  They are all like geocities sites from the 90's.    CALL the breeders and talk to them.  Talk to them about their pups, the lineage they have (I look for 7-10+ generations documented), ask about genetic testing, spinal xrays, etc.  The more work that a breeder does in ensuring they are breeding the best dogs, the better your luck will be in avoiding health probs in the future.  Overall, don't be afraid to travel for a dog (Our breeders are in S. FL and we're in Atlanta), and don't be too bummed out if you're on a waiting list.  Just be patient.  It will be worth it."
frogdogs,32swr3,DalvadorSali,3,Thu Apr 16 13:52:01 2015 UTC,"I got extremely lucky. Was looking for a dog, and a friend of a friend happened to be a breeder. He had kept one out of a litter for himself. After a year he felt bad because this little guy wasn't getting enough attention because of the other frenchies he had for breeding. I ended up buying him at 1 year old, fully behaved and trained for a few hundred bucks. He's now the only dog in a house of 5 people so he gets all the attention he can handle :)"

We were initially worried about the pulling but our veterinarian assured us that they have so much muscle in their upper chest and neck that using a collar is just fine. They also said the same thing as your instructor about harnesses promoting pulling and that collars can teach them to pull less.

frogdogs,2yki46,kk_toxicc12,2,Wed Mar 11 02:52:46 2015 UTC,She's just small heh. She's the 2nd smallest in her litter.
frogdogs,2yn2bb,HollisWhitney,1 point,Wed Mar 11 03:30:13 2015 UTC,this could be a sign of allergies.  it could be nothing big or it could turn into something larger.  our little guy takes benadryl for his allergies as recommend by our vet.

frogdogs,2yhnxy,matscifu,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:00:06 2015 UTC,We brought ours at 10 weeks. He showed no fear playing with a lab four times his size..
frogdogs,2yhnxy,ntrinsik,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:29:00 2015 UTC,"9 weeks old. And the puppy she played with was her size (puppy Pomeranian) and they had bigger pups separated from the small ones and had to have proof of all current vaccines.  It's great for pup socialization, especially since I live in a condo and she's at a crucial stage for socializing."

frogdogs,2y9fwg,shenghar,3,Sat Mar 7 18:42:30 2015 UTC,Typical frog. Was it the single 'hey human I need help with this' bark?  I get that when he can't get in the couch or his toys are under the table.
frogdogs,2y9fwg,poortographer,3,Sat Mar 7 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"He has a really weird (imo) bark. It's really more of an arf than I've ever heard and if he needs help he just arfs, waits, arfs again, repeat with some whines intermixed if he's feeling particularly neglected (ha)"

frogdogs,2xu4y6,ambientvape,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:55:16 2015 UTC,"I don't really have much opinion on it honestly. You can register blues but not show them due to the coat color, not a problem for my parents since their new pup will just be a house pet.  I had a look up and its interesting to find out, Cream is also not an accepted breed standard in some countries too, such as the USA. Source"
frogdogs,2xu4y6,JeF4y,6,Wed Mar 4 00:27:39 2015 UTC,"Its not about whether its a certified coat color or if you can show him or not- french bulldogs that are ""blue"" are highly prone to genetic disorders, especially with their eyes. I'm not knocking you, but breeding this color is highly frowned upon because it is considered to be cruel. Just giving you a heads up if he starts developing problems."
frogdogs,2xu4y6,TheIlluminaughty,3,Wed Mar 4 14:48:02 2015 UTC,"This!   Blue is not an accepted coat due to the genetic problems inherent with it.  While they're gorgeous, the breed is difficult, finicky and costly without the added problems of genetic issues popping up."

frogdogs,2xu4y6,JeF4y,7,Wed Mar 4 00:06:58 2015 UTC,"""good breeder"" and ""blue frenchie"" are mutually exclusive.    No breeder with a strong reputation in the frenchie community will breed blue frenchies."
frogdogs,2xu4y6,CSRazor,1 point,Wed Mar 4 14:55:49 2015 UTC,Why is that?
frogdogs,2xu4y6,Tidz,3,Wed Mar 4 17:52:51 2015 UTC,"Because Blue Frenchies are outside of the breed standard.  Breeding outside of the standard is not something that any breeder with a solid AKC reputation will do since it's completely against the AKC.  The problem is that 10 years ago Frenchies were relatively unknown.  They weren't even in the top 50 breeds.  Now they're in the top 10.  This has paved the way for a lot of breeders who may not be familiar with frenchies, or simply don't give a crap and are just looking for money."

He's turning 5 in April and he's as playful and psychotic as ever.  Though he can get pretty defensive with dogs on the street this past year or two, which is a bit stressful.

I feed mine Call Of The Wild - Pacific Stream Puppy Formula but there are plenty of other options out there. They are also very sensitive to temperature. Too hot or too cold can be bad for them. Other than that, just be ready for lots of cuddles, snorting, and snoring."

Don't feel bad, but I just wanted OP to know the actual name of it if they go and try to buy it.  I agree, it's a great food, but be careful with it if your pup has allergies.  One of mine is allergic to poultry and all of the cans (including the fish version) and a lot of the dry food has chicken product in it.  Otherwise, I agree, it's a great food."
frogdogs,2x5awz,NotSoNaughtyNurse,2,Thu Feb 26 07:36:35 2015 UTC,"My Frenchie has done really well on Royal Canin. Totally depends on the dog. Farts are few and far between. Even on a good diet, Frenchie butt is an unavoidable part of owning a Frenchie. You get used to it though."

They need to be taught each new behavior slowly, step by step, without any force or intimidation.  Check out my YouTube channel to learn more about how to teach behaviors step by step using short training sessions and high value treats. I'm a certified dog trainer, so I know what it takes to train aloof dogs (stubbornness is not a quality dogs have because stubbornness requires intentional thought. Dogs do not have intentional thought. We use the word ""aloof"" to describe a dog who is tough to motivate)."

If you're lucky then yours won't have any allergy issues which is about the #1 problem with Frenchies.  Oh also, although they're not the most active dogs anyhow try to limit your pup from jumping off beds, sofas, etc.. or get ramps for them to climb up and down.  They are known to have back injuries from diving off furniture.  Otherwise, enjoy your dog and take plenty of pictures and videos."

I adopted at 1 year but apparently missed a critical window. He is not fearful or aggressive toward us (wife,kids) but has bit others who bend o we to pet him without warning. According to the behavioral specialist we consulted with there really is not much we can do. He is a great dog but we have to be very careful and it is not the situation we pictured."

We try to get him out to the dog park and he does well. It seems to be when others are around us (my wife, kids, and myself). He gets excited (barking and stuff) and folks always want to bend over and pet him. I always ask them to stay back. And without common warning signs he bites. His only tell is the hair on his hind quarters goes up. Always has been a quick in and out which leads me to believe it is not aggressive but fear based. Most recently he was at the vet. Older woman comes in, he is barking, she wants to soothe him, she is asked to stay back, initially she does, he barks again and is excited, she reaches down and gets bit. He was quarantined, She went to hospital. I followed up to check on her. Got antibiotics but was fine. She admitted that she was at fault. Still it has happened before with others. We tried to surrender to FBRN thinking we were in over our heads but they couldn't take him with his history. The conclusion we reached was that he is a great dog but we have to be hyper vigilant about his environment. Still we are scared that it will only take one time.  I bought a muzzle specific for the breed and did my best to try to use it thinking that I could try again to show him others are ok slowly but he never tolerated it well."

frogdogs,2x5awz,The_Luckless,2,Wed Feb 25 22:09:03 2015 UTC,"+1 on the comments regarding quality, grain-free dog foods. If you've never given much thought to dog food I really recommend reading up before you get your dog. I'd also recommend starting your dog on a quality brand specially formulated for puppies and then gradually introducing adult-food as your dog gets older.   Keep an eye out for any skin or allergy issues and tackle them early. One of my Frog's started showing signs at about 9-months and it manifested as itchy paws that he constantly licked.   Let's see... I recommend going with a soft harness (e.g. Puppia) instead of a traditional dog collar (or both if your dog's tags are on a collar). Puppy classes are also a good idea and I had a very positive experience with my pups.   Since this is your first Frog I hope you're prepared for farts and snoring! Good luck, you're dog is really cute!"
frogdogs,2x5awz,Jaguar_S,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:12:01 2015 UTC,what brand of grain free food do you recommend?
frogdogs,2x5awz,wookie_walkin,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:29:55 2015 UTC,"No easy answer to that. I've been through the gamut of dog foods with my Frogs and have found that different feeds have different results and that just when you think you've got a good regimen going it can all change.   I guess I'll start with what I currently feed my dogs - my dog 'Moose' (Frenchie with food allergies) gets Prescription Hills z/d dry and wet food. My other Frenchie 'Louie' is currently fed Acana Singles (limited ingredient).   Before feeding Louie Acana I'd been successfully using a dog food called Nature's Variety Instinct. About 4 months ago Louis came down with what I thought was a hot spot (he's had this issue before); went to the vet got it treated but his skin continued to worsen to the point that his hair was falling out in leaving quarter-sized bald spots all over his body. A lot of vet trips, medicine, tests later were all inconclusive and we couldn't get his hair to grow back. I decided to search the internet and found out that Nature's Variety had been purchased by a much larger conglomerate (Diamond) that makes several different brands of dog foods. They changed the formula including significantly altering the main protein source and content. We switched to Acana and his condition improved dramatically over-night.   I guess the morale is stay vigilant of your dog's condition and don't take for granted what you think you know about what your dog is eating."

We picked up our Frenchie a few weeks ago and he seems to be doing okay on his food besides a pimple here and there but were told to also do supplements for potential allergies and whatnot in the future. I am concerned about his food but the vet and breeder both said it was good, Nature's Domain from Costco but it is manufactured by Diamond."
frogdogs,2x5awz,ntrinsik,4,Thu Feb 26 04:28:48 2015 UTC,"Prepare for a big personality.  That's a cute pup.  I've had my Frenchton for about five years now.  She has a mind all her own, which it not easily changed.  Besides the stubbornness, she is a joy.  I think they got the best of both worlds breeding Boston's and Frenchie's!"
frogdogs,2x5awz,UnknownOK,1 point,Wed Feb 25 23:12:29 2015 UTC,"Be really careful with its back. They can get disc issues pretty easily.  And seriously, socialize with everything. They want to be little guard dogs otherwise.  Other than that, best dogs ever created."
frogdogs,2x5awz,mrlongmire,1 point,Thu Feb 26 05:05:41 2015 UTC,get insurance.   Also try to prevent her from jumping or doing zoomies too much. We let ours go nuts and jump nonstop and a few months ago he had to have emergency spinal surgery($5k~). They are very prone to back/spine issues and if I had to do it over again I would really be careful with him and try to limit his crazy jumping/zoomies.

frogdogs,2wvq78,Hoops22,1 point,Tue Feb 24 05:02:55 2015 UTC,I wonder why? I saw her parents and they're big but proportionate to regular Frenchies. Maddy is 8 months old... I keep thinking she will fill out to become rounder and more stout.

frogdogs,2wu8qz,MaginThat,2,Mon Feb 23 04:49:30 2015 UTC,"The French Bulldog Rescue network is well known if you're interested in going that route. Even still these dogs are a hot commodity so you'd have to be patient.   As far as breeders go, do your research online (though even some good ones have poor websites), make some phone calls, and most importantly - if you find a breeder you like, go visit! They're always expecting new litters, so you could get your name on a waiting list.   Some legitimate breeders advertise online through various outlets, but any dog under $1500 I'd be extremely cautious with. You want proper shots and proper papers if you're plunking down a fair bit of money. Do some food (high quality is important) and vet research too and get ahead of the game. Most owners even recommend pet insurance."
frogdogs,2wu8qz,poortographer,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:23:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know any breeders, but I just wanted to pop in to say please adopt a rescue if possible. There are so many excellent pure bred dogs looking for homes. With the Internet, you can find rescued that will ship a dog cross country through a series of volunteer drivers. I'm a truck driver and transport rescued dogs to their furever homes when possible. I live in Madison, so if you want to research rescues around the country that have dogs you're interested in, feel free to PM me and I'll be glad to discuss the possibility of transporting. Happy hunting, friend!"
frogdogs,2wu8qz,Dudleysdad,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:50:08 2015 UTC,"you can check the french bulldog of americas breeder directory for reputable breeders in your area. i would also recommend home visits to ensure the puppies are coming from a breeder you are comfortable with. for rescues i always recommend the fbrn, the only issue is that it can be very challenging to get a rescue from them. as always, if you purchase from a breeder check out their litters dispositions and see how their older dogs act.  this will give you a good indication about how your puppy might also act."
