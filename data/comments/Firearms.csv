Firearms,3e3d7l,itchywateryfarts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:23:41 2015 UTC,"Some more clarification. The ability to handload for it is nice and I've just kind of always wanted an AK in 5.56. So when ARAK refused to make things right, I went ahead and took the initiative. The availability of 5.45 was not a factor at all in my decision."
Firearms,3e3d7l,snayperskaya,2,Tue Jul 21 20:29:57 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the availability of surplus 5.45
Firearms,3e3d7l,Zombiedrd,4,Tue Jul 21 20:00:15 2015 UTC,For when you want an AK that spits freedom
Firearms,3e3d7l,cow_puncher,3,Tue Jul 21 18:41:18 2015 UTC,What did you have to change? Bolt? Extractor? I'm assuming it was 5.45 before.

Firearms,3e1bv7,SpareiChan,19,Tue Jul 21 12:38:28 2015 UTC,"One that old you should probably check the headspace and bore  before you fire it. Mosin Nagants are great guns. You can usually pick them up pretty cheap but they aren't cheap because they're junk, they're inexpensive because Russia made so damn many of them. The majority were made during wartime and the armory where they were made was located next to the mine that the iron came out of the ground. The were three armories that made Mosins in Russia ; Tula,  Izhevsk and Sestroryetsk. Often the laborers were conscripted into service or were essentially slave labor.   The Mosins history is really interesting to read about and because they have such a huge following the are plenty of websites that will help you find out exactly which iteration of the gun you have. If you measure the overall length and get a white crayon and rub it on the roll mark in order to see it better you'll be better able to identify your particular rifle.   Check out  http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinIDII.htm when you have that information.  Again, they're cool but for reals, check the headspace and bore before you shoot it. You don't know if it's a gun or a grenade until you do. Even if the bore is not fireable , they make great wallhangers  and you can go pick another one up for less than $150 that you can shoot."
Firearms,3e1bv7,co2van,3,Tue Jul 21 07:27:42 2015 UTC,"made so damn many of them   Like 40 million, lol. I think only the AK platform beats it in manufacture. Maybe the AR platform and all its variants, military and civilian?"
Firearms,3e1bv7,Zombiedrd,3,Tue Jul 21 16:48:54 2015 UTC,"I'd say with all the civilian and military variants there's probably more ARs than Mosins by now, but I doubt the ARs outnumber AKs."
Firearms,3e1bv7,orthag,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:22 2015 UTC,"Still, a lot more Mosins than any of the other War era rifles."
Firearms,3e1bv7,Zombiedrd,-6,Tue Jul 21 18:02:30 2015 UTC,"Mosin Nagants are great guns.   Great for the price? Please define great...  EDIT: Wow. All I asked was from what perspective the gun was considered great. Hell, I own one. Used it to take my first buck. As noted below, it's a great cheap hunting gun. Great gun for cheap plinking. But outside of using the word 'cheap' as part of the descriptor, there are better options. Depends on the perspective!"
Firearms,3e1bv7,Baranyk,4,Tue Jul 21 13:19:56 2015 UTC,Mosins are great because I could build a house out of them for relatively little cost.

Firearms,3e1bv7,sparklyjesus,0,Tue Jul 21 13:49:42 2015 UTC,"I mean, if you want a cheap hunting gun, sure, you can't beat it. I've taken one with my unmodified 1940 91/30 Mosin at 92 yards. DRT.  Still doesn't make it a 'great gun'."
Firearms,3e1bv7,Baranyk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:35 2015 UTC,"Things can be great for different reasons. The mosin is great because it is cheap and reliable and inexpensive to feed. If the price were normalized to other rifles, it'd be a pretty average gun."
Firearms,3e1bv7,orthag,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:08:14 2015 UTC,You mean like the Savage Axis or Ruger American?
Firearms,3e1bv7,JakesGunReviews,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:54 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head, I completely agree with you except for one little piece:    If the price were normalized to other rifles, it'd be a pretty average gun.   The trigger is not up to modern construction standards. The length of pull is meant for a russian winter greatcoat, therefore very uncomfortable. Let's not get started on the buttplate. The sights are ok at best. The bolt lift, on the average example, is rather heavy. In fact, the gun is rather heavy. While for hunting this is less important, a typical example of a Russian surplus Mosin Nagant might be 1.5 to 2 MOA. It is not fitted for glass, should you desire a scope. Let us use the Remington 700 as an average gun. Now compare a R700 in .308 to the Mosin Nagant. And let us assume that the R700 is capable of 1 MOA out of the box. Alternatively, a R700 in .223 will be less expensive to feed than the Mosin.  Again, I think it depends on what you plan to use it for. I have one. I have used it to hunt. I took my first deer with it.   I have moved to a (stock, unaltered) K31 for woods hunting. I use my competition rifle for field hunting."

Firearms,3e1bv7,Baranyk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:34 2015 UTC,The K31 isn't a WWI gun. It was designed in 1931 and used in WWII. That's a full 40 years after the Mosin was designed. A better comparison would be the Krag-Jorgensen rifle.

Should be a much better rifle than your average Mosin and they're a bit rarer and therefore worth a bit more if you plan on selling it (please don't.) They're beautiful guns and shoot cheap ammo, so if you want to shoot it it's a great starter rifle.  Oh also, judging by the stock loops it might be Finnish ski trooper rifle."

I'm not sure I would call it racism so much as personal experience. A lot of my buddies are soldiers and they've got very little nice to say about Muslims because of the way they act in their own country, let alone how they act in nations like France, Germany, and Sweden.

They purposefully show you a certain angle on the website to try and avoid showing a full true profile of the glasses. Because the camera sticks out further than ya think and looks pretty dorky.  It's not like a flush pinhole camera.   But that's the trade off to get true HD at a proper framerate.  If you buy cheaper ones you'll find the framerate makes them garbage.  Many advertise ""HD"", but only if you're keeping your head perfectly still. As soon as you move everything becomes blurry and stutters.  Ya gotta spend the money to get a proper camera embedded.   I like my pivothead enough. But it's not something I wear normally in public. It's exclusively reserved for shooting, fishing, etc. So for me it's quite a bit of money to only come out a few times a month."

During the gunfight pictured, Taylor pulls his slide back after a round has already been chambered, which obviously would eject the round. At the end of the last episode (I won't name names for reason of spoilers) a character retrieves a handgun and hits the slide release, clambering a round, then proceeds to pull back the slide, which is useless and would have ejected a round.  Also, during the gunfight in question, a few times Rachel McAdams is almost aiming at the ground in front of her when the enemy is a good distance a way."
Firearms,3dzlt4,rhyno37,2,Mon Jul 20 23:27:08 2015 UTC,"This is probably due to two things:    The angle most likely looked lower than it actually was on camera.

I went to graduate school for physics. My undergrad research was in materials science; and my graduate thesis work was in astrophysics.    That being said, it's pretty rare for a physics-error in a movie to zap me out of my state of suspended reality.  I can even handle shotgun blasts blowing people off their feet; or cars exploding just because they've fallen off a cliff; or people with future-gats shooting visible laser beams.  ""Movie physics"" only bothered me when I was a know-it-all undergrad.  Once I advanced far enough in academia to realize I really didn't know anything at all, I just relaxed with movies and enjoyed them as the entertainment they're meant to be.  I think the same is true for every other physicist I personally know.  I mean, I know there are a few bloggers out there that really like finding bad-physics in movies; just like I know some people that peak under the wrapping of Christmas presents when no one's looking.  But why ruin the fun, ya know?    To word it another way: I'd guess to a rough approximation, most every movie has both an error in physics and a hole in the plot.  You don't actively look for plot holes, just like I don't actively look for bad physics.

It looks like he is in the ""high compressed"" or ""high ready"" mode but nobody would spread their fingers apart like that with the support hand. I'm thinking he just got tired of gripping properly or his fingers got sweaty during the shoot.

You have to take a training class, submit photos and fingerprints, you have to go to take a live fire test and qualify, $250 fee (one of the highest), you can't get one if you owe taxes or child support (because apparently being broke means you aren't entitled to self defense)."

And I think requiring a CCW permit to open our concealed carry is a good thing. It's a course that involves firearm education and accuracy tests. An uneducated, inaccurate gun owner can be more dangerous than a bad guy.   Nothing is stopping you from defending yourself if you owe back child support or taxes, you're only restricted in carrying concealed, which isn't a right, it's a privilege. CCW has not been presented or argued to be a right in any court case and its not stated in the Bill of Rights, so I'd doubt it'd hold up anyway. So the state restricting CCW permits until the applicant gets their shit straight doesn't seem that bad of an idea. They're demonstrating they've got money to spend on an expensive CCW process, firearms, ammunition, practicing, etc but are too broke to pay their bills. Doesn't jive."

Firearms,3dx1zr,superdude4agze,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:28 2015 UTC,"I'll copy from another comment I made  Texas is very restrictive as compared to all other states. There are 8 states that are ""may issue"" so that's a definite minority, besides there are also 8 states that are completely unrestricted-no permit or training required at all.  Texas has full reciprocity agreements with 30 states This alone is kinda enough to prove my point, since states will typically only agree to reciprocity if the requirements are as stringent or more stringent in the state seeking reciprocity. So 30 other states think Texas's licensing structure is as strict or stricter than theirs. The combination of the application fee and the instruction/qualification make the cost of initially obtaining a CHL for a civilian roughly $250, which is among the highest such costs among ""shall-issue"" states.  These are huge barriers to getting a license....texas is incredibly restrictive. The fact that in-person live fire testing is a part of it is enough. The fact that you have to submit fucking fingerprints and photos? Ridiculous!  Carrying a gun is not a privilege, it's generally regarded to be a right, putting it under your jacket doesn't really change anything. As for the taxes or child support issue-yes, you are being denied the right to defend yourself in a practical way in public merely because you don't have money. You shouldn't have to choose between paying the government and being able to protect yourself. It's ridiculous that texas charges so much too.  I don't know if you're from texas and you're protective of your reputation or something, but texas has tough gun laws relative to everywhere except the east coast and california. Additionally there's no Firearm Freedom law...if you want to be called permissive I think that's required."

There is no set rule that reciprocity means equal restrictions, so again moot.   It can be argued that instruction and qualification meets the ""well regulated militia"" part of the 2nd amendment, as an untrained group of armed individuals is by no definition a militia.   I cannot defend the photo and fingerprints requirement without playing devil's advocate, as I don't believe they are necessary since government issued photo ID is already required.   Keep and bear arms is the right, CCW is not. I urge you to find me the supreme court cases that state it is.   Paying taxes is law. Paying court ordered child support is law. It is well established that the violation of law is subject to the removal of rights. Are you suggesting all felons should be allowed to own firearms? You don't have to pay the government to defend yourself as they aren't charging you to own a gun, only to CCW, which isn't a right.   And the peaceable journey law applies to your public safety."

Yup. My point was to void your claim that ""shall issue"" made texas permissive in any way. It doesn't.    There is no set rule that reciprocity means equal restrictions, so again moot.   What? You can't just ignore my argument dude. It logically follows that State A will only reciprocate with State B if State B's laws are at least as strict. If you want to argue that that isn't true as a general rule, we can end this right here.    It can be argued that instruction and qualification meets the ""well regulated militia"" part of the 2nd amendment, as an untrained group of armed individuals is by no definition a militia.   Sure it can be argued, but not well, since ""well regulated"" meant well equipped. But again, that has nothing to do with whether or not Texas is restrictive or not. Stop taking tangents to argue for or against training. It's irrelevant.    I cannot defend the photo and fingerprints requirement without playing devil's advocate, as I don't believe they are necessary since government issued photo ID is already required.   You need to learn to debate. We're talking about whether or not Texas is restrictive. To do this you look at other states and what they require and compare it to texas to see if Texas has more or less restrictions. Stop looking at whether or not restrictions are a good idea.    Keep and bear arms is the right, CCW is not. I urge you to find me the supreme court cases that state it is.   Didn't know I needed a supreme court case to make an argument. that's a new one. Show me a supreme court case where CCW is said to be a mere privilege.    Paying taxes is law. Paying court ordered child support is law. It is well established that the violation of law is subject to the removal of rights. Are you suggesting all felons should be allowed to own firearms?    I definiely would argue that felons should be allowed to own guns. But that's besides the point, again. You keep trying to argue this is a good law or a bad law. It doesn't matter. It's a restriction. More restrictions than other states means texas is not a very gun friendly state relative to other states. Taking away the right to keep and carry guns in public to defend yourself based on your ability to pay your bills is a terrible policy, and one that I think would be found unconstitutional if ever challenged."

I didn't ignore it, you have no evidence to back up that reciprocity is based on like restrictions.   Regulated does not mean equipped, it means supervised.   It's not about debate (and you're one to talk with constant dismissiveness and conjecture), it's about what is and isn't restrictive. I agreed that photo and fingerprints are unnecessary.   It's in the second amendment, to keep and bear arms. Bear does not mean to conceal. The fact that it doesn't is the reason open carry even exists, because open carry has been proven to be covered under bearing arms. That has been the basis of every single open carry case. In fact I'm expecting Texas' CCW open carry requirement to be challenged soon because of its unconstitutionality.   No one is taking away your rights for being unable to pay your bills, you lose rights when you break the law. It's that simple. Trying to divert the argument by saying it's about being broke is just poor form and amateurish."

For example, Texas still has no open carry for pistols (until Jan 1, 2016, when it will require a CHL to do while most states do it permitless). Oregon has had it for ages without any license. Additionally, in Oregon, ""No Guns"" signs have no force of law unless posted on property on which it's already illegal to carry by state law. In Texas, one can acquire ""30.06"" signs which do actually have the force of law, even if the property is not unlawful to carry on by state law otherwise.  Texas is not nearly as lax as everyone seems to stereotype it as. Most of the country is usually more so."

But on moral grounds I absolutely cannot accept and so do not agree with the idea that it be mandated and therefore backed by violent enforcement (as any law is), and I reject mere consequentialism as justification for such violence.

It might sound shocking for many (not all) on this forum, but while I appreciate the intent behind it, I couldn't care less about the Constitution in any practical sense and don't use it as any kind of benchmark for liberty/morality/ethics/righteousness. It does not enter into my reasoning here.   Training is not mandated for firearm ownership, which is a right and would be infringed if required. However, CCW isn't a right and and is subject to applicable laws including training requirements in Texas.    This demonstrates an inconsistency in your logic. If you believe the 2nd amendment confers the right to own (keep) firearms upon citizens and that such a right would be infringed upon were any training mandated for it, you must necessarily also believe that the 2nd amendment confers the right to carry (bear) arms, and that mandated training would likewise infringe upon that right. They're together in the same clause, protected equally -- one cannot be an uninfringed right and the other permission. They must be considered together, whatever the conclusion, because they are listed as a single undivided right.  Again, the 2nd amendment isn't relevant to my reasoning, but you'd have to solve that conflict of reasoning for such a policy to make sense even taking that legislation into account."

I think Arizona non-resident permit is easier than Texas. The Texas CHL class must be completed in Texas, whereas AZ simply requires proof of competency, which can be a CCW permit or NRA class, possibly other things too.

I've never tried to get a CC permit but I did hear they make you take a firearms safety course and show you have some level of proper aiming (AKA did you hit the target or completely miss.) before they will issue it.  I have lots of family there that have their CC permit and the only issue is how long it takes for them to give you the permit.
Firearms,3dx1zr,bdnicho,8,Mon Jul 20 06:45:04 2015 UTC,"WA resident here who recently applied for a CHL in Multnomah county. You do not need to demonstrate your proficiency with firearms or any kind of accuracy test for the CHL. You only need to provide proof of some kind of safety training (e.g. military/LEO training, commercial self-defense training, membership in certain clubs or competitions, etc). If you don't have that, the Sheriff's office provides a 2-3 hour seminar that qualifies.  I found the Multnomah county Sheriff's office is actually quite CC-friendly. The CHL is only shall-issue for OR residents per the ORS, while the Sheriff's office may issue one to residents of border states at their discretion. I had to go through zero extra steps or fuss compared to the OR residents that were there, and the Deputy who taught the seminar was very much supportive of me getting the license.  The process itself is pretty simple. If you have some kind of formal training already then all you need to do is get a CHL application, fill it out, and wait for them to contact you to set up an appointment. I got an email the day after I turned in the application setting up my appointment for two weeks later. On that day, you just need to present two forms of ID, an original copy that establishes you've received handgun safety training, and the required fee in cash or card. They take your fingerprints on a digital scanner (required even if you've already had prints taken for any other reason), take a picture to go on the permit, collect the money, and out you go. You'll then receive your license by mail within 45 days. At the beginning of this July they estimated 3-4 weeks for processing.   The general public of the Portland area may not be as supportive as some other areas, but you'd be surprised who, individually, is. My class had maybe 40 people in it of all types. There was a woman probably in her 40s with her retired mother, there was a 20-something hippie chick, there were good ol' country boys and city slickers. It was actually quite awesome. However, it will be hard to find places to shoot due to lack of ranges and county ordinances that prohibit shooting on public land that is within the ""urban growth boundary"" or whatever they call it. This extends beyond actual city limits."

This subsection does not apply to or affect those listed in ORS 166.171 (2): ... • A person discharging a firearm in the course of target shooting on public land that is not inside an urban growth boundary or the boundary of a city, if the discharge will not endanger persons or property.

I have some gun nut family members that live in that area, you'll have no problem getting CC permit.  You do have to remember that even if you have your CC permit you can get kicked out of school if you carry on campus.  When you become a student you're signing a contract to also follow the schools code of conduct.  The code of conduct will say no guns.  Even though you legally have it, that contract stops you.  It's their property and their rules.  Just as you can legally tell someone with a CC permit and weapon that they can't come in your house armed, they can tell you you can't come on their property while armed."

Despite the recent addition of SB941 (background checks on private sales), Oregon is generally pretty gun friendly. No waiting period. No mag limits or bullet buttons (i.e. no Assault Weapons ban). NFA stuff (suppressors, SBR, full auto, etc.) is all A-OK. We have very good concealed carry laws and it is relatively easy to get a permit (shall issue). The majority of the state is open carry without issue (some cities, like Portland, require a CHL/CCW in order to do so, though). Lots of great public land to hunt and shoot on.

Firearms,3dugj0,Axemantitan,3,Sun Jul 19 16:19:42 2015 UTC,"Ankle Carry is just... Terrible. The weight gets to you at the end of the day, they're hard to get to, they chafe for a damn long time.... I digress.  S&W 442/642, or 637 if you need a Hammer. I carry a S&W Model 37 in my back pocket/belt when it's too hot out for my model 66 or my G17. The Airweights carry very nicely, but be prepared to dry fire it a few thousand times to get everything a little slicker internally/ a line on the cylinder.  If you get a ""Stainless"" model Airweight, I recommend blacking the front sight post, as it's a little difficult to pick up as they come stock. The boot grips they ship with will be among the better ""Carry"" grips you can get for them.  Ruger LCR/LCRx: Similar to the smiths, ugly as hell, generally good triggers, lightweight, .357 capability(stick with .38+P, .357 is like shooting 5.56 instead of .223 when it comes to snubbie Revolvers- UNLESS you have a longer than 2"" bbl and Gold Dot short barrel 135grn stuff. those are excellent.) and options to change out the front sight posts for changing POA/POI/ FuckICan'tSeeThisSghtINeedAFiberOpticASAP.   Taurus- no. Buy a Ruger or a S&W.   Charter Arms- Reports vary. Some say they rock, some say they suck. I have 0 time on one, but have heard constantly that they won't stand up to a high round count.  NAA Minirevolvers- Good little guns, shitty battery of arms. Truly  a weapon of last resort. .22 mag, .22lr. I would get the convertible one and carry with some Gold dot .22 mags. This is the gun that you can always have on you. You get 5 shots of a relatively shitty caliber, but they will go bang 90% of the time and still throw some lead. This would be my personal pick if Ankle Carry was my only other option.   Ruger SP101- Ruger's answer to the Model 60 smith. .357, heavy steel guns. Plenty of sights, grips, and holsters out there, and isn't too bad with .357s in it. It is a Mini-GP100. Would be terrible for ankle carry.  S&W Model 60/36- Heavier guns, the model 60 more so than the little brother in .38, the .36 Both are excellent and would serve, but I encourage an LCR or Airweight model for your purposes. .357 is not fun out of a 5-shot J-frame. I would suggest a good .38+P loading, such as Hornady Critical defense, Speer Gold Dot Short Barrel, or Winchester PDX1 defensive loadings. If an older S&W is to be used, DO NOT feed it +P, and use 158 grn bullets, as the older smiths are regulated for the heavier rounds. Lighter bullets will result in a significant POI shift. Anything else is fair game.   Speedloaders/Speedstrips- Carry at least one of these, just because you'll never know if you really need it. They will also be excellent when you start carrying your Revolver more than your .45, because you'll already be set up to do so. I like HKS/Safariland speedloaders myself, but the Speedstrips are also excellent."

Why go for a bulky, heavy revolver?  For a dedicated backup gun, especially on the ankle, you might be better served by looking at an LCP/Seecamp/P3AT/P-32.  All of those offer a DAO, revolver-like package, with much less weight and a thinner profile.  Just something to think about."

I'm just not as familiar with them as I am with pistols.   Whoa, whoa, whoa.   You're not as comfortable firing revolvers in general as you with firing pistols, and yet you want to wrap one around your ankle and depend on it as a backup?   No.   Two things: revolvers are bulky, and they don't carry much. They're cool enough and they can fire really big bullets, which is why you should get a full size Smith and Wesson 686 or a Ruger Blackhawk or something and practice with small pistols for your backup.   Pistols are flat, they're easier to wear, they have higher capacity, and it's a lot easier to reload under stress. That's what you should have for a backup.   Also, the ankle isn't the greatest place to put a backup weapon. Unless you're good at stretching and bringing your leg to your waist, you're going to end up crouching down or bending over and fumbling for your backup while taking your eyes off the bad guy or making yourself vulnerable. Consider a front pocket holster, or move around on your belt, or wear a shoulder holster for two guns. Something other than the ankle."

Firearms,3dv75c,Cletusvandayam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:01:49 2015 UTC,"I was kind of like you in that I knew I wanted a Henry (only one) and wanted to shoot it a lot, that means no rifle rounds $$$. I already had a 10/22 and I also thought I might want to use it for deer some day (though I never have) and so, I decided on the .38/.357. They are actually made from brass not gold or silver pot metal like the 22lr Henry, I got the octagon barrel and large loop too. It's a classic beauty and I love shooting it, I shoot .38 most of the time but it's fun to shoot the .357 on longer ranges. It has always been very accurate but I do long for some peep sites. Six years later I would have made the same decision, I'm very happy with it."

Firearms,3dtrhy,WikiWarrior55,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:02:03 2015 UTC,I've never hunted with it because it's mainly my bear gun when I go camping or out in the back country. It's damn accurate though. At the range it'll hit a target at 100 yards easy. I've read they'll shoot up to 200 yards. It's also the most fun gun that I own. Only problem is that the sabot slugs are expensive at about $3 a round. Ouch.

This is for people who want a new, quality firearm based off the classic and/or a well made platform to build and modify into something more than just a basic 1911. There's a large market for people looking for quality, cheaper single stack 1911's and there's a lot of manufacturers out there with similar guns as this one for sale. This is pretty much a range toy that some people will wish to actually carry, like the 1911 nuts or people who're willing to sacrifice magazine capacity for their preferred ergonomics."

Firearms,3dqz51,GhostalkerS,2,Sun Jul 19 06:31:19 2015 UTC,"I know the defense for steel rounds in higher calibers is that by the time the increased rot/wear on the barrel from using steel makes you have to replace it early, you've already paid for a new barrel with the money you saved and then some.    Is it the same with a round like a 22LR? I figure that most people will fire more of those than they would a higher caliber, thus increasing the rate of wear and tear.  I'm not sure how the waxing would affect this either so any insight anyone has on this would be interesting."
Firearms,3dqz51,L_Cranston_Shadow,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:35:28 2015 UTC,"I know the defense for steel rounds in higher calibers is that by the time the increased rot/wear on the barrel from using steel makes you have to replace it early, you've already paid for a new barrel with the money you saved and then some.    The increased barrel wear is due to the bi-metal jacket that steel cased rifle ammunition uses. It actually has nothing to do with the steel case. It's just that the Russian factories that use steel cases also use bi-metal jackets. So from a practical point of view, steel cased ammo wears more on your barrel, but it's not because of the steel case. It's due to the bi-metal jacket.  I don't know if it's the picture or what, but the bullets on this ammo look black. Maybe it's just a dark lead color in weird lighting. If that's the case, then steel cased ammo with lead bullets wouldn't wear down a barrel any faster than brass cased ammo with lead bullets. Then again, if those black bullets aren't pure lead but have some weird black coating that I've never heard of, then I don't know what that would do to a barrel."

Firearms,3dqz51,iambecomedeath7,3,Sat Jul 18 22:13:11 2015 UTC,"That's right. Projectiles go through turbulence as they break the sonic barrier, whether going supersonic or back to sub sonic.  In the case of 22 Long rifle ammo, it's more accurate if you keep it subsonic from the get-go.  If a projectile goes super sonic, it will happen while it is in the barrel so this is not a problem. When shooting high energy calibers such as 308, it's going to be super sonic. In that case you want your match ammo to stay supersonic until it hits the target."

Firearms,3dqz51,Captinfucker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:14:38 2015 UTC,"I thought you meant either a 50 or 100 round box. It was 5 100 rd boxes of CCI sv, roughly .09 a round I think plus shipping, but I'd rather have it to shoot and play with my new bolt action than just sit around aiming at trees and going pop pop"
Firearms,3dqz51,ktmrider119z,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:33:12 2015 UTC,Cci is the only ammo u will pay extra for but still not scalping prices. Cci mini mags and stingers are my jam. Their bricks of 500 lead round nose are the most consistent I've shot

Firearms,3dqz51,Thjoth,10,Sat Jul 18 22:41:13 2015 UTC,Is .22 LR in short supply in the states? We have fucktons of it over here in the UK.
Firearms,3dqz51,Paulingtons,2,Sat Jul 18 18:10:15 2015 UTC,Fuck ton of it in MA too. Maybe its easier to get in gun-unfriendly places.
Firearms,3dqz51,Thjoth,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"Not in CA, but it is getting a bit better."
Firearms,3dqz51,Paulingtons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:51:46 2015 UTC,Illinois.  Nope.
Firearms,3dqz51,PleaseStopCalling,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:58:57 2015 UTC,"Well you can't really compare the gun unfriendliness of MA to Illinois. Here they fingerprint you and get all your information down just for the ""privilege"" of being able to buy a gun, and being in possession of even a single shell casing without going through the permit process is  very illegal (and yes people are actually charged with that)"
Firearms,3dqz51,-SPADED-,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:43:01 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah.  MA is an outlier of pants on head retardation, but Chicago aint far behind."
Firearms,3dqz51,heathenyak,3,Mon Jul 20 22:58:27 2015 UTC,"Because it's the only semi-auto caliber available to civilians, probably."
Firearms,3dqz51,-SPADED-,5,Sat Jul 18 19:21:46 2015 UTC,"We are allowed .22 WMR and .22 HMR (.17 HM2) as well. Any .22 RF calibre. But semi-auto rifles/pistols aren't the most common firearm here as there's no real use for them. Most people own bolt actions in all calibres. The exception is stuff like Remington 597s used for plinking/lamping.  We do have self-loading 9mm/.243/.308s too using lock bolt lever rifles too. These fire a round, push the bolt back and lock it and to release the bolt you click a small lever with your thumb. Legal in all calibres and can be fired essentially just as fast as any semi-auto.  Ammo just isn't very expensive over here in general IMO."
Firearms,3dqz51,heathenyak,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:37:34 2015 UTC,What's the law like on flintlock rifles over there?  I've been very seriously considering applying to a graduate school in the UK but I'm also getting into shooting and building muzzle loaders semi-professionally so I have no idea how that would work.
Firearms,3dqz51,Doctor_Loggins,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:20:34 2015 UTC,"Flintlocks are firearms just like everything else but they are shot all around the country. If you become member of a club (takes six months) and get your FAC you can get flintlock rifles and essentially all muzzle loaders very easily.  Building them is a bit different, if you plan to sell them professionally you'd need a firearms dealer licence which can be difficult to get hold of but if it's only a ""hobby"" (and it is, right? ;)) then you'd have no issue.  Check out the Muzzle Loaders of Great Britain website.  Contrary to popular belief, over here you can own almost anything as long as you have a legitimate reason. The only 100% no-nos are handguns and semi-autos above .22 (full-autos too, obviously) if you discount the obvious stuff like RPGs!"
Firearms,3dqz51,Katapesh_Express,2,Sun Jul 19 12:17:06 2015 UTC,"Six months for a flintlock is a little crazy.  Over here they aren't even considered firearms, so you can just order them through the mail."
Firearms,3dqz51,ColonelError,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:21:44 2015 UTC,"It's the same for all firearms licensced under Section 1 of the Firearms Act. It doesn't matter if it's a matchlock rifle or a semi-automatic .22 LR M16 replica, a firearm is a firearm.  Bear in mind that's six months to get an FAC for target shooting as a member of a club. It's six months because the probationary period is six months and they won't give FACs to probationary members.  If you wanted an FAC for hunting/vermin control and you have land to shoot on you can apply and get one within a month or so.  In reality if you did join a gun club you'd have six months of probation where you use the club's guns, and the club's ammo, they teach you the basics and certify you as safe and after six months you become a full member and can apply for your FAC.  Once you have the FAC it's relatively easy to get whatever you want on it provided you have somewhere to shoot it. It depends on area and Police force but if you have somewhere to shoot a .50 BMG and are a member of a gun club you can request to legally own one and they will almost certainly give it to you."
Firearms,3dqz51,Datsahugebish,35,Sun Jul 19 23:25:50 2015 UTC,"Not short supply, just stupid artificially high demand. Since there was a run on the stuff after Sandy Hook, there have been people who have made an industry out of buying up all the stock up at traditional retail outlets and then flipping it for a profit online. Add to that people who hoard for various reasons (SOCIETY IS GOING TO FALL AND .22 WILL BE THE NEW CURRENCY), and the fact that regular people who are used to never seeing any in-stock will buy any normally priced ammo they see means that the shelves are always empty. All those factors put together have perpetuated the ""shortage"" of .22 for a couple years now, even though the manufacturers have been producing more than ever.  I can get any .22 I want, if I'm prepared to pay $0.15/round+ for it from some scumbag off gunbroker. If I want to pay reasonable prices for .22, I'd probably need to spend an entire afternoon driving around to all the stores in my area to scrounge up a couple hundred rounds."

Firearms,3dqz51,drebinf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:33:50 2015 UTC,You can buy it online all day for 9 cents a round.

Firearms,3dqz51,locolarue,7,Sun Jul 19 00:45:19 2015 UTC,"Holy shit $0.15 a round? That's insane! Over here you can get cheap plinking ammo for $0.04 a round, even great ammo that is basically match quality is only $0.10 a round, even cheaper bought in bulk.  So these prices are just the result of panic buying essentially? That's a shame. At those prices I bet it's cheaper to shoot other calibres lol."
Firearms,3dqz51,CaptainPaintball,2,Sat Jul 18 18:56:54 2015 UTC,Match ammo in .22 is 50 cents per round. Normal crap is 10 cpr if you're lucky u less you happen upon a store with some in stock. I've seen .22 long rifle in stock 3 times I. The last 3 years or so. And I haven't seen .22wmr at all in that time
Firearms,3dqz51,zZ_Mr_Hanky_Zz,3,Sun Jul 19 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"I've been paying .06-.07 per round for the last year or so. But I have enough (from before the madness) that I only buy it when I find it and the price is reasonable.  I'm in the upper midwest (near the Great Lakes - Michigan, Ohio, Indiana mostly (I travel a lot))"
Firearms,3dqz51,Zombiedrd,7,Sat Jul 18 19:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I haven't bought any online so the most I've paid is about $0.10 a round and it wasn't match ammo.   And I'm pretty sure retailers and distributors know that they can get away with pushing up their own prices now too, so major retailers like Cabela's (who had kept their prices steady) have recently started increasing their prices to about $0.07 for run-of-the-mill plinking rounds. In the long run, this might be a good thing if it can cut into the margins that gougers rely on for their scheme but only if the prices then settle back down to normal eventually, but that's wishful thinking.  Basically there was a real panic and run on the ammo after Sandy Hook -> gougers keep buying up all the supply after most of the panic subsides -> shelves are perpetually empty -> people keep buying from gougers -> gougers keep buying up all the supply -> ... so on and so forth.  If I could only get .22 at $0.15 a round, I would just shoot 9mm instead."
Firearms,3dqz51,LabronPaul,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:11:23 2015 UTC,The continuing madness is why I started reloading.
Firearms,3dqz51,Zombiedrd,6,Sat Jul 18 19:53:28 2015 UTC,Doesn't work that well for .22
Firearms,3dqz51,LabronPaul,8,Sat Jul 18 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"Well, you can reload 9mm for about $0.15 so if .22 costs that much, it makes sense to just shoot 9mm."
Firearms,3dqz51,elolna,2,Sun Jul 19 00:09:07 2015 UTC,Well at least people are buying ammo instead of gold. Too bad they haven't realized that gas will be the new currency.

Firearms,3dqz51,elolna,2,Sat Jul 18 17:00:09 2015 UTC,"I guess it's cheaper. I also suspect it might take a harder strike to set it off, although so far my dad (it's his ammo) has put about 150 rounds of it through his Baikal IZH35m Pistol and his Ruger 10/22 and it has been 100% reliable.  I suspect it's higher end stuff too since it shoots groups just as nice as CCI standard."
