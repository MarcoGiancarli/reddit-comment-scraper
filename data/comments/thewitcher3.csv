I like the environment more, the people are nicer, sailing is more integral to travel, and its  where the high level stuff is. When you liberate a village or do something for the local populace they react in a more appreciative way. On the continent you could save a village from an arch Griffin and they'll still spit at your feet."

thewitcher3,3dz53w,ALL_I_DO_IS_LURK1,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's kinda strange. One of the great things about the game is that it usually doesn't pressure you at all. Up to a certain point very late in the game you should be able to do almost all quests and contracts. There are only very few quests that are exclusive (meaning if you do quest A you can't do/fail quest B or vice versa), and these are all main quests, I think.  I think there are two possibilities:   This is different with the quests/contracts in the prologue (White Orchard). It's definitely not the case afterwards. In case you have the latest version (1.07) this could be a bug introduced by the patch. A lot of things broke."
thewitcher3,3dz53w,HereForTheFish,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:17 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat as OP. I've had 4 quests failed;  Novigrad Closed City - Novigrad, Precious Cargo - White Orchard, Fake Papers - Velen, Bitter Harvest - Velen,  I'm still on 1.05, I don't think 1.07 has been released over here in the UK."
thewitcher3,3dz53w,NuclearBase,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:32 2015 UTC,I failed fake papers because I accidentally let the guy get killed while dealing with the beasts - so the guy who hired me got really annoyed and refused to give me the papers to cross the bridge - maybe this is the reason you failed that and bitter harvest? Precious cargo is an exclamation point quest - i presume it has to be done pretty much straight away when you find it?
thewitcher3,3dz53w,secretcat18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:20 2015 UTC,OP here; you are saying exclamation point quests need to be done right after discovering them?
thewitcher3,3dz53w,secretcat18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong - I'm in no way a witcher expert. But I just think the exclamation point quests - if you start talking to the person they always seem like urgent things (e.g. help me, these people want to kill me). I just don't think it would make sense for you not to complete them then and there from an rpg standpoint."
thewitcher3,3dz53w,NuclearBase,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:38 2015 UTC,"They don't have to be done right away. But I tend to do them straight away as they will, most of the time, be near by."
thewitcher3,3dz53w,TitoOliveira,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:00 2015 UTC,"Some ""exclamation quests"" remain there for the entirety of the game, and some are accidental. Once i passed by someone asking for help on the road with an exclamation point, after riding by it i decided i should go back and help but the person wanst there anymore and there were no exclamation point."
thewitcher3,3dz53w,NuclearBase,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:56:16 2015 UTC,Same with the dwarfs after I saved dandelion. The exclamation point is there but I can't get the quest from him.
thewitcher3,3dz53w,DrDroop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:59:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I bought the game digitally on Saturday. I'm assuming the  the patch would have come with it or auto-installed? I haven't seen a prompt for it."
thewitcher3,3dz53w,TitoOliveira,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"Some are like this. Also, you'll come across some branching paths where you can do quest A or quest B. Depending on which one you do first you'll automatically 'fail' the other. Not a huge deal really cause it wouldn't make sense to do the same thing twice but with different people.  1.07 has been released worldwide I believe."
thewitcher3,3e0eep,tremulous,3,Tue Jul 21 00:10:09 2015 UTC,"It almost certainly is an issue with your specific windows install.  I had an infinite hang issue with CIV 5.  Upgraded from vista to 7.  Still had the issue.  Repaired windows.  Nada.  Then did a fresh install of vista which I upgraded to 7 on a different drive.  Problem went away.  It was one of those things where every vendor says ""dude I have no idea"" after you talking to every component and program manufacturer, and this is coming from a guy who knows how to edit a registry on the fly to kill an infection that's actively trying to defend itself by splitting off and renaming itself in real time. Windows is strange, pray to the deep ones, get a new hard drive (so you don't lose anything) and do a fresh install.  Steam has a feature where you can tell it ""yo there's this shit already installed on this other drive"" so you don't have to worry about reinstalling any of your games.  If you're on a laptop this will all be harder."
thewitcher3,3e0eep,deconite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:54:44 2015 UTC,"So what you're recommending would be to get a new hard drive, install my operating system, and then make that my new boot drive?"

thewitcher3,3e0eep,Rocknro111a,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:46:52 2015 UTC,"Just for perspective, I have an r9 290x, 8gb ram, i5 4570 @ 3.2, Samsung evo 120gb ssd boot drive with windows 8.1 x64. If you are running 8.1 it should be fine.  A few questions: Did you buy it off steam? If so is your steam install folder rooted on the same disk as steam is installed on? If you didn't buy it off steam, is it a legit copy? Have you tried installing it on your primary boot drive. If you've done that have you tried copy pasting the .exe to desktop and running it as administrator? Because the game is newer I don't think you can change the compatibility package; I checked the sub menus and couldn't find anything in that regard. Also have you installed the newest update? 1.6 is stable but I've heard that 1.7 is a bit fucky. Maybe try reverting back to 1.6.  IMO I would say put your saves on a USB or somewhere safe. Uninstall then reinstall the game on the same disk as the installer (steam, GOG, whatever) or just install it on your OS drive, C: or whatever it is. Also the game is 64 bit only so don't install it in the x86 program file root folder. Then copy paste the exe from the install root folder to the desktop and run it as administrator. Run it on stock settings to make sure it works then crank up the fidelity. And also all the standard shit; are your drivers updated, are you running resolution in the game that corresponds with your display, are you running mods?, uninstall them and retry.  It's a bitch running diagnostics on a game install, I know, but with this game it's worth it. You've got a powerful system so its nothing to do with that, I just think it's something simple, like how it was installed, it always is. You'll figure it out man, just do the diagnostics. It's a killer game and its absolutely worth figuring out the problem. Good luck! Hope I helped!"

I have everything on Ultra and 1440p with exceptions to Hairworks on 0AA and low as well as Foliage View Distance to High instead of Ultra. I am on an R9 290 and with these settings I average around 43FPS which is really smooth on my new MG279Q with freesync.
thewitcher3,3dw3qs,DrDroop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:06:59 2015 UTC,"What card? I'd suggest grabbing the latest drivers and uninstalling the old ones with Display Driver Uninstaler (DDU for short). Once done, install the latest drivers you had already previously downloaded and you should be good to go.

thewitcher3,3drl5w,cdrewsr388,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:45:57 2015 UTC,"You're probably right that it was planned. I wish CDPR would've mentioned this. At a minimum, you shouldn't have to lose access to the armor that you're wearing if you happen to switch out of it. The armor should've been ""grandfathered"" in. Having said that, why did they decide to nerf the Witcher gear?? Yeah, it's better than most common sets of armor at the same level, but not overwhelmingly so. Usually, it's only better by 1-2 levels. The fact that you have to take the time to find the diagram for it and make it seems like an appropriate reward for slightly better armor. I don't think they've changed the defensive numbers of the armor (I'll have to check this), only the leveling requirements. If that's the case, what's the point of looking for the armor unless you're trying to get a trophy for collecting it? It's not really better than any other armor."
thewitcher3,3drl5w,cdrewsr388,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:06:39 2015 UTC,"I see it as more of  looks thing.  They look better, excusing the Griffin, than most armor.  At level 36 even on death March the armor is for looks for me."

thewitcher3,3dqwws,Mushashi7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:02:24 2015 UTC,They changed the FOV and moved the centering of Geralt when you zoom (witcher senses). It gives you a feeling of being drunk. You 'sway' from center to left side and back again. The idea is in general good as Geralt moves a bit to the side to let you see better. I'd prefer a thing in the middle of the new movements and the old one.

I've been struggling with trying to stop looting everything, but it's hard.  Mostly because I need 5-6 formulas that are totally random.  But also because I just have the impulse to loot everything.  I'm level 30 with 70k coin and close to 90lbs of crafting mats.  You can buy the mats and craft the assassin pants and turn a profit, money is meaningless."
thewitcher3,3dmc2z,frgtmypwagain,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:44:17 2015 UTC,Level 36 here. I'm running into similar issues. I've noticed merchants and blacksmiths don't have as much coin as they used to.

I primarily use the igni sign, and that combined with strong attacks is extremely efficient. While enemies are on fire you get about a 5 second window and or 1 free shot before they can attack you again. So when an enemy is on fire I line myself up with their backs for extra damage and hit them with a strong attack, followed by a quick attack if necessary."

I don't do that anymore now i only pick up the blue and beyond and because i found another way of getting money, i have a recipe of assassins trousers, is an orange item, dont know where i got it, but it takes very common materials and 30 gold to make, and sells for 300 gold a piece, so its a nice way to craft and sell, until the merchant has no money.  I use a set of griffon armor, that i got with tresure hunt, i like it so far. and it was fun getting the recepies. Notice that the ""witcher"" gear is way better than normal gear. early on i got a perk that gives health during day time it helped a lot, and some people get the queen second ability that heals based on the damage it absorbs. I don't know the dificult you are playing on, but try to no got head on, its good to see what moves they have and parry and dodge acording. Besides using the beastiary is very helpfull get the monsters weakeness and everything.    hope i helped you, anymore tips i remember i will be sure to post"
thewitcher3,3dk4s2,IvanBassi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:03:59 2015 UTC,What treasure hunt did you do for the griffin armor? I found a quest for a treasure hunt but don't know where to go to start it or anything. If it's the same one maybe you could help me out by telling me.
thewitcher3,3dk4s2,IvanBassi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:32:25 2015 UTC,"It says in the quest name that is the griffin, so its probably not.  You can track the quests so you know where to go, just hit J and find the quest, track it, it will tell you what to do."
thewitcher3,3dk4s2,Kookle_Shnooks,2,Fri Jul 17 01:26:19 2015 UTC,"You don't have to keep old contracts. I sell them since they take up inventory space that I have to scroll through. There is a patch coming out very soon that introduces storage, so you can just wait till that and store them if you want.   The best way to make money is selling loot. Good places to get loot are at the question marks on the map. Places like bandit camps and guarded treasures usually have chests of high level items which sell for a lot. I'm fairly late in the game, but every time I sell my loot I need to go to 3 or 4 merchants, and make about 5000 each time. As far as armor, the best armors in the game are arguably  the witcher gear. For me, once I started collecting and upgrading witcher gear, all other armor became irrelevant. So don't waste a lot of time early in the game with common armors. For restoring health in battles food is an option, as is the swallow potion. Theres also a potion to look out for called ""white raffard's decoction,"" which will immediately restore a large amount of health. As you travel make note of how much merchants buy items for and how much money they have to spend. One merchant may pay you 500 for an item, while another pays you 50 for the same thing. Don't hold on to every cool sword you find. Try to get as many oil diagrams as possible. You can find them as random loot and also buy them from alchemists throughout the world. Once you craft them you have them forever."
thewitcher3,3dk4s2,IvanBassi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:40:45 2015 UTC,"yes ! normaly that merchant thing is not an issue because it only diverges like 5 gold, but if you try to sell a good sword to a normal merchant he will pay 50, if you go to the blacksmith he will pay a lot more, 500 like you said.   I noticed that its like that for armors and swords but dont know about other things.."

thewitcher3,3dcadn,Fireman2085,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:11:51 2015 UTC,By dialogue choice you mean you screwed both of them?
thewitcher3,3dcadn,infiniZii,2,Fri Jul 17 16:55:59 2015 UTC,You're a terrible father.
thewitcher3,3dcadn,patterninstatic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:04:39 2015 UTC,No kidding. You literally have to not have faith in Ciri multiple times for this to happen.
thewitcher3,3dcadn,patterninstatic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:51:26 2015 UTC,"Some of them are really not that obvious.  Having a drink with Ciri instead of the snowball fight, Telling her to calm down in the lab, and tagging along for the lodge meeting, it's pretty easy to make these wrong choices. The only obvious ones are not taking the money from the emperor and letting her visit Skjall's grave, but if you accidentally miss the first three you're already stuck with the bad ending."
thewitcher3,3dcadn,Artificis_Vix,2,Fri Jul 17 17:03:06 2015 UTC,"There are three main endings.... Sorry to say that you got what is mostly considered as the ""bad"" ending."
thewitcher3,3dayfz,Aniform,3,Tue Jul 14 21:32:41 2015 UTC,"The Ursine set can be upgraded until you get to (I believe) Mastercrafted (or is it masterwork.... no matter) level. Standard < Enhanced < Superior < Mastercrafted. You need to use the previous level armor in the crafting of the next level, so dont get rid of them."
thewitcher3,3dayfz,infiniZii,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:43:33 2015 UTC,"No, I have the set fully upgraded, I'm still receiving gear better than. I just don't see any perk of keeping a set together."
thewitcher3,3dayfz,infiniZii,2,Tue Jul 14 21:48:32 2015 UTC,"Ah, if you already have them fully upgraded then its really just a matter of choice. I went with the Griffin armor set personally (your stamina does not recharge as slowly as the heavy armor stuff and you still get decent armor... but thats just my preference). If you have found other stuff that is better then go for it. I would suggest waiting until the next patch comes out and just storing the witcher gear you are no longer using there in the stash and not simply selling it though."
thewitcher3,3dayfz,Joebroni555,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:54:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks, wasn't sure if I was just missing something that made it advantageous.  Is there a stash? Mind filling me in?"
thewitcher3,3dayfz,infiniZii,4,Tue Jul 14 21:59:08 2015 UTC,"Yep stash coming in 1.07. And AFAIK there are no set bonuses unfortunately. I still wear matching sets because I'm usually choosing a set based on the build and what passives my armor gives me. Like when I tried a heavy sign build I wore all Griffen for sign intensity bonuses. Generally I preferred the feline set because I rocked light attack, fast stamina regen and quen."
thewitcher3,3dayfz,joab777,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:47:59 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks again for all the insight into this. Sometimes not sure if I'm doing things right."

thewitcher3,3dayfz,infiniZii,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:09:09 2015 UTC,"Are you referring just to defensive stats b/c the mastercrafted armor has other stats that often make them the best regardless, like sign intensity etc.  And even on Death March wearing the MC feline set, I'm not having much trouble getting hurt. Love the advantages though of having more stamina regeneration and more."

I chose her anyway as they seem to have this strong bond, but to be honest I don't much like her personally :D  As for the time requirement, you can run off and do as many sidequests as you like, but don't do the main story mission, as above."
thewitcher3,3d3pqa,coloradopowpow,2,Mon Jul 13 07:27:04 2015 UTC,Same thing happened to me. It's in his room in Kaer Muir. it actually showed up for me as part of the quest and on the map.

thewitcher3,3d2c10,stcguitar1,8,Sun Jul 12 23:27:32 2015 UTC,I enjoyed dragon age but it got dropped like a bad habit once witcher 3 was released
thewitcher3,3d2c10,Carlos13th,2,Mon Jul 13 00:49:16 2015 UTC,"The only comparison is lore, but then to me Witcher has a more compelling story."
thewitcher3,3d2c10,TweakedCulture,3,Mon Jul 13 01:16:32 2015 UTC,I personally think witcher is the better game in every way. Not that dragon age isnt worth playing. It's just whenever I pick up dragon age I just think I would prefer to be playing witcher three first.
thewitcher3,3d2c10,Carlos13th,5,Mon Jul 13 01:59:36 2015 UTC,IMO dragon age: inquisition is crap when compared to TW3.  Specially gameplay wise...
thewitcher3,3d2c10,Nacoluke,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:14:28 2015 UTC,"I liked every second of Dragon Age: Inquisition, but i like the witcher 3 even more, especially the combat and the side quests."

thewitcher3,3d2bfa,winstonl,3,Sun Jul 12 23:21:52 2015 UTC,"Me either. Sounds like this author doesn't like things that make open world rpgs so great. The world is bland. Wtf! It made a few improvements from 2, but falls hot in many ways.  He wants a streamlined rpg. Well, I dont. This game is absurdly good. The questing and story are unparalleled. And I actually like the crafting and alchemy being part of the game. Though, ya dont have to use it. Dudes gonna hate Fallout 4 now. I actually wished it was deeper and that the school gear didn't make everything else irrelevant.  To each their own. I think it's a masterpiece. The new patch will fix the inventory, and hopefully a ng+ will up the difficulty b/c even DM is quite easy."
thewitcher3,3d2bfa,joab777,2,Mon Jul 13 05:28:06 2015 UTC,Don't really agree with this at all. Some of my most memorable moments were exploring random castle ruins guarded by cyclops or a random island in skellige without even a point of interest but a giant tree and swarms of birds.   Exploring this game is beautiful and even though I'm not finished with the first play through I am likely to go explore every POI in my second.   Only thing I was to improve for my second play through is to find a mod to make it much more challenging and also finding relic gear like 8 levels under me gets on my nerves.
thewitcher3,3d2bfa,Arc-arsenal,2,Mon Jul 13 05:08:55 2015 UTC,This website isnt known for articles people agree with. I usually expect them to be badly opiniated.
thewitcher3,3d2bfa,CIAdaniel,2,Mon Jul 13 08:57:05 2015 UTC,"Their criticism of Destiny was pretty spot on, and was generally in-line with that Reddit community. But it does seem like Forbes tends to have contentious opinions as a base rule for gaming articles."

I killed her the first time then went back and talked her out of it. She helps you once more later in the game as long as you don't kill her"

thewitcher3,3d1y2x,HanSoulo77,6,Sun Jul 12 21:33:12 2015 UTC,"Because they don't have a release date with a high enough confidence. And if they give one and miss it, then there will be uproar.  My guess is at least another week."
thewitcher3,3d1y2x,DaRKoN_,0,Sun Jul 12 22:11:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, uproaring is very popular these days. (Shame on me!!!) But IMHO you can´t release the patchnotes (which indicates it is ready to go), tease people and then wait for another one or two weeks to finally release it! - Then they should wait until they HAVE the confidence or split the patch in stuff that is done for 1.07 and things that they are unsure of or need polishing for the next ONE!!!"
thewitcher3,3d1y2x,DaRKoN_,2,Mon Jul 13 06:08:09 2015 UTC,"which indicates it is ready to go   No, it doesn't. It indicates what they are working on for this development phase - not what is complete and ready to go."
thewitcher3,3d1y2x,ROHRAA,-1,Mon Jul 13 06:14:42 2015 UTC,"Mmmh, sounded different to me in the forums but OK!!! -Then what is the point in showing all the good things that WILL BE in the next patch and then let the people wait? - Do i really need to know two weeks before just to prepare myself for it.

thewitcher3,3d1y2x,xellsys,3,Mon Jul 13 06:00:18 2015 UTC,"I've faced no problems at all on the PS4. The game is buttrry smooth, Just very Minor FPS drops near the highly detailed areas on the map. 1.07 should fix that too in a couple of days."

thewitcher3,3czf37,Captain_RoFl,5,Sun Jul 12 04:21:20 2015 UTC,I think Viggo Mortensen would play the hell out of that role. we haven't really seen him play a character as stoic as geralt but I'm positive he could pull it off with ease. he has the perfect build and physique and is already pretty skilled with swordplay.
thewitcher3,3czf37,Bruhmis,4,Sun Jul 12 04:51:13 2015 UTC,Not a bad choice. I think Charlie Hunnam looks just like Geralt tho lol
thewitcher3,3czf37,Ricky_Droschmidt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:13:35 2015 UTC,"I thought about this too a few times. though he's much too young and he'd need to lose a bit of bulk before he'd make a convincing Geralt. I'm also unsure of his ability to portray the coldness and stoicism that geralt has, he just has a really warm and friendly way about him."
thewitcher3,3czf37,Bruhmis,2,Sun Jul 12 06:14:22 2015 UTC,Yea but you're gonna have a hard time finding a face that looks as similar

I acted like a manwhore through the entire game and pretty much had sex with every woman that I met, including Triss and Yen. I think it might have to do with when you do it too. When I did it I first romanced Keira, then when I continued to Novigrad I ploughed Triss and later on in the game I did the same with Yen. In the end Geralt ended up with Yen."
thewitcher3,3cx8nq,Axiebraxie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:28:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. Not sure what the intricacies are, but I was the same way on my first play. I fully-committed to Yen and did some ploughing, and then I went full-romance with Triss up until the lock-in choice. And even then, I took the just-below-I-love-you route. Didn't get to plough Triss, tho. I think they'd fixed whatever problem they used to have with that. Then when I did Yen's story, I realized I actually liked Yen and went full-blast for her and got just her in the end. She's a bitch, but she loves me, side hoes and all.  I had glorious plans to go hard with Triss on my second play thru as Geralt What a Prick, but I'm having trouble after reading up on the BG of Triss and Yen. Stupid game with its stupid characters I actually care about."
thewitcher3,3cx8nq,Artificis_Vix,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:12:18 2015 UTC,I beleive that you can only romance one or the other. I think you can slightly romance as long as you don't plough her.  If you plough triss then you dont get yen later as they both find out!

Honestly, I wish you could sponsor the rebuilding of some of the castles/forts in the Witcher - like, Geralt could buy a ruined fort as Witcher property and pay various trades to do the repairs and improvements. There's alot of them in great locations with minimal structural damage that are just begging to be restored and used.   I'm especially surprised that some of the NPC factions aren't rebuilding the forts/castles because of the war being on. At the very least I'd expect that the people in Skellige would be rebuilding and arming their castles/forts in case of Nilfgaardian invasion. The most analogous example I can give would be Japan during early WW2 as Skellige is similarly made of islands with many having fortifications to prevent invaders from gaining a foothold."

thewitcher3,3ckbpl,jumie83,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:35:09 2015 UTC,Yea Alchemy is the more broken late game tree mainly due to delayed reaction (infinite potions duration).
thewitcher3,3ckbpl,Ulion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:10:09 2015 UTC,Would you explain your build? I'm interested.
thewitcher3,3ckbpl,dnapol5280,2,Thu Jul 9 12:36:19 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but the alchemy skill I've found most useful is Acquired Tolerance.  It lets you actually use multiple decoctions and potions at the same time, which is very powerful once you have options.  Otherwise I do an alchemy/combat hybrid.  Other alchemy skills of note (IMO) are Refreshment and Tissue Transmutation.  If I went more alchemy heavy I'd probably slot Synergy and Adaptation, and perhaps play around with Delayed Recovery.  I then have the first three Battle Trance skills, the second Defense, and first two Strong Attack.  Makes for a tanky build when combined with Ursine gear.  I rock Blizzard and Thunderbolt potions.  The Ekhidna Decoction is generally helpful as well, although somewhat redundant with Refreshment, and Archgriffin is overpowered.  I like this build though because you can change things up based on what decoctions you use and what potions you equip.  Alternatively, you could go Fast Attacks with Cat gear and much the same build (different decoctions though).  I'd imagine a stricter alchemy only would make use of the bomb line, but I'd just be guessing as to those builds."
thewitcher3,3ckbpl,Ulion,2,Fri Jul 10 16:54:12 2015 UTC,"So far I have tested full builds using each tree and my 3rd play through atm. Alchemy is the best late game tree, Signs are good early game, and Combat it is the most difficult one I have played since it takes awhile to get ursine gear to increase your adrenaline gains.   Key traits:   Alchemy - delayed reaction give infinite potion duration and cluster bombs kill a wave of enemies with one bomb.  Combat - Whirl hit all enemies around you twice as fast as a fast attack. Have to hold the button after you do a fast attack when you have full stamina. Deadly precision attack a skull enemy for 1m get it 95% next hit its dies.  Signs - Have not completely explored various sign traits only used a quen/axii build. The Final Axii trait is not worth it since you have to cast Axii twice to effect 2 enemies."
thewitcher3,3ckbpl,Molohk,2,Thu Jul 9 12:27:57 2015 UTC,"I've done two walkthroughs on death march, first one was a light attack build with light armor, and second one was a sign build with medium armor. Both builds felt very solid, but by far the sign build felt much stronger.  The sign build had all points invested into the sign tree, first focusing in Axii, then Quen and Igni. Igni became the strongest, after reaching the third tier I could crowd control and kill entire groups of enemies with 2 or 3 ignis, without even using my swords. Quen's second tier was useful at first, as a healing option but not needed mid-later game. Axii was easy mode for slowly killing enemy groups from afar, and even for bosses. In short, at level 12 I already had enough stamina regen and sign intensity to feel extremely overpowered.  Light attack build focused mostly on this column, until whirlwind. Some abilities in other columns for parrying arrows and other auxiliary stuff. Yes, whirlwind is very powerful (if the enemy doesn't move out of your path) and it looks awesome, but it made me vulnerable to attacks and it suffered the same weakness as all melee (it sucks against shielded and parrying enemies). Eventually, for tougher fights, if I used ekimmara decoction and whirlwind I was practically immortal (this also works with sign build). AoE is definitely a flaw in melee builds, even with whirlwind.  I'm probably biased, since I'm not too happy with the melee system in W3, but if you want to feel like a beastly monster killer, I definitely recommend a full sign build, it has insane damage and great crowd control, both single target and AoE, and it doesn't suffer from any of the melee flaws."

thewitcher3,3ckbpl,-Dervish,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:30:33 2015 UTC,The quen upgrade which heals you when enemies hit your shield is really good imo. I always thought aard was good after a few points as it knocks enemies down so you can execute them. If you're playing on death march I think you should probably skip axii. With all the damage you'll probably be taking in death march I think quen upgrades are the best choice.
thewitcher3,3ckbpl,biznizza,2,Wed Jul 8 19:58:24 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Axii has a lot of benefits. It makes some quests easier, it is incredible in 1v1 situations (mostly against larger enimies and I know it's not as effective in some cases, but at the same time it still allows you get to easy heavy attacks in.) It's also strong in ground situations as it can allow you to quickly execute some one, or knock someone off a horse. I would rather it over aard."

thewitcher3,3cazi7,rockstarleopard,2,Mon Jul 6 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"I remember very early in the game I was in the tavern in White Orchard. Suddenly the door violently busts open. I was expecting some sort of fight to ensue, but instead in walks a cat..."
thewitcher3,3c8299,Nize,4,Sun Jul 5 19:48:21 2015 UTC,"Great idea, but pls make this post in /r/witcher  This sub here is semi dead.  It deserves more than this."

But I don't know, ever since finding out theres a glitch that prevents me from defeating this boss, I don't look forward to gathering potions and leveling up. I just hope a new update comes and hopefully it would fix it."
thewitcher3,3c8iq8,FunkyJStuff,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:58:18 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same problem for the Xbox one. It sounds like 1.07 has some ""movement updates"", so hopefully they'll have that bug fixed."
thewitcher3,3c8iq8,CWjr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:20:29 2015 UTC,I was expecting the latest update to fix this because people have had this slow motion glitch even before the latest update

thewitcher3,3c8bib,Jzlo_O,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:05 2015 UTC,I feel zero remorse robbing everyone in the game of everything they own. They call me mean names so I kill em and take their shit. I helped out that Elf blacksmith in Novigrad and that sword was bunk so now I'm just on a terror rampage.
thewitcher3,3c8bsp,fus10n75,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"If you're asking what I'm assuming you're asking. Then yes. Cause how I see it, Geralt is like, 20-30 in Witcher years, so it's not creepy, not too creepy anyway."
thewitcher3,3c8bsp,Whitefang131,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:09:35 2015 UTC,"I think people take age discrimination way too seriously with regards to whether Geralt would bone Cerys (or anyone else younger than him but still 16+). In this period of time the average life expectancy is probably lower than today, pushing down the age at which one is viewed as an adult, plus their social standards are definitely different than ours. I think Geralt would bone Cerys. In fact, the only woman I'm sure Geralt wouldn't bone is Ciri because he sees her as his daughter of sorts."
thewitcher3,3c5bm0,fus10n75,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:02:28 2015 UTC,i had this problem.  I fast traveled away and back and then used Aard on the wall and it worked.  I may also work with Aard anyway if you smashed it with your sword.

thewitcher3,3c4rsm,ShagBeard,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:51:18 2015 UTC,Yeah just go to a blacksmith and as long as you have a recipe you should be able to craft one.
thewitcher3,3c4rsm,illage2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:29:12 2015 UTC,You should gather materials and craft a new one.  Just don't sell the sword ever again unless you get a better silver sword.
thewitcher3,3c4rsm,Jazjustice,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:56:07 2015 UTC,Buying swords is expensive.  U might be able to craft one?  Sounds like u r very early in the game.  Do u have a prior save point u can go back to?

thewitcher3,3by07b,TommyWiseau565,2,Fri Jul 3 02:21:30 2015 UTC,"Damn, I bad no idea this happened. While it makes some sense that some chapters would move after the final evemts, it sucks that they are just completely gone."
thewitcher3,3by07b,BananaHouse,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:13:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even the characters that would make sense to stay or be around are gone as well."
thewitcher3,3by07b,Amunium,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:20:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed. After I completed it the first time, I quickly restarted and postponed the main quest as much as possible. While you can still take quests after the story is over, I no longer have any interest in the world at that point.  I feel like, especially given this is supposedly the last we see of Geralt, that Witcher 3 really needs something like the Mass Effect 3 Citadel DLC. A chance to just hang out with the characters and say goodbye before the whole thing is over. It just happened way too fast in TW3."
thewitcher3,3by07b,badongos,2,Sun Jul 5 09:34:12 2015 UTC,Yes! This would be amazing.
thewitcher3,3by07b,Whitefang131,2,Sun Jul 5 17:35:56 2015 UTC,Well I guess that's how Geralt's life is most of the time when it's just another regular day
thewitcher3,3by07b,devillived,2,Mon Jul 6 06:13:26 2015 UTC,"On the CDPR forums, CDPR has responded, they've said little, explaining that  what we ask of them is difficult (that said people were asking for more dialogue with them, so understandable) but it does seem like they're going to work on it after they've added to Triss."

thewitcher3,3bu0e9,fendernation,3,Thu Jul 2 03:34:04 2015 UTC,This scene was so damn good. I actually wanted to go to bed but I HAD to play this through completly first. It was just hilarious!
thewitcher3,3bu0e9,MooMooMadness,2,Thu Jul 2 14:08:52 2015 UTC,"I just did that part last night, hilarious. Though I hope the option of playing Gwent didn't have a chance at a unique card. I was saving that option for last but Eskel's drunk-ass had to run off and pass out."
thewitcher3,3bu0e9,Bandin03,2,Thu Jul 2 18:33:49 2015 UTC,I think the best part was when Yen showed up like mom catching you and your friends creating disaster.

thewitcher3,3bu0e9,tacon8,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:13:55 2015 UTC,I agree with so much here. Funny stuff. I like and hate Lambert all at once. He's well written and voiced to fit his personality. Drunk Geralt is pretty awesome too.

thewitcher3,3br1a4,HafroThunder,2,Wed Jul 1 13:29:22 2015 UTC,So is the werewolf dead or human again?
thewitcher3,3br1a4,arcus483,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:59:27 2015 UTC,Well there's the werewolf quest which is what I was doing.  And then there's the Nameless quest which I'd already completed.  I did the werewolf one fine. Turned him human then killed him.  But the issue is I inspected something related to the other quest and it reactivated it for some reason.  But now it's blank cause I've technically done everything and won't complete. :-/
thewitcher3,3bqccb,bigups43,2,Wed Jul 1 08:08:11 2015 UTC,I don't understand why they aren't as powerful as the story makes them out to be.

thewitcher3,3bid4x,popeye44,3,Mon Jun 29 19:13:59 2015 UTC,Omg how did you steal from the chest? :o Did you lure him away?  And was it any valuables?
thewitcher3,3bid4x,popeye44,2,Mon Jun 29 19:27:01 2015 UTC,"yea, Decent sword I think..(at that point the sword was higher level than me) I walked in while he was not facing me.. ran like hell when I got the loot hehe. I've done the same thing on multiple (??) creatures."
thewitcher3,3bid4x,Arc-arsenal,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"The loot auto scales to your level. It's a good idea but poorly done, as 95% of the time it auto scales to like 6 levels lower than me, even when i load and save most of the time I just give up because unless I get lucky the first couple of loads it just takes way too long. It's one of the only things I really don't like about this game, spend a bunch of time trying to go through ruins, killing epic monsters just to  find a super awesome looking sword with cool stats that does 40 less dps than my already under leveled gear."

Great game though. There just seems to be a lack of ""Butt Kicking Boots of Doom"" type loot. (I do have some level 28-30 etc sword recipes/designs)"
thewitcher3,3bid4x,SquishyShrimp,0,Tue Jun 30 13:45:26 2015 UTC,Yup. This is pretty much the exact way it went down when I first ran across this leshen.

I spent like 10m whittling him down, he was probably at 25% life left, and then he summoned 2 wolves, of his same level. I just had to NOPE out of there. Those wolves chased me for a long time and kept harassing me when I was in the area later doing other quests.     They all got theirs several levels later."

thewitcher3,3bk4xp,tijger897,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:47:30 2015 UTC,There are containers littered about the game that have loot but there is no way to get to them. They are just decorative/visual only items that just happen to have loot in them. I don't know if this is one of those situations you are running into so I am just letting you know there are some you cannot reach. TIP: Aard can also help you get to loot that is buried under boards or behind stone spikes in caves.

I just started a 2nd playthrough on Death March instead.   I will say, if you want to see the other endings, go check out YouTube. That's what I did once I finished and after seeing all of the outcomes, I liked mine and felt it was definitely what Geralt would have done. Saves you tons of time doing it that way."

thewitcher3,3bi9qw,FaustEchoes,3,Mon Jun 29 13:16:57 2015 UTC,"There is one point after which you may or may not be able to do some sidequests anymore. The game tells you with a popup beforehand, so no worries."
thewitcher3,3bi9qw,M0d3y,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:24:26 2015 UTC,"There is no point of no return? If the areas are open to you, you can go wherever, whenever you want. There are some really high level fights in some of the earlier places you visit and you will not be able to beat them. You will have to go back at a later time after you have leveled up, to be able to complete those quests. Its great being able to go anywhere you want at any time. Every mission just gets put on pause waiting for you to return to it. BTW, you have a very long way to go before you get to the end of the main story."
thewitcher3,3bi9qw,SoloCreep,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:55:24 2015 UTC,Yeah still hard to get my head around the scale of this game. I've already put in over 30 hours.

thewitcher3,3bh9db,mMang9455,2,Mon Jun 29 05:15:12 2015 UTC,I was level 9 when I went to Novigrad and 13 when I went to Skellige. Novigrad has quests even for as low as 4 and 6. The cool thing about open world games is that you are not bound to certain areas.
thewitcher3,3bh9db,Saitoma,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:17:27 2015 UTC,"At level 14 depending on build you should try Skellige. Later at lvl 18 Skellige is boring. In the Novigrad there is important NPC (Hatori) whoom you need to visit around lvl 22 if you pan to craft master levlel swords. Same is in Velen at Barons ""castle""."
thewitcher3,3bh9db,ThereMustBeAName,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:56:11 2015 UTC,You're already overleveled as fuck. Skellige recommended level is 14-16 for a few of the initial quests.

thewitcher3,3bd11k,HafroThunder,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:45:35 2015 UTC,It's worth it if you want to play all sex scenes. There is one at the end of Gweent Turnament. At first run I ignored Gweent. Now I'm playing 2nd time and at lvl 4-5 I have most of Velen matches won. It's quite enjoying :).

Check your Catalyst settings, slide them all to performance.  Check your power plan. If it is balanced, switch it to performance.

Last I checked, this saddle system is unique to W3, and like most of the inventory based functions, there is very little in the way of explanation as to how things work. I tried clicking the saddle to equip it and nothing happened. It's not like I asked how to attack an enemy or some shit."

thewitcher3,3bbu3n,LargePizza_DietCoke,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:54:34 2015 UTC,Yes the effects on gear are sometimes valuable and it depends how much damage you'll lose. Regardless if you're at level 9 you should go find the griffin gear. It will surely be much better than anything you currently have
thewitcher3,3bbu3n,TheDoob,3,Sat Jun 27 19:25:15 2015 UTC,Once you start crafting witcher school gear all other gear becomes more or less pointless.
thewitcher3,3bbu3n,addy009,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:38:04 2015 UTC,"There's definitely some relic gear worth having, especially in between levels of your witcher gear and especially if you stick to, say medium armor.

thewitcher3,3bbu3n,thebigJ_A,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:40:39 2015 UTC,I also believe there are some relic swords with 600-700 base damage.
thewitcher3,3bbu3n,addy009,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:47:57 2015 UTC,@TheDoob - it depends if he goes swordman path or casters path.

thewitcher3,3bau5a,bruce656,2,Sat Jun 27 13:08:43 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that loot from chests and monsters are for your level, even if the quest that took you there is 10 levels above you.  Crafted items will be for a set level.  So you will alwasy find gear to fit you and level up so feel free to do high level quests if you want.  I like how this game gives you that option.. I'm playing on death march so I really can't do anything too high because I just don't do enough damage to the high level ones with teh skull icon on them."

I'm about 15 right now and I've progressed to skellige just to get more Gwent cards, but I'm leaving all of the higher level quests for a little later. Maybe scoot a bit further in the storyline and you'll naturally level up to a point where you'll get better loot? That's my only thought."
thewitcher3,3bau5a,chricke,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:44:33 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure all of the loot in the game is level dependent. You can open any chest anywhere, and regardless of where you found it, all of the loot is going to be somewhere near your level from my experience it ranges plus or minus five levels. So if you have a level 6 treasure hunt, if you leave it and come back as level 30, you'll be pulling level 30 relic gear.  Furthermore, the item will always be the same, but its level will fluctuate. You can save and reload, opening the chest 20 times, and you will roll 20 different versions of that item.  So, yes, if I come back to this quest later as a high level character, the loot will level to match my character, but I'm just wondering if I should get the crappy sword now, or the crappy sword later, basically, lol"
thewitcher3,3bau5a,grayemansam,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:57:31 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering this to, I was able to kite mobs at a lvl 23 quest granting me access to the master blacksmith at lvl 6.

If you're more than five levels past any given side quest, I wouldn't bother with it unless you're particularly interested in the story it concerns. I did all of Triss' side quests even though I had leveled past them simply because I wanted to know what happened. Regarding contracts, I don't see a point."
thewitcher3,3ba4vy,apollonius2x,2,Sat Jun 27 08:03:17 2015 UTC,"No need to do every quest on your first play through. One tip to avoid overleveling, skip using Witcher silver swords, they all grant 20% experience bonus from monsters. Also avoid the trophies with experience bonuses."

thewitcher3,3b8dmv,indiedrummer7,3,Fri Jun 26 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"Some ""puzzle"" quests were much harder to solve in witcher 2. I remember this one quest where i had to find a way into an old library and this protection thing spoke some verses and you had to figure out what those verses mean and each verse had like 3 possible meanings.  You don't really see that kind of quests in witcher 3 but that doesn't make it less enjoyable and there is much, much more quests in general in w3.  Witcher 2 wasnt full open world so they had enough room to make a lot of unique sidequests. Witcher 3 still has fairly unique side quests but they are all based around the same idea for the most part.  All in all i like the witcher 3 a bit more than 2 but only because the game itself has a lot of nice improvements than previous games are missing (fast travel for example). That said tho, I love the fact that in witcher 2 the whole 2nd act changes depending on who you side with at the end of act 1."
thewitcher3,3b8dmv,Sukyman,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:40:47 2015 UTC,"Until now, I still like the 2 better. Not saying that witcher 3 is a bad game, far from it, but I love the linearity of the witcher 2, but in the same time our decision can still have a good impact on the story. I like the skill tree and mutagen system on the 2. It seems to have more depth for it. And we don't have anyway to respec Geralt. The sidequests in witcher 2 are in my opinion better."
thewitcher3,3b8dmv,lebouffon88,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:07:03 2015 UTC,"I just recently finished my first full playthough of the Witcher 2, as the machine I had when it was first released, coupled with some technical problems I had at the time, meant that the load times were intense and the framerate was bad.  The Witcher 2's leveling system was a lot less forgiving overall. I think towards the end of the game you could respec, but by then what would the point be? Mutagens were definitely worse - you had to pick up a skill that had a ""Mutagen"" slot, which was usually at the tail end of a talent tree, and once you dropped in a mutagen you were stuck. Unless you went down the Alchemy tree there was pretty much no point to it.  As far as the quests go, I think the biggest problem with it was simply how dense the world was. It was very easy to just say ""Ok, I need to go to this part of the map, and there are like 5 things in that area I need to do.""  Having said that, Witcher 2 is a good game. In some ways I have more fondness for the first Witcher, but in any case Witcher 3 seems to be where they really hit it out of the ballpark."

But this isn't a bad thing.  As far as witcher 2, I'm excited to give it a playthrough finally but for these reasons I'm worried. I don't want to resort to guides because I love the adventure and that fresh feeling that comes along the first true time but I have a sneaking suspicion I'm going to screw myself over one way or another. Especially after the enhanced forgiveness of 3's system"
thewitcher3,3b8dmv,kodamun,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:38:27 2015 UTC,"Nah, like the Witcher 3, the Witcher 2 is fairly easy after you get a few levels under your belt. I had no idea what I was doing with the leveling system, and only looked up a quest or two online (one of which was because the quest expired when I turned in another quest, and I had no idea why). Everything was pretty much a breeze.  If you haven't already, I highly recommend the first Witcher. It's maybe a better story than Witcher 2, though it's showing its age."
thewitcher3,3b8dmv,kodamun,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:15:06 2015 UTC,I'm sure this is a simple google quest so don't hate me for asking but on which platform do I need to play the first? I'm assuming PC which I currently do not have but may consider in the future
thewitcher3,3b8dmv,UsefulGrain2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:01:16 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, the first Witcher only came out on PC. I was big on PC games back in the day, and ended up buying the enhanced edition that came with an actual paper guide book, which was really nice as the first Witcher does not hold your hand at all.  It was actually built on the Aurora Engine, the Bioware engine behind Neverwinter Nights and Neverwinter Nights 2, which was built for more Isometric RPG type things. As a result, the first Witcher is definitely different from its sequels."
thewitcher3,3b8dmv,UsefulGrain2,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:35:05 2015 UTC,"A big reason for my preference for TW3 is the overall feel of the game. I was a fan of the books before I ever played the second game, and I felt like the two media were entirely separate and dissimilar. It seemed like besides the names of a few key characters and locations, there was nothing to tie the game's story to the books. Not to mention the fact that Geralt had become more interested/entangled in political affairs than he was in being a monster hunter.  I feel like the 3rd game was able to create a more immersive experience because they were more true to the original Witcher universe. The combat is focused on hunting monsters moreso than killing humans, and Geralt's political affiliations serve only to help him save or protect his loved ones. Besides that, there are tons of little easter-eggy rewards or cameos for fans of the books, as well as references to well-known folklore and fairy-tales(I really liked seeing Little Red Riding Hood as a bandit-thug).  I don't know if I remember enough from the actual combat mechanics or progression systems in TW2 to give them an accurate comparison, but the overall feeling/story/immersive nature of the game is what makes it a win for me."

thewitcher3,3b5rqw,sh7seven,2,Fri Jun 26 04:58:46 2015 UTC,You will loose them sooner or later.  This happened for me during my 1st run. I created stash in the Novigrad and when I returned later (1-3 levels) it was gone.  I tested that again on lvl 2 in the forge in the White Orchid village. After finishing a quest for dwarf my dropped items were gone.

I can't really say, you are far far away from Kaer Morhen and i wouldn't advise you to skip all the other quest just to get the Wolf armor.  You can do a lot side quests later, but you should always check your quest log after finishing a main quest to see, whether you failed one quest.  Edit: In my first playthrough i wasn't at Kaer Morhen before i reached a gametime of 50-60 hours."

If you are perceptive, able to adapt easily to even the smallest level 3 cannibal or bandit camp and you don't get cocky about your fights, you can totally be OP. If you don't take the time to actually prep or aren't on your game even one bit, you forget one Ard or you forget you accidently still had the Blunt Sword equipped from Act I, Death March doesn't forgive easily.

'Ladies of the Woods?' Oh. FFFFUUUU---""  Frustrating, dammit."
thewitcher3,3aqsrf,skoot66,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:28:37 2015 UTC,Quest items cannot be sold until they have no function. Once used it is moved to usable items. It is likely a glitch rather than the lack of quest item. Look for a walk through for the quest you are on and do the quest.
thewitcher3,3ap5hq,Kaninstek,4,Mon Jun 22 10:51:48 2015 UTC,"1) Steel swords deal more damage to non-monster enemies like wolves, bears and mainly people. Using a silver sword will deal terrible damage, even if it has higher stats. Silver Swords are for monsters like nekkers, werewolves, drowners etc. Same as the above, you'd be doing shit damage using a steel sword on them.  2) That's the tier 2 upgrade to the Igni spell. You have all spells at the start but you need to upgrade them for different effects or bonuses. Hit K to see your skill tree. You need to add enough points into any spell in the same branch to unlock the next tier.   I actually don't think that Igni upgrade is that great since you move real slow when you use it and you can't dodge or roll while it's spewing but you can try it though."
thewitcher3,3ap5hq,soupbuns,3,Mon Jun 22 11:05:22 2015 UTC,"My biggest mistake was reducing the difficulty down from Blood and Broken bones. Play it on at least blood and broken bones and always go for the lowest quests u till you get to grips with the mechanics and start finding alchemy recipes for oils, bombs and the such.   Trust me, I've put the difficulty back up now but regret reducing it at all."

You could put a couple of pts in igni when you need 1i to get to level 3. Also, you can respec your pts eventually. And yeah, in battle, most times, Geralt will draw the sword needed for the fight, ie. Steel for humans, and silver for monsters. There's already of ton of info online, so google to your hearts desire. There's so much packed into this game, especially concerning story choices.

thewitcher3,3amyas,Ireland914,10,Sun Jun 21 21:51:55 2015 UTC,"There is a constant turmoil between humans and nonhumans in The Witcher universe and witchers are in a unfortunate position to be hated by both sides. Humans see witchers as nonhumans ('cause they are mutants) and nonhumans see them still as humans (as they were before the mutation). Of course there are still people who support them but they are in the minority which isn't that strange when you take in the consideration the state of the world, rumors, constant propaganda, lack of modern communication (most news travel through word of mouth and bard's songs which are both known to alter the truth), etc.  Witchers are also seen and known to be almost emotionless ""creatures"" (Geralt possessing larger range of emotions than most) that were created by unholy ways (magic & mutation) to do just one thing: kill. With ever decreasing number of monsters in the world (and rise of things like religion) people condemn the monster slaying business as barbaric thing to practice where as it used to be seen as a necessity. Glory seeking knights and ""protection"" offered by religion are seen as more accepted and ahem human ways to handle monster problems if they were to arise (though they rarely are as effective as hiring a witcher would be).  Witchers are also usually ""made"" from orphans so people rarely have any significant connection to them before mutation and it is known that only very few survive the mutation process making them seem even bigger abominations."
thewitcher3,3amyas,Sckeyth,3,Sun Jun 21 21:20:18 2015 UTC,Because they are unnatural mutants. Just like sorceresses are despised for using magic.

People will always look for someone or something to hate, superstition is a major human flaw. Intolerance of this nature is a way of cathartic release for people, since they can't lash out at the unjust world (to any fruition) they pick a target which is somehow symbolic of their weaknesses. The Witcher reminds them that they can't exist without him. Also, when people need a Witcher's help, they know they will have to pay for it, which I'm sure breeds some resentment."

Not all are racist though, like the guy who praises the witches of the bog for allowing his village to prosper. Even though it was through dark means... (dank memes).

thewitcher3,3amyas,Cryptonious,6,Sun Jun 21 20:50:28 2015 UTC,"While this sounds almost ironic, yes, that's pretty much the case. Only few people are not racist; and this racism is what makes the world so thriving: Humans hate non-humans, non-humans hate humans, non-humans hate each other (that dwarfs and elves fought together as Scoia'tael was surprising and happened only because both groups were heavily discriminated against by the humans). Oh, and humans hate humans: Nilfgaardians are like a different species for the Northerners, and the other way around. Add to that the constant threat of monsters (some of which are very human-like, yet potentially dangerous; e.g. the succubi), and you can see why everybody is cautious (or even hateful) of anybody different to them. And, of course, pushing guilt onto another race makes it easier for you to live with it."

They clearly designed the game to allow you to drop items and for them to be there when you get back (and shining when you use witcher sense).  The problem is that with patch 1.04, the game started to delete stuff randomly.  So if they had not intended for people to drop things, they would have made them disappear when dropped.  CDPR needs to add a storage container.  That seems like a HUGE oversight, seeing as your three witcher gear sets add up to like 40-50 weight.  I have only those and herbs/crafting items and I have 120 weight.  That is crazy."

thewitcher3,3ajpxa,strum1,2,Sat Jun 20 21:35:19 2015 UTC,"It's much easier if they're near your level. Are you blocking? Using strong attack? Blocking with left trigger reduces all damage I'm pretty sure.  The key is to not just button mash the fast attack, because they're going to parry you and counterattack for massive damage. You have to time your punches to the exact moment your opponent drops his guard and begins to attack you."

thewitcher3,3ahkq4,TheLastDigitofPi,2,Sat Jun 20 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, finding the tree and doing the quest before meeting the crones allows for the best ending.

thewitcher3,3ahkq4,TheLastDigitofPi,2,Sat Jun 20 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I did that. I did it in multiple different ways, but when I  arrive the witches are complimenting gran about how sweet and juicy the children are or something. In the scenarios where the kids are rescued, they get mad at her and say that she let them escape. I'm pretty confused by it given that I've seen people across 5 or 6 sites saying that they got the double good ending."
thewitcher3,3ahkq4,strum1,2,Sat Jun 20 18:44:01 2015 UTC,"I think dialog choices affect the outcome too.  First, you must not mention children to the tree  Second you must act like you killed the tree to the quest giver guy  Third, after crones yell at Gran for being slow  with bringing the ear they will forgive her  Last, you must choose ""you used me option"" where crones will tell you that you tricked them  And this will cause village to be destroyed when Barron comes.  I have seen this ending, so I guarantee that it is not a myth. And it was not patched or anything few days back  Here is a video of a guy getting  this ending  http://youtu.be/e5vpUgIkM7w  They do mention that children where plump. But at 8 minute mark they mentioned the children escaping.  So it is sort of  Schrodinger children. They are both eaten and not eaten. But once the 8 minute dialog mark is triggered they children are alive. And it seems punishment for Anna is assigned at beginning of cutscene.  It does not seem to be an official outcome, so I would not be surprised if it gets patched out.  Also I did not have any DLC installed when I got the double good ending. So maybe one of free DLC patches it."
thewitcher3,3ahkq4,Wall-SWE,2,Sun Jun 21 03:10:56 2015 UTC,"Huh, wow. That means I probably got this ending multiple times, but I always decided to stop and try to figure out what went wrong when they say the kids were plump and tasty or whatever.  Damn. I've done too much today to reload though. If I ever replay the game, at least now I know a solution. Though I'm betting there might be a mod that allows an outright fully good ending by that point >_>. Thanks for the video link. Finally some proof that this can happen surfaces for me."

On the Xbox it's right on the directional pad(been a while since I got to play it so I'm hoping I'm right). Made the mistake one too many times of entering battle and letting the enemies get a few hits on me.   Once your weapon is drawn u can go into parry stance.

I collect a bunch of stuff and check on it regularly. Im 70 hours in and I only JUST recently made my first bomb. I definitely had a harder time in combat in TW2, which compelled me to make more oils and craft more bombs. Now that I can slash and burn my way through everything, I don't feel the need."

I can tell you that I did my first full complete play through of the Witcher 2 in the month leading up to the launch of the Witcher 3. Combat in the Witcher 2 gets very easy very quickly after you get the first couple of levels.  As far as alchemy goes, unless you are specifically going down the alchemy skill tree, it's practically useless. I maybe used a potion a handful of times, because you had to drink whatever potions you wanted while meditating. Because you couldn't actively use potions, most times potions only got used when you'd already run into a bad spot, died, and reloaded. Blade oils pretty much never were needed after the first chapter, and even in chapter 1 the only time I remember using blade oil is when I ran into my first specters. They might have been more necessary at the highest difficulties but I can't speak to that.  My memory of the Witcher 1 is hazier. I definitely remember using potions a lot more and blade oils. I also remember a lot of ham sandwiches, but that doesn't mean much. Man Witcher 1 was really surprisingly good though."

thewitcher3,3aai6l,jasazick,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:36:21 2015 UTC,It is in the upper right on Inventory screen.  Looks to me like a weight with a loop on top and has values like 42/60 meaning you currently have 42 lbs.  of your available 60 lbs before you are overburdened.  The saddlebags just add to your total available.  No separate location store to interact with.

I wouldn't expect people to play it outside of the context of the game though, if by that you mean people who aren't familiar with the Witcher series.   If you by out of context of the game you mean the fact that the game has more defined levels of difficulty then I think more tactical elements would have to be added as currently it is a glorified version of top trumps, generally whoever has the best overall deck wins. However at times tactics do prevail.   It would be a shame to see this go to waste, I've never been so captivated by a mini game. The Witcher is an amazing game that I don't get enough time to play but I can never turn down 'a few hands of Gwent'."

thewitcher3,3a02po,rockstarleopard,1 point,Tue Jun 16 07:18:04 2015 UTC,"Most likely it is indeed the issue with max crown limit, which is 65536 or 216 or the max size of short integer variables.

What if I have a higher res monitor than you and I can still see the bar?  Silly complaint, really, unless you're just against health bars in general? If they have 100 health and you do 99, they're not dead, same as if it happens to you. Just hit them again. How is it frustrating? If you're looking at the health bar long enough to determine it's still there but apparently empty you're looking long enough to know they're still moving. Watch the enemy not the bar."
thewitcher3,3a1jio,thebigJ_A,-1,Tue Jun 16 20:05:23 2015 UTC,"I'm playing on a decent resolution myself and its more that it simply looks like their health bar is completely empty and the enemy isn't dead.

thewitcher3,3a1jio,thebigJ_A,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:32:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what to tell you. I don't see why you're hesitating. It shouldn't matter if their bar looks like it's empty. They're still up and moving so they're clearly not dead yet. Do you have this problem in every game with health bars?
thewitcher3,3a1jio,Bradmrj,2,Wed Jun 17 14:00:39 2015 UTC,I have been in combat with mobs of 3-4 and will get an enemy to the point where it looks like they have no health left. Then since I have another enemy attacking I will turn around to switch to the new target and try and kill him just to realize that the last guy I thought was dead is still alive. Sure I just have to turn around again and hit that enemy 1 more time but then he just parries me and I have to swing 2-3 times to do the last 10 dmg or so. I see where op is coming from its not a huge deal and I have learned to just keep swinging 1 extra time on enemies to ensure they are dead but the health bars are misleading at times when they are very low.
thewitcher3,39zz3z,quintus253,2,Tue Jun 16 03:48:10 2015 UTC,I thought that was only if you're 6 levels above the recommended? Pretty lame if you're right.

thewitcher3,39yzhs,Classicpass,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:27:16 2015 UTC,"Barely any mob in the whole game over level 20-25, reason behind so is you can easily finish the game once you are in that level range, no point grinding anywhere higher. The last part of the main quest line (after Mist) provides you with quite a few more levels and by the time you finish the game you should be about 30-38, depending on the amount of side quests/map markers you completed.   You can find the odd rare monster here and there, but once you get the mastercrafted gear at level 31 the difficulty level becomes a joke even on Death March. I think the game is really well balanced from this perspective as it simply prevents you from being way over the supposed level by the time you get to finish the main quest. Remember that monsters don't scale so this is a way to make the game challenging enough to the end (unfortunately I still find it way too easy)."

thewitcher3,3a02v5,thebigJ_A,0,Tue Jun 16 12:51:49 2015 UTC,"Of course it costs more if you're buying all your ingredients! Why are you doing that? Craft blank runestones and blank lesser glyphs.

That relic sword that's outclassed by your gear can be deconstructed into, say, amber dust and other components. All your leather comes from enemies' pelts etc. Worst case you buy one or two bits.

I dropped difficulty like 3 or 4 times on my first Blood and Broken Bones playthrough, mostly because I was pissed losing 70% of my health from a 5m fall and so I'd meditate it back, and I didn't get any trophy for that difficulty level.  Now I just ""waste"" my swallow potions and meditate to have them back.   Still don't understand this need to not heal you when meditating. Feels just dumb"

thewitcher3,39stbd,NeedleNoggin316,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:58:53 2015 UTC,"They nerfed runestones and glyphs. The way they did it was weird, though. They essentially created new runestones with the same name and image but different ID under the hood, with worse stats (some, at least. The new Igni is the same strength). I guess they somehow couldn't change the stats of items people already had, and didn't want to wipe things from our inventories.  Basically this means crafting runes and glyphs works properly, but you get to keep any of the older, pre-nerf glyphs/runes you already had. You just can't craft with them, not that you'd want to. Why put two of the old 3% lesser Devanas together to get a new  3% regular Devana?"

Without a greedy publisher breathing down their necks they had time to focus on the quality and complete and polish the game.

thewitcher3,39r978,Igotmyhelmeton,0,Tue Jun 16 16:03:39 2015 UTC,Agreed. And some build posibilities require many more ability points.

The tracks lead away from his hideout. after you interact with Johnnys hideout  there will be a cutscene and then you follow tracks away.

Geralt's current hard cap is 70.   I should also mention that the level of items inside chests is relative to Geralt's level so if you are planning on leveling up really high save treasure hunts for later. Even though the recommended quest level may say something like 12, you'll be pulling level 30+ relic gear."

I spent all the ability points I got from places of power in the 'other' tree (Sun & Stars, Rage Management, etc) before I realized that not only were they not always-active passive abilities, I hadn't even been using them because they had never been slotted. I probably played about 6 hours before I realized I had not even been using the abilities I had purchased."
thewitcher3,39nzf2,bruce656,2,Thu Jun 18 14:55:39 2015 UTC,There are two skills you don't have to plug into the slots on the right.  They are highlighted slightly different.. they have a border around them on the left side.  But all other skills need to be slotted on teh right to make them work.
thewitcher3,39nzf2,strum1,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:19:52 2015 UTC,Which skills specifically are these?  I had no ideas about this. I assumed to let any skill work it needed to be selected into a slot.

thewitcher3,39mku2,Cryptonious,4,Fri Jun 12 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"Initially, adrenaline points are just a passive meter that builds up and increases attack power (each point is +10%, so all 3 points grant +30% attack power).  Once you level up and invest in certain skills, you then are able to use them to execute those skills.  Examples: Whirl (drains stamina and then adrenaline while in use).  There is also a skill that lets you use signs with adrenaline points if stamina is not full."
thewitcher3,39mku2,clarkysan,3,Fri Jun 12 21:50:23 2015 UTC,There's an awesome skill that lets use expend adrenaline points to use SIGNS ! How awesome is that!

thewitcher3,39m3qh,UCMCoyote,5,Fri Jun 12 18:19:17 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly the knowledge of mutation has been lost and they cannot perform the ritual anymore. That has been stated in Witcher 1. Don't fully remember the details though.   From the books you also learn that since humanity is taking the world over there is less and less monsters around and so the need of witchers.  There is no more people willing to send young lads to witchers schools especially since most of them die due to the mutation.
thewitcher3,39m3qh,Elrohur,2,Fri Jun 12 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"yea, less monsters...sound about right."
thewitcher3,39m3qh,bitcasual,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:25:30 2015 UTC,Didn't the mutation potions get stolen in the first game?
thewitcher3,39m3qh,cdrewsr388,2,Fri Jun 12 23:24:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but not the knowledge how to use them properly. All the mutants created with the stolen mutagens have trade offs while witchers are superior to normal humans in basically every way (infertility being the one obvious deficiency)"
thewitcher3,39m3qh,Ze_German_Guy,2,Sat Jun 13 09:39:54 2015 UTC,"And from what we see in this game, there's a 1in 4 chance of it turning you into a total dick."

thewitcher3,39m3qh,Ze_German_Guy,2,Fri Jun 12 20:19:44 2015 UTC,"The knowledge how to make witchers has been lost. Based on what they say in the books and the first two games there isn't even a way that Yennefer should have been able to reconstruct the small part that they are using on Uma.   While they still had the instruments and ingredients needed (see W1 where the mutagens get stolen) Vesemir was a sword instructor and doesn't know how to use them. There's also magic invovled and the mages were killed when the fortress was destroyed.    The other schools aren't in much better schape; Cat is wiped out (and since they turned assassins/mercenaries rather than strict monster hunters nobody really mourns them). Viper was destroyed and it looks like Emhyr isn't honoring his promise to protect the remaining witchers (at least not Letho). Griffin and Bear aren't really mentioned in particular, but nothing has been heard from them indicating that they don't exist anymore either.   And why Vesemir kept the table, why not? It's a big fortress with more than enough space to put it somewhere. There's no need to break it down for parts either. The only reason to destroy it would be symbolic and instead he chose to follow the out of sight, out of mind philosophy."
thewitcher3,39mss1,Soprohero,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:14:33 2015 UTC,I have a gtx660 and had a similar problem with it lagging and being unplayable.

thewitcher3,39mss1,Forkinator88,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:38:40 2015 UTC,MSI afterburner. I only increased core clock by +50 and men clock by +150. You should be able to do more but maybe another day for me. I'm afraid to fiddle with it again cuz I don't want the lag to return lol. Oh and I also increased the fan speed a bit cuz I overclocked.

thewitcher3,39l6lw,Cuchulane,2,Fri Jun 12 21:55:08 2015 UTC,Was the weapon condition deteriorating  faster than normal? And maybe because it was an earth elemental?  The depth of this game keeps surprising  me.

Usually they need to be slotted to become active, but there's 4 that give benefits even without being in a slot. If you do slot them you can get more bonuses for matching mutagens though.

thewitcher3,39ivan,MontrealOrange,6,Fri Jun 12 05:32:47 2015 UTC,"You do no curing in that quest.   He's probably referring to Morkvarg. His quest is called "" In Wolf's Clothing"" and it's in Skellige."
thewitcher3,39ivan,SymbolicGamer,2,Fri Jun 12 08:59:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you, yeah I done wild at heart ages ago. My friend asked me yesterday how to cure the werewolf but I had no idea what he was talking about lol Figured I'd go do it so I can help him, but have no quests involving curing a werewolf. Apparently the werewolf is in a garden if that helps, I will go and look for that morkvarg now"
thewitcher3,39ivan,SymbolicGamer,3,Fri Jun 12 10:01:31 2015 UTC,"Yep. That's the quest. There's multiple ways to solve the problem, and it's easy to miss curing him so make sure you get into that locked area for more information, and be nice. That's about all I can say without spoiling it."
thewitcher3,39ivan,MontrealOrange,2,Fri Jun 12 10:21:38 2015 UTC,Ah true! My apologies! I forgot to ask how far he was. Sorry OP!
thewitcher3,39ivan,imitebatwork,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:43:33 2015 UTC,"Did this quest yesterday and it was awesome! Probably took me 7 attempts to get him down. I really love how everything in this game is a puzzle, even tracking the wolf wasn't easy. Then finding out the right weapon oil to use and which magic spell (sorry still new, not sure what it's actually called) to use. This game is a lot of fun and I can't wait to explore more."
thewitcher3,39hlkn,LeprechaunK1ng,2,Thu Jun 11 19:41:06 2015 UTC,Some of the skills in this game are bugged. I get damaged even when I have Quen's active shield on. And I'm pretty sure someone said that the heavy attack Rend skill does less damage than a normal heavy attack.
thewitcher3,39hlkn,Ze_German_Guy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:28:55 2015 UTC,"Once quen breaks (or you run out of stamina for the alternate) you take damage, even if it's just one massive hit so that may not be a bug.  That being said, I observed what OP describes in multiple sword fights. Especially against bigger enemies with long reach like a cyclops."
thewitcher3,39hlkn,McFisterson,2,Sat Jun 13 00:14:51 2015 UTC,"Doesn't work in fist fights. Think it's not intended to. First fights are all about countering, then hoping back to counter next attack. Think it would make the first fight quests to easy."
thewitcher3,39hlkn,henrokk1,2,Thu Jun 11 23:41:42 2015 UTC,I don't think any of the skills work in fist fighting. I know the increased damage skills don't after doing some testing. I don't think they even let you use potions. The fist fighting is all skill and level based I believe
thewitcher3,39hlkn,vexxer209,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:02:45 2015 UTC,For anyone wondering what Fleet Footed is it's the skill that makes you take less damage while rolling.
thewitcher3,39hv74,eroxx,4,Thu Jun 11 20:40:05 2015 UTC,I have been playing the crap out of the game and below are somethings I have noticed.  Still a great game though.    Why isn't there somewhere to store my crap?  Right now I am putting all of my random crap on the ground near a guy in the Novigrad market.  Not being able to jump over a ledge when in a battle.  Why can't I look straight up and shoot my crossbow?  I hate standing around waiting on flying enemies to attack me.  Why no yellow mutagens?  Unless I haven't found one yet  Falling off a ledge.  Why does jumping off a knee high rock take 3/4 of my health?  Not a fan of doing a mission overleveled and getting crap XP for it.  The way some of the missions in Novigrad and Skellige interact is kind of screwed up.  By completing one mission I failed another because I didn't talk to Cleaver 1st.  If talking to Cleaver was a prerequisite for that mission it should have been listed.  Load times after dying.
thewitcher3,39hv74,ratandjmt,3,Fri Jun 12 01:51:39 2015 UTC,"You'll lose that stuff. It doesn't stay forever if you just drop it.  agreed I guess Why do we need them?  Hit jump before you land. You roll and take no/very little damage You're already over leveled, and you want more XP?? Boggles the mind. It's ok to fail. You're not expected to be able to do every single thing. The whole point is that your choices have consequences. You do something that, hypothetical here, destroys a town and everyone in it, you should fail any quests the mayor of the town might have given you. Or should there be a big red text at the beginning of a quest saying ""NPC X WILL DIE BY THE END OF THIS QUEST. MAKE SURE YOU DO Y FIRST, THEN TOTALLY COME BACK SO HE CAN DIE WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT!"" SSD. They're cheap, and the single most effective upgrade for the cost. I can't even read the loading text half the time."
thewitcher3,39hv74,thebigJ_A,2,Fri Jun 12 05:02:41 2015 UTC,...there's loading text?!
thewitcher3,39hv74,FinnTheDogg,1 point,Sat Jun 13 10:03:12 2015 UTC,"Load times after dying.   Yeah this can be rough. The game does tell you at one point though ""We automatically save for you but if you're deep into a quest/mission you may want to manually save your progress."" I learned my lesson on this one and now make a point to save before a particularly tough fight"
thewitcher3,39hv74,imitebatwork,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:43:31 2015 UTC,I manually saved during a quest and through some weird bug managed to still lose 4-6 hours of progress. Pretty disappointing.
thewitcher3,39hv74,TheNotoriousLogank,1 point,Sat Jun 13 01:27:26 2015 UTC,Why isn't there somewhere to store my crap?   Which is strange because Witcher 1 & 2 allowed you to store stuff at the inns
thewitcher3,39hv74,thumbgreen,3,Fri Jun 12 22:19:17 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of things I would have liked to be different   1) Skill tree.  Somehow I miss the Witcher 1 skill tree with the gold / silver / copper token you'd get with leveling. The personalization was greater and I really could feel a difference in term of gameplay at the time  2) Alchemy. I'm not too found of the refueling system. I used to prefer when you had to prepare for a fight and craft the needed potion. No more, no less.   3) Mutagens / decoctions. Too few red mutagens, too many ""specific"" ones (i.e : werewolf, harpy etc.). Once again I preferred the way they were handled in Witcher 1. You'd get only 1 werewolf mutagen for example (if you decided to kill him) and that would unlock a skill permanently.   4) Too stand alone title.  I understand they had us to start over at level 1 but still there's a few things that bothers me. We shouldn't have to spend point to learn how to deflect arrows. Geralt fully recovered his memory and he is a 100 old or so Witcher. Shouldn't we have more things unlocked at the very start ?  I'm also disappointed we don't get to meet more people from the previous ones. Kalkstein ends up being dead, we barely see Thaler, Henselt seems to be dead whatever you decided to do in Witcher 2, don't know what happens with Anais and so on."
thewitcher3,39hv74,Elrohur,3,Fri Jun 12 09:32:17 2015 UTC,I wish the option to uselessly light candles and firepits would only appear when you have Igni selected. Far too often when I'm trying to quickly loot do I have to pause and wait while Gerald decides it's a good time to light then snuff out a candle on a desk.
thewitcher3,39hv74,questionforlevar,2,Fri Jun 12 09:45:13 2015 UTC,For me it's the bugs. Huge game bugs expected yeah yeah I know. And that's fine for quests here and there or the odd horse hickup.   But I'd like to just make my build and choose my skills without worrying if picking one skill is a waste of points because it's bugged and doesn't work properly. Or not being sure if my mutagens are actuly being applied
thewitcher3,39hv74,FimbulEinherji,2,Thu Jun 11 21:55:52 2015 UTC,The only real issue I have with the game is the inventory. The controls seems wonky at first but I've gotten used to them.
thewitcher3,39hv74,Ireland914,2,Fri Jun 12 02:46:27 2015 UTC,For me it's the horse. It gets very frustrating when you have to stop every few feet because of a bush or a rock.
thewitcher3,39hv74,bayareamota,2,Fri Jun 12 03:33:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the sword thing is a big one for me. One of my favorite features of the game is the overall lack of hand-holding combined with how you often have to figure out on your own the best way to kill certain monsters. It feels like the game automatically telling you which sword to use and when to pull it out it counter-intuitive."
thewitcher3,39hv74,UsefulGrain2,2,Fri Jun 12 08:07:23 2015 UTC,Get rid of the weapon degradation.
thewitcher3,39hv74,SymbolicGamer,2,Fri Jun 12 09:52:40 2015 UTC,The inventory is a mess. It should be done differently. Books and potion in the same tab is just wrong.
thewitcher3,39hv74,bitcasual,2,Fri Jun 12 22:30:40 2015 UTC,"Roach; seriously, what's wrong with that horse? Stands beside you after your ship sunk, can't run through a Bush or jump over a fence.  Why is the crossbow the only usable weapon underwater?"
thewitcher3,39hv74,Phelyckz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:32:45 2015 UTC,I think better loot leveling is needed. The mastercrafted sword hattori gives you should not be overpowered 10 mins later buy a random sword you find in a ditch on the side of the road.
thewitcher3,39hv74,JohnThaGr33k,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:13:19 2015 UTC,Definitely this. I got Hattori's sword at level 13 and started using the ashrune sword an hour later.  Pretty disappointing I did all of that quest for a sword that was out powered by something I found.

thewitcher3,39hv74,thebigJ_A,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:55:32 2015 UTC,"Track more than 1 quest at a time. Auto sort new items to the top of inventory tabs. Quit telling me my 45th Downer Brain is a new item! Roach controls are pretty bad. Hard to turn in tight spots, stairs in Novigrad suck, etc. Give me a more distinctive new item indicator. The little star is hard to see on scrolls or certain items. I didn't realize this for quite some time, but if I enter a new area, give me the marker automatically. I didn't realize I missed a lot of markers until I explored most of Velen/Novigrad. And on that note, let me use Fast Travel on Roach. Give me indicators on Roach gear if it's an upgrade. I don't like having to memorize it.   That's all I have now, gotta run."
thewitcher3,39hv74,Joebroni555,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:41:37 2015 UTC,Yes yes to track more than one quest at a time.
thewitcher3,39hv74,hteng,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:42:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty on point with the Inventory system and UI. It's pretty obvious it's designed for a Mouse and Keyboard layout but then when you get to combat it feels like it's designed for a controller. make up your minds!  I wish there's some sort of sorting system in the inventory. Also fucking mutagens, why do they all look the same, lesser, normal and greater onces should be visually different, defeats the whole purpose of having icons if they all look the same.   I also want to know which gear im currently equiped in the repair/dismantle screen, i don't want to have to navigate to my character inventory to check before dismantling or repair.  also, usable items, especially combat related should be sorted to the top,  i don't want to have to scroll through a wall of books to get to my bombs or potions.  Also, since we can already use potions in the inventory during combat, why not allow us to equip more than two potions / bombs in the hot bar? it's a bloody chore to navigate the inventory already, why not make combat smoother that way? let me hotbar more items.  Combat, oh my god please let me jump over a small ledge during combat, make a separate jump button or don't design your fights around uneven terrain.   Navigating tight spaces and camera in those space can be nausea because more often you are fighting with the controller than navigating the spaces.  lastly fall damage, nuff said.  yes, swimming sucks, why have two additional buttons for surfacing and diving? just let us control our directions via the control stick or mouse.  on the maps, when i have a custom marker out, please also have the dotted navigation line for it. Also, with the world map opened please at least indicate where the next mission is without me scrolling through every corner to find it, if the mission is not in my view, show an arrow to where it is."
thewitcher3,39hv74,Frisbeesizedwormhole,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:08:17 2015 UTC,"For me it's the combat. Having just played bloodborne, where the combat was near perfection, witcher 3 combat is just lacking. It feels loose and clunky."
thewitcher3,39hv74,imitebatwork,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:07:39 2015 UTC,Is there a trick to Parrying or am I just bad at it? Should I preemptively hold the parry button before a strike or do I need to tap it in perfect timing?
thewitcher3,39hv74,fonzatron2000,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:47:04 2015 UTC,"Parrying reallyonly works against humans with regular swords, just press he button when they go to hit you. There's a big window to do it in, and you can practice it by doing the boxing quest's"

thewitcher3,39i22r,danyier,2,Fri Jun 12 00:33:55 2015 UTC,You can probably run it on lowest settings .  My PC is under minimum specs but it does run OK  on low with a couple if things on medium .  Basically the same as your setup   I i7 2600@ 4.2 GHz overclocked  GTX 650  16 GB ram  I think your graphic card may be  better than mine despite the higher number .

Then again, even when there's no water, the game just sometimes invents some. I was fighting the Shrieker last night, rode Roach to the fighting area, got off and started swimming on the land."

thewitcher3,39gbhc,FimbulEinherji,0,Sat Jun 13 11:18:16 2015 UTC,Exploits are not what makes a good game.
thewitcher3,39gbhc,vexxer209,2,Thu Jun 11 21:20:07 2015 UTC,How is luring the monster to water an exploit?
thewitcher3,39gbhc,FimbulEinherji,-1,Thu Jun 11 21:25:53 2015 UTC,"It's minor but he's kind of exploiting the fact that big flying shit doesn't deal with water in this game. I guess CDPR didn't animate swimming for Griffin/Basilisk/etc because I had the same thing happen with a Basilisk one time. I think it will be patched at some point somehow, since the place I fought a basilisk was a tiny island, kind of hard not to have it dive into the water when you shoot it out of the sky."
thewitcher3,39gbhc,vexxer209,2,Thu Jun 11 22:27:45 2015 UTC,Eh perhaps. I would think an exploit would have a net gain of some kind tho. Not just break your game. Seems like the opposite of an exploit.
thewitcher3,39gbhc,KungFuRichie,-1,Thu Jun 11 22:37:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah but he was going out of his way to intentionally exploit the water, his own captions say so. He just didn't think of the fact that loot doesn't drop from mobs that are swimming. Or maybe he thought it would drop loot anyways since it is imperative to the story."
thewitcher3,39gbhc,KungFuRichie,3,Thu Jun 11 22:42:12 2015 UTC,"I hope that it doesn´t seem that way to everyone.  Keep in mind I had not taken many hours into the game by the time I encountered the griffin, and had no idea how I should approach these´bosses´. So when I was unable to just beat the griffin by slashing my sword and throwing spells, I decided that I need to think of something else. As I stated in the video the results of the griffin falling into the water were unexpected, I was thinking that it would just get slowed/unable to fly or just debuffed, but it just died and that save basically got destroyed."
thewitcher3,39f79x,cleanarr,2,Thu Jun 11 09:03:46 2015 UTC,"I just ran some experiments and it looks like loot from chests are definitely set based on your level. Perfect place to check this is the riverside in White Orchard, there are four chests along the river you get Buckthorn from. Starting from the fisherman in a boat next to the pier and going to the north till the bridge where drowners defend a locked chest, you get the exact same loot even on separate playthroughs based on your level.  Chest 1, next to the fisherman:  Level 1 -  random oren, 1x elemental essence, 1x pure silver, Diagram: Exploding Bolt, Noonwraith Decotion  Level 2 - random oren, 1x elemental essence, 1x pure silver, Diagram: Exploding Bolt, Basilisk Decotion  Level 3 - random oren, 1x elemental essence, 1x pure silver, Diagram: Temerian Poniard, Leshen Decotion  Level 35 - random orens, hardened leather, alchemist powder, 4-6 crowns  You will find 2-3 crowns on the very end of the loot list if you already have said recipe (easy to test, same spot, level 1, chest No1 and No3 both contains an Exploding bolt diagram, taking one of them will result in you looting 2-3 crows from the other chest)  You can loot oil and potion manuscripts the same way but certain enhanced or superior versions are level locked. I guess this is one of those things you cannot mod either, so I think I'll focus on getting useful advice in my guide as opposed to exact recipe locations as loot.   PS.: Is there any way to format your posts? Looks like a wall of text."
thewitcher3,39f79x,schlap,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:19:38 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting to me.  I have a couple buddies that have been playing a week or two ahead of me. They are about 6-7 levels higher, but have been taking their time with each area to make sure they didn't miss anything (read: achievement addicts). I found an alchemy manuscript at some random merchant at one of the abandoned towns that my one buddy had been searching high and low for, but when he tried to buy it from the same exact merchant it wasn't there.   We concluded that certain items sold by merchants might be randomized or level dependent. At any rate, that just makes the game way more interesting/awesome to play with friends.  FYI: we are all playing on Death March...there is no other way to play."
thewitcher3,39f79x,schlap,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:56:32 2015 UTC,"I did try on different difficulty levels (I play DM myself too) and even tried a clean install and try every single patch separately but the loot remained the exact same. There must be a system in it as I just started a game again where I gained a level before opening said chests and the loot was the exact same as in my notes from the first playthrough, not randomized at all. I'll check what happens if I gain another level before opening them."
thewitcher3,39fcb9,JoanOfArcInFailWhale,3,Thu Jun 11 10:04:06 2015 UTC,"Buy any cards you find from merchants.  Honestly though, if you play your low level cards properly you can beat a few higher cards like that. Remember that hero cards have a high value (usually around 10) but are immune to all special effects (burn, horn of valour, weather) so sure a hero card adds 10 points right there but my 2 catapults add 16 each (might be higher. I'm at work so I can't check). Also sometimes it's worth it to lose the round so you can win the match. Did the opponent play a bunch of cards or some really high level ones? Pass that turn and watch them all be wasted while you have a bunch of cards left  Which deck are you using I could offer more help if I had some specifics.  -Do you have any spy cards? (ones with an eye emblem on the card) - Do you have any training dummies? - Any horns? - Which leader card do you use most?  Let me know and I can help turn those loses into easy wins"
thewitcher3,39fcb9,LeprechaunK1ng,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:22:54 2015 UTC,"Problem is I just don't have anywhere near the amount my opponents have. I play a 7 and a 6 and think I'm winning in the second round, and then they play three 10's out of nowhere. Even when I try to counter this with the horn I still lose every time.   I use the deck that has Keira Metz the witch as range. I have the fat bald guy from Novigrad as a spy card? I think he's level 3 or 4. No dummies, but I have decoy. And I think I have two horns.   I literally have only one leader card: King Foltest. He lets me draw a frost card out of my deck."
thewitcher3,39fcb9,LeprechaunK1ng,2,Thu Jun 11 10:57:24 2015 UTC,"Ok so it sounds like you're using the northern realms deck, also I meant decoy instead of training dummy. My bad.  If you don't have very many cards I would suggest going around velen and playing everyone who gives you the option; merchants, blacksmiths and armorers, inn keeps.  Basically anyone who has the dialogue line ""let's play cards"". You should do this for white orchard too.  How far have you progressed in the game? By the time you get to novigrad you should have an ok deck with at least 1 or 2 hero cards cards.  A good tactic I use is play the spy card when you know you're throwing the round. If they play a spy card use your decoy card to pick it up and play it on them so you get more cards.  Another good way to use decoy is play some powerful cards first round and use decoy to pick them up before passing the round. This usually tricks the opponent into wasting his stronger cards. You can also use the healer card in a fashion similar to this.  If you do the gwent questline in white orchard and velen the npcs you play should give you stronger cards once you beat them.  Lastly I got rid of all my weather cards except for one of each kind. This allows me to have a higher chance of drawing better unit cards. The exception to this is clear weather, of which I keep 2 just in case. When I draw my hand I substitute the weather cards if I don't need them.  Also, get rid of all your low power cards that don't have any useful abilities like ""poor fucking infantry "" and try to keep your unit cards as close to 22 as possible to increase your chances of getting good cards in your hand.  Hope this helped, let me know if you have more questions"
thewitcher3,39fcb9,sloan28allday,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:13:00 2015 UTC,"I've just completed Novigrad, so now I'm in Skellige. I noticed I've not enough of any deck to actually legitimate them into the Gwent game — the exception being my Northern Realms deck, for which I have many, but it's more a case of quantity over quality. I don't believe I have any heroes within it. I have a few sieges now that are to the value of 6, and one more to the value of 8. Two of them have a handshake, so I've been using that to my advantage but I still lose against these innkeepers who keep pulling 10's out of bloody nowhere.   I just don't think my deck is up to snuff at the moment. I've been reconnoitering Velen, Novigrad, and Skellige for merchants and tavern owners to sell me more cards, but they're basic. I feel like I'm in a catch-22 situation for the time being.   But I'll practise your advice."

thewitcher3,39fcb9,Bloody_Heartland,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:14:05 2015 UTC,I also use the northern realms deck and almost always won round one with this strategy. I get out my two 6 power seige cards. I usually have one or two 1 power seige cards that increase the other seige cards by 1. I used Foltest to double my seige card powers. If i have a spy or two i use them. Then I use the bitter frost or whatever its called that reduces close combat cards power to one. It very rarely loses the first round and if you have a spy or two to start with in round one then round two should be an easy win just based on having 2-4 more cards than the opponent typically.

thewitcher3,39fcb9,few23,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"For me personally I don't keep more than 32 cards in my deck. The more that are in the deck, the more likely ill draw weak ones. So whenever I get a new one, I remove a weak one. So when one goes in, another goes out. Eventually I won't have 1s, 2s, and 3s. In the mean time I buy 4s, 5s, and maybe even 6s. Probably challenge lower tier merchants before challenging big city ones too. Focus on spy cards or cards that allow you to revive cards from your discard piles. Also use your groups ability to your advantage and sometimes using a weak leader ability saves you one card in your deck (makes the opponent keep wasting cards)."
thewitcher3,39fcb9,grayemansam,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:16:56 2015 UTC,"I keep 22 cards in my deck only because you then have that much higher a chance of pulling your best cards. Seems wasteful to have that many unless they have the 'muster' ability. (Scoia'tael, monster deck)"

It requires you to have found lots of recipes, but it's very powerful. Having the ability to use two decoctions plus room for several potions is great, and every potion use heals so I don't even have to use a slot for swallow. (being able to throw a dozen grenades helps, too!).  It's way more survivable than my pure Sign build on the harder difficulties, though just a tad more micro heavy."
thewitcher3,39ckl4,thebigJ_A,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:56:44 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. I haven't dabbled in alchemy because originally the pay off seemed so far away but that was at the beginning levels.  I liked that you've found a way to survive without quen. I'm on blood and broken bones for my first playthrough and I found the healing shield to be helpful but it seems that now I can spend those points on more useful skills for my build.  Again, I appreciate the input"
thewitcher3,39ckl4,thebigJ_A,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:02:26 2015 UTC,"The respec potion comes in handy. For instance, one of the more useful alchemy skills gives you more total toxicity per recipe you've found. It's useless early on, but when I respecced to it at level 14-ish two points game me over 200 toxicity. They seem to have intended for you to respec later."
thewitcher3,39ckl4,thebigJ_A,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:04:43 2015 UTC,"Now don't get me wrong. I'll still use Quen sometimes, but as one tool in the box rather than a crutch, and only at the very beginning of a fight. That's because lots of useful decoctions give you bonuses when, say, your health is full, or that build up over time throughout a fight until you take damage. Quen let's me slip up once without losing the bonus.  Another good skill in alchemy doesn't seem like one at first. It's the one that increases your overdose threshold, letting you fill your toxicity further before you start to take damage. Minor bonus on its own, maybe letting you squeeze another potion use in.   Combine it, though, with the skill that makes potion effects not wear off while your toxicity is over a certain %, and you've got normal potions lasting indefinitely without losing much, or any, health in the process. Semi-permanent Blizzard, or Swallow etc etc? Yes, please."

thewitcher3,39ckl4,Kaiden103,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:47:26 2015 UTC,"I recently decided to go on a Alchemy focused build (with just a couple of Combat skill to get the sweet fast attack dammages) and I only use Quenn against oponents that really way more powerful than me. (the few that can one-shot me) So far it's pretty cool. I do most fight with a 150% crit chance bonus, I play with decoctions often and I never spam quen anymore. I just keep Axii on for some control but beside that I don't really get hit.  Early on it's harder though, More rewarding but harder."
thewitcher3,39ckl4,BananaHouse,1 point,Thu Jun 11 07:35:46 2015 UTC,"My first play though on death march, quen saves my life. I have no reference on the lower difficulties, but quen is a must during certain fights for me since anything at or above my level is able to take a huge chunk away from my health.   Alchemy helps as well, especially the decoctions. Some of them have very useful effects, like an automatic quen shield when taking too much damage, healing on hit, etc."
thewitcher3,39ckl4,grayemansam,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:18:11 2015 UTC,I mostly use quen against any draconids and elementals as I find their attacks require you to roll instead of dodge a majority of the time and they also pack a pretty big punch if you get hit. I haven't found any other signs to be that useful against said enemies so I usually use quen. I also use an attack heavy build with signs as a way to control the fight.

thewitcher3,3968x2,Griffolion,7,Tue Jun 9 15:36:34 2015 UTC,"Alchemy has been made a lot more inconvenient with patch 1.0.5, though it was clearly unintentional. The game treats anything you craft the same way as it does potions/oils/bombs, so you can't craft more than 1, unless you drop the one you have, craft another, and repeat until you have the amount you want."

Surely if the developers intended Geralt to only have one alchemy substance at a time, they'd disallow pickups and make sure recipes only have requirement for at most one of a given substance.

I found the Baron's unique card in his room that way.  You can try going to Dijkstra's office in the bathhouse and checking the containers there. If that works the quest is still failed but at least you will have the card.

Locations on the map and pick up some easier quests, you could carry on with the story too, as that gets the most XP! The werewolf was quite tough at level 5, so maybe hold off until then! Also, visit place of power an gain free skill points, spend them wisely and remember to actually equipt them in your free slots! I had a slot free for a while without realising as they open up through leveling!"

thewitcher3,394khy,tincanfurball,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:19:54 2015 UTC,Are the rune slots fixed? If you reload your save you can keep picking up a piece of loot until it has your desired stats/rune slots.   I've only done this once because I absolutely love the look of the Moon Blade and mine came with shitty stats.
thewitcher3,394khy,henrokk1,2,Tue Jun 9 16:33:02 2015 UTC,I was assuming that fully upgraded that they're the best items in the game. I finished the game at level 34 and have done quite a bit of questing after that and I have yet to come across anything with better stats than my mastercrafted ursine armor
thewitcher3,394khy,allmhuran,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:42:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't been playing the game long so the truly good stuff is still some ways off for me, but I do find it kinda funny that I have some magic relic sword with three rune slots, yet last night I picked up a completely plain blackjack with three times the damage. I really dislike it when games scale all items by level like this. Damn you Blizzard!  I remember playing Baldur's Gate years ago and seeing a really super dooper cool bit of armour in a shop (in Beregost as I recall? Leather armour with stars on it). Thing is, it cost way, way more than I could possibly afford at that point in the game. But it gave me something to look forward to, a goal to achieve without some specific quest telling me that's what I should do. And that was awesome."
thewitcher3,394khy,TempestWrath,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:31:45 2015 UTC,"Even if you find a slightly better armor piece, I still don't use it because I want the school skill that gives you bonuses for each piece of the armor set you have. The overall bonus you get is probably better than the small individual upgrade."
thewitcher3,394khy,bitcasual,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:27:39 2015 UTC,Does the school skill rely on that you use the school weapons as well as the complete set of armour? I just the feline armor right now but I don't particularly like the swords.

thewitcher3,392hgf,WitchArachne,2,Mon Jun 8 22:59:50 2015 UTC,This is exactly the problem I'm having also. I'm looking at and standing next to them and nothing.

The armorer/merchant/blacksmith is standing in front of me and sometimes i can even interaxt with him but he doesn't show up on the map.  At times i am unable to interact and will need to meditate for it to work.
thewitcher3,394vin,Gamaqadra,3,Tue Jun 9 07:26:17 2015 UTC,"Basically, there's two characters that you can have an actual relationship with; Triss and Yennefer. No actions with any other characters, whether sexual or not, will have any effect on how these two feel. Your main love interest is decided at the end of each of their personal quests (Now or Never for Triss, The Last Wish for Yennefer), where you get the choice to say ""I love you"". If you tell one of them that you love them, you still have the choice to tell the other that you love them, but I wouldn't suggest doing so."
thewitcher3,394vin,MartinD63,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:28:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I did, told both of them I loved them. When finishing triss's quest I felt compelled to say it for some reason, same with after finishing yen's.  Oh well next playthrough. But I'm wondering, is anything else fair game? Like as long as I don't tell triss I love her, but do anything else like have sex, can I still successfully romance yen?"
thewitcher3,394vin,henrokk1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:47:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, nothing matters when it comes to romance, other than telling one of them that you love them, and breaking it off with the other. As far as I can recall, there's no sex scenes with Triss until after you tell her you love her. With Yen, there's a scene involving a unicorn, that you can get before you do her personal quest, so it doesn't cause any problem with Triss. The ""lesser"" characters you can have relations with don't interfere with your romance choice, either."

Kill a few geese and you've got hundreds.  I use it as support, knocking down Griffons, interrupting enemies, causing bleed, or tracking froglets etc. If you're having trouble, spec into archery."
thewitcher3,392hgc,XeliasSame,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:34:57 2015 UTC,Some bolts can be really useful.  the point of the crossbow isn't to do damage is to add cool effects and interupt ennemy

That being said though, what doesn't suffice is you no longer have a full set of armour, so you will have bits and pieces from other sets. Which is not ideal as my level 30-35 character had a little over 2000 dps silver. Now it's down to about 1800 dps even though my sword has about 200+ more damage than before."

I've also got the superior of both swords, sitting at 1400 dps. I expect possibly another 100 from the mastercrafted versions(?), but this should still be enough. I ran into an earth elemental and it took 12 hits or so to kill, I'd say I'm strong... enough."

The only stuff I left not done was all the question marks that were out to sea because frankly loot was crap, fighting was painfully easy and those god damned boots were so slow to get in/out of... as well as fucking swimming."

There will be characters you bump into where Geralt has clearly had some history with and if you check the character section under glossary that tells you all the info you need to know about the characters.

thewitcher3,38xbl2,Cythmic,3,Sun Jun 7 17:15:09 2015 UTC,God no you know how much it is to buy a rune? Like the price of 3-4 contracts. If you play death march you need every last crown. Are you not buying anything? Maybe that's why you think its too much.
thewitcher3,38xbl2,mmatt199,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:56:41 2015 UTC,Well I don't usually buy much as I mainly rely on loot. I haven't played death march yet. I tried the second hardest difficulty when I started. So far I'm not having the hardest times even when I don't buy runes and other stuff.
thewitcher3,38xbl2,mmatt199,2,Sun Jun 7 20:18:10 2015 UTC,"Craft gear, upgrade armor, buy & sell things. Use your currency before you judge it as too much. Also in the books he makes wages similar to that. Sure some contracts can be low for the ammount of work, but killing a 12ft fiend, that can one hit you at any time, then I think I deserve the extra crowns. This is the weirdest complaint I have seen yet. I feel you don't get nearly what you deserve for a contract."
thewitcher3,38xbl2,Chewabacha,3,Sun Jun 7 20:26:32 2015 UTC,I disagree. With the selling prices and buying prices as they are I would prefer to get more money. Too bad the Axii upgrades don't level up Geralts price haggling ability with vendors.

thewitcher3,38xbl2,blurry00,2,Mon Jun 8 05:08:12 2015 UTC,You saved our town from that Arch Griffon! 22 crowns.  Oh you want a chicken wing? 40 crowns.
thewitcher3,38xbl2,midgetherpes,2,Tue Jun 9 11:58:49 2015 UTC,I think somewhere in the game it mentions sometimes villagers pool in money to pay for a witcher's service.  Or they are just real rich bitches
thewitcher3,38xbl2,XeliasSame,2,Mon Jun 8 06:14:15 2015 UTC,I had a dowry from one farmer..makes complete sense they would give up all of their savings to stay alive.
thewitcher3,38xbl2,bitcasual,2,Tue Jun 9 07:08:43 2015 UTC,In the novels (I think it's mentioned in the game) they explain that either the villagers pool the money for the contract or the local lord gives them the money to pay the witcher.

It would be fun and very cool I agree, but it would be a bit out of character as I see our witcher.    In a way I could understand for Kaer Morhen to be outfited, repared and upgraded, I mean, it's the closest thing he's got of a home, but in the same time, storywise, well it just could be a very temporary home, and one that you could enter only fairly late in the game"
thewitcher3,38stee,HollandGW215,1 point,Sat Jun 6 17:33:43 2015 UTC,This is a good idea. Akin to AC franchise.   Would be a fun money dump for future DLCS.

If so, you will have to start a few of the main quests.. after doing the whole Bloody Baron section, I was able to go off and do side quests until I had just Main Story and few other level 25-35 quests.  I went to Skellige for the first time as level 19.  The only one I have stuck and can't do anything about is one the Statuette quests where you have to show it a certain sorceress.  I would recommend holding off on the ""Now or Never"" quest until you get both statuette quests.  Other than that, I haven't missed/failed anything and have ticked off all the ? on my map.  As mentioned, the ""Get Junior"" quest is tricky.  I would do any and all side quests that show up during its progression before finishing the quest line completely."

thewitcher3,38u5la,bazzingabear,2,Sun Jun 7 04:15:31 2015 UTC,I found the VG247 guide to be pretty helpful so far in this regard. I've made it a habit to check the top section for warnings (like this one) before proceeding through main quests.
thewitcher3,38u5la,TitoOliveira,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:55:38 2015 UTC,"There's no way to know that for sure. You can guess some by the description of the quests and the storyline, but not all. My recomendation is to save very often, so when you fail a quest, you can load up a savegame and do that quest that would fail.  From my experience, progressing in the Uma quest made me fail the ""Last Wish"" and the Lambert quest i forgot the name. Also there's a bunch of sidequests related to the Whoreson Junior that will fail if you jump ahead some steps."

thewitcher3,38qyse,questionforlevar,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:59:37 2015 UTC,"You would be surprised how many people don't. Most reviewers also didn't spend a good deal of time playing the game, this is exactly how reviews should be done."
thewitcher3,38qyse,Riquinni,-2,Sat Jun 6 21:42:51 2015 UTC,"Disagreed, if you can't summarize the game in less than 5 to 10 minutes then to me it's basically a let's play (which I do not watch)"
thewitcher3,38qyse,questionforlevar,3,Sun Jun 7 00:50:29 2015 UTC,"edit: Eh sorry i totally misunderstood your comment. The commenter above mean that Joe spent a lot of time on the game.  ////  Please, not all games can be summarized like that. I think Witcher is a good example. What are you going to summarize on when you don't even touch 1/1000 of what there is to experience.  in 10 mins you probably won't even get to craft your first alchemy recipe. Not going to get any weapon/armor schematic, maybe you end up not knowing there is such functionality.  What will you think about how big the gameworld is in 10 minutes? The White Orchard is pretty small. You will think the other 4 areas are similiar probably in size.  Like judging a book by it's cover or at least the first 2 pages."
thewitcher3,38qyse,nuzurame,-4,Sun Jun 7 01:43:32 2015 UTC,The whole point of a review is to summarize a game. I don't want to watch along as you play the game providing commentary along the way; it's pointless if you are able to use your words to speed things along. I want quick info not to waste a half hour to an hour watching someone playing something in order to know whether or not I like it. I could go to Twitch or something for that. It's just kind of pointless for what my watching purposes are. I just don't want to spend that much time watching what is the equivalent of a movie trailer for a game.  I probably could do better.
thewitcher3,38qyse,questionforlevar,2,Sun Jun 7 08:04:17 2015 UTC,"Wow you really don't know what you are talking about...  If your attention span can't extend 5 minutes go watch the IGN's review or Gamespots'(even they have multiple videos on the Witcher). A review should contain info about the mechanics and how it improves the game or ruins it. In a game like the Witcher 3 there is just a ton to talk about. Besides he mostly shows gameplay to prove the point he is talking about at that moment and only short clips. A review is not a summarization of just good and bad points, it should also explain why that is, how else are you going to judge if the game is good for you or not?  Totalbiscuit's ""WTF is"" usually contains just 10 minutes of option screens, but those are important too for a lot of people, although his format is not a review. A review should be a detailed as possible, that way people know you actually played the game for some decent amount of time(or to finish)."
thewitcher3,38qyse,totalvamp,-1,Sun Jun 7 08:41:20 2015 UTC,"Go watch Siskel and Ebert and tell me how long their movie reviews are, fuckwit. Games aren't hard to review. The hard part is distilling it into a quickly consumable bite size format for people to watch quickly. Let the Let's Play kiddies with no money watch you play the whole game. I'm interested in the synopsis without spoilers."
thewitcher3,38qyse,questionforlevar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:57:23 2015 UTC,"Movies are around 2 hours, TW3 is 20 times that if you are speeding through. Regardless Angry Joe doesn't just talk about the game's qualities for 30 minutes (comedy segments), and he certainly isn't making a ""Let's Play"" out of it. You obviously like reviews quick and dry but fortunately there are a lot of people who desire more depth than that. In other words, Angry Joe, AngryCentaurGaming, etc. aren't reviewers for you and it is just that simple."
thewitcher3,38qyse,Riquinni,0,Mon Jun 8 03:31:27 2015 UTC,"Eh Angry Joe's videos are hit or miss with the comedy, but I don't mind it since he doesn't sacrifice video game review content for it. If anything he just makes the reviews really really long, which I don't mind. He covers a lot of it and he seems to do good enough research on things."

thewitcher3,38qirx,PM_ME_UR_SMALL_BOOBS,8,Fri Jun 5 23:38:01 2015 UTC,The one thing that vastly charged my experience with the combat was when I learned when to roll and when to dodge. I almost never roll anymore except when fighting certain monsters.   With the ciri portion dodge is your best friend as she shadow steps as her dodge. She is a friggin flash I would just slash once or twice then shadow step behind the wolves and get some more in.  I hope this help
thewitcher3,38qirx,Prophicy,2,Sat Jun 6 00:00:17 2015 UTC,"This, it's all about the dodge. I hardly ever roll and block/counter even less.  And don't forget to have health in you quick slot, either food or swallow. Don't be afraid to roll away and regain health."
thewitcher3,38qirx,drew146,8,Sat Jun 6 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"When an enemy is about to attack its name will glow with a red hue, use this to time your dodge and then counter attack.   Rolling works well against bigger monsters, or swarms of monsters when you need to reposition yourself away from a swarm. Roll when you just feel like you're in a bad position (in the middle of a swarm, being attacked by multiple monsters at the same time) or when a monster is charging/attacking.   Blocking works best against human opponents, it still works with monsters but it is less effective and not as reliable as a dodge or roll.   Time your attacks. I don't know how it is on the lower difficulties but on death march I couldn't spam an attack unless I was in a good position. Spamming your attacks usually results in getting dodged, blocked, or countered so look carefully for openings like right after you've successfully dodged or parried something, then dodge back out and reposition yourself.   Combat works best for me when I fight like a really fast (but weak) boxer. Weave in and out, use speed and timing to your advantage, don't stay in the pocket for too long or you'll get checked with a really strong shot, and use signs and alchemy just like you would with your sword - with good timing. I just killed a lvl 32 basilisk on death march and Im lvl 18, using these methods. This is what works for me, hope it works for you too"

The game remains excellent and a lot of fun, but as is almost always the case the second time around, you find yourself putting the game aside for something else before long.  In terms of quest outcomes, there tends to be a second branch, rather than a third or fourth.  It's not as multifaceted or murky as it is made to appear, and mainly it's the mostly good or mostly scummy choice.  When it's not, it's just lesser evilism or a lack of resolution.  It's still one of my favorite games of all-time, but the second playthrough is less rich than expected.  Maybe it's because I was so completionist the first time around."

thewitcher3,38p79t,criseriksen,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:35:46 2015 UTC,"Finished the game on Normal, Death March and Easy (for Gwent cards due to bugs on Death March..) And I have to say the replayability isn't very good. Most of the different decisions don't really result in different story branches but are mere illusions of choices and solely result in a different ending video or an additional battle..  It certainly isn't even close to the same level of replayability as Witcher 2 had where half the game was vastly different.  In regards to different builds I did have some fun messing around with a Sign Igni/Axii/Griffin build on Death March but it's practically worthless against the final boss fights who are immune to Igni. The straightforward Combat/Ursine build is vastly superior."

CDPR said that if they didn't lower the particle effects, density, etc., that they would have had to make the PC version completely separate from the console version, like they did with The Witcher 2. For that game it was possible, but for the scale and depth of The Witcher 3, it just wasn't.   They had to balance looks with performance and quality. I think they did it perfectly, but then again I am a huge Witcher fan.   I admit the game has a few rough textures, but all in all, I find myself just staring at environments and the lighting sometimes.   Such an incredible game. The new standard for quality RPGs imo."

Crafting isn't really necessary unless you start working on the witcher gear sets."
thewitcher3,38nyyp,H_Balck,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:34:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, to answer your second question.  You'll come across equipment that's better than what you can craft to begin with, but as most of the gear in game is levelled, you can craft un-wearable armour and sell it (same goes for weapons, just make sure you find an appropriately-leveled blacksmith/armourer)... Just make sure you keep the Witcher gear that suits you as it all can be upgraded.  And yeah, go explore, get into fights, Quen can help you a lot when fighting higher-level miscreants, regardless of species. You'll come across a lot of fights that that you won't win. There's no shame in retreating and going back later when you can tackle whatever's in your path."
thewitcher3,38p92j,shentheory,2,Fri Jun 5 18:22:02 2015 UTC,"This is easily one of the hardest fights early game. Use the Yrden (magic trap) sign as often as possible to slow them down, and dont over extend yourself on an attack. You can do it - its just a tricky fight in a weird area, and wraiths are one of the hardest enemies to get used to fighting."
thewitcher3,38p92j,Smitty00,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:24:36 2015 UTC,"I feel your pain here. I think I died on the second phase 30 times before I simply reloaded an earlier save and went and quested for a while before coming back to it. Simply put, the original silver sword you have will NOT do the trick. (It may, but it will be a pain in the arse) Also a weird strategy I read somewhere worked like a charm. You end up getting attacked by 2 at a time on average, so you would use Axii to put one to sleep and just slay away at the other. In the second area I would start near the right section between the fences and two houses and kill the one that spawns between them in the alley then move outward from there. *This is my first Witcher game, and I began on blood and broken bones. I highly recommend finding the griffin sword to make life easier."
thewitcher3,38p92j,Masterm1nD07,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:04:16 2015 UTC,"Yrden so they stay physical and are slow.   Try and pull one away from there baron. He'll be fine if one goes after him so split them up and focus.  Be ready to dodge when one vanishes, it'll appear next to you and try a combo on you.  If you've got healing Quen, it's trivial."
thewitcher3,38p92j,thebigJ_A,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:03:54 2015 UTC,"Aside from yrden and quen, I won this by being more aggresive. I just noticed that you can't play too much hit and run with them because they eventually wear you down. Once you hit one don't stop until it teleports. Also eat food during battle and drink swallow.  If you have alternative Quen i suggest... not using it. The wraiths have an ability to ""dispell"" the shield no matter how strong it is and they always follow up quickly with next attack which is nearly impossible to dodge if you were holding alt Quen."
thewitcher3,38p92j,nuzurame,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:11:22 2015 UTC,I literally just got past this part after trying 3-5 times on blood and broken bones difficulty. First I tried the lubberkin route but then i just decided to kill it. Rule 1: ABP. always be parrying. You actually can block and deflect most attacks from the botchling. Use dodge instead of roll unless you need distance. Rule 2 use axii sign on it constantly. At first id wait and only attack (heavy and a couple light attacks) after casting axii and stunning it. Then you realize you can land lots of hits without axii so dodge and only strike a couple times then dodge. Use axii whenever possible on it and then attack. Save your food!! Get the swallow potion and use it when you're low also thunder whatever potion for +attack. Keep on him and stay defensive. When the wraiths come you can use yrden sign on them that helps a lot. Try and take care of them but don't lose track of the botchling it will regen like crazy when he's spiked so keep on him. Just be smarter in combat don't attack too much in a row. Try that you should be fine. If you can make the oil for him I think it's the cursed oil? Definitely use that if possible I was already in the quest and couldn't craft it til after. Also if you try to save it you'll have to use axii on the botchling when it starts to flip out then fight the wraiths with yrden.
thewitcher3,38p92j,TheDoob,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:19:16 2015 UTC,"One thing I did on that quest is remember where the wraiths spawned, and stood relatively close (but not too close, otherwise they don't spawn there it seems) and killed it while the wraiths were spawning so there was 1 less to deal with from the start.  Playing on Death March, so should work for you as well."

I was having a challenge against B&BB but had only died a couple times and was having fun, until it got to this fucking part...   I literally must have died about ~30 times or so before I realised they slowed down using Yrden, then continued to die for another ~20 times before finally getting past the second round of fucking wraiths haha.   Although saying that I haven't really found another fight that's made me rage as hard as that (still on B&BB) and i'm nearly finished! the difficulty definitely spiked there haha.   p.s I know I could've turned the difficulty down, but I refused to do so out of pride. fite me"

I didn't hear this crap about Japanese developers developing Japanese games for the Japanese. Why can't a Polish company develop a game which is Polish-centric and not be criticized for it? Why the hell is having a all white cast in a video game world which is predominantly all white a bad thing?
thewitcher3,38m63c,Brevard1986,7,Fri Jun 5 05:54:09 2015 UTC,Because there are people who peddle victimhood and are professionals are being offended.  It is much easier to coerce others to bow down to their pet peeves than to actually do the work of making something to reflect their culture.
thewitcher3,38m63c,H_Balck,3,Fri Jun 5 13:30:23 2015 UTC,Because japaneses aren't white and that Polygon is against white people.

Why does Chmielarz point out the obvious flaws in Maciak? Why isn't there, well, an ethnic minority like myself doing this? Shouldn't I be standing up to write the same thing Chmielarz has done? Shouldn't I ""represent"" a portion of ethnic minorities?   At the same time I'm wondering if that's necessary. Should a ethnic minority ""represent""? Maybe more importantly, will people care? Argh I don't know.   Honestly, I feel that in the video game industry race and sex issues usually (not always but surprisingly common) get blown out of proportion by people (i.e. the minority or people who wish to represent their idea of the minority). I agree with some (few)  points and disagree with some (many) points.  Or maybe there should be more ethnic minority writers calling this shit out. Maybe more women calling shit out as well."

Maybe not as important on Normal, but still fun as hell to throw some grapeshots   So I've noticed that Bombs and Potions replenish after I meditate, does this always happen after I meditate? I notice that after I finish meditating it says something about alcohol. I'm not sure what that means.   Any crafted items will be replenished after meditating. If you have alcohol in your inventory, one will be used to refill ALL of the alchemy items you've used.   Do oils replenish after meditation as well? (Like the bombs and potions)    oils are different. They are applied to your weapon. If you see a little tear drop on your weapon, select it and it should tell you how many charges are left. Once the charges are gone, you can apply another oil on it. The actual oil never runs out, just the charges on your weapon   What is Alcohest? I did a quick google search on it and it says something about replenishing oils, bombs, potions, etc. Would regular alcohol work too?

thewitcher3,38n2ot,xXBacchusXx,2,Sun Jun 7 03:57:59 2015 UTC,"When I started to play this game I think of alchemy as a some kind of 'meh'... Okay, it's very lore-friendly (potions and mutations ofc, not the bombs), but i decided to just ingore it. Ive made 50/50 build witch signs and combat. And around lvl 20 I just felt that something is wrong. Signs as portrayed in The Witcher games are way too powerfull! Not in a gameplay way, but a lore way. In books, witcher's signs were just tiny, simple spells, bearly focusing a pinch of magical energy. For example Aard could push away (sometimes put prone) one person, Igni could ignite a bonefire or make minor burns on someone skin, etc. So I decided to reset my skills and this time put something into more lore-friendly alchemy, instead of signs. I just put 13 skill points in alchemy, maxing out Heightened Tolerance, Acquired Tolerance and Refreshment. And the game just became much easier with this build! (playing on Blood and Broken Bones) EVERY dose of potion heals Geralt for 25% hp and you can drink two decoctions plus a bunch of regular potions without rising toxicity to unpleasant levels. So yes, alchemy in this game is very, very usefull and can be very powerfull. But I think only on higher charactel levels and further into the game, when you have access to more advanced potions recipes and decoctions.  TL;DR: Alchemy super OP as an addition to sword builds but only on mid-game (and further) and when you have access to a lot of good potion recipes."

thewitcher3,38lguv,cdrewsr388,3,Thu Jun 4 23:56:13 2015 UTC,What you are experiencing is the xp bug.  Quest 6 levels or more lower than you do not usually give xp.  That is by design and not the bug.
thewitcher3,38lguv,theBlakeBrown,1 point,Fri Jun 5 01:14:53 2015 UTC,"I know about that.  What about the level 20 quest not giving me XP, or the level 12 quest?"
thewitcher3,38lguv,Sixan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:07:13 2015 UTC,"he is saying you are experiencing the bug now because you are getting no xp, regardless of quest level. when the bug is fixed you will still not get xp from quests 6 levels lower than you because it is just a game mechanic not the bug"
thewitcher3,38lguv,thebigJ_A,2,Fri Jun 5 09:09:22 2015 UTC,No. Six levels below you are SUPPOSED not to give Xp. That's not a bug.   The bug is the quests of higher level than that not giving XP.   Man that piece of misinformation is irritating. They even reported it wrong on rockpapershotgun
thewitcher3,38lguv,thebigJ_A,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:39:21 2015 UTC,So the bug is that the level 20 quest did not give my level 15 geralt any xp?
thewitcher3,38lguv,thebigJ_A,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:54:58 2015 UTC,"The bug is that you didn't get xp. Like everyone has said, the bug is that some people aren't getting xp for quests.  The game is designed to not give people experience for quests very far below their level, just like you don't get xp for monsters far below your level. Both the monsters and quests that don't give xp will have gray labels.   If you didn't get xp for a quest, and it isn't one such low-level, gray-labeled quest, you have the bug.  It's not the end of the world. It'll be fixed in a few days and it's very easy to be overleveled anyway. You can use it to move the quests you get closer to your level if you are. Or you can just do side stuff for a bit."

thewitcher3,38iqia,dboti,5,Thu Jun 4 14:35:07 2015 UTC,Go to Velen and play innkeepers and merchants.  Also check their wares to see if they sell cards.  Theres a Gwent quest to play some slecific innkeepers that you get once beating any one of them from that quest.  They will give you more names to play for rare cards.
thewitcher3,38iqia,dboti,2,Thu Jun 4 14:15:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't get chance to play the Baron, but tried beating the boat-maker in Oreton and he beat me a few times for the one quest. Main issue I'm having is my spy and my one Hero card never seem to be drawn... I'm guessing I need to duplicate my cards or get higher level ones of the same type?"
thewitcher3,38iqia,dboti,2,Thu Jun 4 14:38:24 2015 UTC,"It is pretty luck based on what cards you draw.  Even though you can have as many cards in your deck, I find it best to keep it as low as I can.  Usually between 22-25 cards unit cards.  That way have a higher chance of drawing your better cards.  I think I only have 2 spies in my deck.  Also for a while I had only 1 or 2 hero cards but there comes a point in the game where Hero cards become too abundant.  I believe thats more in around Novigrad though.  Hopefully this helps.  I was in a pretty similar boat as you."
thewitcher3,38iqia,dboti,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:28:02 2015 UTC,Is it always a pick of 10 random cards outta 22?
thewitcher3,38iqia,biznizza,2,Fri Jun 5 16:27:26 2015 UTC,Well its the 22 random cards plus howeverany special cards you have.  So with the weather cards and decoys you will have more.  I think my North deck has 31 cards in it.  So I get 10 of those randomly each time I play.
thewitcher3,38iqia,biznizza,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:36:19 2015 UTC,"Sorry about all the questions,  btw. I skipped the tutorial in order to BEHEAD SHIT. Sorry. It happens."
thewitcher3,38iqia,swelteh,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:27:58 2015 UTC,No problem.  I did the same thing and felt behind at first with Gwent.
thewitcher3,38iqia,alexandjef,2,Fri Jun 5 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"it's all about Spies (they're hard to get but try to have as many as you can, 3? 4 maybe?), and IF your opponent has spies then it also becomes about Decoys.  After that, it becomes a matter of their deck. Some decks can be countered by simply changing your own. if a deck has a ton of Monsters that all call each other out from the draw pile, the front-line will fill up immediately. Then it's either freeze time, or lose a round on purpose to make your opponent waste his cards.  ALSO, sometimes after a round-1 win, the opponent will pass on his first turn, essentially giving you a free round. OR sometimes in the 2nd round, after you play ONE spy on his board, he will pass. Free turn."
thewitcher3,38iqia,TitoOliveira,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:33:54 2015 UTC,"also if you KNOW your opponent is drawing super hard(lots of spies) and has a ""clear weather,"" then either have two freezes or try to make them waste it on another weather card.  Also luck. Lots of luck."

thewitcher3,38gyu3,amnesiac808,2,Thu Jun 4 05:12:55 2015 UTC,"LB and RB let you switch between decks in gwent EDIT: you can use 'option' on the DS4 and the pause menu will let you access your Gwent deck outside of actually playing the game, though you can prep decks before each game. You have 4 different ""factions"", or decks, to choose from:  Nilfgaard, scoia'tael, Monsters, and the main one you start with Northern Realms. The elven card you got is probably in the scoia'tael deck.  I'm sure there are videos that give a good run down of Gwent, it's not too difficult once you get a hold of better cards. You want a lot of spy cards because they allow you to draw extra cards from your deck, medic cards to bring cards back from the discarded pile, and decoys to pull cards off the board and use later (again, more effective on spies and medics). This way you can outlast NPC decks by forcing them to play all their cards before you run out. I've played maybe 20 games, still in Velen, and have only lost a few times. But it's extremely satisfying when you win."

thewitcher3,38gpf9,lilpolishgangsta,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:25:45 2015 UTC,"It's not necessary, i would even recommend to finish the quest line Now or Never later, as it involves Triss as lot. You can make some decisions in that quest, which aren't revocable.   Just go to Skellige and check your quest log, whether a quest or two has been marked as failed.  Meet the other woman in Geralt's life before you make a decision you regret later."

thewitcher3,38hqxg,few23,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:23:27 2015 UTC,Yes but I've also tried killing the botchling
thewitcher3,38hqxg,TheDoob,7,Thu Jun 4 08:24:33 2015 UTC,"If you go the Lubberkin route, cast axii on it when it starts to struggle in the Baron's arms. It will chill out and you can concentrate on the wraiths, use yrden on them. It freaks out 2 or 3 times up the hill, IIRC."
thewitcher3,38hqxg,Kaiden103,1 point,Thu Jun 4 08:29:44 2015 UTC,I literally just got passed this part after trying 3-5 times on blood and broken bones difficulty. First I tried the lubberkin route but then i just decided to kill it. Rule 1: ABP. always be parrying. You actually can block and deflect most attacks from the botchling. Use dodge instead of roll unless you need distance. Rule 2 use axii sign on it constantly. At first id wait and only attack (heavy and a couple light attacks) after casting axii and stunning it. Then you realize you can land lots of hits without axii so dodge and only strike a couple times then dodge. Use axii whenever possible on it and then attack. Save your food!! Get the swallow potion and use it when you're low also thunder whatever potion for +attack. Keep on him and stay defensive. When the wraiths come you can use yrden sign on them that helps a lot. Try and take care of them but don't lose track of the botchling it will regen like crazy when he's spiked so keep on him. Just be smarter in combat don't attack too much in a row. Try that you should be fine. If you can make the oil for him I think it's the cursed oil? Definitely use that if possible I was already in the quest and couldn't craft it til after.
thewitcher3,38hqxg,SantasSatanicArmy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"If you're doing the lubberkin, the wraiths have one move that kills me most and that's when they do the teleport behind you and swing twice which can still hit you even if you dodge. Wait for them to do this, then dive away and cast the magic circle, get a few hits in and repeat. Also don't forget to use potions and oils!"

thewitcher3,38ffcx,TitoOliveira,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:57:30 2015 UTC,give it a try i still think it looks better than having hairworks off. but you're right it still does look great even with it off

thewitcher3,38dw85,JRAtk94,19,Wed Jun 3 16:48:04 2015 UTC,"If it's actually ~63k, then it is a little weird.  However, if your crowns really do reset after getting too many, then this sounds like an integer overflow issue. If that's the case then 65,535 (which is the value of 216 - 1) would make sense since the range of an unsigned int in C (or C++) is 0-65,535."

thewitcher3,38dw85,I2egular_P091,2,Wed Jun 3 19:00:42 2015 UTC,There is a loan shark on the east  side of novigrad. I go to him every time I need to sell stuff because he sells heaps of florins. What you need to do is buy all his florins then sell everything you don't need. Then you go to the bank to exchange the florins for crowns.

I ended up with the same amount as I would have if I had just sold the stuff I didn't need and didn't mess with Florins. In other words, the loan shark's and Vivaldi's Crown/Florin exchange rate is the exact same and it doesn't do anything to buy from the loan shark and sell to the banker."
thewitcher3,38dw85,Mojakd,2,Thu Jun 4 02:11:05 2015 UTC,"The only reason to buy florins it to ""increase"" the loan sharks wallet so you can sell more useless goods. For example I will buy 1000 florins for 3000 crowns so I can sell 3000 crowns worth of goods. Then I will for to the bank to exchange 1000 florins to get my 3000 crowns back."

thewitcher3,38h4k7,moshiXmoshi,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:39:28 2015 UTC,"Idk if you mean it's always full or just that you have a lag problem or both? The items that seem to not stack are some alcohol, trophys and contracts/notes. Maybe try selling some of your consumables, since that's the tab you interact the most with. All the junk should be sold or dismantled and maybe sell some trophy you don't use, they weigh a lot. About any type of lagging, might have to lower settings or resolution, on pc changing to full screen sometimes make a huge difference."

thewitcher3,38h4k7,KungFuRichie,2,Thu Jun 4 10:14:47 2015 UTC,"Ya totally agree the books/notes need their own tab but usually when things are in consumables it means it's not nessassary for any quests, but to be safe you should read all books before selling.

I think you're doing something wrong. Every day i play this game i get more immersed. The character customization is pretty sweet. I would say, if you're not enjoying yourself. Buy a potion of clearance (respecs all your ability points) and clear all your skills and do something completely different to change the way you play your Geralt. 40 hrs is nothing...."

Sure you could just streamline the story path  but then you will have to ask yourself why you even picked it up in the first place if that's all you are going to do !
thewitcher3,38hvau,dboti,1 point,Thu Jun 4 13:36:38 2015 UTC,I think if you want to finish this game put it down for a couple weeks if you are truly bored and it feels like a chore.  Let your mind renew and come back into it somewhat freah.  Long games arent for everyone and I can understand that you could get burnt out.  A break should recharge your fun with the game.
thewitcher3,38hvau,XMenOrangesTangerine,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:28:32 2015 UTC,"Sadly that doesn't work for me. I don't think I've ever finished a game without restarting from the beginning, when I've taken a break. I have a very hard time connecting to the story, if i leave it for too long :( That's not the games fault, though."
thewitcher3,38cszu,Shaherin22,2,Wed Jun 3 11:36:33 2015 UTC,"I never played Witcher 1, and I didn't play enough of Witcher 2 to get super attached to Triss.   So when I started playing Witcher 3 and there's all this talk of Yennefer being Geralt's true love, I took their word for it and stuck with her."
thewitcher3,38cszu,XMenOrangesTangerine,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:17:41 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean, her arc in Novigrad seems so urgent it doesn't rightly make sense to just.. straight up ignore it? You can help her and still turn her down at the end but you're right about how they kind of force Yennefer on you. You can't even ""end"" the relationship with Yen until after you complete her side quest and it ends up coming off kinda cruel if you do?"
thewitcher3,38cszu,pickypicnic,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"True you can just turn Triss down, but there is no real reason to actually choose Yen over her at that point other than trying to stick to what Geralt would probably want, or if you plan to choose neither. I'm not there yet but being with Yennefer now in Skelliger already makes me feel bad so that's probably going to be pretty brutal."
thewitcher3,38cszu,dboti,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:56:58 2015 UTC,I felt like a dick at the end of Yennefers questline.  It got my desired results but I wanted to be nicer.
thewitcher3,38cszu,ImSpitefulCrow,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:31:18 2015 UTC,Pretty much in the same boat as you. Own Witcher 1 but can't stand the controls so could never make it through so I watched a synopsis. Witcher 2 was great. Gave it 1 play through on the side of Iorveth (he just looked too bad ass). I love Triss. Yen was cool but was presented early on in Witcher 3 as kind of stuck up and sort of a bitch in my opinion. I understand that she is hurt by what has transpired between her friend and Geralt so I get it but I just had no personal emotional attachment to her since she was absent in the the second game completely.  Just started my second play through and plan on shooting for Yen this time so I can see the other side of the coin.

thewitcher3,38bokm,jdpn24,2,Wed Jun 3 04:27:44 2015 UTC,"Play tactfully. Highest card count wins. Make use of weather cards to screw your opponent over without hurting yourself. Most important, read the card abilities. Keep your deck small."
thewitcher3,38bokm,emerceli,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:27:29 2015 UTC,"Weather cards are a waste unless you know you will face a certain kind of attacks, against monster decks for example. Most enemies will use weather and clear weather cards themselves, so every creature card you draw puts you ahead of them in attack power.  The Lord Commander of the North leader ability is great to remove weather effects, should your enemies use them.  I play a Northern Realms deck with only 2 special cards (2x Commander's Horn) and can't remember the last time I lost."
thewitcher3,38bokm,superus3r,0,Wed Jun 3 18:38:01 2015 UTC,"Playing a spy and then a weather card to cancel it is far from useless. I recommend the melee and ranged weather cards as the ai will use those types the most frequently. The siege weather isn't as needed since ai doesn't use it that much. Also I am familiar with that leader as its the one I use the most.  Also i would argue that no card is useless. It all depends on the strategy you employ. What's useless for you may be a trump card for me. For example, I don't like using the decoy card but others swear by it. Its a good card and has its uses, but it doesn't fit into my strategy."

thewitcher3,38bokm,XeliasSame,0,Thu Jun 4 10:26:27 2015 UTC,"Playing a spy and then a weather card to cancel it is far from useless   4 attack spy + weather card = +1 attack for your opponent 4 attack spy + 6 attack unit = +2 attack for you  3 attack difference in your favor between those two plays and when you have good cards, the difference will usually be even more than that.  Also, weather cards are situational and can be completely useless in certain matchups. Losing one card can make a difference of 32 attack power (Catapults). Unit cards on the other hand are always useful."
thewitcher3,38bokm,superus3r,0,Thu Jun 4 17:22:51 2015 UTC,"They can be useful in every matchup. It would affect all cards on that row, not just the spy. For example I play my melee spy, ai plays another melee. I play my ice weather and both the ai cards are bumped to 1. Then I'd just play ranged and siege cards for the win. Its really a simple strategy if you know what you are doing and understand Gwent and how the ai plays. I have never lost a Gwent game using this strategy."
thewitcher3,38bokm,emerceli,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:33:31 2015 UTC,"You're constructing a perfect scenario, but that doesn't always happen. Having a deck that performs good regardless of what the opponent does is better."
thewitcher3,38bokm,superus3r,0,Fri Jun 5 17:34:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly, my deck and strategy works against all opponents. Im not making a perfect scenario but I'm speaking from experience after beating the game and Gwent questlines."
thewitcher3,38bokm,emerceli,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:45:47 2015 UTC,"Drawing a ranged weather card against monster decks that are almost exclusively close range sounds great, yeah. Really putting that experience to good use there."
thewitcher3,38bokm,superus3r,0,Fri Jun 5 17:49:42 2015 UTC,That's why you trade it out at the beginning? Do you even Gwent?
thewitcher3,38bokm,emerceli,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:51:36 2015 UTC,"That's a waste of one card switch. You make a sucky deck on the assumption that you can just switch two of the worst cards? Genius, really."
thewitcher3,38bokm,superus3r,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:55:33 2015 UTC,"Sometimes the quest line will throw gwent players with gwent decks that are more advanced than yours. While part of it is skill and luck, losing might be contributed also to the fact that your opponent has better cards than you.  If that's the case, go around inns and buy some cards to add to your deck. I've been winning gwent against some pretty tough guys, and I wouldn't be able to without certain cards: medic cards, rallying horn, decoy, spy cards.   Most of the above cards can easily be bought or won over through battling other weaker people"

thewitcher3,38bokm,Lundurro,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:16:35 2015 UTC,Talk to lots of merchants and innkeeps some have cards on them. White orchard's inkeep has very important ones but if you've fought the griffin it's gone till patch 1.4.   What really got me started was beating the baron though. Took me a couple of tries but I learned how to play the game well. Haven't lost since and I've beat. Everyone up to novigrad.
thewitcher3,38bokm,RedBeardedT,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:25:30 2015 UTC,"Card advantage is so important in Gwent that a good strategy is to actually play several spies, and throw the round. Also if you're a good bit ahead, but pretty sure they can beat you with enough cards, pass and let them waste their cards doing it; it'll just set you up to win the next two rounds.  Don't concentrate on getting the biggest numbers, or winning every round. What it's really about is positioning yourself to hsve more cards than your opponent come the last round."

thewitcher3,38aokb,star_witness,3,Wed Jun 3 01:46:29 2015 UTC,While you often find sword upgrades I find the witcher armor to be the only suits worth wearing.   It is kinda odd how they trivialized the armor in that way.  I see no reason not to wear master crafted witcher gear end game outside of fashion hunting.
thewitcher3,38aokb,Ripple_Derple,3,Wed Jun 3 00:32:29 2015 UTC,While it is pleasing to wear a full witcher armour set and swords I'm also getting bored of the same look while I'm waiting to be a high enough level for the next upgrade.  Looting has lost it's charm knowing 99.9% of the time it's under levelled and powered.
thewitcher3,38aokb,moshiXmoshi,2,Wed Jun 3 04:47:00 2015 UTC,Yes! That's exactly it. I couldn't quite put my finger on it but that's exactly the issue. Its hard to have fun looting when you've already got the best gear for levels to come.

thewitcher3,38aokb,Societyinflames,2,Wed Jun 3 19:09:40 2015 UTC,"In terms of armor I'm a fan of wearing stuff that is aesthetically good over armor rating good. Like Fry959 said, I would wear the Temerian Armor most of the time, switching the chest to Redanian Halberdier when in the cities, and finally Cidarian Cavalry chest armor when riding around exploring. I'm playing on Sword and Story difficulty (got crushed on Broken Bones!) so the lower armor rating makes this level more difficult and challenging too!"
thewitcher3,38aokb,Fry959,1 point,Fri Jun 5 06:34:33 2015 UTC,I get what you mean about wearing whats aesthetically good. I personally have a hard time wearing something I'm not convinced is better. I actually started the game on Broken Bones and got crushed a lot but found that it made a much better player. I really gives you a sense of challenge and that you need to prepare for your encounters to come out of it alive as well as utilizing your entire arsenal of signs. If you're feeling up to it I suggest you try Broken Bones again!

That being said the world has become somewhat empty when it comes to monsters. I thought the caves that remain white would responsible some monsters to kill but sadly I guess they dont. I too need some resources to make oils, potions and bombs but I guess we might have to wait for some sort of update."

Edit: Are you sure it explicitly states that they the maximum size available? In the description mine say 100 maximum inventory weight..... but ive just fast travelled to midcopse and the merchant has a 30lb bag, description says 30 maximum inventory weight, i would assume thats what yours says and its just telling us that it up our maximum weight by said number. However the 100lb bag is called the zerrikanian saddlebag, i've not played a witcher game before but from dialogue ive heard in this one, id assume that zerrikanian is the best.

thewitcher3,387j5f,lumuba,4,Tue Jun 2 15:33:49 2015 UTC,"You probably have like 147 wolf hides, 84 cow hides, 37 bear hides etc. in the junk tab of your inventory.  That stuff weighs a ton. Sell it down to stacks of 5-10.  Your issue will be fixed.   There is no reason to hoard in this game.   Good luck."
thewitcher3,387j5f,Ripple_Derple,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:26:33 2015 UTC,I actually probably do. I just started selling stuff. It's just that I am hesitant to get rid of them since they might be needed for crafting
thewitcher3,387j5f,lumuba,3,Tue Jun 2 22:04:49 2015 UTC,"Completety understand.   If u keep 5-10 of each on hand u will be able to craft what u need.  The hides to my knowledge arent used in any sort of bulk for any of the witcher armors I created.   The various leather pieces that u get from dismantling are what is used.    I even threw an entire set of normal griffin aside for the enhanced chest I couldn't wear yet at level 14 on the ground when I made the cat armor.  I easily crafted another normal set thru full enhanced with no issues at level 15.  Im not advising you not to loot as u go, you will certainly want to do so for rarer ingredients and recipes.  Just understand that there is an absolute abundance of hides available as u go so it is safe to reduce your stock.  Also mugs, ladles, broken axe heads..broken rakes..u dont need that junk...  Now if your goal is to craft everything in game you might rethink and hoard.  You wouldnt use the stuff and couldnt hold it all anyways reguardless of weight due to inventory grid.  I even sold all but my very best tools because honestly spending money on repairs is nothing.    My goal is to be able to carry full sets of witcher gear so I can respec and try different playstyles easily.  Your goals may vary."
thewitcher3,387j5f,Ripple_Derple,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:02:32 2015 UTC,"thanks! this was really helpful! i haven't thought about it much, but i like what you are planning to do. selling vs dismantling is another issue for me. I don't know what to sell and what to dismantle. I haven't been dismantling much up to now due to cost, but I'm not sure what I should do.  Also, I am not sure whether selling straight away makes more money, or whether I should be dismantling and then selling (I feel that would probably not be very cost effective though)."
thewitcher3,387j5f,lumuba,2,Tue Jun 2 23:12:35 2015 UTC,"Just sell bandit swords, armor u find.  I didnt wear much stuff from chests early game.  Upgraded the starting armor and wore that till griffin.  Dismantling imo is more useful for monster parts.   Sometimes you need a monster eye or some monster dust, dismantle a nekkar eye or some specter dust and most likely u have everything else.    I typically use the best swords I have and dont only use witcher set swords.  I will pop runes in them, and then dismantle them as I outgrow and replace them.  Same thing for any non witcher armor found and slotted early game. This gives u your runes back most importantly.  It is silly to keep dismantling swords for an iron ingot and leather scraps once u have 10-20 already.  The scraps are used in quite a bit in groups of 3-4 so that is one material u dont necessarily want to sell down to 5 etc.  Then again if you have 5-10 of each hide its again a non issue as u just break those down should need arise.  Between the side quests and the amount of florins/orins you also get money quickly becomes a non issue.  I can easily craft as needed, buy every recipe and gwent card I come across etc.  I did not do either money exploit either. If u are ever absolutely strapped for cash you can buy sea shells (2 types) from a merchant in heirarch square, dismantle them at the armorer and then sell them to him.  Should he run out of money meditate for 5 days and talk to him and he will have money again.  The seashell merchant also resets every time u speak with him.    I did not do the money exploit, I however do cheese his $$ by meditating so I can sell him all armor and swords.  He has kept everything ive sold to him in stock, so should i want something back I can simply rebuy it.  Kinda a cheat around storage capacity also.    When I threw that armor on the ground in front of him i had hoped it might stay there, it didnt, this seemed like an easy solution."

thewitcher3,385qco,Ninjalada,4,Tue Jun 2 01:16:19 2015 UTC,"Well the best cards come from winning although you can catch up if you have the money to spend on cards from inn keepers. I decided very early on, like tutorial early, that I didn't want to play Gwent until I got better cards. I kept buying them from every merchant and inn keeper I came across. Unfortunately I was consumed with finishing quests and subsequently killed an NPC from the decisions I made, losing a card I could win from said NPC. I then actually learned to play Gwent and found it really fun. Its honestly mostly loading as many decent cards as you can and playing the RNG game. Keep replaying the NPC until you get a winning hand. This guys guide was helpful when I was getting into Gwent a few days ago. I disagree that you have to keep playing to get good at the game as I think you only need to really understand what it takes to win to be good a Gwent so I didn't bother challenging every single NPC to Gwent. The most useful tip he gave was that you need to stack your deck with counters against whoever you're playing against for that rare card. For example, monster decks have a lot of melee units and musters, thus stacking biting frosts is really effective against that player. http://www.vg247.com/2015/05/22/the-witcher-3-how-to-win-gwent-guide/"

By that time, I still have 5 more cards than them, and if they are half decent I usually win"
thewitcher3,385qco,Kaiden103,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:37:34 2015 UTC,It's a vicious cycle...
thewitcher3,385qco,xX_PHaTAss_Xx,-2,Tue Jun 2 01:23:33 2015 UTC,Gwent isn't difficult.
thewitcher3,384kom,Khlilo98,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:28:04 2015 UTC,So new DLC every Tuesday until they're done with 16 free?
thewitcher3,384kom,NormThaPenguine,1 point,Tue Jun 2 13:47:50 2015 UTC,I hope one of the dlc s would be more monsters. I only come across wolves are drawners these days. And the occasional level 8 bandits.
thewitcher3,384kom,Grsn,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:28:28 2015 UTC,"I really don't know what's the point if this DLC if it's going to be a low level armor like the Temeria one. It will be nice for a couple hours and that's it. I don't really want to sound ungrateful but it seems so pointless. If there was a transmog option I would understand, though."
thewitcher3,384kom,TibiWolf,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:21:31 2015 UTC,Omg what if the last dlc IS transmog ... So many choices. I would just replay it to get every armor even common ones cause they look awesome .
thewitcher3,384kom,NaomiLing,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:33:30 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. At first I figured ""ah it's free so whatever"" but none of them have been even slightly exciting besides the haircut one."
thewitcher3,384kom,b4gelbites,0,Tue Jun 2 00:26:18 2015 UTC,Fucking dank. Most of the armor looks like absolute shite. Hopefully the new armor does Geralt some justice.
thewitcher3,383nee,Balzich,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:52:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried fighting that guy when level 15 too, no problem I thought. He got to half HP, then BAM 3 giant devil wolves. So I'll be going back for that, along with 4-5 other guarded treasures that were too strong. Although I did manage to lure a skull wraith away from one and double back to get it the chest without fighting him. Although to do it I had to fight this games UBER boss: Gravity. Luckily the 2 1/2 foot fall didn't QUITE kill me with the +500 vitality skill point equipped."
thewitcher3,383nee,SemiFormalJesus,5,Mon Jun 1 21:33:33 2015 UTC,You can spam jump when falling. Geralt will then roll and absorbs most (if not all) of the damage.
thewitcher3,383nee,Trylw,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:09:35 2015 UTC,"Yep I remember that, got me the first time, apparently he does a howl which summons the wolves mid-fight."
thewitcher3,383nee,DKRises,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:24:26 2015 UTC,"I came near a ? mark with 2 skull ?? wyvern. Got interested, almost got killed. I run. The wyvern chase me across a good portion of the map, next to a small village. He quickly destroys it. Did a rollback. :/  I don't understand the logic. Some enemy stop chasing past a certain distance, other seems capable to run across the map to have your life."
thewitcher3,383nee,Bloodclad,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:11:26 2015 UTC,"Okay, so its been awhile now, and I guess I forgot about the 3rd wolf after my OP. So I have done a lot of questing and almost level 18 now. I just got the masquerade quest. During the starting conversation at the gate I see a that damned wolf jumping around attacking off screen at people. Last wolf let me level up but waited until I was disarmed"
thewitcher3,385w8h,CaDoran,2,Tue Jun 2 02:00:06 2015 UTC,Hattori is also a Tarantino reference.
thewitcher3,385w8h,KungFuRichie,2,Tue Jun 2 02:30:03 2015 UTC,Actually the hattori name is based on a real guy and has been referenced in a bunch of films before kill bill.
thewitcher3,385w8h,joshlove,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:47:45 2015 UTC,"Yes it is, and he has."
thewitcher3,385w8h,KungFuRichie,2,Tue Jun 9 22:45:47 2015 UTC,Mhmm! Wasn't sure if this was just me. I wish they would quote it multiple times.
thewitcher3,385w8h,I_love_Matty_B,2,Tue Jun 2 07:01:51 2015 UTC,they do !
thewitcher3,385w8h,XeliasSame,2,Tue Jun 2 08:39:38 2015 UTC,Don't they mean Uma when they mention the gimp?
thewitcher3,385w8h,Turlututu1,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I believe they are reffering to Uma with this dialogue."
thewitcher3,385w8h,Snowkeeper23,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:20:21 2015 UTC,No. Its a direct quote from when bruce willis and marcelus wallace are about to get sodomized by zedd and that other guy.
thewitcher3,385w8h,TheAlmightyDHard,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"Latter on there's also a ""Zed's dead"" quote.  The gimp one was a bit too heavy-handed I think."
thewitcher3,386i6n,TheTwitchedout,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:02:52 2015 UTC,Geralt and Sigi are not friends although they respect each other with the game progresses. Roche all day. I don't think there's any doubt.
thewitcher3,384zr5,Kaiden103,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:08:46 2015 UTC,"You can kill chickens and geese in towns; nobody seems to care. Also, I've gotten them as random loot from soldiers and such."
thewitcher3,384zr5,xX_PHaTAss_Xx,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:29:24 2015 UTC,"To piggy back this..... if I need an iron ingot but have a dark iron ingot or can make one, are they interchangeable? I assume they're not but don't want to waste crafting materials to find oout"
thewitcher3,384zr5,The_Lion_Jumped,2,Mon Jun 1 23:51:59 2015 UTC,"I would assume that they aren't interchangeable as well, and I don't think it would make sense to make them so. I think it's safe to say that there is no need to see if they are"
thewitcher3,384zr5,Lundurro,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"First time I visited Downwarren the geese there were infinitely spawning, so I collected about twenty feathers. Might want to try there if you're having trouble getting some. I'm not sure if that is a consistent bug, but it's worth a shot."
thewitcher3,384zr5,DKRises,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:52:56 2015 UTC,Circumstance and my storyline has rendered that town...indisposed. I no longer see any geese there
thewitcher3,384zr5,cdrewsr388,-2,Wed Jun 3 10:34:08 2015 UTC,You can dismantle monster feathers into regular feathers.
thewitcher3,386bkg,_Dark,2,Tue Jun 2 04:01:47 2015 UTC,"you've one every fourth leader cards.  Some of them are pretty badass, but I'd have preferred to get some cool golden cards I think."
thewitcher3,386bkg,XeliasSame,1 point,Tue Jun 2 08:08:39 2015 UTC,Didn't think to check that. Thank you.
thewitcher3,386bkg,Blindbraille,2,Tue Jun 2 14:01:33 2015 UTC,"Apparently the answer to the op was, ""no"".  No one can explain the ending. Which is too bad cuz I would like to know how to keep all my money I won. But everyone seems to just want to whine about how much they suck at fighting, seriously? Fighting is such a joke in this game. Lt for counter, punch them until they block, rinse and repeat. If you can'tfigure tthat out go play eso."
thewitcher3,386bkg,SemiFormalJesus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:29:59 2015 UTC,It was definitely an odd way for the quest to come to a close .
thewitcher3,386bkg,NaomiLing,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:45:16 2015 UTC,"This quest is level 26, are the people you have to fight after high level? I think I could probably win the Gwent games at 15, as I've got a solid Nilfgaard deck, but I don't want to get stuck on it if I have to fight stuff."
thewitcher3,386bkg,SemiFormalJesus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:28:09 2015 UTC,They were in the red for me at lvl 16 but was able to beat them but that's cuz I always play for story/easymode.
thewitcher3,386bkg,SemiFormalJesus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"Roger. Thanks. I'll probably hold off a bit then, as I really enjoy the peek at 3 cards leader ability anyway. So versatile for turn skipping, as well as possibly dancing around scorch cards."
thewitcher3,386bkg,SemiFormalJesus,1 point,Tue Jun 2 15:50:46 2015 UTC,"The final battle shouldn't be too tough, as you can lean on your partner and use spells and potions. Be warned, however, that there is an infuriating fist fight in the middle of the tournament that can be exceedingly difficult."
thewitcher3,384yeg,Anjano-Trekk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 21:59:42 2015 UTC,It's not one of the hardest fights in the game. Anything with a skull on it's head will be a hard fight.  I did the arch-griffin in my level range and killed him within a minute easily.
thewitcher3,384yeg,DKRises,0,Mon Jun 1 22:27:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe you've misunderstood. Red skull enemies are still easy in this game, check my videos. They can be beat by stun + finishers, or exploited in some way.  But this is a true red skull, in the sense that it's as hard as it is supposed to be. You can do quests 10 levels above in the game, but with this one you really need to take care.  I hope I've explained it better, as perhaps it wasn't clear."
thewitcher3,384yeg,SmurfOpax,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:12:27 2015 UTC,Isn't there a decoction that reduces enemy damage to only 10% of your health? Seems like it would be useful here.
thewitcher3,384yeg,AuraGuy,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:20:29 2015 UTC,"you only need aard, it is quite easy ... get him down on the ground hit him 2 times with a sword roll away, repeat ... did it at lvl 16 without big problems"
thewitcher3,384yeg,AuraGuy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:41:55 2015 UTC,Well... Easy mode and s hell lot of dodging... Don't forget about your shotgun and quan sign
thewitcher3,3859n1,Slaytaniccc,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:17:07 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, my only thought is:   Well, if it's a Signs build, good fucking job mate.   Some of the stat numbers in this game are ridiculous though. I'm level 6 and I've got upwards of 5000 vitality. I haven't really looked at the rest of my stats though."
thewitcher3,3859n1,matrim611,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:21:35 2015 UTC,You start with like 3500 Vitality.  It increases every level and also with skills/items.
thewitcher3,3859n1,Brotano,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:45:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why you would have a sign build and be afraid to use signs?
thewitcher3,3859n1,SantasSatanicArmy,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:27:18 2015 UTC,"He just said that his stats are for some unknown reason are overpowered. Using signs with these stats would ruin the combat and make it too easy, essentially just pressing cast over and over"
