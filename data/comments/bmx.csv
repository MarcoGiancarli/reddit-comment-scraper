bmx,3e55hv,anusfloss,3,Wed Jul 22 01:07:43 2015 UTC,That's a nice trek there. Prob not the best for doing stunts but trails Would be the shit. It's prob around 1997   Don't let no one tell you it's a bad bike cause guess what it's yours not there's. Save up like a 1500-200 usd and buy a street bike when you can.
bmx,3e55hv,Kitoace,2,Wed Jul 22 02:04:42 2015 UTC,That's what I bought it for. No clue why the guy put pegs on it but they are coming off. It's a 97 ss.

bmx,3e56uj,Kitoace,2,Wed Jul 22 04:06:18 2015 UTC,If you want some nice good and cheap chrome ones. Buy Sunday saker cranks as long as you have a 19mm spindle. But yes you can RAW you cranks out by doing this.  Go buy a spray can of auto stripper. Wear gloves good thick gloves the shits no joke. Then if they look good raw clear coat them. Make sure not to get anything inside the holes of you're cranks. At least the clear coat. Hope this helps.
bmx,3e56uj,Nugenrules,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:00:05 2015 UTC,I had some redline flight crankd and they were polished not chrome. Steel is not anodized and most likely powdercoated. Powercoat is not fun to get off. You need to soak it in Aircraft Stripper but even then it won't just fall off. It'll be just soft-ish. You need to finish with sandpaper and take the softened powercoat layer off. Then do A LOT of sanding and polishing.  It would take a long long time but it'll be pretty cool. Buff wheel is recommended

A friend of mine had a kink a while ago and it worked for him just fine despite how hard he was on it.   It is a hi ten steel frame, so it's not the lightest/strongest frame material, but since you're just getting into BMX, it'll be just fine for you. I've never broken a hi ten steel frame. Overall, it's a good beginners bike that should serve you well."
bmx,3e1ddv,Nugenrules,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:18 2015 UTC,I really like my merrit bf1 tires. Grip well
bmx,3e1ddv,BmxerBarbra,2,Tue Jul 21 05:40:11 2015 UTC,"I am currently running united direct tires which are quite nice. But some of the grip issues you are having might be because tan/coloured tires are less grippy than regular tires, In the past I have run fit fafs like you have and had no grip problems at all."

bmx,3e1ddv,cfb_rolley,2,Tue Jul 21 10:15:26 2015 UTC,I run Cult Dehart front and Demolition Momentum back. They both grip good and I feel like the back tire will not move if I don't want it to and it will if I want to. They both wear out quite fast though.

bmx,3e1drb,Kitoace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:38:46 2015 UTC,I currently run a more aggressive traction in the front. Like dirt tyre and a street in the back.its my frost time doing it and I'm inciting the traction in getting. But I ride more street then park cause there's no parks in my area
bmx,3dzjeu,Dubt,3,Mon Jul 20 20:18:05 2015 UTC,Personally that first one is tits. I'd be all over that. Make sure there's no cracks or major dents. Check the bearings on everything by spinning the wheels make sure the straight. Ask him if he thinks anything should be replaced. All the parts are great   Be aware it looks like there's no brakes and no brake mounts. Not sure if that frame has mounts that can be placed on or not take that into consideration   But seeing you're 6 foot a 21 inch top tube. Would be best for you're hight. Full cromo frames are a must.
bmx,3dzjeu,Kitoace,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that first one is priced correctly, all the other ones aren't worth close to $200 at all. OP, listen to Kitoace fo reals, otherwise I might have to drive to here and buy it myself"

bmx,3dxk0s,Hipstergram,2,Mon Jul 20 10:43:10 2015 UTC,"It's clearly quite used, and unless you can ID it and figure out if it's worth getting the bike for 300$ used, then I'd just spend that money elsewhere."

The only idea I have would be to get people like AdamLZ, Boqur, and TCU to bring some attention to this sub. Like if one puts out a video and gives a shout out to /r/BMX, or asks to discuss the video here, that would probably shed a ton of light on this sub.  Other than that, it's probably just going to have to spread by ear. Reddit has almost no ads, hell I don't even think it turns a profit, so just mentioning it to people would be a good step; because I agree, this sub updates at a glacial pace."

I know when I was coming up I used to search all over for new trick tutorials in particular, there wasn't much of a local scene but I was all over 20inchnyc at the time because they had what I needed.   Also parts reviews, finding the right part was tough for us old guys cause it was whatever the local shop had in stock, now with the internet we can order anything we want so we need a good source for trusted reviews.  Also we could post dope riding spots, I mostly rode street and spent days searching for the perfect hip or ledge to hit meanwhile I would watch road fools and be like how did they find these places. Also most parks near me don't allow bikes, so listing that could be cool too.  Then we have our pictures and videos that we can brag about that I know I loved to watch and see for inspiration, since this culture is all about one upping.   I don't think we need to limit anyone or anything, but instead grow and add more content worth seeing and use our votes to keep what is relevant."

Mods will need to be positive and not fragment the community. I think we do need some more outreach to get more traffic. This thread has some good ideas but please focus on making this place more inclusive, not creating unnecessary ""rules"".  What do you recommend for identifying good mods?

bmx,3dwr4j,Fapplet,3,Mon Jul 20 10:15:20 2015 UTC,What's wrong with classic bikes? Not everyone likes to look at monocolor rigs built after 2012.
bmx,3dwr4j,Jamaican_In_NY,-4,Mon Jul 20 12:27:57 2015 UTC,Why design a Urban BMX subreddit and post bikes that look like they are for children. This subreddit has a vibe of urban and brands and shit so why mix them.

A consoles subreddit or a subreddit for each console. Make up your mind. Choose what subreddit it is. It can't be both. Also flairs should be added.  Like Video Modern BMX Old BMX Question
bmx,3dwr4j,cappehh,2,Mon Jul 20 12:55:52 2015 UTC,You're right; those of us with vintage BMX bikes should be posting on bikeporn and BMXracing.
bmx,3dwr4j,zenskybmx,-2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:14 2015 UTC,Nah man. If people care so much about old BMX pictures make their own subreddit. Type BMX and tell me what you see. A modern BMX. So that's what /r/bmx should be a modern BMX subreddit.
bmx,3dwr4j,Fapplet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:50 2015 UTC,Nowhere here does it say anything about being restricted solely to modern bmx. I think that's just what it's become because us old guys keep getting chased out of here.

bmx,3dwr4j,Fapplet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:09:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. BMX isnt what it used to be.

I'd gladly link to it on the sidebar though. BMX is moving forward, not stuck reminicing about the glory days. Shit's fucking crazy with the progression of what BMX is today.

bmx,3dwr4j,Edddit,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:20:50 2015 UTC,"How exactly are you going to enforce them? Ban them? TYPE IN CAPSLOCK? I havent banned a single person in the 4 years Ive been a mod. Yeah I havent dedicated all my off time to do what a regular website owner gets paid to do. Everything I've done here is out of pure love for the sport. Sorry I don't put any contests up because real  life shit happens to people and that's more important than making flairs for a sub reddit where the whole point is to spread info and show from time to time some of the latest sick ass video parts that drop, along with pics or clips of the local riders from who-fuckin-knows-where-ville.  My point is all you people want this to grow so large, u/zenskybmx & u/hexacat want to do all this shit(magically appearing out of thin air pointing fingers to get er done) when in reality nobody does shit except for me digging this fucking sub out of the grave 4 years ago, growing it from 50 subscribers & 10 unique hits per day to what it is today, only to just recently(probably just yesterday) get my mod permissions nerfed by zensky. So there's that. Glad to know I'm appreciated. Make's me want to continue doing shit around here, sitting in front of a fuckin computer screen instead of being outside riding filming clips for a reddit edit I've secretly been working on of the midwest scene. Nah it's cool.  But I'm 30 years old, riding for 16 years now, and I'm still doing it. Still trying to get out there 3-5 times a week cruising the streets and not get sketchy. Never once sponsored or paid other than a few contest winnings, and I have a real life job to pay to live with 0 help behind me. I can't dedicate all of my free time to organizing everything. Shits hard man. It takes time.  I'm working on shit. I FINALLY have the right schedule for getting stuff done - AMA's, a fucking street contest that I've already emailed companies for shit for, and the reddit twitter(@Reddit_bmx) & instagram(@REDDITBMX) are poppin off as well. I've talked to my personal friend, the fucking man Brandon Hoerres(name drop) of Mutiny Bikes to help update the design of the site since he writes CSS and code for an everyday living, including the Mutiny BMX website. Just be patient. Yeah it moves at a glacial pace but damn dude, ride your fuckin bike. Fuck a computer screen dude. If you can't, there's like 25 other bmx websites to go to if this isn't updated enough for you. This place is for talking to one another, but you aren't going to get the core riders of the industry spending their time trolling through every single comment answering everything. They have better things to do, like get paid to do it on their respective websites.  Reddit has literally a dickload of other subreddits to explore. Want to learn how to edit video? Fuckin hit up r/videoediting. Or damn, knowing how to accurately take and color correct a photo would be a great thing to apply to in a sport such as BMX. Maybe r/photography can help with that. They'll have links to even more dialed ass shit for you to scope out. This place is a mecca of information, not The Berrics.  People bitch about helping kids find first time bikes and if a craiglist bike is legit or how to throw a barspin, but that rider to rider interaction is the god damn point of this very website. You wont find a better place to help another person out, just for the fuck of it, than right here on Reddit. So how bout maybe next time you're lurking on r/bmx, instead of not writing a comment to help someone out, or search a website or two for information for someone to link to, do it. Shia Lebouf. DO IT. JUST DO IT. We're just mods. We're here to fix shit that's fucked up like cleaning the spam filter and banned shitlords. You, the subscribers here, are what you make of this place. You your very self. Want this place to grow? Contribute. Promote. 6,000 people can spread word of mouth about this place very efficiently. How do you casually bring it up into conversation? Fuck if I know. That'd be a random thing to bring up in all honestly.  Sorry if this rubs people the wrong way, but yeah. Enjoy what you have. Most of you don't know the bad times, or more like non existent days of r/bmx.  -n1rve"

I started building my bike up after I changed just the frame. The bike started as a 2006 WeThePeople that was just a bit short. Got the new frame, and just upgraded as I broke parts or wanted to change something(like my drive ratio). I'm still running the original forks and entire front wheel."
bmx,3dwn06,SnupeDoge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:04:42 2015 UTC,"At 5'11"" you don't need 21 or 22. 20.5-21 should be good. I'm running the Gap XL, which is $370, mostly chromoly, just not the cranks which is odd. The regular gap has smaller bars and 20.5 instead of 21 toptube. Kink Barrier is $500 and is nearly all chromoly, except the cranks once again, but a 20.75 TT. Stolen STS is significantly on sale right now, and is $470 and nearly fully chromoly, besides cranks. Don't know why you're limiting yourself to those 3 brands, but the STS seems like a good deal."

But check out the sig line, those will have the best parts as stock. But if I were you I'd consider using the money to get a new frame and wheels (if you can afford) and just build your next bike like that. That way you get to chose each part and can research the quality of them (which is higher than stock parts by a wide margin)."

bmx,3dnww8,moxihc,6,Fri Jul 17 20:23:50 2015 UTC,"Finding just the frame for a 16"" BMX bike is going to be tough as I don't think any major retailers sell just the frame for 16"" bikes.   My suggestion would be to visit Danscomp, J&R bikes, and Albes to familiarize yourself with who is producing 16"" BMX Frames. Then, check ebay and craiglist for people who may be selling just the frame in decent condition. Also, be sure to check the scratch and dent pages just in case.   I imagine you're going to find a lot of race frames over freestyle frames for a 16"". Sorry, wish I could be of more help. Best of luck!"

I haven't personally done it myself but see if you can get the line to the factory to inquire about a special order. If it's a good company I'm sure they can think of some way to help you with your situation.
bmx,3dnww8,JuanSattva,2,Sat Jul 18 02:01:10 2015 UTC,"The frames are hard to find because NOBODY builds a 16"" ground up. You are going to spend a mint on a custom your kid is going to outgrow by next season (my 8yo competes on an 18""). Then when you try to sell it you might get $50. It is a terrible investment, but if you are dead set on doing it the Wethepeople Seed is a nice frame and you local dealer should be able to order direct from the company."
bmx,3dnww8,cyberkrist,2,Sat Jul 18 10:52:26 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for an aftermarket frame for a custom, you might as well buy a high end complete and modify the parts to your preference. Cult make a complete called the Juvenile which comes in a 16"". It's around the 500 CDN price mark which is just a little more than what you would be paying for a frame alone. The Juvenile uses an aluminum frame so it's lighter than an average 16"". (Versus a hi-tensile steel frame or chromoly). I am just assuming though that you are looking for something high end/nice for your child since you are considering a custom build."

When you have bought the hub guard, there should be a replacement locknut that looks a bit like this. Average hub guards slide onto this replacement locknut that they come with. There are some designs where the guard screws into the axe itself but those are harder to find. Keep in mind most hub guards won't work with hubs that are not made to specificaly work with them: there are universal ones but one hubguard is made for one hub in particular it may not work with another one.

I haven't had any issues with it whatsoever even for being a lighter frame.  I did, however, look at a complete spec list for the United Martinez and it looks entirely solid, even the handle bar dimensions (which I rarely like on a stock bike). The only thing I saw is that it comes with United Grips, and imagine those might suck, so I would pick up either some ODI Super Soft Grips or a pair of Fit Tech grips with your order so your riding comfortably right out of the box.  Oh, and maybe one of these nextime."

bmx,3d812p,Edddit,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:32:56 2015 UTC,Scratches are okay. Its usually not worth it to weld anything but the frame and if you decide to do it please go to a professional. Keep in mind it will never have the same strength again and depending on the place of the crack it may not even be an option to weld it.

If the rubber/valve is twisting you will need 2 sets of pliers.. Preferably needle nose to hold the valve and regular for the cap!

bmx,3d60cc,Kitoace,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:08:35 2015 UTC,This happens to me a lot. The air pressure leaked from the valve steam putting more pressure on it.   Here's what I do. Grab two needle nose pliers  grab under the dust cap with out putting to much pressure on the rubber. It will rip if to much force is applied. Then grab the dust cap. Turn to loosen. If it don't loosen then you need to cut the tube out pretty much

bmx,3d2b74,spamtardeggs,2,Mon Jul 13 00:28:11 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate absolutely, but it's not Pastrana's fault personally. Yeah I'm sure he did push him to try it, but they wouldn't do that about anything they wouldn't do themselves. In the end, unfortunately, it looks like they didn't look at the physics of what they wanted to do and it cost Colin. It's sad as fuck but it's not fair to put that on Travis."

BMX is a very strenuous sport that uses basically every part of your body. If you're passionate about riding and keep at it you will get fit. If you aren't already in shape, it won't happen quickly, but unless you actively sabotage yourself, it will happen."

bmx,3d3te8,Nugenrules,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:34:06 2015 UTC,No.  Just keep doing tricks especially jumping around and you will get fit in no time. Also climb every hill.

bmx,3d2wht,frankGawd4Eva,2,Mon Jul 13 02:25:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, your totally on the right path there. While I've never used the springhanger as it appears to be a new design, it should be easy enough for anyone to install whose a little mechanically inclined."
bmx,3d2wht,SirSteyr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:12:15 2015 UTC,Cool.. it looks pretty straight forward the more I keep looking at it and even found a pretty helpful video.. my only concern with the install is the cable brackets on the frame itself..
bmx,3d2wht,SirSteyr,2,Mon Jul 13 03:35:33 2015 UTC,"The Springhanger should come with a couple of bolts that are typically 5mm allen heads. You'll just use those bolts, and maybe a few included washers, to bolt it to two adjacent holes on the rear of the frame. This design seems to have a unique way of holding tension in the arms, and even states they need only be bolted on. This is unlike some brakes which have springs that are held in small brackets near the lever mount.   So, included manuals, google, and some mechanical know how and you'll be set. Really dialing the brakes in might take some finesse, but I've always found U-brakes to be the easiest to dial in really well."
bmx,3d2wht,Edddit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"Very good.. I've been viewing some videos and it looks easy.. from what I can tell some of these don't need adjustment.. Just wired up, and done.. I like that.. I've fought with brakes in the past.."
bmx,3d1nyz,Rvatistanac,2,Sun Jul 12 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it was wearing shin pads all the time. I'm way more confident without having to worry about hurting my shins/knees. Also, like you, I moved to 8.75"" bars and I liked it way more."
bmx,3d1nyz,SirSteyr,2,Sun Jul 12 22:34:25 2015 UTC,"Frame is where I felt the biggest difference. Going from a stock frame to an aftermarket frame (Cult Dak 2015) was a huge change. So much lighter, much higher quality, feels so much better riding around, huge."
bmx,3d1nyz,mrtiggles,2,Mon Jul 13 03:42:28 2015 UTC,"Although my frame wasn't much lighter, I could definitely feel the difference in frames. Body position/ riding style, build quality(creating more confidence), and weight balancing all helped me become a better rider."
bmx,3d1nyz,ilovewaffles23,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:19:34 2015 UTC,Right? It's a huge difference and I understand why frames can be $350+ now after riding one.
bmx,3d1nyz,mrtiggles,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:30:32 2015 UTC,Bars for me too.
bmx,3d1nyz,Nugenrules,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:04:25 2015 UTC,"i change between 8.75 and 8.5 bars all the time, the smaller bars are cut for barspins and the larger bars i use to practice more control. they both feel great to me but sometimes switching helps me land a trick i was struggling with"
bmx,3d2jqa,Abraxein,3,Mon Jul 13 00:33:18 2015 UTC,You don't have enough for a budget frame. If 350 is all you have save up another hundo and buy a full cromo fully sealed and double walled rim bike.
bmx,3d2jqa,Kitoace,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:17:29 2015 UTC,Err wanted to right more after bike full cromo complete the s the word I forgot.
bmx,3d2jqa,Kitoace,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:19:40 2015 UTC,I can spare about 500 for the whole build but I'd like it to be less
bmx,3d2jqa,Nugenrules,2,Mon Jul 13 01:29:35 2015 UTC,Why not buy a complete? Granted building is more fun. But if you're just gonna cruise I don't think specific parts matter at all
bmx,3d0mtj,Merk_N_Cheese,2,Sun Jul 12 14:50:06 2015 UTC,"Look for something with an integrated headset (where the fork goes through the frame is called the head tube, the head tube will be flush if the headset is integrated) the united isnt integrated so if you fucked your forks or frame up u gotta switch both at once. None integrated also indicates the bike is hi tencile steel which is much weaker than chromoly."
bmx,3d0mtj,ProBaconPuffs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:19:18 2015 UTC,Ok I think I know what you are talking about does this bike have what you said to look for. https://chicago.craigslist.org/wcl/bik/5109422218.html
bmx,3d0mtj,SirSteyr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:35:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Sunday has an integrated headset."
bmx,3d0mtj,DirtTits,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:58:47 2015 UTC,Is $325 a fair price for that bike? I was gonna get a Sunday funday ex 2010 for 200.
