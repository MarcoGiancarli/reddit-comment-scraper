So when you want to play the maxed build you will need to copy it to HD - when you want to play the lower lvl build you will need to copy it to the HD (the existing save file on the HD will be overwritten).

bloodborne,3e2puy,pandaking6666,3,Tue Jul 21 14:33:47 2015 UTC,Since the second to last patch dungeon bosses can drop you upgrade materials. In depth 5 blood rocks are also a possibility.

bloodborne,3e2puy,OOpiumBear,0,Tue Jul 21 17:06:46 2015 UTC,IIRC there can drop 1 blood rock per chalice type but only once and 1 for every NG cycle. So you can pick up 4 from chalices and then you'd have to do cycles to get more from Mensis.

bloodborne,3e2puy,OOpiumBear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:26 2015 UTC,"The limitation was on large treasure coffins giving you Blood Rocks.

bloodborne,3e2uzu,OOpiumBear,3,Tue Jul 21 15:35:48 2015 UTC,The area is the same before and after the blood moon rises. The only difference is that snatchers are dead and the one reborn and his spawns are there and of course the opened door which lets you engage the boss. Therefore the Scurrying beast you find is the same scurrying beast no matter if it's before or after and therefore it's the same loot.

If you're partial to any build I would suggest grabbing the Saw Spear as early as you can, and going for a vit/end/skl build, maybe with some strength. I can roll through NG like this no worries, it's a really friendly build.  If that's too boring for you, my other suggestions are running the Chikage or Logarius Wheel, since not being able to monitor HP drain would be scary o3o  As for streaming, I have no clue how that works, but I'd love to see recorded segments (time zones, y'know) of boss fights/highlights. urious as to whether you'd have commentary as well."

The only problem with this is that if you do the double tap again before a video is saved, you'll lose the recording.

I'd make the next story chalice dungeon tier than the one currently in your possession available for purchase at insight bath. I'd tweak Hunter Oath Rune to exclusively pair players for PvP, with password match-making and no HP penalty. (Or another item like this) I'd make bell maidens appear whenever someone uses Sinister Bells regardless of area boss defeated. I'd give Vilebloods the increased Vial heal currently held by Executioners. (No change to Executioners Rune) I'd tweak Bonemarrow Ashe to work ""as if one had 50 bloodtinge"" meaning no damage increase when you have 50+ bt, major damage increase when you have 8 bt.

You don't need to be some kind of epic hardcore contra 3 speedrunner to beat Dark Souls or Bloodborne. In fact, Bloodborne is likely the harder of the two but neither are very hard. I introduced my girlfriend to video games using Demon's Souls and she did just fine. Early resident evil games, DMC3 on Dante Must Die, Ninja Gaiden Black, and bayonetta on Non-stop are hard games. DaS and BB have a steep learning curve, but they aren't hard in even remotely the same way those other games are.   Dark Souls/Bloodborne being hard is basically a meme. Don't be scared off by that. Don't even consider it. Just play the game as it is, and let it teach you its ways. Just be observant and patient and you'll love it."

bloodborne,3e1kvw,Raven_257,11,Tue Jul 21 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, I basically went through the same thing you did – I heard so many good things when the game came out, but the Souls/FromSoft reputation really put me off. I wrote the game off, but after seeing enough of it being played on Twitch, I came around to the idea of giving it a shot.  I got it around a week ago and I'm so fucking addicted. It plays, looks, and sounds amazing, and I get really annoyed when my roommates take the TV because I have to spend the next few hours of my free time not playing Bloodborne.  With regards to difficulty, I do think that it's overstated. If you play smart and conservative, you'll rarely die. In the dreaded first area, I had my first real death at the boss, which surprised me – I was expecting to get demolished every fight.  When I have died in this game, 9/10 times it was my fault. Sometimes I would rush into a group of enemies carelessly, sometimes I would spam attacks without paying attention to stamina, sometimes I would get greedy for more blood, etc. Although dying was really frustrating, I couldn't really fault the game for my mistakes.  There are no difficulty options, but the good news is that this is an action-RPG, so if you're really having trouble you can always grind. The cool thing about this game is you choose what stat to raise when you level up – so if you're too weak, raise vitality, need to hit more, raise strength, etc.   The other option to give yourself a boost is summoning a fellow hunter. If you look to the right there's a whole subreddit called the Hunter's Bell devoted to helping and being helped by fellow players. While it's very rewarding to solo a boss, there's nothing wrong with requesting aid if you're getting put off.  Lastly, depending on your profile I would recommend the official guide. It goes for $25 on Amazon, which is a steal considering it's a gorgeous, hardcover tome that looks like a prop from the game. I know that some people dislike guides, but it's been so fun being able to look up weapons and enemies, and it's really made me appreciate the world of the game that much more. You don't want to glue yourself to it, but it's more fun than doing the same thing with youtube or a wiki.  I'm not going to guarantee that you'll like the game, because taste is subjective, but I can guarantee that you'll be able to play it. If the only thing that's stopping you is difficulty, you should take the plunge. We're here to help!"

bloodborne,3e1kvw,JesusaurusRex666,4,Tue Jul 21 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"None of the Souls games, BB included, are actually ""hard."" They're ""punishing,"" which is a very different beast. ""Hard"" would be something like Ninja Gaiden, which requires a much more specific reaction time and complexity of timing and attacks. The so-called difficulty with the Souls games usually comes from not knowing your environment and not being perceptive enough to avoid traps and sneak attacks. The whole ""git gud"" thing is an exhortation to learn the attack patterns and geography.  If you die in a game like God of War, it could be because of some random bullshit happening just off screen or a randomized attack pattern being enabled at an awkward time. You die in a souls game? Then you deserved it, no exceptions."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,henry_kr,4,Tue Jul 21 08:59:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say they were ""challenging"" rather than ""punishing"". It's a subtle but important definition."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,gwaybz,3,Tue Jul 21 09:45:45 2015 UTC,"You deserved it, no exceptions   That's an exaggeration. There are bullshit deaths in souls/BB.  Maldron, some hitbox problems, maldron, red spiders killing you before you open a door and you didnt even know they existed, maldron, and quite a few other bullshitty things.  That being said, I agree that the vast majority of deaths are avoidable, and if you learn from a death, you can probably avoid it"
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Pjoernrachzarck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:52 2015 UTC,"DeS has plenty of exceptions to this rule. When I die in Bloodborne, it's because I deserved it.

bloodborne,3e1kvw,Chilli_Axe,5,Tue Jul 21 15:44:59 2015 UTC,"Do you really die every 5 seconds like people say? And do you have to be an amazing hardcore gamer to be able to play? Are the lowered difficulty levels?   Honestly Bloodborne isn't that hard. Definitely quite a bit easier than Souls, and this game is a lot more forgiving of mistakes during combat. It'll be more challenging than any other game you've played this year, but that's just how it goes I guess. We don't play these games because we're machoists  Personally, I love this game because of its amazing and precise combat, great art style and aesthetic, kick-ass soundtrack, fantastic level design and the best bosses in the Souls series. I highly recommend you pick it up. Play at least until the second area of the game - by then, you'll know for sure whether or not Bloodborne is for you. It is a niche game and might not be your cup of tea, but you could also surprise yourself and really love BB"
bloodborne,3e1kvw,VonStreff,3,Tue Jul 21 09:53:15 2015 UTC,"I don't play Dark Souls (it's too hard for my tastes), but I loved Bloodborne. I died maybe 50-60 times, in 50+ hours. It's a brilliant, brilliant game if you love fast combat, incredible music, gothic architecture, and a deep (yet vague) story. Even grinding to level up was fun. If it proves too difficult, you can level up and it's more doable. There's no shame in doing that.  I recommend it very highly."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,koolkid4006,2,Tue Jul 21 06:41:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for your advice VonStreff. Yes I must say I have been put off by the Dark Souls reputation but great to know that Bloodborne is still enjoyable. And I suppose 1 death per hour isn't bad!
bloodborne,3e1kvw,CynicScientist,7,Tue Jul 21 06:48:42 2015 UTC,"The whole dark souls is hard meme is a bit much imho, if you try and figure out what you're doing and you don't rush into every situation you can service most situations in it without dying. I tried it originally because my friend said I wouldn't best it and sure I died a bit but you just have to learn the pace of the game and go with it."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,WhiteMarauder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:58:25 2015 UTC,"True that. The Souls games isn't really that hard at all except for a few bosses that require skill and a bit of luck to kill (Ancient Dragon in DS2 was really tough at first but once you get a good strategy, the fight becomes so easy albeit still dangerous). People only need to familiarize how the game works and they'll get used to it especially if you kinda memorized majority of the game and how enemies behave as well as their patterns."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,x_stickman_x,3,Tue Jul 21 08:56:51 2015 UTC,Don't listen to that crap.  BB is harder than Dark Souls to some people and to others Darks Souls is easier.  It just depends on the person.
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Xonim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:08:43 2015 UTC,"You'll probably die a lot more than once per hour. It sometimes only takes a single slip up (bad spacing, bad timing, lack of caution, lack of well placed aggression, etc) to kill you. I'm not trying to say that it's only possible to beat as a hardcore gamer, but I don't want you to regret your purchase. The gameplay is a lot of fun, and the world is amazing. The real danger adds to the immersion of the environments. If you just understand that EVERYONE dies, then it's a lot easier to take. There are moments of frustration, but if you can get past those, I guarantee you it'll be one of your favorite games. You might consider getting a used copy; I think you can usually return those (within like a week) for the full value.   edit: The first area is designed to break you btw."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,excessivecaffeine,2,Tue Jul 21 07:07:24 2015 UTC,"edit: The first area is designed to break you btw.   So very much this.  Once you get past Central Yarnham, either the game gets easier or you've gotten better to the point where you won't die nearly as much anymore.  Obviously the bosses WILL still kill you, some lots and lots of times ... but as long as you make sure to open the shortcuts and learn from your deaths, you'll be moving on in no time.  I've never played the other souls games, and in fact, hadn't played many console games in the last 6-8 years, period.  Bloodborne is hard, but very fair.  If you die, it's your fault.  Learn from your mistakes, and you won't die next time."

bloodborne,3e1kvw,WhiteMarauder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:05 2015 UTC,When I started playing it I died a lot but after a couple hours I got the hang of it and didn't die that much anymore.
bloodborne,3e1kvw,CynicScientist,4,Tue Jul 21 15:00:25 2015 UTC,"People over exaggerate this dying thing to the extreme.  Yes the game is challenging and yes you will die quite a bit.  But the games themselves, I like to think of more as a puzzle than as combat.  You have to survey your surroundings, observe the different ways enemies will attack, and respond appropriately.  The puzzle is figuring out just how to beat a boss or pass through a certain area.  Now there's times with Bloodborne where I would die multiple times to the same boss.  And I would say the greatest experience to be had in the games would be to see a boss for the first time, have a bit of anxiety and fear build up because you don't know what they can do yet, and then learn the patterns.  The moment you beat a tough boss is one of the most satisfying you can have.  My favorite memory is of beating Ornstein and Smough in Dark Souls 1.  Because this is a boss where you had to fight two bosses at once.  It is an insanely difficult fight as well, but by the time you get to them you already know the mechanics of the game.  These two, they force you to progress in skill in a way that you had never before thought possible.  When I finally beat them I felt a mix of relief and excitement.  Later on I would come back and play the game again.  I found myself defeating them easily because of how much I developed over playing the game a lot."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Brandonmac10,2,Tue Jul 21 07:07:08 2015 UTC,My favorite memory in Dark Souls 1 was beating Sif. I really had a tough time beating that wolf but had no problems with Ornstein and Smough (defeated both in my 1st encounter).  Best memory would be in Dark Souls 2 though when I finally killed the Smelter Demon after countless deaths. I gave my screen the middle finger and was smiling as he finally died.
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Pjoernrachzarck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:04:01 2015 UTC,I thought Sif was really easy. On my first playthrough I got to the first bell and couldn't kill the two gargoyles so I decided to farm souls for the key to the woods and ended up coming across Sif. I had barely any trouble killing him even at my low level.
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Zeoderos,2,Tue Jul 21 12:43:38 2015 UTC,"Counter-example: Maneater in Demon's Souls. This boss fight is everything that people are worried about when they hear about the Souls games. This boss fight just kills you randomly for stupid reasons, and you have to be either overlevelled or overly lucky to not die. Because the maneaters are unpredictable, often out of your field of vision, and worst of all, they will just randomly push you off the tiny, tiny stage to your death. It's not about skill, it's purely patience and endurance. Or grinding until you reach a SL where you can just quickly hack them to death.   I platinumed Bloodborne, but nothing in that game infuriated my more than the maneaters in DeS. It's just a poorly designed boss fight. Thank god the way back to the fight is fairly short and fairly simple, and almost without fighting. Which isn't true for most of DeS's bosses.  Ugh."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Zeoderos,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:29 2015 UTC,"Nope. This game is as sickeningly amazing as you have heard. Even though it could be taken as pure punishment the goal of the game is to get you to overcome extreme obstacles. Its a good life lesson to keep going at something until you get through it, no matter how tough.  Trust me, set your goal to beat the game and promise not to give up until you achieve that and you will see how amazing this series truly is.  It is by far the most rewarding gameplay experience in ANY game. You will feel so proud of yourself when you are done."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,CynicScientist,2,Tue Jul 21 08:06:11 2015 UTC,Another piece of advice. Take your time. It isn't a race. Dodging/interupting is more valuable than attacking.
bloodborne,3e1kvw,GothMAXMP,2,Tue Jul 21 08:07:52 2015 UTC,"If you're looking for a gaming challenge and a rewarding experience then I highly recommend Bloodborne. You'll die a lot of times but that's the beauty of it. It doesn't punish you because the game is designed to make you suffer but rather designed to make you actually plan and execute different kinds of strategy. If you eventually get the hang of it, you'll find yourself surviving more often than dying all the time.  The combat is fast and responsive. The setting, the music and sound effects are top notch (especially those sudden loud bell chimes and screams from out of nowhere). The story is rather deep but not really presented in your face. You'll have to do a bit of reading and most of the time figuring out stuff on your own but that's what makes the game enigmatic.  And no, you don't have to be an amazing hardcore gamer to be able to play the game. You'll just have to learn how it works and plays out and eventually you'll get the hang of it. There are no lowered difficulty levels but there's practically nothing that you really can't overcome.  Last advice would be is to have patience. You're really gonna need it especially at the beginning (or throughout the entire gameplay)."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Born_HG,2,Tue Jul 21 08:51:44 2015 UTC,"the only things that BB requires to be successful are patience, practice and focus.  everything else comes naturally along with those.  you will die, you will lose all your echoes sometimes even and it will piss you off.  the game is hard because it's probably very unlike anything you've played before.  but i promise you that the game is never EVER going to throw something at you without giving you the tools you need to handle it.   i don't care how fucking garbage you are at video games, like even if you literally can only play with your ass - the tools for you to win are in the game.    they have specifically said that bloodborne (and souls games as well) is designed for people who love video games, not ""hardcore"" gamers.  so if you just take the time to learn the game's ""rules"" and remember that mistakes are necessary for progress, you will do fine.  dying is not losing, as long as you walk away smarter, even if it's something as simple as, ""oh i guess i can fall off that shit"" or ""wow i didn't know they could do that"".  the game relies on letting players create advantages through knowledge rather than just overpowering things like many traditional ARPGs, although you can definitely trivialize the content by leveling up and grinding gems.  i'd say if you are interested at all and have the time to invest it is worth picking up.  just an incredible game with a ridiculous amount of depth, if you're anything like me you will be totally addicted lol"

bloodborne,3e1kvw,dearscrewtape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:52:03 2015 UTC,"dying in souls games is just a minor stumble.  it's not a big deal.  they are all definitely challenging games, but not stupid hard or unfair.  usually if you die a lot it means you are approaching something the wrong way.  they are not crazy mechanically hard or anything like that.  one thing that wasn't mentioned is the multiplayer -- it's amazing and unique to play co-op and experience PvP.  if you want you can basically co-op all the areas in the game, which makes it a lot easier.  definitely give it a go, the atmosphere and the mechanics of souls games are worth experiencing."

As background, I played Dark Souls 1 and 2 before Bloodborne, but didn't fall in love with either.  Bloodborne on the other hand, owns my soul.  I literally can't play enough of it and stopped playing all other console games since shortly after it came out.  Bloodborne is as hard as you make it.  If you keep trying a failed strategy or tactic, you will weep bitter salty tears.  If you keep an open mind and learn - and know when to turn off the game (or just go do something else somewhere else) to avoid getting overly frustrated with anything - you will progress well and quickly.  Probably the most painful mechanic to get used to at first is (potentially) losing your blood echoes if you die again without getting the first set back.  The thing is, this is really no big deal.  Echoes are just currency, and the thing is there's a literally infinite supply of it.  If you need some more, you can go to any area where you're more powerful than the enemies and just beat them down for a few runs.  Doing this will also introduce you to one of the most important parts of any Souls game:  learning each area like the back of your hand.  Knowledge of where enemies appear (and how they move around), where traps and ambushes are, and where safe spots are is ALWAYS rewarded in Souls games.  This will be equally true in the Chalice Dungeons, which you'll start visiting fairly early in the story if you wish.  The short answer is yes, you should buy it.  I'm glad it sounds like you chose to do so.  Be forewarned:  once you've played a Souls game, THERE IS NO GOING BACK.  Forevermore, all other ARPGs will pale in comparison, and many action games will lose their lustre as well.  Souls is the platinum standard for both.  Once you've tasted that cup, all other flavors are horse piss and old dishwater.  Don't believe me.  Try it yourself."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Haimah22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:20 2015 UTC,"Hey, so: I'd never played a Souls game before, and I'm LOVING Bloodborne. I play four or five video games a year, so I'm definitely not what you'd call a hardcore gamer, though I have been doing it for a long time. It's a lot of fun, and it requires you to develop skill, like playing the piano, so it's a bit different from, say, the Uncharted games (which are great!) in that those are more interested in telling you a story and providing a thrill rather than providing a challenge.  The dying is interesting; it's part of the instructional process, which is why people enjoy it - it's less that the game is being punitive and more that the boss fights and enemies are designed to teach you how to do different things: to parry attacks using the gun, to roll in the right direction, to use items in the right way at the right time, etc. It's VERY satisfying.  I like the combat a lot but what I really love is the design: it's just one of the most beautiful games I've ever played and there are all kinds of secret passages and hidden doors and scary traps to find. The monster design is amazing, too - everything in it is kind of beautiful, sometimes in a really weird, disturbing, freakish way. So I say go for it!  Also, when you get to Father Gascoigne, roll FORWARD in his third phase, not away. Good grief, it took me forever to learn that"
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Shaved_Almonds,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:13:08 2015 UTC,The dying is very front loaded as you're going through the learning curve. When I played at first I died a TON and felt like I was making no progress whatsoever. However my biggest recommendation would be to go into the game totally blind and don't read any guides. Just keep playing and learning through the game world and experimentation. Although the game feels like punishment at first it becomes so extremely rewarding. This game is on my list of favorite games of all time. There is absolutely nothing like it (other than maybe the DS series).  edit: I highly recommend you watch this clip as I think this is probably what most of us went through when starting the game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIFc0npoms8
bloodborne,3e1kvw,excessivecaffeine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:17:14 2015 UTC,Its one of the hardest most satisfying games that doeant babysit you or hold your hand and you feel like a beast when you finally start to be awesome.
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Kattpuzn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:03 2015 UTC,"Having enjoyed DS1, I must say that I don't quite know the feeling of BB being one's first souls game. However I must say that the lore and universe has recently enthralled me a little bit more than that of DS1. So first, once you do beat the game, I'd highly recommend watching some videos that describe what the fuck you just went through. Gameplay wise, it ain't easy. I got the game at launch, and due to a hiatus of not playing (I got stuck and distracted with other games) I only recently came back and finished it. But I must say that, in terms of boss difficulty, everything seems much harder than it actually is. I've had a good bit of frustration with bosses like ""oh you're just gonna go and do that yeah that's not over powered!"" huff huff twitch But really - as Yahtzee put it - the glory is in banging your head against a wall til the wall finally gives. You just have to find what attack pattern can counter each boss, and get a good run in to punish it. I'd also like to say that, in terms of areas and enemies, it gets progressively more fun the further through the game you get. The first few areas for me - specifically Old Yarhnam - were annoying and terrifying, but later on, though it doesn't get any easier, exploring an area feels easier, at least for me, I guess cause everything gets weird and I wanted to know what was going on. Final note: There is ALWAYS a shortcut you can open to make a trip to a boss arena easier."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Kattpuzn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:10:23 2015 UTC,"No lowered difficulty levels.   Yes, the game is hard, but you learn how to cope.  Also, it's relatively easy to accidentally over-level yourself by farming a few areas for a long time (which I did)."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,wessaaah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:06 2015 UTC,"Deep, hard to obtain lore Eeringly creepy and scary, without the cheesy jump scares (there are some of those too, but they werent what I meant) Difficult regular mobs Difficult bosses - but not difficult just to make it hard for you, its a challenge, and you get a real sense of accomplishment from achieving new goals Awesome graphics (my personal opinion) Sound design & music is top notch."

bloodborne,3e1kvw,HexOnLex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"The game is fair. It's easy if you know what to expect and when to expect it(and have the appropriate gear and knowledge of how to beat an area), and it's hard if you expect things to die as quickly as in Diablo III or Dynasty Warriors.  If you get the game, my advice would be to stick with it through the first ""wall"" - which is what I call the first hump of the learning curve.  I even had that wall coming from the Souls games - Bloodborne is very similar, but it does not reward passive play - attack, but attack cautiously.  Once you break through the first wall, things start gaining momentum. There will be days where you kill three bosses. There will be weeks where you kill none.  Stick with it - the Souls/BB games are some of the most rewarding of the past decade. They don't hold your hand, and they don't give you the ""Luigi Ghost Of Showing You How To Do This"".  Best of luck!"
bloodborne,3e1kvw,aud_nih,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:59:15 2015 UTC,"Do you really die every 5 seconds like people say?   Nope, once I made it a full 10 seconds before dying!  Seriously though, the begining of the game is rough, probably one of the hardest times I've had with a game ever.  Once you figure it out it becomes...I'm not going to say easier per se, but definitly more managable.     And do you have to be an amazing hardcore gamer to be able to play?    I wouldn't consider myself an ""amazing hardcore gamer,"" I generally play single player action/adventure games on normal difficulty, but this game will force you to be better because you have to be, you can't just die and pop up in the same place at full health/power.  Are the lowered difficulty levels?  Nope."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Sootraggins,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"I might be what people refer to as a 'casual'? I don't know; the number of games I've played isn't high. I research games that look like my cup of tea and I run them into the ground for months, rinse, repeat. BB is my first Souls game. At first, I would have recommended it to NO ONE. It is the hardest game I've encountered, hands down. The game and combat mechanics are the most intricate I've ever seen and I believe it has made me a better gamer all around.  So yeah, I ragequit a couple times initially, because of all the dying, but I am fucking stubborn and couldn't let it go, so I always came back after no more than a few hours. :P It has its hooks in now. The depth and breadth of this world and the lore and just everything is AMAZING. I recently learned about the NG+, etc., and how it's pretty much de rigueur to do multiple playthroughs?? I'm going to be playing this FOR-EV-ER."
bloodborne,3e1kvw,SouthParrot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:47:35 2015 UTC,The first 5 hours of the game will be extremely punishing and the hardest to get through.  Once you're over that initial rough start everything will start clicking.  I can't recommend this game enough.  It's the best console gaming experience I've ever had.
bloodborne,3e1kvw,Brandonmac10,0,Tue Jul 21 18:23:02 2015 UTC,"Bloodborne has the steepest learning curve of any Souls game, but it's way more linear (even though I completely missed a path that leads to a separate optional area). You'll die a bunch, but in Bloodborne there's less of the dread feeling. Leveling up isn't as important, so making it as far as you can really relies on your skill level. The ""aha!"" realization moments in the Souls games can't be beat, and when you accomplish something you feel like you've earned it. The combat is more forgiving in this game, but it also can't be cheated around like in the previous ones, so it's more balanced while still being a hurdle.   People throw a bunch of criticism at these games for being too hard, but the best way to describe them is by saying they're very reminiscent of old arcade games. You learn patterns and when to risk it, and if you mess up you're either dead or probably halfway dead. But it's exhilarating because these games treat you like an adult, and the grind isn't repetive crap (unless you want to replay the game multiple times), the grid is you working on what you know and how to use it."

bloodborne,3e30hg,Peopleschamp305,3,Tue Jul 21 16:14:15 2015 UTC,I reckon Arcane is the hardest to pull off since you'll be weaker early on until you get your hunter tools and until you can make a proper arcane weapon. Other than that theres the challenge of beating the game on level 4.

You would need to sacrifice blood for spells so the closest thing is sacrificing life for bullets which allow you to cast spells.

Do you like the Reiter and Rifle Spear for sake of having constant no-swap access to a flamer-type LH weapon?  If yes, which do you rock - Flamesprayer or Rosemarinus?  I'm guessing the former."
bloodborne,3e2nnf,Dreaming_Sky,3,Tue Jul 21 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"The Threaded Cane would be my personal preference, especially since this is a SKL-ish build. That or the Almighty Saw Spear. Unfortunately my stupid ass thought it would e a good idea to go through the entire game using only non-serrated weaponry.  Nope; it wasn't.  EDIT: I actually don't use either of those on this build. Frankly, I've always found them both to be terribly, terribly underwhelming. My arcane build can dump out more melee damage in the one and a half seconds most bosses will stand still than the Rosmarinus could in twenty. And that's with 50 points into ARC."
bloodborne,3e2nnf,EelsInTheVinegar,0,Tue Jul 21 20:39:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, dude.  Ohhhoohoho dude.  I don't know if they've patched this yet (probably), but if you ever want to see some serious boss-toasting fun, revert your app to 1.0 (or whatever the starting version was) and try Bone Marrow Ash with a Sprayer or Rose.  It breaks the game.  It breaks. The fucking. Game.  The BMA's buff is supposed to apply to the next shot you fire, i.e., one bullet (or 2 or 12 if you happen to be using those guns).  Sprayer-type weapons don't have a set shot-cost per trigger pull, so you can just hold the trigger and LOL.  The damage with even as meager as a +5 or +6 Flamesprayer with BMA, on NG Amelia, is gobstopping.  Yeah, she might swizzle away from it, but you'll still lop off substantial chunks of her health bar with just a few scrapes.  Actually there are vids of people doing Flamesprayer-only boss runs... forgive me that I don't link to any.  But yeah, you'd find 'em if you looked.  Really you'd be fine with a Cane though.  There's a reason #canemasterrace used to be an actual thing."

The way he looks, moves, jumps, stalks, the whole aesthetic, makes him into something special. My 11-yo granddaughter watched me fight Paarl the other night, and she got really upset - ""He is so pretty!  Why are you trying to hurt him?"""
bloodborne,3e2nnf,Dreaming_Sky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:57 2015 UTC,"No, even when I'm well past the rage I hate the fuck out of that boss. He's neat looking but that comes at an unacceptable cost to the frame rate. (Developers: if you program a boss that drops your frame rate below a locked 30, you've fucked your game up. Optimize better or change the boss entirely.) His mechanics are interesting, except that you cannot accurately target the parts you need to hit. Unless you're using the transformed Hunter's Axe's L2s each swing is at best a dice roll. This is completely incompetent on From's part.  Having to fight him unlocked is a tremendous nuisance but I can live with it; however, when his mobility allows him to fly across the screen and start throwing lightning from off-camera before I can see him again, something is horribly wrong.  Paarl can get away with this shit because his health pool and damage are considerably lower than Loran Darkbeast's. The latter is unacceptable in his current form once you consider that he can easily deal 5/6th of a 50 VIT character's maximum health in a single hit, and he can use hard knockdowns and stand over you, swinging while you get back up. And let's not even talk about how nigh-impossible to dodge his leaping attack is. Jesus Christ!  TL;DR: Boss design is, in theory, 7.5-to-8/10. In reality, 2/63."

Now that I know to use a weapon with a broad horizontal attack (R1 threaded cane, transformed, maybe even R1 transformed saw spear), he is spectacularly fun to fight.  A big health bar helps too :)  For some reason, the frame rate problem isn't an issue for me with this boss.  Much more noticeable with other bosses, mainly Eb and BLB."

Madman's knowledge can be consumed from the item menu to instantly gain 1 insight. Bloodstones are used to permanently upgrade a weapon's damage and unlock gem slots.

bloodborne,3e16kh,GothMAXMP,3,Tue Jul 21 04:06:36 2015 UTC,"As i see it, the cosmos, is where the great ones are and is where they're from. Us humans want insight, we want to ascend to the Cosmos to become great ones or at least one with the great ones. I believe that from this cosmos Ebrietas was born which is why her name is ""Daughter of Cosmos"" and not ""Daughter of Yharnam"".    She was summoned by the healing church somehow and it was of her own will that she decided to coexist with humans, she was one of the reasons the church got inspired to go into the dungeons due to her providing the choir with cosmic knowledge and intel on the labyrinths.    It is also believed that the upper cathedral ward was locked away to hide Ebrietas from the townsfolk of Yharnam to protect her since they'd without a doubt see her as a monster and not a friendly being. This makes quite good sense due to the lack of stairs or anything up there beside a breakable window.    By the way i was thinking too about something... The blue aliens are believed to have been human if i'm not mistaken, people from the orphanage. Two of these guards the elevator to Ebrietas. Why on earth did they Healing church station two people to guard something which was only available through breaking a window?! They'd have to break and repair the damn window everytime they needed to commune with Ebrietas or feed the guards or just anything! I maybe just be overthinking stuff but someone fucked up the architecture on this one!    NB: It's early in the morning, i havn't slept yet, if some of the wording is terrible, now you know why."
bloodborne,3e16kh,OOpiumBear,5,Tue Jul 21 04:47:19 2015 UTC,"i don't think she would be called ""daughter of yharnam"" either way - yharnam was just a vessel to bring great ones into the world, to the great ones themselves, at least.  surely there were others, and others have attempted it since (annalise comes to mind, as does fake iosefka).  that's pure speculation tho.  and ebrietas was found inside the chalice dungeons actually.  i think it's pretty obvious from the state of the altar of despair, combined with the fact that she has likely been split in half and experimented on, that she is far from a willing participant.  i read her non-hostility as complete resignation, like an animal that has been caged and abused for so long that it has largely lost the will to fight.  in that state, she is both useless and dangerous, so just locking her away, and the secrets of the orphanage with her, was the easiest solution for the choir i'm sure.  so while i'm sure it was absolutely in their interest to keep her hidden from the common people, i think that her lack of willingness to ""cooperate"" with the choir is what ultimately led them to sealing her away so completely like they did.  after all, with the celestial emissaries created, they now had the chance to make contact with other great ones, in hopes of finding some that were more sympathetic to their cause.    also, and i think this is the most concrete evidence i have - if ebrietas had been named ""daughter of oeden"" instead, i feel like it would have been too obvious what the true lore implications are.  by examining the name ""daughter of oeden"" using patented reverse wheel of fortune analysis we find this message:  ""daughter of oeden""  ""d-ug---- o- --d--""  to a PC casual who is too poor for PS4 that probably seems like gibberish but any true lore junkie is beginning to see the picture - re-reverse the wheel, remove the 8th stat and the answer is clear:   ""du dog""    plain as day ladies.  there's more to the theory, of course, but i don't wanna get ripped off by some big money youtuber."

Ebrietas herself has no feet, but she's clearly something traumatizing has happened! Though it could also be: da-g---- -- -eden which means ""when the goat"" now theres no goats in the game OR!!! did we just find out that Vicar amelia is a goat dressed up as a poodle? And that she shoved her foot far up ebrietas' ass to make her docile which in turn led the church to give her a big thumbs up by chanting ""Du god""?  ¨ I feel like this could be a cutscene that we aren't shown in the game, though i would love to see it.

bloodborne,3e16kh,Hell_Tutor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:54:25 2015 UTC,"Could also be ""God, u D!""  Anyway, I like the idea Queen And Ebbrietas may be related somehow. She could in fact have been birthed by QY or... someone else.  She resembles those weird feetus very much. You can see one born out of the prostitute at Cathedral Ward. If we assume Oedon is the daddy, then maybe Oedon is the father of Ebrietas.  Queen yharnam would bee the only lady we know to have been long enough to birth one of those things but again, someone else might have given birth to the thing.  You know that terrified baby living on the same street as the prostitute and the old man? At one point she is shrieking ""my baby!""   Maybe her baby is one of those tiny ebrietas as well.  Maybe Oedon impregnates all the ladies in the hopes of get at least one baby that's more like Oedon itself.  Perhaps Ebrietas was a success for the choir but a failure for Oedon which is formless. If so Mergo may be the first and only success since Mergo is like Oedon: formless."

As for the Altar of Despair, yeah, got me there, I haven't been there in quite some time so I completely forgot about the corpse.  Still, I remain agnostic unconvinced. Because I suck."
bloodborne,3e16kh,BorneByTheBlood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:17:16 2015 UTC,"Yes you do suck. Brains that is. Stop stealing insight! Lol.    Well if I may try to convince you even more; •Ebrietas was found inside of a chalice dungeon, she could not be a great ones child as all great ones lose their child. With this it seems almost irrefutable the Ebrietas was one of the sympathetic great ones, see Caryll rune moon, and if the ""Sky and Cosmos are one"" then that means it is merely perception. For example, we are all in the sky, as there is little difference between the sky and where our feet our planted, if the same is true for the sky being one with the Cosmos then that means the Cosmos is merely a different dimension(see Hunters Dream), existential plane(see Mensis), or hidden by obscure rites(see Yahar'gul). •Speculation, if you look into the Garden where the Celestial Emissary is fought you will notice how the smaller ones are born from the ground, as if grown, given we know the CEs are without doubt former humans we can only imagine that the Garden was used to harvest blood from the Orphanage to continue Yharnam's blood ministration. It's weird how they stayed in the Garden, right outside of the entrance to Ebrietas, as if trying the prevent anyone from ever continuing what was being done to them and other children. •Enemy design, correct me if I'm wrong, Ebrietas and Rom, who are undoubtedly connected, are the only enemies in the game that don't attack you unprovoked. Looking into Ebrietas's face you will notice something weird, two real eyes and even more eyes inside of the face, as though to suggest either someone put eyes inside of her or that this inspired the idea of lining your head with eyes, paired with how eyes are often mixed with insight, the fight with Rom, who was granted eyes (insight), makes more sense. •Dream Vs Reality, many areas existence inside of a dream and only inside of a dream. See Mensis, Nightmare Frontier, and now to my belief Rom. If the body which eerily stinks of Rom is in fact Rom then that would mean the fight is the same as Micolash, alive only through the dream, given his body is mummified in the real world. Unlike Micolash though, Ebrietas has the knowledge of time on her side, thus she was praying her creation, or child, would come back alive from its Dream. If Rom entered the dream until it evolved, could handle the knowledge it was bestowed, or it could leave on its own then it would need a body to return too that isn't mummified and rotten, when it was created Eb transferred Roms consciousness to the dream, if noted how the body seems to be an incompleted Rom it makes sense that noticing Rom was being destroyed by the inhuman knowledge would make Ebrietas try to save her. •The eye run ""A transcription of ""Eye,"" as spoken by left-behind Great Ones. Allows one to make additional discoveries."" With this and the later description ""Willem looked to beings from higher planes for guidance, and sought to line his brain with eyes"" would indicate that Willem didn't originally conceive of this plan himself before seeking contact with a left behind Great One, Ebrietas, but only after seeing how Ebrietas was lined with eyes could he have discovered the connection leading to this goal. If this is the case Micolash, who knows Willem without question and thus would know of Rom, seeking eyes would wish to be gifted the same way Rom was, from the only left behind Great One that has ever been shown as friendly. •Coincidence or Intentional, Clockwise/Anti runes. In the clockwise rune metamorphosis is lower case, indicating it as a mere concept when it was created. On the anti clockwise rune Metamorphosis is capitalized, as though to refer to another person. If this isn't merely an oversight repeat 3 times from copying and pasting then we can infer is that Anti-Clockwise was discovered in the process of reversing Roms metamorphosis. •Augur of Ebrietas ""The initial encounter marked the start of an inquiry into the cosmos from within the old labyrinth, and led to the establishment of the Choir"", the Choir undoubtedly being responsible for Iosefka, the Orphanage, and Celestials were formed from the interaction with Ebrietas, after discovering the Augur.

bloodborne,3e2j1c,Kuriin,2,Tue Jul 21 13:58:40 2015 UTC,"This! Just very very much this! Forcing people to get downscaled to his level, not being able to do it himself and then calling them bad... I'm amazed. They aren't bad, he just took away all their damage due to his low level. Also.. why the H only +2 weapons?.. At the point of cainhurst you could get it to 7+ without farming enemies, just looting corpses.."
bloodborne,3e2j1c,OOpiumBear,2,Tue Jul 21 15:08:46 2015 UTC,Parry him and when he starts to do his spellcast bullshit backstab him. It might take a few times for you to get the rhythm down but it can be done. If your visceral damage is low do you have access to any Clawmark runes?
bloodborne,3e2j1c,CasulPants,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:54:20 2015 UTC,"Highly doubt that (the clawmarks, that is) I'm helping someone with the Defiled Chalice RN but if you still need a hand later I'm down. We also have /r/huntersbell for this sorta thing."
bloodborne,3e2j1c,Volenska,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:03:21 2015 UTC,"Parry him . . .   Yeah, because that actually works. 95% of the time I try to parry Logarius I either (a) fail or (b) successfully parry a scythe swing that still hits me anyway, conveniently knocking me too far away to roll in for the visceral.  Logarius can guzzle chum for all I care."
bloodborne,3e2j1c,Erotic_Walrus,2,Tue Jul 21 14:25:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry friendo, it does actually work. Logarius ate my lunch until I decided I was going to parry him to death. Then he was easy. In that respect he is a lot like Gwynn. Like I said it takes a few tries to get his rhythm but once you do he is barely a threat anymore.    Once you parry him a few times and he decides ""well I had better go into phase 2 now"" you can chain backstab him too. I did the exact same thing on a bloodtinge build like OP and I was surprised at how easy it was.    Give it a try, once you get his timing down he ceases being a threat. The run back to him is easy too. Run passed all the ghost chicks, kill the first blow gun asshole and that is it. Oh, and use the pistol on him too. I don't even know why the rifles exist, the pistol seems to be superior in almost every situation."
bloodborne,3e2j1c,CasulPants,0,Tue Jul 21 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"I parried Gwyn to death by my second try. It's such an easy strategy that doing anything else is laughable by comparison. Martyr Logarius's parry windows are complete and total bullshit, and even when watching carefully for the right moment I am lucky if I land 1 out of 10 tries. And as I stated earlier, at least half the time I ""get"" the parry he's already knocked me down and the game robs me of my hard-earned visceral.  Logarius is complete and total goat-blowing bullshit."
bloodborne,3e2j1c,Erotic_Walrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:16:55 2015 UTC,He is total bullshit but parrying him makes the fight way easier. I just killed him a few weeks ago on my bl 4 run and I couldn't have done it without parrying him.

Stats and AR never get touched by the natural co-op process until you set a pw and i guess are 1 lvl passed whatever range. For instance i can join lvl 38's with my lvl 71 but i helped a guy who was lvl 37 and was just barely nerfed a few %."

According to what you say, it just reduces your chances of having a cooperator for the bossfight  Through snatchers (assuming you killed bsb) and wandering nightmares, I think should have enough shards to up 2 weps to at least +3 by that point. Evelynn's shards could be looted later no?"
bloodborne,3e2j1c,gwaybz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:02 2015 UTC,"+2 is laughable get atleast +5-7 and if your good enough... Should be okay  If you still need help ill kill him for you later  Theres atleast 30 twin shards in FW and 6 chunks at cainhurst thats enough for a plus 7 before SOY.

With option to do some damage should the player want to.  But if guns did enough damage people might focus on using their guns which is potentially game breaking I think. Imgine something to the effect of the Arcane rifle spear. Am I making sense?"
bloodborne,3e1eeh,MegiddoZO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:05:52 2015 UTC,"yeah I get you :) obviously they were intended for parrying (which is why they do no damage unless if you put a lot of points and levels for the gun)  it's actually kind of a problem already in pvp, especially with bone marrow. for pve I personally can kite a LOT of bosses, beating them with just blood bullets and 10 bone marrow ashes."

He really likes minimalism in his storytelling, and has said many times that he tells stories in a way that leaves things up to not only the player's imagination, but his own as well.

I really don't think it would be possible to write a novel that wasn't far too explicit for what makes the stories of these games special in the first place."

But I've never thought to associate the Old Yharnam beasts as having remembered the burning, just that they were afraid of fire because they were well, beasts. But that wouldn't explain why the scourge beasts don't fear the flame though. Maybe it's because they are too far transformed? But I'm just going off on a limb here."
bloodborne,3dz2gn,gwaybz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"I think its safe to say that scourge beasts lost more(or rather all) of their ""humanity"", and thus are further transformed.  The way I see it, villagers remain somewhat human, with morals and passions/emotions, even though twisted and mad. They have fur, but remain very human like in appearance. They can also speak coherently (ish)  Patients in old yharnam are somewhat more ""beastly"". They don't speak and are pretty wild, they act only on instinct, and that's probably why they are scared of fire, they remember that Old Yharnam burned down.  Scourge beasts are completely beasts, no more human at all. They lost anything that was human, whether it be in looks or ""mentality"".

bloodborne,3e1lb9,PsychedelicHubcap,2,Tue Jul 21 06:43:15 2015 UTC,Yes the singles drop fairly often and later in the game you can purchase them at the birdbath

bloodborne,3e1lb9,x_stickman_x,2,Tue Jul 21 06:46:59 2015 UTC,Be liberal with Blood stone shards and twin bloodstone shards. Be a bit conservative with blood stone chunks and the pure blood stone. You'll definitely want a +9 or +10 melee weapon before you beat the game.
bloodborne,3e1lb9,Steel_cookie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:49:02 2015 UTC,Should I upgrade an early game weapon like the Saw Spear?
bloodborne,3e1lb9,x_stickman_x,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:50:09 2015 UTC,"All weapons are viable for end game PvE, there are no ""early game"" weapons in the sense they fall off. Just in that you get them early in The game. I used the saw spear pretty much for my entire first playthrough. Even put it up to +10"
bloodborne,3e1lb9,Erotic_Walrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:53:46 2015 UTC,If you enjoy the moveset go for it. I advise using some beast pellets in combination with transformation attacks. If you get a few good hits in you'll be doing almost 2x damage in no time.
bloodborne,3e1lb9,Howler452,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:52 2015 UTC,"The Saw Spear remains a phenomenal anti-beast weapon throughout the entire game due to its solid move set and constant +20% bonus damage against beast-type enemies. Add to this that it apparently gets a further damage bonus from using L1 transformations mid-combo and it's easily among the most versatile powerhouses in the game. Its transformed version also has a marvelous range and offers high thrusting damage, meaning it absolutely brutalizes enemies like Brainsuckers. (This thing is utterly devastating on arcane builds when infused with high-tier fire gems.)  Saw Spear is life itself, and I cannot imagine anyone ever regretting taking that thing to +10 unless they really, really, really suck at the game and cannot get a handle on its basest mechanics."
bloodborne,3e1lb9,Raven_257,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yes they are. If you want to make the game easier, definitely upgrade your starter weapons at least to +3. Don't upgrade it farther unless you want to use it throughout the entire game (which is entirely viable), and save the twin blood stone shards for weapons you want to use throughout the whole game.   And yes, the blood stone shards are very common drops. A good place to farm them is in old Yharnam at the bottom in the streets."
bloodborne,3e1lb9,Erotic_Walrus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:50:19 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about Bloodborne is that it doesn't give you a Super Saw Cleaver one hour in and an Ultra Saw Cleaver near the end. There's less weapons than a typical action RPG, but that's because they're all unique. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses, and any weapon can be effective if used properly. If something is really working for you, don't be afraid to upgrade it."
bloodborne,3e1lb9,Bobryk,2,Tue Jul 21 09:28:03 2015 UTC,"And yet, despite that this is an obvious improvement over the previous Souls games' weapon distributions, I cannot help but miss my Crescent Falchion from 4-1 and Astora's Straight Sword—accessible almost the second you get access to the Firelink Shrine (with the Master Key) in Dark Souls."
bloodborne,3e1lb9,smthomasmit,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:01:21 2015 UTC,"Yep, getting +3 at the beginning will help a lot. Blood shards are pretty frequent. The beast before the Old Yharnam lamp drops a shard every time you kill him, so you can kill, bold hunters mark, kill again, repeat."

bloodborne,3e08i6,ZeNozzle,2,Mon Jul 20 23:44:37 2015 UTC,It's not lack of detail. It just isn't essential to the story. For all we know the outside world might just be a completely normal Victorian-era world.  There is just no reason to draw attention away from Yharnam when there is nothing there to see.

bloodborne,3e08i6,TrippyTheO,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:10:32 2015 UTC,"True, but Yharnam is supposed to feel more claustrophobic I think. While Dark Souls is trying to create something that is unsettling for being too big and empty, I think Bloodborne is supposed to feel small and cramped. You can see this in how the environment themselves are sparsely populated but open (even when they're linear) to crowded cramped streets and tangled, overlapping paths.  The fact that the only known outside element are eternal beings who consider humanity to be, at most, pitiable. only serves to make it go from ""sealed in a coffin"" to ""sealed in a coffin in space and space is full of alien gods""  I will admit I am curious if the rest of the world is as weird as Yharnam though, but I understand why they don't go into it at all.  EDIT: One point, Im not saying there's no cramped environments in DS (lower undead burg in particular) but they are given much less prominence than the more open-aired environments."
bloodborne,3e1bxt,JesusaurusRex666,2,Tue Jul 21 04:58:57 2015 UTC,"Some slots are better for things than others. Radials are the best physical gems, and this means that most builds will opt for weapons with 2 radial slots. You mention the chikage, the lost version (the one with 2 radials and a circle) is the best. The 2 radials can be filled with 27.2% physical gems farmed from the watchers in Ihyll, and the circle can be filled with a 31.5% tinge gem farmed from a fetid shotgun watcher guarding a lever in Ihyll. Both of the gems affect the transformed versions damage, but you'll find your viscerals to be a bit weaker. You could use the normal version and get another 27.2% if this is a problem. Waning gems have some stuff they're best at as well, they have something like +23 rapid poison gems and some +10%fire damage +65 fire damage. They should have some pretty nice bolt as well. I think that the triangle gems brainsucker drops are pretty good as well, +10% arcane +70 flat arcane. I find myself just +9/10 ing more weapons based on what I need the gems to be."

Also, gascoigne is an old name, its not like BB somehow created it. Though the use of Farmer before it makes the coincidence more plausible.  Besiege was also available on steam( even though still early access)  a while before BB was released, so unless its a new level that was created very recently, I don't think its a reference.  Would be funny if that was the case though.   Edit: I now think it really is a reference, and not a mere coincidence. That's pretty cool, seems like devs really are fans of the series"

In this sense, it is also very early in the game.   By now you probably killed Vicar Amelia, a cleric (or rather a Vicar, which I think means a representative of a higher ranked cleric or something) of the healing church.  The big white faced guys walking around with staves in Cathedral ward are also part of the church.  The healing church is pretty much everywhere in Yharnam. It is kind of the center of everything"

Seek paleblood to transcend the hunt    To escape this dreadful Hunter's Dream, halt the source of the spreading scourge of beasts, lest the night carry on forever.    You seem to be stuck inside a dream, everytime you die you are forced to relive the dream, you have been contracted by the bloodminister from the opening cutscene to do something which your hunter as of now, have no idea what is. You ventured to yharnam for the blood to become stronger but (and i believe this was not the hunters intend) got stuck within the dream as a tool to end it. Like a sort of deal with the devil, you get what you wanted but there was a catch.    I'd advise you to talk to the old man in the wheel chair after each boss kill and read every damn note (not left by other players but in-game notes) to gain more insight (HAH!) on lore and purpose.

A Holy Chalice will reveal the tomb of the gods, ...where hunters partake in communion..."" ""Most of the Holy Chalices lie deep within the tomb of the gods. And the few that found their way to the surface... Were lost again in the hands of men. But if the old hunter tales remain true... ...one of the Holy Chalices is worshipped in the valley hamlet. Yet the town is in disarray... It was burned and abandoned, for fear of the scourge, home now only to beasts. The perfect place for a hunter, wouldn't you say?""    When you defeats BSB: ""The Healing Church, and the Blood Ministers who belong to it...were once guardians of the hunters, in the times of the hunter...Ludwig. They worked, and forged weapons, in their unique workshop. Today, most ministers don't recall the hunters. And so, heed the message of your forebears. Ascend to Oedon Chapel.""

In Dark Souls 2, it's to claim the souls of four ancient beings (I believe; I haven't played Dark Souls 2). In Bloodborne, it's not immediately clear.  You are a foreigner who has come to the renowned city of Yharnam, where blood cures all. The blood in Yharnam heals all and is said to be more intoxicating than alcohol. You wake up after a blood ministration, and immediately upon dying you awake in the Hunter's Dream. You choose a weapon, and if you speak to Gehrman he will give you your first instructions; hunt beasts, as hunters should.  This was my driving force; pave through Yharnam killing beasts as a hunter. If you spend a little more time exploring in Iosefka's Clinic at the very beginning, you'll find a note with a more specific goal; ""Seek Paleblood to transcend the hunt""  Still cryptic as fuck, but it's something."

bloodborne,3dy6j2,Im_Heartless,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:54:45 2015 UTC,"I believe your character was somehow sick and sought Yharnam because of the rumors that the blood cures all ailments. In order to receive the treatment, you have to sign a contract. I think this contract was specifically tailored for you because the doctor was seeking someone who was a Paleblood. WHAT a Paleblood is, I'm not sure, but I assume it makes you an ill person without the old blood and something greater with the old blood.  Anyways, this contract is a deal with Gherman. Now that you've been cured, the least you can do is participate in the hunt. But as you travel deep and deeper into Yharnam you begin to discover something else. At this point in the game the story revolves more around personal discovery, you've unearthed something and you must know what it is. And then you play into the hands of something larger than yourself.  (btw, its my personal theory that ""Look! A Paleblood Sky!"" isn't refrencing the color of the sky but a sky that was brought upon by the actions of the Paleblood, I'm also convinced that the hunters before you bore the same condition but your the only one who got closer to the truth)"

I loved demons and Dark souls, but didn't really like Dark Souls 2 much - and I think that dislike stemmed from the similarly vague plot.  Demon's and Dark 1 gave you a definite aim with a tangible outcome - but through the lore you discover the implications of the outcome(s). Dark Souls 2 was so vague with its plot (and expected you to create the entire thing from lore), that I felt very apathetic towards it.   Bloodborne felt very similar to begin with, but it's mysteries overcame my apathy by the time I reached Bygenwyrth, and it has become my favourite of the four stories. I found though that I only really started to enjoy it once I finished my first playthrough and began reading other people's analyses(sp?) and comparing with my own.  TL;DR - stick with it, piecing it all together with the community gives you a great deal of retroactive enjoyment"

bloodborne,3e08py,OOpiumBear,3,Tue Jul 21 04:16:30 2015 UTC,"Explanation on bloodtinge: It gives blood attacks more damage (Bullets and transformed chikage and the gun part of riflespear and reiterpallasch)    Explanation on beast pellets: As the meter goes up you deal 20/40/60% extra damage to enemies but also take 20/40/60% extra damage from enemies.    Learn to riposte: Keep and eye out for enemy attacks, get them seared into your mind so you know when where and what they'll do. Just before the attack hits or finished you'll want to shoot, this will make them enter visceral state and you'll hear a metallic ""Clinggg"" noice, when this happens you want to get up close and press R1 to initiate your finishing move. While doing this move you'll be invincible.    Buildwise i suggest these: Skill/Bloodtinge - Bloodtinge gives your pistol loads of damage and skill increases visceral attack damage so these two sync well together for both PvP and PvE. You'll have quite a broad array of weapons to choose from but i'd suggest the cane as starter weapons and then the reiterpallasch/riflespear/chikage later on since they scale with both skill and bloodtinge. For gun you should pick Evelyn. Stay away from the cannon its more or less useless its AR per bullet is ridiculously low. or Arcane - Albeit a little harder to pull off this is one of the funnier builds since you'll get to play with all the magical hunter tools and make them deal a lot of damage. Ludwigs holy blade turned into elemental is great for this build.    I left out STR build since you've already tried that.  Gems: You'll want to complete most of the chalices to get to the deepest depth 5 chalices. Here you'll be able to find the very best of gems to your weapons. Theres a spreadsheet on where to find which gems here with corresponding chalice glyphs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9enxffA3dyKGu6IVg-P4IVgmKSUYSP9UOOiThHmPIU/edit#gid=0    For PvP characters: You'll want to preplan your entire build before you start since you want to end at level 100 or 120 which is the basic PvP levels (Although PvP can be done at more or less any level). Getting to farm the gems will be hard at such a low level but you will be quote ""insanely OP"" when you invade people who haven't gotten the same gems.

bloodborne,3dyhm6,Vlankton,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:36 2015 UTC,Yes it changes the scaling from physical (Skill/str) into elemental (Arcane). So when you put a bolt/fire gem into a weapon it will scale with arcane instead of its former physical damage which scaled with either/both skill and strength.
bloodborne,3dyhm6,OOpiumBear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:43 2015 UTC,On weapons that are pure physical damage yes they do. Your weapon then stops gaining benefit from str/skl scaling and instead scales with arcane. Same thing applies when you slot in a gem that gives flat elemental damage.  On weapons that innately have split damage (e.g. Tonitrus) elemental% gems only do something when they match the innate element. You can use any flat elemental damage gems in any split damage weapon to full effect though.
bloodborne,3dyhm6,FurtiveCutless,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:26 2015 UTC,"To elaborate further on this, it's a hierarchy Arcane > Fire > Bolt > Physical. So Arcane will replace any ""lower"" damage type, Fire will replace Bolt, etc."

bloodborne,3dxzm1,bear2008,2,Mon Jul 20 14:10:28 2015 UTC,"Play blind. Learn through trial and error. When you finally manage to overcome an obstacle you'll feel like you've earned it.  Try using stealth in most situations. Try and lure enemies out one or two at a time if you haven't yet. The pebbles you find are great for this. Pay attention to your surroundings and look for visual or audible hints about things lurking around corners. Some enemies are meant to be danced around and some are meant to be taken head on. You'll learn what level of aggressiveness is required for each enemy as you play. Don't feel bad about using blood vials. You'll keep finding more.    Now, get out there and kill some beasts."

For the most part, as long as you're walking and you're not in their line of sight, you won't aggro them (EDIT: until you get right up on them, they will usually notice if you're standing RIGHT behind them), and even line of sight isn't infinite. It's fairly short for most enemies, actually."
bloodborne,3dxzm1,HiHaplo,2,Mon Jul 20 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"Walk, don't run near enemies. If you've got a torch put it away. Stay out of line of sight of enemies. Don't use firearms near groups of enemies unless you think it is necessary."

Having never played a Souls game for me what helped was exploring the whole map of CY and unlocking all doors/areas.  Get to the Clerical beast and unlock the ability to upgrade your weapon and then grind.  I had a circular trip where i could accumulate anywhere for 4k+ a trip.  I finally exited CY with 20 Vitality & Endurance and a +2 Right Hand Weapon.  Really for me it came to grinding and leveling, now that ive a decent character the game really has become significantly more fun."

Because all Abyssal means is Rating 20 so we could be talking about Cold, Arcane, Fire, Bolt, Tempering or Nourishing Abyssal.  Depending on which one you're looking for, the only bosses that drop up to Rating 20 are Depth 3 Abhorrent + Bloodletting Beast, Pthumerian Elder + Descendant, Loran Darkbeast, Watchdog, Ebrietas, Amygdala and, the absolute worst of the bunch, Rom."

Well the gems I'm looking for are radial +Phys or +Blunt/Thrust, radial and waning/triangle +Beast/Kin%, and triangle/waning and radial +R Posion.      I want the beast/kin because they stack multiplicatively to some how generate 139% bonus damage, not sure how that works to be honest, but if any of them drops those more consistently I might work those guys first to help kill the hardest bosses if they count as beast/kin.

bloodborne,3dz1su,cheekymusician,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:13:13 2015 UTC,"the multiplayer style is very similar, but the summoning is different. to summon someone you need to ring the beckoning bell that the messengers gave you, but it costs 1 insight once someone enters your world (it used to cost 1 just to ring the bell, but that just got patched). the bell will look for the chime of a small resonant bell, and pick up any it can connect to, while you just stand there.  once the cooperator has entered your world, a bell maiden will most likely appear. the bell maden will ring a sinister bell, inviting invaders into your world until she is killed.   to invade you ring your sinister bell, causing a bell maiden to appear. if you want to make sure you invade someone, find and kill the maiden. if you want to make sure someone invades you, silence your bell with the silencing blank, but leave the maiden alive.  the only real downside is that the any summoned phantoms lose at least 30% of their health bar, regardless of whether they are a cooperator or an invader."

bloodborne,3dz1su,avyon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:26:17 2015 UTC,"Quite similar, but it's a simplified(perhaps overly so) version of the other games. There's three ""Oath"" runes that behave like covenants when you equip them. The covenants all behave the same way for the most part. Successful invasions in any covenant nets you an Insight point, though as a Vileblood successful invasions will earn you Blood Dregs, which can be consumed for additional Insight.   As a Hunter of Hunters, your role is basically that of the Darkmoon or Blue Sentinels, so occasionally when pairing for co-op, if your partner is ""blood-addled"", you'll spawn hostile to each other. The three Oath runes are at the end of NPC-related Questlines.  To invade, use the sinister Bell, which also opens up your world for invasions. To look for co-op help, ring the beckoning Bell, which will consume insight if successful. To look for people that NEED co-op help, ring the small resonant Bell. The three bells can be bought at the insight shop in the dream."

If you die (the host) he will be returned to his world and you'd have to re-summon. You can't summon in an area where you have killed the boss, but you can get help from the very start of an area meaning you can coop through it. The cooperator will recieve 50% of the echoes that the host gets and theres no min range on getting echoes. As long as you are in the same world, you'll get echoes when something is slain no matter who killed.    Invading: The invader gets a cut on his hp by ~30% (iirc). If he wins he gets 10% of the echoes you need to level up. If you win you get 30% of the echoes he needs to level up. He can't be affected by the surroundings (monsters etc.) while you still can.

bloodborne,3dydpk,Kouge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:52:34 2015 UTC,Usually it's the frenzy and beasthood meters that go on when you spend or lose insight. But poison seems so out of place.
bloodborne,3dydpk,tryllien,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:59:52 2015 UTC,Yep it's the frenzy bar. I don't know why that happens but you can notice the same thing when you spend insight to buy stuff from the vendor in the hunters dream. And the more insight you spend more the bar stays on the screen.

bloodborne,3dwidz,Captain_Gnardog,14,Mon Jul 20 02:58:42 2015 UTC,"While I have never thought of myself as H.P. Lovecraft, my cat does have an extremely socially inappropriate and racially insensitive name, so perhaps you're on to something.   But in seriousness now, while I've read a fair bit of Lovecraft, I find his writing style too heavy. There's lots of laboured description, and that has a tendency to dispel tension for me as much as it builds the same. From my perspective, the comparatively minimalist, utilitarian style of storytelling in the Souls games suits the needs of this kind of horror more effectively than Lovecraft's prose. So I consider Bloodborne an improvement over Lovecraft's mythos, all in all. There's no doubt, of course, that Lovecraft was an important writer. There is similarly small doubt that he was a highly flawed writer, too, so his concepts being improved upon in the execution was likely inevitable."
bloodborne,3dwidz,Trollhoffer,7,Mon Jul 20 03:14:59 2015 UTC,My cats name is Cthulhu. He fhtagns a lot.
bloodborne,3dwidz,MrFlibblesVeryCross,3,Mon Jul 20 10:59:40 2015 UTC,"I do find your interpretation very interesting, and true, but he is also a writer who peaked during the 80's haha. I feel the same way reading some of his writings, some stories I believe weave a thick tale that creates a fantastic narrative through very little and precise words, then others puke out discretion. Personally, I do believe his flaws are all from the fact who wrote years and years ago and he can't match our newer ideas and expectations. I just wish he was still around to modernize those horror dreams he wrote about."
bloodborne,3dwidz,BlondeMcGuinn,3,Mon Jul 20 03:57:24 2015 UTC,"Eloquently put. I would add, the reach of Lovecraft's immense imaginative powers far exceeded the grasp of his writing ability."
bloodborne,3dwidz,thorzog,2,Mon Jul 20 04:24:01 2015 UTC,"I agree. I really loved Shadow over I, yet I found most of his other stories a bit slow and unable to instill the tension they wanted to. But I love his ideas on cosmic horror. Meteors that harbour alien plants that corrupt the entire landscape and fauna. The old ones who wait in the dark spaces. The secret cults devoted to releasing the old ones from the stars. His story lines are fascinating but I feel a bit put off by his writing style at times."
bloodborne,3dwidz,radiosimian,2,Mon Jul 20 13:43:16 2015 UTC,"I'd love to agree, but as HP was being paid by the word back then this kind of taints his ideas. Hence the lengthy descriptions and repetitive nature of a lot of his writing. I would love to read the stuff he wrote for himself, rather than commercially."
bloodborne,3dwidz,dmcredgrave,2,Mon Jul 20 19:42:55 2015 UTC,"Even in his own time, Lovecraft was very often criticized for his archaic style of writing."

bloodborne,3dwidz,goldenalchemist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:12:08 2015 UTC,"While only having read his works within the last few years, they've become very instrumental to my growth as a reader and a writer and he's responsible for some of the stories I love most. I was re-reading the necronomicon collection just prior to Bloodborne's release and the Cosmic horror themes are completely left field for me and absolutely delicious. I think this is part of the reason I love the lore so much.   While I love DeS and DaS for their lore, I haven't done nearly as much personal digging through descriptions and dialogue and whatnot in those games as with BB. I do have thorough understandings of all of them, even DaS2, but Bloodborne's world is engraved in my mind so much more meticulously and it's certainly due to the Lovecraft themes. Couldn't be happier"
bloodborne,3dwidz,Devin3279,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:45:27 2015 UTC,I've owned and read most of his complete works before BB so I'm a big fan :D was pleasantly surprised at the influences but also the originality it kept in it's own concepts and storylines.

It may be a good one for you.  Keep the Kirkhammer for STR build, but I am not a hammer type also, I've been playing with LHB.  As cooperator a few hundred times, most players I meet are using LHB, I will see hammer ones at odd times.  So, you should have a +10 weapon by now, right?  If you haven't used your ""rock"", you should try out other weapons as you will be leveling up to 100-120, plan how you want to level up.  Then use your rock.  You may like to save the game at this point (before using the rock?), so you can try out different builds for NG+.  Try to start the dungeons asap, if you haven't done so (in NG+), you should play at least up to Lower Loran to farm chunks and echoes.  Happy hunting, hunter!!!"

Sprinting R1 then leap attack will catch a lot players off guard. I'd say give it a try if not stick with the one you feel most comfortable.   On a side note try 150 meta after backing up your saves in case you don't like it. That way you'll have longer and heated battles plus you will be able to use slightly larger variety of weapons!

bloodborne,3dwpfl,PansyPang,5,Mon Jul 20 08:56:02 2015 UTC,"saw cleaver, definitely. it's a boss DESTROYER. use a beast blood pellet, fire paper, and transformation attacks and you'll make lightwork of almost every boss."
bloodborne,3dwpfl,battlemaxace,4,Mon Jul 20 04:54:33 2015 UTC,"Saw Spear masterrace. Slightly faster, more range, a sweet knockback and serration transformed and untransformed, meaning those L1 attacks with BB pellets get even more sweet.  Not bagging on the clever or anything though, that shit's fun."
bloodborne,3dwpfl,Volenska,4,Mon Jul 20 10:32:18 2015 UTC,"No weapon is ""best"" overall i'd say, its entirely up to playstyle and what you like and know how to play with. My guess though:  Fast weapons: BoM or Cane Slow weapons: Holy Blade"
bloodborne,3dwpfl,OOpiumBear,2,Mon Jul 20 04:16:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. They're all good. Some have a steeper learning curve (Steak Driver hi), but reward skilled use. I'll talk about the starting weapons.  I think Saw Cleaver is probably the easiest starter weapon. High base damage means you can focus on accumulating vitality and endurance early on rather than str/skill. Reasonably fast attack rate coupled with good stagger power. Serrated edge in short form means extra damage against the first several bosses and a few enemies. I usually start with this and get it to +6 asap. But after that I will find my real weapon and have enough shards to upgrade it. Saw Spear is more or less a moveset swap of this weapon (it has better skill scaling and worse str scaling).  Hunter Axe is a great starter weapon to learn the game with because of its enormous reach when transformed and high hit power, hp recovery, and stagger in either form, but it can be cumbersome against bosses due to its slower attack rate. My first character used this almost exclusively (Saw Cleaver for speed, Axe for reach), and it was the first weapon I got to +10. It does not disappoint against crowds... Transform L2 staggers for days (and sweeps in wide arcs), and the charged R2 will knock most enemies to the ground.  Cane is lackluster early game, but after several upgrades and some skill investment, it becomes a beast. Very fast, good reach when transformed. It's serrated when transformed, dealing bonus damage to the same enemies as Saw Cleaver's short form. It's also a cane, so swag factor over 9000."
bloodborne,3dwpfl,Sljm8D,3,Mon Jul 20 04:59:31 2015 UTC,"ludwig's seems to be the cruise control weapon.  they all have strong points.  you can cheese a lot of enemies with stun weapons, you can shred some bosses with fast serrated weapons, you can stunlock some enemies to death with fast low stamina weapons, you can poke from a distance with some weapons, etc.  it's all situational and personal preference."
bloodborne,3dwpfl,OIP,2,Mon Jul 20 06:07:21 2015 UTC,"Best weapon is whatever you feel most comfortable using.  Practically speaking, there is no single best PvE weapon.  Ludwig's Holy Blade 2H L2 > Amygdala like no other, Threaded Cane is the most accessible way to tackle Loran Darkbeast Paarl, Tonitrus makes Depth 5 Cursed Brainsuckers and Ebrietas a joke, etc."
bloodborne,3dwpfl,If9lp8p,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:28:31 2015 UTC,The Axe works really well against both Amygdala and Darkbeast as well. Use the running 2HR1 for the former and the 2HL2 for the latter
bloodborne,3dwpfl,Chilli_Axe,2,Mon Jul 20 13:57:18 2015 UTC,What matters most is what you enjoy using.  Most if not all weapons in bloodborne are equally effective.  It's a pretty balanced game
bloodborne,3dwpfl,Thegoblinclub,2,Mon Jul 20 06:48:41 2015 UTC,"As cooperator for a few hundred times, I see mostly LHB and BoM.  I've been using LHB so much, try to avoid using it now, instead I started using Saw Cleaver more, boy!, the damage can do to ""hunters"" is amazing.  BoM can do the awesome damage."

bloodborne,3dwpfl,poopitymcpants,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:31:43 2015 UTC,"Best weapon for first time players: Ludwig's Holy Blade. It's a super noob friendly weapon with a good moveset and great damage. It's greatsword form can stunlock pretty much anything, so it's good for players that aren't so comfortable in parrying. Also it's a quality weapon, so you'll be leveling up STR and SKL evenly, gaining you access to most of the weapons on the game to try out as well.  For subsequent playthroughs: Chikage. It's fast, has high damage, a great moveset, and it's blood form does bonus damage to kin enemies, helping out with some of the more annoying bosses and enemies. Plus leveling up BLT also makes your gun do more damage, and leveling up SKL makes your visceral attacks do more damage, so scaling the weapon basically buffs everything about your character.  That said, in traditional Souls fashion, any weapon is good if you're skilled enough at the game."
bloodborne,3dwpfl,LordDivo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:50:12 2015 UTC,It's either Saw Spear or LHB. Anyone who says Saw Cleaver without showing me some math is missing the bigger picture. You get slightly more AR but lose the serrated modifier in long form. What this translates to when using BBP and Fire Paper is less damage when building the meter (assuming you are always using R1->L1->(repeat) until stamina is depleted or the bar is full). IFF you are only using the Saw Cleaver un-transformed then it is the better option.

bloodborne,3dwpfl,Tarnsman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:08:59 2015 UTC,"For me, Uncanny Saw Cleaver and normal Ludwig's Holy Blade. They are easy to get and will let you handle just about anything. Here is how I am doing things going forward. At start I take the Threaded Cane because it is good to deal with crowds when transformed. I pick up the saw spear and then switch between the two, get the saw spear to +3. After killing BSB, I start doing chalices with the intent of getting an Uncanny Saw Cleaver and gems. It ends up doing a bit more damage than the normal one and it a lot easier to get than an Uncanny Saw Spear (for me anyway). I take this weapon to +6 as soon as I can. Once I have that I would switch between Ludwig's and the uncanny Saw Cleaver. The saw cleaver has high base damage and is very spammable. Ludwig's has amazing scaling, does great poise damage in both forms and the transformed R2 will deal with nearly any big mob. tl;dr Uncanny Saw Cleaver and Ludwigs, for me anyway."

bloodborne,3dwpfl,Thegoblinclub,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:15:20 2015 UTC,kinda of a noob at this game. How exactly do you use the chikage to it's full abilities?
bloodborne,3dwpfl,Trollhoffer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:31:00 2015 UTC,"You'll want 50 Bloodtinge and 40 Endurance (for maximum stamina). Some Skill won't go astray, but in the Chikage's trick mode, only Bloodtinge will benefit its damage (and only Skill benefits its normal mode). The trick mode of the Chikage will also drain your HP at a consistent rate, so it's key that you use it when you need it for reliable hits, then transform out of it when you're no longer attacking.   When you transform, the Chikage will be placed in its sheath. If you strike from this sheathed position, the attack will be especially powerful, but be wary of the delay imposed by sheathing the sword. Using the Chikage to its best consists of getting near an opponent safely, transforming, then using the unsheathing attack as the beginning of a combo. Use L1 for the last hit of that combo to go back into the weapon's normal state, exit threat range, then repeat.   It's an extremely powerful weapon, but also demands that you manage your HP and stamina quite tightly. Its HP draining effect means that opponents' attacks are more threatening than usual, and the delay on the initial transformation attack ask that you position yourself and exploit openings reliably. That pressure from its limitations make your stamina management more important, so more is more in this case."

bloodborne,3dwnqi,multiman000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:49:02 2015 UTC,"When you put a fire or bolt gem in a weapon you change its element which nullifies the other current elements it already has.   Weapons scale by letters: F, E, D, C, B, A and S. F is the lowest scaling and S is the highest possible scaling. Scaling means how much your weapons AR (attack rating) benefits from each point in the specific stat which it scales with. You can see the scaling of your weapon in your inventory. A scaling gem would add to how much your weapon benefits from the specific stat. Although as it currently is, percentage damage is way better than scaling gems."
bloodborne,3dwnqi,OOpiumBear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:57:13 2015 UTC,"So if I have a fire gem that adds 7.5% fire damage, would that cause arcane to be the stat to be used primarily or replace one of the stats (if so which one)? Or would arcane be thrown into the mix? And I assume that by scaling gem you mean a gem that would boost or change the weapon scale to a different letter, i.e. if there was a +1 strength scale attached to a weapon that had a D in strength, it would be bumped up to C?"
bloodborne,3dwnqi,OOpiumBear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:08:02 2015 UTC,"Yes. Elemental damage is associated with the arcane stat, therefore it would be best, if you want to go with arcane and elemental gems, that you find a weapon which itself scales great with arcane like Ludwig Holy Blade. But yes it removes the physical part meaning that it no longer scales with skill or strength.    Yes a scaling gem gives a boost to do exactly that, bump up the letter rating although im unsure if there is hidden numbers involved making it so that even though a weapon has an S rating, the gems would still have an effect. I haven't tested this yet. The bump up would depend on how good the gem is and how much +scaling it gives. It is also possible if you have a weapon without e.g. STR scaling, to make it scale with STR by putting in such a gem."

Its fun going arcane but it could prove to be a little hard if its your first playthrough. Although if you plan on leveling your character forever it doesn't matter where you put the points, but at least get arcane to 25 or 50 if you really want it to shine through."

Cleric Beast is made significantly easier by using lots of molotovs (if you run out, I think you can buy some at the store).    If you are really feeling the need to level a bit, I highly recommend leveling up your defensive stats first (vit primarily, but endurance is a good idea if you find yourself out of stamina too often); leveling your offensive stats won't give you much damage at that point in the game, and leveling Vit will increase your survivability by A LOT (since leveling any stat increases your defense, which gets amplified by the extra health you get from vit)."

bloodborne,3dviov,CatMonkeyBird,3,Mon Jul 20 00:05:04 2015 UTC,"The Cleric Beast isn't asking you to be powerful as such, it's asking you to understand a few of the critical mechanics at your disposal and some concepts that go with them. Nothing wrong with gaining a few levels or upgrading your weapons - I'm a fan of both - but the Cleric Beast doesn't require additional power on top of starting stats and equipment to defeat.   One of the major problems Bloodborne inherently poses is that you must attack, but not get struck in the process. It's up to us to work out methods of defending ourselves well enough that we can attack safely. There's a few ways to do this, but a common and relatively easy one is to evade an attack and return with your own. Evasions in this game (and other Souls games) have an invulnerability period towards the beginning of the dodge, making evasions extremely effective defenses for those who understand the invulnerability aspect. This kind of mechanical execution for evasions encourages us to evade through attacks, so our evasion period has minimum interaction with the attack hitbox. I'd recommend evasions as your go-to defense, but there are certainly others:   Most attacks have some kind of flinching property when they strike an opponent, although some opponents are more resistant than others. A sufficiently committed offense and/or the right weapon can turn this flinch property into a strategic cornerstone, both preventing opponents from attacking and fixing them in place for additional attacks. The Hunter's Axe two-handed move set and flinch properties illustrate this kind of play perfectly.  You can parry an opponent by hitting them with a bullet in the right window during their attacks. Usually, this is during and shortly after their attack leaves its telegraph state; you're looking for when an opponent's attack becomes an actual attack rather than being a harmless telegraph animation. A correct parry will result in the opponent entering a special vulnerability state, within which you can press R1 and execute a special, ""visceral"" attack for very high damage. Most attacks from most enemies can be parried.  The simplest defense is to attack from outside of an opponent's range.  This usually means using long-reaching weapons like the Rifle Spear, Hunter's Axe, and so on. It can also mean using projectiles, but the player's projectile attacks are very weak outside of particular builds, so don't count on exploiting projectile defense unless you're building a gunning character or an arcane character. The close combat version of this defense goes extremely well with the flinching style of defense described previously.  Attacking from behind limits the risk of retaliation. As the evasion mechanics encourage us to move through attacks, we can evade in such a way as to finish towards an opponent's flank or rear. Some opponents have attacks that will threaten areas to beside or even behind them, so never get complacent with this approach. Evade into position, get some hits in, and exit threat range.   The Cleric Beast itself is has no particularly special abilities -- just a bunch of HP and some pretty basic attacks. If you can consistently hit the Cleric Beast and exit immediate combat range without being struck (even if you're just getting one hit), then you're winning as long as you do that thing. Given that the Cleric Beast has long attack ranges and, being a large boss, has some additional resilience against flinching, I would recommend evading towards and around him in order to attack from behind. Try to keep the fight towards the middle of bridge's width, and far enough from its ends that you don't get cornered. Keep your space open, then exploit that space. Do what you can not to get hit, and  if you calculate that you can attack safely, attack with everything you have (but leave enough stamina for one evasion)."

bloodborne,3dviov,xemnaught,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:36:31 2015 UTC,"Another boss specific mechanic is damaging limbs.   If you do enough damage to Cleric Beast's legs, for example, he will visibly stagger for a moment. There will be a blood spray and you'll notice. If you can react properly to this animation, you can get in a combo or charge attack for a large amount of damage. Some enemies can even duck down during this animation and expose their head.   This concept goes even further in another mechanic, where bosses restore their limbs' strength. In the Cleric Beast's case, he'll do a roar and glow red. You'll also hear a sound similar to that of using a blood vial. This is a lengthy animation in itself and can also be used as an opening.   Putting these two things together, you get a rather exploitable strategy. Break one leg and work on the other. When he tries to recover, break it and stagger him again! When you're out of openings, be ready to dodge attacks, but most importantly, watch your stamina. You don't want to run out and be unable to dodge a big combo. Use these techniques and look for other openings and Cleric Beast should fall easily.   Oh... And all that also works on his arms ;)"

Throw oil in its face, then throw molotovs at it, additionally if you picked the pistol for your starting gun you can repeat shoot it in the face and stagger it for an easy critical.  It should also be said that Cleric Beast is completely optional as a boss, if you are having issues with it, go get the summoning bell when you have 1 insight from the hunters dream (( easily gotten if you go into the sewer area or if you just witness the boss )).  You can get a summon bell and summon an npc to help you, there are only 2 spots he can be summoned from mind you but the best is the location right next to the first lamp if you have opened the shortcut.  Do take in mind that using the beckoning bell costs you 1 insight per use.  You can also start gaining levels when you have 1 insight if you are having issues."

When you fight Cleric Beast, you must (at the very least) be able to move quickly and manage your stamina well.  I think that learning these skills early on is good practice for Father Cascoigne. The specific tactics are quite different, but Father Cascoigne requires you to move fast and stay light on your feet.

Cleric Beast is technically an optional fight, so if you hate him you can leave him for later and kick his ass when you outlevel him. However, I would suggest killing him as early as possible for two reasons. One, the 4000 blood echoes he drops are useful, as is the Sword Hunter Badge he drops, which lets you buy more stuff at the Hunter's Dream. Two, fighting him helps prepare you for what you need to do to survive fighting other bosses, and Cleric Beast is one of the game's easier bosses so it's a good warm up for the trials to come.

bloodborne,3dv2h5,Gojjamojsan,2,Sun Jul 19 19:27:20 2015 UTC,"I believe Yharnam was among the first things found in the dungeons, and that her blood is the reason Willem coined the ""Fear the Old Blood"" mantra and the reason the whole blood fixation started in the first place.  I believe Yharnam didn't exist in remotely the state it does now and that it likely went under another name prior to Queen Yharnam's discovery. It's likely the city only comprised of what we now know as Old Yharnam, possibly as an extension or split from Cainhurst. The discovery of the labyrinth changed things dramatically.  I'm not sure there's a deeper connection beyond the city being named after her, but I'd love to hear some more speculation about the city's genesis, it's a real grey area."
bloodborne,3dv2h5,Scrubstadt,2,Sun Jul 19 20:25:34 2015 UTC,"Hm that's a fair guess, i always thought she was discovered really late (as she resides at the very bottom) but i guess since she can project her image seemingly anywhere i guess it makes sense.

bloodborne,3dv2h5,Scrubstadt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:44:52 2015 UTC,"Well, my theory is that Byrgenwerth was built over Pthumeru Ihyll, Yharnam's pseudo-tomb, hence the ""Forbidden Grave"", the presence of the Shadows of Yharnam and her post-Rom appearance.

Obviously the 2handed version is blunt and the blunt gems out damage phys 27.2s and the R2 is the same with thrust gems but With R1 attacks I found it to be all physical.

When facing enemies learn their attack patters so you can effectively dodge or parry them. If some enemies prove to be too strong, worry not, you can run past them if needed. For every area there will be shortcuts, the shortcut will usually be visible to you as one of the first things e.g. the gate to the left of the central yharnam lamp, but you have to explore the area further to actually get around and unlock said checkpoint.

bloodborne,3dvwpb,OOpiumBear,2,Sun Jul 19 23:51:05 2015 UTC,"you'll get used to all of it, it's much much much smoother than MH.  just curious - why is the R3 focus feel inconvenient to you?  it's really easy especially on DS4 but thats just imo  the FPS is what it is.  the game has a ridiculous amount of objects and geometry, and the PS4 just sort of can't handle it %100.  i get dips all the time as well unfortunately (esp. in multiplayer) but i guess because i have played previous from soft games it doesn't really bother me.  it sort of comes with the territory lol.  the game would be either unplayable or look a whole lot shittier at 60 and honestly it doesn't really matter when the gameplay is so solid."
bloodborne,3dvwpb,GothMAXMP,2,Mon Jul 20 03:29:38 2015 UTC,"If you do wish to change your controls, you can switch button functions in the accessibility menu of the PS4, but it will remap the buttons for everything, not just Bloodborne. You will get used to locking on though, half the game (exaggeration) is learning when to lock/unlock.   As for FPS, it does get stutters in some places. Try give your console a clean (vacuum the vents, this actually really helps) an focus on how breathtaking the graphics actually are. I'm happy to play ~30fps for the nerdgasms.  As for progressing, there is only one solution; git gud  I hope all goes well in your hunt!"

bloodborne,3dv2ng,Gregory_Fontaine,3,Sun Jul 19 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"Really any build can do them fine, but doing it as an arcane build could be interesting to exploit the weaknesses of each dungeon type. All the Pthumerian enemies are weak to arcane, all the beasts in Loran and scattered in the other types are weak to fire, and all the kin in Isz are really weak to bolt and, to a lesser extent, fire as well. Plus Executioners Gloves with high arcane can make a fair few challenging bosses much easier by avoiding melee range."
bloodborne,3dv2ng,PressXToArclight,2,Sun Jul 19 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, like Walrus I found the full Arcane run to be the easiest for chalice dungeons.

Not to be used while walking around. Stake Driver +9-+10 or Burial Blade +10, Driver used in its untransformed state will provide you fast and powerful sweeping Attack whilst offering insane back stab damage on unaware/well hit enemies,  it's hit is equal to my 2,600 visceral if not a little more. BB in UTF state offers the exact same purpose as the driver, has high rally, and in TF state offers powerful moves with a longer range. The spear beats it vs a lot of tough enemies though.   Any beast boss, save for a few, are cheesed with pungent blood cocktails and the rest are battles of attrition. Anything larger than 2 watchers should be fought with SD or BB instead of spear."

When she does a jump attack roll to the right then focus her front arm that's closest to you. If you manage to break it you'll have time to get in a good number of hits. If you have the damage you could even break her back leg (they're more tanky) during this time. If you do enough damage to her back legs she opens for a visceral. Her head is also pretty susceptible to breaking when she's recovering from a different limb breaking. She'll heal these during the fight, and this allows you to rebreak them. If you've got a decent weapon (saw cleaver is best for this imo) and fire paper. You should be able to take off half her life in a single combo. Keep trying."

I then take my time slowly cutting bits off the beckoner, healing, not punishing his heals, and just making him usde all his health items.  I'm doing this in the hope his co-op will come back in if I leave it long enough.  Unfortunately, the guy doesn't make it and dies in the dirt in pretty much the exact place his partner fell.  This is one of three happy ending gank stories I have.  The rest involve me being pasted to the floor, so I feel you.  I just wanted to let you know that they don't all get away with it."

Back in Dark Souls there were gankers everywhere, like it was their mission to ruin every invader's day. They hated us and we hated them, but we used that hate to fuel ourselves and then we'd come back and we'd kill them, 2 and 3 people all at once, all healing, all backstabbing, all running away when they got in trouble. We'd lose a lot, but it was worth it just to give them a run for their money. And the times that we won?

bloodborne,3drwm5,sickofdying,5,Sun Jul 19 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"I see the argument for ""spec variations"" quite often. With the loss of a viable caster build, BB does feel like it lacks a lot of variety. With that said, it did away with a lot of unnecessary stats. With the robust Souls community, so much theory craft was done such that most people had the same avoidance/poise stats in both Souls games. Eventually, they became irrelevant for the pure fact that most everyone used the same stats except for str, dex, magic, faith which usually revolved around the weapon they wanted to use.    Personally, I don't feel much loss from the lack of a caster cause it doesn't fit that well with the lore. I do agree that NG+ modes are worthless compared to DS and DeS. A few more runes, some fashionborne items, even just some weapon reskins would make NG+ more inviting. As it stands right now, most will likely start a new character instead of doing NG+.  Content wise, I thought BB delivered on some of its best level design From has offered. I was truly impressed. The only disjointed area was Cainhurst, but it was still awesome. With that said, it felt really short. Really really short. I can only guess they cut content to meet Sony's deadline.  I am a huge bloodborne fan and I know I'll probably take time off when the DLC comes out, but I'm quickly going back to DS games since they have more content and replay value. Plus, I still need to do DS2 DLCs."
bloodborne,3drwm5,nosewings,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:17:14 2015 UTC,I can only guess they cut content to meet Sony's deadline.   There is so much in-game evidence that this is the case.
bloodborne,3drwm5,GothMAXMP,15,Mon Jul 20 11:33:30 2015 UTC,"i feel like the complaints are coming primarily from people who are unable to come at BB from a character action perspective ala DMC, Bayonetta, etc.  the RPG elements of Souls games have been streamlined and minimized with the intent of putting as much focus as possible on the action itself.    i often hear these exact same complaints about those action games - they don't have enough content, they need better rewards, there is not enough variety, it is too repetitive after so many playthroughs, etc.  what these people are missing is the fact that action games, BB included, are ""games"" in the most traditional sense possible.  they are a conduit for personal expression and emergent action-based storytelling - a good DMC player, just like a good BB player, will never go through the same area the same way twice, because the entire point of the game is showing off.  that requires a large amount of effort on the part of the player themselves though.  if you don't enjoy creating your own fun like that it is totally fine, i am not trying to put down anyone else's opinion or way of playing.  but i have almost surpassed my entire souls playtime with BB already - and i can't imagine stopping anytime soon.  it has the exact same thing that kept me playing action games for hundreds of hours at a time, which is a sense of the game being nothing more than a loose system for you to wreak havoc in, in the most stylish and absurd way your skills can afford you.  i never get tired of playing because i am always getting better (the skill ceiling is fucking enormous compared to souls) and every time i get better it gives me new options to play with, which in turn makes every encounter feel fresh.    the souls series accomplished that same feeling by giving us lots of items and stats and gear to play with, because the game honestly just lacked the technical depth for replays to be based on action alone for most players.  BB has taken a different approach and that's a really good thing imo.  it helps differentiate it greatly.  i also really appreciate the organic difficulty in BB of things like half-armor, optional paths and boss order, insight (to an extent), and of course the self-directed chalice dungeons.  these are options that often exist in other action games in the form of difficulty levels or ""modifiers"" and they were really nicely integrated.  the randomized CDs also remind me quite a bit of DMC's red palace, in that they are really just set-pieces for the player to perform in under increasingly strenuous conditions, pushing themselves for their own enjoyment.  idk just my own personal opinion on it.  i think the replay value is absolutely there and so is the content, BB just requires a different sort of player and a different sort of mindset than souls does to get the most out of it.  again i hope you don't take this as a dis to your opinion, just wanted to offer another viewpoint to consider."
bloodborne,3drwm5,CatMonkeyBird,5,Sun Jul 19 04:41:17 2015 UTC,"This is a good counter point and totally correct. I much prefer to ignore comparisons with the Souls series (well..except maybe Demons) and treat it as a stand alone game, and its amazing."
bloodborne,3drwm5,thomasjthomasj,3,Sun Jul 19 10:49:46 2015 UTC,"Great post. One thing I love is the design of Forbidden Woods. It seems like such a long, tense marathon of a level, but really it's the player desire to explore that makes it tough - if you stay on the path in the lower half it leads you straight to the boss. When I realised that in NG+ I was amazed. The game feels like it was designed for speedrunners as much as it was for people who want an intense and lengthy action game"

I look at Bloodborne as an experiment, an attempt to take the core Souls gameplay and make it faster, more kinetic -- while also trying to address the standard complaints about magic in Souls games.  So, inevitably, there are some rough spots. But the game is still great -- its world has so much character -- and I'm excited to see FromSoft improve it."

Quality over Quantity, i say.  DkS2 has more quantity, but the quality isn't near as great as BB.  i love almost every section in BB, and i can't say the same for DkS2 or even DkS1, which took a nosedive after Anor Londo."
bloodborne,3drwm5,gehrmanietas,2,Sun Jul 19 07:17:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, my biggest complain of lack of variety is the covenants. 3 covenants total, and all they do is grant you insight. The vilebloods reminded me of the darkwraith covenant, but there is no rewards for the 10, 20, 50, etc insight collected. Only one reward after 1 blood dreg collected.

bloodborne,3drwm5,phraynk,2,Sun Jul 19 09:43:21 2015 UTC,"I believe an improvement in the number of weapons would be a big step to improve more builds, and yes, more areas should be great too :)"

Try comparing it to other PS4 games, not DS2, and this game screams quality over quantity. This was the first game where the first weapon I chose was the weapon I used the entire game and it wasn't because there weren't enough options, but because those first few weapons kick fuckin ass."
bloodborne,3drwm5,WhySpongebobWhy,2,Sun Jul 19 11:10:12 2015 UTC,"Obviously, we can mix one or another but I don't see many advantages specially when you consider that STR mixes perfectly with ARC builds, DEX with BLD, etc.   Well there are,,,like doing the theorycraft about based in 1 weapon or make a ""theme build"" and also which type of runes you will use, will define the ""build"".  There are 15 weapons with lets say 3 different scalings for each other (which they don't have to be ""S"" to do the build of course) with transformations so it does realistically around 150+ different ""build themes"" without counting the firearms!   I've said it before, there are many many build themes to play around and its so much fun and they don't have to be OP to be viable...  If you do a STR based, DEX based, BLD based and ARC based build as you said...and you use 3-4 weapons, 2-3 firearms in each build then its not so specific, but more over a ""qualit-ish-like"" build which is ok, but yeah if you make builds like this, then..there are not many left to do.  What i'm trying to say (and said in the past here)   ""Theme Builds"" are defined by your:  a)caryll runes/covenants, b)the starting class you will go with, c)100 or 120 level and the min-max points, d)the weapon you will use and focus on, e)and the type of gems you will use for this specific wep/build  There is a solution to your ""problem"" ... but i really hope dlc will bring 4-5 new weapons and firearms to play...while most will think 4-5 new ""builds"" , but for me at least would be like 30+ new ""theme builds"" :P"
bloodborne,3drwm5,tombombodil,2,Sun Jul 19 12:21:03 2015 UTC,"I feel like my only real complaint about bloodborne is how inaccessible a caster build is.  The vast majority of damaging spells are found late in the game and require a high Arcane score to even use.  If that weren't bad enough, the spells use bullets so you either have to accept that you'll be using blood bullets and, in effect, gimping your healing capacity, or only have a few bare casts and, either way, you're sacrificing the use of your gun in order to cast the spells.  I just feel like it is next to impossible to make a casting build prior to NG+1 and that really limits possible NG builds to, literally, STR or DEX."
bloodborne,3drwm5,Redingard,2,Sun Jul 19 14:38:41 2015 UTC,"Bottom line: technically? Yeah, there's less variety. There's a reason I stopped playing BB after 250 hours and I'm STILL playing Dark Soul 1 after 800 hours and 4 years. But that's missing the point that I played BB for TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOURS. I can't even THINK of the last AAA game that lasted me that long; it was probably DS 2.   ""Less variety"" in a vacuum isn't a criticism or a point against a game. Filet Minion doesn't exactly have a ton of variety, it's one piece of meat from the same cow, but it's still exquisitely delicious, and in fact, more variety would have made it worse."

bloodborne,3drwm5,BorneByTheBlood,5,Sun Jul 19 18:51:20 2015 UTC,"What the game lacks badly is upgrading of armor/weapons.  No elemental based upgrading sucks balls... can't customize your weapons due to it (gems aside) and armor gets no upgrades at all.  That being said, I still don't know if I consider BB to be a true ""souls"" game.  It plays completely differently to them all and just because it's the same people who made it, doesn't make it part of the same series."
bloodborne,3drwm5,mo0trix,2,Sat Jul 18 22:40:37 2015 UTC,"To be fair, upgraded armor, even if each upgrade to +10 added only 2% buff per upgrade, would destroy the enemies ability to kill you. Unless you suck balls the executioner gear can be relied upon even up until NG++ Mid game, if I could upgrade this then it'd be unfair to PvE and don't even get me started on how PvP could be countered heavily with certain gear. Not mention some rune, I can survive a full Rom skyshard cast twice without healing in NG+3.   Now, I would be interested in upgrade paths affecting the transformation of the weapon. For example, Ludwigs Holy Blade could be upgraded down the Dexterity path shaving off Strength/Arcane scaling to D and making Dex scale to S whilst the Greatsword is now a Great Scimitar that attacks like the Undead Giant, or the Stake Driver could be set to upgrade for Propulsion, Powder (KEG4LIFE), or both but in lesser portions, Propulsion would upgrade it to jab faster, slightly, and charge equal to its untransformed state +.15seconds or Powder would make the charge do 4x instead of 3x and if (and only if) it successfully hits an AoE of equal damage and knock back will hit anyone fairly close to the original target whilst also making Jabs do mini explosion, albeit each jab is slower they would have longer range and a small aoe."
bloodborne,3drwm5,mo0trix,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:48:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think 2% more armour or resistance is going to stop anything from killing you.

bloodborne,3drwm5,FlipBlack,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:56:34 2015 UTC,"I would agree if both games didn't share a similar lore, the same core gameplay, sound effects, co-op and pvp, covenant system and game design."

bloodborne,3drwm5,HansVanHugendong,3,Sun Jul 19 03:51:03 2015 UTC,"The similarities between BB and DaS are so many compaired to a game like Half Life and Portal. The same mechanics between HL and Portal are hardly existant, whereas besides a few tweaks BB and DaS are played pretty much the same way. There are a whole lot of things proving that BB is a Souls game, but I'm to tired to point them all out. A few though would be core gameplay, such as the fighting mechanics (regular and strong attacks, the lock on and rolling, etc) the co-op and pvp, and covenants (a big hint and tie in to the souls games right there imo)."
bloodborne,3drwm5,HansVanHugendong,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:25:12 2015 UTC,"Again - Similarities that are found in many games don't make them part of the same series.   The guns and lack of shields (and let's not count the pathetic wooden one) make the combat different.   It's also set in a world far removed from what any souls game is.   The co-op system is different in the way people are summoned and can invade also.  Gems don't exist in any souls games, runes don't exist in any souls game... there are things similar, but they ARE different, and that's my point here.   There is always going to be similarities but I'd be more inclined to say BB is its own game... and if they make a sequel, it'd be a Bloodborne game, not a ""souls game"".    Hell, I could argue that all the souls games are really ""Field"" games as Kings Field 1,2 and 3 hold similarities to the souls games and came before them."

The gameplay feels a lot more precise and gripping (cough cough every single attack from ornstein and smough coming half a nanometer away from my balls).

Sadly, I don't enjoy the chalice dungeons a whole lot. I was hoping each chalice variant would have more unique tilesets, for starters. What really gets me is the near complete lack of ambient noises; it's why Loran's my favorite.  In regards to overall replayability mechanics, Demon's Souls bar-none had my favorite. The problem was that you had to be offline to guarantee experiencing all of it.  Still, Bloodborne clicks with me enough to warrant huge replayability, and the dungeons are entertaining enough with Netflix going. Even so, your concerns are literally perfectly valid and I pray they're taking them into account."

Who would ""revel as babes"" (a very strange phrase to use) when the ribbon is clean? The person who lost it."
bloodborne,3dt21m,Abyss_walking,4,Sun Jul 19 08:15:06 2015 UTC,"i think it's worth doing some reading on what they actually are, or are heavily inspired by.  from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homunculus :  ""The German playwright Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust, Part 2 (1832), famously features an alchemically created homunculus. Here, the character of Homunculus embodies the quest of a pure spirit to be born into mortal form, contrasting Faust’s desire to shed his mortal body to become pure spirit. The alchemical idea that the soul is not imprisoned in the body, but instead may find its brightest state as it passes through the material plane is central to the character.""  i think that the messengers in the game are the personification of the moon presence's maternal desire for reproduction, but that because it is a great one, this encompasses a whole other type of conception, pregnancy, gestation and birth.  it is the transference of something beyond comprehension and existence as we understand it into the muddled, blind world of mankind - something that could be considered ""pure spirit"" in a certain sense, struggling for a corporeal existence.  that end goal is why they help/seemingly worship the hunters and are strangely fond of/attached to human things, imo.    /u/abyss_walking pointed out in their comment that they seem to be dead children, and i think that's not quite correct but close.  they want to BE children, or more specifically, a singular child, of the moon presence.  i believe it is also a hint to the slightly infantile (from a human perspective) nature of the great ones - they are not driven by logic but pure purpose, or essence.  it's part of what makes our attempts to understand them ultimately so futile and i think the idea is also supported by the strong theme of infanticide that runs throughout the game.  i personally believe the theory that they are like, hyper logical thinking machines or something to be a little bit absurd - they are all-knowing and all-encompassing but what makes anyone think that would look anything like our conventional models of intelligence?    idk i love this game if you can't tell lol  i'm sure my hodge-podge theories are prolly easily debunked by someone more knowledgeable but yea that's how i see it"

bloodborne,3dt21m,Abyss_walking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:45:30 2015 UTC,"well i read through it carefully and it seems like what you're saying is that you think oedon is the host of the dream.  i would ask, why does the moon presence descend then?  why does it embrace us?  why does it follow us so closely everywhere we go?    the ""dream"" occurs during the ""night"".  when the ""night"" is over, the ""dream"" ends.  that is the whole connotation between the two, and in the game, the hunt is synonymous with the night.  it is literally the night of the hunt, wherein you experience the hunter's dream.  so that is what's going on there.  paleblood refers to the great ones as a whole, including the moon presence, and their (very literally) pale blood.    i just don't see much evidence that supports the idea that anyone but the moon presence is the host.  seems like a stretch to me but you have obviously thought a lot about it so upvoted anyways lol  interesting discussion all around"
bloodborne,3dt21m,GothMAXMP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:17:01 2015 UTC,"The MP descends because Gehrman is dead, and Oeden needs to MP dead for the surrogate they chose to ascend.  Eileen and Djura gave their life to Gehrman, yet the dream goes on as does the night.   What proof do you have he Moon Presence follows us around, what evidence do you have the MP is the host of the dream other than that one time he shows up at the end. I have item descriptions directly linking Oeden with both the term Contract (never mentioned again outside the old man) and the founding of the Hunters Dream (umbilical cord)  The only references to the Moon Presence refer to the MP as Paleblood, so I don't really see all that much evidence to support MP being the host. Actually, there isn't any evidence to support that claim"
bloodborne,3dt21m,Abyss_walking,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:13:37 2015 UTC,"hmm idk man.  pretty sure you're the only person who thinks this.  it just doesn't make any sense to me unless you're saying that oeden is working like, secretly.  coming from the belief that mergo is oedeon's child as well, why would oedon ask us to kill her?    and the dream does not go on for them.  their hunter's dream is over, along with their own nights of the hunt.  but it is not just one singular night that has been perpetually grinding away.  we arrive on an altogether new night of the hunt.  i'm slightly confused about your evidence concerning oedon re the word ""contract"" and the umbilical cords.  i kind of don't really see it at all unfortunately.  and i believe the MP is referred to specifically as the creator of the hunter's dream in the strategy guide.  the evidence is pretty consistent - she DOES follow us around, as seen by the moon growing larger and closer all the time.  when she embraces us after killing gehrman, we become the next gehrman, very clearly.  we need to eat the 3 cords to confront her, not oedon.      it kinda seems like a huuuuuuge stretch that mainly exists just to serve as a counterpoint to the prevailing theory.  it even says at one point that beckoning the moon is what CREATED the hunter's dream i believe.  just seems weird to me that a completely third party would actually be in charge along with the idea of oedon's motive being to stop the hunt (or perpetuate it?  i'm not sure reading your argument sorry)."
bloodborne,3dt21m,GothMAXMP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:30:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, this isn't going to have any citations with it as its just an interpretation, so bare with me.  My argument is that Oeden is attempting to force the Yharnamites to evolve and transcend to being Great Ones by using the Blood and Insight. He attempted this with the Pthemurians, but the Moon Presence descended and corrupted Mergo (think to the dream your character has after receiving the blood transfusion), and threw Pthemuria into chaos.  Fast foreward to Yharnam, and Oeden (as the Blood Minister, the guy who makes you sign a contract) is selecting individuals to become Dream Hunters in hopes that one of them will gain enough Power (Blood echoes) and Knowledge (Insight) to be able to kill the Moon Presence and ascend.  I beg to differ, looking at Eileen's dialogue if she's hostile, she doesn't just hunt crazy people, she wants all hubters dead. Maybe she believes it would break the cycle, and she wouldn't live out the rest of her days fighting through the same Paleblood Night.  As  to the word contract, you sign one when you create your character and are given Yharnam blood. The only other time the word Contract is mentioned is in the description of the one-third of Umbilical cord (at least according the the guide as I've recently been told -_-, damn inconsistencies!)  I've got the guide right here in front of me, and Miyazaki's interview says no such thing."
bloodborne,3dt21m,Abyss_walking,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"i wasn't referring to the miyazaki interview, i was referring to the actual page on the moon presence itself as a boss.  i'm almost %100 positive i remember it stating that she was the creator of the hunter's dream.  i could be wrong tho of course!  and part of my issue with the idea of oedon as the blood minister is that i really don't see the great ones as being involved with mankind on that level.  even in the most direct interactions they have with normal humanity the tone is still very passive.  i believe they actually ""conversed"" with the pthumerians, but remember, the pthumerians were a race of god-like beings most likely before they ever came into contact with a great one.  mankind is nothing - we are trash to the great ones and hardly even useful as tools (look at how much a person must be reduced to just become the lowly guardian of the hunter's dream even, a crippled, drooling, nameless husk).    i also don't really see them the same way some other people seem to, controlling the universe from behind the veil through complex machinations.  i said before that i see them as largely infantile in nature, without logic and purely driven by purpose.  i actually believe oedon is the exception to this in that what makes him unique is his lack of purpose.  when it says, ""Every great one seeks a surrogate, even oeden"", i think that distinction of ""even oeden"" is extremely important.  it characterizes him as somehow different from the other great ones, and with seemingly less desire (although the innate desire of reproduction overrides even his ""nothingness"").  so why would something formless, thoughtless, mindless, desire-less and all-encompassing bother to try and recruit yharnamites to kill something that doesn't even seem to present any form of direct threat, something that is very likely his own offspring?  and i think you are just confused because of the way the game plays out as far as night itself is concerned.  there's nothing that seems to suggest that yharnam is actually in a perpetual state of night , only that we, specifically the player character, are currently trapped within this specific night.  eileen says, ""and on the night of the hunt even?"" when she talks about you arriving.  that tells me right off the bat there are nights that are NOT the hunt.  even gilbert says, ""you're in luck though, tonight the hunt is on"" when referring to your chances of reaching cathedral ward.  there is also the cathedral key thing, an item which exists in the lore only to signify that the hunt is over.    think ""groundhog day"" - the only person who is reliving that day over and over and over is bill murray.  nobody else is trapped in that day, he is living in an alternate timeline that exists until he can fulfill a set of conditions that allows him to re-join the rest of the universe.  it's pretty much the exact same thing here.  when eileen and djura refer to ""dreaming"" that's what they're talking about - they have lived that experience, but the night ended, and they woke up.  that is why they no longer dream.    and i just feel like, in the face of everything else, the ""contract"" thing just doesn't hold much water.  all hunters have to sign contracts.  they are simply preying on the sick, weak, poor, hungry, etc., here.  something along the lines of, ""oh you're very ill?  well this might just help.  but if you want yharnam's blood, you need to do something for yharnam.""  all in all it is a pretty damn cool theory but it just doesn't fit the overarching world logic imo.    btw all my quotes are obviously paraphrasing from memory so yea lol"

bloodborne,3dt21m,Abyss_walking,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:27:15 2015 UTC,"I have a similar theory regarding mp and oedon. In Lovecraft lore there are two great ones named azathoth, and nyarlathotep. In that lore nyarlathotep is both the son and messenger of azathoth, enacting his will. I have a theory that oedon is in fact azathoth, and mp is nyarlathotep. What lead me to this is azathoth. In Lovecraft lore he is often observed to go against other great ones, and his name is a reference to the alchemical term azoth. Azoth was a term used to describe a universal medicine, and to quote it's Wikipedia page ""Azoth is the essential agent of transformation in alchemy. It is the name given by ancient alchemists to Mercury, the animating spirit hidden in all matter that makes transmutation possible."" And on top of that a commonplace name for mercury was ""quicksilver"" which is also used in the game for bullets and can come from blood. I think that oedon is the creator of the dream, but mp is it's caretaker, a messenger for oedons will."

Before you defeat Rom, when you go to Yhar'har'har  there are no corpse-caskets, but there are pigs roaming around. At least 2 of these pigs are DIRECTLY replaced with the corpse caskets after the blood moon is revealed.  My thinking was something along the lines of: since these giant pig-beasts eat humans, once the ""truth"" was revealed after defeating Rom, we truly see them for who they are, an abomination made of the corpses they eat.  I just always found the Pigs and also the Snakes really strange in the whole context of things. They differ quite a lot from the other types of beasts that we see.

Some say both are. Caskets are a way of honoring and sealing the dead to prevent smell, disease, rot, and clutter. Given how close these chalice and city cultures are connected, the customs would also be connected.

But now there are two possibilities: Either the School of Mensis did the ritual once and the Bell Maidens are preforming the ritual again, or the price of entering the nightmare (or any dream) is Death.  The first can be seen as supported by Old Yharnam, and the state Yharnam's in when we first get there. The moon is low, but is being held at bay by Willem and Rom. The ritual needs to be preformed again.  The second is a little less, though could be interpreted as equally viable. We all know the theory that the Old Hunter's Bone is suspected to not be an apprentice of Gehrman's, but his actual corpse. If Gehrman were killed it would want to be kept quiet, especially if it were under very suspicious circumstances.   Just my 2 cents"

And in some way great one stem cells can help you turn into one of them. Like something like a bone marrow donnor or something. You see what guides stem cells to turn into other cells is the extracellular matrix. so maybe the stem cell populate the hunters body and change us.   that is about as far as i can take the theory.

Recently I had taken interest in all the hardened people in yahargul. They're literally integrated with the architecture and the areas surrounding them are all gray. Almost like they simply phased into existance and turned to stone.  Doubt its as worth taking a look at as the coffins are but I always felt like it was really unique and a pretty passed-over part of the game considering its one small area with an extremely high density of the oddity.  Also, those statues in the lower parts of Yahargul of the cramped casket enemies. What's up with that? Maybe the same type of ""hardening"" or ""phasing into existance""? . Right before you tough the micolash corpse in Yahargul there are loads of statue-ized cramped caskets. Why? Were they proud of those monstrosities or something?  I dunno.

bloodborne,3duczy,Vaderfart500,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:09:51 2015 UTC,Do you mean level? 100-120.
bloodborne,3du6b4,fluisteren,4,Sun Jul 19 14:37:49 2015 UTC,Your level certainly is a bit on the low side but your main problem is your increadibly low Vit. 15 is kind of a joke for this point in the game. I'm not saying it's impossible to get by with that amount but it's probably gonna be a bad time for a new player.
bloodborne,3du6b4,FurtiveCutless,3,Sun Jul 19 14:42:18 2015 UTC,Is Endurance important ? Should i level just vitality ?
bloodborne,3du6b4,NeverGotWhooshed,2,Sun Jul 19 14:45:05 2015 UTC,no yes
bloodborne,3du6b4,Shintasama,2,Sun Jul 19 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"Both are important. You should watch your stamina consumption in battle and make sure you have enough to get in, attack as many times as possible in the window the boss gives you and roll out. Using 2H axe I like to have 30+. After getting stamina where you want it and str or dex at a soft cap, pump everything into VIT."
bloodborne,3du6b4,FurtiveCutless,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:58:27 2015 UTC,"I usually level endurance to 20 and then stop until I get everything else to where I want it.  Due to how fast stamina recovery is in this game I'd say end isn't too important, at least for PvE."
bloodborne,3du6b4,BorneByTheBlood,4,Sun Jul 19 14:47:20 2015 UTC,"Don't say this without knowing his knowing his weapons as your advice is far more cruel than helpful in some cases, ie a Hunters Axe user wants to get a minimum of 26 Endurance and at least 30 for an aficionado of the Stake Driver. 20 is easily perfect for a Cleaver user, I'd say 22 for the cane, and a good few other weapons. But LHB, Riflespear, Axe, BB, BoM, Kirk, and Beastclaws all need more stamina than 20 to be noteworthy."

I have used pretty much all the weapons in the game for a long time with only 20end and I am doing just fine.  So what if I cannot spam the BoM for three complete R1 combos? The solution is pretty simple, you will have to break off from your enemies a little bit earlier than you would like."

bloodborne,3du6b4,Trollhoffer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"That's a subjective opinion.   Followed by   I have used pretty much all the weapons in the game for a long time with only 20end and I am doing just fine.   A purely subjective analysis.   One can do fine with 20 Endurance with any weapon, for sure, but some weapons really ask for more demanding sequences. Under certain levels of stamina, some combos can't even be completed, and then there's the costs of charge attacks and their follow-ups. Having considered all that, one will also want enough stamina left for one or two evasions (depending on weapon choice and strategy).   Crucially, though, being able to add an attack to a chain is a large boost to potential damage output. What's better? Four additional attack on a weapon from a level of strength or skill, or two stamina? That depends on whether that additional stamina takes one over a threshold into another possible attack or evasion. So we might say that four additional attack is better than two stamina, as two stamina is unlikely to cross a threshold. Extended over, say, five levels? That's twenty damage against ten stamina. Ten stamina is very likely to cross a threshold allowing more actions to be linked in an uninterrupted chain.   Stamina is the key resource when it comes to taking most actions of significance in any Souls game. That's not to underplay the role of other resources and strengths, but our first soft caps are at twenty-five in this game, which is about as low as they've ever been. So, naturally, everyone advocates for minimising stamina investment (despite it never decreasing in value until forty endurance) and raising damage stats to fifty (which are very specific investments). Even considering that your scaling damage is usually further multiplied by weapon gems, one misses out on plenty of damage and versatility by investing in stamina too scarcely.   For a properly aggressive Hunter's Axe, Kirkhammer, or Ludwig's Holy Blade build, 20 is way too low. Those weapons are basically usable at that level of stamina, but they're remarkably limited, and the understanding derived of those weapons will be equally limited."
bloodborne,3du6b4,kingchess33,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"Countering a subjective viewpoint with another subjective viewpoint is entirely valid when the conversation is about a third party whose subjective viewpoint is unknown. It implies that the third party might fall anywhere within the given range, or even outside it.   Either way, I'd argue that though it's fine to debate optimal stamina levels, right now we're talking about an underleveled end-game player on their first run. Vitality is probably the most important stat to pump at this point, and we should only worry about endurance if he's going to be leveling up a lot more (unlikely at this late point in the game), or if he plans to continue avoiding hits as a glass cannon (unlikely as he's asking about survivability)."
bloodborne,3du6b4,Trollhoffer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:37:11 2015 UTC,"Countering a subjective viewpoint with another subjective viewpoint is entirely valid when...   It's not valid to counter a subjective perspective with another when one, in that very same counter statement, hinges on a subjective perspective. One has to be fair and consistent. If you critique a set of information specifically for being subjective (as you did), then it's illogical and inconsistent to return with another subjective set of information.   So when you begin by saying,   That's a subjective opinion.   the immediate suggestion given to an audience is that the following information provided will be objective, or at least that the perspective of the writer will include a wider array of ""acceptable subjectivities"" (for lack of a better term right now)."
bloodborne,3du6b4,kingchess33,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:04:00 2015 UTC,"But the entire topic is subjective. Cutless's point (not mine, check your usernames) that it was a subjective opinion doesn't work to discredit the original opinion by any measure, but the introduction of his own subjective opinion broadens the frame of reference that the discussion, and thus the end result, must take into account.  This would be different if the topic were, in fact, objective in nature. For example, talking about something like weapon AR and damage would not be subjective, as there are verifiable formulas for damage calculation and damage reduction, resulting in one clear answer. The question ""How much endurance is enough?"" is not clearly defined enough to answer objectively. Depending on your interpretation of ""enough"", you could say that starting endurance is fine, as you can use all the weapon attacks, or that 99 endurance is best, as it's the maximum stamina you can reach.  As a result, one player finds that they can't use certain weapons without a specific endurance threshold, and another says that they think a lower threshold can work. Neither are wrong, but neither are necessarily right either. The subjective nature of the topic requires subjective input, and the OP can then review the suggestions and see what works for them, considering all information given. As another example of the value of subjective opinions, if you asked what the best level for vitality was, and answers ranged from 30 to 50 based on user experience and SL limitations, then you would know that nobody thinks you should have a VIT lower than 30 or higher than 50, and there might be a reason for that.  At the end of the day, a conversation on subjective points is more of a community poll. A single answer given authoritatively might be construed as a hard-and-fast rule shared by the community as a whole (see: kill the dogs first), but a range of opinions based on personal experiences makes clear that there is no clear ""magic bullet"" to shoot for.  ...At least, that's my subjective opinion on the matter."

There's approaches that simply don't work without high stamina for all those weapons. Great example? The usual Bloodtinge Chikage build.

As of now you've put 4-5 points top in VIT, meaning you've probably went for a high damage high risk build which relies on you being able to dodge and just overall not get hit at all whilst killing enemies in minimum amounts of time. At the endgame you should be min 70 i'd say and at the very max 100. Otherwise it gets too easy and thats not fun. You adress the problem yourself, lack of VIT."

bloodborne,3duf4o,BorneByTheBlood,2,Sun Jul 19 18:37:56 2015 UTC,"This would make the game too easy, but I won't give you the typical argument. My reasoning for this is based on weapon choice, elemental planning, boss tactics, and viability.  Weapon Choice: There are FAR fewer weapons than any Souls game has ever experienced before, with even fewer being viable the further you go into NGs. In previous games, for example DS2, the vast amount of weapons could only truly be utilized in certain builds and many were inaccessible to many builds unless you wanted to play as though everything revolved around treating any enemy like a mini boss. My prime reason for this is also effected by the weight system, which for many builds required readjusting if you wished to meet the pvp meta viable stats. In bloodborne getting to 120 shouldn't take more than two hours if you've done it before, because you can enter the forbidden woods in just 13 minutes if you speed through to the bosses.  Yes you can fuck up a character for the pvp meta, but almost everything available to any build instead of the strict DS standards which for many builds eliminated 60% of the other weapons, if not more.       Elemental planning, Boss tactics, and Viability: Elements are useful for some area, mainly a few bosses and chalices you know the layout of. Respecs being offered would make far to many bosses and chalice farms insanely easy and then allow players to run back to their old build once they took advantage of the system. I for example could very easily take my stats to no vit, no end, str16/ski12/bt0, and arcane 99 to two shot the Brainsuckers in my 3 chalice farm spots to get +70/72.5 flat arcane/fire/bolt radial, triangle, and waning, in addition then suddenly respec to no vit, 16 end, 40 Str, 60Skill, 0BT, and 15 arcane to 5 shot, with no risk of taking damage, D5 M watchers to get 27% phys gems or 30%Blunt/Thrust gems. After this I'd be able to immediately go back to my regular build and then continue on with pvp. Acquiring items and making the acquisition easier is the right of those specialized to do so, but making acquisition essentially cost less and a joke for anyone is pathetic, for a souls game no less.        Lastly I want to mention I'd love to respec, I'd love to take the 41 points put into arcane on my indefinitely leveling character into my BT and Vit to buff them both up to 78 instead of farming 38 million echos to do so. But I shouldn't be exempted from my poor choices, bloodborne, and all From games, are about struggling through trials and using the knowledge and abilities earned to your advantage. Given this, there is no method to apply stat respec options to the game that doesn't invalidate the core principals of it. This game doesn't punish you harshly either, at least before the SRRC patch, rolling a new character takes little time to build up to a viable build, which unlike the other games is the biggest deterrent ""It takes nothing"" to rebuild a character unlike other soul games where rebuilding a character from the ground up took a lot longer.      I hope I made some valid and good points, and maybe even changed your stance. Have a good time, let us cleanse these foul streets!"

Bloodborne feels so short on content already that it would kill so much replayability if you never had to make a new character. One skill, one strength, one bloodtinge, and one arcane is pretty much all you need to experience all the options in the game. Anything other than that, like quality, STR/ARC, SKL/BLT, PvP builds, etc., are the only reasons to keep playing after you've tried everything.  Besides, I like the feeling of commitment that you make when building your character. The best part of my bloodtinge build was struggling through the game until I made it through Cainhurst, and then picking up the Chikage and becoming unstoppable as a reward for my struggles. If you could just take a STR character through the game easily, then switch once you got the Chikage, it would feel kind of cheap to me."

From has a history of not listening and listening, but the one thing they don't have is a history of taking players subjective stances into account over there own design choices.

In one match, I was killed and as It flashed YOU DIED on the screen, my opponent dropped dead from the 400 damage I hit him with just before he hit me.  I've seen people stagged from gunshots that rang out minutes earlier, I've seen health regain from hits that didn't land, and I could go on...

I personally find the experience of picking through the lore on my own much more fun. But once you feel you've got your basic interpretation, that's a good time to read external analyses and the interview with the creator and whatnot. There's lots of hard-working people out there still throwing ideas out and they're worth hearing, even if a decent percentage of them are basically fanfiction."

When I was going through my first play I was trying to absorb as much of the story as I could, and I made good use of the PS4 recording vids and screenshots.

My advice would be to think analytically about everything you come across. There are so many deductions you can make without a single line of exposition. For example, an NPCs clothes can tell you a lot about their background and the placement of items and corpses can also tell a story. Things aren't laid out for you most of the time, so you have to try to make conclusions based on the little information that you have."
bloodborne,3drbpa,joffreyf,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"Coming into the game, I wanted to be fully immersed in Bloodborne's world. That quickly went out the window during my 2nd boss fight. I was chugging along, killing enemies absorbing the story until I got to this boss. I died so many times my only focus was to defeat this boss. Every single boss after that, I continued to die an absurd amount of times. I don't know if they fix the loading times, but back when I was playing the loading times were about 45 seconds per death. Most of that waiting time for me was spent in anger and strategizing. Halfway though the game I realized that I didn't know what the hell was going on story wise. All I wanted was to get to the next boss. Upon completion, I just read about the story and the lore from here and a few YouTube videos.  TLDR: I went through the game first and then read about the story and lore."

Learn its attack moves and bait them, always walking or dodging backwards but staying in front of the head. It will make one of four moves.     Burp lava - This is a HUGE window to slap its legs. Bite left to right - This one you want to run around the left side ASAP and slap the legs. Bite right to left - This one you want to run around the right side ASAP and slap the legs. Snap a couple of times with fire in its mouth - ignore this and keep dodging and bait a new attack.   If the legs break, slap 1-3 times more depending on the speed of your weapon and get away, it will stomp the ground and deal huge damage in an AoE. Bear in mind if you get too far away it will charge you, simply dodge this and get close to the head once again. Rinse and repeat.    I know this has nothing to do with OPs post but someone might click the post in hopes of finding a solution to their defiled doge problems only to find out that it's arcane only, so i'm just sharing my tactic for non-arcanes!

bloodborne,3ds2pv,Sljm8D,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:56:50 2015 UTC,You're partly wrong but you're correct. In BB the soft cap means the first time diminishing returns start which is 25 for the offensive stats and 30 for the defensive stats. 50 is the hard cap for both all stats where the stat will gain further diminishing returns. Max level is 99. While normally soft would be diminishing and hard would be the final level it's not so in the BB community. Its Soft->Hard->Max. where it normally would/should be soft->slightly harder->Hard. Both is somewhat right and wrong in this situation. /u/Recognise .. Added your name so you'd read it aswell.
bloodborne,3ds2pv,OOpiumBear,-2,Sat Jul 18 23:05:59 2015 UTC,"That's not what hard cap means. :)  You can invest points after 50. Therefore, it's not a hard cap.  English is in fact my primary language."

Just because a thing is used one way amongst one group, doesn't make a different use of the same thing in another group, wrong.    Something hard is still penetrable but its harder to do so which in turn results in the heavier diminishing returns. I'd say this is the more correct way of using soft and hard caps. Something hard doesn't prevent going onwards, only something unpenetrable/max would. 1-25 = No walls 26-50 = plastic walls 51-99 = brick walls 100+ = Area 51 a.k.a. impossible.

The terms hard cap and soft cap are borrowed from the world of professional sports, where the words are used to describe salary caps.  Hard cap is the absolute maximum allowed salary, which can't be exceeded for any reason  Soft caps are salary levels which, when exceeded, will incur a penalty, usually a fee.  It should be pretty clear how these can apply to RPG ideas.  You can google ""define hard cap"" if you're still confused.  http://www.davemanuel.com/investor-dictionary/hard-cap/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap#Hard_cap.2C_soft_cap_and_salary_floor http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm#Q2  We have multiple soft caps.

bloodborne,3dscpb,TheCosmicWhale,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:05:28 2015 UTC,"You should be able to rent, maybe buy?- games from playstation now and it streams the game, you  get to try it and i guess skip downloading it, I've seen stuff about it before, but idk if Bloodborne will be on it, i think they already have a beta or released the service, you could look into it on google?"
bloodborne,3dscpb,TheCosmicWhale,2,Sun Jul 19 00:38:47 2015 UTC,"Have tried to search on Google! What I saw was that Playstation 4 games aren't there yet I guess, but I was a little confused about the service in general so I was hoping maybe people here had heard more about it! Ah well, I think there's hope for the future! (Although I did read somewhere the games take a huge graphics hit which I can understand) I suppose I will have to be content with watch playthroughs on YouTube until they come out with the PS5 and it gets significantly cheaper :) silly Sony and their console exclusives denying me my souls game!   I do have Dark Souls 3 to look forward to though :D"
bloodborne,3dscpb,yoursadow,3,Sun Jul 19 00:44:45 2015 UTC,"It's just a way to provide backwards compatibility via streaming software instead of reading PS3 discs. So it seems like you pay a monthly rate and then are able to play games from past generations that they've put up. It's not supposed to be a replacement for either buying a disc or downloading a digital version of PS4 games.   TL;DR: Playstation Now is for older games, not a way to play PS4 titles."

(btw use the clothes you like best, as most of the time it doesn't make a huge difference) Insight does a lot of things. You can buy things with it, it is required for co-op and invasions (you are invading, not being invaded) after you have 15 some enemies get new attacks, after 40 you start to see things you couldn't see before, and after 60 you will constantly hear a baby crying very faintly. (both of these last two happen after you kill a certain boss and progress to the final moon phase) Soft cap is 25 and hard cap is 50 This is personal preference, as both are pretty good in a Skill build. Cane has better scaling but the spear does constant extra damage to beast while the cane only does extra beast damage in whip form. You choose! (also be sure to try the Reiterpallasch and blade of mercy when you can) You can go through the gate at the top of thw long flight of stairs in the cathedral ward (the one guarded by the giant) with the special item in the shop called the ""Hunter Chief Emblem"" which opens a few routes for you. Try the big hairy guys you see in the sewers near the crow lady (HER  name is Eileen btw) they sometimes drop them"

bloodborne,3drl5s,danamak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:38:11 2015 UTC,"The badges let you buy new weapons in the hunters dream. insight, besides being a currency also affects how enemies can attack. no idea since I haven't played long enough to find out. I think either would be fine for a skill build. just depends on which one you like to use more. I might be wrong though since I've pretty much stuck to the saw cleaver and strength. I think Old Yharnam is the only way you can go at that point in the game. check to see if you can buy a key to open a gate in the hunters dream. The key might not become available until you beat a certain boss in old yharnam first. If it is buy it and head out the left door of the cathedral ward then keep right and up the stairs past the giant."

I got to see almost all museum (which are free) went to all big parks and a lot of small gardens spread around the city. And all the narkets.  So i plan to go to the science museum again and to the natural history too. I couldn't go to another one last year because it was under renovations. I'll go to that one too.

That's perhaps the ""bad path"".    In order to get her story line into the ""good path"", find her near the old woman house, a hidden window on the right side just before you enter the Dry Dock area in central yharnam. If you miss her there, you can find her later outside the Oden chapel. Note that this must be done before you enter the forbidden woods! After you meet her and open the two big gates in the cathedral ward area , talk to her again and she'll warn you about old hunter Henrik. Help her defeating Henrik will put you on the good path. Later, when the blood moon is out, you can find her outside the grand cathedral. Talk to her and defeat the chikage hunter inside the cathedral. Talk to her again, you can complete her quest line."

I'm sure you'll notice the Isz dungeon uses a lot of the same assets and statues and imagery as the Pthumerian dungeons.  The dungeons were not ""people's attempts to contact the Great Ones"", I'm not sure where that idea comes from. They were labyrinths built to worship and contain them by a completely separate race before the timeline of the story.  You are correct in that those who built Isz managed to reach a higher plane of sorts though, and it IS more noticeably catered to Kin even though it's possible to get Beast bosses in it through root dungeons"

bloodborne,3drqle,Alken0,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:22:19 2015 UTC,"On the most basic level:  Overview  There's a bunch of optional, roguelike dungeons in the game. They are made up of levels, with a boss at the end of each level. Beating the boss is, of course, necessary to progress to the next level. These dungeons contain lots of great items, weapons, fights, gems, and are necessary for several trophies. Most notably among those are two gold trophies, one for acquiring all weapons, and one for beating the boss in the last layer of the most difficult to reach dungeon. When going for platinum, you have to play through almost all of the chalice dungeons.  Story   While not heavy on narrative and completely devoid of notes or NPCs, these dungeons actually tie into the lore and story, as they explain 'how it all began'. The trophy boss at the end is also unique to the Chalice Dungeons, and very important for the lore.  How to CD  You cannot access all dungeons from the get-go. To access a chalice dungeon, you need * that dungeon's respective Chalice * Materials * A 'free grave' in the Hunter's Dream  The first few Chalices are aquired by besting optional story bosses in the game such as BSB or Ebrietas. Most other chalices are acquired by progressing through these dungeons. This means that the only way to reach the deepest is to play through the others first. Materials are acquired in chests in the dungeons, from boss drops in the dungeons, and can later be purchased from the messengers. Some of them are very rare and require you to loot dungeons carefully before you can proceed to the next one, even if you have the Chalice.   Navigation   Most chalice dungeons follow a predictable pattern: Find and fighht your way to the SWITCH that opens the door to the boss area, then fight the boss. There are usually two branching paths, one before the switch and one after the switch, where you don't HAVE to go, but need to go if you want to find all goodies and materials.   The standard dungeons look the same for every player. Same layout, same loot. But for each major dungeon, you can and will find 'root' chalices, with which you can create randomly generated versions of these dungeons - with different (often better) loot. There are also things like 'sinister chalices' and 'defiled chalices'. They alter some parameters of the fights, making your life harder.   Multiplayer  The multiplayer aspects are the most confusing with the chalice dungeons. Dungeons you create, root chalice dungeons included, are given what is called a glyph. These can be shared and, given that all player have the necessary chalices and/or have created the dungeons themselves at least once, explored together. You can also invite people to your regular dungeons with password matching, or you can use the Short Ritual Root Chalice (which you will acquire at some point) to quick search a co op dungeon, or browse popular dungeons. It's all pretty weird and you should just tinker with it.  When to CD  It is advisable to start dungeoning as soon as you can. The first chalice dungeon should be easy enough, the most difficult dungeons are recommended for lvl 100+ players. Chalice Dungeon progress carries over to NG+ so you can do them whenever you like, but the process can become tedious, so spread it out over your playthrough.  On the wiki, you can find charts and lists which materials are required for which dungeon and where to get them.   Enjoy, and may the good blood guide your way."

bloodborne,3dpjm4,FurtiveCutless,2,Sat Jul 18 05:35:04 2015 UTC,"Not a problem if you're dealing a ton of damage (which if you're using chikage 2-handed you've probably spec'd bloodtinge and should be dealing quite a bit) and have plenty of blood vials. Plus at 50 vitality with metamorphosis runes it's barely a loss. The regular attacks do plenty of damage as well if the health drain does become an issue, and while they may not be the best against another hunter (that's when I use the heavy attack) they will tear a larger boss to shreds."
bloodborne,3dpjm4,Kayar13,2,Sat Jul 18 05:44:50 2015 UTC,50 vitality and 50 bloodtinge breaks the game. My friend is one of those guys and he killed Rom with only an ashless Evelyn. I was having trouble with defiled Amygdala so he comes in. I get her to the final phase (where I always fucking died) and he speeds it up by charge attacking her with the Chikage.

Maybe NG and Depth 3 chalices are easier, but the Chikage and Evelyn don't hold up in even NG+ without some massive gems. As even NG+ has been beaten by a level 4 WoS the Chikage undeniably could be used in it, but literally the Threaded Cane at +6 has more viability in the game than a +10 Chikage.   Edit: I'm not bigoted in my stance, if you want to prove me wrong I'd be happy, as despite sucking the Chikage is cool."
bloodborne,3dpjm4,BorneByTheBlood,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:37:29 2015 UTC,I think the main thing that makes the Chikage so good is that the Lost Chikage has a slot for a bloodtinge gem. It's pretty easy to farm up ones that have +30% bloodtinge scaling so when you have 50 tinge shit starts getting ridiculous. I will agree that you have to farm up the really good gems from the max depth chalices but once you have those the game is pretty broken even in NG+. I don't have any footage but I've seen first hand how it can decimate enemies.
bloodborne,3dpjm4,TheRecherche,2,Sun Jul 19 01:17:35 2015 UTC,"NG+3/4/5 I can't remember anymore after so much time spent, my Lost Chikage is +8, about to be +9,  with Blood Attack: 164 +469(@+9 509) with gems being +25.3%/+26.3%/+31.5% (-Kin damage). It will 2-3Shot enemies in Central Yharnam, many more in other area in comparison to BB it does 200 (R2 charge) less damage and 500 less than Ludwig (and the Chikage has over 19% bonus in gem power than them), given its R2 speed is equal to the Stake a Driver (it seems) it is very weak. However I do believe the Chikage will match my BB since its +10 vs Chikage+8 only dealing 200 damage difference. For R1 Spam BB wins by 60 points, Chikage second, and Ludwig is lowest, whilst Chikage loses L2 vs anything other than kin.      I love the Chikages concept, blood blade, and move set (albeit simple it is deadly effective). I dislike its damage compared to its hp costs... If we could get 2 utility gems added to sidearms (ie a new category for gems affecting things like +QS Max/Gain bullets if kill shot is with gun) and thusly could receive between 10-15 healing per second the Chikage would be amazing.   Off topic, Boy I'd love to see hunters torch get some special gems in the future, or maybe an upgrade path option that removes its damage to make it brighter, that make it burn wider/brighter/etc...

bloodborne,3dpjm4,Blackdeath_663,3,Sat Jul 18 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"Its transformed attacks have massive range both horizontally and vertically, its transformed state counts as a serrated weapon for bonus damage against beasts, it has no innate enchanting on it so it's buffable with any damage type, and its attacks have a fraction of the stamina cost of LHB or the rifle spear. I took down the Lower Loran Darkbeast Parl last night after maybe 15 tries, using everything from a +10 BoM, +8 Lost Burial Blade, +8 LHB, to a +8 Hunters Axe.

Logarius' wheel and Chikage are not bad and will never be bad for a very good, lorewise reason. When a cancer is discovered, one must pinpoint it's location, reach in, and wrench it from the host's bosom.   The problem, however, is that killing cancer is not difficult at all. The hard part is killing the cancer without killing the patient. Therefore, cancer treatment is all about slowly killing the host hoping the cancer dies first. Sound familiar? The chikage and the Wheel are therefore Yharnams oncology. You use them in a suicidal rage to massacre your enemies whilst holding the hope they'll die before you do.   Wielding the Wheel and the Chikage, you become the cytostatic hunter. The Chemotheraputic monster. And by Wheeling blunt and Chikagic thrust, the cancer of Yharnam will be cleansed."

bloodborne,3dprcy,Fartmagizewarth342,11,Sat Jul 18 06:50:02 2015 UTC,"Church Giants are servants of the Healing Church in Yharnam. Since the Church is responsible for the treatment of the scourge plague, they send these large servants to hunt the citizens who have been infected with the disease. It is said that, when the inhabitants of Yharnam hear a ringing bell, they close their doors and stay within. The giants serves to alarm those who are not beast to hide in their homes since the beasts will soon roam free, hence the bell they carry. We know Martyr Logarius was with the healing church and led his executioners into castle cainhurst, but since we don't see any of these big fellas in cainhurst my guess is that they aren't executioners of the church but maybe more a, as said, warning to the sane people and as remedy for the beasts looming large, that is to say ridding the streets of beasts to keep the church safe. As for your take on them possibly being former hunters i'd say no. They are with the church yes and their attire matches well with this, but former hunter no."

In the arms race the Church found themselves in, it would've made sense for them to ''enhance their weapons and flesh'' or at least that of their enforcers.

You even find the crawly ones in the village in the forbidden woods (and some walking ones in the cave to the back entrance of Central Yharnam) which hints that these big guys were recruited from the ranks average citizens of Yharnam."

bloodborne,3dnzty,nosewings,5,Fri Jul 17 21:03:55 2015 UTC,What other nordic influences are there?
bloodborne,3dnzty,DragonKingofArmes,12,Fri Jul 17 22:36:52 2015 UTC,"Well, for starters, the names.  Gehrman, Willem, Ludwig, and Alfred are all Germanic names.  Byrgenwerth is a made-up name, but it is obviously supposed to sound Germanic.  The Kirkhammer gets its name from the German word kirk, meaning ""church"".  The name ""Oedon"" sounds nearly identical to ""Odin"", the name of one of the primary gods in Germanic mythology. (Incidentally, the Oedon chapel dweller's pronunciation sounds like ""Ödin"", with an umlaut.)  These are all little things, but they add up to a pattern. There are some deeper potential connections, little details that other people have noticed. The biggest thing for me, though, is the fact that beasts and hunts play a pretty significant role in Nordic legends. I have some doubts that it goes any deeper (though I am interested in the Yr rune: ᛦ), but I'm certain it goes at least that deep."
bloodborne,3dnzty,nosewings,7,Sat Jul 18 04:48:21 2015 UTC,"The Kirkhammer gets its name from the German word kirk, meaning ""church"".   Church in German is actually Kirche.  However, kirk is a Scottish word for church."
bloodborne,3dnzty,Kafkas_Hat,8,Sat Jul 18 05:32:16 2015 UTC,"Oedon is actually a reference to oedipism, given how prevalent eyes are in the game's lore."
bloodborne,3dnzty,wunderloz,12,Sat Jul 18 05:53:11 2015 UTC,"There can be multiple influences. Odin is frequently depicted with only one eye. According to one legend, he plucked it out in order to attain knowledge."
bloodborne,3dnzty,nosewings,-14,Sat Jul 18 06:00:16 2015 UTC,"The tale of Oedipus predates Norse mythology. Oedon and Odin share no similarities. It ""sounds nearly identical"" is an insubstantial claim."
bloodborne,3dnzty,wunderloz,3,Sat Jul 18 06:41:43 2015 UTC,"The tale of Oedipus predates Norse mythology.   . . . And the Epic of Gilgamesh predates Oedipus Rex.  I don't understand why this matters.   Oedon and Odin share no similarities.   Except for the aforementioned fact that they both traditionally gouged out at least one eye. Oedipus did so because he learned the truth; Odin did so in order to learn the truth.  And anyway, so what? Multiple influences don't have to share anything in common. Bloodborne draws from a bunch of sources with no direct connections to each other: Lovecraft, Berserk, Tarot, Dracula, Gothic horror in general, Nordic mythology, Metal Gear Solid 3 . . .   It ""sounds nearly identical"" is an insubstantial claim.   ""O-d-n"" is at least as substantial a connection as ""Oe..."".    Also, Odin is a god.    I'm not trying to de-legitimize your contribution. It's just that different ideas don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive.  Like, people have noted that the Hunter's Mark looks similar to a recurring symbol in Berserk. Given that Miyazaki has actually cited Berserk as an influence, that's reasonable. But there's also an implied connection with the Hanged Man from Tarot. The Hunter's Mark also shows up as weapons wielded by the guys in front of Vicar Amelia, and on the Tau crosses that we see beasts hanged on.  So yeah, lots of different influences and thematic implications tied up in one element."
bloodborne,3dnzty,nosewings,2,Sat Jul 18 10:46:14 2015 UTC,"""O-d-n"" is at least as substantial a connection as ""Oe..."".   what? ""Oe"" is the Greek ""Οι"" as of ""Οἰδίπους"" = ""Oedipus""  how does connect grammatically with Odin or ""Óðinn""?"
bloodborne,3dnzty,Beerdrinkers,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:22:50 2015 UTC,"It doesn't.  The point is that ""Oedon"" is similar to ""Oedipus"" in that it starts with ""Oe"", but it's also similar to ""Odin"" in that it goes ""O-d-n"", with the same number of syllables. The second similarity is at least as strong as the first. And it's entirely possible for both of them to be relevant."

bloodborne,3dnzty,nosewings,2,Sat Jul 18 04:21:44 2015 UTC,The Nordic connection comes from the story of Odin plucking his eye and hanging upside down from Yggdrasil. DXimenes links to the proper thread.

bloodborne,3dn3y4,sadguitarsolo,4,Fri Jul 17 17:06:10 2015 UTC,Be warned. All other games will suck after playing all of FROM SOFTWARE's games. It's a curse.
bloodborne,3dn3y4,atheer87,2,Fri Jul 17 22:06:36 2015 UTC,"so true, but surprisingly the only games I find good enough to play nowadays are idie games i download from steam like bastion, bleed, valdis story; the combat in these game is more complex than games like the witcher 3."

But interesting opinion since from what I've seen dark souls 2 is the least popular of the From games because of the different director and I guess it's different fundamentally.  Idk I've only played bloodborne and it's all I need.

Also you should know that if someone says they are born in Washington, they were probably born in Washington.  And regardless, it's pretty ballsy to tell a veteran ""IF THEY WERE IN"".

No harm! :)   Also I did some research (lol) and you CAN join enlisted (AF) if you're not a citizen, but green card is required, and citizenship required to re-enlist.  And enjoy stealing our food from the D-fac's :D My dad said the best part about the army base (he was in the army) was that he could walk to the Air Force d-fac on base and eat their food!"
bloodborne,3dn3y4,MilkManEX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"It plays better, which is why opinions conflict so much about the game. DaS1 did level design, lore, and atmosphere better, but DaS2 improved the game mechanically and added a ton of build variety. For people that don't really care about anything but gameplay, DaS2 is generally their preferred game. For those that dig immersion/mystery/lore, DaS1 is hard to beat."

You get access to messages from other players about what to maybe look out for coming up, leave messages for others as well, you can see how others have died to maybe warn you of something ahead, also you can summon help for difficult boss fights and allow yourself to be summoned to help others with the same."
bloodborne,3dn3y4,PremiumGoose,5,Fri Jul 17 17:28:08 2015 UTC,That and nothing better than having your note rated fine giving you health you direly need that exact second because you're about to be chopped into pieces :)
bloodborne,3dn3y4,dogger6253,2,Fri Jul 17 18:09:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely saved my ass a couple of times, though this past week I've been getting those messages right after leaving the hub and not much after I've gone into deeper areas.    I couldn't find it, but there was an awesome gif I think I saw here of someone getting ""your message was rated fine"" right after ""You Died."" I thought that was the funniest shit."

bloodborne,3dn3y4,PressXToArclight,2,Fri Jul 17 21:16:32 2015 UTC,Don't ring your beckoning or sinister bells and the only areas you can get invaded are Nightmare Frontier and Mensis.
bloodborne,3dn3y4,dogger6253,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:19:00 2015 UTC,"Only if you ring your bell can you be invaded. There are times though, when a woman is ringing the bell in an area and you have to kill her to make it stop."

Any ideas?"
bloodborne,3dn3y4,dogger6253,2,Fri Jul 17 23:42:19 2015 UTC,Those are the two spots in the main game that have the women. Find her and kill her when you load into those areas. Some chalice dungeons have that too but works a little differently.
bloodborne,3dn3y4,BorneByTheBlood,2,Fri Jul 17 23:50:48 2015 UTC,"Exact rought text tut.     Frontier: Go from the cave directly left. Cross the bridge where two hunters are. Go down to the swamp and hug the right wall. A cave almost immediately after hugging right for 1second will be clearly visible to kill that woman.    THERE ARE NO THREATS from quickly dashing right so don't be worried about death/ambush.        Mensis: Go straight and then left. Rush to the doors, near impossible to miss, ignore all mobs on the way. In a room after the door will be a fuck ton of spiders, just go right and none will detect you. Immediately after ascending the stairs go right again. Kill her.       Problems solved."
bloodborne,3dn3y4,Sootraggins,3,Sat Jul 18 18:51:08 2015 UTC,"Play online, it doesn't change much of anything for the bad, it only adds to the experience. You may want to turn it off when you hit the Nightmare Frontier if you start having trouble initially."

bloodborne,3dn3y4,Duckyfs,2,Fri Jul 17 17:57:13 2015 UTC,"While online you can see notes people left, and you can see where they died. It's still a solo experience, but it just adds fun stuff. But if you haven't played the other Souls games you aren't missing much, and this game has the least use I think for that stuff. Also, the bell maidens summon other players if you're online in the Nightmare Frontier, so until you kill the maiden it's really annoying."

If it was way too hard to get to a really hard boss it might be frustrating but they always give you a shortcut. Fair but hard, that's what makes these games great. Sure they throw you a curve ball but once you know it's coming you can avoid it. Other games are either easy or unfair because it's just easier to develop that way."
bloodborne,3dn3y4,Ookami82,2,Fri Jul 17 20:51:53 2015 UTC,"Play Dark Souls 1. I never played 2, but DaS1 is what got me absolutely hooked on this style of game. Problem is, the only people that are capable making something as good as DaS1 are From Software, and bloodborne is the realization of that. I absolutely love bloodborne; it is definitely one of my top five games of all time. But DaS1 is absolutely my number one. Give it a shot."
bloodborne,3dn3y4,imatschoolandimbored,2,Fri Jul 17 17:14:53 2015 UTC,Try dark souls 2 sin edition i was much like u and enjoyed both. But know ds2 holds your hand even less. Dying is more of a punishment and there will be hard time when you want to give up.
bloodborne,3dn3y4,gimpyjosh,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think online play gives you a better all around experience because you can see notes, which can be helpful (also can be very confusing at times). Seeing the ""ghosts"" can be comforting, at least for me because it's like other people are going through the same thing as me!  Pvp isn't an issue until you get to pvp areas but it can be fun/exciting to try your hand against another real player, or you can kill the ones causing the pvp (which is permanent btw) once you get there you'll know what I mean.  I've heard that Bloodborne is the shortest one of them all too. I can definitely confirm this for Dark Souls II which is the only other one I've played so far and I highly recommend it. So there is much to explore with the souls games, enjoy!"

IMO it enhances the experience drastically, especially the notes left by other players.  Some are funny, some are life savers on your first/second Play through.    None of these things make the game any more difficult, IMO.  You could say it makes it a little easier with co-op.  Invasions aren't annoying, IMO."

bloodborne,3dn3y4,not24,7,Sat Jul 18 00:55:11 2015 UTC,"If it's completely frustrating you, a tip I can give you is to Just run past the wolves, take a left and go inside the door. The wolves are too big to fit in the door. You'll have to fight some normal guys but if you can survive, you can open a shortcut back to the start. Once you've opened the shortcut, go back to the bridge towards the ogre and the birds, go past them and you're at an optional boss. The optional boss will give you an insight just for finding him, so even if you die the doll will come alive in the hunter's dream and let you level up. Then you can spend some time killing dudes and getting some blood echos to get stronger Otherwise, here's a video of a guy killing the wolves and opening the shortcut, so you can die and still keep the progress https://youtu.be/4-1Ga8WfFDI?t=391"

bloodborne,3dq5kw,Geo_Froboz,3,Sat Jul 18 16:53:09 2015 UTC,I just did it. I ran past Djura and killed BSB. Killed Paarl and went to Djura through that gate without him seeing me.

bloodborne,3dptj5,OOpiumBear,2,Sat Jul 18 07:28:40 2015 UTC,Interesting theory. I'll have to look into this.  Although I'm still kind of doubtful because Imposter Iosefka does ONLY drop the Umbilical Cord after the Blood Moon appears.
bloodborne,3dptj5,OOpiumBear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:06:24 2015 UTC,"In total we change moon cycle twice. You need the chance to kill her before and after pregnancy and she can't be met prior to the first cycle change. So they'd (From) have to make her pregnancy happen after the red moon appears. As to lore it might require the blood moon for her ritual/experiments to come full. Also their pregnancies doesn't seem similar in any way, Arianna is sick and naseous whilst Imposter Iosefka seems more or less aroused. Bear in mind that prior to the blood moon she is still experimenting so of course you can't get the cord prior to the moon!"

I have a gazillion times more respect for From than I do for Blizzard, but I honestly have no idea why they decided that Diablo-style dungeon crawling was what the Souls games needed."
bloodborne,3dprur,nosewings,2,Sat Jul 18 11:59:51 2015 UTC,"i really like the chalice dungeons, they're my favorite part of the game and the main thing i do.  the first 3 layers will be a slog if you're lvl 100 or so though so if you want to try them all you might want to also try a new build at the same time.  they will power you the fuck up big time btw and also frustrate you endlessly.  it's the most difficult and most rewarding content in the game so i highly recommend at least trying it out.  and i think D3 isn't really a good comparison.  D3 is kind of relaxing honestly.  chalice dungeons are more in the vein of like wizardry or other japanese DPRGs - intense, constant combat in sprawling, convoluted maps.  traps, illusory walls, randomized everything.  much closer in feel and execution to DeS than the main game is, grind and lopsided difficulty included.  a lot of the monsters (and some bosses) in the chalice dungeons are unique as well.  but there are also both beast and kin-specific dungeons, which makes kinhunters, beasthunters and elemental gem varieties a lot more useful than they are just going through NG cycles.  idk you will see just check em out"
bloodborne,3dprur,GothMAXMP,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:29:49 2015 UTC,Personally I love the chalice dungeons. Once you get up to the depth 5 dungeons and use the curse that halfs your hp. It really makes it difficult to complete and a lot of fun.

FROM doesn't see any of that money. The PS+ goes entirely towards Sony, and honestly if you're paying for PS+ and not getting the free games or playing other things or using the extra sale prices (which yes is generally only like 10% more), there's no real right to complain about it. While I agree a subscription for multiplayer is stupid, it's not a subscription for multiplayer to one game, and that's not all you get out of it."

bloodborne,3dpytg,Abyss_walking,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:46:43 2015 UTC,"because SONY is making you pay for online and not FROM?

bloodborne,3dpytg,Abyss_walking,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:05:33 2015 UTC,Do you understsnd that without dedicated server the cost of BB multiplayer is minimal? It's all based upon player's infrastructure...

bloodborne,3dpytg,Pkrhett,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:03:54 2015 UTC,"xbox had been forcing a subscription for years. playstation doesn't even force you, only some features are not available without Ps+, they give you 2 free games EVERY month for EVERY system. if you haven't played rocket league yet, you are missing out on some PS+ goodness.  i can tell the difference in my download and upload with PS+, it's like Sony gives as much of a boost to PS+ members as they can. so if you are experiencing copious amounts of lag, it is most likely on your end, or you are getting bad hosts, but the BB connect is very solid compared to previous DS.  here's a great video showing how the ""lag"" really works https://youtu.be/dTMwkk8r6D0"
bloodborne,3dpytg,Pkrhett,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:09:50 2015 UTC,"See, I don't care about other games, I just want to play online BB. Now Sony forces me to pay a substantial fee to just play online, at least give me a decent service. As simple as that..."
bloodborne,3dpytg,vladimusdacuul,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:16:26 2015 UTC,"service is great in my opinion. you really can't tell because you are playing a game that is not online focused. a game that is meant to play online as the main feature is going to have dedicated servers that are fantastic. if you played any of the F2P games, destiny, Rocket league, (COD/BF... lol) that are online focused and you were experiencing lag it would be a different story.  FROM never has and probably never will create dedicated servers, so BB is not really showing you as big a diff PS+ makes. At least Sony has and continues to deliver great deals and free games to PS+, you could have an xbox and just now be getting 1 free game while paying more than PS."

bloodborne,3dpytg,iLawz,0,Sat Jul 18 21:50:14 2015 UTC,Probably because the cost of PSN Comes nowhere near close enough to cover every game with online capabilities to have dedicated servers.  Or are you suggesting that Sony treat BB players special with dedicated servers? Because that is lunacy. Every other fanboy of every other online game would flip their shit that Sony is treating 1 title better.
bloodborne,3dpc8o,Kingmudcrab,3,Sat Jul 18 03:56:14 2015 UTC,I believe the stat screen shows the attack rating (not necessarily the damage) associated with the form in which you are currently carrying it. At 13 bloodtinge you probably shouldn't be playing with the chikage.
bloodborne,3dpc8o,Fender19,3,Sat Jul 18 04:00:09 2015 UTC,"Especially not with a char specced in skill and str, the 1H mode at this point deals way more damage than the 2H and has no debuff making the transformed state useless for a long time."
bloodborne,3dpc8o,OOpiumBear,2,Sat Jul 18 04:04:39 2015 UTC,So I should probably leave it for a different play through then?
bloodborne,3dpc8o,OOpiumBear,3,Sat Jul 18 04:15:49 2015 UTC,If you want it to shine through early on and in PvP then yes. But if you plan on never stop leveling your current char then no neccesarily but right now other weapons will deal more damage.
bloodborne,3dpc8o,Fender19,2,Sat Jul 18 04:19:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm just going to leave it for another char...Thanks for the info!
bloodborne,3dpc8o,OOpiumBear,2,Sat Jul 18 04:21:07 2015 UTC,Would you recommend leveling up bloodtinge more or just leave it for a different play through?
bloodborne,3dpc8o,alisonnrs,3,Sat Jul 18 04:04:28 2015 UTC,"Umm it depends what level you are currently and how long you want your playthrough to go on. If you're stoked about the chikage you could definitely just go after it now, but if you're liking another weapon and you want to continue your forward progress I would recommend sticking with your current setup.  For perspective, my first character was a quality build so I simply chose to stick with that to make ludwig's holy blade the best it could be. Once I got to 25str/50skill I decided I might as well start doing bloodtinge, because 25 more str would be overkill, and I wasn't going to be PvP'ing so the level cap wasn't a concern."
bloodborne,3dp9vu,atheer87,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:32:17 2015 UTC,"The attack rating is not equivalent to damage. It's part of a damage function that is always applied to the weapon. The extended version doesn't  increase attack rating, and the short form doesn't decrease it.  Basically, the formula relies on a few different factors. Attack rating is one of them, and that interacts with the enemy defense value. Some function of those two variables is multiplied by a modifier associated with each different move the weapon has. extended form attacks tend to have higher modifiers. A hunter's axe r1 with the same attack rating as a ludwig's holy blade r1 could still do a very different amount of damage because of those modifiers."
bloodborne,3dp9vu,Fender19,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:47:38 2015 UTC,"thank you so much, i didn't realise there was a complex formula behind it. You explained it very well and i understand the concept of attack rating now, but what apart from weapon transformation modifies damage, in other words, can you give me an example of how your last sentence can be true? if the two weapons have identical attack ratings and are both in transformed mode how can they have different damage assuming all other obvious things are equal such as (buffs, enemy type, counter hit..etc)"
bloodborne,3dp9vu,Fender19,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:05:03 2015 UTC,"No problem! OK so let's take two different weapons: ludwig's holy blade and the hunter's axe. Let's consider the normal mode for convenience. Both the sword and the axe r1 do slash damage, so that's the same. Let's pretend that somebody did some stat finagling, and ensured that they have the same attack rating. Well, there's another modifier there that's designed to help account for the relative amount of force behind the attack. The equation would look something like this: (attack rating-defense rating)*move modifier= damage  The actual equation is more complicated than that, but basically the move modifier is how one weapon, with one attack rating, can have 5 different attacks. 1hr1, 1hr2, 2hr1, 2hr2, transform attacks and 2hL2 all have different move modifiers. Ludwig's overhead slash does more damage than the horizontal slash, despite both being blunt damage."
bloodborne,3dp9vu,PlasmicOcean,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:26:35 2015 UTC,"Five's supposed to be an example, right? Because weapons have way more than 5 attacks. Also a question I'm curious about, if you happen to know the answer, do you individual attacks in combos each have their own damage modifiers? It seems like they must I would think, even if they're very similar most of the time. An good example of this is the Blade of Mercy's 2-handed R1 combo, in which certain hits later in the combo seem to do way more damage than others."
bloodborne,3dp9vu,Fender19,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:27:39 2015 UTC,"Um, actually it's just that i forgot to count jump attacks, running attacks, rolling attacks and all that. lol. But yeah, it's not the total number that's relevant, just the basic function. I believe the follow up strikes can have different modifiers."
bloodborne,3dp9vu,PlasmicOcean,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:11:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fair enough I was just kind a curious (and a bit nitpick), especially since you listed 6 different types of attacks."
bloodborne,3dp9vu,OOpiumBear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:03:09 2015 UTC,"To add to this. You can check out the wiki pages for the weapons to see full list of weapon attacks and combos, how much STA they use, what their modifiers are and i believe also which type of attack that particular attack is (blunt/thrust/regular phys/other)"

This allows for some amazing trapping/timing opportunities. The full charge is easier to pull off on a delayed backstep/running attack than a complete stand still, and the fact that it almost always one hit-KO's is totally worth the risk.

bloodborne,3dphdz,WolferGrowl,0,Sat Jul 18 08:23:23 2015 UTC,"alright this is sort of a subject of contention.  i personally believe that the lost version of any weapon is ALWAYS the best, because it allows for the most interesting combinations, and it also makes it so that none of the 3 main chalice dungeons are useless for you to run (although that may actually be preferable to some players).    any of them will suffice though.  triangle gems are generally the best for physical builds like strength, so the default is great."
bloodborne,3dphdz,GothMAXMP,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:10:36 2015 UTC,This is categorically false. Any pure physical damage weapon will be best with two radials and one triangle.   Waning gems don't come in 27.2% potency (other than super rare off type drops) so a pure physical weapon with a waning slot will be significantly harder to optimize.
bloodborne,3dphdz,WolferGrowl,0,Sun Jul 19 10:44:59 2015 UTC,"like i said, if you are a hardcore min-maxer and that's all you're interested in then the triangle are generally best for strength (and physical damage in general as you pointed out, but OP was specifically talking str build).  it is not ""categorically false"" though lol  my argument is simply that lost versions allow for more interesting combinations and they make it so none of the 3 chalice dungeons are worthless for you to run.  they may not be the most optimal but they will usually at least be a little more unique.  the difference in AR is like completely negligible anyways considering you are hedging bets on getting some fairly rare drops in the first place."
bloodborne,3dphdz,GothMAXMP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:01:10 2015 UTC,You said Lost versions are ALWAYS the best.   This is not true.

bloodborne,3dpdtg,nosewings,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:20:37 2015 UTC,Quoth Wikipedia:   A charnel house is a vault or building where human skeletal remains are stored. They are often built near churches for depositing bones that are unearthed while digging graves. The term can also be used more generally as a description of a place filled with death and destruction.   My favorite lore explanation for Hemwick is that they're providing supplies for the Mensis ritual.

The controls resonated with me especially as I played the hell out of DMC 1 and DMC 3 before I played Ninja Gaiden and it just felt familiar. Dark Souls was so agonizingly slow and the controls felt unresponsive as there is a delay between when you press a button and the thing you wanted happens. It wasn't until I got used to the delay and movement that it became easy. It's one of the reasons I find Blodborne so easy because the speed and responsiveness is in a similar vein as those games."

You're right, maybe she was trying to get the Lunarium key, but I'd assume more to get to Rom than Willem. Perhaps he knew what they would do and since you stopped her, he pointed Rom out to you."

It's only because of her pregnancy after Rom that even makes me think this could be false, but even then in Yharnam it might just make sense.

Resistance in this game is pretty much irrelevant. You're going to benefit more from stamina to throw out longer combos or additional bullets/vials, or regaining health from visceral attacks."

bloodborne,3domx0,OOpiumBear,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:12:26 2015 UTC,"I like to roll with HP, Stamina, and extra blood vials personally. The extra HP adds more survivability than the resistance runes can. I use blood vials because I like to explore a full dungeon and not worry about having enough vials for the boss at the end."
bloodborne,3domx0,Volenska,2,Sat Jul 18 00:47:10 2015 UTC,"When you equip %res runes you will see how your stats increase. For every 10 you got in every individual stat you gain 1% migitation. I tested it out a while ago and it does not in fact give you the equivalent to 5% migitation all over but more around 3-4.5% depending on which resistance you looked at. Furthermore it seemed to increase by lower amounts the higher your stat were. Is health better? That can be argued but it really depends on your VIT level. The more VIT the more you get from your %hp runes. Say if you have 1000 hp and a monster deals 1000 dmg you die. with ~5% migitation the monster will deal 950 and you are left with 50. (Actually less since its not entirely 5%) If you equip 5% hp instead you get 1050 hp and are left with 50 hp. Does this mean they are equally good? Yes and no good sir. The hp rune scales with:     Vitality which increases by pretty much per stat increase. Higher numbers means percentages gives more.    The % res rune scales with:     Attire and stats which increase resistances   The amount of damage the monster deals (More damage means more migitation from the hit)     Its all up to circumstance but overall, since the hp runes comes in variants of 10% and 15% they dominate by far. In the 5% v 5% matchup i'd still go for hp since the res rune doesnt entirely give you 5% migitation, granted that you have at least 1000 hp.    And please, correct me if im wrong anywhere here! I'd hate to give false information, currently im just talking from my perspective, my knowledge and my tests :) EDIT: I can never make those fucking stars work on reddit! :("

bloodborne,3diilk,MezzaCorux,23,Fri Jul 17 00:48:24 2015 UTC,"Paarl was easy for me, after I figured something out.   First fight he slaughtered me, and I realized that I was trying to play keep away because Paarl is freaking scary. So I decided maybe that was the idea the devs had: scare you so you fight from a distance. So instead, I started treating him like the first boss (the giant) in Dark Souls 2: get right up in his face and keep dashing through his attacks. Sweep right underneath his legs to get behind him and you can get some pretty easy pot shots.   After I did this, he was a cake walk. Everytime I got behind him, I'd get a few pot shots in, he'd fall to the ground and lose his electrical charge. This would give me an opportunity to wail on him.  The fight completely changed after that. I have my gameplay video on youtube for this boss fight if anyone is interested. About 60 seconds into the fight I made this realization and changed tactics, and you can definitely see how the tables turned right then and there."
bloodborne,3diilk,BusyBurningBridges,12,Thu Jul 16 17:41:42 2015 UTC,I had a rule after the first couple of bosses. Stay close to beasts because they're easier to dodge and keep your distance with humanoids.
bloodborne,3diilk,CrystlBluePersuasion,11,Thu Jul 16 18:30:18 2015 UTC,One could argue that this fits right in with the story. The people of Yharnam are much closer to beast than human.

bloodborne,3diilk,t765234,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:56:27 2015 UTC,This. I found BSB especially easy even though many said he was extremely difficult (Rockleesmile had like a 5 hour stream of him trying over and over again to beat it). I co-oped BSB like 100 times one night. It was so much fun. Many of those fights I didn't get hit once. I just kept strafing behind it and then swinging wildly with the small Holy Blade. That was the most fun I had with the game.
bloodborne,3diilk,ashesarise,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:49:27 2015 UTC,"I've found that you can pretty much just constantly visceral attack him if you circle strafe, makes the fight way too easy on a dex char."

I've never died more than twice to a souls boss before, but after him I decided that I really didn't like Bloodborne all that much compared to DS1. My big problem was that the framerate gave me motion sickness sometimes, and all the speedy movement made it worse. Dark Souls 1 is fine thanks. The lore is cool though so I'm still here for that.

bloodborne,3diilk,imatschoolandimbored,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"Funny commentary aside, I've felt best with Paarl when either attacking unlocked, or dodging through/under his front swipes and slams to hit his head when he drops it for some moves.  Or you can jump attack/use the beastly R2s of the Logarius Wheel, all the fucking time. Completely serious, that thing wrecks him."
bloodborne,3diilk,KatsuragiAi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:49:12 2015 UTC,"This is so appropriate for me, on new game+ and Darkbeast Paarl seems literally impossible. During my regular game he was pretty easy, get under him, knock him down, swing to death, no problem.   Now in new game plus he does his aoe every time I get under him immediately.  His swipes seem more effective, making it harder to get under him and when he doesn't use his aoe he moves or hops away quickly so it's very difficult to get under him and do a charge R2 with anything.   Not sure if it's purely because of new game+ or if they recently super charged him during a patch but holy shit he's way op, I'm considering playing the rest of the game and just leveling as much as I can and leave him for last."
bloodborne,3diilk,FLRSH,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:13 2015 UTC,"The strategy that works for me is dodging towards the beast, and keep rolling under it, and get 1-4 hits every time you do so (depending on your weapon attacking speed and stigma cost).   The best timing to stun-lock it is when it tries to use the deadly AOE attack. Since the AOE attack has a rather long animation, it's very easy to spot. If you are using a heavy weapon like Ludwig holy blade, just spam R1 on its leg, or an R2; if you are using a lighter weapon like the threaded cane, apply a fire paper and R2 will do the same thing (the beast is weak against fire).   After that, it will be stun-locked for a few seconds for free attacks. And it will lose its lightening buff! This actually create the opportunity for the next stun-lock: Wait for it to charge. The beast will try to re-charge itself with lightening, and just use the same stun-lock technique when it tries to do so.   The poor thing will never be able to charge again :P"
bloodborne,3diilk,Sven2774,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:46:49 2015 UTC,"In my experience, Paarl is quite the pushover. Just keep iframing under him, smack him hard with some weapon that has an overhead attack. All he's got is his AoE, and you can learn to iframe through it, or you can simply put on Henryk's attire and tank it."

If you pull the stick towards you while locked on, you do a quickstep instead (the same thing you do when pressing forward or sideward while locked on, just in another direction).

Both LHB and KH have unique post-transform attacks if you press R1 immediately after transforming.  IIRC it's in both modes, but very definitely when returning to sword (normal) from TF.  They're not like super good attacks or anything, they're just there.  I guess if  Bloodborne had actual factual netcode, they could be used as psych games if you did a lot of no-attack transforms and tried to bait someone into attacking as you switched modes.  In the current laggy environment, of course, the concept is pointless (pitiful, really).  The one thing I most wish From would address about its major game series (most definitely including Armoured Core) is NETCODE.  I really don't care if they write it themselves, or (somehow) graft in an external solution like GGPO (or whatever's available and best), as long as they get us something that feels like you're actually playing in sync with someone, rather than both of you trying to guess what's going to be happening .75 (or more) seconds in the future."

bloodborne,3dmk1c,Dreaming_Sky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:26:04 2015 UTC,"Armoured Core has always been about 3 good tuning passes from being a ridiculously good game, but its US/NA fandom is anemic by comparison to its JP fandom.  Big robot games just aren't really popular with the broad majority of the North American player base, sad as it is.  I was hoping to see a strong FPS like Titanfall reverse the case, but while Titanfall was good, it didn't get great long-term support and in any case had the (IMO) big structural issue of being MP only.  Games should have a strong SP component, IMO.  Big robots are slowly getting cooler outside of Japan.  I think maybe about the time From gets their netcode right, North America will be poised for the invasion of giant robots!  (Hey, I can hope...)"

bloodborne,3dlot8,OIP,2,Fri Jul 17 08:54:09 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that my game glitched out and I can't obtain them, but I've wondered for a while now if claws could help with this. I'm thinking you could put them in your offhand and switch when your beast pellet was about to run out then rebuff and switch back to your primary weapon. It's worth a test if anyone is capable of doing so."
bloodborne,3dlot8,x_stickman_x,2,Fri Jul 17 08:59:35 2015 UTC,"it takes a pretty long time to build up meter with claws, the L2 which builds decent meter uses a lot of stamina.  i would be very surprised if it was even close to faster than popping another pellet and building again with main weapon.  you can definitely use claws to save on pellets though, especially for rom when you can build a full bar on the face."
bloodborne,3dlot8,OIP,2,Fri Jul 17 09:03:30 2015 UTC,"I meant using it to retain your beast hood when the pellet wears off. You'd be on them for like 2 seconds while you ate another pellet. I've been wanting to test this for ages, but every time I pickup a pair of claws I just get some great one's wisdom."
bloodborne,3dlot8,23edsa,2,Fri Jul 17 09:06:52 2015 UTC,aah this makes sense.  i will try it out.  that sucks about the claws..

bloodborne,3dlot8,23edsa,2,Fri Jul 17 08:35:11 2015 UTC,"To add to this, you'll want to kill the ghost lady. You can find her by taking right path out of the first room. You should run past a summoning witch. She's in the next room. You'll need to kill her ~100 times to get an out of socket drop that can fit in your weapon. It's a lot easier than killing watchers imo. Ludwig's and 1h kirk get +50% damage on her. I think she's also weak to arcane if you have a set of flat gems."

bloodborne,3dmstm,Hellkite422,3,Fri Jul 17 15:23:28 2015 UTC,"1.) Can you respect your points like you could in DSII?   No   2.) I know they have an arcane skill and some spells but can you make a caster build in BB?   It's a good bit different from DS, but yes. I'd recommend trying this on your second playthrough. It's less  viable than most common builds, but it's still doable.    3.) How are the Skill based weapons for starting off?   Each weapon is viable. There's less variation in them, but you can use any weapon you find all the way through NG+7 and FRC chalices. Skill makes for a pretty cool build because your visceral (think riposte) damage scales the best with it. There's a dual dagger set, cane, rapier, rifle spear, saw spear, and the untransformed katana all scale well with skill I believe. Your best weapon though is parries."
bloodborne,3dmstm,x_stickman_x,2,Fri Jul 17 15:37:06 2015 UTC,It is really great to get some of this information before I just dive into it head first so thank you.  Would you recommend mixing up the story with runs through Chalice Dungeons as I level or just go back and take care of them after a certain point in the story?
bloodborne,3dmstm,XxTAKEDOWNxX,3,Fri Jul 17 15:59:34 2015 UTC,"I got bored running chalice dungeons non-stop because they can get repetitive and really hard in the 4 and 5 depth classifications. I saved all of the chalice dungeons until I beat the game and did them all in order (I was about level 100 when I started them, which made the first ones ridiculously easy and the loot would have served me better earlier in the game). I've heard people have more luck with them if they alternate the story and chalice dungeons. For example, do chalice dungeons right when you are able to and progress in them until it gets too difficult and then switch back to the main game. I didn't do it this way, but I've heard this is the least repetitive feeling way to do them if you plan on completing the chalice dungeons. I kinda wish I would have done this in retrospect. Happy Hunting!"
bloodborne,3dmstm,writers_block,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:41:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you, this seems like some solid advice and I believe I will be doing exactly that during my first couple of playthroughs.

bloodborne,3dmstm,x_stickman_x,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:56:38 2015 UTC,"If you're really in for the long haul, then the chalice dungeons will absolutely be in your best interest.  The earlier you do them, the more useful you'll find the drops to be."
bloodborne,3dmstm,x_stickman_x,2,Fri Jul 17 17:21:12 2015 UTC,I recommend hitting them up right at the end of your first playthrough.  Be warned that this is more like DS than DS2 in regards to NG+; it starts as soon as the final boss is dead.
bloodborne,3dmstm,JellyCream,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:16:18 2015 UTC,Sounds good to me. Do people usually just start NG+ right away or do they stick around for PvP? Has the co-op been better now that they did some things with the bells? I loved co-op in the last two souls games and I am hoping to pick that back up.

Learning/baiting move sets is super hard but extremely satisfying."
bloodborne,3dj1jh,GothMAXMP,3,Thu Jul 16 18:46:49 2015 UTC,yeah pretty much every enemy in the game has a variety of moves designed to punish you for trying to create space by backpedaling.  the only way to get good at any of it is to just keep playing tho so you are on the right track already!

bloodborne,3dj1jh,doubleamobes,2,Thu Jul 16 20:41:28 2015 UTC,"That victorious feeling is addicting.   So addicting, in fact, that you will reach a point where your blood will boil with frustration and STILL want to keep playing just so you can get that feeling again.   Also, everyone seems to have a different experience with bosses, with one boss being harder to some than others. The bane of my existence (so far) was Ebrietas.   My point is, GO FORTH AND CONQUER."
bloodborne,3dj1jh,x_stickman_x,2,Thu Jul 16 23:17:43 2015 UTC,"IMO, gascoigne was a pretty hard fight to throw at a new player. His axe reaches fairly far, he has a gun that he uses regardless of your distance from him, and he changes to a totally different form and moveset for the last phase, rendering all of the knowledge you gain in the first two phases useless. As a werewolf he has a very short punish window, and his attacks carry him away from you, frequently interfering with your ability to counter him. It's easy once you learn how to parry, and I guess that's the objective (maybe?), but it's way harder than any early game boss fight in a FROM game that I can think of."
bloodborne,3dj1jh,aceradmatt,2,Fri Jul 17 08:56:09 2015 UTC,"Good job, now onward.  The bosses get harder as you go along, but your skill level improves to meet it. Father G is probably the biggest spike in the game, where the boss is much much harder that you as a player are prepared for. Now you know how to overcome the challenge, you in a much better position to take on the rest of those assholes (and believe me, there are plenty of frustrating bastards in your future)."

Are we* absolutely 100% without a doubt sure that the Yharnam Stone does bupkis?

bloodborne,3di0fh,dmcredgrave,6,Thu Jul 16 15:42:35 2015 UTC,"Doesn't do a thing, unfortunately.  Though I have no doubt that it, along with the Ring of Betrothal, will be important in the coming DLC.  The Yharnam Stone will probably be used as a level gate to a new area, meaning that the game will scale the difficulty appropriately by making sure that you can't access an area unless you were strong enough to beat Yharnam."
bloodborne,3di0fh,BorneByTheBlood,3,Thu Jul 16 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"The Ring of Betrothal actually does do something, as useless as it may be, it lets you propose marriage to certain vile creature."

You really seem to be onto something, OP, the pieces fit together really well and I'm glad you brought it up.  I don't think it's too far of a stretch to say that the bosses in the game might be based on both meanings."
bloodborne,3di0fh,dmcredgrave,8,Thu Jul 16 13:51:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a stretch at all.  The Amygdalae are clearly instances of beings which cause fear, anxiety, and other emotions related to the Nuclei Amygdalae.  I think the added bonus of having their name refer to tonsils was very likely noticed on FromSoft's part."
bloodborne,3di0fh,PimpnCereal,4,Thu Jul 16 14:12:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel like they are referring to both instances of the word. Things like Tonsil Stone is a very clear and obvious etymological reference to Amygdala. The fact that its important brain architecture is just an added bonus.
bloodborne,3di0fh,Krawbeard,6,Thu Jul 16 14:08:22 2015 UTC,That's a good observation.   My wife while watching me play the game believes the game is actually being inside a very ill babies immune system trying to fight off infection which is a nightmare for a small child.

Each boss and area representing a specific place or ailment in the body Maybe like a mother struggling physically and mentally with the lose of a child due to a Bloodborne illness?"
bloodborne,3di0fh,M3owpo3,2,Fri Jul 17 12:11:58 2015 UTC,"Well, with the amount of metaphors one find through the game it may be that the whole game is a metaphor itself. In my opinion, more than a metaphor bloodborne is a game with a few themes that are strongly repeated throughout the whole story.   One would be how humans face the unknown: by rejecting it, covering their eyes to don't see it and finally abandoning its humanity. Or on the other side, trying to get more eyes to see and comprehend it, with unexpected result.   About the children theme, with the great ones looking for surrogates once the lose theirs and the humans trying to give birth to the child of blood(and those women that have special blood giving birth to mini daughters of the cosmos), I don't know how to interpret it, really. Maybe that the children must pay for the sins of their fathers, but I'm actually clueless"
bloodborne,3di0fh,dmcredgrave,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:27:22 2015 UTC,If great ones lose their child does that mean they are sterile?

bloodborne,3di0fh,dmcredgrave,2,Sat Jul 18 11:12:01 2015 UTC,"You're correct.  Amygdala does refer to the Greek word amugdalē, which quite literally means almond, but was first defined in the middle ages by Middle Eastern physicians as al-lauzatani, referring to the tonsils.  The Amygdalae, or two tonsils, were the origin of that term.  In Neuroscience, physicians discovered two almond-shaped nuclei in the brain which would become known medically as the Nuclei Amygdalae.  In short: You're correct that it means both almond and tonsil, but in current usage it refers specifically to a part of the brain, and that is most likely the usage of it in Bloodborne."

After getting the platinum I decided to pick up a copy of Dark Souls for PS3 to see how it was. The speed difference was big, but not a deal breaker at all. In time, I've actually started preferring the slow, strategic gameplay of Dark Souls to BB. Switching back and forth takes an adjustment period of about 10-15 minutes but it's just like riding a bike... It always comes back to you."
bloodborne,3do1qm,Rhyxnathotho,-1,Fri Jul 17 21:19:45 2015 UTC,I can switch between dark souls and bloodborne no worries but not between bloodborne and dark souls 2 Not sure what it is but DS2 just irks me to no end

If I could dodge a bit faster after swinging, have it consume 15% less stamina, and they make it overall easier to connect with the dagger or short swords I just can't do it otherwise. I put 400 hours in DS2, but fucking never again, it's too slow and clunky."
bloodborne,3do1qm,BorneByTheBlood,3,Sun Jul 19 06:26:53 2015 UTC,"I was going to give my two cents but it's just preference. I loved BB but I got bored after my second playthrough.   I'm not bad at combat but I don't feel that I'm ever good at it. Don't get me wrong, I win more than I lose, but they never feel as 'strategic' as when I win in other Souls games. I'm fully willing to conceded that that may be me being shit at BB's combat, but again, preference.  That's mostly PVP though. PVE is seriously shits on DS2 completely, but the lack of weapons and spells just don't make me want to go back for a third playthrough (meanwhile I'm on what is my 10+ playthrough of DS2)"

There ARE less weapons and spells in BB. Sure, each weapon is has a shitton of more moves in BB, and most DS and DS2 weapons share a LOT of movesets, but even with all that said there simply ARE more weapons. I didn't say anything about 'diversity,' just that there are more. It's not bullshit just because you disagree.  It just seems like you made this thread as a BB fanboy, and take any criticism as a personal attack. I fucking love BB, DS2 and DS. There are flaws to all of them, and it comes down to preference"

I'm on playthrough number, um, five I guess? of Bloodborne between all the toons I've played.  Still not even close to bored.

bloodborne,3do1qm,Abyss_walking,2,Sat Jul 18 12:48:37 2015 UTC,"I went back to Souls. It was easy to. Bloodborne is a great game when it comes to PvE but the PvP just doesn't scratch the Dark Souls PvP to me. I don't enjoy this fast chaotic mess of pvp feels like there is no strategy at all (keep in mind this is my opinion). I like how magic also can really be effective whereas I feel the arcane was simply put in here as a second thought. Now the chalice dungeons, though it seemed cool at first it just kind of seems boring to me now once you've played a few of each chalice you've basically played them all. I didn't really feel any true ultimate satisfaction from  beating a boss except for ML, MP, and Gehr-bear. Not even the chalice dungeon bosses, I just feel that just because you put my health in half doesn't mean this boss is difficult you deliberately handicapped me because you knew this boss wasn't difficult and needed this to happen so it was a ""challenge"". Personally I'm also disappointed that MP and MWN didn't make a chalice dungeon appearance since in my opinion they were two of the most fun bosses to fight. I hope for a ""nightmare"" chalice with these two in there somewhere. Basically I found bloodborne a great PvE game PvP however not so much."
bloodborne,3do1qm,Abyss_walking,2,Fri Jul 17 23:12:58 2015 UTC,Bloodbornes replayability sucks shit compared to Dark Souls. It's still my favourite game though because the first time I played was so memorable

bloodborne,3do1qm,KingMe42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"First off, because ds1 on pc with 60 fps feels so smooth after playing 30fps locked BB. 2nd, there's a lack of mechanics and depth to Bloodbornes pvp, which I was a little dissapointed with, and have been disapointed with since ds2. And also guns are very annoying in BB pvp. Ds1 pvp is certainly not for everyone, if you ever want to be decent, you usually have to spend a lot of time learning all the different bs/counter bs mechanics, and once you do, or at least start to, when you fight others who have those mechanics down as well or even better than you, that's when I have the most fun, because there's a game within a game, as PhantomEWGF put it, it's like a game of Paper Scissors Rock with all the counter bsing, counter counter bsing etc.. and pulling off some of these crazy things is very fun for me. Also, I'll mention, I only consider myself to be decent at ds1 pvp. I've probably played 4-500 hours of ds1pvp, and the true ""good"" ds1pvpers all have at least 1k hours, some even like 2.5k. Which is odd, as Peeve apparently has 3k hours, but he's not even very good. But anyways, I don't want to start the inevitable argument of which game had the best pvp, or what problems each game has in pvp, because it is all subjective, and all that matters is which game you enjoy pvp the most in, so the game with the best pvp is the one that you enjoy the most. For me, I enjoy ds1 pvp the most, and after hearing ds3 will have the same mechanics I'm quite excited for that. I'm not a huge fan of ds2 pvp, nor the pve, probably will never play it again, it's a decent game on it's own, but compared with the others in the series, it's a letdown. I never played DeS pvp, although I have played the pve, which after playing ds1 first, was short and sweet. I beat DeS pve in 17 hours, and then did ng+, and haven't touched my ps3 since then. I have a fair amount of fun with BB pvp, I wish set up pvp actually worked without 10 minute waits. I dislike the gem system as it is currently, I think the top tier gems should be something like 18-20% rather than 27%, and as I said, I get annoyed by guns in bb pvp. I love the pve of bb, and it may be on par with ds1 pve for me. I just wish it was maybe 20% longer than it is. But yeah, that's my opinion, and why I enjoy ds1 pvp more. If you disagree, good for you, go eat some nice pancakes or something.  Edit: Holy Shit that's a lot of words, sorry if you read all that shit."

bloodborne,3djnhl,Dreaming_Sky,4,Thu Jul 16 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"Pure skill is probably the most (or one of the most) viable approaches to PvP. You have god tier weapons available like the cane, BoM and BB. The visceral scaling is really the deciding factor though. It's crazy. With no runes you can do around 900 visceral damage and with a 30% just forget about it, they're dead.   However, with my arcane build I do about 300 damage with a visceral attack. Honestly I think it's a little ridiculous. My normal greatsword R1 does more damage without open enemy bonus. Even when I put on the best rune, it didn't make the damage even close to worth actually getting the visceral. It would still be better to just hit them normally afterwards.  In my opinion build viability in PvP goes by this order: bloodtinge/skill, quality, arcane, strength. Bloodtinge is arguably first just because of the Evelyn, but the next two are there because more weapon choices and visceral damage. Then strength, not because it's bad at all, but because it doesn't get secondary bonuses like visceral damage, arcane tools or elemental damage (that I'm aware of)."
bloodborne,3djnhl,poopitymcpants,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:37:35 2015 UTC,"Your perspective is much more well-rounded than mine, but we generally agree.  I appreciate your informative post and opinion!  Others in the thread have commented on factors like high base damage and hyper-armor as factors in Str builds' favor.  I'm not totally sold, but the answers have had a lot of good information, so all good at the end of the day!"
bloodborne,3djnhl,poopitymcpants,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:09:27 2015 UTC,"This is just my opinion for strength weapons in Bloodborne. I absolutely loved strength PvP in Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2. In Bloodborne you have a lot more dodges in a stamina bar and what appears to be a good amount of iframes (don't quote me on that), although you don't have invulnerability when recovering from getting knocked down like in the souls games.   Dark Souls 2 strength PvP is very refined compared to Dark Souls strength PvP in my opinion. You had the ability to aim your attacks while locked on, and I really miss that in Bloodborne. I wasn't aware of the state of hyper-armor either in the game, I honestly have not used very many of the strength (or big) weapons for a long time except Ludwig's. I actually really like the greatsword form of it but that's quality.   In this game they really made sure each weapon had its niche and was viable or at least unique in some way. I've heard great things about some strength weapons and I'm sure there are some benefits, but I was just evaluating them based on the amount of bonus effects leveling the stat had."
bloodborne,3djnhl,lastpawn,2,Fri Jul 17 20:44:50 2015 UTC,"I think they're fairly balanced. Strength weapons tend to have a higher base damage, thus scaling better with attributes. As for visceral attacks... most strength weapons require some skill investment anyway, so you're going to go to the softcap there (25), giving you a substantial visceral damage bonus. Besides, simply leveling up + physical gems + runes provides more than enough damage."
bloodborne,3djnhl,BorneByTheBlood,2,Fri Jul 17 10:05:30 2015 UTC,"I love skill and strength, but skill only weapons are objectively worse than strength weapon. Hunters axe out reaches, out damages, and out performed the Cane in ever venue, even against beasts whilst offering the LARGEST a rally potential short of the Burial Blade, I believe it goes Burial, Axe TF, Kirk TF(R1) Ludwig TF(R1), Burial UTF, Ludwig TF(R2), Kirk TF(R2), Axe UTF (R1/R2). Skill is awesome and has some amazing weapons, but it certainly doesn't trump strength."
bloodborne,3djnhl,Judge-Nahar,4,Fri Jul 17 15:13:04 2015 UTC,"My opinion, STR has the best potential for living through the game simply because it outputs a larger amount of damage earlier and has better stunning potential of enemies. As for the drawback of a weaker Visceral, that's what the Clawmark Runes are there to help with.  Don't get me wrong - my first build was Skill and I love it to death, but STR definitely has more versatility and function going for it."
bloodborne,3djnhl,Judge-Nahar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:45:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks, and good point about the runes.  It feels a little weird going that way instead of the typical holy trinity (Clockwise, Anti-Clock, Great Lake), but I see the thinking."
bloodborne,3djnhl,GothMAXMP,2,Fri Jul 17 00:36:17 2015 UTC,"No problem. I always use Anti-Clockwise and Blood Rapture (restores Health on Visceral) as my two main Runes, and depending on the character will adjust the final Rune to Clawmark (for STR) or whatever I feel like for the final one (more bullets and vials, sometimes). I have found this to give me good odds in most encounters, but I am reliant on Viscerals for gaining bullets and health back. It makes some encounters realllllly intense!   I cannot say I have ever used Great Lake. Is the small percentage really noticeable?"
bloodborne,3djnhl,FurtiveCutless,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:34:53 2015 UTC,"It... feels like it kind of is?  The numbers (if you look at your stats) do jump up somewhat noticeably.  ""Armor"" is a very sketchy concept in Bloodborne anyway, so I'd guess every little bit helps?"
bloodborne,3djnhl,GothMAXMP,3,Fri Jul 17 16:06:37 2015 UTC,"okay well first off, the saw spear is not ""objectively better"" than the saw cleaver.  i vastly prefer the cleaver and i think it's totally subjective.    i also don't understand you saying that skill pays off over time and strength doesn't?  they both scale equally well, and most strength weapons actually scale a little bit better.  and the kirkhammer is the true min-max str weapon, LW doesn't hold a candle lol  visceral damage also benefits from strength, just not quite as much as skill.  it is not substantially less at that level at all though, especially with a rune.    i think the hyper-armor, prevalence of blunt damage (and therefore much higher regain values) and amount of strength-focused weapons all make it an equal choice to skill."
bloodborne,3djnhl,GothMAXMP,4,Thu Jul 16 20:40:07 2015 UTC,"I really think the Spear is objectively better based on two factors:   Doesn't lose Serration bonus while TF Longer than Cleaver in short form (reflected in PvP and PvE - it's a short extension, like that between LHB and KH, but it is present)   To my (limited) knowledge, Skill pays off more over time (just in the number of AR points gained through scaling) than Strength. A great example is, again, Spear vs Cleaver.  At 99 of the respective prime requisite attribute, Spear outdamages Cleaver even though Cleaver's base +10 AR is higher.  The scaling more than makes up the difference.  Another example - though this is getting into the weeds - is Burial Blade.  BB (I believe) actually scales slightly better before the softcap on Str than Arc, but it does scale on Arc... thus, a 50 Ski/25 Str/20 Arc BB wielder is going to do substantially (like 40+ points per hit IIRC) more damage than a 50 Str/25 Ski/20 Arc Hunter Axe user because the Axe has no non-gemmed Arc scaling.  BB is thus the more powerful weapon assuming realistic stat investment if you're going to use any spells at all, which I think most players will unless aiming for a low PvP range (60-80, which some do).  LW is capable of IMMENSELY higher AR - like 200 or more points per hit IIRC - than KH assuming Adept Blunt gems.  KH needs its sword mode IMO, for faster strikes.  LW doesn't have a sword mode, so you're not limiting half your moveset by dropping all Adept Blunt gems in.  At 50 Str/25 Ski with 3x 27.2%, KH is causing 862 AR per hit according to Silvard's calc, which I think is pretty accurate.  Take it up to 99/99 and you're at 989 AR.  By comparison, LW at 50 Str and 3x 32.9% Adept Blunts is doing to do 1048 AR.  Now I'm not 100% sure you can get a Triangle 32.9% AB, so let's change that to a normal Tri 27.2% Physical.  Now we're at 1003, still at 50 Str, so at hardcap rather than max, LW is doing objectively more damage than KH just based on maxed gems.  At 99 it's even a bigger spread, LW goes up to 1077 per hit.  Based on this, I'm considering LW the definitive min-max Str weapon, though  I'm more than open to being corrected by someone with direct maxed gem-farming experience.  Now let's look at BB with similar numbers.  BB can't exploit AB gems, so it's probably going to lock in with 3x 27.2% Physicals for a  max-farmed build.  At 50 Ski/25 Str/20 Arc that's 741 AR per hit (remember BB doesn't need to gem to get its Arc damage).  At 99 Ski/Str/Arc it goes up to 883.  So you've got a MUCH faster-hitting weapon (actually possible to get a 2-hit combo in PvP that might not be dodged) with MUCH MUCH higher Rally than LW on the a weapon that isn't even the min-max... and it's actually kind of close to LW on damage (I know 200 points per hit is a lot, but if the BB gets 2 hits in normal mode, it's way in front on damage).  I already mentioned the damage advantages BB has over Axe above.  In Axe's favor, IMO, is that its moveset generally involves more reach, and even if you're gemming for Adept Blunt, you've still got a good palette of big-payoff moves to use (TF L2, TF second hit of R1 combo, TF and normal R2).  Plus of course Axe gets STW, which is (since it hits twice with a short delay) innately safer than BB TF charged R2.  So you can, convincingly, argue that Axe is competitive with BB even though it's the clear loser on damage.  What seals the deal for BB as victor, IMO, is that its normal mode attacks are so much faster than Axe's, while it has similar Rally potential IIRC.  Bear in mind, BB also gets some hyper armor on hits as well."

You completely ignore the meaning of damage modifiers on different attacks of different weapons and the fact that the wheel has slit damage.

bloodborne,3djnhl,GothMAXMP,2,Thu Jul 16 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"That's not a case of skill scaling being stronger than strength. That's a case of the scaling value of the spear for skill being slightly higher than the scaling value the cleaver has for strength.   If it's specific to those two particular weapons, fair enough.   I don't even... Why you even need to put any points into arc when using the Hunters Axe? That's just a stupid, stupid comparison. We're talking about weapons here and nothing else and do not even start to assume that everyone at lvl100 will use spells in PvP.   You're cherry-picking what I said to try and pick it apart.  This is ALL of what I said:   BB (I believe) actually scales slightly better before the softcap on Str than Arc, but it does scale on Arc... thus, a 50 Ski/25 Str/20 Arc BB wielder is going to do substantially (like 40+ points per hit IIRC) more damage than a 50 Str/25 Ski/20 Arc Hunter Axe user because the Axe has no non-gemmed Arc scaling. BB is thus the more powerful weapon assuming realistic stat investment if you're going to use any spells at all, which I think most players will unless aiming for a low PvP range (60-80, which some do).   I didn't even bold the relevant parts of that, because the only things I can think of which would make that clearer are first, to point out that I was angling for a 120 build, which makes all the rest of the stats very obvious; and second; to have widened the listed low-range PvP level I listed to include 100.  That said, you can totally hit one hardcap (Ski or Str), still have a decent score in the other physical attribute, and have enough to dump 20 into Arc at L100, especially if you're content with sub-20 End.  I'd think the specific text of what I wrote made it clear that I understood lower PvP ranges have a different calculus of how much (if any) Arc to invest.  No need to kick straw men to score internet points.  Too, passing up the opportunity to use Beast Roar and Hunter Bone even at 100 seems weird to me.  I've had a few (under 10) PvP fights when I was just trying to pass through NF and NoM, and in both cases I was well under 120.  I don't know what the invaders' level was, but I  don't think I ever saw a single one NOT use a spell at least once.  In NF it's an almost guaranteed kill if the victim isn't smart enough to not fight near a fatal fall or one down into an area with nasty stuff waiting to kill you, which on my first playthrough, I of course wasn't.  That's anecdotal, I grant.  I'd make some argument for Phantasm Shell as well, just because if someone's kitted out with a lot of Yahar'gul Black or Cainhurst it's going to make a decent difference if you can land hits with it active.  Also:   We're talking about weapons here and nothing else   No, we're really not:   [Discussion] Skill weapons/builds better off than Strength? (post title)   and   I'll get the TL;DR out of the way up front: IMO Skill builds are significantly better off than Strength builds because of several specific factors.   and   Strength Build Pros:  Skill Build Pros:   So again, no we're really not.   Aaaaand by using blunt gems in the Wheel with nothing but 50str you effectively limit your moveset to the non-tranformed mode, great! Exactly the same thing as using blunt gems in a Kirkhammer.   So again, did you actually read any of the upthread, downthread, or OP?  Because if I'm talking about gemming a Hunter Axe for blunt to get extra miles out of a subset of its moves - even at the cost of having to get a second weapon to +10 (and gemmed) if you want to have a fast close-range option, I figure you can probably get pretty easily from that, that I'm ok with limiting a weapon's move set to exploit higher available gem damage percents.  (And no, I didn't make that up by my ownself.  A friends-list co-opper mentioned it, specifically about LW, and I loved the idea.)  Now to be sure, GothmaxMP made some great points about LW TF mode, which - you're both quite correct - I hadn't adequately considered.  There's a big difference, though.  While s/he was, if anything, rather more informative than you, s/he was also respectful.  Which, if s/he happens to read this, I appreciate.  You, on the other hand, aren't quite trolling, but you're totally cherry-picking text, not reading the whole backdrop, and basically looking for excuses to gnarl.  Want to gnarl?  I've got some AWESOME political websites for you.  I asked, quite respectfully I think:   I'm seeking opinions on this.  ...  Let me ask the sub; what do you think?   for opinions.  You could have said 100% of the stuff you said in your post(s - including the LHB stuff above)  without being rude."
bloodborne,3djnhl,Chilli_Axe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:22:22 2015 UTC,"the serration bonus, scaling and hitbox increase on both forms on the spear is to make up for the lower base damage and much much weaker transformed moveset.  again, purely subjective.  and that's the problem with a lot of your arguments here - you are basing them on sheet damage primarily, when that's so little of what matters.  LW does high a higher AR assuming adept blunt gems, but you'd be gimping yourself completely if you were to go that route.  it's maximum damage output is always going to be with an arcane build and +flat arc gems because of the way its transformed scaling and multiple hits work.  you ARE limiting half your moveset, because in transformed mode you are actually drastically reducing your dam/stam output.  kirkhammer does not need its sword mode honestly, not nearly as much as LW needs its transformed mode.  again, you are going off of sheet damage - kirkhammer uses much less stamina per hit than LW and so it can dish out much more damage over time on a min-max str build.  kirkhammer also has higher damage modifiers all-around.  burial blade is not a ""much faster hitting weapon"" than kirkhammer or the wheel, and i'd say it's pretty close to the wheel in terms of stamina consumption.  it has a higher rally per hit but, again here we are at the central issue with your arguments being based around numbers, LW actually delivers a large number of hits at once, giving LW the hands-down best rally in the game in practice.    you are just excluding a whole number of factors in your arguments and i'm sure someone who knows more than me will point out the further flaws but things like damage modifiers, stamina usage, movesets, hyper armor, etc. are all essential pieces.  i've played a lot with both strength and skill weapons in all levels of PvE and PvP and i think they're really well-balanced."

Right now I'm running a Str toon with the following stats:   50 Vit 20 End 50 Str 25 Ski 5 BT 20 Arc   So obviously a 120 toon.  I have a +10 Axe and +9 Cleaver.  I am working on getting the Cleaver up to +10, and on getting better gems for both (I've got crap gems right now, max like 24.3% Phys I think).  But recently I've been thinking I'd like to go back to KH and use Cleaver as a backup.  It'll take a bit, but I can get a KH up to +10 if I just play through my NG+ (which this toon just started).  What do you think?  With the above stats - understanding I want the 20 Arc to use Gloves - would you go KH/Cleaver for the power, or Axe/Cleaver for the range?

bloodborne,3djnhl,FurtiveCutless,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:04:52 2015 UTC,"that's a tough one.  the immediate issue i see for KH is that your stam is just so low.  i almost always take end to 40 on a strength build.  i also play a rushdown style almost exclusively though so take that in mind, you might need less stam if you aren't into applying that kind of pressure.    but yeah, because of that alone, i would stay with the axe.  you're gonna get yourself into trouble with the heavy kirk stam usage, or at least i would haha"

I don't have the 20% Stam gem yet, so I'm sorta hoping it helps... but at the end of the day, I've noticed I do use Gloves, but I use it a lot less than Shell and Roar.  I really need to get into using Hunter Bone as well.  All three are useful spells that don't need any Arc to improve their performance.  I do also use Bell (for PvE, not PvP), and maybe I'll miss the 5 points of Arc for that... but I think the Stamina will be more useful.  A whole 'nother toon.  le sigh"

bloodborne,3djrua,mo0trix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:46:00 2015 UTC,"That's not what they mean.  They means a number of weapons, including the arguably more interesting ones, cannot be obtained before the second half of the game, and that they hope the expansion will be structured such that it can be accessed early, so one can rush to those weapons and get them early."
bloodborne,3djrua,LotusGramarye,0,Thu Jul 16 23:34:49 2015 UTC,"Which weapons are these? Chikage(3), German Reiter blah(2), Evelyn(2), Cannon(2), Riflespear(1), Tonitrus(2), Wheel(3/1), Saw Spear(0), Holy Blade(2), Kirkhammer(1), Flamesprayer(1), Hunters Torch(1), Stake Driver(1), Repeating Pistol(1), Ludwigs Rifle(?), Augur Tool(2), Beast Roar Tool(2), Old Bone Tool(2), and Blades of Woe(0/?).

bloodborne,3djrua,BorneByTheBlood,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:47:21 2015 UTC,"Nope. You're forgetting that you need to kill either Bloodstarved or Cleric Beast before you can fight Vicar Amelia, which is required to gain access to the Forbidden Woods/get the Cainhurst Summons/trigger the wheel badge drop. Then you need to kill the Hemwick witches before you can get to Cainhurst. Blade of Mercy also cost a metric fucktonne for early game, so you're going to have to kill a few bosses to afford it. That's still not so many bosses for most weapons, but when the game's so short, you shouldn't understate things. Personally, I feel that early game options are fine as they are, but I always love the ability to access harder content early, so I'm all for a shortcut to the expansion."

Indicating it can be received at 0 boss kills or an unspecified amount of boss kills to progress the quest line. 40,000 Blood Echos I only a lot with the 0 Boss kills method, as by doing Gascoigne and BSB you can easily get Hypogean Gaol to earn 1,300 + 400 in bloodstone if sold, 300-600 for the hunchback, and 3,400 for each pig. If you ignore the downstairs areas and the hounds, you can get 40k in 4 runs. The same is true for instead taking on Vicar, if you wish to avoid summoning Snatchers, and then going to the forest for easy Echos."
bloodborne,3djrua,BorneByTheBlood,7,Fri Jul 17 14:28:30 2015 UTC,I would be very very surprised if the DLC was anything less than late game content. Likely post Rom for sure. Previous From games to look at have always put expansion stuff in the mid-late game.
bloodborne,3djrua,Miskykins,2,Thu Jul 16 22:42:50 2015 UTC,"This is unfortunately true (aside from the fact that you could rush Sunken King and Old Iron King pretty early on if you knew exactly what you were doing and could defeat high level content at very low levels - not true for SotFS anymore though).  Hopefully in Bloodborne it will be gated by difficulty rather than progression, which is something people very much liked in DkS1."
bloodborne,3djrua,Miskykins,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:50:24 2015 UTC,Well I mean you still had to at least grab the lord vessel right? that's pretty mid-ish into the game for the dlc. I'm thinkin maybe amelia trigger. But I'd love if the expansion talked about the Powder Kegs some more.
bloodborne,3djrua,worldsthatneverwere,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:13:39 2015 UTC,"I meant the fact that a big part of the game was accessible even at low level (Blighttown, Tomb of the Giants, Ash Lake, Sif) and you could do it in any order you wanted."
bloodborne,3djrua,Pkrhett,3,Fri Jul 17 11:48:41 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with this, anyone that doesn't agree probably hasn't played either of the dark souls games, they have magic as well plus the whole two handed to use a weapon you don't have the stats for yet. They literally throw weapons at you. Don't even get me started on the whole lost and uncanny debacle, you could at least have made them look a bit different, you created father g's axe as a different model, come on. Every playthrough starts the same, do I want the axe or the cane this time and I'll grab the saw blade from the sewer, I then rush to the weapon I want and then start enjoying the game again.  Seriously, the most I've enjoyed it in ages is killing bsb then being summoned to kkqmduet to do almost a whole burial blade playthrough.  All this could be solved really easily, make the weapons buyable in new game after grabbing them once with any character- or- let you select any starting weapon, even if you select one that you can't equip yet because of stats, either give you another basic starting weapon or we can just rush to the sewer for a few soul levels with the saw blade"
bloodborne,3djrua,Erotic_Walrus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:53:43 2015 UTC,"This is why I would want them to make it easier to access late game weapons. I would love to do a whole playthrough with Chikage or Burial Blade or Beast Claw, rather than having to do half of the game with the same weapon I always do it.  Going to NG+ just isn't the same. A lot of the early game is way too easy if you go into NG+ with all your weapons and at a high level. On top of that, I hate sacrificing a character that I spent a while making and then not being able to PvP the way I want to without getting through the whole game again."
bloodborne,3djrua,Erotic_Walrus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:40:49 2015 UTC,"NG+ you can do the whole play with any weapon. it only takes like 2 hours to reach gerhman and kill him with 3 cords then bold hunter mark. you can get any weapon in the game pretty quick.  also you should always NG+ for PvP, then leave all optional bosses alive for increased pvp chance"
bloodborne,3djrua,BorneByTheBlood,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"Strength and quality weapons dominate the early game. It's a good thing the Threaded Cane is awesome because my first character was pure SKL and I don't think I found another SKL weapon until I got the Burial Blade. Every other one is incredibly easy to miss, which is just ridiculous."
bloodborne,3djrua,MegiddoZO,3,Thu Jul 16 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"Well, there are the Saw Spear and Rifle Spear early on.  Later there is also the Reiterpallasch."

bloodborne,3djrua,jpomz,3,Thu Jul 16 23:54:09 2015 UTC,"Riflespear has a huge poise break and gain with its insanely high ranged Attack. It's damage is weak, but it's the only weapon that can stun, interrupt, and parry. It also can stun effectively with its UTF R1 spam, whilst providing pure thrust damage which has the fewest enemies that resist that damage type."
bloodborne,3djrua,DRGaming,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:56:42 2015 UTC,"Why not just start a NG+ with different weapons? You have access to all the weapons then and can easily upgrade them to +6, which makes them do average damage on most enemies and your game will be around the same challenge."
bloodborne,3djrua,Im_Heartless,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:34:51 2015 UTC,I too wish that all the weapons were available earlier but I wouldn't expect that in the DLC.
bloodborne,3djrua,gwaybz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:58:47 2015 UTC,"There are nowhere near enough weapons. I've just finished making a build for every weapon in the game, and its less than a year in.  I really hope the dlc adds 30+ weapons, because honestly the ""trick"" gimmick isn't that great. We already had the two handing mechanic and its not that different, it gave you a different moveset.  I miss having a bunch of different weapons in the same category got a bunch of different situations, going back and playing DeS and DkS is such a different ballgame now, I miss making all those joke builds, and less than optimized builds and still wrecking it in pvp.  The most fun I've had in one of these games was making a flippy pyro with the kellog sword in DkS, it wasn't close to optimized, but gee gosh it was fun."
bloodborne,3djrua,Im_Heartless,3,Thu Jul 16 23:20:16 2015 UTC,Meh...I'm doing a playthrough of DkS2 as we speak and I've put like 1000 hours into DkS1...and I'll tell you the two handed moveset for MOST weapons is essentially the same aside from the power attack. And then you have rapiers where EVERY ATTACK LOOKS THE SAME NO MATTER WHAT. I enjoy the trick weapons because it is essentially like having two weapons that you can switch between WHILE attacking and have very different movesets(for the most part). I do get you on build diversity though
bloodborne,3djrua,hydrefia,-9,Fri Jul 17 05:55:41 2015 UTC,"""muh bloodborne has no diversity""   maybe learn the game, you can get to most weapons in an hour..."
bloodborne,3djrua,gwaybz,6,Thu Jul 16 21:00:49 2015 UTC,"I never said it has no diversity, although in terms of weapons it obviously has much less than all previous game.  The problem I have with it is that because there are very few weapons in Bloodborne, it's kind of disappointing that a lot of the interesting ones aren't really available till very late in the game."
bloodborne,3djrua,OOpiumBear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:38:23 2015 UTC,"I think that's not really the case any more though. Or rather, not as much. Didn't 1.05 make it so that you need to be able to create a dungeon to be summoned in it?   In this case, no more new characters summoned into high lvl dungeons.  Getting to Lower Ailing Loran for BB for example now requires you to kill amy, clear the whole ailing loran, and get to lower ailing loran.  Before even being able to do that you'd need to clear the phtumeru labs for materials. Or can you be summoned if you have the chalice but no materials at all? In this case, kill amy, get summoned into loran, clear it, get summoned into lower.  Same with Bclaw /lost or uncanny imprints"
bloodborne,3djrua,m0dred,-8,Thu Jul 16 21:40:59 2015 UTC,"so you are missing BB and Bclaw, still every other weapon is rushable in max 1hours, and since most people seem to need 40 or more hours to complete the game (scrubs) they have 39hours to use the weapon"

bloodborne,3djrua,gwaybz,-7,Thu Jul 16 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"5 starter weapons. 1 more weapon found in the sewer. 2 more after cleric beast. 1 more after gascoigne. Kill a certain NPC thats one more weapon. 10 weapons and you haven't even left central yharnam. You can also rush to the weapon you want, its pretty easy.    But yes by all means lets hope From creates a game where everything is available from the start so the rest of the game becomes infinitely stale and boring with little feel of progression and no hope of finding anything cool.

bloodborne,3dko22,TokyoAi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:18:12 2015 UTC,"Thrust and blunt are exactly what they sound like. Stabbing someone with the Threaded Cane does thrust damage; slamming someone with the Kirkhammer does blunt damage.  Any physical (that is, not magical or elemental) attack that doesn't do thrust or blunt does ""physical.""  This is usually pretty easy to figure out for your own weapons, and you can look it up if you need to. Most weapons do at most two different types of damage, depending on which attack you're using.  It's more difficult for enemies, and I don't know whether the community yet has a complete list of boss attacks and their damage types. A general rule I rely on is: unless a boss has a sword or the like, they probably won't be doing any thrust damage. But when you're facing the big monsters, I honestly can't tell the difference between blunt and physical."
bloodborne,3dko22,nosewings,2,Fri Jul 17 01:40:56 2015 UTC,"When it comes to bosses i'd believe that any directly forward-moving attack is a thrust, any downward-moving slams and the like are blunt and all the swipes and stuff is regular physical. As for OPs question, if the thing you fight is on fire, try some fire resistant, if it has lightning shooting out of it, try bolt resistance and if it has neither, go with a mix of the three types of physical. Armor only does that much its mostly up to your dodging skills to stay alive. 10 of any resistance is about 1% migitation and some monsters deals impressive amounts of damage which ridicules the percentages of migitation."
bloodborne,3dko22,OOpiumBear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:37:07 2015 UTC,"to be fair, the point of armor and other defense stuff in this game is solely to keep things that should one-shot you from one-shotting you, just like DeS.  anything beyond that is a huge bonus lol  so it actually does matter quite a bit, it's just not the ""armor"" we're accustomed to from some other RPGs.  it won't make you unstoppable but it can absolutely save your ass time and time again, even moreso in BB with percentages."

A little cheesy I know but I love inserting a little lore creativity. Gives the play through a little weight. I was inspired by the Pelerines from The Book of the New Sun. If you know that reference you have my respect."

Current build is the former head of the school of Mensis returned to exact vengeance on Micolash for stealing his work. In this story, my character created the nightmare as a sort of incubator for great ones, and the other students sacrificed themselves for a chance at ending the first nightmare and ascending to a higher state only to have Micolash stunt their efforts with his desire to work with the great ones rather than to exceed their powers. It was in the nightmare where Gerty (me) learned to dream, and it is in the dream where he will learn to awaken the potential that the old blood always possessed that was never fully realized.   Basically he's a hyper ambitious mad scientist with a bone to pick."

I didn't know the impact behind it until I read up on the wiki after finishing the game, but even without knowing much, it felt really special.  I find it kind of a pity that you could parry him. His fight is similar to Dark Souls 1's Artorias in that you know he's a shadow of his former self, and he's STILL kicking serious ass. The fact that you can parry him kind of diminishes that feeling. The next time I fight him, I'm gonna try to do it without parrying."

bloodborne,3dg5l3,BlueUnknown,2,Thu Jul 16 18:15:18 2015 UTC,"If you've watched any of Aegon's other videos, you can see that his style of storytelling isn't about explaining, but merely rearranging the way the characters are portrayed within the game and sort of focusing the story around them specifically.  It's an interesting way to present a story that I very much enjoy; there's no explanation for the Lore, simply taking the subtle and making it unsubtle.  He takes lines of dialogue that don't have context and gives them context, and it's something I enjoy watching."

You need one kind of material from 1+ to 3+, another kind for 4+ to 6+ and a third for 7+ to 9+ and a special material for the last 10+. Armor cannot be upgraded, you'll find loads of different armors and all of them have their own strong defenses but no armor is the ""best"" armor, they are all best in their specific area."
bloodborne,3dje3m,OOpiumBear,2,Thu Jul 16 19:28:20 2015 UTC,"Going on what OOpiumBear said, armor is usually dependent on a lot of different variables. It seems mostly like player preference.

bloodborne,3djppf,jackster1990,3,Thu Jul 16 20:42:20 2015 UTC,"Everyone else has already pretty much answered the questions you posted, so I'll just give you a historical perspective of NG+ in the Souls series.  Starting in Demon's Souls, NG+ was introduced as the solution to several potential problems. First, beating the game and having it end would mean that the player would lose all the time and effort that they put in to the character, which would be a huge pain, especially for the PvP focused players. Second, it was impossible to get all of the items in the game in a single playthrough, due in part to the world/character tendency system. Third, there is a story-based weapon that you don't get until the end of the game, meaning that you would never actually get to use it in-game. Finally, the potential power that the player character could gain was more than enough to render the challenge of the standard game minimal, which is why the difficulty increases through game completions: to keep the player challenged as they continue playing.  Dark Souls kept the NG+ element from Demon's Souls for many of the same reasons, and made the final boss's equipment obtainable once you had beaten the game once. Dark Souls 2 added to NG+ by making new enemies appear, giving bosses new moves, etc., to keep the game fresh and surprise the players who enjoyed NG+. In addition, Dark Souls 2 allowed players to ""NG+"" individual areas as they chose, which was an interesting way for experienced players to rush higher rewards.  Bloodborne's NG+ follows the DS1 style of ""more difficulty/try the late game weapons on early game bosses"". However, due to the differences between BB and the Souls series, there are a few differences. First, you can get everything in a single playthrough of BB, so NG+ is less essential. Second, chalice dungeons don't reset after going into NG+, and their difficulties don't increase. Third, the difficulty spike between NG and NG+ is Bloodborne is severely more challenging than any of the Souls games, as the game expects players to be completing the optional chalice dungeons for higher level bloodgems.  Essentially, whether you play NG+ or not is entirely up to if you want to or not. Personally, I prefer to make a new character entirely and play through the game again in a different way, instead of playing the same character again on NG+, but I'm glad that the option is available, and some of my PvP-focused characters are on a higher NG level."

bloodborne,3djppf,FugginIpad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:47 2015 UTC,"You start over from the start with the same stats and items as you had on the end of your NG. Every mob is harder with more health by yield more echoes. Its meant to make the game harder and harder for each NG cycle. The same as #1. You will know you are in NG+ when you see the opening cinematic once again after finishing the game. There is no prompt. Same everything, its your chance to find what you didn't find in your first playthrough or to do something you did differently this time. Also #1 again. Starting a new game enables you to make a new build from scratch meaning levels early on can be placed at lower amounts of echoes to perfect your build. NG+ you'll continue with the same build. There are up to NG+6"
bloodborne,3djppf,OOpiumBear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:46:43 2015 UTC,Just to expand on this.    You lose all your keys but keep all your badges. Everything else you pertain.  Edit: 2. There is no question you will just be plonked into NG+ however there is a big change in hunters dream and this will signify you are at end game.  You dont have to make a new account you can have up to 10 characters on the same account.  Enemies actually keep getting harder and you keep getting an increase of enemies up until NG+7. It is however an infinate amount of times you can go through the game but it stops getting more difficult up after Ng+7
bloodborne,3djppf,M3mn0ch_1987,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:38 2015 UTC,"It exists for people who want to play through the game again. They can choose NG+ over a completely new game for several reasons, such as not wanting to gather equipment/items again or simply because the regular new game is too easy. The game begins again after triggering one of three endings, so you will certainly know. Your character awakens at the same place as when you first start the game. You will keep all your equipment, weapons armor and consumables. You will lose most of your key items, because otherwise you would be able to skip most of the game from the getgo.   As far as enemies go, they will have more health and deal more damage. That pretty much it, no different than in regular NG and no new enemies. You're gonna play through the whole thing again.   Literally nothing but challenge or grabbing some items with a limited quantity per playthrough (such has the higher upgrade materials). It is the same thing, only in NG+ you start with a already outfitted character from before and enemies are sponges. It's basically infinite although the difficulty stop going up at NG+7 (I think)"

You have to play NG+ at least once, hmmm... actually you can do a speed run and brag about it.  It is hard to do a speed run in NG (just new game) unless you play games for a living.  NG++ and on are boring.  I did a speed run in NG++, so easy and so fast, and so borrrrrrrrring."
bloodborne,3djm32,BorneByTheBlood,3,Thu Jul 16 20:16:35 2015 UTC,You might be better off getting the cursed blood droplets via farming the winter lanterns in mergos for the 19/19.8 phys up.   The winter lanterns in nightmare frontier also drop them but they are not as good but will do you for the time being until you can get to mergos.   Ive not been on BB for a week or so now so i dont know of any glyphs sorry and all the ones on spreadsheets are obviously late dungeons.   Good luck hunter.
bloodborne,3djm32,M3mn0ch_1987,2,Thu Jul 16 20:37:49 2015 UTC,i've done the same thing and my advice is rush the main game for +10 weapon and 3x gems from the winter lanterns.  you don't really get gems substantially better than that until depth 5 dungeons.  now that they patched out the SRRC there's no real shortcut either.  but it's definitely possible to get all the depth 5 root chalices at this level.  beast blood pellets are your friend.  as are clawmark runes.

bloodborne,3di2cs,poopitymcpants,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:05:24 2015 UTC,"Ludwig's should be OK, but I would recommend you keep it in one-handed mode. The Keeper can be interrupted by almost any attack, so as long as you swing first, you can keep her from hitting you. Especially early on in the fight, she has a predictable response of two slashes as a counter, so get in 2-4 hits, backstep, and immediately shoot your gun for a good chance at a party.  When she starts to buff her weapon, try to interrupt and then keep the pressure on her. She will attempt the buff several times, and if you can stay close, it gives you lots of free hits and makes her less dangerous."
bloodborne,3di2cs,Dresner29,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:45:08 2015 UTC,"So someone knows this trick? Awesome!  She always does that slash to back step slash attack. Two chances to parry, in other words.

bloodborne,3di2cs,poopitymcpants,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:45:28 2015 UTC,Chain parry him. It's the easiest way. Works pretty consistently too. All you have to do is hit him twice then immediately shoot and you'll get a parry. It's how his AI works.   After that you just walk up to him and shoot again right after he gets up. He will always attack and you can easily chain him this way. It's how I killed him last time. Didn't have to use a vial.

Absolutely it is worth it to play Bloodborne, even if it is capped at 30fps, and I was well aware of the limitations that the PS4 has when I purchased it (for bloodborne mind you), but you're comment about people complaining when you state it's perfectly smooth is just not true. Its a totally valid criticism, and some games (like TLOU remastered) have found workarounds to cater to people like me who care about it."

Or in other words, devs still have more tricks to figure out to get more out of the system.  But I do agree. The frame rate doesnt dip too often for me. Only when I hit multiple enemy's and cause a ton of damage does the frame rate dip a little. I'm guessing the blood splatter takes a lot of processing.

No man, 200k is noting.  The best place to get echoes is inside the dungeons.  You are in NG+ already, so you must've done the dungeons or you should start immediately.  So, try to get to Ailing Loran, just killing the mob of hooded beasts at the Layer 1, without any damage to you, you get ~50K per run.  No need to kill the boss.  If you equipped multiple Moon runes (two or more), you could get ~90K per run.  Now, march on to Lower Loran, at Level 1, each run you will net ~130K plus nice bloodstone chunks by killing the so ridiculously easy boss.  This is where I farmed echos and chunks with a small or no scratch.  So easy to level up your character to 150 (each level would cost >100K) and upgrade the weapons with chunks.  After this point on, echoes are useless as you can max out all the storage to hold your consumable items.  This is when you buy 99 hand-lanterns."

bloodborne,3depz2,robotron1971,5,Wed Jul 15 18:54:39 2015 UTC,Cheers! I decided to commit to it from the start specifically because I thought it would be interesting to know for sure just how frustrating (or not) each boss had been.
bloodborne,3depz2,x_stickman_x,5,Wed Jul 15 19:07:00 2015 UTC,"Good stuff, man. I find it's easier to measure a bosses difficulty in hours rather than deaths in my BL4. Hmm... I feel the need to mention that I'm actually a pretty good counter. What's next in your challenge run career?  edit: I think I'm gonna borrow your order for shadows. I've been doing Ranged dude -> katana -> Candle, but I just can't take the dual stretchy armed zoners anymore. It's ridiculous looking for an opening in that set up."
bloodborne,3depz2,x_stickman_x,2,Wed Jul 15 20:18:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks dude. Haha you're not wrong about measuring it in time instead of deaths, that was just the simplest way to do it since it would be difficult to keep track of hours spent. I tend to pause for smokes or have random bits of idle time, plus theres a couple bosses I left and came back to. I like hard numbers lol.  Whats next? I'm not sure honestly. Fists or torch only just seem like they would be really tedious. I'm thinking some sort of permadeath challenge or trying my hand at speedrunning it. A monocular playthrough also seems like it could be entertaining.  I want to take my BL4 into FRC dungeons as well, but I'm probably going to take a break for a few days to do some dungeon diving on my level 260+ character.  Yeah, fuck taking on both sword Shadows in phase 2. Just nope."
bloodborne,3depz2,Erotic_Walrus,3,Wed Jul 15 20:45:19 2015 UTC,"If you ever want to play your BL4 again, I advise farming up some +27% phys damage up near death +9.1% phys damage up gems from the ghost ladies. It makes my level 4 hit about 400 on the saw cleaver. Those things + beasthood go a long way."
bloodborne,3depz2,MrBrokewilly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:47:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I'll definitely look into those for the FRC dungeons since it'll be one shot city there anyway.
bloodborne,3depz2,_pt3,3,Wed Jul 15 20:52:15 2015 UTC,"And I've taken all kinds of shit here for saying that Abhorrent Beast is unequivocally one of the game's most abusive bosses.  ""Just dodge to your left,"" they say! ""His attacks are all plainly telegraphed! GIT GUD!"" Bullshit. He's a goddamned nightmare even at level 120. There's no way you beat this game at level 4 without being an exceptional player, and at more than double the deaths your #2 cost you this is proof that he's NOT easy to reliably dodge, and that he IS terrifyingly aggressive."
bloodborne,3depz2,atheer87,3,Wed Jul 15 21:14:08 2015 UTC,"It's annoying, because I had fights where I would perfectly dodge everything, but then the slight delay on his ground pound combo would mess up my timing.  I've never really found him too bad before, but he was the hardest boss for me to beat on this character by a large distance."

bloodborne,3depz2,MrBrokewilly,4,Wed Jul 15 18:19:37 2015 UTC,"The undead giant, especially in cursed CDs is simply ridiculous. All of their variants are dangerous but the spinning ball & chain one is the worst in IMO.  Well walking thu the boss fog door only to be met with a cannon ball to the face isn't good either hehe"
bloodborne,3depz2,Tikimoof,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:59:29 2015 UTC,"Its mister balls thats giving me trouble -.- Never had any big problems with the other two variants once i got the strats down but this prick is just too much.. If im too close, i'll die, if i dodge when im close, balls hit me and i die, if im at medium range he'll slice me and i die, if im far away... well.. then the boss doesn't take any damage and i start crying and commit sudoku, and die..."
bloodborne,3depz2,OIP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU!!! I just died at ""commit sudoku"" (wiping tears out my face :-) )"
bloodborne,3depz2,OOpiumBear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:39:11 2015 UTC,"The cannon version is by far the worst because he can blast the ground at his own feet with a huge AoE that goes largely untelegraphed. Personally, I find the ball and chain variety to be the easiest to reliably dodge. I hate, hate, hate the arm-knife type.  EDIT: I've never fought any of them at level 4."
bloodborne,3depz2,AbyssWalkerX8,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:15:17 2015 UTC,Hmmmmm.... that is very interesting. I have never seen that move-set of the cannon ball version and I don't think I want to experience it since my tactic is to keep strafing around him while taking whacks since keeping your distance will get you killed.  Is there an indication given by the ball & chain version which telegraphs their spin? I always try to go in when he does a slam and get out before the spin. That spin is a real heart breaker if you have him almost dead:(.
bloodborne,3depz2,FighterPL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:44:03 2015 UTC,"Is it the really really big spin that covers most of the room? If so, his windup is a lot longer, I think he brings his arm up higher than normal. Be sure to dodge back at least twice!   I lost an entire weekend to this fucker, and finally just decided on the safe one-or-two-hits-then-dodge strategy."
bloodborne,3depz2,halxy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:22:14 2015 UTC,"i fought the cannon guy for the first time the other day, in a FRC dungeon i made.  was like 'lol this guy, how easy can you get'.  yeah that feeling didn't last long.  just a cheesy as hell 1shot boss."
bloodborne,3depz2,Chilli_Axe,2,Thu Jul 16 00:08:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks :)  Just stock up on BMA, molotovs/oil urns, poison knives, etc. and stay well away from him while throwing everything you've got at him once he gets to the second phase. Good luck!"
bloodborne,3depz2,Chilli_Axe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:04:39 2015 UTC,"Well this is a skill-only BoM character, my bullets deal 7 damage and i've got 1 poison knife and can't buy them atm iirc. I'm gonna need all the luck i can get so thanks! :D So far i'm only getting him to 50%"
bloodborne,3depz2,OIP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:06:55 2015 UTC,"Ah well, that sucks. Still, if you upgrade your pistol enough you should be able to do some damage from range with BMA and Oil Urn/Molotov combos. It really helps if you avoid popping his big blister until he's already at around 50%, because that then takes a chunk of his health off and leaves you with much less left to get through."

bloodborne,3depz2,tombombodil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks :)  Like I said, it's interesting to see the differences. Loran Darkbeast is so low because after ~35 attempts I left him for a bit and didn't come back until after I had good flat arcane gems. Yharnam was a big surprise to me as well to be honest, but I basically had to learn the fight completely on this character, so there were quite a few deaths just trying to figure her out.  Edit: Ihyll Descendant would most likely have been much higher on my list if I hadn't had your strategy to borrow from.  Total play time is roughly 95 hours, but there will be a few hours worth of idle time in there. Plus I spent probably about 10 hours or more of that farming top tier gems towards the end. What was your play time?"
bloodborne,3depz2,tombombodil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:29:06 2015 UTC,"I had a similar experience with Ebrietas in the main game as you did with Yharnam. The first time I killed her was on that character (http://imgur.com/a/HvMv9) so I had to learn that fight from scratch with all of her attacks one or two shotting me. Took about 14 hours iirc, including afk time and farming for vials  Funny story with the Loran Darkbeast - I started trying to kill it as soon as I killed the Abhorrent Beast, and because I didn't know about the arcane gem trick, I was doing about 200 damage per R1. So I went and cleared out Cursed Pthumerian Defilement, Isz Gravestone and Pthumeru Ihyll & got myself a nice set of arcane gems before trying to kill him again. Took maybe 15 to 20 tries after that  Total play time was about 135 hours, but that included a bit of afk time & a lot of low level co op in Central Yharnam & Old Yharnam. It's pretty much my main character now, haha"
bloodborne,3depz2,tombombodil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:01:17 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a nightmare trying to develop strategies for a boss on the fly at level 4. At least when you do it at higher levels you can probably take a couple of hits.  I knew Loran Darkbeast would be a nightmare and couldn't stomach it directly after Abhorrent Beast so did Isz and some main game bosses, then came back and died ~35 times. After I farmed the arcane gems it only took another 6 attempts or so to beat him.  Not really done any co op on mine yet, but probably going to for a bit of fun now."
bloodborne,3depz2,atheer87,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:30:00 2015 UTC,"awesome work!  i am at chalice rom and end of the main game on BL4, have a few bosses i am definitely not looking forward to.    abhorrent beast when he can 1shot with any attack and your own damage output is low is definitely painful, but it remains one of my favourite fights.  phase 3 is true sweaty palm territory."
bloodborne,3depz2,atheer87,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"Good luck with the rest of the dungeons! If you stack physical/bolt resistant armour and a damage reduction rune or two you can fortunately avoid getting one shot by all of his attacks.

bloodborne,3diu45,lolipopapa1,2,Thu Jul 16 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yes there is loads of lore! Not a lot about covenants, there are 3 ""oath runes"" which basically makes you enemies towards people with oposing oaths. Skill is dex.  The main level is 100-120 i believe. But you can invade at any level. There are hunter tools which serves as magic, but theres no mana, you consume bullets upon using tools with ""magical"" properties. If you enjoy magic you'd have fun going arcane but its tough on your first playthrough since you dont get any of the damaging hunter tools early on but you are able to get weapons with arcane scaling though."
bloodborne,3diu45,OOpiumBear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:57:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the quick reply :) consuming bullets insted of mana/charges sounds interesting i'll definitely give at go on one of my playthroughs
bloodborne,3diu45,OOpiumBear,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"No problem! Arcane character will use the feature of creating blood bullets way more which takes a chunk of your hp for 5 bullets. Stronger tools require more bullets consumed. Its really enjoyable to play the game with different builds, going from STR build to Skill build, to bloodtinge build to arcane build, its the same game but it feels very different just from the change of build. You better start getting excited man! You'll enjoy this game for sure!"
bloodborne,3diu45,DocSchlock,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:15:11 2015 UTC,"Yes definitely. A bit more obscure though than even DS. There are 3 Oaths (Covenants). They're a bit hard to find and don't really do much.  SKL (Skill) is basically DEX. PVP in BB is based off Blood Level. 120-125 is the most popular PVP level. Yes, but it's so late game that it's definitely not worth speccing into Arcane on your first run. Making an Arcane character later on can be really fun though once you've gone through the game a few times, but it's pretty hard on the first go."
bloodborne,3diu45,GothMAXMP,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:00:36 2015 UTC,"there is tons of lore and it is very deep.  i actually prefer the lore of BB just because of how dark it is but that's a personal thing.  BB is really a successor of DeS, so don't expect DkS things like covenants.  it will probably leave you disappointed.  there are oaths but they are RP and PvP-centric.    skill is the same thing as dex now.  it's an actual scaling stat again as well and not a requirement one like DS2 thankfully lol  bloodborne's matchmaking system is pretty lax.  it is level-based and you should just stop wherever you feel comfortable.  there is end-game content that you will need to run for PvP in the form of chalice dungeons and it really depends on your personal skill level as far as how high you need to go to cut it.    since it's not a swords and sorcery setting, there is no ""magic"".  there is no MP like DeS either.  there are tools though, sort of like little tricks, there's one that acts a lot like the ninja flip ring in DkS and one that does a sort of force AoE knockdown and some others.  the arcane stat governs your use of these as well as the effectiveness of any kind of elemental damage you deal, like fire or bolt or arcane (yes arcane is also a special damage type).  weapon enhancements like those are done purely through gems.  you have 3 slots on a given weapon that you can fit gems into.  they increase damage by both flat and percentage numbers, sometimes both.  affixing an elemental gem to a weapon converts its damage entirely to that element.  they are extremely flexible and there are some really crazy combinations you can come up with as you progress."
bloodborne,3diu45,Im_Heartless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:59:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer the gem stuff sounds really cool reminds of Diablo in that you put gems into sockets to get bonuses   skill is the same thing as dex now. it's an actual scaling stat again as well and not a requirement one like DS2 thankfully lol   Does that mean I don't need a certain amount of skill to use weapons? Like I don't 20 skill to use let's say a Schimitar?
bloodborne,3diu45,GothMAXMP,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:22:30 2015 UTC,i think he got twisted with adaptability and dex  dex aka skill is still and req. for weapons
bloodborne,3diu45,GothMAXMP,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:42:37 2015 UTC,"it's pretty similar actually.  they are really powerful though, so you have to grind most of the best ones out in the chalice dungeons.  and what i meant by that was, in DS2 dex scaled horribly compared to strength.  you still need dexterity (skill) and strength for weapons in BB but skill actually scales as well as strength does."
bloodborne,3dhoj2,regularsyrup,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:33:11 2015 UTC,"If you have a LHB with 100 + 60 AR and you add a +10% physcial +65 arcane gem, you'll end up with something like 100+70 arcane damage. Your physical % effect no longer does anything because all damage is turned into arcane. Your strength/skill scaling is now zero as well, but arcane scaling comes into effect. Weapons with split damage (BoM, Burial, etc) just recieve the +65 arcane damage while retaining their physical properties."

They give you the chance to change your appearance at the start of the game. TBH, I can't think of any RPG that really lets you significantly change your character's appearance after you start the game, or finish the character creation stage. The only games I can think of that do it are Dark Souls II with the sex change coffin, and Fable II with the sex change potion. However, neither of those really change much; your gender changes, but that mostly just means adding or taking away breasts to your character model. The kind of character modification you're asking for hardly ever appears, so I'm not sure why you're listing it as one of Bloodborne's flaws. Taken as a flaw, most games that let you customize your appearance have it."

Imagine experiencing the tremendous difficulty spike between NG and NG+ without knowing what's coming around every bend. Familiar ambushes are curiously absent, and then you round a previously safe corner and WHAM!  I would suck Miyazaki's cock on YouTube if it meant he would do this for us. It would revolutionize the Souls games by breathing fresh air into subsequent play throughs (at least once, but several predetermined re-maps would be optimal) and massively extending the longevity of single player. On top of that it would relegate NG to the status of extended tutorial, which would blow a lot of people's minds given how famous these games are for their difficulty.  I've mused a lot over the years about how I would switch up the Souls formula and potentially improve the series, and this is the one change that I believe would most meaningfully impact the games."

I've never watched a lore video, read a write-up, and I skip my cutscenes after the first time through (except for The One Reborn's absolutely badass introduction).  All I know is there are some people who drink blood and the gods menstruate death itself, and I'm a narcoleptic sociopath who slashes his way through werewolves and aliens and pregnant chicks and old men with peg legs. Somewhere along the line there's a castle and the covenants don't work for shit. Someone thinks a wheel is a viable weapon and no matter how long I leave the game running it is always night.  So. Confused. But whatever: good weapons are good weapons.  EDIT: And yeah, I realize that in terms of DPR Evelyn stomps the shit out of the Repeating Pistol; however, once I maximize my ammunition with runes and blood bullets it shouldn't matter for most bosses and PvP.

I have gone through the dungeons with strength=40, and yup, I had to deal a number of bosses with skill weapons and wish my skill were also at 40.  Well, it's not all about killing.  Try to be killed--it is fun seeing how your character gets killed, check out all the moves the beasts use on you.  A number of times, in coop, 3 of us, we whacked the First Hunter continuously until he vaporized, he did not even have a chance to raise his weapon once, yup, seriously.  What fun is that?

bloodborne,3dh6h1,ch2s,-2,Thu Jul 16 12:59:43 2015 UTC,Saw Spear is OP. Arcane is crap. Bloodtinge is just fire your evelyn and do 2 moves over and over with the chikage. Moveset is horrible and if your used to the saw spear which is quick dash attacks and very fluid id go with a quality build 120.  I've made every kind possible with every weapon. Quality gives you everything you need. But this is more of a super powered quality. Go 42/25/45/45/7/6  WOW thats OP. You can swap skill/strength whichever way you prefer an go 50/40 depending on the group of weapons you like most. But either way this build is all you'll need. Get the 2 HP runes for +25 HP total. Get the 20% stamina rune and the hunter of hunter cov and your character is a BEAST! LOL hope this helps.
bloodborne,3dfp49,BarryBojangles,8,Wed Jul 15 22:22:30 2015 UTC,"Basically:   You came in Yharnam to cure your disease and the blood you get manifests an Old One's Dream. Because of this, you are compelled to seek out another blood of a Great One, as the blood you were injected with subconsciously wills you to.   As the game progresses, the reason for this is because the Great One's have been trying to procreate via with humans. Almost all attempts have been failures, except one; though the baby that had been born died, a group called the School of Mensis have been using human sacrifices to bring it back to the world, after finding it's conscious in the depths of a Nightmare. The failed babies left behind umbilical cords which helped perceived human dreams to travel through fabrics of reality.  The Great Ones don't necessarily align with each other, and so to help keep themselves alive, having an offspring is beneficial.  Anyways, after breaching through the School of Mensis and accessing the main generator (the dead body of Micolash) that links this world to the specific point of the Nightmare where Mergo is (our objective), we go inside and kill both the Host of the Nightmare and the Great One Baby. Satisfied, we return to our own Nightmare and find that, if we have ingested enough insight (1 whole umbilical cord), we transcend the will of the Great One controlling us and become our own infant Great One.  The End."

The third is technically less hidden, but easier to miss probably.

When you start a new character, all the stuff like gems you collected will be gone.  So, why bother.  With a new character, you should at least reach Lower Loran for farming echoes and chunks.  You don't have to go beyond that if you want (since you've already had platinum from your current character.)  Good luck.  Don't give up.  It's ok to see the tittle ""You Die"" in read."

bloodborne,3dda7y,isochronous,2,Wed Jul 15 18:36:49 2015 UTC,"Here's my fight against the Ailing Loran Abhorrent Beast using the +9 Blade of Mercy, though it's not nearly as pro as yours: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNfIS8iSdzg . The BoM is surprisingly good for taking down many of the toughest bosses.  I beat the defiled watchdog with my BoM in its two-handed form by just dodging through his head swipe, R2[, possible additional dodge and R2 if he does a second swipe], then L2 (retreating two-handed slash) and quickstep backwards.  When he does the lava vomit, just take the opportunity to hit his back legs as much as possible with the transformed R2 (as most of the time you're hitting his front legs and head, but if you can cripple all 4 limbs and his head then you're doing bonus damage wherever you hit him).  Do the same thing after you cripple a limb, though for that you need to watch your stamina closely, as you should do an L2 and then run away as soon as he starts to stand back up so you don't get hit by his recovery explosion attack.  The only thing you really have to watch out for is his explosion move in the last third of the fight and his charged dash throughout.  Both attacks have heavy particle effects that aren't hard to notice, so once you develop the automatic reflex of jumping away as soon as you see them start to charge, you should be able to take him down without much difficulty.  Sorry, I know this was only tangentially related, but I just beat him for the first time a couple of days ago and I'm still excited (defiled amygdala went down last night, but I managed to lose the video after hitting share and then cancel by mistake).  Here's my watchdog fight! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiS8luYBPPo"

bloodborne,3dda7y,LolTacoBell,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:34:45 2015 UTC,"Well, you did a much better job learning its moveset than I did... or at least, a better job of learning its timing.

Now I want to go back down and take him on again!"
bloodborne,3dda7y,LolTacoBell,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:49:04 2015 UTC,"Your timing was not bad , many times you got hit because you were not close enough to him , and you should keep in mind that it will do a counter swipe attack in anytime you go close to him, the swipe attack is also a good chance to hit the beast.  The L2 of BOM is not a really good move with the Beast , every single step back is a risky move to get hit."

bloodborne,3dh0r3,screamin_weenie,2,Thu Jul 16 05:10:56 2015 UTC,"Let's see:   Saw Spear is pretty great for slotting fire gems. It already gets a 20% bonus to beasts and most beasts are increadibly weak to fire as well. Even if you don't focus on strength, the Tonitrus can be a decent bolt weapon. You'll want bolt or nourishing gems. Blade of Mercy and Burial Blade are your best choices for normal weapons. Neither works with elemental gems and they cannot be buffed. Threaded Cane can work decently as a elemental weapon but you should also consider leaving it physical for those rare enemies that are strong against all elements. It's the only pure skill weapon available to you that can be buffed with the Shell. Ludwigs really doesn't deserve that hate, it is a strong weapon but the 1h moveset is innately really weak and it requires some hefty investment to be so strong. if you go all the way up to 18str the Stake Driver can be the most powerful single-hit weapon in the game with fire gems. Throw a Oil Urn at something and then get in that charged transformed R2. if you go up to 20str, the Logarius Wheel in its transformed state will be pretty good."
bloodborne,3dh0r3,FurtiveCutless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:21:18 2015 UTC,"I do like the Saw Spear, played through most of my first playthrough with this weapon, until I started using the Threaded Cane Tonitrus is undoubtedly a strong weapon but I find it boring and tedious to use, if anything I'd keep it as a bolt backup Personally the BoM didn't wow me but I've always wanted to try the Burial Blade (havn't yet) and it would certainly make for a badass physical skill weapon See point #1, I might use the threaded Cane as my main physical weapon until getting the Burial Blade in NG+ I'm just so sick of seeing all the praise it gets for being such a go-to weapon for pretty much any build besides a pure Skill or Skill/Bloodtinge, as a personal preference I'd rather not use it until it gets a nerf Doing a Stake Driver build right now and loving it, the only thing is the somewhat high Strength requirement at 18 True but the Wheel wont be able to benefit from fire/bolt weaknesses and again, high requirement   How about an elemental Kirkhammer? Anyone tried that yet?"
bloodborne,3dh0r3,FurtiveCutless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:31:24 2015 UTC,"Elemental Kirk Hammer is similar to the Holy Blade. It has slightly higher base damage but also a bit weaker arcane scaling.  The 1h moveset is the same, just the sword is a bit shorter. It also gets that 0.6 multiplier that the Holy Blade has when onehanded. This means your 1h AR is basically just around 60% of the AR you see in the stat screen.  When twohanded it makes use of it's full AR and can be quite devastating. Can do similar things to the Stake Driver charge attack when used with fire gems and Oil Urns."
bloodborne,3dh0r3,da-ferro,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:39:32 2015 UTC,"According to the wiki, the Kirkhammer gets a x1 multiplier for its sword form R1s and the hammer hovers around x1.4 (charged attacks hit over x3)"
bloodborne,3dh0r3,FurtiveCutless,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:09:37 2015 UTC,The wiki is wrong. It's described the right way in the official guide: 0.6 multipliers on the sword and 1.0 on the hammer.
bloodborne,3dh0r3,Bobryk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:34:25 2015 UTC,"Just to add: without Strength, you should only be using the transformed Tonitrus. It gets a pretty insane AR bonus from arcane in that mode (I'm at 800 AR with 20%ish bolt gems - flat would be better but I'm lazy)."
bloodborne,3dh0r3,dr_gf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:04:14 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm aware of this"
bloodborne,3dh0r3,dr_gf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:13 2015 UTC,"For instance, would it be viable to carry a weapon for mostly physical damage (skl/arc split like burial blade or pure physical for phantasm shell?) and another for elemental?   Yes, but keep in mind the burial blade is really more of a quality weapon than a skl/arc one.  You get more bonus damage leveling strength than arcane.  The BoM scales better with arc than str but that is mostly because it doesn't scale with strength at all.  The arcane scaling is pretty bad just the same. I can explain how this works if you like.  I wouldn't say that necessarily rules out the BB or BoM but keep it in mind.  Also be aware of the weapons that scale well with pure skill and are also buffable (unlike BoM and BB) are the cane and reiterpallasch (rifle spear is unfortunately not buffable).   How about weapons BESIDES the Ludwig's Easymode Blade for elemental infusion? Or, would this sort of setup just spread my stats out too thin?   Your worry that your stats will be spread too thin confuses me.  You said you don't plan to level cap -- there is nothing from stopping you from reaching the soft cap in skill and arcane.    Anyway...weapons I like for elemental infusion besides LHB.  This is actually a pretty big toss-up in my opinion.  The only weapon that sort of stands out is the kirkhammer due to being a fairly clear second best in arcane scaling.  Aside from that there are several weapons that, between their arcane scaling and base damage will probably hit similarly as an arcane weapon.  Best I can tell without sitting down and doing calcs are the cane, stake driver, both saw weapons, reiterpallasch, and maybe the hunter axe and rifle spear as well."
bloodborne,3dh0r3,LeaperDemonKing,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:05:23 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the confusing ""spread too thin"" comment, I'm just worried that It'd be way to inefficient to have 2 different weapon that scale off of 2 different stats. Of course it won't matter in the long run, but I'll probably already be struggling through most of NG just because of the late-game nature of an arcane build.  And can the Reiterpallasch be infused??? I know it can be buffed but I thought its blood split damage meant it couldn't use elemental gems..."

And can the Reiterpallasch be infused??? I know it can be buffed but I thought its blood split damage meant it couldn't use elemental gems...   At the time I posted that I said so thinking it would work like the rifle spear, which had a notoriously broken arcane setup bug early in the game.  But having tested it just now it turns out you are right -- the reiterpallasch cannot be elemental infused.  So it would only work in your build as the skill weapon."

bloodborne,3dfje4,wessaaah,11,Wed Jul 15 21:38:56 2015 UTC,It's his choice. Push him towards the game he would enjoy more. If he doesn't enjoy a hard game then I don't believe bloodborne is for him.

bloodborne,3dfje4,Cleric2k7,5,Fri Jul 17 20:08:38 2015 UTC,I depends on what kind of games they like.   I wasn't a big fan of Dark Souls 1/2 but I ended up loving Bloodborne. I did not end up liking Dying Light at all though. I just couldn't get into the terrible story and the core gameplay wasn't enough to redeem it for me. A huge waste of money in my opinion.
bloodborne,3dfje4,salamagogo,2,Wed Jul 15 21:57:31 2015 UTC,"Dying light being made by the same folks who made dead island was enough reason for me to steer clear of it. Dead island sounded like a cool idea, and the first trailer was interesting, but it had to be one of the most boring, tedious games I've played in recent memory. I got a few hours of fun out of it, but in my opinion, it started to feel like a chore after that."
bloodborne,3dfje4,ApparentlyGreen,4,Thu Jul 16 00:57:14 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Dying Light immensely and got a good 40/45 hours gameplay, making sure to do every quest line possible. It was undoubtedly a good game and in terms of how highly I hold it, it isn't too far below Bloodborne.  I died a huge amount in both games, so they're gonna have to have patience either way!  My advice is ask them what type of game suits them currently. With dying light you can sit down and solidly knock out a few missions in a set time.  Bloodborne suited me for much longer play sessions, due to the explorative nature, and the frequent deaths. Make sure they play both games at some point though."
bloodborne,3dfje4,ARima00,5,Thu Jul 16 09:24:12 2015 UTC,Satisfaction. I have never played a game that satisfacted me more than Bloodborne
bloodborne,3dfje4,African_Space_Jesuit,3,Wed Jul 15 22:02:21 2015 UTC,"It's his choice. I've tried to convince people to play Souls games: it doesn't usually work. Souls games are immensely unique and I would say incredibly hard to get into, they're not accessible so you can't just say ""hey try this"" and expect them to get immediately enthralled. Yeah, you can mention the unique multiplayer experience, the thrilling journey, the in-depth lore, etc. but none of that is going to appeal to them unless they get REALLY into the game.  So don't try to convince your friend into playing Bloodborne, because that's usually the wrong way to go. They need to find that urge themselves, otherwise they're just wasting their money. Of course, if they seem intrigued, let them try it, actually play it, and see."
bloodborne,3dfje4,DaFronts,3,Thu Jul 16 00:54:44 2015 UTC,You see many players quit this game after a few deaths. At least an easy game like Dying Light won't kick them down.
bloodborne,3dfje4,BusinessPenguin,4,Thu Jul 16 03:09:52 2015 UTC,Tell him dying light Is fun for about 4 days and there's nowhere near the same satisfaction level. Dying Light is a game - Bloodborne is an experience.
bloodborne,3dfje4,tickleshits4life,2,Wed Jul 15 22:48:58 2015 UTC,"Tough to answer without knowing his gaming preferences.  I have never played Dying Light, so I have no clue on its merits. I will say that I had a friend push me to buy Bloodborne when it came out (I was a From virgin) and since then I have become a fan boy and have just started my first run through DS2.  If you think he would enjoy the game, push him towards it.  But be honest with him in that he will die A LOT and if he puts in the time the results are rewarding."
bloodborne,3dfje4,ukcg1985,2,Wed Jul 15 22:09:53 2015 UTC,"Both are great games, I found dying light way harder than bloodborne!"
bloodborne,3dfje4,Zaxl,2,Wed Jul 15 23:01:23 2015 UTC,For me Bloodborne has much more replay value than Dying Light. Once I beat dying light there was absolutely zero desire to play anymore. Its one of those games where you beat it once and it collects dust. There is so much more to do with Bloodborne after you've beaten it.
bloodborne,3dfje4,lastpawn,2,Thu Jul 16 01:57:25 2015 UTC,"Let him play whatever game he prefers. You can tell him why you enjoy Bloodborne and why you think it's a great game (presumably you do), and trust him to decide which he prefers.  Then, if he picks Dying Light, stop talking to him."
bloodborne,3dfje4,Vumsy101,2,Thu Jul 16 10:41:36 2015 UTC,"Tell him that either he'll absolutely love it and be obsessed with it until finished, or he'll hate it and sell it after 2 days maybe.  Only one way to find out, gotta try it, and it's THE try-before-you-die game this year."

bloodborne,3dgcho,shadowfir,3,Thu Jul 16 01:30:43 2015 UTC,"If you're playing a purely physical build they get broken as all hell, offering up to 27.2% additional damage per radial. If you're playing an elemental build (fire, bolt) they can get fairly close to that but the best I've personally seen is 24.8% so far, in my Abyssal gems.  If you're trying to build for arcane damage gems are damn near irrelevant because they practically do not exist. Do a Google search for Cursed Arcane Damp Blood Gems—both radial and waning varieties. Nobody knows where to reliably get those things without a one-in-ten-thousand off-shape drop while farming bosses.  Strictly speaking, the most powerful gems are always Cursed, with Cursed Abyssal varieties being the highest rank in the game. Many excellent gems roll a percentage increase to a damage type and a second randomized modifier (usually + flat amount of damage in a specific element) and one curse. The curses can and will frequently wreck your gems, making them totally useless; however, if you end up with a fairly benign curse and great stat rolls then you win Bloodborne.  Potential curses include   Flat rate weapon durability down (generally awful and absolutely cripples Tonitrus) % Damage VS beasts down (depending on your weapon this can be the best curse or a deal breaker) % Damage VS kin down (same as above: it depends on your weapon and purpose) HP depletes by # (fuck these things) Increases stamina consumption by % (typically 2.8-3.3% with high-tier cursed gems. Most of the time this is what you're praying for)"
bloodborne,3dgcho,Erotic_Walrus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:43:04 2015 UTC,What do you mean wreck your gems? I didn't know they could take damage. Unless that's not what you meant. Sorry if that sounds rude I just am not up on my knowledge of gems.  edit: Thanks for all the info at least. Glad to know all this.
bloodborne,3dgcho,Erotic_Walrus,5,Thu Jul 16 01:47:33 2015 UTC,"I meant the curse can be so undesirable that it renders the gem effectively useless. For example, a gem that you intend to put in your Saw Cleaver (a serrated, anti-beast weapon) might offer a total increase of +10% more damage than your second-best gem, but roll a curse of Damage VS beasts down 13.5%. In this case you're almost certainly better off farming for a new gem with the same bonuses but a much less detrimental curse."

FS never release half-assed DLC.  it's always an ""expansion"" in the old-school sense of the term, like practically a whole extra game in size.    personally, i'm hoping for lots and lots and lots and lots of new chalice content.  i feel like they can become even more sprawling and complex.  i want a chalice where 1/2 or more of the possible ""routes"" in every room are open and interconnected, ones that are 5 or 6 levels deep with rooms you can only access through other levels and traps, and unique encounters like wandering mini-bosses that shift the layout of the part of the dungeon they are killed in when killed.    if it were up to me if it would just be mostly all new chalices and rites honestly, just the craziest kinds of shit filled with new weapons and sets and runes and gems and traps and bosses that all us players have to discover ourselves by digging deeper.  i know not everyone would be into that but yeah, i think it'd be awesome lol"

bloodborne,3dckn7,JesusaurusRex666,15,Wed Jul 15 05:22:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's something to do with Loran. Darkbeasts and Abhorrent Beasts are exclusive/native to Loran, and certain rooms in Loran dungeons are buzzing with electricity. It's established that there are certain variables that affect what kind of beast a person transforms into e.g. Clerics and Vicars turn into especially large and horrible beasts. It could be that the sorcerers of Loran used lightning magics to fight Kin and this quality was incorporated into their beast form. By this theory, the suspicious beggar could be a survivor of Loran, who's evaded death and capture through a lifetime of isolation and cannibalism."
bloodborne,3dckn7,brvtus,3,Wed Jul 15 05:50:41 2015 UTC,"Ooo, that's a really interesting thought. It's been so long since I touched the lower chalice layers that I'd forgotten about that."
bloodborne,3dckn7,brvtus,3,Wed Jul 15 06:38:00 2015 UTC,"There's also the Loran Silverbeasts, which I forgot about, who breath fire on their back legs but also explode into lightning and get down on all fours like a Darkbeast. It seems like Silverbeasts are sort of a middle stage, a ""missing link"" between beasts of fire and beasts of lightning, and Darkbeasts seem to be undead Silverbeasts at a much, much more advanced state of transformation."
bloodborne,3dckn7,dlb---qlp,3,Wed Jul 15 07:12:28 2015 UTC,"but they breath fire with their torch, the same way Fire Breathers from carnivals do it."
bloodborne,3dckn7,Scrubstadt,2,Wed Jul 15 12:55:44 2015 UTC,"They blow the fire from their torch, they don't have any innate fire abilities."
bloodborne,3dckn7,Scrubstadt,3,Wed Jul 15 13:14:56 2015 UTC,"If Darkbeasts are exclusive to Loran, how is it that we find the ones we do in Yharnam? What little lore we can infer about the Beggar would suggest that he's actually a survivor of Old Yharnam(he talks about the curse of Yharnam and mentions the cyclical nature of the hunt, something he's obviously thoroughly familiar with), and given the placement of Paarl  and his skeletal nature, it's probably a similar case for him. What I deduced from this was that the older a Beast is, the more likely it is to produce the sparks of a Darkbeast.   To add to Loran though; Beast-Possessed Souls are almost certainly the fully transformed variant of the Loran Cleric. The pyromancy and the ram horns make that apparent. So, if both are pyromancers from Loran, how does this fit with the idea that Darkbeasts are native to Loran? With this in mind, I actually think that Fire-wielding beasts are native to Loran and that the Darkbeasts are simply a symptom of the scourge having existed there for so long."
bloodborne,3dckn7,brvtus,2,Wed Jul 15 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"Paarl is sealed away below Old Yharnam, making him possibly older than the city itself. If you look, his boss room is actually a pit outside the city's outer wall. Given that he can only be reached from the Hypogean Gaol side, where the Tonitrus is also sitting, I'd have said that he and Archibald are more associated with the Unseen Village than anything else, but we have very scarce information to go on re: Archibald's history.  But, yes, there's some kind of connection between Old Yharnam and Loran, since the same enemies in OY appear in Loran dungeons as well. What I should have said was that Darkbeasts seem to be a product of the Ashen Blood curse, which first struck Loran and then spread to Old Yharnam. It's less to do with age and more to do with the specific strain of the scourge they've contracted. I think your reading of the beggar as a survivor of Old Yharnam is pretty valid though, given all of this.  Another question this raises for me is the nature of Undeath in the Bloodborne universe, since it seems to be mentioned exclusively in relation to Darkbeasts and nothing else.  EDIT: Another thought: why did Old Yharnam produce only one Darkbeast? Perhaps Paarl is a remnant of Loran, brought to the surface by either the School of Mensis or the folk of Old Yharnam, and acted as the incubator for the Ashen Blood scourge that struck OY."
bloodborne,3dckn7,Scrubstadt,2,Thu Jul 16 00:45:55 2015 UTC,"Does it say anywhere that Ashen Blood epidemic hit Loran or did you infer that based on the enemies? I only recall hearing about it in reference to Old Yharnam but I could be wrong. I like the theory either way.  On a sort of tangent; ashen blood is essentially poison blood, correct? This is most evident with BSB and the Beast Patients that inflict poison damage. If you take a look at the Female Beast Patient model, their skin is a charred looking black and their limbs are slim and elongated, and I think this is a result of the Ashen Blood Plague.  There was a thread a little while back that talked about how the Chapel Dweller's condition could be a result of contracting and surviving the plague in Old Yharnam. The OP likened his dark looking skin and elongated limbs to that of the Beast Patients, and if you take a look at the earliest promotional pics of BSB, the remaining strips of skin it has are black like the Dweller's. I think BSB and the Beast Patients are part of the same particular family of beasts, and that THEY are the result of the Ashen Blood Plague.   Darkbeasts seem to be the product of a different set of circumstances, but thinking about it now, I agree with the overall notion that different conditions produce different beasts, but Darkbeasts definitely seem the most powerful and peculiar of the beasts; a sort of alpha-beast, if you will. For one, the Beggar seems to be able to transform at will, Paarl is undead and they channel electricity through their fucking bones. No other beasts in the game are as exceptional.  As a side note, I think it's worth mentioning that both Yharnam and Annalise could be described as undead, but obviously not quite in the same sense as the Darkbeasts."
bloodborne,3dckn7,brvtus,2,Thu Jul 16 03:29:05 2015 UTC,"There's no direct mention but I think it's a reasonable conclusion to come to given that all the enemies associated with Old Yharnam appear in the Loran dungeons, including BSB. A part of the Ailing Loran Chalice description I find interesting is:  ""The tragedy that struck this ailing land of Loran is said to have its root in the scourge of the beast. Some have made the dreaded extrapolation that Yharnam will be next.""  Who is the ""some"" in this scenario? Could it be the Church, who burned Old Yharnam down to prevent Yharnam from suffering the same fate as Loran? Lower Loran's description reads:  ""There are trace remains of medical procedures in parts of Ailing Loran. Whether these were attempts to control the scourge of the beast, or the cause of the outbreak, is unknown.""  This conspicuous statement, combined with the Beast Patients, seems to hint at the Ashen Blood plague being some sort of medical experiment gone wrong. We know that the Church studied the techniques, both ritualistic and clinical, of ancient civilisations in the dungeons, based on the Isz chalice and ACB. Perhaps Old Yharnam was a testing ground for blood ministration, and when the Church realized they couldn't contain the scourge, they burned the city down and refined their techniques into the strains of blood ministration and beast scourge that we know today."
bloodborne,3dckn7,Scrubstadt,7,Thu Jul 16 04:41:53 2015 UTC,"I think it's just supposed to be about dichotomizing the whole beasthood-insight relationship. Beasthood is humanity at its most basic instincts, while insight is enlightenment beyond the need for humanity. This is represented in gameplay by higher insight lowering your beasthood and lower insight raising your frenzy resistance. I believe the Darkbeasts are an extension of this. Note that Kin are weakest to Bolt damage, and so the ultimate, perhaps most pure form of Beast naturally emanates electricity, not necessarily for combat against Kin/great ones as I've heard speculated but again as a design choice for emphasizing the dichotomy.  Now you'd think Kin would universally employ fire in that case but it seems Arcane damage is all the rage for them with the exception of the Fluorescent Flower's fireballs."

And when the poison wears off then throw another and it'll kill them  The safe way (imo) is to attack the kidnappers and run back and down the stairs (they're too big to fit in). So stay away and choose a weapon those charged R2 is a thrust attack (like LHB, 2H form also has a lot of range). Then use your charged R2 attack and rinse repeat.   Oh and I recommend you upgrade your weapons instead of only repairing them. You gain a lot of damage buy upgrading them and you also unlock blood gems imprints.

The problem with the Souls games on PC is that the way you control your character feels very limited on M+KB(this is a big turnoff to some people).  I wish they would change it to fit people who don't want to use a controller.  The main issue is that you can't face your character forward and cast/attack while backpedaling.  When you try to back up, your character turns and runs away.  The whole lockon system just doesn't work well for a KB+M.  that's my only reasoning for the Souls games being bad on PC."

Game loading up slow? why not put in an ssd or better gaming specific ram. Is the games AA crap? slap in an extra graphics card and run it at 4k and see all the jaggies go away. Game run at weird inconsistent frame rates? that new extra graphics card will make the game run like butter. Game running at 30fps instead of 60? someone will make a fix for that.  Its not a matter of game, but a matter of platform. Games these days dont get much better after they have the approval of sony or microsoft and come out. Example is the master-chief collection is still broken as hell for a lot of players, and with bloodbourne the loadtimes went from ""oh well at least I can go make myself a sandwich"" to ""well I think ill pour myself a drink and come back"". Some of this is due to the closed hardware of the consoles, witch is also one of the main sticking ponts for having one."

Blood may have influenced their minds but i'd say thats about it, they haven't turned beast.

bloodborne,3dcwif,BorneByTheBlood,3,Wed Jul 15 16:45:00 2015 UTC,"Amelia is one of my favorite characters, my theory on her, given how little there is to go off of, is that she was a kind and devote woman who used what little power she has to use her God to hold on, until someone who she trusted could kill her arrived, because her morals and lifestyle forged her into such a strong woman she could suffer for what must have felt like ages to avoid hurting any of the citizens of Yharnam. It is highly possible she didn't even know of the outside plague reaching this point, as she was likely holding off her transformation for the entire duration of the Hunt until we arrived, yet even in madness her formed aids are loyal to this woman, impeding or preventing our ascension to the Grand Church. Someone so kind that even in madness has the loyalty of her followers.       I have little to base this off of, but given the enemies stopping and pointing as if to call out an intruder and how the don't bother having troops on the left or right paths away from the church gives me the foundation to believe in her loyal servants."

bloodborne,3dcwif,BorneByTheBlood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't watch this video, but I've already formed my stance on some of my favorite little Crow's past. If this was mentioned or otherwise, let me know. I'm more than happy to hear what I am mistaken on.     For staters, the Hunters Dream, minus Mensis, is the only extra-dimensional plane of existence. That being said means, without a doubt, Yharnam is just a normal place, like Kansas City, Kansas, which can be accessed by anyone at any point. Hunters are not all members of the dream, and the dream is an obscure notion dismissed or even forgotten by many hunters and churches altogether, which is why the ""Night of the Hunt"" where Yharnamites will tell you they'd be foolish to open their doors is plausible, because Real Hunters are not an integral part of the Hunt anymore. Our main protagonist is a foreigner who never relieved his illness with the blood healing, thus leaving him the only member in Yharnam with pure human blood, making him the only one who could receive Gehrmans blood which, as host of the Dream, ties you to the dream making it so only your masters blade can end your life (See ending 1). This is the only explanation for why a master hunter chose a weak, insignificant, worthless, and pathetic nobody to join a hunt where the stronger Hunters already exist, just for example the hunter in Mensis with Rose would be 100x better than you at the beginning.  Applying this to Madam Crow, she is an old foreigner, much like yourself, who knows of the dream and even mentions how this will be her final death. That right there proves she was once part of the dream and then returned to Yharnam in its new era of suffering, to hunt the impure Hunters who have been made impure with the healing church's blood healing. Crow survived, as she must for she otherwise would spend eternity in the dream reliving an unmoving timeline until success, and was given freedom from the dream by accept Gehrmans offer. Crow lived the hunt, and now crow hunts, for it is all she knows how to do."

Now if Vaati would say these things and come up with his own theories on the crow i'd be more impressed. This particular video of his is just mainly showing her dialogue and him stating the obvious. Some if not all of his other videos are way better. EDIT: I believe Djura also broke free from the dream. Upon him killing you he says ""I should think you still have dreams? Well, next time you dream, give some thought to the hunt, and its purpose."" which indicates he knows about the dream. But since his death is a one time deal he must've broken free from the dream."

If you equip a torch near the enemies, the first ones you spot in old yharnam, they will cower and not attack you. This may have been why he wanted out on the hunt because he no longer saw the beasts as beasts. Another outsider whom was in on the burning of old yharnam is Gilbert, although he mentions, as he gives you his flamesprayer, that he never used it, he may aswell have seen that these beasts weren't beasts at all."

bloodborne,3de8dz,MrTiny5,3,Wed Jul 15 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"Why do you think the one in FW is part of the one in the hunters dream?  The hunters workshop doesn't allow you to go around the house so you can't be sure if there is one or not. Its just reuse of design. It is ""somehow linked to the nightmare"" because its where the messengers show up but you do not know yet what it does."
bloodborne,3de8dz,OOpiumBear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:16:25 2015 UTC,I think its the same one because its exactly the same down to the smallest detail.
bloodborne,3de8dz,OOpiumBear,3,Wed Jul 15 16:28:42 2015 UTC,"Of course it is, its just repeating level design. Like both iosefkas being indentical since theres no further idea in creating two different characters when you only see one of them. Many of the trees in the woods are similar aswell, why created 100 different trees when you can re-use the same 10 and turn them around and such?"
bloodborne,3de8dz,OOpiumBear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:33:25 2015 UTC,Yes bit its the only other one in the game. It seems intentional to me.
bloodborne,3de8dz,OOpiumBear,2,Wed Jul 15 16:34:34 2015 UTC,It could be because Gehrman was once at Byrgenwerth which is in the forbidden woods. He may have remembered it and made it part of the dream.
bloodborne,3de8dz,OOpiumBear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:37:47 2015 UTC,Are you sure its the only other one? Would you mind pointing me in the direction of where it is in the FW? I believe at the time where Gherman was a hunter himself he wasn't the watcher of the dream. Also i don't think he has otherworldly power to link a stump to the nightmare.

bloodborne,3d9de1,ElysiumTan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:30:55 2015 UTC,I still dont buy Rom was a previous Byrgenwerth scholar.  For all we know when the Kosmos granted Rom eyes she could have turned into Amygdala.
bloodborne,3d9de1,MrFlibblesVeryCross,7,Tue Jul 14 16:28:31 2015 UTC,"IMO Rom was probably a scholar since we also find Rom in the chalice dungeons, and this is likely a Pthumerian who was likewise gifted with eyes by Kos (or some say Kosm). Also it seems to me that given time Rom would mature into an Ebrietas-like state, just based on the caterpillar/butterfly relationship between the two, and the Rom-like husk (or cocoon) in Ebrietas' chamber. This would also explain why Ebrietas is in the chalice dungeons, and gives insight into how the church found Ebrietas in the first place. That's just my 2 cents though"
bloodborne,3d9de1,Honestly--Fair,7,Tue Jul 14 17:40:46 2015 UTC,"Oh woh, heard 'spider of byrgenwerth' and just thought spider, but now that you mention it, Rom certainly looks more like a grub or caterpillar than a spider!"
bloodborne,3d9de1,ElysiumTan,6,Tue Jul 14 18:18:16 2015 UTC,"On the ""Rom would eventually transform into an Ebrietas-like state"", I'd like to argue that maybe even Ebrietas is not yet finished transforming. If you subscribe to the "" the healing church cut open Ebrietas from her mid back to under her chin with two, diagonal cuts"" theory like I do, it's possible that the wings and tentacles exposed from said cut were still growing inside her body and were not yet ready. Note how she's only capable of very short flight; maybe in her fully transformed form, she's able to fly for much greater lengths of time"

bloodborne,3d9de1,pien11,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:36:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's hard to prove that one. Of note though is that in the altar of despair in front of ebrietas there is a body of some ascended follower that has the same odd looking head as the rom spiders, as amygdala that apparently turned into that for the price of the knowledge bestowed upon them. So that appears to be how humans turn when bestowed with great one knowledge.  So ROM would be a major breakthrough for them, if he is a previous scholar. Seeing he's the only one I think it unlikely they made him then stopped."

bloodborne,3d9oe5,prinex,30,Tue Jul 14 16:18:38 2015 UTC,Makes the whole Short Root useless IMO.   It just takes away the unintended use it had. I think From meant for SRRC to be a way of skipping layers not dungeons. Skipping layers one and two to help your friend on layer 3 is cool; skipping 5 dungeons to get the achievement is not.
bloodborne,3d9oe5,x_stickman_x,12,Tue Jul 14 16:27:13 2015 UTC,It shouldn't require you to grind all the dungeons all over again on every new character though.
bloodborne,3d9oe5,Lhox,5,Tue Jul 14 16:46:02 2015 UTC,For what it is worth The Bloodborne Sheets do contain 10 standard chalice glyphs for jolly co-op.  If we all create unique glyphs we will only meet via SRRC it's chaos.  I miss the skip feature too but if we all have at least the 3 depth 5 glyphs it's not that bad.
bloodborne,3d9oe5,Enterres,3,Tue Jul 14 17:08:32 2015 UTC,It's not that bad; it can easily be cleared in a day.

bloodborne,3d9oe5,won_vee_won_skrub,4,Tue Jul 14 22:55:26 2015 UTC,What? It is necessary to grind through dungeons on every new character if you want access to all the dungeons on that character.  How is it not necessary?

bloodborne,3d9oe5,won_vee_won_skrub,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:06:16 2015 UTC,"Well, it is the only way to get the best gems and the best runes.  The comparison would be having the best upgrade materials and spells in DS1 gated behind a grindfest of dungeons. You just can't make your character the best it can be without grinding through the dungeons every time.  If there were another way of getting the gems and runes, that would be completely fine with me, but the way it is now, the majority of the community would very much like it changed."
bloodborne,3d9oe5,Lhox,6,Tue Jul 14 23:21:04 2015 UTC,"You can still have competitive gems from Mensis. They're not going to be top tier, but it's not the end of the world for your pvp build if you don't have the best of the best"

bloodborne,3d9oe5,Lhox,3,Tue Jul 14 23:54:02 2015 UTC,You can get good gems in the story and you don't need everything to be top-tier on all builds.

bloodborne,3d9oe5,Lhox,5,Tue Jul 14 23:57:01 2015 UTC,"The DS1 comparison would only make sense if you could upgrade weapons to +25, and you could easily get +15 in the main game. Yeah, it's a pain for PvP or higher NG levels, and I'm not sure that the bloodgems or chalice dungeons were necessarily the best thought-out, but nobody really needs more than 5 or 6 PvP characters, and you had weeks to take care of that before they patched it."
bloodborne,3d9oe5,kingchess33,4,Tue Jul 14 23:31:52 2015 UTC,"and you had weeks to take care of that before they patched it.   Now that's just a flawed argument. There are people who didn't play the game before it was patched and people who return to the game after a while, or someone just wants to make a new character for PvP. Just because there was a time when it was possible to skip some of the grind, doesn't make it ok that the grind is necessary now.  The comparison does make sense, you either grind and get the best available to you, or you don't and you have an inferior build."

bloodborne,3d9oe5,clayblooper,18,Tue Jul 14 19:05:28 2015 UTC,"They need to make chalice dungeons account universal. You play through once, all your characters get the access to the dungeons you've unlock."

bloodborne,3d9oe5,OIP,2,Wed Jul 15 00:05:04 2015 UTC,If you can farm max tier gems with a level 15 character then you deserve to twink.  I'm suggesting dungeons open to all your characters if you have completed them. I didn't suggest a shared stash where you can share items between all your characters.   If you want to twink maxed out gears with a level 15 character then you gotta grind the gears with your level 15 character
bloodborne,3d9oe5,FF13LightningReturns,3,Wed Jul 15 01:02:25 2015 UTC,it's a lot easier to cheese a couple depth 5 FRC bosses and mobs with a level 15 character than it is to open all the dungeons with that character.    personally i think they should just scrap depths 1-2 so that it starts with 3 at endgame level content but that's never going to happen.
bloodborne,3d9oe5,OIP,2,Wed Jul 15 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"it is not hard to farm high-tier gems with a level 15 char in a FRC.  oh look, here's an enemy with a red aura!  sneak up behind it, visceral it, collect goods.  no gem?  rinse and repeat.    and that's only if you can't handle cheesing the boss."

bloodborne,3d9oe5,townportal,8,Tue Jul 14 23:40:46 2015 UTC,Yeah on one hand it sucks that you can't skip all that crap anymore but on the other hand it also is good because skipping all that crap made all that content useless. I think the change is good overall but they also should have changed the requirements of the dungeons as well. Everything from Depth 1-3 dungeons are pointless grind. They could have easily just had you do one of each of the depths 1-4 once each and then leave depth 5 as is and drastically improve the grind.   I had already done everything twice on two characters and I just can't bring myself to do it for my third character.
bloodborne,3d9oe5,EmptyHeadedArt,2,Tue Jul 14 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"I completely agree....grinding through to unlock ALL the chalices, and grind materials...i did it twice....don't think i can bear to do it again"

bloodborne,3d9oe5,Ralonne,3,Tue Jul 14 20:25:58 2015 UTC,"Hmmm this does reduce the usability of the SRRC.

bloodborne,3d9oe5,MrBrokewilly,3,Tue Jul 14 16:29:39 2015 UTC,"It seems to me this is going to make SRRC-based hosting or joining even more difficult since you've severely decreased the number of possible matches.    On the other hand there is a possible positive outcome.  Perhaps this will motivate more people to open their own chalices instead of just joining via SRRC.  That would mean an increase in the number of possible hosts.  Perhaps From's data showed that there were always many more people wanting to join via SRRC than there were people waiting for help in the dungeons.  IF this change increases the number of possible hosts, then perhaps (not immediately, but after some time) this will decrease the wait to join via the SRRC."

bloodborne,3d9oe5,Blackdeath_663,4,Wed Jul 15 01:38:50 2015 UTC,"This is the exact OPPOSITE direction I was hoping they'd take chalices. It is an absolute chore to redo all the dungeons just to get access to the best gems; it is also a huge disappointment not to have access to all weapons at the start of a game. Neither of these issues would be that big of a deal if all the weapons WERE available at the outset of the game, either.    Sucks. I was hoping for dungeon accessibility across your account once you cleared them with one character. I just don't see a reason to not provide this option, ESPECIALLY since there isn't a respec option for your character, dooming each build/character to have to redo all the less savory parts of the chalices."
bloodborne,3d9oe5,stale_ennui,2,Tue Jul 14 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"There are people who I expect would really like this change. If you've ever watched any of DarkLordSen's streams, he's never liked that he and others had to grind the dungeons from the Depth 1's to the Depth 5's to get all the good loot and then later when the mechanics of the SRRC were better understood others started to just go directly to all that good loot through the SRRC. But I always felt that the SRRC allowing access to later dungeons was very important for PvPers as they make other builds. So, really I think this change is consistent with the rest of the game in discouraging people to make more builds, which is just a terrible decision in my opinion..."
bloodborne,3d9oe5,SirBrotherBob,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:26:44 2015 UTC,This explains why I only enter low level dungeons with SRRC now ....I don't want to go through all the dungeons on all my characters. I went through them once now I just want to do random ones with random builds....and not suffer through them again. In fact randomly joining and helping people in dungeons is what I do 95% of the time when I play BB. The other 5% is helping people I see in Huntersbell. The patch pretty much killed this game for me until the DLC comes out.
bloodborne,3d9oe5,SIRTreehugger,2,Tue Jul 14 23:04:19 2015 UTC,"I do the exact same. Such a shame, had the possibility of boosting coop in dungeons, but instead neutered it."

Sheeeeeeeeeeeeesh, I'm happy I got in and stayed in a Defiled one I co-op SRRC'd to and got the Phumeru Ihyll outta that without having to do everything else.  But alright. I accept it. It's like becoming a dickwraith in DS1 as a real lowlevel-lowbie character, you need to put work into it, a good bit of work."

bloodborne,3d9oe5,BustaBen88,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:05:20 2015 UTC,"They really need to add a way to skip the grind on every single new character, it's just completely stupid that it's how it works.  It would be easy enough to put it behind a gate (can't do it unless you've done it on at least one character, and even then you need to have killed the Wet Nurse or something similar), which would prevent people from overpowering themselves early on."
bloodborne,3d9oe5,Lhox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:45:04 2015 UTC,"This change makes me sad. SRRC's ability to take you places you don't have the chalice for has been invaluable for me.  On my first playthrough, I missed the living string off the brain of mensis. The only way I was able to progress through the chalice dungeons (without going to NG+) was to SRRC my way into someone else's Pthumeru Ihyll dungeon. I also missed the Upper Cathedral key and used SRRC to do the first Isz dungeon.  Not to mention that I was able to fight hard bosses, get a lot of blood echoes, and farm chunks from helping others in layer 5 dungeons while I was still stuck on defiled watchdog.  I enjoy helping people and it sounds like this will limit the number of people I can play with until I grind my way through all the dungeons. I'm on my second character and making my way through chalice dungeons I'm really going to miss this."

bloodborne,3d9oe5,T00N,0,Tue Jul 14 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"Since Drangleic almost everything has been pushing towards being more ""accessible,"" i politely disagree. I miss when you were dropped in a random mob in a random place in the dungeon. Good times."
bloodborne,3d9oe5,Enterres,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"This is going to seriously decrease the amount of co-op in chalice dungeons, if only people who have that particular chalice can help you out.   It's like they took a long hard look at chalice dungeons, and decided to reduce the most fun and useful aspects of them while increasing the tedium required to get through them."
bloodborne,3d9oe5,RLWC,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:15:20 2015 UTC,"I had hoped the new patch had made coop easier?  Passwords never did much for me... or the people on my friendlist.  I coulçd use some help in the dungeons. I'm at the end of my rope with abhorrent beast.  When I get him on his ""final form"" I always die to his jumping attacks."
bloodborne,3dd5y6,cooperisduhace,2,Wed Jul 15 09:59:38 2015 UTC,"agreed, i also notice this in that the first time i fight a difficult boss in a play session i will get a long way into the fight before dying, often down to the last few hits.  then i get annoyed and impatient in subsequent fights and will die a bunch of times.  then when i eventually get through that annoyance the win is actually pretty easy most of the time.  happens to some extent in PvP too."
bloodborne,3dd5y6,OIP,2,Wed Jul 15 10:07:23 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. You have to find a rhythm for most bosses. It's pretty rare that I end up beating a boss with very little health/vials left (though it has happened). I either get completely destroyed by the boss, or, when I can finally win, I am almost untouched because I can find that rhythm, or ""zone"". Though sometimes it takes many, many attempts before I can get to that point!"
bloodborne,3dd5y6,JimmyAxel,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:10:40 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with the flow state of mind, to me i always like to play while paying great attention to in-game music so for example i really liked Gascoigne's fight as it appeared like a choreography and the music really was fitting his attacks and i joined in the rythm and it was just like a dance."
bloodborne,3dd5y6,Funkyman247,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:05:02 2015 UTC,"Sometimes what I need to do is fuck up royally and roll around in sheer panic, dodging attacks by luck alone until I can find a safe corner to heal and piss in. Repeat as necessary. If this refuses to work, significant over leveling is a reliable solution.  These strategies have worked for me more times than I can recall, although I probably have an overall win-loss-ratio of like sandwich:12."

bloodborne,3dbtpu,AustrianChevalier,27,Wed Jul 15 01:30:39 2015 UTC,"Gascoigne is an amazing summary of beast hunters and the central conflict of their kind, both in a lore sense and in a gameplay sense. Interactions with Gascoigne's daughter and the discovery of his wife's corpse lend the battle a kind of significance most bosses struggle to reach. On the music box, note that Gascoigne's daughter says that she plays it ""when daddy forgets us"" -- like a normal occurrence. When we meet Gascoigne, he's busy dismembering a corpse, attacking us preemptively under the assumption that we're on our way to beasthood. His calculation, in his own near-beast state, is that it would be better to kill us now and nip the problem in the bud. He doesn't hesitate, no second thoughts; we're given the implication that the titular bloodborne condition has influenced his judgement too severely.   So we jump to exactly the same conclusion Gascoigne does about us -- that he is beyond help, and the best thing to do is to kill him before beasthood takes hold completely. After all, his daughter warned us previously about ""when he forgets"". Bloodborne holds the mirror up to us from the beginning of the game, but this scenario is our first dramatic hint about the nature of the beast hunt, and how hunters relate to both others of their kind and beasts. One doesn't have to understand all of Bloodborne's lore (or even much of it) to get the sense that, somewhere in the chaos of the hunt, we came too close to resembling what we were meant to hunt. It only take a little more curiosity to learn that this isn't just common, but the assumed fate of most hunters.   In a mechanical sense, the Gascoigne fight upholds the same ""dark mirror"" concept by mostly using attacks available to players through the Hunter's Axe. This might seem unimportant compared to the more traditional dramatic techniques of the battle's setup, but this is our gameplay reminder that Gascoigne is meant to be one of us, and particularly pertinent if one has been using the Hunter's Axe themselves.  Until he transforms, he can't do anything you potentially couldn't. He's stronger and more resilient, for sure, but ultimately possesses no absolute advantage that can't be reasonably accounted for by playing tightly. The transformed state is even more powerful, able to break gravestones with its attacks -- a nice double communication that tells you how much more powerful this form is, but also indicates that the previous defensive measure of hiding behind gravestones won't work any longer. Gascoigne's transformed state, critically, serves to legitimise our assumptions about him and deflect the doubt cast upon our actions by Gascoigne. As the lore in later areas will suggest, however, Gascoigne's moral and behavioural impairments when we meet him didn't necessarily take all his powers of observation.  Gascoigne, his relatives, and his battle do an elegant job of showcasing one of the game's core conflicts. If there's any particular genius to it, though, it must be the deception that comes with defeating Gascoigne. As gamers, we're taught that conflicts are usually resolved with boss battles (despite the Souls games playing us time and time again), but the defeat of Gascoigne becomes a false conclusion. We believe we've slain the beast, but we've just been introduced to a particular, recurrent truth about beasts, hunters, and the hunt itself. Just as Gehrman's warning that we should think of things as a ""bad dream"" concerns the whole game rather than just the cut-scene before we awaken, Gascoigne's accusations, behaviour, relationships, and in-game combat style are less a self-contained narrative entity and more context for the conflicts ahead -- both mechanically and dramatically."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,Trollhoffer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:12:50 2015 UTC,Well spoken.
bloodborne,3dbtpu,Crotalus13,8,Wed Jul 15 17:29:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of the bosses in this game do that for me. Gascoigne, Logarius, Gehrman, Ebrietas, Depth 5 Amygdala, Abhorrent Beast, Loran DarkBeast, Depth 5 Watchdog, Pthumerian Descendant, Pthumerian Elder, and Yharnam.   In terms of story, Gehrman, Yharnam, Logarius and Ebrietas are similarly important figures but none with the amount of interactivity(I.e. the music box) as Gascoigne."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,Scrubstadt,4,Wed Jul 15 01:43:31 2015 UTC,"I think I agree. I feel like he is one of the most tense and engaging fights.  Others are more challenging and thus you are engaged due to having to survive, but the fight with Papa G has a crazy ambience about it.   The graveyard, the music, the cinematic, the story behind it, and the 2 phases are awesome. The music box also adds to this. Makes me remember that papa G was a somewhat normal human until recently, and it makes everything more tragic.  While I think some fights might be more fun in terms of mechanics and the ""rhythm"",for lack of a better term this one, as a whole, takes the cake."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,gwaybz,3,Wed Jul 15 02:36:58 2015 UTC,Gehrman and Abhorrent Beast both do this for me
bloodborne,3dbtpu,Chilli_Axe,2,Wed Jul 15 02:02:45 2015 UTC,"Bosses I liked in terms of both difficulty and design: Gascoigne, Logarius, Gehrman, Moon Presence, Defiled Watchdog, Bloodletting Beast, Abhorrent Beast.  Bosses I liked only in terms of atmosphere: Witch of Hemwick, One Reborn, Micolash, Yharnam.  Top 3 for me are probably Gascoigne, Abhorrent Beast, Defiled Watchdog. Gehrman and Moon Presence follow close behind.  The fight with Gascoigne feels amazing if you actually keep it fast paced and trade blow for blow rather than holding back and waiting for an opening. It feels like a reckless abandon type of fight with a real player."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,Lhox,2,Wed Jul 15 01:50:28 2015 UTC,"The best boss I feel is most certainly Gehrman, though he wasn't that hard.  I do agree that Gascoigne has a blood-pumping feel to the fight, though once you've beaten him once he's never really hard again, except possibly the last form.  Bosses that I found hard enough to actually make me rage at some point: Logarius, Abhorrent Beast, Bloodletting Beast, and the Loran Darkbeast (FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK)."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,PrancingPeach,2,Wed Jul 15 03:44:53 2015 UTC,"Abhorrent Beast does this for me every tie I fight him now because of the sheer number of deaths that I had to go through to finally beat him the first time. I love fighting Gascoigne and all of the hunter (or generally humanoid) bosses because of the rhythm that you get going with them. I also really enjoy the Vicar Amelia, Blood Starved Beast and Moon Presence fights for similar reasons."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,TheRecherche,2,Wed Jul 15 06:45:38 2015 UTC,It'd be fun to see how some boss v boss fights play out.  Gascoigne vs Gehrman first...
bloodborne,3dbtpu,mo0trix,2,Wed Jul 15 10:28:21 2015 UTC,He is up there. I like his design a lot. You can summon him for help in the level before having to fight him. He is a very memorable fight. He has a side quest involving him. He has an optional way to fight him. He has lots going for him. I am a big fan of Papa G.
bloodborne,3dbtpu,CasulPants,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:59:34 2015 UTC,"I played the game blind like people tell me too. Missed the girl in the window. Gascoigne was just some random dude who attacked me for no reason and I killed him over the gravestones.  So for me? No, not really."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,Groundfighter,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:51:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed OP. Best bosses for me are Father G, Gehrman, and Vicar."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,Biobillybonez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:55:05 2015 UTC,"I would say yes. I think the gascoigne fight really sets the tone for the rest of the game. It perfectly represents the flow of the game in general, and it has a very unique dynamic. If you didn't realize you werent playing Dark Souls, Gascoigne is sure to set you straight."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,Jalmerk,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:19:24 2015 UTC,"It was Gherman for me. Going through the hunt to finally see a tired old hunter who was guiding you till the very end, still giving you a chance to get out of the hunt and leave it all behind. Yet we choose to fight and end his misery. It felt like Dark Souls 1 again with the Gwyn fight, the music kicks in and it feels melancholic. Your entire journey leads up to this point and after the fight you can only stop and think till it all hits you, how you and everyone fit into the hunt. And then comes in Moon presence.   And that's just how good it is thematically, the boss fight itself was fantastic. Makes you finally use everything you've learnt so far. I still have a save backed up till the Gherman fight and sometimes I load it back up just to experience it again.   Honorable mentions to the Cainhurst hunter and Ebrietas for making me pull my hair out."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,tokiwatomare,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:03:26 2015 UTC,"I think in terms of gameplay, he's the best boss. The hunter fights through are really exciting and I think Gascoigne being so early was a really smart move. He was put there to scare Souls veterans, I feel. He plays utterly unlike anything in the Souls games and you need to use Bloodborne tactics to defeat him. If you can beat Gascoigne, you can beat Bloodborne.  He's not my favourite boss, though. I love the setting and backstory and music for the boss, but in terms of the atmosphere and character design I think I prefer Mergo's Wet Nurse, Darkbeast Paarl and Ebrietas, even if the fights themselves aren't as tight and well designed. Gehrman makes for a good balance of great gameplay and great atmosphere and I probably prefer him, too.  Really though I think this game nailed it with the bosses. Dark Souls has higher highs, but there's no filler here. Even the token puzzle boss doesn't feel like a chore as you chase a madman around a library while he drops lorebombs on your ass."
bloodborne,3dbtpu,thomasjthomasj,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:59:43 2015 UTC,"I'd say Ebrietas. Gasciogne is just a minor, blood-addled hunter. His family story is interesting but I never found him difficult tbh.  Ebrietas though, the whole weird lead up to her, the lore surrounding her, the straight up difficulty of the fight and then you beat her.... and you get to look at a dead end alter with a Rom looking creature. So many answers and even more questions from her.  The hunter fights are my favorite thing in the game though so Gasicogne has always been fun, but I would say he's far from best boss in the game."

bloodborne,3dbtpu,Biobillybonez,0,Wed Jul 15 09:54:34 2015 UTC,"Just beat him on my second playthrough (not NG+, going for a different build) and damn, had a lot more trouble with him than the first time. That is, until I learned to dodge his attacks forward instead of backwards when he transforms. The motherfucker can chain like three attacks if he catches you, most likely killing you.  Also, the first phase is a joke if you have his weapon, the axe."

bloodborne,3da995,Symys,3,Tue Jul 14 19:26:14 2015 UTC,"As a huge souls fan and an Xbox One owner I finally picked up a PS4 just so I can play Bloodborne. There are no other games on the planet like this and after loving Dark Souls II I had scratch the itch. So glad I did. I'm loving Bloodborne so far. Although it plays a little like Dark Souls I'm having a blast playing this very different game with very different play styles. This feels like a true next gen Souls experience. I'm about 15 hours in and don't want it to end, but at the same time I can't stop playing it."
bloodborne,3da995,xangermeansx,3,Tue Jul 14 20:55:57 2015 UTC,Literally did the same thing when GameStop had a 360 trade in promo for $175 towards a PS4 a few months back.

TLOU is a fantastic game and I really enjoyed it, but part of me wanted it finished so I could come back to bloodborne."
bloodborne,3da995,JonnyBhoy,2,Tue Jul 14 22:08:35 2015 UTC,"TLOU does have a great campaign, but what will keep you coming back for more is the multiplayer (Factions). I'm not a big fan of shooters, especially online competitive ones, but TLOU Factions is really something else. It's slow, tense, and requires so many different tactics besides just shooting. I'd say it's worth a shot, and because of the 15 minute matches you can easily fit both TLOU Factions and Bloodborne in your daily life."
bloodborne,3da995,Siegfreud,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:25:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I will definitely go back and try Factions and Left Behind at some point.

It is the American version so will only work in America (for some odd reason). I have 75% of it done. Def worth a play and looks just as good (if not better) than any other next gen game despite it coming out on PS3. Give it a shot. Def worth $11.99 to play probably the best last gen game. It won over 200 game of the year awards in 2012. Great game.

bloodborne,3da995,Kayar13,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:52:15 2015 UTC,"Took a couple months off. Had only two trophies left before platinum, (spoilers follow) one was for beating Yharnam, the other was for accepting death at the end. I was stuck on the defiled Amygdala and couldn't get to Ihyll because of it. The other night I finally worked up the courage to come back and try again. I beat Amygdala on my third try. I then proceeded to run through the game on NG++ from Vicar Amelia on past Micolash, as I had never before gotten the Living String (I'd dropped Mother Brain for a blood rock but never knew where to go to find her after). Ran through Pthumeru Ihyll, ignoring side areas and finding the boss door lever as fast as I could based on previous Chalice Dungeon experience and instinct, ignoring what enemies I could. Beat Pthumerian Descendant first try, beat Headless Bloodletting Beast second try, then managed to beat Yharnam first try with a single blood vial to spare. Ran through Mergo's Loft Middle, destroyed the Wet Nurse first try, and gave myself to Gherman to witness the one ending I'd never seen, and I have to say, that animation of me losing my head in the dream was beautiful.  A couple months ago I never thought I could do it. Defiled Amygdala seemed so hard, I had planned on farming levels to get my arcane up enough to try using A Call Beyond against it, but it would have taken forever as I am currently BL 240 with 23 in Arcane (only 15 when I had started trying to level a couple months ago). I figure I was probably pretty overleveled for everything, Bloodtinge 99 with Chikage/Evelyn destroyed (Wet Nurse never had time to make clones when I two-handed Chikage at its back). The only boss that gave me trouble was the Amygdala, which I had to use bone ash marrow headshots and a visceral (skill 50) to beat.  I know this sounds like me bragging, but what I'm really trying to say is: taking a break might be just what you need to get past something. If you're stuck, play something else for a bit and come back later. Bloodborne is still as amazing as it was at launch if not better, and it always will be no matter how many times you leave and come back. Returning to platinum the game was super fun. Easier than I expected, but still amazing, and Yharnam was a fun boss to beat, well worth the anticipation."

bloodborne,3da995,chowbogan,2,Tue Jul 14 23:03:29 2015 UTC,"For me the major difference between BB and DS comes down to the number of ways you can approach the game. In BB no matter what weapon you use (and the weapons are amazing and varied don't get me wrong) you're still gonna be an agile hunter with light armor that has a gun and a weapon. In DS on the other hand, you could be a walking tank with heavy armor and a great shield, an agile scimitar wielding caster in light armor, a spellsword, or any combination of the above and more. That to me encouraged more replayability than in BB because you could truly approach the game in a new way. And also there's just less places to go and things to do :P. The covenants felt more fleshed out and unique and encouraged more role playing. Sunbros, forest protectors, dark wraiths, hell- even the odd dragon duel were all fun to make builds around.   I will secede that in general the combat feels much better and nuanced than DS combat."
bloodborne,3da995,Old_and_moldy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:30:08 2015 UTC,This game could really use an item like the Soul Vessel as well. I would like to try different weapons on NG+ and beyond but am largely pinned to crappy stats I focused already on a specific weapon or two. PVP is quite lacking as well. DS2 nailed this with the variety of builds I ended up seeing and trying doing fight clubs on the Iron Keep bridge.
bloodborne,3da995,FugginIpad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:48:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, another thing I know not: actual Covenants!  I love the semi-roleplaying aspect of these games, easy to do with the non-linear way the story unfolds. The inspiration for my most-played character comes from my favorite boss, Amelia.   Covenants, yet another reason for me to look forward to DSIII!"
bloodborne,3da995,clayblooper,-1,Wed Jul 15 02:10:20 2015 UTC,"there's not as many weapons, spell tools, or areas compared to other dark souls games, and the areas that are there reuse a lot of stuff. cathedral ward, old yharnam, central yharnam, and the unseen village basically all use the same town assets but with a few major differences to change up the mood.   this is fine really but the lack of weapons basically means that after a few playthroughs, the early game will be the exact same experience everytime.  the thing about bloodborne though is that all of those initial different weapon playthroughs are worth awhile and the levels are so well designed that it is still a delight to replay them."
bloodborne,3da995,FugginIpad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:14:10 2015 UTC,"I'm at just over 100 hours and I still find it fun. I'm only just now getting into the dungeons as well. But that's not to say I don't feel the grind sometimes after several play throughs. For me, the biggest slog is Forbidden Woods/Cainhurst.  Again though, the combat is so nuanced and the move sets so rich, it's hard for me to get bored even in a CD.   Yes, after three play throughs you've played with all the starter weapons, I agree.  And yes there are only 15 weapons.  However, from what I understand the move sets have been broadened in this game compared to other souls titles.   With the weapons, I think less was put in, but what is there was made with more depth and nuance."
bloodborne,3da995,clayblooper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the combat in bloodborne is easily the most fluid and fine-tuned combat of any souls game, that alone makes it worth returning to.   I agree about the weapons and movesets being more nuanced but if you're coming from the viewpoint that you're making a very specific build, like a STR build for instance, a choice between three weapons is very disappointing (especially when Ludwig's and the Kirkhammer share the same untransformed moveset).   In a way, they really just trimmed the fat, because Dark Souls strength weapons were all great swords (ludwig's), hammers/axes (kirkhammer), and giant objects  (logarius' wheel) but by doing so they've removed any desire to tinker with the same kind of build multiple times. you find enough upgrade materials to try out a lot of weapons, so once you've done one kind of build, you're pretty much done.  that said, there are weapons worth devoting entire runs just because of how different they handle. of the 15 weapons they put in, they definitely nailed the variety for the most part. I've probably played about 100 hours of bloodborne myself but I'm still willing to play more. I just wish there was a bit more to do and see. heck, if they made the game more nonlinear from the beginning, I probably wouldn't even notice the weapon count. I wish they spent time developing more full fledged areas over the chalice dungeons."
bloodborne,3da995,FugginIpad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"I understand (especially on the point that I wish the Hammer and Holy Blade varied more).

Bloodborne is a very very good game,easily my first or second favorite game I've played this year so far, but there are some pretty big miss-steps in the multiplayer design, and the utter and complete lack of self awareness re: why fans play their games that went in to the creation and implementation of the Chalice Dungeons that take away ""perfect"" status."
bloodborne,3dddu0,chilidog17,2,Wed Jul 15 11:46:07 2015 UTC,"spoilers ahead:  If you count getting all the runes on top of successfully completing all NPC storylines, getting all gestures, getting 4/4 umbilical cords instead of just 3/4 and leaving all friendly NPCs alive as 100% - then no, 100% is not possible in 1 playthrough due to having to kill certain NPCs before or after certain events take place in order to obtain their runes or attire (by killing them ;_;).  Although there's no way to kill Eileen and the Bloody Crow of Cainhurst a.k.a. the ""Chikage Hunter"" in the same playthrough unless you kill Eileen while she lays dying on the cathedral steps after she gives you her covenant rune, but that doesn't grant you anything but some extra Blood Echoes.  I usually slaughter the NPCs on my first playthrough to get their runes, then leave them all alive (or kill them at the appropriate time) during NG+ in order to have a more ""complete"" playthrough.  But if you don't consider obtaining all runes as 100%ing the game, then I don't see any reason why you couldn't do it on your first go-around if you knew where to go and when to execute certain events.  It's really up to you to decide what getting 100% means.  If you're on the last boss, then it may already be too late to do some of the things I previously mentioned, so you might want to try to focus on the boss and shoot for them during NG+.  But like I said, it's totally up to you to decide."
bloodborne,3dddu0,fedora-messenger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:14:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say killing eileen is part of 100%. Just completing her questline is, whether its done the right or wrong way."

bloodborne,3dddu0,OOpiumBear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:33:07 2015 UTC,I did everything but finishing Eileen's quest (She and Henryk were worth more dead than alive) so I missed her final gesture or whatever.

bloodborne,3dddu0,rottenbeka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:34:49 2015 UTC,All cords unables you to get all runes though. So its pretty much what 100% means to the individual. If you didn't finish eileens questline you've missed out on an oath rune though.

It would be interesting if damage was based on speed, and that greater Arcance investment meant greater speed. The weapon could scale with purely strength, strength and arcane, or just purely arcane.

It all depends on what level you're targeting.  from my experience anything from 70-90 will get you a good amount of action.  the lower end is better if you want a higher chance of invading people in non-PVP hotspots (e.g. people going through ng+).  you don't really need more than 20 End if you're using skill weapons, and you can lower skill to 25-ish if you want, but more is always better since the skill scaling weapons scale well enough with skill and it also increase visceral attack damage; with 50 skill and two clawmark runes I always oneshot others with a visceral attack."

I always hear complaints about balance and stuff from the PvP scene, but that's not really the kind of games this series makes.  There's no competitive scene, and there likely never will be, but the PvP is this awesome place where you can bring whatever type of character you want to fight the most ruthless enemy out there: another player.  These games are all about challenging yourself, running into some way over-beefed player should be exactly what you're looking for.  It's a chance to better yourself or prove yourself."
bloodborne,3dcdn9,writers_block,2,Wed Jul 15 17:08:54 2015 UTC,"I won't deny that it was humiliating and rage-inducing to lose to another fucking backstab fisher in DaS1; however, the exultation I felt after curb stomping a three-on-one gank squad in the Kiln knew nearly no bounds. When you play like I do you have to accept losing as inevitable, but it makes your wins mean so much more in the end."

I seriously started having so much more fun with PvP when I decided to just lay down on the couch, listen to some music/podcasts/chat with my girlfriend and simply try to make something crazy happen.    A calm, steady hand goes a long ways in Bloodborne."
bloodborne,3dcdn9,writers_block,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:19:31 2015 UTC,"Philosophically, one might argue that he who fears not death fights most recklessly because for him death carries no threat of loss. Self-preservation has no meaning if one truly embraces death."

bloodborne,3dcdn9,writers_block,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:10:42 2015 UTC,"Explaining how I play the game is an insult to me. I too enjoy the challenge of going the unorthodox way but I was explaining why you see tons of BoMs, Chikage and LHBs. Because they scale far better than other weapons and have a good moveset and support many builds."
bloodborne,3dcdn9,goh13,2,Thu Jul 16 00:01:49 2015 UTC,"for me it doesn't really matter. most of the weapons i have are the regular ones you get in game, save for a uncanny burial blade because i was on +4 and didn't wanna lose several million echoes to gerhman. i know this is the mindset most people have, and that's why it's not fun to me. it's completely worth it to check out and try all the other weapons even if their scaling isn't as good. it makes pvp more of a challenge and a lot more fun."

bloodborne,3dcdn9,Erotic_Walrus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:56:22 2015 UTC,"my bad, i might not have made it clear in the post. i tend to ramble a lot.  basically, what i'm saying is people don't experiment and try out all the weapons that are made available in pvp then they complain about there not being enough variety. and that hinders pvp because nobody wants to fight the same builds/weapons over and over again cause nobody tries anything new. and that if we all (or at least a large majority of us) started using all the weapons available we'd see that pvp is a lot more than just spamming L2 or O+R1"
bloodborne,3dcdn9,BustaBen88,3,Wed Jul 15 05:32:47 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to agree with you here, which is a huge part of why none of my characters have ever so much as equipped LHB, BoM, or Chikage. My builds revolve around the Threaded Cane, Saw Spear, Tonitrus, Reiterpallasch, and the Rifle Spear (and I've never put a flat arcane gem in mine). But then again I never used UGS, Batfog, Washing Pole, Chaos Blade, or many other flavor-of-the-week and known OP weapons in prior Souls games.  Bringing a rocket launcher to a knife fight might look cool and induce a few giggles but it's not skillful or impressive, and I'd rather my builds not look like they were churned out by an assembly line. That shit is for the weak."

bloodborne,3dcdn9,BlondeMcGuinn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:23:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the clarification OP and I agree with you but here's the thing: what's used now in PvP is what's viable in PvP. Like, why would anyone use the Reiterpallasch? Fancy moveset? Bullshit, it's an awful weapon. Using it is unfun and gimping yourself. Same goes for not using a weapon that can parry."
bloodborne,3dcdn9,Erotic_Walrus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use Reiterpallasch in PvP because it has a ""fancy moveset."" I'd use it because I'm comfortable with it, and it's more challenging to win with a weapon whose AR doesn't spike to 800+. I prefer creativity to sheer numerical supremacy, and I'd rather win doing something (more or less) unique than by copying and pasting Ludwig's Overpowered Blade Build #367.  You're entitled to look down your nose at folks like me but we earn our wins. That can't be said for folks who mash quickstep R1s with a sword that kills in two hits or fewer."
bloodborne,3dcvzv,bluesman7131,3,Wed Jul 15 07:38:22 2015 UTC,"If you're NG, then you may be a little over-leveled as you probably notice you're killing the beasts with one or two hits, but that's ok, nothing is wrong with that.  I spent over 100 hrs in very very first run in NG, leaving no stone unturned and farming stuff (annoyingly take time to load in those days), ending with a level of 60.  Then, subsequent runs take about/less than 10 hrs.  NG++ was much much faster than NG+, because in NG++ I've gotten all that I need already, just running pass the areas and killing bosses.  It is fun to fight the Bloodstarved Beast in Level 2 of Ailing Loran.  I love this guy.  Then, I just cheesed the guy who followed in the next level.  I hate that guy with all my heart.  Just play, enjoy the game with whatever stats you like.  The game is not all about killing beasts, be killed too.  Absorb some hits and see how the beasts kill you--it's worth $60 seeing them to kill you, trust me, some moves they do you don't want to miss."

It seems like sending people to the clinic will get them turned into blue alien dudes, should I leave the potentially bad people out in the world, or send them to the clinic?  And, I guess this is important as well: Is advancing to night with the grand cathedral going to lock off any content? Should I wait until i've explored everywhere possible before doing this on my second run?"
bloodborne,3dapj8,OOpiumBear,3,Tue Jul 14 20:43:20 2015 UTC,"Clinic or chapel is just what you want to be honest. Though the obvious thing to do, as i did, was save those who seemed as good people and clinic the others. That makes you feel pretty good inside. Also theres only one character thats, ahem, special, i won't spoil who, but you're gonna want to save that one and keep that one alive. Going to night after Cathedral from touching the skull only changes some enemy locations and put the giants to sleep, area-wise everything is open for exploration at any time. The only moon progression that changes anything is the red moon which unables you to save any more NPCs. I've gotten pretty good at answering in a non-spoilerish way if i have to say so myself. Feel free to ask more if theres anything!"
bloodborne,3dapj8,OOpiumBear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:50:33 2015 UTC,yeah this is exactly what I'm looking for! last question would be related to insight. currently I'm just stockpiling it trying to get as high as possible. Is there a number you recommend staying at? or is it just going to mean that it's a little bit harder the more i have?
bloodborne,3dapj8,Stephenfold,2,Tue Jul 14 20:55:01 2015 UTC,"Overall insight will lower both beasthood and frenzy resistance. Very few but noticeable enemies will induce frenzy and they're gonna be tougher for every bit of insight you have. Beasthood is only affecting you when you use beast blood pellets or one certain weapon. At 0 insight you wont be able to level up or buy stuff. Also the witch fight becomes easier since she wont spawn anything. At one through 14 nothing will change. Witch will spawn adds tho. 15 and above a few enemies will gain buffs or a new attack move but thats it. From then on out insight won't affect enemies other than the ones inducing frenzy. 40 you will be able to see the invisible amygdalas but you're able to see these anyways once you've beaten Rom. So overall 14 is the ""safest"" to stay at, at highest. But the new moves on a very limited amount of enemies isn't too scary so no worries about having loads of insight. Edit: oh, and max insight is 99."
bloodborne,3dapj8,OOpiumBear,2,Tue Jul 14 21:00:43 2015 UTC,At 0 insight you wont be able to level up or buy stuff.   This isn't true. You can buy stuff and level up with 0 insight.

If not your second run, then do a third with the guides, or ask on here and we can tell you if you missed anything without too many spoilers.  You can also start a new character rather than keep doing NG+   That way, instead of it getting more difficult, you can just try a different build with different weapons."

It fits well with quality builds.  You might fall of with blades of mercy on a quality build.  First of all, it gets no scaling from strength at all.  It scales with skill+arcane.

bloodborne,3da7qn,GothMAXMP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:59:41 2015 UTC,"On the most basic level:  Overview  There's a bunch of optional, roguelike dungeons in the game. They are made up of levels, with a boss at the end of each level. Beating the boss is, of course, necessary to progress to the next level. These dungeons contain lots of great items, weapons, fights, gems, and are necessary for several trophies. Most notably among those are two gold trophies, one for acquiring all weapons, and one for beating the boss in the last layer of the most difficult to reach dungeon.   Story   While not heavy on narrative and completely devoid of notes or NPCs, these dungeons actually tie into the lore and story, as they explain 'how it all began'. The trophy boss at the end is also unique to the Chalice Dungeons, and very important for the lore.  How to CD  You cannot access all dungeons from the get-go. To access a chalice dungeon, you need * that dungeon's respective Chalice * Materials * A 'free grave' in the Hunter's Dream  The first few Chalices are aquired by besting optional story bosses in the game such as BSB or Ebrietas. Most other chalices are acquired by progressing through these dungeons. This means that the only way to reach the deepest is to play through the others first. Materials are acquired in chests in the dungeons, from boss drops in the dungeons, and can later be purchased from the messengers. Some of them are very rare and require you to loot dungeons carefully before you can proceed to the next one, even if you have the Chalice.   Navigation   Most chalice dungeons follow a predictable pattern: Find and fighht your way to the SWITCH that opens the door to the boss area, then fight the boss. There are usually two branching paths, one before the switch and one after the switch, where you don't HAVE to go, but need to go if you want to find all goodies and materials.   The standard dungeons look the same for every player. Same layout, same loot. But fir each major dungeon, you can and will find root chalices, with which you can create randomly generated versions of these dungeons - with different (often better) loot. There are also things like 'sinister chalices' and 'defiled chalices'. They alter some parameters of the fights, making your life harder.   Multiplayer  The multiplayer aspects are the most confusing with the chalice dungeons. Dungeons you create, root chalice dungeons included, are given what is called a glyph. These can be shared and, given that all player have the necessary chalices and/or have created the dungeons themselves at least once, explored together. You can also invite people to your regular dungeons with password matching, or you can use the Short Ritual Root Chalice (which you will acquire at some point) to quick search a co op dungeon, or browse popular dungeons. It's all pretty weird and you should just tinker with it.  When to CD  It is advisable to start dungeoning as soon as you can. The first chalice dungeon should be easy enough, the most difficult dungeons are recommended for lvl 100+ players. Chalice Dungeon progress carries over to NG+ so you can do them whenever you like, but the process can become tedious, so spread it out over your playthrough.  As for which chalice to get where, the chart has already been linked in this thread. Lists with required materials and how to get them are also all over the internet and the wiki.   Enjoy, and may the good blood guide your way."

In DS you would use a humanity if you wanted to summon, which opens you up to invasions if the boss is alive. In Bloodborne you use the beckoning bell if you want to summon, which opens you up for invasions if the boss is alive.  The only real difference is you can kill the bell maiden and close off invasions while still summoning help. While in Dark Souls if you go undead to hide from invasions you also couldnt summon help of course. I dont see why people dislike it so much.  As for the covenant thing, dont be in opposite covenants? Seems like a no brainer to me. Wouldnt you just summon your friend as an adversay either way."

bloodborne,3d56tt,Enterres,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:04:51 2015 UTC,If you router can support - I recommend you place your PS4's IP address in the DMZ. Doing this decreases the amount of processing the router will have to do to the traffic to/from the PS4. Also takes any UPNP protocol issues off the table. So assign a static IP to PS4 and put IP in DMZ - if your router doesn't support DMZ then you will probably continue to have SRRC issues.  When you see others complaining about SRRC  - mention placing PS4 in DMZ. If they haven't done it - that is probable the cause for their issues. Or they may just have a dirty ISP - just like people have poorly connected home networks their are also some small ISPs which are crap.
bloodborne,3d56tt,rinwashere,3,Mon Jul 13 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"I've put my PS4 in DMZ. Heck, I've connected it directly to my modem for that sweet NAT Type 1.   Still couldn't get people summoned into ihyll."

bloodborne,3dbtma,FeelinTheWind,3,Wed Jul 15 01:29:51 2015 UTC,"Do you mean Clawmark runes? How much skill do you have? Visceral attacks are meant to be a finishing move thats why they are so strong. It really feels like you're asking a question in the title but you're not following through with it in your text, your first block of text talks about beasthood runes and high level chars gets more out of it. This is more or less false since it scales with skill and you can pump up skill anytime you want. Also again, its a finishing move. Your second block should be mentioning your own amount of skill so your measure can be measured up against something else and your third block just have nothing to do with your question. It actually justifies the damage of viscerals on a skill build and makes the initially asked question redundant. I'm not entirely sure where you're going with this post, but some clarification would be nice."
bloodborne,3dbtma,OOpiumBear,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:50:26 2015 UTC,"Well, for PvP purposes anyways, one doesn't always have the points to pump up Skill. Level also affects Viscerals I believe.  As for Viscerals being finishing attacks, I agree in the sense that one Visceral pretty much means the death of your opponent. My problem with Viscerals being too much damage is the fact that even without the appropriate runes, they deal significant damage.  By itself, that's not bad. However, being parried from many weapon's range and being unable to sufficiently punish gun pokes is a bit much. In Dark Souls, parrying required timing like viscerals, but you were rooted in one spot for a moment, and the opponent's option to backstab to counter you had equal damage reward. You also had to be relatively close to boot, risking damage.  Because dashs cost so very little, it becomes a sort of waiting game until the opponent loses bullets. Guns take no stamina; Dark Soul's parry do. This makes visceral attempts more lax. Even without a successful parry, they flinch opponents out of some moves. Again, parrying was not an attack, and you were stuck making a parry if you chose to do so."

bloodborne,3dacgd,kratosgow342,3,Tue Jul 14 19:04:55 2015 UTC,I understand that. I'm just asking why they just limited it to friend games only.
bloodborne,3dacgd,kratosgow342,2,Tue Jul 14 19:07:41 2015 UTC,I think it's intended to be that way FromSoft put co-op function to be the last resort for player who really struggle on the certain boss or invader that's why they make you pay insight on Beckoning Bell because it prevent you from spamming it.
bloodborne,3dacgd,Zaggeron,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:10:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think they put it in as a ""last resort"" -- otherwise you'd be prevented from ringing the bell until you tried the boss at least N times.  I've read the Miyazaki is really fascinated with the concept of random helpers rather than organized coop so it's the password matching that is the special case.  That's probably why the level requirement was removed and, subsequently, why the scaling was put in place."
bloodborne,3dacgd,Zaggeron,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:07:01 2015 UTC,If that's true then what i'm saying makes even more sense because you'd be able to play with more random people since you could scale to strangers levels as well. I hope it was something they just over looked because waiting at the Makeshift Altar sucks sometimes lol. Ive summoned people and been summoned by people that i'm pretty sure were asleep from waiting.
bloodborne,3dacgd,beegieb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:12:23 2015 UTC,"My guess is that for random matches, the game assumes you don't want to fight as hard as you would for an NG+++ boss, yet net the rewards of an NG boss.  So for random encounters it tries to match your level rather than scale you down.  For SRRC matches, the same thing holds.  I don't necessarily want to fight for 10 minutes and use up 20 vials and 20 bullets to get a level 3 gem and 2k in echoes -- I already get matched too often in level 1 and 2 dungeons"
bloodborne,3dacgd,Zaggeron,2,Tue Jul 14 22:01:38 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. Maybe they will.   Perhaps the scaling is still imperfect, so they're testing the waters with password matchmaking first."
bloodborne,3dacgd,Zaggeron,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:38:02 2015 UTC,"I think it is mostly because the password matching is sort of a special case -- It's prearranged.  If you were a high level trying to coop in NG++, you'd probably be unhappy if you were randomly placed in someone's NG."
bloodborne,3dacgd,jerpdoesgames,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:09:07 2015 UTC,"I can totally understand this. However, would you rather wait 30+ mins (hypothetical) for one same level co-op or be able to just jump in shortly after ringing your bell?   I guess there's those two factors... I just like playing this co-op so I wouldn't mind that scenario."
bloodborne,3dacgd,brvtus,2,Tue Jul 14 20:15:14 2015 UTC,I dunno.  I guess it's personal preference.  at the SRRC I play for chunks and gems so being dragged into a level 1 or 2 CD and have it be just as hard as a level 4 doesn't really appeal to me -- unless they scaled my rewards to my true level instead of the level of the CD

People need to go into this blind and play it, discover and learn themselves. Not have the entire game served on a silver platter before they've even created their character thats just plain gonna ruin their experience. Im happy that i didnt know about this subreddit until i'd completed the entire game otherwise someone would've spoiled it im sure."

Djura for example, is entirely grey and perler only makes 2 shades. Not impossible, but probably couldn't be as large and detailed as Gehrman. Same with Eileen, only she's all black.

You haven't let go of your fear because you're no longer afraid of the monsters.  Your fear is gone because you have become one.

Beat Cleric Beast last night though, now stuck on the Father with the name I can't remember. What's the timing on the music box?

bloodborne,3d7nqx,Lukeozade_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:13:48 2015 UTC,"The timing on the music box really is up to you. You can use it before he transforms, it'll stun him and allow you to do some nice damage. If you use it too many times (3, I think) he might transform early.  When hes in beast form, get a bit farther away, and pray you have the time to play it. You could try going up the stairs? Or maybe behind him when he starts his kind of combo"
bloodborne,3d7nqx,gwaybz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:32:07 2015 UTC,Is there a good indicator of when he's just about to transform? Sounds like I might be better off using it just before and trying to mash him so he's got the least amount of health in beastmode. The second he transforms I just get wrecked.
bloodborne,3d7nqx,Lukeozade_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:43:14 2015 UTC,"I think there's an hp %, but I cant remember. I'd say use it more than once before he transforms. Around 80%, at like 60, and then if you see hes not transforming yet, once again.  I think you can even stun him while hes transforming, though I cant really remember the fight very well"

Also whats the best way to dodge his massive dive when you get far away?   It sometimes takes a while to take effect, but just playing it after the transformation works on my experience, just gotta wait out his current attack. Of course, i do  believe if you already used it a couple of times before he transforms it might not work(and might even trigger the transformation earlier) I'm honestly not sure now to dodge his dive attack, as my experience with the Father's 3rd form has mostly been 1)Getting raped 2)flailing around and get a lucky shot or 3)stun him with the music box, back attack, visceral"
bloodborne,3d7nqx,MegiddoZO,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:44:25 2015 UTC,"ow stuck on the Father with the name I can't remember. What's the timing on the music box?   I personally think that the Music box exposes you more than actually helps. Gascoigne is a fast boss, and his arena is cumbered with tombs, wich doesn't make easy dodging his fast attacks.  If I were you, I would master the counter shot (parry) on him. The battle is way easier and more satisfying this way.  Counter him with a shoot, than give him a visceral attack."
bloodborne,3d7nqx,vsilvalopes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:54:35 2015 UTC,I've got the counter shots down fairly well on his first two phases. Once he gets to third I'm usually super low on bullets and vials or I miss one and don't have a chance to back up and heal. That long distance jump takes literally all my hp.
bloodborne,3d7nqx,Lukeozade_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:57:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't bother trying to parry his beast mode, I just focussed on dodging and being aware of my surroundings. Getting caught at some tombstones or a tree would usually be an automatic death sentance, so I focussed all my concentration on knowing where I was and where Papa G was."
bloodborne,3d7nqx,JonnyBhoy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:04:16 2015 UTC,"What's the timing on the music box? I tried it just after the transformation and I must have did it too early.   His attacks take priority over the stun, so he won't be stunned until he finishes attacking or wasn't attacking to begin with. The best time I've found to use it is immediately after a visceral attack.   Also whats the best way to dodge his massive dive when you get far away?   Dodge forward. Like a number of bosses in the game, the dive is to make people panic and instinctively dodge backwards out of fear of getting hit and it's precisely this that leads to people getting hit. It's a natural response to dodge backwards to avoid getting hit, however dodging forwards avoids all damage and you end up behind Gascoigne and are able to get a hit or 2 in, depending on your weapon speed."
bloodborne,3d7nqx,Dimnos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:02:51 2015 UTC,I mean the one where he goes straight up. I tried mashing dodge and just sprinting but he landed dead onto me. I can't get the timing down to just dodge once.
bloodborne,3d7nqx,Lukeozade_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:07:42 2015 UTC,"It tracks you until the last moment. You just need to wait a beat and dodge once he goes up. Practice it and you'll get the rhythm of it. Running is useless though, you aren't invincible while running, so he will always hit you. You are invincible for a few frames while dodging and that's how you avoid the damage and get behind him."
bloodborne,3d7nqx,Dimnos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:18:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I still haven't got the feel for the iframes. Are they set in BB or can they be adjusted like adp in DS2?
bloodborne,3d7nqx,Lukeozade_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:24:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't know for sure, but I believe they are set. I notice no difference in the dodge between my NG++ character and a fresh character."
bloodborne,3d7nqx,Dimnos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:31:26 2015 UTC,"Another thing that can help you: Molotov cocktails. Wait to use them till he's in beast form, beasts are weak to fire. The first time I beat him, I backed off as soon as he started transforming (crouched down and glowing). Far enough away that I could use the music box safely as soon as he was up. Then pummeled him with cocktails. Repeat.  Just fought him again on NG+ though, didn't need that strategy, just used the music box once post transformation to get some more hits. You do eventually git gud!"
bloodborne,3d7nqx,bi-furious,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:28:19 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try it again tonight. My last attempt I played the box and missed the timing, threw a molotov and he jumped up and landed on my head, instant death. I had to put it down for the night."
bloodborne,3d7nqx,Lukeozade_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:30:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, moltovs are slow, so he either has to stay put (music box stun) or be at a decently close range. For the second one I did take minimal advantage of the terrain by running the circle up the stairs and dropping down, then turning around and throwing one or two while he ran towards me. Still gotta watch out for that jump, though."

Keep gaining levels and just focus on the main bosses to get fast to NG3+ if 2+ is too easy. It could be  done in 2 hours tops if its as easy as you say since you, now, know the exact path to take and the ""easy"" ending to progress right away to the next NG cycle. NG+6 is the hardest one and im sure you're gonna need the extra levels to stay alive there;)"
bloodborne,3daeou,OOpiumBear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:46 2015 UTC,"The question is how hard do you want it to be? I'd recommend not leveling and just buy items (paper, etc) if anything at all.

bloodborne,3daeou,sickofdying,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"Really the only difference is how hard the enemies hit.  Around NG+4 everything just becomes a tank that can two shot you.  I usually stop after that.  As for level after 120 I really start to experience diminishing returns.  I have a few builds from 100 to 250, and there isn't a huge difference.  Gems in your weapon and build type make a bigger difference. My level 120 skill build with all 27% gems is far more viable than my level 150 arcane build with the shit hunters tools."

bloodborne,3d5p33,SimilarSimian,4,Mon Jul 13 19:25:46 2015 UTC,What do the beast blood pellets do?
bloodborne,3d5p33,Habanero-Ranch,6,Tue Jul 14 02:26:17 2015 UTC,Every consecutive attack in a row charges a meter that gives you % increased damage so big combos end up doing disgusting amounts of damage.
bloodborne,3d5p33,BorneByTheBlood,2,Tue Jul 14 02:32:02 2015 UTC,"To be more concise, The pellets activate the 'Beast Mode' meter which can give you over 150% bonus damage, however it also increases the damage you take by just as much. Armor or runes are not necessary for beasthood, as they are charged by each Attack, however after a certain amount of hits, available to any beast level, each consecutive hit is merely giving you more time with bonus damage before the meter goes away, roughly with 362 Beasthood you can get 16seconds of Beasthood before the meter depletes. The only weapon that has access to beasthood by default is the Beast Claw found in the Loran/Lower Loran Chalice Layer 2."
bloodborne,3d5p33,-Micah-,3,Tue Jul 14 16:37:10 2015 UTC,Nice work!  I never had a problem with her charge attack. Only had issues with her star blasting attack (can't remember name) in her second form.
bloodborne,3d5p33,BestMonkeyButler,3,Mon Jul 13 23:47:56 2015 UTC,If your talking about her laser attack try sprinting around her in circles as soon as she starts charging up and she shouldn't hit you.
bloodborne,3d5p33,-Micah-,3,Mon Jul 13 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I learned that my third try. I ended up killing her at the exact same moment one of her lasers killed me.  Luck was on my side."
bloodborne,3d5p33,FugginIpad,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:03:38 2015 UTC,"Circle sprinting also works for the charging attacks, provided you are far enough away.   Edit: have not fought her in CD yet"
bloodborne,3d5p33,-Micah-,3,Tue Jul 14 01:07:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of people seems to be good at avoiding it but I've definitely noticed a fair share of people saying it was the only part of the fight they had trouble with so I made this video to show that there's another way. I'm definitely bad at avoiding the charge so this is the strat I always use."
bloodborne,3d5p33,OIP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:40:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a great video. It gives the players hope who can't beat it seeing it, I'd imagine. ""Hey, if this level four guy can do it, I probably could too"""

bloodborne,3d5p33,grabhere,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:05:53 2015 UTC,They are absolutely beyond a shadow of a doubt broken if you can keep hitting a boss like this. In the 2nd video phase 1 probably takes ~2 mins and once I used the pellet I take 2nd phase down in about one.
bloodborne,3d5p33,dr_gf,2,Tue Jul 14 02:35:16 2015 UTC,"yeah it's ridiculous the difference they can make to a boss fight.  like amelia, at BL4 i did the beast pellet and fire paper thing and just wrecked her in less than 30 seconds.  i still don't even know the fight.  same with one reborn.  ebrietas i fight the old fashioned way, though i'm tempted to use this method as she's giving me some trouble in that watery arena."
bloodborne,3d5p33,dr_gf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"Yep, they are so powerful that I think making a full tank character without investing points into damage stats would be viable since they increase damage by a %. Might have to try it sometime."

bloodborne,3d5p33,TokyoAi,3,Tue Jul 14 02:14:50 2015 UTC,"Main reason being that there is a small window where you can bait her to use the same attack over and over and the transform attacks require 2 hits in a row so its a risky proposition a lot of the time. Ideally with this strat you take a fast weapon and hit her only once and then reposition to avoid taking damage. Although I definitely could have used the transform attacks during the bigger openings, that much is true."

bloodborne,3d5p33,Chilli_Axe,2,Tue Jul 14 13:08:10 2015 UTC,first time i ever even come across ebritas i found that exact spot and thought i was going to beat the fight flawless the issue is if she gets even half a chance to use that beam attack she can 1HKO even when you are standing there. she turns here head at this weird angle and shoot the laser beam into her own body getting you from the most ridiculous angle.  maybe ludwig was too slow interrupt her attacks
bloodborne,3d5p33,saint_riot,3,Tue Jul 14 03:35:07 2015 UTC,That is one of the primary reasons the saw cleaver is imo the best weapon for this fight - if she starts casting the magic the swing of the saw cleaver is so short that it gives you time to turn and avoid the magic.

bloodborne,3d9raz,Enterres,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:27:53 2015 UTC,"~~The 1st Watchdog in Pthumeru is weak, so it is more like Defiled Dog vs Loran Darkbeast for a proper match.  Advantage goes to Paarl particularly if controlled by a smart player could easily dodge everything. Paarl's shockwave vs the dogs charge attack...advantage Paarl again - charge can easily miss but Paarl often spams shockwave.  Also the dog is one of those troll bosses you will beat if you just survive long enough as he stops to spew lava every once in a while."
bloodborne,3d9raz,kratosgow342,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:04:08 2015 UTC,I think if it defiled Watch Dog or not I think Watch Dog is still win by far because at least you don't have to fight camera unlike Darkbeast Paarl/Loran Darkbeast.

bloodborne,3d9iw8,mecster09,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, there are a few things you should know:   to summon someone from the SRRC you must be in a public dungeon. You can share your dungeon by going to the tombstone it's on and pressing square (I could be off on this, but the correct button should be listed if I am). You both should be using the same watchword You should select search for coop on the makeshift alter He should use his beckoning bell There have been some reports that the latest patch makes it so that if you haven't created a dungeon of the same type you will not be able to coop. I think the intended use of the SRRC is to skip layers of a dungeon to coop with someone. If you just use the same glyph you must clear all the bosses to get to the point he's at. If you SRRC you'll just spawn in the same layer as him. Glyphs allow you to make an entrance to another person's dungeon. They must have set their dungeon to public for you to be able to get in. Skipping half the content to get the plat isn't cool; either earn it or don't have it."

bloodborne,3d6gvf,d_bert91,8,Mon Jul 13 22:10:10 2015 UTC,Logarius wheel with three 32.6% blunt gems has 1067 attack rating.  I don't have the best nourishing bloodgems from the watchers for the Tonitrus.
bloodborne,3d6gvf,RAZ55,3,Mon Jul 13 22:19:51 2015 UTC,Is this including the spin buff ?
bloodborne,3d6gvf,RAZ55,4,Tue Jul 14 01:24:42 2015 UTC,Unfortunately no.  The spin buff actually transfers physical damage into arcane damage so the attack rating in the menu doesn't change much.
bloodborne,3d6gvf,RAZ55,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:27:08 2015 UTC,Ah I see thank you for explaining   I plan to start a ST/ARC build soon  A lot of Logarius wheel builds seem to only get the min ARC and go pure ST instead I guess that's why
bloodborne,3d6gvf,RAZ55,2,Tue Jul 14 02:05:07 2015 UTC,While in transformed mode some of the physical damage is transferred to arcane without buffing.  I have also found I do more damage in the transformed mode and buffed with adept blunt gems (all the wheel's attacks are blunt) than with three 27.2% bloodgems.  The higher the physical damage the better.  The only drawback is your visceral attack damage is much weaker so I would use a backup weapon with physical bloodgems for criticals.
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Sljm8D,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:13:55 2015 UTC,I will keep that in mined thanks :)  You seem like the kind of guy who would know how do ATK vs Beasts UP% gems interact with the saw weapons innate bonus ??

bloodborne,3d6gvf,treesandgames,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:32:31 2015 UTC,I used an uncanny logarius wheel.  The radial gems is a uncommon drop from the watchers in pthumeru ihyll.  The dungeon I used was pwmf22gu.  The triangular gem was from the watchers in a cursed isz dungeon.  This one is a very rare drop and hard to get as you also could get thrust gems.  The dungeon I used was 5pwujscd to get one.
bloodborne,3d6gvf,treesandgames,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:56:14 2015 UTC,"Ahhh yes thanks for the detailed answer. I already know of these places but I was not sure if they were really useful to farm or not. I just want some good radial gems for my Kirk. Triangle sounds like a headache to farm and I already have a 27.2% one.   Thanks for the info man, now I will farm the chalices with purpose :D"
bloodborne,3d6gvf,treesandgames,3,Tue Jul 14 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"OP, for Tonitrus you have to use Nourishing gems, those increases the buff, the bolt damage and the physical all at the same time.

bloodborne,3d6gvf,PM_ME_A_SELFlE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:11:42 2015 UTC,I would use the lost version as cursed radial nourishing bloodgems from rom and the gargoyles are weaker than the waning and triangular drops from Amygdala.  If you are very lucky you can get radial and triangular 23.1% gem drops from the watchers but it seems to be an extremely rare drop.
bloodborne,3d6gvf,brvtus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"What kind of gems are you referring to? Phys 9% + bolt flat?  Apologies, I only know arcane setups."
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Sljm8D,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:55:46 2015 UTC,Nourishing bloodgems are most effective on the Tonitrus for one it accounts for visceral attack damage.  Only gems that increase physical damage gives bonus to critical.  These gems increase both the physical attack and the elemental attack of the weapon.  The buff benefits from the elemental attack increase.  It seems that flat blot is not taken in consideration for this buff.
bloodborne,3d6gvf,jpomz,2,Wed Jul 15 03:03:14 2015 UTC,"FANTASTIC reply. Thank you.  From the few minutes I spent just now having a look at the sheets, it seems Nourishing is only available in Abyssal form?"
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Nexnatos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:39:00 2015 UTC,"Nourishing gems are drops from Amygdala in isz and loran dungeons, Rom in Pthumeru Ihyll, and the gargoyle enemies in chalice dungeons.   Only level 20 gems are consider abyssal it's just an additional word that's added to the name for being at level 20.  Amygdala and Rom are found in layer 3 or 4 in a dungeon so the level of the gem will go from 18 to 20.  The gargoyle enemies drop gems between 15-17 but at 17 it is almost the same as the level 20 gems dropped from Rom but still slightly lower."
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Nexnatos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:53:10 2015 UTC,"This is amazingly helpful.  How does it sound to be offered reddit gold to literally give me the required dungeons and enemies, and the perfect versions of gems I'm aiming for?"
bloodborne,3d6gvf,AltimaNZ,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:17:45 2015 UTC,"That's fine.  All I want to do is share what I know.  You will want to find a cursed dungeon.  For Amygdala triangular gem 5pwujscd drops 21.5% gems at level 20.  It is on the 4th layer so you will have to fight the watchers, twin sickle pthumeru elder, ebrietas first.  The route to the lever is very easy and quick so the dungeon is not very difficult and doesn't have anything annoying. In isz dungeons it's less common to find bolt as the extra effect so I would go with ones that add physical attack.  For a waning gem I made a cursed lower loran dungeon that is still active and is somewhat popular it's jvz8469j.  The bosses are the blood staved beast, loran silver beast, Amygdala, and the fire staff pthumeru elder.  The gem you will want is a 21.5% bloodgem with bolt as the additional effect.  For Rom the only dungeon I know is v5v5fpsd but it's a little annoying to go through.  Level 20 rom gems are 19.5% and I go for one that adds physical attack as the bonus effect.  Gargoyles I don't have a code for but are easy to find in pthumeru ihyll dungeons I would search though the given lists in the search through cursed pthumeru ihyll dungeons at the chalice dungeon grave stones.  They are usually found in the first room after passing the lamp beacon in a circular room that has the gate that needs a lever pulled to unlock. When you find one make sure to have eye runes equipped to farm it.  Level 17 gems go as high as 19.3% I would again go with the bonus effect that adds physical attack.  I would avoid gems that have a cursed effect of reduced durability as the weapon's durability reduces very quickly even without this curse."
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Nexnatos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:48:12 2015 UTC,"I've just started chipping away at this and the Pthumerian Elder in the second layer of the jscd dungeon just dropped me an Abyssal!

bloodborne,3d6gvf,RAZ55,2,Wed Jul 15 01:09:05 2015 UTC,Over 300 hours of playtime.  I probably went through hundreds of depth 5 dungeons to get every weapon in the game to +10 and have every weapon equipped with three 27.2% gems.  That and tons of high level pvp.  Defeating an invader at these levels typically gives between 400k to 1 million blood echos.  Also there is a surprising amount of high level players especially max levels in the nightmare areas gives very consistent encounters.  I plan to stop leveling at 486 as this is the exact point according to player level range spreadsheets that max level players can invade my world.
bloodborne,3d6gvf,jpomz,4,Wed Jul 15 02:39:34 2015 UTC,"Hilarious that no matter what ludvigs is still numero uno, add to the fact that everyone and their dog uses it... smdh. Now it's a proven point in the min/max game."
bloodborne,3d6gvf,jpomz,15,Mon Jul 13 22:44:01 2015 UTC,"wrong.  what this chart doesn't show you is the damage modifiers for different attacks - the vast majority of LHB attacks have damage modifiers around x.70 instead of say, saw cleaver or kirkhammer which go from x.90 to x1.30.    this means you are always hitting for less damage than you see on the sheet, and once everything is averaged out it's not nearly as strong as it seems if you go off AR alone."
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Zahand,6,Mon Jul 13 22:54:05 2015 UTC,Droppin' knowledge yo!
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Legacy_Raider,2,Mon Jul 13 22:59:39 2015 UTC,"haha well it's classic souls design, in that what you read on your stat screen doesn't necessarily mean jack shit when you slap an enemy.    it's not very intuitive but it ends up being pretty balanced in practice, and i'd hate for someone to go LHB just cuz they think it's the best when there might be some other weapon they enjoy more that is just as effective."
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Ralonne,2,Mon Jul 13 23:13:14 2015 UTC,This is true.  Still its thrust attack R2 in the non transformed mode has a 1.0 multiplier and can deal over 900 damage to most enemies in pve.  The Kirk hammer's multipliers are almost exactly the same as LHB.
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Legacy_Raider,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:00:25 2015 UTC,"nope sorry!  the LHB's multipliers are ALL lower than the kirkhammer's, and by very large margins.  take a look at them side by side and you will see, even the silver sword they both share has much higher multipliers on the kirkhammer.    LHB's highest non-charged multiplier is 1.25 for the transformed R2.  that's lower than almost every single multiplier on the kirkhammer, which average out around 1.4 in non-transformed and 1.7 in transformed.  the difference is huge and even though it is a weird way of balancing, it does actually accomplish the goal of keeping LHB from being a ridiculous powerhouse."
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Ralonne,6,Mon Jul 13 23:10:18 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/a/Gpko9 Taken from the official guide book trick weapon multipliers.  I think the Kirk hammer may be dealing more damage due a shockwave it deals in combat.
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Legacy_Raider,3,Mon Jul 13 23:47:57 2015 UTC,"wow, i'm going off of the modifiers i saw listed on fextralife pages (http://bloodborne.wiki.fextralife.com/Kirkhammer).  these are so radically different that i'm kind of confused.    did fextralife just pull these numbers out of their asses or was there some balance changes made possibly between the time the guide was released and now?"
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Legacy_Raider,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:59:56 2015 UTC,I don't think there has been any changes to the multipliers.  I do think the Kirk hammer does deal more damage than the Ludwig's holy blade but it needs to be a direct hit as the weapon has some kind of noticeable sweet spot mechanic.
bloodborne,3d6gvf,Legacy_Raider,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:08:37 2015 UTC,"well with the kirkhammer what you're talking about is not really direct hit system, its the fact that gives off a shockwave effect.  an enemy can't be hit by both the shockwave and the actual hammer though, only one or the other.  and yeah, i don't see anything anywhere about that sort of change and i think people would have discussed it more if it had happened.  looks more like FL just made up the numbers or got it wrong lol what a surprise eh"

bloodborne,3d9d74,goh13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:08:15 2015 UTC,"Ahhh you seem to know much more than normal guys on chalices and the lhyll skip. I am right now trying to make a great Isz to get my sinister Isz chalice to get my Eye rune. I will confirm if it works or not. Gimme a sec.  Alright, I am in the great isz chalice so it works even on the new 1.05 patch. Never opened a great Isz and I got in one via normal search.   Regarding your question, searching a chalice via SRRC only gives the latest depth you reached. If you need to reach things beyond your reach, you gotta COOP with a real player and I can help with that, seeing how our ideas align."
bloodborne,3d9d74,goh13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for testing it out! Good to know it still works.  So you are saying that I can join a dungeon through co-op, even if I haven't previously made it myself? Does this unlock it for me completely?  I messed up on my main character because I made a Pthumru Ihyll with only fetid and rotted rites, and I really want to avoid having to farm all the materials again to correct that mistake."
bloodborne,3d9d74,goh13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"You will only get the dungeon on the makeshift altar. You may not make it yourself but you get all the goodies inside it until you remove it for another dungeon.  Also, make sure to explore the one you made. Valuable loot in dungeons that are not cursed (50% health) are really great to have in the spread sheets.  Also, I think you have to make another cursed lhyll to fix your mistake so you need 15 RB 5, 15 TM 5, 2 red jelly and three loran bastards to correct your mistake.  Not the hardest mats to farm, if I do say so myself."
bloodborne,3d9d74,goh13,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:42:25 2015 UTC,"If I make the Pthumeru Ihyll with only cursed offering now (since I've already made one with fetid and rotted), do you know if it will unlock all other dungeons, like it does if you make Pthumeru Ihyll with all 3?"
bloodborne,3d9d74,GothMAXMP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"Well see if you can enter a fetid and rotted Isz and then see if you can enter a cursed Isz. If you can into the first but not the second, it SHOULD work because it tells us the game sees a difference in offerings and stuff but I do not promise anything."

Did it in patch 1.04 so do not be mad if it does not work anymore although I highly doubt they patched such thing.  I am big on the SRRC if you have not noticed :p I run (ran, really) tests on it so I know a thing or two about it. In case you are wondering how I can answer your every question :p"

bloodborne,3d7nlu,GothMAXMP,2,Tue Jul 14 04:47:17 2015 UTC,Try the hunter axe.
bloodborne,3d7nlu,tdi293,2,Tue Jul 14 05:43:13 2015 UTC,Saw Spear is the better Saw Cleaver. Try it out. It still has the swift attacks of the Saw Cleaver.
bloodborne,3d7nlu,MrMudkip,0,Tue Jul 14 05:47:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree. In terms of options (transformed mode): Saw Cleaver has a startup horizontal attack (R2) and vertical attack (R1); Saw Spear has a startup thrust (R2) and a startup horizontal (R1). While it may have a Vertical on the 2nd chain of R1, its disadvantage is not being startup.  From personal experience, vertical attacks beat thrusts. In PvE, of course."
bloodborne,3d7nlu,Elegear,2,Tue Jul 14 13:11:08 2015 UTC,"Saw Spear was an easy choice for me when I made my Arcane character.   Problem I have with the Cleaver is that it only gets the 20% serrated bonus Vs beasts in it's non-transformed mode. Whereas the spear has the serration bonus in both modes. So, a Fire Saw Spear does away with beasts near instantly.  Though truthfully, it really comes down to being comfortable with the moveset."
bloodborne,3d7nlu,Grahf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:21:46 2015 UTC,"wat  I thought the Cleaver had its bonus only in Transform Mode O_O Thanks for the info!  And aye, the moveset defines the player! (Well, more like the moves that the player uses defines him..)"
bloodborne,3d7nlu,Elegear,2,Tue Jul 14 14:24:40 2015 UTC,"LHB is pretty overrated IMO. If you like the Saw Cleaver stick with it, but you are missing out on some really different and interesting playstyles. Threaded Cane is bliss once you get the hang of the maximum range, Kirkhammer flattens enemies like nothing else, Burial Blade is just so base level Cool. I did my first playthrough with LHB and thought I loved it, but them when I tried out other weapons I couldn't go back, so don't listen to popular opinion. Their respective strengths and weaknesses also encourage you to be more well-rounded player. I'd recommend trying out the other weapons if you've only been using one the whole time."
bloodborne,3d7nlu,brvtus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:47:04 2015 UTC,"This is too true. LHB is good for speed running higher NG+s maybe as it has all the good stuff and a good mixed damage but it does not have a good move set.   Real fun weapons are the Kirk, the Burial Blade, the Cane, The Claws and the Chikage. These are all fun and have enough power behind them unlike other weapons.   There are other fun weapons but I do not enjoy them myself."
bloodborne,3d7nlu,goh13,2,Tue Jul 14 10:46:18 2015 UTC,"I personally loved Ludwig's due to its simple transformation. It can stun lock big enemies and hit very hard, or be quick like the cleaver. Threaded Cane for everything else though, that whip is too good."
bloodborne,3d7nlu,Auron217,2,Tue Jul 14 06:13:08 2015 UTC,Not at all. There's a reason why all the game art has the main character using the saw cleaver.
bloodborne,3d7nlu,lastpawn,2,Tue Jul 14 10:11:47 2015 UTC,"I've tried to move over to a few weapons, including Ludwig's, but I still just prefer the Ax  move set over everything else, so I stick with that."
bloodborne,3d7nlu,Bokthand,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:58 2015 UTC,"I started with (and loved) the saw cleaver (dat transform attack) and like you, I changed to LHB, which I upgraded to +10.  The saw cleaver was more fun to use, but I found LHB more versatile and offered me a wider moveset. Being able to switch between a quick melee weapon and a slow but powerful heavy weapon gave me a lot of options, especially with bosses. The range on the greatsword thrust attack is also useful in certain areas and against certain enemies.  If you can play the game with the Saw Cleaver's quick, close range attack then all credit to you, but I think you will find more versatility with LHB once you get used to it."
bloodborne,3d7nlu,JonnyBhoy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:09:42 2015 UTC,I played through NG and almost all of the NG+ with Saw Cleaver +9 and Tonitrus +10 but on NG++ I found that I needed more and then I tried Ludwig's +10. Now it's my weapon of choice.
bloodborne,3d7nlu,lovecraftbro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:21:44 2015 UTC,"Stick to the weapon you like.   After you finish the game, you might as well do another playthrough using only weapons you've never used. That's what I'm doing ATM. It's really fun because at first some weapon may appear to be really bad and useless, but once you get the hang of it, it clicks.  I used to think the saw spear, stake driver and rifle spear were pretty useless and lackluster compared to other 'mainstream' weapons, but now that I'm used to them and learned how to actually use them properly, I can safely say they rock :)"
bloodborne,3d7nlu,alispery,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:01:10 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I wanted to like the holy blade too but it just wasn't for me. You are losing variety in the way you could handle different enemies by sticking to one weapon and that's kinda it, a little important in my opinion. Try out the hunters axe, was a great weapon for me to use along with the saw cleaver because of its great transform attacks, powerful heavy attacks and its doesn't sacrifice much mobility."
bloodborne,3d7nlu,pien11,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:56:14 2015 UTC,I like the ax ok too. It just must be that I'm used the cleaver. I love how quick it is.

bloodborne,3d95eo,mo0trix,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yep - create a Sinister Root chalice. Make it open so you can summon your friend into it via the SRRC. Once he is in and has your dungeon on his make-shift - he can enter your dungeon then ring his small bell (with cov runs) or ring his sinister for vile invasion.  There is also a chance you will be invaded by another vile since Sinisters can have two bell maidens.Good luck.  P.S. If the both of you the Sinister CD chalice - then you can create the dungeon, make it open. Then your friend can search for the glyph on one of his permanent alters. He can then enter your dungeon without using the SRRC. This would probably be the best way."

bloodborne,3d4lrn,Abyss_walking,21,Mon Jul 13 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"A couple clarifications, and some suggestions from me, a long, long, long time Lovecraft fanatic.  Yes, Lovecraft was very racist, and before you attribute it to being a product of his time period, he was racist even moreso than his peers.  Lovecraft's racism was, as the OP points out, specifically Xenophobic.  Lovecraft did not believe that biologically speaking there was anything inferior about certain peoples, instead he believed that the White, Anglo, English and American culture was the superior culture of the world.  Lovecraft had no issues with people of different cultures provided they ""assimilated properly.""  He married a Jewish woman, for example, because he felt she had appropriately accepted the White Anglo culture as the superior culture.  So yes, Lovecraft was a big ol' racist, but it's very important in the context of his works that he is not speaking biologically but instead is speaking culturally, which is a subject that will come up time and time again in his writing.  As for his works, you list a very good selection, though I can't help but notice you've omitted Shadow over Innsmouth, one of his absolute greatest works of all time.  And for people who are interested in learning more about what the hell a 'dream' is in Bloodborne, I would suggest especially reading the Dream Cycle of Lovecraft's work.  The OP brings up The Outsider, which is a very excellent example, but there is also The White Ship which can draw parallels to Bloodborne's dreamlands.  Oh, and there's a very short (even for his standards) story that he wrote called What the Moon Brings.  I would suggest it, for obvious reasons.   Edit: And after writing this, I see that the OP has already added in all the relevant works I mentioned.  Such is life :D"
bloodborne,3d4lrn,dmcredgrave,3,Mon Jul 13 14:40:58 2015 UTC,"I've always wanted to read Lovecraft, especially after playing bloodborne. Could you tell me what his must reads are?"
bloodborne,3d4lrn,_georgesim_,5,Mon Jul 13 16:50:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, I feel like all of his works are must read.  But if you don't have that kind of time, the true MUST reads include Shadow over Innsmouth, The Outsider, The Nameless City, and of course The Colour Out of Space.  The problem with reading only select portions of Lovecraft is that more than any other author I can think of, all of his works sort of mesh together to tell one grand story."
bloodborne,3d4lrn,dmcredgrave,3,Mon Jul 13 17:01:51 2015 UTC,Thank you! Do you recommend reading them in any particular order?
bloodborne,3d4lrn,_georgesim_,3,Mon Jul 13 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"There's no real order to them except within certain series - the dream quest ones (which I don't recommend) and the Cthulhu stuff (where really all you need is ""The Call of Cthulhu"").  That said, I would say Shadow Over Innsmouth is a great page-turner.  BOSS SPOILER: ""At the Mountains of Madness"" contains almost a word for word description of Ebrietas.  ""The Dreams in the Witch House"" is another great one that involves dream worlds.  ""The Case of Charles Dexter Ward,"" however, is my personal favorite."
bloodborne,3d4lrn,devindotcom,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:52:04 2015 UTC,"One of my personal favorites was always The Shunned House.

Neither of these are spectacularly relevant to Bloodborne, but they're both some of my favorites. Fuck it, let's throw The Colour out of Space in there too!"
bloodborne,3d4lrn,JesusaurusRex666,2,Tue Jul 14 02:04:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, fascinating stuff. I've heard the he was racist, but I've never looked into it. Its interesting that it is a cultural thing.  I live in Scotland (the bit at the top of the UK). We have always had a Scotland/England (the bit of the UK below us) rivalry - no Scot has ever knowingly supported the English football team, no matter who England are playing. Racially and culturally, and the passed 400 years of history, we are all virtually identical, down to the colour of our underwear.   We recently had an referendum in Scotland asking whether to stick with the UK or go it alone (we chose to stick). During this, and since then, I have noticed a marked increase in racial accusations against anyone who says something nasty about part of the UK they don't come from. In the past, I would have though such a person was a bit of a dick. I'm having trouble getting used to the expanded use of racist to 'dicks/assholes who live a short distance north/south of you'.

The L Wheel is very verisitale in the type damage it is able to inflict (high blunt, high physical, high Arc). It all depends on the gems you equip - the L.

bloodborne,3d8z1o,MrBrokewilly,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:08:10 2015 UTC,Ok - the best version of the L. Wheel is the Uncanny version (2 Radials & 1 Triangle slots) for doing higher ARC dmg. This mainly due to the fact you can easily farm Radial & Triangle Phy% + Flat Arc ATK gems.  Check out the following post by Astrichthyes regarding gem set-up testing for the LWheel. Good luck.

bloodborne,3d8prb,x_stickman_x,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:36:31 2015 UTC,"I can't really help too well, but I can offer some advice. The goal is to break her limb by limb. My saw cleaver with about 450-500 AR broke her front arms in 3 hits and her head in 2. You should bait her into doing a jump attack, dodge to the side, break the arm on the side you dodged towards, and then move towards her back and begin wailing on the back leg. She can be held down for a while like this.  Mostly just stay away from her and bait the jumps, but there are a few other moves that you can punish. If she heals her limbs you can get a good hit or two in. I she does her really long start up ground smash you can stand by her then get a good 2-3 hits in when you dodge to the side. If she begins to pound the ground with her right (your left) hand, she will do this a total of three times in a row. If you just wait it out this move allows for a safe three hit combo with a cleaver (I have no idea what weapon you're using. I'm sorry I keep going back to the cleaver.)  I personally abused her stagger mechanics for my fight. I found a point (6 R1s + 1 transformation attack from a saw cleaver) where a single bullet would stagger her. I used this to extend my combos and allow me to break more body parts even further extending my combo. I was able to consistently get her down to half health in a single combo by: Dodge right as she jump attacks, hit arm three times, hit back leg 3 times, use transformation attack on back leg, back off and let stamina regen, get close, shoot her, and move to back leg and finish breaking it. I imagine that if your damage is better than mine you could just outright break it without having to regen stamina.   (Sorry if this stuff doesn't help you. It's my low level strat from killing her in NG+7 this morning. This + a bit of patience is what got me through what was one of my most dreaded boss fights. You can do it too!)"
bloodborne,3d8p32,ITSTIMETODDDDDDDDUEL,3,Tue Jul 14 11:09:55 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, once you have access to more of the game it becomes much more efficient to just farm echoes and then buy vials from the messengers. The Lecture Building is especially great for this."
bloodborne,3d8p32,Taliesin_,2,Tue Jul 14 11:30:45 2015 UTC,"Advice: after leveling at the dream, use excess echoes to buy vials and bullets.  Farming them is also pretty simple. Starting from the Great Bridge, kill the ogre, 2 werewolves, everyone in the house and the two ogres before the Central Yharnam lamp. You should get anywhere between 5-12 vials and 4+ bullets.   The echoes you get from farming can be used to buy more bullets, since you won't get as many as vials doing this method."
bloodborne,3d8p32,Bobryk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:56:54 2015 UTC,"An alternative for farming bullets is the area just before the Hemwick Lantern: There's a bunch of those old guys with guns and they all drop either bullets or rarely, bone ash."

bloodborne,3d8p32,Bobryk,2,Tue Jul 14 14:02:11 2015 UTC,"The major problem I have with them is when I have to farm them. Compared to the Estus system, there is an incredibly larger amount of dead time if you used them all. 20+ more carried Vials with the addition of the Regain mechanic might seem plenty as-is, but that is not true.  Enemies and Bosses can deal large amounts of damage, and have certain moves that restrict players from continuously assaulting them. Some enemies also have quick movement, and come in mobs. Some enemies have multi-hit attacks or grabs, eliminating the chance to retrieve lost health.  It is universally better to back off and heal, rather than trying to Regain the health back. Popping a Vial is definitely safer, since it is also quite fast to activate.  What is mind-boggling about this is that it’s only a problem in the beginning, arguably where it shouldn't be.   This is especially true for newcomers. Progressing through the game provides many options to obtain Blood Vials and Blood Echoes, along with better equipment, making farming them become tedious and trivial. Being able to store 600 Blood Vials is utterly meaningless: at the point where you can store 600 Vials, they might as well become infinite use.  Having to farm Blood Vials detracts from playing the game itself, and only serves to overly punish players by taking away time.  Farming for a resource is nothing new, though, and you do get Blood Echoes for your troubles, which account for your levels and currency (in which you can then buy Blood Vials instead of farming them). However, the farming in Bloodborne is more subdued compared to Dark Souls. No chance of dropping unique weapons, armor, or even (good) Blood Gems. Coldblood once in a while would have sufficed too, but nothing else is given. Instead, they are mostly re-allocated as pick-ups on the level.  The intent for this is clear; health should be taken seriously and strategically. However, how can players not use 20 fast-acting Vials to counteract high damage? This serves to entice players to use them more than they should.  A possible solution is capping held Vials to 10, to emphasize Rallying."
bloodborne,3d8p32,FeelinTheWind,2,Tue Jul 14 17:33:52 2015 UTC,"You've taken the words right out of my mouth.   What is mind-boggling about this is that it’s only a problem in the beginning, arguably where it shouldn't be.    Exactly this.   Being able to store 600 Blood Vials is utterly meaningless: at the point where you can store 600 Vials, they might as well become infinite use.   Making the whole mechanic not only completely redundant, but actually detrimental to the flow of the early game, where arguably flow is most important. It just becomes the same as having 20 Estus flasks, except it was tedious and not fun to get to that point.   The intent for this is clear; health should be taken seriously and strategically.   That was the intent of Estus flasks too, except they accomplished it in a far more concise and effective way."
bloodborne,3d8p32,gwaybz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"At what point in game are you? This is probably only an issue for the first few bosses.

bloodborne,3d8p32,gwaybz,2,Tue Jul 14 11:50:25 2015 UTC,"You're trying to parry the boss? Its pretty risky,and you shouldnt need a ton of bullets per fight I think. Though its a shame there are no gunman or other monsters like that. Stock up on echoes, go buy some and come back if you really want the bullets and are using them quickly"
bloodborne,3d8p32,Dimnos,2,Tue Jul 14 11:54:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think that was where I was going wrong. I was trying to get the parry on that last phase so I didn't have to deal with the poison aura. I decided to just go ham and dodge like crazy instead, ended up working out."
bloodborne,3d8p32,x_stickman_x,2,Tue Jul 14 12:16:00 2015 UTC,"Haha alright, good job! I personally have never parried the boss, or at least I think so. I dont remember doing it on any of my last playthroughs or the Chalice dungeons.  Idk if you found them, but there are also a few antidotes in the bosses room, it once saved my life to loot them because I had run out of it.  Anyways, if you have spare blood echoes and feel comfortable with your current stats, you could buy some bullets/vials.  It might be preferable to do so before other bosses, as the game stage and thus the price of consumable might change on your next boss kill depending on who you go for.  It might take some time before you are at a point where echoes come in so easily that consumables are easy to buy in bulk, and that each blood level is expensive."
bloodborne,3d8p32,natx37,2,Tue Jul 14 12:21:53 2015 UTC,I actually found Blood-Starved to be one of the easiest bosses to riposte. Most of its attacks give plenty of reaction time and I always start the fight by running right up to it and riposting the first attack. It's by far the quickest and easiest way to get in to her later stages.
bloodborne,3d8p32,BusyBurningBridges,2,Tue Jul 14 14:43:11 2015 UTC,Blood bullets let you convert 75% of a vial into 5 bullets. It's really efficient if you need to parry.
bloodborne,3d8p32,GothMAXMP,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:57:56 2015 UTC,"I like to start at the Central Yharnam lamp, hit the the two ogres, go through the house, kill the two wolves, then down the stairs take out the patrol and the three dogs, hit last ogre in the fountain square, and the back to the lamp at the bridge for that ogre. Takes less than 5 minutes usually nets 12-20 vials and 6-12 bullets. Then I go to the hunters dream and on to the Witches Abode. From there I farm my way back to the Hemwick lamp. This run is good for 15 or so vials usually and around 15000 echoes. Both trips can be completed in around 12 minutes and with the echoes and vial drops you are looking at something like 50 vials.   Oh yeah, it helps to be rocking the Eye rune as well.  EDIT: Forgot part  of the route."
bloodborne,3d8p32,Beerdrinkers,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:05:33 2015 UTC,So much easier and quicker to just purchase vials if you're low. You don't have to use blood echoes to level up just because you have enough; make a bulk purchase of vials once and you'll be good for a while.

Estus Flasks were a solution to how shitty the grass items were, to how people could just farm them and carry 99 into boss fights. Dark Souls improved upon a lot of Demons Souls' mechanics -- Estus Flasks were one of those improvements. While capping healing items at 20 is better than what DeS had, to bring back the need to farm them is just confusing, more than anything, considering Estus Flasks were a perfect compromise. I'd love to hear Miyazaki's reasoning, because maybe he does have a sound argument for why blood vials are a better/more suitable choice over an estus equivalent that I'm just not picking up on.  I mean, one of the biggest criticisms fans had of Dark Souls 2 was the inclusion of lifegems, and now we have them exclusively haha. It just seems like a weird design choice. Again, the Estus system wasn't broken, it was a pretty great compromise that I don't think needed altering.   you should be spending time grinding for them in one big swoop   Do you find that fun though? Wouldn't the game be more fun if you didn't have to worry about having enough blood vials? Even though it stops being a problem later in the game, is it fun that it was ever a problem in the first place? And doesn't the fact that it eventually stops being something to worry about make it, well, redundant?  I mean, the only reason I can think of why they wouldn't want an Estus equivalent in Bloodborne, is that of just wanting to differ from Dark Souls. But that is a silly reason to employ a mechanic that is less fun and can break the flow of the game.  I don't know, that's just how I feel about it. Maybe I'll change my mind by the time I'm finished my first playthrough. Anyway, despite this gripe, Bloodborne is fun as fuck -- I'm definitely enjoying it a lot more than Dark Souls 2."
bloodborne,3d8owm,Hirionx,4,Tue Jul 14 11:07:30 2015 UTC,PvP is alive and well at 70 if you prefer invading over facing endless same-build tryhards in identical arenas. Most importantly it's also fun.

bloodborne,3d84e8,d_bert91,2,Tue Jul 14 06:38:02 2015 UTC,Thought up another spell that could also solve the lack of npc summons in Bloodborne that I really like.  The player performs a long ritual that can be interrupted by drawing on the ground a symbol with their own blood.  This will summon a npc doppelganger of yourself that will use the weapons and spells you had equipped at the time.  Has 30% reduced health of your total hp (ignoring runes) but can be countered with a shaman bone blade in pvp.  Could cost 10 insight and 8 quicksilver bullets to use.  Lore wise I think the insight could give the body consciousness and the quicksilver bullets give form.
bloodborne,3d84e8,AvidGamer90,2,Tue Jul 14 07:12:50 2015 UTC,"These sound pretty cool, even if some might be undo-able. And there actually is an emit force-like spell. Beast roar knocks people down and deflects projectiles."

All Bosses (No Chalice Dungeons) world record is currently 1:00:11. I speedrun the game and my personal best for All Bosses is 1:06:xx.

Now you're in a building, and the wolves cannot get in.  a couple guys are in this building, but make your way downstairs and out the left door.  Here, go up the stairs and open up the gate for a shortcut back to the lantern. This is your pathway now to get past the wolves and get to the Cleric beast boss fight."

bloodborne,3d3v4o,AmateurHunter,7,Mon Jul 13 19:05:30 2015 UTC,I was wondering about the same. That seems really quick. How is that possible? Do you just run from one boss to the next?
bloodborne,3d3v4o,bogmansaha,7,Mon Jul 13 20:00:09 2015 UTC,Well if you would start with a BL200 char (thanks to the old fence-jump and infinite echoes glitch) it does not takes a lot of time to finish the game.

bloodborne,3d3v4o,Phantom_XIII,3,Mon Jul 13 11:38:00 2015 UTC,Could you clarify what are those major problems? I thought usually speedrunners liked when skip glitches are kept.
bloodborne,3d3v4o,tryllien,2,Mon Jul 13 18:00:10 2015 UTC,"While I do enjoy having the skips and glitches in the game it makes me slightly worried that they are taking 2+ months just to patch in co-op options and not balancing or fixing issues. While unintended skips are still pretty awesome, they are still a detriment to the online portion of the game and might cause issues.   Things like the Vicar Amelia AI glitch should have been patched out a long time ago. Their last attempt at fixing the Old Yharnam skip failed to be of any use as you can simply jump over the invisible wall they put next to the skip without any issue. Sewer Skip remains completely intact. Forbidden Woods OoB skip untouched. The only thing they did fix in the last patch was putting an invisible wall on the railings in Upper Cathedral Ward to prevent people from simply jumping over the railing and falling back down to the first floor (a non-lethal jump)."
bloodborne,3d3v4o,Phantom_XIII,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:29:29 2015 UTC,"I see.  Personally I have nothing against glitches that the player himself have to trigger unless it causes balancing problems that can affect other players - Infinite items, glitches that allow you to have unusual power for your BL and such things. Of course showstoppers are also a no.  My guess is that FROM thinks that unless the bug allows you to violate the BL rule (that is, allows you to have unusual power compared to the players you can invade) or breaks the game then it's not such a big deal."

bloodborne,3d3v4o,PvPSkillz,2,Mon Jul 13 20:54:28 2015 UTC,"Weird.. I thought you was debuffed when going to a host anyway? Given you health/stamina get reduced. :/  I'm not too great at the game but does that mean if I get help they'll be hitting/being hit for a simmilar amount of damage? And does that work vice versa? Say for example if you're looking to farm echo's by helping someone on a 2nd/3rd playthrough, do you get a buff in stats?  I'd hope the matchmaking is fixed at the very least wasted insight not being too much a concern but nice to amass. Also is there like a list of ""glitches/skips"" I can see?  I wasn't aware of these... only one I've experienced is being stuck behind a tree next to the door banging troll and falling through the map after riding a lift. xD  The skips might be handy if I can pull em off after applying the patch cause I'm on a 2nd charecter and I'd like to give her the Katana. For now she has the Saw Spear though."
bloodborne,3d3v4o,Budborne,2,Mon Jul 13 21:05:01 2015 UTC,"In a previous patch, they allowed co-op matching with a password to ignore level boundaries.  So, a level 10 could summon a level 125 character as long as they have the same password.  Sure, you would get a small health reduction for the summons, but their damage output and everything else would remain the same.  This latest patch is supposed to scale the summons down to match the level of the host.  How exactly it works, we won't know until the servers come back up and people can test."

Here is the exact moment that I did it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RCmBRCN4f8&feature=youtu.be&t=2819  You select an item to use (in this case I used the Kin Coldblood from Rom) and choose ""use"" when given the prompt. Just as your character raises their hand to crust the item, open the menu and try to use the Hunter's Mark as quickly as possible. It's about a 2 frame trick, but you will duplicate the item if you manage to pull it off and you'll use two of the item. If you fail, the item will be consumed. You can chain duplicate if you get it the first time, but it is very difficult."

Honestly, the first room in my FCRed lhyll with moon runes brings in 300k and it is not a special room or anything. Just kill the weak-ish enemies and parry the bigger ones.  It all comes down to Risk vs Reward."

There is now a sever penalty to high level cooperation in the form of health and damage reduction.  No real fix to SRRC and general matchmaking. Although you do not lose an insight if you fail to find or join a coop session.   If any one finds any improvements to SRRC or matchmaking please post them as this can all just be bad luck in the first day of the patch.

bloodborne,3d495z,d_bert91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:39:14 2015 UTC,exactly. So basically you should do BL200 chars with like 99 in STR to counter this ...

As for the hunters tools I used old hunters bone, tiny tonitrus, and executioners gloves.  I equipped my saw spear with fire gems and added some bolt gems to the tonitrus.  That is pretty much it, pretty fun build for both PVE & PVP."

bloodborne,3d7n9a,Erotic_Walrus,2,Tue Jul 14 18:30:35 2015 UTC,"My choices:     Fire-infused Saw Spear  Bolt-infused Tonitrus  Arcane-infused Threaded Cane  Rosmarinus (Flamesprayer, initially)   Hunter's Pistol   The only tool I use in PvE is Executioner's Gloves because it hits reliably, casts quickly, and does extraordinary damage for its low QSB cost. Nothing else is half as versatile and reliable."
bloodborne,3d7n9a,The1WhoCsAll,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:11:58 2015 UTC,"Tonitrus is good because it comes with buffable bolt damage, but it doesn't scale well with arcane as you get stronger and stronger. Saw spear and saw cleaver are good early because the 20% buff against beasts is stronger than your characters arcane scaling ability.  This will not always be the case.  Ludwigs holy blade, kirkhammer, and the threaded cane are the best weapons for arcane in terms of maximizing your damage per swing because they scale well and accept +%arc/fire/bolt gems.  The wheel is arcane is it's buffed mode, but the strength required to wield it is a significant commitment of points, especially if you're stopping at 100-120 for the PvP.  The burial blade and blades of mercy scale well, but do not offer maximum damage per swing because 2/3 of their base damage will always remain physical.  Gems that increase arcane damage with a flat number are best for those two weapons.  Also.... When grinding dungeons you will find most arcane gems are triangular.  Seek weapons that regular/lost/uncanny that have gem configurations that fit what you want.  Great arcane gems are very rarely circular in my experience.  Good hunting!"
bloodborne,3d7n9a,FoozleMoozle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"Tonitrus actually scales really well with arcane (despite it's initial values).  The trick form ups the base electric damage by A LOT, which makes the D scaling give you a lot of damage.  Additionally, the tonitrus's B strength scaling also means any additional points you put into strength still get utilized.  For my arcane character, the Tonitrus was out-damaging Ludwig's while tricked (50 Arcane, 16 strength)."
bloodborne,3d7n9a,Rahyl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:27:38 2015 UTC,"Just finished an arcane play through. The hunter tools (tiny tonitrus, beast roar, augur of ebreitas) were useful only situationally. Sometimes they saved my butt, but 90% of the time I was just using normal weapon attacks.  Tonitrus is your best bet. Until you get it, I recommend using the saw cleaver and putting a fire gem in. I was amazed at how many enemies in this game got stunlocked by fire. It ended up being one of my easier play throughs because of it."
bloodborne,3d7n9a,Rahyl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:03:10 2015 UTC,Ha funny you say that I just picked up tonitrus would it also be viable to put arcane gems into ludwig's for late game pvp?

bloodborne,3d82o3,ebonhawk01,2,Tue Jul 14 06:17:32 2015 UTC,The only strategy that work consistently for me is to keep just on the edge of his range and walk backwards out of range once he uses the first attack. The parry his followup attack.
bloodborne,3d82o3,FurtiveCutless,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:23:33 2015 UTC,This is the most consistent way to do it. If you stay that close he is highly unlikely to throw his shotels and once you get the hang of the timing it becomes fairly easy to parry the second attack in most of his combo strings.
bloodborne,3d82o3,PressXToArclight,2,Tue Jul 14 16:15:31 2015 UTC,"Should I be trying to parry him?   in my opinion, yes.  if you stack a couple of clawmarks at that level you should be able to do a fuck tonne of damage to him with ripostes.  to me kiting and parrying him in phase 2 seems easier than going for gaps.  otherwise, you can keep trying to dodge him.    for part one, try parrying the move where he holds his hand up then attacks.  if you shoot just after he puts his hand down, you'll get the parry.  timing is a bit fucky but once you get it you'll understand and it makes that phase just a matter of kiting him around until he does that move.  also has the advantage of spacing so he won't do the boomerang shit.  this guy is difficult for sure."

bloodborne,3d82o3,Chilli_Axe,2,Tue Jul 14 06:54:56 2015 UTC,You can actually skip phase 2 entirely. You have to get a quick backstab when he's transitioning and then repeat it until he's dead. I've gotten about 6 in a row before and that should be enough for most people to have him dead.
bloodborne,3d82o3,x_stickman_x,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:56:10 2015 UTC,"I found this guy to be the hardest boss for me on my way to Platinum. I used LHB in two handed form and stayed close to him. I would dodge around him when he did his melee attack combo and then hit him with a single L2, then back off and wait for him to start again. For Phase 2 it was the same but I had to dodge an extra time before hitting L2. Took a while and a few tries to get his timing down but nothing else worked for me. I had no luck with parrying him in Great Pthumeru Ithyll."
bloodborne,3d5pjt,AeddGynvael,11,Mon Jul 13 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"The merchant was patched to open up upon reaching 1 insight instead of 10. Insight doesn't give you any buffs. The point where enemies get buffs are at 15. From then on out theres nothing more really. At 40 you can see certain invisible creatures and at 60 you'll hear babies crying i believe, but these two effects will come later in the game no matter what your insight level is. Having higher insight also reduces your frenzy resistance and beasthood stat. Insight is knowledge, a great load of this game is gaining insight to commune with the great ones. But alas you're only human and as you will see later on, even the wisest can succumb to having too much insight and turn mad. This is why insight affects your frenzy meter, you're incapable of handling the horrors and otherwordly beings you see and from that you'll get an anxiety attack/heart attack/whatever you wanna interpret it as. A great deal in this game is mere humans trying to get in contact with the great ones by gaining insight but they all turn mad or beast. The entire game hints that insight is a bad thing."

bloodborne,3d5pjt,OOpiumBear,2,Tue Jul 14 01:45:11 2015 UTC,"It's really interesting. If you spend a large chunk of insight you see beast and frenzy bars show up and then reduce as if you were primed...  This plays into a much greater theory I have about the beauty in souls games... The fact that it's a tangible functional world on a technical level and that it's not like the game has gimmicky on off switches... It really does prefrenzy load you.  And if you can glitch over a gate, boom, you really can go to places you shouldn't... Why?  The game is built as a tangible world as a fundamental design; it's not a set of plot tricks following a story.  I feel like these core principles maybe originated from the limitations of building something alone as the first demons souls game was made.  As an individual, it's simpler to set up core mechanics and let them play out naturally than it is to orchestrate large timed script-like gameplay."
bloodborne,3d5pjt,Joocemann,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:08:30 2015 UTC,"The reason the bar goes up is because your resistance and beasthood goes up.

bloodborne,3d5pjt,OOpiumBear,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:09:02 2015 UTC,"My point about the glitch is that even though you're not supposed to be there, that part of the game is alive and running.  It's a sign of how the game is designed fundamentally."
