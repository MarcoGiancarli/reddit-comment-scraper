brownman,3dxaa4,KingCox22,2,Mon Jul 20 08:19:42 2015 UTC,"The weapons are locked in place in the animation, so the hands would need to match up on your end. If you look at the supplied Kenti character pngs, they should line up with everything.  Also, images are resized down to 64 px tall and proportionately wide. They're also centered, so if your character needs to be off-center, add the appropriate blank space on the other side of the png."

brownman,3dj8w9,Newbs280,2,Thu Jul 16 22:19:14 2015 UTC,Oh hi there. I guess you could say I have experience doing these. Thanks bud!
brownman,3dj8w9,TheDrunkDetective,3,Thu Jul 16 23:28:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks ! Just an idea though: don't know if it's a good one but I don't know if putting the date and only the date in the post title is ""enough"" since (some) people care a lot about the games, so for this One a good title would be: Twitch Livestream / July 15th / Titanfall - Destiny - Rocket League (with ""X"" guest !). Just a personnal preference, don't know if it's worth it though, you tell me"
brownman,3dj8w9,TheDrunkDetective,2,Thu Jul 16 20:51:02 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting idea that I will sleep on. I would like these to have a certain amount of uniformity to them, so I won't swap from one style to another. I'm slightly hesitant that the title could quickly become unruly with that format though. For example if Ray plays like four games during a stream, one has a long name (Ex. Crypt of the Necrodancer), or if he interacts with multiple streamers in one day. If someone does only really care about ""what games"", then I think I've built the summary in a way that the eye naturally goes to see what games were played. What do you think?"
brownman,3dj8w9,TheDrunkDetective,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:35:42 2015 UTC,"True true, I do agree that the ""guest"" part could become annoying if Ray is playing with a lot of people but for the longer named games you can always use short version - the big reason behind all that (to me) is that having a title with the games in it will definetely help to convince people to look for theese posts (""oh Destiny ? I like that game maybe I'm going to check this update"" especially since Ray streams a lot and people probably don't have time to check every streams).   So ultimately it's just to help the people here to be a little bit more ""concerned"" and involved with the subreddit (I hope that the updates will help with the ammount of discussions around here, since I don't see many comments on the youtube video posts).  As a new Streamer Ray is very popular so I'm not to worried about that, and just like many people I do believe keeping one Youtube channel is the smart move, but now the main goal for Ray shouln't be to get more and more new viewers (he does without trying to much though) but to build, or make the community ""stronger"", wich is already happening thanks to the mods / T-shirts sales...etc.   So yeah I think this subreddit will be very important to Ray in the future and I hope that theese Updates posts are the first ""stone"", and using the popularity or the notorierty of theese games to ""promote"" theese new kind of posts feels right to me :)  PS: sorry if I'm not clear or if I made some english mistakes, French fan here"
brownman,3dj8w9,That_one_cool_dude,2,Fri Jul 17 09:26:17 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about your English, you're talking to a Russian, so it's perfectly fine. You brought a good point and we're going to give it a shot in the summary for today's streams. Thanks for your input!"

One small thing I think you should add, if you are the person doing this or whoever is doing this regularly, is add when, during the other persons stream, the RAYD starts."
brownman,3dj8w9,Cubejam,2,Thu Jul 16 21:28:16 2015 UTC,Could you try explaining that idea in more detail? Do you mean like when the RAYD starts for the target streamer !uptime wise or actual time wise?

brownman,3dfb8d,HispanicAtTehDisco,2,Wed Jul 15 23:19:12 2015 UTC,It's a very think heavy game.   Also I'm not sure if I'm alone in this but during my first play through I actually had to stop playing after Cole  PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD   Gets fired and goes into arson because I was so immersed into being Cole that I felt bad for him.   Very good game and I hope Ray plays it.

brownman,3db2yx,thatghostie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:43:09 2015 UTC,Been a multitude of questions that Ray has received over various streams where someone asks a question about AH or something related to AH and Ray gives them an answer they don't like. Nothing really comes to mind because Ray hasn't said anything negative but unfortunately a few people have interpreted his answers as such.

brownman,3cune8,StevenKeen,29,Fri Jul 10 22:32:22 2015 UTC,"So the only option would be to set up his own ""teespring store"" which would work the same way campaigns that run and ship once over, additionally they wouldn't have the twitch logo on the side which Ray likes.       Others have different sites they use but we've looked around and they don't have as many option when it comes to pricing so teespring campaigns would be cheaper then the standard store and he would make less per shirt so lose-lose for everyone."
brownman,3cune8,tinadayton,3,Sat Jul 11 06:17:08 2015 UTC,"I mean i imagine, just based on how insane the support has been so far, that the cost/profit would balance out pretty quick. I didn't have money during campaigns but I'd love Merch and I'm sure thousands of others are the same. Hopefully you guys think it over.  It could also be a Tina Merch store, wink wink nudge nudge."
brownman,3cune8,tinadayton,4,Sat Jul 11 19:58:10 2015 UTC,"The best we've been able to find is he would have to charge 5.00 more per shirt and would make 50%+ less per shirt. Shipping for that site was also higher and again no twitch logo, so if an option becomes available that is closer to what teespring offres I know he'd be happy to do it but that options isn't out there right now.."

brownman,3cune8,barkev,12,Sun Jul 12 01:00:58 2015 UTC,"I bet he'll be more profitable (for now) with the exclusivity. If they're only available for a small amount of time, the value goes up, which could only be good for him. I mean, if he had a dozen designs available at once, a store would make more sense."
brownman,3cune8,bootsnpantsnboots,2,Sat Jul 11 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"A lot of logistics go into a store  Constantly having a huge supply to keep up with demand is way harder than just releasing a limited run with a finite amount  Also, every state has a different tax percentage and it has to be monitored.  It can be taken care of pretty easily but also isn't a problem when if you're not doing it every day  If he gets a ton of designs, I'm sure he'll open one up  But for now, he's golden  Or brown, whatever"

Time:  Time spent on it would definitely be worth it... And ala above the options I am sure there are solutions to make it pretty streamlined and automated.   Knowldege:  Again, other than provide the merch designs (maybe not even that) don't think he'd have to know much.   At most maybe Tina can help and the store will include some of her merch."

brownman,3clcmi,idreenuhh,47,Thu Jul 9 14:25:35 2015 UTC,"Hey guys! Just to clean something up Sub only streams refer to streams where everyone can watch however ONLY subs can chat. Hopefully that clears some things up.   As far as collabs go they can definitely happen however keep In mind that some people are unable to participate due to contract restrictions.   Additionally, I know ray has said before that the sub and donation notifications will always have some sort of noise alert as he wants to be able to thank them so those will not be eliminated."
brownman,3clcmi,tinadayton,14,Wed Jul 8 21:01:50 2015 UTC,In that case I feel that I would change my initial point to be fully supportive of Sub Only streams. Nice to give those who have put down some cash to get to interact with other subs and have more chance of being noticed!  Cheers for the clean up!
brownman,3clcmi,TheKirkyLife,42,Wed Jul 8 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"Green screen always seems a bit weird to me, but there's not harm in testing it out. ""Starting Soon"" could be nice for the chat to actually talk before it gets crazy. ""BRB/Intermission"" couldn't hurt, but it doesn't seem like you are gone for an extended period of time. And people seem to enjoy solely Chaircam, maybe you could full-screen that instead? Sub only streams would be nice. As someone who is subbed, it would be cool to hang out with just subs for a bit. Kind of relax the chat so it's not constantly moving so quickly. Music on streams could be a bit more laid back for everyone, but what about monetizing them once you put them on YouTube? Don't want to jeopardize possible revenue from YouTube, but that's up to you if you think it's worth it. Donation and subs on screen could be nice and give the chat a feeling of being a part of the stream. We know you can't get every sub or donation. It seems like it could be a more organized way for you and chat to interact via subs and donations (the tip wars are also a plus for you)   Sincerely,  Someone who really doesn't know what they're talking about a.k.a. a fan"
brownman,3clcmi,Whosey,15,Wed Jul 8 20:36:05 2015 UTC,"Sub only streams would be nice. As someone who is subbed, it would be cool to hang out with just subs for a bit. Kind of relax the chat so it's not constantly moving so quickly.   I think this would be a cool idea but maybe instead of full streams that are sub only but maybe times where the chat are sub only. It would be nice if the chat wasn't so fast all the time :P   Just my 2 cents."
brownman,3clcmi,wysmyster,2,Wed Jul 8 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"... Sub only streams refer to streams where everyone can watch however ONLY subs can chat. Hopefully that clears some things up   Sub-only streams means that only subs can type in chat, and I believe he meant that only certain segments would be sub-only and not an entire stream."
brownman,3clcmi,Whosey,6,Sun Jul 12 03:01:25 2015 UTC,"Have to agree with the green screen comment. I've never personally enjoyed it when a streamer moves to having a green screen, but like you said there's no reason not to try it.   Edit: Also I think sub only streams have better alternatives. I know sub only giveaway's aren't allowed, but I don't see sub-only Fibbage or Quiplash would be. You could PM out the code to all subs. Some work, but a happy middle ground I think or even just in addition."
brownman,3clcmi,Gfrolicious,2,Wed Jul 8 21:03:47 2015 UTC,I've seen streamers do sub-only giveaways for small items (e.g. indie game downloads) who noted they got the site's permission first.
brownman,3clcmi,Kicking222,4,Wed Jul 8 22:14:37 2015 UTC,It's possible he could find someone from the community that makes music and he could use it royalty free. I'm sure someone wouldn't mind...
brownman,3clcmi,asheppard308,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:46:25 2015 UTC,"I know firedragon764 (Fifi) has had that done recently, and the songs are actually pretty good too. So that's definitely a thought."
brownman,3clcmi,capitalist14,2,Thu Jul 9 01:48:55 2015 UTC,Maybe BRB time could be a special frame for chaircam?
brownman,3clcmi,fishbiscuit13,20,Thu Jul 9 01:20:04 2015 UTC,""" Green screen instead of webcam.""  My explanation was not great. What I meant was I could install the green screen I have and use that to have myself appear over the gameplay. (Very similar to Teawrex, Broman, GiantWaffle, Gassy Mexican, etc). or I can stick with my webcam setup now, where I will appear in small box on screen.  Hopefully I made that easy to understand."
brownman,3clcmi,Chassius,12,Wed Jul 8 20:34:25 2015 UTC,I like what you do now without the green screen. Just my opinion.
brownman,3clcmi,NottaGamer,3,Wed Jul 8 21:51:34 2015 UTC,"I never cared much for the green screen that puts the player in the game. I did see a neat use of it though on BuffDaddyHD's channel when he was on the main page where it had the game played on a portion of the screen, then his green screen cam under the chat bubble. It made him match his wallpaper and I think had a generally more professional/welcoming appearance then when people throw themselves over game footage.   My description might not be so great, but if you go on his channel and look at his past broadcast of Paper Mario you can get an idea of what I mean."
brownman,3clcmi,Dakodiak,12,Wed Jul 8 23:13:25 2015 UTC,I think the green screen would be good to implement because it looks more natural and takes up less space.
brownman,3clcmi,Fearhawk,2,Wed Jul 8 21:11:42 2015 UTC,"I personally don't like the green screen but it couldn't hurt to try it out. Others might like it and hey, maybe it'll grow on me."
brownman,3clcmi,Datassyum,2,Thu Jul 9 02:25:59 2015 UTC,I like green screen cause then you can be bigger on screen but still take up less space so you don't cover too much gameplay.  I think a bigger view of you with the green screen can do wonders for reactions and stuff.
brownman,3clcmi,AnthroTiger,0,Wed Jul 8 23:02:37 2015 UTC,"There's a trade-off of course, but green screens tend to make the whole setup a little cleaner.  Instead of this clunky rectangle box, you are just a floating person.  You can fade in/out for cut scenes if you wanted to. Have the cam come back on and have a reaction/goofy look on your face."
brownman,3clcmi,RookieBalboa25,50,Thu Jul 9 14:13:04 2015 UTC,"Okay, my advice.  Don't make streams purely Sub-Only, because some people can't afford it. However, you could do something like Cryaotic does, and make the first couple hours Sub-Mode. That way, both parties win, parties being you and the non-subs.  Next, the highest donation thing is always a turn off for me, personally. It just seems like a cash grab. It would be fine to have the newest subs/donations going across the screen, or in the corner, but not the highest ones.  Other than that, it's sounding great! Hope you don't mind my opinion!"
brownman,3clcmi,honestthrowout,19,Wed Jul 8 20:29:29 2015 UTC,"I second this.  People like Ray because he's humble, relatable, and funny."
brownman,3clcmi,RookieBalboa25,7,Wed Jul 8 22:32:06 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that's the way I wanted it to come across. Ray is known for being Humble."
brownman,3clcmi,Datassyum,8,Wed Jul 8 22:34:07 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with this, Theres a difference between having a name in the top corner to appreciate a really nice donation and having someone dance around or get their tits out for money.  I don't think it takes away from the stream and could even add to it, making a sub-team meta that ""fight"" for the screen space and people could make fan art and stuff."
brownman,3clcmi,RookieBalboa25,-2,Wed Jul 8 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to type a response for a while now. Here is what I got.  1) I never said that having donations go across was bad, I just said don't have them like ""HEY GUYS, TOP DONATION LOLOLOLOLOL GIB MONEE""  2) That won't add to the game/stream. In fact, it will take away. The idiots that would spend their money, or their parents money, shouldn't be taking away from the stream by ""fighting"" for the spot. Again, it takes away from the experience."
brownman,3clcmi,Datassyum,4,Wed Jul 8 23:31:26 2015 UTC,"Well to your first point, Neither of us think Ray would do that, so thats irrelevant.  I dont know, I don't think it would take away from the stream.  The only thing would be that the donations would be more, and therefore the donations sounds would go off more often, but they go off really frequently as is, so I don't think its too much of a change to form.  Also I think its more incentive to donate, I know people who donate just to see their name on screen or for the shoutout, Another little incentive to donate could help.  Ultimately, you have to remember that regardless of how its done, At the end of the day its just people giving money to Ray.  It doesn't really matter how its done, Its all the same imo and as long as he isnt begging on camera then i'm good with it."
brownman,3clcmi,RookieBalboa25,-3,Wed Jul 8 23:41:25 2015 UTC,"But see, he is begging, in a way.  By making the donations more... extavagent, he is kind of saying ""Hey, give me money, so you can have this."" Normally, it's fine, because it's small and quick. Like, ""Hey, thanks for donating!"" But with the tip wars, and the more noticable notifications, etc... I now see it as more of a cash grab. The difference is, it becomes less about the games, and more about the donations. That isn't cool.  I don't know, I just want it to stay the same. It's perfect the way it is."
brownman,3clcmi,Datassyum,11,Wed Jul 8 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"I don't see it as begging at all, Remember Ray is proving a service, A free service that you're not forced to pay for. So realistically he can do whatever he likes, of course that might push away some viewers.  I don't think its a ""cash grab"", I mean even the word assumes that he's doing this out of the goodness of his heart. Sure he enjoys doing it, but it is his job first and foremost, Its what keeps bread on the table remember.  If it doesnt interrupt the stream, just in the corner to show appreciation to those who support him then i dont see the problem.  You could argue that it encourages people to donate, but since when is that a bad thing?   If the service provided isn't hindered in anyway then I dont see why encouraging people to donate is a bad thing.  Encouraging people to donate wasn't a ""cash grab"" when he started out, It isnt a ""cash grab"" when he turns on sub only streams, Which he states himself improves sub levels, but now all of a sudden this one thing is ""begging"" and ""cash grab""   Just because beggars on twitch use it doesnt mean its inherently a horrible Idea, As long as it doesnt change the stream then im 100% for it.  People who like it go for top spot, those who don't donate/don't donate as they usually would, and Ray makes more money for better Equipment, Higher quality camera, Green screens.  Ultimately, adding this can only be seen as an improvement to the stream in my mind, Once its handled with the same humble approach that Ray brought to the table when he started, Which I Believe he would."
brownman,3clcmi,lazylapras,3,Thu Jul 9 00:11:31 2015 UTC,"Personally, the reason why I don't like the highest donation or the newest donation/sub is because it just clutters the screen. I'd rather see more of the game and Ray.   Like with his last layout, a lot of people complained that the chat was too distracting and made the game smaller. I think the same people would have issues with the newest donation/sub text on the screen for the same reasons. Plus if people are having tipping wars or sub trains, then that text will be just as distracting as having the chat in the layout."
brownman,3clcmi,RookieBalboa25,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:03:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with the fact it shouldn't take up a lot of the screen. However, I just don't like seeing the Highest Donation because it seems like the  streamer is saying ""Top that, by giving me more money!""  It's just... douchey."
brownman,3clcmi,lazylapras,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:33:04 2015 UTC,Oh I totally agree with that too. It is kinda douchey. Though a lot of the popular streamers do have that in their layouts
brownman,3clcmi,AnthroTiger,3,Wed Jul 8 23:55:04 2015 UTC,"I think half and half is a good compromise for the sub only streams. If people really want to engage in the chat, they can sub and if not, then they can just wait until it's open to everyone.   I'm not generally a fan of the highest tipper type of things either, although it's so common on streams now it is hard to get away from."
brownman,3clcmi,capitalist14,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:24:24 2015 UTC,"I kind of agree with the entire top donation thing. Like, there are definitely some people out there that want to spend money just to get a shoutout or get on the screen, and then you'll get people just doing massive donations for the spot. It feels a little bit like a ""hey, if you want to, do it"" on one hand, but I like the feels of involvement in the stream. And I feel like there are some people that would absolutely rub it in other people's faces, because they like feeling empowered like that. Idk I have lots of random and mixed thoughts about it."
brownman,3clcmi,HospiceAntlers,6,Thu Jul 9 01:59:59 2015 UTC,"I don't really like the idea for subscriber only streams, but that's probably because I'm not even a sub. :P You are right that it could cause more people to sub, though, so it's also a good idea.  All of these ideas are great and I'm eager to see them put in (if they are)!"
brownman,3clcmi,EinsteinReplica,5,Wed Jul 8 20:26:41 2015 UTC,"One idea I have for that is doing a TheRPGMinx-Town-Of-Salem style stream setup, where only the subscribers can play with the streamer, but everybody can watch it. Would give a small benefit to the subs, but not alienate everybody else."
brownman,3clcmi,HospiceAntlers,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:35:12 2015 UTC,"I thought he meant where only subs can use chat, haha. _^ Thanks for correcting me!"
brownman,3clcmi,EinsteinReplica,7,Sat Jul 11 02:24:27 2015 UTC,"It'd be great to get an artist to do some BRB and Starting Soon art for your channel. There are artists like /u/Axl_Rosie and /u/taraforest who have made art for streams such as the Farlands or Bust streams /u/kurtjmac makes, and it also gets the artist's name out in public. Not sure what could be on the art, but that's up to you. Definitely like every idea you proposed :D  Also, collaborations is something I wanna see a lot more on your streams. You do a lot of either yourself, or you and Tina, and I kinda wanna see what you'd be like with people like FunHaus, Seannanners or other examples. Just a thought :D"
brownman,3clcmi,sextarts,4,Wed Jul 8 20:28:48 2015 UTC,"I agree with the idea of collaborations, you aren't new to the gaming community and know a lot of streamers already so I don't think it would be hard to find people to do occasional streams with. (Just a suggestion though, you do you man and if you prefer streaming alone or w/ just Tina then keep doing that.)"
brownman,3clcmi,karl2025,8,Wed Jul 8 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"Play music on stream. A lot of Destiny streamers do this and their fans seem to like it. Obviously I wouldn't do it for all streams, but maybe for the streams where I play multiplayer games with the chat I could play some music. (These streams I could not monetize on YouTube).   I wouldn't mind music, but really I don't like it enough to want to cost you income for it."
brownman,3clcmi,EinsteinReplica,3,Wed Jul 8 20:28:24 2015 UTC,"He could use some Royalty Free Music. There's a lot of music you can use for free as long as you credit the person who made the music, such as TeknoAXE or Approaching Nirvana"
brownman,3clcmi,Sabbrewolf,7,Wed Jul 8 20:36:15 2015 UTC,MonsterCat actually sells a license for ALL their music for 15 dollars a month. (This gets you TWO licenses to use. So you AND Tina could use it really) And we are talking about a metric asston of music to use for your stream or youtube videos.
brownman,3clcmi,EinsteinReplica,2,Wed Jul 8 20:56:24 2015 UTC,"It all depends if Ray is willing to spend 15$ a month for a bit of music. I mean, he makes a lot more on tips alone each month, so it would be affordable, but eh, tough call."
brownman,3clcmi,Sabbrewolf,4,Wed Jul 8 20:59:04 2015 UTC,"Not having to worry about getting content flagged and still being able to monetize the videos on youtube would more than make up for that cost I would think.  Edit: And MonsterCat is well more than a ""bit"" of music. They stream it for 24 hours on their own channel on twitch. Good stuff. :D"

BUT, Your new setup looks to just be next to a blank wall so, It wouldnt be a whole lot of movement. Green Screen sounds fun!  ""Starting Soon"" screen: Would love it! Always fun to have something to look at before a stream, Maybe some music along with it too!  ""BRB/Intermission"" screen: Would work well too! Chaircam included? Hell yeah!  Subscriber Only streams: I think its a wonderful idea, Good way to attract more subscribers, Gives incentive,  Play music on stream: I enjoy music, BUT I wouldnt want to take away from your youtube revenue, I say stick with no music, or just occasionally, If the gameplay doesnt lose anything from extra music added.  Latest Sub/Highest Donation: Awesome idea! Again, Another incentive to subcribe or tip!"

brownman,3clcmi,RtardDAN,7,Wed Jul 8 20:34:23 2015 UTC,"I really agree with this. I would like to see Ray basically ignore chat for most of story games like Life is Strange, Telltale games, Arkham, etc."

brownman,3clcmi,naoremonth,3,Wed Jul 8 20:42:50 2015 UTC,I feel like highest donation would be a good thing for special streams (like the yet to be 24 hours stream) or a charity stream
brownman,3clcmi,TudorVII,3,Wed Jul 8 20:34:21 2015 UTC,"Well, I might as well respond to all of the ideas if I'm going to respond.   -Green screen: I like the idea of switching between the two. I think green screen allows us to see you a little better if you make yourself appear big enough on stream, but can look a bit odd, especially for certain games or if the color starts getting weird.  -Starting Soon screen: I think its a good idea. Gives people time to get the notification and show up before you start.  -Intermission Screen: I also like this, as long as Chaircam is still there! Could provide basic info about some stuff; not sure what, but could absolutely be neat to see. Maybe you could show off fanart you particularly like, if fanartists were okay with that?  -Sub Only Streams: Definitely not often, but it could be a cool monthly/biweekly/whatever thing as an incentive.  -Music: I think it would probably only work for multiplayer streams, and even then I'm iffy on it. It works for some streamers, but I prefer being able to hear the game and streamer clearly, especially for gaming streamers.  -Latest Sub/Highest Donation: It sounds neat, especially since there HAVE been bidding wars on stream before. This could provide a way for those people to more easily see what the current highest is for that stream.  That's all my opinions. Hopefully they're helpful, along with what everyone else has to contribute!"
brownman,3clcmi,ArcadeDiet,2,Wed Jul 8 20:35:58 2015 UTC,"As your better Brit, may I formally request that you sometimes stream a couple of hours earlier? I've never had the chance to watch one of your streams all the way through, so god bless your YouTube uploads. May just be me, but I think once in a while it'd be nice."
brownman,3clcmi,PatrickOsmodo,7,Wed Jul 8 20:44:06 2015 UTC,"Hi Ray. My wife and I watch your stream a lot, and one thing that can get grating is the sub/donation announcement sounds. They go off A LOT and it's nice to see that people are supporting you, but maybe alternate the sounds once in a while? As far as the latest sub/highest donation box is concerned, judging from that imgur link you posted, it looks like it would take up a pretty large portion of the screen? Hope that isn't the case. Love from the UK."
brownman,3clcmi,Daanish3751,7,Wed Jul 8 20:35:02 2015 UTC,"Have you ever considered someone Co-hosting the stream (occasionally) ? Maybe have a guest over  (Michael for example) and he would sit next to you and add more commentary, tell some stories etc. Because no matter who you watch, having a single person on screen for hours at a time might be a bit boring sometimes. And not the streams that you do with Tina, cuz that's expected to happen (plus it's through a mic) . But having a guest next to you adding to the comedy, it can make it much more engaging. Just a little refresher, know what I mean?"
brownman,3clcmi,Clarkey101,3,Wed Jul 8 20:41:26 2015 UTC,"Hey Ray. I live in an awkward timezone so I catch most of your streams on YouTube. I can understand you find it necessary to thank people and stuff when they sub or donate but I feel it's kind of jarring and disrupts your train of thought when you're making a joke or telling a story of sorts. Other than that, I like the way the layout is currently as its non intrusive. Might be a good idea to turn down the volume on the oh shit and wonderful. I personally find a lot of the games on stream to be boring af but you're interesting enough to keep me around."
brownman,3clcmi,JoshMcIntyre,3,Wed Jul 8 20:30:00 2015 UTC,"I think they're all cool ideas. I like the ""Starting Soon"" screen, just gives people a little extra warning!"
brownman,3clcmi,AnonymousFroggies,3,Wed Jul 8 20:30:25 2015 UTC,"The starting screen is a great idea; if people land in shortly before a stream not knowing whether one is starting soon or not, this is a great thing for them.    In the same way as the starting screen, I also really like the idea of an intermission screen for breaks. Having chair cam there is a must, but it helps for people landing in for the first time or coming back from a break themselves wondering where you've gone to.    Anyways, those're just my thoughts! Keep being awesome."
brownman,3clcmi,pupusa_monkey,3,Wed Jul 8 20:37:00 2015 UTC,"I like a more minimalist approach like what ProfessorBroman has. I think the focus should be on the streamer and the game, the excess frills kind of detract from the experience. A green screen is yet another way to cut out clutter and focus on the game and the streamer."
brownman,3clcmi,King_Rissels,3,Wed Jul 8 21:06:40 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of sub-only streams, but i know all the non-subs who would hate to miss out on that content. Maybe only have it like once a month, call it Sub-Sunday\Saturday, while eating some Subways. Just some feedback on my part. Keep up the good work buddy and ill try to catch your next stream."
brownman,3clcmi,Cubejam,3,Wed Jul 8 21:11:54 2015 UTC,"Green screen: Personally I don't see the appeal of it over a webcam; I like seeing the setting/room people are in as, for me, it makes the stream seem more natural and real.  BRB/Starting soon screens: I like the idea of getting an artist to make a starting soon screen, but I think the BRB/Break screens are pretty redundant, but can see where they'd be useful as well. For most cases just having the title say ""Taking break"" and have the screen on like monstercat or something would suffice enough. But so far as that goes, I am still indifferent about them. Sub only streams: I don't think it's a great idea to do sub only; what I've been seeing a lot of streamers do is having it open to everyone, but then having sub playdates. This lets everyone watch, but doesnt leave anyone out. giving the incentive to non subs to subscibe so they can participate in the future. Music on stream: I am pretty indifferent about this idea, honestly if you feel like it's something you want to do then by all means. I don't want you to not be able to monetize to Youtube, as a lot of people go to that as a means to catch up/watch on their own time. Sub counter/Highest donation: I see a lot of people doing this lately, I don't think much of it while watching, but it seems like a neat feature to have. My two cents would be to not have it take up a lot of screen space, too many streams have I seen where the counters take up so much space on the stream that it's just not watchable. Ideas: Maybe have a day of the week set up so you play with chat only, MK8, Jackbox games, etc. Have more opportunities for chat to vote on games for you to play when trying to decide what to do.   I am excited to see what you do, and can't wait for whatever you have in store!"
brownman,3clcmi,RobinDragonryder,3,Wed Jul 8 21:17:21 2015 UTC,"Personally speaking, and this is absolutely no fault of your own or of people in your stream, I just can't get into the stream. I love the interaction twitch gives viewers and streamers. I just feel there's absolutely none of that here because of how popular the stream is.  Subscriber only streams would aid that interaction so much more than open streams. Of course it'd still be manic, but less so than usual.  The lack of interaction between chat and yourself and between those in chat in general is a massive turn off for myself on any stream."
brownman,3clcmi,GoPer_,2,Wed Jul 8 23:26:44 2015 UTC,"What exactly do you mean by ""Green screen instead of webcam""?  Other than that I think your ideas are pretty solid; Subscirber-only streams are sure to bring in more subscirbers, and those who can't afford it can always watch it after-the-fact on YouTube, right?"
brownman,3clcmi,SuperfluousShark,2,Wed Jul 8 20:27:07 2015 UTC,"Have a greenscreen behind him, so instead of seeing the background of his house, you just see a ""cutout"" of him in the corner and the game running in the background,a couple of streamers have this and it's pretty good.  EDIT: Kind of like this."
brownman,3clcmi,AwkwardMassEffectFan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"Green Screen means it would be like the weather channel, instead of seeing the room Ray is in its all game with a little cut out of ray. I think I described that right."

brownman,3clcmi,NoobKingRobert,2,Wed Jul 8 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"Concerning new ideas, how about something like Random Wednesdays, where you pick games from your backlog by chance (be it blindfolded, a viewer vote, or dice roll) and play them. Or perhaps dedicate a day to playing games that remain exclusive to platforms such as the PS4, PC, Wii U, etc. I know I would enjoy watching you stream Infamous, Killzone, God of War, The Legend of Zelda, Super Mario Bros., and so on."
brownman,3clcmi,Wolferey,2,Wed Jul 8 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"Green Screen - No comment  Starting Soon Screen - Always a good idea.  You can chat with us while waiting for people to file in.  Not all watch Twitch/Twitter like a hawk.  BRB Screen - Just make the BRB Screen a picture of your chair, so even after you get rid of it, we will always have Poncho Chair Cam.  Sub Only Stream - I'll just have to miss those, sorry.  But nothin' wrong with showin' a little love to those who pay for your rent.  Music on Stream - Twitch does have a policy about music as well, and any ""previous stream"" videos they don't like will get muted as well.  No idea what they'd do mid-stream, but just saying.  Latest Sub/Donation - That looks a little intrusive on the game screen.  We're generally there for you and for the game.  Unless of course this gets parked somewhere else in your info box or something, then that's cool."
brownman,3clcmi,TheKirkyLife,2,Wed Jul 8 20:36:14 2015 UTC,Any chance you'd go on Dropped Frames (itmejp/cohhcarnage/ezekiel_III's show)? Would be cool to hear you talk about your journey on twitch and figuring these things out!
brownman,3clcmi,BrandieBrands,2,Wed Jul 8 20:36:16 2015 UTC,"To be very honest I think this is just one of those things which should be set up on ease and cost of money. I love your box, I wouldn't mind it if you green screened. Especially if you end up in a volcano. ""Starting Soon"" screen is a very good idea. Makes sure that people know that you are there soon! ""BRB/Intermission"" screen basically in the same category as above, good idea. Subscriber Only streams is an incredibly toxic subject but to me yet there is no real incentive to subscribe. Then again, some people don't have enough to subscribe. It might be worth setting aside one or two days for a Subscriber Only stream, don't upload to YouTube, but keep the rest of days open. Then if people do want ALL of the content from you they have their incentive drop the button. For your sake I think no music is the way to go. I don't mind :D Latest Sub/Highest Donation is a very, very dangerous game as I fear that some people may yet go into almost like a gambling psyche. I realise that ultimately it is their money, true, but there will be younger guys and girls or perhaps drunk peeps watching who don't fully realise the extent of what they are doing and may seriously regret what they are doing. If I was in your shoes, I certainly wouldn't encourage tipping wars. Just leads to more harm than good from my perspective."
brownman,3clcmi,TheKirkyLife,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:55:02 2015 UTC,"I think you have an interesting point on the subject of people making donations they can't actually afford. This could potentially also harm Ray when people come to their senses, or sober up, and decide to refund the tip.    Also, I think 'sub-only streams' usually (always?) refers to streams available to everyone, but where only subs can chat. Tina comments on this point here."
brownman,3clcmi,HateHater77,2,Wed Jul 8 21:55:57 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm still getting my head around the Twitchosphere to be honest haha only really watch GassyMexican do his Game of Thrones Let's Play before Ray moved over full time :D  Fully supportive of 'sub-only streams' therefore :)
brownman,3clcmi,shutemdown20,2,Wed Jul 8 22:33:19 2015 UTC,"Specially in the times that you get a lot of subs and donations, it may be a good idea to thank them/read their messages in bundles, as to avoid constantly interrupting the flow of the stream. Like every 30 mins you would take time to do all that at once instead of all of them immediatly and constantly. That being said I understand that this patronage is extremely important for the stream and as such you might not even want to consider it."

For music on the stream i have some friends who make different kinds of EDM who would be happy to provide you some music but we would have to talk it over. I personally feel like the green screen switch would be awesome. Definitely go with sub only streams to appreciate paid followers (Don't become Activison). Keep up the amazing work!
brownman,3clcmi,Tom-Pendragon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:34:00 2015 UTC,I know Tucker (iiJeriichoii) and Goldglove have an intermission screen when they arent doing anything in the game or just having a break ie at the end of a long H1Z1 game. Maybe you could look at theirs for a little bit of inspiration (I can link it if you want)
brownman,3clcmi,Thetijoy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:35:28 2015 UTC,"Most of them seems like great ideas, but I don't know how the green screen will look like ( I guess it like YouTube, where we don't see the background).  The sub stream seems like something I would enjoy."

As a sub I'd of course love to see some sub-only streams but I know that there are still going to be a lot of viewers who can't watch since they aren't a sub but I like that feeling of getting a little something extra for being a sub.  Obviously this is just my opinion but I prefer the simplicity of your streams as opposed to people who have a bunch of things going on the screen but of course in the end it'll all be up to you. Keep up the great work Ray!"

brownman,3clcmi,BazingaAce93,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:34:25 2015 UTC,"While my internet is not good enough to watch the streams live, I always watch them on YouTube so hopefully my opinion is valid. Firstly I would like to say I like your format. I do feel like that you have it in comfortable layout that is not overcrowded with too much going on the screen, thus not distracting the viewers from the game. I would be interested to see how a green screen would look now that you have the space for it in your new office area. It would allow more of the screen to be seen without losing key components of your streams (Chair cam). Subscriber only streams would be a great incentive to get new subscribers because it would add something special to the subs that don't talk in the chat that often or feel the need to use the Emotes. If there were subscriber only streams, would those be added to YT? That is all I can think of right now to help you ""improve"" your streams. Loving the content you are putting out Ray! Keep up the great work! Hopefully I can catch a live stream soon!"

brownman,3clcmi,priyesh69,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:36:30 2015 UTC,"I definitely like the idea of putting a top donator/ newest sub on the screen, as long as it's not too intrusive/ doesn't block too much of the action. It works for a lot of streamers. I really don't think too many sub only streams are a good idea. To have to pay just to join the conversation usually makes me move on to a stream where I can talk for free (even though I am a brownman sub)."
brownman,3clcmi,emii_gems,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:37:48 2015 UTC,I feel like Subscriber only streams is too much. I don't mind sub only chat and have moments of free chat like at the end and beginning of streams. Spooky uses this for transition. I want to see more game variety or weekly thread about suggestion. Stream day called achievement hunting where you prepare sets of achievement your going to get during the stream.

brownman,3clcmi,Constable_Nathan,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe have a bar along the bottom that's always scrolling that shows the donations/tips, instead of it always popping up and blocking some of the gameplay. Like you'll see on news programs with the little stuff going on at the bottom. Not trying to take away the attention from the people that donate and sub, but just try to make it a bit less obtrusive"
brownman,3clcmi,BrandieBrands,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:44:13 2015 UTC,"Another incentive you could use for getting tips/viewer involvement is using text to speech for donations. (A lot of other streamers use it so I'm sure you've seen it before. Maybe you've already thought of this?) Anyway, that way messages are read during the stream and you wouldn't have to stop playing to read donation messages. Of course, you would have to block a bunch of words (racist stuff, etc.) to stop trolls or otherwise just plain offensive people... Something to think about anyway.  For subscriber only streams, that seems like a great idea! And a good way to engage more with your subscribers!  Honestly though, whatever you want to do to make the stream how you want it to be sounds good! As long as you're happy with how you stream, we'll be happy!"
brownman,3clcmi,decemberkay,2,Wed Jul 8 20:44:45 2015 UTC,"Text-to-speech donations can be funny, but I think with the amount of donations Ray gets it would get old very quickly if he uses it every stream. Maybe once every month or two? And definitely filter out certain words, though people will always find ways to circumvent that."
brownman,3clcmi,IllusionaryRose,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:45:17 2015 UTC,"The Intermission screen is a good idea for when people come into the stream when there's chaircam. Maybe even a estimated time to when you're coming back although I don't think that will stop people from asking constantly in the chat. I like the idea of the latest donation/sub, however, I don't want it clouding up the whole entire screen because I'm here for you as well, y'know? Music and subscriber only should only be once in a while to mix it up but not to become boring/repetitive in anyway. People below mentioned polls for the subscriber only. I think that's a good thing to try out too. The green screen and the starting soon is all good, though. Have fun in Ohio! <3."
brownman,3clcmi,Oagoz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:54:47 2015 UTC,"Hi Ray, I agree that you have some great ideas about continuing your streaming endeavors; here's some more feedback from a viewer.  Personally, green screens are kind of weird  because I enjoy the ""daily life"" set up. But if you are behind a wall, go ahead.   Starting Soon & BRB screens would be great addition. If you know how long you'll be gone or you just want a ten minute break, you can always add a timer. This will allow current viewers and those who just logged on to see when you'll be back.  I'm not a subscriber yet; so, I would be kind of bummed not seeing you play. Maybe you can find a happy middle and have ""sub only chat"" or play date. But will these be up on YouTube or just an exclusive? I think more wouldn't mind if they'll be up on YT in a few days or weeks. Another suggestion is have them choose the game, like maybe send sub mail with a poll link asking for gaming suggestions if you want your subs to feel more involved and special for paying.  Music is really up to you and the Latest Sub/Highest Donation sounds like a good idea if it's not taking up the full screen.  Honestly, I don't watch many other streamers; so, I really have no other ideas that haven't already been discussed or I've already mentioned. Although, maybe once a month you can have a guest on your stream and tag team a game like you and Tina do some times. I know that's probably easier said than done but it'd be good publicity for you and your partner.~"
brownman,3clcmi,RBRTPNG,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:58:07 2015 UTC,"With the growing popularity of your stream and how you always have a constant 3k+ viewers I do believe it is time to integrate sub only chat eventually, at this time chat is just to spammy and trolly but I do think if you did have sub chat this would actually increase chat interaction and there could actually be conversation in chat."

If anything, don't do music, I watch a lot of the streams on youtube and knowing they might not be up because of music kinda sucks cause that'd be a lot of content/views loss"
brownman,3clcmi,Cavs032,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"I really haven't got any good ideas or feedback on the current state of the  stream, so I guess I'll just go by the points you gave in the OP.   I personally liked seeing stuff happen behind you on the webcam, but if there's just a wall or something behind you in the new setup I think a green screen could be a good addition. Usually 'Starting Soon'-screens are just annoying to me. It's not really a good start of the stream if you click the notification, enter the stream but are stuck listening to (usually mediocre) music for 10-15 minutes while you actually just want to watch the stream. Then again maybe it's worth the slight annoyance for those joining early, if it gives other people coming in from Twitter/other channels the chance to catch the start of the stream. An intermission screen would be good way for viewers to instantly see if you're having a short (chaircam) or longer break (the intermission screen), so I think it's a cool idea! Even as a sub myself, I'm really not a fan of the idea of being excluded from participating in the chat if you can't/currently won't sub. But then again if sub-only streams give you a big increase in subs I really couldn't blame you. This is really the only point I have major negative feelings towards. I personally hate it when streamers are playing music. I feel like it's usually just annoying background noise, distracting from the actual gameplay and the streamer's commentary. There are some exceptions for me, like people who stream games like Civ:V or Cities:Skylines which are slow and don't offer too much in the sense of important sound design, but I can't think of any game you've streamed that would benefit from additional background music. Then there's the monetization issue, which doesn't really affect us viewers but seems like a major negative for you from my viewpoint. I'm a big sucker for pretty sub/donation graphics on stream. I absolutely love what streamers like DansGaming and ProBro have done with their layouts in this aspect. So I really haven't got any feedback on this point other than; YES PLEASE.   I hope this is helpful in any way, and doesn't feel too negative. Keep being awesome, Ray brownHEART"

brownman,3clcmi,karkeys_vantagepoint,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:42:13 2015 UTC,Have the game in a smaller window with the facecam beside it so they dont overlap. If there's some room left maybe you can capture the stream chat as well.

brownman,3clcmi,raptor_theo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:32:18 2015 UTC,"My opinions?  ~I think no green screen is better but if you really wanna mix it up, put fan art or rotate posters and stuff on the wall behind you.  ~For your latest sub/top donation stuff, I would recommend a more minimalist style. Some streamers make these names prominent or just section off an area of their screen fully donated to that. Personally, I dislike that and would like to see something simple, like your existing pop-up notifications for subs/tips, though I've no advice on how best to implement this.  ~Ideas you didn't mention would be a more set schedule (nothing extreme, perhaps just one day a week set aside for a special event, like games w/ chat, Quiplash/Jackbox, things like that), challenge days (Achievement hunting, beating a level in a certain time, Destiny raids with certain weapons only or fewer people, attempts at speedrunning, etc.), and more ""joke days"" like your 420 stream (I thought it was really funny that you embraced the joke and maybe you could base a stream around an overused joke or meme, i.e. YOLO challenges where if you die you change games, MLG sniper training, stuff like that).  ~Really the main thing is that myself and many others love your streams as they currently are and so dramatic change is not necessary from my point of view. Though I encourage your desire for growth and change, I caution only a few changes at a time to give us a chance to adjust, especially in case we miss some streams. Also, please don't let your screen become cluttered with Top Monthly Donation, Top Weekly Donation, Top Daily Donation, Newest Subscriber, Current Song, etc. Your use of pop-up notifications is one of my favorite thing because it leaves the screen free for gameplay/chaircam/you. Love your streams Ray, keep 'em coming."

brownman,3clcmi,lunchboxx1090,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:24:04 2015 UTC,"Ray,   The only thing I'm going to say is that you should be careful about what all you put on your screen so it doesn't become crowded. I see too many streamers where they have a donation panel, and a follower/sub panel, and then the speed run time panel, and then they have the chat, and when all is said and done they have less than a quarter of their screen for the actual gameplay! And I know I'm in a minority when I say that I don't like those streams. I want to see the person play and I want to see them playing. Don't cover up or shrink the screen so much that you lose what you are supposed to be doing on a stream.  I personally like the webcam because it's a great way to show off posters or fan art. In fact, why not make it a fan art wall? Get a giant cork board that fills the webcam and do a monthly cycle of art?   brb/intermission and a stream starting soon screen would be a great idea, and even my crappy stream has a brb screen.

This, of course, is dependent on technology.   Green screen - I'm ambivalent as to whether it's you in a box or you in front of a green screen during the game play. But it could be beneficial for other things. What about chair cam-ception? I don't know how the green screen feed is set up, but it might be possible to ""project"" a live view of your web cam - which would be viewing your chair and what I assume would be a wall with a green screen on it - and create a sort of mirror effect.   In other words, during gameplay moments, the green screen serves to just have you as a cutout like others do. But during chair cam moments, the image behind the chair on the green screen could be chair cam. Chair cam upon chair cam upon chair cam.  Essentially it'd look like this: https://skullsinthestars.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/nickieatmirror.jpg   Slightly less gimmicky, you could designate one day a week to be a music stream. Maybe that's the same day you play games with chat or something, where the game audio is far less important. Or maybe it's for an hour or two in your stream if you don't do a ""games with chat"" day. You could pick an artist or two that you want to spotlight and play their stuff, kind of like a showcase thing."
brownman,3clcmi,Javon66,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:58:01 2015 UTC,dont want people to miss the beginning? say that the stream starts like 51 minutes before you actually start.
brownman,3clcmi,crbigpapi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:21:26 2015 UTC,Please no sub streams I can't afford that.
brownman,3clcmi,SheepishEmpire,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:27:38 2015 UTC,If your gonna do music i suggest contacting monstercat on youtube or twitch.  They seem to support streamers and allow them to use their music.
brownman,3clcmi,Virtruvian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:33:08 2015 UTC,"I think that latest donation would be better than highest donation personally. Highest seems kind of gloaty I guess? Or maybe if somehow a tip war starts you can adjust to show it saying ""current tip war champion"" instead of highest donation.  And the BRB/Intermission is pretty good of an idea. Maybe have the picture for it be the Chaircam with a BRB in the middle?  Sub-only streams might be good if you decide to stream games like Drawful or Quiplash or multiplayer games, maybe have those streams incorporate music since they would be exclusive?  Green screen looks cool, but the webcam option fits well with your border that has all your social media info. If you can put the social media stuff in there without it being too much in the way I'd say give it a try for a couple days then have a strawpoll about it.  Starting soon screen would be nice, maybe have it there when you make a tweet about going to stream soon?  Good ideas for it Ray, just keep on going and I think you'll be able to refine it a little better."
brownman,3clcmi,Tym2play,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:41:55 2015 UTC,"My suggestion on the tips/sub list would be to have a scrolling list like DansGaming, but then have the top donation of the day stickied at the top of the list."
brownman,3clcmi,skilledwarman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:48:37 2015 UTC,Maybe after you finish a game you pick out games that you want to play and we can vote on which game we want to see next or vote on  the Most suggested game also I like the idea of music with chair cam.
brownman,3clcmi,RustyCanMan,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:32:47 2015 UTC,"For the intermission screens, maybe you could have someone make one with the chair on it? Best of both worlds type thing."
brownman,3clcmi,thecakeslayer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:43:07 2015 UTC,"Green screen vs webcam I kinda like the webcam, you can usually just see you main man waluigi's legs hanging around the corner watching over you. Music on stream. I think that may be a little much. Game audio plus you Ray, is usually great already. Even in the background while playing another game/grinding for an achievement.   There are a couple things that I think you might want to consider:   Adding a just played list of games on stream. Different from your completed games list in the FAQ.  Maybe every once in a while make a poll on what the viewers would like to see more of after completing a game on stream. Like whether more games like Metro 2033 redux after you completed it or achievement grinding in a new game like TMNT/ Spongebob. You still have veto but think of it as a way to gauge what your viewers would like to see more of. If  I remember right you said you were going to do a few things for charity, like operation supply drop etc. Maybe you could make some sort of reward list ranging from giveaways to games you have to play based on highest/frequent donations etc.  An actual schedule would be nice. The current which says ""I stream everyday except Monday & Thursday."" is vague. I think it would be nice if even just a Saturday you have a regular scheduled stream so even people across the globe could catch it easier, even with the time difference if they knew beforehand when you would start."

brownman,3clcmi,Papasimmons,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:06:37 2015 UTC,"I like all your ideas ray!! I think they are great and can really benefit your stream. I just have to say that when it comes to the top donator/recent sub try to keep the layout as simplistic as possible. That's one of the things I love about your streams is that its very simplistic.. Many streamers seem to clog up the screen with that crap by making it to.. ""flamboyant"" I guess is the word..  So basically try to keep it simple and keep making incredible streams love you man!!!"
brownman,3clcmi,Renacc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:26:20 2015 UTC,For the brb screen if you have the green screen set up behind you maybe you could use to showcase fan art?

brownman,3clcmi,Fork_was_Taken,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"Hey Ray.  I hope it's save to say that Ive been around your streams for quite a while. I'm also still frequently watching other streamers with similar sized channels so here's my personal opinion on the things you brought up:   Green screen: Personally, I love your webcam setup. It's enjoyable to see whats going on behind you because often enough things actually happen around you. Youre not in the basement (FiFi) nor are you sitting with your back immediately against a wall (Broman) so there is no actual need for a green screen. These setups often look nice, sure, but it also takes away something from the stream. As long as you are comfortable to stream the surroundings/your room, then it's definitely more than welcome. Starting soon: As somebody that uses to hang out 30 mins before the stream on the RT channel started I can tell you: Pre-Stream chats are very enjoyable. Just combine it with some music and it will definitely be a great idea. Especially when you do playthroughs on multiple days. I dont see any downside to it. Plus you can put up fan art and such on the start up screen. BRB Screens: Unnessesary. They are only useful if you want to cover up webcam. But then we wouldnt get chair cam. Only option would be to put up fan art during intermission. Sub only: As a Mod I can assure you that your chat is relatively well behaved. Sure, with a large viewer number the amount of trolls increases but theres a very active and solid modsquat and your chat is very clean and non-hostile compared to others. You also do a great job catching comments and questions while playing. While Im genereally against the idea of sub-only chat, there are some exceptions:   A sub only Q&A would be cool. Maybe once a week for like 10 mins or once a month for an hour you close chat to subs only and answer questions from your subscribers. That way everyone can enjoy but subs get the privilege of interacting for a dedicated moment of the stream. I personally dont enjoy people that use subscriptions as a tool to get more subs by offering a better stream experience to those who sub. I strongly believe that great streamers will get a decent amount of aubs without asking for it or the need of extra incentives. Sub mode works best to bring chat under control. Sub only invite games and sub raffles are ok but leave chat open during the game so viewers can have fun in chat. Also managing the duration and frequency is important as well. I do think that you deserve all the moneys and more but I still dont support any streamer that is literally asking for or forcing people to sub because theres no other way to participate. Casual streams should always have open chat imo. The only exception as I said would be a Q&A because it only works that way and is different from your regular streams.   Music can be distracting. Many great streams work best without. The only way I enjoy music is during super casual streams with lots of grinding (usually FPS/MP casual games and Destiny grinding. I think its more of a question of how comfortable you are with music on. I'd say if it's something you'd put on youtube (like your playthroughs or viewer games) then no music, during achievemnt grinding or casual cod/destiny, sure, why not. Theres also always the option of using royalty free music for the sake of playing music but I personally would rather hear what you as a streamer love to hear and not just have music on just so theres music. Im not a fan of top donator or donation lists but mainly because I donate to suupport the streamer and not to get my name out there. It might be an incentive for the rich kids that love to get attention to go for big sums but I always feel a bit dirty watching streams that support this mentality. I do, though, encourage the 'newest subs' tab and at your sub rate you might want to show at least the latest 2-3 subs. It also helps when missing a sub and doesnt hurt anyone.  MoMo"
brownman,3clcmi,MrFlats,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:54:14 2015 UTC,"All seem like good ideas, except for greenscreen. The webcam box provides a better contrast Imo, it's visually chaotic to see a moving background behind a face.  Enjoy Ohio! Hope your friends are taking you to Melt/Bspot/etc."
brownman,3clcmi,An_Incognito_Walrus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:56:17 2015 UTC,"While not being a sub myself due to constraints, I think Sub-Only streams would indeed be great incentive for non-subs who want to interact, but also keeping in times where non-subs like myself who can't actually become subs for a whole matter of reasons can still interact with you."
brownman,3clcmi,_Kyrite_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:37:34 2015 UTC,"Keep the stream clean of excessive overlays. To me, nothing is worse than streamers who have 25% of their stream to 'fancy' overlays. Personally, I think your layout is perfect as is.  As for the intermission screen, maybe just have chair cam with an overlay that says, ""Be Right Back brownHEART,"" and if you wanna go all out, play the good old technical difficulties music.   Finally, don't play music on stream. Music will allienate people that don't like it and drive them away. I watch streams for the player and game, not the music. It's simple enough for the person watching to play music on their own at a lower volume in the background.  Sorry if any of this sounds rude or bossy, in the end the decision is 100% up to you. I'm also really tired after work last night so I'm not very good at formulating thoughts.   Thanks for all you do! Now I'm off to play some Metro brownHEART"
brownman,3clcmi,ryannevill,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:54:41 2015 UTC,I don't really like the idea of using a green screen. I'm not sure why though. I just feel like it's less personal in a way. Like we're only being shown what you want us to see.
brownman,3clcmi,nixerkg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"I think a start screen and a BRB screen are a must. The BRB screen can hold a tonne of information and make it so people dont just turn up, see a chair and think, cant be bothered to wait and leave.  Putting like a short description of you, your contact, twitter etc. on it and then maybe some timing information of when you are streaming and stuff.   I also think that an offline screen is a good way to get this info out, people might not look at it as often but just having it there so its not just a blank screen. I have done a few twitch profiles so can maybe have some input into the design of it. ryannevill.com"
brownman,3clcmi,NCH_PANTHER,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:23:12 2015 UTC,"Hey Ray,  Apologize if this has been mentioned but I skimmed a lot of the posts here.   I think the way you have it now with being in a webcam is nice. A lot of green screen setups leave it looking like you're a floating head which seems odd. I think a starting soon screen is great. But I think you should also have a starting intro. It's a little podcast-esque but would be cool. BRB/Intermission Screen is a good idea if you're going to be eating or need to leave longer than a normal bathroom break. Maybe that's when you use the green screen so the chair cam can exist but have the backgrounds maybe Fan Art? Indifferent on Sub Only Streams. Do what you feel. No to music. It's distracting unless you're playing something like Cities:Skyline but most of the games you play is actioned packed enough where music is uneeded. Latest Sub/Highest Donation. I think this is cool as long as it doesn't take away real estate. Too many overlays looks crappy. Also after watching the SupportClass video I def think you should look into integrating a lot of their cool stuff.   Is there any plans for a website? I know you don't really need one but something simple, almost like a landing page. Get your name out there more, link back to your YouTube videos, maybe share Fan Art, show standings of your tippers etc."
brownman,3clcmi,Dace67,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I love the stream the way it is. A starting soon is a great idea just because if someone comes in like 5 minutes after the start they dont miss anything."
brownman,3clcmi,edric_xiong,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:53:38 2015 UTC,"I'll got by point by point:   Green screens I've seen on Twitch have ranged from pretty cool to absolutely awful looking. As long as it's not terrible, I probably wouldn't mind it (or at least get used to it). Very yes. Meh. Unless you'll be gone for a while (like 5+ minutes), I think just having chair cam would be easier since it is faster to jump in and out of. It would be interesting at certain times but not being a sub, your whole attitude of ""save your money if you can't afford it"" gets kind of mixed where people feel obligated to sub just to communicate with you even if just for a stream or two. Honestly not a fan as someone who has fairly eclectic music tastes. I don't judge people for the music they listen to (I've got some weird ones after all) but, depending on the music, I would probably just turn off the stream instead which is not something I really want to do. I love it. All time highest donation and/or current stream highest donation is pretty cool as long as it isn't too obtrusive (which it sounds like it won't be).   Also, already up-voted it, but I definitely agree with FeaturedYoda. A weekly ""play with the chat"" day would be fantastic. Have chat vote on a couple of games you pick out each week, maybe do a lottery for choosing players on certain games, etc. Could be a lot of fun."

Right now, Twitter is the place where you announce starting times for streams (90% of the time you do it the day-of). I think Twitter should be the place  to announce any CHANGES to the starting time, not the time itself, but maybe that's just me.  On what you suggest, I like everything except sub-only chat. I don't think making chat 'exclusive' is a fair incentive for people to sub. All other suggestions seem pretty nice."

If you have seen Broman's (which i'm sure you have) when he get's 6 subs quickly he has a pop up on screen that has an animation of the new subs shooting something. Sometimes it's Crota, Atheon etc.   Maybe you could have Waluigi pop up or something. Just a thought."

Example: ""Ray should play Fallout 4"" to which you replied ""Yeah I'll go get it right now"" or something of the sorts. I'm going to guess that the person suggesting it meant when it came out, and you sarcastically answering to it could have put them down. Along with this, I believe the ""No suggesting games rules"" should be removed. I understand that it can be annoying if you start playing a game and people start saying ""play this, play that."" However I think you should take suggestions for games to play in the future.   I know stupid questions are annoying, however a stupid question could be coming from someone who is new to the stream, and if you were to answer there question in an off-putting way, they may not want to return."

brownman,3bqad3,BrownBot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:40:05 2015 UTC,"I guess it's because I know Michael played all these, but it really surprises me that Ray hasn't played the Arkham series before. I'm a little jealous, Ray gets to experience the entire series from beginning to end without any breaks if he so chooses.  Edit: Also, Tara Strong didn't voice Harley Quinn until after this game. I believe the original voice actress from the Animated Series, Arleen Sorkin, voices her in this game."

brownman,3azjin,TheopholosWhenntooda,3,Wed Jun 24 19:34:11 2015 UTC,He said that he wants to be a solo streamer for now. Obviously he occasionally streams with Tina. But who knows what he might do in the future. His main source of income is his Twitch Streams. If I am not mistaken he doesn't monetize his Youtube Videos at all. The streams go there for people who can't see him live. He could do more sometime in the future but its up to him.
brownman,3azjin,MRLGames,2,Wed Jun 24 19:44:55 2015 UTC,I see. Thanks for explaining it.
brownman,3azjin,DesertedPenguin,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:01:57 2015 UTC,One addendum: I believe Ray said he's not monetizing the YouTube stuff because his channel was previously not monetized and changing it is quite the ordeal.  Which is why he was asking a while back what people thought of a new channel or possibly even multiple channels.
brownman,3ax5b6,foxclaw,15,Wed Jun 24 05:25:43 2015 UTC,No. He used to have one that was owned by RT so he returned it when he left.

brownman,3apeeo,RNarvaezJr,49,Tue Jun 23 05:37:39 2015 UTC,"These comments are a lot better than what can be found on YouTube   OMG! Ray's so boring! I'm glad he left!   They're just stupid. I'm glad that AH has improved, and how you enjoy streaming, because you're good at it. Because that's what it's about. If you love your job, you'll never work a day in your life.  Unfortunately due to timezones, etc., I can't watch streams live so I really appreciate you uploading your streams to YouTube, makes studying easier, watching your streams on a separate monitor.  So GG Ray!"
brownman,3apeeo,InfinityLDog,20,Tue Jun 23 11:19:09 2015 UTC,"I think achievement hunter took a major hit losing you, after all you were an integral part of the family, but they took it in stride. If anything you both have grown from it. Everyone is happy from something that could be taken as something like a break up and people start hating. Well done, to all of you! For people who make mostly dick jokes you sure are grown up."
brownman,3apeeo,cillyengineer,262,Tue Jun 23 12:09:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly? It's Ray that I don't watch anymore. I can't always be around when he streams, and when my choice is a 24 minute AH Destiny video, or a 4 hour 30 minute unedited Ray Destiny video, I know which one I'm banking my free time on for entertainment.  I mean, I like Ray, and I wish him well, but I can only really tune in when I get lucky and find out I'm free, don't have a backlog of the other Youtube shows I watch, and he's playing something I want to watch (Destiny, for example, isn't that entertaining for me, and I get through an AH vid because of their banter, you know?)  I miss Ray, but I think it's largely because I have a similar sense of humor, and find myself thinking quips that Ray would have said. Otherwise, with the 5 main AHs, and all the rotating guests, it's been hard to notice Ray's absence. I mean, at this point it doesn't feel all that different from the stretch where Gavin/Michael were gone for Lazer Team, you know?"
brownman,3apeeo,JHawkInc,215,Tue Jun 23 01:48:18 2015 UTC,"Another good comment. A lot of people say the same thing in regards to the unedited stream uploads, so let me explain my though process.  I'm not a ""YouTuber"". I can't do solo Let's Plays like Michael (I don't know how we does it, he's so good at it), I don't do vlogs or unboxings, etc. My YouTube channel was actually quite empty considering I've had it for a few years. My thought process was I just upload the streams for anybody who misses it and to archive my streams online (I have most of my streams saved on my PC as well). Twitch's VOD system is not great. The player they use has issues and old streams only stay up for 30 days (I think).  I understand me uploading my streams to YouTube isn't for everyone. My primary thing is streaming so I focus all my attention on that, but I realize because of work, school, timezones, etc. not everyone who wants to watch my streams can watch them. So this is my way of giving my audience a way to ""catch up"" on my streams or only watch the games they want to."
brownman,3apeeo,RNarvaezJr,45,Tue Jun 23 05:33:41 2015 UTC,"And it works! I don't see as much of you as I used to in my day to day Youtubing, but like you said, it's because you're not a ""Youtuber"", and that's what I watch (well, Youtube and Netflix). I definitely appreciate the uploads, because eventually I will have time to watch 18 hours of RDR, and I'll be glad it's available when that time comes. So I can't speak for everyone, but I for one definitely appreciate it!"
brownman,3apeeo,JHawkInc,39,Tue Jun 23 05:59:08 2015 UTC,"Hey Ray, You should make highlights. Whenever something really funny happends remind yourself to make a highlight bit in Twitch and plop that on YT."
brownman,3apeeo,PTFOholland,58,Tue Jun 23 16:16:45 2015 UTC,I know. I'm really bad about that :(
brownman,3apeeo,RNarvaezJr,27,Tue Jun 23 17:09:56 2015 UTC,Time to hire 5 people to do it for you! Oh wait. I am sure there would be a kind volunteer to do it though.
brownman,3apeeo,PTFOholland,8,Tue Jun 23 17:20:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly I haven't looked but there are probably people who do it already and upload it to their own channels.  All it takes sometimes is reaching out to those people and working with them - offering them a little for the people making good compilations.  Personally I really like Ray but I share the same point of view as /u/JhawkInc. I don't watch streams because I just don't have the time. Having them uploaded to YouTube is great and all since you don't have to worry about whether Ray (or whatever Twitch streamer you like) is streaming right that moment and you can watch whatever games you want, like he said - but even still, watching a video that lasts a couple hours is not for me. Honestly, even AH's stuff is a bit long for me these days (I don't usually want to sit down and watch a 40 minute video of gameplay, but part of it is probably just me getting older and moving out of the target demo).  Shame though, because I like Ray and his stuff, and wish there was a better way to watch it. At the same time I realize he isn't a YouTuber - he COULD be, but he wouldn't be as good at it and more importantly he wouldn't enjoy it as much... and why mess with a good thing? But a compilation here or there would be great. AH's big problem is that they are WAY oversaturated with content these days, and while long streams from Ray are a bit less overwhelming they still take a long time to chew through if you wanna watch them."
brownman,3apeeo,caninehere,5,Tue Jun 23 21:24:58 2015 UTC,"I know that it's hard to do, I'm sure you could get someone to timestamp or mark some of these highlights for you. Like /u/PTFOholland said, snip them out and throw it up on Youtube. I personally enjoy those types of things that other streamers do, because it lets me be able to enjoy their content without the large time commitment. Although, you could always dive in the comments of the stream videos, but who wants to go through that cancer.  Appeals to the people who might only want a 5 min video and still captures the essence of the stream."
brownman,3apeeo,AnthroTiger,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:46:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I usually think: That was awesome. And scribble it on a notepad for further notice. When I stop streaming I immediatly search it as my memory is still fresh and then I plop it on YT. Easy as pie! Back when I used to stream though.
brownman,3apeeo,PTFOholland,2,Tue Jun 23 17:48:42 2015 UTC,I think it would be cool if certain viewers had a notepad document free and a timer to make a note of time stamps.  I would certainly volunteer for the next time you stream.
brownman,3apeeo,DeclanH1996,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:57:16 2015 UTC,Honestly I'm sure a bunch of people would be willing to help with that for free. I have a basic knowledge of video production and video editing software. I would be down to help out.
brownman,3apeeo,ohhowlovely19,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:22:34 2015 UTC,"Well if you were willing to do it I'd love to lend a hand. I have nothing going on so it'd give me something productive to do, not to mention getting to work in conjunction with you"
brownman,3apeeo,poisonbiscuts,2,Tue Jun 23 22:06:51 2015 UTC,"if I'm not mistaken you can set it to keep your videos indefinitely in settings or something, i found it while i was casting LoL matches"
brownman,3apeeo,Shankymcpimp,2,Tue Jun 23 08:42:31 2015 UTC,There must be a way to keep your streams on Twitch indefinitely since I go back and watch a lot of Cryaotic's streams from the last couple of years.
brownman,3apeeo,FuzzelFox,6,Tue Jun 23 19:15:32 2015 UTC,"I've been a subscriber to your channel Ray for 3 months now.  I kind of don't watch you anymore all that often that I used to is because I get very annoyed about how much you say welcome to all the subscribers and this person donated this and this is his message, blah blah blah blah blah blah, it just gets old and interrupts anything you are playing and makes the quality go way down.  But you are still the bomb diggity."
brownman,3apeeo,SC2TiMeLorD,76,Tue Jun 23 14:48:04 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, I feel like I should be thanking as many as those people as possible. Everyone who subscribes and donates to me are essentially paying me. They are the reason I'm able to pay my bills, buy food, get a new apartment, etc. Without them I wouldn't be able to do streaming as full time job.  I know it can get annoying to some people but like I said you can't please everyone. I feel it would be disrespectful to ignore someone if they donated some of their own money to me."
brownman,3apeeo,RNarvaezJr,10,Tue Jun 23 15:39:38 2015 UTC,"Just keep doing what you're doing, Ray. Obviously people enjoy it and I'm sure your audience will continue to grow. You're a good guy too and people want to see you thrive."
brownman,3apeeo,Im_Fuming,10,Tue Jun 23 15:43:18 2015 UTC,"Have you thought of maybe spending like 5 mins every hour thanking all the people who donated/subscribed? You could still give a nice personalized thank you like you do, but it would be nice and contained."
brownman,3apeeo,Doesnt_Draw_Anything,7,Tue Jun 23 18:30:07 2015 UTC,I would have to stop by stream and write down the name of everyone who subs & donates so that would take even more time away from the stream.
brownman,3apeeo,RNarvaezJr,3,Wed Jun 24 01:45:40 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't know how the donation system works, I just assumed you could look at a list of recent donators."
brownman,3apeeo,Doesnt_Draw_Anything,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:55:04 2015 UTC,Well thats exactly what it is actually. Theres a window that shows a list of recent donators with the amount they donated and the message they have (if they have one).
brownman,3apeeo,DavidSSD,2,Wed Jun 24 04:30:02 2015 UTC,"To me, thanking the people that subscribe and donate is totally the right thing to do.   As you said, these people are the ones paying you to do your job, and it would be rude to not appreciate them.   However, those sound effects that go off EVERY.  SINGLE.   TIME.   are just awful and are legitimately the #1 thing that makes me stop watching."
brownman,3apeeo,fazzle1,7,Tue Jun 23 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"The sound effects are so I can hear when someone subs and donates. Subscribers are shown in the chat but donations aren't there. I make it as low as possible so it's not too disruptive. Also the sound clip is roughly 3 seconds long, there are streams with much longer sound cues.  Sorry they bother you, but I'm not gonna take it off anytime soon."
brownman,3apeeo,RNarvaezJr,2,Wed Jun 24 01:37:20 2015 UTC,Maybe if there was more variety to them instead of just a few sounds being repeated ad nauseam?
brownman,3apeeo,fazzle1,5,Wed Jun 24 04:09:46 2015 UTC,"Streaming live vs. making videos for uploads have very different dynamics. Ray's stream is built a bit around interaction with people watching live and following. It makes sense for him to be giving shout outs and thanks. I never watch an upload on Youtube because that's missing out on a part of the experience. Even if I'm ""behind"".  Edit: Not saying that watching Ray stream live is the only way to watch him. I understand the time issues as well that make watching on Youtube the only way to watch Ray play games. Just that some aspects of the stream are lost when watching the video on demand."
brownman,3apeeo,TheFantomHero,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:38:09 2015 UTC,"I would just like to say thank you for doing that. In addition to not being in a timezone where I can easily watch your livestreams, my internet is slow enough that I can only watch mobile quality on twitch, but Youtube's player allows me to watch in up to 360p, a significant increase. Thank you :)"
brownman,3apeeo,Nick_Furry,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:53:11 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate the YouTube uploads of all your streams; due to various reasons, I can almost never catch a stream, and when I do, I'm always saddened when I get interrupted while watching it. Watching your streams via YouTube means that (obviously), I can pause the stream as need be, and come back to it when I get a chance.  I'll admit that it's very different from the content that you used to put out at AH, but that's not a bad thing; I watch their videos when I want a quick dose of humor,  but I watch your streams on a second screen if I happen to be replaying a game, just because I don't need to focus entirely on the game. Overall, I reckon you've definitely made a good move in changing to doing what you love, and I commend you for it."
brownman,3apeeo,DoctorLamb,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:31:04 2015 UTC,"You should attempt to reach out to your fan base and look for a low key editor/fan. Take a look at vinesauce's model. Vinny is the full time streamer and has no time with work and streaming to actually manage any content for his site. So he hands off his material to several of his closest fans turned editors. Vappyvap I think manages 3 vinesauce channels, and captain SouthBird does a great job cutting them into highlight reels. Outside of that, Vinny has developed a network where he has people like Reg find great, short games for him to play. I can never take the achievement hunter out of you but if you streamed some tinier, ~30 minute games, I think you'll see a large influx of viewers. Good luck however you go about though and keep on keeping on."

I'm glad he's back to uploading stuff on his personal channel. Everything that comes out of LtMkilla(or Full Play, etc) is an absolute joy to watch. He works so well solo.  Also I'm the same way, solo LPing is hard as fuck. I still haven't recorded anything that I've felt satisfactory enough to actually start up a channel and do something with. :("
brownman,3apeeo,ihazcheese,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:04:41 2015 UTC,"Its exactly as you said. I don't watch all of them, all of the time, but I usually miss a lot of your streams due to life/work so I appreciate being to catch the ones that interest me most when I can. Editing obviously would make them better but I'd rather have them unedited than cutting into your streaming or personal time."
brownman,3apeeo,Cstanchfield,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:39:57 2015 UTC,Just wanna say I really appreciate you upload unedited streams for those who miss it.

brownman,3apeeo,DrummerBoy2999,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:14:18 2015 UTC,I put Ray's streams on a lot when I'm working from home and want something to play in the background.  Beats Horrible Bosses and My Big Fat Greek Wedding. Even gives Maury a run for his money.
brownman,3apeeo,itripovermyownfeet,2,Wed Jun 24 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"I have been the same way for a while now, not able to sit down and watch every stream (and he's good, he streams at all times so even me in the UK can generally tune in if I wish, but I just don't have the time).  That said, when it's a game I enjoy, I'll find the time to watch the youtube video (Youtube is good in that I can stop the video, watch something else, and then go back to it in my history and it'll start up again from where I left off, so I don't have to view it all in one sitting). I recently sat through his Ori and the Blind Forest stream and it was just so very enjoyable (and seriously Ray, if you're reading this, you need to finish that game, I feel like you're pretty close to the end at this point)."
brownman,3apeeo,joshi38,168,Tue Jun 23 13:50:23 2015 UTC,"I've found most content still enjoyable. Actually MC let's plays have been a lot better for last few weeks, could just be the type of let's play they are doing, dunno, but that is a thing. I do miss Ray's humor occasionally, and the fact that he actually could figure out how to play a game quicker, thus helping them to get past certain parts or figuring out mechanics quicker."
brownman,3apeeo,Malecious,13,Mon Jun 22 13:52:06 2015 UTC,"There are definitely some videos that fall flat for me for no specific reason. Usually I just find the game mechanics boring. I don't watch any videos in MOBA type games, Destiny or MMOs because I just find they're not conducive of fun to watch gameplay. GTA has pretty much been the same. MC has been better. I do find myself missing Ray's quick wit and attitude every once in a while, plus it'd be nice, as you said, for Ray to be there to school them every once in a while, when it's taking them forever to figure out fairly straightforward mechanics (I understand that's much more of a challenge when doing running commentary)."
brownman,3apeeo,Bardlar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:45:58 2015 UTC,This is exactly the way I feel! Although i could not put it into words.
brownman,3apeeo,Dr_Guude,159,Thu Jun 25 06:24:49 2015 UTC,"I'm actually the opposite. Minecraft in particular is way better right now, at least in my opinion. Not ragging on Ray, I like the guy, but he very openly did not enjoy that game and it took a toll on the series.  I enjoy the new voices every so often, as well as getting Team B in on more Let's Plays. I could be in the minority with this opinion, but I think Achievement Hunter and Ray benefited from his leaving."
brownman,3apeeo,FailureFinch,263,Mon Jun 22 15:05:53 2015 UTC,"Good comment, let me add on to this. It's clear I was totally burnt out on Minecraft (and GTA V). We filmed so many Let's Plays & Things To Do's I felt there was nothing left to do. Not to mention all the technical issues that happened, whether it was the game not working, the world not loading, the audio fucking up etc. Sometimes it felt like the game was actively working against us.  I would've loved to take a break for a while and cycle people in my spot, but I also knew that I couldn't. Let's Play Minecraft was (and probably still is) AH's flagship show. They always wanted the ""main six"" in it because it was one of the few games where all of us could play together and it gave us a lot of views.   I'm happy the other staff are getting their time in Let's Plays (and other videos). Those guys/girls are very talented and funny people. I just wish the community would lighten up and give them a chance. I know a lot of people like them, but the vocal minority is so brutal sometimes.   I agree both AH & I benefited from my departure. I'm happy being a full time streamer. The freedom to play what I want, when I want is amazing. I understand not everyone enjoys watching streams and that's understandable. You can't please everyone, but I do my best. AH still makes great content with even more personalities now, and you don't have my lame ass bringing everything down haha."
brownman,3apeeo,RNarvaezJr,45,Tue Jun 23 05:20:26 2015 UTC,"If anything, your lame ass made everyone's day. But it's your choice, and as a community, we respect it!"
brownman,3apeeo,Xylow,18,Tue Jun 23 05:23:42 2015 UTC,Ray said 'main six!' Ray confirmed for... well... never mind actually.
brownman,3apeeo,PlantedChaos,5,Tue Jun 23 08:22:31 2015 UTC,He is obviously Apple Jack
brownman,3apeeo,ExpAwesome,5,Tue Jun 23 19:05:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying!   Obviously your negativity towards Minecraft wasn't the only thing making the series suffer, I apologize if I made it sound like that. Not my intention! Just taking out that one factor helped to bring some new life to it.  Your lame ass didn't bring everything down, you just needed a change in scenery to really shine. :)"
brownman,3apeeo,FailureFinch,4,Tue Jun 23 12:39:16 2015 UTC,"I enjoy watching your streams, the only problem with me tuning in is the fact that I live in the UK which means you stream at weird times here which is unfortunate"
brownman,3apeeo,VanillaCoke223,3,Tue Jun 23 05:57:06 2015 UTC,"Comments like this are why you're awesome, Ray. Keep being awesome. :)"
brownman,3apeeo,Troggie42,2,Tue Jun 23 19:50:41 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you're happy Ray, but I gotta admit I still miss ya. Looking forward to whatever videos you end up hopping in on as a guest in the future."
brownman,3apeeo,Defguru,2,Tue Jun 23 12:53:52 2015 UTC,"I've really enjoyed the let's plays with the bonus guys. I've really liked the ones with Jeremy and Max Kruemke or whatever his name is (that Stop It Slender was one of the funniest videos I've seen since you left). Altogether, I do prefer this way over the previous one. Happy Ray is better than bored Ray."
brownman,3apeeo,reed17,2,Tue Jun 23 16:57:51 2015 UTC,I thought you're tone in Minecraft and GTAV was hilarious.  It made it less so to know it wasn't an act (i.e. playing the straight man).    Personally I loved you in AH since day 1 and was sad to have you leave buy enjoy your streams and uploads more and AH more now.
brownman,3apeeo,Rooster667,2,Tue Jun 23 18:16:13 2015 UTC,"I'm happy the other staff are getting their time in Let's Plays (and other videos). Those guys/girls are very talented and funny people. I just wish the community would lighten up and give them a chance. I know a lot of people like them, but the vocal minority is so brutal sometimes.    I think the problem is people want the 'main six' - even though AH didn't start with all of you six, that's what people came to associate it with for a long time, and like you said Minecraft is probably the flagship show which only strengthens that perception.   I kinda feel like that main group (even if it's less one now) is the core of the channel, and should remain so... or at least, it should be understood if people don't like that change. For example, I really like the Funhaus guys, but I don't think it's a great idea to be putting their videos on the AH channel - if people wanted to watch Funhaus, they would go to the Funhaus channel (and many do). Crossover stuff excluded, of course."
brownman,3apeeo,caninehere,2,Tue Jun 23 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"The FH vids on the Let's Play channel are to bring more eyes to Funhaus. Not everyone knows Funhaus exists, so that's kinda to help them out. Also, it was only two mod vids, the last of which was some weeks ago.  BTW, IG coming to RT is so freaking awesome"
brownman,3apeeo,HammletHST,2,Wed Jun 24 12:41:54 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I love Ray and I love AH but Ray is happier doing his own thing and playing whatever games he likes. AH is happier with doing there thing. If Ray is happy then I'm happy.
brownman,3apeeo,Papasimmons,3,Tue Jun 23 05:44:30 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere that it's because now the new MC's are very talk/chat oriented not some special elaborate thing that the build team has made for them. The last MC episode I thoroughly enjoyed was legends of the hidden tower. Personally couldn't care for minecraft anyway, it's very clear they're doing it cause it'll get them a ton of views."
brownman,3apeeo,resillience-,3,Mon Jun 22 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree. They still do things that the build team made for them, and I miss Ray a lot. Every time I see someone jumping around all I can think of is ""Parkour!""  But yeah, everyone seems a bit more cheerful. It's possible they felt bad about Ray being forced to playing?"
brownman,3apeeo,thekey147,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:19:33 2015 UTC,"So, you don't watch them anymore, but you say ""it's very clear they're doing it cause it'll get them a ton of views."" How would you know? As someone who actually does watch, I can tell you that they've talked multiple times about how much they enjoy playing again. Hell, for the last epusode, Michael said he spent hours setting up the LP on his own time over the weekend, and he had fun doing it. So why don't you at least get a clue before you make broad assumptions?"
brownman,3apeeo,Kicking222,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:22:24 2015 UTC,Someone (I think Geoff) said that mine raft gets them an easy million views each one. You realise it's possible to like doing something and doing something because itll get a ton of views? They aren't mutually exclusive.

They used to be quality and hilarious LPs, but then they became punch a golem to death, fail to get enough gold, and the fourth fucking fishing tourney. There's the odd quality one, but those are fewer and fewer, haven't seen one since Tornado mod"
brownman,3apeeo,JamSa,86,Tue Jun 23 16:56:35 2015 UTC,"Ray and Gavin are (were) pretty much my favorites on AH. AH is still watchable without Ray, but I notice his absence for sure.  During group LPs, Ray made the best jokes, but he would say them so quietly that you had to work to catch them."
brownman,3apeeo,Iron_Spike,3,Mon Jun 22 14:55:46 2015 UTC,I always loved the occasional weird reference said under the breath
brownman,3apeeo,HammletHST,8,Wed Jun 24 12:43:49 2015 UTC,"Amen to all this, although I definitely don't watch AH as much as I used to. The GTAIV LPs may have been the high point for AH, at least in my view."
brownman,3apeeo,tytbone,23,Tue Jun 23 15:18:05 2015 UTC,"Ray was my favorite, but I still like their stuff. Jeremy has some Ray-like moments at times that I like. Ryan and Michael are my 2 favs now."

brownman,3apeeo,HammletHST,10,Wed Jun 24 12:45:12 2015 UTC,"It started for me before Ray left, I don't know what it is but I'm just done with AH. It started with everything becoming stale except for GTA and Minecraft. Then Minecraft became stale and GTA a while later as well. Guess I'll be waiting until I watch more videos"
brownman,3apeeo,rodinj,117,Tue Jun 23 13:23:56 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, I stopped watching AH after Ray left. Not because Ray was keeping me engaged but I just felt the quality of the shows had declined rapidly around the same time. Even if Ray had stayed, I probably would've stopped anyway.   It's a shame because Funhaus manages to keep me engaged in almost every video they make. I don't get why I'm having issues with AH so much these days. It just feels ""same-y"" I guess."
brownman,3apeeo,OfficialGarwood,52,Mon Jun 22 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what happened to me. I always liked Ray, but he wasn't ever my favorite, but ever since he left, ive watched a few videos here and there, mainly mini golf, but not much more.  Then I started to watch Funhaus, and I had never watched IG, but I love them now, and watch them with the same 'gusto' that I used to watch AH vids. It's weird."
brownman,3apeeo,ACancerousTwzlr,11,Tue Jun 23 00:44:24 2015 UTC,"I'm on the same boat as you. My AH consumption was definitely decreasing, and with Ray departing it didn't really help (I was a ray fan). I'll still watch the occasional AH vid, but now that same enthusiasm I used to have there is pointed at Funhaus.  Having no experience with IG, I've gone back to watch their back catalog because I'm just loving their entire dynamic. Them popping up in my subscription box is eagerly awaited every week."
brownman,3apeeo,noclip1,3,Tue Jun 23 14:32:15 2015 UTC,"Same. I still watch a fair amount of AH content, just maybe more selective instead of watching every video they released regardless of what it was. I'll probably skip a video here and there. But Funhaus is my everyday goto for videos now and I'm really really enjoying them. I think I've been caught up with everything Funhaus has released since launch. Are you just going IG's videos from oldest to new and watching them in that order? I was thinking about doing this but wasn't sure how to go about it."
brownman,3apeeo,TK102,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:58:26 2015 UTC,"Well they are doing an ""old video a day"" on /r/funhaus, so there's a good place to start!"

brownman,3apeeo,PaynusInTheAnus,4,Tue Jun 23 15:51:36 2015 UTC,"Truth for me too. (I'm really glad I found out about classic Inside Gaming thanks to Funhaus.) I just wish Funhaus would put out more 10 min. gaming videos; I don't watch their hour-long ""podcast""-esque content."
brownman,3apeeo,tytbone,10,Tue Jun 23 15:19:41 2015 UTC,"Funhaus works because of their short content. They usually play for about an hour and then edit out the boring stuff, while keeping in the jokes/successful runs in games. If they kept their videos long, they'd basically just be Achievement Hunter."
brownman,3apeeo,GrilledCyan,2,Tue Jun 23 18:32:48 2015 UTC,I agree but I wish we would get more of their short content more often. Right now it seems like we're getting two-three 10-15 min. gaming videos a week. (Maybe I don't see how difficult that is to do but I wish we could get at least one gaming 10-15 min gaming video a day during the work week.)
brownman,3apeeo,tytbone,2,Tue Jun 23 18:50:01 2015 UTC,"I chalk that up to their content being spread across more than one channel. At Inside Gaming, they did the news every day in addition to their game play vids, Q&A, and podcast. Now all of that content is over on The Know. I wish they'd put their faces on the thumbnails so I knew which ones the Funhaus guys were in. Nothing against Ashley and Meg at all, I just like more of the FH guys when I can get them. And while I agree that more content would be nice, I don't want them burning themselves out at all.  In response to the difficulty of putting out content, they have to record for an hour or do before editing, and then editing takes even longer than that. They could hire more editors, but I think then you run the risk of videos losing their personal charm in the hands of someone who may not totally get their style."
brownman,3apeeo,GrilledCyan,2,Tue Jun 23 19:34:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't Know they did much for The Know! Maybe I'll check out that channel then."
brownman,3apeeo,tytbone,2,Tue Jun 23 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"It doesn't always work, but the easy shorthand for finding their stuff on the know is to look for longer videos 5-8 minutes with extremely clickbait-y titles, which I'm pretty sure are put there entirely because they think it's funny to piss off fanboys."
brownman,3apeeo,natethomas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that trend, too. Though they get RT to make more clickbait titles these days, so I guess they had to step up their game to stand out from...themselves? I don't know."
brownman,3apeeo,GrilledCyan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:45:11 2015 UTC,"which I'm pretty sure are put there entirely because they think it's funny to piss off fanboys.   I wouldn't say that's the entire reason. I believe they've mentioned in some past video that the main reason they use those ""clickbait"" titles is because, well, they work. YouTube is flooded with videos, and they need to do what they have to in order to get views."
brownman,3apeeo,V2Blast,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:39:05 2015 UTC,"Even back at IG, I could never get myself to watch the IGDaily's.

brownman,3apeeo,HammletHST,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when IG started doing daily videos (but before game plays) is when I fell of the bandwagon and rediscovered RT and AH videos. Weird how the opposite thing is happening now."

brownman,3apeeo,HammletHST,2,Wed Jun 24 18:28:19 2015 UTC,"As someone who feels like AH has become way oversaturated with content, I really like Funhaus' approach. I can actually watch all their videos and not feel like I'm wasting time. I think part of it is just me moving out of the target demo for AH's stuff, which is a shame, but smaller bursts of more focused content is better for me (I feel the same way about Ray's streams - if I can hop on to watch him I will but watching hours of a stream is not something I can do on a regular basis)."
brownman,3apeeo,caninehere,-7,Tue Jun 23 21:31:25 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how people like their videos tbh, I actually tried to like them and i couldn't, Everything they do just seems to be forced."
brownman,3apeeo,DeclanH1996,6,Tue Jun 23 10:34:14 2015 UTC,"Well...It's not forced.they just have a different style of comedy.A different schtick... They like to do their comedy in ""bit""s of comedy like the guys over at sourcefednerd,etc, and also by just letting the game play out and joke about it like AH. They are like the Best of both Worlds(With regards to their comedic style) and i guess that's why people like them so much"
brownman,3apeeo,Radishman1,3,Tue Jun 23 11:44:39 2015 UTC,"I quit watching RT content about 2 years ago and AH content just a little while ago. I feel like a lot of RT content is made just to push content out, like RT Life. And AH seems to have gone to please a younger audience. Also I think I've seen them so much they've become boring and predictable, ""oh look at that Gavin did something stupid, oh look Michael is being angry or something"". Funhaus for some reason feels more ""grown up"".  This is just my opinion so don't think I'm attacking either RT or AH, just saying I don't enjoy them anymore."
brownman,3apeeo,dumdeedoodah,3,Tue Jun 23 17:06:27 2015 UTC,"I took a break from AH while studying for finals back in April, and I can't get back into it. I don't know why. I watch GTA still but I'm a month or more behind on Minecraft, and even further behind on everything else. I keep up with RvB and listen to the podcast as I go to work or play the right type of game, but nothing else. I just can't keep up. But I'm constantly waiting for Funhaus vids to go up. The reason I like them is the same reason I think I can't get back in to Achievement Hunter: they're unpredictable. Every video is different, and I won't just be waiting for Gavin to mess up his words or Ryan to say something outrageous and creepy. I may get Adam failing at driving a forklift or an in depth story and personal history of an NPC stuck in a lamp post. An it's short. I can laugh for a good 10-20 minutes rather than sit through 50 minutes waiting for one riff out of Michael or Geoff. I love the AH guys as much as ever but I just don't have time for them anymore."
brownman,3apeeo,GrilledCyan,3,Tue Jun 23 18:49:49 2015 UTC,"I love the AH guys as much as ever but I just don't have time for them anymore.   As someone who is out of school for a while now and living the full-time-job-and-then-some life, I definitely identify with this - and the same goes for Ray's content, even though I like it more than AH's stuff. It's just too much content, too much time - but Ray is a streamer and not making YouTube videos, so it makes sense. Funhaus is a nice little package of fun that is easily consumable on a busy schedule - it's not even that I don't want to sit 50 minutes waiting for jokes, it's that I often can't."
brownman,3apeeo,caninehere,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:34:33 2015 UTC,"The babyhunter thing from demo disc may have been the funniest thing ever, and it was entirely based on the expression of a single NPC. Those guys are geniuses sometimes."
brownman,3apeeo,natethomas,9,Tue Jun 23 20:18:45 2015 UTC,This. This right here. I have really come to love everything Funhaus is doing and it's really nice to see that they are doing so well.
brownman,3apeeo,perl314,4,Mon Jun 22 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"My LP watching was just AH for a long time, with a little bit of game grumps. Once funhaus came along  and the quality they put out (humour wise) I just can't watch AH anymore. It just feels too juvenile to me now compared to funhaus. And before people lose their minds, I'm not saying funhaus is mature but the way James and Bruce riff on each other is funny because they are joking with each other, where AH seems more reacting to what there are doing. I dunno just my opinion but I haven't watched any AH for a while now and I'm ok with it."
brownman,3apeeo,Dualmilion,3,Tue Jun 23 13:17:18 2015 UTC,"I love it because James and Bruce match my style of humor perfectly. Making up some story about the things they see, doing voices and acting out scenes is what I love."
brownman,3apeeo,GrilledCyan,2,Tue Jun 23 18:43:01 2015 UTC,"You are not alone. Funhaus is the AH of 2012- fresh, new, and funny!"
brownman,3apeeo,torik0,3,Tue Jun 23 21:35:47 2015 UTC,"I would say that while they're definitely new to a lot of people, they're also a lot smaller and don't push out so much content that it just becomes monotonous. It seems like channels just get shittier and shittier the bigger they get. More censored, more controlled..."
brownman,3apeeo,reddit409,2,Wed Jun 24 00:09:57 2015 UTC,"I like Funhaus, but I think the reason I like AH more is because AH feels more diverse in personality.  The Funhaus guys are funny, but they just don't feel as different from each other."
brownman,3apeeo,Lucienofthelight,2,Wed Jun 24 03:56:01 2015 UTC,"I honestly feel like I grew out of AH. Maybe it's just being in college and being around more mature people, but AH humor seems like ""silly"" humor now. I still watch Funhaus pretty consistently and I feel that their content aimed at an older demographic with the shorter video lengths and such. I tune in to Ray's streams when I have free time, but that's something I rarely have nowadays."
brownman,3apeeo,akoro,2,Wed Jun 24 04:29:05 2015 UTC,I just feel there is so much more content out there for me to watch to stick with AH and all of their videos. I don't particularly care for many of the B-Team and I realize that could be growing pains but the thing is I don't have to watch those videos and instead can watch something I enjoy fully.
brownman,3apeeo,Zero_Heart,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:05:29 2015 UTC,I find I can't get into Funhaus at all. It comes off as way to 'bro'ey to me. I always liked Roosterteeth stuff because it was a bigger mix of characters of different ages and gaming skill levels.
brownman,3apeeo,itripovermyownfeet,2,Wed Jun 24 14:37:10 2015 UTC,"I'm I'm the same boat as you. I love AH, still my favorite channel, but shortly after Ray left I slowly stopped watching little by little, and it wasn't because Ray isn't there. I still go and watch from time to time but I felt myself gravitating towards Fun Haus more and more. For some reason I feal their content skyrocketed as AH slowly declined. One of the main reasons I fell in love with AH is because of their group dynamic and lately it feels a bit lack luster. Like I said I still love AH and I can't wait for that one video that just blows me away and drags me right back in."
brownman,3apeeo,SJokerC,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:27:01 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, I think the Funhaus guys even mentioned that they are very different styles of videos, with AH shows being longer and appealing to a younger audience while Funhaus videos are shorter and are supposedly watched by older people (because they usually have less time).  I had to take a break from all internet for like a year, and this was when AH exploded in content. I still love them and, like everyone, there are some videos that are better than others, but I generally like almost everything they put out. I'm stil catching up on AH because they have so much content, and I haven't gotten to the point where Ray has left, and at this point the only thing I watch as soon as it comes out is AHWU.  Funhaus I started watching recently too, and I never saw them on IG. They have less content and so it's been a little easier to get up to speed (IIRC I'm up to date on Open Haus, Dude Soup, Arthaus/Questions and Demo Disk). I'll try to catch up to everything eventually, but AH has so much content it's easier to get up with Funhaus and then make my slow climb on AH's mountain of content. I also try to catch Ray's stream as much as I can but it's very difficult, but I still try because I want to support the guy, he's always been great at entertaining all of us."
brownman,3apeeo,Ronny070,17,Tue Jun 23 13:18:06 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite. I'm not interested in Ray's stuff. I want to be, but I can't always go to his streams, and when he uploads them, they're SO LONG. I can't see myself watching 4-8 hours of a stream. He should just make highlights."
brownman,3apeeo,bluepanda5,3,Tue Jun 23 03:32:56 2015 UTC,I think he should hire some day laborers to produce highlight videos!

brownman,3apeeo,MDawnblade,5,Mon Jun 22 18:48:42 2015 UTC,I tend to watch the MC let's plays. But other then that meh. I unsubbed from RT months ago cause it was just getting old. Luke Burnie never on podcasts they just suck without him.   As for AH I check out some stuff. But 90% of the time if they have someone new in there I don't watch it. I watched quite a few let's builds with the side group an really was not a fan of any of them.
brownman,3apeeo,MrMakanhoes,3,Tue Jun 23 03:24:09 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that Burnie-less podcasts are terrible, but there have been a few great ones in the last few months. There are still pockets when Burnie's not there and I stop watching, but when he does show up he's still as great as ever! :)"
brownman,3apeeo,InfantStomper,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:11:24 2015 UTC,I use to watch for Gus be he seems to be getting older an duller imo.
brownman,3apeeo,MrMakanhoes,8,Tue Jun 23 14:50:36 2015 UTC,Ill maintain the fact that the podcast took a huge nose dive in quality when it switched from audio to video. I used to listen every week and now I dont watch at all. I tried for like 60 videos but it definitely wasnt the same.
brownman,3apeeo,Shiniholum,4,Tue Jun 23 18:03:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. Now that they can do a lot of their content visually, I miss out on the jokes because I still listen to the audio podcast. I don't have the time to sit down and watch a two hour podcast. And since they started the Patch, they moved all gaming discussion out, and I can't get into the Patch because it's more of a ""let's discuss the news"" than a natural flow of conversation. The podcast is a lot of playing to their established characters, and creating jokes to put in Animated Adventures or put on shirts to sell, I feel."
brownman,3apeeo,GrilledCyan,5,Tue Jun 23 19:00:42 2015 UTC,"I missed just how much of a hodgepodge the original podcast was. I miss the sports talk, I miss the lost talk, I miss the video game talk, I miss the movie talk. Even though I didn't watch lost and I hate sports I still loved listening to them just talk about anything and not care about sponsors or cuts or offending anyone."
brownman,3apeeo,Shiniholum,2,Tue Jun 23 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"The sponsors I don't mind, and I don't think they censor themselves more than they used to. The reason they weren't sponsored earlier is because nobody wanted to sponsor anything with the word ""drunk"" in it. They even used to censor their own sports talk in he older podcasts (or at least tell Jack to shut up) because they knew it didn't appeal to their core audience."
brownman,3apeeo,GrilledCyan,2,Tue Jun 23 19:42:26 2015 UTC,"Have you tried the Internet Box? I only recently got into it but so far I'm loving it! Similar to you with sports I can't stand My Little Pony stuff but somehow the conversational tone of the podcast makes it bearable. It's also some of Ray's best comedy imo, since he really has to lead the show and talk a lot when Michael's not there. If you don't know where to start, this thread over on the IB subreddit has been great for me to pick out the more eventful episodes. My personal favorite is #15 if you want to check it out. :)"
brownman,3apeeo,InfantStomper,2,Tue Jun 23 21:12:38 2015 UTC,Thanks! I haven't listened to any of the IB podcast but it's just because I'm saving them for a rainy day Ya know. I still haven't watched the Minecraft episode where Ray leaves. If I don't watch it then it hasn't happened! (I kid)
brownman,3apeeo,Shiniholum,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:27:31 2015 UTC,When I started watching them they were already doing video. I don't think I could have done an audio only podcast with them.
brownman,3apeeo,MrMakanhoes,3,Tue Jun 23 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"Go back and listen to them. I'll maintain that they are some of the best original content RT has made. All those amazing RTAA's you've seen? Most of them come from the audio only podcast. I'll concede that since you started while they were video it might be hard to go back and just listen, but trust me nothing beats loading a podcast (let's say 23 which I like to listen to often) while you are cooking or driving or waiting in a line."
brownman,3apeeo,Shiniholum,2,Tue Jun 23 19:32:31 2015 UTC,"I generally agree with you.  I look forward to the podcast coming out and enjoy most of them.  That being said there have been episodes that I turn off.  They tend to be the ones where Burnie, Gavin or Gus are out and they sub in people who don't have a ton to say and just make the podcast about internal RT things rather than subjects that can appeal to a wider audience.    Even though Burnie and Gus were on it, I couldn't make it through this week's podcast.  I just wasn't interested in hearing about the logistics of their covering E3 -- and I have a huge threshold for E3 coverage.  I had Giant Bomb's coverage on in the background all last week.  But the podcast was all about them and their experience and not about anything that applies to anyone who's not them."
brownman,3apeeo,rubens4t,6,Thu Jun 25 12:58:33 2015 UTC,"I'm mixed on it.  On Minecraft, I think overall it has been better. When everyone is enjoying themselves, it makes the overall experience better because everyone is actually jovial and joking around. Now, I love Ray and especially salty Ray as well as some of the anger that comes from technical issues but it clearly takes a toll. I wish Ray could've just taken a break from certain series to get refreshed as well as lead RT in streaming but it clearly wasn't in the cards (and it has worked out tremendously well for Ray).  Other LPs I definitely miss him. Not so much GTA V (it honestly feels the same for a while now) but it'll be weird to not see him in another Worms LP. Ray definitely has more my sense of humor so I loved it when he was more engaged. Another Olympics game, any of the board games/game show/trivia games, or some other random gems (like Rainbow Six Vegas) will probably really miss Ray's wit.  That's not to say I think the quality has gone down because he left. Even though in the past 3 weeks there have been only 3 or 4 LPs that actually seemed engaging to me besides the weekly shows, there have been lulls in good content before when Ray was there. My favorite might be gone but I still love Michael, Ryan, and Gavin. Hell, even Geoff (when being evil or doing Trevor's voice) and Jack can be really funny given the circumstances. I'm sure that by a month or two, there will be a week of just amazing videos just like the last few times this has happened.   Unfortunately, I only have so many hours in the day so I usually end up not watching as much Ray content since he left. Not only is it a lot of content but some games just don't interest me or certain achievement grinding is pretty boring. I also think a lot of his humor comes from bouncing off of people. It works alright with streaming because of chat but my favorites are when he streams with Tina because it gives that extra person in real time to bounce jokes off of. I still try to catch what I can but sometimes it is difficult. Luckily, the rest of the community here picks up the slack to help support Ray since he does deserve it."
brownman,3apeeo,Dace67,15,Tue Jun 23 13:44:38 2015 UTC,Just waiting for when Ray walks into the AH office and they force him to play Minecraft Monopoly X.
brownman,3apeeo,AGreekLegend,5,Mon Jun 22 20:03:53 2015 UTC,"I got burned out on AH WAY before Ray left. I wasn't on the Internet much for about a week once, and AH in particular just left too much for me to catch up on, so I didn't even bother. I still watch general RT all the time (RT Life, On The Spot, RWBY when it comes back, stuff like that), and I binge the FUCK out of Funhaus every single day now."

I find myself watching Funhaus more nowadays. I dunno, I did stop watching AH once before, way before the let's plays started. I was able to get back into them..and have 100 episodes of minecraft to watch. So if this is just a phase, hey at least when I come back I'll have some great content to catch up on.  Edit: As far as Ray's stream goes, the only twitch streaming I ever used to watch was LCS games. I still don't watch a lot of Ray's streams, but I do hop on from time to time when I don't have much to do. He's the only streamer I care to watch at this point.   One thing I really enjoy about the stream is the variety of games Ray plays, he's playing Ben 10 right ffs. That's awesome."

brownman,3apeeo,PaynusInTheAnus,2,Tue Jun 23 15:55:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've watched all the Funhaus videos so now I'm just going through all the inside gaming videos. I don't know how I would compare the old stuff to the new stuff just yet, but I really do enjoy going through all the older videos. Especially since I'm caught up entirely with Funhaus's content."
brownman,3apeeo,KingoftheAnimus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"There's a few threads in /r/funhaus about their older series. I recommend the Sims 3, Chaser, Sins Episodes Emergence, Ride to Hell, and Sniper Elite 3. The Steam Roulette videos are hit or miss, there's a few golden ones but if you're just making your way through them one by one, you'll get a lot more average ones."
brownman,3apeeo,GrilledCyan,5,Tue Jun 23 18:56:16 2015 UTC,"For me, Ray leaving AH contributed to my lack of interest in their content but wasn't the cause.  I think it had more to do with Funhaus than anything. I hadn't seen any of their stuff before they joined RT, so I found their videos, style, and humor quite refreshing. They were also way more time friendly, though that seems to be changing a bit now a days.  Also after Ray left a lot of changes happened to AH. I don't think they were due purely because of Ray but I think a lot of the decision made were reactionary in nature. Either due to FunHaus or at the request of Matt/Burnie to go along with the other changes happening to RoosterTeeth as a whole. But that is all speculation on my part. Either way the sudden changes kind of lessened my interest further.  Now a days the only shows I really watch consistently are AHWU, GO & Versus. But I will say I disagree, I think bringing in new faces and having more Live Action crew in Let's Plays is refreshing. There have been some gems lately. I will miss Ray in certain videos because when he was enjoying the game, the chat and comedy was pure gold between him and the other AH crew.  As for his streaming though. I watched him all the time when he was still with AH but I feel like it was or it felt like it was shorter streams. Now that he's out on his own if I don't catch it live, which is often these days due to work, I can't really bring myself to watch them in full on YouTube. I'll skim for some good parts if I read about it on the subreddit but other than that I just don't watch them."

brownman,3apeeo,PaynusInTheAnus,4,Tue Jun 23 15:54:29 2015 UTC,"I've also been noticing a huge drop off in my interest for their content lately. And as much as I love Ray, and even though he was probably my favorite of the 6, I was honestly glad that he was going off to do something he loved and I don't think that's what is affecting my viewership.  I honestly believe Funhaus is the cause. AH was my main youtube source of content and I watched them every day, I became immersed in their attitude and tone. Getting the breath of fresh air that was FH I think really opened my eyes about AH. AH's just blatant apathy, cynicism, and half-assedness used to be charming but in comparison to FH just leaves them looking lackluster. It's so much nicer to tune into a video where I know they're enjoying themselves, where they're making each other laugh instead of spitting at each other, where they're putting in actual effort to edit and add content, and where they're being so very vocal and interactive and appreciative of fans. I think this is also why Jeremy has quickly become one of my favorites in AH videos and Blaine in RT: they are just generally positive and less cynical people. Watching them feels less like I'm watching someone slog through their day job and more like they're having actual fun. It sucks as a viewer to feel like what you're watching is a chore to be dealt with.  Watching Ray's emotional descent before he left in combination with the acquisition of FH has left me with a clearer view of AH and it's honestly just a sad sight. I hope they can get back to a level where they're actually excited to play games and to produce things for people."
brownman,3apeeo,awlfirwon,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:02:24 2015 UTC,"I think you bring up a good point about them liking their content. Burnie always says that the goal of Rooster Teeth is to ""Make content we would want to watch"". I think Achievement Hunter has really forgotten that ideal, and it shows. It isn't about making good videos anymore, it's about pumping out as many as they can. I liked AH Ray, those were some good times. But I think his departure was just the canary in the coal mine for the flaws in Achievement Hunter's practices.   ""Remember when we made good videos?"""
brownman,3apeeo,Write_Right_Reich,3,Thu Jun 25 23:34:09 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that I noticed a dip in my viewership once Ray left initially, especially when I fully embraced Funhaus.  I find myself more excited about a new Funhaus video than a new AH video these days, but I still watch them."
brownman,3apeeo,Urndra,3,Tue Jun 23 01:43:24 2015 UTC,"I have such a hard time with any of it anymore. I'm not a big Twitch guy besides my Norwegian buddy tranQ. I'm following like 25ish people, and I like all of them. But the timing factor to Twitch for catching streams is just so annoying. Ray was by far my favorite AH member, and I do like his streams (the chat can be annoying but that's seemingly how it is for anyone with over 200 people in at any time). It just seems so much more convenient to watch Youtube sometimes (as much as sometimes it's hard for me to find consistent content I like). That doesn't mean I don't try to catch the stream every now and again though. Another small nitpick I have against Ray is that I feel like his chemistry just works better when there's others around him. That's not to say he's not funny solo though. I'M STILL WAITING FOR YOU TO BE ON GUEST GRUMPS GODDAMNIT! But in all seriousness Ray, I'm just glad you're having fun!  AH was always generally pretty hit and miss for me, but I would usually watch most videos just because they were there. Ray's sillyness was something I looked forward too. Not that I dislike everyone else's humor, it's just that his resonates with me the most. I'm a 21 year old guy that enjoys the stupidest (I mean no disrespect and it's certainly not negative Ray, I just couldn't think of a better word) of humor. That's why I enjoy Game Grumps so much (although their videos are also very hit and miss by series as well). I always felt like Ray brought that sort of ""I'm just going to say something because I can"" humor to the table. Some of the humor coming from the other guys seems very thought out and honestly sometimes kind of fake just to try and make something funny happen in a conversation. Now I'll still watch AH let's plays when there's absolutely nothing better to do. Sadly I just don't look forward to it as much I used to.   HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. I have ALWAYS felt the way I do now about AH. What I mean is that AH is 100% always funnier when they enjoyed what they were playing. I don't care what game it is. I've watched them since the beginning of their let's plays, and that has always held true. As long as they are actually having fun playing, it's more fun to watch because they don't have to try and be funny. It just is. This applies to Ray's time there as well. You ever seen the ""Loud Ray Is Best Ray"" video? Exactly. That's why I don't understand why AH plays half the games they play. I know they want to play new games and games the community suggest. However, I would say screw the community if what they want to play isn't fun for them. If the game's not fun to them, the video won't be good, which would result in the fans not liking it. This means they just wasted their time to begin with. I mean seriously. In the part 2 (I think it was the most recent MC video but I could be wrong) of the new dragon hunt a few of them said they just played MC for the first time in a long time at home and loved it so much. Then why do they play all these little mini games that they don't like? After episode 200, they should do a mini series of like 10 episodes where like two or maybe three people just play the game. I don't know. The point is all those times Geoff has said ""this is the best thing ever."" Why don't they go back to those if they had so much fun? My favorite thing to do is just put Game Grumps or AH (specifically videos like the Saints Row ones) videos on just because I like to listen to them ramble on or tell stories. That kind of stuff comes way more naturally when you're enjoying yourself."

Such as when he would poke the bear, by asking geoff about swapping for a Blastoise card, ""it sounds like your saying blast doors"". Yes gavins not that much older but now he's settled down with Meg he's definatly mellowed out. Definatly miss Rays antics."

brownman,3apeeo,TotesMessenger,2,Tue Jun 23 11:06:08 2015 UTC,"I'm the opposite, I haven't really watched any of Ray's streams since he left AH (only ones I've been able to fully watch have been story games like GTAV, TTBL and Life is Strange) but have watched almost every AH video they've put out. He can be very entertaining at certain times, and that's the problem, there tends to be lulls in the commentary that just kill mood, for me at least. It's one of the reasons why no one else besides Micheal can do a FullPlay of a game. Most of the AH guys couldn't keep the commentary going with a group of six people, let alone by themselves. IMO Ray seemed better fit for an edited video series, where he could take out the bland parts of the commentary, rather than a live one."
brownman,3apeeo,Mystic_Taco,2,Tue Jun 23 05:13:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like AH can be interesting when their content isn't just GTA and Minecraft. In Minecraft, I feel like they're repeating the same things over and over. The first year or so of Minecraft was the best. GTA 4 was great but now GTA 5 is ending up like Minecraft. The high point of the GTA 5 was everybody's personal heist.   I loved watching the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas video and the Mini Golf series. Playing new games makes for better conversation. Yet, I know for a fact that GTA and Minecraft get the most views and generate the most revenue. They are a business and their goal is to make money.   That is why I'm just in love with FunHaus. They have diverse content and Adam Kovic."

brownman,3apeeo,Metal_Devil,2,Tue Jun 23 18:46:37 2015 UTC,"I stopped watching Ray and AH, I love them all but I didn't enjoy minecraft or GTA v and the only reason I stuck around was for Ray's jokes and him hating on the game, but I never watched them play games I didn't enjoy, and if I did I did it to listen to ray raging at Gavin.    When Ray left I figured it was great, more Ray solo and for longer? That's amazing, so I watched his first stream, I loved it and that was it, his streams are just too late, watching from 11pm til 5am just isn't normal, fuck I love ray but that's commitment I can't put into anything.    Than there is his YT channel, I want to watch the videos but it's not the same when it isn't live..    So I ended up watching nobody which was good for me because I raised in the last 2 months my GPA by 1, more time for studying, bit when I take a break I have one group to listen to who I love dearly, Funhaus is Ray6, their jokes are mature like Ray's, their videos are edited amazingly, they aren't douches like Gavin, and I have a place in my heart who use Android and are a part of the PCMasteRace, and RT acquiring IGis basically to me the best thing ever.    But I do feel bad, I used to watch AH so much and love them, hell I wanted to fly to Austin just to meet them, I still enjoy dome of their videos but most of the time I just ignore them in my sub box, I watch series like Go and VS because they have a bit of IRL footage in them but games like Destiny and the MMO they went to Berlin for are just boring to me.    I wish to watch more Ray but time zones are a bitch"
brownman,3apeeo,Droxcy,2,Tue Jun 23 20:26:33 2015 UTC,I mainly just watch Funhaus now while tuning into some shows from AH. RT I just watch podcasts.

Ray's streams are always fun though I almost never watch a full video or stream I always enjoy what I watch which honestly surprised me, I didn't think I'd care for Ray's streams. AH lately seems to be getting more lively (especially Michael) which is why I think I'm getting back into it."
brownman,3apeeo,lunchboxx1090,2,Tue Jun 23 22:41:43 2015 UTC,"I'm still watching AH and RT content, but I also have been noticing the decline in quality recently. Ray leaving RT was sad, but understandable in my opinion.  While I can't tune into EVERY stream he does due to the same problems /u/JHawkInc has mentioned, I still catch his streams on youtube though, even if I have to watch some of them in parts due to their length (6 hours of undead nightmare? JEBUS!)."
brownman,3apeeo,JNaps95,2,Wed Jun 24 05:02:25 2015 UTC,"I've had a reverse effect, I don't watch Ray as much anymore but continue to watch AH just as much. Ray was never my number 1 (all hail the Mad King)"
brownman,3apeeo,jruzeck,2,Fri Jun 26 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"To be honest I do not because I personally thought Ray was one of the funniest members of AH. Also because after a while Gavin annoys me with his shenanigans. I love Gavin do no get me wrong he is funny and talented it is just sometimes I actually want to see progression in a heist or on minecraft or something and most of the time Gavin hinders that and since Ray is gone there is no counter to that so  I do not enjoy it as much anymore. Ryan, Jack and Geoff are also wonderful but I feel like Geoff hardly talks in any of the let's plays unless it is to yell at Gavin. Then Michael is great too but him and Ray as a combo was some of the best stuff but yeah these are my personal opinions so sorry if I hurt anyone's feelings."
brownman,3apeeo,xKnightlightx,4,Sun Jun 28 23:20:29 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say I'm not interested in AH anymore, but it's definitely waned since he left. Next to Gavin, Ray was my favorite. I enjoy Funhaus more than AH now but I still watch most of their stuff."
brownman,3apeeo,Beeker575,2,Tue Jun 23 01:00:46 2015 UTC,I've found myself watching less of AH and of Ray since he left idk why. Think a mix of what others are saying and not having time to watch the long streams he posts on youtube.
brownman,3apeeo,Spaghyeti,2,Tue Jun 23 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell for this, but I haven't watched an Achievement Hunter video since Ray left.  I had been wavering on whether or not I still liked Achievement Hunter for a while, and when he left it just seemed like a good time to stop watching. Don't get me wrong, it's nothing against them, they put out quality content consistently, but I feel like I kind of grew out of their humor.  I've absolutely fallen in love with Funhaus though."

brownman,3apeeo,SheepishEmpire,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"For me, I definitely have watched a lot less of AH. Not just because Ray left, but a lot of the games they have played lately haven't really sparked my interest. Go and Versus are my two shows I usually watch on a weekly basis, with the occasional Minecraft LP. Real life caught up to me so I don't have as much time. Unfortunately I don't always have the time to watch Ray's streams. Lately it's been watching VODs for background noise while I do homework or am falling asleep. Still got my BrownCrown for when I do get the chance to watch it live though."
brownman,3apeeo,Stanty16,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:20:53 2015 UTC,"It was clear that Ray wasn't enjoying AH as much as he once did, and seeing him enjoy his Streaming career is great and I commend him for that.  Personally, I think at the time Ray left, it happened to be when all of the ""YouTubing"" started, with the end cards for subscribing and all that. It started to feel more like view-farming rather than just enjoying the games they're playing (maybe that's just me?). I feel like that's part of the Fullscreen influence, which I was personally quite vocally troubled by at the time.  As for Rays input into videos, he had some of the classic one-liners, come backs, sarcastic comments and some great humour, that I think some of the recent content lacks. The rest of the team are great and talented, but maybe my humour just relates to Ray's humour more than the others. After all, many of my favourite AH videos has had Ray as a major feature, like the Minigolf Lets Plays, which I still consider some of the best AH videos to date.  Has AH declined since Ray left? Depends on how you look at it, but I think it's more that a lot of formats and production methods changed around the same time which threw a lot of us off"
brownman,3apeeo,Kicking222,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:50:04 2015 UTC,"I can't say I've missed Ray in AH too much, but that's because I've still got Ray, and I've still got AH.

brownman,3apeeo,jozwales,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:49:23 2015 UTC,"I just think that AH has been telling the same story for a while and without Ray it takes away a story option. Yes Ray got bored sometimes but to be honest he was always a variable. Now it is the same story Gavin is the silly guy who is ""dumb"" and ""bad"" at video games. Michael does some pop culture jokes and gets angry. Jack is ""whacky"" Ryan murders things says sorry fight with Gavin. And geoff has recently taken up the role of being the variable but that is mostly him yelling or getting mad. The best lets plays in the past few months were with Andrew Panton just because they changed the story of the Let's Play. Things can get stale and they have enough talent to reinvent themselves just like how Ray has become a very good streamer."
brownman,3apeeo,boxcarsteve,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:01:31 2015 UTC,"I checked out of RT/AH stuff a while ago. Ray was my favorite crew member out of the company; Ray,Michael, and Kerry were the only ones I followed on twitter after I quit watching RT/AH stuff. When I heard Ray was leaving I was super happy cause now I could watch Ray content, but without it being RT/AH content. I had fun while it lasted, but somethings just got to me where I just did not like how the company and the fans acted. I can safely say my favorite things that the people from RT did were outside the company; things like Internet Box, Ray's streams, and Michael's solo vids. AH and RT mean a lot to some people, but I slowly became more jaded toward any of their content and crew members, till I totally just dropped them from my watch lists."

Throwing new people in an expecting there to be a connection is unrealistic. The comedy in the videos comes from knowing each other so well. Ray, I think one thing that would've killed playing GTA that much was that Ryan and/or Gavin would fuck up the ≤ 15 minute prep time. Was that part of it?"

I truly feel that Ray is better solo, and the people they're using to fill in Ray's place add extra energy to the AH videos. The only problem I have with AH is the sheer volume of content they're putting out, it's impossible to watch them all.  edit: Change, not chance."

brownman,3apeeo,Ionlygoonrrt,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:27:33 2015 UTC,"Personally I think AH is better since Ray left. Not because it was HIM that left, but because him leaving created an opening for Geoff to cycle in more people, bringing in more guests, using the people in the office whose sense of humor we haven't been so exposed to making videos feel fresh.  And Mica has been in a couple of videos since he left and she's probably one of my favorite people to ever be in a Let's Play. (Especially when she does stuff with Lindsay, Lindsay and Mica has such amazing chemistry, them together on On The Spot, and Trivial Pursuit is the best thing ever)"

brownman,3apeeo,theDEVIN8310,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:02:26 2015 UTC,"I originally thought that I would really miss having Ray in the videos, but it took me going back and rewatching old videos to realize just how much he'd grown sick of it, and how much of a toll it had on his interaction with the game. His contributions, although still wonderful, weren't what they used to be, and I would much rather have him go stream full time, and maybe come back and film a random AH video every once in a while whenever he feels up to it, than have him be dragged through every video: I feel the overall contribution would be larger that way.   All of that said, there were a few months where I had lost everything I had, and the closest thing I had to social interaction was watching these jackasses play games, and I grew to almost think of them as actual people and care about how they feel, even if Ray is a dirty Hispanic. AH has been doing a bunch of new shit and dumping things that don't work, I think that's why people perceive it as a loss of quality.   Fuck you though for abandoning me Ray."
brownman,3apeeo,Clayguru,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:16:21 2015 UTC,"It flips for me. I like the gtav and minecraft lets plays, however I hate their other lets plays. I feel like minecraft and gtav got better after Ray left, and their other videos are just boring now   Minecraft and gtav have a lot of little things happening,  like Gavin doing something dumb, Ryan murdering, Jack finding some small detail enjoyable, and I think that Ray is missed, but that hole is filled by their editing.  Where I feel like they can not fill Ray's shoes are the other lets plays. I enjoy Ray getting pissed during rainbow 6, his golfing montage shots, and other care free randomness that he brought. Seeing Ray laying on the ground and snipe Geoff from two feet away was my favorite moment by far. Nobody else is really like that. Gavin tries to dick everyone over, Jack keeps to himself, Ryan is crazy, and Geoff is kind of bad at games in a funny way. Michael is the closest to that Ray humor I am missing, but he is not care free enough.  I use to love the other lets plays they did because I enjoyed Ray in them. He even made Trivial Pursuit funny for me. Now I just can not stand them. It's alright though. When I need a quick fix of Ray, I simply watch a video on his youtube channel. Scary games are the best to watch."

I love Ray and his streams are great, Sometimes he plays games that I dont really care for but thats expected because its his stream, BUT, He's enjoying himself and that helps me enjoy it. Im not a fan of destiny and I dont watch the AH videos on it because theyll be talking mainly about the game being played. Ray, He'll talk to the chat or maybe tell a little story and stuff.  TLDR, Ray works well in the streaming enviroment and there are AH vids I would/wouldnt watch regardless of him being there."

Like if Tina and Ray played a co op game together, each streaming their own perspective, but having banter between them would be great. Obviously not only suggesting Tina, but I figured she would be the easiest to collab with. I just find it more enjoyable when there is multiple people, and I think Ray's quick responses to others are the best."
brownman,3apeeo,Shodspartan100,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:53:56 2015 UTC,"Personally I think that Ray offered a lot to AH but it will continue to prosper without him as it did before him. Some of the newer shows thought that have been coming out have not been the greatest. However, the older stuff is just getting better. I appreciate the effort to bring something new to the table but there is just way too much low quality new content coming out instead of one new high quality series of you get what I'm saying. I don't know how much input Ray had on what kinds of shows AH puts out, but I regardless of if he had a little or a lot, I think this trend will continue for a while. The positive is that like I said before, the good old stuff is still great to watch.  As for Ray's independent content, I don't watch it. I usually am not interested in the things he streams which really can't be changed but I know a lot of people like it which is all that matters. There's so many youtubers and streamers providing content that I want to watch already that I'm fine with Ray not having the content that I enjoy watching. Those who enjoy it will watch it, those who don't will move on. Ray is a great character and I love the guy. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors."
brownman,3apeeo,Adam143,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:00:16 2015 UTC,"I'm the same, I hadn't been enjoying a lot of the content for while, then Ray left and I completely lost interest, the only videos I enjoyed since he left were the Mini Golf ones that still had him in. I'm not personally a fan of Funhaus either, so RT is pretty much completely off the radar for me for now. Any time that I would have spent with RT content is now diverted to Ray's streams."

brownman,3apeeo,Five5x,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"There is a rose shaped hole in AH land these days. I find AH is hit and miss depending on what they are playing and who is filling in. I miss Ray in some things, but not in GTA or Minecraft. I have noticed a huge dip in views and I am sure AH has noticed.   To be honest, I started noticing things weren't always peachy way before Ray left. If anything, the fact that Ray left was icing on the cake. There are some things that have bothered me for awhile now. It's a lot of little things that have built up over time, but there's no point in listing them because I am happy to watch AH content when I enjoy it.   Jack, oddly enough seems to be stepping up since Ray left and it's nice to hear him be funnier.   I am very happy that Ray is following his own path and had the guts to make such a huge leap into the unknown. The funny thing about it is, Ray is so different on twitch since there isn't 5 others guys to riff off of. The part that I enjoyed about Ray isn't there as much. Those 5 other guys brought out a lot in Ray's personality and now that it's just him, he doesn't have anyone there to go back and forth with. Nor, does he make those funny comments that would catch someone off guard and make them burst out laughing."
brownman,3apeeo,y2kcage,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:42:32 2015 UTC,"Reading the majority of this thread has been very interesting and cool from someone that doesn't post much lol.  But personally, since Ray left AH I've been watching AH content more than Ray's streams.  Nothing against Ray's streams but I guess I'm used AH content I guess.  It also could be that Ray's videos on his YouTube can be up to 6 to 7 hours, which is quite amazing to be honest.  I mostly say this because I can barely play a game longer than 1 to 2 hours nowadays unless it has my full interest.  I know that the majority of his streams usually have a variety of games which makes them that long but still I find that impressive.  Plus, I like that he DOES post his streams on YouTube so people can watch them if they happened to miss them.  I like having the option to watch his old streams especially on YouTube because the playback on Twitch, from my experience at least, is not always the best.    So overall, I'm happy to see that Ray is happy doing what he wants while being on good terms with RT & AH.  I mean, if he didn't why would he still do X-Ray & Vav and visit the AH office recently, as in a few weeks ago I think.  Also, I feel like AH content is slightly better now that he left, mostly Minecraft & GTA V because it's better to have the whole group enjoying a game than the group minus one.  That being said, I cannot really say that I watch AH content but I listen to it more like a podcast for a while now.  I just like hearing the banter between the guys. I'm a little sad that Ray's not there to chime in but hey if he's happy then I'm happy.    On a side note: Shout out to the love for Funhaus.  I've been loving those guys since they've joined RT."

brownman,3an4w2,MrScottehh,2,Tue Jun 23 02:49:10 2015 UTC,"Need that 4% desperately, it will go faster than the speed of light."
brownman,3an4w2,Ufacked599,3,Tue Jun 23 20:49:29 2015 UTC,I looked at it twice before getting it.
brownman,3ambgy,brunotbg,12,Sun Jun 21 17:02:59 2015 UTC,What happened to cause this reaction?
brownman,3ambgy,Capeman344,7,Sun Jun 21 18:54:27 2015 UTC,"Horse + water = instant death.  Edit: I have been informed that I was actually wrong, whoops..."
brownman,3ambgy,Salem216,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:13:39 2015 UTC,This was actually when the npc killed the bear Ray was trying to kill. As soon as the stream was over I went back and played this moment several times because it was just too funny.
brownman,3ambgy,shutupdangit,5,Mon Jun 22 20:14:49 2015 UTC,Time stamp?

brownman,3ambgy,shutupdangit,3,Sun Jun 21 21:42:01 2015 UTC,"My favorite moment was when he got killed without saving and he just put down his head phones, walked off camera, and yelled ""fuck""."
brownman,3ao4ly,Leganost,14,Mon Jun 22 02:53:12 2015 UTC,I use this. It works great!
brownman,3ao4ly,RNarvaezJr,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:48:36 2015 UTC,"I believe it has to be the ultra version, as ray linked. There is a version which I believe is only usb 2.0 and cheaper, however it doesn't work with the one."

brownman,3ao4ly,DanTheManSandwich,0,Thu Jun 25 04:59:30 2015 UTC,Pretty sure this is it: Hard drive
brownman,3ao4ly,BlankJebus,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:05:29 2015 UTC,"Don't think that's the one he uses, but it is the one that i use. I have the 5TB one. I don't think I'll have to worry about space for a long time."
brownman,3alvjd,MrShadowkraven,9,Sun Jun 21 14:30:10 2015 UTC,"he didn't speedrun the game, he was at one if the GDQ's and he was sitting behind the couch"

brownman,3a9mdb,tinadayton,3,Thu Jun 18 09:14:33 2015 UTC,These can ship to the UK right?
brownman,3a9mdb,ThatBritish,3,Thu Jun 18 19:54:25 2015 UTC,"On stream Ray said that they can ship anywhere, just with a shipping cost and I'm unsure as to how well the exchange rate works out"
brownman,3a9mdb,BurningRazer,3,Fri Jun 19 05:54:00 2015 UTC,"Damnit, sorry Ray. I'd buy it, but it's been 100 degrees every day for the past week in sunny ole' SoCal."
brownman,3a9mdb,SoftwareJunkie,3,Thu Jun 18 23:24:32 2015 UTC,Will there be a zip up one after? Not a fan of Pullover.  Still awaiting my shirt to arrive too!
brownman,3a9mdb,nixerkg,2,Fri Jun 19 05:42:58 2015 UTC,"I was tempted by the shirt, but I decided not to get it  I dont think i can hold off from this one, even though by the time I can wear it in the winter it will probably be too small"
brownman,3a9mdb,PandaStyle00,2,Thu Jun 18 17:34:09 2015 UTC,Winter is Coming! Get a Brownman hoodie to survive the long night.
brownman,3a9mdb,ThatBritish,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:59:50 2015 UTC,Fuck I should have waited to buy this one
brownman,3a9mdb,El_Catrin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:37:19 2015 UTC,"Next week is zipper hoodie, right?"
