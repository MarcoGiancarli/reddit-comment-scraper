videos,3c8cc6,josanator,"I recently re-read them and it was so worth it. I was so confused the first time I read The End (I just wanted to find out what was in the sugar bowl) but now I think it's a perfect ending to the series.\n\nThe 13th book is the ""but..."" at the end of the story. After you've spent a dozen books reading how awful and cruel and unfair the world is, and how even the best of us can be brought down to the level of villains, it poses the question: ""Why not just run away from it all?""\n\nIt's a somewhat heavy-handed allusion to the Garden of Eden. The island leader, Ishmael, shields the islanders from anything even remotely evil by keeping them opiated and ignorant, following strict rules. Meanwhile, he keeps secret the gigantic tree full of knowledge in the arboretum, along with the apples containing the antidote to a deadly fungus that has a habit of showing up everywhere. While Ishmael keeps the colony safe from the outside world, he also may have doomed them all to their deaths by keeping this information from them.\n\nThe children are given a choice between living a sheltered, ignorant life on the island, or facing up to the dangers of the real world that has treated them so badly. They choose the real world.\n\nThe End is Lemony Snicket's way of saying that no matter how unfortunate the world is, and even if you yourself have made some terrible mistakes, it is still better to face all that and do your best to fight wickedness than to run away, bury your head in the sand and pretend everything is fine.\n\nTL;DR: Real evil world > sheltered ignorance"

videos,3c8cc6,Colalbsmi,I hope not. I hope for each book to be broken into multiple episodes. At least 5 seasons worth of material. Each book can give a solid amount of episodes
videos,3c8cc6,WeaponXGaming,Yea I'm hoping for something like this too. One to two hours for each book will not be enough.
videos,3c8cc6,captainali,they could go Pretty Little Liars on it and just use the characters and world and when they reach the end of the books just start making stuff up. There was a time i would be upset about that but it passed.
videos,3c8cc6,jel1995,It helps that each books slides directly into the next one.
videos,3c8cc6,Jaredlong,"I'm thinking it will be 2 seasons of 13 episodes, with each season covering one half of the series.\n\nSeason 1 will be books 1 through 7. Each book will have 2 episodes, or ~two hours of content, except for the first book, which is the shortest and only has enough story for one episode. The season finale will be the Baudelaires going on the run after being accused of murder.\n\nSeason 2 will be books 8 through 13. Each book will get 2 episodes, except for The End, which will probably need a third episode to cover the ending and epilogue. There will probably be some books spilling into other books (like Game of Thrones covering multiple books at once), because from the Hostile Hospital onwards each book leads naturally into the next.\n\nAlternative POVs would be nice, as well. It would fix all of the book's plot holes. It would also be nice to see content from the Beatrice Letters slowly making its way into the series. Like Baby Beatrice stalking Lemony Snicket, and we have no idea who's following him until the very end."
videos,3c8cc6,Malachim,"See, although this is a good idea, I can see Netflix putting way more time into the books than just two seasons. If the show is good, they know it will pull in audiences, and if it pulls in an audience, they're going to want it to stick around for a while like OitNB or HoC. They might even add material to make the kids stay in certain locations longer than they did in the books. \n\nJust speculation though! Hope it's  better than the movies."

videos,3c8cc6,Mentioned_Videos,"Never read the books, can anyone give a feel for what this series might be like?"
videos,3c8cc6,kirkboy,I would compare the writing style to Hitchhiker's Guide. Lots of meta and clever humor. The first five books are pretty straight forward without a lot going on in the plot department. At the end of the fifth book an overarching plot is introduced and the series really picks up from there.\n\nReally fantastic books. One of my favorite children/YA series.
videos,3c8cc6,The_Arakihcat,"Worth reading. Difficult to go too far into it without spoiling much but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events (just the introduction will do) is a good summary.

videos,3c7k5x,Umaro2k,This doesn't appear to be a casual gamer kind of game.  I don't think people just chuck in a quarter or two
videos,3c7k5x,bruneo,"Gambling in Japan is quite strange. You are allowed to gamble on some things, and not allowed to gamble on others. For example you can bet on horse races, bike races and speedboat races, but you can't gamble at cards or slots.\n\nBUT slots and pachinko (a game like pinball but with no flippers, where you buy balls, and win balls instead of points) are super popular! You can't win money, but you can win prizes, and it just so happens that the prizes can be exchanged in certain locations for large amounts of money (or so I've been told). It's a loop-hole to win money from gambling on games you aren't allowed to gamble on."

videos,3c7k5x,Tsukuruya,"As I get older and learn more about Japan, so many things from the Japanese games I played as a kid suddenly make sense."
videos,3c7k5x,NameTak3r,"You don't have to exchange the prize at all. \n\nPlayed pachinko with my ex's cousin in Gunma. I won about 100 balls and we checked out the prizes. Since I was going to get on a plane the next day I said I didn't want any prizes. He then took me outside, we turned left and entered a small building next to the pachinko place. We exchanged the card with my ball total for cash there. I couldn't see the cashier's face, only her hands. \n\nFucking awesome experience but I would never go without a Japanese person with me. Plus it's super noisy."
videos,3c7k5x,Wecanbefriendsnow,"I saw a documentary about this awhile back. I want to say it was on Vice, but I could be wrong. They explained how it worked, and showed how you would take the prizes around the corner from the arcade and exchange it for the money. It was kinda crazy. If the local casinos in my area had arcades like this, I would probably go more often. The vanilla casino games they have just get kind of boring."

videos,3c7k5x,jhulbe,"Lived in Japan for 2 years. As I understand it, you only win credits / prizes but can sell those credits for cash at a place next door. Loophole in the Japanese gambling laws.

videos,3c7k5x,TonyBooya,"To explain the loophole in layman's terms.\n\nIt's illegal to gamble for money.\n\nIt's not illegal to gamble for game tokens.\n\nIt's not illegal to exchange tokens for prizes.\n\nIt's not illegal to sell a prize for cash.\n\nTo prevent obvious abuse of this loophole, you are not allowed to sell for cash prizes in the same place you get them for tokens. So you got to go outside and around the corner to a little window in the wall. That makes it all ok."
videos,3c7k5x,BrookieDragon,That's true for Pachinko and Slots but this is just a normal game you'd find in a game center. Those medals are worthless and it's just a way to enjoy and pass the time.

videos,3c7k5x,dubious_ontology,"Exactly. And the whole thing is run by the Yakuza, which is why the loophole remains open.\n\n\nNot anymore. Japan is about to legalize gambling. And just recently (last month), they passed amendments loosening the restrictions on gacha games."

I have spent a ton of time in Japanese arcades, this machine is a medallion game. The medallions can only be used to play similar gambling stlye games and cannot be traded in for cash or prizes. It is solely for amusement. If you win a ton of these medals, you can store them in an ATM like bank in the arcade. Return later with you ATM info and you can withdraw your medals and keep playing. You can't even use the medals on normal arcade games like street fighter, DDR, or claw machines. Again, this isn't gambling just pure amusement.\n\nThe machines are fun to play and are usually insanely elaborate with effects and complexity. Check them out if you are ever in Japan, they are quite entertaining. This game Infinity rings, is pretty crazy."
videos,3c7k5x,kabob23,"It's true. I won a bunch of these useless medallions in a blackjack machine at a Sega arcade. It was a pretty neat machine, nicer than any of the ones I've seen in Vegas, but other than that ""winning feeling"" I didn't really get anything from it."

videos,3c7k5x,yourderpisshowing,The game in the video is Fortune Trinity 2 and it's really similar to Grand Cross (both are made by Konami).
videos,3c7k5x,bonytony21,"Depends on the place. There are non-pachinko arcades that will let you sell back the medals, usually at a small amount of what you buy them for. So yeah - it is possible they could've changed it back to cash, but I don't know the place where this happened."

Candy fell down, that's your candy, and it'd hit a flap. Flap makes a thing go up, makes a claw thing scoop candy onto your pusher, bam more candy. Get the thing high enough, you win a whole bag of a candy, like a fat bag. Working at the arcade meant I'd get to take home shit tons of tokens, so now and then I'd take them in and play that game for a while, win a few pounds of candy and be happy with myself :)"

I drive a pickup when 90% of the time a sedan would do just fine, but twice a week I tow a trailer 50 miles or so. My truck gets around 22mpg driving around town where a sedan would get about 27. It's not cost effective for me to have two vehicles for a 5 mpg difference, yet people assume I'm an asshole driving around in a truck knowing nothing about me. \n\nIf someone is successful enough to drive Porche suv, why is it any of your business? Honestly, they're really not any worse for the environment than most high end sedans."

videos,3c7a1z,TacticalVirus,"Before about ten/fifteen years ago nobody bought SUVs, they're a luxury item, almost never really necessary. I wouldn't have a problem with SUVs if they didn't affect me or others on the road. Unfortunately they do. \n\nThe higher ride height and truck like construction combined with the substantial increase in weight means that SUVs are much more likely to kill other road users on a crash. (http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130514135417.htm)\nSUVs are also much more vulnerable to rollover when manoeuvring at high speeds than other vehicles. The more SUVs on the road the less safe everybody else is.\n\nWhen you're pulling a trailer you could use a conventional saloon. For example the Peugeot 508 has a Braked towing weight (max) of 1,875kg and a fuel economy rated at 67.3mpg. The Porsche Cayenne can tow 3500 Kg braked but barely gets 24mpg.\n\nThe Porsche Cayenne is categorised by Porsche as an SUV.

videos,3c7jab,AmericanSpringPlease,All of Rammstein's English versions of their songs are different then the German versions. Same goes for Oomph! and any number of other German bands with English versions of songs. There's just no good way to translate a song perfectly from language to language.
videos,3c7jab,4irforce,"As a native german speaker i am aware of this and it is a play on words in german. \n\n""You hate me""would translate to "" Du hasst mich"" with two ""s"". It is the verb to the noun "" Hass"" -> ""hate"" and used in the right tense and for the 2nd person singular. Pretty much every verb in german has a different form for all the different pronous, which would be ""ich; du; er, sie, es; wir; ihr; sie""\n\nThe way you wrote it with one "" s"" translates as i stated to ""you have"". \n\n"" du hasst mich"" and ""du hast mich"" sound almost identical in german. \n\nHope i could clear something up (probably just made it more complicated) :)"
videos,3c7jab,mrjackspade,"The lyrics were completely rewritten for the american version, IIRC"
videos,3c7jab,AdequateSteve,"Not to contribute to the grammar lesson here, but...\n\nAs other people have said, ""hasst"" and ""hast"" have the same pronunciation but different meanings. ""Hasst"" is the ""you"" form of the word hate (since each pronoun has a different verb form).\n\nIn german, the song is:\n\nYou\n\nYou have\n\nYou have ____ (me)\n\nYou have asked me\n\nYou have asked me and I said nothing\n\nThe reason that the third line has a blank, is because the verb ""ask"" comes at the end of the sentence - you just know that someone ""has"" done something until the next line where he inserts the other half of the verb.\n\nIn the conversational past tense, all verbs are in the form of ""have (verb)"" or ""is (verb)"" So instead of ""I asked you"" it would be ""I have asked you"" - or if you put it in order: ""I have you asked""\n\nThe reason the word order is weird (I have you asked VS I have asked you) is that german has a rule where the second word in a sentence MUST be the verb. Because ""have asked"" is technically two verbs, the second part of it gets kicked to the end of the sentence.\n\nThe english version was changed, because it simply wouldn't have the same ring in english to say:\n\nYou\n\nYou have\n\nYou have asked\n\nYou have asked me\n\nSo they changed it to ""hate"" because it's a bit of a pun in german and it sounds better in english anyway."

videos,3c7mhd,FermiAnyon,"A domino uses earth's gravity to fall over, once pushed. I have no idea how a fission bomb works, and how close/far away from ""using gravity"" the involved processes are."
videos,3c7mhd,Pestilence86,Very far.
videos,3c7mhd,enforcemENT,"That's a chain reaction on a much smaller scale, and with much greater energy potentials, since you're breaking matter apart until it releases the energy that held it together (the strong force). In the case of falling domino's we're talking about gravity, and that's also called ""the weak force"" (or the weak interaction)."
videos,3c7mhd,goal2004,The weak force isn't gravity. That's separate.
videos,3c7mhd,Exist50,Whoops! My bad!
videos,3c7mhd,goal2004,da faq are you talking about?
videos,3c7mhd,regnub4,The first push is only used to release the potential energy of the first domino brick. This energy gets released as kinetic energy. Part of this energy is then used to release the potential energy of the next brick. Hence the chain reaction.

videos,3c9som,WWHSTD,What I don't get about this season is how come a good chunk of the hazards in the arena are not even active at all (e.g buzzsaws)?
videos,3c9som,nsm1,"If you pay close attention in episode two it looks like there's controllers for the hazards on the sides of the arena waiting for a bot to wander into their kill zone. Either the human element or the control inputs are too slow, you can see the hammer's coming down or the saw blades come up out of the floor multiple times but also just a second or two too late to do any damage."
videos,3c9som,wrc-wolf,"From Tested's interview with the arena designer, the hazards are controlled automatically and comes up at random time. \nhttps://youtu.be/j-Oi9lSxw50?t=15m42s\n\nMy guess is that the show is still trying to figure out how often arena weapons will pop up. If it comes up too often, you run into issues of both bots fighting the arena rather than each other, and it becomes a game of luck of how badly you're affected by the hazards. In my opinion, you would want the hazards to make an impact on strategy, but not decide the results. \n\nThe Pulverizer  (hammer) is different though. They're controlled by the teams. However, I'm not sure if there are 2 hammers and each team controls 1 or they can both activate a single hammer."
videos,3c9som,goRockets,What I find disappointing is that the Pulverizers are hollowed-out hammers. There is no 'oomph behind ANY of the hazards.
videos,3c9som,CptToastymuffs,I could probably mess up the spinners

videos,3c9som,erishun,"That would be bad ass, but I wouldn't want to spend all that time and money building a robot only to have it literally shredded.\n\nSure it can get beat up and disabled in a battle but at least the main components will still be salvageable."
videos,3c9som,Thesaurii,"The hammer mostly damages spinners, because half the time they lose its because they hit the other guy too much and broke. A hammer coming down can wear out a motor, or slow them down so the other guy can get in there.\n\nThe screws do more than it seems, but are mostly going to be used offensively by bots designed to smush their opponent into them. A glancing hit won't do much. They can also be used sometimes by bots that have a hard time righting themselves, which I like a lot.\n\nThe blades are almost never active because if they were, a lot of matches would be decided by them randomly coming up at the wrong time. I would prefer them to come up more often, but rotate slower and not come up as high so they would not do much damage, but instead just shove around bots and add something new every once in a while.\n\nI think it would be interesting to have a more hazard focused arena moving forward, in the hopes of a bot that focuses on using the arena offensively standing a chance, instead of the flippers and spinners winning all the time."
videos,3c9som,Niner_,The screws don't damage any of the bots. But what they are doing is providing a large platform for wedge bots to flip other bots onto. Pretty much every time you see a bot that's stuck on the wall it's because those stupid screws have such a large platform.
videos,3c9som,Thesaurii,"That is what I meant, they are an offensive weapon for flipping used primarily by bots designed around using them. I hadn't thought about the platform behind them."
videos,3c9som,WigglestonTheFourth,I'd like to see Bronco have a good fight. Both fights so far have been super quick KOs. Not sure if that means Bronco is tough or too fat to handle thus far.
videos,3c9som,codenamegamma,"it was funny because in the full episode the lady who's driving plan x during the pre-interview was like ""my robot is so big i don't think its going to be able to easily flip it over"" and like 10 seconds in it was on its back out for the count."
videos,3c9som,CountLaFlare,"Not even 10 seconds, ay. Like 5 max. Was so quick."
videos,3c9som,The_Drunk_Kraken,That's what she said
videos,3c9som,SkinnyHusky,Producers were all excited about the contestant's story. Seeing her bot get KO'd in the first seconds must have pissed them off.
videos,3c9som,SirCheezburger,"They need the ""strong independent womyn"" story."
videos,3c9som,Joszanarky,Being a strong independent womyn and designing a good bot are not one and the same.
videos,3c9som,SirCheezburger,Both of his opponents were crap-tier bots.
videos,3c9som,clovens,Thank you for removing the filler.
videos,3c9som,ArisLikeTheGreekGod,"Why was there so much hype for Warhead? both his fights he did poorly, barely making it through on the wildcard.  Famous builder or something?"
videos,3c9som,Enzedderr,Warhead was a crowd favourite in season 5 of BattleBots but was knocked out in the Quarter Finals.\n\nTheir team are the ones that made Razer for Robot Wars who was one of the most famous and most decorated robots entering into the Hall of Fame.
videos,3c9som,Grantus89,"Why don't they use Razer, seems like a much better robot."
videos,3c9som,Iambillslefthand,Yup. Hes been around for quite a long time.
videos,3c9som,Chubbstock,"Yeah I don't get it either. He's a kinetic bot, using a spinning weapon, but it's the worst one I've seen. It hasn't done any major damage in any of his fights. The arms seem like they're for show, because they can't flip it back over. The tail too. If it went up against tombstone it would be absolutely destroyed."

videos,3c9som,Stimpacks,Bronco is op as fuck
videos,3c9som,Warbird36,Team Inertia Lab is a well-decorated robot fighting team. They designed the storied T-Minus/Matador/Toro series of flippers for Battlebots's original run. They're an experienced team and absolutely know what they're doing.
videos,3c9som,Novassar,"Flamethrower. Ffs, they are robots, 99% metal, why ?"
videos,3c9som,TheRealMrMaloonigan,"There's still the potential to melt wiring, overheat motors, weaken thinner metal etc. Plus, flamethrowers are always cool."
videos,3c9som,MrTheodore,"you would have to have it on a bot for like 20 seconds and in the same spot\n\nwhich is why they never work, they just move"
videos,3c9som,TheRealMrMaloonigan,"Hey, I never said it was a practical weapon. :-p"
videos,3c9som,Hybyscus,"If teams used pincers, they could hold the bot in place and then roast them."
videos,3c9som,Warbird36,This was Complete Control's M.O.
videos,3c9som,teasnorter,"You know what? Those mini flamethrowers should use a kamikaze tactic. Have magnets to attach themselves to enemy bots, then blow their torch."
videos,3c9som,pan_ter,It looks cool

videos,3c9som,youRFate,"I thought there was a neato robot in the box, so the other guy had to destroy one of the bots he built :>."
videos,3c9som,Tyger_,how come the spinning bot is the only one in there?man he is super powerful compared to the rest..
videos,3c9som,5748,"I think there are two other spinner, but one of them seems bad(it broke it's own blade). The other, called tombstone, seems stupidly powerful and will probably face either icewave or bronco in the final match."
videos,3c9som,garfunkle21,"Yeah, tombstone wipes the floor with this one"
videos,3c9som,alittlebigger,Why doesn't tombstone just put one of those spinners on each side? It could literally just park in the middle of the arena and wait to win
videos,3c9som,Assorted_Bits,Balancing I think. If the spinners are not synchronised it might tear itself apart.
videos,3c9som,FlameoftheWest,http://robotwars.wikia.com/wiki/13_Black
videos,3c9som,alittlebigger,That one seems like a shittier design with the blades angled and all but now lets take it next level and make the base spin as well. You couldnt lose
videos,3c9som,SkaveRat,weight limit is a real problem. Probably a reason why a lot of bots only have one spinner
videos,3c9som,Warbird36,True--basic physics come into play. Hard for your weapon to have much oomph if your bot if launching itself across the arena after each hit.
videos,3c9som,grahamsimmons,These bots fight by weight class. More weapons = more weight!
videos,3c9som,alittlebigger,"Throw me in the super heavyweight then. I make a box bot that can spin, then I had a spinner to each side, then I make two vertical spinners on top of it in case some wise ass tries to ramp me. Maybe I add a flamethrower for looks I don't know yet. So basically what I have is a spinning bot with 4 horizontal blades (double spin if you're following me) and two vertical blades on top. I drive my bot to the middle of the arena I turn all my shit on, then I sit back and enjoy a sandwich while watching the show..... And possibly a flamethrower"
videos,3c9som,grahamsimmons,Could be defeated by a small wedge with extremely thick armour.
videos,3c9som,alittlebigger,"You're not hearing me bro, 6 fucking blades with a spinning base, and a flamethrower... God himself couldn't beat that"
videos,3c9som,grahamsimmons,50kg of blades could be defeated by 75kg of steel armour.
videos,3c9som,IA_Kcin,I love how the guy was going on about how his bot was the most well engineered bot in the history of fighting bots and then it broke its own blade on the first real impact. LOL.
videos,3c9som,TheSillyLion,"It looks like it's hard to build a good spinner. The others I've seen either get the spinners broke, or they don't have sufficenf power."
videos,3c9som,Thesaurii,"No, they just actively chose less spinners to let into the competition. Horizontal spinners are the best choice for a lot of reasons, if this was a huge open tournament with real money at the top, you would only see spinners with the occasional flipper.\n\nThe producers selected bots mostly on the basis of them having a story, either through a novel design, a history on the old show, or an interesting team."

videos,3c9som,MrTheodore,"some guy had one on his flipper with blue flames and looked pretty powerful, it lost, rip complete control\n\nthey don't burn hot enough and don't cover the other bot in flammable material, so there's no lasting damage.  would take like 20-30 seconds of flame on a bot to maybe start to melt internal components, but nobody ever stays still that long or has enough fuel to do that."

What do they do if the opponent works both sides up?  The spinners are just so much stronger than the rest.\n\nAlso make the hazards more...hazardous.  Those wall corkscrews are a joke.  The saws in the floor are hardly ever up."
videos,3c9som,CrowsEyeFM,"Continuously flipping an opponent keeps the pressure on and can make it more difficult for them to drive (I imagine most bots aren't set up so the driver's controls flip with them).

videos,3c9som,5748,"Honestly, it just seems like other pilots don't know how to handle the spinner. In almost every single match with a spinner there is at least one opportunity, sometimes multiple chances, to get into the fight while their blade is stopped. It takes time to wind up again and every matchup I see, the other team just hangs back and lets them spin up their blade again. Once that thing is stopped the other team should be in full aggression mode. Get in there, get in the way of the blade and keep it from spinning up again."
videos,3c9som,xConflict,"I think icewave could have been knocked out in the first match. Every time it hit razorback, it's blade slowed considerably. If razorback had kept pushing towards it, the blade would have never built up enough speed to do any real damage."

videos,3c7bt1,blumcup,He is still known for doing stunts that 99% of people don't have the balls to try.
videos,3c7bt1,Andy-J,Not at his age. Plenty of similar stunts from people much younger. They don't get the same views because they are boring. Would anyone pay any attention to this video if steveo wasn't in it?
videos,3c7bt1,blumcup,"Perhaps not, but it's fine. It is what it is. Watching videos of people you know and like is often awesome, even if the shit they are doing isn't crazy. If it were Tom Hanks on a skateboard with fireworks people would lose their shit because it would just be amazing seeing Tom Hanks do that. Steve-O is still pretty appealing to a lot of people, so they watch and they are entertained. Pretty simple in the end."

videos,3c7bt1,StoopidNoodle,Steve-O got fireworks specifically made for these stunts. While it's definitely still dangerous he was atleast much more controlled.
videos,3c7bt1,iWesTCoastiN,"""Thanks to Phantom Fireworks in Duluth, GA for giving me all this shit for free!""\n\nSomething tells me Steve-O didn't get them on special order. He just has a little experience with doing dumb stuff."
videos,3c7bt1,alter-eagle,"To be fair ""Thanks to Phantom Fireworks in Duluth, GA for specifically making these fireworks so i won't get hurt!""\n\nDoesn't sound nearly as good. Maybe I shouldn't have said they were specifically made, more like Steve-O told them what he planned to do and they picked out what fireworks would not get him killed."
videos,3c7bt1,iWesTCoastiN,"True that. I'd bet my buttons that Phantom gave Steve-O's crew a metric fuck-ton of fireworks just for stopping by in exchange for a shout-out. Then later at some point they had to decide which ones were ""safe enough"" to do some stunts with."
videos,3c7bt1,alter-eagle,I've bought those mortars before. They aren't anything special.

videos,3c7bt1,9gcc,This is so crazy. I knew this guy. He came to the dog park with his awesome little bulldog all the time and I talked with him many times. He was a super nice guy and watching him work with dogs was incredible. He gave me a lot of really great training advice. It's hard to imagine that this is how he died because he was such an incredibly calm personality all the time when I saw him.

Obviously I believe the church is a cult and abuse happens but the stories are so extreme that I just have to question them. The top level guys will lie with a straight face either way, once they have said 'The truth is there is no abuse' and then turned round and said 'Actually no that was a lie, there is abuse' it's hard to take them seriously....but that of course plays right in to $cientology's hands.\n\nThe most interesting aspects to me were the parts about John Travolta and Tom Cruise. John not leaving the cult after his friend left with her baby...basically confirming he is gay and blackmailed/brainwashed. And Tom Cruise...well always thought he was gay too but the doc seemed to shy away from any discussion of those rumours but shifted it to a more 'he doesnt leave because a) the church adds value to his life and b) he is actually crazy'. \n\nAll very troubling, I feel sorry for the families torn apart by the cult."

When you watch The Trailer Park Boys, you can just feel the imagination and insight.  People talk about ""world building"". Well, they built a world in which it made sense that a shirtless cheeseburger addict dressed in hockey equipment, cardboard, and duct tape,  would attempt to jump a giant cheeseburger on his bicycle.

videos,3c9ikx,tedford,Because of how zoomed in it is it actually gives us a better view of how big those splashes are relatively to him. The narrower the field of view the less amount of parallax you'll perceive over distance.
videos,3c9ikx,Miniminotaur,I'm really surprised at all the turbulence.  I can understand eruptions and flat calderas like Kilueha. What is causing all the activity?  Wonder if it's gases welling up from deep below.
videos,3c9ikx,mesosorry,Is it just me or was his hair melted at the end there?
videos,3c9ikx,karottenfelt,How close is he? Can't see any splatter above or next to him. The suit seems a little redundant if he fell in..
videos,3c9ikx,poop_giggle,The telephoto lens is compressing the space in the image to make him look much closer than he is. He's probably quite far away (otherwise I doubt he'd even be able to stand there)
videos,3c9ikx,Musclesjones,He said 30 meters?

videos,3c9ikx,mynameisalso,So why exactly isn't he wearing any protection on his arms? Just one drop would leave a third degree burn and likely burn through his arm a bit...

videos,3c75k5,bananatec,"came here to acknowledge the editing with music. it's done exceptionally well and with lots of thought put into it. if you didn't notice it, watch it again, because it's pretty rare for these types of vid. almost every jump, grab, slide, or land is synced up; several per shot.\neg. syncing the jumps and landings of 2 borders with the stochastic vocal at 0:53\n- the grab/spin & land at 1:16\n- rock/paper/scissors at 2:15\n- swedish border at 4:00.\ncan you tell I'm impressed?"

videos,3c75k5,nonumers,"very few of the jumps were very impressive and the competition only seemed to have 5 events. if the guy was contracted out to film the competition, there's not much content to build a video.

Unless the cop coerced you directly into doing an illegal activity that you would not otherwise do, it's not entrapment.  This story satisfies none of that.  The cop didn't coerce, wasn't convincing the guy to do something illegal, and it wasn't something the kid wouldn't otherwise do.\n\nThis information doesn't feel empowering, so it's often unpopular.  But it's important to know.  Cops can say anything to you, and unless they are doing what I say above, they aren't doing anything illegal.  Unless they actually threaten you with physical violence unless you buy drugs that you've never used before, it's not entrapment."
videos,3c7wm8,POTUS,"when they do sting operations with a car with the door open and keys in the ignition to arrest random opportunist kids, i fail to see how that isn't entrapment. they're not really getting experienced car thieves that way.\n\nso yes, entrapment does happen."
videos,3c7wm8,kabka123,"I guess you didn't read what I wrote.  That's not coersion.  Fuck, it isn't even convincing the people to steal the car.  Providing the opportunity to do something illegal is nothing at all like entrapment."
videos,3c7wm8,POTUS,"You're defending opportunist thieves.  Did the cops come and threaten or blackmail you or something into stealing that car? No? Then it's not entrapment.\n\nIf you get caught stealing a car because of an opportunity, you deserve every bit of shit they throw at you, because you'd be a fucking car thief. If you can't act like a responsible adult who can resist the temptation OF STEALING A CAR, then you don't belong here."
videos,3c7wm8,BrQQQ,we're wasting government resources by looking for such dumb criminals. those aren't realistic situations. we need to bust carjackers.

He took the tobacco out to put some crack rocks in it and roll it back up. If I can find the source of the full video I'll link it but I've seen this episode multiple times.\n\nEdit: I'm not advocating the gun to the head, I think that may have been a little excessive. But in all fairness he's in a really shitty part of Patterson County where high crime is mixed with lots of crackheads and violence. The kid was obviously doing something stupid and wasn't a danger to anyone but himself but if the officer approaches him with that same mentality and he's got a gun, that officer isn't going home to see his family because he put trust in a human being he doesn't know at all. \n\nDown vote me to Valhalla, I give no fucks."

Not serve them with 5-10 years behind bars. It's helping nobody but the guys making $$ per inmate. \n\nThe war on drugs is a failure because we don't actually want to win.

videos,3c7wm8,DID_IT_FOR_YOU,"It's sad because they are really causing more issues like homelessness from locking drug users up instead of trying to help. When you get out, you may still have legal fees you have to pay (no job to help pay for fees because you are now a convict), no home (if you were renting an apartment/house, you no longer have a place to live), most apartments/houses that you can rent will not let you rent if you have a criminal history of drug arrests/convictions. Also, many of these people have nobody to return to that can help them get on their feet. So the only place they can make a good amount of money is more criminal activity i.e.: stealing/selling drugs, and then the cycle repeats. It's horrible what we do to non-violent criminals. Just because somebody made a mistake doesn't mean that they don't have any potential to become a functioning member of society again. The problem is we don't really give them an opportunity to do so. Unfortunately, most people have no perspective of the true horror of our justice system until it is staring them right in the face and they are in the middle of it."

It's just too inefficient and generates too many loopholes for special interest to negate democracy.\n\nI would say that we need really secure computer networks to upgrade democracy and automate large parts of bureaucracy. This technology needs to be open source so it can be audited by everyone. Then we might be able to scale governance to a hole continent and have it be very democratic.\n\nBut I doubt that this can come from above.

videos,3ca2is,Chewy_Bravo,It makes other countries turn red.
videos,3ca2is,peck3277,"You can get a rough idea from Argentina's default in 2002:\n\n\nAround 1998 to 2002, Argentina's economy went into severe recession. On December 26, 2001, Argentina defaulted on a total of USD 93 billion of its external debt... Foreign investment fled the country, and capital flow toward Argentina ceased almost completely from 2001 to 2003 (though it later recovered). The currency exchange rate (formerly a fixed 1-to-1 parity between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar) was floated, and the peso devalued quickly to nearly 4-to-1, producing a sudden rise in inflation to over 40% and a fall in real GDP of 11% in 2002.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_debt_restructuring\n\nEssentially no one wants to invest in the country because they lost money before, inflation soars and the value of the currency drops, wiping out savings, leading to a dearth in investment and drop in the GDP. After a few years, with luck, the government settles claims against its previous debt, internal savings jump start the economy, and the cheap currency makes the country attractive to foreign investment again."
videos,3ca2is,hoponpot,"Interesting summary but quite sensationalistic in my opinion.\nApparently, the Greeks are fat and lazy and the euro is about to bring down the entire world!\n\nGreek will default eventually, and suffer heavily for it (which is unavoidable). Spain, Ireland, Portugal will stay in the Euro and slowly re-build their economies through austerity measures and policy changes. Spain is already turning around and seems to be a good example of where austerity has worked (although I don't believe it's helping Greece at all). Most EU countries have already limited their exposure to Greek debt, so it's really not all that bad. Also there is absolutely no way a fiscal union would ever happen."

Despite this, they're currently leading the poles for the election next year. I also agree with parts of what this video has said about culture. Ireland did need a cultural change as our politics and businesses were riddled with bribery and corruption.\n\nI know it's hard for Greece but sometimes you need to burn to the ground to rise from the ashes.

videos,3ca2is,TheBestBigAl,"I just finished taking an AP US history course, and studied extensively for the AP test. I'm on mobile so some of the details won't be exact, but I can give a decent overview. \n\nEssentially, yeah the Civil War was the only time the states were in direct conflict. There are a few examples of rebellions that weren't state vs state, however.  \n\nBacon's rebellion was in the mid 18th century 1676 where a Virginian countryman named Bacon banded a group of farmers together and attacked the capital of Virginia. They were pissed off that the Governor wasn't doing enough to keep the natives off their backs. It wasn't very long lived, however. \n\nThere's also Shay's rebellion. Soon after America gained independence there were a shit ton of problems. In an attempt to gain some revenue, the government placed a tax of whisky. This was a problem for farmers. The thing is, the dollar wasn't worth much. It was super inflated. So, farmers decided to use whisky as a currency. So thus, if you tax whisky, your taxing all trade, which wasn't easy to do to begin with, because America's roads were awful. So a group of farmers, led by a dude named Daniel Shay, formed an army. It's important to note that a lot of these guys were revolutionary soldiers who didn't get paid. George Washington talked them down.\n\nJust before the Civil War there was an incident at Harpers Ferry. A semi-crazy hardcore abolitionist named John Brown and his sons took over an ammo dept in Harpers Ferry, Virginia. Think of a guy who's really angry with a Bible in one hand and a shot gun in the other. Now you know who John Brown is. They're plan was to take over the dept and use the fire power to arm a slave rebellion. Unfortunately, no slaves came to help. Federal Troops came in, and killed his sons and captured him. He was put on trail and found guilty of Treason, and executed.\n\nThat's all of them I could really think of ATM. It's important to note that before the Civil War it was ""The United States are..."" Then after it became ""The United States is...,"" The Civil War made America a truly unified country rather than a confederation of States. Despite having the same language, the early states were all quite different from one another. They had different governments, different economies, different cultures, different morals, and even different religions. The North East was made up by primarily puritans who were EXTREMELY intolerant of other religions. If you were Catholic or Jewish prepare for some hate. Pennsylvania and Rhode Island were based off freedom, tolerance, and Quaker beliefs. The South was populated by the Non-eldest sons of English Noblemen, for the large part. Since they weren't the eldest, they would inherit no land, and so they came to America to make their own fortune. All of these groups had to come together to create the United States. Granted, European States are much less similar than the original States were, but getting them to cooperate was not as easy as you might have imagined.             \n\nMost conflicts in the United States were sectionalist-based political battles that started in 1776 and have not ended today. They probably never will, either."
videos,3ca2is,Quotes_League,"Interesting read. I guess those other rebellions are more akin to protests/riots than wars, although I suppose there is only a small step from one to the other.\nOn a more serious note, how do I go about getting paid in whiskey?"
videos,3ca2is,TheBestBigAl,"It was essentially a currency. The dollar was worthless, so countrymen didn't want to use it. This was post revolutionary war, so no one was willing to use the English pound. They were farmers, and grain/barley was readily available. So they made it into Whisky, and used it as a currency. I remember my APUSH teacher telling me it made it easier to transport, although I have no clue how that could be."

The South was populated by the Non-eldest sons of English Noblemen and their indentured servants for the large part (In addition to slaves). Since they weren't the eldest, they would inherit no land, and so they came to America to make their own fortune. All of these groups had to come together to create the United States. Granted, European States are much less similar than the original States were, but getting them to cooperate was not as easy as you might have imagined.\nMost conflicts in the United States are sectionalist-based political battles that started in 1776 and have not ended today. They probably never will, either."

videos,3ca2is,Tszemix,"Sorry, but this was a huge pile of crap, and extremely dishonest for what it omits:\n\nIn a word, CORRUPTION.\n\nIf you want to understand what is happening, you need to understand that the politicians and banksters are often on the same team, and they are gaming the system constantly.  If you look at the countries going bust, it is uniformly the case that there is high levels of corruption, in the form of governments and business and banks colluding.  What do they do?  They take a billion euros to build a road that should have cost 100 million.  They pay themselves extravagantly.  They hire their friends and family to do nothing real.  They steal money, and never account for it.  They run a country into the ground, and into huge debt.\n\nNow, do you think the lenders complain?  HELL NO!  They encourage it, because they get bonuses, they earn interest.  Lending is their business after all, and countries don't usually fail to pay, because of course the corrupt politicians and big businesses who caused the problem in the first place, will always put the pain back on the people.  And even if they try to hesitate, all the other governments put huge pressure on (they are in the same game), and you even get calls for the fucking banksters to dictate the whole show, by having a bankster operated centralized fiscal policy that over-rules the countries.  The rich cover each other's asses, none of them lose their homes or their fortunes.\n\nThe only relief comes when the public finally wake the fuck up, and elect an honest government.  Of course, by then, everything is completely utterly fucked, and who gets all the blame?  The honest people's government of course, because they won't be ""responsible"", they won't play the game, they won't fuck the public by making them pay back for the rich people's corruption.\n\nIf you want to see how to really fix this kind of shit, look at Iceland, who threw the crooks in jail and told the banksters to fuck off and pay the price for deliberately lending money to crooks.  They recovered faster than anyone else, because they stopped the corruption.  The other countries (northern Europe) that manage to keep a lid on their politics, and keep the corruption low, also did very well.\n\nAnd that cultural difference?  It's about how authority and corruption work hand in hand in the countries that are doing so poorly.  What you have is a mafia attitude, the old boys run the show, and it's not all on the books, but that's just how things are done, and nobody dares challenge it.  It's good for the big fish in businesses, it's good for the politicians on the inside, it's good for the establishment, it's good for the banksters, but the public pays a terrible cost in the end, because after the corrupt rich bigshots take everything, they come back to take even more.\n\nPS, the video singles out creating jobs and paying pensions.  And never once mentions pork-barrel contracts, that dwarf those costs by orders of magnitude.  But hell, you wouldn't dare call out the corrupt rich people, no, just pick on the peons, they can't defend themselves, they won't sue you for libel, and who the fuck cares if any of them actually earned their pensions?  Fuck the public, let them be poor and die in a ditch, there's cheaper labor in China anyways."
videos,3ca2is,exploderator,The fuck are you talking about? Are you the goddam Knight of the Common Man? \n\nIn the video the narrator mentions how much of the money being spent went right back to the politicians. You're arguing a moot point.
videos,3ca2is,EliPoo94,"Riiiiiight, which is why they blame it on jobs and pensions.  Wake up, that's not pensions for people who are already rich, that is pensions for poor people they want to cut.  People that earned every meager penny of their pensions.\n\nAnd another thing, the money doesn't just go to politicians, it goes to the whole upper class of businessmen, including the banksters who cry about getting repaid.  IE, all the people the politicians play golf with, and who they go work for when they finally aren't in office."
videos,3ca2is,exploderator,"IE, all most of the people the politicians play golf with"
videos,3ca2is,Silvernostrils,"I'll gladly stand corrected, and take your word for it, because I admit as a lowly commoner I've never played golf, or hung out with that crowd.

videos,3ca2is,exploderator,...because over bloated unsustainable pensions are ok if they are for people who aren't rich?
videos,3ca2is,Cockdieselallthetime,"over bloated unsustainable pensions\n\n\nOK, let me get this straight.  The little guy works his 40 years, slaving away, and paying into the pension funds.  Some corrupt politicians give it to their friends the banksters, to gamble it away.  Or they corruptly spend it at their buddies companies on bloated contracts.  And the little guy never has any real say in all of this, usually never even knows it's happening.  Just expects to get the pension he was promised, which is a fair return for all the money he paid in, that was supposed to be RESPONSIBLY and HONESTLY managed.  But there's nothing left, because it was stolen and squandered, by people who are so rich they don't need a pension (although they'll gladly give themselves one).\n\nOh right, and the promise that today's earners can insure the retired people... that's gone too, along with the economy that was trashed by corruption.\n\nThe only pensions that are bloated are the nice juicy pensions the rich people pay themselves, which applies to a few percent.  The bulk target that austerity is aimed at is little people's pensions, which have mostly been whittled down over the last few decades anyways.  The rest of us just want a fair return, but we often get fucked instead.\n\nEG, the company my dad worked for for 40 years, a few years after he retired, cut a bunch of people's pensions in half.  My dad went from $4k a month down to about $2k a month.  They claimed financial distress to justify doing it, but notice that every one of those cocksuckers took home record bonuses and huge over-inflated wages, while they raped and pillaged the retirees pension funds.  Because rich pricks protect rich pricks, and the government lets them do it.  That $4k a month was well earned, not bloated and unsustainable.\n\nWhat is bloated and unsustainable is the continued plunder by the rich.  1% are taking over 50% of all the income, and own 90% of everything."
videos,3ca2is,exploderator,"OK, let me get this straight. The little guy works his 40 years, slaving away\n\n\nEmotional bullshit argument. Not based on fact since Greek pensions kick in at 55.\n\n401k retirements or other market tied funds are sustainable pensions are not.\n\nThe rest of this comment is just argument to appeal to emotional, just stupid. \n\nAll poor people are good hard working people who deserve unsustainable pensions, all rich people are pricks.\n\nYour understanding of the world is fucking hilariously stupid."

Japan has long hours of work, but their productive value per hour is a fraction of a German hour of work.\n\nWorking smart and efficiently has worked well for countries like Germany, UK, and France.\n\nThe other issue is that Greece has had a poorly managed economy. Taxes must be collected fully, as tax evasion is killing the country. Because taxes aren't collected properly, the government can't afford half the stuff it should. People hiding money under the mattress are being selfish idiots, costing jobs and social benefits for all. Like many countries, Greece has a generous retirement scheme which it can not afford. It is now rising to 67, but too little too late. \n\nGreece is capable of being a leading economy in Europe, acting as a trading link between the EU and China. It has the ports, technology, infrastructure, and business to be perfect in this regard. If Greece cut the pension scheme, and enforced taxes properly (still hasn't built a land registry office after 10 years?) to match rates similar to the rest of Europe, the government would be in a better place. Which would mean the economy could be better.\n\nWorking efficiently allows for a better quality of work and life.

videos,3ca0gx,Flying_Dutchmann,Being a NASCAR fan of over 15 years I've seen my share a scary wrecks. This one though was one the scariest. I've never seen a car stop like that while being in mid-air. 195mph to 0 almost instantly. I immediately thought of the fans and then I saw the crew members running towards Dillon's car and I thought the worst. It's amazing that Austin walked away. 8 years ago he'd be dead. 2 years ago there was another wreck like this happened resulting in catch fence safety innovations. If it weren't for those improvements Austin's car wouldve went through the fence and into the crowd. It's scary to think of that. Thank god no other cars were tumbling towards the fence after Dillon crashed. The fence did it's job and it's amazing everyone is okay.\n\nTL;DR: The safety innovations over the past 15 years saved lives tonight.

Time.\n\nIn a sport where death, destruction, and dismemberment are realistic dangers on a weekly basis (daily when you count qualifying), NASCAR's safety record in the last decade has been model-student-type shit. Impressive."
videos,3ca0gx,p-wing,"Ever since we lost Dale Earnhardt in 2001 NASCAR went into full over protective parent mode. The safety innovations that have been made since have saved countless driver lives. For almost 70 years they've been racing, but only in the past 15 has safety been so focused on. Looking back when I first started watching the races, I cant believe they used to race with those old cars in those old conditions. Despite my bias, it's honestly one of the greatest examples of safety improvement in any fashion of all time. It sucks that we had to lose our greatest asset in Dale Earnhardt to figure it out though."

videos,3ca0gx,VINCE_C_,"Logically that is sound, but after watching both videos, Dale didn't go from 180ish to 0 in a split second like Austin did, it was in no way an instantaneous stop. He did hit a wall which had 0 give to it, but it doesn't appear near as bad because he was still moving at a considerable speed after crash and looked just like a dozen other crashes that I've seen the past decade (I realize that a lot of the reason he is still moving is because the other car is pushing him, but it doesn't look like a straight perpendicular impact, like a 180 to 0 impact would be). I had never seen the video of Dale's death until today, and am shocked at the massive difference of both crashes along with the complete opposite of outcomes. They seem to be doing everything right nowadays in respect to safety. Here's Dale's crash for those that are interested in watching the difference."

videos,3ca0gx,nascargo19,"Well, they usually have the roof flaps on the top of the car to help air flow through and keep the car on the ground, but the 11 car of Denny Hamlin just lifted it slightly and away it went."

I thought for sure Dillon was dead, or at least seriously injured.\n\nIt's really amazing how far the safety advances in the sport have come. That kills him for sure with the cars 15 years ago, and the catch fence improvements over the last few days kept the car in the track. The fact that only a few fans were injured was a big improvement some past incidents."

videos,3ca0gx,killbon,could someone explain to me why contact between cars is legal in NASCAR?
videos,3ca0gx,SirBensalot,"This is called bump drafting and it causes the cars to go faster. The cars are limited to about 200mph at this track as well as Talladega. This means the field is very bunched up, and if you have a car in front cutting through air, the car behind it has less drag. So the car behind can go faster. The drivers work as a team where the driver behind will push the driver in front to get them to go faster. \n\nTandem racing is no longer allowed as of 2014, where the cars would hook up for the whole race. \n\nOn the last restart, you could see Dale Jr's hand out of his window motioning to Denny Hamlin behind him. They were working as push partners, and when Dale would save his hand, he would accelerate to restart the race. He wanted Hamlin to get a head start so that Hamlin could push into the back of Jr's car and help him accelerate faster. \n\nHopefully that made sense."
videos,3ca0gx,CanAWoodChuckChuck,"Contact is and always will be part of NASCAR, it can create dangerous situations, but also incredibly racing.  These cars are the safest in Motorsports I'd argue, so it is not as dangerous as Indy or F1 with open cockpits, and they are designed to be super safe unlike many touring series."

videos,3ca0gx,Stoned_Datalore,"Amazing no one was seriously injured tonight.  Really says a lot about the safety of these cars.

Concerns about a second car getting airborne and going through a hole created by a first car. Maybe add a second fence? \n\nJeff bodine The fence looks a lot less beefy at this time and people are right up close to the fence. \n\nkyle larson The engine actually got stuck in the catch fence. \n\nI love Nascar and this won't prevent me from going to a race,  but I won't be trying to sit down low at Daytona or talladega."

videos,3ca0gx,nascargo19,"Rolex 24. There's a Tudor Sportscar series that runs a few endurance races. One of them being the road course at Daytona. There's about 60 cars that start the race, separated into four different classes of cars. Teams run the same car throughout te entire event, but they have 3 to 5 different drivers in the car. No driver can stay in the same ar for more than 4 hours at a time.\n\nIt's a very interesting race. I really like seeing the engineering that goes into it.

videos,3ca0gx,Chris_Nic,"I thought for sure that either Austin Dillon or a fan/fans would be seriously injured when I watched it live, but luckily everyone is fine for the most part (3 fans being treated for ""minor injuries,"" last I heard). The fact that a car can crash into a fence at almost 200 mph that close to thousands of people and have only a few come away with some scrapes and bruises is a huge testament to how safe the sport has become over the last decade or so."
videos,3ca0gx,radneck,I don't watch Nascar but is he lucky that the car hit the fence with the wheels first would that severely reduce the impact?
videos,3ca0gx,postslongcomments,NASCAR aficionado here. Doesn't really matter how he hit it. He was going 200 mph. It's a miracle of safety engineering he is alive.
videos,3ca0gx,SirBensalot,It does actually matter how he hits it. Roof first would likely have killed him. It'd have likely torn off the roof.
videos,3ca0gx,postslongcomments,The roll cage and chassis isn't gonna just tear in half from hitting the fence.
videos,3ca0gx,EVRYGOODNAMEISTAKEN,"The roof would take the force first vs it being distributed across the entire chassis  (think of a C shape vs an I shape). Dale Jr. was also concerned and thought he saw the roof hit first. As were the announcers. Also, concern of a roof-hit from Nascars form.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/NASCAR/comments/3c9yam/postrace_discussion_thread_nscs_coke_zero_400_at/cstldkq\n\nThe roll cage is certainly good, but that's hitting roof first is the worst case scenario. It can send debris directly in the cockpit.\n\nEDIT: Also Jimmie Johnson's comments. He doesn't mention the roof but states ""the fence and wires act as a cheese grater."" Now would you rather hit with the chassis/tires (which all got ripped out, or directly on the roof? It hit front-first - look at how it tore about the entire engine (the video shows it well). It you hit with the roof parallel to the fence, he's fuuuucked. http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/franchises/all-videos.sprint-cup-series-daytona-international-speedway-press-pass-jimmie-johnson.4339504143001.html"
videos,3ca0gx,radneck,But it could wreaked havoc on the roof by hitting those fence posts... Known for disintegrating IndyCars and their drivers when the circumstance arises. I think it would've been at least more of a risky accident.
videos,3ca0gx,TexasAg23,"You're splitting hairs. This could have just as easily killed him. Five, six, or seven years ago he would have been dead. My point was that the safety measures that have been implemented in Sprint Cup are remarkable (and their research transfers directly over to contemporary automobiles, keeping you and me alive in a common traffic wreck).\n\nHere is another example from a few years ago where the driver probably should have died but didn't: https://youtu.be/mfiXYnD9yj0"
videos,3ca0gx,SirBensalot,"Absolutely he is! Mainly because there is a lot more of the car to protect him from the fence. If he flew into the fence top-first, I can almost guarantee he would not have walked away from that. Those cars and fences are incredibly safe and a ton of work goes into designing every aspect of them, but even then, there's not much they can to about the poles and cables that his body would be flying into. A few years ago at Las Vegas Speedway, Dan Wheldon was in a similar accident with the fence, except he went in top-first and unfortunately didn't come out alive (I was actually at the race. Scary and incredibly sad stuff). Of course, Dan raced Indy cars so he had an open roof and even less protection, but Dillon would have most likely suffered a similar fate. I'm almost certain Dillon would have been seriously injured or worse had he not went into the fence the way he did. All things considered, this wreck could have been much, much worse."
videos,3ca0gx,TexasAg23,"Not to be insensitive, but I've always wondered, did you guys get a ticket refund, free tickets, or some other kind of compensation since the race was ended early?"

I'm not offended by any jokes or anything like that, but I have a feeling that most people aren't aware of the severity of it.\n\nSufferer's don't just sit there in a chair saying ""Who are you?"".  It's a lot of work for caregivers.  In my case - I pay a in-home care professional to come by the house while I'm at work, but apart from that it's all on me.  It's difficult for me to cook, mow the lawn, take a shower, etc while also having to keep him from dumping garbage in the toilet or whatever else he gets up to.\n\nAnd more importantly it's tough on him.  Each stage of the disease has its own challenges.  In the beginning it was a lot of depression, since he was completely aware of what was happening.  He would always struggle trying to find words to express what he was thinking and would stumble over them and lose his train of thought.  He would end up crying and having panic attacks when he was struggling over trying to figure out how to divide a can of cat food between two cats or how to turn the TV on."

I tried to explain her what was wrong with what she's asking and then went to tell my parents."
videos,3cac44,mrfundementalone,I'm so sorry for what you and your family go through. Such a devastating disease. You are such a good son. Keep doing what you do.

videos,3cac44,Bdowling,"was he always so neat and tidy - sorta OCD like? or is that something that comes with Alzheimers?\n\nI honestly never realised how bad it was, I also thought they just forgot everything. Its so strange to watch how he looks totally bemused at something, then like something in his brain triggers and he goes ""ah, i know what I do with this towel. I fold it and put it away"". I cant really explain but you know what I mean."
videos,3cac44,Mahfacka,"Hey OP I know your pain, my grandmother lived with us for about a year before we simply couldn't handle her anymore. She has to be supervised AT ALL TIMES because there is no telling what she'll do in the next 30 seconds. She has very advanced Alzheimers and remembers absolutely nothing. Her name, age, birthplace, how many children she has... no idea.  \n\nThe worst part is that, besides the alzheimers, she's in perfectly good health. She could live another 15 years this way, which is a huge financial burden.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. It's a immensely frustrating job (emphasis on it being a job) and it is not very rewarding either. If you want to talk shoot me a pm."

videos,3cac44,mpfree,"I'm really sorry for you and your dad. What you said in the YouTube description is spot on; he doesn't deserve to spend his retirement like this. \n\nMy Grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease about a year ago and we are starting to see the same behaviors from him, and it's troubling for certain. \n\nFor what it's worth, my thoughts are with you and your Dad. Hang in there man, you're doing the right thing for him."

My dad has it but I feel like I'm losing my mom at times more as she's watching her best friend melt away from her..... I cry daily and I'm struggling to find balance in our lives.  I feel so helpless for my dad I don't know what to do.  How do you stay strong mentally?  I'm struggling and he's not close to advanced as this :(
videos,3cac44,MrRiggs,"How do you stay strong mentally?\n\n\nI don't.  I feel broken down and helpless most of the time.\n\nWell I guess I should say that I don't have any kind of strategy to try and stay strong, and don't really actively think about ""strength""."
videos,3cac44,MrRoberto2,"Thanks for sharing this. I lost my grandfather to Alzheimer's back in 2002. He served in the U.S. Navy during WWII and afterwards and in Korea in some of the most advanced submarines of the time. My grandmother, bless her heart, as a very strong and independent woman, took car of him as long as she could. My grandfather, from what I remember, had been diagnosed with it when I was very young, yet he fought it, and only in 2001 did he really exhibit advanced and severe signs of it. He and my Grandmother took car of me until I started going to school, my mom and dad both had full time jobs. He hid his illness so well from me, I could only really tell when my grandmother decided she could no longer take good car of him did she put him in a nursing home, and she would spend every day, and every night that she could with him. I think everyone, especially my dad, took solace that the last thing to go was our faces. I want to say till almost the very end he would recognize my grandmother after a few seconds, he would recognize my dad as soon as he said, ""hi dad"". I will always remember in 2002 when I visited him for what was one of the final times my dad said ""here's Unaidedgrain, here to see you"" and my grandfathers face lit up and he immediately recognized me. I spent that whole day with him. He didn't really know how to do much anymore, but I remember him so incredibly excited to still remember me on that day. I'll always miss him, Alzheimer's is one terrible disease."
videos,3cac44,2nads,"In 2009, my wife and I bought an insurance business from a man who had been diagnosed in 2007 with Alzheimer's and who I had personally known all my life.  His wife had quit her job and was using her savings to keep the business afloat but it was becoming too much for her so we came to terms on the business.\n\nWe took over their location and one of the terms of the agreement was that we would, at least for one year, allow him to come to work everyday (she dropped him off and picked him up).  While we renovated the place to suit our needs, we left his office perfectly intact so that he would have a place to come to that was familiar to him (he loved the insurance business).\n\nWhen we took over his business, he was still very coherent.  Just often forgetful.  He and I would go out to meet clients and he played off that he remembered them very well though sometimes you could really tell that he didn't remember them.  Eventually, I couldn't take him with me anymore because just getting him in the car was a chore as he would either try to get in the driver's seat or the back seat and at some point he forgot how to work the seatbelt so I would have to buckle him in.\n\nBeing a place of business, we can't lock the doors and often he would walk out the door with myself or our employee going to bring him back in.  Once we were all so busy we hadn't realized he had walked out the door and had gone to the church across the street (across a major road) to solicit them for insurance.  We panicked and I eventually had to tell his wife that he could not come there anymore.  He would also become belligerent when we told him he could not go outside telling us that we couldn't tell him what to do.\n\nHe was an extremely successful insurance agent and very well loved by his clients.  My father had known his since the 60's.  To see him deteriorate like that was heartbreaking.  In the beginning, when he KNEW what was happening to him, he would often break down and cry inconsolably.  By the time he left our office, he was a baby that needed to be cared for 24/7.\n\nI had but a glimpse of what his wife goes through (he is still alive).  To see your loved one lose their mind but still be with you physically has got to be awful.  Worse, they tend to become physical and verbally abusive and it's hard not to take that personally.  Or to be embarrassed by it when it's done in public knowing it's not him, it's the disease.\n\nI pray to God that neither I nor my immediate family are ever diagnosed with something this awful."
videos,3cac44,vivianjamesplay,This was rough to watch.  Took me back to my Grandmother who passed a few years back of Alzheimer's.  The patience you show is remarkable.  It truly is a dreadful disease and the round the clock care that's required is taxing on family members like yourself.  It's even more painful when you can see that they are trying desperately to perform tasks that they once knew but they can't quite get it right anymore.  It must be horrific feeling trapped inside your mind.  I feel for you man.  Best of luck.
videos,3cac44,Uh_hallo,"I just recently lost my grandmother to Alzheimers, 4+ years, it was tough at the end and through-out. my aunt and mom were taking care of her because they refused to take her to a home, man it was tough on everyone..you see them slowly going away..kept looking in her purse, pulling things out putting them back, hiding napkins, take silverware, asking who are these people coming in the house (which was my aunt and mom) it was tough.\n\nThe real hard part was them not knowing you."
videos,3cac44,Kiwizqt,"Ill be honest, i really didnt know too much about the disease and this has really opened my eyes.

videos,3cac44,Ye11ow,"My dad had Early Onset Alzheimer's.  He was in his forties and for the most part, it was my mom and myself taking care of him.  He was a small town lawyer and an all around good person.  To watch him fade was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.\n\nI was thirteen when it got bad.   He couldn't do things around the house, and he'd get so angry at himself because he knew he was a burden.\n\nIt killed me inside, because I had no one who knew what it was like.  It haunted me.  He passed during my senior year.\n\nSince then, I've lost a brother to the disease and another one of my brothers has it.  It's such a difficult thing to explain and to deal with.\n\nI feel for you OP.  I know it is difficult.  Please remember to take care of and be kind to yourself.  I know it's hard and some days it just weighs on you.  But, it will pass and believe it or not, there will be memories of this time that you think about fondly.  There will be memories of him having clarity or enjoying something that he used to enjoy and those moments will be precious in ways that no one else may ever truly understand."
videos,3cac44,shuckdodgers,"He does not deserve to spend his retirement like this  \n\n\nMakes me think of that Woody Allen quote: âIn my next life I want to live my life backwards. You start out dead and get that out of the way. Then you wake up in an old people's home feeling better every day. You get kicked out for being too healthy, go collect your pension, and then when you start work, you get a gold watch and a party on your first day. You work for 40 years until you're young enough to enjoy your retirement. You party, drink alcohol, and are generally promiscuous, then you are ready for high school. You then go to primary school, you become a kid, you play. You have no responsibilities, you become a baby until you are born. And then you spend your last 9 months floating in luxurious spa-like conditions with central heating and room service on tap, larger quarters every day and then Voila! You finish off as an orgasm!â"

videos,3cac44,foofighters92,"There isn't any single cure, there are many different ways they try to cure these diseases and Illnesses.\n\nI recall they had a vaccine for Alzheimers that looked very promising after years of research, the tests of it on Mice worked great,  It caused massive hemorrhages in Humans, Most of their years of research lead to nothing.\n\nHere is a much more recent treatment very different from vaccines and drugs http://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimer-s-treatment-fully-restores-memory-function\n\nHowever It might not work on Humans, Tests are still 2 years away, and even if its somewhat successful there isn't anything saying something else may pop up negating the treatment, Even then it could be years between human testing and first trials of it on patients and then a few more years until it's common.\n\nIt's the same way with any treatments for Diseases,  years of research can look to very promising, then it doesn't go anywhere and they basically need to start over again. \n\nIt's not exactly solved by dumping people and money on to it, it speeds up some minor parts of the research, but it still takes someone to come up with an idea and that completely relies on the person doing the research."

Here is an example of a world class goalkeeper getting a shot, which is shot from even further out, scored on them, very similar.

And last year the Tour of Britain went right past my bedroom window (I have no idea why this keeps happening). Trust me, you KNOW the route, where it will be and when the roads will be closed for weeks beforehand.\n\nIf he has a set route, he'd have passed by countless road signs saying when and for how long each part of the course would be blocked off. \n\n\nBut there should have been better planning\n\n\nYou seem to think the Tour De France is some little operation that rocks up one morning, decides to have a race and doesn't tell anyone. It's a massive event with huge amounts of organisation behind it. It doesn't pop up one day without notice like a candy store in a fairy story."
videos,3c9cuq,fondueadodo,His set route may have crossed the closure multiple times also. \n\nI live in Nashville and they do the concerts or music city marathon that basically close down huge chunks of the city and I never know about it until it's too late. \n\nI supervise a furniture moving crew.

videos,3c9290,Leadboy,CD-RW is a different tech. You can't rewrite onto a store bought CD/DVD
videos,3c9290,f4hy,"yeah this is very interesting, something i never thought about. \n\nfrom wikipedia\n\n\nThe media for CD-RW has basically the same layers as CD-R media. The reflective layer is, however, a silver-indium-antimony-tellurium (AgInSbTe) alloy, which has in its original state, a polycrystalline structure and reflective properties. When writing the laser beam uses its maximum power (8 - 14 mW)[4] to heat the material to 500â700 Â°C. This causes liquefaction of the material. In this state, the alloy loses its polycrystalline structure, assumes an amorphous state and lose its reflectivity. The lost reflectivity serves the same function as bumps on a manufactured CDs and the opaque spots on a CD-R which will be read as a ""0"".[5] The polycrystalline state of the disk forms the trenches, which is read as ""1"".[5] The scanning signal when reading is created by strong or weak reflection of the laser beam (not unlike the destructive interference of light caused by and used to read ""pits"" in pressed CD-ROMs). To erase the disc, the write beam heats the amorphous regions with low power to about 200 Â°C. The alloy is not melted, but returns to the polycrystalline state and is thus again reflective."

A lot, if not all, fabrication and builds grind to a complete halt if we subtract our migrant work force from the equation. Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans... All of these men are hard working and skilled. From scaffold crews to welders, some of the hottest, dirtiest, toughest work to be found is being done by these men.\n I hear a lot of recent college graduates complaint about lack of work opportunities. I can assure you they would wilt and drag up after one day in full safety gear while welding in confined spaces. These guys do it 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. \n\nI'm sure Trump said what he said to get people riled up, and unfortunately there are a lot of scummy folks who will totally agree with him. You couldn't find a blister or a scar from a job site anywhere on that man, and the same applies to those who agree with him."

Whether or not you find that reprehensible doesn't mean it's up to you justify the damage that has been done by a plague of mostly (contrary to your claim) unskilled, uneducated, rapidly reproducing group who are adamant against cultural assimilation. This is not a recipe for long term peaceful stability and success. What trump said was overboard and without tact, but it is in fact very reasonable to be upset about what has happened to our country and what will happen to it in the future if we don't reconsider our policies: (anchor children, welfare, deportation, and border policy).\n\nLarge immigrant populations were great in the industrial revolution.

videos,3c8yq5,raiderrobert,"They're trying to pass the owner off as an evil and heartless man, but it's the people's own free will to eat there. The restaurant explicitly states the dangers, which is more than any fast food place can say. For example, McDonald's will coat their salads in sugar. So you think you're eating healthy, but if you go out of your way to look up the nutritional facts, you'll see it's a real joke. 22 grams of fat in a 10oz salad. And there are plenty of places that pass themselves off as a healthy alternative, but really aren't any better.\nSo yes, this restaurant uses a gimmick, but it is essentially embracing the culture of the U.S.A. in a way that no other place does. It's saying, ""This food is really bad for you, but you're going to eat it anyway, aren't you?"" It's morbid, but it's a morbid truth.\nMy biggest qualm is how they give free food to morbidly obese people. If you take people with low self-control and enable them in that way, it won't end well. But at the same time, they can't say they didn't know what they were getting into. Some people choose that lifestyle, and it's their decision to make."

You can't pass a law that will make these people suddenly value a healthy lifestyle but you can educate them about how their lifestyle affects them and the people around them.\n\nI would also like to mention that the owner's shock therapy method though, does not work. It's more of a gimmick than a reason to stop eating because he's clearly assisted people eat themselves to death or gain weight more than he's scared them away from eating. While it's unethical, you think these morbidly obese and sick people would care enough about there families to stop.\n\nIsn't his whole plan to just get his regular customers overweight to the point where they weigh enough to eat for free, then eventually die? That free meals thing is like assisted suicide.\n\nEdit: yeah the gimmick and deaths help him get on the news which means more customers and more money not necessarily a more health aware society."

The whole gimmick is sarcastic, which is why healthy people don't eat there.  Everyone knows what it is.  The POINT is that everything is bad for you.  Not sure if they still do it, but a combo meal used to come with a pack of filterless cigarettes.

videos,3c89ok,ironvin21,I'd like to hear a physicists interpretation of this. I am a skeptic but I am also willing to be open-minded as long as the information they are citing is sound.
videos,3c89ok,Kung120,"This movie is essentially a confusing hodgepodge of science and religious traditions. \n\nThe central thesis seems to be that science is among these religious traditions in that it is a way to understand the world. The presentation implies scientific facts do not enjoy a level of plausibility or credibility above and beyond any traditional practice, religious or otherwise. Ultimately, this is accomplished by asserting that the universe is all vibrations, and a yogi or guru who is enchanted with some energy magicks is drawing on ... these same vibrations.\n\nI mean, they have every artistic right to make this movie, but it doesn't show much respect for the viewer in my opinion.\n\nThe juxtaposition of science and non-science methods is extraordinarily misleading to the viewer. \n\nI guess this thing with vibrations is a general hand wave appeal to string theory. But this is a distraction. Calling ""energy"" ""string-like"" doesn't make the assertions in this movie make any more sense or compatible with existing science. \n\nAlso, even if we accepted that the beautiful myths reviewed in this movie were somehow compatible with string theory, there is currently no experimental evidence for string theory per se, leaving all the movie's work still ahead of it.\n\nUltimately this is a carnival for pseudoscientists. ""Come one, come all,"" screams the Barker.\n\nBut at the end they really say some asshole shit. They say ""The true crisis in our world is not social, political, or economic. Our crisis is a crisis of consciousness, an inability to directly experience our true nature. An inability to recognize this nature in other people and all things"" Don't be an asshole dude. I understand you are talking about mindfulness, and I know you're talking about separating the pain out from the suffering, and all that. But people die of hunger all day, all the time, all over the world - and that's economic. I guess those children and innocent people should focus on experiencing their true nature.\n\nThis ""true crisis"" the people who made this movie has is that of being first-world, confused assholes. They didn't have to add that insult at the end."

So many of these are pressure explosions (commonly called BLEVE) which are absolutely devastating.  \n\nAny firefighter will tell you there are few things that worry us more than a liquid being heated under pressure as you can see in several of the examples in the video (the brush piles, the barrel fires, etc). Even though its not contained with a conventional lid the debris acts like a lid for the very, very flammable gas vapor while the not-flammable-at-all gas liquid sits at the bottom. Think of a propane tank with a fire underneath it; we have extreme pressure, a flammable gas rapidly expanding inside of it, and a steel tank so basically what you have is a 1000lb grenade.  \n\nPS: If you love things blowing up check out one of the many BLEVE youtube videos :)"

Two, there is nothing in the constitution that says you are free to travel without being questioned.  Three, even if this constituted a search, it would fall under probable cause, since if you are unwilling to show proof that you have a train ticket, it is reasonable to conclude that you did not pay.\n\nThe things that disturb me about this video are one, the fact that even though this guy is totally wrong here, the rest of the passengers were giving him shit for standing up for his rights.  Two, the officers start telling him he is inciting a riot and holding the other passengers hostage.  No one was rioting.  There weren't even enough people on that car to constitute a riot.  Also, the guy wasn't holding anyone hostage.  They could have left the train at any time.  The officers and the operator were the ones holding people ""hostage"".  Finally, the officers were instantly hostile towards the guy, even though he was not being hostile towards them.  At the end of the day, its a $2 train ticket, was it really worth the police stopping the train and getting all upset with the guy?

videos,3c75xo,tumbl3weed,"""Astronomers are gearing up for high-energy fireworks coming in early 2018, when a stellar remnant the size of a city meets one of the brightest stars in our galaxy. The cosmic light show will occur when a pulsar discovered by NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope swings by its companion star. Scientists plan a global campaign to watch the event from radio wavelengths to the highest-energy gamma rays detectable.\n\nThe pulsar, known as J2032+4127 (J2032 for short), is the crushed core of a massive star that exploded as a supernova. It is a magnetized ball about 12 miles across, or about the size of Washington, weighing almost twice the sun's mass and spinning seven times a second. J2032's rapid spin and strong magnetic field together produce a lighthouse-like beam detectable when it sweeps our way.\n\nThe pulsar orbits a massive companion named MT91 213. Classified as a Be star, the companion is 15 times the mass of the sun and shines 10,000 times brighter. Be stars drive strong outflows, called stellar winds, and are embedded in large disks of gas and dust.\n\nFollowing an elongated orbit lasting about 25 years, the pulsar passes closest to its partner once each circuit. Whipping around its companion in early 2018, the pulsar will plunge through the surrounding disk and trigger astrophysical fireworks. It will serve as a probe to help astronomers measure the massive star's gravity, magnetic field, stellar wind and disk properties.""\n\nRead more at: http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/astronomers-predict-fireworks-from-rare-stellar-encounter-in-2018"

videos,3c84zv,Joshka,"Ok, that's bullshit. I didn't want to have to defend bronies but at the risk of being labeled one and downvoted to shit I will. The fact is, there are lots of other reasons to be a brony. Some of them legit think it's a good show, and others just need a social group that is accepting of socially awkward weirdos like them to hang out with.\n\nI just have seen some documentary about them somewhere and it was pretty fascinating. They're all pretty much just nerds with no friends that have been rejected by everyone else. Bronies are the only group they found acceptance with.
