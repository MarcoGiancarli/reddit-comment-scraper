Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,outfromtheashes,6,Wed Jul 22 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"Just take a moment and look at your shave den, your medicine cabinet, your room, or whatever space you have dedicated to your shaving gear. Look at all the great products! Some of you are minimalists and have found exactly the right gear for you. Some of you are collectors, with a lot of your stuff just looking pretty. Some try to keep it modest (but usually fail and end up selling/PIFing things).   No matter what camp you're in, you've been able to turn a chore into a hobby. Your morning is just that much better. Or you have something relaxing to look forward to in the evening. You have me time.  Not only that, but you're part of a diverse community of generous and kind assholes, who have clean, smooth faces, are rough around the edges, but are good people. I've learned about pens, about cooking, about /u/redthursdays's life. This is a great place.  Now that I think about it, I have the Gillette Fusion and gel to thank for being here. If it didn't suck so much and wasn't so goddamn expensive, I might not be here. So oddly enough, after typing this, I'm grateful for my Gillette Fusion shaving heritage, because now I appreciate how much better this is.  I, for one, am excited for Austere August, especially in remembering how horrible my shave was for all the years before. I could pick products out of a hat and still have a way more enjoyable shave than I ever had before."
Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,redthursdays,5,Wed Jul 22 00:30:24 2015 UTC,Hahaha my life

Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,IllegalMonk,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:45:04 2015 UTC,What did I even do before constantly thinking about shaving gear and getting to petty Internet arguments over it?

Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,Huckleberryking,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:46:12 2015 UTC,"Haha, no, not really. I was just thinking tonight, ""Man, that'll really kinda suck having to shave with the same stuff all month."" Then I had the epiphany that that's exact what I did for most of my shaving life, except with stuff I hated. I was reminded how much better this is."
Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,Kittycat-banana,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:48:36 2015 UTC,I agree with what you are saying but it's damn hard to choose between B&M Lavanille and RazoRock SMdF ;) The cost is what really drive me to this. $20 for four blades that lasted a couple of weeks is insane. The stuff that the artisans produce is the icing on the cake. All of them make amazing things and their customer service is unbelievable. I'm going to try the challenge but fear I'll only make it a couple of weeks.
Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,Kittycat-banana,2,Wed Jul 22 00:42:16 2015 UTC,"Shoot,  my shaving life is so much better now. I only used a razor and water. No prep or post shave prep except the occasional lotion. My skin thanks me daily. It's nice.   I'm really excited to do Austere August! I just have to decide which soap and brush....

Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,Kittycat-banana,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:06:34 2015 UTC,Hmmm....yes. Make it harder. Pick either Pink or Champagne though.
Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,powersquash,2,Wed Jul 22 01:16:36 2015 UTC,Champagne it is. What soap/after are you considering? I'll probably do Summer Storm soap and Trade Winds after.
Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,Kittycat-banana,2,Wed Jul 22 01:18:20 2015 UTC,Either Velvet or Black Label Lavender followed by LBdS AS. I wanted to do LBdS for the soap but I thought I should at least challenge myself a bit!
Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,NeedsMoreMenthol,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:27:36 2015 UTC,I need to try some Velvet. I imagine I'd like it. I'll miss my Belle for a month. :(
Wet_Shavers,3e50uj,Rawffle2,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:44:47 2015 UTC,I really like Velvet. Its no Belle of course but she smells very lovely. I always feel fancier when I use it for some reason.
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,alexandergjones,8,Tue Jul 21 17:28:44 2015 UTC,Snazzy ass case and stand. Guess we know where $200 of the $300 price tag went :P
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,MrTooNiceGuy,6,Tue Jul 21 17:31:53 2015 UTC,There is more metal in the stand than in the razor!
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,MrTooNiceGuy,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:07 2015 UTC,"It sure looks like that's the case. The idea on the leather case was great, but the execution on the stitching looks like corners were cut (not saying I could do better, but it just looks a bit rushed). Overall I like the look of it, and the price doesn't seem far out of place, especially if it's the whole package. Eager to hear your thoughts."
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,Kingoftherock,4,Tue Jul 21 18:29:16 2015 UTC,If you know anybody with some extra valet blades then I can give it a go. For now it's just nice to look at.
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,Kingoftherock,5,Tue Jul 21 18:41:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, packaging is pretty nice. Is that leather that it came in? If so, how's the quality of the leather?  Also, how is the finish of the razor? The head looks a bit rough in the 5th picture down"
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,Cricket620,4,Tue Jul 21 17:30:59 2015 UTC,The leather is awesome quality very thick.   The razor finish is very nice I think that was just a fingerprint in that photo.  http://i.imgur.com/SyVXjbJ.jpg
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,jedimika,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"Very nice. It's good to know that at least they're not skimping on quality, even if the pricing is a bit unreasonable   Thanks for the extra pictures and I look forward to your review"
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,ALE360,2,Tue Jul 21 17:48:08 2015 UTC,"We don't know anything about quality without knowing how it shaves. This is a tool, after all."
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,IllegalMonk,4,Tue Jul 21 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"I still feel the price tag is a joke, but I'll admit, that thing looks gorgeous."
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,ALE360,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:45:59 2015 UTC,"I loves the looks too. If it truly shaves well, then I might opt for it, but I just purchased another custom straight and there are artisans out there where for $350 and up, you can get a 'one-off' custom straight. So, I do agree on the pricing being a wee bit high given it's a production razor."
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,ALE360,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:17 2015 UTC,What is a custom straight razor to you if not a made-to-order razor?
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,ALE360,3,Wed Jul 22 00:53:20 2015 UTC,"Presentation is very nice, BUT how well does it shave? I'm overly anxious to learn about its shaving capabilities.  How much does the head pivot?  How easy it is to change the blade?  Thank you."
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,Cricket620,3,Tue Jul 21 18:28:28 2015 UTC,Once I get a blade I can make a quick video

Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,JohnSherlockHolmes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:54 2015 UTC,Hold it...I thought the price included two packs of blades? Were you able to purchase the razor without the blades and the monthly subscription plan? Thanks.
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,Kittycat-banana,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:39 2015 UTC,I enquired about a review unit and they decided to send me one.   He didn't buy it.
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,Wrath3n,2,Tue Jul 21 19:35:14 2015 UTC,I was sent a unit free of charge to review here.
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,reytheist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:44:36 2015 UTC,Daaang I guess it would look odd if a bunch of people started requesting these razors for review haha.  Good on you for asking the question and I'm looking forward to your thoughts.
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,elSchiz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:29 2015 UTC,Kind of hard to review without blades isn't it?   I'm also interested if they're letting you keep the unit. I feel that makes a difference in the review.
Wet_Shavers,3e3eay,crazindndude,2,Wed Jul 22 00:30:52 2015 UTC,Not sure if I can keep it or not. I guess I should ask

Wet_Shavers,3e2976,Wishbound,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:43 2015 UTC,Welp...probably gonna need to buy that new SV soap
Wet_Shavers,3e2976,hermy65,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:11 2015 UTC,Great job putting this list together! And yes that SV soap looks awesome from the scent pyramid. Didn't like the performance of my Felce but this is tempting me to give them another go.
Wet_Shavers,3e2976,crazindndude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:49:27 2015 UTC,Thank you! I agree that one does look promising though I've not had the pleasure of trying SV yet. I was under the impression that they were supposed to be great performers?
Wet_Shavers,3e2976,Wishbound,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:55 2015 UTC,For like 99% of people yeah it definitely seems to be great. I just couldn't get it to lather nicely though.

Wet_Shavers,3e2976,ItchyPooter,2,Tue Jul 21 18:06:44 2015 UTC,If you still have it around you should give it another shot. It earned it's good reputation.
Wet_Shavers,3e2976,almightywhacko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"I do still have it.  I got a sample from Garry's.  If you've ever used a soap sample from Garry's, I think therein might be one of my problems.  He grates up the soap into samples with a microplane or cheese grater.  So I smashed everything together as best I could in a shallow dish, but even in cheese-grated pieces, the soap is quite hard and doesn't stick together terribly well.  I probably didn't get a long enough load.  I definitely will revisit, because like you said, it doesn't have an almost universal good reputation for no reason."
Wet_Shavers,3e2976,ItchyPooter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:42 2015 UTC,You might wanna wet your sample down with warm water and then mash it together again and let it dry. MdC is a triple-milled soap so it is quite dense and firm. Wetting it should soften the bits a little and help them stick together.
Wet_Shavers,3e2976,almightywhacko,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:15 2015 UTC,MdC     Bae caught whacko slippin'
Wet_Shavers,3e2976,MrTooNiceGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 19:40:10 2015 UTC,Ahh yes MdS not MdC. Got my initials mixed up but still MdS is worth a second shot.

Wet_Shavers,3e2976,crazindndude,3,Tue Jul 21 14:30:35 2015 UTC,Anybody else notice this: Please note that we will not be releasing any new seasonal rotation scents for the foreseeable future.  I guess i can stop trying to find room in my cabinet for all of Wills new seasonal stuff throughout the year and my wallet will be happier
Wet_Shavers,3e2976,hermy65,4,Tue Jul 21 14:52:01 2015 UTC,"I can't blame him. It has to be a ton of work to develop a new soap every season, on top of everything else he's doing."

Wet_Shavers,3e2976,almightywhacko,5,Tue Jul 21 18:13:03 2015 UTC,Firm. The tallow base survived the additional menthol much better than the vegan base did. It's the same consistency as our other White Label soaps. :)
Wet_Shavers,3e2976,BostonPhotoTourist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:24 2015 UTC,"How does the ""freeze"" compare to last year's version? I test lathered a sample of last year's and I would say it's the coldest menthol soap I've tried (but not in a painful way). Either way I'll find out soon as I've already ordered the set :D."

To all the people thinking of doing it partially (i.e. weekdays), that's perfectly OK, but please reconsider. Like the June Challenge, the fun of this contest is to see who can make it through the whole month.  If you think a month is easy, you'll be surprised. If you really want to challenge yourself, pick a soap you have problems with. At the end of the month, your problems will be gone. I did Williams Mug Soap last November, which always gave me misery. I can now lather the stuff in my sleep.  Note: the difficult challenge is the soap. The hardware is dirt simple to go a whole month with, unless it's something your struggling with."

Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,ItchyPooter,4,Tue Jul 21 12:46:03 2015 UTC,"A while back one user was asking participants to take part in a blind razor blade study, which meant minimizing variables of hardware, software, and sticking to the exact same routine to see how only different blades impacted the shave. I participated in it for about sixteen weeks. Let me tell you, nothing was more satisfying than being able to change my soap and razor after it was over.  That said, I learned a lot about my shave technique and shaving in general due to the amount of focus required and the fact that we needed to report on each shave after the fact. I definitely recommend the experience.  Just a tip for those who want to take part: choose a soap with a complex scent profile, one that you really love. The variety in smells really helped keep the experience enjoyable for me. (I used Strop Shoppe Baker Street and if I did again I would probably use a fougere)"

Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,arbarnes,2,Tue Jul 21 16:12:50 2015 UTC,"Week-to-week, I could do.   Yeah, I think that's what I will do as well. A single setup for an entire week. A week is long enough to start getting into some of the subtleties of all the products but it's not long enough to start getting boring."

Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,pathmarkcm,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:00:22 2015 UTC,"I ordered near the end of June; my suspicion is that lots of other people did the same to take advantage of the pre-increase pricing, thus increasing the backlog even more. That's okay, I'm patient. Kinda."

Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,Banes_Pubes,3,Tue Jul 21 11:36:09 2015 UTC,"I think as long as the same set up is used everytime we shave it should be good. Some people just don't shave everyday, don't want to exclude them"
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,TAC_,2,Tue Jul 21 12:46:33 2015 UTC,"If you guys really are ok with that, and everyone agrees, then Im also in.  Edit: I use the same brush, razor and blade every day to begin with. I just need to settle on a soap and AS so that shouldnt be too hard at all"
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,pathmarkcm,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:02 2015 UTC,I'm just throwing it out there so it's pretty accessible for everyone. From reading the comments further down it seems everyone wants a weekday only type thing. Regardless of what is agreed upon I'm down for it
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,NeedsMoreMenthol,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:11 2015 UTC,Yeah I have some themed months planned out for the next year but it's all loose 'rules.' I'm just going to shave according to my own schedule but the themes make it kind of fun and interesting :)
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,Huckleberryking,2,Tue Jul 21 16:56:24 2015 UTC,"The point of the challenge is not to make someone shave every day if that's not their normal routine. As /u/TAC_ stated, it's about using the same setup for a month, whether you shave twice a day or twice a week."
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,sunderka1987,3,Tue Jul 21 21:40:12 2015 UTC,I would definitely do it for a couple of weeks at least.

Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,uselessgreggy,3,Tue Jul 21 12:10:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I could do this. Not sure what soap to use, though. That's my major downfall.  I may have to make some unscented Scale Polish so it doesn't interfere with my cologne selections."
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,nbnoir,2,Tue Jul 21 13:20:37 2015 UTC,"I thought about the fragrance as well, then just picked a setup that I had enough of a single cologne to go through all month. Plus it is a fairly cheap cologne, so not that big a deal to use it daily."
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,uselessgreggy,3,Tue Jul 21 20:44:28 2015 UTC,I do this pretty much anyway. I'd just have to put away Roam/Baux for the month since it's too hot for that all day every day.

Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,chill31613,3,Wed Jul 22 03:57:06 2015 UTC,I'm interested but I would have to take care to re-pack my travel shaving kit bag with the active configuration before I leave.  I don't know what has happened to my work; it's like I'm travelling every month now.  Maybe I can find a cheap Red Tip and Omega boar and then I could have two parallel configurations.  Not completely austere if I have to invest to become austere.
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,JohnMcGurk,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:37 2015 UTC,I'm in for hardware. Perfect opportunity to break-in my first boar brush. I'd have to give the software some thought.  I went a little crazy this month and want to rotate all the new stuff.
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,DamnitGoose,3,Tue Jul 21 15:29:28 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely down with this. Mine will have a twist. When I was straightening out my work area in the basement I found at least 3 different containers with unknown soap in them. Not completely unknown I suppose, I made them but I have no idea what batch they came from. Could be tallow, might be vegan. Lanolin? Perhaps. Goat's milk? Definitely a possibility. Maybe tea? There's some of that. I'm just going to grab one and go for it. I'm just going to hope it didn't come from a batch that sucked. I'm usually meticulous about labeling my different recipes. This ought to be fun.  Might give it another twist and use a razor I've never used before. I have far too many of those."
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,pds_king21,3,Tue Jul 21 16:40:43 2015 UTC,I'm interested. Have two new brushes coming in the mail this week.   MR18  Personna Blue  One of the new brushes   B&M Fougere Aromatique  Fine American Blend  Every Man Jack Mint
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,hedgehogsinhats,3,Tue Jul 21 17:14:04 2015 UTC,I'd be down for this idea. Count me in
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,TheSelfButcher,2,Tue Jul 21 18:01:57 2015 UTC,An interesting idea. Would need to seriously give thought to what setup to use however.
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,IllegalMonk,2,Tue Jul 21 09:50:02 2015 UTC,I'm in. Sounds like a great way to force consistency. I'll use SRs on the week-ends though.
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,abekon,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry guys, I'm going to give this one a pass. I'm going on a sample spree I think, or maybe just using soaps I don't normally use anymore. I love my variety."

Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,redrider_99,2,Tue Jul 21 13:16:42 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely in. I 3017'd my Cheshire during the June Soap challenge, and have been working on my Drunken Goat as of late. I should be able to finish DG halfway through August, then I can start on my B & M Bay Rum"
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,abekon,2,Tue Jul 21 13:17:12 2015 UTC,I'm in for this.  I might be right at the tail end of a soap starting out August.  I'll make a call then to either try to stretch it or just move onto one I know will last.

So as motivation to get up, I make a nice breakfast and coffee then have a really nice shave. Having a new experience every day plays a significant part of that. BUT I could probably compromise and do a rotation of like 4."
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,thiney49,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:22:12 2015 UTC,"Cool article, but I just can't (or want to) become a morning person. I wake up at the latest possible time to walk the dog and get me to work shaved. Showers are at night, and breakfast is at work to maximize morning sleep. My best hours are from 11pm to 1am. I wake up at 7am. Weekends are offset +2 hours.  There's gotta be a genetic link because my son is identical. My wife and daughter are the opposite. That's why they're grumpy and I'm so easy going ;-)"
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,tiglathpilesar,2,Wed Jul 22 03:28:43 2015 UTC,"I would probably participate sparingly. I doubt I'll shave daily, especially with my moving and being out of town two weekends at least, but I could commit to a single setup for the days I do shave. I think it will be easier that way."
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,NeedsMoreMenthol,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:08 2015 UTC,"I'm aware that this will make for a boring as fuck month of reading the SOTD thread, but I'm prepared to make that sacrifice.

Maybe I'll do my own house rules version where every week is a new soap, to be used for 5 days consecutively. I like the idea of using the same soap multiple days in a row; it really helps reveal some of the subtler characteristics that you miss if you only use it once a week or even less frequently."
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,OnaBlueCloud,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:48:42 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of doing the same thing. Only concern I have is that my badger and boar brushes don't ever dry fully in 24 hours. I really got some good shaves the 5 days in a row I used my Gillette Slim earlier this month.
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,I_Broke_Nalgene,2,Tue Jul 21 12:41:01 2015 UTC,"I might be completely off-base, but I think the daily washing with soap would keep whatever bacteria or fungus that might cause rot cleaned out enough that it wouldn't ever actually take hold.  You know all those brushes in antique stores that still have bristles attached, they probably got used daily and I doubt any care was taken to get them dried out regularly.  I think for a month you'd be just fine."
Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,engra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:22:04 2015 UTC,"People have been using one brush for decades, and I don't ever recall and medical warnings against it.

Wet_Shavers,3e1ltt,chileheadd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:06 2015 UTC,Sounds reasonable. Now I just need to decide which brush is going with me to the Desert Island :D.   Edit:  Maybe I'll do one week at a time so I can decide which brushes I REALLY want to keep. I've been trying to prune down my brush collection a little (also to fund new purchases). It makes it even harder that most of my brushes are very different from each other. If they covered the same ground in face feel/size/etc. it would make it easier to decide which one I liked best.

I should have just plagarised a quote from the web and massaged it - this was not easy.  You're sitting in a sidewalk cafe in Venice, sipping on an espresso corretto.  It's morning, so there's a dampness in the air. You're not wearing your Urban Sombrero because you're savoring a Gitanes and don't want your hat to smell smokey.  A tall, raven-haired woman walks by.  You smile.  She walks towards you.  Your eyes lock.  She bends down to whisper something in your ear.  ""You smell better than /u/outfromtheashes does"", and slips you her hotel key.  You don't always smell this good, but when you do, it's I Coloniali Mango."
Wet_Shavers,3e1mta,NeedsMoreMenthol,10,Tue Jul 21 16:33:02 2015 UTC,"As her swaying hips fade from view, you look down and thoughtfully tap your now-tepid espresso. You watch the ripples in the blackness below as you think to yourself, ""This broad must be crazy. I can't smell better than /u/outfromtheashes.""  You can't help but thinking that she's either crazy, or that you're the potential victim of a trap. You weigh your odds on the hot-crazy scale. You remember her hips and the softness of her fingers as she slipped you the hotel key. You stand up from the table, damned be the consequences.  Leaving your espresso behind, you proceed to the nearest waterway and commandeer a gondola. You look down at the key card, which proudly displays the logo of the Luna Hotel Bagiloni. Your anticipation builds as you make your way through this watery labyrinth of a town.  After arriving, your eyes ping-pong from the card to the magnificent hotel in front of you. Your face doesn't hide your incredulity well, but then you remember that hair. You carry a look of cold resolve as you proceed with determination.  The concierge, in her thick Italian accent, is kind enough to point you in the direction of the suite. The key card is now slippery in your sweaty palms. You reach the door and insert the key. A small green LED accompanies the mechanical click of the door unlocking.  You open the door.  Only to find a four hundred pound man, whom you later find out is named Antonio, lying naked with his lover, Giovanni. They look at you in consternation, and you exit as fast as you can.

I've looked at that and these beauties.  From what I've read, the main drawback about manual espresso machines is the inconsistent pressure. This is where the ROK gave me pause. Drawing a shot is supposed to be around 9 BAR. I have no clue what the ROK pushes or how it maintains that pressure. All the demonstration videos I've watched they just crank it down and let it do its thing. Makes me wary. The temperature loss could influence the shot, but if you're monitoring it before pouring through the top it might be okay. That is another area that gives me pause. Espresso machines have dedicated boilers for a reason yeah?  But... I don't have an espresso machine (yet) so I'm probably one of the most unreliable sources in this area lol.

I haven't wanted anything else. But yesterday I got Trade Winds in, loved it in the tub, and had to give it a go.  I enjoyed a Starburst from my spent from Chiseled Face, took a shower, grabbed my lovely Lady (with blue starbursts of her own), my brush, and set to work.  The soap was lovely with a nice old spice smell with aquatic scents to back and ""clean"" it up. This will definitely stay at the top of my rotation.  Two-pass DFS shave. I can't have a bad shave with this equipment, guaranteed.  The aftershave is even better than the soap. Here is an excerpt from my first impressions posted on w_e. This happened when I went out for dinner last night.:   I go out for a drink and some dinner because I'm single, and that's what we do. I sit down at the bar. This goddess (beautifully tanned, long black hair, slender, with legs.... oh my, did she have legs) walks past me, turns back around, and says, ""Wow, you smell really good. What are you wearing?"" After taking a second to remember the English language, I replied, ""It's an aftershave called Trade Winds.""   It's that good. More aquatic scents than old spice, and it's truly wonderful and definitely something special. Home run, /u/chiseledface.    Didn't really make up for my shit morning though. I wake up later than planned, go out to take care of the ducks, and there are two raccoons in with the ducks. They've almost killed one of them.  They can't figure out how to get out of the duck house, but eventually they get into the enclosed wooden part of the house. And by this point, I'm already running late. I'm not a gun-wielding type, but I locked them in there and have one of my friends coming over to kill the bastards.  I couldn't let the duck suffer anymore because it was just flopping around on the ground. So I ended up having to break its neck. And the ducks are more like pets, and I'm an animal person, so I ended up tearing up because I hated doing that.   Fuck this morning. It ducking sucked.   On the bright side, I leave for vacation to Wyoming tomorrow. Pretty stoked about that."

He said that it would actually help smooth it out a bit. I tried it today, and I think he was right. It felt smoother than the last time I used it sans shim, and blade gap was still manageable. It provided me a BBS shave with minimal irritation. I think I'll switch between shimming it and not for the next few uses to really get a feel for the difference.  The cream was mildly disappointing. I had only used it twice since I got it, so I brought it out today. It didn't feel slick to me, and the scent was barely noticeable.

I shaved with my Pre-War Gillette Tech (Triangle Tech) this morning and I am absolutely convinced that Gillette must have designed the geometry of these heads to minimize the range of angle that can engage the blade and most of that range is a good place to be conducting my business. I look at that as a very good thing as long as someone can restrain themselves and not compensate with more pressure and evidently I can;-). The relative ""mildness"" of this head does not at all stop it from allowing close shaves. What it does is strongly minimize the opportunity for irritation.  I bought an English Flat Bottom Tech on the bay and shaved with it for the first time yesterday. It is definitely more ""aggressive"" as advertised and engages the blade over a larger range of angles and part of that range is NOT a good place for me to be, hence more ""aggressive"". I'll have to take another shave(s) with this head to see if I can dial it in but it is definitely an ""edgier"" razor which made it considerably more difficult for me at least so far, to get that close, smooth, irritation free shave that I easily get with the Pre-War Tech above."

Great shave.  Standard kicked ass as usual.  3rd shave with this soap, and it's been very good all three shaves.  Lather is a liiiittle quick to dissipate - third pass is a little thin, but I could just load more.  I love the feel of this soap, though, and would want to try other scents by them.  Surprisingly, I'm not a fan of the tin.  I don't like the wide flat tins, even though they're easy to load in.  I prefer the aesthetic of the glass jars or even plastic tubs like maggards.    One thing I've been doing is going easy ATG.  I could use a little more pressure and really get it bbs for a longer period of time, but then I have to wait for the hairs to pop out of my skin again.  I've been lightening up a lot on the atg pass and the bbs feel doesn't last as long (I'm a night shaver, so it lasts until the next day, but only in the morning) but I can do it more often without irritation.  So there's some food for thought."

It's a relaxing scent that is ever so slightly sweet and floral. Performance was questionable until I added enough water. Then it became one of the most dense lathers I have ever experienced. Definitely on par with the performance of other artisanal offerings. Still amazed they wrote and sealed a big handwritten card for only ordering a couple samples.

I catch it when I first open the tub, like it's the lightest aromatics escaping, and then I get a little more depth.  But it's still in there.  So I tried lathering, and I'm still catching it.  Then I tried thinking of a temple, with incense, you know, maybe it's all in my head.  And maybe it is a little, but dammit now pickles is stuck in my head.

The weight is good, but I'm not crazy about the ""Ginger Swirl"" handle of the M1.  The extra weight coupled with the shallow knurling pattern doesn't lend well to shower shaving.  I haven't dropped it yet.  I can't wait for my Triad handles to come in.  I feel like they will change the experience a bit.    The Feather Artist Club Pro blade settled down some from the first shave, but it's still not as comfortable as my Treet DEs.  It's not a traumatic shave, but it's just not as smooth as I like.  I have the Mongoose Sampler from tryablade.com.  I think I will try the Kai Captain Titan Milds after I ""break-in"" the Feathers a few more times.  The real shining moment of this SOTD was the Dapper Dragon.  ""Festival"" has quickly become one of my favorite scents.  It is truly intoxicating.  I've reviewed Festival soap and Scale Polish before, so I won't belabor it here (original review can be seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/3b49dy/sotdreview_dapper_dragon_soaps_2015_summer_ltd/)  I'm not over-stating this.

Consider this my rain dance to get some storms that'll wash away all this humidity and bring back that beautiful upper 70s weather we were having earlier last week.  I feel somewhat like a broken record, but Catie's is damn good stuff. It's flying up my personal rankings on the back of great smells, ridiculous ease of use, and excellent performance. The one area it does lack in is post-shave, but on that I'm coming around to the idea that a good post-shave routine, not the soap, should be responsible for your post-shave feel. As a soap CB does everything you could ask for."
Wet_Shavers,3e1mta,crazindndude,2,Tue Jul 21 09:49:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with the bottom half. There are only about..3 or 4 soaps that allow me to not worry about any post shave routine MWF, Stroppe Shoppe, to a certain extent XPEC, and I Coloniali does a decent job as well. That is not to say that other soaps do a bad job with post shave at all Barrister and Mann and Mickey Lees post shave are great, but I feel like adding something makes it even better especially when the aftershave smells amazing too."
Wet_Shavers,3e1mta,silentisdeath,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:05:08 2015 UTC,"Certainly there is a gradient of post-shave performance. I'm just saying that a soap is a soap - it has its job and I don't think it should be docked points if it doesn't do someone else's job well. If it loads and lathers easily, is slick as snot, and provides a strong barrier on your skin, what else do you want?  Certainly there are soaps that do all of the above and have some good moisturizing, but in my book you get a max score for doing everything well that you're supposed to."

Wet_Shavers,3e1mta,crazindndude,4,Tue Jul 21 12:37:07 2015 UTC,"Didnt downvote you, but I do disagree plain and simple.  More and more soaps today are becoming better with post-shave, so you're now seeing a trend of post-shave being considered part of shave soap. If a soap can be superior in every possible, and yet still lacks very much so in that post-shave area, then it is not a good soap compared to others which can promise the same glide, protection, ease of lather and the added benefit of that post-shave feel, which are many.  In my opinion, MLS is very comparable to Catie's Bubbles. The significant difference? MLS actually has good post-shave. Therefore, MLS is automatically a better soap in my opinion"
Wet_Shavers,3e1mta,Banes_Pubes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:18 2015 UTC,"I can see where that could be a deal breaker, but for myself, post shave is almost a non contender. I have somewhat oily skin, so even shitty post shave dryness (I'm looking at you, MdC) doesn't bother me for more than a couple of minutes, probably because I  always use aftershave. Which in itself should make the post shave even worse since I prefer alcohol splashes. The only time any of that is an issue is in the winter, but again, I'm in El Paso, so winter lasts all of three days. But for that, I have balms. I think it just depends on a person's skin type and geographic region. The heat here automatically makes my skin treat itself for dryness, so while post shave is a nice bonus, it doesn't really affect my assessment of a soap."
Wet_Shavers,3e1mta,MrTooNiceGuy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but the way I see it, if I'm going to be using a balm or moisturizer regardless (IMO the definitive post-shave treatment), then the post-shave qualities conferred by the soap are not practically meaningful. I certainly notice good post-shaves (MLS is very good in this department) but in my use case the soap would have to provide balm-level results so that I could actually remove my normal post-shave routine entirely.  Hope that makes sense and thanks for voicing your disagreement!"
Wet_Shavers,3e1mta,crazindndude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:22:55 2015 UTC,I get what you're saying. I guess I just use soaps that provide that post-shave feel and dont look to aftershaves for that. I just use them for the added fragrances

Wet_Shavers,3e18aj,OnaBlueCloud,3,Tue Jul 21 14:36:52 2015 UTC,On the bathroom counter. I put a few of the denser brushes on a bookcase in my room to hopefully dry faster. Not sure if there is any difference. You'll find most folks don't use brush stands.
Wet_Shavers,3e18aj,MrTooNiceGuy,2,Tue Jul 21 04:28:55 2015 UTC,Cool so there is no issue with letting them sit brush up to dry?
Wet_Shavers,3e18aj,TheSelfButcher,4,Tue Jul 21 04:36:47 2015 UTC,"Nope. Capillary action will take care of the drying for you. Just make sure you don't close your bathroom door if it's really humid and your brush should be okay. If you have an air conditioning vent that pushes air across where your brush sits, even better. Keeping the air constantly moving with help with drying."
Wet_Shavers,3e18aj,OnaBlueCloud,3,Tue Jul 21 04:42:18 2015 UTC,None whatsoever
Wet_Shavers,3e18aj,arbarnes,2,Tue Jul 21 04:41:15 2015 UTC,As long as you shake out the water stuck in the bristles (gently) before standing it up to dry it should be fine. My brushes usually take 24-48 hours to be completely dry...sometimes more for the densest ones. By completely dry I mean all the way to the inside/bottom of the knot.

Wet_Shavers,3dyr6c,arbarnes,2,Mon Jul 20 17:09:57 2015 UTC,"I keep a razor in the shower for shaving my head, while my wife keeps hers in the medicine cabinet. Sometimes she decides to shave after she's already in the shower, in which case she borrows mine.  The only downside is that a woman has a lot more surface area to shave. So after removing hair from legs, pits, etc., a blade is pretty much toast. My wife tries to remember to put a fresh one in when she's done, but there've been a couple of times when she forgot and I was unpleasantly surprised by a dull blade."

Wet_Shavers,3dyr6c,Kittycat-banana,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:30:00 2015 UTC,I shared a razor with my husband for a short while. All we did was each have our own blade because the slim chance we would contract something!
Wet_Shavers,3dyr6c,JohnSherlockHolmes,0,Mon Jul 20 21:16:26 2015 UTC,"Chances are pretty small that one of you has skin staph that the other doesn't have at this point, so necrotizing fasciitis  caused by cross contamination is a slim chance and would be one of the biggest worries (aside from hepatitis which again, a married couple would already likely share). Although there is a possibility of introducing foreign coliform bacteria into a facial cut, which would be... Bad. Although again, most married people share enough bacteria that even coprophagia doesn't cause a problem. It should however be considered a risk, even if a minor one.   The biggest issue as I see it would be a dull blade. Arm/leg/armpit hair is pretty soft and the skin is durable, but it's a huge surface area. Pubic hair is close to facial hair/skin but a relatively small area. Basically speaking if one partner shaves their whole body and then the other partner attempts to shave their face, they're gonna have a bad time. I've had it happen where a razor was used to remove body hair and I was unaware and had the fires of hell on my face after the initial stroke. I think it would be prudent to change the blade between partners, although this could get expensive. A cheap DE could be had and would probably be a better long term solution.   Tl;dr:   Sharing of the razor itself should be fine, but don't share the blade due to unlikely but horrible consequences, and super likely but just mildly terrible consequences. Long term I would have two (or more) razors."

It's a beautifully balanced take on lavender, warm and spicy and refined. It is in the same family as Lavanille, though softer and more soothing.

Wet_Shavers,3dy2zn,Sammy_Lee,8,Mon Jul 20 15:40:58 2015 UTC,"Two nice packages arrived for me this past week, a Joseph Rodgers 7-day set and a razor with some scales special to me.  The Pensylvania razor has an unremarkable blade but I was of course drawn to the scales and the gold detail.  It appears to be more of a griffon than a dragon but I still had to have it.  The razor was located in France and I actually had to convince the seller to ship it to me in the US, he didn't want to do international shipping at first.  It cost me almost as much in shipping charges as for the razor itself but luckily I was the only bidder so I got it for the starting price.  The Joseph Rodgers 7-day set is extremely nice, in very good condition.  All ivory scales with some splits including one broken piece that has been glued into place.  Very, very little rust and no chips on the blade; worst damage is the ""Thursday"" etched into the spine on one razor is just barely visible when held just right in the light.  The box has some very vibrant blue velvet lining on the inside and the brass plaque on the top is marked ""F Dawson 1903"".  The only detracting factor is there is no key.  A word of caution for anyone buying high dollar items off Ebay, be on the look out for shill accounts used to drive the price up at the end.  I actually won this Rodgers set the second time it was listed, not the first, because of some shill bidding.  I like many buyers try to snipe auctions at the last second so that other buyers don't decide to try and up their bids.  During the first listing I put in a high but not outrageous bid but was sniped at the last second.  I checked the bidding history and saw the winner was an account with something like a 3 feedback which made me quite suspicious.  Sure enough, a week later I had a Second Chance Offer to buy the set for my high bid because the winner hadn't paid.  I rechecked the bidding history and saw the third highest bidder was well below me and the shill account.  I made a counter-offer, higher than the third highest bid but well below my first bid.  The seller declined and relisted the item.  I won it for less than my counter-offer and much below my initial bid.  So the moral of the story is don't ever put in a ridiculously high bid to win something you really want so that ""no one else will possibly bid that high"" because there just might be a shill account used to drive the price up to whatever the seller wants."

I'm also using the GEM Junior all week, and I have two SE blades from tryablade.com, the PTFE coating and just the stainless steel.  The soap: I don't really like the scent in the tub. It's way better lathered. It kind of reminds me of 42, which is the petunia/geranium flowery scent I guess. It's just a good performance/feel as their other soaps.  The blade: This one works. The SE blades from the grocery store feel like I'm taking a cheese grater to the hair and ripping it out hair by hair. This PTFE coated one works as well as any of my DE blades. DFS.  The Razor: harder to use than the DEs. It's the shape, it's difficult to get right up under my nose. I was able to, and there wasn't any issue with any of the other facial bits.

I've probably partially rolled the edge stropping it, so I'm gonna have to get it honed up next time I have some free cash.  Did my touchups with the injector since I didn't want to risk any more irritation from the straight, and it was nearby and already loaded. Ended up pretty much completely BBS with no lasting irritation, which is nice.  Third use or so with the faux-Plisson brush, and it was nice again. I still prefer my actual Plisson brush, but this one is good too. Definitely glad that I got 2 of the knots. I tucked the other one away in my travel bag so I don't have to slum it with a subpar brush anymore :)"

The scent was also not to strong which is good since I have sensitive skin. The soap didn't bother my skin at all! The first pass wasn't bad, I had a little over a week's growth so there was a little drag but not bad(probably should've used a sharper blade or more aggressive razor). The second pass really showed how the soap works. It was super slick and I could barely feel the blade against my skin. My razor glided like it was butter. The post shave is awesome. My skin felt well conditioned and super soft. My chin was a little rough but that was my fault, I went over the bottom to much...oh well good thing for alum feed back haha.

I had a tin of the propaganda that I sent to /u/star_kicker because it was clumpier than the hydra and not worth the pain of getting a lather from it for me.

Post: MLS Grand Havana splash Bonus drink for later:  Cuba Libre   ...aaaaaand I'm back!  Had a great weekend with the wife on our little trip.  Pretty wiped out today, but it's back to work as usual.  When I got back home, my Grand Havana order was waiting on me.  Luckily it survived the weekend heat sitting in the mailbox.  Honestly, when I popped open the tub, I was expecting something with a more dark, sweet, slightly spicy smell - like sticking your nose in a jar of pipe tobacco (a scent profile which, btw, I'd still like to see one of the artisans tackle).  Instead, I got a much fresher, brighter, greener scent.  It's hard to describe, but I'd say it's got a bit of a sharpness that's just shy of being a cologne type scent, and a fresh, bright, green smell that isn't quite a citrus, but comes kind of close.  I'd guess that's from the fact that it's ""tobacco leaf,"" according to the scent description.  Intrigued, I started lathering it up.  Almost as soon as I hit it with the brush, I got subtle background note of something a little dark and possibly leathery.  That might be the Black Tea per the scent description.  It lent the soap a nice dark undertone, but was light enough that it REALLY paired nicely with the fresher, greener smells.  This soap overall is scented pretty strongly too - there was no missing it as I continued through my 3.5 passes and touch ups.  Of course, if you've used MLS soap at all before you know it performed well.  I will say, though I've used a lot of MLS samples, this soap struck me as a little more thirsty than the others.  I may have overloaded, or my brush may have been a bit dry, but it felt like it took a little more effort to dial the lather in, and left my face feeling a bit drier between passes.  Once it was dialed in though, I got a smooth, comfortable shave as expected.  Last but not least I finished up with the Grand Havana splash.  This has a nice strong dose of the GH scent, and I'm sitting here still enjoying it a couple hours after my shave.  I had actually forgotten it was mentholated when I slapped it on, so the slow, icy burn was a bit of surprise - but a really nice one.  This was a really nice shave after 4 days of growth on my trip.  I think I'm gonna make the GH combo my daily driver for the next week or so to get a really good feel for it overall and see if I get anything else out of it, but so far I'm pretty happy with it, even if it wasn't quite as expected.

I do on the other hand use /u/Chiseledface Cryogen aftershave at least 4/7 shaves of the week because I love menthol in my aftershave and menthol is one of those scents that burns away cleanerr than most. That said, Icy Hot is always the scent that will come through first and foremost in any pure menthol offering; no if and or but about it. When I bust out a purely menthol experience for the shave I could care less if it smelled floral, citrus, or woody; gimme dat cold burning sensation that kills my cheeks but livens my loins.

Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,TAC_,2,Sun Jul 19 11:47:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a die-hard French Press brewer. Do I need a Chemex, or is it just a glorified drip brewer?"
Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,NeedsMoreMenthol,4,Sun Jul 19 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"Do you need one? Depends.  A French press creates a very full bodied cup of coffee because of the oils that remain from the beans. It has a metal mesh filter so none of the oils are removed from the coffee. I find that French press brings out the earthy flavor profile in a bean. (I'm equally bad at describing things coffee related as I am with shaving smells)  With a chemex you'll be at the other end of the spectrum. Because of how thick the paper filter is you're removing nearly all the oils in a bean. I've found this brings out the ""sweeter"" flavors. It draws comparison to drip brewers because in essence a drip brewer is a pourover. The difference here is that you have a cone shape to concentrate the flow of water and you have control over the water temp.   A chemex is far easier to clean than the French press, it's just toss and rinse. Of course if you desire a fuller bodied cup you could elect to get the Able filter or one of the similar mesh filters. Likewise you could create a cleaner cup in a French press by using a cloth or wrapping the strainer in a couple paper filters. Also a chemex is aestheticly pleasing and easy to travel with.   So do you need one? Probably not, but I like having dedicated brewers for my desired cup profile I feel like having."
Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,TAC_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:47:26 2015 UTC,"Also a chemex is aestheticly pleasing and easy to travel with.   Not to say a French press is any less beautiful or rugged enough for travel.  I have one of the latter - a Planetary Design double-walled stainless steel press. Comes in several sizes (20, 32, 48oz) and they also make a travel mug that fits in car cupholders. I agree with literally everything else you said, but the thought of an Erlenmeyer flask on my breakfast counter being prettier than one of these irked me."

Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,crazindndude,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:05:36 2015 UTC,"Haha my bad if it read that way. I meant it is also aestheticly pleasing. I do agree that French presses are gorgeous.  For travel I just take my chemex everywhere. It's a one piece pourover so cleanup is a breeze and I've taken it across borders multiple times with no issues.. I think I've just worked out a system for travel with the Chemex, so I may be completely biased."
Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,TAC_,2,Sun Jul 19 18:34:35 2015 UTC,"Between you and /u/chevro1et, any chemex you would specifically recommend?"
Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,Banes_Pubes,2,Sun Jul 19 21:29:03 2015 UTC,It just depends on how much coffee you want to brew. The 6-cup size is a little more versatile in that you have the extra capacity if so desired. I think the 6-cup filters may be slightly more expensive but that's because they are larger.   I was gifted a 3-cup and a box of filters from my local roaster when he retired and closed his shop. It makes one large mug of coffee.
Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,chevro1et,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:58:50 2015 UTC,"I've got the 6 cup and agree with /u/chevro1et, it is incredibly versatile. Typically I brew for more than just myself (wife or those freeloading coworkers of mine) and I max out at about 3 average sized mugs. The most common, or most recommended, mesh filter is designed for the 6 cup. I've also thrown in a cloth filter just to give that a try. When it's just me I drink a liter of coffee anyways so more is usually better.   So I would recommend the 6 cup, ""Classic Series"" model. I'm terrified of breaking the glass handle ones and the wood sleeve one has stood up to regular use for about 4 years now, and still going strong."
Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,TAC_,2,Mon Jul 20 00:07:19 2015 UTC,"So do you need one? Probably not, but I like having dedicated brewers for my desired cup profile I feel like having.

Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,MrTooNiceGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 20:10:09 2015 UTC,"If you get a chemex, you pretty much need to have a gooseneck kettle and a grinder capable of producing a nice, consistent coarse grind as well. That being said, I really do enjoy my chemex."
Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,chevro1et,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:20:43 2015 UTC,Oh no! More neat stuff to buy!
Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,MrTooNiceGuy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:57:16 2015 UTC,"A good grinder is a must. But I feel like that goes for any brew method. As far as a kettle... I get away with using a shitty one at work and just saturate the grinds, go for extraction time. Works pretty well.   But a gooseneck is so pretty."
Wet_Shavers,3dtd2q,TAC_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:16:43 2015 UTC,I really feel like there should be more emphasis placed on a good grinder. You can easily ruin a perfectly roasted bean with inconsistent extraction due to a crappy grind.

I will try a silly long lathering with a triple milled soap and see if that helps but Fuck Boar brushes."
Wet_Shavers,3dtab0,I_Like_a_Clean_Bowl,6,Sun Jul 19 10:04:18 2015 UTC,"I have a semogue 620 that I have been trying to break in for the last 3 months   I have the Semogue 620, 610 and SOC Boar. All broke in, all took some time, all are now great brushes.  The technique you are using for break in is different that the one I have used on all of my Semogues and Omegas. In order to get splits the knot must completely dry out and that takes more than one day for me so my ""test lathers"" of several minutes were done on a two day basis. In addition, Semogue uses different ""mixtures"" in their knots and while the 610 and SOC have slightly different Premium(?) 90% tops the 620 has Extra 75% tops and you cannot expect the 620 to break in at the same rate as the first two or to wind up being the same brush because it isn't supposed to be. The 620 is intended to be scrubbier though not scritchy and to have more backbone. It took about 25 test lathers on a two day interval for me to start using it for shaving and at 50 lathers it is a very good brush. It will never be quite as soft as the 610 or SOC on the face and it shouldn't be. It will also never be anywhere as soft as a silvertip badger or a modern synthetic. What it will become is an excellent, scrubby but not scritchy face lathering brush with good backbone to load and lather that has many fans precisely because of these traits.  The general feeling about Omegas is that they are easier to break in and some are even satisfied with their performance right out of the box. That is not my experience but at 20 test lathers both my 10049 and 31064 were already where the Semogues were at 40 lathers."
Wet_Shavers,3dtab0,nick47H,2,Sun Jul 19 10:30:55 2015 UTC,I am not as refined as most members of this sub. I had been using a L'Occitane Plisson for awhile...love it. But three weeks ago I picked up an Omega 10049. I have used it everyday since getting except one. I use it exclusively as a face latherer. I really like this inexpensive brush. But as I said I'm unrefined.

Wet_Shavers,3dtab0,russkhan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:01:00 2015 UTC,"Same here - Omega 49, exclusively face-lather.  The brush was wonderful right out of the box for me, and it has been getting better ever since.  I did no de-funking or palm lathering or any of the things OP mentioned prior to first use.  I just rinsed it a little bit after taking it out of the box and used it as usual.  The brush worked like a champion on day #1 itself -- plenty of useful lather for three full passes, and I did not even use a fancy soap -- it was Van der Hagen (I don't recall if it was Deluxe or Glycerin) Edit: Glycerin.  I have a Semogue 1305 on the way.  I wonder how it will compare, once I have it broken in."
Wet_Shavers,3dtab0,I_Like_a_Clean_Bowl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:41 2015 UTC,I actually did a practice lather straight out of the box because I couldn't wait until it was time to shave. That's the only breakin ritual I performed. For ten bucks it's a pretty damn good value.
Wet_Shavers,3dtab0,justateburrito,0,Sun Jul 19 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"I was doing the 2 day interval for the first 2 months of owning it, and now have gone onto a faster rountine as I had no joy with it.   lather generation is terrible even with easy lathering soaps like Arko and TOBS cream, and the lather dissipates to nothing on the second pass and I have to go back to the product on the second and third passes.  Everyone has there own methods and no-one seems to agree, this was a brush that was highly recommended for a starter brush, luckily I have a second brush I can use as if this was my first brush I would have cut my losses long ago.  Reason I stopped the 2 day interval was I was recommended that it was way to long and if I dried the bristles on a towel I could cut the drying time down to 6-8 hours.  Buying a Muhle SST next month if this isn't broken in by then."
Wet_Shavers,3dtab0,nick47H,2,Sun Jul 19 10:48:42 2015 UTC,"lather generation is terrible even with easy lathering soaps like Arko and TOBS cream, and the lather dissipates to nothing on the second pass and I have to go back to the product on the second and third passes.   Well, there it is. If the lather dissipates there isn't enough soap loaded. Boars, badgers, horses, synthetics all behave differently and require somewhat different techniques.  As /u/justateburrito comments further on your soap to water ratio is probably off, maybe by a lot. Plus Arko soap and TOBS cream couldn't be more dissimilar in soap/water requirements. If I were you I would just stick to the Arko soap for awhile. I would only shake out the brush once or twice, no ""wringing"" necessary, and load the brush until I had a substantial proto-lather without visible bubbles. Then I would start to dribble a few drops of water at a time into the knot core while I lathered my palm. I find that if I have created a proper proto-lather I still have to dribble in water two or three times. Keep brushing, some times circles, some times stropping motions until the lather blooms.  Your 620 might already be broken in due to your hard work."
Wet_Shavers,3dtab0,justateburrito,0,Sun Jul 19 15:15:08 2015 UTC,"This is what is infuriating, 2 months ago I got told that not holding a lather and dissipating is a sign of a non broken in brush.  Tobs is one of the easiest to lather and I know what I am doing with that I lather with a semi wet brush and add water as needed to stop it being pastey but it will fade to nothing way before being over saturated.  This will happen with Nanny's, ToBS, Arko, LPL or Pretty much anything doesn't matter if I lather for load for 15 or 45 seconds ( hard soap ofc ) or even if I add more product than normal.  I use the method that Michael Freedberg talks about on his youTube channel by just dribbling a little water in at a time.  Think it is time for a new brush, am currently using a body shop synthetic which I have read/watched reviews on and everyone says it is horrible but it way out performs the semogue in every category, Muhle Silvertip Fibre Shaving-brush 33K252 here I come.  Thanks for the advice it is appreciated but I am not convinced it is me and not the brush or I would have some joy in the months I have persevered with it."

If you know your skin is fine with fragrances in general, charge ahead; if you're unsure or if you've had skin reactions to anything in the past, you should at least test a new product by smearing some on the crease inside your elbow joint and letting it sit 10-20 minutes to see whether your own skin reacts. It's better than smearing some on your face and making it red and burning.   BTW, my favorite shaving for sensitive skin is Mystic Water Sensitive Skin (scroll down at the link -- you can see a complete list of ingredients in this post)."
Wet_Shavers,3drrvy,Leisureguy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:09:05 2015 UTC,"You should give us a little more detail. Did the TOBS soap irritate your skin? Do you know of anything that irritates your skin (some people are sensitive to lanolin, for example)?  For what it's worth, I don't have particularly sensitive skin, but TOBS Sandalwood lights my face up like a Christmas tree. The TOBS Jermyn Street shaving cream is made for sensitive skin, is inexpensive and widely available, and is very easy to lather for people new to wet shaving."
Wet_Shavers,3drrvy,aseriesoftubes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:13:56 2015 UTC,BTW to confirm you have a reaction (as opposed to shaving irritation) is wash one side of your face with the soap.

Wet_Shavers,3drrvy,AlwaysANewAddiction,9,Sat Jul 18 21:00:40 2015 UTC,"The term ""all natural"" is a bit of a fallacy. OP, there's no such thing as a ""best shaving soap for sensitive skin."" Everyone is allergic/sensitive to different things. You're likely sensitive to synthetic sandalwood (a common issue) and may be sensitive to coconut acid as well (a major ingredient in most British shaving creams). Have you tried any other products?"
Wet_Shavers,3drrvy,BostonPhotoTourist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:11:07 2015 UTC,"No. I just ordered everything yesterday.   Edwin Jagger Faux Ebony Double Edge Safety Razor, Black  Perfecto 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush With Black Handle-Engineered to deliver the Best Shave of Your Life!!! No Matter what method you use, Safety R  Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap in a Wooden Bowl, 3.5 oz.  I get financial aid, so if I'm looking for a cost effective way. Regular shaving screws up my skin. Drys the skin. Pimples happen. Bumps.   Cost me $67. Soap is 15 if it's refill. How long does the soap last me?  How should I judge the shaving soap and other stuff?"
Wet_Shavers,3drrvy,BostonPhotoTourist,11,Sat Jul 18 21:14:44 2015 UTC,"Alright, so a few things:  1) It sounds like you ordered on Amazon. I'd recommend refraining from doing that in the future and instead going with a reputable wet shaving vendor like Maggard Razors, ShaveRevolution, MenEssentials, Fig & York, etc. Better selection, better service, artisan offerings, etc.  2) I know that, for awhile, Taylor of Old Bond Street soap was regarded as being very poor, but I'm not sure if that's been rectified in recent times. Perhaps /u/kcbeemo or one of our better traveled contributors can clear that up. Regardless, I wouldn't classify Sandalwood as a fragrance suitable for sensitive skin; there are LOTS of people allergic to it, but the only way to find out if it will bother you is to actually put it on your face.  3) Assuming the soap works, it should last for several months. TOBS soap is triple milled, meaning that they grind it up and compress it under tremendous pressure in order to crush out all of the water and produce a harder soap. Triple-milled soaps are usually regarded as lasting longer, though there is some debate on the subject. That said, most decent shaving soaps will last you quite some time (which is why many of us are absolutely overloaded with the damn things), so you would probably be fine with an artisan soap as well, of which there are many budget-friendly options. Mickey Lee Soapworks, Chiseled Face Groomatorium, and Stirling Soap all come to mind.  3) You paid a lot of money for that kit. Not that there's anything wrong with what you bought (though I have a feeling that the Perfecto brush will be very scrubby and harsh, which is almost always the case with Pure badger brushes), but, next time, come ask us first. We can probably save you a fair amount of money and get you better stuff.  4) The shaving soap should give you a thick, creamy, slippery lather with a slight shine and the consistency of yogurt. /u/Mantic59 and /u/Cadinsor have both produced excellent videos that will teach you how to lather the soap properly (look for ShaveTutor and Michael Freedberg on YouTube).   5) It's very likely that you will not get a top-notch shave the first time around, owing largely to the fact that you don't sound like you've ever used a safety razor before and they can take a little getting used to. Don't be discouraged if you don't get a perfect shave the first time out. It takes a bit of practice, but it's worth it in the long run. There are lots of people here who are happy to help. Just ask us.  Edit: You may also want to check our wiki."

I suspect an ulcer or something and am going to the doc on Monday. I was playing with lather late and on a whim decided to shave instead of washing it all off.  The brush seemed a little bit better this time around. I did a palm lather with the soap and had a good amount rather quickly. I'm holding onto it for now, partly because I'm not sure of the value since they are no longer being made. There's a tiny bit of scritch and with painting strokes it is barely noticeable. I still had a little bit of trouble getting enough lather for the second pass and I should have gone back for more soap. I had a small, stubborn weeper on my neck and a little bit of irritation. I wonder as I get more used to the brush that I will have less trouble with lather lasting the entire shave. It's not a very densely packed 22mm (which may be a good thing as the scritch would probably be more pronounced).  The Weber performed as expected and I will have to try a few more shaves with Lab Blues to see if the lather/prep was the culprit for the subpar second pass. The Wave handle feels very well balanced and natural in my hand. Also, thanks to /u/EmptyAy for sending me some Lab Blues, GSB's and a sample of B&M Arctique.   I'm still trying to figure out good pairings for this soap. Lavanille seemed to go pretty well with the shared vanilla notes. In this case I chose something with alcohol in it intentionally to help close up the weeper that didn't want to go away."

I was curious if the lighter, shorter handle would affect things very much.

I will probably continue to use this combo and it makes me even more interested in getting the Delta Echo Razor Works treatment for this razor. The SSLE was excellent, of course, and I just dig the Via dell'Ambra scent. I think it's one of their best offerings in quite a while, and right up there with Baker St. in my opinion.

Wet_Shavers,3dq9xa,TAC_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:09:20 2015 UTC,"Do read my review of their Bamboo and White Grape original formula.  But for some extra info: - their scents can be a bit one-dimensional, which you can take as a good thing or bad thing. If you want lime, guess what, they have a lime scent that smells like, yep, lime. I tried the bamboo & white grape because it sounded quite different from the majority of the lineup. but sweet mother of god if that signature vanilla cream smell isn't the most decadent, buttery vanilla scent I don't know what is. - lather is high quality, but I don't like the olive oil recipes. I found the soap too soft and therefore too fussy to load, but they lathered well - signature scents are best value even at the higher cost. they lost for ages and the lather is just as strong. post is velvety. scent strength on those are quite robust.  Buy directly from Nanny's Silly Soap if you can, though. She'll get the money directly without the middle man, and shipping is dead cheap in the UK. If you're from outside the UK, worth getting in touch with her and checking if anything can be done about shipping price."

Wet_Shavers,3drdgq,IllegalMonk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:58:40 2015 UTC,I recently got this brush because I thought it looked cool and had some ebay bucks that were about to expire. I am planning to put a 2 band badger knot in it and use it as a travel brush. I am really just curious about how old it may be and maybe some history of the company. If you have any links or pictures of similar brushes with new knots that would be great too. Thanks.
Wet_Shavers,3drdgq,drivenlegend,2,Sat Jul 18 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"I've only had one similar come through my hands, didn't really like the shape so I ended up passing it along. Would definitely make a good travel brush though. Sorry I couldn't be of more help. If you have any questions about doing the actual restoration let me know though!"
Wet_Shavers,3drdgq,drivenlegend,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:08:54 2015 UTC,Actually I do. I am planning to put a double band badger knot in it once it get all cleaned up. I want to use it to face lather and heard that knot would have more backbone. Where would you recommend purchasing the knot? And what is a good range of loft to aim for. Im still unsure about sizes. This will be my first restoration.
Wet_Shavers,3drdgq,drivenlegend,4,Sat Jul 18 20:18:25 2015 UTC,"The TGN Finest is a favorite of mine. Good backbone, soft tips, inexpensive and readily available. Depending in what size knot you're going to need (20-22mm would be my guess) I will usually try to shoot for a 1:2 ratio for a face lathering brush. You probably won't get quite that though, a 40-42mm loft might be too short and too much backbone, you may have to play with it a bit. I restore a lot in the 24mm knot range and I usually try to hit 48-50mm. My best recommendation is to set it about where it looks and feels right using clear silicone, then try it. If it's not quite to your liking then you can pop it out and adjust accordingly. Once you are happy you can either stay the course with the silicone, or reglue with marine epoxy. Since its going to be a travel brush, you might check out a container for it as well. Running by your local pharmacy for an empty pill bottle works well, just drill some holes in it. That will also help you decide on your loft, wouldn't do much good if you set it but it won't fit into anything."

SEs are great - you need one. Buy any of the models that say 1912. They're the most common and IMHO the best.
Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,wet_shavers,14,Fri Jul 17 07:01:24 2015 UTC,"Beginner SOTD  Dedicated to /u/generalkinetics  GeneralKinetics doesn't mind newbies using VdH brushes or Arko soap because he hates ""copy-paste kits"" that defeat the point of wet-shaving. Remarkably, he has the idea that the only point of wet shaving is variety. He doesn't seem to understand that beginners don't know good variety from bad, and also that most people don't copy-paste advice but tailor it.    I bet that none of you have ever actually tried the Weishi razor and actually have real-world experience with it. You have no way to prove that anyway except with an SotD pic which I know you'd be too afraid to show to your mates that you're not using ""The right"" gear.   So I'm going to shave with some of my oldest gear and I only regret I got rid of the worst of it.   Razor: Lord L6 on different handle (threads stripped on original)   Blade: Polsilver Super Iridium   Soap: Proraso White (Col conk amber was my starter soap, no longer with me)   Brush: Vuflix Pure Badger   After: 444 Gel  This is medicore stuff. It's not different, it's worse. I continued using it as a beginner because I didn't know there was better value for money.   The razor is extremely mild and inefficient, it is what it is. Proraso white isn't a particularly good scent or performer. It works, but doesn't excel. Mickey Lee, Dapper Dragon, ChiseledFace all outperform it handily and with much better scents. Vulfix is super prickly, almost painful to use, I can't believe I thought this was a good brush.   So yeah. Some gear is better than others and you shouldn't encourage newbies to use shittier gear for some inexplicable crusade against using others' experience."

Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,IllegalMonk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:08:31 2015 UTC,"You didn't mention the quality of the shave. I get that it wasn't enjoyable but was it reasonably close? irritation free? You have the skills, did you make it work?  A newbie who is clueless about making a lather or shaving with a DE wouldn't be ill advised to start with a stick of Arko, an Omega or Semogue boar, a user grade vintage Gillette with a couple of 5 packs of blades and whatever aftershave they have been using. He(she) would struggle with the lather until the brush broke in a bit, struggle with angle and pressure for awhile but wouldn't have a single piece of kit that anybody should turn their nose up at. Its pretty much how the vast majority of the shaving world spent their shaving lives. Time for making this into a hobby later, if at all. And they could do it all for under $35.   Not a bad way for anyone to start out and I'll bet there are a lot of redditers who have pretty much done exactly that and haven't varied a whole lot since."
Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,I_Like_a_Clean_Bowl,3,Fri Jul 17 15:29:42 2015 UTC,"Ah, but you see that's exactly my point! I don't want or think people should start out with a Simpsons brush, Above The Tie razor and Martin de Candre soap. But they also shouldn't start with cheap and bad gear when there is cheap and good gear out there.  Giving advice is pretty essential - rather than letting people go on some sort of exploratory quest for its the ""point of wet-shaving"" and wasting money in the process.  What I'm saying is a beginner should start with a quality boar or synth instead of a cheap badger (which I've rediscovered to my peril today, hard to relather after first pass bc prickly). Same cost better value.  Same deal with the razor. This one was so mild I needed a tiny bit of pressure, or else four passes. Parker razor is the typical suggestion, but I haven't tried it personally so I tend to recommend the Gillette Tech if I make a recommendation at all, mild but at least it can last.  Soap isn't a huge cost differential per shave until you get into the really premium territory.  The guy was getting upset over people suggesting tried and true kits, and was supporting the VdH kit because ""variety"" and he's not a ""copy-paster"". Its OK, but why suggest that when you can do better. Develop a baseline if you want to make it a hobby, or just keep the kit and be happy with it.  I'm not against cheap kits, I'm against bad kits."

I love it on a hot day even though it does wear a bit heavy again because of the general boosyness of it. I have one more coming probably today or tomorrow I got off /r/fragsplit which will be Sova"
Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,silentisdeath,2,Fri Jul 17 08:18:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry, full bottle. Never tried P&O, but had a sample of Sova. Rotting hay is not my kind of jazz, I wonder if you're gonna like it, let me know. I can recommend Ore though - very realistic cocoa + wood. Cheers!"
Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,bfdr,2,Fri Jul 17 08:25:08 2015 UTC,I really want to try all of them. I may just buy all the samples of Luckyscent and wear one everyday for a week. Have you tried any of the Nasomatto frag? Black Afgano Hindu grass etc?
Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,silentisdeath,2,Fri Jul 17 08:26:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've tried a few. Black Afgano is absolutely amazing, Pardon is pretty nice as well. Didn't like Blamage though."

Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,Banes_Pubes,3,Fri Jul 17 17:22:33 2015 UTC,"So far, I've tried five Slumberhouse frags. Norne, Ore, Jeke, Kiste and Sova. In my humble opinion, most of the fragrances from this house are not crowdpleasers and are difficult to wear, but they provide an amazing olfactory journey. (with enormous longevity and strong sillage - extraits) Here are my 2 cents:   Norne - basically a burning Norwegian forest, very realistic and very intense fir, personally I would love it on a freezing cold day in December Ore - cocoa mixed with wood. Mind you, this doesn't smell like chocolate, more so cocoa powder on a wooden plank, I enjoyed it, but cannot imagine myself wearing this very often Jeke - very smoky, balsamic scent, like tobacco dipped in honey that lasts for a small eternity, quite enjoyable though Kiste - peach. Peach. Some more peach. I found this scent the most monotonous of them all. Very sweet, borderline cloying.  Some tobacco here and there, but mostly, yeah, you guessed it. Peach. Sova - Rotting hay on a warm day, mixed with vegetable notes (just my impression, of course). Did not enjoy this one, but some people love it. It's a sillage and longevity monster, as all the extraits from Slumberhouse are.   Long story short, not a blind-buy material, but some of these frags are really something. Paging /u/silentisdeath for more input."
Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,bfdr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can only speak about Norne and Sova, I think Sova will grow on me but it will take a good amount of trying to find a time and place for it. Norne I wore to work last night and while it did feel a bit out of place, its an incredible frag"
Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,silentisdeath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:11:39 2015 UTC,"so I actually just point on Sova about...10-15 minutes ago, and I really don't know if I like it. Sova smells like a boozy raisin and I'm not sure that's a good thing. My first one was Pear and Olive and I really like it a lot its one of my favorite frags in my little cabinet. Norne smells like a burning christmas tree, its extremely compelling and in every way interesting. I would DEF. buy samples before jumping for a full bottle because I can see these being subjective in every way."
Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,silentisdeath,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:26:58 2015 UTC,Sounds like I've got an order to make. Is Norne a little heavy for this weather?  Any that you've been meaning to try still?

It's as smooth and comfortable as everyone says. When I first got the razor, I started with Feather Hi-Stainless blades, which is a combination a lot of people rave about. While the combo of the Feather blade with the AS-D2 is one of the better combinations I've tried using a Feather blade, it still had some of the characteristic harshness that I always feel with Feathers. I'm now on my second blade with this razor, one of my favorites, Polsilver SIs. This is a much more comfortable blade than the Feathers and I've noticed I'm getting better than usual longevity. Normally I only use a blade 3-4 times, but I'm on shave 7 and it was still very usable. I'm on lather number 14 with the SOC brush. Around shave #12, I felt that the brush finally made the first turn where it becomes usable. I know it can take up to 45 lathers to really break in the brush, so it's still got a long way to go; however, I see a lot of potential in this brush. I've been bowl lathering this brush so far to avoid the stiffness of the bristles and lather capacity issues while it's still breaking in. Also loving the Neumann's aftershave. Most Neumann aftershaves don't have menthol, but I've taken 1 oz of it, added 1% menthol, and put it in a glass bottle with sprayer. I probably put in a bit more menthol than I'd prefer since the initial menthol hit is pretty intense.

While the S1 was extremely comfortable, it was also very inefficient for me. I'm actually finding the AS-D2 to be more efficient than the S1. I still have the ATT R1 head which I'll probably sell once I get my Wolfman. While the R1 is a very good razor, it's not as comfortable or smooth as many of my other razors.

Interesting thoughts about comfort and smoothness. I think the Feather is super comfortable and smooth, so maybe it's not a great idea after all. I also love the audible feedback that my Mission gives, and that's something the Feather doesn't really do. I may just have to buy one and try it, but I really can't be laying out that kind of money at the moment."

Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,Gaidin23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:00:40 2015 UTC,"one of my favorites, Polsilver SIs. This is a much more comfortable blade than the Feathers and I've noticed I'm getting better than usual longevity. Normally I only use a blade 3-4 times, but I'm on shave 7 and it was still very usable.   I had my seventh shave with the same Polsilver SI in my Steampunk Pre-War Gillette Triangle Tech this morning too. The blade seems as smooth and efficient as ever. I usually change out at 5 shaves with the Polsilver SI because I start feeling something degrading but not with this razor. Every shave is a perfect shave, near BBS and NO irritation at all. I am going to continue to use this blade for awhile and see how long it remains this way. Hear that /u/NeedsMoreMenthol, wherever you are?;-)  The Feather AS-D2 is supposed to be modeled after the Gillette Techs which might explain their seemingly similar blade usage but I have no personal knowledge of the Feather. If anybody knows something definitive about this please weigh in."

These blades impress me so far, and this Tech shaves way better than any Tech I own.  Feathers are very harsh for me. I don't know if it's because they have an edge that's so thin it's deformed from the factory, but I'll try to figure it out as it's the next blade on deck after the PolSilver."

Any other razor and I will take a day off after 4 or 5 shaves and I use the Polsilver SI in everything. I have no need to do so with this razor as there seemingly is no cumulative irritation. Either I have finally learned how to use a razor properly (always a possibility) or this razor is making shaving a lot easier for me. I have never used a Feather. I'll wait to see how you do before trying one. I mean...why should both of us suffer?:-)  I am still waiting for my English Flat Bottom Tech to arrive (thank you enabler) on its very slow boat across the Atlantic Ocean and then I can compare the two Techs."
Wet_Shavers,3dllw6,I_Like_a_Clean_Bowl,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:14:16 2015 UTC,"I would certainly encourage a little blade exploration with every razor you try. As I'm sure you know, Feathers have an irrational hype surrounding them, so it's best to find out for yourself if that is indeed the best combination for you. However, I've read the same claims, which is why I started with that combination. Feathers usually don't work great for me. The first shave is harsh, the second shave is best, but then the shaves quickly deteriorate and the blade is uncomfortable again after 3 shaves. While the AS-D2 did make the Feather feel a little better than it does in most other razors I've tried, I still felt a bit of harshness. If you're experiencing a little harshness too, try a few other blades. There are plenty of other blades out there that are as sharp as Feathers but much smoother."

We have a ton of stuff going on in our lives and our friends and family are amazing. Granted I will probably be kicking people out of my house so I can try to enjoy a little peace and quiet
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,songwind,12,Thu Jul 16 16:41:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah, I'm also cutting out soda entirely. Going okay so far."
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,thefrencharmy,8,Thu Jul 16 13:41:24 2015 UTC,Carbonated water is a good substitute if you miss the carbonation
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,vacaloca,2,Thu Jul 16 16:50:34 2015 UTC,I have been doing this for a month!! Keep at it man!! Just club soda with lime in case I crave some soda.  I've lost a few inches.....of my waist. ... Gained some elsewhere.  Dude!! You can do it!!!
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,outfromtheashes,3,Thu Jul 16 20:30:11 2015 UTC,I think I saw an ad for this on PornHub.

We make them here all the time to avoid getting sodas. Very refreshing, and good if you like carbonated things still.  For a bonus you can always throw in a shot of gin, too!"
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,Old_Hiker,2,Thu Jul 16 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"Did the same thing awhile ago. Cutting out the energy drinks was definitely the hardest, especially being on the flightline. I ended up switching to black coffee. Hot, cold, lukewarm... As long as the quality of coffee is good enough you'll never look back. Good luck with the transition!"
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,russkhan,2,Thu Jul 16 16:46:01 2015 UTC,Another flightline guy here and I think the AF should be sponsored by every major energy drink. I can only imagine how many gallons a day is put away by maintainers.  It's staggering.
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,chevro1et,2,Thu Jul 16 17:29:11 2015 UTC,You'll get used to it in a short period of time. Then you'll get to the point when carbonated drinks just don't appeal to you.
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,chevro1et,2,Fri Jul 17 02:29:52 2015 UTC,Good move! I did it as a by product of quitting HFCS a few years ago. Recommend it highly.

All you have to do is hold up your young child, and they hand you 3 passes good to basically cut the line for the ride. It's meant for parents to be able to swap out riding with kids too small to go on, but anyone can use them."

Full carbon jobs, electric gears, and so much more. It was crazy. I mean easily over 100 participants so if you average even a low ball $1000 per, but some were def over $5000per.  Just ridiculous to see a lot full of them."

Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,MrTooNiceGuy,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:17 2015 UTC,"This is my first one. I did sign up for an Olympic Sprint first. But everyone was telling that the Olympic isn't the best idea for my first one. So I switched to a sprint triathlon. It's a half mile swim, then 13 mile bike, finish with a 5k. The Olympic Sprint would have been double that. Ima do a few sprints. Then jump up to Olympic when I get a few under my belt."
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,redrivet,2,Thu Jul 16 18:59:08 2015 UTC,"Good luck with it. A sprint is the way to begin, said from experience. A half mile swim is no joke, I've done Olympic distance that only had a half mile swim. If the bug bites you like the wet shaving one might have, the cash layout for middle to upper tier tri gear will put stainless steel razors to shame."

In two antique stores I've had three encounters that boggles my mind. The first one was a cute little shop keep responding to me when I asked if they had any shaving things (in an antique store mind you) she responded that I should just go to Walmart. No this wasn't a sarcastic or quip on her end, she was serious. Then I asked the manager cause the girl ended up not really knowing (this was a two story massive place so I don't blame her) and while showing me around the manager asked me why I was dressed the way I was.... Like she'd never seen a full faced helmet before that I was carrying, but maybe that was just cause most people here use no helmet or are typical Harley attire. Still, funny to say the least.  The last encounter was the most interesting. I walk into an antique store right off a major highway and it was good size so I was hopeful. Get in the guy says no no Straight razors they were all sold already, I have a guy who comes by every week checking (if it's you reading this... Fuck you) he says they have other things like DE razors and straps for strapping. (Yes strap). I look around and there is nothing I need so I say thanks and start to leave and then he starts asking about my bike and stuff and where I'm from. So I'm being talkative and he says from left field ""yeahhhh a few drag friends I have use straight razors for defense cause of how sharp they are."" So there we go guys. Now you know what to use to defend yourself with... I guess. More effective than mace, knives, tazers, and guns."

Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,ItchyPooter,4,Fri Jul 17 03:55:31 2015 UTC,"Heading down to DFW this weekend for my wife's cousin's wedding. The girl he's marrying decided on an outside wedding, in July, in Texas, in the afternoon. So there's that. Not much in the way of wet shaving supplies down that way that I've found, but lots of good local coffee roasters so all is not lost! In other news, my weight loss continues. I've not really done anything other than limiting beer/alcohol (some), eating less and adding vegetables to nearly everything, and a quick routine of push ups/sit ups/squats every morning. Takes less than 10 minutes and wakes me up better than anything else!"
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,drivenlegend,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:37:38 2015 UTC,That's brutal. I wouldn't even go (to the wedding).
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,ItchyPooter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:46:22 2015 UTC,I floated the idea... No go. Luckily its casual so I'm just planning on a light button up shirt or something.
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,TAC_,2,Thu Jul 16 13:57:37 2015 UTC,Buy some spray antiperspirant and coat yourself in it.

Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,NuclearArmedBarbies,3,Thu Jul 16 14:25:51 2015 UTC,"Love that book. Have you heard of HPMOR? It's a really awesome Harry Potter fan fic (I know I know) where the premise is basically, what if Harry was a prodigy like Ender and also what if the world of magic made a lot more sense than it does? I'm reading it now and it's awesome"
Wet_Shavers,3dhy68,reddwarf666,2,Thu Jul 16 15:48:05 2015 UTC,"Cool.    I pitched Ender's Game to him by asking if he would be interested in a story about a guy his age, who had to play computer games...in space?  Personally I thought the ending got a bit weird.   Anyway I'm eager to hear how he likes it.  My dad bought hundreds of science fiction books so I've read a lot and I can point him towards more books."

Hard decision though as I'm at 9.5yrs and I was talking with the  wife about possibly getting out before breaking that 10yr mark.    I suppose here's to another 10yrs? Haha

Just genuinely curious and want to hear everyone’s opinion."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Banes_Pubes,20,Wed Jul 15 16:31:24 2015 UTC,We've been wanting to do a W_S custom soap for a while now. We intended to do one this month as it's the subs birth month but family stuff caused us to pull the breaks on it.

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,chuckfalzone,2,Wed Jul 15 17:49:15 2015 UTC,"Yup! That's exactly what it was. Although I'd be ok going through the process a little differently. Im ok with the artisan having total creative control over this, rather than us choosing the scent and name"
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Banes_Pubes,3,Wed Jul 15 17:50:54 2015 UTC,"I'm in the other camp, I suppose. I'd prefer to offer suggestions and be part of the process."

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,uncle_dubya,4,Wed Jul 15 17:02:02 2015 UTC,I know /u/j-mt mentioned he was working on a limited inspired by community members (I remember because I jokingly said it's bradford pear trees).
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,chill31613,4,Wed Jul 15 17:49:24 2015 UTC,That project is more for fun than anything else. It's also backseat to normal production.
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,j-mt,3,Wed Jul 15 18:49:19 2015 UTC,"I guess I must have missed that. But I guess what this and other comments have brought up, that if we go ahead with this and with the mods approval of course, how would we go about it?  Would a certain group of people work behind closed doors and leave the decision of the product and its specifications up to them and the artisan theyre working with (like TSN does) or have it be in our total control with the help from the mods, like the Myrkvidr process?"
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Banes_Pubes,2,Wed Jul 15 17:54:09 2015 UTC,"I wasn't around for the LASSCo release and I might've done that ""vote for the special ingredient"" poll for the TSN SV soap (but forgot what I voted for) ... but I either way - I'm down and put my faith in the artisans active in the community and the mods with whatever direction this can go."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,chill31613,3,Wed Jul 15 18:13:30 2015 UTC,As am I. I think it's exciting to see what they come up with on their own. And it's a nice surprise when they do the huge reveal before the release!
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Banes_Pubes,3,Wed Jul 15 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"If there were several artisans willing to do this, it could be several years before each one got to make something for the community. Could we find out who would be interested, and do like a seasonal series? And people could sign up so the artisans knew how much to make? If there were 4 artisans interested, each could take a season and produce a soap for that season for the sub?  Edit: or if we had 12 companies interested, each could take a zodiac symbol!!!"
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,aesopsgato,3,Wed Jul 15 19:39:09 2015 UTC,"Waaaaaaaat. The nerd in me loves the Zodiac idea but I dont know how practical it is / whether anyone would actually be interested in doing it.   BUT, I do love your seasonal idea. Again, I don't know how much the artisans would be ok with it but it has my vote."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Banes_Pubes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:46:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I bet it could really mess with supply schedules, but they would be guaranteed to sell all of it."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,aesopsgato,3,Wed Jul 15 19:48:22 2015 UTC,"Sounds like fun.  Just dont put ""Reddit"" on it or it'll be a real hassle."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,hedgehogsinhats,2,Wed Jul 15 19:48:30 2015 UTC,I'd be down. I don't have the money for luxury high end stuff but I wouldn't be opposed even if I couldn't afford it.
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,reytheist,2,Wed Jul 15 16:39:33 2015 UTC,"Late comment, but yesterday was busy.  Since I don't really participate in any shaving forums (time mainly) I'd definitely enjoy something like this."

Thought it looked nice and I would put my new Old Spice in to it. I'm an idiot and didn't realize it was full until I got home. I think its the original version. Smells a bit different then mine but the still kind of the same. It looked nice and clean when I poured a little out. Ok to use?

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Huckleberryking,2,Wed Jul 15 18:36:44 2015 UTC,Only cost $3   Ouuuuch!!!!!!!!!  I used Original Old Spice from the time I started shaving which was in the early 60's and used it almost exclusively until a couple of years ago. Whenever they changed the formulation I could no longer stand it and switched to Old Spice Fresh.

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Huckleberryking,3,Thu Jul 16 20:23:57 2015 UTC,Shavemac two-band fan knot vs Aretesenia Romera Manchurian fan knot vs Thater two-band fan knot. Any thoughts on this dilemma? Thinking around 26mm x 50-ish. Help me help you me.
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,hawns,2,Wed Jul 15 16:23:52 2015 UTC,"I've not used the Aretesenia Romera Manchurian fan knot, but the Shavemac D01 was the scritchiest knot I've ever used.  I traded it to another redditor who thought the same thing who then traded it to a third party.  So, I'd try the other knot, whatever it is."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,chiseledface,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:19:18 2015 UTC,"I've heard the same thing about the D01, as well. They also have another one that they call two-band silvertip that I'm curious about. I've seen a couple good things about it, but not enough to make me not feel still feel apprehensive."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,hawns,3,Wed Jul 15 17:32:03 2015 UTC,/u/explodyii has very high praise for the two-band silvertip. I'm saving up for one for my next brush right now.

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,hawns,2,Wed Jul 15 17:59:43 2015 UTC,I've heard great things about the 2-band
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Banes_Pubes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:00:41 2015 UTC,"Based on a couple reviews I found, it sounds like it could be my favorite. But I also wondered if my bias came from it being more readily available than the Romera and cheaper than the Thater."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,hawns,3,Wed Jul 15 19:36:03 2015 UTC,"No, I think I would lean towards it as well. I've never been fond of the Thäter handles, so this is nice because you can get a handle which you truly love. And although Romera makes beautiful brushes, his customer service is absolute shit (he's a nice guy, just never got the hang of it) and I dont know if his quality is back up to par.  I think the 2-band Shavemac is your safest and best bet right now, but that's just me!"

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,cakeerdeath,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:03:43 2015 UTC,The hesitation I have about Thater is that they seem to be all about the bulb knots. So I was wondering if the fan knots were kind of an afterthought for them.
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,hawns,3,Wed Jul 15 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"Purchased the 4125/1 2-band fan from Thater a couple of weeks ago.  Could not be happier.  Plenty of backbone, hooked tips, and holds so much lather its ridiculous.  The fan shape feels larger than the 24mm it measure at, and I cannot get any scritch.  The handle is surprisingly comfortable for me.  I will disclose that this is my first premium badger brush."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,sunderka1987,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:40:49 2015 UTC,"Cool, it's good to hear from a fan guy. Definitely helpful!"

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,cakeerdeath,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, probably true. And if I do choose the Thater, it'll definitely be the 4125/2. I just worry if it'd be scrubby enough for me and if the loft would be too high. I like the 26 mm knot on my WSP Stubby Superfine, but the loft at 53 mm seems like more than enough. So the 55 mm loft of the Thater also kinda goes against it.  But, on the other hand, everyone talks about the Thater's backbone. So mark that in the plus column."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,hawns,2,Wed Jul 15 23:53:01 2015 UTC,"0 scritch, Thaters are delightfully soft."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,IllegalMonk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:08:40 2015 UTC,Is it so soft that it feels like it's not even there? I want it to be at least kind of massaging.
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,hawns,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:52:18 2015 UTC,No scritch or scrubby massage. Like rubbing a pillow on your face. You can feel it because it has backbone but doesn't have the massaging feel. When wet it feels like a Plisson.
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,IllegalMonk,2,Thu Jul 16 14:10:14 2015 UTC,I think the backbone is meant for the 2-bands and the bulbs. Idk how the fan shape holds up though.. Maybe someone with a Thater fan could chime in?
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,cakeerdeath,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:30:10 2015 UTC,Nassrasur in Germany offers customization of Thater brushes. They could probably get you a fan knot in the handle of your choice.

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,unbrownloco,3,Wed Jul 15 21:48:20 2015 UTC,"Gun oil is apparently terrible, forgot why. Use mineral oil like baby oil."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Nolr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:55:18 2015 UTC,"Depends on the gun oil. But some contain solvents that can remove gold wash and eat scales. If you go that route, proceed with caution. Me, I just use baby oil."

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,ch4rr3d,2,Fri Jul 17 03:23:41 2015 UTC,I was told to use mineral oil (baby oil). Hopefully one of the more learned SR users can pop in and say if thats okay or not.
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Kittycat-banana,2,Wed Jul 15 21:53:54 2015 UTC,"""Food grade"" mineral oil.  You can pick up a bottle that will last forever for like $4 for Walgreens or CVS or whatever you have by you.   It will probably be near the pharmacy section.  Alternatively, get a silicone-impregnated anti-rust sleeve from TSS or make one yourself and just make sure you get everything dry after the shave."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,kaesees,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:34:47 2015 UTC,Do you have to oil a sr? Thinking about getting one. And what do you just leave the oil on?
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,Potato-smash,2,Thu Jul 16 03:20:12 2015 UTC,"You shave, then dry it on a towel. Store it outside the bathroom with a coating of oil on it, dribble a drop or two and spread with a clean rag or tissue. Wipe the oil off before the next shave."

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,ch4rr3d,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:47:23 2015 UTC,You dry it and then throw a wipe down with an oiled rag to create a barrier against atmospheric moisture before storing it. It's just a bit of anti-rust/corrosion protection.
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,unbrownloco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"Baby oil works fine and is safe. WD40 works too, but it smells funny."

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,unbrownloco,2,Fri Jul 17 02:05:53 2015 UTC,"So I find razorock soaps quite difficult to lather for some weird reason. I load the hell out of them with a semi-wet brush and then face lather. For the first pass I get this abundance of Barbasol-like peaky but thin and soft lather, then for the second pass it settles into a thin but firm and glossy coat that I would call acceptable lather. What does that tell me? Am I loading too much? Adding too little water? Too much initial water in the brush? Thanks lads."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,thelazyarab,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:48:36 2015 UTC,Are there some other good sources of high quality knots besides TGN or WD? I'm hoping to find a larger Plisson like synth knot. Also going to grab a TGN Finest unless anyone might have another recommendation.

Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,hyperllama44,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"Soap makers, how/when do you add scents to the soaps that aren't from essential/fragrance oils? Is it just trial and error? For example, I'd like to add black tea to a soap for the scent.  Also, adding Shea butter and/or lanolin, do you put that in at the end like the glycerin?  I'm going to a shop today to buy the raw materials and I'm super keen to get soaping. I'll be basically using this recipe"
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,BungleBungleBungle,5,Thu Jul 16 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"That's a really good recipe. You should totally use that one. :p  In terms of shea butter, you can either add a small amount of that in at the end, or you can add it as another oil and calculate your lye accordingly and saponify it, whichever you prefer.  In terms of adding scents, it is a bit of trial and error. For the tea, I might just use black tea instead of plain water to mix with the lye, and see how that turns out. (I did this with beer for my Myrkvidr soap and with wine for my CCXIII soap, and they came out pretty well, although not precisely as originally intended. You'll have to see how tea reacts with lye scentwise and otherwise.) Alternately, you could add bergamot essential oil to give your soap a hint of Earl Grey.  You may have to order potassium hydroxide unless you've got a really good shop near you. Sodium hydroxide is more readily available, and makes a harder bar, but tends to be better for bath soap.  Holler if you have more questions.  Good luck!"
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,jbisinla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:28:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the reply! I've made my first batch following your recipe on the first page of the B&B thread, albeit with coconut oil and 3 tbsp of glycerine per pound of fats. I think it just needs a bit more time to cook to lower the alkinity a little more. If this turns out ok, I might look into lanolin and or Shea butter too. Perhaps one with a bit of sodium hydroxide too.  I'd like to do a black tea and lavender soap, which is why I was asking about that earlier. Still not sure if I'll keep this first batch scentless or put a bit of smells in...  I went to a soap/candle making shop to get the KOH, stearic acid, coconut oil, pH strips, etc today. The KOH in particular was hard to find haha. Thanks again!  Edit: forgot to ask a basic question, um, do you keep the slow cooker on low or high? I've kept mine on low as I figured it was safer than potentially getting it too hot and burning it. It's been cooking for like, 2 hours now..."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,BungleBungleBungle,2,Thu Jul 16 10:24:16 2015 UTC,"I keep it on high and stir it every so often and keep an eye out for burning. Even the high setting shouldn't burn as long as you don't leave it unattended for hours. Also note that you're never going to get it down to perfectly neutral, as homemade soap is always slightly alkaline. Many folks recommend shooting for between the 9.5 and 10.5pH range."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,jbisinla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:33:06 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. I kept it on low to be safe and ended up cooking it for nearly 3 hours. The pH didn't seem like it was getting any lower and ended up at about 10.5. The pH strips I got aren't the best so it's hard to tell. A pH of 11 and 12 are a deep purple/inky blue and 8, 9 and 10 are a very similar drab olive green colour. My soap came out a dark green so I assume its closer to 10 than 11. But shrugs.  I'll just have to shave with it and see if melts my face off like that bloke that looks into the Ark in Indiana Jones. I tested the pH of a couple of artisan soaps I had on hand and they were closer to neutral than mine.  Thanks again for the help!"
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,BungleBungleBungle,2,Thu Jul 16 20:05:51 2015 UTC,"I would give it a few days/weeks to cure if it's still too high a pH, and consider getting some better differentiated pH strips.  Good luck!"
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,jbisinla,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:39:14 2015 UTC,"I'm about to go shower/shave now, so if it's a bit rough I'll let it chill out in the garage for a while haha.  Sorry, but one more question, if you pour the soap into individual pots while it's hot, wouldn't that mean it's too hot for the essential oils? I imagine you'd scent the soap before pouring."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,BungleBungleBungle,2,Fri Jul 17 00:32:45 2015 UTC,"It's more of a scooping than a pouring, but there's definitely a tricky part of finding the point where it's cool enough to add scent without it flashing off and scenting the air rather than the soap, but warm enough to scoop into jars or pots easily.  EDIT: Also, do a test lather on your arm first, so if it's too harsh, you don't damage your face."
Wet_Shavers,3de6yr,jbisinla,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. Finding the not too hot/not too cold ""Goldilocks zone"" must take a bit of practice.  First shave went really well, I didn't get any burning so it must be only a little over 10 on the pH, I'd guess. Now to hand out some samples to some guys I know that are into wet shaving and see what they think.  Thank you again for what you've done both here and by documenting your soap making on B&B, it's been very helpful. I really should buy more of your soaps, the only one I have at the moment is Myrkviðr."

For those who may not know, this is the artisan that produces the Maggard Razors brand of soaps. Maggard Razors - Speaking of which, Maggard Razors has put a bunch of discontinued soap samples for sale at 50% off! The brands include offerings from Barrister & Mann, Dapper Dragon, and the LA Shaving Co. Shannon's Soaps - Shannon has introduced her seasonal scents for Summer 2015. The first is Coconut Lime and the other is Lemon-Breeze, a mentholated soap described as a lemon sorbet.  Shave Revolution - This vendor has just introduced their own branded shaving soap (I think these are new at least) with some mildly interesting scents. I am not sure if they are made by a third party or not though. Italian Barber - Feather Blades x100 available for $25. I was hesitant to post this because I don't know the value of Feather blades but they are popular enough that it might be worth mentioning. The Art of Shaving at B-Glowing - Most AoS products are still 75% off at this vendor. You can get entire tubs for $6.25.

Those two seem to be the same soap base -- very soft croap-style; very easy to whip up a lather, but the lather isn't terribly thick or especially slick.  It's not bad by any means, just compared to our resident artisans, it doesn't feel as luxurious.    Now Santa Maria is more of a putty/cream consistency.  It is ever so slightly mentholated.  You smell it more than you feel it though.  And it has something called a Toscano Cigar cologne scent, whatever that is.  I smoke a few cigars per week and keep a pretty well-stocked humidor, but it smells nothing like that.    But it smells fantastic.  It's a very thirsty soap that whips up into something pretty damn special.  It's become an instant favorite in fact.    And at $20 for 8.5 ounces in what is essentially the Martin de Candre jar, it's a no-brainer of a value.  Even if it's not to your liking, you could flip it without losing much if any money."

What cigar should I light up next weekend? I've tried a few here and there and I absolutely loved E.P. Carrillo's La Historia. Granted I haven't tried too many but you mentioned having a well-stocked humidor and I'm just interested in trying new flavors. I'd probably pair it with a nice IPA or American Belgian tripel."
Wet_Shavers,3d8t8p,unbrownloco,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:02:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on your budget.  Padron 1964 anniversary series are some of my absolute favorite and have been for years.  They're a little pricey, but any cigar in the lineup is a home run, and they're pretty high production cigars so therefore easy to find, so most nicer tobacconists will have them.  If milder is what you're seeking: Ashton white label, Illusione Epernay, Arturo Fuente Hemingway with the Cameroon wrappers, Julius Caesar.  Mid to full: Ashton VSG, La Duena, El Centurion, Tatuaje brown label, Tatuaje red label, Liga Privada Undercrown, Herrera esteli norteno, La Flor Dominicana double ligero  (very stout)."

It isn't the best soap I have ever used, but it is inexpensive and too good to toss in the bin. Not as good as B&M, Mickey Lee, LASSC, etc., but then again it is half the price of any of those artisans."

Wet_Shavers,3d8t8p,unbrownloco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:01:09 2015 UTC,That's the popular rumor. I can't ascertain if it's true or not though.
Wet_Shavers,3d8t8p,mmosh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:31:02 2015 UTC,I know its a method used by others. Find who makes XYZ's soap/cream and then have them manufacture your private label ZYX soap to the same/similar specs. Actually met a vendor who was starting his label off of RazoRock soap producer. He had the gall to credit them as artisan too. Haven't seen them mentioned anywhere outside of the convo with him tho.
Wet_Shavers,3d8t8p,unbrownloco,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:19:09 2015 UTC,"Very common, especially for RR. His ABCBA was allegedly done by the same company that provides for Antica Barbiera Colla, and his new bath soaps are confirmed to be made by Saponificio Varesino"
Wet_Shavers,3d8t8p,crazindndude,0,Wed Jul 15 21:48:48 2015 UTC,"he's a master of supply and demand   When there is consistently much more demand than possible supply it is impossible to keep up which is obviously a terrific situation for a vendor. If there wasn't a fundamental belief in the quality and desirability of his products that wouldn't be happening. It is rare to see any of his razors pop up on the BSTs and they go for a veritable ransom at auction.  The same thing happens with many of the artisan soap manufacturers. Their products sell out quickly, they develop other fragrances routinely while abandoning previous fragrances and there is always at least ""some"" frustration expressed on the forums."

I often feel that Joe gets by simply because he got into the game early. None of his products are outstanding, but he has a loyal customer base from a time about 5 years ago when there weren't as many shaving vendors or artisans offering really high quality products.  I give him props for his efforts to bring high quality low-cost razors to market, but since he doesn't have the resources to meet demand, half the time they aren't really available to the average person for the low prices he is aiming for."
Wet_Shavers,3d8t8p,almightywhacko,4,Wed Jul 15 01:46:38 2015 UTC,"I'm being neither a fan nor a critic of Joe or his products (I have an RRSS v3 which is fine but not brilliant IMHO) but rather an observer of the free market system at work.   That said, there are some who have a lot of influence in the wet shaving community who way to often drum up what appears to me to be perhaps unwarranted and excessive interest in various products and vendors by extolling their virtues repeatedly and at length. That does a splendid job of creating demand where perhaps it wouldn't be and that is damaging to both the community and the individual member."

Wet_Shavers,3d8t8p,JohnSherlockHolmes,5,Wed Jul 15 01:16:00 2015 UTC,"It just seemed a little presumptive to assume she hasn't volunteered or done what she can. I get tired of reverse misogyny/misandry (whatever the buzzword for the minute is) myself, but it's not something that will be solved by giving the expected reaction.     Not that I'm assuming you're trying to solve anything.   It just comes across as an ill represented, overly emotional, unintelligent lashing out to someone who might casually read through. Like a car revving up and instead of heading straight down the track, it just swerves back and forth until it plows through a fence.    I mean, either way, I don't care. The pronoun thing is stupid, but I can also see where it came from. Overly sensitized people have made us into a race of excessively PC wienerbutts. It's just the way things are going to be until the whole equality pendulum swings back toward the center."

Wet_Shavers,3d8t8p,JohnSherlockHolmes,4,Wed Jul 15 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've had those days before. I've come undone myself. It's just one of those things that happens, especially when we become exposed to things like that every single day. When we see something as a problem, but see everyone commit the same ""crime"" everyday, it gets to the point where you want to grab them by the shoulders and say ""WAKE UP!""  I hate that I can't offer to help a woman with her groceries because she assumes I'll kidnap and rape her. I'd just as soon help a man I saw struggling, but then I'd be emasculating him. How about just accept the fucking help because hey, we're goddamn human beings and I want to be nice to someone without any expectation of reciprocation.  But that won't happen, because it's more complex than that. The only thing that keeps me tempered is remembering that. Everything is always more complex than any solution we can think of in the moment. So I try to calm myself before speaking out of frustration whenever I can."

Excluding women is bullshit. Straight Razor shaving is not only for men. Wet shaving isn't exclusive to men, why market it to men only?   It's extremely annoying to see a bunch of people who try to market wet shaving to US as a MANLY thing when it really is for everyone.
