However what I will say is that Better Call Saul is a new drama, despite it being made by the same people that made Breaking Bad it is going to start off from the beginning. Whilst I enjoyed BCS it definitely was not the greatest season for a drama- however I don't really expect first seasons of dramas to go far in awards because a first season should be setting stuff up for other seasons. And the only episodes I say were exceptional in BCS is Five-O and Pimento"
betterCallSaul,3dv8nt,TheLoneWolf527,2,Sun Jul 19 22:53:28 2015 UTC,"To make a long story short, BCS was on the bottom end of the spectrum in terms of being nominated for Best Drama and could have easily NOT been nominated at all (many places didn't predict its nomination).

betterCallSaul,3dv8nt,ICookTheBlueStuff,2,Mon Jul 20 07:10:57 2015 UTC,"As much I would love and want BCS to take home all the awards, I feel like the Emmy board will sort of push BCS aside this season and see what it can bring forth this upcoming season.

Liking Breaking Bad more doesn't mean Better Call Saul is of ""lower quality"" than Breaking Bad. 80% of the people involved in Breaking Bad are involved in Better Call Saul."
betterCallSaul,3dd69r,hajisquickvanish,12,Wed Jul 15 21:27:57 2015 UTC,"You can argue that in your opinion they are all the same quality, but from his perspective liking Breaking Bad more actually does mean that to him Better Call Saul is of lower quality. You just don't have to like that he thinks that."
betterCallSaul,3dd69r,secondspassed,2,Wed Jul 15 22:52:12 2015 UTC,"Quality is a lousy word choice when the shows are made exactly the same way, with the exception of shooting in digital versus on film. MasterLawlz likes Five-O the most because of its violent tone (which is reminiscent of Breaking Bad). That doesn't mean Better Call Saul is of ""lesser quality."" MasterLawlz just prefers the tone of Breaking Bad to Better Call Saul.  Also, the tone reflects the story. Breaking Bad's tone changed every season and became even darker as Walt descended into madness. The tone in S1 was far different than the tone the rest of the way.   Better Call Saul was a character study in season 1. We're meeting Jimmy McGill, the people he loves and the world he inhabits.  At the end of season 1, he made a choice that will take him down a dark path of criminality that ultimately leads to Omaha. He was already a criminal at one point in his life but from Breaking Bad, we know exactly how much transformation is left in him as he becomes the attorney version of Slippin' Jimmy (Saul Goodman).  Keep in mind, Mike and Nacho were sidelined for the majority of season 1. They are the primary source of criminality on Better Call Saul. In S2 and beyond, their roles will be much bigger now that Jimmy (and Mike) has made the choice to pursue a life of crime, something he was best at as we saw in Cicero. The difference is he's doing it within the context of the law.  So, this is my long-winded way of saying, if you like the tone of Breaking Bad more (like MasterLawlz), the tone of Better Call Saul will become even darker and more violent as the series progresses, just like it did on Breaking Bad as Walt descended further and further into criminality.   Will it ever be the exact same tone as Breaking Bad? Probably not, but at times, yes. Regardless, S1 simply isn't a fair representation of what the show's tone can and will be since two major characters were pushed aside most of the season. That way, we could get to know Jimmy McGill, his loved ones etc. and care about him as he makes his inevitable (and tragic) transformation into Saul Goodman. I never thought I would love the man who would later become Saul Goodman. I always liked Saul, but we never had a reason to care about him like we do now.   So, don't confuse tone for quality when the tone isn't defined yet. It's fluid."

I am giving them the benefit of the doubt and hoping we get some real Saul in season 2. That will make the first season with Jimmy awkwardly bumbling through life as a frame, so to speak, to show off the background and birth of Saul. If not, I will question my strong devotion to this show."

betterCallSaul,3djkyk,grelfysk,6,Thu Jul 16 21:51:00 2015 UTC,"It gets better.  Coming off of Breaking Bad, I remember being markedly disappointed in the pilot and 2nd episode (I still feel like they destroyed Tuco's character for the sake of comedy).  Still, the season picks up, and the later episodes are definitely higher quality in terms of writing and acting.   In general, the smaller moments on the show (skater kids, Kettlemans) are hit-or-miss, but the big dramatic moments that happen later in the season are always very well done."
betterCallSaul,3djkyk,i_bought_the_airline,2,Fri Jul 17 05:14:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, now that's reassuring! Because you seem to mention exactly the moments which I didn't like - Tuco, skater kids, etc. (also just remembered I didn't like Saul's 'past in prison' - where he looked like he's just waiving his hands mechanically while reading the script in his head - I've seen an actor, not a Saul there). So if you say that after this it's improving, I'll consider trying to watch further. Thanks!"

betterCallSaul,3djkyk,spankymuffin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:33:51 2015 UTC,Honestly I like to think of the show as low stakes breaking bad. It's even more character driven (I didn't think that was possible). There is much less about character change but more about nuance and different aspects of characters. I think it's a great show but just because you loved breaking bad does not mean you will love this show. It's just so different.
betterCallSaul,3djkyk,spankymuffin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"No stakes really because we know their futures. What's compelling is the individual moments that, in hindsight, become the emotional/psychogic fulcrums on which these characters turn and operate. Much more of a slow burn character painting like Mad Men."
betterCallSaul,3djkyk,whitejag,0,Sat Jul 18 21:50:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting! I absolutely love deep and interesting characters, if this is the case, I would consider trying again!  It's just some strange jokes and moments which killed the fun for me. The guys arguing for 10 minutes in the desert about what to break - how many legs, or just kill etc. I can understand dark humor, but that one was rather... flat. And other uninteresting jokes and turns like that. This takes out 'juice' from storytelling and makes it kinda boring to watch. I.e. things like that are too 'usual', I can see that a lot in 'holywood'-like films, I hoped this show would stay different.   I am not trying to bad mouth this show, just explaining why it didn't took off with me."

I think whereas Walt's story is about desperation, Jimmy's story is about ambition    Walt played it fast and loose and got burned cause he was a genius, but he was reckless.   Jimmy is much smarter, and much more clever and a nice meta commentary on this whole universe could be that this mans ambition is what fueled a desperate maniacs path of destruction.   It's Walt/hank that gets rid of Tuco and makes room for Gus to come in.   That's all Sauls fault. If Saul also helps Gus get moved in, and he works with the cartel, and he represents jack and co, the larger idea is that Walt isn't nearly the villain that jimmy is.   And it's just cause he can."

betterCallSaul,3d4iny,toomuchpork,-5,Tue Jul 14 02:35:11 2015 UTC,Are you saying a gas can become a liquid when stored at a high pressure? I don't think science is ready for that.  Propane is a gas at standard temp and pressure. Propane containers are pressure vessels.
betterCallSaul,3d4iny,osrevad,0,Tue Jul 14 07:19:50 2015 UTC,Wrong. A propane vehicle has a chamber to pressure drop the lng into a vapor and it is insulated as it gets super frosty.   Have a little read then come back and grovel for forgiveness and bow before my Superior knowledge! (Superior is a gas station here that sells propane)  The old school tanks had a bleed valve on them.

Being well-educated doesn't prevent someone from having a mental illness nor does it necessarily allow them to mask their symptoms. Perhaps some people can mask their mental illness pretty well most of the time, but a lot of us can't. When I'm in the middle of my depression or anxiety, it is definitely affects my behavior whether people notice it or not.  The police also behaved pretty realistically for cops not trained to consider the possibility that someone is mentally ill but who are trained to react with force to anyone behaving oddly."

If somebody is storing a redonkulous amount of propane, has disabled his electricity, wearing a space blanket refuses to open the door and talk, and can't even coherently cooperate with simple instructions, I'd think it would be a reasonable assumption that he's crazy enough to be a danger to himself, if not others (yet).

Walt's speech about the perfect time for him to die may have been the best acting I have ever seen, and I am skeptical judgmental cynical prick. Sure, there wasn't a lot of physical action but there was an ocean of action underneath the surface. It was also perfectly constructed narrative in terms of timing, pace, and opening/closing. It's no coincidence that the writer for the Fly got promoted to producer the next season then went on to write Ozymandias, the unilaterally accepted greatest episode of the series.  I honestly don't understand how people love Breaking Bad but dislike The Fly. The entire show is about what Walt talks about in The Fly. I mean it is the philosophy of the entire series distilled into one episode, just fucking brilliant."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,stoicblunder,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:44:19 2015 UTC,"The thing is, I don't feel like I needed the entire point of the show hammered home in an episode in a very heavy handed way. The entire rest of the series already covers it without heavy handed metaphores. I liken it to a movie with too much voiceover narrative - sometimes its best to let story speak for itself."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,brettsd,0,Sun Jul 12 17:39:58 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't understand how people love Breaking Bad but dislike The Fly.    Really? Ok it's a good episode, great in the scope of the entire series and holds up much better on a rewatch than filler episodes have any right to do, but at the end of the day, it is virtually the only episode in which nothing of actual relevance to the plot happens. You can actually skip Fly when you first watch the series and you will not be confused at all."

betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,robbielu_01,4,Sun Jul 12 07:47:08 2015 UTC,I watched it week by week as it came out. I was livid after the fly episode! No story for 2 weeks instead of 1?! Outrageous! But it has a place in my heart now.
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,anotherdayofnothing,-1,Sun Jul 12 10:46:40 2015 UTC,"Wait, there was a break in between episodes of more than a week when it was live? Couldn't have been the midseason finale AMC always likes to put out in their shows, was it?"
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,robbielu_01,2,Mon Jul 13 07:18:07 2015 UTC,"no no no, I just meant there was no story progression in that episode which meant I had to wait another week for story."

betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,twersx,3,Mon Jul 13 00:14:08 2015 UTC,"You can make a 13 episode season without having 'filler' episodes. I don't get why some people think that the longer a season is, the more the quality suffers. If that's the case, let's have 1 episode or a TV movie and be done with it. I said this in another comment and I'll say it again. TV shows are for our entertainment. The longer a season is, the longer we are entertained."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,nu1stunna,0,Sun Jul 12 17:01:25 2015 UTC,"Well said!  One reason why I often prefer a lot of US TV series over British TV series is that our seasons are too short.  However, in recent years US seasons seem to be getting shorter as well, but the longer the better in my eyes."

betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,Hugo2607,40,Sun Jul 12 12:55:50 2015 UTC,I like the 10 episode set up. It works good for game of thrones and it worked fine for season one.
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,dxgxnxratx315,78,Sun Jul 12 00:46:20 2015 UTC,Except most shows that run a 10 episode season would benefit greatly from a 12-13 episode season. The GoT finale was so rushed they could have easily made the season a couple more episodes. GRRM even wishes they would extend to 13 and incorporate more from the books.
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,thebochman,19,Sun Jul 12 00:56:53 2015 UTC,"GoT is an adaptation, BCS is not..  I agree that at times GoT could use more screen time to incorporate more of the source material, and at times that show has suffered from having to rush a few plot lines.    BCS does not have that problem... If you can tell a proper, well paced narrative in 10 hours vs 13 hours I am all for that...  More is not always better, and you could have the potential to wind up with filler."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,GRVrush2112,9,Sun Jul 12 02:06:53 2015 UTC,I want 13 because it gives me something to do for 3 extra weeks. This is still entertainment. I'd rather be entertained for a longer period.

betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,NickRick,11,Sun Jul 12 01:27:00 2015 UTC,But if you write 10 episodes in a year you spend more time on each than if you write 13 in a year.
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,starfirex,2,Sun Jul 12 03:22:43 2015 UTC,It's still one season per year. It's a difference of them having done 65 episodes by now or 50 episodes by now.
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,twersx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:17:32 2015 UTC,"He wants more time to write  It wouldn't add any more time, it's still yearly.   1 year = 12 months.  10 episodes a year = an episode every month & 5 days. so ~35 days per episode.  13 episodes a year = An episode every ~28 days.  That's about 7 days more time to write per episode. I don't how how I can break this down any more clearly."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,starfirex,3,Mon Jul 13 01:07:28 2015 UTC,It's not a matter of breaking it down. It doesn't make sense. The show has 0 effect on how fast George writes except for two factors   If he writes an episode for that season If he goes to PR events for the show   They still pump out one season of GoT every year. They'd do that if they were writing 13 episodes instead of 10. The only reason they'd do 13 is if they wanted to include more arcs from the books. They will still progress with the plot at the same pace that they want to.

betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,TheVenerableBede,2,Sun Jul 12 04:50:02 2015 UTC,And mentioned numerous times that he wishes HBO would do more then 7 seasons. (I'm pretty sure he was throwing the numbers 9 and 10 around)
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,mikey420,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:36:34 2015 UTC,I don't think HBO are averse to doing more seasons but D&D want to finish it in 7.   Doing more than 10 episodes a season would be very tough though. Their schedule is already crammed full virtually year round.
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,twersx,2,Mon Jul 13 00:20:15 2015 UTC,GoT runs for 50-52 minutes usually never the full 60
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,thebochman,6,Sun Jul 12 02:23:26 2015 UTC,"That's a common misconception. GoT runs anywhere from 50 to 65 minutes on average, with some episodes going even longer. Most episodes are in the 57-58 minute range. This season actually had longer episodes on average than Season 4 did (which was, in fact, mostly 50-52 minutes in the first chunk of the season)."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,EveryGoodNameIsGone,62,Sun Jul 12 03:27:05 2015 UTC,It should've been at least 13.  Edit: This is my response to zbyshekh. In case it gets lots in the comments.
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,xCriss8x,64,Sun Jul 12 00:48:35 2015 UTC,"Why? How? Why?  I don't understand people that have opinion on LENGTH of a show. Would it make it better show if they stretched the story or added less important characters/scenes? Is the CSI better show than True Detective because it has more episodes? I've seen many shows become crap because of the length, and a lot watered down storylines like in Desperate Housewives, after 15 episodes, you just didn't remember all characters' motives and besides they were shitty anyway.  Quality, not quantity."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,zbyshekh,8,Sun Jul 12 02:38:49 2015 UTC,Tbh true detective would have been much better if the present day period were stretched out a bit longer. 3 episode denouement was far too short.
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,Mrgreen428,5,Sun Jul 12 04:14:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, I love TD, but I feel like the finale was a bit rushed, story-wise."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,ElMatasiete7,3,Sun Jul 12 06:02:26 2015 UTC,"(A few True Detective, Season 1 spoilers ahead)  Yes. Episodes 7 and 8 could've very easily been all about Rust and Marty reuniting and going over all the stuff Cohle had been working on alone for the past 10 years-following leads, conducting interviews, perhaps even bonding a bit more, etcetera-and then at the end of episode 8, they finally figure out whodunit-which would create an extra ninth episode to focus solely on The Yellow King, Carcosa, the Tuttle's and ideally (in my mind anyway), maybe even some actual historic explanation into the the cult, their motivations, ideals and practices, rather than just spending like 15 minutes chasing Errol around his property, like it ended up going down..  In regard to BCS, however, it does go both ways and you certainly don't want to stretch the plot out just for the sake of adding a few more episodes.."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,theywererobots,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:47:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the finale was a bit anticlimactic. But BCS nailed the pacing, in my opinion."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,ElMatasiete7,19,Sun Jul 12 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"Well the point is it would've already been 13, so the story wouldn't be stretched, just longer."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,zoobify112,6,Sun Jul 12 02:46:27 2015 UTC,"This makes me think of The Black List. Main character Red Redington is awesome, the premise is awesome and usually the main story is also pretty good but with 20 something episodes per season they keep staling the plot and throwing filler episodes, I am pretty sure the show would be much better if they just told one big story arc in 10 episodes each season."

betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,ChuckFinleyy,3,Sun Jul 12 06:32:03 2015 UTC,"You and I are both speaking from ignorance. I can't say the show will be missing a lot of things as a result of having less episodes and you can't say the show will suffer from being stretched by adding only 3 more episodes.  There can be a lot of reasons to have less episodes in a season, other than quality. For instance, apparently, the first season was going to have 13 episodes, but Bob Odenkirk wanted to spend more time with his family. Some people say that was his way of negotiating for the future or something. Either way, having less episodes was not a result of realizing that the show would suffer by having 3 more.  I understand you though, we've been burned throughout the years by many shows adding not just more episodes, but pointless seasons in order to keep milking a name.  As a VIEWER that knows how good Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould, and everyone working with them are, I just want to enjoy the expectation of a new episode, the enjoyment of that episode, and the comments on this subreddit. I want to do that 3 more times."
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,xCriss8x,2,Sun Jul 12 15:05:18 2015 UTC,"OK, sure I understand that people just want more of the good stuff and probably Vince would deliver. I just can't stand people complaining about short shows. I love that BB ended just in time in the height of its glory. And as I watched a lot of shows, I can't remember one good example of show above magical 100 hours of running time.  I just don't care about how long it is, I care if it's good."

betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,BlackCatScott,-3,Wed Jul 15 08:18:01 2015 UTC,"See this thread where I'm viciously attacked and called ""a fag"" for providing accurate information a while ago on this subject. I was downvoted repeatedly while the homophobic comment was up voted 9 times along with other vicious comments.   Really sick of how nasty this sub can be when I was only trying to SHARE intel with my fellow BB and BCS brotherhood. I can't cite sources if I expect to keep them.   Things happen long before they're reported in this world. Gilligan wasn't announced as co-showruner until July 2014 at TCAs when he was already on board as co-showrunner for S1 at least 6 months prior.  I've proven my accuracy numerous times as I was the first to say that Junior Brown's song would not be the theme song despite the reports of many. I also broke the 10 episode news as clues were left on Celebrity Jeopardy, the Variety panel and another article on how 10 episode seasons are becoming more popular thanks to GoT. These are just a couple examples.  My sources told me this 10 episode news MONTHS ago and I only chose to share it with you guys once it was put out there by Variety in print. People didn't want to believe that either which is why I came forward. People attacked me, called Variety a misprint and yet they kept referring to IMDB which is notoriously inaccurate PRIOR to the broadcast. They were operating on July 2014's press release that season 2 would be 13 episodes.   AMC was WILLING to pay for 13 episodes; that doesn't mean that BCS would make that many.   You can blame 10 episode seasons on AMC as they were being cheap in BB S5 negotiations. As it turned out, Vince and co. liked doing 8 episode seasons as things were a lot tighter and more manageable. So, returning to 13 episode seasons was too jarring a transition after doing 8 most recently.  10 was a nice compromise for the writers despite AMC wanting/ordering more episodes.  Now, AMC saves more money and the BCS gets a bit more money to spend on the 10 they are making. Plus, GoT does it so BCS wants to be in close company with them. The difference is, GoT HAS to do 10 episode seasons out of necessity since each episode costs at least $10M.  In the future, I won't even bother sharing intel with you guys. It's not worth being ripped to shreds when I'm only trying to SHARE. I'm attacked, so I have to attack back and then I'm called  ""a douche"" or ""a fag"" when I wouldn't be having this type of rhetoric if I wasn't put on the defensive each and every time. That's why I started the thread by saying, ""DON'T SHOOT THE MESSENGER.""  https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/39ct7j/season_2_is_only_10_episodes_not_13_like_we/"
betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,hajisquickvanish,5,Sun Jul 12 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"You again? Holy shit. It's not that people didn't want to believe you, it's that you gave them literally no reason to. Of course it makes sense not to share your sources if you want to be able to keep getting info, but it also makes sense not to take the word of a random redditor who says he has a source but won't reveal it. I don't understand how you don't get that."

betterCallSaul,3cyrqt,suss2it,19,Sun Jul 12 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"No I've seen plenty of dissenting opinions in my time here.

betterCallSaul,3cupjd,EminGH,4,Mon Jul 13 01:16:01 2015 UTC,It's also only one season so far. Shit has yet to go down.
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,quinnly,297,Sat Jul 11 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"It's different but in a lot of ways just as good so far. The dialogue is top notch, the cinematography, the acting, it's all very quality. But it's different from Breaking Bad in the sense that it's not (so far) an intense character drama, but rather a dark comedy/law show. It's still a character piece, but since Saul's character is so fundamentally different than Walter's, it makes for a very different show. It shares some characteristics with Breaking Bad but it stands on its own.  I honestly love it. I thought it was the best show on TV during that season, and I can't wait for season 2."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,quinnly,33,Fri Jul 10 22:58:58 2015 UTC,"I think what I worry about going into BCS is that it seems to only have so many places it can go... whereas BB being an original series was able to go anywhere it wanted. Focus is definitely more limited, but it's sounding like the writing keeps it up to par."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,quinnly,75,Sat Jul 11 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong but you're also not entirely right. According to Gilligan, the show is going to be set ""Before, during, and after"" Breaking Bad. Now we've mostly seen ""before"" during season 1, but without going into spoilers we've also seen a tiny bit of the ""during"" or ""after"". This isn't going to be just a show about how Saul becomes Saul (although I think that could be a show all by itself) but also about Saul's expierence with and what happens to him after his experience with Heisenberg. So there's quite a bit to be excited about."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,tarnkek,16,Sat Jul 11 00:18:39 2015 UTC,"I know it's already been renewed for S2, but has it been doing well enough in ratings that this'll be around for awhile? Would love to see anything set ""After"" BB."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,adrianp07,30,Sat Jul 11 00:20:49 2015 UTC,"I think it's been doing well. The premiere had nearly 7 million viewers when it aired, which broke some kind of basic cable record. It dipped after that but always stayed around 3 million, which is more than enough to keep a show afloat these days. Plus once it gets on Netflix and more people are able to watch it, you'd think the overall viewership would go up in future seasons. That's what happened with Breaking Bad, at least."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,FloaterFloater,12,Sat Jul 11 00:24:26 2015 UTC,It's only on Netflix here  (UK) so I'd love to see the stats
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,YouTee,2,Sat Jul 11 00:54:14 2015 UTC,can confirm. Only got in to BB after I saw the first 2 seasons on Netflix. Same with some other shows.

betterCallSaul,3cupjd,micktravis,18,Tue Jul 21 12:00:58 2015 UTC,"You say that BB could go wherever it wanted, and you're right, but its genius lies in the fact that it had a very particular story to tell.  It didn't stick around and write extra crap into the storyline just because it was popular, but it could have.  It could have easily made money for another 3, 4, even 5 seasons.  But Gilligan seems to be the first ever person connected with television to have the ethics to maintain true to the vision even when millions of dollars are dangling in his face.  So, I will take a ride on BCS to wherever he wants to take me and for however long."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,Darrian,9,Sat Jul 11 01:05:26 2015 UTC,"I think what I worry about going into BCS is that it seems to only have so many places it can go...   That's like saying that Breaking Bad only has so many places it can go because Walt has terminal cancer and is going to die from episode one. You'd be surprised how little Saul's future affects the first season.  Watch the first season before you make any ridiculous generalizations about it. Many people are predicting an emmy nomination for the drama, as well as for Odenkirk and Banks (with many predicting him to win his). That's all you really need to know.  Also it got renewed for season 2 before the first one even aired. How many other shows have done that?"

I've heard people say they didn't like it as much, and I've heard just as many people say they like it more.  The thing is, it's less ""explosive"" so far. Less violent. In BB you had some dead, dissolved guys getting mopped up off the floor by episode 3. There's nothing that intense in BCS.  But it's tense in a different way, and it's very good story telling."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,zuxtron,29,Fri Jul 10 23:16:16 2015 UTC,"There's nothing that intense in BCS.   I thought that  in episode two was as intense and nerve-wracking as similar scenes from BB. But there aren't as many such moments in BCS, so you are correct that it is not as intense overall."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,imj666777,7,Sat Jul 11 00:40:40 2015 UTC,"I think that episode works like that because most of us have already become familiar with the star of that episode.  It would probably have a different vibe if we weren't familiar with that particular character already.  I don't know, or maybe not."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,beanzuul,13,Sat Jul 11 01:35:35 2015 UTC,"Firstly, Better Call Saul is meant to be watched after Breaking Bad, so being familiar with the characters should not be an issue.  Second, watching Jimmy  would probably still have a newbie to the series on the edge of their seat."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,bothanspy1337,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:10:50 2015 UTC,"It's not as violent or ""explosive"" as some one above me said because it's not about a meth dealer it's a ""criminal lawyer "" which means they actually have a lot more options because of all of the other criminals in town"
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,Reddit_N_Tacos,35,Sat Jul 11 19:27:34 2015 UTC,"I would say the quality is equal to breaking bad (fantastic writing/acting/cinematography), BUT it is not the same subject matter. So if you loved BB primarily for the intense murdery situations, you'll probably be disappointed with bCS. But if you're into the Saul character and more character-based intensity (and this shit gets intense) that may not include bike-lock strangulation or similar scenarios (...yet), then give it a try."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,SmallNuclearRNA,11,Fri Jul 10 23:11:42 2015 UTC,"The key to making a good spinoff is to not do the same thing again.  Better Call Saul succeeds at doing just that and as a result is a really fantastic show.  Don't expect to see another action-drama with sudden twists and ""jaw-droppers"" like Breaking Bad became famous for.  BCS is more of like a political dramedy than an action-drama.  The suspense and entertainment comes from the characters interacting with each other and figuring out who's related to who and what side everyone is on.  Remember, Saul was never up in the action pulling the triggers, he was in the background pulling the strings.  As far as the ""quality"" goes, it's exactly on par with Breaking Bad.  You'll get the same radical camera angles, dramatic lighting, and attention to detail you've come to love and expect from Breaking Bad.  The only place it falls short—very slightly I might add—is that season 1 felt less straightforward than Breaking Bad did.  The overall story tends to bounce around a bit to difference focuses and different characters.  It doesn't make the show enjoyable in the slightest, but it is worth mentioning.  Gilligan is heavily involved with the show.  He directed the first episode as per usual and has returned to the writers room, which is where he's most needed.  The only difference is that the show is co-created alongside Peter Gould, who worked very closely on Vince with Breaking Bad.  Anyways, it's a very enjoyable show that stands on its own very well.  There are also little nods and nuggets to Breaking Bad that don't feel forced—some are very obvious, some you won't figure out until you read about the episode online afterwards."

Including me. BrBa got a bit out of control, fad-ish. I know of a fair number of people who didn't really enjoy it but watched anyway so they could say they did and talk about it. Which baffled me. BCS doesn't seem to have that in my circles, which is actually nice, most people dismissed it as a spinoff and didn't give it a real chance.   This show is just as well made as BrBa. It has a different tone, but there is overlap. Jimmy has been built out to have a really in-depth character, and I have grown very attached to him, which is surprising since I didn't feel anything in BrBa. Mike was my favourite character, and I have thoroughly enjoyed learning his backstory, and seeing him again.   I've been hooked. Would definitely recommend."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,sindex23,8,Fri Jul 10 23:09:55 2015 UTC,I just rewatched the first two seasons of Breaking Bad. BCS is pretty amazing but Breaking Bad was just on another level imo.

betterCallSaul,3cupjd,pierrerr1997,68,Fri Jul 10 22:56:27 2015 UTC,I personally think it's far more solid than the first season of Breaking Bad. That's not a knock on Breaking Bad. It's just Vince and Co have had several years to get good at this sort of story telling now.
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,wuneternalround,11,Fri Jul 10 23:04:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed. As much as I enjoyed the first season of Breaking Bad, they were still trying to find their groove so to speak. BCS had a coherent vision from the get go."

betterCallSaul,3cupjd,plaid_banana,4,Sat Jul 11 01:23:12 2015 UTC,"from what little research I have done, looks like BCS does have Vince Gilligan's involvement... although to what extent I dunno?

betterCallSaul,3cupjd,Theodoros9,-3,Sat Jul 11 00:04:55 2015 UTC,Has he said anything in interviews as to why he chose to do a spinoff as opposed to say... more BB seasons or an entirely new show altogether?
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,sardinemanR,4,Sat Jul 11 00:13:42 2015 UTC,"He did say this:   ""I would love to see a Saul Goodman spinoff,” he said in a July 2012 interview. “I like the idea of a lawyer show in which the main lawyer will do anything it takes to stay out of a court of law. He’ll settle on the courthouse steps, whatever it takes to stay out of the courtroom. That would be fun — I would like that.”   I can't speak for Vince, but I think it would have been a mistake to continue making more BrBa seasons just for the sake of having more episodes. Vince was a regular writer and producer for X-Files before BrBa so I think he saw how that show really lost steam and suffered near the end (last three seasons) after being a massive hit in the beginning. He tied the BrBa story up nicely while it was still in its peak. Better Call Saul allows him to continue creating in the same universe as BrBa, but with a different story and protagonist."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,Brolympia,0,Sat Jul 11 00:20:09 2015 UTC,I can understand that. Just wonder if he'll also ever do an entirely new show... AMC seems to be willing to throw money at him if he's up for it.
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,Iniesto,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:22:15 2015 UTC,"He did have some ties to Battle Creek, although I don't think that has fared nearly as well as the Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul universe.  Vince is a really really good writer, I'm sure he'll have some future hits (and misses)."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,Rusty_McFartflaps,4,Sat Jul 11 20:30:49 2015 UTC,Season 1 of BCS is better than Season 1 of Breaking Bad in my view. I didnt have high expectations but it smashed them out of the ballpark. It is a genuinely great show and Saul is every bit as compelling as Walt.
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,beautifultrees,3,Sat Jul 11 05:40:32 2015 UTC,"This is going to be personal preference and also you have to take into account you get a ""complete"" version of BB while BCS you've only see one part of it.  BB is one of my top favorite shows of all time. I do not expect BCS to get to that same level at all.

betterCallSaul,3cupjd,messiahwannabe,2,Sat Jul 11 06:04:36 2015 UTC,"I looooooove Breaking Bad but went into Better Call Saul with low expectations.  Didn't think his character was good enough for a lead series and initially saw it more as a poor attempt to ride Breaking Bad's success rather than a series that would stand on its own.  However, the show has been really, really, really good.  It's not Breaking Bad good, but its damn close."

I loved Breaking Bad, but if I had been waiting and watching it along the time, I don't think I would have been as appreciative. The first season of BCS is not bad but it has a lot to live up. I was disappointed with the end. I am so excited to see more but the first season is only about half good. Definitely will be great in the future."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,sagmentus,2,Sat Jul 11 00:37:56 2015 UTC,"I'm going to play the dark horse here and just say a simple… ""No"".  don't get me wrong, it's a really good show.  I watched every episode the first season as soon as it came out, and will do so next season as well, undoubtedly.  I'm subscribed to its subreddit, and feel it's worth commenting on from time to time.  it's definitely better than almost everything else on TV right now...   but maybe not better than everything on TV right now.  still, give it a shot! It's a great little show!"
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,Gabe1282,2,Sat Jul 11 03:46:10 2015 UTC,"Having watched all of Breaking Bad twice now, and having watched Season 1 of Better Call Saul, I honestly like Better Call Saul better. Thats not to take anything away from BB, its more like a 1a and 1b situation here. I love both shows, but the character of Jimmy/Saul is what puts BCS slightly ahead for me. He is just such a well written, complex character, and I find it much easier to relate to him and root for him than I ever did with Walt.  Honestly if you enjoyed BB I don't see any reason you wouldn't also enjoy BCS. Watch it, if you aren't sucked in within the first few episodes then you've only lost a few hours of time."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,ChefNicholas,2,Sat Jul 11 16:30:16 2015 UTC,"I actually like it more. Jimmy/Saul is a much more relatable and sympathetic character. The core story itself is very different. If you watched BB more for the plot of absolute peril Walter and Jesse found themselves in and would rather a show more about the character of one of the most interesting side characters of BB- then its a win-win.   It has enough of its own identity by the end of season 1, and yet retains some of the best filmmaking aspects of Breaking Bad that keep you coming back.   It's not as ""thrill-per-minute"" as Breaking Bad was by the end of each season, but Saul was always my favorite character and I'm glad he's getting his chance to shine. It also brings in Mike to show his origins and watch him do what he does best.   So far I haven't met anyone who hasn't enjoyed it.   Just for examples sake- my SO never saw the appeal of Breaking Bad, tried to watch it, but didn't stick to them. However, we sat and watched just one episode of Saul and she kept talking about how well made it was for weeks after.   Just some perspective. The first season isn't that long and you can always decide for yourself."
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,pappazeuss,2,Sat Jul 11 17:14:49 2015 UTC,I honestly like how this started better that BB. I can only imagine it's going to get better and better with the overlapping.
betterCallSaul,3cupjd,ThePrius,2,Sat Jul 11 17:28:10 2015 UTC,"Don't go into it thinking it's a ""prequel"" to Breaking Bad. It's its own show and there's a lot to like about it. It's like watching a different movie from the same director of a movie you like.   Sure there are nods here and there to BB and your experience will most likely be enhanced from already knowing and loving recurring characters and settings. But it's best viewed by judging what it does on its own not by how faithful it is to its predecessor Imo."

You immediately feel Vince Gilligan's influence, the style and photography is very similar to BB, but the general tone is a bit more upbeat.   TBH, Breaking Bad was a bit too dark for me at certain points. BCS has a better balance in that regard.  Just watch it, you will love it!"

I loved Breaking Bad's universe and I loved getting to know the characters and being invested in the storyline - but it took two seasons to be fully into it.   better Call Saul hasn't found its feet for me yet. It introduced characters like Michael Mando's Nacho, but then abandoned it. The problem with Vince and Peter is that they write things as they go along, which I think made the first season a little confused in terms of tone and direction.   Honestly though, it is fantastic. I think season two will be a blast."

betterCallSaul,3cupjd,PuffinGreen,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, the quality is the same. That said, the content is different.  It's a slow burn, like much of Breaking Bad was, but the twists feel different. In Breaking Bad, we had no idea where things were going so every twist was out of nowhere. In Saul, we know where Saul ends up. Amazingly, this show has made the twists and shock moments into something STILL shocking and unexpected, largely because we have expectations of the character.

betterCallSaul,3cjrha,GetSomeShowerHead,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"Basically because of this, which is but one article about networks shrinking their seasons. 23 episodes a year used to be standard but it's been shrinking in the last few years, with more reruns and more commercials per episodes. Silicon Valley is another example; only 8 episodes the first season and 10 the 2nd, whereas Mike Judge's old show, Beavis & Butthead once had 50 shows a year. It feels like the networks and/or production compainies are doing the bare minimum these days."
betterCallSaul,3cjrha,Gorehog,3,Wed Jul 8 20:20:17 2015 UTC,In my opinion fewer episodes leads to better story telling. When you lock in to doing so many episodes each season the writers end up trying to fill all of those episodes and the quality goes down.

betterCallSaul,3celkp,fe-and-wine,5,Wed Jul 8 22:11:34 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you are getting downvoted. It is an honest question even if charmingly naive.  We really need some tort law reform, IMO. Also, if we had a national health care plan that meant that everyone was covered for injuries, it would curb many of the annoying small out-of-court settlements that these scammers go for. They currently go for the  guaranteed 10k and split that with the chiropractor(scam artist quacks) and the lawyer(bloodsucking ambulance chasers). Eliminating the ability to use a fake doctor (chiropractor) to document injuries would be a good first step in reforming tort law.   Ridiculous insurance costs created by these assholes makes starting a small business very hard for an average Joe. However, lawyers and insurance companies love the current situation. So do big companies who can afford the added costs because it prices out smaller competitors.   Lawyers and insurance are a necessary evil, but it's time they got taken down a few notches. Good luck finding a politician who isn't in their pocket. Campaign finance reform may create an honest politician but getting that through is a pipe dream, because guess what? Politicians are corrupt as shit and aren't really looking to put an end to kickbacks.   We are basically screwed. George Washington warned about this before he died. Nobody listened."
betterCallSaul,3celkp,AboutTheFairness,5,Tue Jul 7 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"The problem is that most tort reform plans hurt meritorious claimants more than they hurt frivolous claimants. I don't know where you got the ""guaranteed 10K"" figure from. It's not as easy to win a frivolous claim as you're suggesting."
betterCallSaul,3celkp,HoolywoodDingus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:36:50 2015 UTC,Any simple car accident or slip and fall can be settled for less than 10k in mediation if you agree not to go to trial. Insurance companies do it all the time because it is cheaper than paying trial lawyer hours. At the very least Chiropractors should be removed from the equation. An injured person only needs to see a real doctor once and then the rest of the therapy and documentation is done by chiropractors who are total quacks.   The problem is that most tort reform plans hurt meritorious claimants more than they hurt frivolous claimants.   That sounds like a rehearsed line from a bar association lobbyist.
betterCallSaul,3celkp,AboutTheFairness,2,Wed Jul 8 03:50:30 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting your vague settlement information? The Chamber of Commerce? Your idea to prohibit evidence of chiropractor examinations is refreshingly logical, and it sounds like a good idea.  I can assure you that I'm not a bar association lobbyist. What I'm talking about are things like caps on tort claims. A cap of $250,000 only hurts people that have claims that are worth a lot of money (these aren't the liars everyone's worried about)."

betterCallSaul,3btq8k,Wolfman87,8,Thu Jul 2 03:55:20 2015 UTC,"Regina Resident here.   The dude's name is 'Paul McCallum'.  He left the Saskatchewan Roughriders [our Canadian Football Team, whose logo is featured] ten years ago.  This was at least partially due to him missing a kick in overtime during the western final of the Grey Cup [the national championship].  His home was pretty aggressively vandalized, which obviously lead to him wanting to leave.  Now, he is coming back to Saskatchewan because we need a good kicker after our 1st string quarter back got a season ending injury in the 1st game."

Paul McCallum played played for the Riders about a decade ago and fucked up a really important short field goal. Everyone got pissed and some asshat even went as far as to dump a truck full of shit on to his lawn. Well he packed up and left to play in BC and became the CFL's all-time everything kicker. Riders kicking situation sucks major balls right now and we just signed him. He's also 45, kind of like the Morten Andersen of the CFL"

betterCallSaul,3b2k9x,teninchtires,-7,Thu Jul 2 23:36:24 2015 UTC,"Mike meets Gustavo Fring when doing a background check on some goons he needs to hire for a job.  Said goons are Bill Burr's character Kuby, and Lavell Crawford's Huell.  The job goes wrong, and they all need a criminal lawyer.  Mike then finds out the police were tipped off about the job, and looks for the person who ratted him out.    We see Saul in the present, reading news articles about the capture of Walter White, who is in a coma in hospital and not expected to survive.  He begins to panic when the vacuum repair man is charged with multiple counts of aiding and abetting known felons.  He contemplates suicide when police forensics find Jesse's confession tape at the nazi compound, and apply for the extradition of Pinkman from France, where he was hiding, before being arrested for urinating in a public place and only identified when the desk sergeant recognised him from an Interpol mug-shot.  Saul changes his mind about killing himself at the last minute, when Rhea Seehorn's character Kim Wexler makes a television appeal for him to come forward.  She is now the senior vice president of a major law firm.  Chuck finally gets treatment for his condition, and starts his own practice.  His first client is Mike's rat, and on the witness protection programme because of what he knows about Madrigal Electromotive.  But before he can give testimony, on the orders of Fring, Mike takes no half measures and arranges for Chuck and the rat to have a car accident.  At the end of the last episode we see the car flip over and land on its roof, but we don't know if Chuck and the rat are dead or alive.  The final shot of the season, is of a body laying in a hospital bed, surrounded by machines.  At first we think it's Chuck, but when the camera slowly pans we see the face of Walter White.  His eyes open."

betterCallSaul,3ayjaz,stopfoulingjeff,22,Wed Jun 24 15:09:42 2015 UTC,"That's an important idea for the theme. That's all Jimmy ever wanted was his brothers approval, and if that was living the straight and narrow he would do it. But both Jimmy and us the viewers find that chuck will never be proud of Jimmy. Chucks right path for Jimmy was never about believing in him, it was to belittle him. So while chuck and his path for Jimmy are on the right side of society, they're just as morally corupt as the other side. They never wanted the best for jimmy, they never believed in or even wanted his success. His brother has intentionally lied to him and held him back for years. So in the last scenes of the last episode jimmy is forced to ask himself, what's the point? Why did I leave all that money, so someone just as morally fake (chuck) as me will be proud of me? Why jump through hoops to impress those who only want to hold you down? Jimmy feels he abandoned the only people who genuinely wanted to see him happy, and be himself. His hometown friend. SO now, jimmy sets off to do what he's good at, cheat and lie. It's who he is, it's his key to success and anyone holding him back just doesn't want him to be successful. Like breaking bad was the story of Walter white a good man breaking bad, better call Saul was the story of slippin jimmy trying to break good.

It's also sad because we know what happens to him in the end. If he had just kept on the straight and narrow, he'd still be a lawyer. He'd still have a decent standard of living.

He feels like he's been a whole joke all this time to that entire firm. That this is just her guiltt oitty gesture towards him. Couple that with some obvious past between her and jimmy, I'm sure involving some rejection and betrayed trust, it's easy to see why jimmy doesn't trust her. Even if we know better."

We know this is when chuck starts to see him as some sort of threat or undeserving up-start, and grows spiteful. But imagine if chuck was geuinely happy for him when he passed the bar exam. Instead of chuck sitting him in the mail room to keep an eye on him, he would shake out some real opportunities for saul. Instead of having an owner of this huge firm you work for holding you down, he's now a supportive brother. Instead of sabotaging you, he's actually sticking his neck out for you. Around the time jimmy passes the exam chuck is not only healthy but still a big mover and shaker. It would have been very easy to put jimmy in a position to flourish, while we all know jimmyas talented and dedicated enough to make use of oppurtunities.

betterCallSaul,3asqqb,IAmNotHariSeldon,16,Tue Jun 23 07:28:04 2015 UTC,"That's why if Nacho actually is a Fed, he's probably FBI since they would be interested in finding the money as well.  I always wondered why a gangster like Nacho wouldn't just strong-arm the Kettlemans if he knew they had the money, instead of all the intrigue with Jimmy."
betterCallSaul,3asqqb,1TrueKingInTheNorth,52,Tue Jun 23 08:17:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. Why would he come looking for a criminal lawyer to do dirty work for him if he was? The FBI or CIA would probably have other undercover agents set up for that sort of thing. Plus, in Breaking Bad, when Walt and Jesse kidnap Saul and bring him out to the desert, he says something like ""Wait, Ignacio [Nacho] didn't send you? Oh thank god."" If Nacho was working for a governmental agency Saul wouldn't be afraid of him killing him like that unless he doesn't know. There is no indication Saul finds out about that during the course of Breaking Bad so we wouldn't find out until Better Call Saul surpasses BB's timeline, which will probably take a while, and that seems like way too much of a slow burn for that kind of storyline.  But that's just my opinion, I could be completely wrong. I mean, I get a weird feeling about Nacho too, like there's something more going on, I just don't think he's a governmental spy."
betterCallSaul,3asqqb,1TrueKingInTheNorth,18,Tue Jun 23 07:18:41 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to assume Saul ever finds out the truth about Nacho if I'm right. The audience gets to see things the characters don't all the time. Also, undercover law enforcement agents make use of the same resources they would use as actual criminals. To do otherwise would attract suspicion."
betterCallSaul,3asqqb,wtfplane,8,Tue Jun 23 07:55:51 2015 UTC,"Good points. Like I said, I've noticed something(s) off about Nacho too, so its totally plausible, I just think it's pretty unlikely.  Personally, I think the, for lack of a better term, ""weirdness"" about Nacho is just meant to show him as a sympathetic bad guy criminal, one who does it cuz he was born into it and has to do it, rather than one who wants to do it."

If he was an agent trying to build a case against Tuco and co., he wouldn't be doing other deals, he'd be more focused on Tucos doings.

The Cartel may also be on the verge of figuring out Saul Goodman is involved, & Saul can feel trouble coming, so when he is kidnapped by two strangers & sent to a ditch in the desert, Saul pleads for mercy & rats out Nacho ""no no it was Ignacio, wait Lalo didn't send you"" then it's revealed the kidnappers are Walter White & Jesse Pinkman."

Is there more of that to explore in the post-Breaking Bad Saul?  Gilligan: It does indeed give us the indication that there is more to explore about the present. That sequence in Omaha — him working at the Cinnabon, with his new name, Gene — that's pretty interesting stuff. I'd like to see more of it. We may well indeed, and I'm not going to say when.

Then the end of S3 stinger sets us up with a great present-day (or post-BB, at any rate) plotline that'll carry us through the last two seasons of the story."

In some flashback scenes in BCS he's playing a 25 year old! Not to mention, they're still 6 years away (show timeline) away from the first events of Breaking Bad.   If BCS progresses it's seasons the way BrBa did and it goes on for the next 6 seasons, then Bob Odenkirk will be almost 60yrs old the first time he meets Walter White...  My guess is that we see a quicker progression through Saul's story than the 1st season gave us. Around season 3 we get a glance-over of the events of BrBa from Saul's POV with Cranston and Aaron Paul cameos. Then a season 4,5 with Gene. Like, something along those lines."

It feels to me like the arc of the series would conclude with the former Jimmy completely broken down and reconstituted into the Saul we know, at the precipice of where he'd be when he finally met Walt. Cranston & Paul are more likely to cameo in flash forwards, since that way the events of BrBa serve to illuminate events in BCS rather than rehash themselves.  Rather than Jimmy-Walt's Saul-Gene, the arc is then about Jimmy selling his soul, riding that high for all it's worth, and finally paying for it, fading away into the nothingness we know expects him."

I don't expect many stories to take place during the Breaking Bad era, since Saul seems to be contented during this time.  I'm expecting more of the occasional needle-drop along the lines of what they've been doing with Jimmy in his 20s.  Once Jimmy reaches the phase we find him in Breaking Bad, I see the Gene timeline suddenly getting a lot more attention.  These writers have outsmarted us numerous times before, so I'm not putting it past them to find some clever way to get mileage out of the Breaking Bad era - we never once glimpsed Saul's home life, for example - but it still seems like there's a real absence of dramatic potential there.  Saul Goodman is kind of the destination rather than the journey.  And then there's whatever they have in store for Cinnabon Jimmy."

Maybe the people confuse their feelings and say the finale was bad when in fact they did not like Jimmys choice.

Having said that, the path that Jimmy takes is an illegal one and in a sense he proves his brother right, so there is no happy ending for him. However, I think the best case scenario for Jimmy is him getting arrested but reviving his fame via book/movie/news/etc...of course he will be in prison, but I think Saul would fare relatively well.

betterCallSaul,3an2xh,JaBray,17,Mon Jun 22 21:25:57 2015 UTC,Wouldnt you say chuck let his feelings take control as well? Jimmy wasn't always a saint but it was clear he was doing a lot to get his life back together. I could only imagine how tough it would be to slave away everyday going unappreciated while watching your brother be treated like a superstar as a partner.   Chuck always had it in the back of his mind that jimmy would always be slipping jimmy even though he worked hard and quietly to become a lawyer. When jimmy tried to prove him wrong he still wouldn't accept it
betterCallSaul,3an2xh,elephantrambo,-6,Sun Jun 21 21:17:06 2015 UTC,"I think it goes back to Chuck having a mental illness. Jimmy should have understood his brother's problem, gone to the big law firm and showed him he was wrong. Instead, he sees an opportunity to be who he wants to be (that's the reason he didn't take the money in the first place) and become a scumbag lawyer.  I understand that I'm preaching the high ground and saying he should have been holier than though, but Jimmy just became the person his brother KNEW he was. So even the mentally ill guy knew what was going down."
betterCallSaul,3an2xh,AdwokatDiabel,18,Sun Jun 21 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"It's not like he left his brother high and dry... He went to HHM and ensured someone would look out for him.   Shit, imagine he didn't do that? Chuck would've starved."
betterCallSaul,3an2xh,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,2,Sun Jun 21 21:28:49 2015 UTC,"The whole point is that Jimmy wasn't that guy... until Chuck's deceitfulness turned him into that. I don't think anyone's saying that going over to the dark side was the ""right thing"" for Jimmy to do, but on an emotional level, I can't blame him either. And I don't blame him for abandoning Chuck one. Little. Bit."
betterCallSaul,3an2xh,gandalfsmagicgaydick,7,Wed Jun 24 21:37:40 2015 UTC,"Jimmy had no place in the legal field to begin with and he took the short cut into a sacred field of professionals.   I would say that too... if Jimmy wasn't such a good lawyer. Plus, he genuinely tried to reform his life after Chuck bailed him out. He took it upon himself to change, to work the mailroom and still go to college and then law school. It's what he had to do to get by. I don't think he took shortcuts to get his degree, the guy worked his ass off, working a full-time job while doing so. Sure, he isn't as accomplished as Chuck & the other partners, and maybe he shouldn't have been given a chance at the beginning, but he worked that case hard. And when all Jimmy wanted to do was become a legit lawyer after proving his worth (even Howard basically said he would have hired Jimmy), Chuck still let his emotions and his high-and-mighty attitude stop his brother from getting what he earned."
betterCallSaul,3an2xh,Tischlampe,3,Tue Jun 23 01:22:22 2015 UTC,I have to disagree. You mentioned some good points but missed the whole picture.   First of all. Jimmy wanted to change and he did. Chuck saved him from his Chicago sunroof fate and from that point on Jimmy quit his old life. Moved to abq with his brother and cut his old friendships. He worked his Ass off to make chuck proud. He asked for a chance to prove himself. Chuck denied that chance. The first time was arguably the right decision. But later Jimmy proves himself to be a good lawyer. He builds the whole case. And remember that chuck missed that even though he worked on those files for Jimmy.  Jimmy admired his older brother and wanted to make him proud.   Chuck also let his feelings lead him. If intellect and calculation what chuck wanted then he should have given Jimmy the chance after the sandpiper case.   Jimmy might have turned his back to chuck but he made sure that someone would take care of him. He was rational here. Also remember what hamlin said about the list. He was astonished what Jimmy did for chuck on a daily basis.   Jimmy himself indirectly said what stopped him from taking the money Mike stole from the kettlemans. It was chuck and the desire to make him proud.   Then again. If chuck was convinced that Jimmy was a chimp with a machine gun wouldn't it have been the smart thing to keep him close? Jimmy working for Chuck would have been the best to have always an eye on Jimmy and take care that he wouldn't do some immoral stuff.   But none of this makes his decision at the end right.
betterCallSaul,3an2xh,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:25:08 2015 UTC,Chuck's mental illness was not the cause of his betrayal... his manipulative behavior toward Jimmy started years prior to that. Why should it be Jimmy's responsibility to care for a mentally ill man who mistreats him? Especially considering Chuck's wealth and the fact that the firm is obviously more than willing to step in and take care of him.

The following will happen:  *Changes his name to Saul Goodman  *Moves on from Elder law, more firmly roots himself with criminals/everyday petty criminal clients.  *We get a flashforward to Saul at his Cinnamon Bun job.He reflects on his Goodman years.  *Walter/Jesse Pinkman cameo/reference   *Mike assist Saul with his petty criminal clients and his 'odd'/shady requests by bizarre clients.  *Saul buys the Law Firm & films the ad we are all familiar with.  *Chuck & Associates are no longer seen.  *Saul convinces his ex-girlfriend to work with him. She does but is scared off by his criminal clients by Season's end.  *Tuco returns as a part-time regular.  *Mike spouts philosophy while committing questionable criminal/morally ethical acts.  *Saul answers his phone while having his hands full.  *Saul drinks coffee. *Saul hires Huell who was working at a certain fried chicken shop."

He isn't jumping into that side of the world with both feet in, even though he's committed to this path. I think this will be an ""apprenticing"" season for Jimmy, and the finale ends with deciding to market himself as Saul Goodman. It should be interesting to see how Jimmy's relationship with Kim and Chuck develop this season as well. My guess is Jimmy and Chuck try to reconcile but something drives Jimmy away for good, which becomes the impetus for the name change.  Mike will continue to pick up side jobs and should have some interesting one-off adventures to tell. He will continue his involvement with Jimmy, and a partnership will form. He should meet Fring at some point in the season and do some jobs for him, but won't leave Jimmy just yet. My sense from Breaking Bad was that Mike and Jimmy had a more established history before Mike jumped to Gus. It could happen this season but there's a lot of relationship to sell to get to that point. Right now Mike and Jimmy have merely crossed each other's paths in the grand scheme of their overall relationship."

betterCallSaul,39fy1y,_Woodrow_,0,Fri Jun 12 11:45:47 2015 UTC,Why are you claiming this theory as yours when Vince and Peter have been saying from the start that these colors represent xyz? You're simply reinterpreting what they've already created. Netflix is their distribution partner so Vince/Peter could have given permission either way.
betterCallSaul,39fy1y,leafofpennyroyal,0,Fri Jun 12 16:28:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted but I see a lot of confusion involving color symbolism so let me clear some things up, before even the first episode of BCS came out Vince & Peter had an interview with variety where they said Warm colors equal bad & cool colors equal blue.   I've been browsing this subreddit frequently and I know /u/saulspiracy wasn't the first person to bring up color symbolism as you can find older post in the archive, but most people weren't paying attention until he posted his fire & ice type theory.  Most people are unaware about that interview, but they noticed the trend of blue colors on good guy & red colors on bad guys, but the official color symbolism is warm colors vs cool colors.   Yes Netflix is their distribution partner but this video was probably done with out aknowledgement of Vince & Peter or was made without the creators, other wise there would be less emphasis on red vs blue & more about warm vs cool colors if the video was pushed by Vince & Peter.  So again people, this is not a theory, the color symbolism is true & its just not people reaching to conclusions, since the creators confirmed it in an interview & in a tweet before."

While Jimmy keeps Chuck from starving in darkness and creates the case that gets his foot back into his own door through zealous, inventive, legitimate, intelligent lawyering. Doesn't that earn Jimmy quite enough personal capital to overcome his less prestigious route to his law license?  Chuck illustrates a common attitude in the legal profession (lawyers are fleas if they don't enter the profession through top schools followed by clerkships and/or partner-track associate positions at large law firms) that is portrayed as unreasonable and unsympathetic in the present circumstance. Chuck is grotesquely arrogant and ungrateful to treat Jimmy how he has after all of this, and this is why everyone hates him.  I mean, Chuck isn't just some mustache-twirling perpetrator of random evil. The story gives us believable reasons why he thinks the way he does. But Jimmy has more than earned his way out of the shithouse and yet Chuck will never allow him to forget or escape his place in the mailroom."
betterCallSaul,39ehk5,OMGjcabomb,8,Thu Jun 11 06:16:21 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but to play Devil's advocate... let's say you interview 10 people for a lecturer position. 9 of them have degrees that would make you deem them ""worthy"" of joining your department. 1 has a somewhat questionable online graduate degree (which, for the record, I'm not sure which field you are in, but in some fields distance learning is actually an industry standard now. But, moving on...)  You interview these 10 people. The 9 who have solid academic backgrounds are okay, but nothing spectacular in terms of lecturing ability. You see many students observing the lecture in exchange for extra credit zoning out, or discreetly checking their smartphones. The person with the ""subpar"" degree, though, is the best lecturer you've ever seen-- a natural talent. The students are actually completely engaged and interested. He/she is a complete hit!   Do you still discount that person and hire one of the mediocre lecturers, simply because you look down on that person's degree?  That, I feel, is where the Chuck thing becomes relevant. Jimmy has proven himself as a completely apt and actually exemplary attorney, in spite of where his degree came from. No doubt Chuck sees many new graduates from prestigious law schools who could not come close to comparing to Jimmy's litigation skills.   A good lecturer/attorney/whatever is made of many different components. To say that someone's degree path makes you view them differently is fair. To say that even if they exceed your expectations in every other way, you'd still reject them solely because of their degree path is where things become questionable."

betterCallSaul,39ehk5,hooch,15,Thu Jun 11 17:23:21 2015 UTC,"Says the tenured college professor. What a joke, everyone knows academics and education are, as compared to other industries, the most expensive purchase for the lowest return on investment. Tenure is the worst thing to happen to education, I'd rather learn something from someone teaching for their job as opposed to tenured pompous asses who have no incentive to do a good job because there's no consequence for fucking up. Tenure goes completely against the economic principal that healthy competition in business creates better products and services. I mean really for how much people spend, acquiring a lifetime of debt, to be taught by a self righteous tenured douche like you, I feel sorry for anyone expecting any return on that investment. And yes without knowing you I can say, with a sufficient amount of certainty, that you are probably terrible at what you do, just because your tenured and odds and all that. Now down vote me into oblivion but please go research what I'm saying, because I am right, facts prove I'm right. I work in a field where I could get fired any given day if I fuck up in the right or wrong ways. That keeps me on my toes and doing the best job I can for the people paying for the services I provide. I guess the education system knows better about how to get the products and service to the people who pay for them. I mean do tenured douches not feel obligated to the people spending 40k a year, which by the way pays those teacher salaries. Nope guess not or the HR department would decide to have the best teacher regardless of age, experience, or where they went to college, as opposed to people who can't get terminated. Let me ask you something is there a way of measuring how successful you are as a college instructor? Like a way of testing how much the students have learned on the particular subject or subjects you teach? And what consequences are there for you if you fail to educate someone? Oh yeah no, no, and nothing are the answers to those questions because a college education is a rip off. Overpaying to learn skills that aren't in demand, meaning whoop-dee-friggin-doo you got a degree, now enjoy your life of debt from tuition and no jobs because you were subjectively and subliminally coerced by terrible teacher after terrible teacher that everyone could become a marine biologist and and the world will be hunky-dory. I work in one of the most in demand fields there are in the world, we can't get enough people to work in this industry. But god damnit I bet whatever college you work at has a marine biology program that is full year in and year out. I used marine biologist as an arbitrary example, just to clarify Im not assuming anyone here does marine biology, it's just an example of a field where economically, because of the lack of consumer products being produced by marine biologists, there can be more marine biologists than charity could ever pay, and there already are. So Mr Tenure it's no surprise you sympathize with Chuck, you guys are both fucked in the head. Up there on your high horse thinking your better than everyone else, fuck Chuck and fuck you buddy. Enjoy your life of tricking people into giving you money by making them think their gonna learn something useful from you. If your religious I'd be afraid of hell or purgatory or whatever, cuz I'd say what your doing isn't 2 degrees from theft.  At least everyone knows not to give the Nigerian prince money because he doesn't have the entire primary education sector pushing his propaganda. ""I devoted my life that means I'm automatically better than someone who hasn't needed the same amount of time to learn the same thing"". Sounds to me like your jealous and scared that these people are actually more talented or more intelligent than you. I welcome competition of any type in what I do because I know I'm better than %80 of my competition and if I find myself on the other side of that I take action to improve myself as opposed to taking action to prevent the success of my competitors. That's how the people paying for the service know their getting their money's worth. How would any of your former students know if they got their monies worth? and if they did not should you be held responsible because you took their money and they did not get the product or service they paid for?"

You're taking a lot of pride in the amount of hours you spent instead of the work you did. Doing shit work doesn't matter. Taking twice as long to finish a project because you're half as competent isn't a good thing. Of course in the context of Better Call Saul this is a moot point; it's clear that Jimmy was doing the degree while also doing a full time job and had no financial support either. He worked hard, he just went to a school that wasn't Harvard.   By all means, there are shit schools and shit people that are produced by them. But just because they decided to get a degree and have some semblance of a life doesn't make them any worse off."
betterCallSaul,39ehk5,K-Zone,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:11:51 2015 UTC,"And yet what you've learned in academia is the result of years of hard, independent and true passionate work from geniuses through history. Think about this: you can now enjoy making money working with knowledge that was published by many others who died alone and in poverty (or in some not-so-nice way). Would they think is fair?  Most of those with 'questionable' degrees surely don't deserve some positions. At the end, it all comes down to 'are you really prepared to do this kind of job?'. But you will also see people who actually earned what they have, even though they did not follow the same kind of preparation as you.  Let's think about Jimmy situation: he has years of social expertise. He learned and perfected his ability to read and manipulate people without any kind of teacher, facing real danger. He learns through his own ways what no academia could teach. Years pass and he wants to change, he doesn't want to be on the bad side anymore, so he studies the law. He is not as dedicated as his brother, so he gets a questionable degree. The result? a man with great social skills and some vague idea of the law.  A better lawyer will have lot's of advantage over Jimmy: good publicity doesn't come from air. It's no use to get good cases if you can't win them. But Jimmy has that: he can get great cases. And who says Jimmy can't become a great lawyer too?, practice makes perfect.   Point is: if you have a better degree, you already have and advantage over those who don't: knowledge, which is what a profession is all about after all. But sometimes, people will be better than you at other things and those other things might be very important at your job.  Also, Chuck is his brother after all. If that's the way he felt about Jimmy he should have told him before, without crushing him. That was a product of envy or feeling threatened or both. That's why Fuck Chuck."
betterCallSaul,39ehk5,Elefante_Rosa,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:56:13 2015 UTC,"In terms of OP's logic with careers in general, I agree, but Chuck's case is different, as /u/OMGjcabomb says.   If you have to hire a top-notch, fully educated professional lawyer or an online degree lawyer for a case, you'll take the pro because they literally have better experience.  A similar argument is relevant to Computer Science these days: cheap outsourcing vs. quality, more expensive employees."

I think if Chuck chose option two, tell Jimmy how it really is, he would be hurt, but if I was in Jimmy's shoes I would forgive him, I just think option 3 was the so much worse.  but I will say it is refreshing to see a different perspective than just ""Fuck Chuck"" I can understand Chuck's feelings of Jimmy not being a real Lawyer but I don't have any respect for his manipulative actions of deceiving Jimmy, although I can understand what Chuck feels, ultimately I sympathize more with Jimmy."

betterCallSaul,39ehk5,thechariot83,1 point,Mon Jun 15 22:29:45 2015 UTC,"But here's the thing: Jimmy DOES measure up. I bet Chuck wouldn't be willing to dig through a dumpster to get a case. Jimmy did just that and scored a multi-million dollar lawsuit. If anything, Jimmy is an example that a big degree isn't always what it's cracked up to be and that street smarts will get you farther than book smarts much of the time. This probably doesn't apply to all fields, but in many fields a degree often just sets you up for employment. You really learn the most important stuff from on-the-job experiences. amirite?"
betterCallSaul,39ehk5,Ternarian,0,Wed Jun 17 18:32:22 2015 UTC,"Chuck is absolutely right. Yeah Jimmy worked hard to pass his bar and become a lawyer, but he's Slippin Jimmy and took the easy way in. He didn't go to a premier college like Chuck. I completely get what Chuck was talking about."
betterCallSaul,39ehk5,DarthReilly,-2,Thu Jun 11 04:58:33 2015 UTC,"Chuck could have compromised to some degree. He could have told Jimmy he wasn't comfortable with him working in the office alongside his, but he'd be happy to have him on as 3rd party counsel for this case. If all goes well, then they could discuss matters at that point. He didn't have to sneak around his back in order to preserve Jimmy as his caretaker.  Either way, Jimmy earned a seat at the table as he found this case. He noticed the fraud in the first place, something Chuck overlooked. Chuck selfishly undermined his own family despite Jimmy taking care of him for almost 2 years and doing everything Chuck wanted from 1992 to 2002, including working in the mail room (with a good attitude), staying out of trouble and surprisingly, passing the bar.   Chuck deserves no sympathy. He's a coward for letting another man (Howard) do his bidding since he needed someone to take care of his special needs. His motivation to undermine Jimmy didn't start out with that reason in mind, but it became one of the many reasons he was hiding behind Howard.  I choose to believe that Chuck was stricken with his condition because of the bad karma earned from undermining his own brother via Howard."

Like Saul never met Hank, but if they all of a sudden showed Hank meeting Saul, that would just be too big a coincidence. It only works if the main characters of BB are in BCS as background characters. Like standing in line in front of Saul.

Going under the assumption(i dont remember exactly, would need to rewatch the show) that Hank and Saul never met and don't know each other directly in BB, there's no reason them meeting in BCS would ruin or contradict any of the already told story.  It could even serve to highlight Hank's rise through the ranks, and maybe Saul's introduction to some criminal elements.

We cant even attribute this to his condition as he was backstabbing his brother long before he became ill (and continued to do so as Jimmy was helping him out).  Screw Chuck."

Also, Chuck convinces Jimmy not to settle the case with Sandpiper for $100,000 and go for the big $20 million payday because he knows that it could be a big case for HH&M.  Chuck used Jimmy's case for his own and the firm's benefit.  Chuck is super sneaky and a total douche."

He truly loves his brother but is too selfish to let him shine because of his cowardice, he's afraid his Jimmy will ruin it all, the Mcgill name, everything he has worked so hard for. Its selfish and cowardly, borderline douchey but not entirely. Look at it if it was you, you made a big name for yourself and had a career and people who depended on you, and you're little brother is out pulling scams and cheating people, then walks in and says ""hey I'm in the same business as you now, you should hook me up with a job"" but swears he's changed, wouldn't you be apprehensive? At that point if he let Jimmy work for them as a lawyer and he gets caught doing something shady, it could take down the whole law firm. Maybe Chuck just knows Jimmy a lot better than we do."

He absolutely does know Jimmy a lot better than we do, and I think that's something most of us aren't really taking into account. I'm not saying Chuck isn't still selfish and cowardly, but Jimmy is his friggin' brother! Chuck has known him for literally decades. He has seen and experienced things with Jimmy we will never know. Ever. Who knows what vast number of memories and experiences Chuck is drawing from when he's forming his opinion on Jimmy? I don't know, and certainly never will, but I won't deny that Chuck, at the very least, has credibility on the matter."

How is it not douchier for Chuck to pretend to be the supportive brother while sniping at his brother's career from the shadows, allowing somebody else (Hamlin) to be the boogeyman?  Chuck wanted to obstruct Jimmy's career and enjoy being the guy his brother looked up to.  That's doucheyness extremus."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,FatherDude,7,Fri Jun 5 13:51:31 2015 UTC,"Chuck and Jimmy are very different styles of lawyer, too, and that probably rubs Chuck the wrong way.  Chuck is an absolute walking encyclopedia of information and a total rockstar powerhouse of a presence, if you're up against Chuck and he wants to screw you, you know you're pretty fucked.    Jimmy's more the quick-witted, think-on-his feet guy who beats you without you expecting it or even knowing you got beat.  I can see Chuck thinking his way is the only ""right"" way to be a lawyer."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,Asshole_Salad,3,Fri Jun 5 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"I think this is a huge part of it -- Chuck doesn't want to admit that Jimmy has many traits that give him a natural aptitude as a lawyer -- particularly with dealing with people. Chuck completely sucks at dealing with people but Jimmy was good enough that the client's didn't even want to deal with HHM, only him."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,JQuilty,3,Sat Jun 6 06:32:29 2015 UTC,"I have a theory based on your post, that Chuck's fake disease is a manifestation of his guilt for screwing over Jimmy.

betterCallSaul,38mvmg,TheWalkingManiac,38,Fri Jun 5 21:04:44 2015 UTC,"Can you really blame Chuck for being a douche, though? I get that Jimmy has changed (somewhat, he still has that Slippin' Jimmy state of mind), but when you're so close to a person who perpetually disappoints you, it's hard to believe any change is permanent. For all Chuck knows, Jimmy is running the long con with a mail order law degree.  So yes, Chuck is a douche, but it's hard for people so close to a grifter to truly believe a positive change is real and permanent."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,MissesDreadful,13,Fri Jun 5 06:44:12 2015 UTC,"But that's not chuck's complaint. He's not worried about James' running a con. He's mad because he (chuck) worked hard to get his degree, he worked hard to make his firm what it is. And jimmy just did a mail order degree, he's not a real lawyer. Chuck isn't worried about being dissapointed, he's worried that his brother the screw up might not be a screw up anymore. He's worried he'll lose his status as better than jimmy."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,Noone666,15,Fri Jun 5 07:28:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's both, professional pride as well as a sneaky suspicion that Jimmy would eventually fall back into his old ways. Had he really been that upset about his working for his degree vs. the work Jimmy did, he wouldn't have been so supportive about Jimmy getting into elderly law and the class action suit."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,MissesDreadful,8,Fri Jun 5 08:11:00 2015 UTC,"None of that is really what makes Chuck a douche, though.  It's the fact that instead of telling Jimmy how he felt right away, he pretended to be his support system for something like a decade while assigning Hamlin to be Jimmy's bad guy.  We come to find out that seeking his brother's approval was a big motivating factor for Jimmy, so it's a massive emotional betrayal.  If Chuck's outburst in ""Pimento"" was going to happen, it should have happened ten years before when Jimmy told him he passed the bar."

betterCallSaul,38mvmg,Noone666,5,Fri Jun 5 11:48:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, that doesn't hold true at all. I've heard the expression ""you know what they call the guy who gets all C's in Med School? A doctor"" and it couldn't be farther from the truth for lawyers.   First requirement stated on many job postings is a ""top tier"" law school. Sometimes top 50, usually top 25, and for the big law jobs they won't entertain resumes that don't come from a top 5 or top 10 law school. The second requirement? Class ranking... top 5 to top 10% of the class preferred. Then comes law review (need to be in the top 1/3 at most schools to even be considered) or moot court experience. Judicial Clerkships (again only granted to top students) are a feather in the cap of any resume.   There are some exceptions, in VA you don't need to have graduated from law school to sit for the bar, etc. But the mail order or online law school is another story and would black list almost anyone from getting a job.   The second, and more important point that /u/missesdreadful sort of alluded to, and in my own experience is an absolute truth, is that most high powered attorneys and every single judge I've met or worked with holds the law in the HIGHEST regard. Yeah, Jimmy may have changed, but at one point he spit in the face of the rules and procedure they hold to be incredibly sacred. In real life, there is a character and fitness interview before you can be admitted into any state bar... traffic tickets and bad credit sometimes prevent you from being granted admittance, let alone a real criminal record. Sometimes one time offenses, DUIs or drug possessions, are not a bar to entry, however crimes of deception and ""moral turpitude"" are almost always non-starters.  All this said, Chuck goes about acting on these opinions and regards in the most cowardly and bullshit ways possible. Especially when dealing with his brother. You make your feelings known in this regard immediately and forthright.   edit:spelling"

The vast vast number of JDs in this country do the meat and potatoes work of writing wills, defending DUIs and so on. I know more than enough absolute crooks practicing law."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,redundanteater,3,Fri Jun 5 17:55:23 2015 UTC,"Your first statement is correct, but whether or not you are a lawyer is a minor detail in whether or not you will even be considered for a job at a large, reputable firm. I can almost certainly guarantee that those lawyers you speak of are solos with their faces on bus stop benches, and not working in a prestigious biglaw firm as Hamlin & McGill is supposed to be. I graduated near the top of my class, I have no criminal record, I have a judicial clerkship, I even have a legal post doctorate called an LLM... yet because of my school (outside of the top Tier I of law schools) I couldn't get interviews with firms like DLA Piper, Pilsbury, etc. without knowing someone there.   The ""in"" jimmy has at Hamlin & McGill thinks he is a crook."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,OsNBohs,3,Fri Jun 5 20:08:48 2015 UTC,"Chuck was probably the one who kept Jimmy's moral turpitude INvisible.

Chuck even convinced himself that he has the reaction to electromagnetic waves and did so convincingly that he lives in the dark.

betterCallSaul,38mvmg,ietsrondsofzo,2,Fri Jun 5 10:12:00 2015 UTC,"It's definitely human for Chuck to have done that, but it's also selfish assholery.  Disappointing Jimmy right away would have been considerably more courteous than being a two-face for so long."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,FatherDude,3,Fri Jun 5 14:05:26 2015 UTC,"I think a couple of things are in play here, but Chuck loves Jimmy, and Jimmy is no doubt a life long fuck up of the highest order. Part of the dynamic I see is that Chuck is a bit older than Jimmy and as much as he is an older brother to Jimmy he is also like or sees himself as a father to Jimmy. I don't know if their father is or was an influence on them but this is the classic instance of an older over achiever followed by a younger under achiever. Chuck is like the parent of a ""black sheep"" or ""fuck up "" who will always love Jimmy but see him as such because from his perspective Jimmy on the straight and narrow is a very recent development not be trusted after a very long run of being a bad/immoral person and criminal.   Jimmy is a junkie and his drug of choice is finding a scam or the easy way out, cutting corners. Jimmy wanting to be a lawyer is fine with Chuck. Jimmy being a good high paid lawyer is fine too, but Chuck will never let Jimmy into the family business. You don't let your junkie brother work behind the counter at the family drug store just because he stayed clean for a few years and got through pharmacy school in Guadalajara. Jimmy, time after time in Chuck's mind, has ""shit where he eats,"" both figuratively and literally, and Chuck will not let that chaos into his family business, nor should he.   Also lets not forget even if Jimmy was let into HHM, he has multiple shady, illegal and dangerous things going on all of which are of his own doing. How well would it go over if the real story of the Kettlemans came out or if Nacho dropped by the office. Hell what if the Philly cops came by to talk about Mike?  Chuck was a passive aggressive pussy for not telling Jimmy straight I out, ""I love you, I know you are turning your life around but I want you to be on the straight and narrow a long time before I trust you with working as a lawyer for me."" That is all he had to do. But he didn't own it and Jimmy didn't fuck up big enough and get caught to go to jail. He could have but stayed one step ahead of the law. Also let me add, Chuck betting that Jimmy would mess up and make hiring him at a later date moot was pretty safe bet.   Bottom line Chuck is right to keep Jimmy away from HHM but should have owned rejecting him from the start, that was his mistake and it could be argued he did it out of love. Jimmy becomes Saul because he was always Saul/Slipping Jimmy. What I saw at the end of the last episode was he finally accepted who he is and stopped running from it and hiding and decides to own it. He stops trying to be Chuck and is just himself. Also Jimmy is the hero/anti-hero like Walt was but just like Walt he is not a guy you would want in your life. While he isn't yet a monster like Walt, he is not a good person. Chuck is the good person, he only appears bad because from Jimmy's perspective he is keeping him from cutting another corner, that he should be allowed to cut. From Chuck's perspective he will never trust Jimmy enough to help him in that way.   Also I know people will bring up that Jimmy was taking care of Chuck. Again this is a recent development. If Chuck doesn't get Jimmy out of jail and beat the wrap for him Jimmy is at best in Cicero living a sex offender. At worst he is prison as a petty thief and con man serving a stretch as a sex offender. So I think they are even.  tl;dr Chuck has been cleaning up Jimmy's messes too long to trust him and he is still doing things like Slippin Jimmy as far as Chuck can see and is concerned."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,newswilson,5,Fri Jun 5 13:13:13 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best explanation for the complexities at play here. I think Chuck is going to be an analog to what Skylar was in Breaking Bad (although not necessarily following the same course or to that extreme). I remember hating Skylar at first because she was set up in opposition to Walt, who we were predisposed to be sympathetic to.   As Walt's true nature was revealed, so did my feelings about Skylar change. Her distrust of Walt turned out to be well founded the more we saw of his dark side. Like Chuck, she only saw isolated pieces of Walt's behavior, where we saw everything.  We see Jimmy trying to do the right thing in most cases, but we have no way of knowing (yet) how many times he has tried and fallen back into old patterns in the past. To our perspective, we see that Jimmy is genuine in his desire to change, but Chuck doesn't see those moments we do. Those moments where Jimmy wrestles with his conscience.  Chuck has insulated himself from being burned by Jimmy again, but in doing so took a very dishonest approach. That's really the only way I could see him being a bad person and even that has its shades of gray. We all assume we would have the nerve to just come right out and say something potentially hurtful to a loved one, but it's not always an easy thing to do."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,newswilson,4,Fri Jun 5 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"Yup. Plus, the only way he gets an interview, let alone a job at HHM when he first passes the bar is if Chuck intervenes. So he is a bad guy for not breaking his brother's heart personally and telling him he cant work at the firm? Yeah its shitty but again, this is drug addict brother who tells you he graduated correspondence pharmacy school and wants to be upgraded from stock boy to junior pharmacist. No way in hell. As for the second bite at the apple for HHM to hire him, Chuck is trapped in his house and the only real world indication he has of how Jimmy has been operating is the stunt with billboard that Jimmy tried to keep from him by not bringing him the paper. That was Slippin Jimmy all the way. Slippin Jimmy doesn't get an office next to Chuck at HHM a couple of months later just because he lucked up on a class action suit."

betterCallSaul,38mvmg,Asshole_Salad,1 point,Fri Jun 5 11:45:13 2015 UTC,We know it went back 18 months but I don't believe we know for sure when the mailroom/cake scene happens - but it was probably shortly after Jimmy went into Chuck's office and announced that he passed the bar.  I think it's safe to assume his condition started after Jimmy was rejected from HHM so your guilt-complex theory looks plausible.
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,Spidora19,3,Fri Jun 5 20:27:24 2015 UTC,The best I can offer is this: We don't know how awful Slippin' Jimmy really was. How many times did Chuck have to come rescue him? Chuck obviously has a very low opinion of Jimmy. But did Jimmy earn that reputation? Aren't we dealing with TWO scumbags here?
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,mariokartmaster64,3,Fri Jun 5 12:38:59 2015 UTC,"The thing that most people don't know is that nepotism is very looked down upon in law firms. I didn't go to law school but my boss did and we had a nice talk about this show recently. Law firms are incredibly competitive and he as saying a school like American Samoa is a tier 3 school and nobody from those schools will ever get a job at any law firm ever, and their degree is basically a waste of money. So Jimmy went to a school that no law firms would even accept a degree from, on top of nepotism in law firms being insanely looked down upon. It's not like other businesses where you can be the owner and just give your son, brother, etc his own store or management position. Most lawyers I'm sure feel exactly as Chuck feels: Jimmy is not a real lawyer. Not at all."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,ThriceOnSundays,3,Fri Jun 5 15:52:34 2015 UTC,"As someone who is reasonably responsible and has a fuck-up of a younger brother, I can relate to Chuck.  I love my brother and want him to be successful.  Early on I would vouche for him and try to get him chances because he'd tell me that he's changing his life, and he let me down.  He even lied right to my face to use my position of authority to try to weasle out a mistake.  (long story, not super interesting).  At that point I decided I would NOT ever vouche for him again or put myself on the line to do him a favor.  Will I do him favors personally?  Yes.  Do I want him to succeed? Yes.  But will I ever bet my career or be a positive reference in a job setting?  NO.  He's a bad bet who's burned me in the past.  I wouldn't hire my brother for anything - but I hope he changes and gets his crap together.  And here's the thing, I do not want to constantly bring it up with my brother, because THAT would be a dick move ""Hey bro, I hope you succeed, but I'll never be a good reference for you and if anyone asks I'll tell them not to hire you.""  Yes, he's being a coward by hiding behind Hamlin, but he's doing that to protect Jimmy's feelings.  Chuck isn't a bad guy and he does want Jimmy to succeed.  He just doesn't think the odds are good and he's been burned backing him in the past."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,ThriceOnSundays,2,Fri Jun 5 19:10:18 2015 UTC,Okay but why didn't he tell him that?   He had Hamlin do his dirty work.That's cowardly.
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,Buxbaum89,3,Fri Jun 5 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's cowardly.  But that doesn't make chuck a huge douchebag, it makes him want to avoid conflict, which is what more people than not would do.  Plus, telling Jimmy the truth undermines Chuck's ability to help Jimmy.  I think Chuck truly does want Jimmy to succeed, he just doesn't want to have his own image tarnished when Jimmy fails - which Chuck rightly thinks is the most likely scenario.  Chuck was really encouraging of Jimmy taking public defense cases, because it gave him a chance to succeed apart from Chuck.  That's what Chuck most wants."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,Neverwish,3,Fri Jun 5 20:00:57 2015 UTC,"I completely understand all of Chuck's actions. He worked his butt off to get a law degree and get a position at the law firm, while Jimmy (seemingly without much effort) found an easier way to get the same degree.   I'm in grad school, and it's absolutely terrible. It's a lot of work, and I hate it. If my brother found a way to get the same degree as me without suffering through five years of grad school awfulness, I would be livid. I wouldn't feel like getting him a job at my company either. And my brother doesn't even scam people! I can't even imagine how mad I'd be if my brother found shortcuts where I couldn't AND was a law-bending scam artist."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,NormSonOfAGunderson,2,Fri Jun 5 19:31:12 2015 UTC,Why would we want to convince you of that? Fuck Chuck.
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,NormSonOfAGunderson,2,Fri Jun 5 10:26:39 2015 UTC,"Well put yourself in Chuck's shoes.  The law has been his passion for probably most of his life.  He's worked and worked and worked to accomplish everything he has accomplished.  Then Jimmy essentially just does it half fast and is still Slippin Jimmy but as a lawyer (as mentioned by Chuck). I would think the one thing that Chuck doesn't like about Jimmy is that he's a scam artist in everything he does.    Think about it, the fake secretary voice, the lying about his office being redecorated, the fake billboard rescue, etc.  Every thing he does is a scam.  And Chuck got to a point long ago with Jimmy where he grew tired of that side of him. While I see some wrong on Chuck's side too, I can definitely understand some of his feelings.  All he wants is for his brother to make an honest living and be an honest person.  As a mail room employee is fine, as long as he does it honestly.  But now he is not only still acting like slippin Jimmy, he's doing it in a way that offends Chuck's profession which Chuck takes personal."

betterCallSaul,38mvmg,_Woodrow_,2,Fri Jun 5 16:08:12 2015 UTC,"Chuck is having trouble separating Slippin' Jimmy from the man his brother was trying to become.  He strikes me as someone who's been burned one too many times.  I have a hard time blaming him for being skeptical.  That said, instead of manning up and telling his brother that he doesn't want him working there, he hides behind Hamlin and turns him into the bad guy.  He does it twice, at two integral points in his brother's life.  It's especially frustrating the second time because it's after Jimmy showed Chuck just how good of a lawyer he could be.  That's where the hate comes in.  And in this case, I do think it's well-deserved.  It's his fault for not manning up that Jimmy becomes what we know he becomes."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,JonathanL72,2,Fri Jun 5 13:26:50 2015 UTC,Meh.  I think Chuck is mostly just a plot device.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of thought behind him.
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,KidCasey,2,Fri Jun 5 19:15:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he isn't a douche, but it is much more nuanced than you are spelling out here. Chuck is being very true-to-life in his behaviour compared to the way a lot of older siblings look at their younger siblings. Your view of them is so cemented in your childhood (and early adulthood) that it is impossible to shake.   My Grandmother and her siblings (she was second oldest of 6) would joke around about how Betty (the baby) never had to do any work on the farm and had an easy life and they were in their eighties. My sister still views me as the irresponsible burnout I was right after high school graduation even though I am arguably more ""together"" than she is now and we are both middle aged.   The ""idea"" you have of your family members is really hard to shake because there is so much history behind it."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,Brandeis,2,Fri Jun 5 19:30:39 2015 UTC,"I think Chuck's an asshole & I'm on Jimmy's side but if I try to look at it from Chuck's perspective in an attempt to justify his actions, the Law is something that Chuck has a deep respect for, its ""sacred"" to him, and here comes his ex-con brother who now has a law degree, Chuck worked his ass off to get to where he wants & he feels like his brother is ""taking shortcuts""  I personally think Chuck's mentality is similar to maybe how a musicians works hard to be successful from making good music, while another music-artist is just using gimmicks or trends to get to the top.  But ultimately I think Chuck is horrible for manipulating everybody around him and holding his brother back."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,Bannan_ruler,2,Fri Jun 5 20:33:20 2015 UTC,"Chuck is just looking out for his law firm that he took years and years to build a rock-solid reputation for. A reputation he built on years and years of (likely) outstanding law school performance and hard work.  For more than half his life Jimmy was robbing people, cheating the system, and shitting in people's cars. Now really ask yourself, would you take someone like this seriously, even if they were your brother? I will admit that I am a little callous, but I wouldn't even talk to my brother at that point in time.  Chuck was gracious enough to give him a mailroom job to keep him out of trouble after getting him out of trouble, likely multiple times, putting his own reputation on the line. Then one day Jimmy shows up and says, ""Hey I got a law degree through the mail. I passed the bar, but failed it twice. Gimme a job.""   Chuck doesn't want Jimmy to know he thinks he's a joke. Who would tell their little brother that? So he has Hamlin do it.   Also, the way in which Jimmy practices is more or less skirting the system. It is apparent that Chuck holds the law in the highest regard. How would you like it if someone was cheating their way through something you held most dear?   The only thing I can really blame Chuck for is never telling Jimmy over the years. I get not doing it in the beginning, but he should've at some point."

It's not a bad thing or a good thing, it's just the way they wanted it to end up.  In the beginning, you were expected to believe it was Hamlin who was the douchebag, but the writers played the switcharoo.    And they could reverse it next season if they wanted to.  What if Chuck was really intuitive and knew his brother really well.  He saw into the future where his brother turned out to be Saul Goodman.  He knew a lawyer like Saul would inevitably end up working alongside the most dangerous criminals in North America.    He was terrified his brother was going to be killed by these same criminals, or maybe end up in Witness Protection.  He didn't want his brother living a life looking over his shoulder all day long.  So out of compassion---out of love for his brother, he tried everything he could to prevent him from becoming a lawyer and then turning into Saul.  And in that scenario, Chuck is a good guy again."
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,snowlarbear,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:17:48 2015 UTC,"You see him as a douchebag because he's connected to Jimmy.  Chuck is disturbingly alike normal businessmen and lawyers - within his environment, one cannot tell how wrong he is.  That's part of the game, dude.  Chuck plays his game without knowing it's a game, while Jimmy plays knowing it is a game.  The differences in character are so apparent in light of this that you could almost equate Chuck to a drug dealer...  See where I'm going with this?"
betterCallSaul,38mvmg,romafa,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:36:34 2015 UTC,Jimmy Saul is going back to the path of Slipping Jimmy because of his lack of brotherly support.  If Chuck really cared for Jimmy he would have accepted him into Hamlin and McGill because people that truly care for other people lift each other up.  Chucki's motivation's for rescuing Jimmy were selfish in the first place.

Jimmy, who is smart himself, said so much (narration?).  What makes the show so compelling is we want him to be a success, but if it is truly something Jimmy wanted he would do it. Some people may argue that Chuck’s influence, his approval was lacking and vilify him, but if you think about, it’s a fairly realistic scenario, that being a family member having a seeming cemented opinion of you. It’s like being a slacker and your parents bugging you about it, despite the fact that you now have been promoted, are doing well for yourself etc and then taking their opinion and not care anymore, come in late, lose your job…. Well in that case you just proved them right! That’s what Jimmy did - he proved Chuck right and he could have just took the offer, took the fame, the partnership nd success and then waited for chuck to come around or not, because despite Chuck’s approval he did it and it’s an absolute success. Likewise, if you keep on your course and become more successful, your parents may say “well Jimmy’s a success now” or not and at that point it doesn’t matter because you did it."

Chuck needs Jimmy to be Slippin Jimmy because then Chuck will still have the ""Jimmy is a screw up and I'm the smart one with my life in check which makes me the better brother"" thing. Once Jimmy starts proving himself as a great lawyer Chuck goes ""Aw shit he might be as smart or even smarter than I am. So what about me? Am I the shitty brother?"".

During better call Saul you see him take bribes, steal notes from police officers, hire Mike to break into people's houses, hire skateboarders to jump in the way of cars, stage rescues at billboards and con people with that fat guy. In breaking bad you see him covering up murders like Janes for example or advising Walt and Jesse to kill people, working with meth lords like Walt and Gus, helping them launder money, knowingly working with thugs like Huell and Bill burr and killers like Mike and finding them work etc. Sure you can say Jimmy wouldn't have done any of that if his brother would have gave him a job at the good lawfirm but.... Really? Someone needs to hand him a job at a prestigious lawfirm in order for him not to become a central figure in a multimillion dollar meth ring? Honestly What type of shit is that. There are millions of lawyers out there putting in work trying to get big, Chuck didn't have anyone hand him shit he put in work, Hamlin didn't have anyone hand him shit he put in work, that blonde lady put in work, she even found Jimmy a job at a different firm and Jimmy turned it down (I think) everyone who works their way up has to rough it for a bit Jimmy couldn't though anytime it gets hard he does something illegal or shady.  Chuck knows Jimmy everything he said to Jimmy when Jimmy found out was right and the fact that Jimmy is the way he is in breaking bad proves it.  Jimmy is fun and that's why we like him but honestly if we met Jimmy at a bar he would probably con us out of our money like he did many times before and now because Chuck calls him on his bullshit and wasn't about to help Jimmy use the law to fuck people over he is bad?

betterCallSaul,38fsfh,alexguersman,12,Wed Jun 3 22:44:30 2015 UTC,"It seems they're taking personality traits from men whose deaths the characters feel personally responsible for. Crazy 8 and Fring were clearly Walt's doing; Marco died while he and Jimmy are conning the town, and Jimmy may feel at least a little guilt for the death. IIRC it was Jimmy's idea to do the watch con that night.  Although the kneeling example, I believe, is a coincidence. Fring knelt once in the bathroom, which was to vomit the poison in the cartel party scene. Walt knelt in the bathroom the entire series due to chemo."
betterCallSaul,38fsfh,jt4,17,Wed Jun 3 23:31:24 2015 UTC,It wasn't the kneeling that was similar it was the placing of a folded hand towels in front of the toilet that was the trait Walt took from Gus.
betterCallSaul,38fsfh,diddletheskittle,-1,Thu Jun 4 00:10:55 2015 UTC,How did Walt know Gus did that? (He didn't.) This is an example of the audience knowing more than Walt.  A more fitting Gus comparison would be Walt's friendly rhetoric at the Car Wash when Lydia shows up as well as the Volvo.
betterCallSaul,38fsfh,hajisquickvanish,32,Thu Jun 4 00:30:45 2015 UTC,He didn't know. Walt isn't consciously taking their traits. It's symbolism by the writers to show how Walt is similar to Gus.
betterCallSaul,38fsfh,Guiyze,3,Thu Jun 4 03:40:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm... Sorry, but imo the Gus kneeling thing is a weak connection to Walt, for several reasons. To start, the show had already extensively compared the two men, and the conclusion was that the similarity was surface, and in fact they 'weren't alike at all'. In season 2 Walt fancies himself he is similar to Gus (before meeting him, based entirely on Saul's words of being skiddish and careful and above board, which Walt wants for himself but doesn't have), and the show takes explicit care in dispelling this hope for similarity upon Gus's intro ('you are not a cautious man'). Do you really think that 2 seasons later during a climactic fight, the show would consciously and vaguely emphasize Gus's similarities to Walt again? It doesn't make any sense to refer to Walt at all in that sequence.. Gus with towel in the bathroom was a simple single-character juxtaposition of etiquette and deadly force, not unlike the tie-straightening juxtaposing calmness in death. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.  The sandwich thing on the other hand (and to a lesser extent the rocks / no rocks whiskey thing and perhaps the Volvo too), is a stronger and explicit device, as it deals with conscience, perhaps the biggest theme of all in BB. In these cases, Walt is aware of these traits of others he is taking on, we see him witness them in others.. Krazy 8 asked specifically for Walt to prepare the food like that when Walt was actually being an admirable person.. then Walt kills him, feels bad, tortures himself with the crustless habit. BB doesn't do loose connections, it is explicit. This is also why Walt keeps the 'eye' of the bear, cause he feels terrible about the plane crash & doesn't know how to self-dialogue to come to terms any other way than the ominous self-reminder. Anyway sorry to rant, the towel thing is circumstantial, lots of people don't like kneeling on tile. What the show does do consciously, is make Walt aspire to Gus and his lack of impulse, e.g. 'chemistry must be respected' speech in Gus's Pollos office. Thoughts welcome"
betterCallSaul,38fsfh,Rattrap551,9,Thu Jun 4 19:44:02 2015 UTC,They made it a point to show both of them do it and it's an odd thing to do so I thought it might have a little significance.
betterCallSaul,38fsfh,diddletheskittle,-1,Thu Jun 4 00:36:16 2015 UTC,Taking on the traits of someone you've killed only makes sense if you've actually seen that person perform a particular trait such as Mike drinking his whiskey with ice or Krazy-8 removing the crust from his sandwiches. He never saw Gus do that toilet routine. This was simply a wink and a nod to the audience as we know more than Walt does.
betterCallSaul,38fsfh,hajisquickvanish,1 point,Thu Jun 4 23:52:45 2015 UTC,"It's a figure of style in narration. Just like the pink teddy bear standing for Jesse Pinkman's loss of innocence. Walter took that characteristic from Gus even though he didn't know it. It doesn't have to make sense, it's a metaphorical way to show Walter become more ruthless as he fights those who are ruthless."

betterCallSaul,38fsfh,mattzach84,2,Thu Jun 4 04:38:18 2015 UTC,"I think that based on the conversation with Jesse from ""Ozymandias"", Walt's own perspective is that he did in fact kill her.

To me, the nail to Jimmy McGill's coffin will be him changing his name. Even though in BrBA he said "" the jew thing I just do for the homeboys"", I see it as a final act of distancing himself from Chuck and being the ""criminal"" lawyer as we see. In better Call Saul's season 1, we have seen him trying hard to build a name for himself,    I don't think he will easily let those effort go to waste. That's why I believe the name change will be the last nail for him to be Saul Goodman in BrBA."

That's when he said ""Fuck this. Ethics schmethics. The world is a shitty place"".  I've been there. (EDIT: I am there)  And in the same episode, we learn that Mike's daughter-in-law has more financial problems than Mike had thought, so Mike does what he has to do, which is shown in that vague phone call he made.

betterCallSaul,37yea9,HiMyNameIsLaura,154,Sun May 31 13:14:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's necessarily the case, he is trained and well practiced, also he does a lot of research to know when he will need one. And after losing his son and getting revenge like that there's nothing really bad that could happen to him. He carries a gun in BB because he's simply in a more dangerous situation in BB, protecting himself and his associates from more dangerous people.   Tl:Dr: He simply knows when he does and doesn't need one."
betterCallSaul,37yea9,Banger91,48,Sun May 31 13:36:58 2015 UTC,You nailed it. Mike specifically explained that he had researched all the players and knew exactly what was at stake. If his research showed a gun was needed then he would have carried a gun. He has already killed for revenge and is activally seeking criminal jobs so the only reason he seems less dangerous is that he has not been in a situation he deemed dangerous so he is being chill.
betterCallSaul,37yea9,Creabhain,8,Sun May 31 15:28:20 2015 UTC,"There's also a legal standpoint of not carrying a gun when doing something illegal, because if you don't need one and you're caught, you may be charged with more than one crime.

It might be as simple as the fact that he hasn't gotten around to getting himself a CCW permit, and he didn't want to risk getting caught with a firearm he wasn't allowed to carry. We know later he gets more established as Gus's security advisor and gets PI licenses and CCW permits."
betterCallSaul,37yea9,Uristmcdurr,3,Sun May 31 13:49:45 2015 UTC,"The only reason he has a CCW permit is to make his ""corporate security"" bullshit look legit.

Mike never kills a good guy, he never does anything exceptionally wrong, he's just a man with a job.  Edit Changed wording a bit for clarity - point remained Mike, not a bad dude. His not being a bad dude is why I think he liked Jessie so much and why Jessie wasn't killed."

betterCallSaul,37yea9,Slabbo,3,Thu Jun 4 14:55:21 2015 UTC,"So I'm guessing something really fucking bad happens as consequence of Mike not packing.   Nothing has to happen to make Mike decide to pack. He was a Philadelphia cop for 20+ years (judging by his age), and he's seen some shit. He has the stoic personality of a lot of military and Law Enforcement veterans I have known in my life.  Mike has already ""snapped."" That was when his son died. He had seen the worst side of human nature for the majority of his life, so by the time the BCS timeline comes around, the dude is already a stone-cold, professional, killer. I say professional because he doesn't kill out of spite or emotion, he just does it because it's his job to do it."

I still think it's a pretty stupid thing to do and he should have just taken one just in case. It really doesn't feel like a realistic thing to have him do, IMO. His explanation for why he wouldn't need one makes sense but only really establishes he probably wasn't going to need one and I think it's just really foolish of him to have gone without one.

betterCallSaul,37o5lx,tkeiy714,-2,Fri May 29 08:45:14 2015 UTC,So...the DEA was after Heisenberg ultimately. With Walt dying they had nobody to bring charges against for the meth. Which means they don't do any digging and find the connections. Everything gets pinned on Walt. There's no investigation so there's no reason for them to be arrested.
betterCallSaul,37o5lx,itsfineitsgreat,18,Fri May 29 11:47:20 2015 UTC,"I dont mean to be rude, (I really dont) but thats stupid.   Even before Walt died the feds are going to want to investigate every tiny aspect of his life. He isn't just some low level street dealer after all, he's the mysterious Heisenberg they have been searching for for the past 2 years And two DEA agents are missing. The feds are going to want to talk to any and everyone even remotely connected to him- including his lawyer  And no police investigation just up and stops because the main suspect is dead. ESPECIALLY Heisenberg. The cops wont just brush aside that Walt died in a giant meth lab, and at least 5 other people on the scene where violently killed. That crime scene alone will trigger a massive police investigation.  Imo, the feds and the public are probably going to want Someone to pay for Heisenberg's destruction-and if they cant get him or his partner (Jesse)- imo, they will go after anyone they can, including Heisenberg's other partner- his lawyer Saul Goodman."
betterCallSaul,37o5lx,tkeiy714,2,Fri May 29 16:38:19 2015 UTC,"Even if that were true, there's a length of time between Walt and Saul disappearing and Walt being killed.  There's nothing that says Saul couldn't be arrested in that time."
betterCallSaul,37o5lx,itsfineitsgreat,4,Fri May 29 16:43:40 2015 UTC,Watch the first scene of Better Call Saul...he wasn't arrested.
betterCallSaul,37o5lx,tkeiy714,3,Fri May 29 16:54:00 2015 UTC,Is a time frame ever given for that? Or are we just assuming it takes places after the BB finale?
betterCallSaul,37o5lx,itsfineitsgreat,5,Fri May 29 16:56:32 2015 UTC,"I'll play ball... there could be a warrant for Saul Goodman's arrest, but it was never carried through as Saul got a new identity at the same time as Walt and was relocated. Jimmy/Saul/Gene was not arrested."
betterCallSaul,37o5lx,tkeiy714,6,Fri May 29 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is that he could be arrested the very next morning of the day shown in that flash forward that opened the series.  And they could ask ""where is Walter White?""   Because as far as I know, nothing indicated that that was after Walt was killed at all.  I mean, we all assume it is (me included), but there's nothing that contradicts Saul sitting there watching TV as Walt is driving from New Hampshire to New Mexico, is there?"
betterCallSaul,37o5lx,itsfineitsgreat,4,Fri May 29 17:05:06 2015 UTC,No they couldn't. The cleaner wouldn't be very good if he couldn't make people disappear. This is just reaching. Saul said he'd be lucky to be managing a cinnabon in Omaha and that's exactly what happened. He wasn't arrested.
betterCallSaul,37o5lx,tkeiy714,7,Fri May 29 17:10:35 2015 UTC,"??  I'm just saying it's very possible that the series ends with Saul being arrested, while Walter is still alive. There's zero that indicates that his flashforward takes place after Walt dies.  That's all I'm saying.  People are acting like the flashforward is after Walter died and while that's likely, it's not at all confirmed."

How'd you decide to throw that Bad shout out in?  It actually kind of worked when we started developing his backstory as Slippin' Jimmy. We thought he must have taken a lot of bad hits on the ice of Chicago and he probably messed up his knees falling down all the time.

betterCallSaul,37gjdb,silviod,6,Wed May 27 13:45:17 2015 UTC,"Your diatribe reads like a very typical response to hype.  Someone will not like something simply because it's well revered. You use the word ""baffled"" twice. You're BAFFLED that people like this show? No, you're not.   You're an auteur. We get it. Good for you. Tip your fedora forward and have a swig of mountain dew."
betterCallSaul,37gjdb,FullBearMode,2,Thu May 28 20:19:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I don't plan on changing your views. There is something about Breaking Bad that makes it a mass appeal. It is brilliant, and compelling. You feel like you need more and more. BCS comes along, and it has two major BB characters (and a minor) in the first episode alone. BB is brilliant by itself and appeals to two of the MAJOR types of audience:    People who go batshit for character development  People who like big budget action movies    Okay so on this archetype I personally fall into the first category. In BB we have the constant decline of Walt's character. The show carefully and concisely depicts every single choice Walter White makes and purposefully shows how every important person reacts and is affected by his actions and choices. But instead of just being a regular male who is in a moral downslope, he has the big budget action hero plot of a drug dealer AND the perfect setup as being a regular Joe so the audience can relate to him. He faces villains like Gus, who is a perfect balance of ZERO character development (until later, when the timing is perfect). Jesse provides a bit of humor and is also a relatable character, going from sleazey 20-something to in-over-his-head. The archetype is perfect and has the ability to appeal to multiple types of viewers at a lot of different age ranges.   BCS is fundamentally different because it lacks the insanity of the drug dealer lifestyle and trades for a milder Jimmy who is just trying to get by. Type 2 audience will not be satisfied by this. Type 1 audience will continue to go batshit for the rise and fall of Jimmy. Odenkirk is perfect at playing this part and portraying every emotion realistically while still keeping to Saul's one dimension shown on Breaking Bad. The point that BCS became more than just a companion show for me was the Mike backstory episode.   I don't mean to sound like a douche, but heres my TD;LR- BCS is a more complex version of the BB archetype and has the ability to surpass it on performance and character development alone, but will not satisfy those who need a more stressful and action packed plot."

betterCallSaul,37gjdb,PlacidBurrito,1 point,Fri May 29 01:48:36 2015 UTC,"We're relying too heavily on the Breaking Bad universe? I mean, the show is set in the same universe, so I'm not sure what else we can rely on, but in the event that you mean there's too much easy fanservice... there really isn't. Gilligan and co said they don't want any links to that show with BCS to be stunts, and as far as I am concerned, so far so good. Even the Mike-centric episode, which was basically a love letter to fans of the character, didn't feel indulgent in the slightest.  Also, the writers play with the notion that we already know where Jimmy/Saul/Gene is headed, and that provides a very stark contrast to Breaking Bad where pretty much anything goes (in spite of our knowledge of Walter's cancer).  In other words, you're a fool, sir. Neither of your points hold any weight. If you're going to critique the show, talk about the writing, the direction, the characters, the arcs, all that stuff... then realise how wrong you are.  You're allowed to not like the show, by all means, everyone's entitled to their own subjective viewpoint. But come the fuck on, dude. Did you just watch Breaking Bad for the explosions or some shit?"
betterCallSaul,37gjdb,PlacidBurrito,0,Fri May 29 11:23:32 2015 UTC,"Eh, I disagree. I think the Mike-centric episode, and Mike's overall inclusion in BCS to be massively indulgent. What reasons are there for Mike to be in the show thus far? His contribution to the story at large was minimal and could have easily been served by a new character. And that's the point - if anything Mike did could have been done by a new character, why did it have to be Mike? The only answer I can fathom is that it was fan-service.  I did critique the writing - it was sub-standard characterization that didn't do anything unique. There are no unique character traits to Jimmy, they are literally just the inverse of Saul and it's just too easy. My post did talk about that. I don't know why my post comes across as if I only watched Breaking Bad for the explosions, because they were few and far between. Here, we're presented with a standard 'underdog' story and the moral disintegration of a character. It just feels so rehashed and I don't like it. I'm really disappointed with what they did with it.  I think this is partly Gould's doing. I don't think Gould has the subtlety that Gilligan has when it comes to writing characters and their arcs. I think there are several better ways that they could have handled pre-Saul Jimmy, but they just opted for the obvious choice and then within that didn't do anything to twist the obvious into their own thing. It's a shame, because the characters of Breaking Bad were all very in-depth and fleshed out, even in the short season 1, whilst here they're not. Anyway, it seems everyone's irate at me for saying this. I tried to say it respectfully and not insulting, so I dunno why I'm getting such negative responses."

Mike's backstory was discussed by the writers (and Banks) as far back as season 3. Stacey and Kaylee lived alone, without a husband/father in the picture, which we knew from Breaking Bad. Mike took care of them financially, hence his work with Fring/Saul/Walt.    The seeds were planted for BCS which was always meant to explore events prior to what we saw on Breaking Bad. Both Saul and Mike were well-established in their occupations as of Breaking Bad's timeline so it was fitting to see how they got there and what led them both to lead lives of criminality.   People called season 1 of Breaking Bad depressing and boring too. It was all part of the plan. Develop characters, build a world and escalate a story with real-life stakes and consequences before all hell breaks loose.   Breaking Bad spent 5 seasons earning their final season's breakneck pace. It's normal to feel like things on BCS are slow or boring by comparison.   With BCS, we've gotten through the development period where Jimmy tried to be good. Now he gets to become a criminal again via Nacho/Mike etc. That's where the fun begins. That's why the show was made. That's what we loved about both Saul and Mike on Breaking Bad.    However, you had to tell their story before all of that and what events made them turn to a life of crime. It's important to see Jimmy's relationship with Kim because it's going to be all the more tragic when he loses himself in Saul Goodman and loses her in the process.  This is only chapter 1. Trust the writers."

It's not a subtle or surprising case of foreshadowing that makes people scratch their heads and go ""Wow, I didn't realize this before!""  It's just an obvious statement that ultimately contributes nothing. It's pointing out a narrative device that is clearly used.   It's just completely silly, and turns into this complete circle jerk as though Vince Gilligan/Peter Gould + the BCS writer's room invented foreshadowing."

betterCallSaul,36gw3l,NtheLegend,2,Tue May 19 16:21:15 2015 UTC,Keep in mind BrBa took awhile to get to the level of greatness it ended with. Saul kicked into action pretty damn quickly.
betterCallSaul,36gw3l,thenichi,3,Mon May 25 22:24:30 2015 UTC,"BCS's first season is as competently made as BrBa ever was, but BCS has not ""kicked into action"" like BrBa did in its first season. BCS lacks the tension and violence that was so compelling about BrBa. There is no ""dude melting through the floor"" scene here, or anything close, and that was BrBa's second episode. BCS is a more domesticated drama and I don't think there's anything wrong with that, I just don't see it attaining the same trajectory as BrBa on that alone, though."

betterCallSaul,36gw3l,elus,8,Tue May 19 18:55:37 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why I think BrBa is a stronger show. I have enjoyed season 1 of BCS but it isn't breaking any molds. It's a lawyer show meets con man movie, with lots of (good) typical TV drama. There are some definite quirks (electrosensitivity), but nothing deeply risky.  Whereas the premise of Breaking Bad is nuts, think of how much happens just in the pilot. Some of the risks I would argue backfired (plane crash, took away my suspense of disbelief) but on the whole what was incredible about BrBa is how the risks paid off."

betterCallSaul,36gw3l,darkgamr,11,Tue May 19 13:12:14 2015 UTC,"I think it would be an above average show that people would see as an average show. Although in a vacuum, some characters like Mike and Tuco are handled a little weirdly just because we're expected to know them already."
betterCallSaul,36gw3l,Todd_Solondz,15,Tue May 19 15:44:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah like the part with Tuco, people would have been asking where that crazy guy from the first couple of episodes went. They would be asking why the hell introduce such a character and do nothing with him."
betterCallSaul,36gw3l,ThaGriffman,14,Tue May 19 15:54:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree with OP just in the sense that even hypothetically it's hard to imagine how we'd feel about bCS if it came before BB. But I also disagree with you for the same reason.  For me, when it first started it I was just happy to be back in ABQ. But as it went along I became heavily invested in Jimmy's story. For me he's possibly the most likable character in the whole BB universe.   bCS is undeniably a companion piece to BB but it also easily stands on it's own two feet comfortably. It's a fucking fantastic show. It's too early to call it a masterpiece but it's definitely got the potential to be one. Season 2 can't come fast enough."

betterCallSaul,36gw3l,BearDidIt,2,Wed May 20 00:50:45 2015 UTC,I think Walt is pretty damn likeable. Certainly moreso than Hank.
betterCallSaul,36gw3l,thenichi,2,Mon May 25 22:25:34 2015 UTC,Agreed. Saul is a great character but it'd be hard pitching a show centrally focused upon him right off the bat. In my opinion his character had to be viewed through the prism of the goings-on in BrBa to really interest the audience.
betterCallSaul,36gw3l,roobens,2,Tue May 19 19:11:02 2015 UTC,"I agree. I mean, there have been some great moments (mostly Mike-related), but it's hard to compare it favorably to BrBa. I wish I didn't have to compare them. Anyway, what I want to see more of in BCS in the second season more crime stories!! — more Tuco, more Nacho, more dark stuff. I don't care to see more Hamlin/McGill backstory. In my view, it's the crime aspect that made BrBa a great drama series."

The only amazing characters in BCS are Mike and Saul, both of which are in BB (where it's debatable that they are the best characters).  I'm going to be totally honest, I still haven't finished BCS. I'm just not as engrossed as I was with BB."

betterCallSaul,36gw3l,ftc08,0,Wed May 20 03:20:37 2015 UTC,Is it really about characters?  Not for me.  I love a show for it's STORY/PLOT.  Characters are secondary.
betterCallSaul,36gw3l,dadumk,9,Tue May 19 19:08:47 2015 UTC,the plots of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are entirely character-driven though. Every plot event only happens because we have very strong characters interacting with each other.
betterCallSaul,36gw3l,Rossegut,3,Tue May 19 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"It depends on who you ask. The thing about Breaking Bad, is that it had both. That's why it was such huge show. On one end of the spectrum, you have shows like Mad Men and The Sopranos that are almost completely character studies. Plot is secondary to developing the characters. Then on the other hand you have shows like that are completely plot based like CSI and Law and Order (there are probably better examples, but I don't watch many).   I think the reason why Breaking Bad was such a smash hit was that it balanced both plot and character development, and did both well. I know people in both camps who appreciated it. I'd argue the same is true of Game of Thrones."
betterCallSaul,36gw3l,TheOmnomnomagon,-1,Tue May 19 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"And yet Mad Men is my alll time favorite, even better than BB. Characters are overrated.  Story is everything, including on MM."

They get to experience what op is saying. Watching call Saul then watching breaking bad as kind of a spinoff in a way."
betterCallSaul,36gw3l,badass4102,3,Tue May 19 12:16:14 2015 UTC,"That's exactly my point. I've no doubt we'd be swooning over BCS like we did with BrBa during first season itself, and yes, we already called it the then current television masterpiece in its first season. I believe if BrBa would have started as spin off, then we'd be treating it like we're treating BCS, great but not better than BrBa."

betterCallSaul,36gw3l,TheToto1000,3,Tue May 19 19:49:31 2015 UTC,I felt that the beginning of the season was quite messy. All these skater boys and Tuco and stuff that basically... led to nowhere.  By the end however it had gotten me.

I know it's risky to share this opinion on this sub, but so far BCS hasn't really impressed me. For me, the way I feel about the show is evidenced by the fact that I have yet to have a real yearning to see the next episode. Most weeks, I forgot the show was on and remembered the day after it aired when I would see a post from this subreddit. Whereas with BrBa, I was almost counting the hours until the next episode. This isn't to say that I don't like BCS, but inasmuch as people shouldn't compare it to BrBa for various reasons (a point that has been made on this sub many many times), it isn't even comparable to BrBa in terms of quality television."

He seemed particularly rattled by that (because it triggered a flashback of Tuco and the skaters?) and I'm pretty sure that's when he hires Huell for security as well.   The only thing that ever really tied Saul and Mike together was their mutual ability to see through the Kettlebullshit. Without that, it's still sleezy Saul trying to cheat his way past the toll troll. They were never actually close.   Also, everybody seems to think the phone call Mike got in the BCC s1 finale was about Gus.

betterCallSaul,36iaw2,jonboy23,6,Sun May 24 18:40:43 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they will have a falling out later in the series? Not enough to completely alienate them, but make things a tad more strained. It seemed in Breaking Bad that Mike had more loyalty to Gus than Saul. Maybe it's just because Gus has a larger business than Saul does, or that Saul actively disagrees with Gus' business strategies. It seems clear enough now that when Mike receives a job, he doesn't put much else above it. A job working with Gus would be enough to change their dynamic."
betterCallSaul,36iaw2,Castriff,1 point,Tue May 19 16:47:03 2015 UTC,"In BrBa Saul says he doesn't even know Gus's name. They've never met; everything Saul knows about him is hearsay, probably said by and heard from Mike, who probably sent work to Saul from Gus's criminal enterprise.  Remember also, Gus only refers to Saul once, and not by name- he calls him ""the lawyer"". I don't think these two knew each other personally.  I think Mike respects Saul's abilities as a shyster, but doesn't admire them, and doesn't see Saul as a full-on player. A guy like Mike wouldn't see a guy like Saul as a peer or a potential superior. They're both servants, though, as in service performers....so they have that in common."

If I remember correctly, Saul said Gus was someone who kept quiet and was satisfied with making a small fortune without being noticed. That it sounded like Saul didn't know who Gus really was.  As Gus got more show time, he expanded his operation and even allowed street level dealers know who he was (and his operation expanded to the point he had mobile doctors ready with employees' medical histories). Tuco made sense as Saul would eventually represent some of Tuco's dealers.  I wouldn't be surprised Gus's story gets modified from what was said in BB."

I think you're talking about the end of the 3rd season of BrBa? When Gus wanted Walter killed for recklessly running down rival gang members to protect someone Gus viewed as volatile and dangerous to his business? Gus didn't just hire Mike off the street to execute a hit on Walter, and Walter wasn't just some ordinary citizen Gus wanted dead. Mike was an upper level soldier in Gus's operation who was performing part of the duties of his job. Considering that firing Walt and just telling him not to come back is not an option in this business, killing him for his disobeying Gus is just how it was.  So you're right, I don't think Mike would do murder for hire either. And up until he dies in season 5, I STILL don't think he would do murder for hire. He NEVER WAS murdering for hire."

He ended up being right and Jesse was on the verge of starting a street war. And Walt showed he was loyal to Jesse by pretty much being just as volatile and impulsive. That's why I felt Gus went ahead with the plan to kill them. I don't think Gus gave a shit what the cartel wanted since he was so close to enacting his payback. I mean when the cousins died, wouldn't that make the cartel more pissed off and want Walt handed over even more? I think it was just to the cartel's face that he acted like he was gonna eventually hand Walt over."

It was clever to play on our natural desire to side with the protagonist so when he hated Hamlin, so did we. I love how the show slowly pulled back the layers making the audience more and more of an objective observer.   I think I've been watching way too much TV lately though because I saw the twist with the brother coming and had it all completely pieced together by the time they dropped the bomb. I think I've grown accustomed to noticing the subtle cues that foreshadow story. Shows tend to be more complex and dislike spelling everything out nowadays so the audience has to be a bit more perceptive. And now I'm always looking for the little things and trying to figure everything out beforehand and I feel like a damn TV detective.   Chuck looking upset in the flashback when Jimmy showed him the degree, Chuck's late night phone call, the way Hamlin was acting when Wexler confronted him, the way Wexler acted when telling Jimmy to take the deal. The only logical conclusion was that Chuck was pulling the strings, especially with how much respect he had at the company."

And with what Chuck said to him was as if he purposely got up and pushed his brother off the right path and back onto the wrong one. Just remember what Jimmy said to Mike in the final scene.

Chuck's words aren't for Jimmy, they are for Chuck. Chuck needs to put up a huge wall in-between himself and Jimmy, because he feels insecure. This goes along with his Obsessive Compulsive Disorder as well. Chuck constantly feels threatened by everything. Jimmy's desire to move forward and progress is just another threat to Chuck. I don't even think it is a deep seated threat, but Chuck deals with it the way he deals with all perceived threats, he tries to destroy it or push it away (this a tell for OCD, pushing away anxiety instead of facing it).  Chuck is a fantastically written character. His intelligence and drive is shadowed by his pompousness and incredible anxiety. Jimmy is great foil to him. Look at how Jimmy takes care of his brother so lovingly. Chuck wouldn't do anything of those things for Jimmy. Sure he might bail him out of jail, but he would admonish him and attack him for having to do so. Chuck is a father figure to Jimmy. I don't see Chuck's betrayal as a Cain and Abel story, but more a Abraham and Issac story. Chuck is willing to sacrifice Jimmy because he believes ""The Law"" (God) is more important than him or Jimmy.  Chuck isn't a bad guy, but he failed to love his brother when he needed it the most."

They don't want to license people that will just use all of the knowledge they have of the system to try to find all the loopholes and circumvent what they believe is right.

I find this an interesting point of view because this thinking can be applied to many fields. Specifically, either the legal system (and its enforcement) or politicians and their citizenry.   It generally boils down to the questions of ""Which would you prefer, the individual who has only seen one side of the situation or has seen both?"". This line of thinking ties back into Mike's point about 'honour/integrity' being above things like law.  I'd argue that Chuck is in the wrong in his point of view for the following two reasons: A. ""People can't change"", from the speech exactly, is wrong because it is an absolutist statement which cannot be proven.  B. He's saying this after sabotaging his brother at every turn.  Chuck is a bad person, through and through. His ego, underhanded actions as well as his blind love of the legal system, makes him a horrible judge of character. He is the corrupt cops who Mike killed. His legal standing or experience is irrelevant, he, himself, is without honour or integrity."

betterCallSaul,35ck3h,tongxammo,8,Sat May 9 00:22:04 2015 UTC,"The writers had said that we'll probably see more Cinnabon Manager ""Gene"".  They themselves are certainly interested in doing more post-BB scenes, but the organic nature of the writing will dictate when we see a time-jump, not a formulaic approach for which episodes have time-jumps.  The Kettlemans were supposed to be a one-off in the Pilot, and Nacho was supposed to be the big bad of the season.  With only one flash-forward so far, I won't be surprised if we get another one in the premiere, but I won't be surprised if we don't, either.  I take each episode as its own thing with this series, even though everything is in service of the hyper-serialized story overall, and in the same story universe."
betterCallSaul,35ck3h,ehcmier,7,Sat May 9 13:50:48 2015 UTC,I think that'd be neat and make the original flashforward not feel out-of-place. It would remind us where we're headed and turn Jimmy's future into more than just a fanservice-y Cinnabon reference.
betterCallSaul,35ck3h,DabuSurvivor,6,Sat May 9 07:50:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe now we'll see the post breaking bad saul at the start of each season   I don't really think there's a reason to do this. His post BB life isn't really relevant right now.    until maybe the finale season when jimmy will end up working at the cinnabon.   I kind of like that, maybe the finale ends with him and Kim reconnecting post BB?   Or maybe he gets a call saying Chuck died and he attends Chuck's funeral and see's her, idk."

betterCallSaul,35ck3h,onetruepurple,0,Sun May 24 11:41:13 2015 UTC,"If we're really lucky. It does depend on what the season 2 premiere focuses on, and what themes the opening sequence will have to cover (an unspoken rule of both BB and bCS is that the opening scene reflects the mood of the episode to come). If the episode focuses on Jimmy's indulging in the criminal underworld then yes, we will get a flash forward. But if it focuses on 'Saul's interactions with Chuck, then we could get the flashback to Jimmy and Chuck's childhood (a scene filmed to be played during 'Marco', but which was scrapped in favour of what we eventually got)."

It's not like he's a good guy or anything, but he's not randomly beating the life out of people for no reason, like Tuco.

So I bet it's guaranteed we'll eventually end there.  I have no idea where it will go but one things for sure: When ""Gene"" is watching his old bCS commercials, there's a world of pain and complex feelings there behind his eyes. Whatever happens, I expect it will be the emotional equivalent of a kick in the face.  The Jimmy we've come to know is such a good man. I'm just really hoping that - by the end - he finds some sort of redemption."

betterCallSaul,355v8r,aydee123,1 point,Thu May 7 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"I think there will be 5 seasons. It has to be 5 seasons. Why? Because a proper drama has 5 acts. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, denouement. In the first season we learn about the main characters, their history and their relationship with each other. Recall it, we now pretty much know all the relevant information about Saul, Chuck, Howard, Kim and Mike and also their relationship. We know that Howard wasn't the douche we thought he was and that FUCK CHUCK. We know why Saul ended up in New Mexico and about his slippin Jimmy history.   If you think of Breaking bad it was pretty much the same. We learned about Jesse, his family, we learned that Walt was once a succesful chemist and co-founder of a now big company.     Season 2 of BCS will now be about Jimmy becoming Saul, rising action. Like it was in Breaking Bad. Jesse and Walt killed Tuco and began building up their own distribution. The plot was progressing really really fast. a lot of stuff was happening.   Season 3 was the climax, walt and jesse were working for gus now, making a lot of money and everything was as best as it could be. And it was in this season in which Walt slowly began thinking of getting rid of Gale first and later Gus. Season 4, the falling action, the conflict between the protagonist and the antagonist unreveals himself (later more about this) and Season 5, the denoument which is either a catastrophe or a happy ending. https://everwalker.wordpress.com/2014/07/23/freytags-pyramid-or-5-act-structure/  Now, who is the protagonist and who the antagonist in Breaking Bad? Walt vs. Gus? Walt vs. Cancer? The White family vs the Schrader family? Walt vs the Nazis? I personally think that it is none of them. It is Walt vs. Heisenberg. In the end the whole show was about ""Transformation"". I won't explain here in detail why, because it aint' the right sub. Anyway, I expect BCS to be similar in that matter."

betterCallSaul,353x0s,ackchanticleer,5,Wed May 6 22:06:44 2015 UTC,I honestly dont understand how the show didnt get a critics choice nomination when all the critics gushed over it when it first aired.
betterCallSaul,353x0s,Rybo2,4,Wed May 6 22:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's difficult to give any show (especially BCS) a critic's award for only having one season under the belt. The first season gives you a great setup, but all the best episodes of BCS have yet to be seen. Breaking Bad, for example, didn't start raking in the awards until the last couple seasons because that's when all the best episodes happened. I'm sure the same will happen with BCS down the road.   Edit: Awards aren't even that important imo. Sure, it's cool to see your favorite filmmakers get recognized for their awesome work, but ultimately who cares? It doesn't need an award to be validated in any way."
betterCallSaul,353x0s,Sup_GFallers,3,Thu May 7 06:07:44 2015 UTC,I don't see the logic in that. You give an award to a show if it releases quality episodes in that television season. Wether it's its first season or not is irrelevant. That's how they work.
betterCallSaul,353x0s,Rybo2,2,Thu May 7 08:51:19 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying it's like only watching the first twenty minutes of a movie and giving it an award. The storyline hasn't gotten a chance to really get moving yet, that's all."

betterCallSaul,34srq5,DJxxNightwolf,44,Mon May 4 07:20:26 2015 UTC,"Only possible answer in the context of BCS being a story being told to us.  Jimmy stopped being slippin' Jimmy to make his brother proud. He became a lawyer to impress his brother. All he did was because of his brother. After learning about Chuck's betrayal, he goes to Marco, going back to the ways of his slippin' past.  After Marco's death, he was presented with the opportunity of being in a good law firm. But then he realized he didn't want that because he doesn't want to impress Chuck anymore.  Chuck was what was holding Jimmy back the entire time. Because Jimmy wanted to be like him."
betterCallSaul,34srq5,BaroTheMadman,31,Mon May 4 08:18:29 2015 UTC,"People are saying that impressing Chuck was what mattered to Jimmy and that once Chuck betrayed him Jimmy no longer had a reason to be honest and law abiding. I disagree.    Jimmy admired Chuck and loved him as a brother. In Chuck Jimmy saw the rewards of money and success that playing the game by the rules could give you. He wanted to impress Chuck of course but he also wanted a shot at success based on his brains and talent. He rightly felt he had what it takes to make it as a sucessful lawyer.     What Jimmy learned from Chuck was that it is not a level playing field. Having the brains and the talent and playing by the rules is not enough. Even his own brother was rigging the game against him when he should have been reaping the rewards he so clearly earned.     Jimmy came to realize that being honest and hard working and using his talents was not enough. Those in power would always close their doors to him because he was not ""the right sort"" according to them. Not only Chuck but everyone in the power elite would behave this way Jimmy figures.     What Jimmy means when he says ""I know what stopped me"" was that he though he had a fair chance if he played by the rules but in reality the game was rigged. He would never be allowed to win no matter how much he deserved it. He may as well cheat and scheme and win any way he can because that is the only success open to him.    I am not saying Jimmy is right in thinking these things. Only that he has come to believe them.   TL;DR Jimmy feals he will never be allowed to win fairly so he thinks his only option is to cheat."
betterCallSaul,34srq5,Creabhain,5,Mon May 4 12:39:12 2015 UTC,"Good analysis. I think this goes hand in hand with making Chuck proud, though.

betterCallSaul,34srq5,BAXterBEDford,8,Tue May 5 17:10:46 2015 UTC,"I am not saying Jimmy is right in thinking these things.    Actually, he is. Sadly, that is the way the world has become. Some kid born into a wealthy family, is sent to a prep school, goes to a university with a prestigious reputation, etc.. That kid, if he/she puts in the expected effort, not even some sort of dazzling effort, often will have much success given to them.   Whereas someone who works their way up when they have every disadvantage to begin with, even if they perform with Herculean effort and genius skills, will often find their success stymied  because of their station in life.  We've evolved into a very real class system. Yes, there are exceptions to the rule. But they are rarities and just enough for the elite class to use as disingenuous examples that it is possible for anyone if they are smart enough and willing to put the hard work in.  You might think that because Jimmy and Chuck are brothers that they would share those same advantages. But that often is not the case. Chuck, being the older (oldest?) brother, quite probably got the lion's share of the family's resources, as is common in many families. Coming from an Irish-American family myself, I can tell you that the first son is often treated like the Second Coming of Jesus Christ himself, and the later ones just operate in the shadows."
betterCallSaul,34srq5,blacky409,3,Mon May 4 16:30:26 2015 UTC,"Great answer, thanks for this"
betterCallSaul,34srq5,firo_sephfiro,2,Mon May 4 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your analysis!   What Jimmy learned from Chuck was that... Having the brains and the talent and playing by the rules is not enough.   I think basically the opposite. Jimmy didn't learn that life isn't fair from Chuck. Chuck learned it from Jimmy. Let's first remember Jimmy didn't play by the rules, his main success came when he hired Mike to break and enter and steal the money from his client. The argument Chuck made is that Jimmy didn't play by the rules. It irked Chuck that he (himself) had brains and talent and had played by all the rules, and here comes his habitual fuck up scam artist little brother (who he had to bail out of a long jail sentence for taking a shit in a car with children in it) suddenly claiming to be his peer and then even starting to succeed at his job through perseverance and charm.  The sad thing about intelligent, talented people is some have a tendency to also be vain and judgmental. And often with idealism comes elitism. Chuck fits all those categories.   Chuck's pride really ruins a lot. It's that nagging feeling that makes him insecure about his own life and makes him question if he wasted all his time working hard and being good and going to a prestigious school since his brother can take some community college classes and get a degree online. Chuck's vanity makes him petty and prevents him from actually seeing the great achievements and transformation of his little brother. But he masks his true feelings (though poorly) and pretends to be proud.  It's kind of ironic because Jimmy was really committing to Chuck's philosophy of hard work and being good and was following his example and finally starting to see it pay off, bit by bit. Jimmy might have learned some life lessons about playing by the rules from Chuck, but I highly doubt one of them was that it never pays off.  Jimmy always had a natural urge to break the rules, as is evidenced by his past (and future) history. You can see it in the way he's tempted by his best friend/scam partner in the flashback scene when he tells him he's leaving to Albuquerque and by the fact that he went back to said friend and pulled scams for a week on his 'vacation'. He's always had the mentality that to get ahead you can get a little dirty, it appeals to him. He was Slippin' Jimmy. He just fought it because of his brother (as he also says repeatedly throughout the show).    The lesson Jimmy learned is that his brother doesn't really care about him and that all his attempts to follow in his footsteps (who he clearly admires greatly as shown by how excited he was to be working together on the Sandpiper case) were for naught. He realized he had spent all his time trying to be good and nice and play by the rules out of a debt and responsibility he felt he owed to his brother, because Chuck got him out of jail and hired him and put him on track. In Jimmy's mind, Chuck saved his life. I think Jimmy still feels this way and that's why you see him still caring about his big brother (giving the list of needs to Hamlin, driving by Chuck's house, being all “Dalai Lama” about it) even after he finds out the truth. If not for Chuck, Jimmy would probably still be in jail.  But Jimmy always assumed that his brotherly love was mutual and that since Chuck was looking out for him he also wanted what's best for him. Chuck was too much of a coward to tell him how he really feels so Jimmy spent years in the shadow of his big brother with this debt hanging over him as he tried to be the good person he thought Chuck wanted him to be. But Chuck doesn't want him to be good, he wants him to be good enough. It's kind of interesting how in all Chuck's attempts to hold him back, he's really just making Jimmy a better, more creative, resourceful lawyer.    Those in power would always close their doors to him because he was not ""the right sort"" according to them.   This is completely false and disproved by the fact that Jimmy was being offered another job at a very high power firm and that the only person actually working against him at HHM was his brother. He may have felt that way until he discovered the truth about Chuck holding him back but I highly doubt anyone could make this argument (and support it) after he found out. He very possibly could have been one of “those in power” if he took the job and it would have been based solely on his hard work, talent, and intelligence. He decided not to take it, or at least it's implied when he turns around in the parking lot (that final scene of the season). I don't think he took the job and I'm assuming it's because the idea of becoming a high power attorney and following in his brother's footsteps didn't appeal to him.   I really love this show because the origin feels so organic. The backstory makes perfect sense exactly why and how Jimmy would become Saul Goodman. That final scene of the season is so poetic. He's walking towards everything he thought he wanted: the prestigious, top-paying job where he can work on his own case.   And what does he do?   He stops and rubs the ring of his dead best friend, literally touching the last connection to his past that reminds him of who he truly is. Slippin' Jimmy. But he's so much more now, thanks to a big fat ugly lie. A lie that he believed for years which made him aspire to be a better person, and actually made him one. The kind of better person who can now defend lowlifes like himself and isn't shackled by a fear of being judged or looked down on for what he does. Saul Goddamn Goodman.  I think he realizes that job he was offered is not what he wants. That's a job for another corporate elitist yes-man who wants to work for the rich. That's not him, it's his brother. The brother who calls him a lowlife and holds him down. He's hard working, he's ambitious, he's sincere, he's dishonest. He may be a lowlife, but if so, he is going to work for the other people being held down and called lowlifes by society. He doesn't have any qualms about defending criminals because he knows about the judgmental hypocrisy of the moral majority, thanks to his brother.    Never again will he be the fool who does the self-less 'right thing' just to try to make his brother proud. He won't let the burden of trying to fit his brother's ideal lead him on or stop him from doing anything any longer. From now on, all his future decisions will be made with himself in mind. In the end, I guess it works out for both brothers. Jimmy gets to be his true self (ironically with a fake name) while his brother gets to die wrapped in tinfoil knowing that his inferior little brother is one of those lesser, cheesy advertisement, poor people kind of lawyers."

None of them is particularly attractive (with only one or two of them being at the level of ""cute"" - like a 6 or maybe a 7, to me)  Girls with bright, unnaturally colored hair are attention-seekers and typically slutty  If you ARE going to get married (which you shouldn't do), just make it clear that if she gets fat, you will divorce her.Whether it's true or not. It's preemptive dread game. Also keep in shape and ensure she knows you have options at all times.  I was fine with fat shaming if it led to lowered obesity rates, because obesity was a far bigger killer than the relatively rare cases of anorexia. If a few more girls died due to anorexia, but thousands were saved from being obese - that was a fine trade-off to me  To some extent, this is because people realize on some visceral level that women don't have the same level of agency, on average, as men do.  Most girls who model, especially amateur modeling are pretty much attention whores to the core...They're damaged. Avoid them. Or sleep with them and then drop them.  (Women) are what they are.

The Cinnabon scene at the very beginning of the show was a ""flash forward"" to what's going to happen later on in the series.  While that one scene occurs after the events of Breaking Bad, everything else we've seen in season one is taking place before the timeline of BB begins.  It's like the glimpses we get of the teddy bear in the pool during season 2 of BB, but this time we saw further into the shows future."
betterCallSaul,34oqug,Tazuwan,6,Sun May 3 14:53:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but where they go with Better Call Saul is yet to be determined. The plot could very well continue through into the timeline of Breaking Bad while focusing mainly on Saul or events not covered in Breaking Bad."
betterCallSaul,34oqug,gzip_this,0,Sun May 3 17:26:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the support. I was trying to show that the Saul Universe does not end with Breaking Bad. In theory at least, Holly could show up ordering a Cinnabon in Omaha."
betterCallSaul,34oqug,NotSureIfFunnyOrSad,2,Sun May 3 20:14:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, if the show chooses to go back to ahead of time with cinnamon Saul, then we could see more brba cast if Saul gets into trouble or is found out by the authorities. Sky could have to testify against him or something to that effect. Remember he relocated with vacuum guy but he is presumably on a list... not sure if they're going to go that direction tho probably better off to leave that story untouched."
betterCallSaul,34oqug,IdiotsLantern,2,Mon May 4 02:53:46 2015 UTC,"I hope not. RJ Mitte has said that Walt Jr. will have some seriously conflicted feelings about accepting that ""trust fund"" when it comes his way, (his family DOES need it) and he'll have to do some serious soul searching first.   But I hope he takes it. In my mind, he goes to college and Skyler moves the entire rest of the family, Marie included, to the Virgin Islands where Holly can grow up far away from the shadow of Heisenberg."
betterCallSaul,34oqug,ackchanticleer,2,Sun May 3 18:49:40 2015 UTC,Deep down Skyler proabaly knows that money is really from Walt but there is no reason to think that Flynn would know. So then why would he have a problem taking it?
betterCallSaul,34oqug,TheRegulatorOnline,2,Sun May 3 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"Skyler during the BB timeline, maybe. It's far fetched, but not impossible. There's not much place for either Walt Jr. or Holly though. Saul only ever met Walt Jr. that once in the car wash during To'hajilee, and unless he is visiting Walt/Skyler during a time when they're watching the baby, I really don't see where, at all, she'll play any kind of role whatsoever as there's never been any one-on-one interaction. Any of those two characters, I suppose, could potentially (very, very thin use of the term) turn up post-BB somehow. And Vince is obviously pretty damn crafted at this stuff. But what would be the point? What would Saul have to do with any of them?"
betterCallSaul,34oqug,sckawt,2,Sun May 3 21:47:31 2015 UTC,Yep. Vince Gilligan said in his AMA that the possibilities are endless
betterCallSaul,34oqug,zoidbergx,2,Mon May 4 00:19:37 2015 UTC,"id love to see them as extras, in the backround, grocery shopping or something like that, but not as actual characters of BCS"

betterCallSaul,34oqug,phigo50,-7,Wed May 6 20:58:18 2015 UTC,I think thats a bit small minded. Even when Breaking Bad was airing the writing team had twists and turns we didn't see coming. And remember that the show could (and hopefully will) go into after the events of BrBa.. we just don't know
betterCallSaul,34oqug,PM_ME_UR_JUGZ,1 point,Sun May 3 04:49:46 2015 UTC,"It's gotta be that much harder with kids (or young adults who grow and change a load over the course of a couple of years). Obviously not Holly, but they can't really rewind time to put Walter Jr back to how he was in season 1 of BB, for example. And I'm not sure why they'd want to, they were characters on the periphery in BB and were never involved in anything with Saul until a quick hello in the carwash."
betterCallSaul,34oqug,Tyrannosaurus_Rez,-1,Sun May 3 07:05:39 2015 UTC,"Holly would be the hardest. Walter Jr is grown up and will look the same give or take 5 years. Holly is a baby and looks different every 6 months. You can't have a 3 or 4 year old holly playing an infant holly, that just doesn't make sense. It doesn't work"
betterCallSaul,34oqug,PM_ME_UR_JUGZ,5,Sun May 3 08:26:52 2015 UTC,"Do you really think they'd be picky enough to insist on keeping  the same actress for Holly though? Don't you think they'd just cast a different baby?   Then again this is the same show that just slaps a mullet wig on Bob Odenkirk whenever they need a flashback to Jimmy in his late 20s/early 30s, so I wouldn't put it past them."

He's 22 now, I'm pretty sure they couldn't make him look like S1 Walter Jr. no matter how hard they tried (maybe later seasons but why? I don't see what having him in the show would add).  Babies are easy, we honestly didn't see enough of Holly to cement any features. If it's a 3 or 4 year old Holly that might appear in Better Call Saul (once again though, why??), they could just pick any of probably 100 candidates and make it believable."
betterCallSaul,34oqug,Tyrannosaurus_Rez,1 point,Sun May 3 20:01:15 2015 UTC,"He looks exactly the same, he was pretty much fully matured during breaking bad, and keep in mind they have oedenkirk playing himself in his flashback by putting a wig on him. He looks like a 45 year old 20 - something with a bad haircut haha. I think they could pull of rj Mitte being 16"

betterCallSaul,34oqug,8serene8,1 point,Sun May 3 20:06:35 2015 UTC,I dont think so. The only thing I see is the finally of the show is the first encounter with Walter and jesse. Thats the only cross over with the main characters of BB in my mind that would fit.
betterCallSaul,34oqug,thomshouse,1 point,Sun May 10 11:34:37 2015 UTC,"I think if we see Walt or any of his family, it won't be to hire Saul. (Unless it gets to the point in his story when they meet him.) It would not make sense later in Breaking Bad because he would have recognized him and there would have been an exchange of words similar to knowing each other once. If we see them, it might be in passing (in the background) which would still be neat. They have to cross paths at some point since they all live in Albuquerque."
betterCallSaul,34oqug,PRGuyHere,1 point,Sun May 3 11:38:28 2015 UTC,"No. Even if they flash-forward again, I don't see any reason for them to involve the remaining White family.  Maybe Badger and Skinny Pete, maybe Mike's family, maybe Kim or even Chuck (fuck Chuck). But this is Jimmy/Saul's story, and the Whites were simply a chapter most of which we've already seen.  Ultimately, though, I just want to see what Vince and Peter cook up, because it's probably more interesting than I could think of."

Huell may be in custody and being grilled)  so when Saul flees to Omaha and adopts Gene as his new id, we have plenty of overlap with the DEA, Skyler, Jesse, Kuby, Huell and Ed to go.

Breaking Bad went from 2008 to 2013 and lasted five seasons. The entire storyline from start to finish covers two years.

Huell & Kuby - clearly part of Saul's regular team like Mike is. Kuby is the 'face' you call for an in-person con. Huell is the one you call when you want to intimidate someone or need a pair of hands for heavy lifting. Mike's the real muscle for the serious jobs.  Joe, the junkyard operator and 'guy who knows how to get rid of things.' Also, I can't remember his name, but the arms dealer who sold Walter the guns both times (Bobby Singer from Supernatural.)  Of course we need Gus, but not yet. He's further down the line in S3-4-5 somewhere. His arrival is also a precursor to any Walt/Jesse stuff that might come towards the end.  You don't actively try to work in any of these guys. Sooner or later, whatever Saul gets up to he's going to need the services of one or more of them for whatever he's doing, and that's when you tap them - based on the services they offer and Saul's needs in his story. That keeps it from feeling forced."

As with Tuco, I think writers could explore this character before he was addicted to drugs. They could present a contrast to the different states of his life. Maybe he needed Saul's help right as he started to experiment with drugs."
betterCallSaul,34hn6h,notmay421,11,Fri May 1 18:10:56 2015 UTC,I think too much crossover will kill the realism of BCS. Unless we saw Saul interact with that character (or heard about it) the crossover ruins it. Unless they are on the BCS but Saul never interacts with them.

betterCallSaul,34ealp,LeslieTim,69,Fri May 1 07:40:36 2015 UTC,Saul Goodman is a con.  Jimmy is in on it.  Heisenberg was Walts true self though.  Walter White was the con.
betterCallSaul,34ealp,JacobChambers,9,Thu Apr 30 15:55:50 2015 UTC,I agree to an extent but I'd argue that Heisenberg was rather a manifestation of Walt's megalomania.
betterCallSaul,34ealp,LeslieTim,18,Fri May 1 02:43:54 2015 UTC,So...Jimmy is Batman and Walter is Superman?
betterCallSaul,34ealp,JacobChambers,4,Thu Apr 30 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"Not in this case Bruce Wayne's true self is Batman.  Superman's true self is Superman.  Saul Goodman is just a suit, a swagger,  a confidence,  a con that Jimmy is pulling long term.  Like the Matlock suit but more elaborate.

What I think you're thinking about is from my favorite scene from Kill Bill and probably yours.  How Superman differs from all other superheroes because he was born Superman and Clark Kent is his disguise.   Peter Parker becomes Spiderman.  Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. Etc.  I'm not talking about becoming something.   I'm talking about what is a character true selves at their core.  Saul is Jimmy.   Walt is Heisenberg.   Bruce is Batman.  Superman is Superman.   Spiderman is.. I'm gonna say Peter Parker but he's a tough one.
betterCallSaul,34ealp,tonicodrea,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:43:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't even remember that scene from Kill Bill but it definitely makes sense in the context; I think the difference between our points of view is that, while I too believe that Saul is just a facade, I don't believe that Jimmy is the guy behing the ""mask"".  Jimmy McGill is not faking being nice and considerate, he really liked helping the old ones for example, but his real core is Slippin' Jimmy. I just think the real transformation will be from that to a mix of Mcgill and Slippin'Jimmy (with Saul Goodman as the cover)."
betterCallSaul,34ealp,statefarminsurance,2,Thu Apr 30 19:57:22 2015 UTC,I agree for the Matlock con he was sincere for the most part.  He was Jimmy and the suit was just window dressing and he used some questionable marketing.   A very lite innocent con without any victims.   Saul Goodman is more elaborate he has the window dressing and questionable marketing but also a narcissistic personally and a confidence we don't see in Jimmy.  I think Saul is a con that gets out of control for Jimmy but the success of Saul is almost revenge against everyone who doesn't think he's a real lawyer so he is compelled to keep at it even though Jimmy is scared of Saul.  Which is a cool contrast on how Walt embraced Heisenberg.    Of course this opinion and not fact.  :)
betterCallSaul,34ealp,bear_sheriff,17,Thu Apr 30 20:23:24 2015 UTC,"Heisenberg was a persona of Walter White's; he was still Walter White in private, when he wasn't putting on a show for drug dealers, rivals etc. In season 5A, Heisenberg began to dominate his personality more so than Walter did, but things reversed when his cancer came back within the final season timeline.   Saul Goodman is also a persona of Jimmy McGill, except he's taken it a step further by legally doing business as him and carrying on a full-scale, public performance of this character. In private, he's still the same Jimmy McGill. It'd be ridiculous if he still acts like Saul in private moments with Kim, Chuck etc. I cannot wait for a Kim/Saul scene where Kim is mortified of what Jimmy has turned himself into in order to become a successful attorney, especially when she got him a great opportunity via Davis and Maine.    I keep saying this but that decision will haunt him and his relationship with Kim forever.  It'll be similar to when Walt walked out on Gretchen in Rhode Island, eventually leading to his Gray Matter exit because he couldn't stand the idea that his partner and best friend became romantic with her instead. She only did it since he moved on with Skyler and started a family. He then lied to himself when the company blew up, choosing to believe he was forced out and his work was the key to it all.  Everything that went wrong for him was his doing, no one else's. His pride/ego/stubbornness led to that buyout request. They wanted him to be apart of that company no matter what.  On Breaking Bad, we were only supposed to see Saul Goodman in performer mode.  Once in a while, Jimmy would crack that shell and show humanity like telling Jesse to go to see Andrea and Brock. But again, Saul served one purpose on Breaking Bad and that was as Walt and Jesse's consigliere.   We weren't supposed to see his private life and how he truly was when he wasn't in his office or with clients. That's what Better Call Saul is for. You'll see Breaking Bad events only from Jimmy's perspective. People in his life will also be integrated so we see where they were during his tenure as Walt/Jesse's criminal lawyer."

betterCallSaul,34ealp,buriedinthenude,7,Sun May 3 11:22:51 2015 UTC,"100% agreement.  I felt similar with the whole ""Walt becoming Heisenberg"" thing.  He didn't ""become"" anything, he initially adopted that persona in order to confront Tuco, then realized he was really being more true to himself.  Jimmy is and will be the same guy when he decides to pursue a certain kind of law where the name change will be helpful.  He said as much in Breaking Bad when he told Walter his real name."

betterCallSaul,34ealp,BobaFetted,7,Thu Apr 30 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"But changing your name on a piece of paper doesn't inherently change who you are as a person. OP is simply referring to what Jimmy projects to the world, which is not who he is on inside. (Personally I've argued this in the past before)  And that kind of goes back to Mike's point about being a criminal. The law is not the only deciding factor in morality, nor is it an absolute. You can be morally a good man, while breaking the law. (How many people J walk? Technically you are committing a crime, making you a criminal. Doesn't mean a man doing it to save children from a burning building is a bad guy.)  OPs point is that Saul Goodman is a con job he pulls on everybody. He's still Jimmy at heart. The rest is set dressing."

The fact that he was once a low-level con artist doesn't change that.  The only cons we've seen Jimmy pull have something very important in common: they only worked because the mark was greedy and tried to put one over on Jimmy and/or Marco.  All Jimmy does is create a situation in which he has the advantage while making the mark think they have the advantage.    The fake Rolex con only works when the mark steals from a passed out drunk guy AND tries to keep the lion's share of the loot.  The Kennedy coin con only works when the mark tries to snatch away what he thinks is a great deal from Marco, even though Marco got the first offer and did the work to verify it (as far as the mark knows)."

It's actually the same basic principle as the Rolex Con:    Mark meets Conman #1, posing as a man in possession of an old violin.  #1 gives the violin to the Mark, asking him to watch it while he retrieves a small amount of petty cash to settle a debt. Conman #2 arrives on the scene, posing as an instrument seller/antiquarian.  He asks the Mark to show him the violin.  Whaddya know, it's a genuine Stradivarius, there are only 25 others like it in the world, blah blah, #2 offers the Mark a huge sum of money.  However, he's in a big hurry, and just gives him his business card.   #1 returns.  If the Mark is a good guy, then the con fails because he gives up the violin and leaves the scene, letting #1 know he's sitting on a goldmine.  However, if the Mark is greedy, the con succeeds, because, like in the Rolex game, he gives up lots of real money for a fake luxury item.  #1 puts on a good show, upping the price until the Mark pays thousands of dollars for a used violin from the shop a few blocks away.  And the Mark is screwed if he goes to the cops, since he won't be able to fully explain what happened without looking like a scammer himself."

I think season two is going to be about Jimmy learning all the detailed ins and outs of the ind of law we see him practicing in Breaking Bad."

Walter was destroyed by his hubris, and Jimmy will be destroyed by fate. Regardless of whether he's being likable or contemptible, altruistic or selfish, it's all pushing him closer to that same end. I was smiling along with Jimmy in that last scene of the show, but it made me sad to know where that road eventually leads him.  From Donna Bowman's AV Club review of Marco:   Oedipus is funny. That’s the structure of funny, right there. “Who did this terrible thing to our city? Oh God, it was me!”  That’s blowhard filmmaker Lester in Woody Allen’s Crimes and Misdemeanors, completely missing the point of dramatic irony. When the audience knows something that the characters don’t know—like the end of the story—there’s a friction, a shiver, a tension that could almost be mistaken for humor. But the vibrations are actually those of despair, fate, the inexorability of the inevitable bearing down on us all."

I feel like this show as well as BrBa does a good job of complicated characters who are neither evil nor good, just flawed.

betterCallSaul,347x78,ofthedappersort,12,Wed Apr 29 02:58:21 2015 UTC,"I don't see how Marco caring about Jimmy and ""loving the game"" are mutually exclusive.    They aren't, but they are connected. Everyone Jimmy meets can smell the huckster on him, and they interact with him accordingly. Even the people who LIKE him call him ""Charlie Hustle.""   It wouldn't surprise me if this smell is exactly what drew Marco to Jimmy in the first place. Marco loves the hustle, he lives for the game, it's the only thing that makes him happy, but to make it really work he needs a partner who's even better then he is. He found his other half in 'Slippin' Jimmy,' who was charismatic and handsome and naturally good at everything. So he worships the ground Jimmy walks on and together there is nothing they can't do. Of course he loves him. Why wouldn't he?    It's a sincere love but it's also a selfish one, because it revolves around the game. When Jimmy rejected the game, he also rejected Marco because except for the bar cons, I guess they really had nothing in common. Marco thinks Chuck is a pain in the ass, but that's because Chuck knows every single time Marco and Jimmy are in a room together. for any reason, they wind up running some kind of scheme. Because that's what they do. It's all they ever do.   If Jimmy's going to live an upright life, he can't be around Marco. But now that Marco is dead, he and Jimmy won't ever be separated again.

Everything else about his life was terrible and no doubt made him feel like a failure. Jimmy is the same. Everyone wants to be successful,  and in Marco's mind that means getting rich off scamming people. The show, like Breaking Bad, is about ambition. Jimmy has turned down the offer from the law firm because he knows he'd be a wasted talent. He wants to be a success, and to him that means doing things his way. It doesn't mean he's decided to do ""bad things"" yet either. So far as a lawyer he's been a public defender, done what amounts to charity work for old people, and then helped hundreds of those same old people who WERE being scammed. Maybe he doesn't realise exactly how bad he'll have to break yet in the course of becoming successful."

By not supporting Jimmy he cleared the path for Jimmy becoming Saul. Chuck could have handled ""the chimp with a machine gun"" when Jimmy would have worked for him. In the end that's what Jimmy wanted. Especially after all the things Jimmy did för Chuck for 18 months (remember how surprised Howard was when Jimmy gave him the list and how unhappy Chuck was about the new guy saying ""this time the grocery list was almost complete, almost"").  But Marco isn't dark at all he just never could leave his old lifestyle. He maybe stopped scamming people but only because he liked doing that with his best friend."

betterCallSaul,347x78,Dove_of_Doom,31,Wed Apr 29 04:13:05 2015 UTC,"Every scam that we saw Jimmy and Marco pull was based on exploiting their marks' greed. When Marco was imagining Jimmy ripping his clients off, it seems plausible that it was in that same spirit. I'm not saying it's right, but they could rationalize that they were ripping off people who wanted to do the same to them.  Hearing his friend is toiling in the least glamorous aspect of the legal profession there is seems legitimately disappointing. Marco wanted more for Jimmy than that, as opposed to Chuck who thought the mailroom was good enough for him. I don't think Marco ever dreamed his friend would get involved with murderous drug dealers and sink as low as he did during Breaking Bad."

Except that's NOT what he heard. He heard Jimmy was a lawyer, and he hears he's working with old people, and his IMMEDIATE reaction is, ""You're ripping off old people?!""  What if Jimmy had said yes? What if he'd bragged about how much money he'd been scamming these geezers into giving him? I have a hard time imagining Marco pausing for more then a moment before congratulating his friend on his successful game. I definitely can't imagine him reproaching or scolding Jimmy for successfully pulling off a scam on ANYONE, no matter how innocent the victim.   And yes, their scams all revolve around exploiting someone's greed, but only because greed is easier to exploit. Someone who smells money will ignore their own better instincts. If it was a kharmic or moral comeuppance, it's a very convenient one for the scammers. At best it's a rationalization that con artists use to justify their actions, but it's more utilitarian then otherwise."

Remember that their cons only hurt the greedy. If you weren't greedy their cons wouldn't effect you. Like the show Hustle. The cons only worked because their marks were greedy. Look at when he did the coin on the beer bottle trick, it was like oh hey like this, see got your $20, but with the selling coin trick look how much he was into it really selling it. Marco was a decent guy, he loved to fool greedy people only.   This seems to be an ongoing theme here, the greedy get hurt, be honorable even as a crook and you should be okay.. the bribe at the beginning if he spent it he would have to do the bidding of the couple, even Mike said it to the drug dealer, you can be a bad cop or a good criminal. Better to be a good criminal. Hence we Saul has that discussion with him about the money, yeah he said he should have taken it but I don't believe he meant it.

Marco seemed to be pretty ok with the idea of Jimmy scamming those old people. I think the scam was what Marco really cared about, and anything Jimmy did that WASN'T a scam, even if it was helping old people, was a waste of Jimmy according to Marco.   Con artists make a big deal about presumably only scamming people who in one way or another deserve it, either because they are greedy or lusty or for some other reason. But the ""Con Man's Code"" details how these supposed rules don't really hold up in the face of what Con Artists actually do. ""In short, these rules are justifications for illegal and unethical acts and are by no means a code that con artists actually live by.""   There's just as many cons that target a person's good nature as target their greed and we don't know for a fact that Marco had any moral issues about scamming the innocent. Just because we only saw him and Jimmy using such cons as ""Old Fiddle,"" ""Coin Collector,"" ""Lottery Ticket,"" and ""Nigerian Prince,"" doesn't mean they believed they were being good guy bad guys."

I've always loved BrBa because it made me question where the line is drawn. For the fans that have followed since then, we're rooting for Jimmy to die (whether we admit it or not). We want Saul. So yes, Marco may be the darkest character so far, but think about who we have rooted for since 2008. One of the darkest characters ever written, Walter White.   Marco is Jimmy's downfall. Marco is also the catalyst that gives us the titular character we crave. He is Saul's hero, therefore he is our hero.   If this series were to stand alone, I would detest Marco. He would be the Iago to our Othello. As it realistically stands, however, Marco is a martyr. Saul may be objectively ""bad"" compared to ""Jimmy"", but what do we want of our protagonist? To continue fighting his true self or to embrace what his true characteristics could lead him to be?   We will see more of this. We will see characters drag Jimmy down, and we will say ""Oh no! Poor Jimmy!"" But we will feel fulfilled. We will celebrate the destruction of his moral compass just as we did with Walt. Then he will take it too far. Then we will have to decide if it was all worth it. And I'll tell you right now, it was worth it. Because with no Saul, there was no empire. With no empire, there is no Cinnabon. With none of that, there are no questions to be answered. And holy hell, do we feed on those damn questions."

Yes, but Walter's journey wasn't darkness all the way down. It also contained moments of joy, tenderness, adrenaline-pumping victories against his enemies (""This is not meth."") Walt was so good at fooling himself into believing he was the good guy that he was literally the last person in the world to realize what a monster he'd become.   Jimmy's whole journey is different on a fundamental level because unlike Walter, who had an active hand in turning himself into what he became, the entire world seems to be of the opinion that Jimmy was BORN to be Saul and either belittles or ignores all of his efforts to be anything else. He's a born liar and a crook and everyone on the planet smells it on him from the moment he walks in the room. The Kettlemans know it, Nacho knows it, Mike knows it, Chuck REALLY knows it, even the people who LIKE Jimmy, like Kim and Howard, know it and either mock him (""Charlie Hustle"") or keep him at arm's length because of it.   And Marco, the one character we meet unashamed about his affection for Jimmy, loves him specifically BECAUSE he knows he's a con-man and liar and crook and thief on the inside, and loves that about him.   It's like they are saying Jimmy HAS no choice except to become what we know he'll become, because no one else sees anything else in him.

The question is how did he do it exactly? I don't need to know but many people wanted to know when he had the time to do it, how he administered it etc.   At Comic Con, Vince said the writers subscribe to the idea that Walt visited Brock's school and put the LOTV in his juice box. Walt was a teacher and would know how/when to access the school in order to pull this off.   Again, I don't need everything explained. I like using my imagination, especially with Gus' backstory.

Again, I want my imagination to let me think he's in a better place like Vince scripted.  The only way I'd be cool with seeing Jesse again is by doing Breaking Bad scenes from Saul's perspective. You can extend certain moments or add scenes that support previous scenes like calling Mike to set up the original Gus deal or the first time Walt approached Saul about Brock's poisoning.   That way, they're not forced into the story before or after BB's timeline of 2008-2010. I don't want cameos either."

They really want BCS to be it's own show with it's own ideas and it's own reasons to stand out. They won't be putting in any cameos from BB characters unless it absolutely makes sense to. They have a board in the writers room with all the names of all the characters from the show on it and every now and again when they need to introduce a new character they go to the board to see if one of those names might fit in. But if you expect Walt or Jesse to appear in an episode any time soon, you might be waiting a long time."

Everything on his stage was meant to aid his facade and performance, including a fake diploma that makes him seem far more experienced than he really is.   By using his real law school, he gives himself an excuse if he ever got in trouble for using a diploma with a different name/year on it. He can blame the school or its printer for using the wrong name/year.  Furthermore, he doesn't want to advertise to the world what his real name is so of course he's going to use something that's doctored.  He only referenced his last name McGill to Walt because he thought Walt was Irish (since Walt was using the name, Mayhew). He could tell that Walt was likely using a fake name based on his Unabomer disguise.  Any more  burning questions? I'll be here all day."

He made  a promise to him that he intends to keep per their DailyBeast interview mid-S1.   We'll still have Vince for S2 but all indications point to him spreading his wings a bit. Pitching movies while BCS is writing season 2 proves that.  There's a reason he brought Peter on to this project as his partner.

Honestly, I feel bad for Saul, but he dug his own grave, and it'll end up just the way everyone else said it would. I'd like the series to end with that same scene. Of him at the cinnabon, and then he goes home, and look in the box, but now we see all of those things and know WHY they're important to him. He sits down and watches those commercials just like every night before. But, no cops come in, nobody comes in. Saul Goodman is dead. And the dream died with him.   I think that's a more fitting end for our final ""bad guy"" in the anthology. That he ends up alone, lost, and broken. Maybe hopeful, but overall, he has to sleep in the bed he's made."

Nobody knows. Yet."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Reddumbdancy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:38:19 2015 UTC,Not when they give us a scene that's obviously supposed to take place at or near the end of the series in the very first episode.

betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Jesus390,26,Fri Apr 24 16:41:52 2015 UTC,Why would police be looking for him? He didn't do much wrong (compared to Walt) and Walt killed everyone (besides Jesse) who could connect Saul to the meth business.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,wickys,14,Fri Apr 24 17:09:16 2015 UTC,Didn't do much wrong is an understatement
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Onlyknown2QBs,13,Fri Apr 24 19:07:45 2015 UTC,"Compared to Walt   Who murdered and produced meth, making almost $100 million illegally.  Saul is a lawyer, he is allowed to know what illegal activities his client is commuting. Apart from laundering, Saul didn't kill anyone in BrBa"
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,wickys,9,Fri Apr 24 19:18:01 2015 UTC,Yea but he was complicit in Walt's crimes. There's a difference between knowing and participating. He was an active participant. He is essentially part of a drug conspiracy. If he had nothing to worry about then why did he change his identity and flee?
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,mankstar,9,Fri Apr 24 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you're getting downvoted.  You're completely right. There's a difference between knowing about it and participating.  Even the fact that Saul offered advice on how Walt and Jesse should carry out their activities would be illegal.  An attorney can know about someone's illegal activity, but an attorney cannot lawfully advise someone on how to carry out illegal activity."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Bezzie,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:53:48 2015 UTC,Best part about BCS is we don't know if he killed anyone.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Bezzie,-11,Sat Apr 25 02:19:31 2015 UTC,I suppose details surrounding that issue would have to come to light somewhere in the series but there are many possibilities. We obviously don't know what happens to Kim because she's never in Breaking Bad. But even in this show she is a confidant of Jimmy's that always seems to be around him when nobody else is. Maybe that trend continued on the Breaking Bad timeline. We just never saw her because we never saw Jimmy alone ever. He could have confided in her about the meth business and then she rats him out.

betterCallSaul,33q3mp,kramerfan86,13,Fri Apr 24 17:21:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, but he never foreshadowed the ending.. What if the series builds up to Breaking Bad, and then skips over that ~year or so~ and continues from that opening scene of the series?"
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,LoBopasses,-28,Fri Apr 24 18:05:24 2015 UTC,I never said he foreshadowed the ending. I'm saying that COULD have been a foreshadowing.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,poopybriefs,-4,Fri Apr 24 18:25:17 2015 UTC,No.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,JonathanL72,9,Fri Apr 24 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"This ending presumes the viewer has seen all of Breaking Bad so it's very unlikely. If not, they'd have to show a lot of the BB scenes for this to even make sense, which I doubt they're going to do."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,sneak156,-11,Fri Apr 24 19:44:20 2015 UTC,The simple fact they even had Saul at the Cinnabon and the reflection in the first scene says alot to me. If they were planning on going about this show as if Breaking Bad never happened then why include this as the opening scene? It's a foreshadowing easter egg of sorts for people who saw the show. The ones who didn't had no backstory from BB that would make that scene make sense. I think they have to tie it all together for people who havent seen BB for it to make sense but for those who have seen BB it makes going back to that timeline and seeing things from Saul's perspective make that much more sense.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,rockhoward,11,Fri Apr 24 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"Imagine, for a moment, that you never saw Breaking Bad.  When Gene starts the tape, you can hear the ""Better Call Saul"" slogan, which, if you haven't noticed, is the name of the show.  One might infer that this man was, once upon a time, Saul.  It's a totally crazy theory, but stick with me, it gets way better.  Let's assume that the viewer is brainless, and doesn't understand who Gene really is from this scene.  Wouldn't you know it, there's a whole gosh darn episode about Gene, as a younger man!  Somehow his man they call ""Jimmy"" aka Gene must have something to do with this ""Saul"" fellow.  There's no easter egg here.  You're trying to piece together a puzzle that isn't there.  The only ""easter eggs"" so far have been Tuco and Mike, which aren't really easter eggs as much as they are characters in the show who happen to also be in the story of Breaking Bad."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,BoogalooChevere,-12,Fri Apr 24 20:02:41 2015 UTC,"I find your condescending remarks to be rather childish. If I'm so wrong about MY THEORY then you are trying to dissect it and discredit it? Obviously I don't know what's going to happen but that's the fun part. Coming up with your own piece to the puzzle and maybe figure something out that nobody has and then discuss it like we're all doing here. And there was another obvious easter egg that you didn't mention. The whole scene where he tricked that girl into sleeping with him because he said he was Kevin Costner. He mentioned that to Walt in BB so they are already incorporating, although i'll admit, very subtle crossover references. That are funny to people who never saw BB but also is a direct crossover to a timeline that we have already seen if you watched BB"
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,TheLawTalkinGuy,4,Fri Apr 24 20:08:17 2015 UTC,You're missing the point.  Calling back to a minor reference from Breaking Bad is a far cry from a statement such as:    The ones who didn't (see Breaking Bad) had no backstory from BB that would make that scene make sense   Just because Saul referenced it in Breaking Bad doesn't mean that viewers won't find the joke in BCS funny.  It's a crossover reference but not in a sense that BCS viewers won't understand what's going on.  Like I said. You're trying to piece together a puzzle that isn't there.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,macklemold,-10,Fri Apr 24 21:17:38 2015 UTC,I think I honestly already pieced it together my friend. There is obvious foreshadowing in Breaking Bad that always leads up to the event that was foreshadowed. I.E. the stuffed animal in the pool was a foreshadowing of a pretty crazy event that we all found out about later on in the season. The reasoning behind such a foreshadowing scene in the first couple of minutes of this series is up to debate which we all have been doing in this thread. The fact of the matter is that foreshadowing had no catharsis at the end of this season and we all know it will not tie into any season in the near future. Thats why I think it is foreshadowing the end of the show. Why else would it be included? It obviously is going to become meaningful at some point of the show. Gilligan wouldn't include it for no reason at all.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,paulbonerville,2,Fri Apr 24 22:05:04 2015 UTC,It's not that they're pretending BB never happened; they just haven't done anything that relies that heavily on the assumption that the viewer has seen BB in its entirety. That'd be a huge flaw in any spin-off show.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,paulbonerville,-9,Fri Apr 24 19:53:11 2015 UTC,"They havent had to yet... As Vince Gilligan alluded to the show takes place before, during and maybe after the breaking bad timeline. We are still very obviously in the before stage of the timeline. If it catches up to the BB timeline at some point everything will already make sense to us but it can very clearly and easily bring people who havent seen BB up to speed of what went down and it would even be refreshing for people who have seen it already because we would see the story from Saul's persepctive which we have never seen."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,bfisher91,0,Fri Apr 24 20:02:12 2015 UTC,"OP is right though.  If you write the show for someone who has never seen BB, the only way you can include the Cinnabon scene is if you cover the BB years.  Otherwise it won't make any sense to the viewer."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Dubstep_squid,3,Fri Apr 24 21:00:05 2015 UTC,It's a reference to a one off line in Breaking Bad.   They could very easily just reiterate that he had to relocate due to a high profile client getting caught. That isn't very confusing.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,dosangst,6,Fri Apr 24 22:02:09 2015 UTC,You have to skip the BB years. We have all seen what happens there. It's the before BB that matters. I hope BCS continues until when Saul meets Walt and then we get to see the after BB. We see what becomes of Saul. I'm rooting for him because Vince has made Jimmy a decent person at heart. I'm hoping he finds some solace and a bit of happiness in the cinnabon years.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,ElusiveDagger,-5,Fri Apr 24 19:35:33 2015 UTC,Well Walt was a decent person at heart. We were all drawn to him because of his downfall. We saw ourselves probably acting similarly to him in the beginning given the circumstances. He made a complete heel turn but you still were rooting for him. You still saw some of the good Walt even up to the end when he saved Jesse. He didn't have to do that but he did.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Reinbowz,6,Fri Apr 24 19:42:59 2015 UTC,"Im sorry I dont know what your moral compass is but if I had a choice between charity and meth production Ill happily take charity.  Walt is a prideful man, not a decent man."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Gamback,7,Fri Apr 24 21:50:19 2015 UTC,"There is no chance this happens. They won't end this on a depressing note. The way the series ends is with Saul doing something meaningful that we don't understand yet. Perhaps he comes out of hiding to help someone and it costs him to go to jail, but it will feel good because he did right.   Something along those lines"
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,jalexx,-1,Sun Apr 26 02:26:06 2015 UTC,There is no redemption in these stories. Only tragedy.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,jalexx,5,Mon Apr 27 23:18:28 2015 UTC,Isnt the cinnabon scene just showing present day Jimmy after he had been relocated from Albuquerque in BB? I don't think they would end the series just implying all of BB happened
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,jalexx,-5,Fri Apr 24 19:15:40 2015 UTC,I honestly think there is going to be some kind of crossover with Jesse and Walt re-appearing. They could basically have the last season as if it were the last season of Breaking Bad but have it from Jimmy's perspective. Then everything would make sense even for people who never saw Breaking Bad.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,GetOffMyLawn_,3,Fri Apr 24 19:28:55 2015 UTC,"They probably will as my theory says Nacho is most likely not dead when Saul is kidnapped by Walt & Jesse, so the writers can't kill him off, and there's a whole plotline of Lalo coming after Saul that extends into the BrBa timeline.  Also from a story-telling perspective it would make sense to get into BrBa's timeline as that would add context to the cinnabon scenes for a show that is suppose to stand on its own."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,GetOffMyLawn_,3,Fri Apr 24 19:39:14 2015 UTC,"No way that scene is the final one. Vince has said it himself that the show is not only a prequel to BB, it's a prequel, during, and sequel. I'm honestly hoping there's a season or two dedicated to giving Saul's story closure. I think what we're seeing is the beginning of the final season."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Hael5t0rm,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:52:59 2015 UTC,I honestly don't see where he goes from Cinnabon... He can't practice law again unless they want to go in that direction which would be absurd. I think the most plausible scenario is that foreshadowing scene leading to his capture in the begining of the final season and then maybe the final season bringing back chuck and other people we havent encountered yet to defend him. And him either being exonerated or found guilty. Take the Hernandez trial or any other high profile case. His would be a real high profile case like say hernandez's which would be intriguing from a fictional television perspective based on the circumstances. I think that would be real cool if the last season was just based around a trial.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,brucejoel99,7,Fri Apr 24 22:10:38 2015 UTC,"We can hope and presume that he still has money (i.e., the vacuum cleaner man didn't suck it all up setting him up in Omaha.)

betterCallSaul,33q3mp,DrDongStrong,2,Fri Apr 24 22:43:53 2015 UTC,"Will he get caught? Or could he potentially end up dead? It seemed like he thought that guy was a thug, out to get him in the first scene."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,jalexx,2,Fri Apr 24 20:09:53 2015 UTC,"I thought he was one of those bounty hunter types who tracks down wanted fugitives. For a moment, I thought he was going to get caught and the show would have Saul telling his story to the police or something like that."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,emcee_paz,2,Fri Apr 24 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"I definitely think he will get an idea from watching the old video and we will cut back to that time period at some point, but that he will make a change and get away from Cinnabon instead of taking the fall for Walt.  I don't think he's so much hiding from the cops as he is from the other gangs and the heat in general. He laundered, but to the cops he is just the guy's lawyer, I don't think they'll get him for that."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Tettamanti,2,Fri Apr 24 20:23:22 2015 UTC,I still don't understand why Saul had to go in hiding. What exactly is provable that he did wrong? Everyone was dead or out of the picture
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,awsmwsm,-4,Fri Apr 24 22:13:28 2015 UTC,There is plenty of people who knew/could know about his involvement. Think about his secretary for instance or Kim. Probably people who havent even been introduced yet.

betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Xotice,2,Fri Apr 24 22:35:12 2015 UTC,That'd be interesting but I like how the show has a separate entity from BrBa at the moment so I think that'd be TOO much of a tie in. But if it were to come full circle as a partner series that'd be perfect.

betterCallSaul,33q3mp,heisenberg0,2,Sat Apr 25 00:55:53 2015 UTC,It can. You are technically right. But if he somehow gets away with everything we know that he has done up to this point I don't know if I'd like that. Breaking Bad and even this show now a happy ending just wouldn't really make any sense. The creators do a good job stringing you along only to pull you back to reality. It was the cat and mouse game with Walt where you thought he'd get away with it but ultimately didn't but it made sense and was a better overall ending. Same thing this season. When he got offered a partnership with another firm we were pumped for him and that would have been a great direction to go but obviously that didn't happen.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,FullBearMode,2,Wed Apr 29 15:11:40 2015 UTC,"In not betting, because I don't think it would end like this. I would, however, LOVE to see this happen just to show up all these haters. Its q good theory, croosed fingers for the next few years, okay? :-P"
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,emcee_paz,2,Sat Apr 25 08:14:10 2015 UTC,Notice how he looks in the window in episode 1 like he's waiting for something. This could be.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,FullBearMode,2,Tue Apr 28 22:58:49 2015 UTC,He's definitely getting caught. I hope this thread survives for the end of the series.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,emcee_paz,2,Wed Apr 29 01:48:32 2015 UTC,"I think the opening scene's purpose was to demonstrate two things. Where Saul ended up after Breaking Bad, which is really his endgame. And that apparently nobody is after him or on to him, he's just very paranoid. And now cue the show that explains how he ended up there, Better Call Saul.  To speculate on the ending after one season is sort of rash. What I wrote above is everything we know about the ending so far and only because the writers ""allowed"" us to see it.  I would say it's better to wait until the season two premiere to see what the pacing of the storytelling is going to be. Will it pick up right after the events of season one or will some time have passed in between and, if so, how close to the Saul Goodman we all know has he become?  I would be surprised if the show continues to tell the story after the events of Breaking Bad. But it is a possibility of course.   Prove me wrong.   No one can obviously, but you can't prove you right either. It's just speculation."
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,FullBearMode,2,Wed Apr 29 06:48:47 2015 UTC,This is all speculation of course. It's a theory as I explained. But everybody in the beginning of the thread was trying to shoot me down and prove me wrong. That's why I said that.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,jalexx,6,Wed Apr 29 15:07:16 2015 UTC,That actually sounds pretty cool. I don't know why you are being downvoted like that; it's an interesting theory.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,thebread_,-6,Fri Apr 24 19:40:25 2015 UTC,"I like to think of it this way. Walt basically destroyed the lives of everyone he came into contact with, including his own. Would it make sense for Saul to be the only one to escape? I mean you can interpret his current life as being destroyed. Working in the Cinnabon living in hiding. But I think it could go a step further and result in his death/capture. Maybe Jesse finds him and kills him? That would be wild!"
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,Jesus390,7,Fri Apr 24 19:45:51 2015 UTC,Jesse wouldn't do that. After what he's been through I think he would just go somewhere way away and start over.
betterCallSaul,33q3mp,SooperModelsDotCom,-6,Fri Apr 24 19:47:18 2015 UTC,I don't think he would either but I wouldn't necessarily be surprised. I think it would be much better if he was caught. Because slippin Jimmy never gets caught. The fact that he is a lawyer and a servant of the criminal justice system makes him going down for everything even more powerful in my opinion. Brought to justice by the same system he swore to uphold.
betterCallSaul,33renl,paulbonerville,25,Fri Apr 24 22:14:15 2015 UTC,"It's kind of obvious why Saul had to leave. Lydia and Jack's gang were in business, people were getting killed, Mike was gone, Hank was an inch away from busting Walt's whole enterprise, Huell, Francesca and Kuby were cooperating... Saul had to get out of town.  My question now is... Jack's gang is dead. Lydia is dead. Walt is dead and his whole enterprise is dismantled. Hank died before ever filing his case. Skyler (I assume) made her deal with the DEA and then moved her family to the Virgin Islands or someplace else far away from ABQ. Jesse vanished and his confession was destroyed.   Theoretically at least, everyone who'd want Saul dead is either dead or long gone.   So why is Gene still so nervous? Who does he think is coming after him?"
betterCallSaul,33renl,IdiotsLantern,15,Fri Apr 24 23:24:32 2015 UTC,"Saul went into hiding at the same time as Walt and Walt was in hiding for like 11 months, so maybe the ""flash forward"" takes place before the end of Breaking Bad"

MAYBE not the Lydia thing, since it would look like she just died from a very severe flu rather then poison, but she was a high powered international business woman so her death would have been in the paper.   MAYBE he's afraid of Jesse, since signs of Jesse's imprisonment would be everywhere in that compound, but Jesse's not the sort of guy to hire a thug and Saul would know that. Jesse would be tracking him down to kick his ass personally.   So I don't know."
betterCallSaul,33renl,IdiotsLantern,2,Fri Apr 24 23:54:37 2015 UTC,"I think there would be a man hunt against Jesse too. Remember, he had those giant bags of money he was throwing away and the police knew it was drug money. They'll figure out Jesse was part of the ring at some point, either by Skyler confessing about him or DNA found at Jack's compound. But it would take too much away from the finale if they had a dual man hunt going on. Jesse needed to vanish at the end to make it a perfect ending"
betterCallSaul,33renl,imonlypostingthis,2,Sun Apr 26 05:59:15 2015 UTC,"The cops had been on the hunt for Jesse since Hank went missing. The trail went cold in the four months he was a prisoner. Signs of his imprisonment are all over the compound but ya know, unless they happen to have Jesse's fingerprints and DNA on file, proving HE was the prisoner might be hard, especially if the confession was destroyed. In which case they still wouldn't know what happened to him.   Skyler isn't going to tell them more then she absolutely has to and what she could tell them about Jesse FOR SURE would be really vague: he and Walt knew each-other, he had dinner at the house once, but she never saw him do anything.   Anyway, Jesse's smart and he knows how to avoid capture by the police by now. Maybe he's going to stick around to check on Brock, but if I were him, I'd be heading far, far away from ABQ and never coming back."

Did you forget the part where he committed at least 69 crimes during his tenure on the show?   Did you not realize that Skyler's case named him, among others, as being co-conspirators?   If Saul thinks he should leave, I trust his judgement most of all. It was too dangerous to stick around, for fear of incarceration or death.   If I'm on the run, I'm going to be paranoid no matter who I see that might recognize me."
betterCallSaul,33renl,hajisquickvanish,3,Thu Jun 4 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"Skyler acted as if she knew absolutely  nothing about what Walt was doing so its highly unlikely she would have mentioned Saul, she never mentioned  Lydia to the cops before she was threatened by Todd.  Really its 50/50 if the cops are even after him or have anything that would stick.   All those crimes he committed they never found out about. Really it's more likely no one is even after him. But after what he went through with Gus and the possibility of people thinking he might talk or the cops are after him left him paranoid enough to leave."
betterCallSaul,33renl,joosh82,2,Sat Apr 25 16:36:24 2015 UTC,"Pay attention to the newspaper clippings in New Hampshire. More information was released than you realize. You're ignoring things like Saul's guy (Kuby) impersonating a government official in order to purchase the Car Wash for the Whites, where they laundered money their drug money. That aspect (The Whites using the car wash to launder money) was well-known.  There were a million things they could pin on Saul and you can't tell me that 69 crimes, literally 69 crimes at least, are all unknown to the authorities at this point. One cannot assume they haven't figured out more information in the 4 months that Walt was gone from ABQ. They didn't just stop investigating after Walt's phone call to Skyler.  Either way, this is an asinine question. If Saul, an attorney, thinks he should leave ABQ out of fear for his own freedom or safety, then we have to trust his judgement, regardless of what WE (the audience) know in hindsight.   Saul didn't have the luxury of hindsight when he disappeared. The fall of Walt's empire was going to lead to unprecedented fallout and you can't blame Saul for not wanting to be around for the boom."
betterCallSaul,33renl,FaceTheContrast,2,Sun Apr 26 04:40:44 2015 UTC,"Short answer: I think Saul was afraid of Walt or any fallout of what Walt had done (including Welker and his boys killing Hank, etc).  At the beginning of ""Granite State"" we see Saul arriving at the vacuum repair shop. When Robert Forrester tells him he'll have to stay for a couple of days while the new life is set up, Saul is annoyed. He clearly wants to put all of this behind him. When he's told that he'll have a bunkmate he knows that Walt was recently disappeared so it makes sense that he would be the person still there. He doesn't show a sign of fear at that moment but concern, he asks ""How's he holding up?""  A few scenes later Walt is asking Saul about hitmen, people he can send after Welker's group. As they talk, Saul is trying to convince Walt to stay and ""face the music."" This suggests to me that Saul wants to distance himself from Walt and everything that has happened.  This is reinforced even further a moment later when the disappearer comes down to tell Walt that he's all set to leave. Walt says ""Change of plans. He's going with me."" Saul immediately states that he has no intention of going with Walt."

betterCallSaul,33renl,Kitteas,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:15:19 2015 UTC,"Plus the confession tape was still floating around and that implicates several of Saul's guys, probably Saul himself too. Again, Saul bailed because he felt he had to at the time; he didn't have the luxury of hindsight like the audience has. It was still the right decision since the dead bodies left by Walt don't begin to cover the legal trouble that all of their crimes will cause.  The last time Hank and Gomey were seen alive was in Huell's safe house with that other agent standing on guard. Eventually, he's going to tell the DEA that Hank and Gomey were last seen alive when they had Goodman's bodyguard in custody. If Huell broke for Hank, he'll break again with Saul on the run, especially 4 months later once Walt left a pile of dead bodies everywhere.   There was no reason for Huell or Kuby (or anyone) to stay quiet before or after Granite State's 4 month period. It was every man for himself especially when the fear of Walt/the neo-Nazis had been eliminated."

Of course keeping in mind, we know the awesome bit of television BB became, so we probably tend to look back on the first season with rose colored glasses.   BB's season one was good, perhaps very good, Better Call Saul it better IMO."
betterCallSaul,33nkbw,GuyInAChair,4,Fri Apr 24 02:51:39 2015 UTC,"While both shows are very good, i think the number of dull/stinker/snoozer episodes from the first season of BCS outweighs that of the first season of breaking bad. Part of that is probably due to the stakes of each show (the stakes in breaking bad being much more dire of course.) But also i think Breaking bad set out with a greater degree of focus and intentionality and got to its ""must watch"" status much faster.   This is not to say better call Saul is a bad show. On the contrary, it's a great show. But lately there seems to be this idea that the first season of bb is somehow vastly inferior to what came after (later seasons of bb and now the first season of bcs) and i actually completely disagree with that notion.

The Kettlemans frequently wear orange and Jimmy was drawn to the orange shirt and tie.  Green = Money. Mrs. Kettleman wore a green suit to her first meeting with Jimmy.  Blue = Lawyers, law-and-order, respectability. Kim, Hamlin, and Chuck are rarely in anything else, though Kim's shade is a little darker then everyone else's, possibly because of her murky past.  White and black = Innocence and evil, respectively, Mike wears very pale colors until it's time for action, then he puts on his black jacket and gloves.  Brown = Jimmy.

What's the difference between yellow and purple, both being between red and blue but yellow was use significantly more.

betterCallSaul,33he66,ackchanticleer,86,Wed Apr 22 15:19:41 2015 UTC,"There's something called the crime - fraud exception.  While the rule varies from state to state, it typically holds that an attorney or client can't rely on the privilege if they were both involved in a conspiracy to commit a crime.  They could each plead the fifth and refuse to testify, but that's a different sort of privilege with its own nuances."
betterCallSaul,33he66,TheLawTalkinGuy,19,Wed Apr 22 15:48:08 2015 UTC,Interesting. Thanks for the answer.
betterCallSaul,33he66,TheLawTalkinGuy,3,Wed Apr 22 16:08:53 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify a bit further, the attorney-client privilege wasn't really meant for this type of situation.  The purpose of the attorney-client privilege is to allow an attorney and his client to discuss a case openly without fear that their conversation will have to be divulged in court.  The idea is that we want clients to openly discuss their case with the attorney, both the good and the bad, so that the attorney can be certain he has all the important details before he proceeds to litigate the case.  If the client is afraid to give the attorney info, especially the bad info, then the attorney won't know if it's worth taking the case to trial or if he should be trying to get a good plea deal.  Technically, the attorney-client privilege doesn't apply to a client who is seeking advice on how to break the law.  In theory, this would mean there was never any attorney-client privilege between Walt, Jesse, and Saul, because the first thing they sought him out for was advice on how to keep Badger quiet.  As matt_the_hat pointed out, though, the prosecution would probably need some evidence establishing the true nature of the relationship before a court would force Saul to talk."
betterCallSaul,33he66,IdiotsLantern,2,Thu Apr 23 05:01:32 2015 UTC,"as someone with no actual legal knowledge whatsoever, I'd just make a guess that what they'd get Saul for probably wouldn't be his association with Walt and Jesse. Walt is dead, Hank is dead, Jesse is gone and his confession destroyed...   Just about the only truly damning piece of evidence left would be Skyler's testimony, but she's not going to say more then she absolutely has to. She's got Gomez and Hank's location, and while I don't know what kind of deal she can get with that, she'll be aiming to make this all go away so she can (probably) move her family as far away from ABQ as possible. She wouldn't want to risk it coming down to just her word against Saul's. It'd be hard to get anything really useful from her.   Again, I know nothing about actual legal tactics. My totally uninformed opinion would be, if I were building a case against Saul, I'd take the ""death by a thousand cuts"" approach. You could probably get his less high-profile clients to flip on him. Get enough of them, and you can put him away as surely as if you'd actually convicted him of being Heisenberg's consigliere."
betterCallSaul,33he66,matt_the_hat,9,Thu Apr 23 08:24:26 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, but I would add that in order to defeat the attorney-client privilege, the prosecution would need some evidence to show that Saul actively participated in a criminal conspiracy.    Saul was certainly participating in the conspiracy, for example by laundering money.  But the prosecution has to be able to prove it, and it doesn't seem clear whether they have evidence to do that.    I don't recall whether Jesse talked about Saul in his video confession.  That could make a difference.  It also could burn Saul if any of the money laundering can be traced to him.  Was there evidence against Saul that I don't remember?  Maybe so; he certainly was scared enough to run and abandon his identity, so in the context - assuming that Saul knows the privilege rules and what evidence could be used against him - it seems like he must have had good reason to be afraid."
betterCallSaul,33he66,matt_the_hat,4,Wed Apr 22 22:08:06 2015 UTC,"Its obviously not physical evidence; but the DA would get evidence after they talked to: Skyler, Francesca, Huell, and Kuby"
betterCallSaul,33he66,TheDorkMan,7,Wed Apr 22 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Skyler could definitely sink Saul if she wanted to..."
betterCallSaul,33he66,IdiotsLantern,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:15:36 2015 UTC,But she didn't because part of her defense was to downplay her own role as the wife who suffered and obeyed in silence while her criminal husband ran the whole show. I don't think she confessed that she was the brain behind the whole laundering operation. Walt made sure to pretend during that phone call that she was just some submissive afraid peon.

betterCallSaul,33he66,laidbackpk,19,Thu Apr 23 00:45:49 2015 UTC,I'm assuming Jesse would want to speak with his lawyer before talking to the police. My guess is he'd call Saul.

betterCallSaul,33he66,TheLawTalkinGuy,12,Wed Apr 22 15:50:58 2015 UTC,"so a lawyer cannot aid in the furtherance of a crime committed by their client  Edit: sorry about that incomplete thought.    Because the lawyer cannot aid in the furtherance of the crime, anything that the lawyer does do to aid in the furtherance of the crime is not subject to the attorney client relationship.  The Lawyer can remediate and mitigate, but for example, when saul hooks walt and jesse up with the bug bomb crew, that is not part of the attorney client relationship because he is aiding them in the furtherance of the crime."
betterCallSaul,33he66,TheDorkMan,2,Wed Apr 22 16:32:49 2015 UTC,"There are some exceptions to attorney client privilege that relate to future crimes. These vary from state to state but they generally require a lawyer to turn in a client if they know that their client is going to seriously physically harm someone. After that the ability for a lawyer to turn a client in varies from state to state. My state gives the lawyer the option to turn in clients who are going to commit a crime, or defraud someone but does not require it."
betterCallSaul,33he66,Kl3rik,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:29:58 2015 UTC,"I believe the rule in your state is the more common form of the rule.  An attorney can turn in the client, but is under no obligation to do so.  It's optional."

That seems like that would be some sort of conflict of interest.

betterCallSaul,33he66,melitonz,1 point,Wed Apr 22 23:33:12 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, there is no rule dealing specifically with that situation.  So there is no rule that says HHM couldn't handle the case, but to be on the safe side HHM should probably inform Jesse of their relationship to Saul and also keep Chuck from working on the case.  This is typical firm practice when a conflict of interest arises between a client and one of the attorneys."

betterCallSaul,33ethp,jimmysilverrims,29,Wed Apr 22 03:43:00 2015 UTC,"I love Mike just as much as the next guy, but he chose a life of crime, his son resisted it. Mike knew Walt was a ""time bomb"" but made a choice to work with him anyway. And not only to work with Walt, but to be a dick to Walt also. He tried to steal Walt's portion of the pre-curser that I can't spell. Pulled that shit with Gus' ex-employees which is understandable but he waited till the last minute when the cash was on the table to break it to him.  Last but not least Walt saved Mike from being arrested in front of his Granddaughter, and Mike repaid him by telling Walt what a dick he was and how he ""blew up a good thing"" which is a complete joke, Gus threatened to kill Walt and is family if Walt didn't let Gus kill his brother-in-law!! Also, Gus had Jesse held hostage and was going to keep him prisoner just like the Nazis did. Gus did in fact need to go.  Mike was and is a great character and didn't deserve to die, but he absolutely made a dumb choice to go off on Walt when he for the most part had know clue what he was talking about. Again not a reason to be killed, but people seem to forgive him for a lot.  Sorry for the diatribe, but I've wanted to get that off my chest for a while."
betterCallSaul,33ethp,tempromatic,11,Wed Apr 22 14:50:37 2015 UTC,"Well if we're going to point fingers based on stupid career choices, maybe Walt could have taken Greymatter's money instead of cooking meth while his brother-in-law works for the DEA.  He absolutely, 100% did not need to go sell meth and there was opportunity after opportunity after opportunity for him to just walk away and get out of the business.  But he didn't. Just like Mike begrudgingly agreed to work with Walt (because he needed to support his family and had few other options than local crime), Walt dove straight back into crime with the aim of becoming a kingpin (not to support his family, as he already accrued an incredibly stupid amount of cash from his ventures with Gus, but because he was greedy and power-hungry).    I'm not saying that Mike was blameless. He did agree to work with Walt and he was mean to him. I don't think ""being mean"" and ""working with someone"" is grounds for murder, but it is what it is.  Walt, on the other hand, has deliberately gotten himself over his head since day one. He's the one who insisted on renegging on the deal. He's the one who got involved with the Nazis. He's the one who murdered Mike and all those other men simply because he was scared and trying to cover his own ass."
betterCallSaul,33ethp,jimmysilverrims,14,Wed Apr 22 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"My intention was not to say how innocent Walt was. It was to try and get people to realise Mike was not blameless.

betterCallSaul,33ethp,NicolasGuacamole,2,Wed Apr 22 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting take. So would you say that a person who, in their heart is a good person, is worse that a person who is just naturally bad, because they go against their conscious (vs not having a conscience at all)"
betterCallSaul,33ethp,smaug777000,2,Thu Apr 23 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"I would say those turning away from a good nature are more to blame, those more inherently bad could be considered more damaged."
betterCallSaul,33ethp,NicolasGuacamole,18,Thu Apr 23 19:03:47 2015 UTC,"Mike threatening to beat up Saul for not giving up Jesse to be murdered, Saul realizing Mike has been spying on him for Gus, Saul feeding Mike a fake address... That scene is worse now that we know Mike and Saul have this huge history that pre-dates Gus. That's going to have to be addressed sooner or later."
betterCallSaul,33ethp,IdiotsLantern,8,Wed Apr 22 06:17:21 2015 UTC,maybe Saul eventually takes the parking-sticker schtic a wee bit too far
betterCallSaul,33ethp,LucciDVergo,0,Wed Apr 22 20:14:17 2015 UTC,What is there to address? They were in life or death situations. Surviving was more important than the friendship.
betterCallSaul,33ethp,p_a_schal,13,Fri May 1 04:35:11 2015 UTC,"The scene where Jesse tells Saul to give Kaylie half his money, and Saul says 'So have you talked to [Mike]?'  Even within BCS itself. After the Chicago Sunroof monologue in Episode 10, the closing argument that opens Episode 1 seems like a totally different scene. I dunno if anyone thought about it...but Jimmy would have been drawing from his own experience composing that defense."
betterCallSaul,33ethp,lynxminx,8,Wed Apr 22 05:41:51 2015 UTC,Saul and Mike had a friendship when all the Breaking Bad crap went down. Damn. :(
betterCallSaul,33ethp,your_mind_aches,8,Wed Apr 22 08:21:12 2015 UTC,You're reminding me- the scene where Mike is ready to flee town and calls Saul for help....and Saul puts him on speakerphone with the psycho who eventually murders him. Not one of Saul's shining moments as a lawyer.
betterCallSaul,33ethp,lynxminx,5,Wed Apr 22 08:40:14 2015 UTC,"You mean that ""Psycho"" who warned Mike he was gonna be arrested in the 1st place? Walt wasn't a psycho he was a killer just like... Mike."
betterCallSaul,33ethp,tempromatic,3,Wed Apr 22 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"He warned Mike because it was in his immediate and desperate self-interest to keep Mike out of the DEA's hands. Killing him achieved the same goal, ultimately."

betterCallSaul,33ethp,b4b,8,Wed Apr 22 17:27:06 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was funny how worried Saul was about getting his legs broken, considering he's mostly okay with being threatened, tied up and attacked. But then I guess he has some traumatic memories of legs getting broken. XD"
betterCallSaul,33ethp,onetruepurple,10,Wed Apr 22 17:55:23 2015 UTC,Saul's final scene of the series used to be a bit sad.  It's fucking harrowing now.
betterCallSaul,33ethp,Lecter07,6,Wed Apr 22 06:10:01 2015 UTC,... It's over.
betterCallSaul,33ethp,woopthat,18,Wed Apr 22 13:11:40 2015 UTC,When Walt is at his dumpy apartment and Saul comes by and tries to convince him to forget that Skyler hates him now and get back to cooking meth.  I initially didn't realized how pained Saul seemed doing it. They even cut to him back in his car looking sad and conflicted.
betterCallSaul,33ethp,Sterling_Irish,-14,Wed Apr 22 02:50:12 2015 UTC,You know I really doubt they told Odenkirk to look pained during that scene because 5 years later they're going to reveal his backstory on a spinoff show.
betterCallSaul,33ethp,woopthat,10,Wed Apr 22 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"dog, did you miss the premise of the op question?  the point is that i view that scene in a new light now that i know jimmy/saul has deep down morality. whereas prior to BCS i may have ignored or glossed over that moment of Saul looking pained, now it stands out to me"
betterCallSaul,33ethp,Sterling_Irish,-10,Wed Apr 22 19:06:22 2015 UTC,And my point is if you view any BB scene differently now you're being disingenuous - events from BCS obviously were not being considered when the BB scenes were shot.
betterCallSaul,33ethp,woopthat,8,Wed Apr 22 19:34:08 2015 UTC,It's about me viewing it now differently. Not the writers' intentions at the time.
betterCallSaul,33ethp,Gamer9131,3,Wed Apr 22 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, but while making BCS they looked back on those scenes."
betterCallSaul,33ethp,jason9045,4,Fri Apr 24 07:35:15 2015 UTC,Obviously. That's why it's a personal thing. ;)
betterCallSaul,33ethp,lynxminx,6,Wed Apr 22 20:43:10 2015 UTC,I don't think that was Woopthat's point...
betterCallSaul,33ethp,RageYellow,16,Wed Apr 22 17:56:14 2015 UTC,"Most every scene with Mike, really. I'm re-watching BB now, and he just comes across a lot less antagonistic this time through."
betterCallSaul,33ethp,LackOfABetterNombre,1 point,Wed Apr 22 00:08:52 2015 UTC,I find him to be a bit more intellectual in his early BrBa appearances. They hadn't settled him into his current role yet.
betterCallSaul,33ethp,CatoAsAPun,5,Wed Apr 22 22:48:17 2015 UTC,"Saul's reaction to Mike threatening to break his legs. That would always be a scary threat, but now we know it would be especially terrifying to him.  And Saul asking Jesse if he had heard from Mike after he was killed. He always seemed kind of surprisingly concerned in that scene, but now that we know how far back they go, it's that much sadder."
betterCallSaul,33ethp,ackchanticleer,3,Thu Apr 23 01:44:46 2015 UTC,Two good ones.
betterCallSaul,33ethp,stangytangy,4,Fri Apr 24 00:58:42 2015 UTC,It started to make a lot more sense why Mike disliked Walt. Anybody that takes that much pride and ego in being a criminal is not going to be on Mike's list of buddies.

betterCallSaul,33jnhz,LeftoverBun,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:39:00 2015 UTC,"I watched BCS before starting BB. I am now up to S5 of BB.   Jimmy McGill is a fascinating and complex character. On the one hand he has moral values that he adheres to even when it is inconvenient for him. On the other he is quite capable of being a shyster. It's watching this conflict between good Jimmy and bad Jimmy that is so interesting. Whereas Saul on BB was pretty much a one dimensional shyster. Also Jimmy is actually a fairly smart guy, even though he has made a lot of dumb choices in life. Again, that dichotomy. He's a good guy and a bad guy rolled into one.  Yes it's very slow in places. I found myself wondering why they didn't tighten up certain scenes. But a story is not always about events, it's often about the telling. Instead of wolfing it down like fast food we're meant to take our time and enjoy it.  As for the other characters they are slowly revealing themselves. So far 2 characters have been revealed to not be who or what we thought they were. No doubt more surprises are coming.  BB is very frustrating to me at times. I can't figure out why Walt keeps dumb ass I-could-fuck-up-a-wet-dream Jesse around. Seriously that kid can only fuck up it seems (and blames everybody else for his stupidity). And Walt is so damn book smart and so real life inept. They are almost sitcom irritating. We see Walt devolve into evilness but we have almost nothing of his previous life to compare it to. He breaks bad right in the pilot episode."
betterCallSaul,33jnhz,GetOffMyLawn_,3,Thu Apr 23 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, thanks for your reply. I see what you mean about the show and also think maybe it's unfair to judge BCS off one season when BB was also slow to start. I had force my way through some episodes because they felt like they dragged on forever. But thank you for your new perspective on the show!"

betterCallSaul,33i1b8,duyjo,4,Fri Apr 24 12:47:39 2015 UTC,"The two philly cops confront Jimmy and Mike for taking his note pad but Jimmy being Jimmy was able to talk them out of it. Then, iirc, one of the cops seem to know that Mike killed those other 2 cops but more or less told him not to worry about it. Jimmy showed Kim around this bigass office space he planned on leasing with the money the Kettlemens gave him. Kim was all impressed with this one office and Jimmy told her that that was going to be her office. Kim was all, thanks but no thanks. I guess HHM paid for her lawschool because she said that she owed it to them not to quit of them. Kim got the Kettlemens this great deal but part of it was that they where going to have to return the money and admit guilt. Since the Kettlemens are whackjobs they basiclly told Kim to FO and fired her. For the most part I dont think that Howard is that bad but he showed his douchy side here because he sent Kim to ""the cornfields""  ; which I guess is the shitty area of HHM to work for the Kettlemens  firing her. Of course the Kettlemens went to Jimmy. Jimmy tried to talk them to going back to Kim. But Betsy reminded him that if they returned the money they would have to return All the money. aka, the money they gave Jimmy. Jimmy ends up getting Mike to steal the money from them and he has Mike return all the money back to the DA. Jimmy ends up talking the Kettlemens into going back to Kim; which made Kim very greatful but then the episode ends with Jimmy talking a walk around the office he was going to lease and then beats the shit out of a door and gets upset because he can no longer afford to lease it. The End"
