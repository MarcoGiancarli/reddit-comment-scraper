They can be placed by a squad leader wherever.  It takes 30 seconds to spawn on them, and only that squad can spawn on it.  If an enemy gets close, it instantly despawns."
joinsquad,3e5wew,RoyAwesome,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:43:39 2015 UTC,"If I'm correct and they're using the existing Project Reality system, spawn points in Squad will come in several flavors. The first being fixed spawn points such as the team's main base. The second are squad rally points which are put down by the squad leader and are usable only by that particular squad and nobody else on the team. In Project Reality, it's required that 2 squad members be nearby in order to put the rally down. I'm not sure about the requirements for Squad. These rallies can be overrun and rendered unusable by enemies. The third flavor of spawn point and the most important, are the FOB's. These require supplies which in PR are dropped by transport choppers/logistics vehicles. This makes it important to keep your supply lines up and running. Squad leaders place the FOB's which require the team to build them. Once built, squad leaders can place other defensive fortifications around the FOB. Anyone on the team can spawn on any FOB. Right now, there is a place-holder system that generates ""build points"" (for lack of a better description) for the supplies because they don't have the logistics vehicles/supply system finished yet."

Actually one of the main reasons I'm working on improving the ruleset system is so that our designers can create different flag-based modes and map layouts without any code support.  The idea is that we (programmers) can sit down and hammer out a major code feature over 2-3 weeks while you guys get new and interesting gamemode changes that would have otherwise required code work to make happen.  This is really good for the weekend system as well as it means you will always get something new to play, even if something big like vehicles doesn't go in right away.

It's been stated in past threads/discussions/streams that destructibles are very much possible in UE4, but its the challenge of networking (making them work in a multiplayer aspect) that is so much harder of an obstacle, and therefore not a priority at all right now.   As Z-Trooper said earlier:  ""Let me just make it clear that Squad's no.1 priority is to have 100 people playing on a server reliably before we even start looking at any destruction.  This is something tooner has been doing in his down time and should not be consider official Squad material at this time."" http://forums.joinsquad.com/topic/2664-destruction-networking-tooner/#entry53153"
joinsquad,3do5mb,RoyAwesome,5,Sat Jul 18 01:46:20 2015 UTC,"Rightly so. There were many issues with locally dynamic objects not being networked in BF3, so that you'd often be hiding behind something on your computer that wasn't there on anyone else's computer.   I realize this is common knowledge to most, but it should be clearly stated that having non-networked destructibles/dynamic objects can really impact -gameplay- badly.  Its worth missing out on the eyecandy if means you know that wall on your screen is also on your enemies screen"
joinsquad,3do5mb,Mainfold,5,Sat Jul 18 02:54:10 2015 UTC,Yeah.  There is just no way in hell we can network the wall gibs.  That'd drop our player count down to 20 when they are alive.  Physics and Networking are completely at odds with eachother.  Almost every game with actual physics simulates things on the client.    You can take a look at games like Garrysmod for reasons why physics and networking just don't work.  Things go crazy and you have silly low playercounts.
joinsquad,3do5mb,Mainfold,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:15:15 2015 UTC,"Question though.  Is it a networking ""problem"" on the server side of it, or client side of it? (client information in, client information out. server information in, server information out.)  Because it seems to be a client side thing for most games that use UE destruction, but of course when you have to deal with 100 players, it would seem logical that it becomes a load on the server.. but that would only be a problem IF the server has to push that info to all of it's 100 players right? So, finding a system where players with not as great hardware and/or internet could choose to turn this off in the options (but with a disclaimer that these things will still be on for other players, and thus they need to expect that they can get shot through something that is shown as ""clearly there"" on their screen, because it's not for most other people), which would decrease the amount of clients the information had to be pushed to (but would require a restart of the game for the effect to be turned back on).  In a case like that, the server could possibly just do a call and check if the player has the effect enabled as he/she joins the server (before graphical elements get loaded in), and then choose to NOT load this for the players that effect turned off.. or even better, just make destroyed sections of a wall etc. just a transparent section, so they can see through it like everyone else, but there are no actual debris elements to network, nor would there be the need for the effects that cause it. Just in general simplifying what the destruction would be for those that turn off the effect, to a level where they can see that ""hey this is clearly destroyed"" or ""there is a hole here"", but they don't get the awesome effect of it as someone that had it on would.   Combining effects like those, could allow for even more proper distance scaling of performance as well (which UE4 is freaking amazing at). Of course, there's always the design style of having things not load until perceived by a player, so the server only gets the networking load from those that have perceived it happening on screen (usually done in 3 stages of ""it's happening"" (i.e; wall is currently being hit, explosions are happening), ""it just happened"" (i.e; the debris-movement is in progress) and ""it has happened"" (i.e; when perceived by the user, it looks already destroyed, not loading in more than the bare minimum finished destruction).  It just seems like it's good to still keep destruction as a high priority, but by all means try to find ways of lowering load on server and client, even if it results in the derpy-looking models in the distance like BF4 has, where you can clearly see how something is built up and what will come apart if hit. Though, not sure how well the latter would work since that's not how the built-in destructible models in UE4 are not built in the same manner, but you get my idea at least."
joinsquad,3do5mb,Mainfold,3,Sat Jul 18 15:02:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not the one to answer this. Like I said earlier, PM Tooner with these questions, i'm not a programmer lol  edit: also, having destructibles toggle-able is just an insanely bad idea."
joinsquad,3do5mb,Mainfold,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:24:32 2015 UTC,"How is it a bad idea if it's a possible way of reducing load on server and client, with a 2-3 lines of code?

joinsquad,3do5mb,Mainfold,3,Sat Jul 18 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"the idea of 2 different players seeing 2 different things (in terms of structures, in-tact or destroyed) is absolutely antithetical to a solid multiplayer game."
joinsquad,3do5mb,ConfuzedAzn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"..but you have to remember, this would be something focused on appealing to a wider audience, as people have different levels of hardware, and being able to somewhat run the game at decent frames with a lower-end PC increases sales numbers... and not to mention as irontaxi has said ""maybe bringing it to consoles later down the line"", would require a lot of graphical fidelity reduction, especially on such aspects of the engine, so designing in these types of things at an early stage means that it's less work later when it actually needs to be utilized (basically turning it in to a on/off switch, instead of having to re-code a lot).  Unless one of the guys working on the game has mastered both the blueprint-system and the coding in UE4, which would definitely save a lot of time and effort (possibly) porting it over later down the line.  If there's one thing that has shown itself to be true in game-design, it's that over-engineering (even though it requires more effort) usually rewards you later. But, of course, it's a matter of having the manpower and especially the skills to do it."

Can I ask how this works with ue4 and is it similar to previous ue games with the way they handled clutter.  An example is in a number of different ue games (raven shield and SWAT 4) that I played co-op with a friend the bodies often didn't sync across clients.  An example is that for a dead guy on the ground my friend would shoot his head but to me it looked like he was shooting a few feet away. Likewise I might shoot the body's head and it looked like I was shooting some where else.  I know both games handled live playable characters positions and actions properly (they were fps multi shooters after all) but the clutter was client side rendered.  What this meant was we had a totally different view of the same world. I looked closely in this video and it seemed to be well synced. How has Tooner found this behaviour?

The game has just come out of kickstarter but you can still pledge money on their website. Naturally the different tiers of pledge get you different access dates. So make sure you read up what you're pledging for if that's an option you want to use.  Otherwise sit tight and buy it when it eventually releases on steam.  Hope that helps.

A few things before you give your opinion and ideas:   I played at normal brightness/gamma, you can see perfectly without any kind of blur or black smearing but, since youtube fucks up dark scenes, I raised the gamma in 5% in the video editor for quality's sake.  No flashlights and no NVG, but the devs know about it and they are working and testing them, so you don't need to tell them to put it, they already know. Tracers don't act as a source of light in this build but the devs are working and testing it for the next builds. No needs to freak out about it. I normally play around 45~60 FPS, I had a small performance drop at night (30~35 fps), but they are already aware about it and they are fixing it (something about the sources of light). All sources of light cast shadows.   Enjoy and imagine you playing it. More Squad stuff (and other teamwork gamplays) in my channel https://www.youtube.com/user/romagnolo"

joinsquad,3d194w,GlockWan,5,Mon Jul 13 09:47:15 2015 UTC,"I'm actually currently about one third of my way into developing this exact thing. We're aiming for a February 2016 Steam release (preferably in a really finished state).  You can see some old, old screenshots here.  The one thing we're doing different is that all of our buildings are going to be architecturally destructible (I'll post some videos soon). We have 88's striking a multistory structure, blowing out floorboards, floor joists, individual bricks, wooden studs and then plaster. Player's will either die via the explosion, from falling through the floor or will be able to shoot out of the holes made in structures, creating a dynamic battlefield. While we've got this working, we're testing server message load (around the destructible elements) and working out a way to leave a skeleton so that bits of the building arent left floating in mid air. The beauty is that because we're aiming for realism, not every single player has the means, capability or want to destroy things. The destruction, therefore, will be organic in the way it occurs, and will most likely only occur in hotspots (ie, players wont be bulldozing entire areas of the map for fun).  At the moment it's a 50 vs 50 game on a 2KM square map. It also plays like Company of Heroes (you capture flags that are adjacent to other flags, and the flags are 200m in radius) but in FPS. I've gone absolutely insane on the map. It possesses the same size and depth of detail as a world like Skyrim. After playing a lot of PR and Arma, I'm keen to create immersive battlefields that feel as loved and dense as RO or Verdun. No giant endless fields.   We have a couple of other big features too that I've never seen done before. Otherwise, it's very inspired by PR and RO2."

The detail is basically PR, but with a good solid movement and weapon feedback like Red Orchestra 2. Limited roles, realistic ballistics and ordnance and player built defenses. Instead of building a single mine, you're able to lay strips of mines to create actual mine fields etc. Battles will go for around 3-5 hours. Towed AT guns, player fired artillery, a whole slew of realistic vehicles and a lot of other stuff we're hoping will make people take a closer look.  No website yet, although I have a subreddit almost ready to go. We'll do a proper press launch soon. I shouldn't have said anything, but I couldn't help see this thread and chip in.

They arent the same, and its a stretch to call them similar.   I dont remember the last time I have ever played any single player portion of a game based on modern Russian forces. It would be very interesting.  Something similar to Insurgency's bootcamp would be cool. Simple shoot house training followed by a short attack by enemy forces. Ending with an option to continue training to improve your score or moving on to a multiplayer match.  EDIT: Overall I think it would be best to have three options: One for UK forces, One for US forces, and One for Russian forces.

joinsquad,3cp2ey,SgtRoss_USMC,3,Thu Jul 9 19:14:08 2015 UTC,"More than likely we will not be ""exaggerating"" the death animation.  People tend to drop hard and fast when hit by bullets, which to me, even in a game, is more satisfying than watching a cartoon death."
joinsquad,3cp2ey,Melbosaurus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:07:56 2015 UTC,"True that I just didn't want to compare it to insurgency cause everyone does... But its the only game I play lol currently  But they had like a update for the ragdolls where before they just drop they like ""react"" before dropping I guess so like a subtle reach toward the arm if shot in the arm I guess....   I'm bad at explaining stuff, but yea not cartoonish at all I just used the wrong words.. Like armas look trash to me the way they just like jump up kinda and laggyish and insurgency's are too light maybe ,like a grenade a people go flying , Verdun seem pretty rigid when they die  I don't mind the way it acts now because that's what I'm used to,because insurgency and it is satisfying  ,agree whole heartdly ....basically are you guys planningultiple iterations of that as well?"
joinsquad,3cp2ey,ILikeTastyBread,6,Thu Jul 9 22:44:54 2015 UTC,"In my experience there isn't really this reaction to the shot/wound until they have dropped to the floor and had a few seconds for their body to work out what has happened. Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm has a nice animation system for dead players though. They can sometimes reach for the wound, writhe around a bit then finally succumb to the injury.   Totally agree that Arma has a really funky rag doll system though!"

Like getting shot in the shoulder would cause the ragdoll to have their shoulder jerk back a tiny bit as they fall over."

And honestly I think this one is better than the previously posted ""main theme"" for squad.. and if this is just the ambient music, maybe the main-theme-game needs to be stepped up a bit, just seems a bit too calm for a main theme. But then again, why not ask the community for input on what type of main theme they want for the game, what pacing the soundtrack should have etc?  Engaging the community in such things helps to popularize the game, as well as give that ""unique"" and ""contribution""-feeling to the game.

I'm a little confused why so many people are adamant on getting Steam keys, especially for the alpha/beta. Aside from the social aspect (friends list, joining through steam, etc) what is the difference? You won't lose the key somewhere--it's not like it's on a CD in some drawer. You'll be able to log into Squad's website and access the client to D/L.  And, if that's the only difference, is it really that important to be fussing about before the game is even playable?   You'll have the game. You'll be able to play. What else do you want?"
joinsquad,3cm5bw,schoff,3,Thu Jul 9 02:47:48 2015 UTC,"How do you know that is logging into Squad's site on day of launch won't bring it down meaning that we must definitely won't be able to play. That generally happens with the largest development houses, let alone a new, smaller shop hosting their own authentication system.  Steam has a content distribution network, is robust, has existing account authentication and features, patching, workshop, friend, market, trading etc.  All of this stuff is great, but I know doesn't really affect the alpha/beta of Squad at ask. Apart from load. I guess one way Squad could avoid that is to be released via torrent."

Because they aren't hosting their own data shares, they've leased shares from companies like Dropbox and Amazon.  These servers are duplicated across the globe for accessibility and redundancy. That's how its working at present, and I don't see why they would move to something less reliable when they are expecting more people.  If Squad Alpha download day brings down AWS, we all have bigger problems than playing Squad."
