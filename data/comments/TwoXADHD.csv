I got to the point where I was doing the smell test with all my clothes, making popcorn or eating ice cream for dinner because I didn't want to make real meal, my bike needed maintenance, and my work efficiency plunged. I cried at work thinking of all the things that i needed to do at home but would just take a nap then netflix binge. The first step was buying this notebook from staples It's super easy to customize it for what you need, and how you work.  Then I broke what i needed to do in to small steps. (clean one side of the room. put laundry in the washer then dryer then hang up. Clean other side of the room. etc.) Do things slowly and check back with your notebook at each step to check them off.  Also it sounds like you have anxiety, I have no idea how to control that. I normally wind myself up until i break down then my girlfriend helps me though that breakdown = /"

I want to do something but then I have to do x, y, and z first and then the effort seems too great so I don't do anything.   need to do laundry? I should put in the clothes I'm wearing. well if I'm taking the clothes off I should shower, but I should load up the dishwasher before I shower which means unloading the dishwasher... nah, staying on the couch for now is fine. consequently I don't shower frequently, or really do any cleaning frequently.   need to go to the grocery store? have to put on real clothes and makeup, should probably take the trash out when I go to the car, prep the trash, put a new bag in, have to bring shopping bags too... nope.   I don't have any tips really. I can't stand clutter and dirt but I also ignore it because I don't want to clean it. my favorite tools: a Roomba that I can run daily. a hand vac that I can use to get crumbs, hair in the bathroom and hair/ dust on baseboards and in drawers. all purpose cleaner (I love Method) to spray things down, let it sit, then wipe up. paper towels so I don't have to constantly wash rags. also a cleaner that I spray in the shower after every shower that helps prevent buildup of soap scum (also Method)."

TwoXADHD,3dq1jd,Flamesparrow,4,Sat Jul 18 09:35:36 2015 UTC,"A bit. Freelancing + part time job. I will say that if you sell physical items, you will need to be quite prepared for the amount of time spent marketing, making an online presence, understanding ecommerce, and figuring out the logistics of shipping. Not to daunt you, but, handcrafts is a crowded market. There is always the option to sell locally too, which works for a lot of people.  I have a little ritual that gets me started - wake up, have a quick shower while the kettle's boiling, make coffee, have a smoke at the window with it, and sit down. By the time I sit down my medication has kicked in and my mind has been warming up as I move around and get ideas about how to spend my day. I'll usually check a feed of blogs for news and inspiration til my coffee's done, and then get cracking.  Sometimes I have too many ideas or potential tasks, and it's hard to differentiate between what's important, what's on my plate this week, and what I want to investigate on the side. I'll find myself mentally panicking, just a little bit, in the middle of a process video; I can't focus on WTF the person is saying because I have this alarm bell ringing that there are things that need to be handled today or are going to get messy soon, if I don't sort my shit out. This may or may not be true - this is an actual ""impending doom"" symptom of my anxiety, lol.  I have a pad of lined paper where I write out things I need and want to do today so I can reference it regularly when I get confused or panicky.  Writing that all out makes me sound a little a crazy (I know you all understand). But on the outside it looks pretty normal, haha. Freelancing and working from home is immensely satisfying but will be disappointing for the first couple months if you focus entirely on profits and views, instead of toodling along and making new things and innovations while keeping your online stuff updated. Be tenacious."

Bad things: sporadic income and the need for good time management.   What I did was set a block of time during the day where I had to do some work. During that block of time I had to complete something. What I found with being self employed was my schedule could literally be whatever I wanted, as long I met the deadline by clients. So I had to be especially strict on myself because there wasn't anyone else who was going to make me accountable.   Don't expect to do work all day though, because you will end up burning out.

The first thing I do when I start feeling overwhelmed is clear out my mental space by making a non-organized list of all the things that are on my mind. Literally everything that I need to do and all of my random thoughts. From ""buy cat food"" to ""someday I will organize my office"" to the million things I need to do for work. I always immediately feel better and less overwhelmed. Next, I make a ""priorities list"" and write down the top three things that MUST get done. Then I build on that list and make a ""next action"" list. Break down all the little things that need to be done in order to achieve the big goal, then start checking off the list.

TwoXADHD,3d9xon,marijuana_andmakeup,4,Tue Jul 14 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"If it were me, I'd go to school locally and graduate debt free.   I graduated a bit early from an expensive college with loans, but I changed my career plans a dozen times after graduation. I'm 26 and a lot of my friends were in the same boat, trying to figure out what the hell to do with our lives.   I ended up enrolling locally to take the pre-reqs I need to become a midlevel provider and now I'm applying to grad school (so overwhelmed!).   If I were to redo my life, I'd have gone to state school and graduated without debt. My alma mater is relatively prestigious, but I really think that doesn't matter much. The much more important factor is how much time and effort someone invests in their education.   For example, I met a grad student at my uni who had graduated from the local, low ranked college. She stressed to me that she worked her ass off and that undergrad reputation did not matter. Even though the classes were huge, she made it a point to get to know her professors, read extra journals and material on her own, etc. She was amazingly driven and I admired her very much. I always wished that I could be that disciplined and focused in my life.   Anyways, sorry long tangent, I've forgotten my point, but best of luck to you!!"
TwoXADHD,3d9xon,KindOwl,2,Tue Jul 14 21:25:00 2015 UTC,"That is great advice, thanks for sharing your experience.  The thing about the local university is that there really is just one professor I can work with, I'll have to take a lot of non-major electives to get the credits in because he teaches two or three classes each semester. Plus I'm not talking about transferring to a prestigious school per se, just one with better opportunities for mentorship.   My philosophy has always been to side with the bottom line, but now that I'll qualify for Pell grants (and I'm also eligible for scholarships from Native entities) I bet I could finish at a state school with a better history budget for less than $25k.  Totally rambled there, but thanks for giving me the opportunity to talk it out!"
TwoXADHD,3d9xon,KindOwl,3,Tue Jul 14 22:47:17 2015 UTC,"Daaang only one professor who can be a mentor, that's pretty bad. I guess it's not that important if you want to go to a professional graduate school like law/med school, but for your field, I could see that being important.    Yea, if you have access to a lot of financial aid, it could totally be worth it.  As an independent, you could probably get fed loans to cover the rest and they're okay, since they have income based repayment and forgiveness options.

TwoXADHD,3d9xon,sd_local,2,Tue Jul 14 23:23:59 2015 UTC,"So I'd make an appointment with said professor, see if you like them and can work with them and them alone for three years as well as ask their opinion with regard to your goals."

TwoXADHD,3d9xon,sd_local,3,Wed Jul 15 06:15:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with KindOwl - local and debt free is great.  But if you really want the advantages of a different school, then option 2 will probably serve you best.  Get your GPA up locally, then transfer.  It's three years either way; pick one and commit to it.  Option 3 sounds like a desperation move to me; trying to squeeze 3 years into 2 is more likely to result in a spectacular crash, especially for a person with ADHD.  You said you're 24.  I graduated at 47, and most of my classmates were in their late 20s and 30s.  Graduating at 27 won't put you at any disadvantage; it's all about what you do and how well you do it.  Best of luck."

TwoXADHD,3cub0c,megz0rz,5,Fri Jul 10 20:58:59 2015 UTC,"this is not the question you were asking, but do you think it's possible your sleep was severely impacted after being robbed? have you been to talk therapy since the incident? it's not a coincidence that strattera was working for 10 years and then didn't work after one event. and, meds don't really work unless you're pretty well rested.   forgive me if this sounds rude, but from the given information there seems to be a LOT of anxiety (rightfully so given what you went through, PLUS a new job) that needs to be addressed with a therapist and possibly cognitive behavioral therapist before changing everything about your medications.   edit: also, I became less emotional on an IUD (Mirena) than I did on the pill because the hormones are localized. I stopped having a period altogether and the only PMS I got was cramping, obviously YMMV and it may take some time for PMS symptoms to decrease"
TwoXADHD,3cub0c,officialskylar,2,Fri Jul 10 21:46:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, it was DEFINITELY impacted by being robbed--I woke up to people in my house, the night after I chased someone off who broke into my car. I just felt like no where was safe but work.  We got an alarm system installed, but I couldn't shower without all doors locked and the alarm on and even then if something slammed I was out and looking around. Luckily my (sister's fiance's mother) has a PhD in therapy and works on a marine base with soldiers with PTSD so she was really vital in my recovery. However, I got robbed a year ago, and the new job 3 months ago, and I can really say that its' not the amount of sleep, it's more that I either can't fall asleep in a reasonable time, or I wake up at 5 am and can't fall back asleep.  I don't have the hypervigilance anymore, so it's not that as much as it's any kind of life anxiety keeping me up.  I've put up some really intense blackout curtains recently which slightly help--otherwise the second the sun is up I AM AWAKE (very similar to when I'm 100% unmedicated).    The other reason why I know it's not PTSD is that my impulse control has started to creep in--I am keeping it mostly in control but I am aware of it, and that's the hardest thing to modulate right now.  That's probably a firehose of information for a question, but there you go!"

Since ADHD is for life, it's beneficial to them (drug companies) for you to start on their medications, as you will likely continue when you don't need assistance anymore.

But the thing you need to know is that You are NOT ALONE in this. Millions of people out there just like you don't know what to do with 'all this crap'. It's a pandemic. I too have this problem.  Some people are easier at hiding it than others. They shove it away in drawers, in cabinets, under beds (with risers so they can fit MORE STUFF), in closets, in attics, basements... Just ask anyone with a garage with their car out front. Those of us who get overwhelmed easy aren't so easy to quickly shove it away in all these crevasses because we don't know what it is. If we don't see it in front of us, it might as well not exist. So it's everywhere in plain sight.  Just one bit at a time. Pomodoro the shit out of that stuff. Listen to Welcome to Night Vale, it has maigcal cleaning properties (seriously, everybody who cleans to that podcast finds they get more done in time--because they're distracted by Carlos's perfect perfect hair... I digress) Listen to a podcast that makes you feel good. listen to music.  Have a friend that will make you accountable for the stuff you're getting done.

Throw the other stuff back in the baskets.  Take it all home.  Now the fun part:  Pick a couple of nice movies, settle down to watch them, and fold all that stuff on autopilot.

My husband was chilling in the living room (right next to the kitchen) and didn't notice any particular reason why it took so long. He was to one who actually told me how long I took. He knew based on how many episodes of Always Sunny in Philadelphia he had watched while I was doing them. I had no idea until he mentioned it.   But this kind of happens with everything I do. I go to get ready in the mornings, thinking it will only take 30 minutes or so, and an hour later I am still not even close to ready. I have tried having alarms and stuff go off every 15 minutes or timed for each task but it just stresses me out and I never keep with it. Time sucks."

He knew based on how many episodes of Always Sunny in Philadelphia he had watched while I was doing them. I had no idea until he mentioned it.   Hmm...maybe he's onto something!  I know that for mindless tasks like doing the dishes or showering, it helps me to have some form of entertainment that also lets me know how much time has passed.  Like, I usually bring my laptop over and play whatever I'm watching on Netflix while I'm washing dishes, and I play music while I shower so I can tell myself stuff like, ""OK, this song just started, and you just started shampooing. You need to have have finished shampooing, rinsed, and put in conditioner by the end of this song!""  When I put in the effort to put it on, music in the morning definitely helps me to keep from suddenly realizing I've been brushing my teeth for ten minutes.    Again, though--my biggest hurdle is actually starting the dishes or getting in the shower, so take my advice with a grain of salt."
TwoXADHD,3c8lp5,vanilla_chickadee,3,Mon Jul 6 05:03:46 2015 UTC,"Laundry is my biggest problem (my litmus test for whether meds are working, in fact!) - my shortest cycle is 27min (+2 for door unlock) and I try not to walk away and get distracted in that half hour.  I stay around and get dishes done, wipe surfaces, pick up living room, tidy shoes (you know, a lot of those little things that otherwise don't happen).  That half hour is then allotted to straightening and bits of cleaning that I might would otherwise just walk past and 'leave for later' (ha).  That way, I'm still right there when the machine beeps at me to take the clothes out, PLUS it was a finite window of time for getting other things done.  Like /u/ThisAppleThisApple said, a lot of my problem is actually starting things, though I do also take too long.  Having that half hour kinda 'fenced in' helps me to think in terms of ""this is just what's happening now, and it'll be over in half an hour"".  It forces a beginning point, but also duration.  My house is a WIP, but my kitchen system is to keep the counters as clear as humanly possible.  No appliances that don't get daily use.  Nothing to clutter the surfaces more than absolutely necessary.  We toast under the grill so no toaster or crumbs, I use a stove-top kettle, so no electric kettle either.  I got rid of the dish rack recently, because it just accumulated dishes that never got put away and grew unmentionables in the stagnant water underneath.  This helps me because if the kitchen underneath the dishes/crumbs is clear and 'nice space', I'm more likely to consider it worth my while to get the dishes done and clutter put away.  Still trying to implement this through the rest of my house, ofc.  I have a dishwasher, but tend to do everything by hand anyway.  Not sure why, really... mostly the economy and environmental reasons, probably, but also... you know that phrase 'out of sight, out of mind'? ... yeah... not a good thing for ADD types, amirite?  More general cleaning adaptations for me have been to make sure cleaning products are easily to hand.  Obviously depends on your house layout etc, but we have one bathroom (upstairs).  I bought a new sink bucket thing (... not a proper bucket... like a short, square bucket for in the sink... don't know if they have a name?  anyway, not a proper bucket, because those are deep and a black hole for sh!t), one where you can keep sprays and products upright so you can see them, plus sponges/cloths/whatever and tuck in an upstairs cupboard.  This removes the hurdle of having to round up supplies before tackling the cleaning.  My vacuum cleaner lives upstairs, where it is needed most.  I replaced my old (but nearly unused) mop and bucket with a steam cleaner when I found a good one at reduced price - still don't 'mop' as often as I should, but it does happen.  Ultimately, it's still hard, but if you can simplify down to reduce the amount of permanent clutter in your life, I think it helps immensely with keeping on top of the transient crud.  It is overwhelming a lot of the time, but you're not alone in the struggle.  Organisation is super important, but there are pitfalls there too - since medication, I've been clearing out so much old junk that I was never able to face and most of it is stuff that I bought pre-diagnosis to try to organise life, but that just added stuff.  Resist the temptation as much as you can to actually buy stuff that might help - work with what you've got until you identify an actual need for a thing, then don't rush to find that solution immediately, or you'll end up with more crap.  I dunno, does that make sense?  If you have storage cupboards that are making life harder, rather than easier, purge.  It's another job that is hard to get started on and will probably take you longer than it needs to, but the time you'll get back in the long term from the improved functionality is worth it.  I accept the time sinks in those instances, because it's kind of an investment.  Anyway, this advice is sponsored by a half-eaten bowl of cereal and an unattended load of laundry in the machine (because I was SUPER ORGANISED this morning and put it on before taking my son to school, thus breaking my own damn system).  edit: omg f_ing typos"

We thought it was a sleep disorder along the way, so I was tested for narcolepsy and sleep apnea as well (in 2010-11). My main symptoms were fatigue and some cognitive difficulties - I was really struggling at work and couldn't think clearly AT ALL. I was exhausted 3 hours into a 9-5 work day. Pretty sure my supervisor thought I was clueless (it was more than I should have taken on considering my state then, but I persisted). Still, I'm fortunate that things weren't worse.  As a result, I was on antibiotics for a year straight. I ended up switching to a primary care physician that specializes in functional medicine (couldn't afford a lyme specialist)- he had me on probiotics, an expensive custom multivitamin, a shit ton of supplements, and I seriously modified my diet- no gluten, dairy, yeast, mushrooms or caffeine allowed. I had an issue with candida as well, so I was taking anti fungal medications on and off.   Finally got off of antibiotics in February 2013- I was feeling much better, took another lyme test, and it came back negative (yay!) The thyroid issues popped up a few months later, and I started receiving medication for ADHD around that same time as well (I had previously been unmedicated).   My energy levels are still lower than they should be for someone my age- I could very well still be dealing with adrenal issues and candida, but I'm trying to cure these issues by eating well and by making sure I get enough sleep. I think things have been improving- I'm able to socialize a few times a week now. Grad school's been a struggle, but my current job is going extremely well (I work anywhere from 48-60 hours/week)."

Under the supervision of my doctor, I decided to go on an Adderall vacation so I wouldn't build a tolerance. Doing this has the effect of lethargy and increased appetite. It also makes the concentration lapse.  So what?  Well I am also diabetic. I ate a whole lot, slept a bunch, and forgot to take my insulin. I had blood glucose spikes and could hardly move for several days. I also had severe flu-like symptoms from the withdrawal.   I went back on the Adderall but at a lower dose. BG is fine, I feel okay. Still a weird effect of Adderall (or the lack thereof)."

I usually will dedicate a saturday and a sunday or odd day in the week to get off of the Adderall to give myself a break, and I'll have coffee that day instead so my mood  doesn't ever drop...a tbsp of baking soda and some water also helps to potentiate it or make it clean again. Some things to try."

Usually up to four days I'm okay.  But I take a break and I'm pretty useless for the next couple of days, so I take advantage of my down time and get extra naps and laze around.

I'm stay at home mom in charge of the house, two kids, etc. I could do 6 things at once but none of those things would ever get 100% completed. Now that I'm on Adderall I can focus and complete tasks but I'm very overwhelmed if I have to remember to do multiple things at once. Stomach pains. Not just a lack of appetite but actual sore stomach. I found that it happened more often with CorePharma brand so I don't use those anymore. It still happens maybe once every week or two though. Leg cramps. Waking up in the middle of the night with a charlie horse is the worst. A few times they've lasted over 5 minutes. Not fun. I've increased my magnesium intake to 600-800mg a day (spread out) and make sure I stay well hydrated. Some days I crash really hard when coming off my afternoon dose. This makes it difficult to stay awake which I have to do. If I sleep before 11pm then my body naturally wakes up around 2am wide awake thinking it was nap time. Not good.

I looked up if legs cramps were a common side effect of adderall and it seems like it does happen to quite a few people. So that combined with my body constantly flushing it's electrolytes means I need to be extra diligent with supplementing. I found that certain generic brands effect me differently. The ""crash"" is harder on some, stomach aches, etc. I found a kind that I liked at Costco but just refilled there and they have something new. We'll see how that goes. I have no problems getting up in the morning regardless of how much I've slept. Even before adderall this was the case.

When I take it, no matter how low the dose, I immediately get this feeling that my gums are swollen. By day 2 or 3, my tongue has developed ulcers (that I can't see) and there's a metallic taste in my mouth, as if my gums are bleeding.  I tried Adderall multiple times, over multiple years, at different doses and slightly different (XR v. instant release) formulations. After a few days, the same symptoms would return.  I honestly don't know how my focus or attention is on Adderall because I'm so preoccupied with the intense, painful feelings that I can't separate out my focus/attention improvements, if there are any.  I visited a dentist while on Adderall and asked him to look in my mouth and see if he saw anything. Every poke and prod felt like a poker-hot brand on my swollen, inflamed, purple gums.  The thing is, he didn't see swollen, inflamed or purple gums. He couldn't see any sores/ulcers on my tongue. The sensation is all in my head, and happens with many ADHD stimulants.  So, that's what's wrong with Adderall. Ritalin isn't much better. I'm currently on 50mg Vyvanse and 300mg Wellbutrin/Buproprion XL. I have to skip a day every 10 or so to keep the ulcers and mouth problems away.

Adderall can cause leg cramps/muscle fatigue so I was waking up with leg cramps again once I started it back in October. It took me awhile to figure out why all of a sudden I was getting leg cramps again and realized it was the Adderall that I added to me diet. Now I've increased my magnesium to 600-800mg a day (taken throughout the day) and make sure I'm well hydrated.

I'm having a hard time with this though because I'm an advocate of Health At Every Size advocate, and loving yourself the way you are, and it feels like I'm betraying that by doing something that is essentially equivalent to a weight loss program.

Within a couple weeks I had an amazing amount of energy. Something a morbidly obese person wouldn't normally have. My daily ""fog"" was lifted and thought more clearly which is why I'm sure it helps with ADHD. My racing mind stayed the same though. My sleeping did get better but I still suffered from insomnia until I started on Adderall. I've been eating keto for almost 3 years and have dropped over 115lbs. I'm less than 10 pounds from my original goal weight (150lbs) but since this is a lifestyle change my body will just keep losing until it's where it's suppose to be and I'm fine with that. My blood panel, heart rate, blood pressure are all great while eating keto which is a huge change from before. One of the best perks is I no longer carb crash. My mood isn't constant ups and downs from eating. I'd crash hard a couple hours after eating carbs and get really moody.    I suggest trying out this way of eating for the benefits other than the weight loss to see if you like it. Read all the information in the side bar at /r/keto and then there is also /r/xxketo which is great as well.

I have a pretty easy job where my symptoms don't really get in the way, but in the next couple months I'll be switching positions to something more challenging. I talked to my doctor about it, and she prescribed me something to try and see how it works.  Just tell your primary care doctor about some of the problems you've been having, and ask if they think trying out a medication might be helpful.

I'd still encourage you, and anyone else with ADHD, to get in with a psychiatrist when you can, or if you can. GP's don't know the ins and outs of the various medications, and how they act on the various neurotransmitters like a psychiatrist does. My GP was like, ""Here's some Ritalin, there you go."" But Ritalin gave me very bad side effects.   It took my most recent psychiatrist to take those side effects seriously and to work through multiple protocols before I found one that worked really well for me."
TwoXADHD,3bg01y,speedycat2014,3,Mon Jun 29 15:51:32 2015 UTC,"I was officially diagnosed late last year. I was a 36yo female, married, mother of two. I had known for years that something was off and it was just getting worse. Always thought I suffered from depression and just had no motivation because of that. Started researching my symptoms more a couple years back and figured out I had ADHD. Females are overlooked for this growing up because they are people pleasers and overall a lot easier to teach in school in general. I finally broke down and told my husband about a year ago about some of the things I had been dealing with on a daily basis. It took me another 9 months or so before I had the courage to go in and talk to my GP. I had originally just said that I wanted to talk about mental health issues and they asked specifically what it was about. I said that it was with focus. When I went in for my appointment I told her about my daily struggles and how my brain would shoot around thoughts faster than I could verbalize. How I constnatly cut people off to talk about what was on my mind because I knew if I didn't say it then then it would be gone when it was my turn to talk. I absolutely hate that because I hate being rude. That I couldn't ever get anything completed. How I felt like a terrible wife because my husband worked hard for our family so I could stay at home but I wasn't ever able to keep up with the chores around the house which I felt was my job. I broke down in tears while I was talking to her. I told her I remembered in elementary school how a teacher stopped mid lesson to call me out in front of the whole class. He yelled at me about how if I just paid attention more then my grades would be better. It was so humiliating. Etc, etc. She had me fill out at questionnaire which I identified with on most questions. She told me right away what was going on and reassured me that she would help me out. We started on non-stimulants because I didn't want to just jump right into them if something else was going to work. Strattera was first and I had to go off them within 5 days because of the horrible side effects. There is a huge warning with Strattera about suicidal thoughts with young kids and teenagers. I wasn't suicidal but it felt like every single emotion had been sucked out of my body. I had to force myself to smile at my children, I felt void. My husband was really worried and told me outright that I needed to stop taking them. Next was Wellbutrin which caused severe dizziness to the point of nausea. I spent a lot of time lying down during the week I was on that. After those two didn't work we started on Adderall. She gave me a prescription for 5mg pills and told me to slowly increase until I felt the dose was right for me, decrease if it was too much, etc. With some tinkering I found that 20mg in the morning and 10-15mg in the afternoon is right. I love that she saw that I was able to take my health into my own hands and didn't need a lot of babysitting. She gives me three written one month prescriptions at a time and then I have to go back in for refills. We talk and she checks my heart rate, blood pressure, etc. I know I was so reluctant to seek help because of the stigma attached to ADHD and specifically Adderall. I also didn't want to admit that I needed help, that I couldn't fix this on my own. It's interesting because I'm very open with friends and new people about being on Adderall but I still have yet to tell my family outside my husband and kids. I still feel a small sense of shame. Or maybe it has something to do with breaking it to my parents that I had something ""wrong"" my whole life and they never caught on to it. I remember my Dad giving me shit my whole life about not accomplishing as much as my older sister (who is now a doctor). The shame and guilt still linger within me but I'm slowly dealing with everything."

TwoXADHD,3bg01y,speedycat2014,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:12:22 2015 UTC,"I'd say GP or Therapist/Psychologist for the referral, depending on how her insurance covers it and what they require. I went straight to a therapist who made the referral initially.  Now that it's been diagnosed by 3 separate psychiatrists, I just call a psychiatrist when I'm new to the area, and get them up to speed. Also, by the third time it was diagnosed, I finally stopped trying to pretend I didn't have it and ""came out"" to several people."

But quite literally! I had a hard time finally accepting it until my current psychiatrist looked at some scores from a 1:1 assessment when I was 7. She pointed at 2 low scores that were real outliers for my other very high scores and said ""These 2 right here are the smoking gun. (They were scores for 'processing' and 'coding'  - essentially how well I processed information, I think.) This confirms that you have ADHD."" It was really interesting. Until she pointed out this ""evidence"" from a test that I recall taking, and I wasn't trying to do anything but my best on it - I remember, I always thought maybe I was just lazy and lying to myself.  Also, the Netherlands... Aaaah I'm so jealous. :) Want to visit there some day. Is it as wonderful as it always sounds?"

TwoXADHD,3bg01y,speedycat2014,2,Mon Jun 29 12:31:32 2015 UTC,"I had the reverse happen, sort of. I came in complaining of depression and my psychiatrist saw the degree of ADHD and figured that was my primary diagnosis and wouldn't put me on antidepressants until we'd figured out the ADHD meds I needed and found that the depression was still present, although to a lesser degree.   It seems that they consider and treat the most primary symptoms (I guess bipolar outranks ADHD which outranks garden variety depression) before moving onto the ones that could just be comorbid."
TwoXADHD,3bg01y,Fredthecoolfish,2,Mon Jun 29 15:47:51 2015 UTC,"I had the exact reverse- a few doctors tried to treat me for depression, and I kept giving up because the anti depressants didn't seem to actually fix the fact that I was consistently failing, just that I felt like a failure, and that just felt fake. I finally found a therapist who saw the adhd and worked on treating that, and for the first time the depression is starting to wane a little!"
TwoXADHD,3bg01y,speedycat2014,2,Tue Jun 30 06:16:14 2015 UTC,"My first question is this: Was your behavior noted as problematic in school? Did you experience difficulties with schoolwork, grades, etc? If so, do your parents (or you) have your school records? Report cards, etc?  A key factor in the diagnosis of ADHD is that symptoms must be present from childhood. I forget the exact age, the DSM-V raised it up a bit, but when I was diagnosed I think they were looking for onset of symptoms as early as 5-7 years of age.  I was diagnosed for the first time when I went to a therapist with the chief complaint of, ""As I grow older, I don't feel I'm growing wiser. I'm growing dumber..."" I had recently become a project manager, and at 29 I couldn't handle what was being thrown at me. That, on top of losing my keys, and all the other shit.  First thing she did was ask about school, even though I was 29. I threw out my standard joke, ""School was horrible. Hell, if I'd been born 10 years later I'd have been so doped up on Ritalin I wouldn't know if I was coming or going!""  That was when she referred me to a psychiatrist who gave me my first diagnosis. At 29. I literally thought you grew out of ADHD so I couldn't still have it, but I was sure I had ""had it"" as a kid.  Since then, I've had 2 other psychiatrists arrive at the same diagnosis. Here's how they all went down:   First guy (above) had me fill out a questionnaire about behaviors. Interestingly enough, certain items on that questionnaire, that I identified very strongly with, were key indicators of ADHD. (Particularly the questions: 'Were you last picked for teams in school or uncoordinated?' and 'Did you wet the bed at a late age in childhood.' That one was embarrassing, but I did wet a couple of years past when I should have.) I offered to show him my school records, but he wasn't interested. Second guy diagnosed me after I moved to a new town. He also wasn't terribly interested in my school records. He just took a history and then sat me in front of a computer for some ""tests"". I thought to myself, ""I wonder what happens if I deliberately try to fuck up this set of tests. Would they even notice?"" Answer - No. Or perhaps deciding to deliberately fuck with a computer response test for ADHD is in and of itself a confirmation of my symptoms? Third woman diagnosed me after the second guy just became too far away to drive to. Oddly enough I set up an appointment with her and asked for antidepressants. She asked about my behaviors in school and I actually said, ""Ehh I've been diagnosed with ADHD twice before but I didn't like being on the stimulants they prescribed me, so can you just prescribe antidepressants? I think that will fix it."" Once she heard I had school records, she asked me to bring them in and quizzed me on every little comment. ""Why did you get an 'N' in art in third grade?"" ""Hell if I know... I was probably goofing off."" ""When your teacher says you could do best if you just applied yourself, what was she talking about?"" etc. This psychiatrist was very interested in my school records and even photocopied the thick folder of documents to include in my patient file.   My point being this: I showed up at each appointment (well, the third one I had to come back again because I was sure she wouldn't care) with my school records. I had established, third party evaluations from the age of 5-18 thanks to my neurotic, hyper-organized mother, that showed I had problems with daydreaming, impulse control and behaviors.   Hell, at 7 an IQ test was administered and on the results the testing guy specifically wrote, ""Speedycat's parents brought her in for testing because of concerns about some of her behaviors at home and at school."" That was a WISC test, and my scores were ""textbook ADHD"" according to my current psychiatrist. In fact, she refused to put me on antidepressants until we got my ADHD medicated, because she was so sure the depression was just a comorbid symptom.  tl;dr Summary: If you have experienced this to a troubling degree from childhood, make sure they know it. Back it up with documents where necessary. ""Drug seeking"" types come in and probably won't understand, and can't back up, that they have had issues since childhood.  Good luck!"

TwoXADHD,3bagb9,thelastmindbender,7,Sat Jun 27 09:15:38 2015 UTC,"The inability to regulate emotion is one of the key executive function deficits with ADHD, although you're right that it doesn't show up as a diagnostic criteria explicitly, although it's likely covered by ""impulsivity"".  In my experience, people with ADHD (including myself) are quick to anger and quick to spin back down.   Medication has helped me mellow a bit on the emotional front, as well as age. I'm 43 and have been dealing with emotional/focus/behavior issues all my life from ADHD. I wasn't diagnosed until I was 30, so in the 13 years since I've at least been more self-aware and watchful over my emotions. I still get in situations where I feel like my rage will blow up out of control, or my impatience turns to frustration which turns to tears, but my husband knows what to expect and knows how to help redirect me when he can. (He can't always do that successfully though.)  Once you understand executive functioning and where ADHD deficits show themselves, it's a bit easier to step back and think, ""Aaaah I'm feeling this way because of that."" and that distance helps with coping, I think."
TwoXADHD,3bagb9,speedycat2014,3,Sat Jun 27 11:11:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, definitely. Looking back now, it sounds so obvious since cognition and emotion are interconnected but I really didn't realise it until a few days back. I've been diagnosed when I was 18 and I'm now 25. Before I was diagnosed with ADHD I thought that most of my symptoms were personality traits (I didn't really understand what personality traits were back then I guess), because I really identified with them. Like, not being able to feel and deal with time, being disorganized, impulsive. It was hard for me to realise that all those things were actually symptoms that were just written down somewhere that everyone with this disorder has. It took a while to accept. So also my reactivity, is something I thought was just my temperament (so that would make me pretty much a crazy bitch in my self judging eyes), or maybe a sign of another disorder. So I always felt like there was something else wrong with me but I didn't know what. Now I know that even that was ADHD all along."
TwoXADHD,3bagb9,parab0loid,2,Sat Jun 27 11:37:30 2015 UTC,"I knew that people saying: ""Before you react, you should leave the room, think about it, and then bring up the subject in a mature way"" didn't help me at all, I know it is the better way to react, but helloooo.. impulsivity! But now I understand better why I just can't do that.   For me, this took practice. And learning shit the hard way. I don't always do it, though, and it is tough! I think the key is recognizing that you're in a situation where your immediate reaction will cause further damage and forcing yourself to have the restraint to do it the ""mature way"" with that in mind. Like, I think there were a few times when I'd have spats with my ex where I'd just tell him that I was going to another room because I needed to chill out before I said anything."

Here's some things I do/stuff you might consider looking into:   take a bath.  The heat and humidity make me drowsy as well as doing wonders for getting my body to relax.  Being physically tired can sometimes make it harder for some people to go to sleep because the body is tense and stressed from the exertion it's been put through, so relaxation can help do stretches/light yoga.  Goes along with the whole relaxation thing.  When the body's all loose and relaxed it makes it easier to find that comfy position, which is vital for successful falling asleepedness (technical term there) Silence. Sounds are stimulating.  Stimulation is interesting, and interesting things are bad when trying to sleep.  I have found no music, no TV or anything, is far more sleep-inducing than calm, soothing sounds.   And my last ditch go-to for when nothing else works (and I'm not yet ready to chug nyquil)...   Not Meditation.  It's like meditation, except if you're anything like me it's impossible to have only one voice going in your head at a time and trying to think about not thinking just makes more thoughts happen.  So instead I lie down on the floor, eyes closed, hands relaxed at my sides and feet slightly apart, and I catalog every part of my body.  Laying on the floor is important 'cause it is not a surface you sleep on, so it has no association with the thing your brain is trying to avoid.  Starting from the feet and slowly working my way up, I think about each body part:  their shape, how they feel, what I use them for, how they function, am I ticklish there, does it sweat or get stinky, etc.  When I've cataloged it all, I imagine that part relaxing until it turns liquid and melts into the floor, and then I move on to the next part.  If I start feeling like one area has become un-melted at any point, I start over from that part and go through the whole thought exercise again. I rarely get up to my shoulders before my brain has decided it's had enough and would much rather shut off now, thankyouverymuch.   Hope some of these help! :)"

It is not shame or even really stigma, but the fact that it's often met with the twisted affirmation of why it took so long to get diagnosed in the first place - ""yeah, everyone gets that and they just deal with it, why can't you?""  Fuck that.  No.  If it doesn't resonate to the core of your existence and prevent you from functioning on a daily basis, then you have no idea what it's like.  And if it does, then let me be the one to tell you that it isn't normal - thank me later, because no one ever told me."

If I ever remember to call to book therapy I'm fairly sure grief therapy is my best first step to be able to process that realisation of the life I've lost through not knowing."
