So, as morally outraged as we are (believe me, the exploitation of children for adults' pleasure pisses me off like nothing else.. i mean WHAT THE FUCK...), it was technically legal until now."

amazon,3e2am7,Rygerts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:15:15 2015 UTC,Is there a specific reason you want to share the shopping cart? Maybe an Amazon Wish List would better suit your needs?
amazon,3e2am7,popplenrookie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"Let's assume that I helped someone buy various fishing gear that suits them. Instead of having them do the picking and choosing, I help them out and give them the link to a shopping cart that is ready for checkout."
amazon,3e2am7,NoahThompson59767,4,Tue Jul 21 12:58:05 2015 UTC,Wish Lists are Amazon's current solution to your issue.
amazon,3e2am7,NoahThompson59767,2,Tue Jul 21 13:01:10 2015 UTC,"I must have misunderstood what they do, are you saying that a wish list is not only intended for ,for example, me making a wish list asking you or anyone to give me stuff? Is it also possible to make a wish list but not assign it to anyone?"
amazon,3e2am7,mfranko88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:18:12 2015 UTC,"You make a wish list ""Recommended Fishing Gear"" with the fishing gear you recommend. Your friend then visits your wish list and add the items they want to their cart. When they go to checkout, Amazon will ask your friend where they want to ship the items, and your friend ships them to their home address. And you're done."
amazon,3e2am7,stevensokulski,2,Tue Jul 21 13:27:13 2015 UTC,That's really confusing but still exactly what I am looking for. Thanks!
amazon,3e2am7,victim_of_technology,2,Tue Jul 21 13:32:14 2015 UTC,"""Wish list"" is kind of a misnomer. Wish lists are just shopping lists you can make for any purpose, and then share with other people.  Ex. I want to share with the internet the thirty best board games. Amazon wish lists allow me to easily provide a way to link anybody to a place where o buy them. I don't necessarily want to buy and/all of the items on the list. It consolidates a bunch of links into one."

amazon,3e2jqs,Etunimi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:19 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately Amazon does not make it easy, but there are a couple of ways:   Add to cart and check estimated shipping cost, as you have found out. In the ""All offers"" page for an item (""x new from y"" link), copy the shop link of the seller you want to check (the shop link is the logo or name of the seller). The link will look like ""http://www.amazon.com/shops/A12345XYZABC/ref=olp_merch_name_3"". Take note of the shop ID, in this case ""A12345XYZABC"". Then go back on the main item page, and edit the page URL to have ""&smid=A12345XYZABC"" at the end (or, if the URL already contains an ""smid"", edit it accordingly) and press enter. The resulting page will then say ""Ships from and sold by the_seller_you_selected"" and either ""This item does not ship to Your_place."" or ""This item ships to Your_place."" For sellers that are not Amazon and not using Fulfillment By Amazon (as seen in the offer page), you can see in their entries on the offer page either a ""Domestic shipping rates"" link or ""Domestic and international shipping rates"" link. If the link is the former, they do not ship internationally at all. If the latter, you can click and it see the shipping rates - if no shipping rate for your country is listed, they do not shop there. Note that ""Fulfillment By Amazon"" sellers never have the ""international shipping rates"" link even if they do ship internationally - you will have to use the other method for those sellers. Alternatively, you can add the item(s) to your cart, and then go to the cart page and click the item. This will show the same seller-specific item page as the URL-editing method. The page will say ""This item does ships/does not ship to Your_place."" This may in some cases be easier than checking the estimated shipping cost or trying to go through with the checkout.   I hope one day Amazon will show on the offer page whether each seller ships to your location or not...  edit: added 4th way"

However, setting up a Household requires authorizing the other person to use your credit/debit cards on file and vice versa, so make sure it is someone you really trust.  Note: After you create your household you'll be prompted to set your content sharing settings through Family Library. If you don't wish to share any content once setup is complete or in the future, uncheck all of the boxes next to the content types.

amazon,3e3qhq,mchlfx,2,Tue Jul 21 18:51:35 2015 UTC,"generally you dont have to sign for things.  pretty much any mail service will leave a tag with redelivery/pickup instructions. if it is something you have to sign for, the little slip will give you the option to waive that.   otherwise if you miss a couple deliveries or don't want it to be left outside, you can pick it up at the post office or ups/fedex facility."
