phillies,3e54dx,HeinrichMacrocosm,5,Wed Jul 22 00:58:32 2015 UTC,And it's a fucking shame he won't get the W because this offense is a fucking joke.
phillies,3e54dx,Radatatin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:23:10 2015 UTC,"Nola gets the L in a streak stop loss to the Rays. The LSU pitching products only run allowed came in the 3rd, off an HR from the Rays staring pitcher. The righty looked smooth and comfortable for his debut start.   With no offense to support Nola, the Phillies fell flat, with no runner reaching 3rd base. I'm glad Amaro pulled the trigger on the kid now that he's on his way out."

First and foremost, I'd consider not having your head in the game at least as bad as being lazy. Secondly, even if he thought there were two outs, he still should have been considering the possibility that someone in the field was going to screw up that play, so he should have been running out of the box regardless."
phillies,3e4iep,Swordfish08,0,Wed Jul 22 00:54:33 2015 UTC,Well you are dead wrong if you think there is no difference between lazy and a mental mistake.   I punch him in the face for lazy. I chew him out for a mental mistake.
phillies,3e4iep,chipsvisor,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:10:46 2015 UTC,"Eh, losing track of the outs is more than just a mental mistake. A mental mistake is a fielder misplaying a ball because he was too focused on what he was going to do with it before he had it.   Herrera was on the stairs, then the on-deck circle, and that entire time he wasn't watching the game or even glanced at the scoreboard once? That's flat out not paying attention, and not paying attention for damn long time. That is being lazy, just in a different way.  In any case, even if you want to excuse him for not paying attention to the game, he was still being lazy. He should have at least been considering the chance that the throw was bad or the guy covering second would miss the ball, and been running out of the batters box anyway."
phillies,3e4iep,Swordfish08,0,Wed Jul 22 01:15:32 2015 UTC,"I haven't excused a thing.  I have stated, correctly, that there is a big difference between making a mental mistake, and being lazy.    Of course it's still a mistake.  Of course he should have been running anyway.  If you actually read my posts on the subject I wouldn't need to repeat myself.  Still, the mistakes are not comparable.    Every player in baseball has lost track of the outs at one time or another.  I've seen Utley do it.  I've never seen Utley exhibit laziness.  If, as you claim, there is no difference, Utley's mistake was as bad as a lazy player not running out a ball.  We both know that is bullshit, which means you are wrong.  Ther is a very obvious difference between the two mistakes."

phillies,3dyuc8,ToTheBlack,6,Mon Jul 20 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know how well the stats back this up, but over the course of many years watching baseball, I've noticed a tendency for rookie pitchers to do well in their first few starts (and conversely, for rookie hitters to do poorly). For that reason, don't be shocked if Nola goes six innings, gives up one run and strikes out eight, and people start talking about how many Cy Young Awards he could win."
phillies,3dyuc8,jambomyhombre,2,Mon Jul 20 20:39:28 2015 UTC,"... and then the batters to get some solid film and get a good look at him.

And we attack the decision to bring him up early and begin to look past him as a future player, and there's constant discussion about how he should be sent down ..."
phillies,3dykcg,Charmanderp7,13,Mon Jul 20 16:11:59 2015 UTC,"He'll begin to get more mainstream media recognition, once the team trades Papelbon.  But I honestly don't know anybody in this sub who takes his talent for granted."

phillies,3dykcg,sokrazyitmightwork,9,Mon Jul 20 17:06:13 2015 UTC,"To be honest he could be a trade candidate this offseason. Relievers are so volatile that if you can get a quality young hitter or starter then it might be worth it. Even if Giles turns out to be star, closers are the most replaceable players in baseball year to year."
phillies,3dykcg,WhyLisaWhy,4,Mon Jul 20 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about that exactly yesterday. If they can get a good haul for him I say go for it. The team is missing too many pieces and honestly I'd say bullpen is the easiest to replace year to year. I mean hell we trotted people like 50 year old Jose Contreras, Mike Stutes and Chan Ho Park out there with decent success. Course there's always the turds like Baez and Qualls though..."
phillies,3dykcg,sokrazyitmightwork,5,Mon Jul 20 18:23:16 2015 UTC,"For sure, even our elite bullpen in '08 shows that you can scrap together a good bullpen out of nothing when you're ready to compete. If someone is willing to give up a young player who can help in a bigger capacity than a closer, then it could be really beneficial. Either way, it'll be important for him to have success closing this year if/when pap is gone."
phillies,3dykcg,Halfonion,2,Mon Jul 20 18:38:00 2015 UTC,Almost every bullpen in the majors completely flips its roster every 3-4 years. Only elite closers like papelbon stay in that role for more than 3-4 years. I think it's the most overrated/volatile position in sports do to the reasons stated above.
phillies,3dykcg,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:50 2015 UTC,"Yup and the only closers who are even close to being franchise cornerstones are guys like Kimbrel and Chapman.

He's a soft-tossing lefty with control problems. Sits 89 MPH with his fastball, throws a loopy curve but does have a good change-up. Not sure if that's enough of an arsenal to become a good major league starter.  On top of that, he's a giant at 6'6 which can spell big problems for a lot of pitchers. Even ones with good velocity and great stuff like Aumont and Andrew Miller. It takes them years to nail down mechanics and release points if they ever figure it out.  I think he's got more name value than real value at this point. If you took his profile and gave it to a pitcher that didn't come with a familiar name and a couple years of hype, I don't think people would be quite so high on him."

Just look at how many times Derek Jeter won a gold glove even though he was arguably the worst defender in the league.

If you look at the history of the gold glove, it's given to the most popular players, usually offensively, even if they don't field well. For example: Rafael Palmerio won the gold love at 1B while only starting 30 games at 1st, and being a horrible defender."

You have to take into consideration what has been given up in the past in similar type deals and they're aren't a lot.  The Mets got MLB's #17 prospect (The Blue Jays top prospect) and a very young highly regarded pitcher for RA Dickey and Hamels has had a way better more consistent career than Dickey.

We can only hope a bidding war ensues between the two. I just hope we don't settle for less talent because a team is willing to take in his full contract. The scary thing about this trade deadline is that there are about 6-7 top of the rotation guys available So the supply will probably be higher than the demand, although Hamel's is the best of the bunch unless price enters the market."
phillies,3dn79s,Halfonion,-5,Sat Jul 18 17:47:58 2015 UTC,"bash RAJ for ""asking for too much"" when they don't even know what he's asking for   There have been plenty of reports that he was asking for at least one if not multiple of Betts, Bogaerts, or Swihart from the Red Sox and Urias, Seager, or Pederson from the Dodgers. Maybe it was all bullshit, but anyone of those guys is too much.   and don't even look at what the market has done previously.   To be fair you're not exactly doing that either, at least not fully. You've cherry picked a trade with the best return as if it's the only precedent. Folks have done the same with the Samardzija/Russell deal."
phillies,3dn79s,ThePaddingtonBear,5,Fri Jul 17 18:27:24 2015 UTC,"but anyone of those guys is too much.   I respectfully disagree.  One of those guys and something else is about the going rate.  I didn't cherry pick the deal I put out there it's just a good recent example of something similar.  And I have put a ton of research into what these deals usually look like.  Look at what just some closers got last year.  Christ, it's ridiculous.  I think you may just be being negative to the point of where you're judgement on this is clouded.  He should bring back a hefty return and anyone would tell you that."
phillies,3dn79s,TheSubversive,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:35:19 2015 UTC,"One of those guys and something else is about the going rate.   Then why hasn't it happened yet? Hamels has been on the block for a long time now. If you can't accept that a Betts or Seager isn't going to happen then you're just being obstinate.   He should bring back a hefty return and anyone would tell you that.   That depends on what we mean by ""hefty."" I'm expecting him to fetch a top 25ish guy, a top 75ish guy, and some filler/lottery tickets."
phillies,3dn79s,ThePaddingtonBear,3,Fri Jul 17 18:57:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're getting at, Seager is a top 25ish guy, Betts was.  Do you mean top 15-30 type guy?  But not in the top 15?  Look, it's important to remember that they're all prospects and the league is littered with top prospects who didn't pan out, like Dom.   Then why hasn't it happened yet?   It didn't happen last year because teams over valued what they have and/or we were playing the long game and holding out for better, which is the right thing to do.  There's 14 days left, relax, the pressures on them, not us.   Hamels has been on the block for a long time now.   That's right.  And teams know we're not fucking around.  We'll keep him if need be and you'll be explaining to your fan base why they're watching October baseball without an interest...again.  We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  The only way we lose really big is if we sell ourselves short.  Then we've really lost.  No matter what, to this point right now we've played this excellent.  I'm confident the return will show that."
phillies,3dn79s,TheSubversive,3,Fri Jul 17 19:13:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're getting at, Seager is a top 25ish guy, Betts was.    Seager is a top 5 guy, and that might be an understatement. Both BA and BP had him #1 on their midseason lists. Betts would have been a top 5 or 10 guy on the midseason lists last year or the preseason lists this year had he not exhausted his prospect status by getting called to the bigs. He's posted 6.3 rWAR and 4.9 fWAR in 138 MLB games. They're both more valuable than guys who would presently fit the top 25ish description.   Look, it's important to remember that they're all prospects and the league is littered with top prospects who didn't pan out, like Dom.   I haven't forgotten that.   It didn't happen last year because teams over valued what they have and/or we were playing the long game and holding out for better, which is the right thing to do.   Every other team in MLB doesn't value Hamels properly but Amaro is mainlining the secret truth of the universe? Is that why we're hearing reports that the Phillies' demands have come down?   That's right. And teams know we're not fucking around. We'll keep him if need be... We have nothing to lose   Prices are MUCH higher on the trade market in season as teams have a better idea where they stand and there are fewer alternatives available, so I'm sure the Phillies would much prefer to deal him now. Then there's the risk of injury or decline which could leave Hamels with even less trade value than he currently has, which you already consider insufficient."
phillies,3dn79s,ThePaddingtonBear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:25:04 2015 UTC,"I think I may be being too optimistic and maybe you're a bit too pessimistic.  The reality is probably in between.    And sure Seagers a top 5 minor league prospect but Cole is a top guy in the world and has been for quite a while.  Honestly though I really don't this to get fucked up.  This trade literally holds the team future in the balance.  Whatever they do has to be what's best for the team.  If they can't get it from the Dodgers than they should look elsewhere, take less of but better quality."

phillies,3dn79s,hakan_loob44,2,Fri Jul 17 23:12:33 2015 UTC,You sound like the average /r/baseball type that strongly overvalues prospects as much as you undervalue vets and guys like Hamels. I think it's ok to do that but I think the reality is much different.
phillies,3dn79s,jimboinlimbo,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:05:12 2015 UTC,There's certainly nothing in stone that says anyone of the those prospects wouldn't be included in a Hamels deal.
phillies,3dn79s,envriogis,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:35:40 2015 UTC,"Betts, Pederson, Seager, and Bogaerts were just ranked among the 35 most valuable trade pieces in baseball by Fangraphs, which Hamels was not. Urias would have been in the top 50, but he's just so young. Swihart might be a more realistic ask, but positional scarcity and Vazquez' TJS means the Red Sox won't be parting with him.   At some point you're just going to have to accept that Hamels is not going to fetch one of the super elite prospects. A top 20ish guy and another top 50-75ish guy will probably suffice as centerpieces in the end. I said in the offseason that something like Manuel Margot + Brian Johnson/Henry Owens + filler was about right, and I think that's still the case."
phillies,3dn79s,ThePaddingtonBear,2,Fri Jul 17 18:49:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, fangraphs also had Carlos Carrasco as the top 40 trade piece in baseball. They have a pretty big anti-Phillies bias over there. Their piece on Hamels in the offseason was total garbage."

phillies,3dn79s,jimboinlimbo,0,Fri Jul 17 19:46:27 2015 UTC,Don't you think it's considerably more likely that you have a pro-Phillies bias that leads you to find their neutral commentary as partial?
phillies,3dn79s,ThePaddingtonBear,-4,Fri Jul 17 19:47:56 2015 UTC,"Fangraphs ranks those based on age and contract length and value. If you look at that list, about half of them are on rookie contracts. Fangraphs has also completely undervalued Hamels in an earlier article that got ripped to shreds. I also don't take fangraphs to be the gospel. I'm sure you can find more than a few sources that say Hamels is worth a top prospect.  I feel as though your entitled to your opinion, but saying that ""there's no way Hamels gets one of these guys"" just isn't true when speaking in a gospel like manner. Hamels is not selling for cheap and any one of Betts or Bogaerts would be a prime chip in getting him. I wouldn't let your bias clout your judgement, I'm sure the Red Sox GMs aren't."
phillies,3dn79s,envriogis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:53:59 2015 UTC,"Fangraphs ranks those based on age and contract length and value.   And talent. All legitimate factors with which MLB GMs are also concerned.   I also don't take fangraphs to be the gospel.   Neither do I, but the framework in which they evaluated Hamels' trade value is based on years of observations of decisions made by MLB GMs. Granted, it's context neutral. It doesn't consider market forces which do play a very important role in these deals. So my question would be what are the market conditions that lead you to believe their valuation missed the boat so badly?  I don't see any of his potential suitors as desperate. The Phillies all but have to deal him at the deadline as prices are much higher then than in the offseason. If they hold onto him yet again they'll probably want to wait until next year's deadline, a route that carries a whole bunch of risk.    I'm sure you can find more than a few sources that say Hamels is worth a top prospect.   I know I could. Not that I'm a ""source"" but I'd tell you the same thing. The problem is not all top prospects are created equal. You seem to have your sights set on the type that just aren't realistic."

phillies,3dn79s,palladiumhart,4,Fri Jul 17 17:45:03 2015 UTC,Also down in the article they list names attached to the Phillies who I assume are potential RAJ replacements to keep an eye on.  Rangers assistant GM Thad Levine  Royals assistant GM J.J. Piccolo  Giants VP and assistant GM John Barr  Angels assistant GM Matt Klentak  Former Angels GM Jerry Dipoto
phillies,3dn79s,No--Yes--Maybe,3,Fri Jul 17 17:17:49 2015 UTC,"As for who to target - Urias and Seager are two of the best prospects in baseball. If you can get one of those guys you do the deal. I don't think the Dodgers do it, but they could be convinced if the Phillies cover a sizable chunk of Hamels remaining contract.  On the Rangers you're looking at Gallo, Alfaro and Mazara. None of these guys are on the same level as Urias or Seager, but a package built around two of them could be attractive.  I also have this strange feeling that St. Louis is going to sneak a move at the last second to scoop up Hamels. If that's the case I have my eyes on Stephen Piscotty who profiles as a strong hitting RF or 1B at the Major League level."
phillies,3dn79s,TheSubversive,2,Fri Jul 17 17:51:40 2015 UTC,"No way they get Seager in this deal unless the Phils eat some of the money. Since they're probably going to eat Howards contract next year I dunno if this would be the right move. However, Seager is a stud in the making"
phillies,3dn79s,envriogis,7,Fri Jul 17 18:10:33 2015 UTC,No way they get Seager   Why not?  He's never had an MLB at bat.  Dom Brown and Delmon Young were both at one time ranked higher than he is.  If the Dodgers don't want to give up Seager than Fuck 'em.  Good luck.  Hope you're not watching you're arch-rival win another WS in October again this year....and next year after Greinke leaves in free agency after this season.
phillies,3dn79s,No--Yes--Maybe,2,Fri Jul 17 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. If the Phils somehow managed to get Seager that would be a huge win. I don't really care about eating the money - it's not like there's a salary cap and we're not close to the luxury tax anymore.  But imagine an infield with Franco, Crawford and Seager. The future would immediately look brighter."
phillies,3dn79s,palladiumhart,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:15:37 2015 UTC,Where would Crawford or Seager play? They are both shortstops right now.
phillies,3dn79s,palladiumhart,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:19:40 2015 UTC,"You can try to move one to 2B. Seager has also played 3B. Don't have to figure it out tomorrow, it's a wonderful problem to have."

As in the case with the Cubs when they got Addison Russell for Lester. I think you just need to get the best return possible for Hamels. Seager could be your SS for years to come. Crawford would make a fine 2B. The transition to 2B isn't as hard as from going to 2B to SS."
phillies,3dn79s,haunthorror,0,Fri Jul 17 18:27:33 2015 UTC,Seager wouldn't make all that much sense- JP can hold down shortstop in the future
phillies,3dn79s,Charmanderp7,2,Fri Jul 17 18:14:31 2015 UTC,You can move one to 2B. I'm not not turning down a stud inches away from MLB because I have someone else that plays that position in my system. We need talent before we can start worrying about anything else.

If a fair ball goes through, or by, an infielder, and touches a runner immediately back of him, or touches the runner after having been deflected by a fielder, the umpire shall not declare the runner out for being touched by a batted ball. In making such decision the umpire must be convinced that the ball passed through, or by, the fielder, and that no other infielder had the chance to make a play on the ball. If, in the judgment of the umpire, the runner deliberately and intentionally kicks such a batted ball on which the infielder has missed a play, then the runner shall be called out for interference.""

But that's not the modern player, they work hard and are talented - sure.  But they are personalities, and I mean that neither as a positive or negative, it's just a difference in the modern game v. players from Sandberg's playing days or earlier.  I mean, maybe that works for a guy like Chip Kelly on an NFL team where he has almost complete control - he can make ""culture"" his cornerstone and build a franchise around it.  But that's not how the MLB works, and there's simply not enough power focused on the manager role to execute that philosophy.  Players are different, the game is different, and you have to adapt to that if you want to survive.  A lot of folks have noted that the way he quit mid-season... he'll never get another managing job again.  And while I agree, I don't think Sandberg gives a shit.  I'll bet he's at home disgusted that the game he knew as a player simply does not exist anymore, and he just can't process the personalities and power that players have now."
phillies,3dkmr8,disco_biscuit,5,Fri Jul 17 02:57:41 2015 UTC,"I mean, maybe that works for a guy like Chip Kelly on an NFL team where he has almost complete control - he can make ""culture"" his cornerstone and build a franchise around it.   Plus with football being the ultimate team game, where every player on the field has to do something to make sure his teammates can also execute their jobs. For instance, an offensive lineman can't think he's above everyone else or the coach. A receiver still needs to block when he doesn't get the ball.   Other than maybe a sac bunt situation in baseball, you don't have that. Every player is trying to do the same thing all the time. So guys who do it better than others are going to have a different attitude and feel like they should be given more freedom to play the way they want to, not how the coach wants them to."
phillies,3dkmr8,sokrazyitmightwork,2,Fri Jul 17 13:04:10 2015 UTC,"To be fair, there are plenty of receivers out there who don't block when they're not getting the ball and plenty of players who play in half assed fashion if the play isn't revolving around them.

phillies,3dkmr8,BurnedOut_ITGuy,3,Fri Jul 17 13:56:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely and Chip Kelly already cut a high profile guy like that, which lends to the point that that style of coaching can work in football.

It's a fine idea in theory if all he had to manage was a bunch of kids or journeyman MLB'ers.  But they handed him the albatross of JImmy, Utley and Howard and said ""go undo everything Cholie's done"".  When he tried to send a message to Jimmy or Howard by benching them, he had no backing from the front office.    The other downfall was allowing him to pick this coaching staff.

phillies,3dke84,alentz3,9,Sat Jul 18 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Think about it; the greatest problems with the phillies this year have been players along the lines of Howard, Utley, O'Sullivan, and Jerome... These are all players that will be gone or retire very soon. The players that are staying in the future are the ones that are at the top of our rotation when they play.. Herrera, Hernandez and Franco. They have all exceeded expectations and will only get better. They have given the franchise reason for hope."
phillies,3dke84,mydogisnamednigel,8,Fri Jul 17 00:44:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's a an overstatement to claim that Herrera and Hernadez are going to be part of the future (and significantly contribute to the team). Apart from his recent hot streak, Hernandez has played poorly on his time with the Phillies. Meanwhile, Herrera has played atrociously since his good start to the season. They're not terrible players, but they wouldn't be starters on any other team.   Of course, Franco is part of the future. Kid is exciting. Put him on the team with Nola, Crawford, Elfin, Randolph, and whoever they can get for Hamels/Papelbon, and then the Phillies could be exciting again. However, that's a far time from now. Ultimately, the Phillies farm system is below-average (but getting better!) I wouldn't say it's impossible for the Phillies to be good in 2018, but not terribly likely.  Sorry if I come off a little combative here. I just really love baseball. And the Phillies. I might have a bit of an attitude problem too, haha."
phillies,3dke84,alentz3,0,Fri Jul 17 00:55:19 2015 UTC,"I disagree about Herrera and Hernandez. Herrera came straight from double A, and is batting .268 which is pretty good for starting in the majors and being 23. Hernandez not doing well in the past doesn't say much because he was getting chances to consistently bat then. I can easily see Herrera hitting .300 once he fixes his batting stance. And remember both these guys have added value because they are becoming excellent base stealers."
phillies,3dke84,mydogisnamednigel,7,Fri Jul 17 01:09:26 2015 UTC,"My biggest concern with Herrera is his lack of walks and his corresponding strikeouts. He has 3.2% walk rate and 24.5% rate. He's not a slugger (though not as weak as Revere), and, if he can't get on base, his value is severely limited.   I'm not exactly hot on Hernandez, but I'm more optimistic about him than Herrera. Now that I've actually looked at his stats on Fangraphs more closely, I see his BABIP isn't too unreasonable for a player with his batting ball profile and he's taking walks. I expect regression but maybe not as much as I previously thought.   I usually end up wrong about shit like this though. We'll see in a a year or two I suppose. I really enjoy having a lively discussion though."
phillies,3dke84,Xo0om,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:19:58 2015 UTC,once he fixes his batting stance   Like he's going to do that after getting to the pros.  Few players do.  IMO .268 is the high end of where I see him in the future with that stance.
phillies,3dke84,TellYouWhatitShwas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:01:36 2015 UTC,"I disagree about the Phillies' farm system being below average-- they have two top 10 talents in Crawford and Nola, a whole handful of others who might slide into the top 100, as well as a really deep cast of other interesting prospects. They are a top 10 system right now, and after drafting #1 next year and blowing open the LA market, they will be at least a top 5."
phillies,3dke84,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:47:06 2015 UTC,"In addition to whatever they get for Hamels/Papelbon, they'll have the number 1 pick next year. And after next season, they will be cleared of all the big contracts from the Ruben Era. It seems like everyone is forgetting that we have the resources to take on a ~180+mm payroll. This team can go on a Dodgers/Yankees/Red Sox spending spree after next season and bring in some veteran talent to pair with the biggest group of young talent they've had in since the last core came up.

Lively might be Top 15 or 20. Windle would have a hard time making my Top 25 if the move to the bullpen was permanent.  c)  I feel they're a little bullish on Canelo, but the reports have been quite positive this year.  Edit:  I'm on the Kilome hype train for sure.  If I still lived in NEPA, I'd definitely make a point to see him and the great team in Williamsport before the short season ends."

Really good stuff, swing and miss with late movement and it's not a ""deceptive delivery"" thing that will eventually lose effect like Happ had.  He also appears to know how to pitch as well, he's not just a thrower.  I also compared his stats to some other guys at the same levels in the same leagues.  Matt Harvey pitched in the same leagues a few years earlier and Nola's numbers blow his away.  Lastly, Nola appears to be getting better as he moves up levels.  He jumps a level and becomes more effective.  This is an incredibly good sign."

phillies,3df4qr,green-ketchup,4,Thu Jul 16 15:48:33 2015 UTC,"Apparently the Dodgers were stockpiling relievers and it became a numbers game. He was in the Phillies chain for 3 years and the Reds before that, a Texas League All-Star at the break, so my guess is he'll land somewhere."
phillies,3dbz25,broncoboots12,7,Wed Jul 15 02:12:44 2015 UTC,"Don't just trade him to make a move. If other teams won't give up what Hamels is worth, then oh well, you have an ace for the rest of the year."
phillies,3dbz25,green-ketchup,11,Wed Jul 15 14:40:32 2015 UTC,"This is so out of context.  Jayson Stark gave that opinion on the radio yesterday but it's nothing more than his opinion.  I respect the guy but I'm not going to put too much stock into this.  16 Days until the deadline and we have the single best pitcher that's going to be available for a team to increase their WS odds by a huge margin.  Not only that but they get the guy for the next few years on what seems to be a team friendly deal.  However, if teams want to be stingy with their prospects then fuck 'em.  In baseball you sometimes have to make deals you don't want to make to get the big ring and if they don't understand that then that's their problem.  You think we wanted to give up an excellent young CF'er under team control for 5 future years?   A guy who would go on to put up over 18 WAR while making less than $15M?  No, we didn't.  But we needed a closer and that was the price we had to pay and that closer put us over the top and we had a nice parade.  That's how it works."
phillies,3dbz25,TheSubversive,6,Wed Jul 15 12:26:34 2015 UTC,If the Phillies can't get at least 2 top prospects then they absolutely shouldn't make the trade and should let MacPhail and a new GM figure it out in the winter. But I think someone will pony up before the deadline. The A's gave up Addison Russell for Jeff Samardzjia last year. Teams will give up the top talent if they want Cole bad enough.
phillies,3dbz25,sokrazyitmightwork,3,Wed Jul 15 13:05:52 2015 UTC,"First, I want to say that you are, in my opinion, a good commenter.  You add to the conversation on a regular basis and you are not ""negs-stupid"" which is a new term I've come up with to describe negativity to the point that it's just dumb.  I needed some type of label to put on what I see regularly.  Second, I think this is the stumbling block - the request for 2 top prospects.  Now I don't know what caliber they're looking at getting but I think we should be happy if we can get one minor league top prospect, like a top 50 guy, and one organizational top prospect, like a teams 3-6 ranked guy.  Obviously this depends on the team as some, like the Angels, don't have a really great prospect to begin with (their top prospect hasn't even pitched 100 innings in the minors.)  What you said yesterday, about last year being a good indicator that teams would part with top prospects, is very true.  However, the only real comparable trade last year was Lester and the Red Sox went about it very differently than we will/should in going with a proven player in Cespedes, who would be pointless for us.  It would have been much easier to gauge Hamels if they got 2 prospects back.  I'm really just glad that the Phillies are taking this slow and very seriously.  For a FO that takes so much heat I think they're going about this the right way and not just jumping on whatever and holding out and keeping Hamels last year when they couldn't get what they wanted."

We will also have the strongest farm system we've had in a very long time assuming a Cole Hamels trade and a #1 pick.

The difference between those is .221, which is how many games back the Phillies are for each game played.  For the Phillies to be mathematically eliminated, they would need to be as many games back as there remaining in the season, so we have the equation:  .221x=162-x  where x is the number of games played.  Solving for x, we get 132.7 games, which means the Phillies would be eliminated around September 1 if the current winning percentages hold."

August 14 if I'm counting correctly. So 8/14 is the earliest that the Phillies could be mathematically eliminated from winning the NL East.  The Wild Card is considerably more difficult to figure out because the leading Wild Card team could become a division leader and exit the Wild Card race, and I'm not exactly sure how to account for that."

phillies,3d5ocw,TwoWebbedFeet,41,Tue Jul 14 06:30:03 2015 UTC,I agree that he needs to be traded but this is exactly why I hate divas.  He signed a contract with the Phillies so he shouldn't be so mad that they haven't moved him yet. If he doesn't want to honor the length of his deal then he never should have signed his contract. He needs to shut the fuck up and go play.
phillies,3d5ocw,muchacho2149,20,Mon Jul 13 18:58:44 2015 UTC,"Seriously.  Fans should probably be more disappointed with Papelbon than anything in this case.  I can't see how this comment helps the Phillies.  If anything, it may hurt the Phillies during trade talks, as there is now a sudden sense of urgency to trade him.  And being crudely vocal about expediting a trade doesn't really paint Papelbon in the most flattering way.  Who is seemingly still the media's darling with the whole crotchgrab last year."
phillies,3d5ocw,RicsFlair,5,Mon Jul 13 20:53:47 2015 UTC,The crotch grab was the last straw for me.  I have never hated a Philly athlete more than Jonathan Papelbon.  At this point I would probably trade him for a washing machine.  He's probably such a cancer in that locker room.

phillies,3d5ocw,CrunchyKorm,2,Tue Jul 14 04:02:32 2015 UTC,"I like where the Sixers are right now. If we had held on the old regime even one year longer, there's a chance that Hinkie and Brown end up somewhere else.

But if you do want to follow some, and try to watch the Cape Cod league to see what college players stand out (that's where guys like Ian Happ who went 9th this year started to stand out in the summer) or the US usually brings a bunch of prep players together, where top HS players start to make a name for themselves.  Otherwise, the best you can do at this point to hope for the future is to follow Crawford and Nola.  Follow the Reading team that has some exciting pitchers with Crawford.  I'm a big fan of Carlos Tocci who's in high A now too.  So there are some players to watch in our system, it's just too early to look at the draft.  Edit--And Cornelius Randolph has started well in Rookie league, which is exciting.  Hopefully his bat allows him to move quickly like Crawford has."

In fact, we're paying him like the best closer in the league. If the guy didn't recognize that this was a sinking ship when he got on, then who is he to act like he knows a damn thing about front office decisions and can tell them what they need to do.   If he did recognize it was a sinking ship and got on anyway, because of the money, then he should shut his mouth instead of demanding that a) he gets traded, b) he's the closer on his new team, and c) guarantee that his option is picked up by his new team.  I respect what he is as a player, but god damn is he annoying as shit as a person."
phillies,3d74t6,sokrazyitmightwork,2,Tue Jul 14 12:31:37 2015 UTC,"I agree that he doesn't ""deserve"" anything as he's being handsomely compensated for his work. However, I think his comments were directed at the front office not making an effort to fix the leak in the sinking ship. Instead of shopping veterans (Utley, Hamels, Pap, etc.), spending on FAs, or bringing up deserving prospects (Nola), they've kind of just sat and said ""Chase and Howard are old and unproductive, Lee is hurt, and 1 ace and a closer can't carry us...well...shit."" There doesn't seem to be a plan in place. They're not trying to compete right now, but they're not exactly planning for the future either."
phillies,3d74t6,Ship_of_Fools26,2,Tue Jul 14 15:31:54 2015 UTC,"I just don't think it's his place to be publicly criticizing the front office. He either a) was just as dumb as they were thinking the team would compete, or b) didn't care because of the money. Either way, he really has no place making comments like these.   And to your points, yes they are planning for the future. they are strengthening this farm system through the draft, the Rollins and Byrd trades, and international signings. And they very obviously have Hamels, Papelbon, and Revere available for trades, among others. Why the hell would they bring up Nola right now and start his service clock? Don't be surprised if he's not up until half way through next year so as to maintain club control for the 6 years after that when they are actually competitive again. Franco was the only the deserving prospect who needed to be up this season, and they've obviously done a good job pacing his progression."
phillies,3d74t6,sokrazyitmightwork,2,Tue Jul 14 15:40:01 2015 UTC,"Pap signed in 2012 - the year before we won 102 games. At that point, I think he was understandably under the impression that if a big player went down to injury, lack of production, etc., they would replace him with another big player - like what the Yankees, Dodgers, and Red Sox do. Instead, the Phillies just let things slowly crumble to literally the worst team in baseball. He has every right to ask why he's still there, even if the answer is ""because your contract is too big to move and no contenders need closers other than the Cubs - and Theo hates you.""   Why the hell would they bring up Nola right now   Because they have one of the worst starting rotations in baseball history, he's crushed shit at all levels of the minors, and he's already 22. Same reasons Franco was brought up."
phillies,3d74t6,Ship_of_Fools26,2,Tue Jul 14 17:10:17 2015 UTC,"Nola coming up right now offers absolutely no benefit to the team. In fact, long term, it just means he will hit free agency sooner and for what? so he could pitch on the worst team in baseball and have his confidence shaken by terrible defense, no run support, and a coaching staff that will be gutted in 3 months?  And you think throwing money at Ellsbury or McCann or Napoli or Beltran was the right move? The Phillies were already brushed up against the tax threshold in 2011 and 2012. They weren't going to bring on more huge contracts for aging players - which is the only way to upgrade in the short-term through free agency. If Pap thought that was possible, then that is the exact lack of understanding of the front office side of the game that makes him completely unqualified to throw around public criticism of the people cutting him checks bigger than anyone else at his position."
phillies,3d74t6,sokrazyitmightwork,0,Tue Jul 14 17:27:08 2015 UTC,"Couldn't the same be said for Franco? Why is he up here? He's the same age as Nola and if we're concerned about burning young players team controlled years when we're bad, he should still be in AAA too.  And we may all scoff at the Yankees contracts, but they're in first and we're on pace to lose 110 games. Pap may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but you generally don't spend $13m a year on a fucking closer if you're not planning on continuing to spend your way out of problems. If the Phillies are really committed to a rebuild, he should've been long gone. Pap is definitely a clown, but how else do you expect him to force his way out of here?"
phillies,3d74t6,Ship_of_Fools26,2,Tue Jul 14 17:41:47 2015 UTC,"The difference is Franco has been in the organization for 6 years. They saw all they needed to see from him. Nola was drafted a year ago. Franco played in AAA for more than a year, Nola has been there a month.    And we may all scoff at the Yankees contracts, but they're in first and we're on pace to lose 110 games.    The difference is that 2 of the Yankees 3 albatross contracts are actually resulting in high-level production - A-rod and Tex. That's why the Yankees are so much better this year than last. Plus they have a bunch of talented pitchers that are still within that 6 year time frame and haven't had a big free agent contract yet.   but you generally don't spend $13m a year on a fucking closer if you're not planning on continuing to spend your way out of problems.   They weren't planning to spend their way out of problems. They had already spent. They were relying on Halladay and Lee and Utley and Howard and Rollins and Ruiz to continue to produce at the time of Paps contract. The Phillies literally did not have anymore money to spend without paying a luxury tax, which they were never going to do.    Pap is definitely a clown, but how else do you expect him to force his way out of here?   By telling the front office he wants out and letting them do their jobs. He obviously has no fucking clue how that works, so he should shut his mouth about it to the media. He is on the trade block and everyone on the planet knows it. The reason he hasn't been traded is because of his laundry list of demands, and the lack of teams that can check all those boxes off while still giving us the return we want."

Agree to disagree. I think the reason he hasn't been traded is our front office isn't committed to a strategy. Pap makes $4m more than the next highest paid closer. You can't expect any contender to actually consider adding his salary and giving us a decent prospect in return. And yet, that's exactly what the Phillies' front office expects."
phillies,3d74t6,Ship_of_Fools26,3,Tue Jul 14 18:25:22 2015 UTC,"You know Papelbon is a pretty interesting case study.  Normally I would say a guy should never ""call out"" his team like that and should keep his mouth shut. But the front office (RAJ) has consistently used the media to belittle and complain about the players on this team - ""team would be better off with Howard"", ""Hernandez is the best 2nd baseman on this team"" etc. etc.  Papelbon is honestly just saying the stuff the other professionals on this team are either afraid to or are not willing to stoop to RAJ's level.  Papelbon's behavior is a reflection of the leadership from the top down. I don't blame him at all - the environment is obviously toxic and Papelbon is the only one publicly advocating to get away from it."

He let the world know that he wants to be gone and he wants it done yesterday which puts pressure on the front office.  Other teams can low ball offer and then say ""he wants to go, take what you can get.""  Without that comment it's still known that he wants out but it's not hanging around out there in black and white, teams can't throw it right in the Phillies face.  In high level negotiations you use everything you can to get what you want and conversely you need every bit of leverage you can muster."

For example, in 2008 Cole threw his fastball 54.8% of the time. Now it is 48.5%. His fastball velocity is up almost 2mph since 2008. Cole didn't even throw a cutter then. Also, he was much more reliant on his changeup back then...and again, that velocity has increased. In 2008 his average changeup velocity was 79.9mph, and he threw it 31.5%. NOW, his average changeup velocity is 84.2 and he only throws it 23.5% of the time. So yeah he is a completely different pitcher than he was in 2008...

The last two trades that I see here are ""Philadelphia Phillies traded Future Considerations, RHP Chris Oliver and LHP Josh Taylor to Arizona Diamondbacks for Future Considerations."" and ""Oakland Athletics traded C Blake Forsythe to Philadelphia Phillies for cash."" neither of which seem fucking brilliant to me.  What did I miss?"
phillies,3d0n3v,Hypertension123456,5,Sun Jul 12 21:34:13 2015 UTC,"Those future considerations are international amateur draft slots and that was actually, objectively a very good trade. I hate Amaro but you literally just gave the dude above a perfect example of how you won't let him win no matter what he does. Not to mention that any moves Ruben does or does not make are likely going to be approved/discussed with those above him, rather than him having final say, so it seems fairly unlikely that he'd ruin any potential trades in the way you're stating."
phillies,3d0n3v,Scabdates,4,Mon Jul 13 00:06:40 2015 UTC,"I will give you very good.  I just have a problem with fucking brilliant.  International amateur draft slots are pretty good, not fucking brilliant."
phillies,3d0n3v,Hypertension123456,0,Mon Jul 13 00:10:42 2015 UTC,"You're being pedantic and the dude's point is still proven. Amaro has made, at worst ""fairly good"" trades since the start of this season. Do I have faith he, alone, would get the best deals possible for Hamels, Revere, Papelbon...? Of course not. But he's not working alone with full control anymore, so that's irrelevant. We all hate Amaro just as much as you but you're hating just to hate in this thread."
phillies,3d0n3v,Scabdates,4,Mon Jul 13 00:17:02 2015 UTC,"I just think some people hold him to a very low standard.  He took over a World Series Champion organization.  Starting from that position and obtaining Ben Lively and Zach Eflin is not brilliant, it is barely adequate.  Its like people forgot what a good trade actually looks like.    On November 7, 2007, Brad Lidge was acquired by the Philadelphia Phillies along with infielder Eric Bruntlett in exchange for outfielder Michael Bourn, pitcher Geoff Geary, and Mike Costanzo.  He went on to have a fucking perfect season as closer and win the World Fucking Series to help make the Phillies World Fucking Champions.  That is what a fucking brilliant trade looks like!"

Analyzing trades in 2015 based on where the team was in 2008/2009 is more than silly. Give me a break.   On November 7, 2007, Brad Lidge was acquired by the Philadelphia Phillies along with infielder Eric Bruntlett in exchange for outfielder Michael Bourn, pitcher Geoff Geary, and Mike Costanzo. He went on to have a fucking perfect season as closer and win the World Fucking Series to help make the Phillies World Fucking Champions. That is what a fucking brilliant trade looks like!

What else are we supposed to say besides ""we hate Amaro too but the most recent trades have been good""? What is the point of an endless circlejerk about how terrible Amaro is? That opinion is quite literally the most popular opinion in Philadelphia sports right now. People aren't using these trades to say Amaro is good, they're using the trades to suggest he won't completely fuck up the next couple trades (combined with the fact that he's no longer in total control like he once was)"
phillies,3d0n3v,Scabdates,0,Mon Jul 13 02:16:41 2015 UTC,"What I actually meant were the Rollins trade and the Byrd trade.  In both cases he traded fairly expensive, older players in the last year of their deals for 3 young, fairly high upside, financially controlled pitching prospects, 2 of which are doing excellent in our system.  Neither are aces but both are heading in the ""solid contributor"" direction. Ben Lively and Zach Eflin.  You don't expect to get anything substantial for players in the situations that Byrd and Rollins were in let alone mid rotation starter prospects.  But now that you bring it up that deal for Chris Oliver and Josh Taylor should be considered a great trade too.  The implications of that trade will most likely affect 2 years and possibly 3 years of International Amateur signings, an area that has produced 4 of our current top 10 prospects and Maikel Franco.  It was essentially 2 nothing pitchers for International Slot money that will keep us from getting penalized for signing international amateurs and those penalties are usually a year long ban on any international signing over $350,000, so any good signing.  And just for good measure, Amaro ""fleeced"" Toronto in the Halladay deal and Cleveland in the Lee deal.  I would guess he got about 20 WAR for less than 2 WAR between those 2 deals."

Ben is one of the few players on this team with actual value (despite what many fans believe), and I wouldn't let him go for next to nothing.

Just check his numbers on baseball reference: http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/p/pencehu01.shtml  Dude CRUSHED it for us down the playoff stretch when we traded for him in 2011. A slash line of 324/394/560? 11 homers in 2 months? What more could the guy have done?  2012 was hardly his fault. No Utley, no Howard, no Werth, no Raul, the downfall of Roy Halladay. It was just him and Ruiz offensively. And his numbers were solid! 17 homers, 271/331/447 slash for us when we traded him. That's not All Star numbers, but that's solid contribution.  To say he wasn't that good for us grossly undervalues his contribution down the stretch in 2011 and his solid work in an otherwise difficult to watch 2012."

phillies,3ctx4v,No--Yes--Maybe,2,Fri Jul 10 21:51:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. You can't forget about them. But Cameron Rupp isn't a potential starting catcher in this league. He's a nice backup though.

phillies,3ctx4v,K20BB5,3,Fri Jul 10 22:04:26 2015 UTC,JP is years away. No need to call him up until he's ready
phillies,3ctx4v,hakan_loob44,2,Fri Jul 10 22:14:57 2015 UTC,"Cesar has come on strong.   BABIP  Batting Average on Balls In Play (BABIP) measures how often a ball in play goes for a hit. A ball is “in play” when the plate appearance ends in something other than a strikeout, walk, hit batter, catcher’s interference, sacrifice bunt, or home run. In other words, the batter put the ball in play and it didn’t clear the outfield fence. Typically around 30% of all balls in play fall for hits, but there are several variables that can affect BABIP rates for individual players, such as defense, luck, and talent level."

phillies,3ctgsy,hakan_loob44,7,Fri Jul 10 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"This article is stupid, in my opinion. Perhaps a bit harsh, but I don't really know what else to say about it.   You would have thought it would have taken something less extreme than one of the worst rosters ever assembled to finally get John Middleton out in front of a microphone.   This is completely idiotic and not how things work. Middleton can't just do whatever he wants. He owns 48% of the team, not 98%. Yes, he does have power, but it's not anywhere near this simple.   At the moment, though, it is difficult for anybody who has been paying attention for the last five years to believe we will end up witnessing anything other than the status quo.   I can't even respond to this without being offensive. This is insanely stupid and I can't believe someone wrote this and thought ""yeah this makes solid sense"". We could hire Billy Beane and this same type of idiotic logic would still hold the same level of validity (read: none whatsoever).   Until MacPhail actually installs a general manager from outside the current regime and allows that GM to install his own people underneath, I'm not sure how anybody can grade the Phillies' decision as anything better than an Incomplete.   Because GM candidates will really respond positively to Ruben Amaro being thrown under the bus and fired mid-season? Give me a break. Ruben is an idiot but that doesn't mean you can just throw him in the garbage and expect GM candidates to jump at the chance to work for the Phillies. The author cities the billion dollar valuation of the team as a reason why we should have tons of candidates looking to join the front office, nevermind the fact that literally every baseball team is a billion dollar business? Jesus. Ruben has said a lot of stupid things so far this year, but he hasn't done a completely awful job in terms of the moves he's made. We've gotten great returns on all of our trades so far, and the consensus around league front offices is that we're going to get what we're looking for in a Hamels deal. Not to mention, all of Ruben's moves at this point are surely being made in conjunction/with approval of someone else much smarter (perhaps even MacPhail himself) so it's not like we're just giving Ruben the keys for the rest of the season.  I can't even go through the rest of the article and address some of these quotes. This is flat out terrible. Just no. I wish I had never read this."

Maintaining the status quo is often the desired outcome of an executive switch. It should go without saying that a sea change should not be expected.

I'd actually rather keep revere and herrera over asche (left out brown bc i think the writing is already on the wall with him) because i think asche has diminished value as an outfielder.  he provides no other skills like the speed and fielding that revere has and asche's not even that good a hitter and doesn't have enough power to justify his streaky hitting which provides him a low avg.  if you want to be a realist, as an outfielder asche is useless, even more so on this team with 3 other left-handed outfielders.  his value was at third and he should have been traded as a third baseman."
phillies,3ctun7,feralmonkeyboy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"Asche would be a decent bench bat down the road. Spell Franco. Play some corner OF, some 1st. Even emergeny 2b. Plus he's cheap and has 15-20 hr power. But maybe another team wants him as a Zobrist light. Or upgrade at 3rd."
phillies,3ctun7,ihorsey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:26:40 2015 UTC,"Altherr has always been a really raw prospect with good physical traits, took him a long time to put the whole package together. There's no point in calling him up if he isn't going to be an every day player so probably not until something happens with Revere or roster expansion. Anyway I've really been encouraged by Altherr just because it's been a while since the Phillies have successfully developed a really raw guy like Altherr and it's a good sign that their player development is improving."
phillies,3cv3qw,Charmanderp7,6,Sat Jul 11 00:49:33 2015 UTC,"5 time world series champs!  but in all seriousness I think the offense would have been hugely improved putting Franco in between utley and howard. remember those times in the postseason where every game the opposing teams would bring in the lefty to get them out, would have made them second think that"

phillies,3cv3qw,NooclearWessel,2,Sat Jul 11 01:01:01 2015 UTC,I don't think a young/rookie Franco is a HUGE upgrade over Polly or Feliz. Especially when accounting for defense. The phillies were the best team in the league those year. They just weren't the hottest in the playoffs.

The minor league team, the Sand Gnats, has changed hands several times during my time here, bouncing from a Rangers affiliate to the Expos, Nationals and now the Mets. I saw Steven Matz pitch here a few times a couple of years ago (seemed like every game I went to, he was starting), and Johan Santana made a rehab start here a few years ago (John Smoltz did as well back around 2001).   Despite them being a Mets affiliate, it was fun being in the building when the Sand Gnats won the league championship a couple of years ago. Unfortunately, they'll be moving to Columbia, SC starting next season. I think the city is trying to recruit a beer league to come play in the now-empty stadium, but I haven't heard if it's official yet.   As much as I love Savannah, the lack of sports interest is disheartening, and it's about to get a lot worse for the foreseeable future.

Fans are wistful about Utley's prime, certainly - but very few are delusional about his current abilities at the plate.  If you want to write a piece that actually cuts against the grain, you should question why Chase was ever so deeply beloved to begin with. The fanbase seemed to develop Phil Mickelson syndrome, assigning qualities of stoicism and a strong work ethic to a man that may have merely been quiet or socially inept. Meanwhile, his black teammates Rollins and Howard (men with actual personalities) were often slagged by fans and the media for unforgivable offenses like not sprinting to first on a pop fly."

phillies,3cq0im,talaeus,3,Fri Jul 10 03:19:28 2015 UTC,"Philly fans are a bit odd with their athletes. Any comment, no matter how small, that can be taken negatively will be taken negatively, and Jimmy liked to talk sometimes. It was totally unfair how much people overreacted and yeah the racial element was not completely absent.  Perhaps the right way to handle the Philly fan base is to not talk at all until you've won a world series and then drop an f bomb in a stadium full of kids.   I love Chase and Jimmy both, and appreciate them for their different personality types. Howard has genuinely annoyed me in the past."
phillies,3cq0im,CC2560,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:42:21 2015 UTC,"I think there are logical reasons why a lot of fans may have embraced Utley more than Howard or Rollins. Howard had the best season a Phillies hitter has ever had in 2006, his first full season. After that, it seemed like expectations were set astronomically high for the rest of his career. A lot of people viewed him as our Pujols. Obviously he fell short of those expectations, and I think the left a feeling among some fans that he was underachieving. Ditto for Jimmy Rollins after the 2007 season. Basically they were victims of their own success. However, I would argue that Ryan Howard isn't as unpopular as it seems, but that's a separate discussion.   Now, compare those situations to Chase Utley. I don't think anyone can reasonably be disappointed in any season he's had up until recently. Add in the fact that he's never said anything controversial and is arguably the best postseason position player of the 07-11 teams, and you have all the makings of a very popular player.   /u/CC2560 is right though that Philly fans can be very odd with their athletes. I stated why I think people have embraced Utley more than the other two but I don't necessarily think it is justified. Like I said, it seems that J-Roll and Howard's success at certain points in their careers has been held against them at times, which is really unfortunate."
phillies,3cq0im,partingtheredditsea,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:40:13 2015 UTC,"Agree with all of this. Utley's consistency is also part of why people loved him.   Philly fans can be quite unreasonable in our perceptions of effort. Pat Burrel got a lot shit too for striking out and ""not caring"". Jimmy got shit for not running hard on routine grounders and fly balls. Howard struck out a lot and people said he just swung at whatever  like fuck it. These are all things that are untrue/taken out of proportion. But Chase never even let you have anything to latch onto like that, and as I said, he was always so consistent that no one could ever give him shit.   I think people are already coming around to Rollins and regretting the shit he got, now that he's gone. Howard is likely going to never get out of the tarnished reputation he has with the fanbase, sadly."
phillies,3cq0im,CC2560,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:45:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Pat Burrell is a good example. I have to disagree with you on Howard though. I think the reason he gets the most shit now is that he (and his contract) represents the ineptitude of the Amaro era. The team is terrible and Amaro's name isn't the one getting announced four times every night so the fans are going to take it out on somebody. Hell, even Mike Schmidt got booed at one point during his time here. I think years down the line, when the pain of losing has subsided, people will appreciate Ryan Howard much more."
phillies,3cq0im,partingtheredditsea,3,Fri Jul 10 23:54:20 2015 UTC,"Howard made these comments which are about as close to PR suicide as a Philly athlete can get:  “I know what I say is about to be misconstrued but it’s just a game. I have a beautiful wife, a beautiful child. Those things are important.”  Listen, that may be the healthy perspective for a well paid athlete whose career is on the downside due to injuries to have...but it's not one he should have shared with the public. He was basically saying ""I get paid 8 figures to be really good at this, but if I'm not, who cares cause my life is still awesome"". That's not something easy to come back from in Philly."
phillies,3cq0im,CC2560,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:58:56 2015 UTC,I think it's easier to come back from comments like that than a lot of people think.

Chase Utley is not incompetent. He isn't ""done."" He has played 64 games this year and has a terrible BABIP. He is absolutely playable, and I still believe he is above league average as a second baseman. We're talking about a guy that hit .270 last year with a .749 OPS and 106 wRC+. He is 36 1/2 years old and could certainly have another couple years left in the tank.   I will concede that he is not hitting balls as hard. I don't know what the reasoning is for that. Could be injury, his knees, his wife, who knows. I have no way of knowing if it's a fluke or indicative of his current and future playing ability.  Now, if you want to make the argument that we should move him to make room for younger players, I'm all for that.

Is he hitting the catchers glove mostly or does the catcher need to move his glove to catch it?  Is he using both sides of the plate?  Hitting black on both?

I've done some comparison of his stats through the minors with some other guys in the same league.

Maybe ~10% curve. Hits both sides of the plate well. Seemed to be on the same page as the catcher. Walked a few more than I was expecting. He threw a lot of pitches in the first 2-3 innings and was pulled after (presumably on a pitch count). A lot of groundball outs to 2b and SS. Gave up ~5 hits, mostly on the ground up the middle.

For a scout to throw a number 1 label on a spec they want two plus plus offerings. The thing about Nola is apparently he has plus plus control. Which will make his other pitches play up. I think scouts still saying he's got a 3 ceiling are just covering their asses because that's what they said leading up to the draft.

Best view of the action will probably be in the infield along the baseline (third base side has the shade for day games), but outfield seats are fun too and leave the home run possibility.   Hall of fame club is also awesome because you get the full view from the 200 level behind home plate, tho I don't know how much those cost."

I personally love right near the dugouts (first base is best because of home team, though 3rd base is good if the team is fun and not the Braves/Mets/Marlins/Nationals) because you are closer to the field/action OR the outfield (left, right, center, doesn't matter to me) because it is also a fun atmosphere with the potential for homeruns (though not so much from our Phils any more)."
phillies,3coryk,KetoThrowaway222,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:35:56 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest sitting on the first base side, and if at all possible, behind first base.  Not only is it a terrific view of the game, you're in foul ball territory, and it also positions you front and center of the giant screen (its picture should leave you in awe).  And if you're lucky, you might even appear on television in between pitches against lefties.  $70 dollars for a seat there shouldn't be too difficult to find.   I did a little research for you.  I'd suggest shooting for August 1st: Phils vs Braves because it's Alumni night, and Pat-the-Bat is being inducted into the Wall-of-Fame.  Tickets are $80 a piece (I'd suggest taking seats in section 115), but there should be plenty pre-game celebration, to go along with a great Phillies/Braves game.   Well.. just about as good as a Phils game can be this season."

You don't get a great view of the pitch type/location, but nothing beats being that close to the action.   Sitting first base side is a lot of fun, because it makes you appreciate the battle between pitchers and runners on first more, since you have a great view to see everything single thing both of them do.   Or since it;s a date, you can just buy tickets in the upper deck and have section all to yourselves. ""Rent it out,"" so to speak."

I want him wheeling out to home for a sacrifice bunt in his 70s. I want him pinch running for Ryan Howard's grandson in his 90s. Hoist his dead body up in the batter's box when you just need a hit-by-pitch.  Okay maybe that last one was a bit too far."
phillies,3clb83,NooclearWessel,17,Wed Jul 8 22:16:14 2015 UTC,"As much as the city loves Chase, I'd say it just perpetuates the cycle of the Phillies being loyal to a fault. This organization needs new talent on the field and in the front office."
phillies,3clb83,HAHA23786,10,Wed Jul 8 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"I think Chase has been more loyal to the team than visa versa.

phillies,3clb83,metssuck,4,Wed Jul 8 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more of a bench player/manager and the Phillies signing him for like 5 mil if his options don't vest which isn't that bad of a hit once they trade Hamels/Papelbon and possibly Howard this year.  Also, I'm no expert but it seems a lot of people look to Utley for advice or leadership."
phillies,3clb83,feralmonkeyboy,2,Wed Jul 8 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"managing a team is so different from being a player.  I think he'd find that the respect he got from his teammates as a player would soon disappear if players felt like they weren't getting the playing time they think they deserved or disagreed when they were pinch hit for, or you try to teach a guy fundamentals who doesn't want to hear it, etc  maybe he would do well, maybe not but the respect from player to manager doesn't always translate.  especially on a bad team it would be rough on Utley.  I like Utley too much to have him suffer like sandberg did, who was even a greater 2nd baseman and very well respected as a player.  that's why i'm glad mackanin was left to manage the rest of the season while they try to rebuild.  maybe when they get a better roster they can start looking for the manager that takes them to the next level but for now they are in development hell and anyone who manages them will suffer"

phillies,3clb83,RenderedInGooseFat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:39:04 2015 UTC,I'm saying paying 2-5 mil for Utley as player/manager is more useful to me than not. Either way it seems like we are going to have to pay him something and might as well use him for something that he may be good at since we are still in the experimental stage and it's going to be very hard to bring a manager here who wants to coach with a good background.
phillies,3clb83,RenderedInGooseFat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:36:38 2015 UTC,"Either way it seems like we are going to have to pay him something   Not if he fails to reach 500 ABs.  I can't see many teams clamoring for a 37 year old 2nd baseman with an injury history, who is currently one of the worst hitters in all of MLB (lower AVG, SLG, OPS, and OPS+ than any qualifying hitter, along with the second worst WAR, and 5th worst OBP) .  If he fails to reach 500 ABs, he will likely sign somewhere for next to nothing, or retire.  If he reaches 500 ABs, we are on the hook for $15M to him.  Amaro's statement yesterday was uncalled for, but that doesn't make it false.  Hernandez right now is a better player than Utley.  We already have a 2nd baseman for next year."

The speakers on the concourse had the Rockies play-by-play, and they were saying a big storm was about to hit.

I understand that it could mean bad luck (better defensive opposition, ground ball pitchers, etc.) - but I also thought of it as an indicator for the batter as well (they could not be seeing the ball well, off-balance, lack of power)..."
phillies,3chmx0,RicsFlair,2,Wed Jul 8 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"Rest assured Ruben has not mastered the concept of sample size.   Utley is well and truly shot, that's clear, but it makes me nuts when Ruben discusses a young guy ""taking advantage of his opportunity.""  By the time we put guys in the line-up we should have enough confidence in their ability (based on analytics) to completely ignore their first 100 at bats, if not their first 500 at bats."
phillies,3chmx0,chipsvisor,-1,Wed Jul 8 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"Where is there a sample size issue?  Hernandez has 468 career PA's and he's maintained very nice numbers throughout.  He's shown in his 212 PA's this year that he deserves to get another 200 to see if he can continue his success at the plate.  I think what's really going on here is that you and some of the other commenters on here are just little bitches who want to complain about everything.  And what's really hilarious is when you complain about things and are totally wrong about them which makes you look like the ""idiot fan who doesn't know what they're talking about.""  You are and you don't."
phillies,3chmx0,TheSubversive,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:06:32 2015 UTC,"I agree, but until his last 50 at bats or so, you never heard Amaro say Hernandez ""took advantage of his opportunity."" when Ruben says that, he means the guys had a few good weeks.  Conversely, if Ruf plays three consecutive games and doesn't get 5 or 6 hits, Ruben thinks he didn't take advantage of his ""opportunity.."""
phillies,3chmx0,chipsvisor,-1,Wed Jul 8 12:31:58 2015 UTC,"His BABIP is high right now, but he's maintained a BABIP we'll over .300 for his career. So it's not crazy high. And there's no denying his eye at the plate. He can work a walk."
phillies,3chmx0,ihorsey,5,Thu Jul 9 02:17:02 2015 UTC,Utley's current BABIP is .185. His career mark is .299.
phillies,3chmx0,DrumstickVT,2,Wed Jul 8 00:59:33 2015 UTC,"Utley's career LD% is 20.6%, while his current season is 17.4% though.  He is not hitting the ball hard, or making good contact, which leads to a lower BABIP.  Some of it may also be luck, but a lot of it is poor contact.  Interestingly, his LD% is down 3.2% from his career average, his GB% is up 3.6%, and his FB% is down .3%.  He has basically traded 3%-3.5% of his balls in play from line drives to ground balls."

The team had over 100 wins in 2011, and in four short years disastrous moves by the front office (including trading Cliff Lee and then trading for him back) has ruined this team. He is the GM. He makes the final decisions. He fucked this team up."
phillies,3chmx0,TheSublimeLight,3,Wed Jul 8 00:48:13 2015 UTC,"I never said any criticism is unfounded. I think a lot of the criticism here is excessive and I think people criticize him for things he didn't do wrong just to try to pile onto things he did do wrong. And people on this sub often put him in no win situations where they criticize him no matter what he does.   For instance someone here this week was saying he should've traded Dom brown when his value was high, to which I responded that the people that are bashing him now would have bashed him back then if he traded our only productive young player."

phillies,3chmx0,K20BB5,8,Wed Jul 8 01:39:31 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why Utley was the everyday second baseman to begin with.  He can't hit anymore and Hernandez has better range and a better arm.  The first half of last season was Utley's last gasp as a major league ballplayer.  He's been sub-par ever since.
phillies,3chmx0,OldVMSJunkie,2,Wed Jul 8 11:59:22 2015 UTC,I wish the higher ups were complete dicks and had no tact when talking about Amaro as he does to the fans and the players that have allowed him to still have a job. Utley will be a Philly icon for years to come. Amaro not so much.

phillies,3chmx0,RicsFlair,2,Wed Jul 8 11:09:54 2015 UTC,a possible solution is trade howard and platoon ruf and utley at first and have utley spell caesar at second now and then

phillies,3chmx0,RicsFlair,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:37:07 2015 UTC,That's not a solution. Amaro doesn't want Utley getting any more PAs at any position because then his option vests and then the Phillies have to pay him another $15MM for sub-Mendoza Line production.
phillies,3chmx0,ObligatoryHandle,2,Wed Jul 8 14:18:23 2015 UTC,"i don't think it's about money for the Phillies though.  One of Amaro's flaws is his sentimentality toward players.  He's even said he wanted Utley to retire as a Phillies which is why he didn't trade him last season when he had value.  It's more about Caesar playing well and deserving the time.  Also the difficulty in trading Howard and everyone else hasn't been money as they've said they've been willing to take on salary, it's about the Phillies wanting better prospects than they've been offered.  Howard had some value earlier in the season when he was hitting better.  I think he loses value each day as he gets older, same with Papelbon who they need to get rid of while he's good and   healthy."

phillies,3chmx0,metssuck,2,Thu Jul 9 01:10:10 2015 UTC,Utley has an OPS+ of 49 this year. That's Michael Martinez bad. He can't be allowed to start any longer. Especially not when his continuing to get starts will cost the Phillies tens of millions of dollars and clog up the roster for another season. And create this situation where the next manager and GM are forced to bench Utley all over again.

If I found out that management deliberately made the team tank?  Easy decision: I wouldn't buy a seat the rest of the year.  The Phillies, despite being in last, still draw 25K fans per game.  I don't think you can argue that the incremental value of a #1 MLB pick over a #2 is worth the PR damage and loyalty loss."

Just make sure to tell Mackanin to pull him after 7 that way the wheels don't fall off in the 8th.     I get the feeling there's going to be alot of disappointed Nola fans once he gets called up.

The answer to the second question is easier, because he was major league ready the moment he signed a pro-contract.  However, he has done a lot to really go from a ready to go #3 starter to someone with a more polished arsenal that really is a #2 starting pitcher.  This feeds into what does he still need to do.  He needs to keep executing his pitches and pitching games.  Nola has such an advanced feel for the game you can see him making adjustments to his pitching during the course of the game.  He can step into the majors right now and is rapidly running out of things to work on in AAA, but his time has been well spent and the Phillies have helped him become a real building block for the their future.   source.

Hell, I had a Chicago Bulls Starter windbreaker and Charlotte Hornets hat as a kid (who didn't?) and I HATE basketball.  I've always been a Phillies fan but for some reason I'd always find a random NY Stankees hat in my closet.  I never asked for one, no one ever bought me one. It was just there...taunting me.    But unfortunately I wasn't an Eagles fan as a kid.  I grew up a Redskins fan and my sister a Cowboys fan.  I guess it was because my father was an Eagles fan and we both chose teams he hated when she was 5 and I was 3.  But at least once I got old enough to really follow football, I changed my ways.  My sister took a lot longer to come around to the bird gang.  She only last season swore off Dallas (obligatory ""fuck Dallas"") and starting rooting for the birds."
phillies,3cdp98,Ghstfce,2,Tue Jul 7 18:08:04 2015 UTC,The Charlotte Hornets were one of the first teams to really jump on the modern color scheme thing of the time.  The Mariners were another team that rebranded themselves to the modern times.  It really paid off for both of them.

Why? Because they will be from here, same as I was from Philly.  I cheer for the Dodgers except for  when they play the Phils. I was at a Dodgers/Phils series about 15 years ago, and we were leaving Dodgers stadium after losing to them 10-2. I still had my Philladelphia gear on as we walked to the car. We were taking abuse from all sorts of bleacher fans. I kept saying, ""You guys won! Did you even see the game?""  After a minute, I saw a guy to my left with a Flyers jersey. A guy to my right with an Eagles jersey. I realized there were a bunch of us all walking the same way. So, I did something stupid.

phillies,3cceyv,RiskyBryzness,11,Mon Jul 6 20:41:19 2015 UTC,"I'm still wary of the farm system and their player development. I'm going to be uneasy until the current front office is removed from their positions.  That being said, I believe that there is a little bit of hope for the Phillies, but the problem is that the success is on the far horizon, and dependent on developing the young guys properly. Cesar Hernandez was trying to put down a sacrifice bunt the other night and kept trying to bunt it while getting a running start. I understand that you want to get on base, but if the call is for a sac bunt and you cannot execute that sac bunt, there is a problem coaching fundamental baseball.  That's the biggest fear that I have. Lack of fundamental playing skills. Not knowing where to be during a play. Oversliding bases, which is a problem that we've seen multiple times this season. Continually swinging at the first pitch. These issues will not be addressed with the current staff. They have proven to be inadequate. I believe that although we have highly rated prospects, they will be ruined unless great and swift action is taken."
phillies,3cceyv,TheSublimeLight,3,Mon Jul 6 21:48:05 2015 UTC,"Aside from your bold text, you greatly overestimate what wins baseball games and championships.  The WFC 2008 Phillies had 25 non-pitcher sac bunts in 5903 plate appearances.  Shane Victorino had the most of all non-pitchers with 5.  If you include pitchers, it increases to just over 1% (71 in 6273 PA).  There aren't any easily available stats for oversliding bases, this makes up for a very small percentage of the total number of outs recorded by the offense.  Edit: These stats are easily accessible!  Outs on base + pickoffs + caught stealing.  WFC 2008: 50.  Over halfway through 2015: 31.  It would be one thing to make your argument if the 2015 Phillies were losing a series of very close games.  It's another entirely when the problems can be summarized as:    Next-to-last OBP Next-to-last SLG Last in ERA+   Fundamentals don't mean anything compared to these three stats."
phillies,3cceyv,bestnottosay,7,Tue Jul 7 01:13:37 2015 UTC,"Be as wary as you like but it's not our front office evaluating these guys and ranking them where they are at.  Guys who get ranked this high generally don't fail at the MLB level.  Generally.  The Dom Browns and Delmon Young's happen but they're more the exception.  Re Hernadez's bunt attempt, he's not alone at this level.  It's just how it is.  Guys spend their whole life working on what's going to get them to the majors and sac bunting usually isn't the ticket.  ""Let's call so-and-so up to the majors, have you seen him sac bunt?  It's amazing.""  Have you seen Cesar bunt for a hit?  He executes that flawlessly.  It's just how the minors is run nowadays, everywhere.  Guys have to work on that stuff at the Majors level anymore and I think Sandberg and these older former player managers can't grasp that the way some of these younger managers can.  Hopefully though this is something system-wide MacPhail can get a handle on.  If he does it will just put our organization that much above the others.  That and producing players who all operate under the same un-flawed philosophies."

phillies,3cceyv,TheSublimeLight,10,Mon Jul 6 22:32:00 2015 UTC,"If they're ruined by not being taught how to sac bunt by their major league coaches, then they weren't gonna be that good anyway. Our staff is not ideal for fostering young talent but 1. They're not gonna have much time with Nola or Crawford anyway and 2. They're not so awful that they'd literally ruin the growth of these guys"
phillies,3cceyv,Scabdates,2,Mon Jul 6 22:44:34 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point. Coaching staffs need to reinforce good habits, or else they will become bad habits; failing a simple sacrifice bunt is indicative of that, so is oversliding bases and not backing up throws. Simple shit like this makes you lose games if something goes wrong."
phillies,3cceyv,TheSublimeLight,5,Mon Jul 6 23:37:38 2015 UTC,"Things like that make you lose games? Absolutely. But permanently stunt growth of a top prospect? I can't say I'd agree.

It seems like he's approaching that point. I don't know if the time is right now. He'd only make one start then have a huge break before his next one and he'd miss the Futures Game, which is a nice reward for him."
phillies,3cecnw,15thStreet,0,Tue Jul 7 20:29:34 2015 UTC,Are we looking at the same box scores?  He's been beat around in LV.  Or are you telling me throwing 90+ pitches in 5 innings against AAAA players is good.  Even his best start where he managed to throw strikes he still gave up 3 runs.  I think people are forgetting that his ceiling in the MLB is a #3 starter.
phillies,3cecnw,hakan_loob44,2,Tue Jul 7 23:22:00 2015 UTC,"He was great against Buffalo, but things fell apart for him in his last inning of work, when he was visibly tired. Even then, 7.2 inning, 3 ER is a good start.   I didn't see his last two games, but he only got ""hit around"" in the one and gave up 3 runs over 11 combined innings.   He's also struck out 25% of the hitters he's seen in AAA and walked only 5%. Those are fantastic numbers. I'm not sure what you're expecting. Not everyone is going to be perfect every time out, regardless of what level they play at. It doesn't mean they aren't good."

phillies,3cb2y2,TheSubversive,11,Mon Jul 6 14:55:53 2015 UTC,"It is important to note, winning in the minors isn't really the point.  The purpose is to train certain players the correct way to ensure that they can move up to become major leaguers."
phillies,3cb2y2,glStation,5,Mon Jul 6 17:16:09 2015 UTC,"But dominating the way Williamsport has is a pretty good indication that there is a lot of talent on the team.

Though you're right that what guys like Pujols, Venn Biter and Kilome are doing is more important than the actual wins."
phillies,3cb2y2,15thStreet,2,Mon Jul 6 17:28:49 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure.  I'm glad they're doing well - it's indicative of some talented players, mostly.

phillies,3cb2y2,glStation,-10,Mon Jul 6 17:36:38 2015 UTC,"Classic.  Say there, what happens when you have a bunch of guys ""trained"" the correct way all playing together?    Winning is the result of having ""trained certain players the correct way"" and those certain players having talent.  Also, the minors is where players hopefully learn a winning culture.  And I hate to break it to you but playing the correct way won't get you to the Majors unless you actually have talent."

Then next year, which purportedly will have a much stronger class, they can spend a lot without competition from a number of the big market teams who will be shut out due to their own penalties kicking in (can't spend more than 300k / player)."

phillies,3c7yl1,madrinks,3,Mon Jul 6 07:53:41 2015 UTC,"Excellent move.  For those that don't understand this very complicated International Bonus Pool situation the Phils essentially acquired the right to spend more money on international signings.  To put it in some perspective, the pool money they acquired from the DBacks was useless to them because they went so much over the previous year; the DBacks had the money but were not allowed to spend it on directly signing players (so they trade it to us).  With us acquiring that money it means we will not go over the allotment and then we won't be penalized the following year, leaving us with money that we can't spend (like the DBacks).  To further make this money even more valuable, The Angels, Blue Jays, Cubs, Diamondbacks, Dodgers, Giants, Rays, Red Sox and Yankees will not be able to sign any players next year because they've gone over the limit in the last 2 years.  EDIT: for clarification, they CANNOT sign any significant players, not ""can sign and get penalized with a tax"" but CAN NOT sign.  So, some swinging dick prospect will hit the market and not only will we be a team with a lot of money allotted to us for signing that prospect but we won't have to compete with some of the usual big spenders in international draft signings AND we stand the chance to not get penalized in the following year for going over in that year.  Excellent move with tons of upside.  EDIT: And BINGO: http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2015/07/outfield-prospect-jorge-ona-leaves-cuba.html"

phillies,3c7gzt,eagsrock20,5,Sun Jul 5 16:52:09 2015 UTC,It wouldn't have been that good. He's a reliever and not a dominant one.   Reminds me of when we traded Victorino for Josh Lindblom. This guy is younger and better but it's still never a great idea to use a lot of resources to acquire relievers. Be it money or a decent starting outfield.
phillies,3c7gzt,15thStreet,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:18:29 2015 UTC,"Everyone likes to criticize Ruben for overvaluing his trade chips, and then people say stuff like ""using a lot of resources"" to describe trading Ben revere. He really doesn't have significant value."
phillies,3c7gzt,sokrazyitmightwork,4,Mon Jul 6 00:10:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think Amaro has been overvaluing his trade chips. That's what opposing execs whine about to the media when they can't get the player they want at the price they want.   And Ben Revere is better than people give him credit for. Only 25 outfielders in the majors have a higher WAR, which (to simplify a little) means he'd be an upgrade over another player in any team's outfield.   He's not going to get a top prospect, but a reliever, which have little trade value themselves, would not be a great return for him."
phillies,3c7gzt,15thStreet,-4,Mon Jul 6 05:09:37 2015 UTC,Give me a goddamn break. It would be a fine return. You have to look at the actual playoff contenders and whether they need Reveres skill set or not and what those teams would be willing to give up vs what they can get from another team. There's too many mediocre teams with good OF.
phillies,3c7gzt,JerryFilter,4,Mon Jul 6 11:22:29 2015 UTC,"Or you can look at Revere's production and determine whether it'd be easier to find another cost-controlled outfielder as effective as him or a middle reliever.   If that's their best and only option, they might as well hang onto Revere. It'd be much easier to find a cheap, effective option to plug into the bullpen than a cheap, effective option to plug into the starting outfield (we should know that after watching the merry-go-round out there this season).  People are just overreacting to Gott because they hear his name since he was called up recently and his been the flavor of the week. Were he in the minors and still a middling relief prospect, they wouldn't be so excited about this news.   And honestly, I'd still rather the Phillies get a middling position prospect or SP prospect than Gott."
phillies,3c7gzt,15thStreet,2,Mon Jul 6 17:11:30 2015 UTC,Middle relievers are a dime a dozen and are frequently inconsistent from year to year. Revere is young. He is still getting better. He is more valuable than a middle relief prospect IMO.
phillies,3c7gzt,chipsvisor,0,Wed Jul 8 12:25:01 2015 UTC,"Right.  It's funny how either ""Revere isn't worth anything"" or ""we should get more for Revere"" is used to suit the commenters needs for complaining at that given time.  Revere for Gott would have been a great deal for the Phillies.  Releiver or not.  You need guys you can depend on to get outs in the late innings and we've seen over the last few years how not having that hurts...Also, see current Kansas City Royals."
phillies,3c7gzt,TheSubversive,5,Mon Jul 6 12:43:54 2015 UTC,"Right. It's funny how either ""Revere isn't worth anything"" or ""we should get more for Revere"" is used to suit the commenters needs for complaining at that given time.   Except I never said the former. And I'm not complaining. Just strongly disagreeing with the notion that getting a middle reliever in exchange for a productive starting outfielder would be a ""killer good deal.""   You need guys you can depend on to get outs in the late innings and we've seen over the last few years how not having that hurts...   We've had a good bullpen the past couple of years. Relief pitching has been far from our problem.  And while it's important, especially in the playoffs, it's not something you go out of your way to acquire. Relievers are too fickle. Unless they're the dominant closer type, you can never be sure what to expect. So handing out big dollars or giving away key pieces to get one is a waste when sometimes you can have just as much success by picking someone off the scrap heap (see Grilli and Johnson for the Braves this year, the Cardinals bullpen pretty much any year they go to the playoffs).  That's part of the reason teams have been so reluctant to give up anything of value for Papelbon, even with the Phillies eating much of his contract. And in that case we're talking about teams being unwilling to give up potentially decent major leaguers for an established closer who has proven to be effective for the last several years.   As opposed to this, where people want to give away a decent starting outfielder for a reliever who's thrown 10 innings in the majors."
phillies,3c7gzt,15thStreet,0,Mon Jul 6 17:26:29 2015 UTC,"I wasn't so much saying you in regards to the complaining but I know you've seen it on here where one guy will go either way depending on the case he's trying to make.  I disagree about our bullpen the last couple of years being good.  It should have been good but it's been wildly inconsistent.  And especially in the last years of our recent run when you could point to them as being the single greatest reason we lost a ton of games.  And it's not the guys for when we are ahead, it's the guys we put in when we are a run down in the 7th and then go to being 3 runs down.  I also think if you can get a shutdown reliever for a Revere then that's a good deal.  I'm not talking a guy who had 1 good year and I'm not talking a ""decent"" reliever.  I'm talking about a true shutdown for 1-2 innings guy who's proven he can do it consistently like Gott has in the minors.  He's got excellent minor league numbers pl;saying in some very tough leagues for pitchers.  Look at it this way, Huston Street and Gott went from SD for 4 prospects, the Angels #1 and #4 and 2 younger but promising guys.  Street was probably worth the #1 and 1 promising guy so Gott's value was a #4 and a promising guy.  If we got a teams #4 and another promising prospect for Revere would you be ecstatic?"

phillies,3c6rbq,bunkermatt,13,Sun Jul 5 14:08:06 2015 UTC,Not a prospect. He's a career minor leaguer.
phillies,3c6rbq,Motherlicka,9,Sun Jul 5 15:08:06 2015 UTC,"WIP caller quality post. Why do fans think the answer to the Phillies woes is always calling up someone from the minors? I guess I can answer my own question with ""yeo. Day ain't dewin grate ri now. Wats wrong wit bringin up dis kid?"" Right now the Phillies have to look at the future. And another Ruf with less power is not the future. But maybe you will get your wish in September or possibly if someone gets injured. Still no real upside unless he transforms into Hank Aaron with a call up. Chances? Not likely."

Could be a decent platoon player or as a bat on the bench.  But it's highly doubtful that he is a major league player.  Hope I'm wrong but I don't think I will be."

I would personally like to see Revere traded, as he holds the most trade value, and Brown back to AAA, where he can work on hitting above .200  I don't think we'll see much else in the way of present-day fixes, except maybe Hamels/Pap moving."

phillies,3c439o,Xo0om,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:05:29 2015 UTC,It's not like he's taking playing time away from someone more deserving.
phillies,3c439o,ObligatoryHandle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:19:14 2015 UTC,Exactly. Brown isn't going to get any better by facing Triple-A pitching any more. And Frenchy isn't going to get any better.

phillies,3c5d14,Leeeoon,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:18:22 2015 UTC,Revere hasn't been in the lineup recently. And there isn't anything wrong because he pinch hit yesterday.
phillies,3c5d14,Jayyburdd,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:28:36 2015 UTC,"it's because Mackanin is giving the younger guys playing time, like Sandberg should have been doing. Ben Revere is gonna get moved, he'll play a little this month just to keep from going rusty."
phillies,3c5d14,TheSublimeLight,1 point,Sun Jul 5 12:41:35 2015 UTC,That makes no sense because A) Francour is a lot older and worse at the plate and B) Revere is heating up with a .343 AVG and a .805 OPS in the last month. Wouldnt they want to keep him out there to show teams that he is over his cold start?
phillies,3c5d14,bunkermatt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:10:59 2015 UTC,"He could get hurt, his numbers could decline, he could hit a cold streak, there could be a freak accident that ends his season or career; these are all valid reasons to the FO to keep him out. I don't know about Francoeur. He's just... there."
phillies,3c5d14,TheSublimeLight,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:16:05 2015 UTC,"Revere tends to heat up as the season goes on, so sitting him to worry about a cold streak is odd. Yeah he could get injured, but you cant sit guys because you are scared they might get injured, if that was the case all non contending teams would bench their best trade options. Now it just looks like Revere isnt even good enough to crack the Phillies lineup, which must do wonders for his trade value."

phillies,3c2kmd,philliesfan136,6,Sat Jul 4 04:15:06 2015 UTC,"Here's how it should work for now and for the foreseeable future: Any acquisition should either (a) be a part of the future team or (b) be a piece that's either worth something in trade value or will be something that may be worth something in trade value.  A guy who just got DFA'd probably won't be worth anything at anytime soon.  I posted the other day about possible picking up Clayton Richard who has been very good at AAA and the nature of his contract states he either has to be put on the Pirates MLB team or they have to deal him.  There was a very good possibility that the Phillies could have picked him up, put him in the rotation, he performed well and gave us some trade value.    Kevin Correa could bring something back.  That's a good pick up.  Harang was looking like he was going to get us a few pieces but not so much the last month.  Billingsley, if he was healthy and pitching good, would have brought back something too.  It's not ""what can he do for us"" as much as it's ""what can we get for him."""
phillies,3c2kmd,TheSubversive,2,Sat Jul 4 18:47:22 2015 UTC,"I see you downvoted yourself. I don't think we need a has-been reliver, to be honest. Especially a rightie, considering how we only have two lefties, Diekman and Araujo."

Here, found an article:  http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/sports/phillies/A-new-wrinkle-in-Phillies-spring-training.html"
phillies,3bw46p,TheSubversive,2,Thu Jul 2 20:24:08 2015 UTC,"Very, very interesting. Hadn't heard about this at all. Thanks for the link."
phillies,3bw46p,silverence,-4,Thu Jul 2 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"Not everyone has to hit for power.. right. But the Phillies really have no one hitting 30+ a year. You can't have 9 Juan Pierre's. You can't have 9 Ben Revere's. Cesar Hernandez is yet another -WAR player on this team. Yes, he has a negative WAR. Just like half the lineup. You can't run that out on the field and expect to compete. This guy is barely a bench player.. come on guys."
phillies,3bw46p,Motherlicka,3,Thu Jul 2 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"Hernandez has a 0.5 bWAR and a 0.8 fWAR. That's not too bad considering his limited playing time. If he kept up his stats over a full season he'd probably be around 3.5 WAR, which is good. You don't need a team of 9 mike trouts."

phillies,3bw46p,Silent_Thought63,4,Fri Jul 3 00:53:43 2015 UTC,He has a +1.2 oWAR (BBR).  That's significant.  He's made some young guy mistakes defensively but those can be fixed.
phillies,3bw46p,TheSubversive,-2,Thu Jul 2 19:18:02 2015 UTC,"But the Phillies really have no one hitting 30+ a year.    Franco seems like he has the potential to do that.   You can't have 9 Juan Pierre's. You can't have 9 Ben Revere's.    But a team DOES need young, productive, cheap talent. It will allow them payroll flexibility to acquire areas of need, like pitching and more bats.   Cesar Hernandez is yet another -WAR player on this team. Yes, he has a negative WAR.   No he does not have a negative WAR.   This guy is barely a bench player.. come on guys.   Jesus christ, man. Stop being irrational. He gets on base and looks like he might be able to hit for average. And it's not like he's a train wreck defensively."
phillies,3bwpz9,silverence,5,Thu Jul 2 19:51:40 2015 UTC,I totally disagree. Mikey Miss is a diehard phillies fan that says all the time that he watches all the games. The fact that he's a sports commentator by profession doesn't mean he wouldn't be watching the games anyway because he loves the phillies and loves baseball as a sport.   He's just being honest with what he sees and is giving his opinion on the state of the franchise. He's meerly protesting by not cheering or clapping at games because he's so invested in the future of the phillies that he wants the ownership and members who call the shots to change and move the club in a postive direction. I don't believe he's being a fairweather fan.
phillies,3bwpz9,proctavius,11,Fri Jul 3 20:46:27 2015 UTC,"""I don’t know where the Phillies are headed.

I myself have been a huge Phillies fan for 27 years, which is soon as I could understand what baseball was.  In almost no other business are paying customers expected to just eat shit and swallow a bad product without mentioning that they are indeed being told to eat a pile of shit.  On top of that, if you choose to show your displeasure with being told to eat shit, others who are gleefully eating shit think they have the right to take away your fandom. No, its bullshit.  The Phillies are a bad product and not taking part in their shit eating contest does not make someone less of a fan.  Mike is right, they don't deserve our cheers."

phillies,3bwpz9,Xo0om,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  He's not wrong about how bad the Phils are, but he thinks we can't figure that out on our own.

Innes and Bruno are insufferable in their own right, but perhaps might be the worst pairing of broadcasters in the history of sports radio.  Innes is a twenty something year old loudmouth who sweats douchechills, while Bruno and his fake radio voice sounds like he just stopped caring all-together.  I will only tune into WIP if Glen Macnow is on, which is now very seldom.    The Fanatic is also intolerable.  That new morning show is so contrived and hits on all the cliches.  Even to the point of having some dumbass airhead girl on who knows nothing about sports.  A decision no doubt made by an out-of-touch programming director.  God do I hate Anthony Gargano, he's just a fucking caricature.  Harry Mayes can't seem to find a broadcasting partner for his uninspired radio show.  And Missanelli is one of the most obnoxious radio personalities I have ever heard.    FM sports radio in general just sucks."

All of Philly sports talk radio is so negative and whiny. I can't believe that I've actually heard positive things coming out after the 76ers draft.

phillies,3bwpz9,LeafySeahorse,3,Fri Jul 3 02:21:02 2015 UTC,That's the hypocrisy of it. That's what pisses me off the most about it.
phillies,3bwpz9,philliesfan136,0,Fri Jul 3 02:57:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, but even in his ""protest"" of the Phillies he is supporting (i.e. Following/watching) them more than most of our fanbase. He may be a lot of things, but calling him a fair weather fan just isn't fair. Whether it be by choice, or more likely, by compulsion (due to his job), he is watching this team day in and day out.  Edit: thinking on it, you could argue that if he wasn't a radio host he'd most likely stop following the Phillies completely. This runs into the issues that it is a. Complete speculation and b. He may also just being saying incendiary things for his reputation/being in listeners and callers for his show."
phillies,3bt4p0,JMUDuuuuuuukes,7,Wed Jul 1 22:51:21 2015 UTC,"DC isn't bad at all, might not even call it enemy territory. Been to two games this year and there were still a large group of Phil's fans or maybe you could just hear us more because the Nats fans who go to the games are the worst. Its more of a be seen/tweet/instagram event for them. I always get seats by the visitors bullpen, not cheap seats, and there are always dudes who spend the whole game talking about everything besides the game and never once look at the field. Also when Bryce hits a popup that barely makes in out of the infield the whole place screams like he just hit a HR to win game 7. Gets kind of annoying when the are screaming and the outfielder hasn't had to move."
phillies,3bt4p0,Cualax23,6,Thu Jul 2 09:40:55 2015 UTC,"You've just penned one of the most accurate, succinct characterizations of a Nats Park experience.  Thank you.  Every time I go there, something always seems off about Nats fans, and you're right, the attitude is more ""I'm going to a game because it's a thing to do in DC"" rather than ""I'm a Nats fan and a baseball fan, let's go watch some baseball."""
phillies,3bt4p0,el_mitso,3,Thu Jul 2 11:50:30 2015 UTC,"The problem is that most of the ""fans"", people alive when the Senators, live outside the city and it's like traveling through satan's butthole getting into a game. The intercity if filled with hipster-dufuses who think it's fun to spend $30 for a ticket and drink $9 beers.  I've been down here for almost 13yrs now, go to almost every Phils game and then maybe 10+ other ones because I generally love live baseball(and my father in law has season tickets). I've had to condition my wife to the point where she now scores the game and knows that if the outfielder's hustling to the ball it has a chance for a gap but if he's casually jogging he's most likely got it."

phillies,3bt4p0,commongiga,2,Thu Jul 2 01:21:43 2015 UTC,That's because Metro was designed to handle commuters. I take it to and from work every day and it's way better than driving in this area. Agree about the sports fans though.

Stadium is nice, although it doesn't have too much character yet.  Food and beer is good.  I normally hit 10 games a year.  The few drunks you meet who catcall generally stop if you just stare at them, and I've never been to a Philly / Nats game where there weren't quite a few friendly philly fans.  I think the nature of the area increases the number of transplants who still root for their original team.    Although I once met a chick wearing a heats edition LeBron jersey at a phils / nats game.  Fuck that chick, its fucking August at a baseball game."

I doubt the drop from #1 (he was ranked here in May of 2015) to #6 is due to weight issues.

The reality that every Phillies fan needs to come to grips with is that he will not be fired. If he wasn't fired for a few years of bad decisions, he certainly won't be fired for his last year or two of pretty good decisions.   The most realistic and probable scenario is that his contract is not renewed after the season, as some other commenters said. Gillick (and MacPhail) will oversee any trades he makes at the deadline and then MacPhail will look to find a guy that fits his philosophies on statistical analysis, since that is definitely not Ruben's strength - a lot of people around here, including myself, think Jerry DiPoto would be a great fit.

Edit - I deleted mine, but I'll copy my thoughts onto here  The rift between him and Scioscia was based on his belief in advanced stats and Scioscia being old school. With MacSucceed coming in and claiming to be bringing Sabemetrics and advanced statistcal analysis into the organization, DiPoto would probably be a great fit as a guy who has the same philosophies and has experience as a fairly successful GM.  Of course this is all assuming MacSucceed decides not to bring Ruben back next year, but I would be pretty surprised if he did, because the direction he seemingly wants to take the team probably doesn't fit with Ruben's ideas."
phillies,3br8fi,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:17:52 2015 UTC,I said this in another post but based solely on what has been said publicly by Amaro in the past and MacSucceed at his intro I don't think it's possible for him to keep Amaro on.  You can't say how important analytics are and keep a GM who has openly been hostile towards them.  If he does keep Amaro on then we have made a huge mistake.
phillies,3br8fi,phillywill,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:52:18 2015 UTC,I'm more concerned about Matt Klentak succeeding him since there's been lots of talk about how Klentak would be a good fit here with MacPhail.  Not great.
phillies,3br8fi,Ship_of_Fools26,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:55:53 2015 UTC,"Dude.  Nail on head.  Right there.  Klentak, whether people realize it or not, was the front runner for the GM job here.  No doubt in my mind.  Him and MacPhail are super tight and I'm sure he's been thinking about hiring him since this Phillies job came up.  The thing is though, no one would have thought 2 days ago that Dipoto would be available.  You would have gotten laughed at if you brought it up.  His leaving changes a lot for us, mainly if RAJ stays on until the end of the summer.  And MacPhail has to see that Dipoto is better than Klentak, just that Dipoto wasn't available."
phillies,3br8fi,munromae,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:27:03 2015 UTC,"I like Dipoto for our job. He basically lost a power struggle to Scioscia, which he probably knew was going to happen but so was fed up that he snapped. And Moreno is the guy who signed all those contracts of aging players. His team plays in LA and has to compete with the Dodgers for attention, so I understand why he's gone that route with running his team. However, it seems like Dipoto was more frustrated by the fact that Scioscia could straight up ignore the stats and scouting reports with no consequences. He's at the very least more forward thinking than Rube, so I'm all for this. However, I think Moreno has to allow Dipoto to interview with other teams though, since he resigned and wasn't fired."
phillies,3br8fi,ObligatoryHandle,2,Wed Jul 1 19:46:24 2015 UTC,"However, I think Moreno has to allow Dipoto to interview with other teams though, since he resigned and wasn't fired   You are correct but if I'm Moreno the only team I let the guy interview with is the Phillies."
phillies,3br8fi,munromae,0,Wed Jul 1 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"When referencing Pujols, you can't ignore the fact that owner Arte Moreno was the driving factor behind that whole situation. Moreno was also the guy behind the shitty Vernon Wells trade and the entire Josh Hamilton debacle. In all honesty, when you look at it, Dipoto has had to deal with a meddling owner who says, ""don't go over the luxury tax threshold"", and then turns around and takes on three of the worst contracts in major league history, only to let Dipoto fill the roster with what can be seen as replacement level shit and waste away another season of having the best damn player in baseball.   Then you have Scioscia who makes RAJ look like a sabermetric genius. Of course him and an analytic based executive like Dipoto would end up duking it out.  While the farm system has been shit, that's what happens when you are a relatively competitive team for such a long time and you have a twat of an owner signing aging players to shitty contracts while giving up your first round pick in doing so.   Overall, I think Dipoto would be a great GM and has definitely shown some promise. An example is obtaining top 50 prospect Andrew Heaney, who is now in their starting rotation and thriving, for one year of Howie Kendrick (this move rubbed Moreno and Scioscia the wrong way). At the same time, it seems that Ruben is on board until the end of this bloody hell of a season and if Dipoto DOES leave Anahiem, there is no way he is still unemployed by the time the Phillies are looking for a new GM because the front office insists we endure another summer of Ruben fingering his own asshole at the trade deadline instead of doing something productive for once."
phillies,3br8fi,munromae,4,Wed Jul 1 16:30:05 2015 UTC,"I'm not really worried about DiPoto getting snatched up before being interviewed by the Phillies. What owner is going to fire their guy right now to hire a guy who just quit on another owner? And then you have DiPoto, assuming he's no dummy, must recognize that the Phillies have just hired a new president and are in the process of restructuring the front office. Would he really take the first job to come along when one that may offer him incredible power and freedom is just over the horizon?"

I think there was a generational gap between sandberg and the players where he couldn't reach them and they wouldn't bend to his philosophy of fundamentals.  that's why I think a recent former player will get a look."
phillies,3bo66k,electricpenguins,10,Tue Jun 30 20:03:06 2015 UTC,Makes sense I'd rather Macphail take his time in picking a successor and will have (hopefully) a new GM so they can all be on the same page.

phillies,3bonqc,alexsummers,3,Wed Jul 1 03:08:49 2015 UTC,"one on, two out and Giles throws a slider to Gomez, strike three swinging. BUT WAIT, Chooch called time because he though Braun was running from first (he wasn't). So Giles becomes rattled as he's liable to do, gives up a single to Gomez and the next guy to tie the game and then walks in the go ahead run on 4 straight balls.  **edit, or something like that, i don't know if it adds up but i'm too pissed to give a shit"
phillies,3bonqc,keeganrh,4,Wed Jul 1 03:10:42 2015 UTC,"Well, Braun actually was running and was dancing around quite a bit before doing so, which is what caused Ruiz to call time.  But still, you don't call time on your pitcher that late. And with two strikes and two outs and Ken Giles throwing 99, who gives a fuck if Braun has a running start?"

phillies,3bonqc,keeganrh,2,Wed Jul 1 03:04:27 2015 UTC,"Seriously, fuck Ruiz. It's mind boggling how many different ways he can make us lose.

phillies,3bn7f6,TheSubversive,7,Tue Jun 30 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/los-angeles-angels-mike-scioscia-front-office-tensions-jerry-dipoto-ken-rosenthal-062915  Article mentions the issues between FO and the manager is because the FO is pushing for statistical information which Scioscia and his coaching staff object.  So if the Phillies are trying lean on statistical analysis, I doubt Scioscia would want to come here."
phillies,3bn7f6,prufrock23,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:21:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know how much of that is true and what's speculation.  That's a good read but it points out that there are inconsistencies with what the FO wants and what the team is doing, mainly the defensive efficiency difference between the Astros and the Angels and how it relates to shifts.  I think it could be a case of guys who never played assuming they can win solely based on research and data and a guy who's been on the field his whole life saying they have enough info and that's not the problem.  Scioscia isn't throwing the data out, he's selecting what's necessary and what's too much and using feel to balance out the equation.  This is kind of a whole different conversation but I think you don't want a manager who relies solely on data but also takes the temperature of the game and whats going on at that minute to make decisions.  You definitely want your FO to be heavily influenced by it but your manager should be able to decide in the moment what's relevant and what's not, what's needed and what's just too much information for a player to absorb.    In this case with the FO feeding the players the info directly, even after they've come out and stuck up for the manager and coaching staff, I think it's a massive mistake.  The FO there has not done a good job in building that team: they've pretty much ignored pitching, expecting Pujols to play like he did at 30 at 35, not building around Trout, and their farm has nothing in it, not even something to trade for midseason help (and it's been that way for years, since Segura was traded for two months of Greinke).  They should be happy they're where they're at, not pissed at Scioscia."
phillies,3bn7f6,RicsFlair,3,Tue Jun 30 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"Scioscia is no doubt a good manager with a proven track record.  But if we're going to do this thing correctly, we need to go all in.  I am hoping for an unconventional thinker rather than a guy who is pretty set on his ways (Scioscia).  And we are really in no rush to find that guy, but no-doubt the sooner the better.  Particularly I'd like to see a manager who considers batted ball statistics as much as opposing pitcher/batter match-up, and is never completely set on his batting order (even/especially in the post season).  For offense, RBI should be nothing more than a benchmark statistic.  I would want/expect our manager to be willing and able to think outside of the box to increase the teams count.      While on the subject of manager, I completely get that Sandberg had came into a tough spot.  But he also had a golden opportunity to try and think outside of the box.  There was really no pressure to perform because wins weren't/aren't expected at this point.  Sandberg shared the same conventional and antiquated baseball ideas that should no longer be welcomed here.  His departure should symbolize a complete change in mentality for on field philosophy, and our next manager needs to usher in a new mentality.  And please don't get me wrong, I have the utmost respect for Ryne Sandberg the player.  But I had more than I could stand of him as a manager after last season.  In 2014, Ryan Howard had no business batting cleanup in over 75% of the games he played in.  That alone to me is just incredibly out-of-touch and mystifying."
phillies,3bn7f6,phillywill,3,Tue Jun 30 17:33:10 2015 UTC,"he also had a golden opportunity to try and think outside of the box   I can't tell you how much I agree with this.  There were times a receiver would come in and you could tell from pitch 1 that he didn't have ""it"" that day but Sandberg, as almost any manager would do, would let the appearance run it's course.  It almost always went exactly as it started.  I would have so much appreciated a guy who pulls the releiver after going 3-1 then waking the first batter he faced.  You come into the game and walk the first guy you see and you're not going to see a second guy and fuck your ""confidence"" you're in the majors where we expect results not coddling."
phillies,3bn7f6,sokrazyitmightwork,6,Tue Jun 30 19:23:38 2015 UTC,"This seems unlikely, but then we could really get the ""Mike Trout to Philly in free agency"" hype train going"
phillies,3bn7f6,jjohn268,3,Tue Jun 30 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"he won't be a free agent until he's 29, especially after he signed a 6 year/ $144.5 million contract lasting until 2020.    it's not especially because of the contract, it's 100% entirely only because of the contract... If he didn't sign that extension, he would have been a free agent a few years sooner. He traded 3 years of potentially making 30+ mil for 3 years of making significantly more than he would if he went through arbitration."

phillies,3bn3hk,Ballr11,0,Tue Jun 30 15:30:39 2015 UTC,"You'd have better luck asking the Brewers sub. Usually teams take batting practice in the same order before every game, with the starters always hitting last.  For us, Rollins, Utley and Howard would always take the final round of BP. Brewers probably do something similar and one of their season ticket holders would probably be able to at least narrow it down to a few possible players for you."
phillies,3bn3hk,15thStreet,-7,Wed Jul 1 01:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not positive but I think it might've been Jose Reyes. But the more I think about it, probably not him bc he plays for a different team."
phillies,3bj9wz,cg002h,30,Mon Jun 29 18:04:28 2015 UTC,"The title of this post is misleading. The article is titled ""Sweating Off the Hangover,"" and is the most positive article about the Phillies from a mainstream media source that I've seen in years.   The past three and a half seasons have been one PR disaster after another, because GM Ruben Amaro has the rhetorical instincts of a 16-year-old boy who just read Camus for the first time, but the Phillies have quietly managed a good couple of years, organizationally   Not hard to find reasons for optimism when you take the time to actually analyze recent years and not buy into the ""Ruben is satan this team is going nowhere"" narrative. The last paragraph in particular is perfect:   Amaro’s also been judicious with his trade chips: He’s held on to Jonathan Papelbon and Hamels rather than trade either just to give the appearance of doing something, and both have performed. Meanwhile, when good deals emerged for Rollins and Marlon Byrd this offseason, Amaro pounced, acquiring three potential big league starters for two decent players in their mid-thirties.  Other hints of competence abound: This time around, the interim manager, Pete Mackanin, isn’t next in line to take over — he’s a caretaker, a lifelong assistant coach keeping the house in order for the time being. And Andy MacPhail is set to be announced as the new team president today, empowered not only to find Mackanin’s successor but to decide Amaro’s fate. MacPhail doesn’t have the visionary reputation of a Theo Epstein or a Billy Beane, but he’s done this before. He’s a professional and presumably knows what he’s doing, which is the kind of muted praise that’s cause for joy when you’ve seen the alternative up close.  It’s easy to look at the state of the Phillies now and crack jokes, but rock bottom has come and gone; all you need to understand that is a little optimism and a little patience. Fortunately, Philadelphians are renowned as being both patient and optimistic, so I can’t see how this could possibly go wrong."

I just thought that stat was the most interesting part of the article.  That the phils are truly historically bad right now.  I'm sure the 100 loss Astros of a few years ago, and lots of mets and marlins and tigers teams in years past were better at being bad than the best team in baseball was good at being good, but I've never seen that stat before and found it interesting."

phillies,3bjg5e,DrumstickVT,10,Mon Jun 29 18:48:22 2015 UTC,Orioles fan here. MacPhail was pivotal in the resurgence of our organization. He is responsible for a large chunk of our roster. Here is a list of current players that he drafted or acquired for us.  Adam Jones   Chris Tillman  Manny Machado  Chris Davis  Tommy Hunter  Zach Britton  JJ Hardy  Nolan Reimold  Matt Wieters  Caleb Joseph  He also drafted Eduardo Rodriguez who we ended up trading for Andrew Miller last year.
phillies,3bjg5e,OsCrowsAndNattyBohs1,5,Mon Jun 29 20:53:19 2015 UTC,"My boy is a huge O's fan, and I occasionally join him at a game or two. I've been so excited about this move. I just want him in there now, after seeing the turn around that the O's have made over the last few years. Good luck making it to the post, this year. Please kick the Yankee's asses."
phillies,3bjg5e,sirpogo,-2,Mon Jun 29 22:41:31 2015 UTC,"So fans usually look at their own players with rose colored glasses. Here's my unbiased opinion.    Adam Jones = VG player.  MacPhail got lucky he found a sucker for Bedard.  I guess everyone needs to hope MacPhail can find another sucker for Hamels.  Good luck.  It's not 2008.  Philosophy's on young controllable assets have changed a whole lot in 7 years.  Chris Tillman = slightly above avg if you believe his 2 very good  years weren't an aberration.  Manny Machado = GM's don't draft players.  This isn't football  Chris Davis = The white Ryan Howard only worse.  Tommy Hunter = eh?  Zach Britton = drafted in 2006.  MacPhail was still in Chicago.  Even if he was there the same applies for Manny.  JJ Hardy = Good player, good trade.  Nolan Reimold = Drafted in the 2nd rd. in 2005.  MacPhail's Cubs in selected Dion Veal in that round.  Matt Wieters = See Machado  Caleb Joseph = See Machado.  And really?  A career .217 hitter.  OPS+ of 80.  Revere's is higher.  Please don't take this the wrong way.  I'm not impressed by the MacPhail's tenure there nor the Orioles as a whole.  Take away 2 lucky trades and what did he do?  You can argue his best move was hiring Buck.  The team itself did nothing until last year when the rest of the AL East went in the tank."

There is absolutely no other way to interpret this.  It's as clear as can be.  Amaro has gone out of his way to eschew this approach and he's been pretty vocal about how ""scouting is more important"" and now his new boss comes in and in his introductory press conference directly contradicts everything Amaro has spouted for the past 3 years....Oh man, it's on."

Sounds like most of the Phillies fans on here.  EDIT: The other thing I remember about his time there and I think it still holds true to now is that the ownership there didn't/doesn't want to spend anything.  They picked up Nelson Cruz on that 1 year prove it deal for nothing then he went out and proved the shit out of it and they let him walk because they didn't want to pay him.  Here, John Middleton is apparently ready, willing and able to spend whatever it takes to win....the ""Steinbrenner South"" kind of thing."

I'm not exactly downtrodden because of the product on the field, although that doesn't help, but I am worn out from Ruben and front office incompetence. For sustainable success, the front office needs to be completely remade. I think he'll get to work on that immediately at the end of the season, but until he starts the process, I will be skeptical."

I think we'll see a change, but it has to be more than just him; it has to be a systemic change in the front office where it is finally modernized. RAJ and Co scoffing at modern sabermetric measures is just plain ignorant. It may not be the end all be all, but they fact that they are deliberately preventing themselves from using every available resource within the rules is extremely telling and must end.

They'll want MacPhail to focus solely on fixing the baseball organization, from low A to the Majors and Middleton will focus on business.  It's no secret that Middleton is disgusted by the losing and the general operation of the organization and that's one of the reasons Montgomery is no longer here and will most likely be forced to sell his shares to Middleton at some point, giving Middleton a majority share in the team which is something that has never happened with this current group.  Everything has been done by committee.  Having a majority share may not seem like a big deal but there's always been a lot of talk as to this being the reason the organization never seems ""pressed"" into doing things, like firing inept GM's and keeping all promotions ""in house"", which this organization has a long history of.  The ownership group cared more about keeping everything nice and civil over firing people and winning.  Middleton is not like that, he wants to win and I don't think he cares about the money either.  If all of this happens and Middleton is indeed going to be put in charge of the ownership group you are about to see a MASSIVE change in philosophy.  Think Yankees or Red Sox."

I'm sure McPhail is going to have his hands all over the Hamels deal but RAJ, with guidance, is probably in a better position than hiring a new GM today. (Again, with guidance).   I'm not sure I even care about a house cleaning mid-year because I don't want someone to come into this mess and have to live with it for 3 months. Just wait until the day after the season, fire whatever interm coach they have, announce RAJ's contract will not be renewed. Give the new folks as much of a clean slate as possible.  All that being said, can't say I wouldn't be thrilled with any type of firings."
phillies,3bic67,damthesehigheels,3,Mon Jun 29 15:37:07 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but I get the sense that other GMs have no interest in dealing with Amaro unless absolutely necessary. I wouldn't doubt that they've all gotten a taste of his arrogance and stupidity, and I'd bet that, when his name pops up on their caller ID these days, the other GMs wave their assistants into the room, put Amaro on speaker phone, hit mute and laugh hysterically when he proposes various absurd Ryan Howard deals.  So maybe MacPhail should handle all of the important phone calls from here on out. Let Amaro handle the in-office stuff, like ordering lunch."
phillies,3bic67,jcxco,0,Mon Jun 29 15:48:59 2015 UTC,"I think you are right, to an extent.  I think MacPhail will add legitimacy to a RAJ phone call if he even makes them once Andy's in.  I'm willing to bet that they'll announce MacPhail and ALL TRADE TALK will be funneled through him.  Raj will catch him up on any talks that have taken place and MacPhail will take over from there."

Like the way Amaro took over for Gillick as GM. There was a philosophical disagreement there that led to an exodus, but it was mostly business as usual for the Phillies front office. I see something similar happening with MacPhail. He fires a few people so he can install some real number crunchers, but otherwise business as usual. It's the way the Phillies front office prefers to operate. I don't really see a reason to be optimistic that Middleton changes that. He's not new to the organization."

Big guys like this often have control issues to go along with their great stuff.  Their bigger frame and longer arms make it easier to vary the mechanics.  Kind of like the Aumont thing, he had amazing stuff but couldn't control it.  However if they can establish the mechanics and repeat the delivery the sky's the limit, see: Randy Johnson.  One if the main things this system is lacking is a true #1 pitching prospect and if you have to buy one they get very expensive so it would be nice to have something that can maybe be that."

phillies,3bf7qi,dirty_drawlz21,3,Mon Jun 29 07:16:11 2015 UTC,"It's really difficult for an aging pitcher to come back from the lingering injuries and related surgeries he ended up having.  Halladay knew his body was fighting the stress and he gave in at the end of a contract.  On the other hand, I don't blame Howard for continuing to play on a limited no-trade contract and literally being the worst value in the MLB for 2014 and his only competition for this year continuing to be Robinson Cano's terrible 10 year, $240m contract.  Everyone knows Howard is being bought out in 2017 for $10m and won't be finding a team afterwards.  At least we only have one more year."
phillies,3bf7qi,keepinithamsta,3,Mon Jun 29 13:10:44 2015 UTC,"Seriously. A 1-0 loss in Game 5. That was soul crushing, because Halladay was fucking phenomenal, and the team just couldn't hit the ball. 102 wins, all for a first round exit."

I see no logical argument for him to stay. The obvious plan now is a full rebuild, and these charts are some of the many examples that can be used to show why Ruben is the last GM you would want to lead a rebuild.   We're on pace to reach embarrassing new lows this season, and we're a franchise that is sadly somewhat known for reaching sad milestones. I'm not sure anymore what it would take for him to be gone as our GM, barring him stepping down, which based on his comments this season I highly doubt is even a distant thought in his mind. I'm hoping the ownership ""shake up"" that happened in the offseason was more than just fluff and Gillick and Amaro are both removed. If they're not, we have a more bleak looking future than anyone could have predicted."

All someone needs to tell me to indicate that they don't know shit about baseball is to start bitching about Ryan Howard. He was earning practically league minimum during the peak years of his production and we owed him for that. Since then, he has suffered the type of injuries that a player of his size and age might expect. He has responded by training and losing weight and making every attempt to adjust his swing and approach at the plate. During the past two seasons, is first healthy ones in a while, his product has been on point for a slugging hitter of his age.   People need to stop talking about Ryan Howard. He isn't the problem."
phillies,3bf7qi,ebbycalvinlaloosh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:12:15 2015 UTC,"I still have no problem with Ryan Howard accepting his contract; what, is he going to say no? To say the Phillies owed him for that is completely outrageous though. The Phillies didn't owe him anything; they were under no obligation to offer that contract. Moreover, they offered him that contract a year and a half before they had to - forfeiting all leverage they had. There was no way to predict the injuries that occurred, but using any sort of statistical analysis would have showed that he would eventually decline at some point. Sure, you wouldn't know when, but you know he would, and they gave away every advantage they had regarding his contract status when they agreed to that deal. Now, the organization is paying the price for it. I love Ryan Howard, but that deal is, and will always be, a horrible move by the organization."

What I said is kind of bearing out especially that last AB which was a strikeout. Almost every fastball thrown was in on his hands and then tried to get him to swing over a changeup which is the pitch Franco has the most trouble with. He did a nice job the AB before knocking the ball on his hands up the middle for the single RBI but over time you want to see him hit that ball in the gap to right field or over the 3rd basemens head for a double. Im not at all saying Franco is a flash in the pan just saying if he can work on hitting those pitches now that pitchers have a real scouting report on him the sky is the limit for Franco. On the other hand, I think his fielding is overrated, hes made some awesome diving plays but his range is meh. I think his future is at 1st base or left field and Im not turning down a trade if a future prospect plays 3b just b/c Franco plays there. Anyway this may seem like Im being harsh on Franco Im not. This kid has an amazing bright future but we Phillies fans have been way overhyping our prospects and I dont want Franco to be a victim of that b/c of a good start."

Ruben was correct about one thing - most Phillies fans are idiots.  Hey, /r/phillies - you are mostly idiots.  I'm tired of pretending otherwise.  Years ago, when I posted that Ruben was a worse GM than Wade, I got crucified by you idiots.  In fairness, I got crucified on /r/Astros for stating the same opinion.  Suddenly, everyone agrees with me.    I posted in 2012 that we needed to trade Lee, Chooch, Utley, Howard, etc. and got hammered.  I proposed a Michael Corleone style one day blood bath.  I got hammered.  I wanted to let the Dodgers keep Lee when they put in a waiver claim.  I didn't care if we got nothing in return except the compensatory pics.  I got hammered.  I got hammered so badly that I wound up shadow banned (well, my strong opinions about steroids, the fucking DH, and that idiot Andy Reid didn't help) and needed to get a new account.  So what?  I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO AND YOU DIDN'T LISTEN.  Charlie was a dope.  We won in spite of him.  Sandberg was dumber than Charlie.    P.S.  Amaro got an unreasonably good return for the washed up piece of shit that used to be Jimmy Rollins.  He may have found his niche.  At this point, I like the idea of letting him shop what's left of this dying corpse.  Ha.  How do you like that?  P.S.  I've had this account too long.  I'll take my downvotes, delete my account, and start again.  I'm use to it.  I've been on Reddit since before it had ""subreddits.""  I've been banned from better sites and worse sites.

Holding onto to highly sought after assets too long and watching offers get pulled and value go down is not going to expedite this rebuild. Building through the draft is absolutely necessary, but so is avoiding bad contracts, getting prospects in return for players who won't be serviceable when the team is competitive again and getting as many assets as possible. It's nice to see loyalty to guys like Utley and Howard, but when it gets in the way of the future, it's loyal to a fault."

This is a guy that had a lot of success at the minor league level, but was not prepared to take on a poor roster devoid of young talent and ripe with veterans past their primes.  Over the last few weeks it became increasingly apparent that Sandberg had lost the locker room. His resigning now at least saves the team more embarassment and allows Sandberg to leave with a little dignity.

phillies,3b885q,RicsFlair,-5,Fri Jun 26 19:52:03 2015 UTC,You're kidding me right?? This is the worst chase has been since he came into the majors. He's on the dl thank goodness but he's been horrendous batting .179 that's terrible. He is getting old. We appreciate everything that he's done for us but time has come for you to not plAy and just relax.
phillies,3b885q,sajacobs24,5,Fri Jun 26 19:54:41 2015 UTC,"He was an all star last season.  He hasn't been good this year and you may be correct that his career is coming to an end, but we're about a third of the way through the season and it's possible he's just in a bad slump."
phillies,3b885q,Scummerly,0,Fri Jun 26 20:04:19 2015 UTC,Bad slump?? What constitutes as a bad slump? I feel like that term is used very loosely. This must be a very very long bad slump

But at least it would be something interesting for the fans to watch.  I know that he's having a poor year, and I don't expect anything good to come out of him playing wise.  But I share those exact expectations for the entire team.  It's a lost season, and was marked as one from the start.  I know that he's batting .179, but who honestly cares.  Who even cares if he accumulates enough PA for his option to vest.  The organization is not pinching pennies in the next few years to make a splash on the free agent market.  And there isn't youth waiting to play second base on the horizon.  We should just appreciate the last few year(s) Utley has, and regain focus on getting competitive by 2017/18."

phillies,3b885q,BygmesterFinnegan,-5,Sat Jun 27 00:42:12 2015 UTC,"This pisses me off.  This guy was a Hall of Fame player who had a tremendous career playing then went into coaching/managing.  Took jobs that were so far beneath him it's ridiculous and rode around eastern seaboard on a fucking bus with a bunch of kids, biding his time and doing a hell of a job while he was there.  Won Manager of the Year for the Minor League and finally gets back to the big leagues.  Comes in as a bench coach and waits his turn and then when it comes he's handed the biggest pile of shit in the League.  But he's still cool.  He quietly does his job doing the best that he can.  Manages to have a better Pythagorean record than his team (last I checked by 1 game but still).  Gets attitude from a relief pitcher for telling him to walk a guy in a perfect legitimate situation; takes scorn from an aging veteran who's not helping the situation at all with his play, and on top of that has to put up with the bullshit from a bunch of fucking asshoie fans who for some fucked up reason blame him, like he put this team together.    Whatever.  You get what you give and us as fans, as a group, don't deserve a whole lot.  Let's just complain about everything...all the time."
phillies,3b885q,TheSubversive,5,Fri Jun 26 20:12:00 2015 UTC,He actually didn't do the best that he could. He made silly managerial decisions. Silly silly ones that a manager should know not to make.

I think that site is inbred trash who complain incessantly and most of the time let the hatred ruin the conversation, which infuriates me.  No manager makes the right move 100% of the time.  No manager or person is perfect.  And no one here knows the whole story.  I think he had to make some decisions that probably were unconventional based on what he was dealing with.  He probably should have made more ""bad"" decisions and they probably would have won more games.  Regardless, I'm quite sure that for whatever reason the players weren't listening to him and weren't taking his instruction.  He knows how the game should be played and he knows how to play the game.  So you have a guy telling guys how to improve, them ignoring him, and then they do what they want to do and they suck.  Gee, great situation, where do I sign up.  Nothing like being ignored when you know something the other person doesn't and then continuing to watch as they go down the drain....and continue to do it their way....and continue to suck.  The losing got to him and I'm sure the frustration mounted and he figured ""What the fuck.  I don't need this; I'm a fucking Hall Of Famer.""  And he's right."

We suck so bad that whenever we win two games in a row we here get REALLY excited. Are we actually that excited? Probably not but its more fun to latch onto something good then just keep wallowing.   I think Ryno's resignation is indeed a good thing for a few reasons. One, he wasn't a very good manager. Players never seemed to like him. He didn't have a backbone, managed the bullpen like shit, and so on. Also, his resignation is a glaring sign that this team's management is just shit terrible and I think it makes us one step closer to getting rid of RAJ."
phillies,3b88we,Kanthiz_,2,Sat Jun 27 15:14:36 2015 UTC,"The rumor is that Ryno completely lost the locker room after Chase went after McClure when Frenchy was left in too long.  Apparently Chase wasn't disciplined at all by the coaches after that.  Ryno is an old school guy and probably would have been a good manager 15 years ago but the game and players have changed, maybe his managing style doesn't work in today's game.  But we all know it's not just Ryno but the entire organization as a whole.  It's sad, it's frustrating, but you know what makes it worse?  Is our own fans who are taking pleasure in our failures.

phillies,3b8s5e,SuggestAPhotoProject,11,Fri Jun 26 22:05:25 2015 UTC,"No, this isn't a matter of being a quitter it was about losing a locker room and a team. He knew he was no longer effective and he stepped down, I can't be angry at the man."

He was no longer effective as a manager, he lost the players long ago, and the writing was on the wall that his firing was imminent. I understand the ""he's a quitter"" sentiment but all things considered, there was no reason for him to stick around.   Let's flip it for a moment: if Chase Utley called a press conference to announce he's retiring immediately, we'd all respect him for not being greedy and doing the unselfish thing by walking away. He would open up a spot for Cesar Hernandez to get regular playing time, which is needed for his development and to gauge his ability as an everyday 2B. Chase would be giving up the remaining $7-8M for this year plus the chance at hitting 500AB and vesting his $15M option for 2016.   Damn, Chase is a really good dude for putting the team first. Amirite?"
phillies,3b8s5e,BygmesterFinnegan,3,Sat Jun 27 03:10:58 2015 UTC,Nah. He no longer had control all of the team and therefore had no further purpose serving his position.

So I was like, ""This Ben Francisco is a stud"", and I thought I had found the next minor league sleeper. When he came over with Lee, I was probably more excited about Francisco, and I told all of my friends that this guy would surprise us, and be an everyday guy.

I think he'll be in the conversation at the end (where it matters) but for now we should just wait and hope he continues to play great ball."
phillies,3b3q2m,humblewatertribe,3,Thu Jun 25 19:01:16 2015 UTC,"He can CRUSH outside pitches, but once pitchers start jamming him inside is the real test for him"
phillies,3b3q2m,TheFriffin,7,Fri Jun 26 12:59:41 2015 UTC,Joc and Bryant were both up at the major league level before him. Both of those prospects were also hyped a bit more in rankings prior to this year.
phillies,3b3q2m,RunnitBack,6,Thu Jun 25 19:19:15 2015 UTC,"He is certainly getting consideration. He's being highly regarded, even in /r/baseball which is notable anti-Philadelphia.  It's just that Pederson is having the better season. His AVG is bad, but his OBP is higher than Franco's. If Franco can keep up his torrid pace he may catch him but right now it's Joc's to lose."
phillies,3b3q2m,envriogis,3,Thu Jun 25 19:08:52 2015 UTC,I disagree. Franco is also slugging significantly higher as of the last time I checked. I think if they had equal AB Franco would win it
phillies,3b3q2m,Coys11,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:43:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah but he doesn't and thats the point. It's not Franco's fault he started the year in AAA but that's the reality. Right now, Joc is the ROTY"

phillies,3b3q2m,Coys11,0,Fri Jun 26 02:54:41 2015 UTC,Exactly. If Franco is going to pass Bryant in HRs and keep up the BA he will get more talk. Bryant seems overrated. Still a good kid though
phillies,3b3q2m,Charmanderp7,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:02:40 2015 UTC,What? Lol
phillies,3b3q2m,ACPhila,2,Tue Jun 30 10:31:43 2015 UTC,"Right now I think it is largely games played.  That could change if Franco keeps it going the next couple months.  But.  He's really not that close either.  Pederson is much further ahead and Bryant still is too.  (Numbers are according to Fangraphs).  If you were to look at WAR, Pederson is at 3.4, twice Franco's 1.6.  Franco does have a higher BA (and SLG) but that could taper down with more games.  Pederson and Bryant, despite the lower BA have OBP nearly 40 points higher.  And then there's the Pederson's great defense in a premium position.  Right now he has just offered more value.  There are definitely factors going for Franco though.  The ones you mentioned and then his wOBA and wRC+ are both higher than Pederson and Bryant.  So if Franco keeps this pace up, he will definitely be in consideration by August.  he's just not there yet."
phillies,3b3q2m,smiller121,2,Thu Jun 25 19:19:09 2015 UTC,I would say Franco offers similar defense at another premium position. But we need to see more from these guys.
phillies,3b3q2m,ihorsey,2,Thu Jun 25 21:34:26 2015 UTC,"You can say that but it's not true. Advance metrics (incredibly small sample size, especially for defense) have Franco as a negative defender so far.  And CF is either the most important or second most important defensive position (with SS).   I love Franco. I've been high on him for two seasons. Just trying to temper expectations."
phillies,3b3q2m,smiller121,2,Thu Jun 25 23:47:57 2015 UTC,Franco's obviously not a negative WAR player. Franco's touted for his defense. I'm not saying Franco's better. But you can't say ones a good defender and ones not. Just like you can't say 3b isn't a premium position.
phillies,3b3q2m,ihorsey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"Franco is a good defender.  He's put a lot of work in the past two years to get there.  He has never been touted for defenese though.  Most scouting reports questioned whether he could stay at third.  And that's why there was speculation he was a future first baseman.  Right now Pederson is a better defender.  That's fine, nothing wrong with that.  But I was just saying Pederson's case isn't just his bat, he plays a great CF and helped transform LA's defense in the OF.  And I never said Franco was a negative WAR player.  1.6 WAR in 40 games is great.  But it's still half of Pederson right now.  In two months that could be completely different.  It's just too early to throw Franco into the Rookie of the Year conversation."
phillies,3b3q2m,smiller121,2,Fri Jun 26 01:53:52 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what you're basing that off of. Or how many years old it is. But  Franco hasn't been considered at any position besides third base. He played some first before in case Howard was traded. But he has one of the best arms in the league. The only thing you can knock him for is range. He's certainly above avg there.
phillies,3b3q2m,ihorsey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:40:14 2015 UTC,"Last year the Phillies started Franco at 1B in the minors and had him play 1B in the Dominican winter league before last seasons Spring Training.  So that's definitely not old.  And here's one article on that to back it up: http://m.mlb.com/news/article/66886742/phillies-maikel-franco-ranked-among-top-10-third-base-prospects.  (January 2014)  He took huge steps forward last year at 3B though.  Here's a scouting report from 2013 that questions what postion he will end up at: http://crashburnalley.com/2013/06/26/the-future-is-unwritten-maikel-franco-scouting-report/  (Nov 2013)  And here's a scouting report from last December (scroll down to 2nd prospect) that says Franco will ultimately end up at 1B: http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/evaluating-the-prospects-philadelphia-phillies/  (Dec 2014)  It's fine if you don't think Franco is going to move off of 3B.  I don't think he will, I think he's good enough to stay there.  But I'm not going to act like it hasn't been a concern (I know Keith Law still doesn't think he will stay at third).  I follow prospects pretty closely (it's my favorite thing in every sport), and this concern always popped up in a Franco scouting report.  Edit--I also don't know why we're arguing about this so much.  I'm a big Franco fan.  I think he can be a very similar player to what Aramis Ramirez or Adrian Beltre has been."
phillies,3b3q2m,smiller121,2,Fri Jun 26 02:54:32 2015 UTC,We're not really far apart. I guess you were just saying Pederson and Franco were both great offensively. But pederson is a good defender and Franco's not. Franco's really come on strong with his defense to the point where it could be a carrying tool.
phillies,3b3q2m,ihorsey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:21:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'd agree with that.  Franco was third baseman of the year in 2014 for the International League and he has made huge improvements with his fielding.  Just hasn't shown it too much this year.  He has the great arm, but the 8 errors are a bit surprising.  Feels like he still has to get comfortable playing third in the majors, which I think he will.  Like you said though, my point was that Pederson has been great defensively this year, Franco has not."

His pace has slowed a bit since then, so if Franco can play well for the remainder of the season, he'll be in the discussion."

phillies,3b3q2m,ACPhila,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:13:36 2015 UTC,Just wanted to comment on this thread again. I like Franco a lot but the more I watch him play the less I think he can be a superstar. He swings at EVERYTHING and I think he's a first basemen. He's playing really well right now but I don't think he's a 900 OPS player and a guy the team can build around. I do however think he'll be a good first basemen and an above average player and hit 280/320/480+. I'm a lot higher on Crawford than Franco. But let's be honest Ruben doesn't draft players or scout them using saber metrics so I have a hard time buying any prospect that doesn't fit certain indicators. I hope I'm wrong about Franco and he becomes more patient but I don't think I will be.  For example http://imgur.com/V6r92Hb he pretty much murders fastballs is pretty good against sliders and then is below average vs curveballs and awful vs change ups.  Compare that with Kris Bryant   http://imgur.com/jTBPmDN  He's good vs every single pitch. Maikel Franco is playing great but don't get lost in emotions he's not as good as Kris Bryant and never will be.  EDIT: http://imgur.com/aGn0LyG that's where pitchers are pitching him and this is his slugging % http://imgur.com/sHG49vc over time pitchers aren't going to throw in his hot zones.   All of that said at least Franco is an above average player and can help this team
phillies,3b4wyu,JoFlo520,5,Fri Jun 26 00:17:47 2015 UTC,"He's not part of the future and he's basically filler, which is what he's been his whole career.  He's had his chances before though and never made anything of it.  Isn't he like 31?  And in AAA?  That should tell you something."
phillies,3b4wyu,TheSubversive,2,Fri Jun 26 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's played parts of four seasons in the bigs. In his fullest season (400 ABs) he hit .203"

phillies,3b2zyf,alentz3,13,Thu Jun 25 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"I think it's because he went ice cold.  This is a very young guy who never played above AA before this season and it'll probably do him some good to sit a bit more and absorb.  I think he needs to make some serious adjustments at the plate, both with his swing and with his approach.  He's jumpy, swings early, doesn't work the count at all, appears to have no idea what his pitch is and what he can drive and his swing itself is a bit long and loopy.  He does have excellent potential though and can do some things that can't be taught, mainly speed.  For a guy who just ""appeared"" (I love that rule 5 draft) he's worth putting some time and work into."
phillies,3b2zyf,TheSubversive,5,Thu Jun 25 16:12:59 2015 UTC,"Yea I love his potential. He's got speed and he's got surprising pop. But since he was a rule 5 pick, we can't put him in the minors. Throwing him in and letting him practice bad habits won't make him better, so the right move is to work with him in the cages and BP and play when he has favorable mathups here and there."
phillies,3b2zyf,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"he's got surprising pop   not really. his ISO (.112) is 19th-lowest among the 73 outfielders with 200 ABs or more despite being higher than it was at any point in the minors, and his percentage of soft-hit balls (20.8%) is the 14th-worst on the same list (and his hard-hit% doesn't fare much better). even if you only include CFs to wash out the powerful corner guys, he's on the wrong side of both lists.   I know the way batted ball exit velocity and distance are kept track of is kind of messy and incomplete, but he's at the tail end of those leaderboards too.  as far as I can tell, the only way he gives the impression of having worthwhile pop is if you dwell too long on the Ben Revere comps he's received and then see the two HRs in his stat sheet.  I'm not knocking the guy, but let's be realistic about the player he projects to be."
phillies,3b2zyf,have_a_good_one,0,Thu Jun 25 22:05:54 2015 UTC,"doeent let the count work   He is the highest Phillie this year in average pitches per AB,  averaging 3.99 do you research please"
phillies,3b2zyf,Charmanderp7,4,Thu Jun 25 20:32:55 2015 UTC,"And by the way, it only takes 3 pitches to strike out and he has the 2nd highest K% on the team and it takes 4 pitches to walk and he has the lowest walk% too."
phillies,3b2zyf,TheSubversive,-2,Fri Jun 26 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"Dude, working the count is different from seeing pitches.  He has the 2nd highest first pitch swinging percentage among qualifiers, has the 2nd lowest 3-0 count percentage, swings at the 4th highest percentage of pitches, and the worst ball put in play percentage.  It really sucks that I need to explain to you what working a count is but it's not seeing a ton of pitches because you swing at everything and foul it off and it goes into everything else that I said.  Now if you're going to sit here and say that he looks great at the plate, that it appears he goes up there with a plan and knows what pitch is his, then don't even bother."
phillies,3b2zyf,TheSubversive,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:01:07 2015 UTC,He definitely needs to improve on having patient at bats. Struck out on three pitches yesterday to end the game.
phillies,3b2zyf,DingusDeluxe,2,Thu Jun 25 16:33:10 2015 UTC,He'll be in the minors next year. If not sooner if we can work a trade to keep him.
phillies,3b2zyf,ihorsey,2,Thu Jun 25 17:49:18 2015 UTC,"they have too many left-handed outfielders.  putting asche in left field made no sense because he has less value there than at third which is a premium position.    at best if asche hits .250-.270 and maybe 10-15 homers, with minus defense and he doesn't steal bases, his high outlook isn't even good enough to start in left-field imo,  asche needs to play at third to be in the majors and needs to be traded."
phillies,3b2zyf,feralmonkeyboy,0,Thu Jun 25 21:36:45 2015 UTC,"It isn't because he went ice cold, it's because they're trying to market Revere as much as possible so he can be traded"

You never give the other party ANYTHING to bring up and diminish your position.  Hamels is a proven ace...with a 4.73 ERA against the AL.  Gee, does your infinite wisdom think that doesn't change his trade value to an AL team?  Shutting down an AL team yesterday would've meant something even if it was minute (like I said in the post)."

phillies,3b3c1h,ihorsey,5,Thu Jun 25 17:46:51 2015 UTC,"I would've put Ruf at 1st, Franco at 3rd, Revere in left and Herrera in center and Francouer in right.

Some of his Baltimore Moves:  Drafted Matt Wieters  Drafted Manny Machado  Signed Koji Uehara  Traded Uehara for Chris Davis and Tommy Hunter  Traded nothing for JJ Hardy who went on to win a few Gold Gloves and then signed him to a cheap team friendly extension; Hardy has put up 15 WAR in 4 years in Baltimore while only making $7M/year (that's more than Utley has put up in the same time frame at half the cost).

phillies,3ayld4,sokrazyitmightwork,12,Wed Jun 24 15:25:15 2015 UTC,"The fact is that anything less than Judge+ from the Yankees or Gallo+ from the Rangers is not worth it. Cole Hamels is a bonafide ace, proven post-season performer and pitching as well as he has at any point in his career. Couple that with the fact that he's on a near to below market deal for the next three years and he become even more attractive.  In a world where Jeff Samardzija gets you Addison Russell, Cole Hamels should get you a teams BEST Offensive prospect along with a few lottery tickets.  If you read the chatter in other subreddits (and I'd advise you don't) you would think Hamels is an over the hill, overpaid and mediocre SP and all their prospects are a Trout/Bryant/Strasburg hybrid and future HOFer.  This is not homer-speak. These are facts. Cole Hamels is worth a team's top prospect and so long as he stays healthy. I GUARANTEE it will happen because fortunately the subreddit fanbases aren't the ones making decisions.  Who knows Gallo could be the next Paul Goldshmidt or Mark Reynolds. Judge could be the next Corey Hart or Giancarlo Stanton. There is inherent risk on both sides of any deal of this magnitude.  The Phillies cannot screw this up and I have confidence that they won't."

phillies,3ayld4,ThePaddingtonBear,2,Wed Jun 24 20:02:02 2015 UTC,"I agree and it's very clear that we will most likely end up with something very special when we unload Hamels.  Regarding Gallo, yeah, Mark Reynolds is a great comparison and that's why I wouldn't trade for only him.  His K rate is off the fucking charts.  Judge though, well he seems like a really complete player."
phillies,3ayld4,TheSubversive,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:23:37 2015 UTC,"Cole Hamels is worth a team's top prospect and so long as he stays healthy.   That depends on the prospect and how much money the Phillies include in the deal. He's simply not going to fetch a guy like Correa or Buxton. I don't think Gallo is on the table unless they pony up some serious cash. The Red Sox aren't going to part with any of Bogaerts, Betts, Swihart, or Moncada. I don't think the Dodgers would part with Pederson, Seager, or Urias."

In case you haven't noticed Utley IS rich as shit.    I notice there's generally two kinds of people, sort of like glass half empty/glass half full.  They are the ""can't walk away from that kind of money"" versus the ""I already have a boatload of money, screw this"".   The can't walk away people seem to not even be able to conceive waking away.  IMO only reason to hang out is if if he still enjoys playing, which he doesn't seem to be doing.  But if he wants to add some more cash to the stash,  I can understand that also."

I honestly think it would be irresponsible to just walk away not only from the money he's owed the rest of this year, but the $15 mil he can get next year if his option vests. Especially when all he has to do to get that money is play baseball."
phillies,3awzvz,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:19:21 2015 UTC,"OK you lost me at irresponsible.  If I have 50 million dollars in the bank I'd walk away from a bad situation in a heartbeat.  If he wants that money for his foundations then OK,  but don't give me has a family.  They don't need to earn another penny ever.    Maybe Chase is a money money money guy, as you appear to be.  Nothing wrong with that.  I still hold to my claim - that money guys don't understand the I've got enough crowd.  I've turned down more money for a better situation,  but then I had enough.

I'm sure Chase and his family would have no problem living off what he has now, but who in their right mind can ever say that playing baseball can make them so miserable that it's not worth north of $15 million?"
phillies,3awzvz,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:42:34 2015 UTC,"I'll repeat my claim - the more money guys don't understand that the I have enough people actually exist.    It's rare but players retire before the end of their contracts often enough.  Usually due to injuries but not always.  Sure they could sit on the bench for a year or two, and some do.  Yes these people are in their right mind, you just don't understand them."
phillies,3awzvz,Xo0om,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"How can you look at someone who makes $15 million a year and say that they are an ""I have enough"" person? Chase Utley has no more than 2 or 3 years left in his life to make money, I would be totally and utterly surprised if he walked away from money that was guaranteed him.   You are seriously naive if you think that professional athletes who aren't fighting off debilitating injuries are ""I have enough"" people."
phillies,3awzvz,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:20:10 2015 UTC,"yes, i'm aware he isnt hurting for money. thanks for that brilliant insight. i just personally dont think he is going to walk away from the money.  If he walked away tommorow I couldnt blame him. He is probably more frustrated with his own performance than we as fans are. Its still a shitload of money, and even if he goes on the dl  there is still a decent shot he gets his vesting option. I just cant picture Sandberg/RAJ keeping him out of the lineup if he wants to and is able to play."
phillies,3awzvz,nickebee,5,Wed Jun 24 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"At this point, who even cares if Utley vests or not.  Money we have, replacements we don't (not sold on Hernandez playing every day).  If there was somebody waiting for his spot, and if the team was looking young and hungry, then I would be against allowing Utley to obtain the PA's necessary to vest.  But at this point, we're not planning on becoming competitive for a few years.  So who really cares.  And after all, this is what majority of Phillies fans wanted.  For Utley to play his career out here.  This is it, this is the end of his career.  Let's just ride it out and smile to see one of the teams all time greats play the game."

phillies,3avvh2,keeganrh,15,Wed Jun 24 01:44:29 2015 UTC,hurts me to say this but this team is better offensively right now with Ruiz and Utley on the bench.  Too many double plays from ruiz and he doesn't hit enough anymore to justify it and utley is just not flat out hitting
phillies,3avvh2,feralmonkeyboy,7,Wed Jun 24 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"The writing's on the wall. The youngins are showing signs of life, a direct result of consistent playing time. Love ya's Chooch and Uts but the production speaks for itself. Howard and Frenchy too. Release Frenchy and bring up Ruf to platoon 1st."
phillies,3avvh2,keeganrh,3,Wed Jun 24 01:46:57 2015 UTC,"We need Frenchy to play OF, he's better than Brown and has a better bat than Ruf thus far. He's also a more natural outfielder than Ruf.   Agree otherwise."
phillies,3avvh2,ToTheBlack,2,Wed Jun 24 01:55:05 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call Darin Ruf a younger player in the same light as Franco. Dude's 28. He's not even that good. I don't know whose ABs Frenchy is wasting for you.
phillies,3avvh2,Jayyburdd,3,Wed Jun 24 02:40:10 2015 UTC,"That's dumb. You'd rather be down a .250 at bat than up one? What's wrong with you? Like I said, it's not like there are ML-tier outfielders to fill the spot, so why not have him stay up there until we do have some?   I personally believe Frenchy is a better player than Ruf. He's hit us some clutch singles, saved runs with his strong-as-all-fuck arm, and is a big clubhouse guy. You can take a chance with Ruf, but I say there's no wins to be saved with either player."
phillies,3avvh2,Jayyburdd,2,Wed Jun 24 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"I don't see what else this conversation is about. If you're talking about future>wins, then Ruf isn't your guy. Ruf isn't our future, dude's too old. I'm talking about stallers, guys up there to give the young players time to develop. Ruf is just as much one of these guys as Frenchy. Bringing him up would be no different.  EDIT: Ruf has a smaller sample size than Frenchy. Frenchy's been playing longer than him. A guy with a .300 average in 5 games isn't necessarily better than a guy with a .250 average in 10 games, for an example."

phillies,3avvh2,RunnitBack,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:28:40 2015 UTC,"1 run lead. Guy on second. 1 out. Who do we bring out?  We could get Luis Garcia out there. Luis has been in situations like this, he could get through it with an impressive strikeout or two.  We could get Jeanmar Gomez out there. Gomez hasn't had nearly enough playing time, and he has some good numbers thus far.  We could even get Diekman out there. He's a lefty too, and has been surprisingly effective since coming back from AAA.  No, no, wait, our brilliant coaches have a better idea! Let's bring out Araujo, a rookie pitcher who skipped AAA and hasn't done much of any good in clutch.  Fuck everything."
phillies,3avvh2,Jayyburdd,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:13:43 2015 UTC,Diekman though pitched 2 innings last night I believe.  He is probably not available tonight.

He just projects as a middle of the order guy with 25+ HRs.  He's a top talent and that's not even taking into account that he is hitting better in AA than expected."
phillies,3auh2e,smiller121,2,Tue Jun 23 19:26:41 2015 UTC,thanks!
phillies,3auh2e,BygmesterFinnegan,4,Tue Jun 23 20:23:37 2015 UTC,Partially because one of the Out of the Park Baseball Phillies rebuilds I've done I picked up Mazara and he ends up being incredible. It might even have been in a trade for Hamels!   He's just a good looking outfield prospect.
phillies,3auh2e,Mulsanne,2,Tue Jun 23 19:21:40 2015 UTC,Ill kill myself if we trade Gallo to yall for Cole. We (tex) need bullpen help so im not to sure where i see the allure in cole coming to Tex.  Also yall dont have enemy flair so ill be this Smiling Black Guy for now.
phillies,3auh2e,KidColorblind,2,Tue Jun 23 22:26:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think you guys would trade Gallo anyway.    One problem I do have with what you said though (and I don't mean to attack you, I am interested in your perspective as a Rangers fan), and it's something I've seen before, is the idea that Cole Hamels wouldn't help.  That Texas needs bullpen help and Hamels wouldn't help.  The thing is, Cole would help with that.  He's a frontline, workhorse who goes deep into games.  That mean less innings for the bullpen to pitch.  And it would also let you move one of your current starting pitches into the bullpen, which would likely give it a big boost.  You wouldn't be fixing your bullpen directly, but you would be helping it."
phillies,3auh2e,smiller121,2,Wed Jun 24 00:56:09 2015 UTC,Yeah I understand that but when I say bullpen help I mean cheaper guys. You know.  Not hating on Cole I just don't want to spend the money.
phillies,3auh2e,KidColorblind,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:14:54 2015 UTC,"I can understand that.  I don't necessarily agree though, Hamels isn't to expensive for a top starter (much cheaper than any FA this winter).  And Hamels is a proven major league player.  Who knows if prospects will even pan out.  It's a tough position to be in though.  I'm sure if I was a Rangers fan, I would be arguing the opposite."
phillies,3auh2e,smiller121,2,Wed Jun 24 01:20:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  here's my reasoning. We pick up Cole and darvish hits FA and we don't have the money to pay him.  My faith in darvish is stronger than any starting pitcher."
phillies,3auh2e,KidColorblind,3,Wed Jun 24 01:30:10 2015 UTC,"Apparently the Phils want a catcher, Jorge Alfaro, who was the #64 prospect in baseball this year and has okay numbers in the minors, and a RF, Nomar Mazzaro, who looks great with a .839 OPS in 2 years a AA.  Nomar is baseball's #87 prospect.  I'd probably take this deal and be happy with it.  I could be a lot happier but I could be a lot less happy too.  Two solid pieces at positions we need."
phillies,3auh2e,TheSubversive,5,Tue Jun 23 18:25:57 2015 UTC,"And that's only according to one prospect ranking.  If you were to use Keith Law's, Mazara is #31 and Alfaro is #35.  And then Kiley McDaniels on Fangraphs has Mazara #46 and Alfaro #53.  So yeah definitely wouldn't be a bad deal with these two involved."
phillies,3auh2e,smiller121,3,Tue Jun 23 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"Alfaro must be a very good defensive catcher too.  Yeah, this is a good return.  2 more pieces that put us closer to competition again."
phillies,3auh2e,TheSubversive,3,Tue Jun 23 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"What I've read on Alfaro is that he has a plus arm (grade 70/80 depending on who you read) but he needs to work on his receiving and framing.  He has the tools and athleticism to be good at it and his arm is a weapon behind the plate.  He would be an exciting prospect, especially with his plus power (I've seen 60-80 on raw power).  The problem at this point is how bad is his ankle injury?  If he needs surgery (likely) he's done for the season.  Does that scare the Phillies away?  I'm not sure it should, but they would need probably two more prospects from the Rangers in their systems 6-15 range."
phillies,3auh2e,smiller121,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:41:58 2015 UTC,Not enough.
phillies,3auh2e,deadnside,9,Tue Jun 23 19:16:54 2015 UTC,Trade him soon. I get waiting to get teams desperate and upping offers but I just don't want to risk him getting hurt and nobody willing to make a trade.   Just trade him now so we can get something in return. He already missed a start with a small injury. Don't risk it anymore.
phillies,3auh2e,drain222000,3,Tue Jun 23 16:40:31 2015 UTC,Get the feeling that Jorge Alfaro is one of the prospects that Amaro is looking at.  It's been long rumored that he wants a top catching prospect (Swihart and Hedges) so Alfaro would be right in line with that.    I wonder if Texas would part with Alfaro and Nomar Mazara.  That would be a great start to a trade.  Then just throw in a middle of the pack pitching prospect (Ortiz/Jackson) and another arm or bat.    Wouldn't mind seeing Lewis Brinson as one of the players either.  High upside player.
phillies,3auh2e,smiller121,2,Tue Jun 23 17:26:50 2015 UTC,Supposedly there are talks with the Yankees too.
phillies,3auh2e,KetoThrowaway222,5,Tue Jun 23 17:04:58 2015 UTC,I hope the Yankees are just being used to drive up the price.  Outside of Aaron Judge (who the Yankees might not even part with) I don't really like many of their prospects.  The Rangers have a lot more high end prospects who could be enticing.
phillies,3auh2e,smiller121,2,Tue Jun 23 17:28:44 2015 UTC,Agreed. I hope there are a few more teams in there to help drive it up too but I'll take however many teams we can get at this point.

phillies,3auh2e,xychosis,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:16:09 2015 UTC,If Joey Gallo isn't involved I have zero interest. They have a WEAK farm system.
phillies,3auh2e,hockeyfan328,11,Tue Jun 23 16:47:26 2015 UTC,"They don't have a weak farm system. It's actually very good with Gallo, Jorge Alfaro, Nomar Mazara and Chi-Chi Gonzalez, among others. There are definitely pieces there that could create a nice return for Hamels, even without Gallo (though getting Gallo would be nice)."
phillies,3auh2e,corn_starch_party,2,Tue Jun 23 17:26:46 2015 UTC,"You're right it's not weak per se, but outside of Gallo it lacks high end talent. I would like Philly to net a player that can make a significant difference in exchange for one of the best pitchers in the league."
phillies,3auh2e,hockeyfan328,7,Tue Jun 23 17:37:00 2015 UTC,"Nomar Mazara is definitely a high end talent.  Would not be a bad player to get.  And if Alfaro is able to stay behind the plate, which is likely considering his great arm and athleticism, then his plus power would be very valuable.    They might not have the hype of Joey Gallo, but they definitely have plus attributes.  And that's not even getting into some of the high upside players in the Rangers system.  I mean it would be much better to deal with the Rangers farm system then the Yankees."
phillies,3auh2e,smiller121,-2,Tue Jun 23 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"I'me not talking about hype, I'm talking about unproven potential. Gallo has proven that he has what it takes to produce at a high level in the majors. The rest of them have not. This team is in the gutter for a LONG time if we trade Hamels and get prospects that bust in return."
phillies,3auh2e,hockeyfan328,7,Tue Jun 23 18:03:08 2015 UTC,"But how has Gallo proven that he can produce at a high level in the majors.  I still think Gallo is a lot of raw power that's unproven.  And no matter how great that power is (and it is at least top 5 in the MLB already) that  40% k rate is scary.  And then the slash line of .210/.291/.453 is not producing at a high level.  Gallo is a great prospect, but he is a lot of unproven potential that has not shown whether he can produce at a high level yet."
phillies,3auh2e,smiller121,2,Tue Jun 23 18:06:40 2015 UTC,"He's taken 72 PA and produced slightly over league average. He's proven nothing yet.   Please, research your opinions."
phillies,3auh2e,Mulsanne,0,Tue Jun 23 18:45:09 2015 UTC,"Well through his first 11 games he hit about .340 with 4 homers. I'm no expert but that doesn't look too shabby. Just because he's played poorly the last few games doesn't mean he hasn't proven anything.   Please, do your research."
phillies,3auh2e,hockeyfan328,4,Tue Jun 23 19:05:19 2015 UTC,"You are definitely no expert. Nobody is or would dispute his quality of play.   74 PA is not representative. He hasn't proven anything because it's not possible to do so in such a small sample size. It's not that he hasn't played well, it's that small samples are very fluky. Jeff Franceur started his career like Mike Trout, and for more than 74 PA. Did he demonstrate anything? No, because that's not how it works. Come talk to us after at least 300 very productive PA.   I like how you doubled down on your wrongness, though. Especially when I already addressed your point in my last comment."

phillies,3auh2e,hockeyfan328,3,Tue Jun 23 19:33:24 2015 UTC,"Nomar Mazara is high end talent, Alfaro could be considered such because of the position he plays."

phillies,3auh2e,15thStreet,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:00:56 2015 UTC,"If you didn't notice I corrected myself earlier. I think they are around that 10 spot. In my opinion, top end talent trumps depth because of the success rate of prospects. Texas seems to have a farm that has a lot more depth."
phillies,3auh2e,hockeyfan328,3,Tue Jun 23 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"Given a low rate of success for prospects, wouldn't depth then trump top end talent?   I'd rather have 5 long shot lottery tickets that could each pay 1 mil than 1 long shot lottery ticket that could pay 10."

phillies,3awgbb,haunthorror,2,Wed Jun 24 03:48:51 2015 UTC,And it only raised his era on the year in the MLB to just over 2.2  I would take him in a trade.  Do want another really good prospect or 2 as well though.
phillies,3awgbb,RunnitBack,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:23:14 2015 UTC,"I'm just a little frightened by that very sample size of a season his 2.2 ERA represents.  Edit: Why would you downvote me for simply pointing out that he's only pitched 35 innings this year? I didn't write him off based on that, just expressed I'd be cautious."
phillies,3awgbb,TheSubversive,3,Wed Jun 24 04:25:47 2015 UTC,"Fuck the sample size, look at this guys K numbers, they're horrible throughout his minor league career and into the majors.  Seriously this guy isn't worth Harang let alone Hamels."
phillies,3awgbb,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:57:14 2015 UTC,"he's a groundball pitcher. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want him to be the centerpiece of a Hamels trade, but strikeouts just aren't his game. If we got Alfaro, Mazara, and Gonzalez tho? That's a nice package."
phillies,3awgbb,haunthorror,0,Wed Jun 24 12:30:44 2015 UTC,"And prospects are never a sure thing, but it certainly is not a bad thing that his era is that low so far."
phillies,3awgbb,ihorsey,2,Wed Jun 24 04:47:09 2015 UTC,"He's supposedly untouchable. But hearing this is intriguing. That would be a great get for us, and would explain the rumors and the phillies interest. But I guess they could also be watching Gallo?"
phillies,3awgbb,15thStreet,3,Wed Jun 24 01:47:16 2015 UTC,"He wouldn't be a great get, really. As a prospect his expectations weren't that high and while he's gotten good results at the ML level, his peripherals have been bad. He's found success in the same way Kendricks and Happ did in their rookie years. And on a smaller sample size, the same way DeSclafini and Shane Greene did earlier this year before imploding.   I'm glad he got shelled tonight, on the off chance the Phillies were allowing his few ML starts to have a strong impact on their opinion of him."
phillies,3awgbb,ihorsey,2,Wed Jun 24 02:33:52 2015 UTC,"He's probably not an ace, but he's no Kendrick that's for sure. He's probably a tick behind Nola's potential. #3 starter."
phillies,3awgbb,15thStreet,3,Wed Jun 24 02:38:17 2015 UTC,"He could easily be Kyle Kendrick if his strikeout numbers keep trending the way they have since he made the step up to Triple-A. And his command has never been as good as Nola's.   They've probably both been described as having the potential of #3 starters before, but it's an oversimplification. Nola is clearly a better prospect."
phillies,3awgbb,ihorsey,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:45:22 2015 UTC,3 starter is basically 1 tier lower than an ace. Kendrick has never been discussed in that group.

phillies,3awgbb,ihorsey,2,Wed Jun 24 04:49:07 2015 UTC,"The phillies don't have a 3 starter right now.  This guys floor is Kendrick, but Kendrick never had this guys celing."

phillies,3awgbb,TheSubversive,5,Wed Jun 24 01:51:42 2015 UTC,"I understand Gallo's value but Hamels is no slouch himself.  You're talking about one of the absolute best pitchers in the game on a fairly team friendly deal that could be made even more team friendly with whatever gets absorbed by us.  Look at his contract compared to what Scherzer just signed and realize that Cole has had better numbers throughout his career and has been a World Series MVP to boot.  Gallo has struck out 29 times in 63 major league AB's and he struck out 179 times last year in the minors.  He walked a lot in the minors and that inflated his OPS but this ain't the minors and often that skill doesn't translate as well to the Majors whereas you almost never see strike out rate go down at this level.  You're obviously a Rangers fan and you're in love with your prospects and that's fine.  But just remember that it's pitching that wins Championships and Cole's among the best of the best, he's not a prospect who maybe will do something."
phillies,3awgbb,haunthorror,3,Wed Jun 24 02:19:34 2015 UTC,You cant expect to get a stud if you refuse to deal good prospects.  Would you rather have a sure thing that could win you a title or prospects?
phillies,3awgbb,TheSubversive,4,Wed Jun 24 02:27:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly.  Teams thought they would take advantage of us last year and I hand it to Ruben (even though I was furious at the time), he told them to fuck off.  They'll know better this year and our future will be better because of it.  I'm torn.  Part of me says he should tell teams to fuck off again if they don't come correct but we really need the prospects....but if they're not great prospects than we really haven't done anything but get rid of a great pitcher for not great prospects.  Who cares about the money, as far as I know the fans aren't getting any of it and it's the one resource the Phillies do have.  I'm glad Gillick will be involved this year."
phillies,3awgbb,ihorsey,2,Wed Jun 24 02:43:57 2015 UTC,"Hamels is obviously much better than Gallo ever will be, but to trade away Gallo would be taking away from their ML club. Which is the opposite of what they're trying to do. At least that's how I see it."

But hey, I'm not the one calling the shots. I'd be thrilled to get a pitcher as talented as Hamels--but not for a king's ransom.   Also, I haven't really gotten the chance to watch Hamels outside of his postseason performances, but I was wondering what the deal is with his rather pedestrian numbers against AL teams."

He's never had a great K/BB ratio and that's a bad indicator but he's kept his ERA down in the minors and for his brief sample size in the majors.  He doesn't appear to give up a lot of hits and is great with keeping the ball in the park.  In conclusion, he looks like a scary prospect, one that could dive bomb on you.  I don't trust any of the stats I see at all.  He could be part of a trade but I wouldn't take him as the centerpiece of a Cole Hamels deal."

phillies,3awgbb,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:01:10 2015 UTC,It's tough to scout the stat line though.  Maybe he had a lower K/BB because the Rangers told him he's not allowed to use his slider.  And that happens a lot so that young pitchers learn/develop a third/fourth pitch and also learn how to get out of situations using other pitchers.  I'm not sure if this is the case for Gonzalez but it's definitely possible and it should make us hesitate from scouting the stat line.

phillies,3auv6z,feralmonkeyboy,6,Tue Jun 23 18:18:18 2015 UTC,"RA Dickey, who was 38 at the time, and 2 throw-ins were traded by the Mets for D'Arnaud (17th highest prospect at the time), John Buck, Syndergaard and another prospect.  So, teams do trade catching prospects."
phillies,3auv6z,deadnside,2,Tue Jun 23 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"lol that's a good example because we actually had D'Arnaud too and traded him.  Man what a steal for the Mets with Syndergaard there.    It could happen but I just don't think the odds are in favor and even if a team trades a top catching prospect what are the odds he develops any value?  I just don't think there are many special catchers period.  There's posey, yadier, wieters...lucroy and mccann...maybe some other good defensive guys.  Catchers are good if they can call a game, frame, keep runners honest, and at least be somewhat of a threat offensively.  I think Rupp can do that, small sample size i know and maybe its because im comparing him to Ruiz who has deteriorated but I like Rupps arm and his ability to adjust with learning to hit and call games.  I'd rather have them go best value than overvalue a catching prospect for our trades."
phillies,3auv6z,JerryFilter,3,Tue Jun 23 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"Vogt, Martin, Perez, Ramos, Norris, and more. I think you're undervaluing catchers. Vogt alon is worth 3 games over a replacement level player. I really don't care who the catcher is now or not year considering they're not competitive anyways. But they will more than likely have a new catcher in a few years."
phillies,3auv6z,MikeOfTheBeast,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:19:49 2015 UTC,yeah maybe i'm undervaluing them since its hard to get a sense of a catchers value without seeing them because their offensive numbers don't really tell the story.  I still think there are more teams looking for a catcher than happy with what they have.    To me its a premium position especially when they deteriorate quickly because its such a demanding position.  I just don't think the risk and reward is worth trading Hamels for unless the catcher is like the 2nd or third best prospect you get out of the trade.  Tommy Joseph was the biggest prospect of that trade and he is plagued by concussion issues.  The position is too much of a wild-card.  It really doesn't matter what i think though because its obvious they are going to get a catcher in a trade but i just hope its not the center piece of the deal especially when you can pick up a guy like Nieves for nothing and we have Rupp and Lino and Knapp might be major league quality eventually.    I want a ton of young arms to compete with the Mets and Nats the next 5 years.

You don't need to have superstar prospects at every position in your system to be competitive but you do need the pieces that are tough to get even with money, like SS and CF.  We're not the Astros or the Pirates, we have money.  We have more than enough money to put some home-grown pieces in place and buy the rest.   Ruben has emptied the cupboard   Of what?  Are there a bunch of superstar players out there who were in our system and got traded away?   Hamels will most likely get you a piece   Not ""most likely,"" most definitely.  If you get a chance you should compare his stats to Max Scherzer who just signed a 40 year, $350B deal.   Pap I don't think so much. Lots of money to be eaten   So, we can eat the money.  No fucking problem eating the money, ALL OF IT.  So now you get one of the best proven closers in the game for free for the next 2 years.  Whattya got?

phillies,3asepa,ihorsey,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:00:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't here about that, Altherr deserved to be moved up by now.    Dugan should move up soon once he gets enough at-bats cause he's always hit at every level but he just needs to be healthy enough to play long stretches so they can advance him.  seems like he always gets hurt and has to be reset at the same level which slows him down."

phillies,3awyz4,TheSubversive,7,Wed Jun 24 04:18:35 2015 UTC,Those games were still pretty horrendous though
phillies,3awyz4,joelinator,3,Wed Jun 24 04:49:33 2015 UTC,Baseball isn't about 3 games in the middle of June..but look at the standings the team is still bad
phillies,3awyz4,Trainwrek,3,Wed Jun 24 05:15:18 2015 UTC,"Normally I'd agree, but we're really bad. Look at our run differential. We just don't score."
phillies,3awyz4,MajorSuccess,7,Wed Jun 24 06:50:57 2015 UTC,Sorry but only moron around here is you.    The Phils are last or near last in most hitting categories over the whole season.  You're doing the same thing you accuse others of doing - taking 3 good hitting games and using it as proof the Phils can hit.
phillies,3awyz4,Xo0om,2,Wed Jun 24 11:54:00 2015 UTC,"We have the second least amount of runs scored in all of baseball, 2nd worst OPS, and worst OPS+ over 73 games.  Why are people morons for saying that arguably the worst offense in all of MLB is bad?  It took 31 runs in 3 games to have the second least amount of runs scored, with a whopping lead of two runs over the White Sox, who have played 4 less games than we have.  We are scoring 3.32 runs per game, while the league average is 4.15.  We are dead last in runs per game, with the second worst team scoring .1 more runs per game.  That is also right after a ridiculous 3 games.  We also have the 5th worst BA, 2nd worst OBP, and 2nd worst SLG.  Did 3 good games suddenly erase 70 terrible ones?"
phillies,3awyz4,RenderedInGooseFat,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:36:01 2015 UTC,I find it hard to believe that there are 4 teams with a worse BA.
phillies,3au7pn,TheSubversive,10,Tue Jun 23 15:27:34 2015 UTC,"Papelbon is solid. anyone that thinks otherwise doesn't understand how baseball works. His value will be at the highest come deadline, RAJ is waiting until then to trade him. He could have easily been dealt during the winter to the Brewers or any other team. Once the deadline hits the calls will be piling in for Papelbon. People in this city don't have patience, something we all have to live with unfortunately"
phillies,3au7pn,WiliamsCarterMichael,2,Tue Jun 23 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"I think Papelbon will get a solid return, but Miller isn't a great comparison.   He was owed less money (sure, we'll probably cover some or most of that) and was also extremely dominant. He wasn't a ""closer"" but he easily could have been a closer on any team in the league.   Also, Eduardo Rodriguez wasn't considered a top prospect in baseball until after he went to the Red Sox."
phillies,3au7pn,15thStreet,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:48:03 2015 UTC,"BA had him 65th overall at the end of the '13 season, and 3rd on the O's going into '14 behind Gausman and Bundy.  MLB.com had him 85th overall a the end of '13.  He was a pretty good prospect.  If we got a similar caliber player, he would probably immediately be the second best prospect we have."
phillies,3au7pn,RenderedInGooseFat,-2,Tue Jun 23 19:21:25 2015 UTC,"Rodriguez was the Orioles #3 prospect when that season started and it was widely accepted that he moved up during that season.  You're not getting a top prospect in all of baseball for anyone, those trades don't happen.  An organizational top prospect, yeah.  Hamels may get a 50-25 in all of baseball prospect.   And I think Miller is a close comparison, especially considering what was traded last year.  I used the 3 closest players I could find."
phillies,3au7pn,carpathiz,4,Tue Jun 23 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, but you're wasting your breath. Anyone who thinks Papelbon holds no value is more than likely drooling all over their keyboard while they try to convince you his velocity will ruin him."
phillies,3au7pn,mildlypeeved,3,Tue Jun 23 15:40:51 2015 UTC,"Why would I save my RAJ bashing?  Because he got such a great return for studs like Cliff Lee, Hunter Pence, and Victorino?  Oh, right he traded all of those guys away for scraps.  I definitely think Paps has value, I just don't think that we'll get anything of value back as long as Rube is pulling the trigger."
phillies,3au7pn,nickebee,2,Tue Jun 23 16:25:06 2015 UTC,"idk how there are a few people on this sub that vehemently defend the guy. most people know he isnt 100% responsible for all of this, but they keep pointing to the rollins and byrd trades like we got f'ing Jacob Degrom and Noah Syndergaard."
phillies,3au7pn,WiliamsCarterMichael,-3,Tue Jun 23 22:13:39 2015 UTC,Victorino is a stud? LOL
phillies,3au7pn,ihorsey,2,Tue Jun 23 16:34:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Vic was a beast."
phillies,3au7pn,mildlypeeved,7,Tue Jun 23 16:58:44 2015 UTC,"Rube moved him in 2012.  He had won 3 gold gloves the previous 4 years, and he was top 20 in MVP voting in '09 and '11.  So... yeah, I'd say he was a stud when we moved him."
phillies,3au7pn,sokrazyitmightwork,5,Tue Jun 23 16:40:36 2015 UTC,He signed for ~$40 mil after that season and has had one semi-productive year for Boston. It was better to trade him and try to get something in return rather than let him walk for nothing or be the ones to pony up that money.
phillies,3au7pn,mildlypeeved,3,Tue Jun 23 19:38:48 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that they should have traded him and that they traded him at the right time.  My point is that the return sucked.  Josh Lindblom who just played ate up garbage innings for the rest of that season and Ethan Martin, who's currently a 26 year old AA player.  If he signed a $40 mill contract after that season, there was still some perceived value in him."
phillies,3au7pn,sokrazyitmightwork,2,Tue Jun 23 19:47:01 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, we then traded Lindblom for Michael Young, who we then traded for Rob Rasmussen. So, Victorino has netted us Rob Rasmussen and Ethan Martin.   I don't know anything about Rasmussen, but Martin still has some talent and has the potential to be a bullpen piece at some point.   Anyway, my thinking is that you can point to a lot of moves that Ruben could have done better with, but you can also point to a lot of trades that he clearly won. He's done a lot of things wrong, but I think in general he's come out ahead in trades, and he's handled the trading of the few assets we have left the last 2 years pretty well to this point.   Edit - just checked up on Martin and Rasmusses - Martin has appeared in two games in Reading and Rasmussen was sent to Toronto with Kratz when we got Brad Lincoln."
phillies,3au7pn,sjphilsphan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:59:25 2015 UTC,Martin has been hurt all year
phillies,3au7pn,ShittyBrain,-8,Tue Jun 23 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"What you don't know is astounding.  Cliff Lee - been traded several times and no team has ever gotten anything of value back.  You forget (like a complete moron) the package of shit he traded to get Lee in the first place, you ignorant little bitch.  Hunter Pence - At the time that seemed like a really solid return.  Sometimes, believe it or not, prospects don't work out.  I know you think every top rated prospect is a sure thing but that's just because you're stupid.  And again, we traded a package of shit to get him too.  Victorino - What's he done since we traded him?  He was at the end of whatever it was he had when we let him go and that's pretty much proven by what he's done since.  And again, when that trade was made it was for very good prospects.  And just to prove you know nothing, do you know how we acquired Victorino ""the stud""?"

phillies,3au7pn,deadnside,4,Wed Jun 24 00:32:27 2015 UTC,I don't kill Amaro for every single move he makes but both Pence trades were bad at the time and are even worse in hindsight.
phillies,3au7pn,nickebee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"I can't complain about the first Pence trade. He became the best hitter on our team for the second half of that season. None of the guys we traded for him are worth the chance to win 102 games and a World Series, it's just a shame that we couldn't get it done in the playoffs.   The decision to trade him in 2012 was a little puzzling because we didn't even really commit to rebuilding at all after that until last offseason. But even then, that package only looks bad because Tommy Joseph got derailed by concussions, which is really just bad luck."
phillies,3arezv,PhilsBot,21,Mon Jun 22 22:14:00 2015 UTC,The most exciting thing about Franco is that he's only 22 years old. I'm used to seeing all of our prospects get here when they're 25.

No one is giving up anything for a 36 year old rental, who could cost $15M next year at 37 years old, with a .182/.258/.280 line.  Among qualifying hitters, that ranks last, 6th from last, and last in all of baseball.  His OPS is second to last.  His OPS+ is last.  It is very tough to argue that he isn't the worst, or the second worst hitter in terms of consistent starters in all of baseball.  No one is trading for him.  If he fails to reach 500 PAs, he and Sandberg will both likely be gone at the end of the year."

phillies,3agfez,ACPhila,2,Sat Jun 20 05:58:49 2015 UTC,"I feel like the team has been beaten up over their antiquated player approaches so much that now they are just trying out of spite to prove that they can win without using it. And it's just so dumb. So now they're looking for these oldhead baseball minds from the 80s because the team thinks they can do it.   Look at the teams brimming with young talent - Pirates, Astros, Cubs, etc. They have very modern front offices. Unless the team starts using advanced analytics, scouting, platoon splits and just a general modern approach to building a roster, they'll be at a serious disadvantage to every other team."

I know the success of the team wasn't great... but I think he is partly responsible for them becoming a power house in the AL east.   His nephew does saber metrics for the SA spurs.

phillies,3agfez,sokrazyitmightwork,0,Tue Jun 23 17:03:53 2015 UTC,"He's definitely not wrong. The Phillies are not going to make radical change. For me, the reason I can have optimism, is that I believe the Phillies biggest mistake was just that they didn't start rebuilding sooner. The only other really crippling mistake was the Howard contract. At this point, I am choosing to believe that they are capable or rebuilding now that they have acknowledged that they need to. I don't think it will take a radical change.   Ruben's moves the last two years have been solid, and while it will be nice to get a change at GM, I don't think the team is doomed if he stays. A lot of people here obviously don't feel that way, but I don't think people have given him enough credit for the last 3 drafts, a few solid free agents, and some good trades the last few years. I think MacPhail has the experience in building teams to oversee this process, whether it's with Ruben or a guy of his choosing. I personally would just like to see a little more levelheaded discussion and maybe some more optimism around here, rather than everyone bashing Ruben every time he breathes."
phillies,3agfez,Xo0om,-2,Sat Jun 20 02:35:05 2015 UTC,"What an asshole.    Don't disagree with him that the Phils won't make much of a change any time soon, but the guy is  nowhere near as clever as he thinks he is."

phillies,3agfez,scootypuffjr33,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:49:56 2015 UTC,Except very few players are currently sitting at 3+ WAR. We would need to be replacing the worst players on our teams with the best players in the league. And that is 100% unrealistic.
phillies,3agfez,ihorsey,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:56:25 2015 UTC,"Not true. Franco's going to be over 3 WAR. Revere could get to 3 WAR. Best players in the league are 8 WAR players.  2 WAR is a league average player. If Galvis gets going again he could be over a 3 WAR player. If we added an above league average player at CF 2B and 1B that's what, another 12-13 WAR over the course of the season? Add in a FA SP that's another few wind."

phillies,3afjzp,hmpsnj,5,Fri Jun 19 23:31:19 2015 UTC,"The Phillies kind of screwed him in his first few years, but he hasn't really done enough to improve himself and get back on the right track.  He came up in 2010 and rode the bench at the end of the year, only getting occasional pinch hit appearances when he would have probably been better off going to the minors and getting consistent ABs. Then in 2011, he was playing so-so, but getting consistent MLB ABs for the first time, so some adjustment time should have been expected, but the Phillies went out and got Hunter Pence, and then sent Brown back to toil away in the minors for the rest of the season. Then he got hurt, couldn't get on the field, couldn't lock down a job.  The Phillies mishandled him in his first 2-3 years and seriously hurt his development IMO. They should have either never called him up, or called him up and let him just play and start, and see what they had. Instead they called him up, benched him, sent him up and down, traded for someone to replace him, flipped him between LF and RF.  Granted he has not been able to stay healthy or produce consistently when given his small windows of opportunity, so I can't say he's lived up to being the #1 prospect in all of baseball. I just don't want to see another highly touted prospect get the same treatment"

phillies,3aerxf,nickebee,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:34:51 2015 UTC,"Lee's trade to Seattle seemed to be forced and it appeared to done hesitantly and without a lot of thought and I'm more curious as to why it had to be done that way than with the return.  As great as Lee is he's been traded quite a few times and the returns have never been good.  Victorino and Pence were okay trades at the time.  The fact that both returns went south after that doesn't change that.  Prospects some time just don't work out and no GM has a 100% success rate on return on trades.  You win some, you lose some, that's just how it goes.  The crappy drafts up until Crawford were the fault of Marty Wolover.  He should have been fired way before he was but the ownership apparently makes it very hard to fire anyone, they're an extremely loyal group.  That's where change needs to occur.  His replacement has been more than excellent.  There is little doubt in my mind that Ruben will be gone soon.  Regardless of what his involvement may have or may not have been you can't be a part of this kind of a disaster and expect to be blameless.  Gillick is apparently looking for a new president and with that hiring hopefully there will be changes all throughout the system.  Ruben is the target of a lot of hate but there's so much more wrong here that a simple GM change won't fix it.  Regarding trades that may be coming, right now it appears the organization is on a roll and building nicely so hopefully that trend will continue."

phillies,3adam0,dubswaddy,2,Fri Jun 19 04:31:33 2015 UTC,"Well, looks like 2015 isn't a total bust."
phillies,3ah5pv,Tal_Venada,3,Sat Jun 20 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of Howard being 70% likely to be traded vs. Cole only being 25% likely is pretty ridiculous. I'd put Howard's chances a lot closer to 5% or lower. Unless he magically raises his OBP by a lot over the next month, I can't imagine any team in baseball feeling a necessity for a DH with an OBP of .279 and a combined 1.1 WAR offensive value over the past three seasons. The only, very slim, chance we have at moving Howard is by paying for much more of his contract than we'll most likely be willing to, for him to play elsewhere.  TBH, I'd argue an outright release of Howard is more likely than him being traded, but I don't think either is particularly likely."
phillies,3ah5pv,Scabdates,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:45:34 2015 UTC,What are your odds on Hamels being traded?
phillies,3ah5pv,Scabdates,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:55:31 2015 UTC,"It's tough to say. Assuming he plays well leading up to the trade deadline and is healthy, I think they're pretty high. The last I had read, several higher-ups around the league had stated that they think, despite the mockery he's received, RAJ will get what he's looking for in the Hamels deal. I'd put the % chance above 50, just because (as described in your article) there are a lot of ideal fits out there for him. Even the Red Sox could have a turnaround (much crazier things have happened) and then Hamels would suddenly be on their radar. If they're suddenly in the wild card race heading towards July 31st, I think they'd absolutely move to trade for Hamels. Honestly, I think the seller's market is what will help us most. There aren't a lot of pitchers that have as much value as Hamels leading up the deadline, IMO.  I mean, the Cubs got Addison Russell for half a season of Samardjiza and I don't think he's as good of a player or as good of a value as Hamels is. And I don't necessarily think that trade was bad for Oakland either, though obviously their playoff hopes were shortlived.  I could also be horribly wrong and Hamels could end up a Philly until his contract runs out. You really never know with the Phillies.  I think if RAJ wants to, he can for sure get 2-3 top prospects from a team in exchange for Hamels at the deadline.  Honestly, we could be looking at a really good farm if we're able to move Papelbon, Hamels, Harang and Revere."
phillies,3abmqd,RiskyBryzness,9,Thu Jun 18 19:58:06 2015 UTC,Good deal for one of my favorite Phillies of all time.  Part of me really wants to see if we can pull of 27 losses in a row though.

phillies,3aaxtl,feralmonkeyboy,7,Thu Jun 18 20:37:24 2015 UTC,He is going to get hit like pinata.
phillies,3aaxtl,Flipadelphia26,2,Thu Jun 18 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"not if he keeps walking guys like he's been in the minors, maybe thats what made him effective?  i remember he got hammered out of the bullpen with the Phils.  I can't remember another pitcher getting hit that hard.  Like the balls were coming off like lasers off the opposing batters bats.    Maybe he's learned to get less of the strike zone at the cost of walks but eventually hes going to have to learn not to walk guys while staying out of the middle of the plate.  I'm rooting for him.  He's talked about his size and compared it to randy johnson who was a late bloomer because he had to deal with getting his whole body under control.  Let's hope aumont has figured something out and can harness that ability.  Nothing to lose.  This really will be his last stand with the Phils if he doesn't show something."

phillies,3ab12u,flyersfan0233,9,Thu Jun 18 17:21:24 2015 UTC,"Who cares? They aren't going to hire a new coach now anyway because Amaro is a lame duck and (very probably) gone after the season.   Here's how it goes: They hire a new president. That president hires the new GM. The new GM brings in his new head coach. They aren't going to fire Sandberg and have Bowa finish out the year and no real coach is going to A)be found midseason or B) sign on with a GM who is out the door in 3+ months or C) going to turn this team around this season anyway.   Seriously, the season is lost, don't get too up or down until trades start happening. Then after that, don't get too up or down until the season is over and the paragraph above starts in motion."
phillies,3ab12u,damthesehigheels,4,Thu Jun 18 17:33:22 2015 UTC,The scouting and farm crews need to go as well.  It's not much surprise that the leaders in AAA are mirroring the leaders in the MLB.  They have been investing in both the current teams and their future.  We have been doing neither and it's going to get even worse because we still don't have a back fill for the top players we have lost in recent years.

phillies,3aah9y,envriogis,4,Thu Jun 18 15:14:39 2015 UTC,They are definitely available. I went to a game a few weeks ago and bought tickets at the window and they had standing room for $17. They also had 300 level seats for $17 so it didn't really make sense to get standing room.
phillies,3aah9y,sokrazyitmightwork,3,Thu Jun 18 15:21:57 2015 UTC,Even online rooftop bleachers right under the liberty bell are only $1-2 more than standing room only and 400 is only $1-2 more than rooftop bleachers.  I went last night and was kind of depressed at how relatively empty the place is.  I'm expecting that there will be more Washington and Mets fans at the remaining series than Phillies fans.
phillies,3aah9y,keepinithamsta,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"I like standing room. I can get a cheap place to watch the game from fairly close to the field and it's nice to have some shade on a hot day. Not that it matters much this season, but I like getting there a little early to scope out a good spot that is close to both home plate and a beer stand. Can't beat that."
phillies,3aah9y,ohfishsticks,2,Fri Jun 19 00:37:08 2015 UTC,"I mean, you can still walk around and find a standing spot with a regular ticket. So when they're the same price, you might as well get the seat so you have it if you want it."
phillies,3aah9y,sokrazyitmightwork,5,Fri Jun 19 12:57:28 2015 UTC,You could probably buy tickets on stubhub the day of the game for as much as a face value standing room ticket would cost.
phillies,3aah9y,Ship_of_Fools26,3,Thu Jun 18 15:22:24 2015 UTC,"17 bucks, can get standing room at the gate. They don't sell out so you will have no problem getting those tickets."
phillies,3aah9y,Chenzo04,-3,Thu Jun 18 16:00:16 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure they only offer standing room only tickets when the game is sold out, so it's not likely this season..."

phillies,3ab35q,thechurchofbradlidge,2,Thu Jun 18 23:33:37 2015 UTC,I think it is too early to tell. Not enough scouting being done and not enough thorough scouting when it is being done.
phillies,3ab35q,Jayyburdd,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:25:24 2015 UTC,A lot can change in a year. The talent might separate itself.
phillies,3ab35q,ihorsey,0,Thu Jun 18 22:46:15 2015 UTC,"I tried looking for this yesterday, but from what I could find no.  It seems like next year will be pitcher heavy at the top, but I don't know how much draft prospect rankings change in baseball.  Fangraphs has Alec Hansen as the top pick, but mentions he has command issues.  Bleacher Report also has Hansen first.  In his college career in 93 innings, he struck out 110, but walked 57, has an ERA north of 4, and a WHIP of 1.45.  If he really is the best prospect, he doesn't sound like a Strasburg, or Harper level prospect."
phillies,3ab35q,RenderedInGooseFat,3,Thu Jun 18 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"Remember though a few years ago when that SS kept shooting up and got taken by the Astros at number 1.  Lets just wait.  No matter what, you are going to get a good prospect at number 1 even in a bad year.  But I think I heard somewhere that they expect next year to be deeper than this year."

phillies,3ab35q,sjphilsphan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:20:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying next year is going to be garbage, or anything like that.  I know next to nothing about the MLB draft, so I am just basing all of this on what a few people wrote.  It wouldn't surprise me at all for some guy to shoot up draft boards within the next year.  As it stands though, there doesn't appear to be a generational type prospect, like OP asked about, but that doesn't mean the prospects available are garbage.  Two spots after Harper went, Machado was taken.  I would be very happy with a prospect on the level of Machado, or Gerrit Cole, or Correa, or Buxton, or Bryant, and all of them weren't thought of as generational type players when they were taken.  A once in a generation prospect like Harper would be awesome to have, but a great prospect that hits the majors in 2-3 years, and plays great would be pretty awesome also."
phillies,3ab35q,RenderedInGooseFat,-2,Thu Jun 18 19:23:00 2015 UTC,"Why, do you think this is the NBA?  1 guy isn't going to win you a WS.  Look at the Nats.  They have 2 ""generational"" talents and they have done shit and won't do shit with that slop roster.  This Phillies team needs a lineup and a pitching staff and a BP.   They have 3 guys in the system right now who could be above avg MLB players if everything breaks right.  Even if Monty, Tri-Play Associates, Double Play Inc, the Betz family and Giles sold tomorrow and a new owner came in and hired Beinfest to run this ship it would take years to rebuild this team.  They'd be lucky to contend by 2020.    You guys need to buckle up.  There is no quick fix.  Get ready for multiple 100 loss seasons."
phillies,3ab35q,hakan_loob44,2,Thu Jun 18 23:23:11 2015 UTC,"They have more than 3 guys who could be above avg MLB players if everything breaks right. I know our farm is basically middle of the road, but your statement is some real hyperbole there."
phillies,3ab35q,TheRedViper1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:58:05 2015 UTC,"What people have to remember is that it's easier for teams like the Phillies, Yankees and Red Sox to rebuild than everyone else. We already have Nola, Crawford, and hopefully Randolph as legit top prospects. We will hopefully come out of the trade deadline with another handful of legit young players. We will have a very high pick next year, and probably again in 2017. If a few of those guys can pan out and be good players, we have plenty of resources to build a team around them, maybe sign a star free agent. I honestly expect this team to have a real direction this time next year, and be starting to at least be competitive by 2017/2018."

phillies,3a47a3,ContinuumGuy,6,Wed Jun 17 03:38:05 2015 UTC,Out of curiosity...are they not allowed to have cellphones or other electronics there or something? What prevents them from just calling the bullpen some other way?
phillies,3a47a3,reki,9,Wed Jun 17 03:12:04 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there is some rule about non-approved electronics in dugouts.  Question is, why didn't they simply call time out and explain to the umpire that something was wrong with the phone? I guess there wasn't technically that much time between realizing something was wrong with it and when they resorted to towel waving, but calling time out would seem the first logical thing to do."
phillies,3a47a3,lardbiscuits,13,Wed Jun 17 03:14:47 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt that phone was off the hook unintentionally. This team is lost and Sandberg has to go. There is no way that the bullpen failed to realize the phone was off the hook. There is no way no one looked at it, wondering why the fuck it wasn't ringing as their outfielder was at 50 pitches.   Someone needs to be fired fifteen minutes ago. That was more than embarrassing. It was a farce. You do not leave a fucking outfielder on the mound for two innings, fifty pitches just out to dry like that. So irresponsible. We'll be lucky if he isn't hurt tomorrow.   Even Utley was visibly pissed."
phillies,3a47a3,Diarygirl,2,Wed Jun 17 03:35:40 2015 UTC,I could maybe see them having technical difficulties but for two innings?  That's the most messed up part.    I didn't watch the game.  What do you think is the bullpen's rationale for not answering the phone?
phillies,3a47a3,lardbiscuits,6,Wed Jun 17 04:04:51 2015 UTC,I don't know. I think there's clearly some inner turmoil between this team and its inner management. Maybe it was some sort of fuck you to Sandberg for even having Frenchy out there throwing. Maybe it was for leaving him out there two innings. I don't know.   All I know is it was clearly off the hook. There's just no way they wouldn't notice it.
phillies,3a47a3,Diarygirl,2,Wed Jun 17 04:11:22 2015 UTC,"There's been a few good games this year, but far too many disasters like this.  They've reached a new low in almost a cartoonish way.

Our focus should be stopping the damn bleeding.  End the game.  This pitiful and embarrassing loss.  This caused my team to be the laughing stock all of baseball yesterday, even amidst the whole Cardinals debacle.    I might be overreacting.  But I'm pretty upset about this.

phillies,3a4pgy,keepinithamsta,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:08:02 2015 UTC,there is no point in firing Sandberg at this point.  The organization has an upper-management problem that is more glaring.  I don't think they get rid of Amaro or any coaches until the president situation is resolved.  No big decisions will be made until then I believe.  I also think thats part of the reason why they made no trades at the deadline last season (in addition to amaro's ineptitude).  It seems like there is no one in charge and the team is reflecting like it on the field.

Too much of an old guard feel. No way it was suddenly going to gel. Still, he has shown zero creativity and the team is visibly frustrated and clearly not playing for him.   We'll be lucky if Frenchy doesn't have a sore arm for a week after tonight. What a stupid fucking thing to do to leave him out there an extra inning. 50 pitches. Makes me furious.

phillies,3a3cm0,15thStreet,8,Wed Jun 17 02:03:09 2015 UTC,Sandberg will let him go another 50 pitches or so. Builds character in a new pitcher.

phillies,3a3cm0,kirkedout,7,Wed Jun 17 00:38:06 2015 UTC,That was some bush league bullshit by your pitcher.
phillies,3a3cm0,aresef,6,Wed Jun 17 00:44:30 2015 UTC,Agreed. Another layer to the humiliation. (Mostly cause he failed to hit him.)
phillies,3a3cm0,eschersnightmare,3,Wed Jun 17 01:23:34 2015 UTC,Didn't your third baseman throw a bat at a player?
phillies,3a3cm0,15thStreet,4,Wed Jun 17 01:25:11 2015 UTC,But he learned his lesson. His teammates pulled him aside and told him that's not how we play here. And he's behaved well since.
phillies,3a3cm0,aresef,2,Wed Jun 17 01:40:52 2015 UTC,"Cool story. One of those teammates being the anti-semetic drunk who threw a bat at an umpire himself, right?"

phillies,3a3cm0,15thStreet,2,Wed Jun 17 01:44:33 2015 UTC,What is your point? No player can be perfect off the field. All I'm saying is they shouldn't be throwing at them on it.
phillies,3a3cm0,aresef,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:49:41 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is they shouldn't be hateful towards an entire ethnic group, drive their car while under the influence and put human lives at risk and then fight the police when caught or throw big wooden clubs at other people.

It also shows that a large segment of this teams fans just want to bitch and complain. This story is about how one of the most successful organizations in baseball broke laws, serious laws, to remain competitive.   I see this story and I think about how despicable the Cardinals are, and they're a franchise I admired and respected prior to seeing this.  I see this story and I instantly go from wishing The Phillies were more like them to being super proud they're nothing like them.   The Cardinals should, depending on when this all started, be stripped of any titles they've won and they should have to forfeit future draft picks,  How many of you know that the Cardinals are given extra ""competitive balance"" draft picks every year?  Yeah, every year they're given a sandwich pick after the 2nd round because they're a ""small market team"" that needs the extra draft picks to remain competitive.  But apparently that's not enough.  No, apparently they also need to illegally hack another teams network to get that teams proprietary information.  Fucking scumbags."

phillies,3a2mjf,jimmer_jimmer,5,Wed Jun 17 02:35:02 2015 UTC,It is because the owners themselves fail to see how necessary analytics are.  The rumor is that the order to sign Howard to his absurd contract was straight from Montey b/c Howard was a hero from the World Series year

phillies,3a2mjf,kip_chelly,7,Wed Jun 17 05:09:14 2015 UTC,"You kids are going to live through what I lived through from 1985 till 07.  While all you are busy blasting Ruben for this team, I'll point the finger at the only constant for the last 30 years.  The baseball men who run this front office are only the symptom of a bigger problem.  The problem is people who own this team.  Giles(we're a small market team), Monty, Tri-Play Associates, Double Play inc and Clare S. Betz are the cancer that needs to be cut out.    Don't be blinded by the payroll.  Ruben and Monty have said that the only reason they ever spent this much was because they were making money.  This is the same old cheap organization.  Want to know the first sign that the cheap skates where back?  If you guessed drafting Biddle  you're right.  Want to know the 2nd sign?  Not giving Lopes the pay raise he wanted.  The 3rd sign?  Drafting Larry Fucking Greene Jr in 2011.  The 4th sign?  Chuck Lamar quitting.  The 5th sign? Not spending money on any of the Cuban players who've come along in the last 5 years.  The 6th sign?  Dumping Pence for nothing because they were scared his arbitration deal would take them over the luxury tax threshold.    There's more to building a winning baseball team than signing a bunch overpriced free agents.  This team has historically refused to spend money in the draft and internationally.  This why you get all these toolsy guys in the system who either never develop or get exposed once they get called up.    You can blame Wolever for all the failed picks.  You also have to give him credit for the good ones that he managed to make with ownership tying one hand behind his back.  The man and his scouts have uncovered more players in 14 years than Johnny Alamarez did in CIN. and ATL.   People think Lee Thomas was a bad GM.  No he wasn't.  He never had a chance to succeed with these owners unwilling to forsake their bottom line for the product on the field.    These owners are stuck in the past just like Ed Snider.  They're loyal to their people who support this cheap way of operating. Which is why they still have Dallas and Wade hanging around.  It's why Ruben wasn't canned 2 years ago and why they hire guys from the fucking Orioles who haven't had a good system in god knows how long.    This MacPhail news fits right in with this ownership groups mindset.  Conservative, cheap, old school baseball man way of thinking.  Why anyone would hire him over Beinfest who worked for the craziest and cheapest owner in the MLB is beyond me.  But I do know why they won't hire Beinfest.  He would come in as president and completely turnover that front office.  No one would be left.  What about the roster?  They'd all be gone. Utley never would of been allowed to hang around for so long, nor Howard or Hamels or Rollins.  Monty would have a heart attack if Beinfest had a firesale like he did in Miami.    I can go on and on about why this ownership group needs to go.  This is only scratching the surface.  I'm afraid dark days are here again until the silent partners all disappear.  I don't even think MIddleton is the savior anymore."

And you do realize that you need more than 1 middle infielder right? So if Kingery was the best player they had on their board, or made the most sense based on the money for that slot, then he has a chance to be our second baseman of the future since, contrary to your perception, JP Crawford will not be playing both shortstop and second base every day."
phillies,3a2mjf,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:58:57 2015 UTC,lol I remember Rico Brogna Mickey Morandi Desi Relaford infield. Anyway we just don't use advanced stats as an organization so we sign people to stupid contracts or pick the wrong type of players. Its like Ruben watches batting practice and whoever hits the ball the furthest and is the best athlete gets drafted instead of analyzing data and comparing and contrasting with whats been successful. The teams that are really good especially the Giants use all types of analytics with shifting and pitching to get the right players. I saw someone in here say the problem is spending money its the complete opposite we need to spend less money and stop relying on trades and actually draft talent based on data and not eye ball it and not pay players over 30 it isn't the steroid era.
phillies,3a1blu,gigi700gigi,5,Tue Jun 16 13:28:30 2015 UTC,Honestly take the approach I had with the Sixers just expect the worst than be pleasantly surprised when they do better than that.  At least the Sixers have a method to the madness the Phillies not so much..

Young guys struggle. Cody Asche fucked a play up last night that led directly to the game winning run. Franco got tossed. Giles had his little hissy fit over the weekend. This is how players learn. There are a few pieces here that are gonna be helpful on the way back up, if not the next good team.  Lastly, if you're mad now, wait until late August and September when most notable players have been traded."

phillies,39xc7z,AssDotCom,10,Mon Jun 15 16:07:59 2015 UTC,"Even if Ruben manages to trade Hamels, Harang, Papelbon, Revere, and Howard for good return (on paper), I honestly just don't see how he comes back.  Especially if the organization is planning on replacing Gillick as team president.  It's a shame that Ruben wasn't able to stay ahead of the curve.  He was great at sustaining success, (lets all relive 2011 again), and people forget very quickly how great he was for bringing talent on-board to do so (Halladay, Ibanez, Lee, Papelbon).  Unfortunately, he just did not have enough insight to know when it was time to sell certain players.  We might be singing a different song had he rode out 2012, then began making massive changes the following off-season.  And yet with all of that said, who knows. I still am not completely sure if he was taking orders through 2011-2013, because the TV contract weighed heavily on his actions.    I do know one thing for certain.  That I want the next regime to embrace sabermetrics."
phillies,39xc7z,sokrazyitmightwork,6,Mon Jun 15 16:35:12 2015 UTC,"Especially if the organization is planning on replacing Gillick as team president.   They aren't replacing Gillick in the sense that they are changing direction, Gillick is replacing himself because he wants to go back to being retired.   The Phillies have always been (probably to a fault) one of the most loyal organizations in baseball. Ruben has been with this organization his entire career, I'm not sure I see them kicking him to the curb, unless a new guy (maybe this guy) comes in and is dead set on bringing in his own GM. Ever since Montgomery stepped down as president, Ruben has done a solid job. I honestly think Ruben can rebuild this team as long as they hire the right guy to take Gillick's place overseeing him."
phillies,39xc7z,r35h93,4,Mon Jun 15 16:45:33 2015 UTC,"As long as he isnt like another Andy Mac also in Philly, I hope it'll be okay. Fuck you MacDonald you bum."
phillies,39xc7z,TheSubversive,12,Mon Jun 15 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"This is the guy.  I've wanted him for like 2 years now.  I couldn't be happier that this report came out.  This is the guy that built the Orioles up from a shit team to a legitimate contender by drafting well and trading extremely well.  Uehara to Texas for Chris Johnson and Tommy Hunter.  He acquired Adam Jones, Chris Tillman, Manny Machado and countless other pieces that make them a really good team.  He didn't stick around to see the end result but almost every piece they have that's contributing was because of him."
phillies,39xc7z,damthesehigheels,6,Mon Jun 15 16:18:54 2015 UTC,Chris Davis not Johnson. And Machado was drafted not traded for.   But your point is still very correct.
phillies,39xc7z,TheSubversive,2,Mon Jun 15 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"Lol, right Davis.  I put ""acquired"" to kind of cover Machado and I may even be wrong about MacPhail being there for that.  Not sure when he was drafted but yeah, the overall point.  This guy is really great at building an organization."
phillies,39xc7z,aresef,2,Mon Jun 15 18:49:48 2015 UTC,It was Chris Davis he got in the Uehara deal. And I agree that he set up a lot of the pieces for us to contend here. When Duquette got here he pumped up international scouting (signed Wei-Yin Chen and Miguel Gonzalez) and found gems like McLouth in the scrap heap.
phillies,39xc7z,silverence,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:31:13 2015 UTC,"How much control over personal decisions in Baltimore? Honest question. Cuz it seems to me that RAJ's biggest sin, that really caused everything else is his inability to hire quality scouts. I doubt he's done much scouting himself, and while the majority of finale decisions probably fell to him, he had to make those decisions relying on the advice of the people scouting for him. That advice, without question, has been pretty shitty."
phillies,39xc7z,TheSubversive,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:52:46 2015 UTC,"A lot.  As president he would have final say over everything.  He would work closely with the top brass of every facet of the organization, including all the minor league guys.  And I think it was last year they fired the head scout, Marty Wolever and replaced him with this guy Johnny Almarez and he's really impacted the organization positively since he got here.  For what it's worth, Ruben may not be to blame for all of the problems.  There were some reports this offseason that it was Montgomery making all of those very bad decisions.  Keeping all the Rollins' and Utleys' around, the Howard extension, dealing Lee, all of it was done at Montgomerys command.  I don't know and I doubt any of us will ever find out exactly what caused that massive string of awful decisions.  What I do know is that every move made since Montgomery took his leave has been really good, the Rollins and Byrd trades highlighting that list.  If MacPhail is brought in then I would care less what happens to Amaro; stay, go, whatever.  He'll be answering to someone who knows what to do and he won't be able to make any decisions without running it by the president.  Man, if they can bring him in before the deadline I would be ecstatic."
phillies,39xc7z,silverence,2,Mon Jun 15 19:02:23 2015 UTC,"All I want to know is if he would ever say that walks aren't production.  But thanks for the reply, that's definitely a good point and gives me hope for the future. I, personally, am in the camp that the tragedy of the Phillies can't be laid at the feet of Amaro entirely. That being said, his ""Phillies fans don't understand the game"" bullshit is still entirely unpalatable given the circumstances."

Once the change at top is made, everything else will follow including getting rid of Amaro.    I think the failure to make any changes in the past year-plus is because it's been kind of a lame duck situation with Montgomery being sick.

Sure they only scored 3 runs but they held their opponent to 6 runs and lost 3 games by scores of 1-0, 4-3, and 1-0.  And that's a pretty good team they were playing.  I don't care if you only score 1 run per game.  If you're able to hold your opponent to 0 runs than you're doing great.  Runs don't matter, run differential does."

Then the say Sandberg is misusing De Fratus because he is pitching him too much?  Either the starter pitches deeper or the bullpen gets more work.  It can't be both, and De Fratus is most talented one behind Paps and Giles, he should get the work.  He's earned it."

Doesn't walk, but finds other ways to get on base (infield singles).  Not a high OBP, and not an ideal leadoff hitter, but provides energy and good speed at the bottom of any lineup.  As a position player, he is better suited for left field as his arm and range was exposed in center.    Hoping that we trade him by the deadline for a A/AA above average prospect.

phillies,39r9zf,wontonsoupsucka,3,Sun Jun 14 04:09:34 2015 UTC,"Shame you're getting downvoted for ""lol nope"", because what you said is true.  wRC+ is ""the"" stat to compare players' offensive contributions across ballparks and years, and Ruf's career numbers support your argument.  I wasn't familiar with wRC+, so I looked up the more typical stats.  Here are Ruf's career major-league batting numbers in 558 plate appearances, a full season for a full-time starter.  Source.  .248 AVG, .328 OBP, .447 SLG, 23 HR, 58 RBI, 58 BB, 160 K.  Ruf has better than average offense; he's just been bad this year."
phillies,39r9zf,bestnottosay,10,Sun Jun 14 14:16:27 2015 UTC,Nobody likes to make fun of Ryan Howard more than I do but his OPS over the last 2 years vs RHP is still a good .200 points higher than Ruf's.
phillies,39r9zf,MrMountie,-5,Sun Jun 14 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"There just isn't a place on a major league roster for a guy who can only play first base against lefties.   Guess you've never heard of a platoon, huh?  And oh yeah, in 2013, which is really the only time Ruf was given a decent shot at playing everyday, in 212 PA's against right handed pitchers Ruf had a .269/.363/.500 (.863 OPS) line.    So there's that...but ya know, I guess if it's ""painfully obvious"" than you can't argue with that, right?"
phillies,39r9zf,TheSubversive,2,Sun Jun 14 02:41:34 2015 UTC,"You can see it's obvious that he's easily exploitable by right handed pitchers. His K rates against them over the last two years are over 30%, his OPS is around .400 (I don't remember the exact numbers but he's bottom 5 in OPS vs RHP over the last 2 years in the entire league), most of the balls he hits against them are pull side grounders. Guys like that get DFA'd not ""chances"".   Darin Ruf = John Mayberry Jr. but worse"
phillies,39r9zf,MrMountie,5,Sun Jun 14 02:56:00 2015 UTC,"Okay, I don't want to argue but try to have an open mind about what I'm going to say. I'll admit he hasn't been good for the last two years.  Have an open mind.  Ruf was good.  He was a good player with a lot of potential and a few very good tools.  He blossomed late in the minors but he did blossom and he looked like he could be a legitimate MLB regular.  They called him up for a chance in 2013 and he did exactly what he does and the results were very good, excellent in fact.  But the organization never committed to him, they never nurtured his potential.  In fact, they did exactly the opposite.  They sent him down to AAA and then called him back up and then down again and the whole time they made him feel that what he was doing wasn't good.  So he changed his approach.  He stopped doing the things that made him valuable because this organization did not value those things and they let him know it by their actions.  And the biggest thing he did well was plate discipline.  It was that plate discipline that made him valuable; he knew the strike zone, was patient, would take a walk and when he got his pitch he would jump on it and crush it.  Once he stopped doing that it all fell apart.  This is what people mean when they say he never got his chance.  If at your job you did everything that you thought you were supposed to do and even got good results because of it and they constantly demoted you and made you feel insecure about what you were doing, how would that affect what you did?  Keep in mind that you can't leave that job because they own your rights to work.  You'd change what you did or you just wouldn't care....well, now you're Darin Ruf.  You say he can't hit righties?  Guess what, they told him he can't hit righties.  They told him, actually despite evidence to the contrary, that he was a right hand batting platoon player who would only play against lefties.  At one point he was actually better against right handed pitching; people who analyzed these things called him the rare ""reverse split platoon player.""  It may be too late for him now but if he was put in an organization that actually valued the ability to walk and they gave him positive reinforcements he would have been a hell of a player.  I genuinely feel bad for that guy."
phillies,39r9zf,TheSubversive,-1,Sun Jun 14 03:49:45 2015 UTC,The Phils didn't ruin him - he's just not very good.
phillies,39r9zf,deadnside,2,Sun Jun 14 10:19:55 2015 UTC,"Despite what some of these other ""people"" say, you are absolutely right.  He's never been given a real shot and the only time he was given somewhat of a chance he started to prove himself.  The organization severely dropped the ball on this guy and it goes back to them not valuing, like at all, the ability to not make an out.  When he first came up in 2012 and then in 2013 he showed a tremendous discipline at the plate.  I think at one point he had a 30 game on-base streak, his OBP for 2013 was .350.  And he showed that he could hit for power by hitting 14 HR's in 2013 in only 251 AB's.  That's a HR every 18 AB's.  251 AB's is about half a season so he could conceivably be a 25 HR/year guy....who gets on base at over a third of the time.  That's what's called extremely serviceable.  Instead, he sees himself getting older and tries to mold his game more to what the organization wants and the whole thing looks bad.  His defense at 1B is solid, not great and not bad but because of an earlier mistake the organization made there was no room at 1B.  So they shoehorn him into a position he's clearly not suited for and lo and behold he's not great at it and any value he may have had is lost.  Look, if it was me and I was in charge I would have seen that he was blocked at 1B but when Howard was injured brought Ruf up and tried to prove that there was value there to another team and then turned that value into a prospect at a position that maybe wouldn't be blocked.  The Phillies actually did the exact opposite and instead of ""propping him up"" they tore him down and any value that they could have marketed with it.  Again, while the ability to get on base and hit for power isn't so much valued here you can look around the league and see a ton of teams where they're among their chief values.  Put this guy on the A's and he's Brandon Moss.  I genuinely fell very bad for this guy because he clearly just ended up in the wrong organization at the wrong time."

If I remember correctly last season he mostly kept his hands still and his problem was timing the pitches to get in his wheelhouse.  he sliced everything he made contact on.  I don't know i could be wrong about all this, haven't seen this dude play in a long time.  also Ruf got a raw-deal, freaking Phillies front-office"

Eventually he would  have shown something if he belonged here as an everyday player. The only difference between him and Brown is the disappointment level with Brown is much greater because of the ceiling we thought he had.  Either way, I'd rather have both up here than Jeff Francoeur. No idea what they see in him as part of anything going forward."

phillies,39r9zf,sjphilsphan,4,Sun Jun 14 01:38:34 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I get the feeling someone in the Phillies organization just has it out for Ruf.

The team is going to be awful regardless, we might as well stick high upside guys like Brown and Ruf out there for a full season and see what they can do. They've both recently shown the ability to be dominant offensive players, they could be like Jose Bautista/Edwin Encarnacion and really put it all together if given a shot. If not, there's nothing to lose, Sizemore and Francoeur were known lost causes going into the year."

phillies,39r9zf,ObligatoryHandle,3,Sun Jun 14 16:20:45 2015 UTC,"Well he's coming off 3 seasons totalling 887 PAs with just a .269 OBP and .346 SLG in that span and negative defensive value every year. That stinks of lost cause to me for a 31 year old. This year he's been alright with a 97 wRC+, but it should've been clear from the beginning that the guy had no upside. What is the point of sticking a guy out there who was a longshot to perform slightly below average? I actually really like Francoeur, I've always thought he was a really great guy. But, the guy has had a 0% of chance of helping us from the very beginning, and he shouldn't be stealing playing time from guys with even a 1% chance of building some future/trade value."
phillies,39r9zf,wontonsoupsucka,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:17:54 2015 UTC,he shouldn't be stealing playing time from guys with even a 1% chance of building some future/trade value.   Okay this I will concede. He is not a long term player so he should not be taking up space in a position where we have young players who deserve a shot.   Maybe we can get something for him at the deadline since he's been decent this year. Buy low sell high!

phillies,39pd65,ihorsey,16,Sat Jun 13 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"We probably do but the staff was not at fault here.  He was asked to walk a dangerous left handed hitter with a base open in a tie game in the eight.  He (Giles) got all pissy about it.  Then he walks the next batter unintentionally because he can't get over it, loading the bases.  Then he goes 3-0 to the next batter, one ball away from walking in the winning run.  At 3-1 he throws a close pitch that was most likely a ball but gets a gift from the umpire.  Then he throws a high fastball that he gets lucky the batter swings and misses at.  I don't care who you are, you listen to your coaches.  And if you have a problem with what they say or do you talk to them afterward like a professional.  Not glare at them from the mound, almost blow the game, and then continue to argue with them in the dugout.  He 100% brought this on himself and I really hope he learns from it."
phillies,39pd65,TheSubversive,-1,Sat Jun 13 15:46:11 2015 UTC,"Oh geeze I didn't hear all of that. If he actually walked those guys because he was mad, it might be the dumbest thing I've ever seen."

phillies,39pd65,Charmanderp7,3,Sat Jun 13 17:26:22 2015 UTC,It was bad on Giles part.  No doubt in my mind.  Sandberg made the correct baseball move and Giles threw a fit and let it affect his game.
phillies,39pd65,TheSubversive,4,Sat Jun 13 19:17:50 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one that thinks Sandberg and crew have disrespected Giles and treated him like crap all year? He's likely the future of the Phillies bullpen and maybe their most promising asset. This is a bad example because you should NEVER show up your teammates or coaches on the field, but it doesn't shock me. His frustration probably built up all year. I doubt he was just having a ""moody"" day."
phillies,39pd65,nmandarano,1 point,Sat Jun 13 19:42:18 2015 UTC,The Phillies pitching coaches cannot be credited for Giles doing well. We've had a lot of decent AAA pitchers come up and suck because they don't have the same (relative to the skill level of play) quality of coaching.   I don't think our pitching/bench/etc have the right to get pissed off at our best players.

phillies,39pd65,MLBVideoConverterBot,2,Sat Jun 13 20:12:19 2015 UTC,"Giles was wrong because you have to respect the coaches' decisions but after watching that video, there was no need for McClure to pile it on.    Sandberg had his exchange with Giles and that should have been it.  At that point Giles is pretty fired up, there is no point in McClure talking to him.  He's just adding fuel to the fire.    If anyone's ever had a disagreement or made a mistake at work and had several bosses come up to them they should know how Giles feels.  People hate being told the same thing over and over again by different people because there is no point to it, they've already been told the same thing.  In that instance McClure was wrong.  Too many similar personalities with the Phillies coaches in Sandberg, Bowa and McClure it seems."
phillies,39pd65,feralmonkeyboy,2,Sun Jun 14 04:20:00 2015 UTC,"Giles was wrong, but Sandberg again had no one warming up, and Giles had 23 pitches. He is killing this young guys for no reason."

phillies,39pd65,TheSubversive,12,Sat Jun 13 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"He should have let his pitcher pitch.  We are not going to lose the division by the 10-20 games that a manager can make up with on point strategy.  If Giles wants to see if he can get out Alvarez in a pressure situation then why not let him try.  That information and experience matter way more than a win at this point.    I'm not saying that Sandberg needs to go, but this was a mistake."
phillies,39pd65,Hypertension123456,14,Sat Jun 13 16:03:39 2015 UTC,"Even the best of pitchers intentionally walk dangerous batters in those situations.   No point of practicing a situation that will never happen. A team will almost always walk a dangerous batter with a base open and two outs than let the pitcher pitch. And if they didn't walk him they would use a pitcher change to get a good matchup.   So in my opinion, 100% best baseball decision made by Ryne Sandberg and one that any other manager would've made the same."
phillies,39pd65,thebigthunk,6,Sat Jun 13 16:20:15 2015 UTC,"These guys are professionals getting paid millions of dollars, they aren't going to go out there and screw around. You go out to win games no matter how bad you are. Sanberg was applying a strategy that has been in play since the dawn of the power hitter. Giles just couldn't let his ego rest for a minute."
phillies,39pd65,yourbestfwend,5,Sat Jun 13 21:14:51 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  He's a kid and he needs to learn to listen to his manager.  And the flip side is that Ryno would have gotten even more criticsm, ""How could you let him pitch to that guy with a base open"" is all you would hear.  ""He doesn't know how to manage"".  It was the absolute 100% correct baseball move; base open, righty on power hitting lefty, late in a tie game - everything."
phillies,39pd65,TheSubversive,-2,Sat Jun 13 19:16:39 2015 UTC,"""He doesn't know how to manage"".   Every manager hears that.

He could have started this rebuild right after Howard tore his achillies because we have really competed since then.

He could have started this rebuild right after Howard tore his achillies because we have really competed since then.   You're suggesting that a team coming off a 102 win season that saw one of the best starting rotations in baseball history start rebuilding because they lost their first baseman for half the season?   He could have fired Manual much sooner, he was out coached in the playoffs every season even 2008 it just didn't matter because that team was so stacked.   You are suggesting firing the manager that won 5 division titles, 2 pennants, and a title, all while coaching a team that increased its win totals for 6 straight seasons under his watch, at the first sign of trouble?  If Ruben did any of these things you would have lost your fucking mind. I'm tired of the bullshit Ruben narrative. It's over. It happened. The team imploded. He's not gonna fucking fire himself. He's here, and he's objectively done a decent job starting this rebuild. It's unpleasant to try and talk about the Phillies when all anyone does is discount every decision they make just because of who made the decision."

Those moves ultimately led us to where we are now, but they also made us the best team in baseball for a good stretch there. To play devil's advocate with my own argument, he should have been smarter about the long-term impact of his moves and shouldn't have just placated fan's desires. He also should have started it a year, maybe two before he did, but that's over and done with now and not necessarily a decision that was entirely in his control.   I would prefer someone else be the one overseeing the rebuild of the team frankly, but like you said he has actually done a pretty good job so far to start the rebuild."
phillies,39hoq6,Rsubs33,-1,Fri Jun 12 15:21:27 2015 UTC,"2011- Phillies picked Larry Green Jr., the very next pick at the same position was Jackie Bradley Jr. Who made it up with the team and started with the Red Sox last season, though he has struggled since coming up.   2012- Paco Rodriguez was selected early in the second round a little after the scrubs we drafted in the supplemental first round.   The scouting and drafting by the Phillies is horrible they are completely against saber metrics and sports science while every team int he league is using them and is ahead of them.   Yes, I wanted to blow up the team then and I thought how we continued to give big contracts to old players was insane.   Actually, I said fire Manual after he lost to the Yankees because he was seriously outcoached by Torre. Torre is a Hall of Famer, but Manual had the better team.

Sorry I didn't go fact check the managers, so you do have me there. I can go and find prospects that are better than the guys we drafted in our own farm system, but they were drafted far enough down that the rankings for the pre-draft would have been too far off that would have justifying them drafting them that high.

phillies,39gm76,Ship_of_Fools26,22,Thu Jun 11 16:12:49 2015 UTC,"Phillies writeup:   The Phillies nabbed a couple of very strong position-player prospects up top, addressing a critical need in the system without reaching for either player. Cornelius Randolph (1) ranks right there with Trenton Clark and Brendan Rodgers among the best pure hit tools among preps in the draft class, but his position is uncertain, to say the least. He's listed as a shortstop, but seems most likely to end up in left field. … Scott Kingery (2) was a great pick in the second round, a 70 runner and 60 defender at second base with good feel to hit and surprising pop for his size. He's aggressive to a fault, attacking pitches early in the count, putting the ball in play in 87 percent of his plate appearances this spring. … Prep shortstop Lucas Williams (3) was a reach, however. He's a projectable athlete who won't stay at short and doesn't have great bat speed or power right now.  South Carolina first baseman Kyle Martin (4) was a late-blooming producer who could always hit but came into some power late, and as a college senior, he'll save the Phils some money. The threshold for his bat to profile is high, but the swing is very simple and he made a ton of contact in a good conference this year. … Lefty Bailey Falter (5) has a lot of projection, but the arm isn't quick, and I'd like to see a better breaking ball. … Luke Leftwich (7) came to pitching somewhat late but was 90-94 with a 60 slider this spring and a good delivery. His father Phil pitched briefly for the Angels in the mid-1990s. … Colorado prep outfielder Greg Pickett (8) could take some of those savings from the selection of Martin; he's a big left-handed power bat with position questions. He might end up at first base as well, but there's at least a chance for him to stay in the outfield. … Josh Tobias (10) improved his defense at third base dramatically this spring, and the Florida Gator was another of the top seniors in the class."
phillies,39gm76,TheSubversive,3,Thu Jun 11 16:13:30 2015 UTC,"But some fucking jabroni said Kyle Martin was a ""massive reach"" so obviously Keith Law, one of the best prospect talent evaluators in all of baseball, doesn't know what he's talking about."

phillies,39g2rd,Charmanderp7,6,Thu Jun 11 14:10:25 2015 UTC,I guess that I'm in the minority.  I think Revere could serve as a valuable pinch runner in the post season.  But we need to understand that we won't get anything in return than an average/slightly above average AA/A prospect.  Which I'd be happy with providing what we get in return is young and has the potential to develop.
phillies,39g2rd,RicsFlair,6,Thu Jun 11 15:48:34 2015 UTC,You're not in the minority.  You're just knowledgeable about baseball and I can't say that about a lot of people on this sub.  Revere has value.  He has 2 above average tools and he uses them in his game perfectly.  He was in contention for a batting title last year and I believe he finished the season in the top 5 in hits and when he gets a single he can very easily and with great success steal 2nd.  Not every player on every team is an all star 5 tool phenom.
phillies,39g2rd,TheSubversive,2,Thu Jun 11 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Most players aren't 5 tool phenoms. And all WS winning teams had guys like Revere. Guys who do some things well and who fit into the overall scheme and use their strengths to help their team win.   Hell, the 08 Phillis rotation was Hamels, Moyer, Kendrick, Myers, Eaton and Blanton. And 3B was held down by Feliz and his .705 OPS."

phillies,39g2rd,RicsFlair,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:08:12 2015 UTC,Agreed. Ben Revere could be a really useful player on a contending team.
phillies,39g2rd,sokrazyitmightwork,-3,Thu Jun 11 18:12:34 2015 UTC,You're just knowledgeable about baseball and I can't say that about a lot of people on this sub.   Says the guy that defended Freddy Galvis a few weeks ago as being a good player.
phillies,39g2rd,DanceFactory,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"Not for anything but wasn't Freddy Galvis leading the team in average and hits a few weeks ago?  I mean, we all knew he would come down to earth soon.  The closest thing that I ever said to him being a good player, was when I hoped for an all-star appearance.  But that would imply just keeping his average and hits long enough until June.    Hell, if he hits into another hot streak, he might actually put together a decent season."
phillies,39g2rd,RicsFlair,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:01:56 2015 UTC,"No that wasn't a few weeks ago. He's hit .170 over the last 30 days and .056 over the last two weeks. Obviously he was going to regress but TheSubversive claimed Galvis had figured something out, while I pointed out that his career numbers were terrible and he was only on a hot streak. His numbers have come down to exactly where his career statistics say they should be. He's the same Freddy Galvis he's ever been."
phillies,39g2rd,DanceFactory,3,Fri Jun 12 21:19:54 2015 UTC,He'd be a good fit there.
phillies,39g2rd,ihorsey,4,Thu Jun 11 14:40:25 2015 UTC,"Bob Dutton of the Tacoma News Tribune reports that the Mariners did indeed contact the Phillies regarding Revere, but talks quickly halted due to the unreasonable asking price of James Paxton or Taijuan Walker."
phillies,39g2rd,TheSwampDweller,4,Thu Jun 11 19:38:09 2015 UTC,Fucking Ruben
phillies,39g2rd,sokrazyitmightwork,2,Thu Jun 11 19:40:48 2015 UTC,"I honestly think he's just not in a rush to make these deals. The deadline is when you are going to get max value. No reason to trade Revere today if you're not getting overpaid for it. Set your asking prices high now, and settle only when you have to. He hasn't settled at the past few deadlines, but this is the first time he's going into one admitting that we're rebuilding.  We saw him get really good value in the offseason for two players who really aren't producing much, he clearly isn't as incompetent as he has seemed. I'll wait until the deadline to make a judgement on how he's doing."
phillies,39g2rd,TheSubversive,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:12:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he should start the bidding at their lowest rated prospect, cause that's a great way to negotiate.  That way you can complain about how he got ripped off instead of complaining about what he asked for.  I mean, you're gonna complain about Ruben either way right?  And Walker is 3-6 with a 5.40 ERA in 12 starts this season and 6-9 with a 4.27 ERA in 23 career games so he isn't looking like anything special.  For comparison that's just slightly better than Jerome Williams and slightly worse than Sean O'Sullivan this year.  It's June.  Prices for players should be high and they'll come down as it gets closer to the deadline."
phillies,39g2rd,TheSubversive,0,Thu Jun 11 20:10:05 2015 UTC,"This is how you become notirious for bad deals. You ask for too much and they become disinterested right away. Of they really wanted Revere, they wouldve negotiated, but they say how bad the deal Ruben wanted was"
phillies,39g2rd,Mulsanne,2,Thu Jun 11 20:25:20 2015 UTC,"Just an FYI, this is the rest of the quote from what was posted above, from MLBTradeRumors.com:  This early in the trade season, it makes sense for Amaro and other sellers to aim high when discussing players they’re not under any pressure to trade. However, a pitcher of Paxton or Walker’s caliber is clearly far too steep a price for Seattle. Dutton notes that the Mariners’ interest could pick back up if the Phillies lower their asking price, and I’d expect that to happen over the coming weeks."
phillies,39g2rd,Mulsanne,-1,Thu Jun 11 20:36:37 2015 UTC,but they say how bad the deal Ruben wanted was   Which you are so so so so sure was not just a negotiation tactic. You are 100% certain that Ruben is just fucking this deal up.   It's like you forgot about all the trades he's made in the last 12 months and how each and every one of them was good.
phillies,39g2rd,RicsFlair,0,Thu Jun 11 21:15:35 2015 UTC,"It's like you forgot about all the trades he's made in the last 12 months and how each and every one of them was good.   You do know how much better our team would be with Pence? Or if we traded him for good fucking players and not fuck up.   Also you want to talk about bad trades? How about not knowing when to trade Rollins. If we traded him a year or two ago we would get better returns. Ruben doesnt know when to do anything. Signs a 36 year old player to a 4 year contract instead of trading for better stuff. He doesnt know when to trade Hamels. Everyone knows we want to give him up so whats the point, theyll go after Cueto."
phillies,39g2rd,TheSwampDweller,2,Fri Jun 12 00:42:09 2015 UTC,"First of all ..   all the trades he's made in the last 12 months   Also, holy shit dude we got a great return for Rollins. Stop talking."
phillies,39g2rd,Mulsanne,-2,Fri Jun 12 00:48:32 2015 UTC,Yeah but we could have gotten more and given Galvis a shot.
phillies,39g2rd,Bohnanza,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:49:51 2015 UTC,"First of all, enough about the Pence trade.  Yes in retrospect it was terrible.  Considering what we gave up to acquire him.  But you completely dismiss that the cornerstone of that trade was Tommy Joseph.  A touted catching prospect who didn't pan out because of injuries that he sustained while playing in the Phillies farm system.  And you know what, that's why he was labeled a ""prospect"".  It's all a freaking crapshoot.  The idea is to acquire as many prospects as possible, to strengthen the percentage that one will pan out.  But they are never a sure thing.  Shit, this is even applies to some guys who made it to the majors (Mookie, Montero, Walker, just to name a few off the top of my head).  It's so freaking easy to point out how bad that trade was, and completely dismiss the fact that bad luck (and possibly poor coaching) is what hurt us in that trade.  Not necessarily the talent acquisition, although I think that we could have asked for something better than Rosen.  Rollins netted a very good return, considering his contract.  Even though I agree that the contract itself was drafted poorly (in terms of years), I think it was a miracle that we got what we did in return.  Eflin has great stuff, and has surprised everybody in Reading.  And don't count out Windle, as he looks like a decent piece for the back-end of a rotation.  I don't agree with that sentiment about Hamels either.  The writing is on the wall, and not much is really needed to be said.  You are also dismissing the fact that despite all the other poor contracts the organization drafted, Hamels' deal doesn't look too bad considering.  He's performing (KNOCK ON WOOD) well, and is locked in for awhile.  If pay his salary, there is no reason at all that we won't get a nice return.    I wanted to say more about Hamels, but I'm superstitious and I don't want to jinx anything."

Add to that the way some people act like they know more than Ruben, or even as much as him, is just ridiculous.

phillies,39ghvw,K20BB5,3,Thu Jun 11 20:10:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the south side of Walnut (where Penn Park currently sits) would have been the stadium, with shopping and entertainment development planned for the north side (in the footprint of Cira South).  Would have made for a nicer skyline view, but I believe it was always a long shot because of traffic issues and opposition from Penn and Drexel."

Who knows it how much it would of cost to build out the infrastructure around there to support all the traffic.    The only Center City site that made any sense was 13th and Vine.  I was in favor of it.  Chinatown was not.  And good for them for standing up and fighting it.    The unfortunate thing is that someone decided 50 years ago to put all the arenas in South Philly.  Nice idea, but people became conditioned to the ease driving to the games or taking the Broad Street line to the doorstep of the Vet or Spectrum."

Doubt that the Yankees would pay the salary for two closers, so the Phils would most likely have to eat the money.  And I wouldn't expect some elite prospects in return, but it might be win-win giving Dante Bichette a change of scenery.  Of course, only if the Yankees were to include an A level pitcher (I like Rookie Davis because of his name alone)."

phillies,39agmz,hakan_loob44,0,Wed Jun 10 20:07:27 2015 UTC,Yea I'm not impressed by a 22yr old college bat tearing up the Sally.  Tocci on the other hand it is nice to finally see some development.
phillies,39agmz,sjphilsphan,3,Wed Jun 10 17:01:10 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Hoskins should be promoted ASAP, 22 isn't unheard of for low A, and he's absolutely mashing with good patience."
phillies,39agmz,ihorsey,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:58:23 2015 UTC,I wish they'd send him to reading. But I guess Clearwater will do. Kyle Williams taking his place?
phillies,39c7jc,RiskyBryzness,9,Wed Jun 10 19:58:08 2015 UTC,Anyway we can trade him to the Angels for Mike Trout and a couple of pitching prospects?
phillies,39c7jc,haunthorror,4,Wed Jun 10 20:18:56 2015 UTC,Definitely.
phillies,39c7jc,ShittyBrain,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:52:58 2015 UTC,well he was right about it being time for Seattle to make a move
phillies,39c7jc,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:56:41 2015 UTC,"This is just a really bad article.  Honestly, this team isn't going anywhere until at least 2017 so why not just keep him around.  It's not like anyone is going to pick up his salary so we're going to send him and money (a lot of money) to someone and get no prospects back so it's essentially us paying him to play somewhere else.  He's not blocking anyone right now so that's not an issue.  If somehow, someway, someone was willing to pick up a decent portion of his salary and send us back something in return than yeah, do it.  But right now that's not gonna happen.  It's too far gone now.  Just keep him as a placeholder until we get good again then he''ll either be gone because his contracts up or trade him then because he'll be cheaper and you might get something."

phillies,396hhl,RiskyBryzness,7,Tue Jun 9 16:33:48 2015 UTC,Don't rush him. Hopefully he stays down there and his season ends with Lehigh Valley's. A September callup could be too many innings on his arm.
phillies,396hhl,ehrmantraut_,5,Tue Jun 9 17:30:50 2015 UTC,Agreed. No point of rushing him. Let him get his work in in the minors and see what he has in spring training.
phillies,396hhl,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,3,Tue Jun 9 19:48:21 2015 UTC,"It's not rushing him, IMO. He was considered the most MLB-ready product in the draft last year, the guy who should make it to the bigs first. He's dominating AA, it's time for him to move up."
phillies,396hhl,ehrmantraut_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"I should have phrased it better. I agree that he could be ready for MLB competition, I'm referring to innings pitched. His arm has never seen any type of workload similar to this."

They chose to build a pitching and defense team - I'm sure the fact that they play in Pac Bell factored into that. Just as their crop of + pitchers matures together, pull hitters are devalued league wide. Not only do they get Pence type players which it sounds like will be the new league model at a certain discount (because let's face, power hitters commanded the big bucks), they play in a park that magnifies the value of players in this mold."

phillies,396of3,haunthorror,3,Tue Jun 9 17:24:57 2015 UTC,I was on board with drafting talent above all else.  But I'm not even sure who this guy is.  I can't find anything on him.
phillies,396of3,pisstones,2,Tue Jun 9 17:25:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, our first pick is going to be put in the outfield"
phillies,396of3,haunthorror,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:28:06 2015 UTC,Does that mean Asche is moving to RF/1B or Galvis is being traded?
phillies,396of3,pisstones,6,Tue Jun 9 17:33:00 2015 UTC,No.  He is only 18 and is a prospect.  Needs a couple to several years in the minors.  Also Crawford will probably bump Galvis first.
phillies,396of3,Groty,3,Tue Jun 9 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"My bet is Galvis moving to 2B in the next year or two after Utley retires and Crawford becoming the everyday SS around 2016 or so. That cements half of our future core with Franco at 3B, Crawford at SS, Galvis at 2B, Asche at LF, and (you could make a case for) Revere at CF/RF."
phillies,396of3,pisstones,2,Tue Jun 9 17:40:01 2015 UTC,I think you're forgetting about the second basemen we drafted yesterday out of College.  He's expected to fast track to MLB.
phillies,396of3,haunthorror,3,Tue Jun 9 17:50:53 2015 UTC,"I didn't forget about him, but you can't expect him to develop by 2017."
phillies,396of3,pisstones,3,Tue Jun 9 17:52:41 2015 UTC,Roman Quinn will take Reveres spot at some point.  Plus they are shopping Revere in trades.
phillies,396of3,haunthorror,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:46:03 2015 UTC,Quinn's actually developing into a major leaguer?
phillies,396of3,haunthorror,5,Tue Jun 9 17:46:41 2015 UTC,Yes!  Having a great year in Reading.  Hitting just over 300 and leading the league in stolen bases I believe.  Also good fielder.
phillies,396of3,TheSubversive,3,Tue Jun 9 17:49:06 2015 UTC,27 stolen bases so far.  302 average.
phillies,396of3,scootypuffjr33,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:49:51 2015 UTC,Quinn always been very promising.  He's had injury problems but when he's on the field and healthy he's consistently looked great.
phillies,396of3,pisstones,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:48:25 2015 UTC,"If Galvis is our everyday 2B in 2016, I will not be able to watch the games."
phillies,396of3,metssuck,2,Tue Jun 9 21:03:03 2015 UTC,"He's above replacement level for his defense alone. It's 2B, the weakest position of all time. We don't need the second coming of Utley to be successful."
phillies,396of3,ChiantiAndFavaBeans,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:09:27 2015 UTC,I highly doubt Galvis is still with the team by the time any of the hitters from today's draft get to the majors
phillies,396of3,metssuck,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:49:31 2015 UTC,"I bet he will be. We're not going to play the guessing game about when new draft picks will be ready, so we'll sign Galvis to a medium length deal unelss we can secure a better FA 2B for cheaper - which doesn't make sense since we don't plan on competing next year."

phillies,397gvp,Jayyburdd,2,Tue Jun 9 21:03:54 2015 UTC,"Well, yes it is.  You never see an entire team of only homegrown players.  You did say primarily though so there's that.  And we're not talking about the Astros here, the Phillies have money and they'll spend it.  Franco, Crawford, Nola and maybe Quinn will be on this team but most likely none of the other guys listed, at least not as starters and especially if they all don't step it up a bit."
phillies,397gvp,TheSubversive,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:54:56 2015 UTC,"The cubs could feasibly do it. But you're right. With the phillies payroll, they won't have to wait on the pharm system. Just go to free agency to fill remaining holes."
phillies,397gvp,ihorsey,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:12:22 2015 UTC,"The Cubs either focused entirely on hitters or just sucked at drafting pitchers.  I don't know enough about them to know which it is but I do know that they look pretty good but are in 3rd place in their division, so there's that.  And what's weird with them is that they have more money than us, probably more than everyone but Dodgers, Yankees and Boston, but they're not spending.  They got burned pretty badly in the 2000's by spending on players so they're most likely gun shy.  I don't know how much they have left in their system as most of those guys are up with the big league club but they're a team that could HUGELY benefit from a Cole Hamels.  They won't though because their GM, for good or bad, values the prospects more than the value of a Hamels.  I think the Royals and the Astros are probably the closest you'll find of a club doing it solely in-house.  And the Rays are up there too."
phillies,397gvp,TheSubversive,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:49:43 2015 UTC,We'll everyone on the cubs is either a rook or still in the minors. I think they'll wait a couple years before spending. Although they did grab Lester this offseason. I forgot about the rays they're a good example. I just used the cubs because they have a superstar potential player at EVERY position. It's crazy.
phillies,397gvp,ihorsey,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:19:27 2015 UTC,Yeah.  I actually like the Cubs while the Phillies suck.  They're a fun team to watch.  Do they still have some guys in their system?  I'd love it if they were open to using some if they did in a Hamels deal.

phillies,397gvp,TheSubversive,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:55:44 2015 UTC,Dugan literally could be the best hitter in the minors when healthy. Power and on base skills are all there.  Hopefully he gets back soon.
phillies,397gvp,ihorsey,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:19:15 2015 UTC,I'd sub in Dugan in right field as long as he's healthy. Hoskins at first. Tocci could edge out Quinn in center as well. Quinn would be an excellent 4th outfielder/pinch runner/ emergency infielder/ defensive sub etc.
phillies,397gvp,ihorsey,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:21:58 2015 UTC,Quinn reminds me a lot of a Michael Bourn when he was in the minor league system here.

I'd like to see Crawford up next year starting sometime.  I remember they brought up Rollins pretty fast and he became the greatest SS in franchise history so I don't think there is a problem pushing Crawford especially when he keeps hitting at every level."

Galvis would move to 2B, Chase to maybe 1st, and leave Howard in the woods somewhere. Well, in all seriousness, Freddy to 2B seems the best option at this point if Crawford were ready tomorrow."
phillies,393ywv,ToTheBlack,2,Tue Jun 9 16:25:45 2015 UTC,"I don't want to be an asshole but I feel the need to point something out.  Bringing Crawford or Nola or another rookie up isn't about when they're ready right now.  Nola has probably been ready since we drafted him.  It's about timing and money.  This current team that we're fielding isn't competitive and Nola or Lively isn't going to help that.  You don't want to bring anybody up unless you have to because once you do you are starting their Major League service time clock and the longer that clock runs the more expensive the player gets.  Timing is the name of the game.  You want to time it so that you are bringing guys up and getting them experience just prior to when you think your MLB club will be competitive.  That way you have them under financial team control through a competitive period and you're getting the most value for your dollar as well as leaving more money to pick up free agents that will help you be even more competitive.  Rollins was the guy they brought up to get experience before they were competitive, like right before.  He was a leader and because of that he served as a bridge between the guys he knew and played with in the minors and the guys he was playing with and now knew on the MLB team.  There is no doubt in my mind he helped show guys like Utley and Howard and Hamels the ropes as a major leaguer and greatly eased their transition; and this was all premeditated by the organization and it worked brilliantly.  ""Then why did they bring Franco up so early""  They needed to.  They needed to give fans a reason to watch and buy tickets (which they certainly have) and he needed to start getting himself ready.  They did however wait until the cutoff point for him to be able to be a Super Two though so they didn't cost themselves any extra time.  And for all we know he could be playing the Rollins role this time around although they are a bit further from being competitive.  Sorry if that came off wrong."

But reading about this kid and watching some tape it's clear he's a hitter.  The number one need on this team is a bat. Everything I read says Randolph profiles as a 3B. At 18 he has plenty of time to grow and it'll likely be quite a few years until we see him in the major leagues.  It appears we've hit on our last two top picks (Crawford and Nola) so I'm more than willing to give the benefit of the doubt to our scouts on this kid.  Bonus - Cornelius Randolph is undoubtedly the best name in the draft.  EDIT - Phillies director of scouting says Randolph will be moved to LF. Interesting."

phillies,393hny,stephenbawesome,14,Tue Jun 9 15:36:27 2015 UTC,Is this a reach? Most draft boards had him outside the top 10.
phillies,393hny,RunnitBack,11,Tue Jun 9 00:09:25 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say a reach.  Some scouts rate players differently and have boards set up differently.  Keith Law had Randolph 29 and Jim Bowden on ESPN had Randolph 12.  Kiley McDaniels on Fangraphs had him 11.  I guess it's just if you felt he was your guy then take him.  Especially in what scouts are saying is a weaker draft and a bunch of players have huge ranges for where they could be picked.
phillies,393hny,smiller121,6,Tue Jun 9 00:39:00 2015 UTC,Law also said he thinks Randolph might be the best pure hitter in the draft. 18 year old without a position though. Phils said they'd move him to OF.
phillies,393hny,Ship_of_Fools26,3,Tue Jun 9 01:26:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah makes sense to move him to OF.  Shouldn't be a problem, like you said, scouts think his bat will play fine in the OF.  Wouldn't mind seeing if he could stick at third though, in case Franco needs to move to first eventually (which I don't think will be necessary).  It'll be interested to see if the move to the OF is because the Phillies feel that Randolph will be a quick mover like Crawford.  His advanced hit tool for a prep definitely makes that possible."
phillies,393hny,smiller121,2,Tue Jun 9 01:32:17 2015 UTC,without a position though   He's a high school shortstop which means he has a position in pro ball - any of them except catcher or pitcher...and even sometimes it is pitcher.

Outside of the top 3-5 the rest of the top 20-25 is pretty interchangeable.  In football you're draft pick is expected to contribute immediately so it's easier to evaluate how that pick fits and how they'll do.  In baseball this guy won't see the Majors for 3-5 years, at least.  He's what, 18?  It's nearly impossible to judge where he''ll be at 23."

phillies,39450h,RunnitBack,5,Tue Jun 9 03:12:17 2015 UTC,Franco - Crawford - Kingery - 1B?  Liking how this infield potentially comes together.  I think we picked a ton of value here. A number of mock drafts had Kingery going in the 1st round - Keith Law had him as high as 26 to the LAA.
phillies,39450h,sjphilsphan,3,Tue Jun 9 03:21:01 2015 UTC,Hoskins for 1B

They have at least 3 valuable trade chips in Hamels, Harang and Papelbon so expect a decent piece or two there.  Plus they're picking 10 this year which is a decent spot to pick although not a gimmie at all.  But, it looks like they'll pick top 3 next year which carries a great degree of certainty that you'll get an exceptional talent.  And once Howard, Hamels, Lee and Utley are off the books they'll be flush (like REALLY flush) with cash.  Those four are about $70M a year.  They'll have plenty of dough to fill in the holes.  People love to complain but it's not that bad.  They could be competitive again in 2-3 years and the young guys will be fun to watch, like Franco is now."

That said, Jerome Williams has struggled mightily (9th worst ERA in the league even before today's game) and replacing him at some point isn't the worst idea. I guess there's a number of factors at play: Is Jeanmar stretched out? Is it worth flipping them back and forth and modifying rhythm? Is there really nobody we can pull from Lehigh Valley instead of giving innings to Jeanmar? He's having success in the 'pen right now, and I don't think they're going to want to mess with that; Williams will likely get replaced if his ERA doesn't start to come down at least a little, but I don't see it being him. Not a bad thought if we were contending, but....well."

phillies,38lk14,shoresfront,7,Fri Jun 5 00:20:09 2015 UTC,The rule doesn't even matter. It was a force play. Chooch should've been aware enough to know there was no need for a tag. Awful play on his part.
phillies,38lk14,TheMightyCatatafish,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:25:52 2015 UTC,Totally agree with you there. I don't know whether he was caught off guard by the throw (which was incredibly heads up by Galvis with the pitcher coming home) or if chooch just wasn't thinking. I just didn't like the implementation of the rule on a play where the runner was going to be out by the tag even if he had a clear path.
phillies,38lk14,NooclearWessel,5,Fri Jun 5 15:39:40 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think that rule was even applicable in this circumstance. You ARE allowed to block the plate if you have the ball. Chooch had the ball when the runner was sliding into the plate.  Had he not gotten the ball and stayed where he was, yes that would be illegal. But that's not what happened. The fact that he was in front of the plate before the runner got there doesn't really matter for this rule."
phillies,38lk14,NooclearWessel,2,Fri Jun 5 01:27:54 2015 UTC,"The fact that none of it was even necessary being a force play, however, just makes me sad."

Close to the action and it's a great view- only drawback being you can't see the jumbotron. Don't leave without eating a schmitter (conveniently available in left field). You can buy tickets on stub hub of course but you could also purchase at the ticket window before the game - they will work with you on price/section/row availability.  Not much to do in the immediate vicinity aside from xfinity which is a big sports bar where you can eat and drink before and or after the game. There's also a mcfaddens in CBP.   Enjoy.

Now, if you want to see something interesting and approach it with an open mind look at this:  http://www.baseball-reference.com/draft/?overall_pick=24&draft_type=junreg&  That's the history for pick 24.  A team gets pick 24 by being fairly good and when you've been fairly good for a decent stretch, like 5 division titles in a row and 2 League Championships (the number 29 pick) and 1 WS (the 30 pick), this is typically what type of player you get.  So for all of you complaining about the lack of talent to come out of the Phillies farm system over the past decade when they were on a massive string of Major League success you should see what the talent level looks like late in the draft.  You want Bryce Harper and Stephen Strasburg?  You want Kris Bryant?  You get them by being really fucking bad...for a long time."

Like I've said before, I know but only because I've done the research but most fans have no idea how different it it to pick at 5 and pick at even 15.

A lot of what i saw when he first came up was him anxious at the plate and swinging early.  It was as if he was trying to justify his promotion.  But lately he's been patient and staying back on the ball and squaring it up and it's pretty fucking fun to watch.  It's funny, as good as Franco can be I don't think he'll ever be like the '06-'09 Howard who could seemingly just put the entire team on his back for 2-3 month stretches and carry them to victory.

Carwford will most likely be ready for the show by 2017-2018, so we have to figure out if Gavis will be part of our future of if he is just keeping the seat warm for Crawford."

phillies,38d8fi,ihorsey,2,Wed Jun 3 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with just about everything you say.    Honestly, I'm not expecting much from Cody Asche.  If he can level out to a .250 hitter who hits 20 homeruns, I'd be happy.  I thing that is a fair assessment of the player he is.  I'm glad he is no longer playing third, and Miakel Franco is freaking joy to watch.  I'm not a huge fan of Hamels curve, but am okay with it if he throws it 10% of the time.  It's got okay bite, but does hang a bit.  I do like it a better than the flat cutter he used to throw during the Halladay years.    I'm excited for the draft as well.  I'm pleased with the organizations picks in the last couple of years, and am very enthused and interested to see who Almaraz and company pick at 10."
phillies,38d8fi,RicsFlair,2,Wed Jun 3 14:31:17 2015 UTC,If Asche can play good defense in left and average .275 with 15 HRs I would be content.  The Phillies have so many holes that it would be nice not to worry LF for a few years.
phillies,38d8fi,deadnside,2,Wed Jun 3 14:36:40 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm hoping he can turn into something like an Alex Gordon - who I think also made the transition from third to LF (and struggled with consistency his first few years in the majors). High .260's batting average with 15-20 home runs and a decent number of doubles would be fine with me."
phillies,38d8fi,poopfeast,4,Wed Jun 3 16:01:54 2015 UTC,I think Alex Gordon is shooting very high and probably impossible for Asche.  Alex Gordon is probably the single best defensive OF'er in baseball.  I'd be happy if Asche was an average regular.
phillies,38d8fi,RicsFlair,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:10:49 2015 UTC,Alex Gordon is definitely shooting high.  How about Pat-The-Bat?  ...I jest.  There is only one machine.
phillies,38d8fi,poopfeast,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"I was mostly talking about in terms of offense, I don't think .260 - .275 with 15 home runs is unrealistic at all. Defensively I expect him to be average at best."
phillies,38d8fi,klombo120,2,Wed Jun 3 20:01:19 2015 UTC,The thing about that curve is that it's different for him and he's using it as an out pitch.  Think back about before he started using it and how high his pitch counts would get due to foul balls.  That curve has all but eliminated that.
phillies,38d8fi,sjphilsphan,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:12:30 2015 UTC,Asche reminds me of a younger jayson werth. Slightly above average player who is great for a team.

One of the best pitchers of this generation was in love with him because of the game he called and how he handled the pitchers.  It would be like critiquing Utley because he doesn't run hard. It's just so blatantly wrong.

Refusing to root for someone who was instrumental to the best stretch of Phillies history, ever, because he's a shadow of his former self, despite whether he's hitting better now and increasing his trade value or not... Making fun of others and their entirely realistic hopes for Asche to become a regular every day player... Not being able to subtract 5 from a number...   Keep your ""delusional"" entirely realistic and fair assessment of what's important to watch for about the Phils right now.

Interleague and the World Series are enough.   The A's are my secondary team, because they're from Philly. Unfortunately both of my teams are awful right now."
phillies,38ic8g,toddrob,2,Thu Jun 4 12:36:10 2015 UTC,"I do prefer the national league game but a rivalry with the yankees would be alot of fun. The A's have a much better history than the phillies.. more championships, less racism. I dunno which id prefer"
phillies,38ic8g,davelevenson,8,Thu Jun 4 12:46:08 2015 UTC,"I don't wish for the Phils to have left instead of the A's, but I'd LOVE to see the A's come back.    Philadelphia is the largest tv market to only have 1 professional organization per sport and there's no reason that can't change. Imagine seeing a new citizens bank park quality stadium downtown or along the waterfront (after all the bs of almost getting one 10+ years ago). Another pro baseball team would invigorate the local economy, put Philadelphia back in the national spotlight, and there would be AL teams coming here that would typically only visit every 4 years. Subway Series, pssh please...Septa Series!    There was a growing movement for the A's to come back a few years back, I don't think their facebook has been as popular lately though."

phillies,38ic8g,flyersfan314,3,Thu Jun 4 14:35:59 2015 UTC,"Yes! They were the more popular team in our fare city for the first half century. The Phils were a bottom tier team even back then. They actually went to Kansas City first. Then on to Oakland. Also, my 1943 All Star game throw back Philly A's cap is pretty amazing. Love the Phils but the A's would have been better for us fans."
phillies,38ic8g,phillywill,5,Thu Jun 4 20:34:27 2015 UTC,"you know, as a younger fan, I don't think I'd trade my experience with the Phillies for anything. From 2006 even through 2012, I don't know if there was a more exciting team to be a fan of. A home run mashing, never-say-die team for the first half of that, an elite pitching staff that could sweep you with 3 shutouts for the second half. I don't think it has anything to do with the status quo. I have pride in this team and what they accomplished while I've watched them, and I'm glad I've grown up a Phillies fan not an A's fan."

phillies,385w19,ihorsey,0,Tue Jun 2 23:18:46 2015 UTC,Been working 3rd shift and haven't been able to keep up w/the news.  Asche is being re-called?  So it took him like a month to learn how to play LF?  And he couldn't do that at the major league level?  This makes no sense.  I wish Ruben would explain this to me.
phillies,385w19,BurnedOut_ITGuy,4,Tue Jun 2 23:20:23 2015 UTC,It makes sense. Sizemore might not be the player he used to be (a 5 tool guy) but he can still field well. It makes sense to send Asche down for a little bit until he gets a feel for left field.
phillies,385w19,DanceFactory,6,Wed Jun 3 00:27:24 2015 UTC,"Can we stop killing Amaro for every single move he makes (it's not like there aren't plenty of actual bad moves to kill him for).  At the time, Asche was in a major slump and it was probably best for him to learn a new position out of the limelight."
phillies,385w19,deadnside,3,Tue Jun 2 09:24:12 2015 UTC,"This team sucks, there was no reason to throw Asche into an unfamiliar position in front of a major league stadium. Get adjusted at the minor league level, get some confidence, come back up to the majors and get consistent playing time. This situation was actually handled pretty well by Amaro, although I wish Asche could have gotten more work in the OF during spring training"
phillies,385w19,hmpsnj,3,Tue Jun 2 15:49:34 2015 UTC,"He didn't have a position at the major league level. For a rebuilding team, you hope Sizemore and/or Francoeur show you something and you move them for either a low level prospect or minor league wild card. Asche will have plenty of time for at bats this year, but at least he got his feet wet in LF at AAA where he could play every day."

Hannibal Lecter, a psychotic, would almost certainly have been prescribed a type of medication call a MAOI. Because of a certain acid that's in high concentrations in Chianti, Fava beans, and liver, someone taking MAOIs can't eat those things. As a psychologist himself, Lecter would have known this. That line, in addition to just being creepy as fuck, is him admitting that he hasn't taken his medication.  Edit: CAN'T eat those things."

If they accept that he's done, I think 2017 they could be in a race and 2018 could get a wild card spot.  If we have to wait for the contract to be over, then it's probably more like 2019-2020."

They check tickets only at entrance to the park and at entrance to the actual seat sections.  The concourses are free to walk as much as you want.  Now, if you are really a baseball fan and really dig the history you are going to want to buy Hall of Fame Club tickets.  This is not open to the general public.  It has some really nice memorabilia and other fun baseball history things.  There is also the added benefit of some food stands that you would otherwise have to wait in a very long line for, like Chickie's and Pete's Fries.  Try a Schmitter too (3rd base gate).  Beer Garden (RF Gate near Bulls BBQ).  Hot cinnamon pecans and walnuts (at 1st and 3rd on 100 level).  Fresh Squeezed lemonade (near the nuts stands).    Have fun."

With open concourses you can pretty much keep tabs on the game.
phillies,385hme,metssuck,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:12:34 2015 UTC,I agree with most of the article except that Howard was overrated in his prime. Yes his contract is ridiculous but in his prime he was one of if not the best slugger in baseball. Wasn't he the quickest to 300 HRs ever? Amaro is just a joke for extending him with two years left on his contract.   Edit: second quickest behind hall of famer Ralph Kiner.

phillies,37t2hk,ataristick,8,Sat May 30 04:05:24 2015 UTC,Wonder if the oblique injury is the reason he's hit for little power. Either way very exciting. Maybe Roman starts hitting again with His buddy JP.
phillies,37t2hk,ihorsey,5,Sat May 30 04:33:27 2015 UTC,"The oblique is probably the problem.  Fangraphs had an article on Jason Kipnis (who had the injury last year) and it talked about how it's a weird injury.  It doesn't need surgery and it's usually only 4-6 weeks but it can linger.  For some players like Kipnis, it can mess up everything about batting.  For others like Joe Mauer (who had it last year or the year before) it saps all power, but doesn't really change your swing.  So the oblique strain is probably part of the reason."
phillies,37t2hk,smiller121,2,Sat May 30 04:42:19 2015 UTC,"There's no reason to shake a fist at a guy with an obp of nearly 500. If he profiles like this, he won't need any power. Tremendous bat to ball skill with good command of the zone plus elite defense makes for a great player. No power needed"
phillies,37t2hk,Mulsanne,2,Sat May 30 15:07:02 2015 UTC,"Can't maintain an OBP that high without power though, plate discipline doesn't matter if pitchers aren't afraid to challenge you. It's a moot point though because Crawford has the power tool, it just isn't showing up in this small sample, possibly because of the oblique."
phillies,37t2hk,drwhosonfirst,2,Sat May 30 20:34:56 2015 UTC,What's confusing about this statement? I mean it's still helpful to have good plate discipline but you're not going to walk a bunch if pitchers aren't afraid to throw you the ball over the plate.
phillies,37t2hk,drwhosonfirst,1 point,Sat May 30 20:49:36 2015 UTC,He does have power though. But yeah I guess if he could maintain a .500 obp he wouldn't need it.

phillies,37t2hk,DanceFactory,2,Sat May 30 05:20:37 2015 UTC,No doubt but it should be substantial return because he's an excellent defender and under team control until 2019. Even if he can be an average hitter he'll be significantly above replacement level.
phillies,37t2hk,Jayyburdd,-6,Sat May 30 09:29:54 2015 UTC,What is with your hard on for Freddy Galvis? I looked through your history and you seem to love the guy.

phillies,37t2hk,TheSubversive,-4,Sat May 30 15:38:03 2015 UTC,"I wanted to see if his circlejerk over Galvis extended to other threads, and I wasn't wrong."
phillies,37t2hk,sokrazyitmightwork,6,Sat May 30 15:56:07 2015 UTC,No big deal really.  He's a player who's taken his career seriously and he's improved because of it. No one seems willing to give the guy any credit at all which is fucked up for people who call themselves Phillies fans. It's like everyone wants him to fail so they can be right about what they said earlier.    If you're a Phillies fan why are you so against him?
phillies,37t2hk,DanceFactory,1 point,Sat May 30 15:57:56 2015 UTC,"He's just another player in a long roster of average to below average players that are putting up dismal numbers   If you think his numbers are dismal, then you are gonna be disappointed by most players in the league.  Edit - whoops i replied to you instead of the next guy my b."
phillies,37t2hk,DanceFactory,-4,Sat May 30 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Because he's awful and I don't subscribe to the idea of liking somebody just because he's on my favorite team.   But your problem is that you make blanket statements like ""he's taken his career seriously"" as if every professional athlete doesn't take their career seriously. As if, because he cares about his job, we should give him credit for that. He's just another player in a long roster of average to below average players that are putting up dismal numbers and further cementing the Phillies as the worst team in baseball with no clear end in sight.   Don't get me wrong, I hope these changes that he's made really do transpire into him becoming a good hitter. But the first month of the season is much too small of a sample size to go by and he's hitting absolutely terribly in the last few weeks. Defending a player that is so mediocre seems pointless to me. His defense is great I will give him that, but he's the current problem with this Phillies team. A bunch of no-name players that are good enough to play at the major league level but can't do anything more than that. RAJ seems to be okay with that."
phillies,37t2hk,TheSubversive,-1,Sun May 31 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"No chance he's producing like this. He's a shitty player that got hot, as noted by his average that has dropped like 70 points over the last few weeks.   Edit: Why am I getting downvoted for this? I realize we are at rock bottom for this current Phillies team, but lets not kid ourselves into thinking Freddy fucking Galvis is a good hitter. His career numbers say he'll hit around .240 with almost nothing to offer in terms of power or stolen bases. This is baseball, the streakiest sport there is. Galvis had a great start to the season but has been regressing heavily for the last 2 weeks hitting a lowly .160."
phillies,37t2hk,DanceFactory,2,Sat May 30 17:06:23 2015 UTC,Like you know. He won't hit .350 all year but he can definitely be .275-.300.
phillies,37t2hk,TheSubversive,3,Sat May 30 12:14:58 2015 UTC,"You actually believe that? He hasn't even come close to hitting .275 in his entire career. Even in the minor leagues his numbers were just as bad. He's an awful hitter.   Obviously I don't know what he'll end up hitting, but baseball is a statistics heavy sport and predictions like this are generally easy to make."
phillies,37t2hk,ObligatoryHandle,2,Sat May 30 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"I believe, and it happens frequently, that players can make adjustments, improve and figure things out.  They can change their approach and take coaching and improve their game as a result and this happens a lot.  Freddy was plucked from the minors a lot earlier than he should have been (out of necessity) and he was not nearly fully developed.  He's done a lot of positive work since then, including working very closely with one of the greatest hitters ever in Mike Schmidt, and I beleive he's improved because of it."
phillies,37t2hk,BobbyD84,1 point,Sat May 30 14:25:54 2015 UTC,"I'm with the group that is excited that Galvis got hot at the plate, but you're not wrong. He had one good year as a hitter in his entire career. He still only hit .278 that year, in the minors. He did have the best XBH totals of his life, but then got popped for PEDs the next season. It makes his 2011 totals look like a pipe dream. The recent slump just reenforces your negative outlook on Galvis."

phillies,37sft8,chukinthebuket,14,Sat May 30 00:43:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar enough (nor lived through) the 1976-83 run, but watching the 2007-11 teams, you had a feeling that there was a chance that they could win every. single. game, no matter the score or inning when you turned on the TV. I don't know if the 1976 era team had that going for them."
phillies,37sft8,dfuller,10,Sat May 30 00:50:21 2015 UTC,"Looking at the starting lineups from each championship year.  Opinion only.    Pete Rose vs Jimmy Rollins. Rose  Manny Trillo vs Shane Victorino, Victorino  Mike Schmidt vs Chase Utley, love Utley but Schmidt  Greg Luzinski vs Ryan Howard.  Howard  Gary Maddox vs Jayson Werth, Werth  Bake McBride vs Pat Burrell. Burrell  Bob Boone vs Pedro Feliz, boone  Larry Bowa vs Carlos Ruiz, Ruiz   By position winner only.  SP  Carlton C    Boone 1st  Rose 2nd Utley 3rd. Schmidt SS.  Rollins LF.   Burrell CF.  Maddox RF.  Werth  It would be one hell of a game but I would give it to the 80 Phils based upon the amount of lefty batters and the utter domination of Carlton."
phillies,37sft8,lvs2wtch,6,Sat May 30 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"You gotta go position by position there, but Werth over Maddox? I'd have to think about that one. Also.... gotta go Del Unser in there somewhere off the bench. Also, Tugger all the way on closer.  Over all, I'd give the nod to '08 though."
phillies,37sft8,LearningLifeAsIGo,5,Sat May 30 03:02:29 2015 UTC,Werth was a better batter. That's why I picked him in the batting order.  Defense by far was Maddox which is why he beat Victorino.  Don't forget the problems the '08 team had a problem with lefty pitchers.  Carlton would have turned that team inside out.
phillies,37sft8,lvs2wtch,1 point,Sat May 30 03:18:27 2015 UTC,"Unser over '08 Greg Dobbs?  That was one awesome year off the bench.  And Lidges's '08 was pretty spectacular as well.  Overall, yeah Unser and Tug, but if you're looking at just '08 it's tough."

He's been better at the plate so far over his career, just won't have the longevity of Boone.

phillies,37t7v5,rogue09,3,Sat May 30 04:58:42 2015 UTC,"If you're driving, tailgating is a must, especially on a Saturday. Philly does tailgating right.  Personally, I prefer Campo's cheesesteaks and I'm not a huge crab fry guy but it's worth getting them at least once (and you definitely need to get the cheese on the side too). Usually the sausage smells too good for me to pass up so I end up getting that. It's a bit cheaper than the sandwiches at Bulls which will run you like $10 at least (I think).  CBP is a beautiful park and you have a view of the game pretty much anywhere. Take some time to walk around the park and check out the different perspectives.  Oh, and xfinity live is a giant waste of money. Basically ballpark prices for everything. If you want to go out after the game (and if you didn't drive) take the broad street line into center city. Philly has an amazing bar and restaurant scene, too many good ones to name (usually I go up around market east to places like Time and Bar). Yelp comes in handy often. And if you go out you need to get a pickleback shot.  I know Philly gets a bad rap sometimes but there's a ton of cool stuff to do. I live in west Philly but the center city/old city area is probably where you'll want to look around. I just went to the spruce street harbor park and I would recommend it. Old city is definitely worth checking out for the history alone. I'd also encourage you to head over to the r/Philadelphia sub to check out other events and recommendations from people who know better than myself what to do around here.  I hope you and your wife enjoy your time here. Philly is a great city and a lot of fun, and citizens bank park continues to be one of my favorite places to see a game (only rivaled by Camden yards). Hopefully you'll get some good baseball to watch as well."

phillies,37quk8,Halfonion,4,Fri May 29 17:44:56 2015 UTC,The only way he can fuck this one up is if he doesn't trade him at all.
phillies,37quk8,Charmanderp7,3,Fri May 29 17:58:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Moving him over the winter, with the offers that were on the table, would have been fucking it up.   Think about it this way: Hamels is the second or third best home grown pitcher the Phillies have ever had. We're not going to develop a pitcher internally this good for a number of years. The return that we need, NEED, to get for him must be franchise-trajectory altering. I, personally, think we should be paying a HUGE portion of his salary to increase the return, and demand nothing less than Swihart or Judge AND OTHERS. We're not going to be any good by the time his contract is up, so continuing to pay his salary won't be depleting money we'd be spending elsewhere on FAs."
phillies,37quk8,envriogis,1 point,Fri May 29 18:18:04 2015 UTC,"We need to trade him. Our farm system is weak and he is in his prime. As much as I love Cole, its for the best if we part ways with him in return for prospects. Also if Amaro fucks this up, hell will unless in Philly"
phillies,37quk8,TheSubversive,3,Fri May 29 18:39:27 2015 UTC,The Phillies need to trade him but only for a proper return.
phillies,37quk8,Halfonion,2,Fri May 29 18:46:54 2015 UTC,"Oh I definitely agree about that. I don't believe for one second that Amaro REALLY thinks he'll be at the top of the rotation when we're competitive again. I just agree with Lawerence that everyone in the sports journalism world, who were all going on and on about how stupid he was for not moving him over the winter for a shitty return, all had their heads up their asses."
phillies,37quk8,Halfonion,-1,Fri May 29 18:47:58 2015 UTC,"We don't need to trade him. We need to get an excellent return on him and if that means holding out for the best possible offer than that's what we should do.  The idea that we should just trade him quickly is idiotic.  Last year we didn't get what we wanted so we held out and that's an excellent move that only strengthens our position this year.  Teams know that we're not fucking around - come correct or don't come.   Cole could have helped the Dodgers, the Cardinals, the Royals or any number of teams last year.  They didn't want to part with whomever so they went home empty handed.  See if they want to lose out again."

phillies,37quk8,TheSubversive,2,Fri May 29 21:33:02 2015 UTC,No one ever said anything about keeping him longer than this trade deadline. Not sure where your getting that from.

So, yes, I disagree with you saying ""trade him now."" That is not the same thing as ""keep him another year."" Pretty big gap between the two, actually."
phillies,37quk8,mcorcoran3,2,Sat May 30 08:38:08 2015 UTC,"Why is Amaro's asking price ridiculous? Every rumor I've seen is that no team is willing to give up even one top end prospect. If no one is willing to include that, you don't come down off your asking price of 3. They have to agree to one, then you come back at 2 and settle with one top end and 2-4 lesser prospects."
phillies,37nkvc,DylanR_CC,11,Thu May 28 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"Now look at almost every other team in baseball and you'll see close to the same thing, especially with teams that were doing as well as the Phillies during those years and picking late in the draft.  There is a massive difference in talent in picking in the top 10 and picking after that.  There are 30 MLB teams and I can tell you for a fact that 30 superstars don't enter the league every year.  30 average MLB players don't enter the league every year.  The Phillies hit pretty big on Rollins, Utley, Howard, Hamels, Ruiz, Burrell, and Madson.  Then they hit on Victorino in the Rule 5 and Werth as an amateur free agent.  Most teams don't hit that well on that many in 30 years let alone the 15 the Phillies did it in.  I swear to god almost every time you prove him right."
phillies,37nkvc,TheSubversive,3,Fri May 29 02:38:59 2015 UTC,"I agree not every first round pick isgoing to be a hit or even make it to the majors as a league average player. They are called prospects for a reason, but the problem isn't just the first round picks with the Phillies. The problem is over this same time frame the entire farm system was failing to put out depth or even an occasional stud here or there. We could hardly get any bullpen arms out of the system for several straight years and there was little to no upside corner outfielders or starting pitchers emerging.  You aren't going to nail all your first rounders, but you need to produce something out of every draft class whether that be contributors or even trading pieces and occasionally put out some talented MLB starters or even platoon players.   The truth is the system produced a nice crop with the likes of Rollins, Utley, Howard and Hamels over a decade ago. The problem was that we weren't generating additional talent to supplement this group, instead we mortgaging those picks and talent for established MLB starters from other clubs. This was successful strategy for awhile and we got a world series out of it, but the rebuild didn't transition well and we waited to long to start it. Shit at this point the fact that only Rollins has been moved is a joke. Papelbon, Utley and Hamels needed to be dealt as does Howard. Hopefully we get something for them but the fact of the matter is until the farm system is strong again we have a long time to go before we are contenders again."
phillies,37nkvc,ExileInCle19,1 point,Fri May 29 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"the fact of the matter is until the farm system is strong again   I think the farm system looks pretty good right now.  And I think that'll be reflected in the next round of rankings.  There were some question marks like Quinn and the new pitchers and they've answered them.  And don't put too much into the National Farm Rankings anyway, a lot of that is PR based.  In fact, the Phillies farm system was very highly rated in the mid 2000's and that's most of the guys who didn't pan out like Donald, Marson, Drabek, etc...   you need to produce something out of every draft class   And yeah, you do need to hit on some picks.  You can't blame the organization for Brown though, he should have been at least an above average player and he was a top rated prospect so a lot of people got that one wrong.  And Biddle kind of did himself in but I still think he'll pull out of it.  And Drabek was another one a lot of people were wrong about.  My point is, it happens.  It happens a lot to a lot of teams.  The Phillies are not unique at all in not hitting on anything in their system.  A lot of people think the Red Sox are a top notch organization but who have they produced in the last 10 years?  And almost every one of their touted prospects is either not what was expected or floundering so far in the majors.  And I think we can count Galvis as at least a solid regular.  Giles is another with a ton of potential.  Asche has a shot a being an average player. And the trade for Revere should count as scouting a regular.  Worley is another solid average player.  And they scouted and drafted and somewhat developed Cosart.  There are guys that you can attribute to this system.  They may not be here but they were scouted and developed here.  It's not a vapid wasteland.   we have a long time to go before we are contenders again.   I thoroughly disagree that we have along way to go to contend again.  In fact, if we can swing the right deal for Hamels and Harang and Ruiz we'll be there sooner than most think.  And maybe that's why a lot of these guys are still here, like you complain about, because we're not getting the right offers.   Papelbon, Utley and Hamels needed to be dealt as does Howard.   Papelbon is untradeable because of his attitude primarily but also a bit because of his contract.  I'm sure they tried but didn't get an offer they felt was good enough.  So they'll hold on to him and try again this year and maybe find someone more desperate.    Utley is here to show the young guys how to play and I full on agree with keeping him on as a role model; he's got more value as that than what we could get back for him.  And I would rather keep Hamels than trade him for shit and god knows you guys would have a crying fit if he didn't get something substantial back; teams know we mean business with him and that's great.  Howard had zero value and if he continues to hit we can at least get financial relief in a deal with him.  If holding out on deals nets us anything like holding out on Rollins and Byrd did then it is unequivocally the right way to go.  There's no rush to get rid of guys for bullshit prospects.  Almost no matter what you say I can show you another absolutely valid point of view.  This isn't black and white and things aren't as bad as people make it out to be."
phillies,37nkvc,TheSubversive,1 point,Fri May 29 03:41:12 2015 UTC,"Phenomenal argument.  Still don't know how much faith I have in RAJ. But I can tell you that this last year has definitely boosted my confidence in him. Alongside of the emerging stardom of Nola and Crawford.  I can easily see Galvis flopping later in the season as teams scout him like Dom Brown did although he is less susceptible to that because he's a contact hitter not a power hitter. But all in all, I think what you have presented is at least reason to trust in the Phillies ownership in their decision to keep RAJ and allow him to keep retooling the team. At least for this and the following year."
phillies,37nkvc,thebigthunk,2,Fri May 29 03:57:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Not trying to stick up for RAJ or anything I'm just not buying into the extremely popular narrative.  No one would have said shit if Gillick made that comment but then again Gillick wouldn't be stupid enough to voice that sentiment to the media.  Galvis is a very interesting subject. What he's doing now as opposed to what he had been doing is night and day.  He's completely changed his mental approach and the mechanics of his swing and if he can continue doing that he won't flop regardless of what pitchers do.  He's hitting on a much more even plane and he's always had contact skills so those two together have/will produce steady line  drives which are always the best odds of getting a hit on. I haven't looked it up but from watching him all of his hits are exactly the same - line drives from left center to right center that fall between the infielders and the outfielders. He's also got a really good idea of what he can hit and what he can't hit and of the strike zone.  It may be wishful thinking but I really think he's figured it out.  And remember he was rushed to the majors because of Chase's injury that year, he really should have stayed in the minors to develop for longer than he did.  Regardless he's fun to watch now and it will be interesting to see what happens."
phillies,37nkvc,TheSubversive,2,Fri May 29 16:30:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know how it will look moving forward (there's a few good prospects but they're just that), but it's not just that every other team doesn't always hit. I'm going to try to find the source but I have read that the Phillies draft picks over the last 10 years have something like 50 WAR total, which is half of the second worst team. They haven't been just bad with their picks, they've been abysmal."

All that bullshit and not one mention of Monty, John Middleton III, Tri-Play Associates, and Claire S. Betz.  While all the fans since '07 where blinded by them spending money on payroll, you missed the signs that these cheap bastard owners never changed.  Not paying Lopes. Lopes wasn't a scapegoat.  He walked because these cheap owners wouldn't pay him.    Why the fuck do you guys think Chuck Lamar just up and quit in 2011?  These owners have never spent money in the draft.   They waaaaaay overdraft Biddle because he would be a cheap sign.  They waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overdraft Larry fucking Greene Jr because he was a cheap sign.  They refuse to spend money internationally.  I'm sure this team couldn't have used Darvish, Puig, Cespedes, Tomas.  Oh wait. I forgot Gillick thinksTomas is too fat.    It's Monty and co. who decide to pay these guys at the end of their career to somehow keep the illusion of a contender.  Keep the fans since '07 coming out to the park to see St. Chase.  You think CSN would have paid as much as they did if this slop was being run out there two years ago?  Ruben doesn't get absolved here.  He needs to go.

They waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overdraft Larry fucking Greene Jr because he was a cheap sign.   I don't know if this is true. At that point they already had a huge major league payroll. And the money they save by drafting under-slot (which is only really a couple million at most. nothing compared to the big picture of what they're spending) gets spent later on in the draft anyway. I think it was just a risky draft strategy that burnt them in those cases.  Bunt then, taking the prep school player in 2013 (JP Crawford) is looking like a huge win for them right now.   I agree that there are more people to blame than RAJ, but not because they've been cheap. Because they've had a heavy hand over the direction the team has gone in."
phillies,37hahc,15thStreet,11,Thu May 28 04:05:50 2015 UTC,"Okay... first thing is first.  Roman Quinn is definitely NOT the player Bryce Harper is.  In terms of talent and MLB readiness.  All his life, Harper had been jumping and transitioning from league to league since the moment he started playing baseball.  His mind was ready for the MLB arguably the moment he was drafted.  He just basically had to learn a new position.  Although Quinn has wheels and can get on base, I would want to see him transition into Lehigh Valley before jumping into the bigs.  At 22, I don't share the same sense of urgency that the author seems to have.  Ellsbury, Dee Gordon,  were both 23 years old before their first MLB appearance.  And they were higher rated prospects.  Brett Gardner was 24.  I don't think that the Phillies have botched or stunned Quinns development.  As a matter of fact, we'll probably even get to see him play in September and Spring of next year.  I'm not going to pull apart this article.  There are a lot of things that I disagree with here.  I just wanted to comment on what I felt was most glaring.    Yes Ruben was wrong for saying what he had said.  If for anything than for just being stupid.  Now into the 7th year of his role as general manager, Ruben should understand if at anything-at-all, that the Philadelphia fans are bipolar psychopaths.  And I say this in the most tongue-in-cheek way.  But we are.  Ruben is already not well received amongst the Philadelphia fans.  We are people who blasted one of the most offensive players in Philadelphia sports history (Jimmy Rollins) for gently calling us ""bandwagoners"".  This isn't a matter of ""choosing your words carefully"", this is just a case of presenting yourself in a really stupid manner."
phillies,37hahc,RicsFlair,2,Wed May 27 17:43:21 2015 UTC,"Not to mention Quinn suffered a ruptured Achilles, a huge setback for a player with his skillset. Given that on top of how little he showed with the bat before this year, his progression to this point is ahead of schedule."
phillies,37hahc,15thStreet,2,Thu May 28 04:12:01 2015 UTC,"It sickens me to see the Phillies this bad. I remember when I used to hate seeing the Phillies because they were such a model of success.   Now, they are a pile of trash and it was shown once again last night in their starting pitcher (SO'S).   RAJ is a major issue, but he's not the only one that needs to go.

I know the popular narrative is to just hate this guy regardless of anything, even when he sticks with Galvis and it turns out to be the right move, he trades 2 old vets on huge 1 year contracts for 2 stud young pitchers, he plucks a nice pick up like Herrera out of nowhere.  He couldn't do a single thing right in most peoples eyes even though he's definitely done some things right. I don't really care what he says.  I know he's an idiot and I don't care.  If he can continue to make good baseball decisions he can call me names all day long. He's probably right.  There are a lot of casual fans out there that don't know shit.  They don't know what a rule 5 pick up is. They don't know what a super 2 is.  And most of all they don't understand major league service time and how it affects controllable salary and being arbitration eligible.   I occasionally listen to sports talk radio and I can tell you that this town is full of people who think they know a lot more than they do.  Guys who pour concrete all day and think they can run a billion dollar organization...or all four of them in this town.  And hell if they aren't belligerent as fuck about their ignorance.  But when I found out he was referring to people clamoring to bring up Nola and Elfin as people who ""don't understand shit"" I got pissed....Because he's absolutely 100% right.  If you think those guys should be up here pitching in an admittedly lost season than you are a bigger idiot than he is and yeah, you don't understand the fucking process.  Should he have said it?  Absolutely not.  It was a stupid thing to say publicly.  But that doesn't make it untrue."

We had heard earlier in the year from the Eskin report that Montgomery was the one pulling the strings on moves like the Howard extension and the holding on of the core players despite age.  And there has been a belief for years, even before that Eskin report came out that this was the case.  The point is that only those guys in the organization know.  Gillick is an incredible baseball mind, a hall of fame front office guy.  So ask yourself this: Why is he so high on Amaro?"

phillies,37dpsk,TheSubversive,0,Wed May 27 02:02:01 2015 UTC,And this is what Ruben was talking about - not like you or me who know that Dom was a consensus top 5 prospect by all of baseball - but guys like mattyfresh up there who think Dom Brown wasn't a highly regarded prospect.  They have this very limited knowledge of the game and think they know it all...and then get insulted when they get called out on it.
phillies,37dpsk,deaftpunk,3,Wed May 27 23:01:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah but you're the GM of a professional franchise. You can't dismiss casual fans like that.   Before a year ago, his plan was to stay the course and hope everything works out. That's not a plan."
phillies,37dpsk,TheSubversive,0,Thu May 28 00:02:15 2015 UTC,"He should not have said what he did.  That was very, very wrong.  However, it's not completely untrue.  You and me and a lot of the people who are on this sub are not the people he's talking about.  The people he's talking about we both know - they're fans but only to the extent that they follow the team through the media and catch a few games on TV when it's convenient and they go to 1 or 2 a year and have no idea who's pitching until they get there.  We know the rotation and who is scheduled when, we know the guys in the system and we know what BABIP is.  Regarding him, yeah, he tried to keep the window open too long.  He kept hoping that Howard would return to form (as he has a bit lately) earlier, and he hoped that with a Hamels-Lee 1-2 punch he had a shot.  He was wrong.  But sometimes a full on rebuild isn't the right way to go either.  If you look at it, when ticket sales began to precipitously drop he reacted.  Should he have reacted sooner?  Probably but when things are good it's tough to disrupt them.  AS for everything he's done since he decided to ""give up"", he's done a really great job.  I'm amazed at what he got for Rollins and Byrd.  I think Herrera has a lot of potential.  Not taking whatever for Hamels will probably be the right decision if he can manage to really get some good players this year (part of me thinks he had to hold out on Hamels to show the rest of the league that he wasn't just going to take whatever and that he was establishing his own credibility back.)  If Harang can continue what he's doing we'll get more pieces back and probably good ones.  And our system is looking fantastic right now.  And really, the most important thing that's happened to this team in a long time happened last year on his watch and it's a huge thing: the TV deal which makes us one of the richest teams in baseball.  How much shorter will our rebuild be with that influx of cash every year?  And yeah, it would have been huge regardless but who knows how keeping the core guys (who are/were ridiculously popular) around helped it.  There are a lot of fans watching this team right now who only know them from '07 on and they don't understand that this is the ebb and flow of most teams: win a ton, go into a lull, rebuild and come back.  They thought we would compete this year or that we were even trying to, which is ridiculous.  The team is exactly where it should be right now and depending on how the trade deadline goes for us this year we could be competitive again a fucking lot sooner than most people originally thought.  A lot sooner.  Sorry for the long soliloquy but you seem reasonable and I had to get a lot of that off my chest.  Thanks for listening."

It's primarily Ruben's fault the Phillies are as bad as they are.  Howard's injury in 11 certainly had something to do with it, but Amaro has proven time and time again that he is completely incompetent, and cannot be trusted with a team.  How he hasn't been fired is absolutely beyond me, and as a fan, I can't take much more of his shit.  One more stunt like this, and I'm afraid I'll have to stop following the Phillies.

phillies,37bfpj,Uhrzeitlich,2,Tue May 26 12:53:17 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with you. I personally believe he was stalling a rebuild because he was being told to do so by owners. Since they've started actually rebuilding, he has done a decent job. He got really good hauls for Byrd and Rollins. He made good signings for guys like Harang and Billingsley. Both guys were signed with virtually no risk, and Harang is our second best pitcher right now and could probably net something similar to Byrd and Rollins. He also nabbed Odubel from the Rangers, and gave Freddy a chance to play.  His plan right now is to accumulate talent while he slowly rids himself of the veterans on this roster. A good draft pick and the right trade for Hamels is what will give this rebuild a real noticeable direction, and until those things happen, there's really no way for anyone, including Ruben, to know exactly what direction they need to move in."
phillies,37bfpj,oldknave,5,Tue May 26 23:15:22 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't know about that ultimately.  We're still so far behind on statistical analysis it isn't funny.

For example, stocking up on high minors pitching prospects over the offseason was not pure coincidence. If you can't pick up on that, then maybe the problem is your pattern recognition skills, not the lack of a plan."
phillies,37bfpj,Angry_Amishman,3,Tue May 26 20:05:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think they actually have a plan. However, I think it's not a very good one. Going all in on pitching has proven in the past to not be effective. You need a balanced and well rounded team of consistent players at every position to win the World Series. Trading our offensive assets for pitchers is a mistake we've already made."
phillies,37bfpj,GranGotcha,2,Tue May 26 16:51:46 2015 UTC,"I think the pitching acquisitions were in response to the '09 World Series loss. They had a killer offense but they trotted out Cliff Lee (yay), a washed up Pedro (who was decent regular season but sucked vs. Yanks), Cole Hamels who was trash all season, and Blanton. The thinking was sound that with 4 Aces and even 80% of their bats from 2008, they'd easily win the World Series. NLCS is close but it takes some luck..."

At least they are drafting good players.  I still cringe when I think about all the wasted 1st round draft picks we had prior to guys like Nola and Crawford."

There are plenty of things to criticize about him, but so often people do so without actually thinking and just jumping on anything they can. There's a huge lack of critical thinking. Whether or not going all in on Win-Now mode during our run was smart or not, I can guarantee you that if we didn't those same fans would be saying that Amaro squandered our best chances at actually winning when we could all for prospects that never panned out."

Hinkie has an end goal in mind, and is working towards that, and fans, for the most part, are recognizing he has a set plan andare willing to hold off screaming for heads. Kelly has done unorthodox moves that make perfect sense when you look at the big picture. And Philly fans recognize it, even if they are weary of getting to attach to personalities. RAJ is longer tenured than both of them, yet no one sees a unified theory to the long term actions.

phillies,37bfpj,thechurchofbradlidge,1 point,Tue May 26 22:30:57 2015 UTC,"but there is nothing to show for the process one day providing results.   Yes there is. Last May, the Phillies had zero pitching depth in the minor leagues. Now, their double A rotation is stacked.   The only ""plan"" for turning around a baseball team is bringing in quality players. You start by forming a core of youth and then once you have that in place, you build around it with free agents.  The Phillies are in the youth stage. They've addressed one area of need in the minors (pitching) and they'll continue to address others as they trade away more players. Currently, they've been waiting for their assets to attract the value in a trade they see as fair. And the market has ben shaping up in their favor with pitchers struggling and getting hurt for the year. If it turns out Amaro and Gillick maximize their return on Hamels, that's a ""plan"" well executed. Unlike the NBA and NFL, you can't turn your team around in one year with one draft pick.   Oh, and Amaro is accumulating high draft picks just like Hinkie. He even turned the last two into very good prospects. Meanwhile Hinkie has had, what? Two picks actually play well for the team? And one of them he then traded away. Meanwhile half his picks haven't seen the floor as he stocks up on more picks that will definitely, certainly turn out better than the ones in the past.

phillies,37bfpj,2manychefs,1 point,Tue May 26 16:22:28 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Hackstol will be the change in coaching the Flyers need. If the players he coached at UND that went pro (Oshie, Toews, Sajac) is any indication of his knowledge of player development, I think we'll be in for a treat in a couple years especially given the young talent we currently have as well as the amount of early round draft picks we have this year."

So I think that undercuts Amaro's argument - Philly fans will support you if they think you're a good GM.  My problem with the Phillies' management is that they always seem to be a step behind every other team. A day late, a dollar short, etc. Although I haven't absolutely hated a move they've made in about 2-3 years (Delmon Young) so that's something."

Ninja edit: I forgot to answer the other questions. I prefer left field, sections 142-146ish, but you can't go wrong in the 100 or 200 levels. If you don't mind being up high, check out the 300 level behind home plate.   There is a Tony Luke's cheesesteak stand in center field which is on par with the real non-ballpark restaurant. I recommend that and crab fries from Chickie's and Pete's (although personally I don't like crab fries/Old Bay seasoning)."

Just take it and give it back without an attitude.  Don't stand and taunt the same way like you wouldn't want to be by Phillies fans in your park.  If you want to go cheap, sit up top behind home plate.  420 area.  Anywhere lower level is good.  HOF Club isn't all it is cracked up to be.  If it is a day game, try to sit third base side or you'll be roasting. Food wise, meh, everything is watered down versions of what the city has to offer.  Sadly, there is a lot more to Philadelphia than cheesesteaks and pretzels, but if you're just planning to eat at the stadium, you definitely have to grab some crab fries.  If you're looking to make a day in the city, I can suggest a number of places to grab a bite for food.   Buy on Stubhub.  Will be far cheaper."

No, you'll be fine. Expect some ribbing.   Where are good seats? Is there any section better than the others?   I prefer 142/242 (end of the 3rd base line) or up behind home plate in the 300s.

phillies,377c4p,shoresfront,33,Mon May 25 13:57:34 2015 UTC,It seems the real problem is a surplus of bodies and a deficit of talent.
phillies,377c4p,Bohnanza,10,Mon May 25 14:27:19 2015 UTC,Trade Revere for prospects hoping Asche can be good at LF. Keep Herrara in CF. For RF I dont know. We are screwed
phillies,377c4p,Charmanderp7,7,Mon May 25 14:17:10 2015 UTC,"What prospects do you realistically see us getting for Revere that aren't certain busts, though?"
phillies,377c4p,Jayyburdd,5,Mon May 25 15:41:17 2015 UTC,I think people underestimate Revere's value.  He was in contention for a batting title last year.  He can hit for average and has tremendous speed so if he can get on base he can get himself into scoring position very easily and he can score from second on practically any hit that leaves the infield.  He also hits left handed pitching extremely well and he's a lefty and that's valued in baseball.  He may be deficient in other areas but he's improved his arm and he's been solid in left.  There's definitely some value there; they could get a good low A ball prospect for him and from there who knows?
phillies,377c4p,TheSubversive,1 point,Mon May 25 17:28:49 2015 UTC,"People underestimate his value, though, and that's why we probably won't get much for him. It'd be better to keep his value here if no one else will match it."
phillies,377c4p,Jayyburdd,1 point,Mon May 25 17:30:59 2015 UTC,"He'd be a good addition to a contending team. A guy you can stick in the lineup and know he's going to hit .300, steal 40 bases, play decent CF, and put up 2 WAR over a full season is valuable as a complementary player."
phillies,377c4p,wontonsoupsucka,1 point,Mon May 25 17:49:20 2015 UTC,"Pitchers don't fear him though.  He doesn't take walks because pitchers throw fast balls over the plate for him and although he hits for average he has absolutely no power.  It leaves him set up for fielder's choices and double plays with the talent behind  him.   Seriously, 1 career home run after playing over a year in CBP is awful."
phillies,377c4p,gingerbeardy,5,Wed May 27 15:13:26 2015 UTC,"Build a Thunderdome.  ""Two man enter.  One man leave.""  Hey, it would boost ticket sales."
phillies,377c4p,DellFargus,3,Mon May 25 17:56:12 2015 UTC,Having Master Blaster start in Right Field would provide some entertainment.
phillies,377c4p,CaligulasBallSack,5,Mon May 25 19:04:25 2015 UTC,"This is easy considering the Phillies situation.  Keep anyone who is both young and has potential while also being cheap.  SO that's Herrera and Asche primarily as both are very early in their major league careers and are controllable for a long time.  I think both can be at most above average MLB players.  Herrera is impressive considering he's hitting over .260 at this level and has never played above AA nor has he played in CF.  Next is Revere and Dom Brown.  Revere should be shopped as I think there's some value there that they may be able to capitalize on.  I like what they're doing with Brown and from all accounts it's working - he's hitting the ball to left and just taking what pitchers are giving him and he's hitting over .300 at AAA.  They may be able to get him back on track and he may come close to what the originally projections were but those are all maybes.  See what you can get out of him and maybe increase his value and then trade him but that will take at least a year to establish any value.  Francouer and Sizemore can go.  I'd keep Francouer over Sizemore as there may be some value in Francouer come the deadline; he's hit some HR's and his defense value is always there.  Maybe he gets a bit hot and a desperate contender comes along and we get a low a prospect.  Regarding Ruf, he's been so fucked around by this organization I just wish they'd trade him or let him walk so he can go and make a career for himself somewhere where they give him a shot."
phillies,377c4p,TheSubversive,6,Mon May 25 17:48:36 2015 UTC,Nobody is giving Ruf more of a shot than we've given him already
phillies,377c4p,metssuck,0,Mon May 25 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"Billy Beans would pick him up in a heartbeat, put him at first as an everyday player and look like a genius again.  Ruf has value, he can get on base and hit for power and around major league baseball those skills are coveted."
phillies,377c4p,TheSubversive,5,Mon May 25 23:25:18 2015 UTC,"He has 541 career plate appearances (so basically a full season) and a bWAR of 0.0, exactly replacement level. I could get in to a bunch of other stats but he's really not a highly regarded prospect. That .328 OBP isn't going to make Billy Beane druel"
phillies,377c4p,metssuck,2,Mon May 25 23:36:57 2015 UTC,"Odubel and Brown should play as much as possible. Give Brown one final chance to show that he can play and if he can trade him for whatever you can get.   Other than that I'd try to shop Revere and see if he has any B level prospect value, if not keep him. Also see what kind of minimal value the vets have, can possibly get organizational filler for them or you can just let them play it out. They aren't really blocking anyone anyhow"
phillies,377c4p,metssuck,2,Mon May 25 22:04:39 2015 UTC,Time machine. Get Victorino and Pence back. Never get rid of them without a real reason and a sure thing to replace them.
phillies,377c4p,gingerbeardy,1 point,Wed May 27 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"By the end of next year, we should have asche, Herrera, Dugan and Quinn ready. I like Dugan the most of the bunch. Hopefully odubel improves enough to be a solid regular. Quinn should be at least what revere is now, but even faster, and a little more power. Asche will be at least good enough for the 4th OF spot with his versatility. Backup 3b/1b emergency 2b"
phillies,377c4p,ihorsey,1 point,Mon May 25 21:28:38 2015 UTC,Revere will be expendable when Quinn is ready.  Quinn is the must keep out of the leadoff style outfielders.

phillies,377c4p,Xo0om,0,Wed May 27 12:46:56 2015 UTC,"I want to see Brown in the majors. He's the only one of our outfielders with potential upside. Even fielding, despite being bad, he's shown flashes of success. Herrera strikes out too much and has zero power, Francoeur is bad at everything, Ben Revere should be traded, Asche hasn't shown he can hit well enough to be a left fielder, and Darin Ruf is a 1b/dh."
phillies,377c4p,wontonsoupsucka,1 point,Mon May 25 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"Brown has not shown anything outside May 2013, and he's doing nothing in AAA. Brown will never be anything."

phillies,37808g,DellFargus,3,Mon May 25 17:57:44 2015 UTC,According to WAR he was by far the worst offensive player in baseball last year.  In the offseason he says that with all of the young players this year it was up to players like him to lead by example this year.  Instead he is stinking up AAA.  I have no hope for Dom.  He is delusional and will NEVER do anything with his potential.  That one month was a fluke.
phillies,37808g,WiseBeyondMyTears,3,Mon May 25 19:07:18 2015 UTC,So what are the expectations for him this year once he finally returns?     That he doesn't return.

phillies,37808g,Rockyrambo,5,Mon May 25 20:19:11 2015 UTC,"Fuck Domonic Brown.    We should've dumped him during his all-star year, because everyone in Philly knew that was an anomaly and that he was going to regress back to sucking."
phillies,37808g,SuggestAPhotoProject,10,Mon May 25 18:15:22 2015 UTC,"everyone in Philly knew that was an anomaly and that he was going to regress back to sucking.   Thats total revisionist history. Why would we have traded him away then? RAJ would have been CRUCIFIED for that. He was a former top 3 prospect in all of baseball, young, cost controlled, and finally demonstrated potential. It would have been asinine to trade him away. The sentiment at the time was that Amaro would be dumb enough to trade him for an older player now that we had a ""competent"" young player and that he would be the first piece of the future core."

phillies,375ros,Wudaokau,14,Mon May 25 02:58:19 2015 UTC,I agree I always felt people give Ryno a free pass because the team is so bad but I feel he doesn't know how to manage a bullpen and how to maximize a bench.
phillies,375ros,eagsrock20,10,Mon May 25 03:23:11 2015 UTC,"realistically, if he had some value as a head coach the cubs would have retained or promoted him up through their organization."
phillies,375ros,TheSublimeLight,1 point,Mon May 25 04:08:59 2015 UTC,Theo actually did want Sandberg in Boston.  The Cubs didn't use him beacuse they are trying to get away from old Cub stiff.

phillies,375ros,feralmonkeyboy,5,Mon May 25 05:51:46 2015 UTC,"I think they should go at the same time, they lineups going out are plain bad. If they were bad, but giving young guys playing time, I would get it, but Sizemore is continuingly playing over Ruf."
phillies,375ros,Rsubs33,4,Mon May 25 07:21:33 2015 UTC,"I think Amaros done everything right the past couple years. Sandberg though, awful bullpen usage, days off at wrong time."
phillies,375ros,ihorsey,2,Mon May 25 16:50:24 2015 UTC,Keep Sandberg for now. The team is playing well for him (relatively) at this point. The team is still stuck with a bloated payroll. Give him a season with at least some sort of progress in terms of roster talent.
phillies,375ros,CaligulasBallSack,3,Mon May 25 19:02:15 2015 UTC,I'm tired of his bullpen decisions and other moves that make no sense. Galvis was batting 8th for way too long.
phillies,375ros,sjphilsphan,1 point,Mon May 25 07:30:06 2015 UTC,"Last year, his lineups were terrible. This year, he seems to blunder the bullpen somehow in every game I watch. I think he's an idiot."
phillies,375ros,ObligatoryHandle,1 point,Mon May 25 22:59:19 2015 UTC,They left out the part where he rests our team once every five days
phillies,375ros,VideoGangsta,1 point,Tue May 26 00:37:30 2015 UTC,At this point I'm more concerned about how he manages the locker room with all the young guys and veterans. If he can do that well enough I don't see a reason to fire him until we're ready to compete. I don't see a situation in which we get a new manager and we think he's great. Even Charlie got shit for how his bullpen management was. Managers on losing teams are just too easy to criticize in hindsight.
phillies,375ros,K20BB5,0,Tue May 26 13:41:43 2015 UTC,So you idiots basically want to turn in to the Raiders and have a revolving door. Every manager and pitching coach in the last 5 years has been blamed for mishandling the bullpen.  Just stop. Stop.
phillies,375ros,JerryFilter,2,Mon May 25 15:42:10 2015 UTC,It seems now like there was a good reason no other club in the majors wanted to interview McClure.

phillies,3720gd,MajorSuccess,7,Sun May 24 07:37:20 2015 UTC,"100% agreed. His own family attempted to sue him after they stole money from him, he suffered a horrible injury, RAJ publicly said he didn't want him and a lot of fans still boo him to no end at CBP. He helped give us a WS and he's going to be gone by 2016. Big Piece needs some love while he's still around"
phillies,3720gd,michaeljack20,42,Sun May 24 13:34:25 2015 UTC,"Ryan Howard appears on Entourage September 2010, the following season the show goes off the air and with it goes Howard's last 30 HR 100 RBI season. Now with the Entourage movie coming out Howard has it in himself that he was once the man, once a part of the Entourage, and has stepped his game up again. Coincidence?...entirely. Probably has more to do with resolving those personal/family issues over the off-season"
phillies,3720gd,Frankie_Carbone,4,Sun May 24 06:46:21 2015 UTC,"this was the episode when vince gets beat up by eminem and has to go to rehab, then he spends the next season trying to get his bad miner movie made. vinnie chase's career ups and downs seem to mirror howard's - the two are cosmically connected. let's hope the entourage movie ends with a big win for vince, for the sake of phillies fans everywhere"

phillies,3720gd,PhilaDopephia,27,Sun May 24 13:10:44 2015 UTC,"It's no surprise that they've been doing better and winning some games either. Even when they were good, when Howard got hot, the phillies won games. He freaking carried the team some of those summer months back during the '06-12 run."
phillies,3720gd,m16a,7,Sun May 24 04:43:11 2015 UTC,Howards best skill is fear. The threat of the long ball makes pitchers pitch to people before and after him differently. It was great 06 to 10 because you had Utley before and then werth after who both could make pitchers pay for walking Howard. Its no surprise werth hasn't had the batting career in DC as he did in Philly. When Howard is not hitting HR everyone struggles because pitchers can pitch around the people near Howard.
phillies,3720gd,Cualax23,14,Sun May 24 12:03:20 2015 UTC,He carried us through our playoff runs man I never gave him shit. People forget too easy
phillies,3720gd,jj6683,4,Sun May 24 05:15:30 2015 UTC,"Credit where it's due, but I don't think anyone was mistaken to be angry about his approach to the game over the last couple years. He would have needed a bat the size of himself to hit some of the pitches he swung at."
phillies,3720gd,Rev_Jim_lgnatowski,4,Sun May 24 23:06:06 2015 UTC,"I was definitely there with heaping the shit on a player who I had thought had given up and put no effort in, waiting for the next check to clear.   Now, I see a recharged Howard who is personally improving as well as showing a great example for the new guys coming up.   Go Howard, and go Phils!!"
phillies,3720gd,bendersuperpower,4,Sun May 24 14:27:25 2015 UTC,"I miss the feeling that I've felt the last couple weeks of being excited to watch the Phillies. I don't know why, but we just aren't going to be as bad as we've been the last couple. Howard and Hamels' success will be better for this franchise in more than one way. Looking forward to seeing how this season pans out."
phillies,3720gd,gbs213,2,Sun May 24 06:10:35 2015 UTC,"I feel like that feeling just leads us into that same old trap though. The past few seasons, we've sucked but had those stretches where we've played well enough that there began to be hope that we could actually make a playoff run, only to come crashing down to earth and having our hopes crushed."
phillies,3720gd,gbs213,3,Sun May 24 06:14:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I'm not talking about a playoff run. I know we are going absolutely no where. But I'm talking about seeing a great start come from Hamels and Harang almost every game. The backend of the bullpen being lights out and unbelievable. Franco providing a much needed boost to our lineup both offensively and defensively. It's good to watch. Plus with the mainframe that the more success we have the better chance we have at trading everyone. Papelbon, Howard, Hamels, Revere, Harang, etc."
phillies,3720gd,K20BB5,2,Sun May 24 16:06:35 2015 UTC,100% agreed. Not to mention the farm is doing well too! Real excited about the AA rotation. Can't remember things looking up like this in a while
phillies,3720gd,Flavor_Flavius,3,Mon May 25 16:28:18 2015 UTC,"Counter point: you read this headline in the Philly Inquirer: ""Phillies Trade Howard to...."" Is your immediate reaction relief or depression? For me it's the former."
phillies,3720gd,CthruBlunts,5,Sun May 24 15:50:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ultimately trading him is the best thing that could happen for the team and him. BUT that's even more reason to appreciate how hard he is working right now, he is raising his trade stock"
phillies,3720gd,dekes_n_watson,2,Sun May 24 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"Depression for me. Even though I know the right move, it's always hard for me to let people go that I feel should be lifers. Hamels and Howard (and Utley) are those guys for me."
phillies,3720gd,fiascoshow,2,Sun May 24 17:10:24 2015 UTC,"Okay.  I fucking love Ryan Howard.  He's a big reason my girl friend has fallen in love with baseball (chicks dig the long ball 8]) which makes it super easy to watch and go to games.  More reasons why I love him?  Okay.  He has a really nice butt.  He is the only source of power on this team this season. Without him smoking the ball every September the Phils would have never made the playoffs in '07 and '08.    A bit more of a sober analysis?  I'll try.  I wish he would have tried to get in shape when he was a better hitter.  Watching him in 2008 and how good he was...like the best run producer in MLB...it pains me to think of how much better he could have been.  Maybe Pujols level?  I wish he would have smacked so many HRs that he would have beaten out Barry Bonds' record because fuck Bonds.  Also...why didn't he hit enough to get Roy Halladay a World Series?  I've been drinking, probably.    Love you. Go Phils."
phillies,3720gd,ihorsey,5,Sun May 24 23:54:13 2015 UTC,"If Galvis and odubel were still hitting, we'd be unstoppable."
phillies,3720gd,TheSubversive,5,Sun May 24 05:49:31 2015 UTC,"Ryan Howard - makin' Philly sports fans seem like complete idiots since May 2015.  I was disappointed in a lot of his play but I never gave him shit, I never denounced him.  He gave me one of the best memories of my entire life in '08 and I'll never forget that.  For those of you that took a shot at him every chance you could get you should go bury your head in the sand...and leave it there.  You don't deserve to revel in any success he may have."
phillies,3720gd,dekes_n_watson,2,Sun May 24 12:54:59 2015 UTC,"You're getting downvoted but I'm with you. For the last few years I've gone to the park and heard nothing but people bash him, in between eating 5 dollar dogs and downing 6 beers as if we let them on the field they'd be hitting .350. People get spoiled when a player is good. 90% of athletes have career ups and downs. Players that play 10+ years and play at a high level through all of them tend to be HOF players. Sure it's frustrating to see a player struggle like he did, especially at his pay rate, but without him we'd still be waiting on a World Series. I'd understand being disgruntled with players who aren't and never have been good or contributed, I'm guilty of that, but to bash someone who contributed so much never made sense to me. You forget that these guys are players and need coaching and help along the way. He's made some pretty serious adjustments this year (since game one, it's starting to pay off now), and I'd like to think he finally has someone in his ear giving him valuable advice for the first time in 5 years. His approach has never been this good his entire career IMO."
phillies,3720gd,TheSubversive,2,Sun May 24 17:20:58 2015 UTC,"I went to about 45 games in 2008, I was heavily invested in the team. I was there when they clinched the division.  When they won the WS it was one of the happiest moments of my life.  I very clearly remember that next day and how happy I was.  I will never, never boo anyone who brought me that much joy.  I don't care what happened after that because that moment was the one that mattered and the one I will cherish....  And I haven't even mentioned the 5 straight division titles, the 2 league Championships, the MVP awards, ROY awards, the post season no-hitter, and all of that other shit."
phillies,3720gd,KevinAbridged,3,Mon May 25 18:41:49 2015 UTC,Just keep it going so we can trade him!

phillies,37248t,TheMightyCatatafish,2,Tue May 26 03:57:19 2015 UTC,Ive been reading about Art Charles and keeping an eye on him. Looks promising
phillies,37248t,Charmanderp7,2,Sun May 24 13:15:56 2015 UTC,"My wife nicked named him ""The Professor"" while he was here in Lakewood. The only reason being was his name sounded like someone who would be teaching a college class."
phillies,37248t,kingjester21,1 point,Tue May 26 22:24:57 2015 UTC,He's cooled down back to earth.
phillies,37248t,sjphilsphan,1 point,Mon May 25 18:26:04 2015 UTC,"A note on mark leiter Jr, his dad played for the Phil's if you remember and his uncle is Al Leiter. Thats probably why he got drafted as njit isnt known to be a great baseball school"
phillies,37248t,feralmonkeyboy,1 point,Sun May 24 05:38:41 2015 UTC,Crazy control. Has great secondary pitches. Him and Leibrandt James look great.
phillies,37248t,ihorsey,1 point,Sun May 24 05:47:49 2015 UTC,And he's just steadily gotten better since we drafted him.
phillies,37248t,TheSubversive,1 point,Sun May 24 10:36:15 2015 UTC,This is a nice write-ups I'd like to see more stuff like this here as I enjoy following the minors as well.  Maybe add Brandon liebrandt who is also the son of a former pitcher charlie. Hes killing it in Clearwater. Another good game today.
phillies,37248t,feralmonkeyboy,1 point,Sun May 24 05:42:27 2015 UTC,Shame imhofs hurt. But they have Mecias and Arano there as well.
phillies,37248t,ihorsey,1 point,Sun May 24 05:48:41 2015 UTC,How bad is Imhof hurt?
phillies,37248t,haunthorror,1 point,Sun May 24 09:26:24 2015 UTC,Looks like he could start pitching again soon. 1.8 era in two starts this year. Looked really good last year. Shoulder tendinitis.
phillies,37248t,ihorsey,1 point,Sun May 24 14:20:15 2015 UTC,"I don't see a lot of minors stuff in this sub, not enough personally.  Maybe there should be a dedicated sub for Phillies minors.  Anyway, I don't know what players other people look at, so here's one I've been watching and wondering about for years.  Carlos Tocci.  Currently batting .341 in Lakewood.  Signed out of Venezuela in 2012 when he was 16, one of the top of the International crop that year.  Huge potential but skinny as rail.  He's had some trouble putting on weight but he definitely has the frame for it.  I'm not too worried about the weight, you only need to look at rookie photos of Utley and Rollins to see players grow into their frames.    Expect him to be our future at CF."
phillies,37248t,Groty,2,Mon May 25 15:54:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Tocci is awesome. He is included on a lot of Top 10 Prospects lists, though, so I didn't include him here."
phillies,370l86,PhilsBot,13,Sat May 23 19:16:39 2015 UTC,Ryan Howard has been playing really well recently.
phillies,370l86,3vere1,9,Sat May 23 20:22:59 2015 UTC,Howard for HR derby?
phillies,370l86,3vere1,6,Sat May 23 21:24:25 2015 UTC,BIG PIECE IS BACK.
phillies,370l86,Charmanderp7,10,Sat May 23 21:44:51 2015 UTC,Cole isn't going to know what to do with 4 runs of support. This must feel like Christmas for him.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,6,Sat May 23 20:48:05 2015 UTC,He can never shave again.
phillies,370l86,sarahcasarah,4,Sat May 23 20:48:36 2015 UTC,"I was kind of digging the beard even before the runs started pouring in for him, but it absolutely has to stay now."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,7,Sat May 23 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"Man, I don't want Cole to ever leave. He's my hero."
phillies,370l86,de_dust,7,Sat May 23 21:05:50 2015 UTC,Strasburg went 3 2/3... nice.
phillies,370l86,3vere1,7,Sat May 23 21:10:30 2015 UTC,"The Big Piece, so hot right now."
phillies,370l86,TeamLuigi,4,Sat May 23 21:22:44 2015 UTC,Howard might be our best hitter this season.
phillies,370l86,LongJohnErd,1 point,Sat May 23 20:47:06 2015 UTC,Few seasons too late though :/
phillies,370l86,3vere1,6,Sat May 23 20:49:31 2015 UTC,This is a fun game
phillies,370l86,Jayyburdd,1 point,Sat May 23 21:18:17 2015 UTC,One of the few I've been able to watch from the beginning this season and have a  lot of fun doing so.
phillies,370l86,jambomyhombre,5,Sat May 23 21:44:07 2015 UTC,Howard is so fucking good
phillies,370l86,LongJohnErd,10,Sat May 23 21:21:37 2015 UTC,This is so amazing to watch. Couldn't happen to a better person. I'm so happy for the big man.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,7,Sat May 23 21:22:08 2015 UTC,EAT FRESH!
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,5,Sat May 23 21:21:41 2015 UTC,"Huh, Hamels has a higher batting average than Utley."
phillies,370l86,LongJohnErd,6,Sat May 23 21:29:08 2015 UTC,Awesome to see howard carrying the team again.
phillies,370l86,sjphilsphan,7,Sat May 23 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"That'll do, Chase."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,5,Sat May 23 20:44:10 2015 UTC,ODOUBLE
phillies,370l86,LongJohnErd,6,Sat May 23 21:04:10 2015 UTC,They better score it an infield hit. Can't give the Nats their 5th error in as many innings.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,5,Sat May 23 21:23:39 2015 UTC,"This lineup could have some pop in it with Utley, Ruf, Howard and Franco!"
phillies,370l86,BVM3,4,Sat May 23 21:35:34 2015 UTC,Hamels ERA is back under 3 after that inning.
phillies,370l86,de_dust,5,Sat May 23 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"Bryce is pissed, haha"
phillies,370l86,Jayyburdd,3,Sat May 23 22:39:31 2015 UTC,Another smoked ball for the Big Piece.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,4,Sat May 23 20:46:21 2015 UTC,FRANCO!

phillies,370l86,Mispelling,3,Sat May 23 21:07:04 2015 UTC,MOAR RUNS
phillies,370l86,LongJohnErd,3,Sat May 23 21:48:15 2015 UTC,This game gave me an erection. Strasburg getting chased out is just pure hardcore pornography.
phillies,370l86,ataristick,2,Sat May 23 23:09:49 2015 UTC,Cole is working quickly today.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,2,Sat May 23 20:37:21 2015 UTC,"Man, Howard had a meatball to hit on that first pitch."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,2,Sat May 23 20:44:37 2015 UTC,"Well, well, well! Everybody hits?"
phillies,370l86,sarahcasarah,2,Sat May 23 20:47:47 2015 UTC,First time seeing a Phillies game outside of Philly. Not bad but not as good as CBP
phillies,370l86,jeffgoodt,2,Sat May 23 20:51:06 2015 UTC,"Well, that's shitty luck."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,2,Sat May 23 20:51:53 2015 UTC,Cole scared the shit out of me with that pump fake. I imagined a late throw sailing into center.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,2,Sat May 23 20:55:15 2015 UTC,"This Taylor kid is a great fielder. Seems like he can hit, too. He'll probably be a thorn in our side when the Phils are finally good again."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,2,Sat May 23 21:06:52 2015 UTC,Cole against Cole. This will be confusing.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,2,Sat May 23 21:41:46 2015 UTC,Hernandez pls. I wonder if that erases the Nats' error.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,2,Sat May 23 21:48:38 2015 UTC,"Ha, they scored Hernandez's AB as a lineout"
phillies,370l86,LongJohnErd,2,Sat May 23 21:54:31 2015 UTC,This umpire is fucking awful. Perfect 0-2 pitch by Cole gets plenty of the plate and he just stands there.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,2,Sat May 23 21:55:43 2015 UTC,There was a pretty questionable call on the Span strikeout so I'm okay with the last missed call
phillies,370l86,LongJohnErd,2,Sat May 23 21:57:27 2015 UTC,"That's true. That was a 3-2 pitch, as well, so a pretty big call.   Still, this umpire's zone is awful."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,2,Sat May 23 21:59:25 2015 UTC,"My god, there have been a ton of questionable scoring decisions by opposing teams' official scorers on this road trip"
phillies,370l86,hmpsnj,2,Sat May 23 22:02:14 2015 UTC,How many of these lucky hits to third can they get?
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,2,Sat May 23 22:22:52 2015 UTC,Admittedly some of them wouldn't be hits if Franco fielded them better
phillies,370l86,LongJohnErd,2,Sat May 23 22:24:27 2015 UTC,That Bryce Harper. So cold right now.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 22:38:16 2015 UTC,"This umpire doesn't call the low strike. Can't complain, though, since Revere was on base to start our rally thanks to one of those ball calls."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 20:56:34 2015 UTC,Two hits and they're both little dribblers to third.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 21:33:06 2015 UTC,How is that not strike 3?
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 21:38:34 2015 UTC,Bullshit walk. Inning should already be over between the error and missed strike 3 call.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 21:39:54 2015 UTC,The Big Piece is delivering today!
phillies,370l86,metssuck,1 point,Sat May 23 21:41:47 2015 UTC,That's kind of hilarious. A line drive in the gap that goes all the way to the wall and it's essentially a groundout in the box score.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 21:49:48 2015 UTC,What happened? The app says line out yo pitcher.
phillies,370l86,faithdies,1 point,Sat May 23 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"He hit a double to the right center gap, but missed first base very obviously. He ended up going to third on an error, but the Nats appealed after the play and he was called out at first.   So no hit, no error, but an RBI fielder's choice that scored a runner from first."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 22:00:29 2015 UTC,He didnt fucking touch first.....damn it. Laughing at how TMac is saying how Sandberg is talking how Hernandez is a great player
phillies,370l86,Charmanderp7,0,Sat May 23 21:51:43 2015 UTC,"He's had a great day at the plate, though and his hitting the ball well. He also led the team in walks for a long time despite getting way less playing time than everyone else.   His defense is subpar, especially on the left side of the diamond, but he is turning into a pretty useful utility player thanks to his hitting."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 22:01:32 2015 UTC,His defense is actually pretty good
phillies,370l86,Charmanderp7,1 point,Sat May 23 22:06:42 2015 UTC,"He's awful at third and shortstop, where Sandberg plays him too often."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 22:09:59 2015 UTC,"Shit I got my threads mixed up, I thought we were on the topic of Howard"
phillies,370l86,Charmanderp7,1 point,Sat May 23 22:12:46 2015 UTC,"That 0-2 pitch to Desmond. Luckily, they still got him."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 21:58:26 2015 UTC,WOW
phillies,370l86,GirouxIs4TheChildren,1 point,Sat May 23 22:32:27 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/9NM6KzU lineout to pitcher?
phillies,370l86,Charmanderp7,1 point,Sat May 23 22:02:37 2015 UTC,This fucking umpire has stolen at least 3 strikeouts from Hamels now.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 22:25:35 2015 UTC,"Fantastic start by Hamels. Five hits, but 3 didn't make it out of the infield and one was actually an error."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 22:29:29 2015 UTC,Is Franco having a bad game at third? 3 singles to third in a single game is crazy.
phillies,370l86,faithdies,1 point,Sat May 23 22:30:12 2015 UTC,"The first one was bad luck. He was going to make the play, but it hit the bag and popped straight up in the air.   The second one he probably had a play on if he barehanded it cleanly.  And the last one, he had no shot at getting Taylor, even if he fielded it cleanly.   He does have an error that was scored a double, though."
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 22:33:13 2015 UTC,Last chance for the cycle.
phillies,370l86,15thStreet,1 point,Sat May 23 22:32:22 2015 UTC,"Damn. Great win. Wish we had done just a little more yesterday for a potential sweep, but I'll take it. Nearly in 3rd place."
phillies,370l86,thelostdolphin,1 point,Sat May 23 22:45:14 2015 UTC,Well that definitely eased the sting from last night's loss. This team is playing some decent baseball!
phillies,36xdkc,PhilsBot,11,Fri May 22 22:17:45 2015 UTC,"I don't know why the Natl's fans are applauding...Phils are going to hit a billion home runs in the top of the 9th.  Idiots.  I haven't been drinking, probably."
phillies,36xdkc,fiascoshow,5,Sat May 23 01:17:12 2015 UTC,I can see from your flair.
phillies,36xdkc,Jayyburdd,5,Sat May 23 01:21:06 2015 UTC,I don't know what you're talking about.
phillies,36xdkc,fiascoshow,9,Sat May 23 01:24:26 2015 UTC,oh great this guy is in the NLE for the forseeable future
phillies,36xdkc,kc3551,3,Fri May 22 23:37:58 2015 UTC,"Someone's going to snatch him away from the Nats in free agency in a few years, though."
phillies,36xdkc,15thStreet,4,Fri May 22 23:48:00 2015 UTC,He is locked up to 2019.
phillies,36xdkc,ZonaPunk,5,Fri May 22 23:51:32 2015 UTC,"Free agent after the 2018 season. So a few years, like I said."
phillies,36xdkc,15thStreet,8,Fri May 22 23:55:55 2015 UTC,Why didn't you hang in there Harang...
phillies,36xdkc,mattyfressh,4,Fri May 22 23:08:19 2015 UTC,I heard something about a standoff? What the hell was all that about?
phillies,36xdkc,Hi_There_Face_Here,4,Fri May 22 23:08:55 2015 UTC,Harang and a player from the Nats (can't remember name) were standing outside the dugouts from the end of the national anthem apparently staring at each other while harang hand a catchers mask and chest protector on and the Nats player had a batting helmet on backwards and his hat over his heart and they stood there til harang went in to the dugout right before the first pitch
phillies,36xdkc,mattyfressh,1 point,Fri May 22 23:26:51 2015 UTC,But why?
phillies,36xdkc,Hi_There_Face_Here,2,Sat May 23 02:29:39 2015 UTC,That's the beauty of it... no one knows...
phillies,36xdkc,mattyfressh,6,Sat May 23 03:57:35 2015 UTC,"O""double"" Herrera"
phillies,36xdkc,mattyfressh,6,Fri May 22 23:31:45 2015 UTC,Span has saved a couple runs for Scherzer.
phillies,36xdkc,15thStreet,6,Sat May 23 00:06:16 2015 UTC,I have nothing but respect for Spans range.  (must resist pun)
phillies,36xdkc,Rekkonin,5,Sat May 23 00:02:42 2015 UTC,"That's how you do it, O'Sully!!"
phillies,36xdkc,Rekkonin,4,Fri May 22 23:18:52 2015 UTC,Sully is the man right now.
phillies,36xdkc,Jayyburdd,3,Fri May 22 23:19:03 2015 UTC,There ya go Ryan. Let's get at him early.
phillies,36xdkc,thelostdolphin,3,Fri May 22 23:22:17 2015 UTC,"And, we fucked it up."
phillies,36xdkc,finesthour12,4,Fri May 22 23:27:08 2015 UTC,DOOBS!
phillies,36xdkc,Rekkonin,4,Fri May 22 23:30:17 2015 UTC,EL TOOOORRRIIIITTTTOOO!
phillies,36xdkc,Jayyburdd,4,Fri May 22 23:30:31 2015 UTC,"Damn, two barely missed home runs"
phillies,36xdkc,LongJohnErd,4,Fri May 22 23:30:35 2015 UTC,So by the end of the season will Aaron Nola be a better option than our 5th starter?
phillies,36xdkc,mattyfressh,4,Fri May 22 23:44:03 2015 UTC,"By the end of the year, Aaron Nola might be our 3rd starter. So, yes."
phillies,36xdkc,15thStreet,4,Fri May 22 23:48:50 2015 UTC,"He had another good start a few nights ago, he just keeps throwing good games"
phillies,36xdkc,mattyfressh,3,Fri May 22 23:58:23 2015 UTC,"Three innings, three balls absolutely smoked off Scherzer."
phillies,36xdkc,15thStreet,4,Fri May 22 23:49:17 2015 UTC,Sooner or later it's going to carry out...
phillies,36xdkc,Jayyburdd,5,Sat May 23 00:02:40 2015 UTC,I feel like Sully is definitely outpitching Scherzer right now.
phillies,36xdkc,LongJohnErd,3,Sat May 23 00:30:18 2015 UTC,Well that was quick
phillies,36xdkc,Rekkonin,3,Fri May 22 23:10:58 2015 UTC,DOOOOBS!
phillies,36xdkc,finesthour12,3,Fri May 22 23:30:45 2015 UTC,I wonder what Chooch's BA is with RISP
phillies,36xdkc,kc3551,3,Fri May 22 23:33:27 2015 UTC,"I hate Harper, gah."
phillies,36xdkc,Jayyburdd,3,Fri May 22 23:37:37 2015 UTC,"So close. I love you Galvis, please don't make me cry again."
phillies,36xdkc,Rekkonin,3,Fri May 22 23:49:13 2015 UTC,Well... I mean... we haven't left any runners in scoring position yet...
phillies,36xdkc,Rekkonin,3,Fri May 22 23:50:29 2015 UTC,"Harper, 1. O'Sullivan, 2."
phillies,36xdkc,15thStreet,3,Sat May 23 00:08:39 2015 UTC,"Harper, 1. Phillies, 1."
phillies,36xdkc,finesthour12,3,Sat May 23 00:09:42 2015 UTC,"Oh no. He let Max ""We-need-a-DH-because-I-can't-hit"" Scherzer single."
phillies,36xdkc,Jayyburdd,3,Sat May 23 00:43:45 2015 UTC,And it may have cost him the loss.
phillies,36xdkc,finesthour12,3,Sat May 23 00:47:25 2015 UTC,Haha. Great pick.
phillies,36xdkc,thelostdolphin,3,Sat May 23 01:08:37 2015 UTC,GOT HEEEEEEEEEEEEM
phillies,36xdkc,LongJohnErd,3,Sat May 23 01:08:39 2015 UTC,It's just a cut. Phew.
phillies,36xdkc,Jayyburdd,3,Sat May 23 01:20:17 2015 UTC,Fuck the Expos.
phillies,36xdkc,fiascoshow,3,Sat May 23 01:41:26 2015 UTC,Not a great at-bat by Odubel.
phillies,36xdkc,toddrob,2,Sat May 23 01:41:30 2015 UTC,I don't think he threw him a single strike.
phillies,36xdkc,finesthour12,3,Sat May 23 01:42:53 2015 UTC,Like I said. Extremely frustrating game today. I hate versing the Nats.
phillies,36xdkc,Jayyburdd,2,Sat May 23 01:41:48 2015 UTC,"Normally I'd feel better about a 2-1 loss to Scherzer, but 0-8 with RISP is soooo frustrating to see."
phillies,36xdkc,finesthour12,3,Sat May 23 01:45:09 2015 UTC,"Especially with looming losses from the Braves and Marlins. I would love to gain some leverage on the two. It'd be nice to pull away from the Fish and pull closer to the Braves, but we just can't."
phillies,36xdkc,Jayyburdd,1 point,Sat May 23 01:47:06 2015 UTC,But it's sure nice to even consider it when you think of what it felt like 2 weeks ago.
phillies,36xdkc,Improvinator,3,Sat May 23 02:05:49 2015 UTC,Here's hoping that tomorrow will be a better day.
phillies,36xdkc,Rekkonin,2,Sat May 23 01:43:10 2015 UTC,It will be.  Phils begin their march to the NL penn...ugh.
phillies,36xdkc,fiascoshow,3,Sat May 23 01:45:40 2015 UTC,"You almost got through it without vomiting.  Was that from frustration, or did you just have too much."
phillies,36xdkc,Rekkonin,1 point,Sat May 23 01:49:33 2015 UTC,Frustration.  They haven't been THAT bad this week.
phillies,36xdkc,fiascoshow,2,Sat May 23 01:51:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they're strikes, but Scherzer was getting some of those calls on the outside corner against our lefties. Gotta be consistent, blue."

phillies,36rw8u,thechurchofbradlidge,0,Thu May 21 19:32:25 2015 UTC,Yeah sure.  Like you weren't trashing him every chance you got?  And I apologize if you were one of the very few who didn't but that's ulikely.  When fans bitch as much about a player as {Phillies fans did about Ryan it almost forces the front office into saying something.  So just look at it as you destroyed his trade value via Rube.
phillies,36rw8u,TheSubversive,2,Fri May 22 18:41:30 2015 UTC,"I have bitched about Howard's contract, but not Howard himself. There is really nothing he can do about the injuries that he sustained and there was no way he could ever live up to his contract. It was clear that he was already on the way down in 2011. Just a stupid stupid move by the front office. There have been plenty of fans that have gotten angry at howard, so you aren't wrong."
phillies,36rw8u,thechurchofbradlidge,1 point,Fri May 22 19:47:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Imagine if RAJ had said that Ryan Howard is good enough to start at 1B and bat 4th. People would have gone mad. RAJ shouldn't have said anything, but it was the incessant complaining of the fans that led to it."
phillies,36rw8u,K20BB5,7,Tue May 26 13:45:40 2015 UTC,"If we don't get at least a B level prospect, then just let him play out his contract until he's blocking someone. I'd love to see him break some more milestones as long as he's producing. It'll be a couple years til we have a 1b prospect knocking on the door. Probably Hoskins."

phillies,36rw8u,TheSubversive,1 point,Fri May 22 18:44:11 2015 UTC,Yeah it's a lose lose situation frankly. People will see we gave up Howard and 50 million and freak out. Especially when it's maybe an org top 20 player. But it's probably the best move.
phillies,36rw8u,ihorsey,1 point,Fri May 22 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's a lose lose situation frankly   No doubt.  And just watch how people lash out when we end up on the losing end.  There is a scenario where we ride this out and he miraculously keeps up what he's done over the past few weeks and someone takes him, a larger part of the contract and gives us back something decent.  But that depends on him being the '08ish Ryan Howard.  I'm not as ""it's impossible"" as most people are but I'm not optimistic about that happening either."
phillies,36rw8u,TheSubversive,1 point,Fri May 22 22:06:37 2015 UTC,"Really happy for the Howard.  Hopefully this isn't a mirage(it probably is to an extent).  The abuse he's taken over the years from this fan base and front office this winter is just ridiculous.  Especially when the sacred fucking cow next to him walks on fucking water.  Oh poor Chase.  It's not his fault his knees broke down.  He's a Philly guy.  Fuck him and fuck every asshole who booed Howard when he struck out, but genuflects at the altar of St. Chase."
phillies,36rw8u,hakan_loob44,1 point,Fri May 22 00:22:47 2015 UTC,"He can't keep up the production he's been giving us, but he can definitely be decent this year."
phillies,36rw8u,Trainwrek,1 point,Fri May 22 01:02:51 2015 UTC,"I've always loved Ryan, and I always hope he can turn it around. But while Chase isn't perfect, he also never had such extremes over his career. Ryan went from so good with so much potential to below average, and it seemed like there were things that could have been fixed. He definitely hasn't gotten the same slack that Chase has when it comes to injuries, but there were times where Ryan just seemed... stubborn (i.e., didn't work on his stance or swing, and instead just kept flailing at any breaking pitch).   I truly think this year is showing much more of the Ryan Howard that could have been. He slimmed down, worked really hard, changed his stance and his approach. He's proved over the last few weeks that he still can be a threat. Unfortunately for him, he's carried the weight of a ridiculous contract on his shoulders for a while now (not that anyone should fault him - why shouldn't he take the money that's offered to him).  But all that being said, Chase isn't exactly the fairest comparison to make. Even when injured, he was still a .260 hitter that didn't strike out at a ridiculous pace. Ryan was a .220 hitter two of the last three years, and he struck out 190 times last year. There's a huge difference between the two, and it's pretty ridiculous to even compare them. Yeah, Chase isn't playing too well offensively this year, but I'm willing to give him more of the benefit of the doubt than I am Ryan."

phillies,36rw8u,ihorsey,2,Fri May 22 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"Not saying it can't be done, but saying ""it's not hard at all"" is a ridiculous understatement.  Does Howard have 10 and 5 rights yet?  If so, there's that.  Then there's finding an AL team willing to risk sending a decent prospect.  And of course, there's the Phillies ownership who may balk at the thought of paying a guy $75 million (or whatever he's due) to play against them for the next few years."
phillies,36rw8u,mp3528,1 point,Thu May 21 19:24:21 2015 UTC,"If we're not going to get a decent prospect in return then I'd rather him just stay here. He can't keep up the production he's been giving this month, but even if he only gives half of it I'll enjoy watching him play."

phillies,36rw8u,Mulsanne,1 point,Thu May 21 21:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a decent haul.  For an aging player at the end of his career at $13M on his last year it was a fucking incredible return.  Same for the Byrd trade.  Some people just talk out of their ass."

phillies,36s6if,thechurchofbradlidge,2,Thu May 21 21:54:38 2015 UTC,Well fuck...  I'm surprised we got out of there with only 3 runs scored...
phillies,36s6if,Rekkonin,2,Thu May 21 20:36:27 2015 UTC,"Jesus. I don't ever remember a team that gave back runs as immediately as this one does. Dammit, Jerome."
phillies,36s6if,finesthour12,2,Thu May 21 21:11:52 2015 UTC,Back to back games where a Phillies starter hasn't had a strikeout. Never a good thing.
phillies,36s6if,finesthour12,2,Thu May 21 21:24:21 2015 UTC,Well damn. Might as well start the beer run early
phillies,36s6if,DingusDeluxe,1 point,Thu May 21 21:49:46 2015 UTC,Early runs count boys! Here we go!
phillies,36s6if,Charmanderp7,1 point,Thu May 21 19:15:39 2015 UTC,"Taking that ""early"" lead!!"
phillies,36s6if,Rekkonin,1 point,Thu May 21 20:04:28 2015 UTC,Hell of a throw by Francouer there
phillies,36s6if,DingusDeluxe,1 point,Thu May 21 20:29:13 2015 UTC,Channeling his inner Brett Myers there.
phillies,36s6if,moneymoneymoneymonay,1 point,Thu May 21 20:43:09 2015 UTC,"Is it too much to ask for Galvis to get something?  Also, here's where everyone should scapegoat me for jinxing it. I don't really mind."
phillies,36s6if,Rekkonin,1 point,Thu May 21 20:43:18 2015 UTC,"Wilson, it's alright. Don't let one little point get you rattled."
phillies,36s6if,Rekkonin,1 point,Thu May 21 21:10:50 2015 UTC,Fuck. Williams you suck
phillies,36s6if,Charmanderp7,1 point,Thu May 21 21:11:54 2015 UTC,SHIT JEROME GET IT TOGETHER
phillies,36s6if,DingusDeluxe,1 point,Thu May 21 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"Well...  ...yeah, I'm not sure how to keep hope... Maybe we'll get lucky and the rockies will start making a bunch of mistakes...?"
phillies,36s6if,Rekkonin,2,Thu May 21 21:35:14 2015 UTC,Logan is hittable. Think we gotta get at least 1 here.
phillies,36s6if,finesthour12,1 point,Thu May 21 21:41:32 2015 UTC,1 for 9 with RISP.
phillies,36s6if,finesthour12,1 point,Thu May 21 21:48:27 2015 UTC,This pitching sucks
phillies,36s6if,Charmanderp7,1 point,Thu May 21 21:54:59 2015 UTC,Great... getting that double play like a pro...
phillies,36s6if,Rekkonin,1 point,Thu May 21 22:27:03 2015 UTC,"I really thought we had a chance there...........in other news though, Utley looks like he has a little more confidence at the plate than in April"
phillies,36schx,shoresfront,6,Thu May 21 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"Frankse and LA are great. Stairs I don't mind. He's kind of amusing and surprisingly analytical when it comes to hitting. I like Schmidt because he's Michael. Jack. Schmidt. And he provides a perspective from a different era.     I don't like McCarthy's delivery or ""gee shucks"" on air persona. I have no opinion on Ben Davis. I like Bottalico simply because he inspired Esotericky Bottalico."
phillies,36schx,liquidcloud9,4,Thu May 21 21:42:59 2015 UTC,I love the homerism of LA on the radio.
phillies,36schx,funkyted,3,Thu May 21 22:12:00 2015 UTC,"I actively disliked Tom McCarthy for like half a season after Harry Kalas died, but spending two or three hundred hours a year listening to a dude talk at you will soften anyone's heart, lol.  Also, I wish Jamie Moyer was still in the booth from time to time. I don't think he was a great broadcaster or anything, but I liked hearing his baseball takes."
phillies,36schx,jnapieralski,3,Thu May 21 20:14:52 2015 UTC,"Jamie Moyer had a terrible voice for broadcasting.  I like the guy as much as the next Phillies fan, but I'm glad that they replaced him with Ben Davis.  Who I believe, is terrific."
phillies,36schx,RicsFlair,3,Thu May 21 20:33:41 2015 UTC,I can listen to Scott and Larry while watching the video thanks to MLB.tv. That is one of its best features.
phillies,36schx,Phil_Agate,1 point,Fri May 22 00:31:08 2015 UTC,"Tom McCarthy is the typical national tv kind of guy, and while I think he's good he just doesn't have that ""hometown"" vibe that Harry oozed. Honestly, the booth got decent when Ben Davis started. Matt Stairs sucks, and I love to see them team up Davis with a pitcher that has a pretty cool attitude...like a Brett Myers or something."
phillies,36pd7c,Jayyburdd,7,Thu May 21 01:42:32 2015 UTC,"I did some crappy crops of the pictures, in case a mod wants to resize them and add them as flairs.  Stock Photo  Jobu Torito  Regular Torito"
phillies,36pd7c,15thStreet,5,Thu May 21 02:57:56 2015 UTC,The first one is the winner
phillies,36pd7c,stevenland2,3,Thu May 21 04:11:18 2015 UTC,I can dig them. Good job finding such an accurate stock photo.
phillies,36pd7c,15thStreet,1 point,Thu May 21 03:03:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was surprisingly easy. I typed in El Torito into twitter and it was the first thing that came up.  I wasn't going to look too hard, but luckily I didn't have to."
phillies,36pd7c,otatoptroy,7,Thu May 21 03:07:39 2015 UTC,"More importantly, where is our Freddy Galvis flair?"
phillies,36pd7c,TheSubversive,1 point,Thu May 21 04:33:16 2015 UTC,"No one wants to admit that things like Galvis hitting over .300 and Herrera being an awesome pick up and Howard turning it around and Harang doing awesome because it makes them look really fucking stupid because ""galvis can't hit for shit"" and ""The front office is inept"" and ""Great pick up, Harang is another loser"" and ""Howard sucks.""  Now they have to eat their words and admit that they don't know shit.  Those players doing well means that the biggest moron in professional sports was way smarter than they were."
phillies,36pd7c,TheSubversive,3,Thu May 21 21:28:24 2015 UTC,"Can we get a little pat on the back for the front office?  They literally pulled this guy out of thin air and gave the team a very nice player.  He's young and its early but everything about this kid seems like he has a future as, at the very least, an average regular...and we haven't even seen him play his life-long position."
phillies,36pd7c,Rekkonin,1 point,Thu May 21 12:09:09 2015 UTC,"This is a good idea! I like having a variety of flair to pick from and I think el torito is a good choice for an addition.  I mean... I'll still probably just use this one, but whatever... It's neat!"
phillies,36oxv6,PhilsBot,10,Wed May 20 23:46:19 2015 UTC,I don't want to jinx it.....but Franco is making me really excited for the future.....dude has such a sweet swing
phillies,36oxv6,bootchmagoo,8,Thu May 21 01:02:58 2015 UTC,The kind of swing that can make a chopper up the middle a base hit. Power + contact.
phillies,36oxv6,Jayyburdd,9,Thu May 21 01:06:04 2015 UTC,Franco even has a pretty damn good arm over there at third as well....when did he get that arm? i'm being a Franco dick rider since the call up...but there hasn't been much to get excited about lately in Phillies land outside of what we may get for Harang.
phillies,36oxv6,bootchmagoo,3,Thu May 21 01:20:02 2015 UTC,He was always known for his arm and fielding. The only negatives defensively were range related.
phillies,36oxv6,faithdies,2,Thu May 21 02:23:40 2015 UTC,Watching him last year.....it didn't seem like his arm was that strong
phillies,36oxv6,bootchmagoo,9,Thu May 21 02:48:43 2015 UTC,Ruiz coming up with the bases loaded. OH BOY
phillies,36oxv6,LongJohnErd,3,Thu May 21 00:59:39 2015 UTC,Aand an out

phillies,36oxv6,Jayyburdd,7,Thu May 21 01:41:41 2015 UTC,"Guys, we need Galvis in the All Star Game. Seriously, this guy is tearing it up!"
phillies,36oxv6,Charmanderp7,4,Thu May 21 01:42:24 2015 UTC,One of the most underrated SS in the league right now
phillies,36oxv6,bootchmagoo,5,Thu May 21 01:44:16 2015 UTC,One of the most underrated players period. No one knows who Galvis is despite his offensive and defensive prowess.

phillies,36oxv6,Jayyburdd,6,Thu May 21 02:41:00 2015 UTC,Chooch can hit. He just cannot clutch.
phillies,36oxv6,Jayyburdd,5,Thu May 21 03:05:03 2015 UTC,Please don't fall apart in these last two. I have much phaith in Giles and Papelbon.

phillies,36oxv6,Jayyburdd,2,Thu May 21 02:08:10 2015 UTC,Pretty damn awesome catch. Where did Herrera come from? Francoeur really has a great arm too.

phillies,36oxv6,Improvinator,1 point,Thu May 21 01:00:43 2015 UTC,it'd be nice to see Ruiz make that an 8 game streak with this at bat

phillies,36kzcp,finesthour12,2,Wed May 20 04:02:30 2015 UTC,The ghost town that is /r/phillies has a few tumbleweeds blowin' down main street.
phillies,36kzcp,Choooooch,7,Thu May 21 12:43:31 2015 UTC,Ruiz has to be the most unclutch hitter on the team. Every fucking time with the bases loaded he fucking grounds it right to an infielder. What the fuck is he ever thinking? It's like every time there's a big situation he gets inside his own head and forgets how to hit.
phillies,36kzcp,LongJohnErd,16,Wed May 20 04:00:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it worked that one time in the World Series."
phillies,36kzcp,15thStreet,5,Wed May 20 04:21:31 2015 UTC,"I wish he struck out on that at bat. I really do, and that's bad."
phillies,36kzcp,LongJohnErd,1 point,Wed May 20 04:01:05 2015 UTC,The pitch he got wasn't even a hard pitch to elevate. Fastball about thigh high. He could've easily lifted it into the outfield for at least a sac fly. That's the third time this season he's grounded out with the bases loaded and one out. Might as well start Rupp from now on. At least he's got an arm.
phillies,36kzcp,CdobsRU,3,Wed May 20 04:04:41 2015 UTC,"Have to agree, he is quite the opposite of clutch.  However, his real value comes from his skill as a catcher (calling pitches, heads up plays, and throwing runners out)"
phillies,36kzcp,Sardoodledum,4,Wed May 20 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"Rupp has that down pretty well too, though."
phillies,36kzcp,Trainwrek,2,Wed May 20 17:39:47 2015 UTC,"sad to say, but I think Chooch is done."
phillies,36kzcp,TU_Pride,2,Wed May 20 17:37:13 2015 UTC,"I know this team can't win the division, but if they can hover around .500 till the all star break fooling me into thinking the team can be good that isn't so bad. I assume after that Howard and Cole will be dealt and we'll be really bad."
phillies,36kzcp,DrumstickVT,3,Thu May 21 05:27:50 2015 UTC,"I'm just scared, you know. It's not so much about losing this game. I have just been a Phillies fan long enough to know that this team drops after winning streaks. They absolutely drop. There's no scatter plot of wins and losses. I'm really scared that all 6 of these losses will be erased by a losing streak."
phillies,36kzcp,TheGoldCrow,2,Wed May 20 04:04:43 2015 UTC,They will because this team isn't very good... That doesn't make this win streak less fun

phillies,36kzcp,Mulsanne,1 point,Wed May 20 22:25:27 2015 UTC,So you're saying we should just wait til August to start watching games? Every game counts dude.
phillies,36kzcp,TheMightyCatatafish,1 point,Thu May 21 15:33:40 2015 UTC,"I still want to get the 1st pick, though. There isn't really any hope of the post season. So if they're going to be bad, I want them to excel at being terrible and grab that first round pick! There's nothing good that comes from finishing in 3rd a few games under .500, ya know?"
phillies,36kzcp,ItsTimToBegin,5,Wed May 20 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"The team has an obligation to all of the fans who have purchased/will purchase tickets and to their broadcast affiliates (Comcast gave them a lot of money) to put the best possible product out on the field. Tanking does nothing for anybody and I'd rather see us finish in third a little under .500 than contend for the worst record in the league. Where is the fun in that? I can't stand this ""tanking"" mentality as it just rewards teams for giving two big middle fingers to the fans."
phillies,36kzcp,Mulsanne,-3,Wed May 20 20:08:45 2015 UTC,"Got news for ya, the team already gave you those middle fingers starting wayyyy back in 2012. They are not good, there is no collection of events that will make them good this year. That ship sailed, caught fire, and burned as it sank.  However, have you seen that Bryce Harper kid? Wouldn't you like to get a talent like that on our club? Yeah, you would. #1 draft picks do that.  So we can either hope for mediocrity and a mediocre pick. Or we can hope for exceptional badness and an exceptional pick.   Tanking does nothing for anybody    Except getting a good draft pick, like I said. The thing that actually does nothing, is hoping for any sort of goodness from this season and thinking that finishing in third with 78 wins is somehow a good, productive thing. That's pennywise and pound foolish.    Where is the fun in that?   If you came into '15 hoping for fun, I've got some more bad news for you...  Look the best thing the team can do is maximize the strength and speed of the rebuild. Getting the #1 pick is the best way to do that this season outside of trading Hamels, Harrang and Howard."
phillies,36kzcp,deadnside,3,Wed May 20 20:16:23 2015 UTC,"Baseball is a different animal entirely. The MLB draft isn't like any other. There's top tier talent EVERYWHERE. It's just so hard to pin point where. More than any other sport, it's nearly impossible to figure out which players will pan out. Like Harper, some are more obvious than others, but they are truly once in a generation draft prospects. Angels didn't need to tank to get Mike Trout. He went at 20. Let's look at the Phillies World Series contributors: Howard went in the 4th round. Hamels was 17th overall, Rollins was a 2nd rounder, Utley went at 15, Victorino was a rule 5 pick. You know who was the only 1st overall pick on that team? Pat Burrell. Solid contributor, sure. But I don't think anyone would compare him to Bryce Harper. And i certainly don't think any team would consider a tanked season for Pat Burrell a smart move.  Going back to 1990, the #1 overall pick has been a total crapshoot: 50/50 top tier talent. There's the occasional once in a lifetime Harper or A-Rod, some all star players like Strasburg, some solid pieces like Darin Erstad, then the other half of the guys never panned out at all.  Tanking in baseball for draft picks doesn't work. Where you finish the season will not help or hurt you in the draft, and if it helps in any way it will be minimal. What helps teams like the Nats and Pirates rebuild? Smart trades for their veterans. Assemble well regarded prospects. Get good value for your seasoned vets. Howard right now is reestablishing his value, thank God. Hamels is worth a big haul. Harang is a $5 mil investment that, if he keeps up, can turn out to be quite the signing when we unload him for a good prospect or two.  Tanking to get a good draft pick IS useless. The draft is too unpredictable in baseball. It's a long road between draft day and the MLB. If they even get there. Tanking helps no one. If your team does poorly because you've sold off valuable pieces for rebuilding prospects, then so it goes. But those guys who are still on the team, the young inexperienced pieces you have left, will use that time to develop and adjust to the bigs. They SHOULD try to win. That's how they get better. Finishing 3rd with 78 is fine. That puts you right around pick 15. Draft smart and develop him right, that pick can be better than #1. After all, our first WS since '80 came with a lot of talent that came from that point in the draft on."
phillies,36km97,Imissmybear,8,Wed May 20 02:00:28 2015 UTC,This season got fun all of a sudden.
phillies,36km97,15thStreet,6,Wed May 20 02:17:10 2015 UTC,"Things like this are a great example of why I am enjoying this season much more than last year...  Without hindsight it was tough to predict how awful things would be in 2012, 2013 you could trick yourself into thinking with some tweaks we wouldn't be god awful (we were), 2014 just felt like a bunch of veterans going through the motions and it was often just super depressing to watch. In 2015 I have no delusions that we're going to be in the wild card hunt but at least we have some young players that seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves and providing a glimpse of a fun future.   Just remember that its the summer time and we've got baseball that is fun to watch at the moment. It will be sad to see the last of WS core to leave but its an exciting time for this team for the first time in 3-4 years so it could be worse."

phillies,36ihx8,CaligulasBallSack,8,Tue May 19 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"His stats are unsustainable, you are right.   Look at it this way. If he splits the difference of his May average and his season average he would be at .286/.345/.535 which is still pretty beastly.   Expect a regression greater than that but things are looking up that Howard could be traded."
phillies,36ihx8,envriogis,6,Tue May 19 18:05:09 2015 UTC,Would like Howard to succeed this season just as a big fuck you to Amaro for his comments about Howard in the offseason. He might be right that the Phillies would be better off without Howard's contract but he didn't really phrase it that way and it's not a great thing to say about your own player.
phillies,36ihx8,drwhosonfirst,7,Tue May 19 23:02:37 2015 UTC,"That is the big thing to.  I love Howard.  He was such a big part of our team.  He was a good, likable player.  Howard has never been the problem.  We knew he had flaws, but when he was younger and healthier they weren't as big of a deal.  It's the contract that is disliked.  It's Amaro for rewarding past honors, not future production.  It's Amaro for not adapting to how baseball teams were being built.  It's Amaro for not looking at the past history and decline of strongers after 30.    Howard is a great Phillie.  I have no problem with him and I'm so happy he is playing well."
phillies,36ihx8,smiller121,1 point,Tue May 19 23:48:20 2015 UTC,"Pretty cool to see. If I'm a contender I'd play him at first or DH against all right handers. When he's hot you play him everyday. If we eat enough money, we could get a decent return."
phillies,36ihx8,ihorsey,0,Tue May 19 20:01:04 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm just enjoying the win streak and the unexpected production from Howard. If the Phillies actually get something of value in a trade, I'd be pleasantly surprised."
phillies,36ihx8,TheSubversive,0,Tue May 19 21:31:32 2015 UTC,"Really, I say fuck the decent return just take him and his salary...or as much of it as I can get you to take.  Unfortunately getting out from under that contract should be/will be/probably can only be all they can hope for.  And I think the Phillies front office has done more to damage his trade value than maybe even his play has."
phillies,36ihx8,Motherlicka,-17,Wed May 20 00:37:32 2015 UTC,You know you've only been watching baseball for a few years when a guy making 20 million a year can get away with a 0 WAR. Congrats on never hating a guy who had been making 20 million to produce less than a replacement level player.

phillies,36im1m,TheSwampDweller,5,Tue May 19 17:39:17 2015 UTC,The thought is that Revere will be expendable in Philadelphia's outfielder once Cody Asche and Domonic Brown return from the minors. Rosenthal notes that the Angels have shown interest in the past. Revere is making $4.1 million this season and is under team control though 2017
phillies,36im1m,Smartfood_Fo_Lyfe,10,Tue May 19 17:39:40 2015 UTC,"That sucks. I love Revere. His passion for the game and the team is really awesome. Plus, I think he's a better overall player than Asche."
phillies,36im1m,CrumbThumber,5,Tue May 19 21:20:49 2015 UTC,What could possibly the return on a player like Revere? Could you get a teams top 15 prospect?
phillies,36im1m,envriogis,4,Tue May 19 19:06:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe a top 20. It may not seem like much but Revere is 27, under team control and probably at his peak in terms of trade value. It's really better than nothing."
phillies,36im1m,Jayyburdd,1 point,Tue May 19 19:08:20 2015 UTC,And I don't remember the Angels being high up in the prospect game to begin with.

phillies,36im1m,Charmanderp7,11,Wed May 20 12:38:22 2015 UTC,"Aww man, I like Revere. Wait until we get a spot for LF. Ruben will probably get us Josh Hamilton. Or he will ask for Trout"

phillies,36im1m,ihorsey,1 point,Tue May 19 20:36:45 2015 UTC,"He's starting to heat up, but probably around the draft/ trade deadline."
phillies,36im1m,sjphilsphan,1 point,Tue May 19 21:04:26 2015 UTC,I don't consider what he is doing heating up. Still 0 power ops is below 700. Leave him to rot in AAA

phillies,36im1m,JoFlo520,3,Tue May 19 17:40:46 2015 UTC,If we trade him who is more likely to play LF? Cody Asche or Dom Brown or someone else?
phillies,36im1m,Smartfood_Fo_Lyfe,6,Tue May 19 21:09:54 2015 UTC,"Cody is being groomed for LF, according to reports."
phillies,36im1m,JoFlo520,2,Tue May 19 21:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know that but does anyone know how long this ""grooming period"" is going to take?  Will he be back in time to replace Ben Revere if he is traded around the deadline?"
phillies,36im1m,15thStreet,1 point,Tue May 19 21:44:31 2015 UTC,Almost certainly. And Brown should eventually be taking over playing time in right field.
phillies,36im1m,klombo120,1 point,Wed May 20 02:22:35 2015 UTC,I would like Ashe out there but they seem to always want to keep trying with Dom. Idk why ...

phillies,36im1m,jatethegreat,1 point,Wed May 20 11:56:50 2015 UTC,Frankly I think it's ridiculous that anyone sees more potential in Brown than they do Revere. Brown has proven to be ineffective in every outfield position and his offense is terribly inconsistent. He is at best a AAAA-level ball player; too good for the minors but not good enough for the majors. I'd take Revere over Brown any day.

phillies,36gacn,Improvinator,11,Tue May 19 03:58:40 2015 UTC,"Four game sweep on the road to extend it to a 9 game total win streak is pretty improbable, but we are playing the right team if we're gonna do it, so it's not impossible. It would be huge with the Nats and Mets series coming up. This win streak with those two series coming up has gotten me more excited for Phillies baseball than I have been in a while. I'm not sure how the matchups are gonna lineup without looking into it, and call me a dreamer, but how cool would it be if it ended up being Hamels vs Harvey with the two teams bidding for first place? I don't care if it's only May, it feels great to have the Phillies winning some games again!"

Fifth in the league for BA, tied second in the league for hits, tied first for triples, and leads the league in steals (19), 7 more than the second place leader."
phillies,36f70p,VanillaHail,6,Tue May 19 00:33:06 2015 UTC,Is this what it feels like to be hopeful and excited for the future of the Phillies?
phillies,36f70p,MajorSuccess,3,Tue May 19 05:21:19 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of reasons to be excited you just have to ignore the ever-popular narrative and the people who let their hatred ruin the conversation.  The Phillies have a few excellent pieces in the minors in Quinn, Crawford, Nola, Lively, etc.. and they have some young guys they've already brought up.  Now add them to the hauls that they should get for Hamels, Harang (if he keeps it up), Ruiz and maybe even Papelbon and they system will get even better.  If Howard keeps it going we'll be out from under his contract maybe sooner than expected as well and just maybe they get a solid offer on one of their releivers not named Giles.  But it doesn't end there.  The Phillies have something a lot of teams don't have - financial flexibility.  They can outspend a lot of other teams and the owners have seen very recently what happens if they field a winning ball club, and that's $$$$$$$$$$$$$.  That financial flexibility allows them to do what teams like The Astros or The Rays can't do and that's go out and BUY the pieces they didn't grow to field a Championship caliber  team.  That money can turn a 6-8 year rebuild into a 3-5 year rebuild."

phillies,36cqb2,joeblow33,1 point,Tue May 19 00:25:05 2015 UTC,We'll sev is obvious. Joely because of his level. And then lively has the most experience of everyone in double AA right now. Just a guess I suppose.
phillies,36cqb2,ihorsey,1 point,Tue May 19 00:29:35 2015 UTC,"Lively is behind Nola at Double-A due to performance, Joely hasn't earned a promotion to the MLB, Aumont is probably next if he keeps pitching well, and Severino is first but only as a fill-in."
phillies,36cqb2,ihorsey,1 point,Tue May 19 22:10:30 2015 UTC,They aren't likely to start Nola's service time though. Lively more a back end starter who is mlb ready. They might be willing to start his clock.

phillies,369vjn,flyersfan0233,8,Sun May 17 16:30:35 2015 UTC,I'm just tired of moving guys to the outfield. They're moving pieces around rather than admitting that some pieces just aren't good enough. I understand it more in this case since both are 3B prospects who could have a future with the team. It still annoys me though.
phillies,369vjn,tracks28,4,Sun May 17 18:15:23 2015 UTC,I say teach asche second base.  What happens when Utley leaves?
phillies,369vjn,TheAntagonisticDildo,3,Sun May 17 19:13:32 2015 UTC,I thought they moved Herrera to the outfield?
phillies,369vjn,TheAntagonisticDildo,4,Sun May 17 19:29:12 2015 UTC,"They did and I'm not sure they have any intention of ever having him move back to second, seeing as they didn't give him a single inning there during spring training. Then again, they didn't have Asche play an inning in the outfield, either."
phillies,369vjn,15thStreet,3,Sun May 17 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"You don't move guys up the defensive spectrum if they can't handle their current position. Based on how poorly he played at 3rd and the failed experiment at second in the minors, Asche shouldn't have been given a shot at second really. The only place that he has a shot to play every day is LF."
phillies,369vjn,TheRedViper1,3,Sun May 17 20:17:27 2015 UTC,Asche was a brutal defender at second when he was in the minors so they moved him to third. He's bad at third and his flaws there would only be enhanced by a move to 2B.
phillies,369vjn,MrMountie,20,Sun May 17 20:25:29 2015 UTC,It seems to me that the Phils mishandle nearly all situations.  I am not surprised by this one.
phillies,369vjn,Bilbringi9,-1,Sun May 17 21:36:53 2015 UTC,This. Of course they mishandled it. Since Amaro has been GM the organization has objectively mishandled one situation after another.
phillies,369vjn,Aqua-Tech,3,Sun May 17 17:05:16 2015 UTC,"I get that Asche needs reps at left field. There were certainly other ways to handle that. But he was batting well and I feel like what this accomplished most was a blow to his confidence. Hearing his comments, he sounded so dejected. I don't see how that's helpful for a young guy to abruptly move him when he's finding his groove."
phillies,369vjn,PlasticSky,3,Sun May 17 17:24:42 2015 UTC,"That's what I don't understand.  They knew they had Franco, so spend time in Spring Training working with Asche in the outfield.  Of course they could do the same thing to Asche that they did to Ruf, which is have him spend time learning left field, and then the day of the game say, ""Oh by the way, you're playing RIGHT field today."""
phillies,369vjn,Sardoodledum,9,Sun May 17 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"No, Asche had more than enough time to prove himself at 3B and he didn't."
phillies,369vjn,SeeYouAtTheMovies,8,Sun May 17 19:25:11 2015 UTC,clearly you didn't even read the article
phillies,369vjn,le_fez,3,Mon May 18 02:51:51 2015 UTC,Asche wasn't performing his part and everyone knew it. It was always a thought that he would be in LF. It makes sense that they brought up Franco since his numbers this year are outstanding. This move was smart and you cant judge it based on 2 games.
phillies,369vjn,Charmanderp7,9,Sun May 17 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"The point they're trying to make is that if all of what you said is true, there was no reason Asche should have began the year at 3rd. He should have been playing LF all during the Spring and never had to be sent down to learn a new position."
phillies,369vjn,Aqua-Tech,3,Sun May 17 23:03:51 2015 UTC,Bingo  But instead this team signs guys like francour to take up room in the outfield
phillies,369vjn,carpisxxx,4,Sun May 17 17:23:04 2015 UTC,Don't have too big a problem with Francoeur around. Seems like he's a good clubhouse guy. Now Sizemore? That probably was the guy they shouldn't have signed and is taking up room.
phillies,369vjn,15thStreet,2,Sun May 17 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"I think there was a small chance Asche was going to keep his third base job and force Franco to first base, if he played well enough.   Also, we had a logjam already in the outfield with Herrera and Brown needing to get at-bats out there and Revere claiming a starting spot as the only above average OF on the roster. Meanwhile, we had no other true third baseman on the roster.   Asche should have been taking reps and practicing the position before last week (I don't know if he was or not), but third base was the best way to get a young guy at-bats while not interfering with other spots."
phillies,369vjn,Aqua-Tech,3,Sun May 17 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"Franco is considered a top-3 3rd base prospect in all of baseball, he is a MUCH better fielder, and has a stronger and more accurate arm. I really don't see how they could want to move him to an unnatural position lile first, especially when they have a line of guys, young and old, that could play first."
phillies,369vjn,15thStreet,1 point,Sun May 17 17:52:29 2015 UTC,"As of now, it makes no sense, but if Asche was playing really well and looked like he could be a good, major league third basemen for years to come, then it could make some sense to move Franco to first.  Franco's bat could play well enough to justify keeping him at first and it's not like his defense would go entirely to waste there. And you'd be setting yourself up to get good offensive production from two infield spots for years to come.   Of course, it's a moot point now that Asche hasn't been playing like a major leaguer at all, but I think there was a scenario where we could have had both these guys in the infield by keeping Asche at a position where an ~.800 OPS was acceptable."
phillies,369vjn,LexiconDevil402,1 point,Sun May 17 20:12:56 2015 UTC,yes
phillies,369vjn,Ship_of_Fools26,1 point,Sun May 17 20:17:56 2015 UTC,"I think Asche was going to be disappointed either way. He played in 121 games last year, and even if he started in AAA this year, it would've sent the message that he's not good enough to nail down a roster spot out of spring training on the worst team in baseball. The Phillies most likely kept him in the bigs at 3B to see if he performed well enough for another team to ask about him in a trade. He didn't, so now the only way he gets back is at another position. The Phillies didn't mishandle this at all."
phillies,369vjn,TheSubversive,1 point,Sun May 17 23:55:13 2015 UTC,"Not sure why anyone would think this situation was mishandled.  Has Cody Asche said something?  Has he voiced his disappointment?  Did someone on here actually talk to him?  As far as I can tell he seems okay with it.  He's been sent to the minors for a short time to learn the basics of another position.  I believe his salary is guaranteed because of the time he spent with the big league team last year so that's not an issue.  Seriously, for all we know he could be psyched that he's getting to learn another position and that the organization cares enough about him to give him the opportunity."
phillies,369vjn,15thStreet,2,Sun May 17 19:32:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a big deal, but he did say he was surprised by the move when he was first sent down. Which is kind of weird, because you'd think they'd give him a heads up beforehand.  Otherwise, who cares? He was struggling anyway, still gets every day at bats and will get his chance to come back to the big leagues as soon as he learns the position. The bigger deal is Dom Brown wasting away in Lehigh Valley with no light at the end of the tunnel after being named the starting RF at the end of spring training.    Seriously, for all we know he could be psyched that he's getting to learn another position and that the organization cares enough about him to give him the opportunity.   David Murphy has quotes form him in the past talking about the need for players to be versatile to help the team. So I'd bet he's definitely open to learning the position, but just blindsided by the fact that he was sent down in the middle of the year to do so."

And I'm usually one of the first people ready to knock Ruben and front office.  But man, Franco's development has been handled very ....KNOCK ON WOOD... well.  GO PHILS."
phillies,36222x,RicsFlair,1 point,Fri May 15 18:48:12 2015 UTC,He has been hitting the ball very well here in the Valley. I haven't seen a top prospect perform as well as he has with the Pigs in a long time.
phillies,364t25,Fitzelli,9,Sat May 16 03:36:21 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people will say they're bad and they are but I like to be optimistic. They're rebuilding and have a few pieces that they can really count on. Galvis, Herrera, Franco, Nola they're all guys that they think can replace the core that gave us that glorious moment in 2008. And harang and papelbon have been killin it so far. Harang is gonna turn out as a great signing cuz his contract is easy to get rid of and he's been solid. Look for him to get moved for a few okay prospects at the trade deadline to a contender without a #4.   Also Ben revere. He's made a great transition as a corner outfielder. He went from noodle arm to a legit threat to throw runners out. Also he's pretty fast."
phillies,364t25,bsmall07,2,Sat May 16 03:47:41 2015 UTC,What he said. Spot on.
phillies,364t25,toddrob,2,Sat May 16 13:30:24 2015 UTC,"I think the games I've been to have been fun this season, but I love the Phillies. Howard has hit some fun homers. They've had some good pitcher outings. The youngins are exciting to watch like early 2000s teams before '07. Only really sad thing has been Utley."
phillies,364t25,funkyted,4,Sat May 16 20:59:37 2015 UTC,Be sure to watch Odubel Herrara(CF) Freddy Galvis(SS) and Makiel Franco(3B). The rest of the team isnt that fun. Howards doing good this season while Utley is batting around .100. We traded Rollins in the offseason to the Dodgers so Galvis is starting SS. Galvis is batting around. 350 which is amazing
phillies,364t25,Charmanderp7,2,Sat May 16 13:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yup. In addition, Galvis is one of the best defenders in the league. He could claim the starting 2b job for the next 5 years if he keeps this up. Or they could move Crawford to 2nd. I wouldn't though."
phillies,364t25,ihorsey,1 point,Sat May 16 21:36:12 2015 UTC,"In retrospect it's funny cause Herrera, Galvis and Franco combined to go 1-for-12 in this one while the old guard (Howard, Utley, and Chooch) were 6-for-12 with 3 doubles, 4 RBI and 3 runs. I was glad I went; felt like old times."
phillies,364t25,Darko33,2,Mon May 18 13:46:10 2015 UTC,Crash course: They're doing pretty lousy. Enjoy the game.
phillies,3620li,feeked,2,Fri May 15 12:56:27 2015 UTC,"I'm tired of all the Utley apologists and analysis that says he's just having ""bad luck"" the guy has lost most of his bat speed and seems like he's forgotten how to do anything but pull the ball. Pitchers are working him outside and he's trying to pull everything which means grounder to third or pop up to right. He flat out has lost it."
phillies,3620li,le_fez,3,Sun May 17 23:09:58 2015 UTC,I think Lou Gehrig has that title.

phillies,3620li,metssuck,2,Fri May 15 18:05:16 2015 UTC,I know you were trying to make a joke but his being on this team has nothing to do with luck. He wants to be here and would probably veto any trade.
phillies,3620li,sokrazyitmightwork,1 point,Fri May 15 20:51:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, it was a total joke.  I get that he doesn't want to leave, but I doubt that come July he'd veto a trade to someone in California who was in a pennant race"
phillies,3620li,metssuck,4,Sat May 16 01:25:20 2015 UTC,Nate Silver is the man.  Amazing analysis. Thanks for sharing.
phillies,3620li,VictorERink,2,Fri May 15 13:49:50 2015 UTC,Yeah the man knows his statistics.  I hope he's right regarding Utley.  I hate watching my 2nd favorite player (behind only Schmidt) struggle so much.  It makes me sad.
phillies,3620li,deadnside,-2,Fri May 15 14:42:14 2015 UTC,I keep leaning more to the theory that he and Rollins are a matched set and just don't work separately.  It does make sense and explains everything.

You even get to eat at that separate little section in the diamond club.  I know how is.  2008-2014 a family members business had split season tickets in diamond club and I would go to like 20-25 games a year there.  The fucking tickets even had $30 park credit (not food, PARK meaning merchandise too) on them and he would just give them to us all season long.  Told him not to bother getting them this year and he didn't."

phillies,35za6q,TheSubversive,2,Fri May 15 02:01:08 2015 UTC,"We were row 8 and had the $30 credit.  Are you telling me you had unlimited free food and alcohol but no merch?  We would get 4 tickets with $30 each on them and none of us ever drank.  We couldn't spend that much on food.  I would take all the extra money and go to Majestic and just buy whatever to use the money.  Needless to say I have a ton of Phillies merchandise hanging around.  My son was born last year and he had literally every baby item there was.  We even got stuff for him up until he was 2 but he grew too quick (he's 18 months and in 3T) so we gave a lot of it away.  Those seats are amazing though and I know you had a blast.  G is over near 1st base right?  Near the authenticator?  Man, I remember seeing Halladay pitch from there and just being amazed, like floored, watching his pitches attack the plate from every direction.  I still think about that a lot.  Did you check out the view of the batting cages underneath?"
phillies,35za6q,TrustMePunk,1 point,Fri May 15 02:14:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no merch, I asked. We ate and drank at least a couple hundred dollars worth each, though, and we had a waitress bringing it to us.   G is towards first, but we were still behind the net and before the dugout. The on deck circle was in front and slightly to the right of us, so we were never more than 15-20' away from whoever was on deck.  The cages were pretty cool. I saw Francour hit a few, but I didn't discover them til the 7th."

For the casual football fan, A 42-38 game with a ton of touchdowns and big plays is more fun to watch then a 3-6 defensive struggle. Same thing goes with basketball. We love dunks and high scoring games at all levels of basketball. Whether we like it or not home runs are easily the most exciting part of baseball, more so then excellent pitching. The casual baseball fan isn't going to want to sit through guys constantly making outs with maybe a couple of scoring plays a game.  Need to find a way to make the game more marketable or it really eventually is going to die."
phillies,360fn4,NDPhilly,1 point,Fri May 15 04:30:51 2015 UTC,I think triples are the most exciting without any weird bounces for a Ryan Howard type and with a bang-bang play at third with a fleet runner.

Phillippe Aumont is surprisingly dominant. Brock Stassi is hitting well. There's a load of guys down there that are batting a best-case-scenario start to the season thus far. There are plenty of guys I haven't mentioned. Our farm is awesome so far, and there are definitely some names in there that should stay awesome. And we still have Hamels and Harang to trade. It's nothing to feel hopeless about, this team. It'll be a while, but we've got some guys down there."

phillies,35uiez,Hankmoody2r,3,Wed May 13 20:12:49 2015 UTC,Low strikeouts. But 3 walks is pretty good actually. Bottom line is 0 earned runs.
phillies,35uiez,drayb3,2,Wed May 13 21:09:10 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with this bottom line. He needs to have strong, consistent peripherals to show that he's improved. I'm not getting excited about Aumont just because he's getting some W's."
phillies,35ti4h,SuggestAPhotoProject,14,Wed May 13 11:24:44 2015 UTC,"You can only blame so much if this season in Ryno. The roster is awful and he can't be blamed for bad players playing badly. Having said that, his use of the bullpen has been awful and makes no sense and fundamentals still haven't improved (how many bunts have grounded into a double play?).  I wouldn't think Ryno gets fired until Amaro does and the new GM brings in their own guy."
phillies,35ti4h,Mjr334,4,Wed May 13 12:00:31 2015 UTC,"Earliest it happens is August/September - as with Charlie (i.e. with about a month left in the season, enough time to use someone internal on a trial basis).  But I'm not sure we really have someone in-house who is seen as the next-in-line as Sandberg was with Charlie.  I don't think we can blame this season on Sandberg, we're not even really into a rebuilding cycle yet, we're almost in more of a purgatory where we need to just play-out some rough contracts and restock the talent pipeline.  He could be the next managing savant and I don't think we would be more than a 70-win team with this roster.  MAYBE if he loses 100 games and the clubhouse is a mess he could get canned this year, but I'm still optimistic he can stay ahead of 100 losses and he's a good enough coach to hold the team together.  I think the trick is... can Sandberg suffer this year with the hand he's been dealt, hold his head high and keep the team motivated - find ways to pull a few unlikely wins, and show solid gains next year?"
phillies,35ti4h,disco_biscuit,4,Wed May 13 14:40:01 2015 UTC,I think you're optimistic that he'd be around long enough to get fired instead of quitting out of sheer despair first...
phillies,35ti4h,adamshell,10,Wed May 13 15:58:04 2015 UTC,Ryno? Forget him. When does Ruben get fired?
phillies,35ti4h,Ih8YourCat,-3,Wed May 13 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"Dude, we get it. Everyone in this sub hates RAJ. But OP is asking how long Ryno's leash is, which is a legitimate question. Can we stop circle-jerking already?"
phillies,35ti4h,DrumstickVT,11,Wed May 13 19:47:50 2015 UTC,I'll continue to express my disdain for him until he's out of office if I want to.

phillies,35ti4h,Jayyburdd,2,Thu May 14 20:30:17 2015 UTC,I think he deserves a chance to coach a team with potential before he's fired. Nobody good or even experienced would want to coach us right now.
phillies,35ti4h,mybrosteve,2,Wed May 13 21:22:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think he gets fired this year or next, unless RAJ goes first. Ryne came in with expectations of the team rebuilding and being bad. Unlike with Charlie where the team was expected to win, Ryne is the captain of the already-sunken ship."

phillies,35i5oq,jpar345,2,Sun May 10 18:38:30 2015 UTC,Is Franco doing anything in AAA though?
phillies,35i5oq,Jews-R-Us,5,Sun May 10 18:42:35 2015 UTC,"He's slashing .339/.362/.529 with 12 doubles and 3 HRs so far for AAA, plus his defense at 3B is superior. It'll be interesting to see what happens."
phillies,35i5oq,jpar345,3,Sun May 10 18:45:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, thank God, it's looking like Billingsley's first start was just a bad day."
phillies,35i5oq,Jayyburdd,3,Sun May 10 18:09:23 2015 UTC,BILLINGSLEY!!
phillies,35i5oq,mattyfressh,3,Sun May 10 18:16:14 2015 UTC,Well that wasn't expected...BILLINGSLEY
phillies,35i5oq,wertftw,3,Sun May 10 18:21:03 2015 UTC,Deja vu...
phillies,35i5oq,Jayyburdd,3,Sun May 10 18:46:58 2015 UTC,Billingsly lets them answer every time we score.
phillies,35i5oq,eschersnightmare,5,Sun May 10 18:47:32 2015 UTC,He threw a great 2-2 pitch that Granderson should've been rung up on.
phillies,35i5oq,Triple-Deke,3,Sun May 10 18:48:29 2015 UTC,I just don't understand hacking at the first pitch when this guy has walked 3 and just plunked Utley in his last two innings. Everybody had great ABs in that inning then Howard brainlessly flails at the first pitch. Jesus Christ if I were Larry Bowa I'd be laying into him.
phillies,35i5oq,jpar345,2,Sun May 10 20:03:49 2015 UTC,If I were Larry Bowa I'd be in jail for braining someone with a bat. Why the Hell isn't Bowa in jail? Maybe he's mellowed.
phillies,35i5oq,eschersnightmare,3,Sun May 10 20:16:38 2015 UTC,"Every time we score, we give those runs right back. Every fucking time."
phillies,35i5oq,finesthour12,8,Sun May 10 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"How is this fat fuck still pitching? Moreover, pitching well?  Colon, not Harang. Harang is amazing and a national treasure."
phillies,35i5oq,eschersnightmare,3,Sun May 10 18:01:40 2015 UTC,His face irritates me as much as his uniform.
phillies,35i5oq,Jayyburdd,3,Sun May 10 18:02:26 2015 UTC,Infuriating.
phillies,35i5oq,eschersnightmare,4,Sun May 10 18:06:13 2015 UTC,Phuck the Mets!
phillies,35i5oq,finesthour12,1 point,Sun May 10 17:13:55 2015 UTC,"Keep this hitting streak going, Chase!"
phillies,35i5oq,Jews-R-Us,1 point,Sun May 10 17:48:34 2015 UTC,Power hitter Chad Billingsley
phillies,35i5oq,Jews-R-Us,1 point,Sun May 10 18:16:18 2015 UTC,The Ball Girl has to take him out there...
phillies,35i5oq,eschersnightmare,1 point,Sun May 10 19:22:24 2015 UTC,Game got interesting again. Good baserunning by Cesar.
phillies,35i5oq,Jayyburdd,1 point,Sun May 10 19:49:46 2015 UTC,Now would be a hell of a time to break out of the slump
phillies,35i5oq,metssuck,1 point,Sun May 10 19:59:05 2015 UTC,That'll leave a mark.
phillies,35i5oq,eschersnightmare,1 point,Sun May 10 20:01:22 2015 UTC,that sounded painful
