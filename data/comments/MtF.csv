MtF,3e3ndl,mrtommins,16,Tue Jul 21 18:29:56 2015 UTC,Feeling attractive because goddammit you are. You're gorgeous
MtF,3e3ndl,LocksTheFox,7,Tue Jul 21 18:41:40 2015 UTC,"Hai, just a quick word about your flair - we're generally OK with blogs in the flair, but would it be OK if you removed your twitter handle? It's not a hard rule, but we'd appreciate it because in the past reddit has considered it personal information, whilst blogs aren't apparently.   Thanks!"
MtF,3e3ndl,LocksTheFox,3,Tue Jul 21 18:55:07 2015 UTC,Can do!  EDIT: Done!
MtF,3e3ndl,evidently_em,4,Tue Jul 21 18:58:05 2015 UTC,Thank you! :)
MtF,3e3ndl,evidently_em,3,Tue Jul 21 18:58:46 2015 UTC,Wait do the rules about personal information include myself? So could I be banned for posting information about myself?
MtF,3e3ndl,Sanctusorium,5,Tue Jul 21 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"Yup, and more than likely we would be banned for allowing it."

MtF,3e3ndl,jessicasecret,4,Wed Jul 22 00:58:37 2015 UTC,"Any identifying information posted publicly, really. The main concern, I think, is doxxing, and unless you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the information you're posting is in fact yours, it isn't allowed."

One really sweet boy had to tell me a secret- when I jumped in the water yesterday, I looked like a girl. I asked him if that was a bad thing and he said yes. When I was ""shocked"" and asked him why, he looked surprised, and suddenly changed his mind that it was a good thing, then decided the topic was too complex for his brain and said he was only joking :)  Last night I ordered a bunch of nice clothes for very cheap, hoping it'll fit me. Working every bloody day and evening in recent memory is paying off now!  That's my news for today, anyway. I almost feel bad I'm so upbeat at the moment, I'm sure I'll be an emotional mess any day now, order will be restored :P"

MtF,3e4hwc,Shipsexual,4,Tue Jul 21 22:24:26 2015 UTC,"To kids long hair=girl really, I remember thinking like that too."
MtF,3e4hwc,HyacinthGirI,3,Tue Jul 21 22:34:20 2015 UTC,"That's what I think, so I'm trying not to get my hopes up.  Still not complaining though :)"
MtF,3e4hwc,LinaKatharina,4,Tue Jul 21 22:35:47 2015 UTC,No need to be an emotional mess. :) Just think positive and enjoy being upbeat. That means HRT work full force.
MtF,3e4hwc,HyacinthGirI,2,Tue Jul 21 22:16:15 2015 UTC,"I hope so :) It's so hard to believe sometimes that the pills are even doing much, until you really think about the little things that add up, I find?"

Came out to my gaming group yesterday of 300 or so peeps yesterday and have had nothing but positive responses so far. I'm sure there will be a few who take issue with it but they will be in a very very minor minority  it seems.    In addition I was contacted by a family member who asked if I could help one of her friends out as she has a child that appeared to be transgender. TLDR version - Spoke to her for nearly 3 hours on Facebook answering questions, providing resources, my experience and so on. Amazing parents had already been doing everything right and allowing their child to explore and ultimately it looks like the kiddo was just waiting for them to get on the train. Parents are now seeking local support for their little girl (AMAB) and continuing to provide the love and support they already had been with the knowledge that they are not bad parents and information on how to help going forward.    It's been a damn good day."
MtF,3e4hwc,nikkitgirl,2,Tue Jul 21 22:37:59 2015 UTC,Congratulations! Your group sounds like good people. And the family member sounds like a great mother.
MtF,3e4hwc,zer0faith,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:13:33 2015 UTC,"Good people for sure. Helps that it is an 18 and up group so it tends towards a more mature community. Still didn't make it any easier coming out as it was 5x the number of previously knew in a single post.    The friend of the family member and her husband are great parents for sure. Happy kiddo, allowed to express herself as she see fits without judgement. Just needed some re-assurance that everything would be okay :) Wish we could all be so lucky. (I'm a little jealous!)"

MtF,3e4hwc,Shipsexual,2,Tue Jul 21 22:15:03 2015 UTC,"It's a French over seas territory in the south west pacific with a population of roughly 250k mostly found in Nouméa, the capital. It has a nominal GDP of $9,39 bn (2014) and a GDP per capita of $39k giving it the second highest GDP per capita in Oceania just behind Australia and in front of New Zealand. It consists of 4 larger islands and a few smaller and one that didn't even exist. The largest island is Grande Terre which is characterized by a mountain chain running all the way down the island, the other four are called the Loyalty Islands and are sparsely populated. The main export of New Caledonia is Nickel and the islands are home to an estimated 10% of the entire world's nickel reserve and is the third largest exporter after Australia and Russia. However New Caledonia is also rich in other metals such as iron, gold, silver, copper and tin. New Caledonia is also home to an impressive diversity of animals and plants and most of them can only be found in New Caledonia, notable examples are, the Kagu bird and the New Caledonian fern. It is also home to a massive barrier reef called the New Caledonian barrier reef. New Caledonia was first discovered by captain Cook and named after Caledonia in Scotland which it reminded him of.  How do I know this? I played New Caledonia in an RP and I fell in love with the country."
MtF,3e4hwc,Finding_Alyssa,3,Tue Jul 21 22:29:05 2015 UTC,"That's pretty cool though, what kind of RP?"
MtF,3e4hwc,Shipsexual,2,Tue Jul 21 22:33:29 2015 UTC,One where you play as nations here on reddit. I played New Caledonia from 2025 till the end and now I'm thinking of just making an AU with it so I can do something more with it.

MtF,3e4hwc,HyacinthGirI,2,Tue Jul 21 22:20:18 2015 UTC,"If brushing is painful, it's a biig sign that something's wrong- your brush, technique, or if you have curly hair, you should probably keep brushing to an absolute minimum!  It can be tedious, but for me it's worth it. If it's not for you, maybe even going a little shorter could be worthwhile? :)"

When I called to make my first therapy appointment (omg was so nerve wracking), the therapist actually asked me in the call if it was for myself or a friend, as apparently it is very common for trans folk to have a friend call and make that first appointment.  I completely get wanting to do that for yourself, but don't think of yourself as weird or unusual if you have a friend do it for you. Asking the friend to do it is nerve-wracking in itself.  Good luck!"

Getting through security went easier than I was expecting (which was the worse). I had to get a patdown, since I opted out of the body scanner thing.

MtF,3e3p36,ElliePants,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:18:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't have experience stopping at 8-10 weeks, but that was completely my plan when I started out. I figured I'd take the chance to see if I really saw any changes that I liked and hopefully find out if it was for me by then. Even if I had liked the changes, my plan was to take a break and come out to everyone/see a doctor/etc. before staying on it, as I didn't feel ready to completely take those steps.  To keep it short, 8 weeks rolled around, and I found myself at the point that you've heard about many times before...someone would have to pry the hormones from my cold dead hands to get them away from me. The mental improvement (lifetime of extremely bad social anxiety/suicidal depression) was so significant, that I finally felt like I was alive. Seeing the changes, and feeling the improvements is what really confirmed that this was my path, and it helped give me the strength to come out to everyone and start taking other steps in that direction, because it was the only path worth fighting for.  Don't be afraid, every pill is a choice, and you won't see changes immediately. It's not like your somehow brainwashed by it either, where you have to stay on it at that point if you like it. I was just surprised to find that in the short time, I experienced such positive improvements, that my lack of preparedness for coming out to parents/work/etc. was no longer that. You might be surprised as well and find yourself ready to commit to it sooner than you thought, and if so, that's awesome, because you decided you were ready."

I got many compliments from girls on my boobs. Had a guy say ""I'm so confused right now..."" Another guy who debated with his wife if I was male or female. And a family member who said they would ""hit that"" when they saw the behind pic (while joking, it was still a comment about the pic being feminine looking from behind).

MtF,3e2fsj,ZePartySquirrel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:29:53 2015 UTC,Ok. I personally am going the voice therapy route first. It's not a surgery so is obviously the safest option. The others on here have talked about voice surgery being dangerous or sounding less genuine may be referring to older techniques. I've been around and researching transition for years and I too have heard about issues with older techniques for voice surgery and not really seen any examples and that worries me. Like the others though my 50¢ is unreferenced. In the last few years though techniques like the one yeson use and some other doctors have started to become popular and do appear successful. There are YouTube videos with some examples available and in nearly all people sound good. Also apparently their technique is reversible. I am considering yeson eventually but I do feel a lot can be done with practice. Your vocal chords need a lot of training but like any muscle can change dramatically.  Edit: spelling

MtF,3dzy18,heavymetaljew,4,Mon Jul 20 23:03:51 2015 UTC,"Ugh, dating. I eventually want to try that once I'm legally female and whatnot (I really wish I had a girlfriend), but I doubt I'd be that date-able. Any woman that would hypothetically date me in the future would have to accept that I wouldn't get fully naked in front of her until after I'm post-op and healed up, thanks to genital dysphoria."
MtF,3dzy18,nikkitgirl,4,Mon Jul 20 22:42:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I could get naked now, but as far as a girl doing stuff to me down there, I'll have to trust her a lot before I'm going to let her in the front (the back on the other hand…)"
MtF,3dzy18,heavymetaljew,3,Mon Jul 20 22:54:51 2015 UTC,"I doubt I could let anyone in the back, since they'd see my lack of vagina if I'm not too careful, and let's face it, there's no way I could be that careful if I'm getting pegged and enjoying it."
MtF,3dzy18,nikkitgirl,4,Mon Jul 20 23:02:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for me, I hate not having a vagina, but I don't have that big of a problem with people seeing my penis if I'm close enough to them to let them in my pants (vagina or not). But I completely understand how you feel, and I may end up feeling closer to your perspective after more time on hormones."
MtF,3dzy18,heavymetaljew,2,Mon Jul 20 23:11:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't have a huge sex drive before I transitioned, and it's gone down a lot since to the point of almost total lack of interest in sex (I mainly want a girlfriend for companionship reasons). Before I had my trans epiphany, I did try having a boyfriend for a while mainly because I was interested in having sex where my penis wasn't really being emphasized (how did I not realize that my dislike of using that probably mean I am trans, urgh), and now I've gotten to the point where I can't stand the thought of someone seeing me as a penis-owner in any context."
MtF,3dzy18,nikkitgirl,2,Mon Jul 20 23:18:54 2015 UTC,"It's mostly for companionship for me too. I still have a decent sex drive (it's gone up in the past month). The big thing for me is that my sexuality feels more feminine now. I've actually never dated before, so it'll all be new to me anyways. As a guy I was always afraid that a girlfriend would leave me if she knew about my feminine desires, and for a while I was afraid that my sexuality might change or something. But now I feel like I'm fairly stable and honest, at least enough so to try dating."
MtF,3dzy18,jules_who,3,Mon Jul 20 23:31:12 2015 UTC,"I have the same problem. I really want to date, but can't get naked in front of anybody. Maybe I'll meet someone who's okay with that. Likely that she would be another trans girl.  But omg I've met so many pretty girls over the past 2 weeks. I haven't been sexually attracted to anybody before. Too bad they're probably all off limits for one reason or another"
MtF,3dzy18,heavymetaljew,2,Mon Jul 20 23:31:39 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't know if I'd be comfortable getting naked for a partner even after I'm post-op and fully healed up, but it might just be that being pre-op is preventing me from seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. I did have a girlfriend for two years once, and that was mostly platonic. I really, really miss the emotional intimacy that we had, and I think that might be more important for me in future relationships than sexual intimacy. A girlfriend that wants to cuddle while stargazing or something like that would be awesome. I have no idea how to find one though.   But omg I've met so many pretty girls over the past 2 weeks.   What have you been doing to achieve this?   I haven't been sexually attracted to anybody before.   I have, but it's weird. I don't get attracted much these days to anyone, and the attraction I do have isn't that sexual. HRT has changed how I experience arousal and attraction and all that. It's... just... better.   Too bad they're probably all off limits for one reason or another    When it comes to talking to a girl as a friend, I'm not bad at it. When it comes to talking to a girl as a potential romantic partner, I have no idea where to even start. Like, what do I do? I only attempted dating as a guy a few times, and I didn't really know what I was doing back then, however many years ago that was. I did get asked out by a guy once, which is why I have an ex-boyfriend, but I have pretty much no desire to ever date a guy in the future (not into it, and guy sweat/BO is so gross), and I'm kinda oblivious to anyone being interested in me unless they explicitly say so."
MtF,3dzy18,jules_who,3,Tue Jul 21 00:04:40 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't know if I'd be comfortable getting naked for a partner even after I'm post-op and fully healed up.    I think I'd be okay post op being naked. It's always the dangly bits that I'm uncomfortable with people seeing. Especially when it's not dangly.   What have you been doing to achieve this?   Volunteering. A lot of attractive girls around. I've only had a chance to actually talk with a few of them.    I did get asked out by a guy once   I got asked out by a dude once. He was old and creepy, and I'm not into guys. I also got asked by an old man to marry his grandson. Said grandson is 7 years younger than me and lives in America.   I might be interested in a really androgynous guy or nonbinary trans masculine person, but they would have to have a truly amazing personality."
MtF,3dzy18,heavymetaljew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:57:39 2015 UTC,"It's always the dangly bits that I'm uncomfortable with people seeing.   I hated being out of the pool at swim team or water polo practice because I really couldn't stand the notion of someone looking at my crotch. Maybe I would be comfortable after with nudity after post-op, since I'm alright now when I tuck and nobody can see bulge through my jeans. I don't know. Only one way to find out.   Volunteering. A lot of attractive girls around.   Ah. That would make it kinda hard to talk to them while working.   I got asked out by a dude once. He was old and creepy, and I'm not into guys. I also got asked by an old man to marry his grandson. Said grandson is 7 years younger than me and lives in America.    I've never had a creeper ask me out (did get asked to give a blowjob once). I've gotten a fair amount of mild creepiness (random guys sometimes seem to want to strike up conversations with me (I didn't realize I'm such an interesting person)), but that hasn't happened since I moved out of Oakland. Well, there was one time since moving, but I was in Oakland notifying the court that I moved so my name change will go smoothly next month.   I might be interested in a really androgynous guy or nonbinary trans masculine person, but they would have to have a truly amazing personality.   I dunno. I could totally have someone like that as a very, very close best friend, but I'm not sure if I'd be attracted to them for a romantic relationship. But anything can happen, so I can't rule it out. I just don't think I'd actively pursue that, so they'd have to ask me out for me to consider it."
MtF,3dzy18,Shadow_Faerie,4,Tue Jul 21 02:46:48 2015 UTC,"Yesterday my girlfriend gave me an old bra of hers that doesn't fit her anymore, my booblettes aren't quite big enough to really wear it, but as she said, I'll grow into it...  I think my booblings took this as a challenge... so tender today XP  And really I think I already have as much mammary tissue in there as she does, just way less fatty tissue...  Not sure whether to hope this means they'll get really big or hope that they're just growing fast and will stay a more manageable size."

Still not 100%, but it's pretty stable now. Finding a radio mod that plays Christmas music has completely changed the game in the best possible way.  I want to cut off all my hair. My experiment in having long hair was great, but I seriously think I want to ditch it and do anything else.  WHY ARE GIRLS SO PRETTY?!? AUHGGGUHUGGGKIHUIJFI  Where the fuck is this guy? I was supposed to see a guy about my parents' front garden, but he hasn't shown up. He's an hour late, and I just want to go about my day. I skipped lunch, my heart races whenever a car drives by.

I'm taking a red-eye and am getting a ride straight from the airport to my work site, so I'm not going to have time for my usual morning routine. I haven't figured out how I'm going to deal with that, since I'd rather not get clocked.

MtF,3dzy18,jules_who,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:08 2015 UTC,"Gender marker in Ontario is relatively easy after the rules changed last year. Doctors note, a few forms, and an application for a new birth certificate. The birth certificate application is the same one you would use to replace a lost birth certificate, and it has some really annoying requirements for references. Once that is done, a new passport requires the long form application because of the name change, but it's not nearly as difficult as the birth certificate.  Surprisingly changing my name everywhere else hasn't been difficult, though there are probably some that I've forgotten to do."
MtF,3dzy18,heavymetaljew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:54:36 2015 UTC,Why do you need references for a birth certificate? Is there anything more than a doctor's note that's needed?
MtF,3dzy18,jules_who,2,Tue Jul 21 03:56:02 2015 UTC,Just people to prove you are who you say you are. Has to be someone from a short list of profession who's known you for a certain number of years. And you can't use the same doctor you got the letter from.

Something good came of it though - I came out to my best friends/future roomates last night and I have to say that it was the scariest thing I've ever done. They were so understanding and supportive and amazing.  They had a few of the normal questions (are you sure? How do you know? Ect) and then a bunch of stupid, funny questions. ""So... you're going to have tits? Can I see them?"" Bahaha. His girlfriend slapped him for that one, but we all laughed.  Anyway, I've been fucking terrified all day because everything feels so damn REAL now. It isn't my secret anymore, and now that it's sort of out in the open... I don't know.

MtF,3dwwjg,transcognito,4,Mon Jul 20 05:18:32 2015 UTC,"The fact that you're financially dependent on this person and you are cut off from all support bases makes it sounds like you're sitting in a domestic abuse case. Maybe not physical abuse, but the mental side of it is often worse. And the moving part even makes it seem more likely. But I can see that you are also self isolating yourself or so you say, but that could just be training from the woman you're living with.   If you feel you're being abused by her (mental or physical) contact a domestic violence group in your area and talk to them.   If you want to get your ID changed what's holding you back from doing that now? The court fees? General fear? It sucks, but you will have to stand on your own feet if you want to move ahead. The woman you're living with is probably going through the motions if she's not an abuser. Meaning she won't be 'there' forever. That means it's on you to take the steps you need to take. If you feel safe enough asking her try to talk to her about getting your ID changed. Then see if you can't find a groupon that would get you a few cheaper laser sessions. That would at least move you forward some.   People in the real world are going to suck. That's just human nature. But more often then not we create the bogey man under the bed and then manifest that in reality by seeing our fears everywhere. Usually people aren't as attentive as we think they are or will be. Confidence goes a long way in helping with that too."

MtF,3dwwjg,vericlas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:38:06 2015 UTC,"This may or may not be relevant in your situation, but I think it's useful because sometimes abuse is difficult to distinguish.  Especially as we've adapted in relationships and have defined patterns.  power & control wheel  edit:  to add, this was originally made for heterosexual, cisgender, monogamous relationships - so although the language is more inclusive on this one, it's still very much aimed at a male/female binary"
MtF,3dwwjg,Meysvindu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:31:47 2015 UTC,"Well I only suggested possible abuse because of some of the verbage you used in your post. Things like being completely dependent on her for everything, having zero outside communication, and cut off from any friends are all things that are classically associated with domestic violence. Domestic violence can be mental as well as physical and it almost always starts out as mental only. If you want more info on it you can Google search for domestic violence shelters/hotlines in your area."

I kind of agree with vericias here, I think your s/o is being very controlling of you by cutting you off from your friends and family. And the fact that you don't feel loved or cared for in your relationship is not a good sign.  I hope you find some happiness wherever you are. I grew up in Massachusetts and although it is much more tolerant than in the south, some people there are still very set in their ways. Maybe try finding an LGBT group there with people you can talk to, or calling a hotline if you need mental health assistance?

MtF,3dtykw,TranshumansFTW,3,Sun Jul 19 20:11:49 2015 UTC,"How many players are there anyway? It's not really a ""thing"" outside of N. America as far as I know."
MtF,3dtykw,Mawool,7,Sun Jul 19 20:12:57 2015 UTC,The WFTDA has many teams outside of N.America. I recently got into derby and the thing about this league is their trans policy. It's probably the least gate-keepy sport out there.
MtF,3dtykw,TranshumansFTW,7,Sun Jul 19 20:26:22 2015 UTC,"Holy wow, you're right! This is a really awesome gender policy!   WFTDA's member leagues have voted to adopt a common definition of “female” as it applies to competitors in the sport. The new policy is inclusive of female transgender athletes.  WFTDA has been working to develop a gender policy since 2008. In the course of developing this policy, WFTDA consulted other sports organizations, government and legal counsel, academic experts, and medical professionals.  Recognizing that there are many definitions of “female,” the policy clearly defines what the term means for the purposes of WFTDA-sanctioned competition. It states that a female is someone “living as a woman and having sex hormones that are within the medically acceptable range for a female,” to include male-to-female transgender and intersex persons. Review the full policy at wftda.com/wftda-gender-policy.   TL;DR - They say that so long as you're full-time female and you've been on HRT for long enough that your hormone levels are at approximately female standard (as determined by a doctor of your choice, you're female enough for them.  This makes sense, and I can see why they'd want you to be full-time - after all, they're a women's league, if you're not fulltime them you're not going to be presenting as female necessarily during comps or training and that's not really in the spirit of the thing."
MtF,3dtykw,jules_who,2,Sun Jul 19 20:31:37 2015 UTC,"They don't even need a doctor's note unless someone complains. I'm stealth at derby, and they don't need to know."
MtF,3dtykw,jules_who,3,Sun Jul 19 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"Where the issue can come up is in WFTDA-sanctioned games. However, for instance, I play on our B-team that plays by WFTDA rules but isn't sanctioned, therefore I was told I could technically get away with not getting the doctor's note.  But I did anyway in case I transferred or was put on a wftda-sanctioned charter team. I wanted my ducks in a row. :)"
MtF,3dtykw,jules_who,4,Sun Jul 19 20:39:08 2015 UTC,"From the gender policy FAQ:   You do not need to gather or submit materials proving your eligibility under the policy, unless your league asks for it in order to feel comfortable attesting your eligibility along with the other chartered skaters.   I don't think my league is going to ask, so it's not needed. WFTDA doesn't even want to know who is trans."

I'm okay doing that for Vekk, I'll do absolutely anything for her, but this shit has to stop. These people already knew I'm on the edge and near my breaking point and they chose to lay that shit on me. They could have turned to other people, but they decided to put that weight on me.   I fucking walked away. I hid my phone in my car and didn't touch it until this afternoon. I got very drunk with Dakota and Spring, I cried in my beer, they gave me hugs. No one died without me holding the world together and I'm feeling much better now.   Please secure your own oxygen mask before helping others."
MtF,3dvkqq,Hurts_,7,Sun Jul 19 22:17:42 2015 UTC,"Please secure your own oxygen mask before helping others.   I get what you mean, but helping others helps me. It's far easier to help such a situation from the outside."
MtF,3dvkqq,misanthropicusername,4,Sun Jul 19 22:19:56 2015 UTC,Normally I feel the same way. Helping others makes me feel better. But I'm at my limit. I've run up against operational exhaustion. So I'm really not in any condition to do much good until I put on my mask and take some deep breaths.
MtF,3dvkqq,nikkitgirl,5,Sun Jul 19 22:58:03 2015 UTC,"Jeez, it was pretty clear in the tone of your comments about Vekk that you could barely handle it. For anybody you can't handle helping, direct them to a suicide hotline or /r/suicidewatch."
MtF,3dvkqq,misanthropicusername,5,Sun Jul 19 22:39:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I never found /r/SuicideWatch particularly helpful when I've been suicidal. It's an exercise in platitudes and stock phrases in my experience, with a lot of combating my suicidality by invalidating my feelings that lead to it.   I pointed the other two to hotlines. Can't do that with Vekk, though. Her paranoid schizophrenia makes it impossible for her to trust them, that they won't send the cops after her.  I think I can handle keeping Vekk alive. The worst has passed. What I couldn't handle was listening to her die. That sound will haunt me for a very long time. Still, if the noose hadn't broken, if she succeeded, I would be glad I was at least there for her in the end. That she wouldn't have died alone."

I wish I could, I want to, but I'm scared so bad.  All I've managed to do is get my ears pierced. I'm comfortable wearing whatever undies I want because nobody can tell. But everything else is so so so scary. I can only dress in female clothes by myself, not even around my friends, and the clothes aren't even my own. They're overused, small clothes that a friend donated to me. I can't even bring myself to go out to the store.  I'm scared to do anything. I'm scared of being judged. I'm scared of having to live up to other peoples expectations. I'm scared of how I'll been seen by my friends.  I'm terrified and it feels like I'll never be able to socially transition.

The thought of trying to present without having the benefit of giving the hormones time, hair removal, and voice training is extremely intimidating.  You'll get there. Just go at your own pace. I was talking to a trans man about this the other day, and he said that he had major social phobia when he transitioned that he had to overcome.

MtF,3dvkqq,nikkitgirl,2,Sun Jul 19 22:33:17 2015 UTC,I have enough experience being disabled to know that the ADA doesn't apply to interviews. Never give any indication that you may not be perfectly abled until you you've been hired.

MtF,3dvkqq,maybeayri,3,Sun Jul 19 23:09:55 2015 UTC,"It's not just a matter of getting them to repeat themselves, though. There are specific sounds and pitches I have trouble understanding at all. When I'm standing in front of them, I can use body language, their mouth, and context clues to fill in the things I can't quite catch. Talking to someone over the phone removes a good portion of how I understand speech. Trying to make it work regardless just leads to a lot of frustration on both ends so I try to minimize it where I can.  The upside to it, though, is that if they discriminate against me based on that just for the phone interview, then they were unlikely to hire me in the first place."

MtF,3dvkqq,IronPentacarbonyl,3,Sun Jul 19 22:13:08 2015 UTC,"""as long as they don't bother me, they're fine""   This has a way of meaning ""as long as they pretend to be cis/straight wherever I might see them"", which, um, yeah."

MtF,3dv797,MtF-Cayde,2,Sun Jul 19 20:07:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty much anything but that, lol. High waisted pants are generally very flattering. You can get some decent/cheap ones from H&M or Forever21. Getting straight cut, skinny, or even ""boyfriend jeans"" can look super cute and feminine, especially if it's paired well. I usually wear a tank top that's looser if I want to go a more androgynous route (looser tank + boyfriend jeans = awesome). You can pretty easily tailor some of your old jeans to make them a bit skinnier, and then you can wear them high on your waist - that's a decent choice.  One of the big things that really helped me was shoes. As in, getting shoes that were more andro/fem. Boots without much of a heel are AMAZING. I'd recommend getting women's boots, as they tend to be less bulky and more simple, and these pair wonderfully with the choices I described above. Toms are super cute and andro too.   The thing that saved me from going crazy when I wasn't really passing, and when I got really down on myself for not passing/wearing femme stuff, was just dressing very very androgynously. I didn't and pretty much still don't wear dresses/skirts/super femme blouses. Jean + boots (sometimes heeled) + tight tank + cardigan or light sweater + heavy button up coat if it's super cold= my favorite outfit.  DO NOT get graphic tee's. They're okay with a more masculine style (like you're wearing now), but they just look super tacky once you go more fem. Imo, darker or simple colors (deep red or blue, black, grey, white) just look better in general. Keep in mind though, that I am older than you and I have a different style. /r/femalefashionadvice is wonderful. Look around there and get some ideas of what things you could like."

MtF,3dvljy,vericlas,2,Mon Jul 20 00:13:14 2015 UTC,That's a good point. I definitely am not doing this on a whim either. I have been in therapy for like a year. So I'm just curious and slightly concerned I feel like this now vs the way I've felt in the past year
MtF,3dvljy,vericlas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:16:17 2015 UTC,"Anxiety is a big hurdle. Even if you've been working towards something for a while when it's a big deal like HRT you can get anxious about it. Or maybe it's not anxiety in your case, but if you're getting doubts it probably is. I mean just the idea that I could be doing HRT in a month~ or so got me really anxious. Or maybe it's not the right road for you. That's a call you have to make for yourself."
MtF,3dvljy,vericlas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:23:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for your comment! I have struggled with anxiety this whole process and before. While it has lessened as I have been going to therapy it still flares up frequently.   Could I subconsciously be freaking out about starting HRT? Does it work like that?
MtF,3dvljy,vericlas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:11:10 2015 UTC,Anxiety can spin up from all kinds of things. My therapist told me on Wednesday he would give me my HRT letter if I wanted it. As soon as he said that my anxiety went through the roof. Here was what I have been working towards and it's within my grasp. But my brains decided to make excuses and get me worried. Basically just anxiety being anxiety. We can either let those anxious feelings dominate our lives or we can push past them with logic.   Think about what you want. What is your desire saying? A few good days doesn't mean all the future days will be good. It doesn't mean they will be bad either. But if you have gender dysphoria (assuming your therapist has confirmed that you do) then you know deep down that without the hormones you're more likely to have more bad thrn good days.
MtF,3dvljy,vericlas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:53:41 2015 UTC,"Yea I understand the anxiety stuff all too well. I mean if I could push a button right now and switch genders and it would be like nothing happened I totally would.   But, can I deal with the rejection, hate and loneliness associated with transitioning. The more I look at it, the more I see what I'm giving up. Not gaining. Such a negative attitude"
MtF,3dvljy,MsMinxyChan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:57:51 2015 UTC,Thats doubts talking though. It's possible losses. Nothing is for sure and you can't dictate how the world will be to you after transition. But if you don't do it you're just living the painful lie so you can stay in the world you know. The world you know though is tempered by your fears. Waiting for you is the real world that you get to shape how you want it post transition.  Don't think about losses. Any perso. You lose because of transition makes you stronger. Why? Because you won't have someone there that could be subverting you behind your back while smiling to your face. Just do you and be confident in who you are and the worlds possibilities will open to you.

MtF,3dtexq,jessicasecret,5,Sun Jul 19 12:34:07 2015 UTC,"I went through a lot of the same, when I was a teenager.   I remember the arguments with my mom over the way I would dress, the make up, etc...  She didn't see the anorexia. She didn't see the cutting, right away. She saw the make up and the girls' jeans.   As an adult, I've talked with my mom about these things. They were not pleasant conversations. But she did tell me that she was just scared shitless about how the world would treat me, that she was trying to protect me from that, and didn't see, at the time, the harm she was doing.  It's hard to tell you to take the high road, be the bigger person. But our parents are only human.   Perhaps if I had had the conversation with my mom, at the time, about what bothered her about the jeans and the make up and the nail polish, we might have had a better, more meaningful dialogue, but it's hard to say.  PS, Hang in there. You'll make it through. And if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here."
MtF,3dtexq,JisforJanelle,2,Sun Jul 19 12:36:00 2015 UTC,"Since your mother knows your intentions using any colored polish will stand out as she will be looking for it. I'd suggest saving a few bucks up and buying a matte coat and using that if you wish to paint your nails. The matte will make it dull so it won't stand out (won't look slick or shiny) and it's still polish. I mean yeah it's not colored, but it would let you paint your toe nails without worry.   Older people, basically like your grand parents, are usually just backward on anything that doesn't fit into the perfect image of what is 'male' or 'female'. Their comments about your hair are not surprising in that regards. Maybe you can pull it back and put on like a baseball cap when you're going to be around groups like that. This way you wouldn't have to cut your hair and it draws less attention to it. Though if you're around them a lot and due to your age it may be easier to get a shorter hair cut for now. Hair will grow back. I know that's a hard pill to swallow. Just a thought."

Yes even drinking diet or caffeine free will still see you gain weight. A really simple like food plan is to set a calorie count you want to take in each day and then cook most of your meals around that. 2000 calories in is the 'average' healthy amount in. If you wish to lose 1-2 pounds a week you cut about 500 off each day either through exercise (extra 500 calories burned) or you cut your calories in down to 1500.   Hormones will affect weight loss but it varies from person to person. Testosterone burns more fat then estrogen, but you can still lose weight while on HRT if you have a plan and stick to it."
MtF,3duczv,vericlas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"I dont eat anywhere close to 2000 calories in a day, closer to 1000 and I drink pop only at weekends and only a little bit (somewhere between 0,5 and 1l) is there a certain weight limit when they dont let you to hrt? That is my main worry"
MtF,3duczv,Ahesterd,3,Sun Jul 19 16:41:29 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind us asking, what's your current weight? If you're truly eating only 1k calories  day there's almost no chance you're gaining weight  - 1k is on the absolute low end, and can be dangerously low at that. It's more likely you're miscounting portions or not counting ""small stuff""."
MtF,3duczv,SerasVal,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:08:12 2015 UTC,"My current weight is 90kilograms and I do count everything, I eat a bread for breakfast(I dont always eat breakfast) for lunch I eat salad, potatos and meat, I dont usually eat anything at evening but if I do it is no more than a bread.

MtF,3duczv,Ahesterd,3,Sun Jul 19 17:17:40 2015 UTC,I'd suggest you try something like myfitnesspal to keep track of your calories/exercise. It's what I've been using for the last 10 weeks its got a pretty complete catalog of foods/brands so its fairly easy to use.

MtF,3duczv,SerasVal,2,Sun Jul 19 18:38:33 2015 UTC,"I almost guarantee, at that weight, if you were eating 1000/day you'd be dropping something like 1-2 kg a week. Odds are you're underestimating portions - its not uncommon. To start with I recommend just measuring absolutely everything you eat and then logging how many calories that is. Bread (and its evil carbs) is usually higher than people expect.   But for comparison, I weigh around the same as you - maybe a couple kg less - and on a 1400-1600 calorie/day diet I'm losing at least one pound a weak. When j started tracking calories I was pretty surprised by how far off my mental estimates were - a good 1000 calories over, or more."
MtF,3duczv,AWitchDidIt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:26:44 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if there is a certain weight they won't let you start HRT. Though they prefer you to be closer to the recommended weight then way over it.   I was at around 300lbs in March and I'm down to around 250lbs now. Eating around 1200 calories and walking 5 miles per day. So it's weird if you're gaining at that intake. Though if you're eating a lot of chicken you might be gaining muscle mass.
MtF,3duczv,vericlas,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:12:20 2015 UTC,"Though if you're eating a lot of chicken you might be gaining muscle mass.   Not at 1000 calories a day. Creating muscle is calorically expensive, your body only does it if it has an abundance of calories."
MtF,3dspg9,throwaway949161,12,Sun Jul 19 02:16:11 2015 UTC,"You may still be attracted to women after hormones. In fact, it's pretty likely. You have to accept that, much like your gender, your sexuality is out of your control, and that's ok. There are plenty of cis women that are attracted to women too, they can handle it, and so can you. It doesn't make you any less or worse of a woman to be a lesbian/bi/pan."
MtF,3dspg9,nikkitgirl,3,Sun Jul 19 02:50:34 2015 UTC,"It just doesn't feel right when I feel it's in limbo and something I would like to consciously suppress and ignore until after I can start living as myself everywhere instead of just only where I can control it. Not able to live as myself in every environment and it's screwing with my head.  as the other commentators pointed out, it probably is some sort of internalized homophobia, not that I had meant to say that non-straight sexualities were invalidating of being a woman, just that I, I guess you're right the more I have time to think about it.  and if I am attracted to women, well, I guess i'm fine. I'm sorry, I'm just a mess and getting started with confronting this problem I've tried to ignore...  I'm such a mess right now sorry I can't write anything near coherently."
MtF,3dspg9,nikkitgirl,7,Sun Jul 19 03:57:46 2015 UTC,"I get it. And frankly, plenty of girls that liked guys pre-transition feel that way too. It turns out, having a male sexuality sucks when you're a woman, regardless of sexual orientation. It'll get better. Right now, I feel closer to a cis lesbian than a straight man when it comes to my sexuality. I like gayer looking girls (soft butch, yum), I focus more on stuff like lips and arms than guys do. When me and my friends see a cute girl sometimes it's almost as if me and the other lesbian in the group are seeing someone completely different from who the guys are seeing.   And it's ok to feel kinda cheated by the way you are. I don't get to be a girly girl, even though I kinda wish I was, but I'm a tomboy. That may change, but it likely won't, and I'm learning to accept that, because it's who I am. A lot of people say you get to control who you are, but that's not true, I could act like that girly girl I wish I was, but I still wouldn't be her, I'd just feel awkward and be less happy because I'd be living a lie about who I am. Likewise, you could pretend you aren't attracted to women, so many women have lived their entire lives doing just that, but it wouldn't make you happy. Being honest with yourself and living your life as you will though. hugs"
MtF,3dspg9,agriff1,2,Sun Jul 19 05:54:51 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I kind of feel a similar way as you about wanting to be super femme but feeling like you're naturally more of a tomboy.

MtF,3dspg9,nikkitgirl,0,Mon Jul 20 14:23:35 2015 UTC,"It makes sense that I would speak that way, I'm settling for what I'm comfortable with and what I know over what I wish I could be."
MtF,3dspg9,vericlas,7,Mon Jul 20 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"Well... testosterone isn't necessarily making you attracted to women. It might be part of it, but often your sexual orientation is just another thing that is wired into you.   You talk as if transition is impossible. If there is anything I've learned these last few months it is that nothing is impossible. Humans are the impossible and we can achieve amazing wonders every day if we try."
MtF,3dspg9,notwhoiamanymore,4,Sun Jul 19 02:51:54 2015 UTC,"That's probably not going to go away hun.  You're obviously noticing that you have an attraction, hormones won't change that.  It might make the sex drive change, but it's not going to change your sexual orientation."
MtF,3dspg9,Lunacie,4,Sun Jul 19 03:22:57 2015 UTC,"Sexuality and hormones aren't really related. When you see people ""changing"" their sexuality while transitioning, it tends to be because they already had the inkling to do so in the first place. Maybe they entertained the idea but just never acted on it until they transitioned.  So if you aren't attracted to men now and have never considered it a possibility, you probably won't be after starting HRT."
MtF,3dspg9,Jackibelle,3,Sun Jul 19 03:31:37 2015 UTC,"Like everyone else has said: there's nothing wrong with being attracted to women. You'll be much happier if you come to grips with this internalized homophobia and let yourself be yourself.  Now, going off of   It's a struggle with platonic friendships I very much want to keep that way when I'm fighting testosterone driven impulses I know won't be there after I start hormones!   it's true a lot of people have their libido's tank after going on HRT, and it's easy for lust to screw with your thinking, and I totally understand how that might interfere with making friends, especially if that's something they can pick up on. If your friends are homophobic they might be put off by you being attracted to them and displaying or acting on that attraction, and that's unfortunate on several levels.  I'm not sure about practical advice for dealing with this except ""try not to let it be a problem"" which is basically the worst advice in the world, haha. Setting certain friends off-limits has helped me a lot to just not even think of them sexually at all; sure they may be attractive, but I'm not going to stir something up with the other graduate students in my research group. And having that in mind makes it easy to not have intrusive thoughts in the first place."
MtF,3dspg9,IronPentacarbonyl,2,Sun Jul 19 03:29:01 2015 UTC,"Hormones will change your sex drive, although it happens a bit differently for everybody. Possibly in a way that will make it easier for you to manage and sort your feelings. I can say it's been a load off for me. But, attraction isn't just a question of hormones; HRT alone will not resolve your troubles with your sexuality. Your sexual orientation will do what it will - you'll serve yourself better by trying to accept it for what it is, rather than hoping against odds that it will suddenly and radically change. Even with estrogen."

This is rather common, and it's rather easy to see through. Would you rather have a classically female body: on a desert island? if you were required to be celibate your whole life? while doing laundry, or watching tv? What's the line that you'd say ""fuck it, transition isn't worth it""? Separate the LGB from the T. LGB is about sexuality, T is about identity; it's only as sexual as being a human being is sexual. While the fact that your parents condemn non-straight people is abhorrent, you have to take what you can get in those situations. Explain how being trans is in no way related to sexuality, that it's a medical condition. That decision doesn't come for quite a while, it needn't be settled before you even start HRT. Sperm banking is really the only option right now."
MtF,3dri85,Hurts_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:42:37 2015 UTC,"You may want to seek a therapist. If you want to go that route, which I would suggest since you have a lot of questions, this is a good resource for finding one. On there you can search for therapists by city and what they specialize in. Just look for one on there that has gender training or specializes in gender issues.   Clothes can be iffy. If you're overweight start working out now. You don't have to run or jog or lift a million pounds. Just start walking more then you do now and eat less then you eat now. You will slowly lose weight doing that. And drink lots of water of course. If you have more questions about an easy cheap work out that is literally just walking and calorie counting let me know. Now that weight loss will impact your clothing options since there are more options the skinnier you are. I'm in the same boat on being 6'4"" though my feet are not as large (hovering around a 13-15 depending on brand). You can also look at female shoes in 'plus sizes' here and plus size womens clothing here. Of course there are other options out there, but those are just some starting points to look at stuff.  Family will vary from person to person. Sadly that's one you won't really know until you take the leap to talk to them. As you will probably need their assistance in this because of your age you will probably end up talking to them before you can do much else. That can be really frightening, but this journey takes a lot of courage. Do your research before talking to them and let them know you will answer any questions as best you can if you can't you will look for an answer for them. Though you may want to print off copies of the research on brain chemistry and gender dysphoria to give them to read so they can't play the 'god doesnt make trans people' card. Though if they truly love you then they shouldn't stand in your way very much.   Genitals are a bridge you will cross when you get there. Don't worry about the stuff that is a long ways off. SRS (genital surgery) is not something you would be getting anytime soon and your feelings on it can change over time of course. That will also tie into children. Sperm banking is your only option if you want to have children after starting hormones since the spirolacten will suppress your testosterone production which will impact your sperm production. But that's all stuff to worry about once you're a little bit further in."
MtF,3dri85,vericlas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:57:19 2015 UTC,"Hey! First: hug. It's all very confusing and I think basically everyone on this sub has gone through the same thing you're going through right now.  If it helps, just know that you don't need to figure everything out right now. You're allowed to let things stew around in your brain a bit, and a lot of decisions (like whether or not to do genital surgery) don't have to be made any time in the near future. That said, it does help to transition earlier (particularly with respect to hormone effectiveness) but it's not going to be the end of the world if you wait a bit as you sort everything out.  If you're 16, that means you're maybe about two years out from college age. Even if you don't think you'll be able to find support at home, college is a great opportunity to ""reinvent"" yourself. If you decide you want to transition, it might be an opportune time since you'll be out of the house and have a lot more independence - just be careful to not be financially dependent on your parents (i.e. don't pick a school that costs $50,000 per year without a large scholarship) if you don't think they'll take it well. That's not to say they won't, for many people it goes surprisingly well! But, planning for the worst case is important.  Regarding your height: I'm sure it's already difficult to find guy clothes or even shoes at your height anyway. It's not going to be easy to find women's clothing in your sizes, but that's not worse, it's just equivalently frustrating. Going from ""really tall guy"" to ""really tall girl"" is still staying in that same group of ""that incredibly tall friend I have"". Sure, you won't be a teensy little thing, but that's not something anyone can control, even cis women.  Some things you can do now even while you're not ""out"":   Start saving up money with a part time job. Transition is expensive. Worst case, you decide not to transition but you still have an extra $5000 floating around in the bank you can put toward college or a car or your first apartment or something, so it's still handy. Just tell your parents you want to be financially responsible and get some work experience. Focus on schoolwork so you can try to get into a good school and possibly get college scholarships. I know it's a cliche but this is actually pretty important, especially if you end up wanting to transition during college (again: financial independence is super important) Work on your voice. Straight up practicing speaking in a female voice is probably hard to keep secret, but you have other options like picking up singing, which would teach you a lot about controlling your voice's sound and pitch (and it's a handy skill to have!), which is at least a step in the right direction."
MtF,3dpler,PariahSilver,4,Sat Jul 18 05:34:19 2015 UTC,"I had no idea what I was making when I started this. Found a venn diagram maker, started with ""Female Identified,"" and ended up making a diagram of the kind of person I need to find if I'm ever going to date ever again ever.  X marks the spot, I guess.  I'm no expert at venn diagrams, so if there's anything that doesn't quite gel...well then, oops I guess. :P"
MtF,3dpler,Hurts_,9,Sat Jul 18 05:35:56 2015 UTC,It's not so much 'doesn't quite gel' as 'doesn't utilize the function of a Venn diagram.'  They're more for comparing things that could potentially have similar attributes/shared component populations.
MtF,3dpler,anomine2,2,Sat Jul 18 05:37:52 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I didn't know that.  Oh well.  *Thank you for the info though. :)"
MtF,3dpler,anomine2,3,Sat Jul 18 05:38:32 2015 UTC,"Set/Venn/Euler diagrams are just used to show the relationships between defined sets visually. I think you used it just fine :)  If we label the sets you use here as A,B,C,D,E,F,G where A is 'Female Attracted' and so on then:  x ϵ A∩B∩C∩D∩E∩F∩G  I think you represented it more simply and elegantly in your diagram :P"
MtF,3dpler,ImKira,2,Sun Jul 19 06:15:27 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought, but I'm not really an arguer most days.  That little formula you wrote is interesting. I'm fascinated by the idea that math formulae can be used to express so many different things.  *Also: like anything else I make, I've come to see a ton of things I'd rather do differently with my little diagram. But I must force myself to leave it alone. XD"
MtF,3dpler,Sparkiran,2,Sun Jul 19 06:41:59 2015 UTC,Maths is pretty great (that's why I study it :D) I do find making lists and diagrams can help put a problem into perspective.  I've just noticed something about what I said as well. Euler and Venn diagrams aren't the same thing. Venn diagrams are a kind of Euler diagram (the relationship is represented by this Euler diagram! https://reflectivemaths.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/euler-and-venn-diagrams.jpg)
MtF,3dpler,enFemme,2,Sun Jul 19 06:56:14 2015 UTC,"Haha! I love that diagram, how delightfully fun. :D  Math fascinates me, but only as an adult. When I was a kid, like many, I despised math. It was only later that I realized what I actually despised was the stuff being foisted on me like holy text. None of it was the interesting, speculative, creative stuff.  I never pursued it, I'm a writer, but I still love it."
MtF,3dsi6i,Greta_Garbanzo,2,Sun Jul 19 01:01:00 2015 UTC,If I was in Seattle and wasn't so oafish I'd join you just to get out and about lol. That's the problem with living where I live... no one else around here is part of this community.

MtF,3dom4o,NamelessAsOfYet,8,Fri Jul 17 23:51:02 2015 UTC,That rubix cube is unsolvable.
MtF,3dom4o,Shipsexual,10,Sat Jul 18 01:07:25 2015 UTC,That's why they had RSS - Rubix Solvenizing Surgery - to help correct those unsolvable aspects they kept seeing in the mirror and make them feel more comfortable in their own cube!
MtF,3dom4o,eriniki,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:57:56 2015 UTC,Which I'm assuming refers to pulling all the stickers off and replacing them on the same faces.
MtF,3dom4o,liberationlioness,8,Sun Jul 19 18:17:04 2015 UTC,That's what society would like you to believe! Who says you can not have two yellow middles?

MtF,3dom4o,Hoihe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:15:30 2015 UTC,Or what about a Rubik's cube with two yellow sides?
MtF,3dom4o,Hoihe,0,Sun Jul 19 03:26:40 2015 UTC,"It's Rubik's cube.  Rubik Ernő (Ernest Rubick), a Hungarian inventor invented it, and its name comes from his surname, Rubik (anglicized as Rubick)"
MtF,3dom4o,_keelyn,5,Sun Jul 19 03:27:35 2015 UTC,"I know this picture has cruised the greater-net for a long time. Seeing it today I immediately identified with the last frame. Unbelievable that I am here with all that work behind me. Life is no longer physically burdened by problems of sex and gender; the anxiety and adrenaline all but gone. The only moments left to worry about are ""stealthy"" moments. Like using my old voice or talking medical transition with cisgender people.  I hear often we are to search for ourselves but that isn't the issue. Instead you unbury, dig up, and show everyone what has been smothered. That is what got me excited. ""Look I can show this true part of me now!"" Eventually you'll dig up all the hidden treasure. You'll stand with no reason to look back down. And finally be excited about what is around.   Don't Quit."

MtF,3dom4o,Hoihe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:13:25 2015 UTC,"All you need to solve a rubik's cube is learning the various reactions to certain actions. Technically, from what I've read... passing seems to be pretty similar. Behaviour and voice is like the power to appearance."
MtF,3dom4o,liberationlioness,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:29:13 2015 UTC,That's basically SRS for transcuban persons
MtF,3dom4o,KasseanaTheGreat,2,Sun Jul 19 18:19:55 2015 UTC,This image becomes a bit less helpful when you remember you can solve a rubiks cube
MtF,3dom4o,JisforJanelle,2,Sat Jul 18 13:14:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking that, too. But then, I think how empowered I felt when I learned how to solve this thing that baffles so many people.  Gender is one of those things that baffles people. I feel badly for cis-people, sometimes, because they're never really forced to question what gender is to them, because they're living it in an average way, as is expected of them.   But we have to solve what gender means to us, by trial and error over the years of a lifetime."
