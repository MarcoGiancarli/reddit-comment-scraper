shameless,3e551y,mboitui,9,Wed Jul 22 01:03:52 2015 UTC,God they had the perfect way to cut Sammi out of the show and now we are getting more of her family. Wth are the writers doing?
shameless,3e551y,Cliffschetti,6,Wed Jul 22 01:37:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was disappointed too. Nothing against the actress tho, but the character. Ugh."
shameless,3e551y,TheyCallMeShitHead,4,Wed Jul 22 01:50:11 2015 UTC,"I hope they can't find an actress and decide not to go through with it. I hate how much they focused on Sammis character. I think she should have just been in a few episodes when Frank needed the liver, and then a few to cause some friction before leaving for one reason or another. I hate her character so much. This is my favorite show of all time, and I hope they go back and focus a more on Fiona and Lip. They have SO MUCH POTENTIAL in those characters. They need to stop making Fiona a fucking slut, and they need to let Lip do what Lip does. Jeremy Allen White is such a good actor."

shameless,3dljhd,asshair,5,Fri Jul 17 06:31:15 2015 UTC,I think ladies think she is a hot because she has one of those bodies that looks good in anything. She can rock dresses and also look good in guys shirts and sweat shorts. This mostly due to her being thin as a rail and that is something a lot of women think is attractive or what they want to look like.  Men I've talked to seem to like her for her personality/body. I find her voice and personality very annoying so I don't get that side of it. Just a lot of men like thin women and also like women with strong personalities or the sassy sarcastic type of woman.

shameless,3cj82p,vv____vv,12,Wed Jul 8 09:45:28 2015 UTC,Noel Fisher and Cameron Monaghan have both said Mickey won't be back. I won't believe it until the season is over and he's truly not been in it.
shameless,3cj82p,jor1ss,6,Wed Jul 8 11:01:23 2015 UTC,Do you have a source for that? Because last I heard they pushed the shooting schedule back a month to accommodate his commitment to TMNT.
shameless,3cj82p,jor1ss,3,Wed Jul 8 16:43:46 2015 UTC,It was on tumblr somewhere. One of his fans met him and they spoke about it and apparently he said so.  But they also said Jimmy was dead 100% sure. I don't believe them anymore until I see it on screen.
shameless,3cj82p,aqws2,3,Wed Jul 8 17:17:48 2015 UTC,Agreed
shameless,3cj82p,vascava,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"This is a misconception. The only news that they pushed the shooting schedule back was from a single Sheila Callaghan tweet stating they will begin to shoot at the start of August. However no reason at all was given for why they are shooting a month later than normal. It was only through fan optimism and speculation that people guessed it was to accommodate Noel's schedule, but there is no factual foundation for it. This was also before Cameron and Noel stated to fans Mickey was not coming back (at least for S6).  The delayed start to filming could just as likely be to accommodate Cameron's schedule, who is filming for Gotham in NYC right now.  Or simply the writers needed a month longer to get their shit on track. By god they need to after S5."
shameless,3cj82p,aqws2,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:11:57 2015 UTC,"Or they're doing a ""late summer-fall season"" and shooting it actually in late summer-fall, so we don't have to see snowing in fucking august like last season!!"
shameless,3cj82p,mboitui,7,Thu Jul 9 10:17:16 2015 UTC,"The latest of anything ""official"" is still John Wells' interview that was released when the S5 finale aired, and some Sheila Callaghan tweets that used to say she knows nothing about whether Mickey's coming back, until recently she has been saying she's staying quiet instead.  The consensus is Jimmy is out for good. In the interview John Wells confirmed as much that the writers have ran out of ideas for him.  With Mickey/Noel there's all kinds of beating around the bush and conspiracy theories going on. Cameron and Noel have allegedly said to multiple fans Mickey is not returning for S6 at least. This could either be the truth or something like Ian's S3/4 disappearance, take it how you will. The official line (from the interview) is that there was a scheduling conflict, but the fan speculation flying around is that there was some nasty behind-the-scenes reason at work.  Two things to remember though:   It isn't in the showrunners' interests to actually officially announce anything. By keeping it mysterious with the implicit possibility of a surprise return, they can keep viewers watching even if Mickey doesn't really return in the end. Don't think that the writers necessarily care for the characters. If they can write such bad plotlines and character assassinate them to such a level in S5, it's because they are driven by something other than the good of the story or the characters."
shameless,3cj82p,Kimbrusco,4,Wed Jul 8 13:18:15 2015 UTC,"Considering Wells' interview, I believe Jimmy is gone for good. Same for Sheila. Mickey, even if he is out this season, he most definitely will be back.  Now I worry about Mandy. Have no idea if she'll be back."
shameless,3cj82p,steve_corbino,5,Wed Jul 8 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think Mandy will be back. Her and Jeremy Allen White (Lip) were an off screen couple. They broke up and then it seemed they wrote her out. I could be wrong that's how I read into it. But seriously, if they take Mickey, undeniably the best character on the show, out they're fucking idiots and running the show in the ground."
shameless,3cj82p,tkookookachoo,6,Wed Jul 8 23:52:03 2015 UTC,I think eventually we'll find out that Kenyatta killed Mandy...would be a legit write off for the character and could make for a good storyline for Ian/Lip and possibly the return of Mickey.

shameless,3cj82p,del_rio,4,Thu Jul 16 07:46:03 2015 UTC,"If Noel doesn't come back there are not enough tissues in the world to dry my tears. He is my favourite character by far. The character is hilarious and brilliant and he gives Emmy worthy performances in every episode. Ian needs him! Mickey PLEASE COME BACK!!!   As for Jimmy, the writers really destroyed a once great character. They would need to do some serious damage control if they brought him back. I was rooting for him and Fiona.

shameless,3bdhdq,Jsnave,8,Sun Jun 28 04:37:06 2015 UTC,"Fiona:  About her relationships, what I think pissed people off is the repetitive storylines. Fiona torn between a good guy and a bad guy happens in every single season. It got to a point that no one can stand that storyline anymore.  Plus, Fiona has always been portrayed as a strong woman, so after everything she went through it's pretty hard to buy her teenage drama ""I'm into this guy but I like this other one"". She spent the whole season without making any decision about that.  And out of curiosity, what makes you think Gus can understand her lifestyle? I mean, how would he react when Monica shows up again and try suicide in front of the kids?  Personally I hate both Gus and Sean. I think Fiona needs to get her shit together by herself.  About her guardianship, I understand when you say Carl and Debbie are old enough to be independent, however one is in jail and the other one is deliberately wanting to have a baby. So they need help and Fiona is responsible for them. Plus, although I understand she deserves her own life, she has a 4 years old to care of, and Fiona was making plans to travel with Gus for weeks. Liam is 4 and he is her responsibility.  Also, Fiona kicked Frank and Sammy out of the house, now she is allowing both of them there and even allowing Sammy to take care of the kids. Fiona knows the danger they represent. Liam almost died because he reached the cocaine. Sammy has a gun in the house!!! It simply doesn't make any sense Fiona allowing Sammy to take care of the kids. Especially after everything that happened.  I understand you points, but for me, everything about Fiona this season was out of character."
shameless,3bdhdq,mboitui,3,Sun Jun 28 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"People are upset with Fiona because bills are due and they aren't getting paid, there is no food in the house for the kids that were still home. She is their legal guardian, she went to court and she is behaving the same neglectful ways of her parents before her. on her watch Debbie gets pregnant and Carl goes to juvie. Granted she probably wouldn't have been able to stop them anyway but it's not Debbie's responsibility to take care of Liam. If Fiona's goals are the same from season one, there would be food in the house, bills paid on time and she would be taking care of Liam. She doesn't even live at the Gallagher house until Ian comes home."
shameless,3bdhdq,Cliffschetti,3,Sun Jun 28 09:27:50 2015 UTC,Ar Fiona...are you kidding me dude? She is their parent and guardian and she was too busy marrying dudes she just met or doing other shit to bother taking care of the kids.
shameless,3bdhdq,Soperos,2,Mon Jun 29 11:34:49 2015 UTC,"Very much enjoyed your post! I agree with both what you have said about Fiona and what others have said as well. i don't think it's necessarily sloppy writing, I think she's just fucking up bad. And while it is annoying to see her going from guy to guy to guy, I'm sure we all know that girl (or guy) who honestly does this in real life. It's might not make for the best plot line, but it's very realistic.  My favorite part about your post though, was what you wrote about Debbie. YES, YES AND YES. I understand that trying to get pregnant and the rape might have been a little over the top, and watching her character on tv was annoying and cringe-worthy but that IS exactly how it is to be a teenage girl. I can understand, how in her mind she doesn't understand why the decisions she's making are wrong. She thinks, especially because she's always had to act older and was always mature for her age, that she knows every thing. I don't think enough people also realize, that she might still be the same mature girl with just a shitton of stupid hormones and bad influences/role models. She doesn't lose her virginity to someone random or some old man off the internet. She loses it to someone she really cares about and doesn't understand how or why it was rape. She finally picks a nice guy and she thinks that having a family will have her feeling loved forever in a good family. But AS soon as she realizes she's pregnant I think she realized ""wtf did i just do"" she's not an idiot, she's just a teenage girl who is making some shitty decisions."
shameless,3bdhdq,freakingaby,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:12:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. I also just finished the season in the last couple weeks (and re-subbed here), and I don't know anybody in my world who watches this show. Thanks for reminding me how much I enjoyed season 5. This is probably the only show I'm watching (current - RIP Mad Men) where I feel a genuine emotional connection to the characters. There were some slips this year (Jimmy didn't need to come back - besides, he's busy hassling a clone over on Orphan Black now), but overall the writing is still really strong. And the casting is, of course, superb. I agree with everything you said about Debbie - the actress nailed it."
shameless,3bdhdq,Strabbo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:22:45 2015 UTC,"The Ian & Mickey storyline needs to considered with the fact that the writers did what they did knowing Noel Fisher is more likely than not to not return next season. Indeed he and Cameron has been saying to fans in the past months that Mickey will not be returning next season, and it was ""a good time"" for Mickey to go, thereby leaving doubts as to when if ever Mickey will be coming back to fix that god-awful ending he had.  (Of course, it's all fan rumor of what was said when people met with the actors, and everyone could say things for a variety of reasons, but if even if you consider the ""smoke"" part critically in ""there's no smoke without fire"", it does nudge the balance quite a bit towards it's true that Mickey won't return for next season at least.)"

I have no idea what it's like to be on lithium, but if it anything like the show portrays then I think suicide would be the better route IMHO. What's the point of living if you can't be yourself?"
