ReversedGIFS,3713r4,wobblymadman,1 point,Sun May 24 21:05:31 2015 UTC,Hahaha looks like it is a real trick.
ReversedGIFS,36tuwf,ShaidarHaran2,8,Fri May 22 02:01:48 2015 UTC,Fairly certain this has already been posted here mate.
ReversedGIFS,36tuwf,sanchosuitcase,2,Fri May 22 06:22:38 2015 UTC,"Seen this one twice before. I really do hate these blatant reposts. Then again, as long as pale get front page /gilded for them why would they stop?"
ReversedGIFS,36tuwf,20percenttaco,1 point,Fri May 22 10:37:29 2015 UTC,Seems as though people never even bother to check the rules/top posts
ReversedGIFS,36tuwf,philal,3,Fri May 22 09:13:20 2015 UTC,What's the story behind the original gif?
ReversedGIFS,36tuwf,Jason_Alexander,1 point,Fri May 22 12:51:55 2015 UTC,I would like to know this as well

ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,calmrice,33,Fri May 22 22:42:41 2015 UTC,You sure this gif is reversed? Or why did you post this here? I don't get it....
ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,kaasmaniac,11,Sat May 23 07:33:59 2015 UTC,It's probably because you're on mobile- Gfycat's reverse flag doesn't work there.
ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,PocketMines,9,Sat May 23 11:57:47 2015 UTC,Oh I see. Why don't people just go to a gifreverser-website and reupload to gfycat then?
ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,kaasmaniac,-36,Sat May 23 12:01:38 2015 UTC,Because for all non-mobile platforms it works fine?    I mean - you can't expect a whole sub to do something because of a handful of mobile users.    It probably won't be an issue when gfycat/google/the dev of whatever web browser or app you're using fixes it.
ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,Killerhurtz,7,Mon May 25 19:38:21 2015 UTC,"So, if he does what I said then it would be fine for everybody, not only the majority."
ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,kaasmaniac,-17,Mon May 25 20:15:46 2015 UTC,"But it's a lot of effort for a single post, and it can't be done from everywhere (for instance, several workplaces would have policies that make it hard)."
ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,Killerhurtz,3,Mon May 25 20:35:44 2015 UTC,"Dude, google gif reserver. Paste imgur link. Site creates new gif. Upload to imgur. Done. That's like, 10-20 seconds of work. If your workplace doesn't allow a random gif reverser website, then I don't believe it would allow reddit, imgur or whatever. Besides, just wait until you get home and post it then."
ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,kaasmaniac,-23,Mon May 25 21:50:34 2015 UTC,"OR simply link a gfycat link you got.    Why do other people HAVE to do things? You could also save the link and wait to view it when you have access to a desktop/laptop computer.    And my company does not allow downloads.    But seriously though, it goes both way - as many things other people could do, you have an equivalent you could do."
ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,Killerhurtz,4,Mon May 25 21:59:01 2015 UTC,"Could do that, but for me that's too much work cus I'm lazy. OP is lazy too. Result: mobile users downvote him. He is the one who is expected to make a quality post. Eiter way, what would be easier. One upload, or 100 people saving a post to view it later?"
ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,kaasmaniac,-15,Mon May 25 22:04:39 2015 UTC,"Considering that the OP is 66% upvoted, I'd say that mobile people are a minority (because let's face it there's probably more people downvoting it for not liking it than for it being on mobile).    Seriously - if you're too lazy to press a single button to see it later, it's a whole other level of lazy."
ReversedGIFS,36xgo4,Killerhurtz,2,Mon May 25 22:26:58 2015 UTC,it doesn't work on RES popups either.

ReversedGIFS,35thm8,CCCrank,5,Wed May 13 17:59:10 2015 UTC,"Pallas's cat:       The Pallas's cat (Otocolobus manul), also called manul, is a small wild cat with a broad but fragmented distribution in the grasslands and montane steppes of Central Asia. It is negatively affected by habitat degradation, prey base decline, and hunting, and has therefore been classified as Near Threatened by IUCN since 2002.   The Pallas's cat was named after the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas, who first described the cat in 1776 under the binomial Felis manul.
