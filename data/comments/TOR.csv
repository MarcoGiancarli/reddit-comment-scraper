TOR,3e2cvl,necronhyperion,3,Tue Jul 21 12:37:50 2015 UTC,"This is a very ambiguous question. There are many things to consider, so you may want to follow one or many steps below, depending on the circumstance.  Keep yourself anonymous   This means that the email account that you use to send the email is not traced back to you. At its simplest, it means using Tor when you send the email. But you also need to take into consideration that if you use Tor to log into your personal email address, then even if your use Tor when you send the email, the account itself is already linked to you.   This means you will need to create a brand new email account while using Tor and ONLY log into that account from Tor. If you fuck this up just once, you're fucked. Also, make sure the email address is completely original. In other words, don't re-use any usernames or even worse, put your real name in the account. This is how DPR was caught, he had his anon accounts, but he shared the username with another account that was actually linked to him personally.  Keep the other person anonymous  If you're sending sensitive data, then the other person should take the same precautionary steps above. If you email your friend something, then the email you sent is already linked to him. It won't be too hard to figure out who you are. If you're both anonymous, then there will be no anchors to reality, and it will be MUCH harder to trace either of you.   On the other hands, if you're sending an anonymous email (like perhaps a leak to the press), this step isn't necessary, but you might want to use PGP (see below).  Exchange email addresses securely  All of the above is worthless if after you've both created your anonymous emails you text each other the emails addresses. Because now, those email addresses are linked to your phone accounts, which are linked to you. Exchange them in person or through other secure channels.  Use PGP  PGP encrypts email. Here are instructions on how to set it up. If both parties follow the steps above, then the addresses can't be traced to their owners. However, the contents of the email is still visible to an attacker. If you sign your name at the bottom of the email then you're fucked. If you send an attachment which contains metadata which reveals your name or location, you're fucked. If the information is supposed to be confidential, then you're fucked. PGP will protect the contents of the email and keep it between you and the other person. An important thing to note is that the subject line isn't encrypted (so be smart with that or leave it blank).  Use TAILS  If you're super paranoid and you would worry about an attacker trying to get a hold of your PGP keys, then TAILS will offer an extra degree of help.  Again, some of this might be overkill, depending on what you're doing, so choose wisely. That's all I can think of for now, but feel free to ask questions! Good luck!"
TOR,3e2cvl,0hmyscience,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:40:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for your very informative answer. Do you know any way to send audio file and when the receiver hear it then the file deletes? Also do you know any secure and anonymous service like dropbox etc to upload the files? Again thanks for your reply
TOR,3e2cvl,0hmyscience,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:56 2015 UTC,"PGP will encrypt any attachments, so if you send the audio file attached then you should be fine in that regard.   As far as dropbox goes, it sucks. Even if you can upload and download from/to it anonymously (not really sure if you can), you can consider that file compromised as soon as it's up. If you're uploading any file anywhere, you should check that the metadata doesn't trace back to you. I believe TAILS has a tool that helps you deal with this, but I'm sure there are others out there. I don't really know of any to recommend, but they're there. Snowden recommended the use of SpiderOak instead of Dropbox, so you could look into that, but again I can't give you any more info since I don't know. Honestly, I'd stick to just attaching it, uploading anywhere is just another failure point.  Lastly, I don't know of any way to make the file self destruct, and quite frankly, I think whatever method you come up with will not be hard to work around."

TOR,3e04zc,AcesTraces,3,Mon Jul 20 22:54:50 2015 UTC,"No, de-anonymization attacks in nothing but JavaScript have been used in the past by U.S. government agencies. Look into the Freedom Hosting takedown and the recent pedophile forum takedown. The former used a drive-by JavaScript exploit to load persistent malware onto the visitors' machines (only an out-of-date version of Tor Browser was vulnerable, though), while fewer details are known about the more recent one, the Ars Technica piece of the bust states that the FBI used a three-tiered implant on the site that did not involve any malware installation, it simply executed in the browser to ""ping"" an FBI server with the visitor's true IP address and some other identifying data. The first tier of their implant attempted to do this with Adobe Flash, the second with JAVA, and the last with simple JavaScript alone. More details will probably emerge as that criminal proceeding goes on.  TL;DR: yes, your friend could very well have been de-anonymized. The likelihood of something happening as a result is entirely dependent on who was operating that site and what their intentions are."
TOR,3e04zc,sapiophile,2,Tue Jul 21 01:45:47 2015 UTC,"Not sure I believe the new exploit didnt install malware like the FH takedown. The FH busts used JS to load malware on the users computer then sent info back to a server through their normal ISP thus showing their tru IP. It also grabbed the hostname, mac addy and correlated cookies for the user session. The one a few years back used a flash exploit. This new one combined both of those and added in Java just as a cherry on top.   The user session adata (cookies) is important because its how they track what a user does. Just landing on a page if it has no details on whats inside the site is not enough probable cause for a warrant. They need persistent data on what the user viewed, how often they viewed it and if they posted anything else in order to show intent. This is why they use malware and correlate session data to identity a user.  This guys friend might be in the clear if he landed on a page and left asap once he realized what was up. If he got exploited and had cookies enabled then they would see if he actually surfed the site then he'd be in some shit.

I only say that this recent takedown didn't involve persistent malware because that's what the FBI is saying, very very clearly (they learned from the FH bust, which has brought them a lot of grief in the courts due to unanswered questions about the legality of malware implants without a warrant). Who knows if they're telling the truth or not, but I do actually have faith in them to cover their asses in this way - it would be quite an embarrassment if they had to drop charges against thousands of pedophiles because they overstepped the law, and they know that."

TOR,3dt8ld,Shibboleeth,2,Sun Jul 19 08:07:06 2015 UTC,"Well, not exactly.  The IP address that you're sending packets from would be known as a TOR exit node. There's no entrance node mapping that I'm aware of, or any relay mapping for that matter*, though such maps could be built.  So if you only hit a given server from TOR, the best they can tell is that you're coming from a TOR exit node, and only if they're pulling information from certain groups that have that data. Or have built up their own log of that data.  However, if you've logged in through a clear channel previously and then start logging into a site through TOR they'll still know who you are.  Take Reddit for example if I login as me Reddit will record my IP address. If I logout, and then log in again through a TOR exit node, they still have my original IP Address on file, and can associate any ""anonymous"" posts back to my original IP address.  If I access Reddit through TOR, create a new account, and only use that login through TOR, then the only IP address that will ever be associated with that account is a TOR IP address, there's less of a chance that they'll be able to follow the path back to me because of how TOR's routing works.  Now there are all kinds of caveats that apply to the second scenario (browser fingerprinting, TOR relays being compromised by government entities, zero day exploits available through browser extensions like Flash, etc.) That can be used to compromise a TOR user, but I'm getting a little out of scope here and I also don't want to start in with FUD.  I'm not saying that TOR isn't good, actually it's pretty great to the best of everyone's knowledge. But there is some possibility that your identity can be compromised; though typically the primary reason someone's identity is compromised is not due to weakness in the system, the most common weakness is the person.  *This is hugely up for debate, as anyone that has done such would be wise to not spill that information."

I have not watched the video, but one of the known issues with this design, is an attacker can predict what hidden service directories will be responsible for a given hidden service, at any given time.  This allows the attacker to position their nodes at the right place in the hash-ring, such that at their chosen time, they become responsible for the hidden service. The attacker can then perform attacks, such as just shutting down their nodes to disable access to the hidden service.  Just ask if you have any more questions :)"
TOR,3dm6ga,chrisb8,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:35:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer Why does the client know the the time-period that was used by the HS ??? (In my question I edited the computation of time-period.) The HS takes its system-time in seconds, does some computation and gets the time-period. Notice that there is no modulo operation.  So how could a client possibly know the value of this specific time-period, aside from brute-forcing the formula for each second of the last hour and asking the corresponding HSDir?  And something I just realized right know: The HS publishes its Descriptor every hour (with new IndroductionPoints). Normally It should stay with the same 6 HSDirs for one day but if it calculates its descriptor-id  every time it updates the IntroductionPoints, the HSDirs should be completely different every hour. That is, as long as the HS actually updates the Descriptor-ID , which I guess might not be the case .... ?"
TOR,3dm6ga,chrisb8,2,Sat Jul 18 09:14:01 2015 UTC,"I have put some python code at the bottom of this post. As you should be able to see from the post, the time-period does not change, for 24 hours, so there is no need to brute force every value, as it only changes once every 24 hours. This is just done using integer arithmetic, if you change the values to floats (adding .0 to the end in python), then you will see the number does change, but the integer part stays the same (with respect to the above).  I would also read the two paragraphs beginning at https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/rend-spec.txt#n506 as they discuss more about this behavior.  As for how often a hidden service changes its introduction points, I am not sure this is tightly defined in the spec, but as far as I remember, little t tor (the c implementation) does not change the introduction points for a hidden service often.  I am not sure I have directly answered any of your questions, but hopefully this will help.  Implementation of the example here https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/rend-spec.txt#n257  >>> current_time = 1188241957 >>> permanent_id_byte = 143 >>> def time_period(current_time, permanent_id_byte): ...     return (current_time + permanent_id_byte * 86400 / 256) / 86400 ...  >>> time_period(current_time, permanent_id_byte) 13753 >>> one_hour = 60 * 60 >>> time_period(current_time + one_hour, permanent_id_byte) 13753 >>> time_period(current_time + 12 * one_hour, permanent_id_byte) 13753 >>> time_period(current_time + 24 * one_hour, permanent_id_byte) 13754"
TOR,3dm6ga,chrisb8,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:52:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that really helped and answered some of the questions!  For me it was not really obvious that the formulas computation only changes every 24h, but this clears things up.  Last thing I still don't know is how the attack mentioned in the video works. What they describe is that you can put your own HSDir between the current HSDir and the computed value of descriptor-id, which would make the HS send its descriptors to you.  Now, as far as I know, the hash-id of a tor-node refers to the hashed public key of that node. that beeing said, to place a node at the before mentioned place, I would have to keep generating key-pairs until the hash of the public key fits.   The question now is: Can I register a new public key for a node without restarting the specific node / loosing the HSDir flag (which takes 5 day now to get) ? I suppose the answer is yes, because otherwise an attack like this would not work, right?"

Because let's say that I raise an eyebrow with a comment. Let's say I wrote the comment via Tor. So they won't be able to track me. But they do know that /u/0hmyscience made the comment. So you start monitoring that account. A few days later, I sign in with this account again, but this time I don't use Reddit. Now, they know my location, and they can probably link this account to my other activity (like my email, which definitely doxxes me). Even then, if they had ALREADY correlated my email and reddit account, they could have known as soon as I made the comment.  If on the other hand, I never use Tor with this account, but I keep a different account for Reddit that I exclusively use via Tor, then that account remains anon. The second I use that account outside of Tor, or the second I somehow link that account to my email, that account is compromised and has lost it's anonymity.  So, if you're trying to stay anon, you must have accounts that you use EXCLUSIVELY through Tor, AND never interact with the accounts that you use outside of Tor. If you break these two rules even once, you're right, it's pointless. Otherwise, it's very effective.

Furthermore if the host machine was compromised then your whole session could be compromised.  You might as well just install Tails onto an external drive (and partition the drive if you don't want to use the whole thing) then boot into Tails. This also allows you to run Tails as a live session which deletes all local files and wipes the memory when it shuts down. The only problem with this method is that the BIOS of the host machine needs to be able to boot to USB, if it doesn't then you'll need a boot loader."

TOR,3dbt70,ApplicableSongLyric,2,Thu Jul 16 20:45:21 2015 UTC,"Well, ignore the drug and market talk and pay attention to the OpSec advice and suggestions on how to connect the server to the Tor network.     Remember when I said to take note of hosts that don't ban tor outright? This is the part where you give back to the community in the form of tor relays or bridges. [3] The feel-good aspects of this move are along the same lines as drug barons who build schools and hospitals, but this is more immediately self-serving. You're going buy several servers to set up strictly as relays or bridges, then configure your hidden service box to use only those relays or bridges to enter the tor network. Here's where things start to get theoretical.    If an adversary is running a guard node discovery attack -- in which an attacker is able to determine the node you're using to enter the tor network -- against your service and you're using your own relays as entry nodes, the damage they can do will be limited to DoS (Denial of Service) if your relays are not linkable to your identity. However, if you're entering the tor network with bridge nodes, an attacker will probably say ""WTF?"" at first unless they determine they've found a bridge node. Bridge nodes don't use nearly as much bandwidth as relays because there is not a public list of them, so an intelligence agency would have less traffic to sift through, which makes correlation easier. On the other hand, using bridge nodes also allows you to run obfsproxy [4] on both the bridges and your hidden service. obfsproxy allows you to make tor traffic appear to be another type of traffic, which is a good defense against non-Five Eyes entities. For example, your hosting provider may decide to monitor for tor traffic for their own reasons. Just make sure your relays/bridges aren't linkable to you or to each other.  One last thing about guard node discovery attacks: The Naval Research Lab published a paper in July 2014 about the ""Sniper Attack,"" [5] which in short works like this: The attacker discovers your guard nodes, then uses an amplified DoS trick to exhaust the memory on all of your nodes. The attacker keeps doing this until your hidden service uses guard nodes that they control. Then it's game over. If your hidden service's entry nodes are all specified in your torrc file and they get DoSed, your service will go offline. In this situation, if all of your relays are down, you essentially have an early warning canary that you're being targeted. In other words: This is the best possible time to book your one-way ticket to your chosen non-extradition country. For those of you with a background in writing exploits, this is similar in principle to how stack smashing protection will render some exploits either unable to function or will turn them into a DoS. Personally, I recommend an ever-changing list of relays or bridges. Add a few new ones at a pre-determined interval, and gradually let old ones go unpaid."
TOR,3dbt70,sapiophile,0,Thu Jul 16 20:50:31 2015 UTC,"The smart thing to do to keep a hidden service strongly anonymous is to run it behind an Isolating Tor Proxy. Whonix is an operating system that can make this sort of configuration somewhat simplified. For maximum security, you will want the server and the proxy on two separate physical machines, not just VMs.  Monitoring and ""take it offline"" tools are the same as with any server installation."
TOR,3dafy5,Joo3145813,4,Tue Jul 14 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"Only the first node can see your IP address (because you are connecting to them and they have to be able to respond to you). Your IP isn't in the packet. The exit relay only knows to send information back to the middle relay, and the middle relay only knows to send information back to the guard (the first node).

TOR,3dafy5,sapiophile,0,Wed Jul 15 05:34:27 2015 UTC,"For most users who need ""strong"" anonymity, a good recommendation is to use Tails, and ideally to use it on a physical computer that is not used for anything relating to your identity or ""normal"" internet activities. If you need absolute maximum security, your best bet is probably to use two separate physical computers arranged as a workstation and an Isolating Tor Proxy - the operating system Whonix is pre-configured to set up an implementation like this.  No matter what your setup is, though, the most important thing is to have solid knowledge of the ways that anonymity software cannot protect you.  It is also important, when using Tor Browser (as you should be), to click the Tor Button, select ""Privacy and Security Settings..."" and set the Security Slider at ""High,"" and do not ever reduce it from that setting. And of course, always ensure that your software is completely up to date.  Also know, however, that it is not possible, ever, to ""completely"" hide your identity. All you can do is make attacks against your privacy as expensive as possible. With enough care and luck, those costs can exceed the annual budgets of global superpower nations. But nothing is ever assured, and the tables can turn at any moment if a unique software vulnerability is discovered, for instance."

You can get it by clicking through on the Tor Downloads page to ""View all Downloads..."", which currently links to https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en (it may be called the ""Expert Bundle"").  Once you have standalone Tor running, you can just set whatever browser you want to use a SOCKS5 proxy at 127.0.0.1 port 9050, and its traffic will be routed through Tor. If you run into any problems, consult the documentation or ask me, here, and I'll try to help.

Lots of comments here both from those that are curious about pedos and those that hate pedos. This is starting to look more like an AMA when I think the post was supposed to draw attention to what a shitty job journalists do when covering tor. They make the cp side of it to be tons of servers loaded with endless fresh new content when its really regularly less than 4 servers reposting content made years ago. The latest update was another server was busted last week and some people on the cp forums are getting really scared.  Someone asked about therapy for us. It wouldn't work. If you're straight, do you think any amount of therapy would turn you gay? There's also a lot of different personalities. Some are living in different realities and have convinced themselves of things that aren't possible. Some seriously believe everyone is a child lover. Others believe adults having sex with kids is happening every minute of the day all over the world. Try convincing them of anything different and suggesting something closer to reality and they lose their minds while some of the others that are just as unstable and living in the same fantasy will come to their defense. They need to believe that lie to cope with life and in some weird way that alternate reality is their outlet. Others will make up stories about experiences they swear they had, but there are almost always details that conflict or some parts that don't even make sense. The admins even say a lot of people know the claimed experiences aren't real but will post a compliment to let them enjoy the fantasy more. Its weird but its an outlet that doesn't involve kids. A lot of the users would surprise you guys in a good way. Most say they are around kids a lot or were at some stage of their life but say they never touched a child. A lot realize kids are sexual but they also realize those kids would chose a sex partner of their own age over an adult age and because of this never get sexual with kids. If I had to guess a number I'd say somewhere like 1 in 1,000 of the users on the forum have been sexual around kids, the rest are fantasizing about it but would never do it in real ife if they had the chance."

Those who talk in the most frightening and offensive way are more likely NOT to be actual offenders, but are fantasising (much in the same way the vast majority of those who fantasise about rape do not go on to commit/subject themselves to rape).

The experience of my Psychologists (plural) who specialise in treating people with Paraphilias like my own The knowledge that things rarely escalate. Usually those who are Serial Killers or Child Abusers aren't found to have outlets. It's extraordinarily rare to find ones that do, and these people are usually triggered based on abuse (substance or personal) that there is a long history of Psychologists standing up for those who, for instance, draw horrific murder drawings while a teenager. That's not saying that all of those have a Paraphilia, but that Psychologists recognise and understand that having outlets is healthy, not unhealthy.   Please understand that research into Paraphilias is still in its infancy because getting funding for study is practically impossible. Recent strides in Neuroscience and Neuropsychology have significantly helped matters, but this is based on what is heavily theorised (and which my own experiences support - having a Paraphilia like mine is like a pressure buildup... Without a release the pressure increases, and increases, until it pervades almost every moment of wakefulness. It's terrifying, and I'm incredibly glad that I was able to find outlets as well as treatment)."

It doesn't matter if the person viewing it is paying for it or not, it creates a community and a market for CP to be produced. It doesn't matter if it is happening in secrecy or not, the end result is someone somewhere is raping a child. Acting like one pedophile violating a child is OK because it prevents another pedophile from doing it is twisted and wrong. Trying to pass it off as therapy and medicine is twisted and wrong. People who produce it and view it should be punished by the law, and put away if necessary. Life sucks, people are born broken. It is just how things are. I am not buying this whole we can use it as a crutch thing, I am not paying for it, I am using it to stop myself from acting on urges.

However yes, if we were to somehow eradicate child porn from existence, in all its forms, while leaving the philia intact, you would see a huge increase in the amount of children actually abused.   We would like to state the lowered amount of child abusers is because the law is stricter (it isn't) and the detection methods are better (that part is minorly accurate), but the truth of it is that just as the amount of child abuse has lowered, so to has the accessibility to cp increased. I find this correlation interesting, but understand it doesn't necessarily equate to causation. Given what I know of Paraphilias however, I don't doubt it's extremely relevant."

I seek professional help from one of the best in the field, and the same person sees many pedophiles.   Consultation Therapy isn't a solid outlet for philias, in fact, the best they can really do is help you understand why and how, and help you down a CBT pathway (which will help, but not hugely).   Things that help:  Having legal access to outlets. Outlets stop the urges from continuing to rise, having access to them means that they are controlling their urges. By controlling their urges they aren't out there actually physically having sex with underage people... A good thing, no?  Understanding that Outlets might be odd in nature. For instance, there exists a solid portion of people who like to role play they are underage, even in sexual scenarios. Having a relationship with someone like that will be healthy for both involved, as well as consensual and legal.  I really feel the biggest thing about improving the knowledge people have on the topic is understanding that firstly, a pedo viewing cp (or reading stories about it, or writing stories about it, or watching hentai involving it) is likely keeping their philia in check, as opposed to letting it spiral out of control.  Secondly, that these people are often born that way, or gain it from an acquired brain injury. That's right, we lock people up because they are born different, and don't have a 'cure' for it.  Thirdly, that it's okay to feel and think like that. That the cause is mostly neurological in nature and can be managed, as long as the person is aware of strategies to stop it spiralling out of control, and is able to seek help for it. The problem is we (society) instead vilify these people, which leads them to internalise it, which increases the risk that they will act."
TOR,3cpu43,BaneWilliams,20,Fri Jul 10 00:08:08 2015 UTC,"Having legal access to outlets. Outlets stop the urges from continuing to rise, having access to them means that they are controlling their urges. By controlling their urges they aren't out there actually physically having sex with underage people... A good thing, no?     Ha, you would think so, but instead we have countries that make drawings of fictional characters depicted as underage as ""illegal"", and the protestors against such work go so far as the call it child porn in order to really stick it to the people who possess it. Annoyingly, this is a HUGE slap in the face for those of us that actually do have child porn of ourselves floating around out there.    Men masturbating to pictures made of me when I was 9 does not anger me. I see it as potentially preventing another victim from being introduced into the cycle. The idiots that criminalize the aforementioned illustrated outlets fill me with rage -- they're essentially trading actual, physical contact with children in exchange for something that should only be a crime against taste."

How should society react to disadvantages mutations?  And at the moment pedophilia is a very disadvantages mutation.  Serial killers are born that way too or had the shit abused out of them as kids.  Not their fault sure but what do you want me to do about it?  Id love to get my hands on the parents but even if I did, the serial killer would still need to be permanently put away.  I'm sorry but society doesn't have the resources to take care of every bad mutation and if we have to choose I'd rather try to help those who can't and haven't caused harm like kids with down syndrome and handicaps and then kids in Africa.

TOR,3cpu43,Ada1629,5,Fri Jul 10 15:33:02 2015 UTC,"Okay, some misconceptions here that I suggest you perhaps learn about.    A Paraphilia isn't a mutation. It's not Genetic, it isn't extra chromosomal and it isn't based in a kind of neuckeotide malfunction. There is evicpdence that ONE person who also had a host of other mental problems had pedophilia, and therefore the person came up with the idea it must be caused by mutation. It isn't.  This Paraphilia has existed for as long as translatable records about our species have. In fact, it is only extremely recently historically that it was made against the law to act on it.  Serial Killers aren't born that way or were victims of abuse. They acted on a comorbidic philia, which is why they killed. Please note not all erotophonophiles turn into Serial Killers, in fact, a vast majority do not. It's the Act which separates them. pedophiles are not child abusers. Child abusers are child abusers. Yes, this stems almost entirely from someone who has pedophilia, but there has yet to be a single case of someone who has managed their pedophilia who went on to become a Child Abuser unless they already had committed Child Abuse or had extra mental issues that triggered after substance abuse.  Pedophiles haven't caused harm to kids. You are once again confusing the Paraphilia with the activity. Child Abusers harm children, just like Serial Killers kill people, but Psychopaths and Sociopaths do not.  We do as society have the resources. This is proven by the fact that we spend so much money, time, and manpower hunting pedophiles down for what amounts to keeping the Paraphilia in check, and then locking them away. Especially since managing Pedophilia can be done by probably all of two sessions with a talented neuropsychologist."

TOR,3cpu43,The_Fifteenth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:14:23 2015 UTC,"A Paraphilia isn't a mutation. It's not Genetic   How does it come to be then?  This is a real question btw.    This Paraphilia has existed for as long as translatable records about our species have.   That doesn't mean it can't be a mutation does it?  I'm guessing Down Syndrome has been around for a long time but it is a mutation.  I'd say blonde hair was caused by a mutation as well...I'm not sure about the distinctions though and would be interested to more about this.   In fact, it is only extremely recently historically that it was made against the law to act on it.   That may be true but I hope that was just a neutral statement i.e that you're not using the fact that it has been around for a long time as a way of defending it.  In the past when we were more physical creatures it may have been fine to rely on the physical stages of development.  Although even historically I don't see many benefits of pedophilia for the children or the adults.  Perhaps it groomed kids for earlier sex i.e. be ready as soon as they hit puberty?  Now however, we rely on our mental strengths more and for that we need a longer childhood and slower emotional development which seems would be disrupted by sex.   Serial Killers aren't born that way or were victims of abuse.   Again, how do they come to be then?  I'm not saying it can't be a mix of nature and nurture but you seem to be saying it's neither and I don't see how that's possible.  Substance abuse would be both nurture and nature actually.  And it's not all caused by substance abuse...a lot of people abuse substances without developing into pedophiles.   pedophiles are not child abusers That is true and I'm sorry for conflating the terms.  And it is very important to clear in the distinction.  What I think really hurts this cause however is the very lenient treatment of child abusers by the pedophilia as a sickness (born that way) explanation.  I would be very happy to spend resources on pedophiles who have never acted on their urges to help them IF we protected society from those who already have.  I'm sorry I don't wish my taxes to TRY to rehab child abusers by allowing them to walk among us.  That's just not a risk worth taking.  I would rather feed children in Africa with those resources.  It is really beyond me how we can justify letting out child abusers and spending any resources helping when we have vets and the mentally ill on the streets and kids going hungry!  And pedophiles fighting to not act needing help!  First things first.     I think we'd all be less afraid and rightly so if the distinction between child abusers and pedophiles was clearer legally.  If we were guaranteed that the pedophiles walking among us have not committed a crime against children as far as the law could tell than we would have an easier time being accepting them.  And yes it is very important to help pedophiles not act out on their impulses.  As well, putting 17 year old boys on sex offender lists for sex with 14 year olds disguising themselves as as 17 year olds doesn't help.  I would do away with sex offender lists - either keep them in prison or help them not go there in the first place."
TOR,3cpu43,Ada1629,3,Fri Jul 10 15:20:16 2015 UTC,"I can't quote well because I'm on mobile, but I will try and answer as best I can.   How does it come to be then?   Research on Paraphilias is mostly in its infancy, as it's taken up till now for anyone to have a meaningful desire to understand and attempt to diagnose/cure them. Neuropsychology is a fairly new field, but the science is growing by leaps and bounds annually.   What we do believe is that Philias come about from hormonal regulation. This neurobiological response causes a lot of our early development, and is not thought to stem from genetic anomolies. Remember, it's societal construct that makes this action wrong (which is a good thing), so it's unlikely to be caused by mutation.    hope that's a neutral statement   It very much is. I defend pedophilia (and any Paraphilia really), I don't defend Child Abuse. One of those things a person has a choice in, the other they do not.  To your other statement, it seems wise to think that it was biologically to ready children for sexual maturity. Remember, our world is evolving significantly faster than we are.    Serial Killers    Once again it's about not confusing the two things. I have the philia that leads many to being a serial killer, I actually gained it from an acquired brain injury, but most are born with it. Serial Killers aren't born Serial Killers. They have factors which lead to their philia needing release (ie; they have no outlet for it, or their only outlet is real life activities). So yes, it's both Nature (The Philia, unless gained in my way, or via abuse) and Nurture (Being unable to find an outlet for the desires, especially being ridiculed or shamed into the belief that they are wrong/evil. Abuse can certainly increase the likelihood, but it's not required).   As for your last paragraph, we certainly agree there. Unfortunately, it will be a very long time before that occurs."

Something being 'new' has no value to people per se; it just has to be 'new' to them. Which isn't a problem with a large existing amount of media.  I understand that the first response to all of this is that ""it's disgusting"", but I'd say that it's time to stop following our guts, and instead look at what really prevents child abuse. Evidently, current practices aren't working.  If we need to accept something 'disgusting' that already exists, in order to prevent harm in the future, then it is still going to be the better option. And that option needs some serious investigation.    Aside, not towards you specifically as this could've been anyone, but I find it deeply disturbing that one would downvote a comment in favour of reducing actual harm to children."

Arresting those who watch child porn won't stop those who make such material. Let's suppose you catch all of the viewers as of today: great.

TOR,3cpu43,BaneWilliams,7,Fri Jul 10 08:27:42 2015 UTC,"He's not vilifying the op because he was born differently.   Yours and other's comparison with homosexuality isn't exactly apt is it. Homosexual acts with a consenting adult aren't coercive. While human sexuality is indeed a complex subject, and people come to emotional and sexual maturity at different ages, the act of sex with a minor is inherently coercive due to the vast cognitive and emotional differences between the adult and the child (victim). I'm not underestimating the kind of inner turmoil that must be caused by desiring something that is ultimately dangerous and wrong and which causes pain to someone that can't defend themselves. I'm sure that it's torture, but op and anyone that finds themselves in that situation needs to find help dealing with those desires in a way that keeps them from hurting anyone.   Lots of people debate whether there can be something called ""ethically filmed porn""...but I assure you that there is no such thing as ""ethically filmed child porn"". In this case participating AT ALL is playing a part in someone else's harm.  Don't take the fact that society is always looking for small groups that can be mercilessly prosecuted and made public example of as some kind of excuse for this behavior. Yes, the way that society wants to seek out and hurt people who are sick is itself sick. That doesn't change the nature of this act. It's assault and its rightfully a serious crime."
TOR,3cpu43,Blahbl4hblah,4,Fri Jul 10 04:12:56 2015 UTC,"He stated ""get what you deserve"" I'm assuming he didn't mean the help of a clinical psychologist and instead meant Prison. I doubt I'm wrong in that assumption.   I wasn't comparing it with homosexuality. I never have. I have made comparisons to Erotophonophilia and Pedophilia, because they are both Paraphilias and stem from exactly the same causes, and have almost identical treatment options.   Mine involves the death of another human, the other persons the sexualisation of a minor. Both are completely fucked up, but what you don't seem to understand is that doing what he/she is doing (viewing cp) is dealing with those desires in a way that keeps them from hurting anyone.   Lots of people debate the ethics of free range vs cage eggs, yet people still eat cage eggs. But of course that doesn't matter because it's a different species. We could go around and around on this topic all day, and I do not feel that more cp should be produced... In fact I've proven that in this very thread by a response I gave about 10 minutes ago. There is already enough pre-existing content to sate philias.   You seem to be running under the belief that being a pedophile equates to having sex with kids. It doesn't. In fact, the acts that OP has admitted to undertaking are by their very nature, stopping that from happening."
TOR,3cpu43,BaneWilliams,3,Fri Jul 10 12:56:31 2015 UTC,"Viewing the material is participation in the abuse of the victim. Participating in that crime is wrong. Yes, the help of a clinical psychologist is a good idea...but if you are participating in the abuse of someone that can't defend themselves you do not deserve treatment. You deserve punishment for the crime. I'm not even a particularly strident law and order type, but the production and consumption of CP is abuse of children and is illegal for valid, good, and useful reasons. If he seeks help, and stops, then yes he deserves a healthy and free life. I hope that happens.   I fully understand that being a pedo doesn't necessarily involve having sex with children, but physically having sex with children isn't the sum total of it. Viewing the material is participation. I don't think that participating in the crime of abuse is a valid means of controlling their desires.   If you are talking about role-play material where consenting adults are playing out a fantasy, that's one thing. Viewing actual abuse is entirely different and wrong.  Caged eggs? Don't ever use that comparison with someone in actual conversation. That's just a FYI from me to you.  Jesus, it's really a strange place for me to be in the law and order position. I'm very sympathetic to sick people who need help. If that sickness involves hurting people, though, then the order of precedence starts with stopping them, getting the victims help,  and then getting the offender help."

How is my philia any different from ops?   You don't think viewing cp is a valid means of controlling their desires. Well who are you to determine that? Do you have a strong philia? Do you have a degree in neuropsychology?   You have a strong belief, and I get that. You're passionate, and I truly like that.

Your situation is slightly different in that the material you use to sate your philia can be produced in the open by any number of valid sources. There isn't a valid source for genuine CP. Perhaps there should be more legal room for simulated CP, but that too...usually called barely legal or something like that...can be pretty sketchy in it's production.  Thank you for being reasonable, yourself. Believe me, I appreciate your empathy for others with philia and the explanations that you've provided. I hope some of the other people reading these threads can see through some of their gut reaction's.   That's one of the things I despise the most. Calling something ""evil"" or prescribing some kind of sickness to the ""soul"" keeps people from being treated and breaking the cycles of abuse that exist in many families.

It's not getting pictures from the person who murdered them so much as it's getting pictures from the court case files. Granted, I imagine that new content shows itself on the odd occasion, and I have little doubt it is immediately reported to the police or picked up by them (Since LEOs are active in those forums, and are often the ones spreading the content in the first place).   I feel the correct view lies somewhere in the middle of the views we share. Mine is perhaps too empathetic, as I am someone who understands the struggles of having a Paraphilia.

TOR,3cpu43,gwern,14,Fri Jul 10 14:20:18 2015 UTC,Your first paragraph was...most of it wasn't rape? Most of the kids appeared to be engaged willingly?   I physically shuddered when I read that. The people who made those films need to be incarcerated and I hope that you find help. I can't believe the casual way that you stated that. I'm sure that you are probably numb to the moral bloviating that people do about your condition...but that opening paragraph displays a lack of empathy that is fucking stunning. Mind blowing. People are hurt to make those films. You are participating in their abuse. You can't make that alright. Get help and stop.
TOR,3cpu43,Blahbl4hblah,-1,Fri Jul 10 17:49:41 2015 UTC,Well said.

TOR,3cpu43,BaneWilliams,5,Fri Jul 10 00:42:52 2015 UTC,"I have a question to you, had to create a throw away just for this, before I get to that though I need to fill in some back story. I was a sexually active child from the age of 7. I was experimenting with peers and adults alike.   This means that I sought and intentionally initiated sexually activity with adults. Some say that I was unable to make the decision to participate of my own free will. On the stand alone point of legality I agree as I was not eighteen, but on the mental side I knew what sex was and understood what I was doing and agreeing to. First question is here, how do you feel about this specifically?  I also understood that sex for me was pointless if not for the pure sake of enjoyment and connection with another individual. I knew because I knew I was homosexual as if it were just natural and that I wouldn't be having sex to reproduce.   I understood that what I was doing was illegal at least for my senior lovers. I learned first hand what they risked when my parents found out about one of them and pressed charges against them. But I loved sex, boys and physical affection. Despite what I see a lot of people saying here about people hurting their victims. My feelings and experiences even at 28 years old have remained unchanged.   I had a range of lovers ages 17 through 45 and it still doesn't bother me that they took advantage of me and my age to act upon their Phillia. I never once felt mistreated, my desires/wishes were never disrespected, that I was a victim or violated nor did anyone overstep the boundaries I set with them.   They never once tried to purchase my willingness either. What I mean by that is that I accepted zero bribes for participation. No food, no toys nothing. Furthermore I had emotional connections with them and found crucial bonding and affection with them. A few of them I'm still friends with. I think at around eleven years of age I realized an attraction and preference for men 20 years my senior on the grounds of their ample experience and ability to more fully express love and care.   So... having said all of this. My final questions for you are, do you think that I'm just an anomaly? And just in general what are your opinions of my experience which I've shared?  Thanks for taking the time read this. (Sorry for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation mistakes. Posting from mobile.)"
TOR,3cpu43,103-X-Ray_10-8,2,Fri Jul 10 00:14:12 2015 UTC,"Firstly it's worth stating that I'm not a psychologist or a replacement for one.   That said, I don't personally see too many issues with it. The older people are the ones with the choice to rebuff your advances. As long as you weren't manipulative in your pursuit, then chances are you just sexually matured early.   I have a friend who is in a similar boat. She sought out men from a very young age, even attempting to get with me when she was 17 (technically legal where I live, but I still didn't go there). She's a pretty well adjusted individual, although she does find her sense of self worth in other people, which I never like.   Don't worry about it too much."

TOR,3crvnh,GoatFaceTaco,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:02:04 2015 UTC,Read this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/3cpu43/a_pedophiles_statement_about_the_recent_cp/  There's a lot of distrust not only from the busts but from the police taking over identities. The cp forums on tor have never been this quiet during summertime. There have been a lot of arrests and they said there are more to come. A lot of people are scared and are playing it safe. There are still some people posting but its just not as many as we're used to. A lot of them live outside the US and don't care as much about the arrests.
TOR,3crvnh,onetime_use_00001,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:14:05 2015 UTC,i think what most tor users are concerned about is if these were due to browser exploits or social engineering work.
TOR,3crj8p,froggravy,2,Fri Jul 10 04:56:18 2015 UTC,You should look into tor bridges.

TOR,3crj8p,torrio888,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:19:13 2015 UTC,"The first sentence carries little information :-) is there any other kind nowadays?  I would advise you to sniff your boxes' network traffic, which usually yields valuable info about the nature of the block, as you can see whether connections just time out, no ACK received, or something different happens.  Tor blocks are not the norm but also not very uncommon in my experience as a frequent traveler. Of course, obfuscated bridges or VPN are helpful (never leave home without a fresh list of bridges, and the tor project even spends money on special Amazon/Google/... hosted bridges for the ""meek"" transport, which is hard to block without wrecking clearnet sites using their CDN).  Never tried OONIprobe myself, as it could be risky. But you can of course actively test the blocking policy by simply trying to connect to IP addresses in the relevant sets (current Tor relays vs. others). And always keep that packet sniffer at hand and note the results, of course. Also, there's metrics.torproject.org for, amongst other things, some country-related clues."
TOR,3crly1,Joo3145813,2,Fri Jul 10 05:25:15 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""once tor is clicked""?  Are you familiar with DNS and the http request flow?"
TOR,3crly1,xiongchiamiov,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"I understand that DNS is like a ""phone book"" for the internet, which when contacted by a client translates the address into a protocol. Not familiar with http request flow, I believe.   Basically, my question is this: How does Tor encrypt one's traffic/communication before it's sent to the very first node?  I believe the answer is TLS protocol, which creates a proxy on one's own machine via SOCKS; therefore, one can communicate because this proxy obfuscates the protocol."
TOR,3crly1,sapiophile,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"Essentially, how is security guaranteed from the host computer to the very first node/relay, how are you protected from an ""outside"" observer? Again, TLS seems to be the answer to the question, which appears to use public key cryptography/Asymmetric cryptography."

TOR,3cq9th,GordonRamsayFreeman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:32:08 2015 UTC,Personally I think PIA offers a good service but they are US based and from what we've seen US based companies are typically very complicit with three letter agencies. AirVPN is a good vpn that has a track record of standing against the US gov's data hungry policies.
