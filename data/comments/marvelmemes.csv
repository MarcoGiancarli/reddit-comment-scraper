marvelmemes,35llmm,metafaze,6,Thu May 14 02:46:02 2015 UTC,It actually dates back in American Literature for a hundred years+.  Its a racist archetype and its beginning to become painfully obvious that we need more diversity in the forefront.  On mobile right now but its called the magic negro archetype.  Google it.  Basically says black men are smart enough to progress the plot but not allowed be main characters of stories.  Terrible.
marvelmemes,35llmm,PortugalTheHam,8,Mon May 11 19:27:23 2015 UTC,"The flip side, according to some, could be that the white characters aren't capable of completing their mission without the black character, but the black character could motivate anyone in the white character's position.  That puts the black character in the true power position, though the white character retains the hero role.  Another school of thought is that the ""magic negro"" began (unintentionally) as a way to give black characters power and importance without making whites feel threatened, and as time's gone on and certain cultural barriers have fallen, it became a way to have blacks driving the plot, while still being secondary.  We're now at the point where the black characters are often past sidekicks and into partners (see: Falcon, The Flash) or main characters (Blade, Book of Eli), though there's still plenty of ""magic negro"" films around (The Legend of Bagger Vance).  It can also be question whether a role is ""magic negro"" if it's a role that could be played equally by a non-black actor.  (Morgan Freeman's role in the Batman films.)  I will now go tell my college professors I finally put my degree to use."
marvelmemes,35llmm,VAPossum,-2,Tue May 12 14:36:47 2015 UTC,"Great explanation definitely worth 30-75k in tuition.  Hopefully in this 'new day and age'  we will see actors of all races take prominent roles without being pigeonholed to specifically racial roles.  IE Static Shock, Spawn,  etc.  Like seriously what be wrong with a black hulk or batman? Hopefully soon."
marvelmemes,35llmm,PortugalTheHam,3,Tue May 12 16:32:32 2015 UTC,"We're getting there.  Ben Ulrich (granted, a secondary character) was black in Daredevil, I don't think I heard anyone complain.  Samuel L. Jackson has owned as Nick Fury.  (Based on the black Nick Fury in Ultimates, but still a new Nick Fury to many Marvel fans who never read that universe.)  Not to mention Black Panther (a black role to start with) is getting his own movie.    On the other hand, Johnny Storm is going to be black (and his sister white) in the upcoming F4 movie, and there's complaints about that, but mostly it has to do with ""it doesn't make sense they're different races"" (it can/does) and the usual cries of ""canon!""   Great explanation definitely worth 30-75k in tuition.   I can't tell if you're being sarcastic, but if you are, that's okay.  I don't mind being a cautionary tale once in a while."
marvelmemes,35llmm,VAPossum,1 point,Tue May 12 18:06:14 2015 UTC,"I'm black so It's cool to see black characters, but a black hulk?  Still far to many folks living in be past,  there's already a stigma of ""the angry black man"".  Now an angry black dude who gets stronger the more angry he gets?  That would make world breaker hulk look as dangerous as a sea cucumber.  Unfortunately there's still a fair amount of racism where in from, and there's not much that makes me more angry and sad as backwards minded people who still think things were better pre civil rights or even pre Emancipation Proclamation."
marvelmemes,35llmm,Trick502,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:38:26 2015 UTC,Its true.  Its great to see marvel remodel fury after Jackson for a new generation and the Black Panther Movie should be good.  Personally just dont like it when they call black superheroes the black (blank)   but hey whatever we ate making some considerable progress..   The interracial f4 is awesome.  Reminds me of the tv show louie.  How his ex wife is black but his kids are white (and shes white in a flashback) just just throwing colors around like a blind painter in the night  As for the tuition joke it was light sarcasm not meant to be mean at all.  (shit i know i got debt)  in hindsight yea cautionary tale indeed.
marvelmemes,35llmm,PortugalTheHam,2,Tue May 12 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"I figure that either Sue was adopted, is Johnny's step-sister, or their mother (who's not show in the trailer) is white.  Either way, I have zero problem with a black anyone in the F4, and zero problem with  them being interracial siblings.  I'm a lot more concerned about Doom getting turned into a teenage hacker.  To be fair, film was my minor, and I fell into it.  I had to take something for my electives so I took a couple of academic film courses, and I really fell in love with it.  I made all my electives film classes, and it didn't take much more to just make it a minor.  My major was more practical.  Still, don't major in film academics, kids.  Just say no."

marvelmemes,2vmzp2,CompiledSanity,7,Thu Feb 12 09:50:49 2015 UTC,That made me laugh way too much.
marvelmemes,2vmzp2,Sxty8,2,Fri Feb 13 00:23:30 2015 UTC,Avengers: Age of Ultron  Assembly NOT required.
marvelmemes,2vmzjw,CompiledSanity,7,Thu Feb 12 09:48:22 2015 UTC,At the end of every Marvel movie I see numerous people walking out as soon as the credits roll.   What the fuck are you doing?!?!
marvelmemes,2vmzjw,dogwoodfan777,5,Thu Feb 12 23:54:04 2015 UTC,"This got me in an argument with my gf actually. SHE insisted to go watch Guardians of the Galaxy together, to share my interests. Sighed the whole movie, wants to leave as soon as the credits start.  I insist to stay, insist, insist, tell her my friends said the after-credits scene was awesome and super important.  Then it happened.  She wasn't happy."
marvelmemes,2vmzjw,CristolGDM,1 point,Fri Feb 13 04:35:26 2015 UTC,You must have a heart made of coal if you didn't enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy.   I was a solid MEH when I heard it was coming out and it won me over the way Marvel only could.
marvelmemes,2vmzjw,teeelo,2,Sun Feb 15 06:04:15 2015 UTC,I just watch the after credits sequences at home on youtube afterwords.
marvelmemes,2vmzjw,LocalMadman,2,Sat Feb 14 18:58:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, but a better reminder is to not get a big ass drink before a Marvel movie--especially if AoU is going to be almost 3 hours long.  You'll be tacking on an extra 15 minutes of hell onto your bladder if you do."
marvelmemes,2vls5a,idkmybffljill,7,Thu Feb 12 01:46:30 2015 UTC,We are actually steadily growing every day!
marvelmemes,2vls5a,vhisic,2,Thu Feb 12 01:53:00 2015 UTC,"That's great, this is easily one of my top 10 subreddits, if you ever need help modding just let me know!"
marvelmemes,2vls5a,alwaysupvoteTRUNKS,3,Thu Feb 12 02:01:03 2015 UTC,withe meme's being banned from /r/marvel we should be ok here
marvelmemes,2vm1tf,PleaseNinja,2,Thu Feb 12 03:09:14 2015 UTC,"Asgardians are not gods! They're born, they live, they die, they optionally shave their chest hair, just as humans do."
marvelmemes,2vm1tf,jhsounds,2,Mon Mar 2 09:06:45 2015 UTC,You sure?
marvelmemes,2vm1tf,arpangupta,9,Mon Feb 16 10:02:04 2015 UTC,"The point was that Superman didn't have a shaved cheat, and your picture proved that to be true. Marvel has done it with Thor, Peter Quill, Tony Stark (I think) and (though not otherwise shaggy) Steve. Ruffalo and the Hulk were showing some chest hair though."
marvelmemes,2vm1tf,JustAMinuteAnHourAgo,3,Mon Feb 23 15:11:35 2015 UTC,Oh haha I thought that title was sarcasm. But ya you're right. MoS did show a more realistic hero...even for someone as comic-bookish as Superman.

marvelmemes,2vg2zi,Fourteen_of_Twelve,5,Tue Feb 10 19:09:05 2015 UTC,Holy shit I'm on the sidebar.
marvelmemes,2vg2zi,CompiledSanity,3,Wed Feb 11 19:08:14 2015 UTC,You've been our best Spidey submission so far! We're putting our best on-topic memes in the Sidebar now :)
marvelmemes,2vg2zi,hawksaber,3,Thu Feb 12 07:43:15 2015 UTC,:O  :D  Thank you!
marvelmemes,2vg2zi,Dray_Gunn,1 point,Thu Feb 12 07:50:22 2015 UTC,No worries! Keep up the cool memes :)
marvelmemes,2vg2zi,hawksaber,2,Thu Feb 12 09:14:53 2015 UTC,"Seriously, how can anyone like Tony Stark!? He's such an asshole!"
marvelmemes,2ve13r,vhisic,4,Tue Feb 10 05:36:26 2015 UTC,Pssssssst.  Sony still owns the rights to Spider Man.
marvelmemes,2ve13r,v3n0mat3,8,Tue Feb 10 06:16:26 2015 UTC,"Yes im aware, but at least he is no longer locked in that cupboard in the Sony basement, and can visit his buddies over at Marvel."
marvelmemes,2ve13r,dogwoodfan777,4,Tue Feb 10 06:19:30 2015 UTC,And collaboration is a beautiful goddamn thing.
marvelmemes,2v900e,EpicDeathKick,3,Mon Feb 9 01:02:23 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, the fanart references a post-Civil War oneshot called The Confession, where Tony gives a huge monologue over Cap's dead body. It's the only time I've ever cried reading a comic book.  To my knowledge, in the comics, no one ever finds out about this. If it happened in the movies, and then Cap came back and saw a video recording of Tony more or less crying over his dead body ... like, damn."
marvelmemes,2v900e,kingsguarding,4,Thu Feb 12 09:38:08 2015 UTC,"This into this. For whatever flaws civil war had, this was one of the most powerful comic moments I've ever read."

marvelmemes,2v900e,dogwoodfan777,3,Mon Feb 9 09:37:53 2015 UTC,Wanna fill me in?
marvelmemes,2v900e,GreenCable0001,5,Mon Feb 9 10:21:50 2015 UTC,Comic and possible future movie spoilers...  Cap is speculated to die in Captain America: Civil War. He is killed in the comics by Crossbones who is expected to be in the movie. The image is fan art depicting what it would be like to see the MCU version of Iron Man paying his respects to Cap.
marvelmemes,2v900e,GreenCable0001,3,Mon Feb 9 15:10:43 2015 UTC,"Ok, I thought I missed a big leak of some kind about Cap 3: Civil War. Thanks for the clarification that it's just fan art."
marvelmemes,2v900e,teeelo,1 point,Mon Feb 9 16:18:38 2015 UTC,"Honestly it could go either way, tony stark could be the one who bites the bullet.    Or both. Death of Superman style."
marvelmemes,2uq2ml,PleaseNinja,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:58:46 2015 UTC,try to play with it* ftfy
marvelmemes,2upjy1,PleaseNinja,6,Wed Feb 4 02:17:29 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, we've even had a lot of people subscribe recently! Submissions have been a little slow as of late, but hopefully the upcoming movies will make way for a lot of new Memes :)"
