kindle,3e4mlg,bubbafloyd,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:25:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so I've seen. Though I could swear the one time it got turned on it was on a side loaded book.   It's not perfect, to say the least, a lot of the time it neglected big, uncommon words and defined easy, common words, which was a pain. But for someone like me, reading books in English for the first time ever, it saves me the trouble of always having to long press words for definitions.   Thanks for replying :)"

Also, there's less physical strain when reading in bed, and with the backlight you don't have to turn the book at funny angles in order to get the light just in the right spot, so you end up reading more and enjoying it more."

kindle,3e1bwh,Morrwo,2,Tue Jul 21 11:33:51 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the same thing -- but sort of from the opposite direction, since I read ~120 books a year. But I travel a fair amount and it's nice not to have ration myself on a trip to a couple of paperbacks because of weight and space.  And it's a lot more pleasant being able to read lying on my back without worrying about dozing off and dropping Vol. 3 of Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire on my face."
kindle,3e1bwh,emkay99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:45:44 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely. I had wanted to read The Way of Kings for a while, but it's over 1000 pages. Talk about daunting. Opening it on the Kindle is just the same as opening any other book I've read on an eReader. I spend longer on the one book, of course, but the fears of staring at a huge stack of paper in my right hand are no longer an issue. The kindle just lets the pages flow thoughtlessly and easily."
kindle,3e1bwh,Spada05,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:40 2015 UTC,"Yea, I read maybe 5 books during my childhood and teen years. And now I'm on my 20 something book since I have my kindle.  1,5 year. I first started reading ebook on phone, but that was pretty bad.   One drawback is that I fall asleep with it in bed, and I'm afraid that I'm going to break it."
kindle,3e1bwh,Pascalwb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:31 2015 UTC,"Having a kindle has definitely helped me read more - it's much easier to bring a kindle on a commute than lug around a heavy book. Also, I really like seeing the estimated time left in the chapter, so I know if I can get one more chapter in before my stop.   My only quibble is that Amazon bought Goodreads ages ago and I still have to manually update my progress in books. I don't necessarily want Goodreads to automatically track every book I read, but if you have marked the book as ""currently reading"" through your kindle, there should be an option to automatically update the progress on Goodreads daily or weekly. Similarly, you should be able to decide if your highlights get posted to Goodreads."

kindle,3e1bwh,ScubaSteve1219,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:18 2015 UTC,I have always loved reading.  I do read more since I bought my first Kindle keyboard. Sometimes there will be a new book out that I want to read but don't want to pay $11.99 or more for and I get it from the library. The last time I did this it has been so long since I read a physical book that when I got to a word I wanted to read the definition of I touched it...and when nothing happened I felt massively stupid.   Also I find it much easier to cull my collection of physical books. Every 6-8 months I take another look and decide either I'll never read it again or I like it enough to buy the digital book.  The exception being some cookbooks or heavily illustrated books and out-of-print books.  This downsizing of my books has let me give away some bookcases and it feels good to not be the caretaker for so much stuff.
kindle,3e1bwh,ieateggs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:45:54 2015 UTC,"I hadn't read a book in 15 years.  Then I bought a Kindle Keyboard on a whim. I read 142 books in the first year.  I devoured everything anyone recommended.  Some stuff was excellent,  some not so much,  but I enjoyed every bit of it.  I've been upgrading my Kindle every time a new one is released now and I finish over over 100 books before I move on to the next device.  I love these things. They have been the single best investment I've ever made,  I believe."
kindle,3e1bwh,brandon7s,2,Tue Jul 21 23:27:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, been reading a lot more as well. A few small details that bug me though -- I'd like margins smaller than what the kindle allows.

Also I have somewhat trouble sleeping. This does not happen when I read on the Kindle.  Reading on a Kindle is a much more pleasant experience for eyes and mind in my opinion.

The light setting on my Paperwhite is 7% though, I never use any more than that. It can go up to 100%, but then the Kindle illuminates my entire neighborhood and rattles my brain.  Using a low light-setting on the Kindle works perfectly for me, and makes reading on an electronic device a pleasure. At least for me :)  Go buy one, join the club!"

As for ""best"", there's not just one best right now. If you buy your ebooks from Amazon, get a Kindle. There's little difference in the basic ""reading a book"" experience, because e-ink just is what it is.  But there are a couple of newer model Kindles with higher resolution, so that's a good place to look."

Didntrealise it wasa major publisher - so a chance theyll come down hard on it. But how hard is it to google the book you are copying?

kindle,3dzmhu,SolidCoal,8,Mon Jul 20 23:29:44 2015 UTC,"It's the article that's scammy. It makes out like the author got away with piracy/plagiarism and made a ton of money out of it for little work. However, near the end of the article, he notes that he only sold a total of 9 sales. The rest were free downloads. I'd say that it was the author that scammed himself out of a lot of time and effort for a paltry return.

I don't understand why in the pdf case there is modification to the page layout, and tabs are ruined. Sure your tab page ratio is different from the kindles, so you get extra margins/header footers depending on the ration. So for pdf usind k2pdfopt in ""trim"" conversion mode, will give pdf with no margins, thus using the max amount of screen fill.  Are you able to generate satisfying epub from the .docx files? Do you have a single page docx tab so we can test?"

I'd go one step further, and then email the book to your free.kindle.com address so that it becomes a part of your cloud library and whispersync works across your kindle and your phone, etc, if you use those."
kindle,3dw740,birf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:34:59 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't you be telling the OP this? I already use calibre and have no problems, DRM or otherwise.  Edit: P.S. I hadn't heard that sometimes the nook version has better formatting than the Kindle's; I had always assumed the publishers provided the same thing to all distributors.  Good to know."
kindle,3dw740,wildeye,2,Tue Jul 21 01:43:25 2015 UTC,"Y'know, I should have replied to the OP, I guess I was also 2nd-ing you.   And as for formatting, it varies rarely, it seems publishers usually use the same digital file as a base then convert to different formats for vendors -- and the base format is often epub, as Amazon's official offerings for conversion will accept epub input -- but sometimes they'll do something odd. Like this particular publisher, which occasionally tacks on extra stuff after the text around the time they put out the paperback or just a new print edition in stores. You know, discussion questions for reading groups, maybe an interview with the author, maybe a preview of the author's next book. All of which will be correctly formatted, while wrecking the footnotes/endnotes and blockquotes and so forth in the main text. I just lucked out this time that they had only done that to the kindle edition, leaving nook and kobo and as far as I could tell everyone else alone."
kindle,3dw740,birf,2,Tue Jul 21 02:02:22 2015 UTC,Calibre would be able to convert any of your eBooks to the MOBI format for kindle. You'd have to download them from your nook first though.

kindle,3duguw,found_your_car_dude,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:29:32 2015 UTC,When I first purchased my Paperwhite I had ordered the Amazon leather case alongside it because I was worried that It would get damaged. Having had my Kindle now for roughly 3 years i have got to say that I only use the case when I am traveling and am throwing it and out of a bag.  When I am reading at home I don't bother with the case and I haven't gotten any noticeable scratches on the device yet. The only thing noticeable would be fingerprints (bezel and back) and I have never came across any unwanted or annoying smudges or fingerprints on the touchscreen itself. I am forever wiping the bezel but never the screen.

So you can spare the usb cable, as long as whispersync is activated. You will copy them from there into your google notes.  I looked around, and it seems there isn't any API for google keep. This means, there is no way to automatize the process, even if someone decided to write a code for it.  On the other hand, it seems Evernote has an API, and I am guessing this is how the clippings.io chrome extension (1.5€/month) works to send your highlights into your Evernote. Maybe some real programmer can confirm."

How your notes and highlights get synched. Can you annotate with a pen? Can you use your ereader as a typing machine? When will the browser stop being experimental? When will there be MathMl implementation inside the kindle format, so we get nice math formulas? When can we get a nice latex package to generate nice epub and not resorting to sub optimal solution? For those working on textbooks when will there be bigger screens with 8', or 10', or A4, while keeping the dpi? People complain about text to speech, About reactivity of the machine.

And yes even with no adds, you still get static screen savers like book, typewriters, pencils, inkpots, but since the light is of then, it should no battery power. Or just hold the on/off button for longer to turn the screen to complete white."

kindle,3drfzh,kovalevskaya,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:23:34 2015 UTC,You didn't pay the extra $20 to get the non-ad version.
kindle,3drfzh,illegaljokes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:31:10 2015 UTC,Even if you disable the ads you are still going to see a screensaver.
kindle,3drfzh,bunkins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:35:45 2015 UTC,At this point I think the only way to turn off ads on the new paperwhite is to contact Amazon support. If it's one of the older paperwhites you can turn off ads in your Amazon account settings.  Even with the ads off an image will still be shown.

Be careful about pressure! I don't know if the kindle voyage's screen is more crack-resistant, but be cautious of putting heavy objects on it. If this happens to you though - Amazon will most likely send you a new one in return.   EDIT: I now use a ""hard"" case on my kindle - basically the cover is pretty stiff, instead of just a cloth cover. It still gets shoved into the bottom of bags (not on purpose...) and the screen's fine after a year."

Even China’s most elite academic intellectuals – working in the major universities of Beijing and Shanghai – cannot seem to resist such ‘spit fights.’ In the late 1990s this was characterized by an acrimonious debate between those who supported liberalism, more or less along the lines of neo-liberal policies associated with von Hayek, and those who borrowed postmodern critiques from the West to recast a left attack on capital. ==========   You can just copy-paste this into a Word file. If you want the highlights and notes to be structured some other way (such as the highlight, then book title, author, and highlight location in parentheses, which is how I like mine) let me know and I'll put up a webpage that converts them for you.   One thing to note: if you delete My Clippings.txt, saving notes/clippings no longer works. So don't delete the file when pulling notes out, cut the text and save it blank.   The way the Kindle saves its clippings is honestly the big feature that makes me prefer it to other readers I've used. It's so useful."

Firstly, you can only link one amazon account, and choose one country to use, so you'll be locked to the .com or co.uk version (you can change, but i dont believe library transfers automatically). However provided you have that set up right, youll still be able to use the kindle in other countries with the original account and access all books, buy more etc. Theres also the questionable legally (but morally fine IMO) calibre plus a drm removal tool (that i wont say as it may be against the rules , but should be easy to find). That will allow you to put on via usb from multiple amazon regions in principle, as well as other stores (kobo, sainsburys etc.) Hope this helps, and sorry for text wall (disclaimer:i dont own a kindle, but this is from what I have read.

kindle,3dd3il,Crocs_,4,Wed Jul 15 09:24:24 2015 UTC,"I would say so. I have had a kindle 4 and now I have a kindle paperwhite 2, and I have also played around with the basic kindle touch, the kobo mini, and the kobo aura HD.  The main difference between the basic kindle and the new paperwhite 3 is that with the paperwhite 3 you can adjust the lighting and the resolution is higher.  With an ereader, you can read it in direct sunlight with no glare or loss of visibility like a phone has. This goes for all ereaders and eink devices. Unlike a phone you can't read a basic kindle completely in the dark though, you need something like a lamp or some source of light (just like you would for a paper book). That's the benefit of the paperwhite, it has a light built in so that you can read it in complete darkness or very low light conditions.  I haven't used the paperwhite 3 but I have used the Kobo aura HD, and in my opinion having higher resolution doesn't help that much. It's nice but it's not necessary especially if you are trying to spend wisely . I do like the ability to make the text background whiter though. On the basic kindle it's more book paper colored.  Basically yes. I would suggest you get the basic kindle. If you find yourself loving it, you can always sell it later and upgrade. When I upgraded from a kindle 4 to a paperwhite 2 I felt like it was barely worth the money even though I use it all the time."

But reading some reviews, I don't know if it is worth it. They differ to much between people saying Don't buy the basic one and some actual readers saying it isn't worth it.  Today it is a $70 difference between the basic Kindle and the PW. Do you think that for someone who just love reading, will be worth the upgrade to the PW? I currently  don't have any Kindle, btw."

kindle,3dakns,Marinlik,2,Tue Jul 14 19:57:41 2015 UTC,The light is a game changer and the screen is like paper.
kindle,3dakns,frmorrison,2,Wed Jul 15 00:57:07 2015 UTC,"That sounds really temping. I've always liked my kindle, but now I'm starting to think that it kind of looks black and gray instead of black and white in most lightning(or lack of. Not darkness, but shadowy places). Is the increased resolution noticeable?"
kindle,3dakns,frmorrison,2,Wed Jul 15 08:56:25 2015 UTC,It is for me.
kindle,3dakns,minderaser,2,Wed Jul 15 22:18:33 2015 UTC,"I did right when the Paperwhite 2 was released. Even from the Kindle 5 to the Paperwhite 2, the Paperwhite 2's screen was very noticeably higher resolution. It'll only be better if you get the new Paperwhite 3.  The light is really handy to have. You can read in the dark of course, good for when you have someone else in the room, or when you can't quite fall asleep but a lamp or other light would be much too bright.  The light also allows for better contrast. If you crank the light up in a bright room, you won't so much notice that it looks like it has a light on, you'll mostly notice the background just appears whiter, providing better contrast (and thus the name Paperwhite).  The touchscreen is, in my opinion, much easier to navigate with in general. The software is better designed, and touch is just natural for this sort of thing (highlighting, typing, quickly navigating menus).  Downside: well no more physical buttons. I kept my Kindle 5 around and I gotta admit sometimes I pull it out just so I can press those damn satisfying buttons.  Downside: touchscreen is always on. I mean, in general the touch screen is pretty smart -- if you start wiping around a lot (e.g. cleaning up a smudge) usually the page won't turn. But I've accidentally nudged my knuckle on the screen and it turned the page, for instance.  Downside: Paperwhite 2 is heavier than the Kindle 5. Not sure about the weight of the Paperwhite 3 (2015 model) or how it compares to the Kindle 5.  Downside: if you do use the light a lot (e.g. for providing contrast in well lit rooms) the battery life is shorter. It's really not too much of a problem. I can still usually go almost 2 weeks of decent reading without charging, or one week of very heavy reading."
kindle,3dae9t,Rising_Star1et,2,Tue Jul 14 19:14:14 2015 UTC,"The Fire HD is going to be your best bet there. Paperwhite and Voyage are really only for reading things (and even then only in black and white). The Fire is the most like a normal tablet out of the three instead of a dedicated reader. The screens (and probably processors) of the other two are too slow for video.  And yeah, the Fire HD should do everything you mentioned just fine as long as the 7 inch screen is enough for you."
kindle,3dae9t,7121958041201,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:31:33 2015 UTC,"I have a paperwhite, a 7 inch tablet and a 10"" tablet, the paperwhite is fantastic for reading books and I wouldn't trade it for anything, I really don't think most people need a voyage but if you have extra money you want to blow, go for it.  The 10"" is great for magazines, vides, comic books, etc.  The 7 inch is portable and works fine as a catchall that can do everything just not as well as the other two.  I'd suggest looking at 10"" tablets instead of any of the ones you've listed, for your needs it seems like a better fit."
kindle,3daka6,SolidCoal,5,Tue Jul 14 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"The difference between 167 and 300 PPI is huge in my opinion, if anything review videos and screenshots don't do it justice.  It's very easy to load 3rd party books, just use calibre to convert the books to MOBI or AZW3, and then hit send to device. I've never heard of this problem, for the Voyage you can set how sensitive the page turn buttons are. I have it set so a very faint touch will turn the page. Amazon has confirmed that other kindles will get the update, but no one knows when. There are always rumors around this time about new devices, since they usually come out in the fall. The problem is, kindles aren't like apple devices where there's always an update every year. There very well could be a Voyage 2 coming out this fall, but no one except Amazon knows for sure. No one knows if it's worth waiting for, but honestly it'd be hard to top the current Voyage. 300 PPI is already very very clear, I would be very curious how much of a difference it would make if it went to 400 or even 500. After all, it's just text, after a certain point you won't be making a difference by just increasing the resolution."

As Solarin88 stated the big difference for you will be the resolution.  Some other things that are really nice are the adaptive frontlight, and the page press buttons.  The frontlight is great because it always looks near perfect.  The page press buttons are nice so you don't have to lift a finger to turn the page.    I use a nifty little tool called the Kindle Comic Converter http://kcc.iosphe.re to convert my manga, that look beautiful on the 300 dpi screen.    I hear whispers about the update coming in August to the Paperwhite 2 and Voyage that will bring the new Font engine and Bookerly."

kindle,3d8aiu,sonsue,2,Tue Jul 14 11:53:18 2015 UTC,"I think you mean ""practical."" And the point stands--they have done it with phones. Not to mention the Kobo Aura H2O, which likely has even smaller margins than the Kindle Voyage."
kindle,3d8aiu,kenspencerbrown,-3,Tue Jul 14 20:28:48 2015 UTC,"Genuinely curious, why would you put practical in quotes? I definitely meant plausible or any of its synonyms including reasonable, believable, likely, feasible, tenable, possible, conceivable, or imaginable. Due to the incredibly slim profit margins Kindle has had on its hardware in the past I can't imagine waterproofing it to be plausible. I really don't know what Voyage's margins are but I was basing my statement on earlier hardware that Amazon essentially sold for break even or at a loss.    Edit: Just realized you used ""And the point stands-"" and that is f-ing funny."
kindle,3d8aiu,sonsue,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:42:09 2015 UTC,"""Plausible"" conveys the idea of being believable or credible. ""Practical"" gets to the idea I think you were trying to express--does a waterproof Kindle make economic sense to produce? Either way, the existence of the Aura H2O--at a lower price, no less--proves the point. Waterproofing  is not only plausible (it is, in fact, being done) but practical, too (Kobo is producing them in mass at a lower price point).   I put the words in quotes because we're talking about the words themselves--the quotes make it clear when the words are the subject/object of the sentence rather than an functional part of it. Example: Using the word ""practical"" is a very practical way to discuss economics. (This is a standard practice in writing, though some people use italics for the same purpose.)  Glad you found ""the point stands"" so hilarious. Not sure why, but enjoy."
kindle,3d8aiu,kenspencerbrown,-2,Wed Jul 15 21:06:28 2015 UTC,"The word plausible means exactly what I told you it means. I literally gave you a list of synonyms directly out of the dictionary in case you had some sort of confusion regarding its use. No shit, an actual list of synonyms. I have no idea why you are attempting to argue this. The existence of an Aura H20 has no bearing whatsoever on the price of production of Amazon hardware. Also for the record it's water resistant not water proof. Do I need to put ""resistant"" in quotes for you to grasp it? I understand it's summer and you have nothing to do until school starts but I was honestly trying to give someone my opinion on why waterproofing was not plausible for Amazon as a company at this time."

kindle,3d5pp3,puff_tentacle,3,Mon Jul 13 19:03:25 2015 UTC,What if your friend would just copy the file?
kindle,3d5pp3,Cinublabla,6,Mon Jul 13 19:40:50 2015 UTC,"That would be good if the friend had downloaded in the correct format, but if, say, the friend couldn't find one in mobi or azw and had to download it in epub, Calibre would be the way to go.  Or so I'm led to understand."
kindle,3d5pp3,mathen,3,Mon Jul 13 22:27:35 2015 UTC,I think this sub generally discourages discussion of behavior that might be illegal.   There are multiple ways to get content that was acquired outside of amazon onto a Kindle though.

kindle,3d5pp3,DraftZebra,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:55:22 2015 UTC,This. Calibre is great for converting Word documents to AZW3 format too. I've converted some of my work manuals and put 'em on the Kindle. This will work even on an older Kindle Keyboard I've got.

kindle,3d0pyn,ScubaSteve1219,6,Sun Jul 12 15:47:14 2015 UTC,"I upgraded from the Paperwhite to the Voyage two months ago. The hardest part of the transition was getting used to the new placement of the power button. Otherwise, the Voyage has been superior in every way…and I loved my Paperwhite. I have it with me whenever I leave the house.  The Voyage is lighter, has a bigger screen but overall smaller physical dimensions, and the battery seems to last significantly longer (though that is anecdotal).  The page turn is also faster. That is something I didn't think would matter, but does improve the overall experience. Lastly, I have really liked the page turning buttons on the sides. It lets me hold the Kindle in either hand and turn the pages without stretching my finger for one of the directions.  If you have any specific questions, I'm happy to give you my opinion."
kindle,3d0pyn,readoutside,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:38:55 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't check the screen measurements. Maybe it seems bigger because the overall dimensions are smaller. If so, I apologize for the misinformation."

kindle,3d0pyn,Krazy-8,4,Mon Jul 13 09:03:01 2015 UTC,"Voyage for the bling bling. But seriously, the Voyage because it's just narrow enough to hold with one hand (I have smallish-medium hands), and physical page turn buttons are the shit."
kindle,3d0pyn,jethoman,3,Mon Jul 13 12:46:16 2015 UTC,"I will pile on the consensus that if you can buy a Voyage, you should.  I just got one and I love it.  You can usually find them for a bit less than retail on eBay.  Just beware about claims that sellers make about whether or not they have one that has special offers or not.  I found that the features I like the most on the Voyage is the sharp screen with a front light that is always just about perfect, the fact that the front is absolutely flat, and the page turn buttons."
kindle,3d0pyn,starista,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:52:26 2015 UTC,Just curious what issue did you have with your Nook GlowLight?  I am ready to make the switch to a Kindle as well but my Nook has held up pretty well.
kindle,3d0pyn,starista,3,Sun Jul 12 17:55:43 2015 UTC,First off it just felt cheaper. The Kindle is a solid piece. I didn't like the rubber along the edge of the Nook. I kept playing with it and found it distracting when reading.  Also the lighting. The Kindle was more even. On the Nook it was clear where the lights were and the screen was brighter in some areas than others.  I also prefer Amazon to Barnes and Noble for getting books. I believe Amazon has a larger selection and typically they're cheaper. Also I like the Kindle extras as well. The x-ray thing they have and extra search features I really enjoyed and found myself missing on the Nook.  Overall the Nook just felt like a downgrade to me and made me miss my Kindle even more.

kindle,3cw7u5,mlk,4,Sat Jul 11 17:52:52 2015 UTC,"which means it will have to pre-process the entire book, setting and numbering bookmarks at each computed pagebreak, then enabling you to navigate along these bookmarks. You are probably thinking like in a normal word document.  The problem here, is the hardware is brought to strict minimum, and we want the computing done by the ereader to be minimal. Intuitively it seems a waste of batteries, That is why they did this by paragraphs or locations, which is independent of the font type and size and size of display,  Edit: also, since OP was inquiring about kindle app. Imagine a book that is normally 500pages in paper. And you ask that app to generate 2k pages for your kindle tablet, at the loading of the book. It is possible, but will look meh.  Edit2: considering how fast the Calibre thing generate the page numbering, I think it might be realisitic for better tablets, if you want the page options. But I still think the location should be used more often, since it is universal when you quote. I can tell you to go to location 1432, but if we each have different display settings, the page 110 line 5 doesn't mean much."
kindle,3cw7u5,zenxbear,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:12:21 2015 UTC,"That defeats the point of page numbers then, which are used as static reference points within a body of text. At that point you may as well use location numbers, which Amazon does."

I know I can multiply miles 1.6 times to get Km, but Km are more common to me. Sure you can get used to it, I would still prefer page numbers. It's not about static references, it's about how many times I have to turn to page to finish the chapter/book. You can come up with all the technical reason you like, but I still prefer pages."

kindle,3cwql8,RuinEleint,2,Sat Jul 11 13:03:38 2015 UTC,"tl;dr: yes, but don't worry about it.  If the kindle wants access to files, it'll get access to files (if you install it).  This is so it can access the files (books) you want to read.  Depending on which version of android you have it may or may not actually need/use this permission.  On some phones it will have access to any of your files.   Are you worried it'll delete/change/upload them to amazon without your permission?  The way I see it, if Amazon were to do this, someone would notice it and it would be major news and amazon would possibly get sued and certainly it would make them look very bad.  Personally I don't think they'd do it because it wouldn't make them any money.  But bottom line is, it's theoretically possible that this could happen and if this upsets you, don't install it.   Future versions of Android will allow you to block permissions but still install the app. And i'm sure on a rooted phone/with certain roms, you're already able to do this sort of thing.  Although it might mean the app won't even be able to read amazon books."

kindle,3crw04,Fr0glips,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:05:22 2015 UTC,They're just using new displays as and when they're available. Get used to it; it's not going to stop.   Some people whine about the refreshes; perhaps you usually read mobi files but if you read PDFs or docs with images you get a refresh every page and I can see how that might annoy some people.  Even if they released a model with animations (which amazon have expressed no interest in so i'm not sure what you're worried about) you'd not have to use it; it's hard to see them forcing you to have animated page turns or whatever.

Frankly, page turn speed is optimum and there wouldn't be any point in speeding it up. It takes a split second to move your eye from the foot of one page to the head of another and the page turns in that time.  Little software additions are always nice but with the current ability to bookmark, note take, sync, highlight, define etc., I'm not frustrated by the lack of anything."

If you download your books through Amazon, all your notes and reading progress are backed up to Amazon server. The personal contents that you sideloaded (copied to your Kindle) are excluded from this feature.  And I don't believe that sideloaded content's annotations and reading progress can be backed up, as the .MBS files have device code appended after them, so even if you copy the .MBS files to another device, chances are, it won't work.

The front of the Voyage is protected by a single sheet of etched glass, so dust and debris can't work their way into the edges of the screen, and fingerprints don't show up.

The first article was about geometries, which I assume are Mathematics related since I don't have access related to the article. The Kindle has always been shit for displaying diagrams or pictures, so I wouldn't recommend reading anything that has pictures in them anyway. Besides, math is a bit of an extreme case. Usually when someone mention reading, they meant language subjects instead is science subjects with lots of diagrams.   The second article was about gestures. The abstract did not mention what kind of gesture the study involved, so I can't tell whether they meant actually tracing the words or just spinning a pen around. Personally I found that spinning a pen helps me to think, but that has nothing to do with touching the words.   I can't find an abstract for the third article, so no comment."
kindle,3ch7bq,illegaljokes,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:01:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your thoughtful response. Lots of people touch the words in a book, including myself. Try reading Nabokov:) I was actually just part of a research project at a 2 year technical college in the US and the majority of students we surveyed used this method. Children and adults with low literacy skills would obviously do it more, so it got me thinking about how this design change on ereaders would affect those folks. The thought here is that when learners point to (touch) a thing they're trying to remember (like a word or part of a diagram) on a page, that this actually helps their recall.  It's true there's lots of awesome tools available on kindles that aren't available on paper books, but we need to make sure that technology helps more than hinders for all levels of ability."
kindle,3ch7bq,FireOpalCO,5,Wed Jul 8 01:49:58 2015 UTC,"Only one problem with the assertion.  It skips a major feature of the Kindle: the fact that when you touch a word it shows you a short version of the definition, offers to take you to a full dictionary entry, and adds the words to your flash cards so you can practice your new vocabulary words later.  That is something that physical books can never deliver short of reading in a library with a dictionary and a pile of blank index cards in front of you.    They also have a specific feature for children and people who are reading in English as a second language called Word Wise.     I'm not sure how we are being trained to not touch our books considering the lookup, highlight/clip, and footnote functions all depend on touching our books."
kindle,3ch7bq,epsenohyeah,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:54:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. I'm not actually talking about touching and covering the word with your finger to define it though, but resting or panning your finger below a word or line of text on the screen to bring more attention to it.  You're absolutely right. The tools available to us on eReaders are way more useful than from a paper book. Highlighting, defining, and clipping are great features, and I honestly use them all the time. Word wise looks awesome too, though my thought is that when I try to read books in other languages, like German or French, I don't want the definition to immediately appear. I'm sure the same is for those learning to read whether it's children or folks with lower literacy skills. By touching the book and moving our fingers below the words as we read them, we can say in our heads 'I know that. It means X', without the device telling us.   My understanding and experience is that anything we touch on these newer generation devices will prompt a definition to pop, a highlight to start or a menu to pop up. We just can't touch the pages without something happening on screen, which may be distracting and take us out of the reading experience.  Part of learning to read and learning new vocabulary and concepts is to make those connections in our own mind, without the crutch of the device telling us the answer to everything, right? That's how we become literate and my post was questioning how changes in the hardware and software of these devices might be altering that."

kindle,3cg4dj,Grei-man,2,Thu Jul 9 05:40:20 2015 UTC,Did you try amazon.de? It is closer to where you are so it might just work.
kindle,3cg4dj,Bill_565,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:59:30 2015 UTC,They require a German address as well. I might try a mail forwarder service to see if that works. I did manage to find a local store that lists the new paperwhite but they are out of stock so I will have to call them to see when they get new ones.
kindle,3cg4dj,Bill_565,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:50:52 2015 UTC,Oh pressed check out. It adds $20 shipping and an estimated $40 import fees. I'm fairly sure that the are low balling the import fees/not counting in VAT that would also be applied. Compare that to co.uk where I can get the same Kindle and a cover and probably still save money. If only they would let me order.
kindle,3cg4dj,Bill_565,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"Unless you got it for less than 125€, you should have bought it from ebay. UK ebay seller means no import fees and only a modest shipping cost. Amazon is amazing but only if you live in the US. The UK store is overpriced and the rest of the world is pretty much neglected.  Anyway, I'm really interested in exactly how much your kindle cost you and how much you'll end up paying in import fees. Shoot me a PM or reply here when you get it if it isn't too much trouble!"
kindle,3cfkym,anirugu1,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:05:56 2015 UTC,"Well, we don't even know if you're using wifi or 3g, if you have any problems with your network, router etc, so i'm not sure what help we can offer.  Have you done basic diagnostic checks with other devices to confirm that the problem is actually with the kindle?"

kindle,3cfkym,kevin0125,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:56:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything wrong with it, my Kindle is the same way: it's just slow to read/write files. 137 KB/s isn't bad considering that most books are 0.5 - 1 MB and you're rarely copying multiple books onto it. I don't think there's anything you can do."
kindle,3cf0we,theadimar21,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:05:52 2015 UTC,"Get Paperwhite, it is so much better than the Kindle 7.  Kindle 5 is not sold anymore since the 7 came out last year."
kindle,3cf0we,frmorrison,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:20:30 2015 UTC,"The Kindle 5 is no longer available. All of them are touch-based now. If money isn't an issue and you're set on having buttons to turn the page, you can get a Voyage -- it doesn't quite have normal buttons, but you get the PagePress sensors on the bezel."
kindle,3cche4,lithiumcow,5,Mon Jul 6 20:58:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's a toss-up.   On one hand, you have the prime sale day on July 15th. Most likely you'll see a sale on kindles. I wouldn't be surprised to see a sale on the voyage, as there hasn't been one yet since its release, and they probably want to clear some inventory for the new model coming. On the other hand, it's pretty much expected there will be a new refresh of the models in September. This will lead to lower prices on the current voyage, as the newer and shinier one will be available to order.   Personally I'd suggest just waiting until September. I'm one of those people that would hate to buy something only to regret not waiting 2 months later. However if you really want the device now, I'd suggest checking out the sale in a week to see if the price drops."
kindle,3cche4,AudibleKnight,2,Mon Jul 6 21:34:06 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, it's pretty much expected there will be a new refresh of the models in September.   Is it? The Voyage was released last year instead of a new Paperwhite model. Maybe they are going to update the Voyage and Paperwhite alternating every two years."
kindle,3cche4,kernco,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:37:04 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but unlikely. If you look at the kindle releases for the past few years, you'll see they clearly have a release schedule for each fall. This is most likely to be ramped up and available for the holiday season.  Amazon Kindle models (E Ink devices) Release dates - From Wikipedia   Kindle 4 (silver) September 28, 2011 Kindle Touch (silver) Wi-Fi and 3G: September 28, 2011 Kindle 5 (black) September 6, 2012 Kindle Paperwhite (1st gen) (black) Wi-Fi and 3G: October 1, 2012 Kindle Paperwhite (2nd gen) (black) Wi-Fi: September 30, 2013 3G: November 5, 2013 Kindle 7 (black) October 2, 2014 Kindle Voyage (black) Wi-Fi and 3G: October 21, 2014 Kindle Paperwhite (3rd gen) (black) Wi-Fi and 3G: June 30, 2015   Just last year, they increased the storage of the PW2 just a bit before the release of the voyage. With the new improved screen of the PW3, imho, they need to do something to improve the voyage to help justify the price difference. It seems like a misstep to leave the voyage as is, especially for the coming holiday season, without something shiny, new and fancy to promote."
kindle,3cche4,AudibleKnight,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"I do wonder how the price will be affected for me though. A Voyage right now is $300 here in Sweden, and about half the price if I buy it through my company (working as an interaction designer I obviously need to create adaptive designs for e-ink readers). I've also never been ordering things from Amazon and I suspect there will be some added fees on the order.  I'm thinking that maybe it's a better idea to buy the new Paperwhite instead (approx $170 here in Sweden) and then upgrade to the new September release if I feel the need to. Either way, I'm kind of leaning towards wanting one now as reading books on my iPad is far from optimal considering the seasons. I also want to get into reading more."
kindle,3cche4,AudibleKnight,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:56:19 2015 UTC,"Oh, I was advising as a US consumer. There seems to be quite a lag between releases of kindles for US and other parts of the world, so the wait could potentially be longer. I'm also unsure if the sale on the 15th is US only or not. If it isn't I don't see any reason why waiting a week would hurt, and your plan of grabbing a paperwhite 3 makes sense for your circumstances. My kindle crapped out a bit ago, so I've been reading on my phone. It's certainly not ideal, and I can understand the desire to just grab an e-ink device."
kindle,3cche4,Tbrooks,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"Ah, you have a point there. Even if they maybe do release a new Voyage this september there's a chance I won't get my hands on it for another few months anyway. I'm able to place an order on the Paperwhite 3 right now, but they don't have it in stock so they most likely order it directly from Amazon which makes the delivery time questionable. I guess I'll have to check with them to find out more."
kindle,3cche4,AudibleKnight,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:37:50 2015 UTC,Does amazon have any sort of a price guarantee?
kindle,3cche4,minderaser,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not sure. I've read posts of people who got returns/refunds after contacting support. However the timing of the guarantee is uncertain, as well as if it would happen 100% of the time. I haven't seen anything official beyond ""Amazon's great customer support"", so it'd be like rolling the dice unless you can find something on their site claiming for certain."
kindle,3cche4,rasafrasit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"Amazon does usually refresh their Kindle lines around that time which is why many people say to wait to see waht the latest and greatest is (just look up the release dates for the Kindle models). The Voyage looks fantastic and I'm sure you can find many reviews on it online. For me, it wasn't just quite enough of an upgrade from my Paperwhite 2. Whether or not a potential upgrade is worth waiting the months is up to you.  If you have Amazon Prime, Amazon is going to be having a rather large sale on the 15th. You could wait a week and see if they have a sale then as well."
kindle,3cche4,carterirons,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:10:30 2015 UTC,"They will credit you any difference if you buy now and the price drops within 30 days.  I know, I checked with customer support."

kindle,3cbzar,gzoztra,12,Mon Jul 6 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"Differences:   Paperwhite is made out of plastic with a rubber back, while Voyage is made out of magnesium. Paperwhite's power button is on the bottom while the Voyage's is on the back. Paperwhite is heavier than the Voyage, with the latter being 25 g lighter. It is also thinner, with the Voyage being 0.06 inches thinner. Paperwhite has a indented/pressed-into/depressed plastic screen while the Voyage screen is a glass screen, flush with the bezel. Voyage has PagePress buttons in addition to the touchscreen to turn pages, while Paperwhite only has a touchscreen to turn pages. Voyage has a automatic brightness sensor, while the Paperwhite does not. The price, of course! The Paperwhite starts at $119 With Special Offers, while the Voyage starts at $199 With Special Offers.   Otherwise, the resolution, software, processor, RAM, advertised battery life, and amount of storage are identical.   Some user-noted differences:   The Voyage seemingly has better contrast than the Paperwhite 3. And also, some people say that the Paperwhite 2 (the previous model) has better contrast than the Paperwhite 3. The Voyage has a whiter screen and whiter backlight, and it is also consistent. The Paperwhite 3's backlight and e-ink screen can differ with each one you buy. Some may be more yellow than others, some may be more grey and white than others.   As for your second question, I don't think so. I mean, it was released very recently, why would Amazon discount a new product? Maybe the $79 dollar Kindle, but I'm not getting my hopes up for a discount for the Paperwhite and Voyage."
kindle,3cbzar,Alumineous,2,Mon Jul 6 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"Wow thank you for the thorough reply!   I just bought the pw3 which will be my first kindle , I think the voyage is a little too much. I'll give the pw3 a shot and see if there's any need to upgrade   Do you know if the pw3 being plastic scratches easily?"
kindle,3cbzar,Ominus666,6,Mon Jul 6 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"I can't speak of the pw3, but I've had my pw2 for over a year and a half now, and the screen is pristine after hundreds of hours of read-time.

kindle,3cbzar,Alumineous,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:17:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know, since it is being shipped to me haha. If you are concerned with scratches, I would recommend using a case and just being diligent with the screen."

Bookerly is not exclusive to the Paperwhite 3, it will be coming to the above devices sometime in the near future."
kindle,3cbzar,Alumineous,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:29:59 2015 UTC,The PW3 came with the new text layout when it shipped. I was just using my new PW and I can confirm it has bookerly font already.

Also they could have used a thinner/lighter case as it does add to the weight unfortunately and I would have preferred the case to open sideways than top/bottom.

kindle,3c6d3e,newbie04,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:50:34 2015 UTC,"Dunno about the mac, but kindles (unless you're using pdf files) flow the text to fit the page, and how much you can fit on the page depends on the font, spacing,margins etc.  That's why page numbers make no sense at all.   And there's no reason that going back one page will take you to exactly the same place you came from. I mean, it's possible in theory but I think it's probably quicker/easier for the software to ""go back until there's a screen worth of data that ends with this line that's currently at the start of the line"" rather than remembering where the last page started and going there, because you could potentially go back every page, one at a time.  I don't see a solution to your problem other than using horrific pdfs, or bookmarking everything."

It used to be more common, and the indent would often start near the middle. You could also go to the Calibre forums and ask there, since it's an issue with Calibre's conversion into mobi and not with the Kindle itself. I think there's a way to still edit out the indent, but I think it would have to be done with a different ebook software, and unfortunately, I know nothing about that."
kindle,3c5xfi,minipulator,2,Sun Jul 5 04:37:28 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your mobi file was generated from an ePub, which are just zip files of CSS and HTML and sometimes images.

kindle,3c1gnb,MallocNofree,6,Fri Jul 3 21:58:42 2015 UTC,"nay. It was a failure for every single time. I bought ebooks but couldn't read them.   kindle isn't color, so rip graphs with multiple lines the size of the page seems unimportant at first, because as for regular text (and provided the ebook isn't a simple scan designed for kindle fire) you can change the page layout. BUT: you still need to display several equations on a single screen to make the chain of though readable without having to turn pages back and forth to read a pack. So the screen is too small. Definitly, a 10"" display (1/2 A4 paper) is the minimum required. This also applies to articles of journals, that you usually get in pdf. Reading them in landscape isn't satisfactory. Furthermore, you need the 300dpi with the 10"" so that the kindle becomes real alternative to printing article on inkjet as a booklet. the rendering equations depends on the book. Some books seems fine. Others, may have too large equations. And it can simply turn into a disaster. For example, in Peter Marti's ""Theory of Structures"", formulas were as images. There is no way you can make them bigger. I had to go download that book on the kindlefor pc app, to read that damn formula, because subscripts where unreadable! 80€ for this single ebook down the trash. when you read a textbook, you have to switch between several pages, back and forth to check your understanding. The kindle will be frustrating. And imagine, the hassle if you have to switch between 2 textbooks. it is possible to rearrange the pdf to be kindle friendly with the free k2pdfopt app. But the result, is not systematically readable, since you get page headings and footings, and getting rid of them with the crop may not work. Probably a real pdf editor can solve that.   It is useful though, to keep textbook in reach, for quick recall."

But when I tried with a physics textbook where it was much more figures and graphs it wasn't really optimal and my experience was not good at all (figures were difficult to interpret etc.). It also becomes really tedious when you are working with a book where you have to flip back and forth since the paperwhite isn't that fast compared to a physical copy of the book.

No underlined hyperlinks and it only works on-demand, by tap-to-view, just as I wanted.  So it looks like this ""bug"" depends on the book edition, and not on the kindle itself. The bad thing is: I downloaded samples of another 2 editions of Game of Thrones available on Amazon, and in both of them X-Ray is disabled in sample version. That said, you can't know in advance if the edition you are planning to buy will work properly.   Thanks a lot for the help, that's the first useful clue I received in the last couple of days! :)"

kindle,3byo53,forkdb,5,Fri Jul 3 06:03:17 2015 UTC,"1. I want improve my reading speed and vocabulary and understand topics in general reading by good amount of books (for this will Kindle be of any help)  You can gauge the reading speed. As Kindle has a feature which will show how much time left in each chapter. If you want to try speed reading on Kindle, you can check the details here  You can improvise your vocabulary also. As Kindle has a unique feature called Word Wise . And you can download a dictionary on your Kindle which would be helpful too.  2. Also i would like to continue to read pdf books(cs/electronics books) would i be able to do so in Kindle  Yes. Kindle supports PDF format. IMHO reading PDF on Kindle wont be a great idea. As the justification and alignments would be a mess compared to native mobi format.   3.General question about Kindle :- Does it support PDF format (in the website they mention that they do!) am aware of Calibre s/w which can be used to convert pdf to other more kindle friendly formats.  Yes. Kindle supports PDF format. Calibre is the best tool to convert PDF to Mobi  4.If the pdf contains a lot of text does Kindle excel in rendering the content well? OR if pdf contains more diagrams will it fail to render (wrt user experience)  Refer the answer to question# 2  5.I have a lot of epub/pdf books already stored in my External HDD, is it possible to transfer files from External HDD to Kindle using usb?  Yes. You can either purchase books from online stores or transfer it via USB; just like copying files to an external HDD  Apart from these, if you purchase books from Amazon, there is a unique feature called X-Ray it will show the details of characters / places / topic of interest.  eg: So, if I get confused or forgot who is ‘Lord Voldemort’ from the novel ‘Harry Potter’ I might have to go back flipping pages to track information about this character or where it was mention. This is not the case with Kindle X-Ray feature, all you do is tap of the character, place or topic of interest which pop up a mini window that have option for dictionary, X-Ray and Wikipedia.  I hope my answer was of use."

kindle,3byo53,kevin0125,4,Fri Jul 3 09:13:26 2015 UTC,"Here is my $0.02:  Does Kindle makes you read more?  Maybe. It's really depends on who you are and your determination. Some of my friends buy the Kindle, use it for like 2 weeks, and resell it because they simply don't want to read/ don't find reading entertaining enough.  I love my Kindle - I owned a tablet and while it's convenient to use, it's too much of an distraction - Facebook notifications, emails and everything. Kindle makes myself read more, as, I've read like 30 books since last year's summer.   That being said, Kindle is NOT a general purpose device. It's extremely suitable for those who read a lot of EPUB/MOBI files (I don't want to say Fiction/Non-Fiction here, because some non-fictions are available in MOBI format). The reason is that EPUB/MOBI allow the text to flow and adapt to changes in font size/margin/etc. It's NOT that suitable for PDF, as the screen is very small, slow refresh rate, and difficulty to zoom. PDF are also non-reflowable (the text doesn't change if you change font size or anything), which makes reading even slower.  I suggest using tablet if you read primarily PDF.  Calibre as a PDF converter  Short answer: It's one of the best converter, but far from perfect. In fact, there is NO perfect PDF converter AFAIK. Calibre still does excellent work on converting MOBI/EPUB/AZW3 to similar formats.  Does Kindle improve your reading speed, vocab, and topics?  Reading speed: probably no. Use Spreeder to train your reading speed.   Vocabulary: Kindle have built-in dictionary and Word Wise, as well as Flash Card so you can train your vocabulary  General understanding of topics: Yes. Kindle has built-in Wikipedia so you can highlight the text and read the Wiki entry. Also, Kindle have X-Ray so you can better understand what is going on in the book.  Using external HDD  You CAN store files in external HDD, but you CAN'T plug the HDD directly to your Kindle. You must use a PC to transfer files from HDD to your Kindle"

kindle,3byo53,zagbag,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:51:42 2015 UTC,"It's NOT that suitable for PDF, as the screen is very small, slow refresh rate,  and difficulty to zoom.   I'm not sure what you mean about the refresh rate.  On the PW2 at least there's no noticeable difference between pdf and mobi.  I've been using k2pfdopt to convert pdfs into pdfs which are more easily read. It makes the files a fair bit bigger as it turns them into pdfs consisting of images, but you are fixing them at the desired size/orientation so that they're perfectly readable in portrait mode.  Recommended, especially for pdfs which are low in images."
kindle,3byo53,twowheels,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:00:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I wasn't very clear.  I'm looking at the matter in OP's stand point. What I mean was:   The PDF files are generally larger than MOBI, therefore slower to load and turn pages. This should true for files larger than 100 Mb, which I think applies to OP because he/she generally read technical books that have a lot of diagrams. Also, for pages that have many diagrams Kindle often has to full refresh, so it's very annoying. I assumed that OP will be zooming a lot when reading books with diagrams. I have some biology textbooks in my Kindle, and while it's not that hard to read the text, it's extremely uncomfortable when you have to scrutinize the diagrams: you'd have to zoom in, wait for screen to refresh, drag to another point, wait for screen to refresh, and zoom out, wait for screen to refresh. It's much slower and more frustrating than using tablets, which everything is instantaneous."

kindle,3by9il,hughk,3,Fri Jul 3 09:20:09 2015 UTC,"Wait but your question says you have the previous gen Paperwhite.   If you're wanting to upgrade from the Keyboard to the PW, then I say go for it. I did the same. The backlight makes a world of difference."

kindle,3by9il,mulderc,8,Fri Jul 3 19:59:24 2015 UTC,I had the paperwhite 1 and was looking to upgrade to a better screen and had been thinking about the voyage for some time. The PW3 has a MUCH sharper screen although it isn't that noticeable while reading. Also the device is much faster and more responsive than my paperwhite 1 was. The only issue I am having is the contrast appears to be worse. I have read some reviews on amazon about this and there are more than a few other people also complaining about it. It appears that the new font is lighter and the screen ends up having less contrast.   I really want to compare it to the PW2 and Voyage directly with my own eyes to see just how different it is but right now I am seriously considering sending it back. The change in contrast just makes it less readable to me. I am going to give it a few more days and see if I adjust because other than that I really like the device.
kindle,3by9il,mulderc,2,Fri Jul 3 08:40:29 2015 UTC,"Does changing the font to a bolder one improve the situation? Good to know, I was actually considering buying the new pw (I have pw 1)"
kindle,3by9il,Satanmymaster,2,Fri Jul 3 15:39:16 2015 UTC,It does a bit also making the font size bigger helps.
kindle,3by9il,mulderc,2,Fri Jul 3 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"Ok. Well, thanks for this post. I think I'm gonna skip this one. I'd like a better resolution but it's not that bad on PW1. I guess they should really improve it (to like 440 ppi), then it will be worth the additional buck."
kindle,3by9il,Satanmymaster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:15:48 2015 UTC,So you'd stick with the PW 1?
kindle,3by9il,mulderc,2,Fri Jul 3 13:47:01 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. The speed alone is nice, the sharpness is nice, the new font and typography engine is nice and it sounds like the PW1 isn't getting that. I would probably stick with the PW2, the PW1 is a hard call."
kindle,3by9il,BoingoBongo,2,Fri Jul 3 19:58:08 2015 UTC,"I ended up ordering a new one just to see for myself since the few reviews out now leave a lot to be desired. For me it's all about the screen. If the improvement is anything close to what it was like going from the iPhone 3G to the 4, then it'll be worth it. If it's not that noticeable, then I'll stick with the 2.  It should be here tomorrow I hope."

kindle,3by9il,anirugu1,2,Sat Jul 4 03:03:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, here are a few initial thoughts:   The Paperwhite 3 is a definite improvement over the 2, but it's not a drastic difference. Many of the perceived benefits come from the new formatting methods and the Bookerly font, both of which should make their way to the Paperwhite 2 in the near future.  The new screen makes the biggest difference with smaller text sizes (obviously), and overall I think it will slightly reduce eye strain when reading for extended periods. But again, it's not an overwhelming improvement over the 2, it's just a little nicer.  The backlight on the 3 is slightly warmer than the 2, but from what I've read the color temperature can vary quite a bit. The overall brightness and evenness of the lighting is identical between both.    Here are 5 photos. I've matched fonts, sizes, and backlight levels. The 2 is on the left and the new 3 is on the right in each photo. Each Kindle is showing the same page of text, but the new formatting methods of the 3 mean they're not displayed 100% identically.   I haven't edited or adjusted the photos at all, they're straight from the camera. I've tried to include various text sizes and lighting conditions.  http://imgur.com/a/dmtun  All in all, I'll use them both this weekend and decide whether or not to keep the 3. It's definitely an improvement, but I don't know if it's a $120 improvement. I just have to fight with my urge to have the latest and greatest.  tl;dr: The 3 is great, but the 2 is still great. Not sure if the upgrade is worth it from the previous generation Paperwhite.   (edit: I just realized that in the photo with no backlight, the Paperwhite 2 is on the right side. Sorry 'bout that!)"
kindle,3by9il,sportscrazed2,2,Sat Jul 4 05:52:47 2015 UTC,"I'm getting my Paperwhite 3 in a matter of hours, so I'll be able to say more, but I was never pleased with the resolution of the Paperwhite, particularly with fonts that used thin lines.

A friend bought a laptop a few years ago and it had some and they took it back to the shop the same day and got a load of ""we're happy with that, there's only a few dead pixels and they're not in the middle of the screen"" crap.  I've never bought anything electrical in a shop since, relying on the Distance Selling Act rules in the UK (well, EU generally, actually) which allow you to return anything bought online without needing to give a reason, for a full refund, which lets me see if the deal pixels meet my policy (no dead pixels anywhere, not even near the edges of the screen).  At the bottom of my PW2 the light isn't as uniformly distributed.  Is that what you're talking about with bleeding?  Given that it's not a problem for me, though, plus every screen shot I've seen of it shows the problem, suggesting that it's a design fault/decision, means that I'm not returning it because of it."

kindle,3bt5wi,themach5,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:00:51 2015 UTC,"Ì assume since it is in the cloud, it passed the format compatibility test. Not sure though, so you need to clarify to us what is the format of the book.  If the book is bought from the amazon, I am assuming it isn't compatible with paperwhite. It happens that some ebooks are only available for kindle on pc or the kindle tablet. So you need to go check the page of the ebook, and see if it item descriptions tells you something."
kindle,3bt5wi,zenxbear,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:25:51 2015 UTC,"Try resetting the device, and re-download the book  Or, you can download Kindle for PC, download the book and use Calibre DeDRM plugin to remove DRM. Then use Calibre to add the book to your Kindle.  EDIT: Accidental submit."

The only ones I've struggled with are the pure JPG scans without easily extractable text.  When they're run through an expensive scanner with built-in OCR software, they usually work fine.  Back when I was in college, an army of unknown students managed to do this with just about every publicly available textbook I needed and put them up for free on the file sharing networks.  I'd assume this is still the case, and smart, dedicated kids who are choosing between food and hundreds of dollars in textbooks will, like velociraptors, uh, find a way."

kindle,3bo1g0,AcidWeb,4,Tue Jun 30 21:47:29 2015 UTC,I would imagine you are right in that the lost gig is being used by the OS. The new typography system and other features might take up a lot of space.
kindle,3bo1g0,Outsideerr,2,Wed Jul 1 03:24:09 2015 UTC,I make a stink about storage capacity on this subreddit a lot.  It's mostly from people who want to read manga or comics on their Kindles.  It's about a MB per page IIRC.

By this time, one would assume that people know this. Like all smartphone are sold with Full memory specification, then they notify that the os takes space.   Here you go, probably something around 0.7GB are dedicated do the OS. Add to that that GB for storage don't mean gibibytes, your windows reading of the size gave you 3.08 Gibibytes.

My current kindle has enough storage to hold enough books to keep me busy for years if i was ever stranded on mars like that new mat damon movie. And besides that, I have 3tb in my pc that can hold the files and take 30 seconds to retransfer if i ever needed to delete books. They should honestly just release one with enough for say only 20 books and charge $20 less or so and put a micro sd slot in it.  That would be enough for 99% of people and the $20 saved could easily go towards a 32gb card which is way overkil for ebooks alone"

I find myself reading whenever I get some sort of free time, be it at home or on break at work. Having tried to read on a tablet before, my first e-reader experience has been fantastic."
kindle,3bodkz,astonpuff,5,Sun Jul 5 07:21:13 2015 UTC,Got my first one as well. Called Amazon and paid to remove ads within about ten minutes of use. Now I can feel like I've gotten away from all the palaver when reading the Kindle.   It really was super easy to set up and load all the books borrowed from the library.
kindle,3bodkz,laughter95,3,Wed Jul 1 03:27:33 2015 UTC,Has anyone here upgraded from a PW2? I'm interested to know if the screen is so noticeably better that you find it worth it to have upgraded.
kindle,3bodkz,awyeah2,6,Wed Jul 1 03:37:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's worth the upgrade. My PW2 is 1 year old and I am still satisfied with it. If you compare both models next to another you will surely notice quite a difference, however $ 120 for a slightly better resolution and a new font isn't worth the money. Maybe upgrading from the original paperwhite to the new model deserves a thought."
kindle,3bodkz,oodeagleoo,2,Wed Jul 1 10:56:08 2015 UTC,And the new font is only a temporary advantage until the PW2 gets a software update.

kindle,3bodkz,7121958041201,2,Wed Jul 1 01:40:49 2015 UTC,"Just got mine today. If you're talking about the VERY bottom (maybe the last half inch), then yeah it looks like mine has 4 little grey bumps that stick out. It seems like that is due to how the front lighting works, though. If I turn the light down to minimum brightness it looks fine."
kindle,3bodkz,Skaggzz,2,Wed Jul 1 02:01:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that uneven light is what people call backlight bleed on monitors and TV's. I guess this would be considered front light bleed and mine has it too, but since it's the first lit kindle I've owned I can't say whether it is normal or a defect. I will say upgrading from a 4th gen kindle I was kind of disappointed that despite losing the physical buttons the bezel is bigger and its noticeably heavier."
kindle,3bodkz,BoingoBongo,2,Wed Jul 1 03:15:27 2015 UTC,"I believe it's normal. Somewhere a while ago, Amazon posted photos of what the lighting should look like in various conditions, and those shadows are just from the led lights."

kindle,3bp3db,GnosticMoron,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:20:20 2015 UTC,It is. Why would they be so reluctant to add subcollections? Boggles my mind.
kindle,3bp3db,kevin0125,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:27:30 2015 UTC,"Sub""collection"" - or sub-folder seems to be possible if you jailbreak your Kindle.  Here is how I organize my Kindle:   First I make these collections:   Reading To read, English Read Comics Newspaper   If you make it to display in list view, disable Word learning and Freetime, then all of it will fit in one page. And I put the book I have in its respective shelf.  Then, I suggest you read my guide here. You'll have nicely organized internal folder, and a renamed title. What I mean by that:   If the book is in series, then the book is sorted according to series and the book's number in its series. Example: Harry Potter - [01.00] - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone If the book isn't, it only display the title: Example: Great Expectation.   So, when you put the books in collection, the series are grouped together, and the books are organized in alphabetical order.   When I want to read anything, I go to the 2. To read folder, find and read the book, if I find it interesting, change the book to collection 1. Reading and continue reading. After that, I change the book to collection 3. Read. This will allow you to keep track of the book you are reading, and enable you to better control the book you are reading.  Cheer."

I'd suggest you search for books you've read in the past, and see if the Kindle Unlimited logo appears.  Also search for books you have been considering reading.   If you read plenty and the kind of books you read are in there, then it might be worth trialing.  It didn't really work out for me personally, most of my favorite scifi/fantasy books weren't there, and I tend to keep checking if new releases are added on there, but they mostly aren't."

Also, you can only have 10 books out at a time, and you never own the books, you just rent them. It's just as easy to use your local library ebooks, or get free books from free services like Centless, BookBub and Kindle@Freebooks."
kindle,3bn3kq,mrfixitx,2,Tue Jun 30 17:39:21 2015 UTC,I looked at it pretty extensively when it launched as my family reads a lot of books and all of our kindle are on the same account.    What I found at the time was that if it was a book from a major publisher that you could pick up at a local brick and mortars store it would almost never be available in kindle unlimited.    If it was a indie/self pub author it would be very likely to be available.    Since my family reads a lot of series by traditionally published authors it really didn't make sense for us.

I personally don't really like them but I know a lot of people do. You can always buy one with special offers and if you don't like them, you can pay to turn them off.  As for the difference between a Kindle and a tablet, reading on a Kindle is much easier on your eyes because of the e-ink. It more closely resembles an actual printed book.  My favorite part of reading on a kindle as opposed to a tablet though is that there are no distractions. I don't find myself all of a sudden dicking around  on Facebook or playing Scrabble or checking my email like I do on my iPad. The Kindle is pretty much only good for reading on, but it's great for that.  The one you're looking at getting is a phenomenal device."
kindle,3bmt7h,treesandclouds,2,Tue Jun 30 16:51:48 2015 UTC,"I find reading via the Kindle app on my iPad is very frustrating outside where my screen brightness has to go to the maximum level and the screen still remains barely visible. When that happens, the battery life takes a big hit as well because of the brightness.  I like that my kindle (Paperwhite) is just as visible as plain paper outside, and is lighter and smaller, and therefore easier to hold for long periods. The battery life will also far outlast my iPad, so I can save my iPad's battery for other uses. You can leave the kindle on a page of a book for a while without consuming much if any power, while as long as the iPad's screen is on, the battery is being depleted.  The special offers refers to displaying advertisements in your kindle's lock screen while it is sleeping."
kindle,3bmt7h,An_Ugly_Pigeon,2,Tue Jun 30 16:58:14 2015 UTC,"buy it ""with special offers""- and if you don't like them, you can pay later and turn them off. I thought I'd hate them but really don't mind. I read via ipad for a while, but I won't be going back. It's easier on the eyes, easier to read, fits in a back pocket, the battery lasts forever. If I were to break it somehow, I'd buy a replacement immediately."
kindle,3bmt7h,zigzampow,2,Tue Jun 30 17:02:59 2015 UTC,"The iPad 2 is heavy and the screen is not very nice.  The actual reading experience is mostly just putting words on a screen, and an iPad and a kindle both do that, but a kindle is way nicer - easier on the eyes, and on the hands."

Removing the battery is easy. It is just held in place by 2 screws. Removing the back is the hard part. I opened it using a flat head screw driver, but that was quite risky as I could have easily damaged the motherboard or the screen ribbon cable. If you do a google search you can find instructions on exactly where you should insert a flat object to force the back open. The back cover is held in place by a number of plastic tabs, so be prepared for some of the tabs to break or get damaged in the process."

It's not optimal for input, but It's not terrible, that being said.

The fast refresh rate required doesn't really get along with the slow refresh rates that e-readers have Speed reading does decrease comprehension. The faster you read the lesser you will comprehend and the less likely you are to remember what you read.    The whole point of reading a book is to, well, read the book. If I just want to get it over with quickly then it means that I'm not really interested in that book. I just want to add it to my ""Read"" collection probably because it's considered a good thing to read that book.   An alternative would be skimming. If I have to speed read I would rather skim through the text without an external application. Skimming is where we are randomly looking at words and just picking out the verb sentences which contain some action. The rest all is more or less dropped. Another alternative would be to keep looking around at books until we find a topic that we truly and deeply care about. And start reading from those topics."

I thought nyt had a deal that includes kindle, but I'm not sure.

I read a thread on the Amazon discussion board thing and some people were wondering if the font was going to be exclusive to only new devices, in order to get people to pay more money/buy a new device. The Bookerly font has already been pushed to non-Kindle hardware months ago. Either they are waiting to push it out, there's a technical issue, or they're only going to include it with new Kindles.

kindle,3b7dzl,crippledplaything,3,Fri Jun 26 22:30:56 2015 UTC,"FOR AMAZON'S BOOK: The book's location and annotations are automatically updated using WhisperSync.  FOR SIDELOADED BOOK: This can't be done with Calibre. The book's annotations and location is stored in different files from the book file. Calibre seems to only manage the books file. Calibre can, however, delete the book's annotations and location.  I only use the Kindle 7th gen, so the following might not be correct for other devices.  The Kindle stores book's location and annotations in the <book_title>.sdr FOLDER. Here you're likely to find 3 files: .apnx (for pages number), and the other two for book location and annotations.    How do I know this? When I removed the two other files, all the annotations are gone, and the book reset to page 1.    Note that the file names of the two files in .SDR folder are added a code. As the code is SIMILAR between many books in my collection, the added code is likely to be device's identification, not the book's identification, and therefore probably can't be used across devices.  You can still try copy and paste the whole folder (book file and the .SDR folder) to other device, but it probably won't work."

You're right that if you register a new email address you won't keep any of your books, but that's why you should just change your current amazon account to a US account.  To do this, you go to www.amazon.com/manageyourkindle, then look around for something like ""Manage content and devices"". (The US version of the manageyourkindle page is different to the UK one, but I think on the UK store the link you want is towards the left somewhere. If the UK store has been updated to match the US one by now, then you should be able to click the big Settings tab).  You should find an option to change your country from UK to US.

kindle,3b42ck,youcantsitwithme,3,Thu Jun 25 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"The regular Kindle Touch should fit your needs, or an ebayed Kindle Keyboard. I personally adore the backlight of the Paperwhite though, it's nothing like reading on an iPad. You might be really sensitive to light though, I don't know."
kindle,3b42ck,JoeyMallone,11,Fri Jun 26 03:37:23 2015 UTC,"i, like you, absolutely cannot stand serious reading on any kind of backlit LCD screen. the kindle paperwhite is perfect for me, and it will be perfect for you. it's NOT backlit - it is ""front lit"" (http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/12/26/technology/light-reading.html), so 1) with the light on, little-to-no eye strain, and 2) the light can be dimmed to the point where it's almost undetectable unless you're in pitch darkness."
kindle,3b42ck,Quickben33,4,Thu Jun 25 20:59:42 2015 UTC,"I did hear that 'front lit' term mentioned in the Amazon reviews, makes sense that it should not hurt your eyes. In a couple youtube videos I've watched though it did look more similar to an phone/ipad screen compared to what I was imagining in my head. Sounds like we have the same level of hate for reading on LCD screens though, so I'm glad to hear it works for you! At the very least I'm going to try out the PW and see how it feels."
kindle,3b42ck,bunkins,7,Thu Jun 25 22:01:38 2015 UTC,"i've had almost every version of kindle e-reader, including the e-ink screens with no lighting at all. the front lit paperwhite is 99% as good in terms of no eye strain, but the ability to read at night far outweighs that 1%. you'll love it."
kindle,3b42ck,JoeyMallone,9,Thu Jun 25 22:05:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, while reading in bed it now feels more comfortable to use the front lit Kindle than a reading lamp.   I have limited experience. I own the Paperwhite 2, and have only tried an older basic Kindle. Hated the basic Kindle, but from what I hear the newer models are much better. But the reading comfort is exceptional, to the point that I prefer my Kindle PW for reading in bed – in all other settings the Kindle only wins on practicality for me personally, but the format and front light is very nice for night reading. It's also much easier to fall asleep after reading with a Kindle than with an iPad. :)"
kindle,3b42ck,zem,9,Thu Jun 25 22:49:43 2015 UTC,"The regular Kindle has no backlight. That's what you want.  The Kindle Paperwhite has a backlight but you can adjust it. And then there's the Voyage, which can adjust the backlight for you automatically based on ambient lighting."
kindle,3b42ck,AgedPumpkin,11,Thu Jun 25 20:31:59 2015 UTC,"The Kindle Paperwhite has a backlight    This isn't correct. The PW uses e-ink. You can adjust the brightness, but it's a frontlight, not a backlight."
kindle,3b42ck,PenguinJim,3,Thu Jun 25 23:52:36 2015 UTC,"Ok cool thank you, the regular Kindle is the 'Kindle Keyboard' correct? Looks like Amazon does not sell them first-party anymore. Would you also happen to know if the regular Kindle stores words after you look them up in the e-dictionary? I read one of the Kindles did this (stored the words you didn't know on some list) and that seemed really cool."
kindle,3b42ck,crippledplaything,8,Thu Jun 25 20:50:40 2015 UTC,The only kindles with a backlight are the fires. The paperwhite and voyage have a frontlit screen which I have found to be much easier on the eyes. Other kindles have no lighting whatsoever.  I had the same problem reading at night with my phone and tablet but find reading with the paperwhite to be much more relaxing and not stressful on my eyes at all.
kindle,3b42ck,crippledplaything,7,Thu Jun 25 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"This is the regular Kindle, current gen. The Kindle Keyboard is pretty old at this point.  I don't know of any Kindle feature that stores words you don't know, but I'm not a big e-ink Kindle user anyway. Perhaps you're thinking of WordWise?"
kindle,3b42ck,crippledplaything,3,Thu Jun 25 21:56:16 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, I thought the Kindle Keyboard was the last model to not have any lighting, and that all the new ones have the front-lit bulbs. That's cool, so if I wanted I could get a touchscreen and no lighting.  Well, looking back on the article I saw that on it actually was the original Kindle (or the Kindle Keyboard) so I guess that answers my own question. But it did say 'whenever you mark a word, phrase or paragraph, it automatically gets saved on your Kindle device.' And that you can 'build a vocabulary list simply by highlighting words' then 'your highlights and notes are saved in a file called My-Clippings.txt' which apparently you access by plugging the Kindle into the computer. This was the article, so actually now I don't know if the PW's or the $80 Kindle does this."
kindle,3b42ck,ScubaSteve1219,4,Thu Jun 25 22:17:37 2015 UTC,"if i were to buy an old kindle, i'd get the kindle keyboard, just for the physical next page buttons."
kindle,3b42ck,ScubaSteve1219,5,Thu Jun 25 23:07:13 2015 UTC,"Chiming in with a kindle keyboard. Always in a case and not used a lot, actually. Looking to get the new paperwhite. :)"
kindle,3b42ck,nexnex,5,Thu Jun 25 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"Me too. Mine developed a line after just 49 months of heavy use, but the Voyage still isn't available internationally (through Amazon), so I've been making do since February.  I can't see anything between the Kindle Keyboard and the Voyage that interests me. It has to be buttons or nothing!  (Although bencalpink's suggestion that the keyboard controls are ""wonky"" seems fair to me! Not a particularly pleasant keyboard.)"
kindle,3b42ck,themadturk,2,Fri Jun 26 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"The PaperWhite does it, for sure. I have a PW2 and I have Vocabulary Builder enabled. It's different from My Clippings.   You can access Vocab Builder directly from the device. It looks like a book in the main list of titles you have added.   The regular Kindle with no frontlight also has this feature."
kindle,3b42ck,Bill_565,4,Thu Jun 25 23:38:39 2015 UTC,"The PaperWhite does store words that you look up. It's called ""Vocabulary Builder""   Words you look up in the dictionary when you read get stored there. Then you can review them like flashcards and see usage examples. It's an option in the Settings, under Reading Options>Language Learning>Vocabulary Builder. :)  /u/bencalpink, don't miss this."
kindle,3b42ck,twowheels,3,Thu Jun 25 23:36:23 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'm leaning heavily towards the PW2 now.
kindle,3b42ck,teokcmy,3,Fri Jun 26 00:01:34 2015 UTC,The new one comes out on the 30th for the usual price. You may want to wait a few weeks to see if there are any issues.   PW2 for $109 but it shows it being out of stock on my end.  Or you could shop around a bit. :)
kindle,3b42ck,jethoman,3,Fri Jun 26 02:03:10 2015 UTC,Don't doubt ya but do you have a link/info for that? Was about to buy the PW2 tonight but did a few google searches for 'Amazon 20th anniversary sale' and couldn't find anything.
kindle,3b5b8x,bicyclemom,4,Fri Jun 26 02:23:56 2015 UTC,"it is. kindle app for android has always been a battery eater. One of the top 10, if I can rightly remember.   Ed: found it: ""For apps that don't start automatically, Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) Kindle, Snapchat, LINE, Spotify, Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) and Amazon Shopping give battery life the biggest beating -- but only when you're actively using them, unlike Facebook, which drains your battery whether you're using it or not.

kindle,3b2vyo,mrfixitx,6,Thu Jun 25 17:38:02 2015 UTC,"Not out of the box, no. This would destroy the battery life of a device that takes advantage of being in sleep mode most of the time.  With rooting and some homebrew software it could be, but you wouldn't really want it. Also not possible if you are on the latest version.  Given that documents are cloud sync'ed you have access the next time you turn on your device to use it anyway right ?   If you are leaving the wifi, just turn it on for a second before leaving maybe ?  Amazon content will auto deliver over 3G world wide if you have that model as well."
kindle,3b2vyo,Nuts-n-Bolts,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I can see both pros and cons with such a feature, but the most important thing is to know that it isn't supported (and thus I don't have to spend time searching for it)."
kindle,3b2vyo,twowheels,2,Mon Jun 29 08:23:08 2015 UTC,"I read this a bit ago and left content that there was no answer, and then I just had an idea...   I'm not sure if you have a specific time in mind (maybe while you're at work, just before you leave?  maybe when you wake up, just before you leave for work?)... if so, I have an idea...  When you plug the Kindle into a computer, it goes into a drive mode, but stays on.  When you eject the Kindle from the computer, it goes back to reading mode and then stays on until it times out.  Presumably it will do a sync during this time.  What if you were to plug it in to your computer to charge whenever you're in an area where you want it to auto-update.  Then, at the scheduled time use cron/at (depending on your OS) to schedule an eject command to cause the Kindle to ""turn on"", which might cause it to do an update...  worth a try, if that's ""close enough"" to scheduling the task."

I would suggest doing any research before creating descriptions which are far from the truth :-P  Mangle WAS great piece of software - but now it only output CBZ and as every Kindle newer than Kindle Keyboard have broken CBZ reader - it is completely obsolete.  KCC is multi-platform converter that create Panel View MOBI and KEPUBs files. Yes. Is was partially based on Mangle but it is completely new level of technology.  It is fruit of few hundred hours of tests, feedback gathering and prayer so we could achieve best image quality on E-Ink type displays. So please... no ""like Mangle"" :-D"

I don't think the snippet I wrote (again, not based on my own experience as I don't read comics and therefore do not use comic book converter software), was ""far from the truth.""

While I've migrated almost completely from my Kindle Keyboard to a Paperwhite, I do miss the physical buttons a great deal (as well as the audio support, which I earnestly hope makes an eventual comeback)."
kindle,3aw1pr,sans_doute,5,Tue Jun 23 23:54:18 2015 UTC,The Voyage page-turn pressure points aren't casually pressed. You almost need a slight pinch [front/back] which works when you're holding it but not if it's laid down.  One of the things I enjoyed about my older keyboard kindle was that I could have it on the table while I was eating and do a soft tap to the edge with my knuckle if my fingers were dirty. Swiping my PW or my Voyage works but I did prefer the physical buttons out on the edge.
kindle,3aw1pr,anaarsince87,8,Wed Jun 24 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I have a Voyage and I just press on the spot when its laid flat. As long as you have the sensitivity set correctly, a pinch isn't needed."
kindle,3aw1pr,Fizzie94,5,Wed Jun 24 01:23:33 2015 UTC,Same. I have sensitivity pretty high so not much touch is needed.

kindle,3aw1pr,pointtini,5,Wed Jun 24 17:27:19 2015 UTC,"No, we all love them, but they are expensive to manufacture, and they also are an easy point of failure.  Having said that, the more expensive model has both a touchscreen and non-mechanical page turn buttons."
kindle,3aw1pr,Nicolay77,6,Wed Jun 24 19:28:26 2015 UTC,Do you really need them or do you just think you need them but in reality haven't tried a kindle touch version? Because I thought I need them but I really don't. Even with touch you can hold it in one hand an still turn pages with the same by just moving your thumb a tiny bit.  It's OK if you really love it. However in my experience most people claiming they can't live without them actually never tried.

kindle,3aw1pr,Not_here_to_be_nice,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:44:47 2015 UTC,"Can't really compare that. I never have accidental page turns because the screen is below the bezels. You can really just hold it in your right hand, thumb on the bezel and with a simple press without lifting your thumb it will  touch the screen and turn the page. You can even hold it better than with physical buttons because you can hold it at a different position. On the con side this is only possible with the right hand. I'm just saying each has advantages. Yes even the touch screen has advantages. But once you are getting used to, which took me like 4 pages, it is really a great thing.  Again it may be just a matter of taste but I only encounter people who hate the idea of switching from a kindle keyboard but never actually tried a touch version which is just stupid."
kindle,3aw1pr,huntmol,3,Wed Jun 24 14:39:43 2015 UTC,"I love my paperwhite, but it would be great to have two options - one all touchscreen and one with page turn buttons. Really don't like the Voyage's ""touch sensitive areas"" as a substitute for proper buttons."

Well, it's my second after the screen on my first broke within the first year for no reason and they replaced it.  I have been keeping an eye out for a couple of old Kindle Keyboards online for dirt cheap just in case mine ever breaks. I'm going to be gutted when this one dies, it has been my friend for years now so I wanna be ready so I can fix it.  I've tried the Kobo reader and the newer kindles with touchscreen at other peoples houses and I just don't like them. I have no need for a kindle fire tablet as I have another tablet, so reading books is literally all I use my kindle for. The physical buttons just fit so well.  Like someone else in this thread mentioned though, if they did a paperwhite screen with physical keyboard and buttons I would buy that immediately."

kindle,3aw1pr,stoosepp,2,Thu Jun 25 09:49:54 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you! Part of reading deeply is being able to connect with the text, to hold the 'book' as if it were a real book, shifting how you old it, resting your thumb in the middle of the page, etc. We point at words we don't understand, we move our finger under sentences we need to concentrate more on. There's actually research out there that speaks to our ability to remember and enjoy what we're reading when we can physically connect with the words. Personally, I find myself not enjoying reading on the paperwhite because I have to constantly think ""don't touch the book"", like 90% of the surface of my book is now off limits, except for when I want to turn a page."

kindle,3auvsm,huntmol,11,Tue Jun 23 18:22:31 2015 UTC,That photo of the three of them really shows how good the contrast on the voyage is though. Makes me think if I ever upgrade I'll go for the future version of that.  Also I still feel 300ppi hasn't truly cracked it yet. It still doesn't look clean enough on the smallest font setting. Hopefully future version will up this.
kindle,3auvsm,redhairedDude,8,Tue Jun 23 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"I have to think that with this iteration of the paperwhite, either they have big plans for the newest Voyage, or they're scrapping it for now.    The new PW is 40% cheaper and matches up on specs.  Choosing between them is no contest.    Unless I'm missing something."
kindle,3auvsm,Endangered_Feces84,15,Tue Jun 23 22:05:43 2015 UTC,"Voyage is smaller, lighter, has haptic buttons for page turn, have light sensor for adjusting screen light level, might be faster(reviewers have been unclear on this part), better contrast ratio, also has arguably better texture on the screen.  Does that mean you should spend an extra $80 for it, probably not but the contrast ratio and smaller/lighter size makes it tempting for me."
kindle,3auvsm,mulderc,4,Tue Jun 23 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"Well then.   There you have it.    Contrast ratio is a pretty big deal to a lot of people, actually."
kindle,3auvsm,Endangered_Feces84,6,Tue Jun 23 22:46:39 2015 UTC,yeah all those features you listed is why I still have no regrets for getting my Voyage. despite this Paperwhite refresh I'd still pick the Voyage every time.
kindle,3auvsm,ScubaSteve1219,3,Wed Jun 24 03:54:30 2015 UTC,I have only played briefly with the voyage but something about the design was off-putting to me. I am still tempted by it but for now I think the PW3 is the better device for me.
kindle,3auvsm,mulderc,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:05:28 2015 UTC,I think one drawback of the new Voyage design is the glass screen. I really like the Paperwhite's matte screen. The Voyage could have some glare in certain situations.

kindle,3auvsm,staked,3,Tue Jun 23 20:26:42 2015 UTC,I had the PW3 on order and ended up picking up the Voyage at Best Buy today. After seeing the flush screen and using the buttons and feeling the weight difference I figured it was worth the extra $80 since I'll use it for a few years.
kindle,3auvsm,mulderc,5,Wed Jun 24 00:40:09 2015 UTC,I'm still on the fence. I like the flush screen but found the haptic buttons to be odd. I really like the adaptive backlight and better contrast ratio but $80 is still a bit much for just that.

I mean, the Fire Phone: An outlet to sell Amazon products. Kindle Fire: To sell Amazon Prime and Amazon Appstore apps. The Kindle: A outlet to sell ebooks. Amazon is a retailer first, and if they allowed EPUB, it can potentially reduce the sales of their ebook store. The Kindle doesn't have EPUB compatibility not because it is incapable, but it is just opposite of Amazon's goals, especially since these devices are probably sold at cost."
kindle,3auvsm,DublinBen,2,Tue Jun 23 21:58:53 2015 UTC,Other retailers can and do sell Kindle compatible formats.
kindle,3auvsm,mulderc,5,Tue Jun 23 22:01:49 2015 UTC,With DRM? Pretty sure when you sell a kindle compatible format and are not Amazon you have to do it DRM-free which publishers generally dislike.
kindle,3auvsm,zenxbear,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:30:23 2015 UTC,They watermark it. Springer sells pdf in this way. Other platforms are selling drm free epub/mobi version of same book.
kindle,3auvsm,mulderc,2,Tue Jun 23 22:56:05 2015 UTC,Has there ever been a watermark related court case? If my kindle is stolen and books I've bought end up on the internet and Amazon come after me I'm going to tell them exactly where to go and how to get there.
kindle,3auvsm,mulderc,7,Wed Jun 24 18:01:40 2015 UTC,There is no reason for them to be compatible with EPUB and most the people who complain about this are technically savvy enough to use tools to deal with it.
kindle,3auvsm,FireOpalCO,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:29:37 2015 UTC,"I think they should support EPUB, was talking more from Amazons prospective."
kindle,3auvsm,Targ,2,Fri Jun 26 02:58:45 2015 UTC,"From what I've read online EPUB is still able to be set up as proprietary, so even if Kindle took the format, a Nook EPUB could refuse to run on a Kindle.  If that's true I could see them refusing to take the format so that Amazon doesn't get blamed when people can get one type of EPUB to work (personal document) but not another (due to the producer of the file).   In response to /u/Alumineous comment about it being an outlet to sell products (true), I do believe it's also about customer experience.  Otherwise they wouldn't allow library books on the Kindle.  If EPUB is a maybe proposition, making it a simple answer (no EPUB) is a better customer experience for most users, especially the ones who are not highly tech savvy (a chunk of the Kindle market is definitely the boomers and their parents)."

kindle,3auvsm,pixie_led,2,Mon Jun 29 05:46:23 2015 UTC,I upgraded from a kindle keyboard to a paperwhite and thought I would miss the page turn buttons and really I don't.    The backlight and the kindle being much more responsive and the touch keyboard being better than I expected (and better than the keyboard on the old kindle keyboard) would make it very hard for me to go back.

kindle,3aw9z2,faxillus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"Agree on the names.   I have the 5th (black). If I remember correctly from my research the main difference besides color is supposedly very slightly faster page-turns and very slightly better defined fonts. So, pretty much the same, yeah.   The thing is, at least where I bought them (ebay), the average price of both devices was basically the same, so even though the difference is pretty unsubstantial, if you're gonna pay the same, might as well buy the newer and slightly better one."
kindle,3aw9z2,ScubaSteve1219,2,Wed Jun 24 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"the black 5th gen was the first Kindle I ever bought, but I sold it to pay for my upgrade to the Paperwhite when it was new. I'd do anything to get one of those back, so then I'd have that, the Paperwhite, and the Voyage. I've become a Kindle collector."
kindle,3aw9z2,faxillus,2,Wed Jun 24 03:58:49 2015 UTC,"Well you can always look for them on Ebay. I bought mine new for about 65€, but I think you can find them cheaper in the US and/or in used condition."

kindle,3ate1h,NigelKF,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:43:27 2015 UTC,"No, I'm sorry. I don't know anyone with a PW2. The PW2 has a 212 ppi display, so the picture would be slightly better than the K3 (167 ppi) one and a bit worse than the Voyage (300 ppi)."
kindle,3ate1h,mbirth,5,Thu Jun 25 12:33:40 2015 UTC,"As /u/amandasha said, the touchscreen is a much larger benefit than it seems for an e-reader. Tapping a word to get the definition/wikipedia entry, quickly browsing through chapters to reference something earlier in the book, and even just simply navigating your book library is much nicer on a touchscreen, in my opinion.  Not to mention the higher resolution and built-in light (which I almost never use, but is a lifesaver when you need it)."
kindle,3ate1h,huntmol,2,Tue Jun 23 12:59:15 2015 UTC,"Does it still work and do you use it basically as a book?  If so, I don't really see a need to get a new one."
kindle,3ate1h,joftheinternet,10,Tue Jun 23 10:37:17 2015 UTC,There are plenty of reasons. Unless OP is on a tight budget I'd suggest going for an upgrade.   I was skeptical when I first heard of the touchscreen but it's so much nicer than I expected. The dictionary feature and x-ray alone make a huge difference.   I've picked up my old Kindle with the keyboard on occasion (for fun) but I know I could never go back to reading on it. It'd be like trading in my smartphone for a RAZR from 2007.  OP: you might want to wait for the new Paperwhite to come out.
kindle,3ate1h,amandasha,2,Tue Jun 23 11:55:04 2015 UTC,I upgraded from a kindle touch to a 2nd generation paperwhite. Was worth it to me just for the light. And as you mentioned dictionary is a huge upgrade if you still own one without it. Especially as a non native English speaker who likes to read English books. Also my old kindle made another book lover really happy when I gave it away.  However if you don't need this your old kindle is just fine. But I'm guessing since OP is asking it would be the right thing to upgrade.

kindle,3ate1h,h2orat,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:12:20 2015 UTC,"I actually posted the same thing a couple days ago, but deleted it as I decided an hour later that I would buy the new kindle. I have the old kindle keyboard that is 6 years old already and it was time for a new purchase as I read a lot.  So I pre-ordered the new kindle and it will come in on the 30th of June. I'm excited. I was debating if I should get the voyage though, but I got the paperwhite and ordered a premium leather cover from kindle for 70 bucks (expensive but oh well, premium quality it's for the price gap of voyage.)"

kindle,3ate1h,keikun13,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:43:03 2015 UTC,"I have a Kindle 5 and a Paperwhite 2. I mostly got the Paperwhite because of the backlight. It's beautiful and I have it on all the time except in the brightest sunlight.   Touch screen is very useful if you highlight a lot or look up words a lot. Touching and holding a word to get a definition is sooo much nicer on the PW2 rather than using the awkward directional buttons on the Kindle 5.   I do miss the physical page turn buttons on the old Kindle for one handed reading though. Still, I tend to use the Paperwhite more.  If the light's not a big deal, and you don't look up words or highlight very much, an upgrade won't be as big a deal for you. But if those are important, I think you'd be happy with an upgrade."

Regarding beginners, every post ends up with people recommending Calibre.  More often than not, when someone I know buys an ereader, I tell them about Calibre.  I end up having to describe it to them by saying, ""It's like itunes for your kindle.""  I'll try and work on something that works within the faq, but Calibre should be prominently displayed on the sidebar.    One problem I've noticed is that there are a lot of ""Is my kindle broken"" posts.  The answer is typically, ""Yes.  Call Amazon.""  EDIT:  The extremely limited FAQ also mentions the browser.  Honestly, the browser is crap and should barely be mentioned as a perk.  If someone wants to browse the net, use an ipad or their smartphone.  Kindles aren't built for that type of browsing and shouldn't be advertised as such by us consumers."

Maybe the screensaver and accessories posts could be combined into a ""show off your Kindle setup"" thread? I would worry that the AutoMod posts might clog the sub if there's one every week. Not sure."
kindle,3as5zh,Zaffaro,4,Tue Jun 23 02:04:12 2015 UTC,Maybe someone on the Mobile Read forums would know. Also there is a text editor for the PW1 if you have jailbroken it and installed KUAL. I don't know if there is one for the PW3 however.

kindle,3amn55,Minidask,7,Sun Jun 21 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"grade school tricks   So... college level tricks?  :)  Actually, I think of the movie ""The Wonder Boys"" where this professor has a book a few years overdue, and it's ... voluminous.  The only person who has read the manuscript says:   Hannah Green: And even though your book is really beautiful, I mean, amazingly beautiful, it's... it's at times... it's... very detailed. You know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses, and the dental records, and so on. And... I could be wrong, but it sort of reads in places like you didn't make any choices. At all. And I was just wondering if it might not be different if... if when you wrote you weren't always... under the influence."
kindle,3amn55,mike413,3,Mon Jun 22 00:32:59 2015 UTC,I find it kind of creepy that Amazon knows which pages that I have read.
kindle,3amn55,seeingeyefrog,7,Mon Jun 22 03:14:13 2015 UTC,You can sync your progress with whispersync or you can remember where you are each time you open a book. They're always going to know because of the technology. Tying that to author payments is a bit questionable though.
kindle,3amn55,KipTheFury,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:24:27 2015 UTC,"You can turn it off if you think it's creepy. You've just posted on a site so the site owners and your isp have a pretty good idea what you're reading, as does your credit card company and possibly the developers of your browser, and your operating system, and the security services, and anyone hacking the above, etc.  I mean, the info is out there; this just lets you use it to keep your books in sync. Nobody really cares what page of what book you're on.  You're free to get books using a vpn/tor and stick them on your kindle via usb with airplane mode on. I have better things to do with my time."
kindle,3amn55,Frigguggi,2,Mon Jun 22 21:51:51 2015 UTC,So does this mean I only pay for the pages I read? Or does Amazon have an incentive to sell us books we won't actually read?

kindle,3akad8,alvareo-,4,Sun Jun 21 02:57:27 2015 UTC,Kindle PW2 has 4 GB which translates to 3.25 i think. Of course the Aura will have something around that instead of 4 GB.

kindle,3akad8,Dragonsong,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:55:02 2015 UTC,"yes, because Amazon's research department has a 100% success rate of making successful, profitable hardware.  Like the Amazon fire tv device.  Or even their kindle tablets. Other e-reader companies added more storage to their devices, which means they came to a different conclusion than Amazon  They're cost cutting and hoping people don't notice the wimpy storage size.  It's bloody obvious given that the official specification for storage as seen on the website is ""Holds over 1,000 books"", rather than 4 GB.  Yet the cost is rather low given the price of flash memory.  I know what you were trying to do, and I can't argue with what you initially said, but my comment was more directed towards Amazon than yourself, and I apologize if it seemed that way."
kindle,3akad8,minderaser,4,Sun Jun 21 12:23:50 2015 UTC,"It's not that they're cost cutting, it's that they're cost cutting as much as they can from what their research shows. I know a lot of people with Kindles and none of us have a problem with the amount of onboard storage available. Simply put: not everyone even owns thousands of books or would want them with them all on the device at once. (And my Paperwhite model only has 2gb because I have the pre-refresh version).  Also I bought the Fire HD6 8gb tablet. That is extremely low storage for a tablet. Why buy it? It was dirt cheap ($99) from a trusted brand with relatively high quality components other than storage space (and arguably screen resolution... but it's not really noticeable). I'm more a media consumption guy (music / movies / tv) than mobile game fanatic. I'm also not one to download a few dozen movies and have them stored on my tablet. I'm sure that's a good use case for large amounts of storage, but I don't travel so I always have Wifi. And I'm sure there are plenty that share similar views to me given that there are 18.5k reviews with an average of 4.5 stars.  This is the same reason there are now $200 Windows laptops (and Chromebooks) selling. People are willing to compromise for certain features and pricepoint. I really doubt  Well I can't comment on the profitability of Amazon's hardware department, other than that the Fire phone was a miserable failure.   Anyway you can check out this (somewhat dated) article: http://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyclay/2012/10/12/amazon-confirms-it-makes-no-profit-on-kindles/  Amazon is not interested so much in making profit off of hardware as they are from the various stores they are in control of -- and they do a great job. I love reading on my Paperwhite, and occasionally my HD6 when I go out, so I got Kindle Unlimited (and before that I've spent loads on books). I love my Fire TV stick and watching some TV on the go with the HD6, so this is the primary reason I purchased Amazon prime -- I don't even take much advantage of 2 day shipping.  They make great hardware which integrates perfectly into their marketplaces and it makes me want to spend money. And with 1-Click set up it's so damn easy.  Anyway my final closing thought is: Amazon is not targeting the users those other companies are; the ""power users"". Yes amazon could add a microsd card slot or more storage. It would likely make the Kindles cost more. These ereader companies are all aiming at a certain demographic, and sales numbers prove they are doing a pretty good job."
kindle,3akad8,FlatBot,3,Sun Jun 21 13:21:45 2015 UTC,"If you're going to point out amazon hardware flops you gotta mention the Fire phone.  The tablets and TV device are doing OK, I think."
kindle,3akad8,alvareo-,3,Mon Jun 22 01:36:27 2015 UTC,"Or even their kindle tablets.    They're selling millions of them. It did to ereaders what apple did for the smartphone and tablet; took something which already existed and turned it into something which people actually wanted to buy.   4gb is far more than <1% of consumers need in an ereader.  Hoarders and pirates like a lot of space; people who buy a couple of books a month, which I'm guessing is something like the audience they're going for, will find that almost a lifetime's space, and of course you can remove legally purchased product from your kindle and redownload it again should you choose to."

kindle,3afk0o,alvareo-,5,Fri Jun 19 18:49:58 2015 UTC,"I actually watched a Computerphile video a few months ago on this issue. You can watch the video if you want, but the thing you get from the video is: It takes a lot of processing power to do hyphenation and to calculate how much words to put in each line while still keeping it comfortable to read. Obviously the Kindle cannot do this easily because it is severely limited in processing power and there is battery to think about as well.  So yes, it is assumed that it will depend on the ebook. Ebooks will have to be updated manually for the font sizes. The Kindle hardware itself just cannot do this process automatically. (The reason why paper books are justified and hyphenated so well is because 1) humans edit it and desktop computers can do the process much faster and 2) there is only one font size.)  It is however hard to find out how it will behave since no one has the Paperwhite 3 yet. I would assume if the book wasn't edited then it would be left-justified or justified the way it is right now. Books will update automatically once they have updated the ebook, I would think.  EDIT 1: Books will be assumed to not be precompiled, due to time, increase in file size, and impracticability.  EDIT 2: I still think it takes a lot of processing power to do these formatting changes, so I suspect it may just process a few pages before and ahead of you to maximize battery life. Or Amazon's algorithm is really, really good."
kindle,3afk0o,Alumineous,5,Fri Jun 19 21:15:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have thought the handling formatting would be impossible to implement sensibly; the kindles are not that lacking in cpu power. Also, on my pw2 I can choose 6 fonts and each of those can be in 10 or however many font sizes. It's unlikely that amazon would precompute justification for a book in each of those fonts/sizes individually.  It'll likely be doing it on the fly, meaning that it should work on any book.  I read that some books would be getting Bookerly first, but I'm not aware of any technical reason why it won't end up being put onto all (supported) kindles as just another font, to be chosen as before."
kindle,3afk0o,Alumineous,6,Fri Jun 19 22:03:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are correct. Precomputing would cause the book to increase in size since it would have to store 10+ combinations for each font size and resolution. And with your, logic, I would then assume it calculates the pages a few pages ahead or a few pages behind, not the whole book entirely, which would save battery and less push the CPU.   Justification is fairly easy for the Kindle to do. But now, the author has a option to enable left justification for their books. You cannot user change the justification of a book, since Amazon doesn't let you. This is the same for ligatures, kernings, and hyphens; the author has to enable it first. Proof is here, at the very bottom.  Bookerly can be selected for every book, but you have to wait for a few months before the older Kindles are updated with the new font and layout engine."
kindle,3afk0o,Alumineous,3,Fri Jun 19 23:12:16 2015 UTC,"(Actually, you have portrait and landscape mode, so double again any precalculations!)  I'm sure some books are getting some sort of mark-up baked into them by amazon, using an algorithm (rather than human intervention) given the speed they're converting books.  I'm optimistic this formatting will be trivially reversed and added into Calibre (or some plugin/stand-alone tool) before too long if indeed any markup is needed at all.  It might just be a bit they're flipping that says ""yes, use the new engine on this"" rather than word-by-word markup."
kindle,3afk0o,thermoplastics,2,Fri Jun 19 23:20:21 2015 UTC,Where is this image from? Also it's interesting how they partly give it as an example for hyphenation yet there's no hyphenation in it

kindle,3afk0o,themadturk,3,Sat Jun 20 02:26:21 2015 UTC,Amazon stated it will have to be books that are updated to allow the new hyphenation. There is even a list on their site for the new compatible eBooks.

I tried it a few years ago and I remember it being pretty terrible.  I was using the iPad app and you either had the option to read the pages normally or double tap the panels and it did some weird thing where it just made each panel slightly bigger.

kindle,3a9jf1,dangzal,16,Thu Jun 18 08:29:54 2015 UTC,"It concerns me that the new Paperwhiteʼs screen (left) has a blue appearance compared to the Paperwhite 2.  From measuring my own Paperwhite 2, which is the newer 4GB model, its display has a color temperature of 5700K.  Neutral would be around 5000K, and the ideal for reading at night would be <3000K.     The “white” LEDs used to illuminate the screen are really phosphor-coated blue LEDs—as are most (all?) white LEDs—which means that there is quite a lot of blue energy in its spectrum.  Though people often make the claim that a Kindle is much better for your sleep cycle if you read before going to sleep, since it is front-lit rather than back-lit, itʼs really not much better than an iPad with its 6500K display—especially if you use an app which changes the background to something other than white.     I still prefer reading on my Kindle of course, as I find e-ink displays more comfortable to read for long periods of time, but if you are concerned about blue light from “screens” affecting your sleep, the Kindle won't help, and the Paperwhite 3 looks as though it will be worse in this regard.     Far better to read using a dimmed halogen lamp at night, or wear blue-blocking glasses.  And the blue-blocking glasses which are effective will have orange or red lenses—not a slight tint like brown/amber sunglasses.  When viewing an image such as this one, you should see four vertical bars of almost equal color, rather than eight distinct colors, since it should be blocking most of the blue."

Here they are, with the oldest one on the left, and the newest on the right.  They vary a lot:   http://i.imgur.com/9ztJVxd.jpg  Zoom in and you can see the difference between the outermost two more clearly, though the photo minimizes the difference a bit vs. naked eye.

I wonder if Amazon is doing this to push everyone into the Voyage line or that they just got a really good deal on LEDs that are more blue than the last order they made?   It could just be that the Kindle is considered to be an inexpensive device, so the tolerances on the “white LEDs” are very wide and you may end up with some devices which are more blue or more yellow than the other—similar to the way that iPhone screens used to have a lot more color variance than they do these days—rather than an intentional design change.  Or it may be that since theyʼre using a white LED to light the screen, and itʼs going to have a noticeable blue tint when viewed in a dark room anyway, they selected LEDs which make the screen look whiter when itʼs used during the day.  If they were to use red or amber LEDs rather than white, it would be much better for reading books last thing at night, but wouldnʼt look very good during daylight hours.  Itʼs just that I had hoped this was something that Amazon would address when they updated the device.  An ideal solution would be to have different colored LEDs so that it gets redder at low brightness levels and bluer/whiter at high brightness levels—similar to the latest iteration of those Philips Wake-up Lights. (I have an older model which uses a halogen lamp rather than LEDs)  Whatever the reason, I would probably still buy the new model unless youʼre also looking to save some money. The extra resolution is probably worth it."

It is disappointing that you can't turn the light off, but if you have it at the minimum setting and are using a lamp for reading, it's going to have a negligible impact.  And I actually find the light more beneficial when I'm reading during the day in non-ideal conditions than using it to read in the dark. E.g. trying to read in the shade.  The light eliminates most shadows on the screen and does brighten it up from looking like newsprint to looking like a white sheet of paper. (or anything in-between)  And even if you're not using the light, the screen itself is a bit brighter, higher contrast, and higher resolution than the older Kindles.  Here are some photographs I took when my Paperwhite 2 arrived, which was quite a bright day if I recall correctly:   Kindle Paperwhite (light on) Kindle Paperwhite (light off) Kindle 4 iPad Air   Not that there is anything wrong with your Kindle Keyboard, but I do still prefer my Paperwhite 2 to the old Kindle 4 it replaced.  Having the built-in light means that I'm reading a lot more with the Paperwhite than I ever did with the Kindle 4."

kindle,3a9jf1,lyam23,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:57:16 2015 UTC,I had (and still have) the 1st gen paperwhite as well. The screen is the nicest part of the Voyage. The higher DPI really does make reading a little bit more enjoyable.  I haven't seen any reviews comparing the paperwhite against the voyage yet. I'm unclear what the voyage offers that justifies double the price.  I had to get my first voyage swapped out due to the two tone screen issue and a few shimmering/glitter spots on the screen. I think every voyage screen has the two tone issue to some degree.   Sorry it's not much help to you right now. I guess I'm keeping my voyage seeing as I already have it.

Yeah I toyed around with the Voyage in my local Best Buy and it seemed pretty nice but I actually really like the build quality of my Paperwhite. If I do choose to upgrade I think I'd probably go with the Paperwhite 3 just because the price point.   The only thing the Voyage seems to have over the new Paperwhite would be the physical page turn buttons, the glass screen, and apparently has better contrast. Not sure that warrants the extra $80."

kindle,3a9ve8,bsabiston,3,Thu Jun 18 16:37:19 2015 UTC,They don't want to do that because an e-reader needs to be a comfortable thing to hold. You're supposed to be able to rest your fingers on the bezel so I doubt they'll reduce it more than a few mm
kindle,3a9ve8,alvareo-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:21:49 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's a lot bigger than it needs to be and the screen's always been too small IMO.  If it's light enough it wouldn't be uncomfortable."
kindle,3a9ve8,bsabiston,3,Fri Jun 19 02:43:43 2015 UTC,I could take a few mm but some people have large fingers. The issue isn't lightness but a place to put your finger in without worrying that you'll change the page.  edit: a word
kindle,3a9ve8,alvareo-,2,Fri Jun 19 02:53:02 2015 UTC,"I would think they could find a workaround for that.  Like a Surface knows not to read the base of your hand when you are resting it on the glass and writing.  It could maybe detect that there are fingers on the front and back at the same time and figure out that you are holding it.  Or maybe just have the bezel thicker on one side, and you can turn it so that is on whichever side you hold it."
kindle,3a9ve8,bsabiston,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:19:29 2015 UTC,"a larger screen'd be fine, reducing the bezel yeah. i wish the screen didn't have da gap.  if you reduce the bezel without reducing the screen size, you'd have a smaller device.  paperbacks have another advantage: i find them easier to hold. The Kindle without a cover is rather uncomfortable.  every time i swipe to the next page, i sadly miss a physical button.  i don't wanna afford the $200 of the Voyage."

kindle,3a9ve8,alvareo-,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:22:58 2015 UTC,"Some people say the higher resolution of the voyage over the pw2 is worth the difference.  What's the say people wouldn't say the same if the voyage2 had 400 dpi.  And again when the voyage 3 has 500dpi.  I'll admit I've not see the voyage in person but there's no difference visible to me in photos i've seen online. Perhaps if someone took nice macro shots of the voyage vs pw and original kindle using high quality jpegs it would be clearer. But it reminds me of similar ""improvements"" in the displays over smartphones and tablets.  Resolution gets to a certain point and after that you're just wasting memory and cpu power handling the extra pixels."

kindle,3a9ve8,PAY_CLOSE_ATTENTION,2,Sat Jun 20 16:34:27 2015 UTC,"this seems like a reasonable assumption.  Not just because of the new PW, but because of the delayed launch of the voyage in other countries.  It wouldn't make sense to launch a voyage 2 just months after the voyage 1 ""launched"" in some countries"
kindle,3aaaqq,jack-dawed,9,Thu Jun 18 13:59:02 2015 UTC,"If you can get a free replacement, I'd definitely go for it.  The battery life will be slightly worse due to the higher resolution screen, but the battery life is so long on my Paperwhite 2 that a reduction from “8 weeks” to “6 weeks” is unlikely to be an issue.  Though itʼs nice that I rarely ever have to think about charging my Kindle, I think most people are used to charging one or two devices on a daily basis now anyway, so remembering to charge your Kindle once a month (to prevent it from running down to 0) doesnʼt seem like a problem."

Does that mean I can just buy the with special offers one, and not have to pay $20 twice?"
kindle,3aaaqq,Gimasag3,2,Thu Jun 18 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, I bought a PW for 119+tax, and then removed the ads later at 20+tax.   Amazon refunded me the 20+tax, and will refund me for the Kindle as soon as it ships back to them.  So yes, you can buy the one with ads and just pay the 20 to remove ads later if you choose.    (If you weren't aware, this is always an option, you can buy any Kindle with ads and then pay the 20 to remove them later.  I did this with the PW because I wasn't sure whether or not the Special Offers would be obtrusive enough to spend the 20 to get rid of them, and I found that they were bugging me to buy stuff more than I wanted to, so I got rid of them)"

You can download movies from Amazon Prime, download them to the HD for later viewing, watch on Netflix or use other apps to watch movies. Listen to music, play games, etc. Lots  you can do. I'm not sure what the max HD size is for the 7"" could be 64G too, but it could be well worth it. 16G is NOT enough. I had the Fire HD 16G and with the OS I couldn't put much on it."

kindle,3a5u7y,Downing_Street_Cat,17,Wed Jun 17 13:53:39 2015 UTC,"From a quick scan of the specs it's the Paperwhite Pro rather than Voyage Lite - it's slightly chunkier, charges slower, without PagePress and non-adaptive light.   It's a fantastic price for people who feel like the last two features are non-essential.  edit: clarified."
kindle,3a5u7y,Raithstone,6,Wed Jun 17 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"I recently bought the Voyage, but I find I never use the page turn buttons and the adaptive light is more annoying than helpful. I don't regret my purchase, but I wish I had waited a little longer!"

kindle,3a5u7y,HalKitzmiller,9,Wed Jun 17 17:15:20 2015 UTC,"I moved from the PW1 to the Voyage. Here's my upgrade progress: Kindle Keyboard -> Kindle Touch -> Kindle Paperwhite -> Voyage.  The biggest upgrade by far was from the Touch to the Paperwhite; the PW is better in every single way, with the light being the most significant.   The PW1 to Voyage was nice mostly for the smaller form factor and higher resolution screen. The buttons are poorly placed for me to press them so that was a disappointment. I don't use the light auto-adjustment at all since I keep mine on one setting and that works fine for my uses, so that is a useless feature for me as well."

I mainly read around bedtime, so it's nice that when I turn off the bedroom light it dims so it doesn't burn out my retinas. My only other complaint is the power button being on the back, which makes some cases unusable.  And our upgrade paths are nearly the same, except I went Kindle 2 -> Kindle Touch -> Kindle Paperwhite -> Kindle Voyage."

The screen is noticeably better, but to me the bigger factors are the side buttons and the screen being flush.  Though the DPI is the same the Voyage has a higher contrast and can get brighter - but again I think the flush screen is a bigger factor than either of those.  If you have to save for a kindle don't worry about it.  If you have enough money that an unexpected $200 expense doesn't keep you up at night get the Voyage."

kindle,3a5u7y,alvareo-,5,Wed Jun 17 19:10:10 2015 UTC,"Justification means the space between words are adjusted per-line so that the end of the last word on each line lines up. If you're in a large font size and/or there's a long word that gets pushed to the next line, then the words on that line will be spaced far apart and it looks weird and distracting. In print, this is avoided by splitting words and hyphen-  ating them, like that. Kindles have never done this before now."

kindle,3a5u7y,alvareo-,2,Wed Jun 17 19:35:14 2015 UTC,"Good explanation. Just a tip though; if you press space twice before hitting return, you can create a new line without extra spacing: Like this,  as opposed to this."

kindle,3a5u7y,HackSawJimDuggan69,7,Thu Jun 18 03:25:49 2015 UTC,"It's always been annoying how Amazon is intentionally vague about how much storage the device has. Even for the Paperwhite 2 they still say ""holds over 1,000 books"" which is a very misleading metric, since books vary in size, especially since the system files take up some amount of space as well. Sure, for the average person that might make more sense than ""x GB"", but they could still put the actual size up somewhere.  I imagine they're worried that the average person will see e.g. ""2 GB"" and they'll compare that to something like phones which do require more space and assume therefore that the e-reader has very little space? Like I said, that could be remedied by saying something like ""2 GB (About 1,000 books)"" or whatever.  I read a lot of big technical books and I can barely fit over 100 of them on my Paperwhite 2 with 2 GB. It's not that I'm complaining about how many I can fit, I'm obviously not reading them all simultaneously but I do use them frequently for reference, but that shouldn't matter. The point is that it's very misleading and vague. The more recent PW 2's ship with 4 GB AFAIK but there's no way to know that from the page, last I saw, I only found out because my friend received his with 4 GB and I found other people on mobileread that encountered the same thing.  I hope that this latest PW has at least 4 GB as well."
kindle,3a5u7y,strollertoaster,3,Wed Jun 17 21:28:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. One of the first things I tried to look for on the product page was the amount of storage, as they had upgraded the PW2 to 4gig last fall, and I wanted to make sure that stayed the same. I'm assuming since it says the exact same as the voyage in the comparison it's 4gb, but that's still total crap.   In the end, it's 3 months until Sept when the new models will most likely come out. I'll just wait until then so that I can choose from all the options available."
kindle,3a5u7y,AudibleKnight,2,Wed Jun 17 23:23:04 2015 UTC,"They are vague because they don't want to give too much information for fear of confusing their target market, but someone always takes it apart to find out the storage.

Has the Origami case as an option  completely flat surface across the top (instead of a recessed screen that collected dust)   The Paperwhite screen resolution upgrade is a big deal and I'm glad to see it.  I wish they released an Origami case for it as well (I find it's great to read while eating).

kindle,3a5u7y,BetaSoul,2,Wed Jun 17 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"Good to know, because every now and then, even though I'm pretty satisfied, I wonder if I'm missing out by only having Kindles. Guess I'm not."
kindle,3a5u7y,alvareo-,3,Wed Jun 17 21:25:00 2015 UTC,"I bought the PW2 two day ago and I am from Brazil where the new kindle will be available on July. Is it worth return the one I have and buy the new one? Also, I would have to pay more 48 US dollars and wait for a month."
kindle,3a5u7y,pedrolmota,2,Wed Jun 17 17:17:32 2015 UTC,I would return it and get the pw3 honestly. But that's up to you.
kindle,3a5u7y,brianlgib,3,Thu Jun 18 14:53:16 2015 UTC,"Oh you've got to be kidding me. I just bought a Voyage last week, and using an Amazon credit for part of the cost (which is not refunded on returns AFAIK).  I feel like I just got Apple'd."
kindle,3a5u7y,BillyBuckets,6,Wed Jun 17 21:35:04 2015 UTC,"i feel like amazon waits until i buy a kindle to announce a new one. bought a kindle touch, barely one month later they announce the kindle paperwhite. bought the voyage 2 weeks ago, they announce paperwhite 3."
kindle,3a5u7y,mynameisvlad,4,Wed Jun 17 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"Contact their CS, I'm sure they'll be able to sort you out, even if their usual policy is not to refund the Amazon credit. Amazon CS regularly provides exceptions to their official policies on a case-by-case basis."
kindle,3a5u7y,163941,3,Wed Jun 17 22:36:55 2015 UTC,"Oh you've got to be kidding me. I just bought a Voyage last week, and using an Amazon credit for part of the cost (which is not refunded on returns AFAIK).   The Voyage is still a higher-spec model than the Paperwhite 3.  This is the Voyage without the ambient light sensor, flush glass display, magnesium body, or PagePress buttons.   I feel like I just got Apple'd.   With the exception of the iPad 4, Apple generally updates their devices on a fairly consistent and predictable schedule.  Their computers are maybe a bit more variable, but that is generally them waiting for new parts from Intel. (which are also on a fairly widely-known schedule)"
kindle,3a5u7y,DocPenguin01,3,Thu Jun 18 14:09:45 2015 UTC,"I've been checking out the Voyage at Best Buy for a while now, and love the screen. I just can't justify the cost of not only the extra $80 for the Voyage, but the cost of a new case too.  The PW3 is exactly what I wanted. High-res screen and it fits in the same case as my PW2. Big win. Off to go pre-order."
kindle,3a5u7y,justinmega1,2,Thu Jun 18 00:19:44 2015 UTC,"Same here, a smaller construction plus weight is nice, but for almost one hundred more? No thanks."
kindle,3a5u7y,MeltedUFO,2,Fri Jun 19 08:12:07 2015 UTC,"If I bought a paperwhite at the end of May, there is no way I can get it updated to the new higher dpi one for free or anything is there?"
kindle,3a5u7y,12INCHVOICES,2,Wed Jun 17 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"You might still be within the 30 day return window depending on the date you purchased, but you'll probably be without a Kindle for a couple of weeks while you wait for the new one to be released."
kindle,3a5u7y,HalKitzmiller,2,Thu Jun 18 04:23:14 2015 UTC,What has everyone else done in the past for trade-ins or upgrades? Does Amazon usually offer incentives to upgrade?  I've bought 3 diff Kindles over the years but they have all been flt out purchases rather than trade ins or anything. This time though I want to upgrade only if I can do something with this PW1 I have.
kindle,3a5u7y,raytian,6,Wed Jun 17 17:30:10 2015 UTC,I also wish there was some sort of trade-in program for discounts. I know some people would appreciate buying used ones or something of that nature.
kindle,3a5u7y,huntmol,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"I was just looking around for this. Many items on Amazon have a ""Sell yours"" button, but I don't see one for the Kindle Paperwhite. A trade-in program would be great."
kindle,3a5u7y,mbirth,3,Wed Jun 17 22:18:07 2015 UTC,"I think there's only trade-in for older models.  Kindle Paperwhite 6"" WiFi (old gen) can be sold for ""up to $26.25"".  Kindle Keyboard for ""up to $3.00""."
kindle,3a5u7y,VioletArrows,6,Wed Jun 17 23:23:28 2015 UTC,"Three whole dollars for my Keyboard?! Gee thanks, Amazon!   *will probably have her Kindle until not even a battery swap will save it*"
kindle,3a5u7y,Dro-,2,Thu Jun 18 06:56:04 2015 UTC,"Beautiful! I was just about to buy a kindle yesterday!   I'm def set on this new paperwhite, anyone heard of any possible Fathers day deals this weekend? Or is it safe to assume there won't be any discount/gift because it's a new device & I should just buy it now?"
kindle,3a5u7y,no_4,2,Wed Jun 17 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"So, the only difference is higher resolution, and the software (that'll presumably be back ported), yes?"
kindle,3a5u7y,muso2005,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:49:11 2015 UTC,"There's also the automatic light adjustment, and if it's like the voyage, there'll be a slight improvement in the range of light available, and I would guess slightly better contrast."
kindle,3a5u7y,no_4,2,Thu Jun 18 06:30:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I don't see anything about automatic light adjustment though.  In the table it has that listed for the Voyage only, right...?"
kindle,3a5u7y,muso2005,-1,Thu Jun 18 07:32:37 2015 UTC,"I'm only looking on my mobile, but to me it looks like it's listed under the new features:  # New, higher resolution display (300 ppi)--now with twice as many pixels  # Now with Bookerly, our exclusive font, hand-crafted from the ground up for faster reading with less eyestrain  # Built-in adjustable light--read day and nightUnlike tablets, no screen glare, even in bright sunlight  ..."
kindle,3a5u7y,lyam23,4,Thu Jun 18 08:10:25 2015 UTC,I read that as manually adjustable.  Usually they refer to an ambient light sensor if it's automatic.
kindle,3a5u7y,muso2005,2,Thu Jun 18 12:20:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, I guess I was mistaken. Thanks for the correction. If it's any consolation, I have the Voyage, and still usually need to manually adjust it anyway."
kindle,3a5u7y,lyam23,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:29:09 2015 UTC,"Me too.  The ambient light sensor is not really a selling point for me.  It sucks on my phone, I expect it to suck on my ereader.  It's easy enough to just manually adjust it."
kindle,3a5u7y,jxstxn,2,Thu Jun 18 14:20:37 2015 UTC,"Another minor ""feature"" is that Kindle logo is now in black instead of silver.. that's nice.. the silver I thought was distracting."
kindle,3a5u7y,cheshire137,2,Thu Jun 18 02:42:23 2015 UTC,Am I going to get Bookerly for the Kîndle Paperwhite I bought just last month?
kindle,3a5u7y,jack-dawed,2,Thu Jun 18 03:12:20 2015 UTC,"I'd love to know this as well, I bought mine 2 weeks ago. I want to know the history of updates for previous Kindle models."
kindle,3a5u7y,awakeningosiris,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:06:47 2015 UTC,"Glad theres more people in this club - purchased May 7th,.. definitely not the news I want to hear."
kindle,3a5u7y,TidalSky,2,Fri Jun 19 02:40:03 2015 UTC,"Literally got my Paperwhite 2 weeks ago and couldn't be happier. Are the only differences the DPI and the new font, or are there more?"
kindle,3a5u7y,Dragonsfiery,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:56:13 2015 UTC,"Not really, the design is a little different with this newer one being more gray. I got my Paperwhite 2, fairly recently and I'm returning it to get the newer one."
kindle,3a5u7y,crazyg0od33,2,Tue Jun 23 17:44:03 2015 UTC,I'm going to assume all of them get the new software update the day this releases or very very shortly afterward
kindle,3a5u7y,kernco,3,Wed Jun 17 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"Historically, it's been months after a new Kindle gets released that previous models receive software updates."
kindle,3a5u7y,crazyg0od33,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:12:41 2015 UTC,I'd have to think they wouldn't wait that long - at least for the voyage. But I guess we'll see soon...
kindle,3a5u7y,mynameisvlad,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:13:39 2015 UTC,"Why? I could see for Voyage since it's a premium product, but the reason they take forever to release updates is so they drive sales of the new model. People aren't going to want to upgrade if they can get most of the new features from a software update available immediately after launch."
kindle,3a5u7y,crazyg0od33,2,Wed Jun 17 22:35:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I have a voyage, so I'd hope it's coming very soon after if not the day of.  I just didn't wanna come off as a dick for not caring if the people on older kindles got it soon haha.  For me at least, the hardware is the selling point of THIS specific new model, not the software, but I see your point"
kindle,3a5u7y,lyam23,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:37:04 2015 UTC,But the voyage is still the new model in that tier.
kindle,3a5u7y,Outsideerr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:27:30 2015 UTC,"Wowzers, thanks for posting this. I've been stuck between the PW2 and Glo HD for a few weeks now and was just about to the pull the plug on the Kobo. Will definitely have to wait and see how this is!"
kindle,3a5u7y,UltrasaurusRex,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:57:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting this. The paperwhite needed an update because its last release was in September 2013.   Hope you don't mind I cross-posted it to /r/gadgets.
kindle,3a5u7y,pedrolmota,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:29:53 2015 UTC,It's that I bought the PW2 cheaper than its list price
kindle,3a5u7y,SubhasTheJanitor,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:25:02 2015 UTC,"UGH! I just received the Paperwhite as a gift about three weeks ago. I suppose I could get a refund and buy the ""All-new"" one. But to be honest, I've been using my Kindle every day since I got it. I don't think I could stand to wait just for a better display and font. Still, always a nice feeling to have the latest and greatest."
kindle,3a5u7y,ruffykunn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:55:52 2015 UTC,"About fucking time they improved the previously atrocious typography on their Kindle devices. Kudos to finally catching up to the competition! I had already resigned myself to them just keeping on ignoring customer needs like they had for eight years (I'm sure they could have implemented this years ago if they had actually given a fuck about what we customers want) ...  Now if only they allowed me to configure the font sizes to choose from or just jailbreak the Paperwhite like I can do with my trusty old Kindle Touch (I still love reading on it and am proud of all the scratch marks that show how much I've had it in my hands). Until they do, I'm afraid for my first frontlit ereader I'll just get a Kobo or a Touch Lux, where users are actually allowed to control the devices they paid for (and typography has been decent for years).  Good riddance :P."
kindle,3a5u7y,bsabiston,-2,Thu Jun 18 08:59:31 2015 UTC,Man who would buy a Voyage after this.  I have one and never use those stupid fake buttons.
kindle,3a5u7y,ScubaSteve1219,6,Wed Jun 17 14:22:17 2015 UTC,"somebody who wants a sleeker device that's much lighter and has the page-press buttons, like me. i'll happily stick with my Voyage."
kindle,3a5u7y,bsabiston,3,Wed Jun 17 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"That's true, it is a lot lighter.  I wouldn't go back -- but if I was buying a new one, it would be a tough decision.  That 300  dpi screen was the main reason I switched."
kindle,3a5u7y,pedrolmota,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:38:46 2015 UTC,Does the 300 dpi make that much of a difference?
kindle,3a5u7y,bsabiston,3,Wed Jun 17 18:01:33 2015 UTC,It makes a difference -- I'd say look at one in the store to compare.  To some people it might not be all that noticeable.  300 dpi has always been the magic number for me because I think of that as the same resolution as ink on paper.
kindle,3a5u7y,pedrolmota,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:46:17 2015 UTC,hmm I see.. but is it worth returning my two days old PW2 and paying 50 dollars more for the new one?
kindle,3a5u7y,bsabiston,3,Wed Jun 17 19:18:14 2015 UTC,I thought the new one was the same price as the old one.
kindle,3a5u7y,alvareo-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:34:07 2015 UTC,"Much lighter? Man, the PW2 is already really light, I can't imagine lighter"
kindle,3a5u7y,ScubaSteve1219,2,Wed Jun 17 17:41:35 2015 UTC,"try holding a Voyage, then. it's noticeably lighter and i prefer it so much, personally."
kindle,3a5u7y,alvareo-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:43:56 2015 UTC,"I'm really curious about it, I'd love to. I want to see how it is in person but I doubt I will in a long while."
kindle,3a5u7y,ScubaSteve1219,2,Wed Jun 17 18:38:48 2015 UTC,"as often as i say it on this sub there really is a huge difference between the PW and Voyage, in both physical appearance and software. I mean this new PW closes the gap but the thing is still almost clunky in comparison to the Voyage. you just have to compare them yourself to understand what i mean."
kindle,3a5u7y,alvareo-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:48:20 2015 UTC,I really hope I come across one someday. I can't afford that much for a kindle but it'd still be nice to. At the moment I only know a couple people with kindles and they're both PWs.
kindle,3a5u7y,Learnincurve,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, I said before that I have used a PW since release  and the moment I picked up the voyage I immediately noticed a difference with contrast, text clarity, page turn speed, lighting, and the texture of the screen.  It was a hard call between the voyage and the new updated PW but in the end ""fuck it"" I'm using this thing for 6 hours or more a day I am treating myself to the nice one."
kindle,3a5u7y,alvareo-,0,Wed Jun 17 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"Also, I forgot to say but I think the Voyage is really ugly so there's that."
kindle,3a5u7y,ScubaSteve1219,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:50:06 2015 UTC,in what way do you feel it's ugly? there isn't exactly anything flashy to an e-reader like the Kindle.
kindle,3a5u7y,alvareo-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:54:08 2015 UTC,"I hate the weird design on the back and the placement of the power button. That's exactly my issue, I think it's very flashy. I love the Kindles' design exactly because of how simple its design is."
kindle,3a5u7y,ScubaSteve1219,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:02:02 2015 UTC,i forgot about the back since my Voyage has been in an amazing case almost since i got it. i guess that's a solution right there.
kindle,3a5u7y,GiantTortoise,13,Wed Jun 17 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"I personally love the fake buttons, use them all the time."
kindle,3a5u7y,irishtexmex,9,Wed Jun 17 14:48:23 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear!  Having the choice to use them or not use them is unequivocally better than just not having them at all (all other things being equal).  That being said, I know the price isn't equal and despite that I wanted them enough to have paid extra for the feature."
kindle,3a5u7y,bsabiston,3,Wed Jun 17 15:28:02 2015 UTC,"I just find the electronic buttons to be a weird compromise between actual buttons and no buttons.  If I'm at the gym and try to press one, it's just not as nice as a real moving part. Of course those could break but my old one with buttons never did. It's hardly any different from tapping the screen.  You get feedback, but you get that anyway when the page turns!"
kindle,3a5u7y,GiantTortoise,3,Wed Jun 17 16:41:24 2015 UTC,"It's actually really nice to be able to hold the bezel and then press down on it to trigger a button press. No need to even move thumb. Ultimate laziness, I guess, but to me it works great."
kindle,3a5u7y,irishtexmex,3,Wed Jun 17 16:46:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. You must have had one of the original Kindles with page-turning buttons that were clicky?  I came from Nook (both the OG and the Simple Touch) and the buttons were more of a ""soft touch/depressed-area"" than a ""chiclet laptop key""-type. The Voyage's page-press area compares pretty similarly to those.  Essentially, it's nice to be able to turn pages without having to move my hand at all. I know not everyone cares about that, but I find one-handed operation of my Kindle terrrible if I turn off Page-press and try to use it like a Paperwhite.  As with everything, to each their own!"
kindle,3a5u7y,Raithstone,5,Wed Jun 17 17:02:01 2015 UTC,"For people who read at night the adaptive light is also a nice feature (in the Voyage). I agree with the comment who you're replying to though, to most these two features will be non-essentials."
kindle,3a5u7y,Learnincurve,2,Wed Jun 17 14:52:58 2015 UTC,"Me, I bought one today, I was waiting for the announcement on what the new PW would have and decided against it.   I read 6+ hours a day and have been doing on the paperwhite 1 with a off colour screen since release week.  I have literally no storage space left and the touch screen is in pain because of all the swiping. Used my mother's voyage and found that the buttons and adaptive light would be worth it for me as a heavy user.   If they update the voyage or drop the price on it any time soon I'll bitch at amazon and get some money back."
kindle,3a5u7y,TyranShadow,2,Wed Jun 17 15:14:56 2015 UTC,I have literally no storage space left   How is this an issue? You can't possibly be reading so many books simultaneously that they are taking up all the space on your Kindle.
kindle,3a5u7y,Learnincurve,2,Wed Jun 17 16:28:51 2015 UTC,"One of the benefits of the kindles are that they can replace a library, it's especially useful with academic texts.  Another problem, as I said before is that this was a kindle PW 1 with 2gb of storage and the software updates ate a huge chunk of that.   I could have gone for the new PW which has 4gb of space, same as the voyage, but I decided that as I am using an existing padded sleeve and not buying a new expensive cover that I would treat myself to the nicer one for an extra £50"
kindle,3a5u7y,bsabiston,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"What do you mean you have no storage space?  Just remove some old books, you can always put them back on????  Also, I hope they've fixed it, but the off-color problem is worse on my Voyage than it ever was on my PW.  But I got an early version."
kindle,3a5u7y,Learnincurve,2,Wed Jun 17 16:32:29 2015 UTC,"You would be surprised at how fast it can fill, especially with academic texts.  I have the first paperwhite that only has 2gb of storage, as the software has been  updated it ate everything up."
kindle,3a5u7y,alvareo-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:39:06 2015 UTC,Off-colour how?
kindle,3a5u7y,Learnincurve,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"Splotchy shadows and odd stains across the screen, I sent back two and they were all the same so I just went with it in the end. From the reviews  if you got remotely even lighting you were lucky. They fixed it aside from the shadows at the bottom with the PW 2 also the newer PW 2s have 4gb of storage instead of 2gb. I checked mine and it has 900mb of usable space with the updated software."
kindle,3a5u7y,alvareo-,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:58:19 2015 UTC,"oh yeah, I got a PW for my aunt and her lighting was uneven while mine wasn't. It's better on the PW2. For what it's worth, if what they're saying is to be believed, the lighting technology was pretty unique so I'll grant it being uneven on its first iteration."
kindle,3a5u7y,Learnincurve,2,Wed Jun 17 22:15:00 2015 UTC,"""It's the price you pay for being an early adopter""  was what got slung around at the time. I'm glad I got it, don't get me wrong but this time I'm not going to accept a copy without perfect lighting as I know they exist, latest uk reviews on amazon for the voyage  make no mention of it so hopefully this batch will be fine."
kindle,3a5u7y,lyam23,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:52:55 2015 UTC,The Voyage is awesome.  I bought one over the PW and I'd do it again over the new PW.
kindle,3a5u7y,Wrecksomething,0,Thu Jun 18 12:21:36 2015 UTC,"Planning on buying a new Kindle later this year and gifting my PW2. Since I wanted 300ppi and pageturn buttons, this makes my decision harder! Page turn alone might not be worth the extra bucks for me.   After trying the new screen though it is hard to live with 167 ppi."
kindle,3a5u7y,Raithstone,2,Wed Jun 17 15:23:34 2015 UTC,"Do you read at night? Do you like having your screen flush with the bezel? If it's no to one (or both) of those questions, buy the new Paperwhite."
kindle,3a5u7y,PedoBear_Grylls,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:32:22 2015 UTC,I read at night on my pw2 all the time
kindle,3a5u7y,Raithstone,2,Wed Jun 17 15:35:50 2015 UTC,"Adaptive light is a nice feature to have on the Voyage if you read at night - not essential but that's beside the point - that's why I was asking those two questions. If /u/Wrecksomething wants to upgrade the adaptive light, screen flush with the bezel and PagePress are the only real feature differences between the new Paperwhite and the Voyage. I simplified them down into easy-to-answer questions to make the choice easier."
kindle,3a5u7y,justinmega1,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:39:07 2015 UTC,"I read that the adaptive light feature isn't all that great, what are your thoughts on it?"
kindle,3a5u7y,frmorrison,2,Fri Jun 19 08:13:04 2015 UTC,212 PPI is the resolution on the old Paperwhite.
kindle,3a5u7y,Aliandren,0,Fri Jun 19 05:24:54 2015 UTC,Is the screen still easily scratched plastic?  I'm using pw1 and would like a more durable screen on my next upgrade.  I am worried about outdoor glare on that voyage glass screen though.  Hmm..
kindle,3a5u7y,163941,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:49:23 2015 UTC,I am worried about outdoor glare on that voyage glass screen though. Hmm..   I'm sure that people will do outdoor comparisons between the Paperwhite 3 and the Voyage once they start shipping.  There's no need to order one right away. Wait and see.
kindle,3a5u7y,kevin0125,0,Thu Jun 18 14:11:06 2015 UTC,"Hmm...  The biggest problem right now, to me, is the new typography setting. I actually liked the old typography - reading at size 3 doesn't make justification looks that bad, but the old one with the ligature and hyphenation might make it hard to read. Hopefully there may be some way to disable it."
kindle,3a5u7y,jal0001,0,Wed Jun 17 17:54:53 2015 UTC,I wonder if it will have the same screen as the Voyage. I actually like the PPW2 screen better. The matte finish gives the screen nice feedback.
kindle,3a83oi,awex14,3,Wed Jun 17 23:38:52 2015 UTC,"People have different wants, I LOATH uneven lines, its disgusting. I doesn't like hyphenated words all that much, but its the lesser evil."
kindle,3a83oi,far_shooter,2,Thu Jun 18 14:44:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same here. I prefer entire words, and I'd never even noticed the uneven lines.  edit: this article explains the good things about this"
kindle,3a83oi,alvareo-,2,Thu Jun 18 23:24:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I find hyphenation to be very uncomfortable to read.  It slows me down, and I see no reason for it to exist on an e-reader unless you are displaying multiple columns of justified text side-by-side.  I just want left-aligned text and an option to load custom fonts onto the Kindle itself rather than having to run all of my purchases through Calibre to apply this formatting before I can read them.  I also dislike the way that Amazon are handling this by reformatting the books server-side, instead of adding more options to the Kindle itself.  My old Kindle before the Paperwhite had no problem letting me adjust the formatting of the book or loading custom fonts, so I cannot understand why Amazon have removed these options from newer, more powerful devices."
kindle,3a83oi,163941,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:55:53 2015 UTC,I hate it too. People are using various sizes of type now; it is very distracting when it changes the layout of the rest of the page.

kindle,3a83oi,alvareo-,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:11:37 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I am misunderstanding. I am talking about words split with a hypen to preserve line justification  I read a lot of non fiction and self published books, mostly memoirs. I always assumed the hyphens were in the original layout of the books and got imported. Wherever it occurs, it causes a line break.  Tomorrow I will see if I can find an example an take a photo."

kindle,3aaveg,MrBobandy,2,Thu Jun 18 17:47:07 2015 UTC,I want to get some movies to watch on the plane.    Okay...   I think netflix is streaming only.   Correct.   I am reading about playlater.   Never heard of it. Quick look has me seriously questioning how legal it is. It must violate some part of your ToS to record. Another quick look confirms that it's pretty clearly in violation of the service agreements for most online streaming services.   It seems like i had to record all the movies in real time though.   That tends to be how it goes when making illegal video rips of streaming content. No way to go faster than 1:1 when you're dealing with an analog signal at any point in the process.   Is there a better solution?   There is. It's called BitTorrent.
kindle,3aaveg,NonaSuomi282,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:50:13 2015 UTC,There is. It's called BitTorrent.   Pretty much. Why go through a hassle of recording things via workarounds when you can download them?

The fact that you're paying them or that they haven't been sued into the ground yet doesn't change the fact that their business model is illegitimate if not outright illegal. If you're already not using ""legit"" services, why bother?"

It will only help the market, get rid of all the garbage from authors trying to game the system."
kindle,3a6gqp,wtfpwnedomglol,7,Wed Jun 17 17:06:41 2015 UTC,This is such a refreshing change. The amount of pure garbage self publishing has created just to make money is unbelievable and makes the good works so much harder to find.
kindle,3a6gqp,WorldOfInfinite,-2,Wed Jun 17 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"Another kindle publisher here:   How can you be so callous about a huge change we know nothing about. I'm a fucking human being, and completely restructuring the way I get paid with less than 15 days notice is fucked up.  This may be good for readers -- but the fact that Amazon is doing this the way they are shows they have 0 respect for authors, and that is going to end up hurting the readers in the long run.   Right now they are basically telling us: we're going to be paying you by the page now, and we'll tell you how much a page is worth August 15.   I have to wait 45 days just to figure out if I can pay my rent.   It's fucked.   You seem confident about getting rid of ""garbage authors"" but what about genuine short story authors? Children's authors? Poets? What about the people who are making a living right now off their epic fantasy, but will soon be broke upon the realization that no one actually finishes their books.   The policy may be fine -- but how they are going about it is fucked.   People are going to be evicted from their apartments because Amazon can't be arsed to tell us how they're fucking us to our faces."
kindle,3a6gqp,Duffalpha,3,Thu Jun 18 00:33:55 2015 UTC,"It means that if someone reads a little of your book but stops after a few pages, you're more likely to get paid. It also means that someone writing a 20 page short story won't earn the same amount as someone who writes 1000 page tomes.   I completely understand your frustration over the way that this is being implemented, and absolutely agree with you that they need to be clearer about price per page, but would more than 15 days notice of the change have made a difference?"
kindle,3a6gqp,Inanna26,-2,Fri Jun 19 15:44:46 2015 UTC,"To me it would! I write today what I'll be paid for in 60 days. So if I had 60 days notice, I could at least have written longer works.

kindle,3a6gqp,thelawtalkingguy,4,Wed Jun 17 19:00:16 2015 UTC,"This is where I think the change will have a good impact.  If publishers are still cranking out pure garbage, you should be able to tell right away before wasting much time, usually within the first page or two.  just quit reading and return it.  Eventually the ""authors"" who are trying to game the system will either put out better work, or quit publishing.  either way its a win-win."

Not 100% verified as the reps at KDP support are VERY tight lipped about how things operate behind the scene, but it has some traction as to be most likely the case.  edit We (publishers) are not sure at this point how fast is ""too fast"" as far as crediting for each page read, it will be a couple months down the road before we can come to some sort of conclusion."

Sounds like your device didn't have enough space to deal with the upgrade which the kindle should have warned you about.  Which country are you in? In the EU for example you have more than 12 months support.   Have you tried connecting it to a PC and seeing if at any point it registers a connection?

kindle,3a5069,splatterhead,2,Wed Jun 17 21:27:02 2015 UTC,As far as I know jailbreaking is impossible on newer software updates and the PW2 at all so screensaver hacks are impossible. I'm not 100% sure about it though and I'd love to be proven wrong. The ability to set the last-opened book's cover as the screensaver was great and honestly should come as an option.

kindle,3a5069,TheOutrageousTaric,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:34:48 2015 UTC,Screen savers are not really worth the effort in my opinion.  You're Kindle is never going to be on the same image long enough to require a method to avoid screen burn-in.  The whole point of the Paperwhite E-Ink system is that it doesn't use energy until you change the configuration (minus the optional back light).  Why care what it looks like when you are not looking at it?
kindle,3a5069,alvareo-,2,Wed Jun 17 07:57:12 2015 UTC,"Just as a nicety, possibly a conversation starter or gentle reminder to pick back up the current book i'm going through. Also the satisfaction of having control are a few reasons I could see wanting to mod it. The images already haven't been bad or anything it'd just be cool to look at a dali painting instead of whatever stock image they put on there.  I wasn't worried about screen burn-in, but that's a good thing to keep in mind however unlikely. And I wasn't worried as much about the battery life, the advertised amount is plenty.   Do you happen to know if the current methods are effective just time consuming initial modification?"

If I remember right the warranty is like 1 year so I don't think it would be a problem.  Seems like the error is in the USB connection. The screen flickers means it can connect to the PC, but lost the connection right away.  It could be the PC's USB port's fault, or the cable's fault.   If changing the cable or PC doesn't help, then it could be firmware fault - Resetting the Kindle resolve that.  If all of them won't work, consider contacting Amazon - the USB port may have been damaged. Although it's unlikely, considering you could still transfer files and connect to the PC after you reboot it.  Kindle'll take a while to index and display the book(s), and maybe the ""slower"" thing is just your imagination - It could happen if the device is overheated.

kindle,39dxxd,Mr_RD,13,Thu Jun 11 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"I can only speak to #1. Buying an eReader over a tablet is worth every cent. Battery, weight, size, and screen are all better. You won't regret it."
kindle,39dxxd,BillyBillBlack,4,Thu Jun 11 03:54:21 2015 UTC,"1)  As a  reading device, the Kindle is far superior to an iPad in both size and readability.  I do use my iPad for technical reading, anything with illustrations.  2)  For me, the advantage of the Voyage over a Paperwhite (I have both) is the inclusion of the press to turn function in the Voyage.  I'm a long time 2nd Gen Kindle user and the pressing of a button is ingrained in me.  It also makes it easier to read one-handed, without the distraction (to me) of continually poking the screen.  The origami cover is kinda cool, if not pricey.  But I'd be hard pressed to say it's worth the $100 extra.  3)  I doubt there will be major advances in the Voyage, if you wait you might see a price drop or be able to catch a lower cost with refurbished unit when they come on the market."
kindle,39dxxd,unreqistered,3,Thu Jun 11 10:51:59 2015 UTC,I love my voyage.
kindle,39dxxd,Transill,2,Thu Jun 11 12:23:08 2015 UTC,"Short and sweet: My wife gave me a voyage for Christmas and at first I was wary, but I've flown through so many books already. I don't have the screen lighting problem that some people report, so maybe I just got lucky."
kindle,39dxxd,shadowfu,3,Sat Jun 13 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"if you want to read and nothing else, an e-reader is a no brainer if you can afford the Voyage comfortably, then it is also a no-brainer. don't let anybody ever tell you the difference isn't noticeable.  i say wait until late Sep/early Oct and see what happens, but getting a Voyage now won't hurt you."
kindle,39dxxd,ScubaSteve1219,5,Thu Jun 11 16:20:47 2015 UTC,"1) Depend. The main advantage (and also, disadvantage) of iPad over Kindle (or ereader in general) is iPad can do much more things, and faster. I said advantage, is because, for example, you want to search a particular terms you find in the book, it's much easier to use iPad than Kindle. I said disadvantage is because, you read less on iPad (distraction, battery, etc.). Also, if you use iPad for even a short time (15-30 mins), then eye strain is inevitable. I haven't experienced eye strain when reading on Kindle, even after 2 hours.  2) The main advantage of voyage, is the page turn button, though you can live without it. The text is crisper, but you probably won't notice the difference. I'd understand if it's like $30-50 more, but the price difference is just ridiculous.  3) Amazon usually announce their new Kindle in September. The Paperwhite can be said to be the best for the price right now, so you can buy one without much worry. Don't buy Voyage right now - there are complaints about uneven light. They're likely to fix this in the next model."

kindle,39dxxd,ScubaSteve1219,3,Thu Jun 11 16:18:05 2015 UTC,"http://gizmodo.com/just-how-much-better-is-amazons-kindle-voyage-screen-1648951818  All right.  Does the Voyage have the better screen? Yes  Does the Voyage look crisper than the PPW? Yes  Will I notice the difference if I compare them side by side? Maybe.  Does the difference is day and night? It's more than night and later that night.  Will I notice the difference if I use just one of those, under normal circumstance? No.  Does it mean that I can't read at tiny font size on the PPW? Unless you're extremely near-sighted, or blind, then no. If you have normal eyes, you can read at that tiny font size on even the Kindle Basic.  How often am I going to read at that tiny font size? Extremely unlikely.   I'm not saying the Voyage is inferior. I'm just saying that, for the $100 difference, it is not worth it.  Sure, there are $40 difference between the Basic and the PPW, but the built-in light is a huge selling point. I'm using the Basic, and the clip-on light is just... annoying. Dimmed after like 3 hours, and heavy. Uneven light distribution. Hell, I regretted buying the Basic for that point.  But for $100, just for a page turn button - which, many people are fond of - and a little bit better screen? No, thank you. If you have the money, go ahead and buy that Voyage. Me, I'm content with a PPW - until something significantly better appear."
kindle,39dxxd,kevin0125,3,Thu Jun 11 19:41:32 2015 UTC,"i guess i'll contradict myself by saying ""worth it"" is different for everybody, but goddamn can i never go back to a Paperwhite after using the Voyage for more than two seconds."
kindle,39dxxd,ScubaSteve1219,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:13:39 2015 UTC,"Oh no I second that. If I got my hand on the Voyage or the PPW I'd sell my Basic right away. And now I could never go back to the ads version of Kindle... even if it's a little improvement, anyone would use it.  I said ""worth it"" in the sense of buying a Mac compared to buying a normal PC - the price is not worth the performance. If the Voyage 2 has significant improvement, I'd buy it, but for the current one, no..."
kindle,39dxxd,kevin0125,2,Fri Jun 12 02:26:33 2015 UTC,"If your focus is value PW2 is the choice.  However, the Voyage is a premium product and is the choice if you don't mind the additional expense.  It's a very, very well designed product.  Glass and metal, thinner and lighter, and ingeniously designed.  Some have issues with the screen but it doesn't detract from my reading experience.  I don't regret the purchase at all."
kindle,39dxxd,lyam23,2,Thu Jun 11 13:04:07 2015 UTC,"I went with the old-school Kindle with the page movement buttons.  I liked the Paperwhite 2, I have one. But I gave it to my dad. The touch system to move pages isn't bad, but needs some work. The backlight gets weird dim/bright spots if you drop your kindle.  If you need a backlight and like touchscreens, the Paperwhite 2 is fantastic, and definitely worth it. The tablet uses more battery, and may do things that you don't need - Surfing the internet and sending e-mails can be done equally well over a smartphone or laptop."
kindle,39dxxd,GoodAtExplaining,2,Thu Jun 11 11:32:05 2015 UTC,"I can speak over #2  Something some people don't realize is that the voyage is an upgrade with automatic lighting and page turn buttons and not much else. It technically has a ""better screen"" but I personally like the PPW2 screen better. The ppw2 screen has a lower resolution and a matte texture to it that gives it a more physical feel that I prefer."
kindle,39dxxd,jal0001,2,Thu Jun 11 12:50:40 2015 UTC,"Kindle as pure e-reader can't be beat, iPad not even close as far as weight, eye strain or lack or, etc.    As far as PPW vs Voyage, if you've never owned a kindle, you can't go wrong with either model. I prefer the latter but even the original kindle 3G outshines the iPads.  Don't wait, just do it and enjoy..... PS - don't forget amazon has a 30 day NO QUESTIONS asked total refund policy. You could get both and see which one you prefer without any penalty!"
kindle,39dxxd,dtsm888,2,Fri Jun 12 14:21:31 2015 UTC,"1) eReaders are much better than tablets for reading - e-ink screens don't cause eye strain like LCD displays do, and theres no glare if you're out in the sun.   2) I would personally say yes, but it depends on how often you read. The Voyage's screen has a much higher PPI (300 vs 212), and it really shows when you compare the screens. The page turn buttons are also really convenient, not to mention the Voyage's thin form factor. Your best bet is to go to a Best Buy and compare the two yourself.  3) There's no guarantee there will be a new Voyage at the end of the year. To put it in perspective, the Paperwhite hasn't been updated since 2013. eReaders aren't like tablets where there are obvious improvements to be made every year. The Voyage could very well be updated soon, but no one outside Amazon could tell you for sure."
kindle,39fghk,BillyBuckets,5,Thu Jun 11 10:54:06 2015 UTC,The fact that Amazon is offering you anything proves they have amazing customer service. Screens don't crack on their own. I bet we're not getting the whole story here.
kindle,39fghk,Dispersions,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:22:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not complaining about their customer service or the product. If you want the whole story: I baby my electronics. Hard cases, 0 drops. Laptops last me ~4–6 years. My iPad has lasted me 4 and counting. All of my iPhones work fine, even my 1st gen. My kindle is in a book-style hard case. No drops, no stresses or strains.   The screen developed a hairline crack, ~1.5 mm in length, in the corner. I don't know when this happened, but it was working fine until yesterday when the screen wasn't registering touches well. I set it down, in its case, on a chair and hopped in the pool. When I picked it back up, the crack was across the screen. The top of the screen was a dead zone for taps, but the whole screen still displayed text. If I had to guess, I'd say it was a thermal expansion propagation: it was 95 F at the time, and although the kindle was on a shaded surface, the sun was hearing the surface only 10 minutes before.   So there's the whole story, but I'm not sure how that changes my original question (should I try to get a replacement later as suggested by the CS rep or just buy a new one for ~$110)."
kindle,39fghk,Trishlovesdolphins,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:04:51 2015 UTC,"Not the whole story, clearly. Were you doing something restful in the pool like breaststroke, or flailing around with the butterfly stroke? In a perfect storm of you putting a hot kindle in a cold table in the sun plus the shock waves from your swimming it's hardly surprising that the screen cracked."
kindle,39fghk,Trishlovesdolphins,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:11:36 2015 UTC,"I get that you're being sarcastic, but this is all tangential anyway. I have no idea how or when the little crack formed. Could have been 18 months ago for all I know. Clearly something happened at some point and I only noticed it yesterday when the screen wasn't registering touch very well. Heating is my best guess as to why the crack went from tiny to the whole screen. After all, the crack was small when I set it down and large when I picked it back up. Nothing interacted with it between those moments.   I ended up buying a new kindle with the discount he CS guy provided me. This is my first electronic gizmo to fail before 3 years, but I still got good use from it."

It's hardly any ""smarter"" than a piece of paper in that there's no inherent sense or order; it's simply a collection of letters arranged on a page.  There are some solutions that have variable results. One is to just copy/paste your book. You can easily get through many pages a minute. If your book doesn't have special formatting, you can use Regex to replace needless line breaks and get a fairly good text file within an hour.  Acrobat professional has options to export PDFs as other doc types, including plain text, rich text, and Word. From there you can convert to other formats.  Sorry, no good (free) method I know of."

kindle,395y55,elika42,3,Tue Jun 9 16:16:06 2015 UTC,"1) Depends on what you mean by ""upload"". If, in ""upload a doc to your dropbox"", then you can email your personal docs to your kindle. It won't sync with other devices. It will, however, allow you to access the file via cloud tab in your kindle, even if you delete the book from your device. The limit for each docs is 15mb, and you can upload several thousand documents this way.  If, like, ""transfering my docs to the kindle"", then you still can. The file is stored locally in your kindle, and if you delete it, you have to plug the kindle to a computer and transfer it again. There are no limit to each file, around 3Gb total if you use the latest model.   2) Nope. Maybe possible if you jailbreak it, but there are currently no easy way to jailbreak the device (other than prying it open).

kindle,395y55,Bill_565,3,Tue Jun 9 15:10:20 2015 UTC,Nice! It makes sense since Calibre can convert pretty much any book format.
kindle,395y55,jojotoughasnails,2,Tue Jun 9 15:12:26 2015 UTC,Calibre has a cool webserver mode where it can serve up books over port 8080 (by default) and you can stick them on your kindle via the browser. Obscenely fast and convenient!

kindle,391r55,overfloaterx,18,Mon Jun 8 21:41:36 2015 UTC,"Netflix makes it pretty easy to work around the restrictions. Accounts are not country specific, and they make no effort to block VPN's."

Last time I tried to stream while in the UK I have a feeling it was restricted, but that was probably 5 or 6 years ago (and well before Netflix UK appeared) and I haven't had the time/need since. Good to know!"
kindle,391r55,overfloaterx,-2,Tue Jun 9 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"That's not 100% true anymore. They're getting increasing pressure to do something about VPNs from the content providers. Quite a few articles talk about this. There was a ban scare a few months ago, but it turns out it was just a DNS change that was slow to propagate.  I really hope they don't do anything since I'm fairly certain my account is still Canadian even though I live in the US. It'll totally look like I'm faking it to get US content to a system like that. And before you ask, no, there is no way to change countries. Probably because of them not being locked down to one country."

kindle,391r55,PrimoEnzo,-5,Mon Jun 8 22:22:29 2015 UTC,"It's great that you're not asking. I wasn't answering a question. I am just telling you, that is not 100% true anymore. Just because you have the anecdotal evidence of a few Argentinians does not mean that they haven't started looking into banning VPN users or VPN services. Just because it hasn't happened to you or your friends does not mean it won't. As I said before, there are numerous articles from this year alone talking about it.  VPN is and has always been a big known workaround. Content providers are obviously not happy with it existing, especially since they can earn more money with contracts for more regions, so it's in their best interests to stop that as fast as possible. The content providers control the content, so it's in Netflix's best interests to keep them appeased. It's pretty obvious to see where it goes from here."
kindle,391r55,mynameisvlad,3,Mon Jun 8 22:28:12 2015 UTC,"It's kinda impossible right now, and it would kill all the international distributors, but one global market seems to be the only solution to this, or people in south america or like me in Spain will be forced to go to piracy if we want the content. Netflix it's now in Spain, but because of the foreign deals, an spanish account is seeing shit compared to an US account."
kindle,391r55,CarlosCuba,-1,Mon Jun 8 22:38:54 2015 UTC,"It's not ""kinda impossible"" at all. It's actually quite easy. They 100% have the infrastructure to ban users, and network infrastructure which can block connections from certain IPs (which are easy to detect for VPNs, just look at the IPs that have hundreds of users). Netflix obviously doesn't want to do it since it means more money. But if content providers strongarm them enough, they'll have to or else nobody will have the content (because it's ultimately their content, they decide if they want to have it on Netflix at all, and who sees it).  A global region would be fantastic but won't happen anytime soon. Netflix would love to do it, but content providers would charge a lot (worldwide distribution is pricy) and Netflix simply wouldn't be able to afford it. The reason you're seeing shit on your Spanish account is because content providers want to charge exorbitant amounts of money the more countries are added to an agreement (that, and agreements would need to be updated when they get renewed, so that may take some time). If it's too much, not even Netflix will want to pay it."
kindle,391r55,mynameisvlad,3,Mon Jun 8 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"Just because you have the anecdotal evidence of a few Argentinians does not mean that they haven't started looking into banning VPN users or VPN services.    And do you have any evidence? Because the last time I heard this it was when Netflix updated their TOS to say that they have the right to ban you. But the company said it didn't represent a change in policy, just language.   I've never heard of even one person being blocked for getting around geo-restrictions. I must know a hundred people using US Netflix here in Canada. It's pretty clear Netflix isn't interested in stopping it."

If you look at the wikipedia article for House of Cards, for example, you'll see several production companies and then Netflix as the distributor.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_%28U.S._TV_series%29  Production company(s)   Media Rights Capital  Trigger Street Productions  Wade/Thomas Productions  Knight Takes King Productions[1]  Distributor Netflix     Compare that to Amazon's Transparent.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_%28TV_series%29  Production company(s)   Amazon Studios  Pictures in a Row aka Picrow     Even Netflix's recent shows have them just a distributor.  Production company(s) DeKnight Productions  Goddard Textiles[1]  ABC Studios[2]  Marvel Television  Distributor Netflix  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)     This is why you can purchase episodes of House of Cards from Amazon video on demand, Comcast Video on Demand, etc.  Netflix only has exclusive rights to subscription based online streaming in the US."

That, combined with the smaller userbase back then (this was Keyboard days, not at all recent) probably meant that audit came sooner rather than later.  I just found the email I got back then. Basically, it said that certain titles are not available outside the US, and that I attempted to purchase it while not physically in the country. In order to prove I was in the US, I had to fax one of several IDs to switch my account back to it. Otherwise, I'd be moved back to Canada."

However, I do the bulk of my reading on my Kindle.  Even when I own the physical book, I prefer to read books on my Kindle.  As much as I love my book collection and would never part with it, I can tell you the major drawback.  Moving.  I have lost count of the number of times I've had to box up all those books and schlep them hundreds of miles.  Unbox and shelve them, they gather dust for a few years, then I move again.  You're only 19, you have decades of reading in front of you.  And likely a fair bit of moving.  Don't worry about acquiring physical books right now, just read.

With the Kindle I got the freedom of having a book 24/7, light weight, and flexible font size. Thinking about upgrading to a Paperwhite soon."
kindle,392nq4,zigzampow,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:38:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for your comment. I'm pretty nuch convinced by now. Do you happen to know if Amazon ships their Kindles worldwide? Because they don't ship many things to the middle east without any connecting service
kindle,392nq4,FireOpalCO,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:00:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm.... There doesn't seem to have any option to ship Kindle or send Kindle content to Middle East... Of course if you get the device you can download most of the books....  There is a company called MyUS which allows you to buy the item, ship it to the company's address, and they will deliver it to you. I haven't asked them for shipping rate, but expect to pay $20-60 more. Still cheaper than using DHL or FedEx, though.  Good luck :)"

kindle,393v5o,GrizzGreenMonster,2,Tue Jun 9 01:53:56 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, you only have 3 days to send it back? Is this a new voyage that you purchased?  All voyages have a slight gradient, since it's frontlit and not backlit and the light (which comes from the bottom) doesn't evenly hit the screen. For most voyages, this is only noticable if you're looking for it or if you turn it upside down, otherwise you won't notice it when reading.  I know some voyages do have a severe gradient - I'm guessing this is due to a very weak front light which does a poor job at lighting up the upper half of the screen. If you have one of those, why not send it back and ask for a replacement?"
kindle,393v5o,Solarin88,2,Tue Jun 9 02:43:09 2015 UTC,"I should have clarified. I have had three voyages so far, got two replacements. Believe me when I say that I am positive this is not just a front-light based problem. I tested my friends paperwhite, and it has no signs of this issue. For example, when I am in my room or living room with the sun shining from the blinds, but not directly at the kindle, it gets noticeable. Nothing like it from the paperwhite. I know most of them must demonstrate this since I received three in total."
kindle,393v5o,bunkins,2,Tue Jun 9 03:44:35 2015 UTC,"It may seem counter-intuitive but you don't need the light on full blast when it's dark. I keep my paperwhite light set on 2 at all times. Your eyes will adjust to the low light. Use it for the next couple days on settings you feel comfortable with. If you can't find a setting you like, send it back. Try not to worry about flaws which occur outside your ideal settings."
kindle,393v5o,bunkins,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:55:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is very true. I find that in the dark I don't notice it as much because I can put it very low, but when there is low light but not very dark, it needs to be on 7-12 depending on the conditions and this is where it is most noticeable. I guess my big issue is that I don't want to have to go and spend another 200+ and be stuck with this voyage. That's why I asked about my options for a future kindle release."
kindle,393v5o,bunkins,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:46:38 2015 UTC,"If it is something you can't ignore, return it.   To answer your other questions:  There is no trade in program.

There are some softwares (most notable, Briss) that cut the margins of the PDF, which does make it a bit better, but still not ideal in my opinion, you can try it. You can try convert, but it will mess up the formation of the text.  You can also try to read it in landscape mode."

It's probably the book's issue, and not Kindle's  Kindle is most suitable for novels, or, books that are usually read from cover to cover. It's not for books like textbooks. If you really use it for school work, then the best is an actual book. Don't waste time on a Kindle - you won't get much done that way.  Alarm, Flipboard etc. are fancy, but, aren't necessary for Kindle... Why would you need an alarm for Kindle - Add up the costs, heavier, and you already have your phone for that.   For flipboard - you can subscribe to a newspaper and let it delivered wirelessly to your Kindle, and you read it just like Flipboard. An inexpensive option would be using Calibre to fetch news and let it send the news to your Kindle.   Amazon as well as the third party tool developers are working hard to add more features to the Kindle. Maybe the line-height bug will be fixed anytime soon.  Hell, I have a tablet, and paid a lot for apps and books, but after I got my hand on the Kindle, I wouldn't touch that tablet anymore. The reason isn't the screen or battery life. It's distraction - I can't read for more than 30 mins. A simple Kindle served its purpose - make the readers concentrate on the books, not the device itself."

To purchase, you have to go to Amazon.com in Safari and buy it there, just like you would from a desktop. Or buy it on a Kindle device.

I love my K4 (those page turn buttons) but without the cover I feel like it's really lacking.  Just do what I did. Look up the ""official"" lighted case on Amazon, then go to ebay and buy the closest thing you can find for 1/3rd the price. Those official covers are amazing, but they're way overpriced IMO.  For the record, when I got my K4 it was $80 (I think, it was ages ago) and the official cover was $50... Not willing to pay that premium for a cover (no matter how awesome it is).  EDIT: Just looked up the official Kindle Touch case on Amazon and it's literally identical to the K4 case (except the K4 case has cut-outs on the sides for the page-turn buttons). Ebay is full of them. They even use the battery in your Kindle to power the LED so you don't need to buy batteries or anything (and I haven't noticed any appreciable hit to the battery life, it's literally just one tiny, but bright, LED).

That's literally identical to the listing I bought mine from with one exception - mine has the word ""kindle"" embossed on the outside and again on the inside like the official cover. Here's a short video that gives you a better idea of how it works/looks.  I got the brown one - it doesn't look/feel nearly as cheap as the pics will lead you to believe. I had that concern when I ordered and was pleasantly surprised. It's obviously not real leather, but also doesn't have that ""plastic"" feel some really cheap fake leather products have. Also, it's a lot smoother than it looks in the pics but still gives a good grip. The inside is a soft microfibre kind of material that won't scratch your kindle and feels really nice when you're holding it with the cover folded all the way back.  Don't even bother looking for alternatives unless you buy the official case... I know I'm just a guy on the internet, but I'm picky about these things and unless there are huge swings in quality issues from case-to-case (heh) that cover is guaranteed to be awesome. If I had one minor complaint it's that the light is very white (not hard on the eyes in any sense). I wish it had a warmer colour temperature and was a bit yellowish, but it's more than good enough and that's just a personal preference."

The KF8 format (.azw3, or hybrid .mobi files such as output by kindlegen) supports embedded fonts. First confirm that the source .epub actually uses the fonts correctly (e.g., open it in a desktop reader and check if they show up as expected.) Take care that your @font-face stanzas in your CSS use the correct font family name (e.g. ""Charis SIL"" instead of just ""Charis"", etc--check the font file using FontForge (or whatever tool is available on Windows or OSX, don't know about those OSes) and take care to declare the MIME type correctly in the .opf. Also note that EPUB2 only correctly supports TTF fonts; use an EPUB3 source file for OTF and WOFF fonts.  And, it goes without saying, the firmware of the target Kindle must support the KF8 format. The PW1 does, out of the box. It was backported to the Kindle 3 (Kindle Keyboard) as well."

kindle,38056u,Ryccardo,17,Sun May 31 21:34:02 2015 UTC,"Let's investigate--calibre's open source :)  It's worth looking at the comments, specifically at src/calibre/devices/kindle/apnx.py line 59. According to this, there are four methods it's using:   exact, implemented in get_pages_exact. This relies on external info, i.e. when you're telling calibre ""This book has this many pages"". accurate, implemented in get_pages_accurate. Despite the name, this relies on a heuristic, namely: ""In an average paper back book there are 32 lines per page and a maximum of 70 characters per line. Each paragraph starts a new line and every 70 characters (minus markup) in a paragraph starts a new line. The position after every 30 lines will be marked as a new page."" pagebreak, which is what interests you. This is implemented in get_pages_pagebreak_tag and which falls back to the accurate method if it doesn't work out for whatever reason. It's documented as ""Determine pages based on the presense of <mbp:pagebreak>"", so this method relies on the MOBI/KF8 markup converter (kindlegen or calibre) inserting <mbp:pagebreak> tags into the compressed text stream. In other words, what it does depends on what kindlegen or calibre's converter do. fast, chosen when an error is thrown by some other method, and implemented in get_pages_fast, which also relies on a heuristic: ""2300 characters of uncompressed text per page. This is not meant to map 1 to 1 to a print book but to be a close enough measure. A test book was chosen and the characters were counted on one page. This number was round to 2240 then 60 characters of markup were added to the total giving 2300.""   Now, kindlegen is closed source so there's no telling what it does (except by trial and error), but let's look at calibre's converter, mobi_output.py. It's using the MobiMLizer class from src/calibre/ebooks/mobi/mobiml.py. The MobiML writer uses a boolean attribute named pbreak to signal page breaks, and that one's set to True here, which turns out to be whenever a content-bearing tag which has the style page-break-before with either of the values always, left, or right.  So here's your answer: When using calibre's converter with the ""page breaks"" method, then page boundaries for the APNX output are defined by content-bearing tags having the style page-break-before with either of the values always, left, or right. Presumably kindlegen does something similar (since calibre's writer was modeled on the reverse engineered file formats.)  Edit: I accidentally a closing bracket on a link, which ate the relevant part of the text. Fixed :)"
kindle,38056u,Moocha,2,Sun May 31 23:29:10 2015 UTC,"So, since it's determined by CSS, there's no way of increasing the page number without actually causing a visible page break?"
kindle,38056u,Moocha,2,Mon Jun 1 12:42:23 2015 UTC,"Doesn't look like there is. None of the numbering methods suported by Calibre will let you ""skip ahead""--it will generate sequential numbers."

I personally think more features are always better but it's too tempting for these large conglomerates to abuse the features to their benefit. then again, the kindle has everything in it that i consider to be essential to reading(long batttery life, good typography, lights, books available on demand) so maybe i'm thinking the need is niche when really everyone wants it."

kindle,37xv24,ScubaSteve1219,2,Sun May 31 17:45:25 2015 UTC,if it was just books and reading i wouldn't care problem is it links up to the amazon ecosystem. they could make a knowledge graph about the stuff i read/things i bookmark or create notes about/books i purchase and then sell that graph to other companies- they probably do that last one already. Give knowledge to someone who has no reason to care about you and it backfires in unusual and unfortunate ways you can never be paranoid enough when it comes to your privacy. i bet you make posts publicly on non-anonymous social networks too you daredevil you ;) edit:i mean google is bad enough - have you seen the location data content they hoard about you through the maps ecosystem? if someone got a hold of my account s/he could show up where i live/work/hangout and even assume my identity. it's weird and confusing trying to protect privacy right now and until laws come out to the effect that companies can't do something i'd prefer not to give data out like that
kindle,37xv24,suicidalfitnessfreak,1 point,Sun May 31 17:51:01 2015 UTC,i guess i personally don't care if the world knows my reading history and makes notes about it and shares it. that doesn't bother me. you do the same by reading a paperback in a coffeeshop.

kindle,37xv24,ScubaSteve1219,2,Sun May 31 18:16:00 2015 UTC,"It's not a points for review system I'm after. It's more a stat-based thing. For instance on audible it tells me I've spent 30 days, 14 hours and 12 minutes listening to books. I'm just surprised that another Amazon company for books (albeit read instead of spoken) don't do something similar. Admittedly, the Paperwhite tells you how much longer you have left in a chapter, even if that is grossly flawed."
kindle,37xv24,suicidalfitnessfreak,2,Sun May 31 14:15:14 2015 UTC,"paperwhite tells you how long you have left based on how fast you tap the screen. if you tap faster it changes faster, if you leave the screen on and go somewhere until it times out to standby it counts that too. be diligent about turning off your kindle if you want it to be accurate is my advice- it's what fixed it for me. so you want the kindle to tell you that you've spent X hours reading? short answer-just get a time app on your mobile would be simplest way to do this. there is no way to tell amazon to include more features on the thing/app, they do not listen. long answer- jump into kindle reader development! people have managed to load debian onto paperwhites so you could possibly get what you want. i got as far as making a time app for the kindle touch which crashed every time the alarm rung in a month so it's feasible if you really want it.otherwise maybe check out other ebook readers, they may have what you want."

IMHO, I think new authors should write shorter stories than they feel comfortable with because too many authors think that everything they write the first time around is golden and fail to revise and proofread and re- write properly. Keeping things short forces you to focus on good writing and being consise, since it forces you to rewrite. (You even have a typo in this post which makes me worried.)  All that said, once you have a well edited set of short stories, put them in book format and donate a few copies to your local library."

kindle,37x2ma,autowikibot,1 point,Sun May 31 04:36:58 2015 UTC,"Words per minute:       Words per minute, commonly abbreviated WPM, is a measure of words processed in a minute, often used as a measurement of typing speed or reading speed.  For the purpose of typing measurement, each word is standardized to be five characters or keystrokes long,  including spaces and punctuation. For example, the phrase ""I run"" counts as one word, but ""rhinoceros"" and ""let's talk"" both count as two.  Characters per minute (CPMn) are WPM times five, so that 20 WPM are 100 CPM.

There's a lot of free content on Amazon. If I'm paying, the product should be demonstrably better than the free products out there.  Notice that this has nothing to do with pages, or words. Some authors need 100k words to sufficiently tell the same story that another author would only need 25k to tell. I think that that is a misguided metric for how worthwhile a book was to read.  I like short stories. I always feel a bit of guilt when I start a book and don't finish it. It's easy to convince myself to soldier through 30 pages, it's a bit harder to fight through another 200."
kindle,37x2ma,KidROFL,2,Sun May 31 23:07:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks. There is indeed a ton of free material on Amazon. On the one hand, that's why it's good that I'll have to charge something for the material. Just to separate myself. On the other, I need to find a good word count. Assuming that the content is above average, that just leaves number of words. Since I'm doing this monthly, 10-20k is probably the max.   I might just post them to Smashwords.   Good play is another good option but their submission system is incredibly complex."

kindle,37mnu6,arthur4242,3,Thu May 28 20:25:56 2015 UTC,"Yes, on a Kindle book in the Amazon store, there should be a ""Give as a gift"" button to the right. It won't automatically download on their Kindle though, it sends an email and they redeem it."

kindle,37mnu6,CraigularB,2,Thu May 28 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"Not really. The link in the email takes you directly to the book page and you click the button that says ""redeem"" or something similar.

kindle,37nu35,RequestForAnAnswer,2,Fri May 29 00:31:19 2015 UTC,What don't you like about Amazon's software and what are you hoping Duokan will do instead?
kindle,37nu35,Solarin88,1 point,Sat May 30 05:02:35 2015 UTC,"Most of my understanding of Duokan comes from the MobileRead Wiki page and video reviews:  -More filetypes supported -Better browsing capabilities -Better at displaying different languages  It's not that the Kindle OS is bad, but there are two things that I'm not a fan of:  -Its linkage to the Amazon account - I know, I know, its part of its raison d'etre. But I'm not really interested in buying books off Amazon. I mainly wanted the ereader for free books from archive.org -Its limitations in its original form. Although I've heard you can modify the Kindle OS and you can get around some of the limitations with PC programs.  I'm just wondering everyone's opinion on what the better OS is, which one has more capabilities."
kindle,37nu35,Solarin88,1 point,Sat May 30 18:00:56 2015 UTC,"You can turn off book recommendations in settings, so really all you need is an Amazon account to register it with. After that, as long as you don't have special offers, Amazon won't be giving you ads to buy stuff.  Your second point is kind of vague. What limitations?   I use calibre to store all my non-amazon books, and calibre auto-converts the books into a supported format before putting it on my kindle. So, the filetype of a book isn't that big of a deal if you use calibre or a similar program.  I've used duokan when I was trying to read Chinese books on my kindle (eventually settled on using an iPad for that). I didn't really feel there was anything inherently better about it, and the kindle OS suits my needs just fine. There are plenty of things Amazon could do to make it better, for example make it easier to sort books into ordered collections and sort books by genre - but these things would only be a big deal to ebook hoarders who have 1000+ books on their kindle. If you're like most people and just use the kindle to read books, I think the kindle OS does that perfectly."
kindle,37nu35,etruj,2,Sun May 31 02:15:43 2015 UTC,I did it for the ability to read any format and not have to deal with converting. Can't complain but i don't use any of the other features like the dictionary or web browsing
kindle,37nu35,etruj,2,Sat May 30 07:02:21 2015 UTC,"In your experience, even though you don't use them often, would you say the other features are better or worse than the Kindle OS?  And also, is Duokan secure and reliable? Is it actually respected and trusted as a piece of software or is it more experimental? Sorry if I'm not being clear, I'm totally new to ereaders. :D"
kindle,37obus,GrizzGreenMonster,2,Fri May 29 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"All front-lit eReaders have uneven lighting of some sort. These aren't iPads, the light that's coming from the bottom of the kindle will naturally be a little more prevalent at the bottom than at the top.   You're sacrificing increased contrast, page turn buttons, and other cool features if you downgrade from the Voyage to the PW. Personally I don't think it's worth it at all.   How long have you used the voyage, and have you used a PW before? I upgraded from a PW, and to me the subtle color gradient is immaterial compared to the PW's blotchy screen."

Maybe some unevenness at the edges but not as bad from what I have seen. I have had the voyage about three weeks now, the main reason I got it was because of the glass display so I could just put it in my pocket without it being scratched and not having a case.   I had a paperwhite when it was $99 at best buy before I got the voyage, I had it a few hours and realized how the screen was not meant to be exposed as much so got the voyage.  so I am not sure weather or not to keep it since I got it discounted, or just return it and get a PW or Glo HD."

kindle,37it7h,MBoffin,4,Wed May 27 23:03:48 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it reads as though they are manually reformatting all of the books, rather than updating the Kindle itself to have expanded formatting options.  And that's really disappointing to me.  I personally don't like fully-justified text at all and have been manually converting everything that I read via Calibre to force left-justified left-aligned text with a custom font that I prefer using.  Since I've had to run everything I buy through Calibre anyway, I've also been buying from eBook retailers other than Amazon a lot more frequently, since it is no less convenient.  It seems as though things like hyphenation and drop caps will also be forced, and the new font uses oldstyle numerals (source) all of which I dislike, and find makes reading more difficult.  So although I was initially excited about Amazon finally taking formatting seriously—which I said would be the deciding factor for me to upgrade to a Voyage (likely a second-generation model) and to start buying everything from Amazon again—it seems as though this is not actually an update to give people finer control over the formatting and just another style of formatting which is being forced upon us all."
kindle,37it7h,163941,2,Thu May 28 02:17:52 2015 UTC,I prefer left justification... much more comfortable to read without big spaces between words.

It's probably a easy fix and it would make everyone happy.   even spaces between words make me happy: https://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/imagecache/inline-large/inline/2015/05/3046678-inline-i-2-the-kindle-finally-gets-some-typography-that-doesnt-suck.png

It may seem like a bunch of data on your kindle, and a tangible product in your hand, when in truth, it is the same amount of information.  Additionally, some of us are self publishing, and that can be done with little cost with ebooks. The formatting needed for a kindle, while time consuming, is a cake walk compared to print formatting. As such, those doing everything on their own, often print on kindle as a way to make money so they can pay someone to format their print file... it really is difficult.   You can see how an author would see thier kindle book as holding just as much value in terms of content, as the print version, even if the consumer's perception is a bit different.

kindle,36u0s8,santulan,3,Fri May 22 03:47:13 2015 UTC,If you think that you are going to use it a fair amount I would sell it and get a Paperwhite or Voyage. I had a 2nd generation Kindle for years and recently upgraded to a Voyage. The back lighting is an indispensable feature for me. I like to read in the dark without disturbing  my wife or coworkers.
kindle,36u0s8,thirstypirate,3,Fri May 22 03:49:58 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved the back lighting of the Paperwhite. It was a sudden and dramatic improvement over my old, unlit Sony."
kindle,36u0s8,chonggo,3,Fri May 22 04:45:01 2015 UTC,"I have both and I love the lighting of the Paperwhite.  I actually bought a case with a light for the Kindle gen 4, but it's nothing like as good.    The Paperwhite drops to $99 pretty often -- it was that price about a week ago -- so if you can hold on a little while you might save $20 on it."

I'm happy with mine - but I  bet that if I sent it over to you that you would see some discoloration.  Please don't take that as a criticism. It isn't. It bothers some people, others don't notice it - but I think it's an issue inherent to the technology."
kindle,36s7pp,human4510975318,2,Thu May 21 21:11:34 2015 UTC,You both have valid points actually.
kindle,36s7pp,omaca,1 point,Thu May 21 21:21:04 2015 UTC,"Both very valid points indeed. I think I'm of the opinion that if I pay a premium, then I should receive a product that is flawless to the best of my knowledge.   As for difference in perception, yes. You might not notice the discoloration, whereas I do. But my issue is with the fact that the discoloration is so prevalent. Perhaps I can only see through the lenses of my special eyes, lol!, but they're not super-human special. Which means there's an acceptable margin of error they choose which lies above the perceivable level for some, maybe most, certainly not all.   If a TV manufacturer ok'd a product with a slight rose hue to the top half of the TV, it would fail.   Perhaps this speaks to the idea of free market competition and why it's important?  Either way, thank you all for your insightful replies. :)"
kindle,36s7pp,DeShawnThordason,1 point,Thu May 21 23:24:24 2015 UTC,"Like how a lot of people complained about uneven lighting on the Paperwhite, but it's really hard to notice (for me!)"
kindle,36s7pp,SilviaS14,0,Fri May 22 00:18:42 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your response. The only part I disagree with is the ""inherent"" part.   Paperwhite 2 is undoubtedly free-er of the spotty lighting.   I'd bet that Voyage two will be mostly free of the discoloration.   They should stop releasing products that conform to their V1 standards, and release V2's as their upgrades.   But they won't. Because it generates smaller profits. Who cares? As long as people keep buying them, they'll keep cashing in."
kindle,36s7pp,pixie_led,3,Fri May 22 08:27:44 2015 UTC,"I went through 3 Voyages. First two were from Best Buy, both with discolored screens. Then I got one through Amazon. It had a better screen, but still slightly discolored. I tried to tolerate it for a few weeks but it was too distracting.  Really poor quality control on Amazon's behalf. I didn't even bother with the exchange because I knew it'd be more trouble than it was worth. Returned it and I guess I'm holding out for the V2."
kindle,36s7pp,prisonhistoryguy,2,Fri May 22 00:28:08 2015 UTC,I must say I'm glad I read the comments here about the screen issue when I upgraded from my K3. I had intended to buy the Voyage but because of the persistent screen problems reported I bought the Paperwhite instead. Saved money and I think got a better quality device. I still want a Voyage because of the page turn buttons but will wait for an improved version.

I just bought one and I don't think I have this problem, but it seems like EVERYONE else does. And the more I stare at my screen, the more my eyes begin playing tricks on me."
kindle,36s7pp,voyage_throwaway,2,Fri May 22 00:22:20 2015 UTC,Here ya go. This is my fourth kindle from Best Buy in the last three days. The first three had multiple pinholes each and discoloration. The third also had some pixels that were stuck white. I'm shocked how consistently bad the screens are on these things for a $200 e-reader. This one is going back too. I took a pic of the current one I have and then also flipped the right half. Either way it is apparent. Either some people got their voyage from a different production run or they are willfully ignoring the screen issues.
kindle,36s7pp,clumsyotter,1 point,Fri May 22 18:27:10 2015 UTC,I have a bit of that screen discoloration for sure. I don't suppose this is something they can fix with an update? Does seem a bit silly for a 200 ereader to have these issues.

kindle,36s7pp,chonggo,1 point,Sat May 30 06:33:11 2015 UTC,"The two types I've had are the original discoloration which I can only describe as blooming Amber light that starts at the top left corner, and blooming white light that starts from the bottom right. They are each directed at each other so really disorienting.   The newer type of discoloration is more of a gradient. The top half is Amber and the bottom half is white. So as you read it gets brighter and brighter with each line. Then as soon as your eyes are used to the brightness, you turn the page and start reading the dimmer top half. Your eyes have to keep adjusting both down the page and all over again with each new page. :("
kindle,36s7pp,JacksonGuitarguy,1 point,Fri May 22 18:44:27 2015 UTC,"I thought I had waited long enough. I was excited for the new version but I'm just amazed that they keep sending out devices with bad screens.   The fact that the refurbished one was the 2nd replacement, on top of the discoloration, was it for me.   The reps were apologetic, but I'd rather sacrifice the $5 credit they applied for a $200 device that's not defective.   sigh"
kindle,36s7pp,soleilvie,1 point,Fri May 22 18:47:54 2015 UTC,"I'd been trying to ignore this issue for a long time. I had one of the very first ones shipped and didn't pay attention on purpose for a long time, but finally warrantied it a few weeks ago. The new one has less pink but the gradient is pretty noticeable now. Oh well. It stinks when the device cost $200 but it starts to fade the more I get into the book."
kindle,36s7pp,soleilvie,2,Thu May 21 23:06:54 2015 UTC,Yea. Sounds about right.  I'm sure it does fade over viewing time. Sort of how TVs eventually feel not as big as they were when it first came home with the buyer.   But that doesn't make it ok as far as I'm concerned. I still notice the splotchy lighting on my PW1.   I really gotta stop buying V1's. Lol!
kindle,36s7pp,aspartameimpala,2,Fri May 22 00:24:58 2015 UTC,I definitely agree. I wish mine didn't have the gradient. I know they exist but why couldn't I have gotten one?
kindle,36s7pp,soleilvie,2,Thu May 21 23:42:03 2015 UTC,"I really gotta stop buying V1's.    Lol! My thoughts exactly! Thanks for this, btw. I was tempted to try a new Voyage, hoping they had finally solved the screen issue. Guess not."
kindle,36s7pp,aspartameimpala,3,Fri May 22 00:21:42 2015 UTC,"It's definitely an upgrade, and the screen discoloration (on mine) is only noticeable when I'm reading in low light. Then I like the backlighting turned down low (13 or so), and the discoloration is visible. That said, until I got the Voyage, I never realized just how blotchy my PW1 screen was.  I think part of the issue is that the PW1 coloration ran heavily into the blue-white spectrum, whereas the Voyage naturally runs into the orange-white spectrum, and the contrast makes the orange-ish shading stand out even more. While I'm looking forward to a truly white screen, my brain seems to have compensated for the shading, and I don't notice it anymore."
kindle,36s7pp,soleilvie,1 point,Fri May 22 01:27:50 2015 UTC,"I bought one as soon as they came out and haven't noticed any discoloration and it works like a champ. Toss it in my bag everyday, I use the thing all the time."
kindle,36s7pp,soleilvie,0,Fri May 22 04:36:13 2015 UTC,I had this problem when the Voyage first came out. The replacement they sent me was refurbished. Absolutely ridiculous. I'm not paying a premium price for a premium device that isn't even new out of the box. I got myself a Kobo instead. Still holding out for an Amazon device that I love but not getting my hopes up.

There could be some e-ink advances that we don't know about, but I wouldn't count on it.  What I have thought would be a more interesting move by Amazon for the Kindle like would be to create a tablet version of the YotaPhone (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/yotaphone-2-world-s-first-dual-screen-smartphone/).  Having a 6-7 inch LCD screen on one side and a 6-7 inch E-ink on the other side would make for a very interesting e-reader."

kindle,36q9t0,HarryHutton,3,Thu May 21 07:11:18 2015 UTC,"This seems really neat, but we have to consider the cost associated with changing a simple button to a scroll wheel with haptic feedback. You would probably need some sort of tiny motor in order to have programmable ""bumps"" which would add to the cost and likely consume more battery power (as physical mechanisms tend to do). I'm not an engineer, so I could be completely wrong on this. Maybe an electronics engineer would like to comment.  In many instances we find that just because a company has not implemented a particular feature in their product doesn't necessarily mean that they haven't thought about it, but because they haven't been able to implement it and keep the product at the price customers are willing to pay. In this case, Amazon probably doesn't find it financial feasible to implement this feature for such a small market (there probably aren't many of us non-fiction Kindle readers)."

I do think I'd have only one scroll wheel, though, and an accelerometer so that the wheel can be used on either side to suit handedness and the screen will orient to suit. Having two seems unnecessary. Seeing as a wheel necessarily can rotate in both directions. You're just duplicating functionality by having two."

kindle,36q9t0,twowheels,1 point,Thu May 21 16:59:05 2015 UTC,I think OP's idea was that you could scroll much faster than the screen refresh because the haptic feedback would tell you when you've hit a point of interest (chapter boundary/bookmark).
kindle,36q9t0,grosslittlestage,5,Thu May 21 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"Having physical wheels is probably not a good idea. Moving parts = things to break, and the way these wheels stick out means you couldn't just slide the kindle into a bag or whatever... there's also a high chance they could get ripped off because they aren't flush with the rest of the device.  Better might be touch sensitive surfaces instead of the wheels. Something like a mini laptop touchpad would have essentially the same functionality as the wheels without all the problems caused by the wheels' physical form."
kindle,36q9t0,neonKow,5,Thu May 21 14:30:24 2015 UTC,Phones have had scroll wheel on them and they've been plenty durable. I'd much rather use a physical device than a touch sensor.
kindle,36q9t0,alienangel2,1 point,Thu May 21 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"The voyage already has haptic feedback for its touch buttons so that wouldn't be extra. The scroll wheel would be though, and given the slow redraw time I'm very skeptical about being able to see anything useful flicking through 8 pages a second.   The voyage's touch sensors also gave top and bottom halves that register independently, so if they want to support scroll gestures they could let you just swipe up/down over those."

Now if you want to get back to one of them from page 33, will one of them open or will a browser turn up from which you can skip on to the required highlight?"

Oh hell yes.  It doesn't shine a light into your eyes or have a constant refresh of the screen.  Feels just like paper. You are better off doing those on a tablet.  That's why I have both a kindle and a kindle fire. Go ahead and get special offers.  It's about as intrusive as having an ad at the back of a magazine.

In one word, it's GREAT! Pictures are very clear and the quality is comparable to printed manga (particularly if you're familiar with Japanese editions of manga). Text is also readable, albeit somewhat small. I haven't had any problems reading entire volumes though and actually enjoy reading manga on my kindle more than my large monitor because it really does feel like reading from printed manga. There is also a panel mode if you would like to read panel by panel instead, but I haven't used that mode very much because I prefer full page mode. If you do decide to read manga on the kindle, download Kindle Comic Converter. It's free and will quickly format your manga files for easy reading on the kindle.  *edit: I also recommend buying a cover that has a magnetic clasp. With it, your kindle will automatically switch on and off when you open and close the cover.   Here's a sample of manga without the light on  And with the light on"

kindle,363ewx,MrExpress,1 point,Wed May 20 20:23:00 2015 UTC,"I can answer a few for you.  If yo get a paperwhite you'll be able to read in dark and light easily.  And yes, it is way better than a phone, tablet, or computer. It's easy on the eyes and have read for hours upon hours. I love my paperwhite and it's small enough to fit in a back pocket. I'm military so it's money on deployment where room is limited. If you know what a torrent is, you'll find your access to books dramatically increases.  Comics would be cool but even if you could format it somehow, (I'm not sure if yo can) it's going to black and white and turning pages will be slow.  Buy a kindle if you love reading and it will be your best friend. If you'd rather watch a movie than get/stick with a tablet."

It was marked as delivered but of course was not, so I had to wait until it was missing 24 hours and then ask for a replacement, which I finally received.  It has crap for battery life compared to my first Kindle Fire, so I'm disappointed there.  The charger goes in kind of at an angle, which scared me at first, so I wish I had been warned about that.  And my favorite app Sleepy Time, which plays sounds to fall asleep to, doesn't work right with the new tablet - it quits the moment the screen goes to sleep (default settings is 5 minutes).

The library is fairly large. Amazon claims to have over 800,000 books but I haven't seen a lot of new books on there as of yet. You can always browse the Kindle Unlimited selection too, even if you don't have a membership.   If you go to the Kindle Unlimited page, there's a link to ""View My Kindle Unlimited Books"". If you click that, you can manage your digital content. The easiest way to buy a book that you've borrowed is to click on the Action button (it has 3 dots on it ... like this!) and then a link for the book will pop up. Click the title and it will take you to the page on Amazon for the book and you can buy it with your 1-Click account.  I'm not sure if there's an easy way to purchase them from the Kindle itself. All the things I've mentioned have been from the Amazon website directly.    If Amazon.ca offers a trial, try it out. 30 days for free. Just make sure you cancel before the trial ends or the credit card on file will be charged automatically.   Edit - You know, I go on my account on Amazon, do a little looking around for a few minutes, do some research on my own account and try to find answers to the best of my ability and I get a downvote.

I am not sure if this is a mix of the font used along with the e-ink display or if the paperwhite is just not the best for displaying those kind of maps.   Not too long ago I read Russell Brand's Booky Wook in which he had included old notes/letters and school reports throughout the book but found myself skipping those images as I couldn't read half of what they said, they appeared far too light and faded on the screen."

kindle,35le4c,camkeys,1 point,Mon May 11 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by reading newspapers? Are you wanting to read a replica of the front page or just the articles? Calibre has a news function that will automagically siphon snapshots of websites and send them to your device (i.e. at 6am grab the 20 latest articles from ChicagoTribune.com in these sections, then email the ebook to my device). They appear as books on your device and seem to be pretty similar in content to the few times I've bought newspapers on Amazon to compare. That can be a flawless experience or horrible, depending on the how the site is set up and how your Calibre script scrapes the data. It can handle sites like NYT, WSJ the Economist, etc that require login information.  For web articles there are a few send to kindle bookmarklets that send the article like a small book and is a better option. In my limited experience, the browser is a last resort."

The backlight is perfect for me, since I read in bed late at night, and the screen is definitely sharper, but otherwise I'd say if you are happy with your kb, keep it. The extra memory usually isn't a big deal unless you keep lots of books on it.  Btw, if you read manga on it, the best thing to do is convert them into mono, cbz, or cbr format. You can often download them that way too. Kindle reads it natively and it is way better than off for comics and manga. There is a free utility that will convert them., or calibre will do it. I'll post a link when I get to my desk.   EDIT: Kindle Comic Converter won't go directly from PDF, but you can export from adobe to pngs and it will take those."

The PW is quite an advancement in terms of readability.  It's the first time I actually felt like I was reading a book as opposed to a device.  The heft, the presentation, it felt very natural.  The downside was that I lost my buttons.  I generally hold the device with one hand, with the 2nd Gen I turned pages by just pressing my thumb.  The PW broke that for me.  The new Voyage basically gives me the PW and my button press.  Dollarwise, the PW is the best deal.  If you want to press a button to turn the page, like your old one, then look at the Voyage.  The Origami cover for the Voyage is pretty neat also."

Arrange the plastic snugly over the screen so you don't have any folds or wrinkles. Now put it on a soft surface (I use my bed) and put a pillow over it.

But the other, yes, unless you bought a book from Amazon, using Send-to-Kindle mean that you make that kind of trade-off.  However, I think if it bother you that much, just load a hell lot of books in there via USB. Like, overnight when . It's faster than using"
kindle,35di2l,CraigularB,1 point,Sat May 9 17:06:51 2015 UTC,"Whispersync being where it keeps your books in sync between devices.  So if I'm reading on my phone with the Kindle app, when I pick that book up later on my Kindle it's at the same place I left off in my phone.  A completely seamless feature when buying a book from Amazon, but tricky to get working with non-Amazon books."
kindle,35di2l,FeatherClad,1 point,Sun May 10 17:54:00 2015 UTC,"Accidentally press reply. Anyway, upload them via usb overnight, like, when you recharge your kindle. You don't have to worry about ugly cover or no page number anymore.  Personally I only use send to kindle to send news, and delete them afterward, so it's no big deal."
kindle,35a4rj,Macmandingo,47,Fri May 8 11:45:30 2015 UTC,More than you can ever read.

kindle,35a4rj,oneonetwooneonetwo,15,Fri May 8 15:34:57 2015 UTC,"I think 1,400 is the number i have officially read somewhere. The truth is that after several hundred, it hardly matters."
kindle,35a4rj,the_thinker,9,Fri May 8 13:36:34 2015 UTC,"After a while the main bottleneck is the software running the menu display, really. It gets really pretty unhappy after 500~ screens of titles.  Actually, come to think of it, that was me playing around with an early kindle. The processors etc are going to be better now."
kindle,35a4rj,oneonetwooneonetwo,3,Fri May 8 15:37:33 2015 UTC,"One time I decided to try to sync my entire library in Calibre, about 3,400 books, to my paperwhite. They were all moved onto the device (it took about 8 hours) and the space used was only about 60% o_O  The home screen, however, was pretty slow rendering book covers."
kindle,35a4rj,chrislongman,1 point,Fri May 8 18:13:27 2015 UTC,"Can Calibre handle Collections properly?  I don't want a HUGE list of everything on my Kindle Voyage. I want things sorted.  Fiction, Nonfiction, Programming, Educational, Erotica, etc.  I'd rather have 20 groups... than 600 books."
kindle,35a4rj,chrislongman,1 point,Mon May 11 19:03:15 2015 UTC,"Not sure- I've never tried. I usually put 5-10 books on my kindle from calibre, read them, then remove and do another 5-10.  I've heard good things about this: http://dearauthor.com/ebooks/using-kindle-collections-plugin-for-calibre/"
kindle,35a4rj,CraigularB,8,Tue May 12 17:22:40 2015 UTC,In my ~4 years of owning a Kindle (4GB and 2GB) I've never once worried about how many books I can fit on it. They're so small you'll be able to fit more than you can reasonably read before you'd have access to a computer or internet to load different ones :)
kindle,35a4rj,CraigularB,2,Fri May 8 14:24:59 2015 UTC,Not really worried about filling it. Just curious :)
kindle,35a4rj,human4510975318,2,Fri May 8 14:38:30 2015 UTC,"Fair enough! Honestly for me, I just tend to think of it as infinite and not think about how many books I could fit on there. If I ever get to the point where I run out of space on my Kindle I've probably done something wrong.  I usually don't keep too many on my Kindle at a time, actually. I have the 3G Voyage so if I need a book I can just grab it from Amazon's cloud. The exception is if I'm on a plane, but even then unless it's a long-ass flight I don't tend to load up."
kindle,35a4rj,stankbucket,4,Fri May 8 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"Depends on the size. If we generously assume that each ebook  is 5mb you would be able to squeeze on approximately 800.  Most of mine are less than 5mb, so I would expect it to hold over 1000."
kindle,35a4rj,beansandcornbread,7,Fri May 8 12:01:29 2015 UTC,Most of my books are well under 1MB. The average is probably 600KB.
kindle,35a4rj,LaVidaEsUnaBarca,2,Fri May 8 15:11:27 2015 UTC,"ahh, plenty then :)"
kindle,35a4rj,apetresc,5,Fri May 8 12:56:56 2015 UTC,"I guess that depends on how good at balancing you are.  Plus, you'll need a way to put books on top of the stack once it gets really high."
kindle,35a4rj,PAY_CLOSE_ATTENTION,3,Fri May 8 17:34:31 2015 UTC,"Probably close to 1000, do note however that if you are loading a lot of comic books or PDFs that number will drop substantially."
kindle,35a4rj,Fritzzzz,3,Fri May 8 13:51:25 2015 UTC,"A standard book like Treasure Island is 600kb, so about 6990 books like this will fit in your 4gb Kindle."
kindle,35a4rj,themadturk,3,Fri May 8 16:30:47 2015 UTC,All of them.
kindle,35a4rj,zouhair,2,Fri May 8 19:35:36 2015 UTC,thousands.  i grabbed a dump of ~1000 books from the pirate bay shortly after i got my first kindle and it was under a gig.

kindle,358yr0,ScienceGuyBillNye,2,Fri May 8 02:33:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer. I've read up a bit, and the only other version that somewhat interests me is the 4gb version, but I can probably manage with 1,000+ books."
kindle,358yr0,chonggo,2,Fri May 8 02:46:44 2015 UTC,"I think my generation 1 paperwhite really began to bog down at around 600-700 books.  Even though I had plenty of memory left, I guess that was the most the processor could handle. (And that was after deleting the big pdfs;those really slowed things down."
kindle,358yr0,destiriser,1 point,Fri May 8 05:03:29 2015 UTC,"Ah, interesting. Its not like I have the biggest budget, or allotted reading time, reaching 25 purchased books would be an accomplishment lol"
kindle,358yr0,destiriser,0,Fri May 8 12:28:34 2015 UTC,"resolution   edit: mistake. Not resolution, but the panel type is completely different, Paperwhite 1 has Pearl e ink screen, paperwhite 2 has Carta. Better screen is about the only thing worth paying extra in an ebook reader."
kindle,358yr0,destiriser,1 point,Sat May 9 04:49:54 2015 UTC,"It's not the same screen. It does have a different, worse screen. Paperwhite 1 has Pearl E-Ink, 2 has Carta. Yes, the resolution is the same, but if you already verified that, why won't you correct the mistake instead?"
kindle,358yr0,destiriser,0,Fri May 8 07:03:27 2015 UTC,You could say the same about voyage too. There is a difference. It does lack the Carta display technology. Not mentioning that is falsifying the truth. OP will decide by himself. I'd go for classic or something with 300ppi+ and Carta.
kindle,358yr0,destiriser,1 point,Fri May 8 12:47:58 2015 UTC,"You certainly could. There's no objectivity in what you say, it's an opinion, just expressed as it was an udiscussable fact.  I did not recommend it, I only said I'd go for it or the even cheaper classic and about classic, the difference between it and paperwhite is not noticeable. Oh, and there are physical keys and no annoying touch screen, you can focus on reading. I recommend, I had both classic and paperwhite and classic is what I'm using. But seriously, I just provide important information, OP should and will decide by himself and my advice is checking stuff by yourself."
kindle,358yr0,Tbrody,1 point,Fri May 8 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think you have some problem. Anyway, I said that really simple short thing I wanted to point out and it's pointed out."
kindle,358yr0,Tbrody,3,Fri May 8 14:45:01 2015 UTC,"As /u/Nuts-n-Bolts said, most of the ones on eBay will be the 1st gen Paperwhite, not the current 2nd gen. This Engadget article gives a good overview of the difference between the two and a Google Images search for ""paperwhite 1 vs paperwhite 2 light"" (or similar) shows the difference between the screen lights.  The above isn't to say the 1st gen Paperwhite isn't a great eReader, because it is. If the differences between models don't sound like they'd matter, you should be fine with the one you've linked to.   Edit: Oh, also, re: the case: I have this one (from that specific listing) in blue, and it's great. Sleep/wake works fine. I'll probably replace it with a nicer ""leather"" one soon, but I've got no complaints about it."
kindle,358yr0,chonggo,1 point,Fri May 8 15:36:05 2015 UTC,"Alright, cool, I'm somewhat confident ill be making a good purchase. Only thing to be worried about would be physical things, like scratches or dents, but who am I to care if I'm reading. Thanks for the info on the case too."
kindle,358yr0,chonggo,2,Fri May 8 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"I bought one and it's great. A couple scratches, not a big deal."
kindle,35a0h6,Macmandingo,2,Fri May 8 10:42:00 2015 UTC,"My first Kindle is the same as yours and I LOVE IT. I do miss reading with a tablet at night in the dark without a lamp on, but the reading experience is so much better with Kindle. I also attach a book light to my leather case and I'm good. I don't plan to upgrading until my Kindle is falling to pieces."
kindle,35a0h6,Irielilla,1 point,Tue May 12 19:34:15 2015 UTC,Good to know :) Should hopefully get mine today or tomorrow now. I'm so excited to start reading properly again.
kindle,35a0h6,chiefstuderg,1 point,Wed May 13 15:19:42 2015 UTC,as long as you aren't going to be constantly using it in the dark  think you're in the clear
kindle,35a0h6,greenplaguer,1 point,Fri May 8 12:35:09 2015 UTC,well I plan on using it mostly in my room at night with a lamp on like I would with any ordinary book. Guessing it no different than that?
kindle,35a0h6,chonggo,2,Fri May 8 12:56:17 2015 UTC,I'm sure the paperwhites are great but I got the same kindle in February and I honestly haven't even noticed the lack of backlight once. I generally don't read in the dark and I wasn't planning on starting. It doesn't sound like you're going to either so I think you'll be happy with your current kindle. People here just really love their PWs.  Of course your mileage may vary but I love my kindle.
kindle,35a0h6,snarks_,1 point,Sun May 10 02:34:51 2015 UTC,"If you are used to surfing /reading on a tablet or smart phone, you should probably go with the paperwhite because it will deliver an experience closer to what you're used to. The screen will be much whiter,  whereas the touch will be the same shade of gray as a mass market paperback."
kindle,35a0h6,SlidingBike,2,Sat May 9 02:24:30 2015 UTC,I'd actually prefer the same grey as a mass market paperback :) I can't stand trying to read on my smartphone; too garish.

kindle,358xjk,kittybeard,3,Fri May 8 03:41:13 2015 UTC,"There's no guarantee there will be a refresh - or it may be a minor one (increase in storage or battery life with the same design and other specs, for instance) - so keep that in mind, but since my current kindle still works I'm happy to wait."
kindle,358xjk,cypherpunks,2,Fri May 8 03:43:03 2015 UTC,"Either way I'd like the most recent, and best configuration possible. Who wants to buy a device that's going to be a ""previous version"" in no time?  My current Kindle also works just fine. It's just that it's become frustrating not having a lit screen. That's the main reason for the upgrade. Also, the text on that screen is amazing!"
