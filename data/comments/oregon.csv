Definitely no tourists there and you can have a good hour or two of walking through some VERY thick, ancient looking forest. Its not rough and tumble hiking, but just enough to give you a bit of a rise in heart beat. Right next to it is a huge rhododendron garden and a beautiful picnic shelter where you can stop for lunch. If you look REAL hard, you'll find an early, abandoned pioneer chapel in the woods behind the shelter, overgrown with moss and ferns. This little area is a gorgeous, little visited part of Eugene up on the hill just outside of campus. I guess if you REALLY want to, you can also go see Prefontane's memorial rock a few blocks away on a very narrow road, but that is a HUGE tourist spot."

oregon,3e0nvg,manzanitabeachlife,2,Tue Jul 21 23:53:18 2015 UTC,"The Oregon coast covers a lot of area. Specifying area helps. The north coast is easily accessible from the Portland area, if that's a destination. Astoria, our northern most town, is an old (for the west coast) seafaring town.  It's undergoing gentrification and is pretty wonderful.  Do you like outdoor types of activities?  There are wonderful opportunities on the north coast for hikes, beach going, kayaking, body surfing or boogie boarding (wetsuit needed) throughout the north coast. There have been lists of many of these posted here.  Fort Stevens State Park, south of Astoria, is a good stop.  Fort Clatsop, the ""fort"" where Lewis and Clark, is interesting for people who enjoy history.  Seaside is a very touristy town, and you might want to quickly go through (unless you like that kind of experience).  Ecola State Park, just north of Cannon Beach, is a good stop.  Beauty, hiking and tide pooling.  Arch Cape is another wonderful beach south of Ecola. Oswald West State Park is a terrific destination, with some easy hiking and beautiful beaches.  Just south of Oswald West is the tallest mountain on the coast, Neahkahnie.  Don't miss the hike to the top to enjoy a much photographed, spectacular view.  Or do you mountain bike?  This area has some great opportunities.  Manzanita and Manzanita beach is a beautiful 7 mile beach, and very popular with locals.  At the south end of the beach is Nehalem Bay State Park, with camping, lots of trails, beaches with seals, and more.  South of this is the Nehalem River, perfect for kayaking or SUP to enjoy the quiet beauty.  You can rent a kayak at the Wheeler Marina.  Or travel a little further and rent a boat at Kelly's Brighton Marina and go crabbing on the Nehalem Bay.  They'll clean and cook your crabs.  Rockaway Beach is more geared towards touristy things, but it does have an incredible old growth forest east of town.  Farther south, Garibaldi is a good place to find a charter company and go deep sea fishing.  There's lots more to do or see in the area which continues on southward.  Let me know if you need further help."

A lot of people did a pretty good job of hiding their worst traits until Obama was elected and they all worked themselves into a froth. Same goes for the issue of guns. Our family have always been hunters...they had never been militant gun rights people until Obama was elected.

Map showing the percent of a state's population that lives in rural areas.  Notice a trend? (Two maps shittly overlapped. The more red/orange hue a state is, the more likely it voted republican and is predominately rural.)  Conservatives, who live in rural areas, are the ones behind the massive support behind the overtly racist Donald Trump, and countless other Republican candidates who in recent years have either covertly supported racism or said that it wasn't a problem. So yeah, there's problems with racism everywhere, including in ""hipster enclaves"" like San Francisco and Portland.

Across I-5, you have Springfield, which is the completely other end of the political spectrum. Portland has a few universities, and a creative center that tends to attract the intellectual / affluent community.   Go back a few decades and this all disappears. Anti-homosexual violence was still common in the 90's and 00's, racially motivated violence was still common in the 80's and so on. It's a tall order to call it a pathological hatred of race or sexual orientation, but people didn't take kindly to the other. Not entirely surprising when you can have a community built up that basically has successive generations taking pride in doing what their fathers did, and that being what those father's father had done, and so on.

Most of the California hate comes from people that transplanted to Oregon themselves, but feel like they have been here long enough to give them title. There is a large belief that Californians come in and try to make Oregon California, but most of that is really a political stunt to prevent more regulation. There's some truth to that, but it can really just be boiled down to young people are the ones moving and young people tend to be more liberal. A lot of the culture around ""I was here first"" tends to be conservative so there is some friction.  I moved here for grad school and I tend to get mixed responses when I tell people that. People that know the school I go to seem excited that a school in their backyard is prestigious enough to attract people from all over, people that don't know the school tend to care more about where I'm from than why I'm here.

Second thing I would suggest is for a social/friend making place is not the bars but Tom pierce discgolf course in grants pass. Everyone is super chill out there and I guarantee if you are open to meeting/playing something with strangers bring a sixer and wait at hole one for some people and just ask if you can play with. Third, all the bars in this area are lame, I live right next to two bars right in the downtown plaza of Ashland, and I cant stand the BS crowd that these places have. the one exception is Martino's due to the atmosphere and good service. one more thing, if you have never done it, try the Shakespeare shows, you might be surprised.

If you ask an economist ""what is the cheapest, easiest, and most effective way to take money from Rich people and give it to poor people,"" the economist will invariably answer: ""Take money from the rich people and give it to the poor people."" The research (as I am told) suggests that minimum wage is a pretty ineffective way to achieve this goal.  Nothing is more ""efficient"" than simply giving people money.

Having higher real wages in the 1950s/60s certainly did not hurt us."
oregon,3dp9uo,Zenmachine83,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"I'm with you here, I'm not trying to say that I'm against raising the minimum wage in general. My attitudes toward $15 are a little more tempered, but I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm against it.   Stagnating wages are a problem, but there is more to the story. My labor economist colleagues tell me that total compensation has been increasing, mostly in the form of health care. In terms of total compensation, workers are substantially better off than they were thirty years ago. Herein lies my hesitancy--a minimum wage hike of this magnitude is really unprecedented, and may distort the market in some really bad ways.  But again, I find nothing objectionable in what you are saying, and I'm mostly on your side. I'm just quibbling with a few minor points."
oregon,3dp9uo,tyrueiwoq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:39:25 2015 UTC,"I think the comparison to healthcare is fraught with problems. HC as a component on our GDP is going nuts, no doubt. But much of that growth is due to the lack of cost controls on pharma, hospitals, and other care providers. Then you throw in the private insurance racket and HC costs are becoming a money sink in our economy. Especially considering how much we pay vs what we get.   I agree that in some sectors, wages have been increasing. Unfortunately, it is at the bottom of the wage scale that wages have been totally stagnant. Our economy has also shifted from a production based one to a ""service""economy where a much larger portion of workers are working in lower skilled service jobs that don't pay anywhere near what manufacturing jobs used to pay...  I do think we are debating smaller points. I didn't always support raising the min wage as a means to address poverty or inequality, my support for it now is more out of pragmatism. It is unlikely that our state gov can put together a comprehensive revenue and spending program to address the problems we face; this idea seems more plausible although I judging by conversations I have had and posts on this board when election time comes a lot of people making less than 15/hr will be voting against this."
oregon,3dp9uo,Zenmachine83,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:38:39 2015 UTC,"Agreed. While healthcare expenditures have been climbing, it doesn't appear that use of healthcare services is expanding at nearly the same clip. Workers compensation is increasing, but they aren't any better off.   This was the main critique of the healthcare bill -- it did little to address costs. Employers that provide healthcare simply can't afford raises, since all extra revenue earmarked for labor goes into healthcare. I think it's reasonable to argue that labor would be seeing a reasonable increase in wages if it weren't for healthcare costs.   And herein lies the danger of the minimum wage: if the labor markets are actually functioning well when considering health care costs, then this drastic increase in labor costs could have a disastrous effect on the market.  I say go for it. Someone's got to try, and if its a disaster we'll just repeal it. If it works then we can start rolling it out everywhere."

I'm not trying to excuse people from the consequences of their actions, and I'm not saying that society should take the responsibility of protecting people from the consequences of their actions, but at some point we have to look at measures that will benefit all of us and be willing to say ""I'm okay with other people getting something too.""

Giving people money at any age will not do any good if they learned poor money management skills.  That is the problem of why poor parents have poor kids, because the parents have habits that make them poor.    What I mean is that almost any 18 year old that has not committed a serious crime, or procreated, have the direct opportunity to become 1% rich.  They just continuously make decisions that make themselves poor, such as smoking, not getting educated, getting pregnant, ect.  Kids of rich parents have more advantages because their parents typically put them through college, and have taught them good money skills.  I think the only way to reverse this issue is to provide early education, but I dont even think this would work.

After this get a job in the private sector, and continue to work as long as you want.  If you cant get in the military, there are other routes, that are actually better.

Unfortunately, the GOP in Oregon, supported by the hapless voters, will not allow us to raise revenue via taxes. There is no money for investment because the wealthy in this state don't want to pay their fair share. Raising the min wage addresses this issue form two angles: 1) paying people $15/hr means we won't be shelling out as much in benefits for these workers 2) the influx of capital into this wage bracket will bring the state in substantially more revenue as many of these workers are paying very little tax right now because their wages are so low. That doesn't even factor in the fact that the people getting a raise to 15 will most likely be spending almost all of that increase and this will act to stimulate the economy in a major way."
oregon,3dp9uo,Zenmachine83,2,Sun Jul 19 23:04:38 2015 UTC,"It seems like there are two parts to what you are saying: one is an economic argument that raising the min wage will cause price increases and the other has something to do with feeling slighted in some way if the min wage is raised, like maybe people making less than 15 should ""put in their dues"" or something.   I don't really feel like the second one can be addressed because I think it is a personal moral stance that, to me, does not make sense but it might be totally valid to you given your experiences.   The first part however; I am confident that there is ample evidence that a raise in minimum wage does not result in price increases or job losses. Since around 1980 workers wages have remained stagnant while executive compensation, corporate profit, and ownership stakes soared. This happened despite dramatic increases in productivity. In Oregon, in the same time, corporate and business taxes were greatly reduced, they are currently at a 40 year low. Income and that had previously gone to workers was shifted to the top while taxes paid by the wealthy and corporations was shifted to the working/middle class or eliminated--which is one of the reasons we have an underfunded state government. My overall point is that raising the min wage will be good for the Oregon economy and returning the distribution of profit seen prior to 1980 will really help working people while not injuring the wealthy.   Also, you didn't respond to how you would like to fund education. Sales tax, property tax, business tax, VAT, whatever, but the money to do the things you want has to come from somewhere and as you might have noticed over the last 10 years or so, the state is in a bit of a revenue crisis."
oregon,3dp9uo,Zenmachine83,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:16:17 2015 UTC,"Well the extra tax revenues will go into the state's general fund, of which education is one of the major outlays.   While I agree that is can be frustrating to see people make poor life choices I also try to remember that I had many opportunities to learn about the world and stable parents that modeled responsible behavior to me. Many people that are raised (not all) in a culture of poverty literally do not know how to get out. I have sympathy for single moms that are working min wage jobs, however they ended up there. Regardless of their circumstances or choices I do not think that anyone working full time should live in poverty, especially when the wealthy that own these businesses have far more than they need. But I appreciate your view of education as a major remedy to our current situation."
oregon,3dp9uo,VLDT,0,Sat Jul 18 19:44:55 2015 UTC,"I think I get where you're coming from. While I don't think $15 is as drastic as it seems, I recognize that it's double the national and at least a 50% increase of Oregon's current minimum. What do you think is a reasonable amount? $12?"
oregon,3dp9uo,VLDT,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"The low graduation rate is less about funding and more about our lax standards for students (high school kids attending half days as early as sophomore year), a glut of administrators with fewer teachers and educational support professionals in the public system (I guess that one is funding), and, yes, a lack of social support for students at home.   But you're right, we're not focusing on any really core issues of education, nor are we looking to genuinely reform healthcare, and in this sense I can see why this kind of potentially radical wage proposition can seem like a nonsensical distraction from more meaningful reform discussions that can't be targeted around a snappy movement like 15NOW.   But what if we provide access to education, but the jobs simply aren't there? I know plenty of STEM major post-grads who work hourly part-time because the market just isn't open to them. Their skills and investments are in essence going to waste. Now, you can blame it on them for not being competitive enough, not working hard enough to get better jobs, but that leans pretty hard in strawman territory, and the bottom line is that America is squandering its skilled labor market.  At the same time, it's a commonly used argument in policy-making to look at something and say, well, shouldn't we focus on this instead? And then not actually focusing on anything.    If we increased minimum wage I'd like it to be in keeping with inflation and the general cost of living increase.   This would put the number closer to $20.   But your point stands, outside of the Western Metro areas the state is largely agrarian (as are many states with the largest Metros) and thus would likely receive the immediate negative effects of a %50+ increase, and the positive outcomes would be far enough off that this might cause permanent damage to those markets and communities."

A minimum wage increase is likely to increase the wages for skilled work.   I'm also not convinced that this won't end up making everything more expensive for everyone.    Some things like services and restaurant food, potentially.   But profitable businesses have no reason to raise prices to offset the cost of higher wages beyond profit maximization, and it is likely that if one business offers a competitive good at too high a price their competitor will be able to maintain a more normalized price level. Businesses who already have leeway to raise prices would see no difference from a wage increase.   but how does throwing more money at everyone on the bottom rung help the greater good?   This comes down to the semantics of ""More money"" vs. adequate money.  From the last article:   This means that by redirecting that money pooling at the top doing comparatively very little, accumulating in ever increasing amounts through continual redistribution upwards from the bottom and middle of the income spectrum, and recirculating that clotted money back down to the bottom and middle, this would actually expand the entire economy while making it more sustainable and more inclusive. This is how the body works. This is how engines work. This is how systems work."
oregon,3dp9uo,VLDT,0,Sun Jul 19 18:42:23 2015 UTC,"I said that profitable business have no reason beyond greed to raise prices.   Have a look, have a listen.   You have some pretty hand-wavy arguments about businesses not raising prices and it really doesn't hold up.   As price goes up, demand goes down. As demand falls, producers will lower prices to follow suit. For someone operating almost entirely on Econ 101 principles, forgetting the micro law of demand is kind of a big oversight..."

Increasing the minimum wage that much though is going to have some unintended consequences. Businesses already dont like paying what people want to make and temp agencies / outsourcing is becoming more normal. Faced with having to provide so much for employees - business will give less room for wage advancement and will depend more on contract labor and services.    People want higher wages, but they dont want higher costs? How will local business manage with the increased costs while trying to stay competitive? Not everyone works for Wal Mart or Large Corporate chains. Sure big business could stand to give a little more back, but a community isnt all big business."
oregon,3dp9uo,VLDT,2,Sun Jul 19 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"How will local business manage with the increased costs while trying to stay competitive?   By reexamining their business practices and making the effort to responsibly cut costs the way businesses are supposed to. You'd be baffled by how much money most restaurants spend on wasted food product. And if consumers have more money to spend, the nominal increase in costs won't be prohibitive. Competitive businesses stay competitive."
oregon,3dp9uo,Fallingdamage,2,Sat Jul 18 23:08:37 2015 UTC,"Remember how once it was law that any business with X~ full time employees had to provide health insurance to those said employees, businesses hired more people and made everyone part time.    You're going to see similar reaction in the form of law manipulation if minimum wage is raised too much. If you have 10 employees and you pay them X amount and that amount must go up, just fire 3 of them and expect the other 7 to work harder.    Nothing in the law says you can't do that."
oregon,3dp9uo,VLDT,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:03:01 2015 UTC,"businesses hired more people and made everyone part time.   At least part timers in this case will make the same amount for fewer hours and have the spare time to work towards better job everyone seems to be jizzing themselves over.   if minimum wage is raised too much   Probably. But $15 is nowhere near ""too much"" economically. If you as a business owner think it is, it's time to really evaluate your business practices. If you can't afford to pay your employees what is in most places less than a living wage, maybe you can't afford to run a business.   just fire 3 of them and expect the other 7 to work harder.   Okay. It's difficult to define ""work harder"", especially in measurable terms. But if you can, it's more than likely you will let go your three least effective employees and work to maintain the existing workforce. The people who keep their jobs will spend more money creating jobs for the three who lost theirs. The people who work harder are rewarded. I don't see the issue.  The upshot of something like this is that it doesn't just apply to full-time employees. You'd have to pay everyone the same wage, so one realistic tack is to hire fewer people if you genuinely can't afford to keep your numbers where they are. Even if employers put people down to part time, they will make a more reasonable amount of money for their time and labor and have more time to work toward better employment.  Employers don't like turnover, it costs money, so a responsible business owner will work to keep as many good employees around. Conversely, irresponsible business owners reap what they sow.  Nothing in your post says we can't collectively benefit from a higher minimum wage."
oregon,3dp9uo,tachyonflux,2,Sun Jul 19 15:40:28 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I feel like larger businesses should be more liable for paying greater wages. I read recently that the average walmart employee brings in $220,000 per year yet on average is paid $18,000 per year. Yet senior management makes tens of millions per year. Large companies should be required to use a profit sharing model of pay. This would take the strain off small businesses that simply cant afford to do that."

We, as a state, need to start trying new approaches to the problems we face and then see which ones seem to be working the best then move in that direction. I would love to see a raising of the business/corporate taxes, an increase in tax on alcohol/tobacco, and raising the income tax rates on the wealthiest Oregonians. But raising the min wage is an effective way to do the same thing (shift wealth from the rich to the working people in our state) that requires far fewer laws to be passed."

Except it doesn't. If you increase min wage and leave tax rates the same, especially for the very wealthy, all that will happen is business owners and corporation senior management will increase the cost of their products and/or services. There is no requirement for them to reduce their own salaries to pay more into the lower level employee's salaries. The effects of this increase of both pay and cost will be felt everywhere, from increased food prices to oil changes. Your local Oregon car insurance company that has an office in Portland with 250 call center employees now has to pay those folks a lot more. Boom; your car insurance rates go up. The costs will be felt across the board.  However if we raise the tax rate of corporations and large business, and raise the income rates on those making $200k+ per year and funnel those funds into subsidized housing and food shares, that effectively lowers the cost of living for the lower and middle class. Even if corporations boosted their own pay and the cost of their goods, since it's a percentage based tax it would just further add more funds to lower the cost of living for the rest of us.  Both systems will see an increase in costs, the tax of the rich system seems better to me, imo."
oregon,3dp9uo,Zenmachine83,0,Sun Jul 19 01:12:46 2015 UTC,"One, I agree with what you are saying about raising corp taxes and income taxes. I just don't think it is going to happen. Raising the min wage seems more feasible in our current climate.   Two, evidence I have seen does not link min wage increases to price increases; the cost for the raise comes out of profits and executive compensation. Increased labor costs do not automatically equal price increases. Having run a business unit (industrial construction) I could not have just hiked my prices on a whim, my clients might have gone elsewhere. I would have taken this in a loss of profit margin 35 down to 28 or something.

It was a lot like nori jerky, but with a stronger flavor.  The kind we got was very salty and thick, twisted up like a piece of cardboard dough knot.  It had textured edges and the thickness varied, making it fun to eat.  We kept it in a jar so it wouldn't go stale with the humidity in the air.  As for flavor, actual flavor, the salt came through first.  It was a product of the sea and I knew it from the first time it touched my tongue.  Thinking back, it had a strong flavor after the salt, I want to say like deer leather but without being bitter.  I'm not sure that does it justice, but I'm not sure how to describe flavors.  It was not sweet, bitter, or sour.  It might taste like grandpa's hand if you were a kid and didn't think too badly about chewing on your grandpa.

The frustrating thing is that these events are very much manageable if the preparation is done properly.

There is even worry on how the quake will effect the volcanic Cascade mountains. We know this WILL happen in the next 100 years, most likely in your lifetime.

oregon,3d4ss8,leon_everest,2,Tue Jul 14 03:53:40 2015 UTC,"The Richter scale is a measure of magnitude that has been obsolete for years.  Earthquake magnitude for something the size we are talking about is typically expressed in moment magnitude these days and does the same job as the Richter scale.  They attempt to quantify the energy released in the earthquake. There are a few other magnitude scales that are used, mostly for small earthquakes.  An earthquake has only one magnitude no matter which scale is being used. That is, a single earthquake isn't a magnitude 9.4 in one place, and 9.0 in another.  It does, however, have multiple intensities that tend to vary with distance from the source of the earthquake.  Edit:  That infographic approximates the maximum expected felt intensity based on Richter magnitude.  How you should read it is that a magnitude 6 earthquake can produce shaking of VIII to IX intensity and lower, generally based on the distance from the quake.  Conversely, if the maximum felt intensity is, say, X, then you can estimate that the earthquake was at least a 6.5 magnitude event."

oregon,3dbjh9,Coastscribbler,2,Wed Jul 15 00:23:22 2015 UTC,"Not in as high a population though.  But the actual study isn't saying it'll happen immediately, just that by 2060 the amount of time since the last major earthquake will have been longer than 85% of the intervals between the last 41 major earthquakes at the southern margin of the Cascadia fault.   The combined stratigraphic correlations, hemipelagic analysis, and 14C framework suggest that the Cascadia margin has three rupture modes: (1) 19–20 full-length or nearly full length ruptures; (2) three or four ruptures comprising the southern 50–70 percent of the margin; and (3) 18–20 smaller southern-margin ruptures during the past 10 k.y., with the possibility of additional southern-margin events that are presently uncorrelated. The shorter rupture extents and thinner turbidites of the southern margin correspond well with spatial extents interpreted from the limited onshore paleoseismic record, supporting margin segmentation of southern Cascadia. The sequence of 41 events defines an average recurrence period for the southern Cascadia margin of ~240 years during the past 10 k.y.  Time-independent probabilities for segmented ruptures range from 7–12 percent in 50 years for full or nearly full margin ruptures to ~21 percent in 50 years for a southern-margin rupture. Time-dependent probabilities are similar for northern margin events at ~7–12 percent and 37–42 percent in 50 years for the southern margin. Failure analysis suggests that by the year 2060, Cascadia will have exceeded ~27 percent of Holocene recurrence intervals for the northern margin and 85 percent of recurrence intervals for the southern margin.    And there really was a tremendous one around January 1700, estimated as at least an 8.7."

Will the tsunami rush in and come within millimeters of the guard rail and then recede?    I live 3 miles west of I5 in south salem, on the top of a hill. If my house gets hit by the tsunami, it means all of salem and most of the santiam valley will be under 100ft of standing water.    Salem is a big bumpy, hilly place in the middle of a large flat valley. if salem is impacted, that means the willamette valley will be called the new willamette ocean, except that it will be  wall of water sitting at the west edge of I5 as if being held there by Moses.. according to all the news reports.

oregon,3d8otp,simpletrouserbeacon,8,Tue Jul 14 11:12:48 2015 UTC,"Cons: Unemployment is a very real possibility, housing costs are going up, we don't like transplants, Oregon isn't Portlandia (this is a pro for me, but a con for clueless transplants), and so on."

If you can't deal with that, move somewhere else. Oregon has a 99.999999% unemployment rate. Okay, it's actually something like 7% or so right now. Seriously, I know people who have college degrees in electrical engineering who have been unemployed for years.   You should move here because:   Oregon is fucking beautiful. You have an ass-load of home equity form your California McMansion and you want to help drive up the cost of housing in Oregon. You already have a job lined up and will not be adding to the vast hordes of unemployed people"
oregon,3d8otp,mcspdx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"""Oregon has two seasons: the summer, and the rainy season. If you can't deal with that, move somewhere else.""

oregon,3d8otp,pblood40,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:25:13 2015 UTC,"True.  Roughly 90% of the human population of Oregon lives ""Eugene and North,"" which comprises about 30% of the geographic area of the state, and fits my description.  The remaining 10% of the population lives spread out over the remaining 70% of the geographic area, which does not fit my description.  The assumption here is that somebody with a Bachelor's or Master's in Nursing would (most likely) be living with the 90% majority of the human population, where more jobs are readily available.  If OP were going into alfalfa farming, then my comments would be less applicable."
oregon,3d8otp,mcspdx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:24:52 2015 UTC,So most the state doesn't fit your description.   It's just frustrating when most people think it does.
oregon,3d8otp,pblood40,5,Wed Jul 15 13:29:34 2015 UTC,"Pros:  Oregon is absolutely beautiful.  I'm a transplant from the East Coast and I think the culture here is a lot more laid back and friendly. Kind of weird at first because strangers talk to you and stuff, but more pleasant than the East Coast ""frown in public always"" attitude. Cost of living compared to my hometown is excellent. My rent is cheaper; my pay is higher.  Very green and wild and lush, did I mention this state is beautiful? No sales tax.  You don't have to pump your own gas. Bottle return is a little bizarre but pretty fun.  It's easier and cheaper to eat healthy here than it is where I'm from.  The recycling program here in Eugene is pretty great and seems to be great in the Valley in general, less so in rural areas.  Lots of ecological diversity. You want forests? Desert? Mountains? Craggy cliffs? Wetlands? Proper sandy beaches? Grassy prairie? Oregon has it all.   Cons: It can be hard to find a job. Depending on your education/experience and where you choose to live, it might take months. I moved to Oregon in August of 2012 and didn't have a job until October of that year, and that was with job hunting full time every weekday.  We're in a location that's due for one of the most devastating natural disasters in American history, so that kind of sucks.  The rivers are too cold and rocky to swim in for a spoiled East Coast transplant like myself :/ Oregon natives can be sort of rude about transplants although I've never experienced this in person, only online.  Weed culture is annoying and ubiquitous.  Not much diversity at all so if you're a person of color you'll have to deal with that ""I'm the only POC in the room"" feeling all the time. No matter your race/ethnicity it's jarring to go from a diverse area to the very very very white state of Oregon. Eugene is super white; Portland is pretty white; Salem has a pretty large Latin@ community but otherwise it's fairly white. The coast is so white it's blinding, I have literally never seen a person of color in Southern Oregon despite traveling there regularly.   As for best place to live, that depends more on what you're looking for than anything else. Portland has a sort of ""big city"" feel while still being green and relatively clean and safe. Eugene is a mid-sized city with a more college town feel and lots of old school long hair hippies. Salem is more conservative, a little redneck, not as pretty imo. The coast is nice but generally pretty rural and finding a job in the winter might be tough. I've never been to eastern Oregon but I hear it's very rural so again it's likely you'll have a hard time finding work. I hear great things about Ashland in southern Oregon, but I haven't been yet."

Some progressives (and I count myself as a moderate one) spend too much energy attacking their conservative opponents and not enough time understanding them.

oregon,3cumlw,musicalnix,9,Tue Jul 21 19:51:53 2015 UTC,"As a fellow 25-year old who lives in Medford, I can tell you I love it, but you might not. It is by all accounts a terrible place to be single, so if you are single and looking to meet people I would recommend looking north. I'm married and have family and friends in the area so it is a good setup. Ashland is nearby and is beautiful and cultural and all that, but it's more expensive to live there if that's a concern.  Bend might be a good place to check out if you want something smaller, especially if you like outdoorsy activities."

oregon,3cumlw,mynameisntshawn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"Ashland is great, it's kind of known as the liberal hippy town in Southern Oregon. Very relaxed, chill people, typically higher income residents. Southern Oregon University is there in Ashland, although they do have a satellite campus in Medford as well. If you have the ability to live in Ashland I'd go for it. I really do love Medford, I just know it's harder for single people in general."

And I tell everyone that Toledo is a great place to be from.   Currently in Redmond, OR. Central Oregon is growing fast and finding a place to live is rough. Rent is roughly twice that on the South End/Eastside for comparative size. If you're thinking about buying, you get a house that runs 75K to 125K in Toledo for at the very least  300K in Bend. Rental vacancies are about 1-5%, housing is purchased before it's built.  Good jobs will find you fighting with national competition. We do have OSU breaking ground ""soon.""   The move was totally worth it for me. Even though I left everything behind at 38 five years ago. I've gone native with the amazing beer everywhere, beauty in all directions, great restaurants, and friendly people. Let me leave you with this  Central OR is not for you."

Coming from someone in Ohio, I have NO idea haha. Thanks again."
oregon,3cumlw,SenatorSampsonite,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:09 2015 UTC,"For your three different requests you get three different answers.   Most friendly would easily be Salem.  Lowest Crime would be Roseburg.  Decent nightlife would be Bend.   If you want something with all three, I would say your best bet is Salem, if for nothing else it's less than an hour away from Portland which has everything.   I do suggest you get a couple of options and then come over for yourself and take a look. Salem is much more of a city city, while Roseburg is more of a glorified country town. Two very different vibes. I would say 2 days trip and you should be able to stop in all 3 cities if you don't mind driving 6 hours a day."

The last burglary out this way ended badly for the crook, can't the find link but he ded. Very ded.  So the bad people don't come out this way. Or they do and leave weighing less than they did when they thought being a crook and coming out to the country was a good idea.  One of the reasons I live out here is just how convenient it is to leave a car unlocked, not have to remove anything of value (surfboards, wetsuits, fishing poles) not have to wake up wondering if I closed the shop/garage/cottage door.

Its just big enough to have things to do but small enough to never suffer traffic. There are jobs, depending on your skill set. Rent is cheap, houses are cheap, every one is friendly. Lots of nature. Rivers, lakes, the Pacific and easy access to the South Coast. We have parks, State Parks, breweries.  It rains a bit but we are a Maritime climate so rarely cold. And yes, weed is legal if its free.  All of our friends have trips or obligations so finding a sitter for the critters has been tough this year."

oregon,3cumlw,goodnightbird,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:19:21 2015 UTC,"I chose Coos Bay. I didn't just end up here, I cruised the Coast for 5 months way back in the mid 1980's, having been forced out of my job at XX XXXXX and fresh out of selling my beach house in SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.  I stayed here and there in towns and cities as I came north. I had surfed Oregon as a teen for NSSA surf contests during the 1970's.  I spent at least 10 days each in Pepperwood, Myers Flat, Ukiah, Arcata, Crescent City, Brookings, Gold Beach, Coos Bay, Newport, Nye Beach, Toledo, Otis, Pacific City, Tilamook, Astoria, Alsea, Summit, Corvallis, Oregon City, Welches, Prineville, Chemault, Blue River, Sisters, Cottage Grove, Elkton, Drain and Eugene.  I found what I wanted right here in Coos and have never looked elsewhere. I do travel for surf though in the windy months. Summers can suck on the Coast. Five miles inland its 90, right here on the water, 61. Nope."

oregon,3cumlw,goodnightbird,4,Sat Jul 11 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"If you are looking for small cities/large towns, I'm kind of partial to McMinnville or Silverton in the Willamette Valley, though Bend in Central Oregon is an upcoming spot, if you like the high desert.  But I happily live in Salem, which some people claim to be the dullest city in the state. Being the capital, it has its pluses and minuses. There's lots of government jobs, but plenty of agriculture, light industry, and education as well. However, it is small enough to make a mark in this town, and big enough to have it matter."
oregon,3cumlw,i_sometimes,2,Sat Jul 11 01:24:44 2015 UTC,"How is Salem's night life, crime and college presence if there is one ? I'm not sure haha.   Coming from someone completely out of the state, which area would you recommend more ? For a hipster, 26 year old black guy, with an education ? Bend or Salem?"
oregon,3cumlw,goodnightbird,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:23:05 2015 UTC,"Salem's night life is fairly sparse, though it has the usual clubs, I've never heard it described as ""hot."" We have the problem of being too close to Portland to develop our own scene. But then, this could be an advantage-- if we want it, it's only an hour away.  There is some crime, but it's not too bad. NE Salem and around ""Felony Flats"" (the area around the penitentiary) has a bad reputation, but you can find very nice pockets of streets just a few blocks over. There is a meth problem, but there are plenty of worse cities in Oregon.  We have a large community college, a Baptist College on the outskirts, and the well-respected Willamette University right downtown. It's not a large college, though, so it doesn't dominate the scene like in Corvallis or Eugene. There's also a Japanese international school associated with Willamette, I think.  Salem doesn't attract hipsters-- I think Bend would be better in that regard for the outdoorsy-type, young hipster. Our black community in Oregon is pretty small and mostly in the Portland area, but I haven't heard any complaints (other than the small number) from the black people I know. Since we are smack-dab in an agricultural area, Hispanics are the main minority. Bend would be similar. I think you'll find better job opportunities with your education in Salem, however. Salem is much larger and has a more stable employment base with the state government.  Bend or Salem? If satisfying employment is what you are after, go with Salem. It's not all state government, either. If it's just the hipster lifestyle and you don't care what you do to make money, Bend is a beautiful place-- the high desert will look a lot different from Ohio."
oregon,3cumlw,Nerds_Wear_Glasses,4,Tue Jul 21 20:57:16 2015 UTC,"I live in Eugene (well Springfield, but it's right next door), you don't have to live near the college or deal with renting student housing to live here. Springfield is a great option: the housing is pretty cheap, utilities are insanely cheap, lots of beautiful neighborhoods near the river or further outside of town (and plenty of scummy neighborhoods if that's more your speed), lots to do here but also only a 5 or 10 minute drive into downtown Eugene. The culture here isn't student-centric although a lot of people are really into the Ducks. There's plenty of stuff for a post-grad to do.    I would avoid the coast at all costs. The economies out there are really not doing well and finding a job is improbable. Even if you did find a job, there's nothing to do out there really because everyone else is broke."

Tourists come for the beaches and camping -- that's cool and all but for live music, movies, clubs/bars (not just dives), museums, plays, cultural events, etc. you need a decent amount of people with free time and disposable income, and you need venues, and it seems like the coast (again, in southern Oregon) doesn't have much of that to go around. I like visiting for the weekend and getting into nature and being near to ocean but if I had to live in Coos Bay/Bandon I would go crazy with boredom.   Edit: also lol at the Springfield comment"
oregon,3cumlw,Blank_Space04,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:58:09 2015 UTC,"live music, movies, clubs/bars (not just dives), museums, plays, cultural events, etc.   And living in Springfield you will most likely drive to find these events.  This weekend, The Oregon Coast Music Festival is on, thousands of people here for this longtime event.  We have Little Theater on the Bay! Oregon Coast Playhouse! Broadway Theater and Rock Hall.  Live music? We have 12 local bands that you will not need to enjoy with 200 people you don't know but listen to and dance with 30 of your new friends. Getting tickets isn't a problem.  I would mention The Casino as well, I rarely attend unless we are booked there but they get the usual Casino acts. And they get all of the bands you kids have in Eugene as well on a rotating basis. Looking at you Frown Squad.  Cultural events?  Brewfest, Crawdad Festival, Octoberfish, Clambake Festival, Oysterfest, Seafood Festival, Blackberry Arts Festival, Wine Walk every Friday all Summer, Cranberry Festival, Concerts in the Park at Mingus Park.  COOS COUNTY FAIR! Yes, ours is a big deal, we actually go and camp out there for a few days.  We have the Maritime Museum, Coos Bay Art Museum, Coos County Newspaper Museum, Coquille Valley Arts Center.  There is more I am sure but the thing is, unless you live here, you won't know about these activities.  There are many gatherings here that are word of mouth only, Summer parties up the Rivers that are three day camp outs with 2-300 people, potlucks, real community gatherings. Many of us have larger properties that can hold these kind of not so private events, free.  FreedomFest last year had 11 bands, 600 people and was a non ticketed event open to the public. Do that in Lane County and you will have helicopters over head and blockaded roads. Here? We had two Sheriffs show up for 20 minutes and leave.  Because our community is smaller, we tend to be nicer to one another, our friendships tend to be more tolerant and we tend to share more. With a smaller population, you have to be nice to every one, you will be doing business with them eventually. Ask the road raging driver who flipped me off and then came in to rent a house from us a few days later. I recognized him...nope.  Also, turn signals. City drivers don't use them cuz they are dicks, we don't use them because every one knows where we are going.  Sorry for the tldr, I get a little tired of inlanders dissing our coast."

Because I'm probably about the same age as OP (I'm 27) and I tend to think of a lot of those events you listed as being geared more towards folks in their 40s+.   I don't mean to come across as shitty, I'm just speaking from my perspective. As a person in my 20s with friends in their 20s who live in that area, it seems like they're always bored and tend to come visit the Eugene or Portland areas for entertainment."

Nothing to do because we are broke? You can't move the goal post. We don't have the perceived abundance and choices you may have, ie, clubs/bars/breweries, true.  But we make up for it in a sense of community and participation.  To your friends being 'bored', that is more on them I think than our local activities. I bet there are 'bored' people in Portland this morning. But....even I do shopping trips to Eugene every few months. And I sometimes drive through Springfield...on my way to Blue River.

oregon,3cqrqx,johnstocktonsboxers,9,Fri Jul 10 00:51:05 2015 UTC,"So the itinerary is pretty much a western Oregon trip rather than coast centric. If you are starting in Portland and intend to go back there that opens up some possibilities but if you are driving north or south on 101 then the itinerary you linked to leaves out a huge section of the south Oregon coast.  As far as north of Florence you have a number of sites I can suggest.    Newport: Rogue Brewery, Oregon Coast Aquarium, there's a number of State Park scenic viewing areas too.  Depot Bay: look for whales and whale resources here  Lincoln City: the beach is pretty boring but south of town visit Mo's on the inlet to Siletz Bay  Pacific City: Pelican Brewery, hike up the sand dune at Cape Kiwanda, nice beach too    Netarts/Oceanside: hidden gemswest of Tillamook.  Tunnel beach at oceanside should be seen.    Tillamook: Cheese Factory, Tillamook Country Smoker, Tillamook Naval Air Museum, book a sightseeing or kayak tour here.  Garibaldi: check out the cannery at the harbor for some awesome seafood, just north of town pull over and walk down to the beach at the three graces (3 large rocks in the water very close to the road)  Rockaway: ride the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad, the beach is nice too.  Tri-Cities (Wheeler, Nehalem, Manzanita): check out the Nehalem Bay Winery, Manzanita has a nice beach and an inviting community    Oswald West State Park: the quintessential Oregon beach, can be crowded but worth it.  Lots of surfing    Cannon Beach: nice, inviting, but a little gentrified but Haystack Rock is beautiful  Seaside: the West Coast's east coast beach.    Astoria: The column, Fort George Brewery, the giant bridge, maritime museum, oh and the Goonie's House!  Hope that helps!"

oregon,3cqrqx,goodnightbird,3,Fri Jul 10 15:13:08 2015 UTC,"I live in Eugene, might be a good stopping place for a night. Plenty of restaurants and bars downtown to chose from, I'm sure you could catch some live music or maybe a movie at the Bijou Metro if you guys like indie flicks. (Or David Minor if you're cool with watching something more mainstream but that's been out for awhile.) And maybe get ice cream at Red Wagon, they're excellent. In the morning do breakfast/brunch at Off the Waffle or Braill's. Stop at Voodoo Donuts here, you'll be in line for less than a minute probably versus the hour you'd spend in line in Portland. Bring cash, they don't take cards.   Aside from downtown you could also check out the campus around UO. Lots of restaurants over there too, plenty of bars, nice walking areas, some interesting shops. The art museum is interesting; the natural history museum isn't really worth checking out.   If you're into hiking there are tons of trails around here. I don't hike so Google would be a better resource for you than I will, lol.   If you want to ask about anything feel free!  Edit: oh yeah and if you do wind up in coastal southern Oregon the dinosaur thing is a kind of fun silly diversion but overpriced imo, Bandon Cheese Factory (I think that's what it's called...) has shockingly good sandwiches, there's a really neat bookstore in downtown Bandon, The Human Bean is obnoxiously named but their coffee is delicious (I know they're a chain but we don't have them in the Eugene area), and everyone raves about the hot dogs at Langlois Market though I've yet to try one.   Some advice: when you're at the coast make sure you've got clothes that are good for wind and chill, I always seem to forget and pack skirts which never goes well. The beaches up here aren't friendly warm stretches like in California or most of the East Coast, they're craggy and cold and foggy and usually hard to get to. They're absolutely beautiful, though.

Also great is the taco truck whose name is actually unknown to me, but located at that street view link and they serve great food for super reasonable prices. Kind of in the area but more in the Clatsop county area is Saddle Mountain, which if you are into hiking is a pretty and nice hike. Start early and get plenty of water.  If you have an evening in Astoria, the Voodoo Room and Columbian Theater serves great pizza, great drinks and generally have good movies on a quaint single screen.  All of these three things above are cash-only though, so just be prepared."

You're going to do a lot of driving, but try to minimize it the best you can. You will be overwhelmed.  As for the coast, stay in Newport. Its centrally located where you can do day trips south (Florence) and north (Pacific City) with a bunch of stuff to see in between. 101 is a slow road in the summer (RVs).  One coastal hike I'd suggest is Cape Lookout - 700ft peninsula with coastal views north and south. Google it. Eat and drink at the Pelican Brewery when you're done."

For example, the state government is the trustee of the Willamette River. If, for example, the government was allowing the city of Eugene to dump its sewage in the river due to some loophole in the regulations, any affected citizen could sue and force the state to stop letting Eugene ruin the river because the state has to, as the trustee, preserve the value of the river.   The plaintiffs in this case are arguing that the climate is also held in public trust so the same fiduciary obligations apply to the state. The argument goes, because of climate change, the government is failing to act sufficiently against the destruction of a public resource (the climate) so the judge should compel them to do so."

But hey, let's give out free Community College instead of fixing our high schools.

When driving to Hood River from Portland, take the Historic Columbia River highway.  There are a lot of waterfalls and trails along it.  That's a lot of driving.

It's right across the freeway from Bonneville dam, which the kids might enjoy, and down the freeway a piece from Hood River, which has plenty of food/lodging options.    Personally I'd make it part of a loop including Mt Hood (Timberline lodge), Multnomah Falls and Crown Point Vista House(world's coolest rest stop). That would make a pretty decent day.  You could then carry on to Portland and/or the coast."

oregon,3c1l2k,JT_Schwazey,3,Fri Jul 3 22:34:51 2015 UTC,"Take some time to camp in the south sister or middle sister wilderness while your in Bend. If your interested in climbing a mountain, the south sister is a very non-technical hike (and beautiful at the top!). It can be done in a day. It's a total of 12 miles (6 one way).  You can also backpack in and spend the night at either Green lakes or Moraine Lake, both of which are at the base of the mountain.  If you wanted to hike in, spend the night, then summit the mountain the next day (this is my favorite way to do it, you're not as rushed) I would backpack into green lakes the first night and camp, then summit the south sister on day two via hiking to Moraine lake, which sits on the trail to the top of the mountain.  http://alltrails.com/trail/us/oregon/green-lakes  Smith Rock is another cool place that hasn't already been mentioned. A must see if you like rock climbing.  http://traveloregon.com/see-do/attractions/outdoors-nature/smith-rock/  My last suggestion would be to hike the Wahkeena falls-Multinomah falls loop in the Columbia gorge. It's about an hour east of Portland and can be done in a day. This is highly worth doing. Multinomah falls is amazing, and something most people will tell you to see. But most people just climb to the top of the falls, turn around, and leave. Don't do this!  There is a beautiful loop hike, with lots more falls, hidden away back behind it. My suggestion:  Start at Wahkeena falls, west of Multinomah falls. From there hike the loop and finish by coming up to Multinomah falls from the back. There's a quick little train that follows the road from Multinomah falls back to the Wahkeena falls trailhead when you're ready for your car.  http://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Multnomah-Wahkeena_Loop_Hike  If you want a book full of Oregon hikes, get one written by William Sullivan.  He's really good at given good driving directions (some place can be tricky to get to) and has tons of good hikes/camps/backpacking trip ideas.

Other than that,  down in Corvallis. I haven't traveled too far east (further than Bend) or south (further than Eugene). Our specialty here is drink (we have 6 or seven brewpubs here), ride bikes (tons of trails winding in and out of town and country side), travel to the beach (Newport is a 45 minute drive), or even hike up Mary's Peak (tallest ""mountain"" on the coastal range.

But the real attraction are the things you'll see cruising up 101. If you climb Humbug Mountain (the tallest on the coast, it plunges into the Pacific), know that I've made the climb wearing a kilt. Between North Bend and Florence you should take some time in the Oregon Dunes (the largest in North America). Inland, you'll want to take a walk through the Oregon Caves (Cave Junction), and the Shakespearean Theater in Ashland.  I wouldn't bother much with the Willamette Valley, as it has become tragically homogenized with a patina of cool due to millions of folks moving in and watering down the weird.

Here's a definition of sale in measure 91 (though it's not clear that this applies to everything):   ) As used in sections 31 to 44 of this Act, “sale” or “sold” means any transfer, exchange or barter, in any manner or by any means, for a consideration, and includes and means all sales made by any person.

The whole point of working and earning money is to spend it so you can live - don't employ human beings if you're not willing to pay them a fair enough amount for them to do this. And if your fear is that ""prices will rise"" and so we should never raise wages, then that's just a tacit admission that the structure of our economic system sucks and should be redesigned. This argument is basically an argument against capitalism as we know it. ""Don't raise wages, then people will actually be able to buy stuff! You know, the stuff that our business makes."""
oregon,3bpdjv,Kalapuya,4,Wed Jul 1 21:58:12 2015 UTC,"This has been proven to be inaccurate several times over.  Yes, the prices will rise. Depending on the items in question they will rise by as little as a fraction of a penny (say, for a can of corn) and as much as a dollar (say, for a 60"" 4K HDTV). You're not wrong, you're just painting this as if it were some kind of horrible doomsday scenario that it simply isn't.

The result of the higher minimum wage is that this job is no longer economically viable unless you can make the job more efficient through some sort of investment in capital.   Previously, there wasn't the need to worry about automation, because the economics of the job were sound, and that entry level position was a great way to recruit and test out employees for higher value/paying jobs.   But, instead, you're going to hire an experienced machine operator, paying 18 sn hour to do what 4 people uses to do. Or maybe 8 down to one.   Now, is a small business going to be the one likely able to affordlabor saving equipment, or is it the large corporation? I think it's more likely to favor the latter.   Is that really what you want?

There are certain skills that will more than likely never be replaced by machinery. Also, this isn't an assured future, it hasn't been proven true, and there is nothing to suggest it would actually happen. You're either buying into a scare tactic or using it yourself to try and scare people out of doing the right thing.   Look at it this way: say you have some employees at minimum wage or say 12 per hour (of employment cost to the company) to produce 15 of benefit per hour.   I refuse to look at it that way, because that is absolute nonsense. If an employee earning $12 an hour was only producing $15 of benefit per hour, they would not be employed and the company more than likely would not be in business. $3 an hour isn't enough profit to run any business. Even McDonalds employees are earning roughly 10-20 times more for the company in an hour than they are earning themselves. Jesus, do you even economics, bro?   The result of the higher minimum wage is that this job is no longer economically viable unless you can make the job more efficient through some sort of investment in capital.   What in God's Holy name are you blathering about?   Previously, there wasn't the need to worry about automation, because the economics of the job were sound, and that entry level position was a great way to recruit and test out employees for higher value/paying jobs.

Now, is a small business going to be the one likely able to afford labor saving equipment, or is it the large corporation? I think it's more likely to favor the latter.   So you're saying small businesses would then be more likely to employ people instead of automation than big businesses would? And this would be a problem because...what, they wouldn't be able to afford to use technology that would supposedly allow them to earn more money than with the help of an employee? It wouldn't put them out of business, though, it would just supposedly make earning money more difficult in this fantasy world where machines have taken over. Perhaps you should go watch Terminator Genesys instead of typing up diatribes on Reddit.   Is that really what you want? An accelerated, government mandated elimination labor?   Nope, and thankfully that wouldn't happen just because of a raise in minimum wage. If the minimum wage had increased with inflation, it would be something like $20/hr (which it should be). These guys are suggesting raising it to $15/hr, a wage that you might be able to survive on without going into debt – and debt is a huge problem for a lot of people in this country, isn't it? The more in debt we are, the worse off the country is overall.   Edited to add: your closing statement of everyone being able to afford slightly higher prices is inaccurate. The people who still have jobs who aren't self employed will be fine. Those who lose jobs will be screwed.   In your imaginary dream world, those who lose jobs will be barely capable of affording that can of creamed corn, which will see the lowest price increases. I fail to see how the poorest Americans could possibly suffer from a minimum wage increase, and you have failed to support your claims with any kind of evidence or even logical economic foundation.

oregon,3bt7gf,TeamThreeTrees,3,Wed Jul 1 23:13:43 2015 UTC,"There are probably going to be a lot of dispensaries popping up int he next 12 months. Most people who already 'do' know where they will be going and who is involved.    Something I think would be cool to see would be an alternate-alternate smoke shop. Most dispensaries and clinics I have visited always seem to have a hippie/earthy/stoner vibe. Always hipster looking employees with a beard or 5 o'clock shadow, one of them is usually stoned, and its always dimly lit or adequately lit.    As normal as that is to people in this culture, MJ is legal now and will bring a lot more 'latent' customers out. I think having a very professional approach might appeal to some of the cleaner, higher class customers that dont want to be found in 'head shops' but wouldn't mind a nice 'Medical Glass' store - if you get my meaning.    Example: I have been to a small handful of adult shops in my life. its not my thing, but I have need to stop at them on rare occasion to pickup something, etc.. Honestly, they gross me out. The staff are always creepy, the layout and decor is tacky, I feel like im going to get an std from the door handle, and the people lurking around give me the creeps. - The other day I stopped in at Eve's botique to pick up something for my wife and was very impressed. It felt like I was walking into a department store. The staff were all formally dressed, wore little headsets, knew the products very well and spoke to you like a customer, not a guy with a craving. The lighting was good, everything was clean as a whistle, and I saw other people dressed like 'professionals' perusing their aisles.    I think that if there was a smoke shop that was run like this, a place the white collars could feel good about stopping by, that would offer a comfortable experience in a retail language they understand, it would go far for your business.    I think that opening just another 'stoner lounge' is going to be tough with all the competition. Open a store that attracts the people that wouldnt go otherwise."

It is feasible that a turf field will be installed and bleachers brought in, and Lane United FC could be playing there as early as next season (starts in May).

I have read many reviews of the area, as well as personal experiences from random travellers. It's definitely on my list. As for the springs themselves, it would seem that some were pissed it went from free to $5/day, but with that said, the facilities have become much more maintained and there's actually somebody that lives on site. Final caveat, specifically regarding my comment about weirdos. I read a review (running out the door, but will find it later and post a link) from a couple who claimed they were harassed by some drunken locals, who then chased them (in cars) for miles before finally giving up. The couple had left their tent and some supplies back at a camp away from the springs, but were too afraid to drive there that night as they thought they were being followed still. Said it was the scariest night they'd ever had. So... you know, have fun, but use caution. :-)"
oregon,3bljxx,chronicENTity,2,Wed Jul 1 03:01:18 2015 UTC,"Why not have exactly the ""oh, this looks like a nice spot to camp"" experience? My understanding is that generally, on Forest Service and BLM land you can camp in any area that's not prohibited, for free. Get a good set of state maps so you know where those areas are. Basic courtesy and safety rules apply (pack out all your refuse, bring the gear you need to get you and your vehicle out of any likely mishaps, etc.).  It can be a little hit-and-miss but soon you'll have some beautiful places up your sleeve that only you and maybe a couple local loggers/ranchers know about."

In Ashland housing is higher and job salaries are higher. But there still are not a lot of jobs available. Then you have places like Coos Bay where 50%+ of the population is below the poverty line.   The hardest part isn't so much the salary, but is a matter of jobs available. That part of Oregon tends to stay in the 10%-12% unemployment range even during good times.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see.

You'll mostly just grab a growler from Boneyard - they have a micro-sized tasting room - standing room only. Diablo Rojo is a really good red from Boneyard and their swag (like tshirts etc) has cool designs.   If you want to visit Deschutes just because it's well-known then go for it but it's not a great example of Oregon beer.   Ninkasi is great but don't miss Oakshire just a few blocks from Ninkasi.

If you just want a quick stop and look, you can go right to the falls, but my suggestion would be to stop before Multinomah Falls at Wahkeena Falls.  You can take the trail that loops from there and enjoy a really beautiful hike that ends by coming down Multinomah Falls.  There's a short connecting trail along the road that gets you back to the car.

Population is an interesting mix of Anglo, Hispanic, and Native American. Schools can be rough, but have recently made some gains. Hispanic population does make for some quality Mexican food in town, if you are into that.   It does have a fairly low cost of living, if you are going there for work you can save some money if you do it right.   Proximity to slightly more interesting Redmond and fairly awesome Bend is a good thing.

Soft serve news is a great one- http://www.softservenews.com/  However, in order to see/capture them, the KP index level has to be reasonably high. The camera sensor is much more sensitive than the human eye, so while you might not be able to discern them that well, the camera can. I believe that the KP index number has to be around 6-7 to have a good chance of visibility down here in Oregon. Forecasts can't be predicted too far in advance, so if a storm is predicted, you might just need to take a chance. Good luck!"
oregon,3bb5t4,whitehaitian,2,Sat Jun 27 15:16:41 2015 UTC,I am torn on this. On one hand I am all for legal pot sales and getting it to market as fast as we can. On the other this gives a HUGE advantage to Medical Dispensaries (MD) and puts retail shops at a big disadvantage. MDs have an existing supply chain and location and now a state given market advantage.   Retail shops on the other hand are going to be competing with established businesses. It will be an uphill battle.   Either way as soon as I can buy some legally I probably will. This is just more of a philosophical dilemma.
oregon,3bb5t4,alwaysgetdownvoted,3,Sun Jun 28 03:38:22 2015 UTC,I don't think that the plan is for MD to maintain retail sales once retail licenses get issued. From what I understand it's a bandaid for the situation

They are setup for patients, not for the long lines they will have to face when the public wants in on it.    The law says they can, but does the law allow for more inventory and allow growers to increase yields to handle the influx?"
oregon,3bb5t4,Mejari,5,Sat Jun 27 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"The market is over saturated and dispensaries need the income. I don't think there will be much of a shortage issue. Prices may stay the same, unless dispensaries charge more just because. If they do this, I would hope they charge $1-3 a gram more for recreational to help ensure the cost does not go up for medical.   We will see. Either way, I don't see it likely being a big problem."

Feeding the corporate beast more data and dollars isn't best for our kids or schools.  If enough opt out, maybe it will bring about systemic change and help to turn our schools around instead of lumbering down a George Bush era path of ""everyone will learn if we just test them more.""  Taught in Oregon for 15 years and the testing went from less than two days for all tests to a process that spread out over multiple weeks, and didn't do anything more to help kids learn.

McDonalds is actually a pretty decent place to start because they're everywhere. You could start at 17 in your hometown, and if you decide to go to university, the company probably help you move to a new location and give you reasonable hours to accommodate your studies. I know several people who did that all through school and they all came out with very little student loan debt and work experience that helped them down the road."

Total waste of time. It would be better to ski/board Timberline on Mt Hood which is open year round.   I don't think you left enough time for all the trip but too late for that.   In Seattle skip going up the Needle and instead head to Kerry park in Queen Anne for a great view including needle. Get burger at Uneedaburger. Walk around UW.  In Oregon, if you've seen 2 or 3 coast towns you've seen them all. I recommend you invest time in Hood as mentioned or the Gorge (do Multnomah - it's a drive up thing - and then I think Eagle Creek trail which takes you to Punchbowl falls and a ton more falls depending how far you hike).   if you like beer, try breweries in PDX such as Deschutes, Burnside, etc.  I live in Eugene and it has many great ones too like Oakshire, Falling Sky, Hop Valley.  Do Crater Lake for sure but be aware the rim drive can be a bit unnerving sometimes and there may be wild fires. When I went it was so smoky, was hard to see. If you do CL. SWIM IN IT. It's really not that bad.   Tillamook cheese factory (north coast) is popular but I think Bandon has one too.  You can see live sea lions at Newport or the Sea Lion caves. Eat at Local Ocean. Skip Mo's.  If you go through Pacific City hit up the brewery. I forget name... Cape Kiwanda? It has a pelican.   Ok that's all I got for ya! enjoy our lovely state.

oregon,3b4vnh,sheseeksthestars,2,Fri Jun 26 01:10:55 2015 UTC,"I second the Oregon notes.  For example: If you have time, loop from Seattle around west and enter Oregon via Astoria. Then go down the coast a bit and see Seaside/Cannon Beach/Manzanita/Tillamook. From Tillamook head back to Portland and do Portland-y things (beer, food, bikes, donuts, etc). Then do a loop east out the Columbia River Gorge, south around Mt Hood, down to Bend (more beer!), then down to Crater Lake. If you feel like it, go back up towards Eugene, otherwise just head south by Shasta and into California.  Everything east of Bend in Oregon isn't particularly interesting (unless you go up to the Wallowas), and the I-5 corridor isn't particularly interesting either. Its all the stuff in between that deserves attention."

oregon,3b4vnh,comradesugalumps,2,Fri Jun 26 11:55:01 2015 UTC,"If you're beer and outdoor lovers then I would recommend hitting hood river, and then driving the gorge through to Portland. After that take 26 all the way to the coast, Seaside is a pretty nice quaint little touristy town. Then head south on 101 hit Tillamook, might as well see the cheese factory to see what the fuss is all about. Across the street is a super fun little golf course with an 18 hole real grass putting course. Pelican pub now has a restaurant in Tillamook too, and its near a hipster little brewery called de garde which people are raving about. Hit the beaches while you're there. Ocean side is popular, but there are a lot more too. The schooner is a pretty great restaurant if you aren't set on Pelican Pub. Then I would continue down 101. Some of the most beautiful towns, beaches, and hole in the wall restaurants. Stop in Florence like others suggested. Please skip sandboarding. I'm a huge snowboarder and was so excited about sandboarding, but I was sorely dissapointed. Get some quads, or a dune buggy, really fun."

I took him through the Cascades (the mountain range right in the middle of the state, see Highway 97) and not the coast.   The cascades have Multnomah Falls, Mt Hood, Bend/Sunriver, Three Sisters, rafting, Smith Rock. And then of course Crater Lake is much more accessible when you are already in the central portion of the state.  On the way from Crater Lake to Redwoods, stop in Ashland for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. This is one of those unique things that attracts people from out-of-state.   Also, Mt St Helens > Rainer. It will be unlike anything you've ever seen in the US. This spot/trail is my favorite. Though a hike to the crater rim is preferred, if you can swing it."
oregon,3b4vnh,sheseeksthestars,2,Fri Jun 26 04:13:40 2015 UTC,"If you do go to Coos Bay, check out Sunset Bay, Shore Acres and Cape Arago state parks.  Three right in a row, all with a slightly different feel.  Sunset Bay is kind of family oriented, lots of kids running around, volleyball courts, stuff like that.  I stepped on a yellowjacket nest there when I was a kid.  Anyway, it's a very sheltered little bay, good for wading into if you're there on a warm day.  Good for looking at if it's not so hot.  Shore Acres was the home of an early timber baron Louis Simpson.  The park has rose test gardens, a big Japanese style lily pond.  There's also a beach/cliff area here with a pretty spectacular view.  Cape Arago is, in my opinion, the most beautiful park on the coast.  It has sweeping vistas that are really unlike anything on the north or central coast.    You can rent a boat and go crabbing, which of course you could do in a few other towns on the coast, but the crabbing is better in Coos Bay than anywhere else.  Dock crabbing is also available and they'll cook it up for you too.  Or get a kayak and paddle around the south slough estuary, which is beautiful and serene.  There's also an interpretive center there and a couple easy hikes around in the woods, right up to the waters edge.  You can also find plenty of places to rent a horse and ride on the beach.  That's pretty cool too.  If you do plan to rent a dune buggy, I recommend doing that in the Hauser area rather than what somebody suggested above, in Florence.  Since fewer people make it down that far south, there are fewer idiots looking to run into you, but that's just my opinion.  Further south, in Gold Beach, take a jet boat up the Rogue River, have lunch in Agness.  This is an absolutely fantastic day trip and one you'll never forget.  For me, it's the best looking area in the world. Last time I was there, we saw a black bear, about a million deer and a couple elk.  I have seen one cougar in my life, right outside Agness, but it wasn't in a boat, but that's a possibility too.  It's absolutely amazing.  If I had to live in a truly small town, it would be Agness.  If you do end up going from Crater Lake to Arcata, one route you could look into is the Redwood Highway, which is beautiful by itself.  Just outside of Cave Junction is Oregon Caves.  It's super cool and a fairly quick to get through.  If it's a really hot day, it can be a great hour or so of natural air conditioning.  Anyway, sounds like a fun trip, hope you like it!"

I figure you're smart enough to realize that but not everyone is apparently.   There's lots of great things to do on the coast, but all the towns are smallish, so there's not a huge variety between them in my experience.  Here are some of the good things on the coast I know of (that I've done or heard of):   visit the Goonies house in Astoria visit Hug Point - it's an old road for stage coaches that goes around the cliffs overhanging the water. This can only be done at lowest monthly tide. All other times of the month it's covered by water.  explore the Dunes near Florence, it's some sort of preserve,  state or national can't remember. ride ATVs (be careful!) fly kites  horseback riding (various stables in coast towns) eat fresh seafood - if you don't live near the ocean, now is your chance walk around Old Town-seems like most towns have one. I know Newport and Florence do. visit the sea lion caves - hold your nose...   Now since Angry McSnappypants was so offended maybe he can add to this list and be constructive.  (Also - Eugene is 61 miles from the coast. Well within 100.)"
oregon,3b4vnh,sheseeksthestars,-5,Fri Jun 26 11:50:19 2015 UTC,"explore the Dunes near Florence, it's some sort of preserve, state or national can't remember.   Lol, keep digging. At least this vague reference has something to do with nature rather than ""hamburger, beer, hurr durr...""  Any one who flies from 3000 miles away and gets told to tour neighborhoods in Portland, see the Space Needle from a distance...and drink beer...but skip a Coast that thousands of tourists from all over the world come to...oh geez.  Its hilarious and quite offensive that you dismiss such a large part of Oregon.  But then again, Eugene is so famous for...what? Nike? That drunk runner who killed himself in a car crash? (lol, kidding, he was from Coos Bay so...) Oregon Country Fair?  Help me out here, there must be something memorable?  Eugene isn't anything more than Portland's stoned little brother.  Hope you enjoy melting today, its supposed to be a balmy 75 degrees here in the ""seen one, seen them all"" coastal town."
oregon,3b4vnh,dallywolf,2,Fri Jun 26 12:45:25 2015 UTC,"Look, I know it's convenient for you to harass me about not remembering the details about the Dunes, but did you even read the rest of the post? As for burgers, they said they liked good food, and I thought that restaurant had good food. How exactly is that a problem? They're doing most of the west coast in less than 2 wks, they don't really have time to do a big old backpacking or camping trip, which is what I would have suggested if they had more time or weren't going so far.   Again, if you have favorite things about the coast, then POST THEM. Yeah I don't live there, so I posted the things I DO know about it, and like. Saying the towns are similar is not the same as saying ""don't go to the coast"", and in fact in the same post I said that I still mentioned some things many people like to do at the coast. Maybe if you actually post some advice,  it'll be really great since you live there and know the best parts of it. Then we can all enjoy the coast that much more, including me!   Good try at trying to offend me by insulting Eugene, but I really don't care. I am also not even in Eugene right now, so... yeah. Sorry, no. Won't be melting.   Calm down."

But I also don't think it's unreasonable to expect someone to visit literally every town in a region before forming an opinion. I mean, that's just not how things work. People form opinions based on their experiences.  My experience is with basically every town north of Florence. If the southern coast is a secret gem they are welcome to point out all the reasons I'm wrong. That's the point of a forum.   Notice also I very clearly have visited the coast, and said in town, not on the beaches or in surrounding nature which is what that other guy seemed to deem superior. At the end of the day that's an opinion, and it's ridiculous and unacceptable to call someone a cunt, deny that they know anything or have traveled anywhere in the state they have always lived in and harass them just because they don't like the beach towns and saying so hurt your feelings   Imagine if this was in person.

oregon,3b4vnh,i_sometimes,4,Fri Jun 26 04:51:25 2015 UTC,"Your plan for 9/2 seems a little ambitious-- Coos Bay to Arcata via Crater Lake? This could be tough since you will be driving through mountains. Crescent City isn't much to see if you stop there, but the redwood groves between there and Arcata are some of my favorites. I fear if you get all the way to Arcata/Eureka you'll miss the best times to see the trees. Check out Trinidad Head if the day is sunny and the fishing fleet is out. Whoops, I guess I'm leaking into California now."
oregon,3b4vnh,lurkmode_off,-1,Fri Jun 26 04:00:36 2015 UTC,"Nothing like 430 miles a day in a car. A straight shot to Arcata is 200 miles and 4.5 hours from here in Coos. Its 170 miles to Crater Lake from Coos, Crater Lake to Arcata is 240 miles. Its doable though because 74 miles of that drive will be on I5, the rest is two lane highway. Heck, they could spend at least 30 minutes at Crater Lake and still get to Arcata by 9 pm. If they leave Coos Bay/Bandon by 7 am.  Also, you say Redwood groves between Crescent City and Arcata? Aside from the top of the hill south of Crescent City, there are no 'groves' to speak of til Avenue of the Giants, 40 miles south of Arcata.  Yes, you can see clear cuts and Prairie Creek State Park does have some tree's, even find a few smaller Redwoods around False Klamath Cove but nothing like the area from Scotia to Leggett.  Not Oregon?  The Great State of Jefferson disagrees.  I have said it before and I will type it out again, Portland/Eugene redditors really need to shut the fuck up about the Coast, you embarrass yourselves. The dismissive comments, the outright lack of local knowledge coming from those who may have once driven from Florence to Brookings...its tiring.  The advice given in this thread is among the worst I have seen and you kids know we get these questions often.  I am a bit surprised you people haven't sent these kids through Klamath Falls.  Sorry K-Falls, love ya!"

Drive the Columbia River Scenic Byway from Troutdale to Horsetail Falls; there are half a dozen waterfalls in between. All are very short walks from parking to falls, but many also offer longer hikes if desired. You can do it in the morning and be back in Portland for lunch.  It's ok to give the Willamette Valley a miss. If you're outdoorsy, stick to the mountains, and if you live somewhere without ocean access, spend your time on the coast."

(But I like Latourell better.) If you want to get near Mount Hood, I highly recommend Trillium Lake. It's stunning. Case and point. It's also only an hour and fifteen minutes from Portland.  In Portland you should check out Forest Park, the Rose Garden, and take a bike ride along the esplanade around sunset. All stunning. Then check out some of the cute neighborhoods like NW 23rd, Alberta, Mississippi, and Belmont. Good eats in all those areas."

Second, the Oregon Caves farther south are a really cool stop as well. It is a nice stop and you can check out and take a tour deep into some really cool caves.   Third (time permitting), Hells Gate jet boating excursions up the Rogue River. You can do half day or full day trips that are pretty fun, especially if you get a fun boat captain and a fun people on the boat with you.   Oregon is a pretty cool place.

oregon,3b4vnh,Dweller,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:24:31 2015 UTC,"I know it's long! Bear with me! :)  My recommended Oregon tour for first timers. Links provided at the end.  Portland, Columbia River Gorge, coast OR Eugene, Crater Lake, Ashland  Portland: Arrive on the night of 29th, go to a brewery with some live music, OR check out a free Movie in the Park night (Spring Garden Park featuring ""Back to the Future"").  30th - Portland tour: downtown including Pioneer Square, the Waterfront Park, and Powell's Books. Skip Voodoo Doughnuts; so overrated. If it's hot take a dip in the Keller Fountain. In the afternoon check out a brewery tour or do some window shopping on Hawthorne or Belmont. In the evening, go to dinner at the Portland City Grill and check out the awesome view.  31st - Columbia Gorge tour: Head down Interstate 30 and check out the amazing views, awesome waterfalls, and gorgeous river. Skip Multnomah Falls (it's going to be extremely crowded in the summer and just not worth it), but I do recommend Latourell Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and Horsetail Falls. Check out Crown Point/Vista House if you have time. If you're up for a little more adventure you could take a boat tour down the Columbia. In any case, bring your swim gear. August is river swimming season in Oregon!  1st - Eugene tour: Zip down I5 in the morning (2 hr drive). If you guys are into football, check out Autzen Stadium. If you're into shopping, poke around downtown. If you're looking for nature, then all you need to do is look around. Eugene has many, many nature areas. Hendricks Park has a huge rhododendron garden and excellent trails; Alton Baker has some awesome walks along the Willamette, including many spots where you can jump in the low-running water; Spencer's Butte provides some astounding views (and a pretty good hike); Mt. Pisgah also has some great views, and the hike is easier. Eugene also has some of my favorite restaurants in the state: Papa's Soul Food, Off the Waffle, Holy Cow, Sweet Basil Thai. And many others! There is also wine tasting, kayaking, and free live music around Eugene. Eugene's a great, great place to visit in the summer (especially while the students are gone!).  OR  1st - Coast tour:There are several routes to choose from, but keep in mind that driving down the coastal highway takes a lot, lot longer than driving down the I5. I would recommend skipping the coast this trip because of the time crunch. Your original plan is going to involve AT LEAST 6 hours of driving (in good conditions and minimal traffic) from Portland to Cannon Beach to Coos Bay. Even if you left at 8am, arrived at the beach around 10, you would only have a couple hours to spare for fun if you want to make it to Coos Bay by 9pm. The rest of the time you'd be driving down slow, windy coastal roads, getting stuck in traffic because, remember, this is peak tourist season on the coast.   Now I'm not saying that you shouldn't go to the coast, but I would highly, highly recommend going at another time when you have days to camp, hike, explore, and enjoy the scenery. A one-day whirlwind tour will make the coast seem like an awful place.   2nd - Crater Lake to Ashland: If you're coming from Eugene, about a 2+hr drive. From Coos Bay, a 3+hr drive. I haven't been to CL in a long, long time, so check out other people's recommendations for what to see and do. Please keep in mind that wildfire warnings and closings could be in effect.  After Crater Lake in the morning, head down to Ashland for dinner (1.5+hr drive). I'm adding Ashland because it's A) super, super beautiful, B) is close to California, and C) has a really unique culture. It is home to the world-renowned Shakespeare Festival, which will be going on in September. Check out their website for shows that night. In addition to the festival there are some really nice places to eat, drink, and sleep.    3rd - Ashland to California: Ashland is a few minutes drive away from CA. You'll be heading down the I5 and you can easily go anywhere from there.   Now, one more recommendation and then I'll be done. If you take a day away from your California trip, or take out the 3 days in Napa entirely, you'd have a lot more time to dedicate to a coast trip, Mt Hood trip, or added time to any of the places in Oregon. I've visited Napa and while it is worth seeing, it's more of a day trip thing in my book. There's some good wine tasting there but there is also good wine tasting in the Willamette Valley (I may be a bit  biased, however). San Francisco is definitely worth a 3 or 4-day tour, but the rest of California IMO is kinda meh. Then again, I've been in Oregon my whole life, so again with the biases.

oregon,3b4ig6,abdalalim1982,3,Thu Jun 25 22:14:59 2015 UTC,"Is overnight camping allowed on Oregon Coast beaches?  Overnight camping is allowed on sections of the Oregon Coast, not adjacent to Oregon State Parks, not within the city limits of Cannon Beach, Lincoln City, Seaside, Newport, Bandon, Gold Beach, Rockaway Beach and Manzanita.  This includes overnight sleeping in tents, driftwood shelters, sleeping bags, recreational vehicles, trailers, or automobiles, nor where there are signs posted prohibiting camping.  The places where one can camp on the beach tend to be remote , far from the road and not accessible by automobile.  If you choose to make camp on the beach, be prepared to break camp on request and always practice beach safety.  So basically if you are out of city limits and in the boonies it's OK. It's fire season so be careful.. also keep an eye on where the high tide mark is :)  The reality is you can get away with it in most places if you are discrete .. fire is the big issue.

If I had to choose either, I'd go with the latter. There's an amazing pizza place down by the wharf. As for along I-5, it can get really boring. Ashland is great, don't miss Caldera Brewing.

Worse, there are portions Congress can't read until 6 months after they take effect. There are big questions as to whether that's constitutional and it's certainly insane.

oregon,3asksq,Alch3mistf,0,Tue Jun 23 04:16:22 2015 UTC,I am not saying dishwashers do not work as hard as a server/bartender but to try and even out a playing field and take away the servers incentive for tips seems wrong.   Servers are the sales staff of the restaurant.   They should be the most knowledgeable about what they serve and they should care about it.   To limit them to $18/hr is disincentive.    I like minimum wage being higher but to limit a salesperson from selling more and not making extra for it is not right.     I will be curious to see how things work out here.
oregon,3asksq,dancingbear77,3,Tue Jun 23 08:51:27 2015 UTC,"You make a good point, but this is how it works in other nations, no?

oregon,3asksq,SumoSizeIt,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:53:59 2015 UTC,Yes in Germany and other countries it does work that way.  But to your point they don't pay for healthcare or college.   I didn't see anything about those benefits being offered.  Also it says he will get better servers cause they are not jet looking for the tip/table.   If servers aren't making 20+ with tips your not going to get good servers.  But you might have the best dishwashers in town.
oregon,3asksq,dancingbear77,2,Tue Jun 23 16:10:21 2015 UTC,"Servers are starting at $18 an hour, nowhere in the article does it mention a cap of this sort. I'm sure they will still make raises like at any other job. And I think the incentive to work there is this significantly higher starting pay, and the more ""career-focused"" nature of the positions. Seems like an interesting business model that I can get behind. The no-tipping system has worked well in Europe, I'm not sure what would stop it from being successful here."
oregon,3asksq,hawaiimtt,0,Thu Jun 25 16:06:29 2015 UTC,I see your point.   As a server at a brewery right now I average $18/hr not including my $9.25 minimum wage.  I am incentivized to give good service to my customers in order to make more tips.   This system also allows the business to staff more help with out it costing to much.   Which need menu prices reasonable and the business profitable.   On the service aspect I would be worried that labor costs would eventually need to be cut in order to make money.  This would only sacrifice service and stress the staff out.    I am curious to see how it works but I am not a fan as of right now.

oregon,3aroa2,ABrownBlackBear,2,Thu Jun 25 22:38:45 2015 UTC,Oh hi!  Do you know what the population numbers of the Oregon tribes are now and if they have been increasing or decreasing?
oregon,3aroa2,monkeypause,3,Fri Jun 26 03:13:54 2015 UTC,"Good question. There are semi-recent numbers here. I notice for the Confederated Tribes of Siletz it shows 4,677 enrolled members whereas as of last year out enrollment is above 5,000 so the numbers are out of date bet not horribly so. If you total those up you'll be close. You've also got to factor in descendant families that have sought (but not yet received) recognition from the Bureau of Indian Affairs at tribal governments, which probably accounts for somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 or so individuals in total. Also, obviously not all members of Oregon tribes reside in Oregon currently if that's part of your question, though I'm certain a solid majority do. The population of tribal members is definitely growing, especially when compared to the historic lows which for all Oregon tribes would probably group around the early 20th century. Certainly at Siletz it took until then for the population to get a foothold again after the ravages of disease, war, removal, famine and other various abuses that went along with the early days of the reservation system, and I expect that'd hold true in most places but I'm no demographer. So over that time scale, you're probably looking at something on the order of a 10x increase in the century+ since that low point."
oregon,3aroa2,ABrownBlackBear,3,Fri Jun 26 05:37:49 2015 UTC,"Very interesting link. I found this:   Oregon’s tribal population, according to the 2010 U.S. Census, included 109,223 people who identified themselves as being “American Indian or Alaskan Native” alone, or in combination with, one or more other races. Oregon’s tribal peoples live in all 36 counties and make up about 2.8 percent of Oregon’s total population.    Wikipedia has 1.4% for Native but 3.8% for ""Two or more races"" so maybe that's how they reached the 2.8%. Black people are 1.8%, Asian are 3.7% and Latinos are 11.7%. 5.3% are ""Other"" like me.  Do we know how big the tribal population was before the Europeans showed up?"
oregon,3aroa2,monkeypause,2,Fri Jun 26 15:35:25 2015 UTC,"That's helpful, thanks. Census data presents problems, since that covers every Native American/Alaska Native person, so every Choctaw or Navajo or etc. who has moved here (not to say that they aren't an important part of the fabric of Oregon in their own right, they are). Just like you said, I for example fill out ""White, Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian/Alaska Native on those kinds of forms - since that's closer to the truth of my very mixed-up family background. I can think of tribal members who are also African-American, Asian-American or Pacific Islander through another side of their family who thereby wouldn't fall under that statistic. As far as pre-epidemic populations of Native Oregon, I don't know a number offhand. In general estimates for populations in the past tend to vary a lot and I know very little about anyone east of the Cascades, so I won't speculate. I think the most comprehensive book on population and disease in the PNW is The Coming of the Spirit of Pestilence by Robert Boyd, so that'd be worth checking out."

oregon,3araod,CaptainCoral,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:55:47 2015 UTC,"I've taken road trips through eastern Oregon and specifically John Day twice. My best advice: make hotel reservations early. Do not try to just ""find a place"" as you go. There are VERY few hotels. Both times we went through, we got into John Day around 4-5, the first time we got LUCKY that there was one vacancy at the Best Western (it was a suite, and very expensive), the second time, ALL the hotels were booked. And, in my opinion, some I wouldn't have stayed at anyways. The really only option is the Best Western in John Day. If you go to Prairie City (about an hour away) there's the Historic Hotel Prairie, which we stayed at, and it was very cute. Very clean, but small. Nice, homey feel.       Last recommendation - if you're looking for an awesome breakfast (probably lunch or dinner too, I'm sure), go to the Squeeze Inn Restaurant right in John Day. It doesn't look like a heck of a lot from the outside, but we went there for breakfast and had ordered pancakes, scramble, and omelette between the 3 of us, and everything was SO good. Super fresh and delicious. The one server working was the nicest, sweetest gal also. There were quite a few ""locals"" that came in, and I thought it was awesome that she knew each one by name and had their coffee/eggs ready when the came in. Have a great time!"

Spent the rest of the day just wandering around the lake.  On Saturday morning we started climbing at 6am and made it to the summit around 11.  We spent an hour or so at the summit and made the descent to Moraine Lake in about 2 hours.  By that time the snow had softened somewhat and I was able to glissade in a few places.  There wasn't much snow, but there were a few places I was glad to have microspikes when the snow was hard in the morning.  Crampons definitely not necessary, one of our group made the ascent in tennis shoes (not that I'd advise that).  I'd definitely recommend trekking poles with snow baskets.  I also carried an ice axe, which was probably overkill, but it came in handy in a few places."
oregon,3an3ra,McPolypusher,2,Mon Jun 22 01:45:13 2015 UTC,"Just my two cents - this time of year, maybe, let's see if OP responds. When I did it around labor day timeframe, crampons were not needed and we started from Devil's Lake trailhead around 8am and were back to the car by 3pm or 4pm. The gear and time to do the hike of course depends on the conditions & particular snow pack conditions for the year. This year, the snowpack was very light."

""This is Portland in five years. Some say we're already there.""  I lived in downtown portland for five years and immediately moved to LA, where I lived for two years.  I've just returned to Oregon (God its good to be out of LA).  While hamellr is not wrong, I've expereinced both in the last seven years and I can tell you there is still a vast difference between the two.  Portland is miles ahead of LA in terms of traffic management.  Yes, traffic on some freeways can be pretty bad during rush hour, but its nothing compared to LA.  I had to take the 60 or the 10 in LA everyday; Portland traffic is nowhere near that bad.  Also, Portland's public transit system is phenominal.  My wife and I shared one car without trouble (we don't have kids, which would make this much less feasible I am sure) and had no trouble taking the Max or using the bus system.  Portland does things to prioritize mass transit, to the point where it can be easier and faster depending on where you are.    Housing in Portland proper is getting expensive.  He's not wrong there.  But again, coming from southern California it won't seem that way.  We can rent a 3-4 bedroom house in Portland for the same cost of our dinky one bedroom apartment in LA.  I can't speak to the quality of school districts, but both Eugene and Corvallis are beautiful, and would be an incredibly refreshing change from miles of concrete.  Eugene is more likely to offer you better job opportunities of the two, but who knows if that will be true in a few years.  Come and visit!  I think the most striking thing (other than actual greenery) is how friendly people are compared to Southern California.  Living in LA and now coming back has made me really appreciate just how awesome our state is.  But you have to promise not to tell everyone, we tend to try to keep our state a secret."

As a generalization, I would live anywhere where they voted yes on Measure 91 (marijuana).  Also, if anyone hassles you about moving here from California just ask them when they moved here from there.

That said, the progressive lifestyle is really specific to Portland, for the most part. This metro area votes completely differently than most of the rest of the state. You'll find that if you check how the counties vote on most issues. Portland metro is one color, the rest of the state is the opposite.   Schools... I'm not a parent, so everything I know comes from the news. And it isn't good. Extremely high drop out rates in many of the high schools, drug problems, etc. Perhaps places like Lake Oswego are different, as often, higher income areas have better schools but I have absolutely no data to back that up. It's a hunch.   I know what it feels like to be living in an area that just isn't a proper fit. It's hard. Definitely, 100% recommend that you visit ALL the areas you're considering moving to. Portland is in a very complicated place with the housing market right now, but you'll probably find it to be a better fit than you'd expect. Might want to add it to your list.   Best of luck!"

I've seen signs at Fred Meyer gas stations that say NO SELF SERVE but I have myself filled up a diesel car myself because it was packed and I got no shit for it.  But if you go get a fleet card like Pacific Pride, you pump your own gasoline. Because it's not ""retail"" fueling or some shit.  Dumb as rocks I agree. I'd really prefer to pump my own gas most of the time, especially in my 49 year old project car that the gas filler neck doesn't like to hold the nozzle and I end up standing there holding the nozzle in place so it doesn't shoot out and spray gasoline everywhere (happened once)."

If you are younger, it’s illegal. You can use recreational marijuana at home or on private property. Public use is illegal. You can possess up to 8 ounces of useable marijuana in your home and up to 1 ounce outside the home. Driving under the influence of marijuana remains illegal. Please be responsible. You can grow up to 4 plants per residence, out of public view. You can share or give away recreational marijuana. You can’t sell it or buy it until licensed retail shops open. You can’t take marijuana in or out of the state. That includes Washington. You can make edible products at home or receive them as gifts, but you can still only use them in private places."

There are people in this thread who apparently think Nestle is responsible for the drought in California. There is no point in even having a discussion with people like that or about articles like this because they are telling lies.

Cascade Locks is not in a drought nor has it ever been.  Cascade Locks is not southeastern Oregon.    Nestle did not cause the drought in California and their water usage is minimal.   If you want to be anti bottled water that is fine. I am. But to make up lies about this issue doesn't help the cause.

oregon,39tt12,DietOysterCrackers,2,Mon Jun 15 01:38:50 2015 UTC,48 is pretty minimal for the amount of profit they'll make off of the place.

oregon,39vd0k,bloodhd,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:53:52 2015 UTC,"I have AT&T and generally have had good coverage when in Ashland, but I have a standard plan with them, no pre-paid, so can't speak to any differences in coverage. I was able to get LTE coverage in most places as well.  There's a lot of theatre in Ashland, including the OSF, and a number of additional smaller production groups. They're worth checking out, and even OSF tickets can be hand relatively inexpensively, don't forget to ask about the backstage tour, it's a pretty interesting experience. There's also Lithia Park which is a really nice park with quite a few trails.  Also, if you've got a car, you have a lot more options. Medford is pretty close, is much larger, and has a lot more recreation options (cinemas, resturants, a mall, etc). Mt Shasta's not all that far away either, and would make a good weekend trip. If you've never been, a trip back up to the Winston area for their drive-through animal safari is pretty fun as well."

oregon,39uqhx,mbod,2,Sun Jun 14 23:17:20 2015 UTC,"All coastal state parks have first come/first served sites available, sites that cannot be reserved. Show up at 1 ish and you will find a site. After 4 pm, probably not. I see lots of tourists still on the road at 7 pm and frankly, that is piss poor planning. I take trips bi-monthly to Santa Cruz from here in Coos Bay from April to October for surf and while I have many little secret camp spots/parking spots, I always plan to be set up before 3 pm if I am using a state park.  USFS sites on the west side of 101 between Florence and Gardiner do not have a reservation system, they are all first come first serve. The beach area north of the Umpqua River has dispersed camping in the dunes, free, accessible from Sparrow Peak road, south of Florence, north of Gardiner.  Dispersed camping along the coast is available up most rivers from Florence south to the border. These are where you will find County and USFS sites.  Locally, the Coos, Allegheny, Millicoma and Coquille Rivers all have USFS/County camping and they are only full on holidays and sometimes weekends. Most of these campgrounds are within 15 miles of the coast and are much warmer than the coast (summer sucks on the coast, its 52 and drizzly as I type, wind at 20 knots right off of 51 degree ocean water). Further south, the Sixes, Pistol and Chetco rivers all have dispersed USFS camping along their banks.  Coos Bay/Bastendorff Beach has free camping right on the beach/dune area as well with a 24 hour limit (not really enforced). The County campground right above the beach usually has sites available weekdays even in summer.  The Pistol River area has camping right on the beach, legally, period. Windsurfers and kiteboarders camp there for weeks at a time in the summer without hassle.  Northern California is troublesome and I do not share the free sites I have found throughout the area North of San Francisco. Too many idiots will eventually fuck it up for me and others.  tl;dr, 35 years of surfing the West Coast from Florence to Cabo, I know where to camp."
oregon,39uqhx,i_sometimes,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:45:54 2015 UTC,"Great info! I was hoping to stay away from as many RV groups as possible, so I'll defeintely be trying to find the more remote ones, and try to stick to Dune camping on the coast.   I don't think I'll be more than one night at each place, we'll only be there for a week, and I'm also at a hotel in portland for two nights. More of an exploration trip, not a sit-around-relaxining-in-one-spot trip.  any pointers for dune camping? what makes it more comfortable and less likely to get sand in my buttcrack?"
oregon,39uqhx,i_sometimes,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"The dunes have vegetation, trees and dirt so you should be good. Pack it in, pack it out, the area reached by Sparrow Peak rd. is wild with no trash cans, water or restrooms. By keeping it clean, it will stay open to dispersed camping. There are a few small lakes to camp by, be sure to get there in day light or you will have trouble finding a good spot. It is not developed at all. Nothing is marked in the area but a few signs for the atv's."

oregon,39uqhx,circinatum,4,Mon Jun 15 02:06:26 2015 UTC,"Eastern Oregon had quite a few empty campsites at various spots along Highway 395 from Burns up to John Day and more north. Granted, that's pretty remote territory, probably not useful to the OP."

oregon,39uqhx,Coastscribbler,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:48:50 2015 UTC,Typically you will find state parks in more exotic locations and with better amenities. However the campsites are often small and close together. You will have more space and fewer crowds at a USFS campground.

oregon,39uqhx,aranamac,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:58:19 2015 UTC,"For this July? Seriously you are too late for the Coast, although you can camp on our beaches (not in any city limits); and perhaps in other, unimproved areas.   One thing to keep in mind is that we are now in very dry/drought conditions, so there is absolutely no way you'll be lighting any fires while camping here, unless you want a Very Large Hassle from the local authorities."
oregon,39uqhx,Coastscribbler,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:26:28 2015 UTC,thanks! any particular beaches that are open to random camping? I'm hoping to stay away from the RV crowd anyways lol
oregon,39uqhx,aranamac,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:43:07 2015 UTC,"All of Oregon's beaches are public. You can camp on any of them, so long as you aren't in city limits. By the way, you definitely would do better up in the dunes or the grassy area (or forest), well above high tide. We get some pretty wicked sneaker waves, so camping too close to the water can be dangerous."

All have a little different charm but show how awesome the Oregon coast can be.   Plus Dungeness crab is in high season then so that's another reason.    If I-5 Eugene is nice lots of breweries and music.  It will be a little quiet at Christmas cause all the college kids are gone but that is better in my opinion.     Be careful about taking any secondary roads. Any state Highway should be okay but winter in the coast range can be sketchy.   Ice, snow, landslides.   https://tripcheck.com/Pages/RCMap.asp?curRegion=0  Or 1-800-977-ODOT  Not trying to scare you.  Just want you to be aware and have the resources to make adjustments.
