But when you already have that thought you are setting yourself up. Give yourself a chance, and so what if you say something that maybe you feel is ""dumb"", we see things in ourselves more than others do. People don't care as much as you think. Everybody has embarrassing moments sometimes. If you're looking for new friends maybe start with a new job in something that you're interested in? Or volunteer somewhere? I do some volunteer ems and its helped me a lot bc youre forced to speak with a lot of different people. Are you going to college? You can always meet people there. try not to assume you'll mess up, fake confidence until you have it"

socialanxiety,3e3zk9,Over9000Zeros,4,Tue Jul 21 19:52:56 2015 UTC,To change my mood I choose to get high on life. I try to avoid substances and artificial ways to improve my mood because usually it makes your mood worse in the long term and it's easier to lose contact to reality than if you did something natural.   There are plenty of ways to get high on life. A) hot shower/jacuzzi B) Massage C) Meditation D) Stretching/Yoga E) Sauna F) Aerobic exercise G) Crying/Laughing H) Napping I) Floating J) Bonding K) Local or universal travelling L) Intimitate sex M) Extreme sports N) Music and the list goes on and on. Any of this will likely change your mood and perspective of life instantly
socialanxiety,3e3zk9,tryELI5,3,Tue Jul 21 21:40:18 2015 UTC,"A few months ago I was looking for a new job, and I was getting so nervous that I was afraid my anxiety would show and prevent me from getting hired anywhere. So whenever I listened to music (usually in the car, when exercising or while at the job that I hated) I would put my music on shuffle and skip through them until I came across a song that was upbeat and positive sounding. I did this  more and more, and began to notice that it was putting me in a better mood 100% of the time. Since I was in a good mood a lot, I was more relaxed and did better in interviews, and ended up getting a job that I love. So that's what worked for me."
socialanxiety,3e3zk9,MuppetHolocaust,2,Tue Jul 21 21:52:40 2015 UTC,"I journal out my feelings. A lot, and almost exclusively into ye olde fashioned paper journals. Something about the feeling of turning my emotions into something visual/physical/""real"" and trying to actually put them into words instead of just dwelling on them, helps me a lot.  I'll also sometimes go onto koko (new mental health app based around what's essentially a CBT technique for thinking about your mood/problems in a different light) and try to reframe other people's problems to get myself in the mental mode of thinking about my mood from a different angle. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn't, but either way I like that it's a chance to help someone else while I'm in a shitty mood. That way, at least I feel like some good's come out of an afternoon of feeling like crap."

I doubt it, so why assume they are staring at you? Unless they have their eyes closed they have to look somewhere.

Nobody is examining you, you think that way, but that's not really what people are doing. You are only scared because you're afraid that you're doing something to upset people or that you look unacceptable in the eyes of other. Every socially anxious person has their own unique thoughts and their own unique symptoms of what that may be. You shouldn't be afraid of being afraid because everyone experiences anxiety and you can train someone to be afraid like you are in the same situation"

What's been sort of working for me isn't the most comfortable and isn't really much of a solution, but it makes it easier to get through the day.   I have to block out my senses when I'm in public. I look right at the curb, or at plants or animals if possible and I have noise cancelling earbuds that I keep in from when I leave until I'm all the way where I need to go (unless I need to talk to someone about something briefly). It helps me scrape by on those harder days and on the easier days I can take my headphones out, or make eye contact or whatever I want.   Also, try St. Johns Wort if you haven't already. Its like having horse blinders. I can still see people staring and get anxious, but it always puts me in a ""I give so little fucks about what you're staring at/thinking. I hope it's worth the look."" kinda mood."

socialanxiety,3e23xe,JamPonyExpress,4,Tue Jul 21 14:46:56 2015 UTC,"People here complain about social anxiety not only because it makes them uncomfortable, but also because it makes them sad to be isolated. That is not your case, you describe a textbook case of introversion. The introvert <-> extravert spectrum is wide and it's perfectly acceptable to be anywhere on it. You shouldn't have to be classified in some mental illness when it's just your personality.   That being said it can be easier for your family to accept mental illness than to understand introversion if they are themselves extroverted. Social anxiety is a perfect scapegoat here. In could also, like you said, cause them to try to ""fix"" you even more. You need to think about it carefully.  If your parents don't mind reading I suggest you make them check out Quiet by Susan Cain, she also did a TED talk that I didn't watch. A few chapters of the book focus on child-parent relationships and how much it is detrimental to ignore the personality of the child. The rest is about what is introversion, how it became stigmatized in our current society but was a praised quality not that long ago, and how to learn to work with it.  The main problem in your situation is that if you lack basic social skills you are likely to have a hard time with your professional life. You'll need to choose a career carefully (if it's not already done) where you can work alone and not be bothered too much."
socialanxiety,3e23xe,kikikol,2,Tue Jul 21 17:31:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your answer. I also never really felt as if i have a mental illness, I mean, I know I am far from normal (what is normal anyways) but I am happy. I don't have issues with taking part in every day life. What led me into believing that there is something majorly wrong with me that (at least compared to me) literally every person I know is extrovert. I always get asked why i don't want to hang out today, why i don't want to go to the club or the bar or whatever. I just stopped telling them that I'd rather stay at home or at least stay in a small group and started making up excuses, its just easier. My parents always told me I need to meet friends more often, I need to get a girlfriend and what not, and I really tried, but it just doesn't work for me. And the only way of explaining to myself why I can't enjoy things that literally every single person thinks of as the most important things (friends, family etc.) in his  life is (was) mental illness. That being said, I will think about explaining them introversion and trying to make them understand that I can happily live how I am, thanks for the book link. I just fear what happens if my parents think I have a mental illness because no matter how good their intentions are I think most stuff they'd do would make it worse for me, especially because we have a person in our family who had serious depression, she was in a psychatry for serveral years so they will probably overreact drastically. Over the Ã½ears I have picked up ways of concealing my antisocial self, at least for some time, and in my field of study (semi conductor physics // electrical engineering) I just build on the believe that most people seem wierd at least to some degree, so i won't stick out that much at job interviews. My social skills will probably never be good enough for higher positions but thats something I can deal with."

I have no problem with my personality, it's just the people around me make me think that I need to change to be an acceptable member of society.

I've found I am a serial offender at that and have probably held myself back hundreds of times thinking it's what I wanted.  Most recently I finally finished the work required to graduate my engineering degree  and up until now I had been convinced I never wanted a graduation ceremony,  itd be too crowded and unpleasant. So I had planned to graduate in absentia and be done with it.   As soon as I got the email confirming I can apply to graduate I found myself planning attending the ceremony. .. something I was so sure I didn't give a shit about I was now looking forward too. If my therapist hadn't pushed me to get the last bits of my degree finished I'd never have found this out."

I don't want to sound critical but if eating out at dinner with your family makes you uncomfortable, there are a lot of things coming up in life that you probably wont be able to handle. How would you interview for a job or make yourself a doctors appointment? Sometimes it's worth it to sort out these feelings, and you might find out that you feel much better after doing so. You might regret it someday if you don't make an attempt to integrate yourself with society (forgive me if I'm wrong but I assume you're young now). Becoming social will only get harder with time and some things you really can't handle alone -- it's your brain giving you the anxiety, you may need to step outside it to cure it. It can be hard to find a good therapist but if you find someone kind and let yourself be honest you may find that your behaviors are easily explainable and can be fixed in a way that will make your own life easier. Again this is just advice, feel free to ignore it."

I'm not saying nobody is actually thinking these things, cause that wouldn't be true.   To people unaware that you have anxiety, you can indeed appear cold, arrogant, and unwelcoming. Apparently, not talking much, generally speaking, still isn't well received by the majority of people. And unsurprisingly, that tends to make people dislike you. People judge, it happens.  Do what you want to do. Let them talk shit. You got better things to do than to care about what others think about you. If people don't like you for whatever reason, it's their problem, not yours.   I know all of this is much easier said than done. I still can't completely fight off these intrusive thoughts and brush off peoples' hostile-looking gazes who apparently think I murdered their baby or something. It's a work in progress.

socialanxiety,3e4my5,Quetesso,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:38:53 2015 UTC,"I think I understand what you're saying. I also frequently find myself coming away from social situations feeling that same emptiness that you've mentioned. The only thing you mentioned that I don't usually have a thought of is, ""do they really care about me?"" I usually find myself assuming person A seems to care and person B doesn't, basing it off what I perceive (or think I perceive) via non-verbal cues. But even if I do feel that someone cares, it doesn't necessarily change that empty feeling I have once I leave. And I've come to view it as just not personally feeling a real and meaningful connection with others. Which is where I think your thought of humans being tribal, gregarious creatures comes into play--that desire and need for a real depth of connection with someone. Like you, I'm not truly close to anyone, and though I've recently come to see one individual in my life as being a close friend, I don't feel like who I am around them is necessarily my fullest and truest form, which makes me still feel a disconnect.  The part about people saying that you shouldn't care about what others think, I see as a separate idea though. I see the whole ""don't care"" aspect as just meaning you shouldn't restrict who you are as a person around others, but should feel comfortable being you--whether it be showcasing your opinions, your sense of humor, ect.  Have I been on the right track with everything so far?? Anyway, not sure if there needs to be feelings of guilt, though I can relate, especially if you see you are trying--which I think matters more. I think it's just harder for those of us with SA to really find close and deep connections with people."

socialanxiety,3e09op,thisneverhappens,2,Mon Jul 20 23:31:29 2015 UTC,"You've described two problems here: social anxiety and stage fright (performance anxiety).  I didn't overcome social anxiety myself, I'm almost a recluse by now and a third of my life is gone. But I had period of remissions and I've read or heard a lot of stories so I can tell you that much: social anxiety is mostly an exposure thing. You will need to gradually learn to be more confident in the presence of strangers. It will likely never go away completely and if you give up you will have to start again from scratch when you try again.  Medication can do wonders for some, go half way for most, and nothing for the rest of us. Some work more often than others, for example benzodiazepines (probably what your doc initially gave you) are usually effective in a significant percentage of patients but they can be addictive (some more than others) and doctors do not always like to prescribe them long term. SSRIs and SNRIs are more often than not ineffective for social anxiety but they are first line treatment because of their tolerability and non-abusable nature. MAOIs can be more effective but they come with many dietary restrictions. There are so many others but I'll let that to your doctor, he will know much better what's best for you.  Now for stage fright. Again it's an exposure thing, but, unlike social relationships, it's not an essential life skill to possess. So working very hard to put yourself ""in danger"" in front of an audience just to conquer your fear to do a couple presentations through college seems unproductive to me. Beta blockers such as propranolol are a popular choice to be used as needed. They are also effective in social anxiety (for some) because it minimizes physical symptoms and when you're not sweating or thinking about puking or stuttering you can better focus on your conversation!  I encourage you in getting another job if college isn't already exhausting for you (being close to so many people can be very exhausting when you have social anxiety)."

Social anxiety after a a build up of disturbing social experiences can go away once you've apprehended the source of your fear.  A self image issue will take a long time to recover, maybe a life time. I think it fits in the ""never go away"".  In most cases it will be a constant work in progress. You won't feel it. You will maybe forget about it. But if you stop seeing people and doing what cured you in the first place you will go back."
socialanxiety,3e09op,kikikol,2,Tue Jul 21 09:38:39 2015 UTC,"It can, that's why I said ""likely"". I think what caused it in the first place is an important factor to recovery. Also if it's comorbid with generalized anxiety or depression, for example, it will be very hard to make it go away for good.  But again, yes, it can go away completely with proper treatment. Or simply with time if you are still a teenager. I didn't want to sound pessimistic by saying that it won't go away completely, sorry."

socialanxiety,3dylmc,tiranically,9,Mon Jul 20 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"I'll answer. Of course, I have mild social anxiety and I am also in my mid-thirties, so likely not your target audience. In my experience, approaching a random woman at the supermarket, the gym, or in line for coffee, is too intense. You don't know if she is single, or even in the frame of mind to be receptive. That being said, if you can find a common interest, say, you both are at an art gallery, dog park, in a bar/pub, taking the same kickboxing class, etc, you now have an ""in"" that you can use to your advantage. At the very least, you can say hello, state something about the activity or place, smile and see what she does. Above all, don't leer or say anything too personal as a compliment, and never touch anyone you don't know. I once had a guy ""pick lint off my sweater"" and that came off as quite intrusive to me.  If she looks away or down, keeps walking, or is friendly, but doesn't volley with an answer or question, smile and move politely on. Be very careful about approaching people in stairways, public transportation, or anywhere where she can't get away or feels especially vulnerable. So the answer is, you can approach a woman, but watch carefully for her cues and it's best to meet people through friends or at a social function, in my opinion. Good luck."

I don't spend much time considering how 'well' a man approaches me - all my energy is invested in feeling anxious and judging myself.    EX. One (reasonably friendly) guy started talking to me at a bookstore while I was flipping through one of my favorite graphic novels, one I've read a few times and own a copy of, and I was so anxiety-ridden that I was unable to remember the name of the main characters. When he asked me what I liked about the plot, I was barely capable of formulating a response. I spent the rest of the day hating myself, thinking that I had fulfilled some bad stereotype of a poser and haven't gone back to that bookstore since. Another time, a person (who I had never met before) from my school kept demanding that I stop and talk to him in the hallway. He asked my major, and I said geology, then asked my ethnicity, and I told him that too. There was a long awkward silence, then he said ""boring major, boring girl"" and walked off. What I'm getting at here is that I've had bad encounters that have ended up exasperating my SA.   Some girls with milder SA might really like being approached in a friendly manner. It might be comforting in some way."
socialanxiety,3dylmc,nyred23,2,Tue Jul 21 02:28:00 2015 UTC,"I think the top comment on this post has it right.  If you approach someone with the intent of friendship, then it is very clear that you are interested in them as a person.  I think approaching with a relationship being the goal from the outset can come off as creepy because it may make a person feel like they're more of an object or a goal, rather than another human being who you'd like to get to know. (Also, I'm a post history creeper, and you are very cute.  Be happy, be friendly, be confident and you will do great :) )"
socialanxiety,3dylmc,lesbianoralien,3,Mon Jul 20 22:03:58 2015 UTC,"In advance, Im not a women. TL DR: wrong subreddit to ask that question IMO.  1: You will hear the opinion of the subreddit's audience, which is not women who can just approach you or being approached without major anxiety.  2: Not being able to approach women you like does not mean having social anxiety, its rather an approach anxiety, which is just one of the many problems social anxiety is built upon, I suppose for you its just a healthy approach anxiety.  Now, in case you are quite sociable with people, and have a decent social life, I would suggest going to some different subreddit to ask that:  r/seduction : you can't really have much of the women's opinion, but thereotically that site is like half about getting over approach anxiety. You can get a bit of courage or realistic view of things if you look up the top posts regarding approach anxiety. Trust me, it can help a lot in getting along with women if you are not completely lost like most of us. In case you are, welcome.  r/askwomen : for the very question you just taken here, only with not just audience of women with social anxiety."

I did this yesterday with my husband because I threw away his Jersey Mike's yesterday because it was a few days old. He brought it up and asked me if I threw away his sandwich, I said yes, and in my head I saw him look upset. This was the end of the world for me I hate seeing my husband look upset, he didn't raise his voice or get mad at me or anything he just looked upset, to me that's the worse thing ever. I left him alone to skype with his friends and watch twitch.tv like he normally does and went to my living room for the whole day and thought about all the ways this sandwich ruined my life.  I thought my husband was going to resent me because I thoughtlessly threw away his sandwich, finally once my husband found me crying alone with an anxiety attack, he said, ""It's just a sandwich. It was probably bad for me anyways, I was just really hungry and acting stupid. I would never get mad at you over a sandwich""   That really clicked for me. It's just a sandwich.  So I guess what I'm trying to tell you is that it's just a facebook post. People are posting stupid facebook posts everyday to get reactions from other people because they're bored.  Don't let the sandwich get to you and ruin your day."

I sat outside the house and drove around the block a few times but just couldn't bring myself to go in. I went home. I couldn't bear to go through the process of engaging in conversations with people - Friends - and have to pretend I wasn't feeling like I was melting down inside.   If it were me trying to go to Rocky Horror, I'd first go by myself. There's less at stake being anonymous in the situation. No one knows you and no one will really see you again, so whatever happens won't matter. I know it sucks going alone but it will give you the chance to have sort of a trial run."

The ONLY way i can socialize with people is if i'm drinking, but i can't drink because when i do, my depression spirals out of control and my hangovers last a week, which just makes the anxiety worse and i end up in a destructive cycle.  I went to Dracula's (a dinner-theater restaurant in Australia) for my 21st birthday, and obviously with it being my birthday the cast made sure i was in the spotlight as much as possible. It honestly ruined the night for me, as having a panic attack when put in the spotlight in front of not only a large audience but everyone i was there with was incredibly embarrassing.

I'm getting better at it though. Baby steps! And it sounds like you're working hard at improving yourself, too! Mingling with people at a party is really impressive!  I went to a Rocky Horror show a couple of years ago. And I was one of the people that was 'lucky' enough to go up front and made to do something embarrassing. But they don't force everybody to go up front, they only choose from people who are attending their first Rocky Horror show. And even then, my friends and I were all Rocky Horror virgins and I was the only one of us who was picked. If you just lie and say that you've been to a show before, they should just leave you alone. If you sit somewhere in the middle of the crowd (I.e., not by the aisles and not in the front row), I think you'll be able to blend in enough so that people won't notice if you're not saying anything."

And congrats on working through it, admitting you have this issue and working on improving it is the first step.  I think the 80/20 rule to social anxiety is your inner-psychology, at least it was for me. My SA isn't severe, but I do hate being the center of attention and dealt with getting nervous having to approach people when I started a company a few yrs. ago. It was nerve-wracking.  But the thing I learned is that with some mental preparation and habit-building you can lower the levels of anxiety you feel. I struggled with self-doubt and negative self-talk and when I was able to control that inner voice I made huge strides.  I wrote a post about my personal experience and some ways to work on it. Message me if you're interested, I can send you the link.   Good luck and keep up the great work!"

They will only make you go onstage if you either volunteer yourself as a ""virgin"" or if someone else outs you as such.  If you go with someone else, just make sure that they understand how much it would hurt you to be ""outed"". You can read up about what usually goes on during a Rocky Horror live show online.  The participatory nature of it doesn't involve being the center of attention.  Usually the theater will sell a bag of props (or include with your ticket), and you throw the props at the screen during various parts of the movie.  There's also a lot of yelling at the screen.  It's fun and communal and definitely doesn't single people out."

Never for any reason can I have more. I had a problem with drinking heavily and this was only way I could stop this destructive pattern of drinking. Funny story, was at my local bar where the bartender knew my rule. So we had a pattern worked out. I would order a vodka and grapefruit drink. After that first one he would provide me with just straight grapefruit juice for the rest of the night. So I ran into one of my coworkers who sat down next to me to just shoot the bull. Evening gets late and I tell him I need to head home, he asks how I'm getting home. I only lived about three blocks down so I just walked down. Told him I was walking back. He said good because he was worried about me driving after all those drinks. I started laughing and said only the first drink had alcohol the rest just fruit juice. He laughed but also cussed.

When you first started pushing yourself out into social situations and begin this new journey, you never felt like it (due to it being nerve-wracking) and always had that knotted feeling that you had to push through. This is complicated to explain, but it sounds like you'd reached the point of going out being normal to you without realising you'd hit that milestone, and therefore mistaking the every-day not fancying it for slipping back. You might have seen that reversal in emotion as a blip, but to me, it reads like indication of hitting a new level. You've realised that as well now, so I guess what I'm trying to say is, you've done it. Your new normal is now a confident, well dressed, social man, not a solitary, anxious, depressed one.

Basically, all it is is typing up transcripts from audio, for market research focus groups (mainly - although you can do medical/court/radio/TV subtitles too). You get sent the audio file and type up the conversations onto a Word doc', send it back, get paid. I worked for a great UK-based transcription agency for 5-years before going freelance, which pays a lot better but still, the agency work is a foot-in-the-door, flexible and enjoyable. One of the massive benefits to being a fly on the wall of interviews and focus groups is that it makes you feel more connected to people and now, people to me are a lot less scary. We're all very similar, really - that's what I've learned. It's also incredibly interesting and new each day. If you're in the UK and interested, PM me and I'll tell you which agency I worked for (100% legit, always paid, 100% professional). Now I'm freelance, I've branched out into other writing work too, but this was my way in and I'd recommend it to anyone, especially those with SA. I will say though, after 5-years of working in my PJs, I did start to yearn for human interaction a bit, so now I work from my friend's IT office, but still self employed as a writer and able to leave early or not go in if I don't feel like it."

You interact with people constantly so most people would think this is a bad idea with social anxiety. The thing is there is a pretty clearly defined structure to your interactions with those people. Your interactions also tend to be Very brief. It works two ways. One, you have a clear set of boundaries, so there is very little pressure on you to improvise a conversation outside of that strict situation and two, it gets you gradually used to interacting with people over time. I know knee jerk it sounds backward but I remember a psychology professor back in my college days telling me. Also teaching but that does take quite a bit of education."

At the moment it's a load of recent Vaporwave stuff and some so-called ""Krautrock"" bands from the 70s."

The outro of ""It's a nickname"" actually made me cry once from how much I could relate to it:  ""Hey would you walk with a man who likes to keep his eyes closed, who can barely understand a line along the truth / How do you call a man who likes to keep his windows shut, from the morning to the end of the day""  Some other songs from the album:   Everything Else  Big Moon  Nobody Told Me  Also, thanks for making this thread.

socialanxiety,3dughc,LightFixture69,7,Sun Jul 19 16:37:55 2015 UTC,This has started happening to me recently. I have gotten to the point where I've gotten sick and sometimes I get so nervous it feels tough to breath. I've never been like this before but I can probably chalk it up to a few major life changes recently. I've noticed that if I take some time out of my day to sit and read something it settles me down. Whenever I've start to get nervous or feel getting sick I have tried some breathing exercises or even flat out removing myself from a stressful situation and go for a walk. The breathing goes like this: In through the nose for a count of four. Hold for four. Breath out of a purses mouth or nose for six seconds. Ive noticed it's starting to help me a little
socialanxiety,3dughc,WEARETHEGOODGUYS,3,Sun Jul 19 17:05:09 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I've suffered from these symptoms for 10 years, and still suffer a bit. Don't blame yourself for this, it is most likely genetic and is simply triggered under high stress situations. You get anxious about going to the party, so you get nauseous, but then you start getting anxious about you nausea, because you might throw up in front of everyone and embarrass yourself. So you get caught in this messed up loop. What worked for me the best was a combination of mild anti-depressant and exposure to these social events. The anti-depressants keep you calmer and your brain learns that there is nothing to fear and stops going into this panic mode. If you do not want to take drugs, maybe you could try some Valerian root or Passion flower extract, those have calming properties as well. Good luck!"

If you're not already prescribed a benzodiazepine, I'm going to suggest you seek a psychiatrist (I know,  I know,  but I promise it's worth it) and ask them to evaluate your situation.  I know benzos can seem scary,  but as long as you respect the drug and use it as intended,  it is life changing.

Of course you're welcome here, but you might get more help from a general place like /r/anxiety.  It certainly does seem like less alcohol, more exercise, better eating, and more sleep calms me down a ton and keeps my anxiety/stress down.  Hopefully not getting that drunk again should keep it from happening, or do you get them normally?"
socialanxiety,3dwd0f,FinnianWhitefir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:57:59 2015 UTC,"That was definitely just regular anxiety, but in my mind I kept thinking ""social anxiety"" which is why I think it's weird. My anxiety usually happens when I go back to school though, since summer started it kind of went away because I'm back home.   I've gotten drunk before and I did cry once, my first time. It was new years and I went to a party with a friend, at some point of the night there was just too many people and I couldn't take being with so many girls in one small room, and I started crying. But a couple of days ago there was nothing wrong, I don't understand why my body would think I was having anxiety.  I eat pretty healthy and work out daily. I rarely go out and drink but I can take a few glasses of alcohol. It was just weird having my body thinking I was getting anxious."
socialanxiety,3dwd0f,FinnianWhitefir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:35:21 2015 UTC,"So two possibilities.  Could just be a bad reaction, lots of stress around that event, certainly blacking-out drunk should be a huge wildcard for what could happen or how you could feel.  I know I worked with a bunch of people right out of college who thought that was completely normal and scoffed at the idea that getting black-out drunk was a sign of alcoholism, but it surely means your body isn't working right.  For all we know, someone slipped something into your drink that caused that and you reacted bad.  Secondly, it's good to pay attention to those.  I know I had the same reaction once at a party, everything was going fine, then I just hit a point where depression crashed in and I couldn't handle being around anyone and just had to get out.  It should have been a big sign that something was wrong and I should have looked into it, but it took years before I was willing to do the work and get into therapy and realize that I had a lot of unhealthy assumptions and motivations, that I learned a lot of unhealthy things in my childhood, and that I had a lot of just unresolved stuff with my family that I had to get over.  So maybe look deeper.  If that keeps popping up, it probably had relevance.  I tell people lately ""Put as much effort into getting healthier as it costs your in uncomfortableness"".  If this never happens again, it's all good.  If you want to make sure it never happens again, talk to someone about it."
socialanxiety,3dvcy1,ygfann,4,Sun Jul 19 20:56:14 2015 UTC,OP I'm the exact same. Like when I get a text I sometimes wait a while to respond because it seems like everyone else takes a while to respond to me. And I try not to text any one first because I don't want to be o entering at all. I assume that if someone doesn't text me first they must not be interested in me at all. It's a real problem especially with girls because I can never be tell if some one is actually enjoying communicating with me.

socialanxiety,3dudbk,smokedick,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"First... dream part. I usually have dreams that are neither good nor bad. They are realistic but surreal. It's usually me seeing women from my past who I either found important, not important, or that I never even existed to them. It's always a happy greeting, how have you been since school, and then I see them walking away or getting back to whomever was important to them. It hurts because I feel that I am a truly adjusted person on the outside (I have a nice apartment, a nice car, and nice things)... but I don't feel important to anyone.   I am not a doctor and you likely don't have a serious condition. I just think you need someone outside your family to be appreciative of you for just being there. There are hundreds of millions of lonely people in the world, suffering in their own way. Some are in relationships, marriages, and friendships with people... but they still feel lonely or unimportant. For some people, it's a non-issue that comes up when they had a particularly bad day at work but it goes away after a good nights rest or even after a couple of hours. For other people, the feeling of being unimportant drags on for weeks or months.   Then you have people like me... years deep into the feeling of unimportance. Even after I've done something at work that I feel or know would impact someone's life positively... the feeling of unimportance always creeps in. Sundays nights are always the ""bad"" nights because no one calls or texts cause I don't have anyone to call or text.   But when I'm out... I'm great. I like grocery shopping or running an errand cause it gives me an excuse to be out among people. It's just when all the basic needs for my home are filled... there is no reason to go out, right? So I sit at home and wish someone would find me important.   So yes, we suffer. It's that we suffer alone or in private that makes comparing ourselves to ""normal"" people hurt. We see happiness when there could be real problems that people suffer with. I think the biggest barrier we have to overcome is to break down in front of the right person who is also on the verge of breaking down. Then, and maybe only then, can a bond a mutual importance can be made."

I guess as you say it's not really personally investing to talk to girls and get their numbers when it's that easy over there, but most people here wouldn't be able to do that.  Everything else I read just has this feeling of ""Other people are better than me"".  When I got into therapy for my depression, it took a bit to catch on that I had a lot of SA and a lot of self-worth issues.  A lot of those feed off each other, and things get really entangled, and it is hard to tell one from the other or figure out where each came from.  But, in the the end, sitting down with a good therapist got me comfortable speaking my mind, putting myself up as an equal in a conversation, and gave me the confidence to put myself first or at least equal to other people.  I highly suggest it."

Like, ""If I really like her, I'll call her once a week and text daily. If I kind of like her I'll text her every second day. If she doesn't respond I will try texting her again, but if she keeps not responding I'll stop texting."" Stuff like that, that way you won't obsess over it because you'll have already decided.

socialanxiety,3dtefn,gunfox,8,Sun Jul 19 14:40:05 2015 UTC,"The Israeli study was interesting.  I may look over the others as well.   To sum up, individuals with SP (social phobia) are preoccupied with the impression they make, and place fundamental impor- tance on being positively appraised by others. They may be especially sensitive to social stimuli, but in real-life social situations, while bombarded with social infor- mation, the accuracy of their analysis of those stimuli is negatively affected. Thus, the mode of processing the external social environment as well as the tendency to self focus in SP may influence their perceptiveness of social stimuli, which overall may be manifested in a unique social-cognitive abilities profile."
socialanxiety,3dtefn,Zeydon,4,Sun Jul 19 16:18:52 2015 UTC,interesting study. I think getting SA to a manageable point is easier than increasing one's IQ/EQ ;) Though I wonder how people with SA would develop a high EQ when systematically avoiding situations in which to build it.

socialanxiety,3dvw53,trickscopes,2,Sun Jul 19 23:39:33 2015 UTC,"I was taking sertraline too! :) I've also gone off it for now. It might be worth talking to your doctor about how to come off it gradually, which would reduce side-effects. My doctor was awesome about it and gave me a timeline and prescribed me a lower dose so I could get smaller pills (50mg instead of 100mg) and stop taking it more gradually.   I guess with considering medication, it's important to realise you can change your mind at any time. Like, if you decide not to take a different medication now, you can always start a new one later if it turns out school is too hard without it. Or if you decide to start one now, and then later you decide you don't need it anymore, you can stop.    In terms of natural things... I've heard good things about exposure therapy, which is where you start with things that are only slightly difficult, then do them a lot until they are extremely easy and don't bother you anymore, then do another slightly difficult thing. It works best if you have a therapist helping you with it but I've had some progress doing it by myself too.   In my experience, psychologists ALWAYS want you to meditate and practice mindfulness and try progressive muscle relaxation and breathing techniques, and those things are pretty good for helping you relax and stay calm. In particular, you were talking about freezing up, just doing some breathing can really help me in those situations.   I would also try to keep in contact with friends you have, because having a friend around can make social things a lot easier than if you have to go in with no one. So! Don't let anxiety stop you from spending time with people you like to spend time with.   That was everything I can think of right now, but if you have questions just ask and I'm happy to answer anything I can. Take care <3"
socialanxiety,3duegd,moonfall,3,Sun Jul 19 16:00:33 2015 UTC,"Regarding your sense that you have to ""risk telling people about your life"", I would advise caution. For virtually all mental illness, particularly depression and anxiety, these conditions are very highly stigmatized, and even people who you think might be ""enlightened"" and ""understanding"" could really surprise you.  I believe there's absolutely zero upside in telling people about your condition, but there sure is lots of downside. Once you tell someone that you have a mental illness, that person will never look at you the same way again. So, my advice is that you don't tell anyone unless you have known them for a very long time and you have total trust in them."
socialanxiety,3duegd,LightFixture69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"I agree somewhat with your first point, except that I'm not sure that OP means ""sharing that I have SA"" when they say ""risk telling people about my life"".   With your second point, I disagree entirely. While there are potential downsides, there are also potential upsides. Being honest about having SA makes it a lot easier to manage. For example, because my close friends know that I have SA, they realise I'm not trying to avoid them when I tell them I'd rather not attend a giant and crowded event they invite me to. If I hadn't mentioned the SA, I'd have to say ""I really don't like crowds"", which is still telling them about my life and somewhat confronting (i.e. still something OP and other people with SA would likely have trouble with), or else I'd have to outright LIE to them, which is hardly a way to build a close relationship. The other option of course is to go, which would make me miserable and unable to function for several days.   In a more professional environment it's a bit different - you probably don't want to tell EVERYONE you have SA simply because it's none of their business. However, I think it can help if you tell specific people, like your boss. If your boss is aware (and not an asshole) they'll generally manage it so you don't have to do as many tasks that are potentially difficult for you. I find that bosses in general want their employees to reflect well on the company and it's hardly reflecting well if, for example, I'm having a panic attack in the bathroom instead of interacting with clients.   In general, most people are fairly nice. Yeah some are assholes, and sometimes they're in positions where you need them to be nice to you, so you don't tell THOSE people, but I think that most people are not going to deliberately throw you under a bus. For me it's easier to be open about it, then just ditch the assholes, because usually I don't need them in my life anyway."
socialanxiety,3duegd,iostefini,2,Mon Jul 20 03:28:28 2015 UTC,"I have felt like that and it has definitely gotten better over time for me :)  It is terrifying at first, and even some days now I can have difficulty with it if I'm having a bad day, but it DOES get easier.   For me, I found it easiest to practice online first on chatrooms, and learn to feel comfortable communicating with people there, then move it over to real life. I know other people hate chatrooms though and find that it fucks up their real-life communication ability. (It was a major point of discussion for a while when I was a regular on socialanxietysupport.com's chatroom.) So, I guess you've already done this step - finding a way to practice that works for you. Congratulations :)    (please feel free to ignore me talking about myself for this paragraph) Lately I've been trying to improve phone skills (because I'm sick of panicking every time the phone rings) by getting some of my closer internet friends to talk to me over skype. I'm still not there yet though - I freaked out and quit on a friend a few days ago because we tried roleplaying an actual phone conversation :( BUT I will get there, I'm sure, and I'm definitely more comfortable with it than I used to be.   So I guess my point is, it will improve, and you should be proud of yourself for taking the first steps to improve it. Yay you!"
socialanxiety,3duegd,iostefini,2,Mon Jul 20 03:15:09 2015 UTC,Yes. I still find it next to impossible to maintain a conversation. My mind just goes blank and l can never think of anything to say. However it has gotten less terrifying as I have grown older (mid forties). At some point I just got tired of running away from myself and learned to accept that this is who I am.
socialanxiety,3duegd,Genblender,2,Sun Jul 19 17:55:52 2015 UTC,I can't speak as to how to become more proactive in conversations because I more wait for conversations to happen to me.  However I've found that asking questions when a wild conversation has appeared (sorry for pokemon) is quite useful and deflects conversations from me. It's not necessarily a healthy technique but I'm not dealing with Sa in the best way

High school was the lowest point in my life and I hated every second of it, I was lucky to get accepted into a college to do what I love and make awesome works of art. I quickly made friends with the teachers and professors and spent lots of time ""being myself"", being outgoing, enthusiastic and fun with everyone even during crunch time. It has been the highlight of my life and now that it's over I've slinked back into my hole of a bedroom with nothing but anxiety and depression to keep me company. :)"
socialanxiety,3dsmq8,AbrogationsCrown,2,Sun Jul 19 04:44:56 2015 UTC,Yeah it happens to me too. I'm convinced that SA is caused by some chemical imbalance in the brain that we don't know yet. Seems like those chemical balances change constantly.

A friend of mine just starts dancing randomly on the street. His body proportions aren't the most attractive, which makes him dancing funnier at times, sometimes weirder or just plain awesome depending on the context. Or he speaks out loud in the cinema commentating the movie at times, e.g. character in movie: "" I'll come back."" He: ""No you won't!!!"". Also caught him doing the finger motions to a fanfare when he thinks a joke is funny. Moreover, he is the kind of guy who doesn't mind being very close to another person (distant wise). I learned to tolerate it, though I'm still uncomfortable around him at times. Other friends of mine are more judgmental of him. Another friend of mine is just oure energy and a clown at times, jumping around in excitement etc., since I'm less energetic I sometimes what he expects me to do in certain situations. Here, other friends are more comfortable with him and usually join the fun, when he does a bit or something funny, which requires more energy, in general."

At the same time, I also have the ""fight or flight"" reaction, which causes me to want to get away from the conversation ASAP. I also have a fear of people discovering that I have social anxiety (since there's so much stigma against it these days), so when I'm visibly nervous, that just increases my anxiety.

It's like that, except it doesn't go away as long as I'm in public. You feel like everyone is watching you. You can't find the right words to talk to people and you have to rehearse everything you're going to say. Sometimes, especially in crowded places, you feel like all these people are circling around you and you're drowning in them. It's lonely, too. You lose a lot of friends, it's hard to make new ones. Jobs are really hard to get because most of us can't get past the interview stage. I can't talk on the phone without having an anxiety attack. Just hearing one ringing, even if it's not mine, sends me into panic. School is awful because there's so much forced interaction and there's no way you can escape it. It's like being trapped in a cage and all the things you fear the most are in there with you.

I'd try to end the conversations as soon as possible and keep it from being about me as much as I can.  The best conversations are when the person seems to really not give a damn about your nervousness, those times I loosen up a bit."

How are they going to hurt me? When is it going to happen? What stupid thing am I going to say that's going to inevitably bring the (deserved) pain/humiliation down upon me?  In most conversations I start off feeling backed into a corner, even when there's no obvious outward sign that the other person's angry, disapproving, a threat to me emotionally, etc. Trusting people is hard for me in almost all situations, and those people who do make it through my filters mostly do so because they're impervious to any outward signs that I'm uncomfortable and really, really don't want to talk to them. Or even look at them. Or have them look at me.  Physically, I feel tight (especially in my shoulders) and like my body's trying to cave in on itself, defensive bear stance style, to protect my vitals.

Talking to girls was a no-no. Feeling awkward and observed while crossing the street with cars waiting for the green light... Discussing with people was a huge no-no also, specially on actual discussion that were relevant (like work, family, college related). This sort of thing.  What helped me with all of those was some 3ish years of psychology therapy. Generally speaking it helped me with my self esteem. Now those situations described above can be somewhat of a issue sometimes, but nothing serious. Gradually I get more experience of things that I dont know how to do or had almost no experience, then it helps to get easier.  I did find myself suffering of what would be a ""general anxiety"" this year on 3 situations. I have depression since ever, I was having a specially bad months and there were those 3 situations where being outside my house was becoming a living hell. The sort of feeling that I didnt ""belong"" outside, I needed to be back home to feel safe and secure... This sort of thing.  Im glad things started to work out a little better and it only happend those 3 times. But it was scary as hell to think that I was developing this..."
socialanxiety,3drm64,tuliomg,2,Sat Jul 18 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"We have had quite a similar journey. Thank you so much for sharing.  Those situations you speak of, were they 'situational' or times that the discomfort appeared arbitrarily?"
socialanxiety,3drm64,Vycamros,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:23:41 2015 UTC,"Hmm...   The first one was ""lighter"". I was just going like 6 blocks away from my home to pay a bill and would comeback right after it. It was clear to me that I was feeling odd on the situation in a way I never felt (those things i said above). It was bad, but it was """"""ok"""""".  The second one I was going to a job interview (part of my today problems are job related). I was feeling terrible going there, wanted to rush back home as soon as possible. It was a nightmare. Needless to say I sucked at the interview lol  The third time I was going to a friends house that I would take literally the same bus as the one I got to reach the interview I just talked about. So it was again a living nightmare, I missed the connection I had to do and was going back to either take the right connection or go straight home. I couldn't change bus and just went back home.  So the first time I have no idea, it just happend. The second time I can safely link to the job situation. The third time would probably be heavily linked to the job interview situation by association (and perhaps whatever else)."
socialanxiety,3drm64,tuliomg,2,Mon Jul 20 21:36:55 2015 UTC,I was under the impression that the psychological community was not in agreement as to whether a hypnotic state was a legitimate thing yet. Are you claiming to be able to help people with anxieties through hypnosis?

I would be super impressed by a 16 year old taking the interview so seriously. I wouldn't take to much stock in the non-verbal communication from the interviewer. Months after I would hire someone, they would tell me how intimidated they felt in the interview and most of the time I was as nervous as them. It's awkward die both parties.   The only caveat to hiring 16 year olds is that they can only work certain hours and they can't work all positions as you need to be 18 a lot of times to work shifts in the kitchen. If anything keeps you from being hired that would be it IMHO.   That said... Good luck! Sending positive vibes your way."

Don't worry about the application though, it would just be redundant to what's on your resume.   I can tell you this... Reliability is everything in fat food. As a manager, I would rather have a person who isn't the perfect employee but is always on time and picks up shifts when needed. A person who does a good job but shows up late and never comes in when someone else is sick is almost worthless to me in a fast food job.

Granted, other people can't see it, which makes it less of a hassle for somebody with SA, but it threw me off track anyway. It turned out to be a good thing though, because one doctor noticed that my real problem was anxiety and that I overreacted to the tinnitus (which is essentially harmless) because of it. She told me to just stop thinking about it, and seek help for my SA instead, which I eventually did.  So I think you should ignore the Vitiligo as good as you can and continue with what you started."

socialanxiety,3dms1n,liz91,5,Fri Jul 17 18:29:40 2015 UTC,"Orientation was pretty scary at first. It felt like being stuck at summer camp as a young adult. But despite the publicized image, not everyone in college is super outgoing - there are plenty of awkward, quiet people.    Is there a schedule of activities throughout the weekend? I found it really helpful that the majority of the time at my orientation was structured with tours, info sessions, language placement tests, etc. One of the planned leisure activities was a movie - no conversation required - so hopefully your orientation will have some options like that. And yes, plenty of people did go to those rather than wander off and socialize in groups on their own."
socialanxiety,3dms1n,rhodavian,2,Fri Jul 17 22:58:20 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I was nervous before my college orientation. However, I met other equally nervous people and they became my friends to this day.  Honestly, don't worry too much about it. It's only one day and the people that you see at orientation might be your future friends or they might be people you won't see again. Either way, try to make the most of it, you're going to be more nervous when the first day of college arrives. But like with most things, you get used to it. I was extremely scared like you and I survived, you can too. Just try your best to meet at least one person."

It doesn't concern me too greatly either honestly, it only comes to mind when I'm in the gym. What concerns me more is that I feel I have given the impression that I'm unfriendly and not approachable. While it's not a big deal if some people don't want to speak to me, I'm worried I could be mising opportunities to form potential friendships. Even if just for the sake of practicing my social skills.  The root of the issue, I feel is I don't know how to initiate an encounter, and previuous awkward reactions to potential encounters have only made it harder. So even if they don't think that, the longer I go without breaking the ice, the more that opinion could be reinforced."

Regarding SA, college is wayyyyyyyy easier than working (or just about anything else for that matter). In college you can be totally anonymous: You don't have to show up for class if you don't feel like it, you can sit and hide in the back of the class, and nobody really gives a rats ass who you are or where you're from. The only issue you might have is that at some point you'll probably have to take a public speaking class. It's not uncommon for people with bad SA to drop out of college (or not even bother going in the first place) because of this public speaking requirement.  If you are worried about the public speaking class, consider that even here the only person paying attention to you when you're giving a speech will be the instructor..most of the students will be pre-occupied on their phones, texting, FB'ing, etc,  Now, I'm not advocating being anonymous..I think one should engage as much as they possibly can..I'm merely pointing out that it's very easy to go through college in a highly anonymous way such that it has minimal impact on SA..."

socialanxiety,3dml4k,thegreatsloth,5,Sat Jul 18 03:17:48 2015 UTC,My social anxiety is particularly bad in that just walking in busy public places is extremely stressful. I am from central London so as you can imagine it can be overwhelming to the point I feel I need to escape. I worked for one of the busiest retail stores in Europe and at first it was a nightmare. Just socializing and interacting with colleagues and customers was so awkward. I struggled to stay in the moment when people were talking to me as all these negative thoughts were spinning round my head. Eventually though I did see some improvements and I noticed I wasn't as fazed as I used to be in certain social situations. The only issue I had was sometimes I couldn't keep my awkwardness and anxiety in check so I would now and again receive funny looks from people.   I would say go for it as that is the only way you will learn to improve social skills and it will help desensitize you as well. Good luck :)

I stopped worrying so much about how I came across and if I was doing everything right. You have to remember starting a new job, no matter what the position, will be nerve wracking and everybody makes mistakes.

And I wouldn't say that looks don't matter at all, 'cus diff ppl have diff things they look for in relationships, it's just that, looking good usually doesn't hurt your case, but I'm still completely hopeless and that's why I feel like a failure 'cus people can have so little and still find 'love', and (I consider myself overall avg but I guess it's worse than I thought???)

socialanxiety,3doe85,rhodavian,2,Fri Jul 17 23:16:30 2015 UTC,"Have you gone to a gym a few times before? Before I started going to the gym, I was sure that everyone there would be athletic, buff, and super judgmental. I associated them with the assholes from high school who thought their physical prowess made them godly.    But the reality is that you will find people of all ages and all body shapes there, and most of them keep to themselves. Ultimately, you're all there to get or stay healthy and strong, and you're paying money for it just like everyone else. It's awesome that you took the first step and signed up.    I'd suggest listening to music, or at least keeping your headphones in as much possible, once you swipe in and get past the front desk. Hopefully it'll help you to focus on something other than your own thoughts, and not be worried about whether someone will try to talk to you.     Also, try to find out the peak times for your gym, and decide accordingly whether you like to blend into a big group or hang out in your own corner when it's calm."
socialanxiety,3doe85,justafuckingpear,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"I remember when I started going to the gym I would make sure I  went with my sister, that way at least I have someone to talk to and I could hide my anxiety for a bit.  But then she changed her school schedule and we couldn't go together anymore.  I panicked for a bit but I couldn't just stop going after the great results I was getting, so I literally just thought ""fuck it"" and went.  The first few days my anxiety levels were pretty high.  I thought everyone was watching my every single move.  I'd get really nervous and awkward in between sets  not knowing what to do and thought that everyone could see it.  Eventually I realized how stupid I was being and stopped thinking about the other people at the gym. It got so much better and I actually liked being in the gym just relaxing and working on getting better. Moral of  the sotry is, just go man. It really is not that big of a deal and believe me NOBODY  gives a fuck about you in the gym. I know it sounds harsh but it's the truth. Just imagine another person with sa going into the gym being really nervous and feeling judged not really knowing what to do.  Would you care about that person? I mean, would you really stare at them the whole time or laugh at them if they slightly messed up an exercise? Would you really waste your time there doing that? Of course not, and neither would anyone else at the gym. Nobody will care if you're at the gym or not. You'll be just another person there minding their own business. NOW GO GO GO!"

socialanxiety,3dmfb6,QCMSRD,2,Fri Jul 17 13:30:42 2015 UTC,"Sexual side effects.   This reason alone is why I opt to try anything other than SSRIs or SNRIs. But it is also not impossible for me to date despite having social anxiety. So I'd rather be able to function sexually and try other drug options.  If being off meds prevents you from even dating in the first place, then it seems like at least with drugs you can manage social anxiety and date someone who is ok with potential sexual disfunction vs. just not being able to date at all."
socialanxiety,3dmfb6,teknoise,2,Fri Jul 17 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Just one question though. Given that being inexperienced at dating at my age is already a major red flag/potential dealbreaker, how should I explain this kind of problem as well (if it crops up)? Should I tell her I'm taking meds somehow (taboo) or think of an alternative explanation (risky)?"
socialanxiety,3dmfb6,teknoise,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:03:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely go with being honest. I mean, don't spill it on the first date because you'll spook em, but definitely if you have sexual side affects it should be discussed prior to sex. If you wind up in a relationship they should know about this stuff anyway so lying would only sabotage things. As long as you are genuine and honest and respectful with a girl, and manage your expectations, you'd be surprised what a partner is willing to work with you on if they really like you.  That's assuming you even have side affects. Not everybody does. Some can't get it up, some can but can't cum, some can cum but it takes all night. Who knows.  Best idea is just work on controlling the social anxiety first with your doctor, and worry about potential sex side affects later when it is actually an issue."

socialanxiety,3dmfb6,newsjournalist88,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:34:28 2015 UTC,"I started taking sertraline a month ago for social anxiety and depression. The only side-effects that I noticed was drowsiness (take it before bed so this isn't a downside really) and diarrhea for a few days. That being said, side-effects vary among people so you may or may not experience any of the side-effects. I've tried several different meds, and I have found that the side-effects are generally mild and go away after a few days. Going off SSRIs is kinda shitty though. For most medications, I have been light-headed for about a week and had ""brain zaps."" Whether or not you will need to take meds forever will depend on how you respond to them. Some people take them for a bit then stop, some take them forever. I wouldn't worry too much about that though because you don't have to keep taking them if you don't want to. I smoke weed every day and it doesn't affect me any differently. I have never heard of SSRIs that are affected by weed. Alcohol, however, you need to be careful with. When you are on an SSRI, the alcohol hits you a lot faster and harder. Normally, it would take me several drinks to start feeling the effects, but on medication it only takes a few sips. I have never had any problems with drinking while on medication, but you need to conscious of how you feel. No sex life before or after medication, so I can't really speak to that but a reduced libido and difficulty ejaculating are common symptoms in SSRIs (not all though). I have many of the issues that you mentioned, and I would suggest you try medication. I haven't found one that works very well for me yet, but I am going to continue trying. For me, the negatives of medication are fairly small and the possibility of actually feeling like a person far outweighs them.   TL;DR: May as well try them."

In the end, when the people who kept talking were interviewed by the people conducting the research, they commented that they found the person who kept asking questions to actually be interesting.

Once I'm caught up in people pleasing, I have a really hard time yanking myself out of it. Kind or unusually empathetic people tend to trigger it hardest, which sucks because they're the people most likely to see and be freaked out by the underlying sense of desperation (and also because people like this probably make great friends, and are people that it really sucks to fuck up around if your goal is to make people like you/make friends).  Although tbh, thinking about it again, I think my people pleasing comes more from a place of wanting to placate others so they don't hurt or humiliate me. :/"

socialanxiety,3dkxpl,SamuraiPizzaCatz,3,Fri Jul 17 02:43:51 2015 UTC,"Hey, I feel your pain! Firstly, to think that women would only want you for your money, or social circle or education is incorrect. There is a million ways to show a woman you are dedicated to her and can give her a great life with you besides the number written on your pay check each week. I'm a girl, trust me I know :)  Secondly, you mention that you wish you could go back to 20 and sort shit out. It is NEVER too late to try something new, get educated or get skilled. And in perspective, 20 was only 3 years ago for you!!!! That's only 3 YEARS! You might think it's too late to do anything about your situation, but soon enough you'll be 30, or 40, or 70 and you'll think ""why didn't I do this when I was 23?!?!""  Thirdly, if you need someone to talk to, you can send me a message! I'm 22 and 2 years ago I felt the same. I felt like my friends didn't like me, I felt like everything was going downhill and i'd missed out on the best years. But I went away for a year and everything got so so so much better. I felt more confident in myself, made tons of friends. Changed my life.  Everything you want to get is in your control!!!"

I've told myself the same thing about ""dude it's just 3 years.. what are you going to do, wait every 3 years to wish you could have done something 3 years ago?"". Worst is, when I was 20 I was feeling like I Should have done it by 17!  My thought process about women goes like this: I expect myself to be a provider for a woman; I want to protect and provide, and part of that includes being able to drive her/kids places. Without my licence I feel useless to a woman since I can't pick her up, take her places, show her a great time. I also want to have a high paying job to ensure that both her needs and the kids' needs (long term) are met with ample money for emergencies + nice things. Materialism isn't exactly the goal, but being able to convey to a girl ""I can protect you; I can provide for you"" is very, very important to me, and as of right now I am proper useless to any woman.  Thank you for the offer; I might take you up on it if I feel as intense as I did last night :).

I feel sorry for guys with all the pressure to be the provider. Ambition goes a long way though, and many girls will happily support your dreams knowing that times may be tough in the short term. There are plenty of men and women perfectly content with no license, no job, no money, lack of friends or relationships. But you seem like you really want to change yourself and you want to do better so you've got over the first step! Driving isn't a difficult skill, honestly, once you get your license and you can drive unassisted, it will be irrelevant how much driving experience you've had. Plenty of people grow up around good public transport and don't get their license till later, so you're not alone at all. Take small steps. Research options of education or increasing your skills if thats what you're after. And new friendships come from all different places. It's okay to feel down though and it's normal to feel directionless. But there is always avenues for change. Anyway, sorry for the secondary comment!

I think everyone has something to be insecure about. I'm definitely insecure about some things, myself. It's not the end of the world, man. Just because your friends got to do things earlier in life than you did, doesn't mean you don't have options. Terrible, talentless people find success, women, and different kinds of happiness all the time; I've seen it with my own eyes. Plenty of people go to college in their late 20's and 30's. Plenty of people in their 30's and 40's go out partying. Its not too late. 23 is still very young, like you said. Another thing, don't let your friends have too much control over what ""normal"" is supposed to mean. Yeah, they might have a car and a college education and whatnot, but that doesn't mean they're normal, or even happy. They could have a strange part of themselves they keep from people. My best advice to you, is broaden your perspective. ""Normal"" and ""successful"" can mean all kinds of things."

They have no impact on your life, they do not change anything, and you don't need their approval. People judge each other all the time.   What matters if you know you're a good person. Your best friend likes you, doesn't he? If you're a good friend and a good person, who gives two shits what some jerk in a cab thinks about you.  I think your problem is a bit like mine, you feel like society expects all these things, like talking in a cab, being confident enough to sing out loud, etc  Don't. Do whatever makes you feel at ease. That's confidence in a way. People can tell if you're nervous, or desperate. I still do this too, but...  If you like walking, walk. If a cab is more comfortable, take a cab. You don't need to talk to people, you don't need to walk in and out of the car like a boss. Those people don't pay attention and probably'll forget you.   You don't need to be a super charming, outgoing person if you prefer not to make contact with strangers. Figure out what your priorities are, and what's worth your energy.

socialanxiety,3di0m7,PlatformLumos,10,Thu Jul 16 12:58:38 2015 UTC,"OP, I was the same in high school. I was completely cool with going home straight after school and doing my own thing. I had some friends and acquaintances. But after class I rarely ever did anything besides go home and play video games and watch TV shows. I thought I was fine too, and the only thing I worried about was my parents and family thinking I was a loner when in reality I was fine with how things were going.  I'm in university now, and I don't feel the same way. I've lost touch with the friends and acquaintances I've made in high school, the ones I never did anything with after class. (I went to a different city for uni). And because of my lack of social experience, not knowing how to put myself out there, approach other people- I don't have any friends. The thing is it was fine in High School because everyone was forced to be in class and I mingled naturally. In university, If you're in a lecture you don't really mingle, you can't naturally make friends and a lot of the time people already have their own group of friends that, in the chaos of college, they stay together all the time.  And now I have to find random people to share residence with and I simply don't know anybody. I don't have lab partners, I don't even sit with anyone I know during lectures. I don't have study buddies. I never did anything after class. I went to university and went home.  I realized the hard way that this is not what I want. I want friends. I'm ridiculously introverted and I used to judge other people thinking they weren't my type of friends. I kept everyone at arms length. But at this point I realized that the company of other people is exactly what I've been missing in my life. And making friends, having conversation, putting myself out there vulnerably and honestly is difficult but worth it.  You might not be anything like me, maybe you don't really care for friends legitimately. But in the case that you are, I just don't want you to make the same mistakes I did."

socialanxiety,3di0m7,Qwertyllama,2,Thu Jul 16 22:15:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, I see. That reminds me of this one post on reddit that's sorta similar. Hard to find though, it was super highly rated because a guy found out why he wasn't super popular and why his acquaintances were better friends with someone who wasn't as funny, good-looking or smart as he was. He was wondering why no one really invites him out as much as that other guy until he straight up asked one of his acquaintances. And the acquaintance pulled him aside and said something like ""ok do you know why we're better friends with him? When have you ever invited us out to do something? You've never made an effort to initiate anything. While (the other guy) invites us to hang out all the time.""  Sometimes it's not that they don't like you, it's that they don't think you like them back. Or am I like way off mark here? ._."

All I do know is that if you're genuine about wanting to make friends, you don't judge people, you're nice, you take an interest in people, your interactions are honest, and show some personality (unloading all at once would be overwhelming), you're confident. I don't care how weird you are, you'll definitely make friends. And I also know that it's really tough with SA, but nothing's worse than having no friends at all."

socialanxiety,3din30,SpoonerSpork,3,Thu Jul 16 16:02:07 2015 UTC,"All of the the scenarios that you've just described sound like general insecurity and lack of confidence to me. I'm far from an expert in this kind of stuff, but I can relate somewhat. You're making big assumptions about things that could in reality be very far off. Your friend not speaking to you could be because they're busy and haven't had a chance to get back to you. Someone being short or blunt with you may be because they didn't feel it was necessary to elaborate more.   It's really easy to attribute any perceived wrongdoing to yourself, but often times it's probably very unlikely. You can also ask if you're unsure. Just recently, I said some very foolish things to a girl friend of mine and she hadn't replied back to me. Just like you, I assumed that she was upset or offended by it so I sent her a very apologetic message and she simply told me that everything was perfectly fine and that she had just been really busy with work and that if I ever needed anything to just let her know. People don't always have to be in contact with you for them to care about you or even like you for that matter.   These are more practical ways of looking at it; as far as the general feeling goes, I can't really offer an explanation for that. I think it just comes down to the fact that I always want to be viewed positively by those I care about. I'm sorry you feel useless, pathetic, and stressed. All I can say is that seeking a professional to talk about these feelings is probably in your best interest because they can hit home with where these feelings are surfacing from. Best of luck!"

And honestly, it sucks to hear this, but the only thing left for you to do is literally the problem itself. You have to find a way to tell that voice to leave you alone. It takes some serious inner strength to combat these feelings. When I was going through a similar rough patch of self doubt and lack of confidence, I felt that I was always telling myself that I couldn't do X or that I wasn't good enough for Y. But one morning, I shit you not, I just stopped letting those feelings percolate. I literally overnight decided that I wasn't going to deal with that shit anymore because I had a life to live.   I'm by no means completely confident in myself and still struggle, but I took a big step in the right direction by telling that voice to fuck off essentially. I don't mean to make it sound easier than it is, I got lucky. Something happened to me and the next day I was ready to resume my life. But I've read similar things on this sub, that means it can also happen to you. However, it's not something you can force. Take your time, be patient, but know deep down that you're ready stop living this way."

socialanxiety,3di8dg,Ryanc98,2,Thu Jul 16 14:07:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm awful with this. Before exams, if my stomach was beginning to growl I would have a panic attack. I'd need to go to the bathroom, feeling very hot, shaking, sweating, trying not to cry or vomit. I'm currently a Masters student, so, as you could imagine, I've done a hellova lot of exams.  The fear would consume my mind so much that I wouldn't be able to concentrate properly. I would finish the exam as quickly as possible to leave the room as soon as I could. I know my fear definitely had a very negative impact on my performance in exams and I know I could have done a lot better if I had been able to concentrate.  But, touch wood, my stomach has never growled during an exam.  The only time this has happened was in high school. There was a quiet moment at assembly and my stomach rumbled so loudly that everyone in my grade's seating area turned and looked. I was horrified. But everyone just laughed and assembly carried on like nothing had happened! :)  Usually people will just ignore the rumble. But, if it's loud enough that someone next to you giggles or something, just respond with ""I'm hungry!"" or ""Good thing lunch break is soon!""  Nobody really cares if your tummy rumbles, except you!"
socialanxiety,3di8dg,rhiskisnoir,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:02:03 2015 UTC,"Yep. It's hard but, you just have to try and not think about it. I sometimes feel that thinking about it makes it growl more!

socialanxiety,3dilv5,HeroicPopsicle,4,Thu Jul 16 15:53:25 2015 UTC,"Usually people who play board games are very open people. Either try to talk to someone at the hobby shop, or maybe just post on the facebook page if there is one if that's easier for you. Just say that you're interested in starting to play warhammer and were wondering if anyone could give you a crash course. Or maybe just ask them as they're playing a few questions. I play magic the gathering a lot at various stores and am always happy to answer questions for those who are genuinely curious while I'm playing. Good luck!"

socialanxiety,3dilv5,Brightcab,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:59:27 2015 UTC,Is it at a store that sells board games? If so maybe ask an employee about what they're playing and that you're interested. If he sells warhammer figurines or whatever you're playing he'd be happy to have a new customer.  If not just muster all your courage and walk up to their playgroup and tell them you'd like to learn what they're playing and if it'd be okay if you watched. They'd probably oblige you and explain the game to you.
socialanxiety,3dilv5,Starviv,2,Sat Jul 18 16:27:26 2015 UTC,"Actually took me a lot of courage to write to them, did so this morning and they seemed quite happy to introduce me to the games (mostly warhammer was played though, holy crap the amount of rules!).  I went there, it was ok i guess, they where all quite busy playing but happily answered any questions i had, I went home a little earlier than i though cause i was getting anxious (usually happens after prologned social exposours :/ ) but i told them i'm coming back there, and they were happy to have me :)  So i guess i kinda won over myself? :)"
socialanxiety,3dilv5,greyflcn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"This is true to an extent. At least when I went to a board game group, generally if they are playing in a public space they are happy to answer questions or be a bit more welcoming to other people that want to join or are interested in what they are doing. Also the group I attend has a mixture of people from professionals just enjoying a part of their weekend to people that are pretty socially awkward that want to play some board games. The ages are varied in the group as well. If they are advertising it they are probably pretty open to new players. So enjoy yourself, if the group doesn't fit your style there are also other groups that you can find to match your interest."

socialanxiety,3dgjv5,Meteor_Soup,2,Thu Jul 16 06:01:58 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you live especially if its in a big city applying online is pretty useless because they get a billion applications and usually resort to just binnning applications. The only way I guess is to get a job is to ask ; that's where the social anxiety kinda gets in the way. You have to just print off 20 copies of your cv and start at your local shopping centre.  I just did it the other day and yeah it was scary but the more you think about the harder its gets. Just take a deep breath and dive into it. It only takes 30 secs of talking and soon it becomes routine like "" I was wondering do you guys have any jobs available "" etc  Good luck with the job hunting :)"
socialanxiety,3dgjv5,SkinnyThing,2,Fri Jul 17 06:02:17 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel. I only had 1 job so far (I'm only 20) and I left it only four months after being there due to my anxiety I'd get in the mornings and also the place treated me like crap and was tremendously unprofessional (my other reasons for leaving). I would wake up and almost instantly have a panic attack for about 10 minutes before getting ready for work. The funny thing was, once I got to work I felt completely fine. I never got an ounce of anxiety as soon as I'd step foot in the place. This was an ongoing thing everyday for 4 months. I was just tired of waking up like that but unfortunately quitting that job didn't help me get rid of my morning anxiety and also wasn't the reason for it. But it did give me some sort of relief.  Just about the only way to fight this anxiety is to literally force yourself to talk to people whether you're feeling super anxious in that moment or not. I've done this quite a lot and I can actually say that I've started to get better with talking to others I don't know instead of feeling frozen and like my voice disappeared as someone tries to ask me the time. My first time applying to my first job had me shitting bricks like no other. I sat in the car with my mother outside of the building and did some breathing exercises and just when I stopped feeling that pit in my stomach(it was only a brief second of relief), I got myself out the car and charged into the building. I made myself look confident by putting a smile on my face, looking the people in their eyes, and confidently asking them if I could fill out an application. I finished the application and when I turned it in, I did not expect to have to deal with an on-spot interview... with the owner of the building. But I didn't let that scare me. Instead of thinking, ""What the hell am I going to say? Am I even ready to do this? I'm just going to fuck up my opportunity to have a secure job right here with this interview."" I thought positive thoughts such as, ""I got this. I know the answer to everything he is going to ask me. I'm going to get this job and get this money. I'm going to make my family proud once I get this job. I WILL get this job and I will be good at it. Lets do this."" and with that alone helped me through everything.  I'm just talking about my own experience and I hope that maybe you could get some tips from a fellow friend with SA. I wish you good luck in your search for a job. The right one will come to you. I believed I would never get a job after I had submitted so many applications. But luck was on my side and I managed to find that job even if it was just temporary! But if you do get a job and you feel very uncomfortable because of your SA, please please please do not think you have to force yourself to hold that job. Money can wait. Your mental health is more important."

I agree the only way to get past your anxiety is to confront it head on but honestly its kind of terrifying. Congrats on getting the job by the way. I managed to call 3 people today in order to acquire about the status of my applications and it went pretty well.  I agree its important to have a positive outlook and personality :)
socialanxiety,3dgjv5,hannahtheaspie,2,Fri Jul 17 05:58:12 2015 UTC,"I know exactly how you feel. As someone in his twenties without any work, I know I need to get a job. Even applying online takes a massive amount of resolve. Where I live, the opportunities are dismal enough without my anxiety killing my motivation. Additionally, as soon as I see ""Good interpersonal skills"" needed or any little thing I know would cause me anxiety, I seem to automatically dismiss the job offering. It's stressful."
socialanxiety,3dgjv5,EnterpriseNCC1701D,2,Thu Jul 16 13:17:33 2015 UTC,"I think the key is just to read some tips on how to ask for a job and perform at interviews. I think of my life as a game. So I go online, I read some guide on how to go through level ""get a job"", and then I repeat what other people do. Eventually, you start developping your own (slightly modified) way of doing it.   Maybe it is the fear of failure that actually pushes me to go through the hardship of dealing with those situations. I guess fear can be helpful after all :)"
socialanxiety,3djfir,interroga_omnia,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:28:09 2015 UTC,"A couple things that helped me at some point:   Breathing exercises DURING the stressful situation. I have a problem of shoving away my anxiety and feelings during these situations just to seem more normal and it builds up and makes my head all foggy. Realizing that people care about themselves more than you. This doesn't always help since I have a stubborn head, but occasionally realizing that they are more worried about how they look, their problems, or even their own social anxiety. They will probably forget you even existed after a few hours. Finding something that's relaxing for you. For some reason, eating at a dinner table relaxes me more than anything, and it helps get me through an anxiety attack for a few hours before it flairs up again. Last but not least, trying to have a mind set of wanting to get into the stressful situations. This is more helpful in the longer run. Dreading opening the door or phone calls will just make them harder to get through. Eventually, they will just stop bothering you all together. I'm able to go through checkout lines and answer the door because of this (though I'm still absolutely terrified of the phone)."

Several books and therapy methods is about this, and it's basicly called exposure therapy. If you combine exposure therapy and also enable yourself to not feel ashamed by letting people see the sympthoms and struggle, you are on the path to a healthy life, my friend. Also the more you do this, the better you will become.. the more you let the anxiety be and not act on it, the easier it will become to keep going forward. This is a proven fact. It is neuroplasticity. Your brain will eventually become an expert at not acting on anxiety.  Unfortunately I feel like I just cannot show them my inner fears. I just can't help to avoid my biggest fears. I am phobic to certain situations and I just can't do it. This is about social judgement for me. I will rather people kind of know how miserable I am, than actually show them all my actual fears and phobias. Because I am phobic. Frightened. Slightly paranoid."

socialanxiety,3ddchr,SpaceNavy,4,Wed Jul 15 17:43:39 2015 UTC,"This ^ is pretty much exactly my train of thought. I used to stay home and avoid literally everything associated with living a normal life, but now I feel like I can face anything as awkwardly as I please and without trying to make myself look cool, like a cucumber. It's very simple, but somehow (thus far, I hope I never relapse) it's working like magic.   One thing that helps me (and might not help anyone else) is to stay realistic. None of this means that I'm guaranteed to get hired in an interview or even be liked by anyone as a result. It's just the lack of anxiety that's totally 'wow'ing me"

I used to hole up all the time but now I force myself to go out into social situations that make me uncomfortable.  Its not always fun, but it helps.  You need to teach your brain not to get anxious.  I still worry and obsess over little things during or afterwards, but it is getting better.  I'm a lot more at ease around people;Stammering, mangling sentences, mumbling, fidgeting, shaking, and all the other anxiety symptoms have lessened over all and sometimes they just vanish completely and I don't even realize it until afterwards.  Exposure therapy works.  It can be misery at first but it will gradually get better."

I only stopped when I forced my mind to change the subject or start singing a song in my head. TBH I never really did get over that, it comes back occasionally...  When I was even younger I suddenly got a real fear of someone breaking in as well. It might have been from a TV show where they show reconstructions of burglaries or something.

socialanxiety,3deiwc,simonoberst,2,Wed Jul 15 20:49:07 2015 UTC,"The first part eases the mind because it relieves pressure to be ""as good"" as other people. We all are simply what we are. Having a ""place"" or ""role"" in this life is an illusion, plain and simple.   I really disagree with this. Society values some traits over others, and if you have a trait that society says is bad or wrong, you're looked down on for that, and are given less opportunities in life (including less job offers and less offers of friendship) than those who have the valued traits. This isn't ""an illusion"" and calling it such is harmful, because it ignores the very real prejudices that exist in our society.   The second part, clarifying that ""I am no better than them"" keeps you balanced. You don't have to prove anything. No matter how much money you make, how many mates you attract, etc...nothing truly changes.   Really? You think that nothing changes when a person goes from being poor to having enough money to live on? You think that nothing changes when a person goes from being friendless and miserably lonely to having some friends? Pretending that the only changes that matter are those in your mind requires ignoring the fact that external changes can help people be happier. And why ignore that fact?   Next time you walk out the door to the grocery store, a party, or wherever you think your SA might spike, repeat this statement to yourself, BUY IN to it, and see what happens.   And if that causes a panic attack, then what? Seems like you just don't care about that. You don't care about how harmful your little philosophy could be to people."
socialanxiety,3deiwc,hannahtheaspie,2,Wed Jul 15 22:38:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I was just sharing something that worked for me and posted with the intention of trying to help others. If you hate the idea, by all means, don't do it :)  I also understand your thinking, and find myself feeling exactly the same often times. Your first critique is correct--we are affected by our perceived status. How I should have worded it, is that we shouldn't be. So part of buying in to this ""philosophy"" as you call it is to recognize society's prejudices as a mistake. One that you needn't participate in. When you walk into a room knowing that everyone is equal...really really knowing it...the anxiety might not be as strong. And when you manage to enter this anxiety-free zone, the friends and fun times and opportunities begin to flow. That's the insidious part of social anxiety, no? The anxiety itself makes us less likely to attract things we want. The trick is letting go. That shouldn't be news to anyone.  I'm not trying to suggest this is easy or even possible for many people. Thinking this thought and buying into it would not have happened for me a year ago, or even a few months ago. Being capable of grasping this idea is a big step for me. I may have written originally as though it's some easy thing and I apologize."

I'm sort of suggesting that we become the embodiment of the solution. Again, not easy!   I don't know about you but I have a terrible habit of criticizing people. And how silly! I ruminate all day about what others think or say about me when I'm doing exactly that about other people?  I am a scientifically minded person despite the philosophical mumbo jumbo, but I do believe there's a connection between the internal and external, and not necessarily that the latter always influences the former.  So, the goal (for me) is to be the opposite of the attitude we as SA sufferers fear, which is the attitude of judgement. I find that when I pull this off (non-judgement), everything improves."

Like others have said, I write out what I want to say and that helps some but not always.  It usually takes me several tries to dial the number.  I will get part way through the number 2 or 3 times before I can actually just dial it all and let it start ringing.  I have to try and take deep breaths to calm myself down enough and I have to pause when I'm talking so that I don't start tripping over my words.  For some reason I've always had a thing about saying my own name and introducing myself, I hate doing it, and so that also plays a factor into the calling thing."

After that, the coach is available by text, email, or scheduled phone call, and theyâre supposed to reach out once a week.   So basically, this program expects people with social anxiety to be able to reach out to their coach on their own, after having just a 30-minute conversation with them? Wow. They really don't understand social anxiety (especially severe social anxiety) at all. Us socially anxious people need to be constantly reached out to, since we struggle so much with reaching out to others. I don't see this program being successful at all."

socialanxiety,3df0hc,hannahtheaspie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:57:12 2015 UTC,"CBT has been proven to be one of the most effective ways to handle social anxiety.  Short of a purely online course a coach is simply replacing a therapist or whoever else you use to talk to about your issues.  As someone who has been dating a social anxious person for 3 years she finds it a hell of a lot easier to handle a single person in a stress free situation than it is to have to deal with a crows of people, a doctors office, or sometimes just having to go outside where people are there period.    I'm not sure how much more you can remove people from the equation and still get effective help I guess.    Theoretically you are already doing one on one  interactions in your life at work, to get hired, or just in general so this isn't much more than what you are already having to deal with.    I wasn't trying to ignore your reason, I thought it related to simply having to reach out which I can see being an issue but not so much when it's just a matter of you having to answer the phone.  They also do an introduction phone call so that's not much more different than trying to date, opening a bank account, seeing a doctor or any other business transaction.  Theoretically this is also someone who is or has experience coaching.    I'm not sure there can ever be a truly social free way of dealing with social anxiety and have it be effective.  I feel that's perhaps a little unrealistic I guess?  Curiously enough my girlfriend has improved hers by mounds due to the nature of the business I run and her having moved in here :P  Occupational therapy haha.  (We run an Airbnb so she was simply exposed to situations daily that made her uncomfortable.  At first she would hide in the bedroom which we had designated as her safe zone.  At first she was back in there after 5-10 minutes in the living room with one or two other guests and maybe she'd come back out for another round of time.  Now she'll stay out there in a room full of random guests for an hour or two at times and come back later.  She went from daily anxiety attacks several times a day to it being much more sporadic which is awesome.  )  To be fair though, this system looks like they reach out to you and you just need to pick up which still might be uncomfortable, but seems the easier and less of two evils since interacting with anyone, period, can trigger an issue.  Further, it also looks as if you don't have to have a call and can do this via email or text message which should help severe cases until you ARE comfortable enough for a call and they are no longer some random person."

socialanxiety,3dgsu9,t_11,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:44:29 2015 UTC,You're engaged
socialanxiety,3dgsu9,veedubb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:00:43 2015 UTC,Is that a problem?
socialanxiety,3dgsu9,t_11,2,Thu Jul 16 06:42:24 2015 UTC,"No. But I don't think you have social anxiety. I think maybe you're developing some insecurity of sorts and you can figure it out. Social anxiety has the deepest impact to some of us especially when it comes to relationship. I don't want to diagnose you, but I don't want you self-diagnosing yourself either. This isn't a disorder you wanna convince yourself you have."
socialanxiety,3dgsu9,veedubb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:05:49 2015 UTC,"I was previously married, and I have social anxiety... I just found someone I felt comfortable around. I don't think it's SA, but mostly because he says he is social.  OP are you planning on seeing anyone regarding your concern? That might be best if you are trying to put a name to the monster you're worried about. :)"
socialanxiety,3dgsu9,t_11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:51:26 2015 UTC,Great! My social anxiety has manifested on me.not being able to create or maintain any relationships. Many people share this concern. Very glad for you both. I was under the impression that the presence of an SO will boost confidence.

As you read it, you might think that his tips are common sense but then there would be no need for the book. The tips are good reminders of the simple things you can do to have better social interactions. It's not too long of a read and a good book to read over again. Do buy."

socialanxiety,3decqc,melebula,3,Wed Jul 15 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"Do you think you really don't care what other people have to say, or is this a new way that your anxiety is manifesting itself (as a defense mechanism of sorts)?"
socialanxiety,3decqc,lesbianoralien,3,Wed Jul 15 17:53:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure. I spent years as a teenager actually being interested in people and wanting to talk to them, only to be rejected. Now I'm 23 and too tired/apathetic to bother, so I've legitimately stopped caring. I guess that could count as a defense mechanism.  I have this unconscious conditioned belief from years of bullying that strangers are people who will ultimately reject me and generally not care about what I have to say, so I don't see them as actually worth my time. It doesn't hurt me anymore to think this way, I've just kind of passively accepted it as reality."
socialanxiety,3decqc,SocialLifeCoach,3,Wed Jul 15 18:22:27 2015 UTC,"These things work kind of like this:  You are rejected enough times and then create a shield around ourselves to protect us.  At first it is nice to have that persona or psychic layer between us and the world but...  What starts off as a protective barrier soon becomes a prison.  My guess is that the shield you created was a person that doesn't care what others think.  Protected you for a while but now it is hindering what you want:  a larger social group.  The tough part is that in order to eliminate your protective shiled/prison, you need to be vulnerable.  that means you need to allow yourself to be unprotected...which means you could feel the pain of rejection again.  The sad joke is that we can turn ALL of our emotions off or ALL of them on.  We can't just turn off the negative ones.    So are you willing to take the good with the bad?  Would you be willing to be vulnerable enough to risk feeling rejection in order to ""GET WHAT YOU WANT NOW""?"
socialanxiety,3decqc,lesbianoralien,2,Wed Jul 15 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"I have definitely felt this way before.  In the past I've found it very hard to trust kindness from others because I always assumed I was being set-up or manipulated.  I told myself that I just didn't like people and didn't want friends.  For me, this turned out not to be true though, because I was deeply unhappy and lonely. I think that if you are unhappy right now, then maybe these thoughts really are hurting you. I tend not to think like this anymore, and I think it helped me to realize that most people really do enjoy talking to others, and they aren't out to reject or hurt you.  I enjoy asking people questions about themselves and carrying on a friendly conversation because I can tell that it makes them feel good.  I'm not sure if that's relevant to your situation or not, though.  It did help me break out of some of my negative feelings about others and myself."
socialanxiety,3de4j1,simonoberst,2,Wed Jul 15 15:43:05 2015 UTC,Is lonesome the same as lonely (I'm not native) ?
socialanxiety,3de4j1,TaphGiraffe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:29:56 2015 UTC,"yeah, ""lonesome"" is pretty much the same as ""lonely"", not to be confused with ""being alone"" (which it frequently is...). ""loneliness"" is the feeling of sadness from being alone. it is possible to be ""alone"" but not ""lonely"". as an introvert, this can get very hard to explain to an extrovert, lol..."
socialanxiety,3de4j1,docvictor,2,Thu Jul 16 03:34:36 2015 UTC,"How do I handle such moments? Maybe I just don't handle them. I do feel ashamed of being lonely, that's why I avoid social networks on fridays and saturdays, so people can't tell I don't have a nice social life."
socialanxiety,3de4j1,TaphGiraffe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:57:23 2015 UTC,"I also feel ashamed of being lonely, which is a major problem for me. I'm thinking that overcoming this shame could be a big step forward, but I don't know how to do it. I'm trying now to say to me that everybody has exactly the same (high) worth. That would mean that you have the same high worth as any other human being regardless if you are lonely or not. I guess, if one could stop feeling ashamed then one can handle this loneliness feeling much better."
socialanxiety,3de4j1,docvictor,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:11:55 2015 UTC,"i am literally in the same boat as you. i do enjoy my alone time, but i've been so lonesome these past few months after coming out of the closet and discarding my religion and transferring to a new school, etc; i don't have any friends to hang out with and because of my social anxiety and low self-esteem, i have a hard time making new friends.  maybe i should try getting out more, even if it's just to walk around campus a bit, like you do..."

It is pretty pointless bottling up anger and going into debates in your head when all that happens is that you consume a lot of time and you get really hot-headed. If you catch yourself thinking thoughts like that you should immediately stop and remind yourself that they aren't worth your attention.  And you really shouldn't overextend yourself. When you push yourself too far, you end up scarring yourself more than you rehabilitate. So listen to what you feel."

Showing understanding and compassion is really part of their professional job, and if they are not good at it they actually suck alittle bit at their job.  To be fair, it probably isn't normal for a full grown OP to outright start crying in the middle of the pharmacy, but I'll be damned if it isn't those moments they truly hold hold dear as a special moment where they were able to offer a shoulder and some words of support.  In any case OP, you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed about, and frankly if I saw you standing there and crying your guts out at the pharmacy, I would see a man with alot of love in his heart."
socialanxiety,3dbgdl,newsjournalist88,3,Wed Jul 15 00:05:42 2015 UTC,Thank you for the reassurance and kind words. I only started crying after I told her that my mother was unavailable to call about information because she was in the hospital and the pharmacist looked concerned and asked if I was okay. That's what got me started and I couldn't stop. It's been a long time since someone asked if I was okay.
socialanxiety,3dbgdl,Tygrion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:24:47 2015 UTC,"OP, this story really reminds me of a time long ago when I was taking my drivers license. A freshman at my high-school was run over and killed by a car. I knew his sister, which was in my class, and it was considered a terrible accident in our community. I was at a memorial for him in the gymnastics hall, when I had to take my leave for an appointment with my driving instructor, ironically. So I got over there and explained why I was a little late. The receptionist asked me if I was OK?   I could not have been prepared for the amount of tears that just exploded out of me. The accident had nothing to do with me, and there I was.. absolutely devasted. Fortunately they canceled my appointment, and I didn't even have to pay. I was ashamed of myself that I let this happen, and I felt selfish. And I was not OK at the time, although nobody could ever see how much I was hurting inside.. except for my driving instructor that is."
socialanxiety,3db2cj,ZTB,3,Tue Jul 14 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that you two had a good chemestry. At least from your perspective. You say that she probably got annoyed, because you didn't have anything to say. You also say you feel dumb for posting about this, and a quick peak at your post history is of relevance to my following statement. You have a tendency to project negative circumstantial assumptions onto yourself. So we should probably not only listen too much to what your inner voice says about all this, but maybe explore other assumptions about how you lost connection.  You do not mention if this was a romantic-ish relationship or if it was just casual. Or both. I'm assuming it's romantic.  Let us be very clear here, my friend OP, if you two had a casual flirty relationship for some time without any of you actually properly committing to taking the first step, go on a date, do something romantic together, it is very likely that it just fades naturally like this, it happens often. It has happend to me.. and my friends. Not necessarily because you didn't have anything to say.  It might just happen that she will be very delighted to chat with you and catch up. Before I met my gf, while I was in an SSRI induced hypomanic mental state, I catched up with a girl from the past that I just ""lost contact with"", just like you did here. I didn't really have anything to say, and I didn't do anything keep in touch. And I didn't ask her out on a date. Turns out that she likely would have rejected me if I did. Thats right, she thought I was pretty weird. But AFTER I texted her and we talked for a bit 3 years after we lost touch, we did go on a date. And it was great.  It never hurts to ask how she's doing."
socialanxiety,3db2cj,Syndexic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, we both liked each other and it was pretty obvious, I just never properly asked her out or anything cause I figured she would reject me and then we would never talk again. Then we stopped talking anyway.  I regret not actually asking her out. I wanna get back in touch with her, because maybe then we could finally go on a date or something like that. I just have so much anxiety when it comes to talking to anyone though, so I will have to force myself to do this. I never initiate conversation with anyone. I hope I can this time, though."
socialanxiety,3db2cj,the-blueberry,2,Wed Jul 15 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"If it was obvious, in your position I would just explain.   Maybe it's a little overbearing, but it's what I'd honestly do. If I had no doubts about a girl liking me, and the only reason we stopped talking was because of my SA, I'd just say ""Hey, it's me name here I know we lost contact a while back, and I'd really like to talk again.""  After it's been established that she wants to talk to you, just explain to her why you lost contact in the first place.   Honestly though, go with whatever you feel is best for you. Just because it's what I'd do doesn't mean it's the right thing. :P Best of luck though. Don't let your fear ruin what could be a great relationship.  You can either be afraid, or decide to go after her, but you can't do both. Seriously though dude, best of luck I am totally cheering you on (:"

socialanxiety,3d9711,farcry9001,7,Tue Jul 14 14:08:44 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Listen for information to build on after asking a basic question, respond from one or two points, and continue.  I've paid attention to a lot of posts that deal with this specific thing because it's a weakness of mine that I want to address. I don't consider myself a boring person, and I don't think you should either for that matter. Not to sound too cliche, but everyone has something to contribute and whether you realize it or not.   The one thing that's worked so far for me is to listen really well and find something to respond to, whether there's a degree of importance to you or not. It keeps the conversation going and shows that you're paying attention. It's unlikely that you'll always be surrounded by people with the same interests as you so finding things to respond to are crucial. It seems superficial and fake, but I don't think that's necessarily true; in my opinion, conversations should be about finding something to be interested in and responding. If you don't much about anything else, as you say, there are ways you can show interest in what a person says without knowing everything about what their talking about.  If you ask me, ""How was your day?"" and I respond, ""It was good, I read Plato's Republic, walked my dog, ate sushi, and watched Lost."" If I fail to ask you about your day, leave it at that, and you don't know about any of those things, you have a few things to respond to:  Plato: What is that about? What made me want to read such a thing? How I got into political theory, etc.  Dog: What kind of dog? Where did I go to walk my dog? Did I see anything interesting on my walk?  Sushi: What kind of sushi? Where did I get my sushi from? How was it? Would I recommend the place I went to?   Lost: What's the show about? Who are my favorite characters? Have I watched it before? How far into the show am I? What do I like about Lost?  Of course, I wouldn't ask all of these questions, that would come off as a little burdensome and seem like an interview. Instead, ask one or two and respond to whatever information they give you.  It's definitely a process and takes a lot of time to develop. Luckily I have a roommate who is an incredibly social person and I've observed the way he interacts with me and other people. Try to get into these kinds of situations with people often and it'll become less stressful. Good luck!  Edit: Took out a bit of redundancy"
socialanxiety,3d9711,I_LOVE_PLATO,3,Tue Jul 14 16:49:35 2015 UTC,"If you have no common interests I would probably say then you don't honestly want to actually talk to other people about the common stuff people talk about.  My math teacher made a statement yesteday. ""The definition of normal is the majority people who do common things. If you're not part of the group that does common things then you are not normal"".  In the past the idea of ""not being normal"" hurt me really much, but I've become quite objective about it. I think when you're like this and you actually just wanna talk to people who share your interests and not all the social superficial fluff, then you really shouldn't try to have common conversations with anyone.  I think most people think it's a waste of time to converse if neither person is really engaged in the subject you're talking about, unless of course there's some kind of chemistry or bonding that makes you interested in each other's aura.  I have one really good friend whom I only share one big interest with, which is gaming but the rest, Soccer, partying, social life in general, are things I don't really have my heart into but he does, but somehow we still have great chemistry and bonding."

I know there is a difference talking online vs. real life, but contributing to an online community can be a good start and a great way to build more social confidence little by little.  Also, you say you don't know anything about music or sports. Do you want to know more? If so, go ahead and explore music and sports so that you can broaden your conversational horizons. In addition, if someone talks about something you don't know anything about, you can ask questions which will help the flow of the conversation.   And after talking, you may find a brand new interest/hobby and a new friend!"

Also you could expand your horizons a bit, read some books, browse the  web for some local festivals and stuff. People also like all sorts of viral videos so log out of your youtube account and browse youtube for stuff popular in your area ( country ) so you know what they might be waching. I noticed that any kind of personalised search ( google, youtube...) got me out of touch with local trends and it really bugs me becouse that trending material on the web is a great topic to start a conversation. I almost forgot people like to talk about any kind of contest ( dancing, singing, other talent shows, sports ) so you could try and keep up with that, remember you don't  need to like it, there are other people out there who don't  like those shows too. Tty talking to them what is it that they don't  like about it. Feel free to talk about people  who appeared on tv shows, movies etc.( who you like and don't  like )"

So I feel what you are asking is ""How do I be entertaining if I am not a good speaker?""  Here's some options:   Do more stuff.  When I started to get better I took my first vacation, just flew to a foreign country and hopped in a rental car and drove around for two weeks.  Best time of my life, people were really interested in it, and I told stories from it for a year and felt very interesting. Learn to tell better stories.  Join Toastmasters or similar, and hopefully you can tell great stories about the things you currently do."

People with social anxiety are generally very introspective, thoughtful people and that makes for an interesting person. I find when I'm very anxious I become a terrible conversationalist and quite boring, but when I'm relaxed and confident, people find me engaging and likeable. I actually thought for years I was a crappy, boring person by nature (and i still struggle a lot with these thoughts now), but it's just the anxiety that makes me feel that way. I expect it's the same for you too, even if you don't see it that way yet."
