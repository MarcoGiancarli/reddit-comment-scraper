arresteddevelopment,3dmt0j,classlessjerk,7,Fri Jul 17 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"It's true though to some extent(and I don't mean that in an elitist way).  When I entered law school, it was a sobering experience. I went from being the ""smartest guy in the room""(or at least the guy in the room who always thinks he's the smartest) in grade school and college, to feeling like the dumbest guy in nearly every configuration of people I met in the halls.  The writer of the article was being sarcastic with his use of ""elite"", but when it comes to raw logical reasoning skills: law school campuses are overwhelming."
arresteddevelopment,3dmt0j,jordanFromJersey,8,Fri Jul 17 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"My experience in medical school was that even the ""smartest"" people weren't nearly as intelligent as they think they were, just much more disciplined. The elitism was revolting.  I was the ""smartest guy in the room"" in med school, residency, and beyond, but I'd be an idiot if I thought for a second I was in any way better than anyone else.

There's wordplay and running jokes that reward the viewer for paying attention but honestly it's hardly Infinite Jest.  I adore the show but the back slapping amongst it's fans is baffling considering how inclusive and broad the humour can be.   In no way am I bad mouthing the writing (which is sharp, witty and always driven by the characters) but it isn't a show in which the humour is above the head of an intended audience."
arresteddevelopment,3dmt0j,traceitalian,31,Fri Jul 17 18:06:03 2015 UTC,"Speaking for myself only, when I say that its a smart comedy Im speaking in comparison to 90% of the other comedies on tv. You certainly dont need a law degree to get the humour but it isnt just one liner after one liner.   There's wordplay and running jokes that reward the viewer for paying attention...   I really like the way you put that but I personally think that also makes it ""smarter"" than most other shows. Even in season 4 there are jokes that touch back to season 1."
arresteddevelopment,3dmt0j,HipHopHungry,9,Fri Jul 17 18:15:41 2015 UTC,I agree but I don't think the audience needs to smart in order to get the show. Like The Simpson's at its best AD is hysterically funny whilst remaining inclusive.
arresteddevelopment,3dmt0j,traceitalian,4,Fri Jul 17 18:19:28 2015 UTC,True. I think thats a fair comparison because theres different levels of humour in both shows. There are jokes that would just breeze over some peoples heads while others are more just slapstick
arresteddevelopment,3dmt0j,HipHopHungry,12,Fri Jul 17 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's not that the audience has to be 'intelligent', per se, but more observant, to really get all the jokes."
arresteddevelopment,3dmt0j,nitrous2401,8,Fri Jul 17 19:26:48 2015 UTC,"Most of the time when the humor is above the head of the audience, it's because the audience is missing some key information that they would only have by being familiar with a lot of showbiz lore (George Maharis, all of the Happy Days references, Andy Richtor's failed Quintouplets sitcom, etc), or by being familiar with the show's own inside jokes that are best revealed through multiple viewings (foreshadowing Buster losing his hand, everyone's ridiculous chicken dance, Gob's use of The Final Countdown for his horrible magic shows, pretty much everything that happens with Tobias, etc.)  I think as a show that rewards repeat viewings and people who are willing to do outside research to get maximum appreciation, it ends up being kind of a circle jerk.  It's not that you have to be smart to get all of the jokes, you have to be sufficiently invested, and of course fans of the show are going to be more willing to make that investment.  The mistake they make is in assuming they're smarter for having spent their time making an investment in getting maximum appreciation from this show rather than something else."

Today, the humor doesn't seem so smart and broad... but that is precisely because all the smart people in hollywood were watching arrested and you can see its influence across the entire TV universe.  In 2003, nothing like Arrested Development had ever been on television. I remember watching the pilot and being baffled. It was 10 years ahead of its time"
arresteddevelopment,3dmt0j,jigielnik,2,Fri Jul 17 20:02:39 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that you don't have to be a genius to watch it, but the difference between AD and something like The Big Bang Theory is that you've got to work a bit to enjoy AD.  I quite enjoy watching TBBT on afternoons when I'm just fed up of everything and I want to switch off.  It's guaranteed to make me laugh, and I won't need to put any effort in myself.  On the other hand, I need to sit down and purposefully watch an episode of AD - a huge amount of the humour comes when you pay attention, remember previous episodes, and catch a lot of the subtleties that they try to hide a bit.  You could enjoy it without that, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as funny."
arresteddevelopment,3dmt0j,MrJohz,2,Fri Jul 17 18:33:48 2015 UTC,"I agree, and it kind of speaks to what you hope to get out of your TV watching experience.  If you're watching TV to sort of shut off your brain or maybe you want something on in the background, something like TBBT is perfect.  The laugh track and delivery tell you exactly what you should be finding funny, and the plots aren't ever too complicated, so even if you didn't hear something or you got distracted, you can still follow what's going on and not feel like you've missed too much of the humor.  AD requires you to make an investment.  You have to be paying attention, and you also usually have to have some background knowledge to get the full effect of the jokes (like all of the stuff about Happy Days for example).  It's a show for people who take television seriously, not for people who watch television casually.    Notice that TBBT makes a lot of jokes about geek culture, and they take their commitment to geek culture seriously enough that they have teams of fact checkers and they bring on big names in geek culture as guest stars.  AD is based around show business culture, so most of their inside jokes require some knowledge of Hollywood lore rather than geek lore.  It stands to reason that a show made for people who love show business would reward people who take TV more seriously by giving them a show that has more depth rather than a show that's accessible with little investment."
arresteddevelopment,3dmt0j,MadDogTannen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"It's not Infinite Jest but you're severely overestimating the country's average intelligence. AD's humor goes over the heads of many, MANY people."

Part of the problem is that there are so many jokes crammed into every moment, it is hard to follow. Unless you're a robot, you have to watch the series over again from start to finish to grasp the general flow. Fans of the show tend to watch it in cycles, meaning they watch it in order, then go back and watch it all over again within a reasonable amount of time (they don't watch episodes randomly.)   Don't skip ""next time on..."" as been said.  My advice, watch it without distraction and in large chunks, a minimum of 2 episodes since they are short without commercials anyway.   There are literally charts of running jokes that span several episodes and seasons and it's easy to miss them. I'm on at least, my 5th cycle and still discover new jokes."

Like as in the characters being an embarrassment and ending up in cringeworthy situations? If that's what you mean by that, you might not be a fan, because that's a lot of the show. They're the worst of mankind, basically. Buuuuut, IMO, the show really hits its stride in the 2nd season after Danny Devito came on board.  A few of my faves:   Mac and Charlie Die Pt 1 & 2 Sweet Dee's Dating A Retarded Person The Nightman Cometh (major callback to the above episode) The Waitress Is Getting Married (first one I ever saw) The Gang Buys A Boat The D.E.N.N.I.S. System The Gang Goes To The Jersey Shore Chardee MacDennis: The Game Of Games Frank's Pretty Woman The Gang Solves The Gas Crisis   I love a lot of the episodes, but I'd say these are my top picks."
arresteddevelopment,3cpd56,Not_Andrew,9,Fri Jul 10 02:49:55 2015 UTC,The DENNIS System may be one of the best episodes they have ever done.
arresteddevelopment,3cpd56,monjoe,3,Fri Jul 10 08:18:44 2015 UTC,Charlie work and the Gang Desperately Tries to Win an Award are the two top contenders. The latter has subtleties similar to AD's jabs at FOX
arresteddevelopment,3cpd56,intangiblemango,5,Fri Jul 10 17:43:12 2015 UTC,"Both I think. I have a really hard time with Michael Scott's character on the Office for similar reasons (I did get through the Office, but I definitely had times where I have had to turn it off in the middle of an episode because it was too painful for me to handle. ""Stoooooop what are you doooooooinggggg!"") It sounds like It's Always Sunny is just not going to be my cup of tea, but I will pick one from your list and give it another chance just in case."
arresteddevelopment,3cpd56,dilettanteTunesmith,2,Fri Jul 10 02:55:00 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, I understand that, it probably wouldn't be your cup of tea then, that's okay. Maybe if you do try one, go for Frank's Pretty Woman? My girlfriend isn't an It's Always Sunny fan, but she loves that episode."
arresteddevelopment,3cpd56,MertArmagan,2,Fri Jul 10 03:03:53 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I feel that there's no ""cringe factor"" in the show because the characters in IASIP have no shame for their actions.  I suggest watching ""Sweet Dee's Dating a Retarded Person"" first. It's a prequel to ""The Nightman Cometh"" (the highest rated IASIP episode according to IMDB). Also, the episode really shows how demented the gang is, unlike the first season where they seemed to appear as ""average outcasts""."

It was about four years from when I saw the first episode until I became a fan. The awkwardness was just way too much. You can't enjoy the humor if your mind has to deal with the awkwardness.   But once you know how the story/episode is going to end, the awkwardness is pretty much gone, and you can really enjoy the show. AD is extremely clever, but I think Sunny is much funnier. I've probably seen AD 4 times through. I've seen my favorite seasons of Sunny almost 10 times or more  *Also, /u/dilettanteTunesmith's list is spot on.

Nothing is too offensive for the show, you're introduced to all the characters and their personas (of course except Frank, who actually makes the show even better by S2) and it exhibits the awkwardness and stupidity that is the staff of Paddy's Pub.

His attempts to manage his completely and utterly insane family of narcissists lead to much of the comedy. His son, George Michael falls into this trope much of the time as well. Michael is, however, also a deconstruction of the trope: despite the ""ordinary guy"" facade he puts on, his interactions with George Michael show him to be as uptight and completely intolerant of casualness as his family says. He is also repeatedly shown to actually being incredibly gullible in that he often trusts his family members far too much for people who has repeatedly fail to live up to even his lowest expectations."

arresteddevelopment,3bek4u,NotDeeReynolds,3,Mon Jun 29 09:39:47 2015 UTC,"My theory is that the writers were inspired by the two part episode ""Who Shot Mr. Burns"" from The Simpsons.  Just like the first episode of that 2-parter, S4 of AD showed that every member of the family had a motive to attack Lucille 2.  Much of it flowed from Mr. Burns stealing the oil found under Springfield Elementary, which resembles Lucille 2's political career threatening to cut the family off from the stimulus money that keeps them afloat in S4.  So first of all, I would guess that we will learn early in Season 5 that Lucille 2 is alive.  Then, there will be Bluth DNA found at the scene of the crime, bringing the old question of which Bluths are and are not related back to the forefront.  In The Simpsons, it was ultimately Maggie who shot Mr. Burns, but I don't think it will be Buster (the baby) who attacked Lucille 2.  I think its Michael, but as S4E01 shows, Gob forget-me-nowd him later that night, so he doesn't remember."

Some episodes went on way too long and without any laughs it's a chore to get through.

Before Michael was the straight man they could play off of, many characters don't work on their own. I hate the Maebe episode."
arresteddevelopment,3b9z6q,macgyverspaperclip,4,Sun Jun 28 04:56:20 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend and I spent the last week watching (in my case, re-watching) the first three seasons. She's fallen in love with the show and even I am still discovering hidden jokes.  We started the fourth season yesterday, and we are five episodes in and...we're still waiting on the funny. It's not a question of the new structure or narrative, it's just that there don't seem to be any laughs (yet). The call backs to episodes from previous seasons feel kind of forced, and all the celebrity, ''special appearance'' characters (Seth Rogen, the Workaholics crew) all seem shoe-horned and out of place.  We're taking a break from the fourth season to re-watch the first three again. My question is, does the fourth season get better? We haven't gotten to the Gob, Buster or George Michael episodes yet so there may still be hope, and the first five episodes could just be the more unfunny ones. But I got to say, if this were any other show I'd have given up by now.   So, do the jokes get funnier after the fifth episode?"
arresteddevelopment,3b9z6q,Nether_Ending,4,Sat Jun 27 08:37:43 2015 UTC,"Some episodes can be really tough to watch and since they're longer they seem to drag on a bit more but in my opinion the funniest episode came from season 4.  A New Start was the funniest episode I have ever watched. Keep giving it a chance, it takes time but its worth it."

arresteddevelopment,3b9z6q,Marshmellow1337,2,Sat Jun 27 17:01:22 2015 UTC,I agree about the forced btw I think they wanted to make the show more accessible and so Howard over explains in the narration so it feels like they are just explaining the jokes from the first 3 seasons making it miserable to watch. They do actually add layers and jokes on top of it I believe.

Clicked it, saw it was her and then she deleted straight away.  She just wanted to know what I clicked and then GTFO. It was like being dumped again only this time I didn't take a week off work to masturbate and watch Netflix."
