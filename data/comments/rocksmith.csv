I wanted something to replace my fender jazz bass I got from a pawn shop and figured I'd be ok spending some money, because I don't see myself stopping playing really, and he knows more about bass guitar than anyone I know, so I asked him to sell me one.  The one he sold me is being played by him in this video, its the same one in the youtube video I'm playing if you want to hear what a trash bass player makes a really good bass sound like vs arguably the best in the world on the bass he built.. lol.

rocksmith,3e3ua4,genericdeveloper,2,Tue Jul 21 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone has said good stuff.   Fretboard Logic, Fretboard Roadmaps, and the Guitar grimoire are really good resources. But, Justinguitar.com is the best, for what you're asking about.  The other three will give you a ton of Fretboard theory + music theory. But, they won't apply it directly to songs. And, that's fine. They are great all around resources. Really.   But, if you want something a little more song and style oriented Justinguitar is (mostly) free and offers a good pathway. He also covers much of the same material in the other three. So, that's a plus.   Also, I'd check out Truefire's Pop guitar and rock guitar courses. The pop guitar is highly underrated.  It has a wealth of tools that could apply to any level of guitarist. And, they have many rock guitar courses that are excellent. Also, House of blues, Fender, and Total guitar are good.   Honestly, there's so much good stuff out there, you are probably better off asking about the quality of something that appeals to you personally, as well as what people like."

It looks to me like he's up-picking the bends on b and then down-picking the e string, but I'm not sure sorry."
rocksmith,3e0nqq,RuinsOfTheFuture,2,Tue Jul 21 05:41:31 2015 UTC,I play these with my little finger fretting the high e string and my ring finger fretting the b string. My middle and index fingers are also on the b string for bend support (on the 17th and 16th frets). I use down-strokes when picking the b string and up-strokes when picking the e string.
rocksmith,3e0nqq,halsb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:51:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't played that song but my initial guess would be put your Index Finger on B string 18th fret, put middle finger on E 18th fret. Then when you get to the bending stage you strike the B string, push your index finger forward while keeping your middle in place and strike the E string right after the B string in one motion.   So it'll sound like 18th fret ringing out, Full bend completes, then 18th  fret on E string rings out."
rocksmith,3e0nqq,LordScoffington,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:05 2015 UTC,"it's about hitting the B-18, full step bend, then the E-18 all in that short window. you've got to fully release your bend every time so that the B-18 rings clearly before you start the next bend...  ...you may think it's cheating but try B-18h20 then hit E-18. you can barre the 18th fret with your index and use middle (or pinky if it's more comfortable) to hammer-on the 20. make sure your finger is curled enough when hammering on so that you don't mute the high E.  it's so fast through that section the game will probably pickup easier than if you actually have to bend the string. the notes are the same and if the section is fast enough, most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference."

rocksmith,3dwtkj,bikerwalla,2,Mon Jul 20 18:14:21 2015 UTC,Closer. You can move them up and down however you want based on what sound you're going for.  Sometimes I'll just pluck the string when I'm only supposed to be holding a sustain so that I can get it to trigger a slide.

rocksmith,3dwtkj,Trazac,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:10:38 2015 UTC,"Sustain has a LOT to do with your setup. Once I got my setup correctly, the sustain rocks out for days. There are many things that affect sustain. Look for things that steal the vibrational energy of the strings.  For example on a tune-o-matic bridge, pop off the bridge, pop out the posts, wrap them a couple times in plumbers tape, screw them back in. They will not wiggle anymore.  Do the same on the posts.  Make sure there is clearance from the back of the bridge, where it leads down to the tailpiece etc.  If it's a floyd, wrap the springs with electrical tape (not too tight). There are other approaches too. Check the nut for slots that are too wide. That will mess up sustain.  It's usually a lot less to do with pickup height than you think.    This is no where near a complete list of things to check, but it's something setup related likely."
rocksmith,3dwtkj,xCrypt1k,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:32:48 2015 UTC,"Would be negligent not to mention that that is a key purpose of vibrato.  Wiggling the string against the fretboard generates noise.  ""In contemporary music, finger vibrato is also routinely used by classical guitarists on longer notes, to create an impression of a longer sustain"" --WP"
rocksmith,3dwtkj,EsotericRogue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:43:22 2015 UTC,"...Also, usually feedback really helps sustain, but RS is not a good scenario.  It has noise cancellation which also cancels real notes, and I suspect feedback interferes with the software's interpretation of the signal.  So while in real life you can just hit a note and let it ring out for 10 minutes, that doesn't work in game so use extra vibrato."

Granted that it's a 225$ guitar and you might not be feeling quite THAT cool, but everyone I've asked who has played one puts it above the quality of an Epiphone LP Standard. Now it might not be quite as good a deal for you if you're in Australia as it is for us Americans, but it's a nice place to start.   More generally - I think you should stick with hardtail models. No tremolos. Hardtails are easier to tune and to to keep in tune, and easier to change tunings as well, which happens all the time when you're trying to learn songs.  Oh and I bought a ukulele for my 4 year-old and although she does like it, she spends an awful lot of her time asking for a real guitar instead. I think I like the ukelele more than she does. I'm trying to say that it might not pay off to get a short scale guitar. Even for a 5 year-old. I suggest that you make certain to get at least one full-size guitar with a hardtail.   Example: http://www.rondomusic.com/EG491LBL.html"
rocksmith,3dwn25,illinest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:45 2015 UTC,"http://www.rondomusic.com/EG483JDGR.HTML  A different direction. Modern looking, hardtail and a humbucker in the bridge. Rocksmith seems to detect notes better when you have a higher output pickup. This is probably a much better choice than the other example for just that reason.  Another one: http://www.rondomusic.com/gravityhumasbk.html Price is getting higher, but this one is a semi-hollow. It might be a good choice for unplugged playing. It also has the hardtail bridge and two humbuckers. Honestly this might be the perfect combination of features for a newbie guitar player just getting started with Rocksmith. Can't vouch for build quality though.  And here are the Agile AL-2000s, which do have a good reputation for build quality. http://www.rondomusic.com/al2000csbf.html Cherry Sunburst http://www.rondomusic.com/product6797.html Blue Flame  They apparently keep costs down by using shortcuts like a photographic flame maple top rather than real flame maple, but it doesn't affect the quality of the guitar. Of course you could go up to the next product line: http://www.rondomusic.com/product7056.html And this gets you nice cosmetic touches like the body binding, and you get slightly nicer Alnico V type humbuckers, but you're starting to get really close to the price range of other nice guitars by this point."
rocksmith,3dwn25,illinest,2,Mon Jul 20 14:25:24 2015 UTC,"My son (6, but pretty big for his age) has a 3/4 size acoustic that he uses for lessons, but he plays RS on my full-size electric. He's never complained about using the full-size."
rocksmith,3dwn25,dustin-dawind,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:12:24 2015 UTC,My son has an Ibanez 3/4 scale guitar. He will be 6 next month and he is very happy with it.
rocksmith,3dwn25,f3rn4nd0d,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:10:14 2015 UTC,"My daughter is 8 and has been playing for a little over a year.  She has a full size ""Les Paul"" style guitar.  The smaller body shape works very well for her and she plays it standing up.  It is a Jay Turser, which I find to be a good value for starting.  She also grabs a stool often and plays some of my Warwick basses with the game as well, and those are some pretty big and heavy machines. She manages to work the neck without issue, but the weight would likely stop her from standing with it."
rocksmith,3dwn25,SammyDaSlug,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"I think the general consensus is to not buy 'kid' size guitars. If you want them to get into guitar, buy them a nice normal sized guitar. With an electric, the size difference isn't all that big. They might have to reach a little, but in the end they'll have a guitar they can hold onto for a lifetime."
rocksmith,3dwn25,Trazac,2,Mon Jul 20 16:20:45 2015 UTC,"That certainly seems to be the consensus.... Looks like I'm getting them a pair of Epi Special II's then, it's what I use and about the best value/$$$ prospect available in Australia."

You will get wrecked on import and conversion, and won't be able to take advantage of their return policy - which is the big draw to going through them."
rocksmith,3dwn25,pda041376,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:44:05 2015 UTC,Get the mini strat or peewee les Paul (really any 3/4 size guitar). Tunings will feel odd on the scale of the neck but will work.
rocksmith,3dv8xj,CashewGuy,2,Sun Jul 19 20:21:59 2015 UTC,"Not that I've found. Best option for mac users sadly is to do any converting on an actual windows machine, or more realistically, a windows VM.    I'm happy to help with conversions if you need - just give me a pm with a folder for the tracks you want converted / dd etc."
rocksmith,3dv8xj,ZagatoZee,2,Sun Jul 19 22:36:03 2015 UTC,"I've been using a Wineskin wrapped version for months now and it is way more stable. Granted I mostly just do conversions to Mac. The file size is quite a bit larger and it will take 20-30 seconds to launch so be patient. Anyways, give it a shot. It's on my Mega HERE.  I hope that helps you and resolves the issues. Let me know if you have any issues with the download."
rocksmith,3dv8xj,gomer11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:30:13 2015 UTC,"Two additional questions concerning the Rocksmith Custom Toolkit from another Mac user: I'm new to Rocksmith and tried out the RCT today to convert some custom p.psarc CDLCs to m.psarc. So far this seems to work without problems (at least when it comes to use the end result files in Rocksmith – as to the user experiences when converting with RTC, OP is completely right, the program is lagging/crashing etc.)  As I am not familiar with how these CDLCs are ""programmed"": Is this conversion 100% identical with a ""native"" Mac CDLC or can it break arrangements or similar? I am wondering this because of the many ""PC only"" offers over at customforge.com - although converting seems an easy thing within seconds with this little program.  A second question: I use the fantastic RocksmithToTab exporter made by reddit user u/fholger. It ""only"" exports the tabs of officially bought DLCs though – is there any chance to also export the tabs to Guitar Pro format for Custom DLCs?  Thanks in advance for any info/help!"
rocksmith,3dv8xj,zivilars666,3,Sun Jul 19 23:29:34 2015 UTC,"As far as I remember, the difference between the PC and Mac psarcs is very minor, to the point that I really don't understand why they even made a distinction in the first place. In any case, it does not affect the arrangement itself. I think it was something silly like the file location of certain files within the archive differs between the two platforms.   As for RocksmithToTab, the program is oblivious to the fact whether a psarc is official or custom, so it works perfectly fine on both. The GUI is a bit limited, though, in that it only converts psarcs it finds in the dlc subfolder of Rocksmith. If you've stored your CDLC elsewhere or create a subfolder structure within the dlc folder, then the GUI won't pick them up. If I get around to preparing another version, I will have it search in subfolders, too. In the meantime, you can convert individual CDLCs by running them through the console version of the program. You'd basically have to run  ./RocksmithToTab /path/to/your/custom/CDLC.psarc  in a console. It doesn't even matter if the archive is for PC or Mac, either one will work."
rocksmith,3dv8xj,fholger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:57:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer. The custom DLCs are stored in my normal steam dlc folder, I ran RocksmithToTab twice with the correct location - both times it only converted the officially bought DLCs to GP5 and ignored the custom psarcs. Strange thing ... Will definitely have to try out again if you say it should work - thanks for the info!"
rocksmith,3dv8xj,zivilars666,2,Mon Jul 20 15:27:48 2015 UTC,"Well, that is strange. I know it works for me, but I'm on Windows right now. So there is a hypothetical chance that this might be broken in the Mac version, even though I can't quite imagine how I could have messed that up :)"
rocksmith,3dv8xj,fholger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:32 2015 UTC,"I just created a test folder filled with four custom DLCs and ran RocksmithToTab on this location. It is stuck on ""Processing songs.psarc"" and nothing happens. Official DLCs work fine. Could be that one of those four CDLCs are somehow corrupted, but judging by my previous efforts with other CDLCs with the same negative result, I don't think so. I'm using the GUI, would it make any difference to run a command directly in Mac terminal? (Don't know exactly how to do so)  If you have the time and chance to have a look on this problem on a Mac sometimes, you may check if you can reproduce this problem. In any case, your RocksmithToTab program is fantastic and even converting ""only"" my official Rocksmith song buys to tabs is a dream come true! Thanks!"
rocksmith,3dv8xj,zivilars666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:17:43 2015 UTC,"Creating a test folder like that does not quite work. The way that the GUI works is it expects to be given the path to the Rocksmith folder, in which is located the songs.psarc, which contains all the official songs shipped with the game. Then, there should be a subfolder dlc in which all of the RS1 songs are located as well as any official RS2014 DLC you bought, and perhaps any CDLCs you downloaded. I know it's a bit restricting to have it like that, but the GUI was basically meant to be just a quick and easy way to use the program for the most common scenario.  You can use the console version for anything not covered by the GUI. Open a console, go to the directory where RocksmithToTab is installed, and then as stated above the basic command is ./RocksmithToTab /path/to/some/cdlc.psarc"
rocksmith,3dv8xj,fholger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:59 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see - didn't think about songs.psarc. However, I just tried again the correct folder (/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Rocksmith2014) which contain my songs.psarc file and the dlc sub folder with my bought songs and custom DLCs. RocksmithToTab converts everything, but leaves out the two CDLCs. (Their file names end correctly with ""_m.psarc"".)  Will have some more tests with the terminal command – still have to figure out how to use that that correctly, even with your path description, but I'll surely find a way. Thanks for your help, really appreciated!    EDIT: Got it working with the terminal command! THANKS!"
rocksmith,3dv8xj,zivilars666,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"I just looked at the source code again, and actually it only picks up those psarcs in the dlc folder which end in ""_m.psarc"". This is the naming convention of the official DLC, and I believe I did that because usually you get both the PC (_p) and Mac (_m) versions for the official DLCs (for whatever reason), so if I just ignored the ending, it would process duplicates, which is not great. Obviously, this behaviour is not ideal, either, since it will miss any psarc which does not conform to this naming convention."
rocksmith,3dv8xj,fholger,0,Mon Jul 20 16:39:20 2015 UTC,"There's no difference.  For the most part I haven't had any problems running the conversions on Mac (just few that I couldn't convert to work, or the conversion failed entirely), but still the functionality is not anywhere near that of the Windows version. Which taken into account how little Mac users using the software there is, is not very shocking."

rocksmith,3dn7ip,petit_prince,7,Fri Jul 17 17:37:33 2015 UTC,"If Possum Kingdom is part of this pack then I would be very surprised if it wasn't a mixed pack. No offense to The Toadies , I like that song, but wasn't that their only real hit song?  It's gotta be a 90's Rock Hits pack."
rocksmith,3dn7ip,PepStreebek,4,Fri Jul 17 17:48:43 2015 UTC,I would go for that. 90's Rock hits could be awesome.

For the previously in game artist:   Under Pressure by David Bowie/Queen Sex On Fire by Kings of Leon The Royal We by SSPU Another QotSA song? I Sat by the Ocean maybe? Monarchy of Roses by RHCP? Rock the Casbah by The Clash (A stretch I know)   Other possibilities:   Sultans of Swing by Dire Straits (Sultans are sovereigns) Ruby by Kaiser Chiefs Dancing Queen by ABBA. Dat bass. Something from King Crimson, King Diamond, Royal Blood or Prince? King of the Hill theme song."

rocksmith,3dn7ip,sportsfan101990,3,Fri Jul 17 20:44:12 2015 UTC,I just saw Royal Blood on Wednesday and I thought it would be awesome to have them on RS. That said I doubt We'd ever get them officially since it would only be a bassist track. I doubt they'd release something that 2/3 of people won't be able to play. (Lead/rhythm)
rocksmith,3dn7ip,ZagatoZee,3,Fri Jul 17 22:41:35 2015 UTC,"The Royal Blood CDLC tracks that are out and have the ""bass part"" copied verbatim into the lead are still quite fun to play, if a little simple - but amazing rhythm training."
rocksmith,3dn7ip,Victorvonbass,2,Fri Jul 17 23:10:21 2015 UTC,"Idk I feel like its possible for them to release stuff with only bass on it for once.  There have been 7 songs that don't have bass released.  Given there are a ton of guitar songs that only have lead or rhythm, but with Royal Blood's growing popularity it is probably a possibility eventually."
rocksmith,3dn7ip,Uffda01,2,Fri Jul 17 22:59:43 2015 UTC,and 4 of the 5 artists are making their RS debut...  I'd guess the one hold over would be Kings of Leon...

rocksmith,3do70h,cungar1001,2,Fri Jul 17 21:42:58 2015 UTC,"I like to learn the transitions so I'm comfortable with them and add some tricks to my repertoire, but when I'm playing a song I enjoy I often ignore the correct bassline and the score and just play it the way I feel like it at the time.  Call Me the Breeze is such an awesome bassline and I find myself just getting into the groove and ignoring the note highway for a while.  Edit:  Full disclosure: I doubt anybody would accuse me of being an actual bass player, so take my opinion with a grain of salt."
rocksmith,3do70h,Subbota,2,Sat Jul 18 02:49:10 2015 UTC,"The transition are simply going up or down the scales and following the drum break when there's one for the rhythm.    To know if the bassist like to improvised on it, the better is to watch it live and compare it to the recorded version.   For call me the breeze you would clearly be better of learning/finding the scales that are used all the way to have a better understanding of the transition and how they are constructed."

rocksmith,3djinc,beliveyoume,18,Thu Jul 16 19:50:56 2015 UTC,"It's an emulation of your direct input so no.  The reason you notice it more is because 1) confirmation bias (read: you're not thinking about all the times you played the right note/chord), and 2) Dissonance - Your incorrect note/chord clashes with the track playing in the background."
rocksmith,3djinc,Meowkit,9,Thu Jul 16 20:05:42 2015 UTC,"[expanding] Thus, yes, everybody should naturally have a good ear for dissonance.  What is hard for those many people without ""perfect pitch"" is identifying a note without any context.  But having alot of context -- such as the rest of the track, and even the natural pattern of harmonic scales -- makes ""bad"" notes very easy to hear."
rocksmith,3djinc,EsotericRogue,2,Thu Jul 16 20:58:09 2015 UTC,"I want to add an anecdote. I'm not a particularly experienced player myself but I think my story is relevant. I had problems with ""Seventeen"". The easiest difficulty levels cut the main riff down to just a few notes. The final note in the riff always sounded bad to me. I checked my tuning, intonation, action, etc... I couldn't figure it out. Later I checked out the tab and I learned that the bad note was actually supposed to be a part of a chord. I don't blame the game or the designers for thinking I couldn't handle the riff at max level, but I'm thinking that there must not have been a good way to make that one note sound like the chord that was supposed to be there. It was close, but recognizably different."
rocksmith,3djinc,illinest,5,Thu Jul 16 23:49:00 2015 UTC,r I checked out the tab and I learned that the bad note was actually supposed to be a part of a chord.    This is pretty common in rocksmith.  Usually chords are first introduced as just the root note if the difficulty is low enough.

rocksmith,3dk1wx,urbsauri,3,Thu Jul 16 22:13:25 2015 UTC,"It's been said before but:    Remember to play the base note for a millisecond before starting the bend. Rocksmith wants to hear the note you're starting from. It's easy to jump into the bend (bend the string with your frethand before strumming) and RS won't accept that. You can overbend and RS will still accept it. It just wants to hear you go from note A to note B and if you overshoot it, it will still count. Do remember that it sounds bad, so don't do it if you can help it."
rocksmith,3dk1wx,jaysire,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:47:55 2015 UTC,"There is muscle memory to it, there is also three types of bends.  Play the bends/Vibrato lesson, until you feel you can do it, then give the minigame a go. try practising on all strings.  Some people struggle with bends, other people (long term Bassists) don't really."
rocksmith,3dk1wx,Thirteenfortyeight,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:16:57 2015 UTC,Play temple of bends in guitarcade. I helped me with the muscle memory as well as knowing what the bends are supposed to sound like when done properly.
rocksmith,3dk1wx,bigbw84,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:35:34 2015 UTC,One general tip on bends. Lets use G string 7th fret as an example. Play the 8th fret and then bend the 7th till you hit the same note you played at the 8th. Repeat this with the 9th and 10th frets (always bending at the 7th).   You can do this all over the neck. It will help you develop the muscle memory to bend precisecly without really thinking about it.  As for rocksmith don't be afraid to overbend a tad.
rocksmith,3dk1wx,brtd90,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:41 2015 UTC,"I was having a hell of an issue doing bends until I played Rocksmith 2012. It told me to use my middle finger to do the main bend, but then to use my index finger to reinforce the push.  Ever since using that technique I've had no issue hitting bends. I'm not quite sure I understand the three types of bends other people are posting though."

rocksmith,3dk1wx,ZagatoZee,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:40:01 2015 UTC,"I like to watch the fretboard strings a few times per song and see exactly how the bend goes.  Not all bends are created equal.  Some are half steps, some are full.  Some are prebends.  Some vibrato.  Bending takes practice for sure.  Stone by Alice in Chains is a great song to work on them."

rocksmith,3dhfko,dcnairb,4,Thu Jul 16 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but when you use CDLC you're losing investor/distributor faith. This detracts from the likelihood that further official songs will be made available, and increases the likelihood that Rocksmith will lose support.   Normally, I'll fight tooth and nail to have as little DRM and as much community modding as possible. Rocksmith bridges the gap from the games industry into the music industry, the RIAA, which is in solidarity with the MPAA on anti-piracy. If we want to keep playing with them, you got to play by their rules. :("
rocksmith,3dhfko,tiajuanat,2,Thu Jul 16 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"They know people are going to do it, and it hasn't stopped them from making their own official songs. Why would it make them quit? The community has struck a nice balance by removing CDLC when an official is released and the company has more or less stopped going after it.  But I'm also a proponent for free music in general so maybe it eases my conscience here"
rocksmith,3dhfko,dcnairb,2,Thu Jul 16 19:58:51 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile, I'm playing Beatles, Pink Floyd and Led Zeplin. If/when official tracks come out, I'll delete the CDLC versions.

rocksmith,3di0uw,onetowatch,12,Thu Jul 16 13:00:54 2015 UTC,"I recommend a hard tail guitar (no vibrato, no whammy bar, no Floyd rose). As a beginner, re tuning your guitar to play all the alternate timings tracks in rocksmith is a bugger with the vibrato on that guitar."
rocksmith,3di0uw,Tarlbot,3,Thu Jul 16 14:13:55 2015 UTC,"Basic gear: electric (bass)guitar, cable, computer with game.   Customs work on macs as well, but there are less to choose from. You can however convert pc rocksmith files to the Mac format using the tools on the customs website. They have good tutorials on how to install songs or fix issues. Keep in mind that you will need one bought track to make customs work. Most custom editors use cherub rock as that track, as it came with the pre-order package."
rocksmith,3di0uw,roeig,2,Thu Jul 16 13:17:32 2015 UTC,"Yamaha makes great guitars and they come with tremolos. I don't suggest having a tremolo, and instead get a guitar with a hard tail like /u/Tarlbot suggested. My suggestion is the Epiphone SG G-400. You don't say what your budget is, but the G-400 isn't much more expensive. (Just don't confuse the G-400 with the G-400 Pro, which is only slightly better but more than slightly more expensive.)  I don't suggest buying an amp just yet. I'm sure you want to, but getting a tiny amp, or a bad amp, just isn't as good of an experience. Spend your money later on a better amp. An Orange Micro Terror with a small cab costs like £200 and is a far better option.  Your computer is probably good enough to play Rocksmith with a good experience."
rocksmith,3di0uw,Trazac,2,Thu Jul 16 14:55:42 2015 UTC,"I literally just downloaded on my macbook, if you want to get customs songs follow this: http://customsforge.com/topic/901-how-to-use-custom-dlcs-in-rs2014/  This will allow you to play them. Although i have found not all the songs work for some reason and on a mac you can't fix them as a windows computer is needed.  Also keep in mind that as a beggineer it'll be difficult to play the custom songs and most of them don't have the dynamic difficulty settings and will be on the hardest difficulty and no way to change it. in this case Start with the songs they give you and they say in 60 days you'll be a great player.   P.S all i have is a standard tele squire (daphne blue with cream scratch plate) which is probably the best option for a beginner as it doesnt have any fancy settings or a whammy bar etc..."

I remember Dan playing Cult of Personality and saying he didn't get a chance to practice the chart, so he played it on like 70% leveled up. But the whole Primus Pack week was great. Hopefully they get the guy who played Tommy to play this week."

rocksmith,3dgv9i,cinderwild2323,7,Thu Jul 16 04:14:45 2015 UTC,"The first rocksmith had this feature and I wish they'd bring it back.  I would use it for every new song until I had the note order memorised then it'd be real easy to level up to full speed.  In 2014 edition I find myself constantly pausing the game on new songs so I can see what notes are on screen,  staying paused for a minute to learn them, then going back to the start of the section to play along."
rocksmith,3dgv9i,dan-456,3,Thu Jul 16 07:48:27 2015 UTC,Agreed that this would make a great addition.  I wish it existed.  It does not.
rocksmith,3dgv9i,davidonabus,3,Thu Jul 16 04:19:35 2015 UTC,"This was a feature in the first Rocksmith, and Bandfuse. I never used it, but the feature was actually pretty bad.   It's also kind of a bad idea because it doesn't allow you to learn tempo."
rocksmith,3dgv9i,Trazac,8,Thu Jul 16 04:42:12 2015 UTC,I just like it as a possibility for the FIRST time you are seeing a new difficulty. That way you're not spending the first try just going UH WHAT IS HAPPENING WHAT IS DIFFERENT OH GOD
rocksmith,3dgv9i,Wiggles69,5,Thu Jul 16 04:43:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, i can't learn tempo until i figure out what the notes are supposed to be.  Even 1% speed isn't ideal."
rocksmith,3dgv9i,Trazac,-1,Thu Jul 16 06:18:15 2015 UTC,You can slow down the music down to 1%. Playing it note by note won't give you any idea of what the beat is like.
rocksmith,3dgv9i,Tinkletyme,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:00:16 2015 UTC,"Slow it down to 1 speed. Also, you can pause it and some of the notes show then you can move on from there."
rocksmith,3dgv9i,ThisIsNotMyTrueForm,5,Thu Jul 16 04:21:08 2015 UTC,"But it's still a far cry from what's being suggested here. I'm sure you've played the lesson where this exact system was used, and it's way better than just slowing things down."
rocksmith,3dgv9i,clavalle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:39:12 2015 UTC,No way.  It is like learning to play while stopping to readjust for every note.  That is probably the worst habit for a musician to get in.
rocksmith,3dgv9i,ThisIsNotMyTrueForm,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"It's good that you can just glance at the tabs and remember it all at once, but some of us need to go through them slowly."
rocksmith,3dgv9i,clavalle,2,Thu Jul 16 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"Sure, slower, but not stop/start.  That's not music, it is typing on a fretboard.  Here's a little trick I have used:  write down transitions you're having trouble with (this works especially well with transitions between two or three chords), then, for one minute practice going between them as fast as you can.  That will get those things under your fingers without training yourself to stop while playing actual tunes.  It is much, much better to flub up and try to recover while remaining in time when you are playing a tune."

rocksmith,3df2yl,metrons,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:34:17 2015 UTC,oh there definitely is one for guitar. I believe it was the first custom inlay created
rocksmith,3df2yl,KinoTheMystic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:56:36 2015 UTC,"The guitar one is included with the software... though looking at the site more, I realized they already had a bass version as well (again, just learned about this the night before I posted). Though, they only have it for E standard tuning. This whole method becomes rather silly if you only do it for standard tuning, so I wanted to make sure I'd be able to set it up for whatever tuning the song used.  I also just did it as a straight text lines, which don't align quite the same lower on the fretboard. I really didn't care, I just slapped this together real quick to have the letters show. Close enough for me."
rocksmith,3df2yl,Memitim,2,Thu Jul 16 16:21:42 2015 UTC,"Oh shit, that's awesome! One of my biggest beefs has been how notes only show for chords. I'd love to get that PSD as well.

There's too much latency for HDMI, muchless internet   ESC key to skip all the stupid intros?   that would be nice too, but waiting for those intros isnt just waiting for intros, the whole game is loading behind that. so instead of getting the intros, you would be sitting at ""Loading...""

rocksmith,3dcnnq,Zooropa_Station,9,Thu Jul 16 02:46:48 2015 UTC,Standard 6th root minor barre chord. Play it like a power chord but also press the other 3 strings down with your index finger. There's some videos about how to do barre chords and there's also a lesson on it in the lessons section in the game. Chords 301 or something like that I think. If you're new it'll take time to get it down but it's a pretty important skill so stick with it!
rocksmith,3dcnnq,Dr_Turkey,14,Wed Jul 15 06:04:10 2015 UTC,"I got all excited for a second there, thinking I was going to see some ridiculous technical metal chord that is unplayable without a 7 string and 12 fingers.   The only reason a minor barre chord might not sound guitary is if you are out of tune. I would double check that."

rocksmith,3dcnnq,brtd90,3,Thu Jul 16 14:48:23 2015 UTC,There was a post a while back from a glitched CDLC that had you barring at something like the 5th fret and then fretting the 4h one.
rocksmith,3dcnnq,Ignore_User_Name,2,Wed Jul 15 14:58:19 2015 UTC,Oh that's easy. Barre with the pinky :P

rocksmith,3dcnnq,Wiggles69,4,Tue Jul 21 08:29:56 2015 UTC,"You are gonna struggle to get all the clear notes on barre chords at first, it's all a matter of finding the right position for all your fingers (including the thumb) and praciticing it slowly. First try to get all the strings to ring individually and then go from there. In my case, when I was learning to play this exact type of chord I specially struggled to make the G (orange) string ring, because it's right in the middle of your finger and it might be hard to get the flesh/bone to press it correctly."
rocksmith,3dcnnq,dso25,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:06:19 2015 UTC,What was your fix to the G string not ringing out?
rocksmith,3dcnnq,m3tric,2,Wed Jul 15 14:35:28 2015 UTC,"There's a sweet spot with barring the whole fret. You need to have all the top fret barred with your index finger, but if you do it too hard, it won't sound right.  (Also, I have stupidly soft skin and couldn't do well on barre chords until I developed a callus on the side of my index finger, so YMMV on that aspect.)"

rocksmith,3dcnnq,burgmurk,0,Wed Jul 15 07:19:36 2015 UTC,"I learned this watching a video of Andres Segovia, overlap your middle finger over the top of your index finger. This makes the bar a whole lot easier. If you have Hendrix sized hands, just do what he did and lay your thumb over the top to play the low E string. Before anyone even says this is ""wrong"" just remember it worked out for Hendrix quite well."

rocksmith,3daa38,koolmoynyan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:47:57 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yeah bass is easier with 4 strings. Usually I do the rhythm but it was a song from customs forge and they didn't have the rhythm for it so lead it was.

It works great for going from e standard then turning it on to switch to e flat or d standard with the turn of a knob. Obviously works the same wiay with drop tunings.

Slayer and other metal bands use tones with super high gain and distortion, and they do this so they barely have to pick the strings. Keep that in mind when you're tremolo-ing, alternate/economy picking, sweeping or just in general. You don't gotta grate the strings like they did something bad to you. This takes practice and a certain feel, so just like everything else with guitar, practice and time are the solution"

It is a great way to keep you focused on one song, and they don't let you skip by on your weaknesses. Plus, there are challengers at every level. It is amazing to watch the progress of some players as they move up through skill levels.   After spending an intense week on a song, you can sometimes muddle your way through a master mode play. That's how I got the achievement."

They started with more recent music and seemed to play their setlist backwards from the release dates.   They started new, and kept going further and further back into thier history as the show went on.       The stage setup even went back in time...  at the start of the show it was very futuristic and high tech looking.  There were some 'workers' who were dismantling the stage setup during the whole show,  switching from futuristic look, to a typical speaker/amp stack, and by the end of the show, the stage was nearly empty... with a single chair, with an amp and solo microphone.   It was just the 3, and that minimalist stage setup as they played their first big hit, ""Working Man"" as the last song of the night.  Brilliant!"

rocksmith,3d4rmy,KieranMck,3,Thu Jul 16 22:33:27 2015 UTC,"I'm very dissapointed I didn't get any scores in last week. I just couldn't get the time in I wanted and between the song weirdly cramping my hand up quickly and fighting note detection problems I got too frustrated..But seriously, something about that song just makes my wrist sore.   Hopefullly this week goes better. I think I may just have enough time to put aside this week. I always enjoy practicing rush since its always a nice challenge and usually a ton of fun once you get the hang of it."
rocksmith,3d4rmy,brtd90,2,Mon Jul 13 15:57:51 2015 UTC,"Which chart were you playing? Some of the chord changes on the lead chart where just to much for me, total finger twisters.  I think overall for some reason this track has issues with detection. I have 2 real-tone cables and one seemed to perform better than the other when it came to detection on this song."
rocksmith,3d4rmy,Zucc_has_Mittens,2,Mon Jul 13 16:07:48 2015 UTC,"Mostly lead. I did play the bass a bit though. I have no actual issues playing it. Like i can reach and switch pretty easily. I think I'm just playing too tight. Probably a combintation of being out of practice and getting frustrated cause me to press harder and tighten my grip (which rocksmith dislikes). Got some weird stuff that didn't make sense on bass though..  Either way, I find rhythm heavy tracks diffiult on rocksmith because of note detetion.  Also, can an individual song have note detection issues? From what I understand the game just looks for a certain note. The game has a tolerance band programmed for each note and if what you play is within that tolerance you get it right. Each song just is a giant list of input checks. It just defines the order and which variables to call out not the definition of said notes. At least this is how I assumed it'd be coded."
rocksmith,3d4rmy,brtd90,2,Mon Jul 13 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"I have no clue if there could be track specific note detection issues, but to me there definitely ""feels"" like there might be.   What was interesting to me was the difference in note detection between 2 different real-tone cables. Both were calibrated before playing and all switches and tone knobs were identical between calibrations. It was interesting to see the note detection improve depending on the cable being used.  I share the frustration in the rhythm section issues. I've found that I tend to now over fret barre chords seemingly to compensate for detection issues, but all that does is sharpen the individual notes and make my hand cramp. Not really advantageous to building solid technique."
rocksmith,3d4rmy,Zucc_has_Mittens,3,Mon Jul 13 16:52:44 2015 UTC,Yeah. I've mostly fixed my issues by perfecting my calibration and gain settings and such. At least it is greatly improved. But you just have to remember that the score itself isn't whats important. You know better than a game. Especially since there are sometimes 5 different notes being played and some of them being louder than others.  But I have the same issues with overcompensating. I also noticed I fret power chords more often these days. Rather than barre them.
rocksmith,3d4rmy,brtd90,4,Mon Jul 13 17:05:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I usually stay away from score attack because it takes the learning aspect away and replaces it with an actual ""game."" While it can be motivating at times, it can also REALLY demotivate me and frustrate me to the point were I don't want to touch the guitar.  I've found that supplementing the game with learning tunes outside the game really helps in keeping me motivated and progressing. That way I can focus more on music and not so much on trying to do exactly what the game thinks I should do for a particular song."
rocksmith,3d4rmy,Zucc_has_Mittens,3,Mon Jul 13 17:14:37 2015 UTC,I always see score attack as a verification you can actually play the song well. Learn-A-Song has always seemed to me as a starting point only and once you get to a 98%+ level it isn't really useful. I play really sloppy and with no rhythm on LAS with percentages while with score attack it really shows you are lacking.
rocksmith,3d4rmy,grasspuddle,3,Wed Jul 15 14:23:46 2015 UTC,"Playing outside the game helps a lot as well, though. More so than Score Attack in my opinion. I think you can sound pretty off in Score Attack and still register hits (think of it as button mashing but in this case is strum mashing).  Playing outside the game let's you focus more on the music itself and is a good way to learn how to let your ears do the work in assessing your playing."
rocksmith,3d4rmy,Zucc_has_Mittens,2,Wed Jul 15 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I have two cables as well, but I never thought to swap them out to see if one seemed to perform differently."
rocksmith,3d4rmy,FinsterFolly,2,Mon Jul 13 17:33:45 2015 UTC,"Give it a shot and see if you have the same observations.  There also seems to be a latency difference between the two cables. While about 90% the time I manage to hit a ""good"" note with cable A, cable B seems to register a ""perfect"" note much more often.  It's weird and I dunno how to begin to explain it."
rocksmith,3d4rmy,Zucc_has_Mittens,3,Mon Jul 13 18:21:33 2015 UTC,I got this solo in the bag. Now it's just the rest of the song I have to worry about

I recorded a third video of myself playing Guitar Hero drums for this song but, it didn't sync up to the Rocksmith version of the song. Weird  EDIT: Sorry for the freeware watermark that pops up. I've never really done any video editing before so, I'll look into other options if I continue doing these multi-path playthrough videos."

There's an entire process to getting stuff like this approved and submitted to the respective stores (although I think Steam is the easiest of the three). The timing is probably mostly dependent on the time it takes for the slowest platform to approve. Then they set a release date on it. So when they started the process and set the release date, they probably had no idea what was going to happen.  It's possible for them to plan around certain known dates, like Valentines, Fourth of July, St Patrick's day, etc. But responding to current events is probably a lot harder."

Audio levels. Depending on what editing software you are using, this can be a fairly simple, 10 second fix. See if there is an option to ""normalise the final audio mix"". This shouldn't be relied upon to always make the audio right, getting the levels correct at time of recording is still preferred, but it should help you fix an existing shot without needing to re-record or re-edit everything."
rocksmith,3d6f65,ZagatoZee,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:50:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for having something constructive to say. I don't know why I didn't think about compressing the audio. I don't know how to do it in Premiere, but I know exactly that I should have done it. I worked on the levels, but I'm still unfamiliar with a lot of the tricks I should know about editing audio and video."
rocksmith,3d6f65,wastedkila,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:31:20 2015 UTC,"Honesty it makes it hard to watch with the levels being so extreme between gameplay and on camera shots. Your volume is great during the gameplay. Your voice is clear, you annunciate, and make it simple for non musicians to understand. However your audio during your on camera scenes is extremely quiet like you were behind a sound proof room trying to record at a normal speaking volume. Whatever method you used for gameplay I highly suggest using when you're on screen. That, or adjust your levels to much higher in your post production.  Positive review though, just fix the levels."
rocksmith,3d6f65,ThisIsNotMyTrueForm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:16:07 2015 UTC,"I actually work really hard on the levels. I have two problems with my camera:   It's Garbage and puts it's second mic on the view finder, so it's facing away from me. I don't have have a mic made for shooting video.   I need a better camera, but I'm quickly realizing that I also just need a better microphone for shooting video. I've become somewhat okay at syncing video and audio. After shooting and editing this, I realize that sound is much more important.  I should also use some music to back the camera shot segments."
rocksmith,3d6f65,emosoresex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:38:38 2015 UTC,"I'd say drop the camera completely. It's unnecessary, and unless you fix the audio levels and the brightness it's nothing but waste of space.  Another thing is that the whole review is breaking down a lot.

Recognition in rocksmith can sometimes be painful but that's more me missing the correct pitch by a tiny bit, I also got the impression it's more forgiving if you pitch low than high, the tiniest bit sharp and you get a wrong note, fairly flat and it's still giving you a pass or not finishing the note registration until you get on pitch."

rocksmith,3d4kvt,snarkhunter,3,Mon Jul 13 16:59:59 2015 UTC,Do you redo the Rocksmith calibration when you change guitars? The calibration process tells the game what expected levels it should get from your playing. Different pickups can produce very different levels.
rocksmith,3d4kvt,ZagatoZee,2,Tue Jul 14 13:54:14 2015 UTC,Do you have an amp? Check if your guitar makes sound out of an amp. If no sound comes out of the amp it's time for you to buy a new battery for your pickups.
rocksmith,3d4kvt,LordScoffington,3,Mon Jul 13 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"If you're not getting sound, the battery for your pickups may have died."
rocksmith,3d4kvt,MahSoundStage,2,Mon Jul 13 14:22:27 2015 UTC,Works perfectly on an amp (Orange or Marshall)
rocksmith,3d4kvt,RoryZilla,2,Mon Jul 13 14:33:50 2015 UTC,I doubt it is the EMGs I have them in a Ibanez rg Iron and they work great with the game.
rocksmith,3d4kvt,RoryZilla,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:46:00 2015 UTC,What could it be then? My cable? The strat works fine though :/
rocksmith,3d4kvt,toymachinesh,4,Mon Jul 13 14:58:54 2015 UTC,Is there a kill switch on your guitar? On the selector switch are you using both pickups? Try using only the bridge or the neck pup.
