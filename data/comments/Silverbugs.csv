Much higher than that with this low silver price is a high premium. Silver dollars are closer to $18-20 apiece.

Silverbugs,3e1c51,Summunabitch,0,Tue Jul 21 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"If it was just Gold, you can say that, however it was not just gold... every commodity was trashed down.  Yes, A few big funds tried to make the best of it... but they can do that.... just the same as other funds can try and buy that much.  We may not like the direction, but those funds are still on the hook for the money.  There are plenty of smart people there, they could come in and buy all the gold they want at these prices... but they are not.  You may call it manipulation, but I call it the guys with a lot more money than you and I making their presence and opinion felt. They could be dead wrong.... or they could be right.  I can theoretically understand why.... Gold was at a critical support level and they saw a great opportunity to double down.   When something at the store is at stupid low prices, do you not buy as much as you can?  When we had the Sandy hook shootings, and base AR 15's that were $600 were now selling for $1,500 because of a potential ban, I sold all of my AR15's because it was stupid high prices.  Was the market manipulated? Depends on whom you ask...  But that is the commodities market.  In the long term, they cannot control the market.  Yes, in short term, they can manipulate the price, ie... a few hours.... and as we had seen, after they dumped it, the price quickly spiked up.  The price did not plummet $200 an oz."
Silverbugs,3e1c51,Summunabitch,3,Tue Jul 21 20:14:22 2015 UTC,"Yea, I do call it manipulation. You know that it is too,  you just can't choke out the words to say it.  Groceries are not financial instruments, and they are not (ostensibly) regulated by the SEC and CFTC.   In the long term, they are able to control the market but they usually do it with slightly smaller, less obvious actions. Mostly  it is done once or twice a week to a smaller extent. When they keep doing the egregiously huge violations like they did the other night, they risk too many people complaining about being swindled.  And yes, the price did perk up this time. It doesn't always. And we wait for the day when JPM, Citi, and a couple  others loose the ability to illegally swing the market.   At that point, I'll listen to your technical analysis as if it had some real meaning. But until then, the idea that the COMEX is a mechanism for price discovery is a total fraud, and your participation in it without objecting to the blatant violations of law helps to perpetuate  that  fraud."
Silverbugs,3e1c51,Summunabitch,-1,Tue Jul 21 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"I do enjoy your comments, until you start shouting BS like your last line, or as in another post, that it matters to my living, or if I admit that it is ""Fraud"" and ""manipulated"" that it would be bad for my business.   Why? Because it shows you have no freaking clue about what I do and you are presuming quite a lot. =)  Have some decent respect please.  So, let's talk manipulation, but before that, let's get something out of the way....  I in no way make any money (business wise) trading futures or commodities, or anything else.  In my business, we do not focus at all on the trading aspect, or do we actually do ourselves, outside for a few specific clients.  So... even if the commodities market would blow up tomorrow, it would have minimal if any impact on my business.  So... manipulation.  I think what you call manipulation I call a less liquid, smaller market, where a few big pockets can drive the price up or down.  It is a market where there is not 100% transparency, say compared to the liquid nature of say Apple, GE or GM stock that are traded on exchanges with a ton of volume.  I look at commodities market the same as the Bond market... a market where less people participate and the rules are not really clear for an amateur retail investor.  This is why they do not buy Cattle Futures. =)  This is where an active manager makes sense, someone who knows the game.  So investment wise, this is where many investment advisors will employ etfs and index funds for S&P 500, however they will use an active commodities trader for commodities, precious metals, etc, you will use an active Bond manager for picking fixed income bonds, you will pick a real estate expert to select your real estate holdings.  I accept that the game is less opaq and you have to be the inside player to make money.... and I am totally OK with that.  For my own clients, for commodities we use the fine folks at BlackRock and Nuveen, also were using Rogers (Jim Rogers) commodity funds for longer term fundamentals.    The updates I do here, are pretty much what I do for my own account, shorter term stuff (ie less than 1 year).  So far this year, my trading account is up over 100% which are primarily investments picked for their fundamentals, but the entry and exit points are based on technicals.... and it works.  Pretty much everything except 1 or 2 have not in the short term, but still a really good batting ratio.  Do I run this strategy for my clients? NO.... because it is a completely different focus.  I may turn this into a fund... but for my clients we focus on the longer term stuff, which can be widely different from short term.... for instance....  Long term, I am personally bullish on Russia, based on valuations and first hand accounts and dealings with companies there. (investment)  In the short term... I am shorting the hell out of russian ETF's. (trade).  Same security, but two completely different purposes.  With commodities... I am bullish on the silver coins I have... particularly the more collectible stuff, as well as I put money into it as another place to park cash that I would not essentially spend.  So here I am concerned with inflation protection and just a place that is less liquid... ie that savings account you do not think about.  For a trade and investment.... I feel commodities are going to be in another 10 to 20 year down cycle as we were between 1980 and 2000/2010.  Fundamentally the global slowdown and stronger dollar are going to be detrimental to commodities.... and many hedge funds and funds I talk to, feel the same way.  In about 5 to 10 years I will be more bullish on it particularly as the Gen Y go into their prime spending years and the massive debt issues will start to pop up.... but that is a 10 year issue.  In the short term, I see very few catalysts for Silver and Gold to get back to $30 and $1800, and why my money is where my mouth is. =)"

I have no vested interest in trading or which way the markets go up in my day to day business.   So... how is my livelyhood dependent on as you say keeping people stupid that the markets are faire?  In fact, investment advisory is only 1/3 of our business. Furthermore, put your reading comprehension glasses on, as an investment advisor, because I am not paid ANY commissions.... I make the same amount of money whether I tell someone to stock up on precious metals in their vault, within their IRA, keep the money under their mattress, CD's, bonds, stocks, or even sitting in their money market account.  In reality, you have either no idea what I do, or no interest in knowing that what I do, IS NOT what you think or wish that I have done.  The Disclaimer is there because as a fiduciary, my responsibility to my clients is higher than anything else.  That is to just make it clear.... especially since I am not getting paid for any of this, but sharing this as Karma.  Again, I do not have to do any of this, and I would continue doing it in other places and just not share it with this community.   Lastly, let's be honest, is there anything wrong with people making money?  So what if it is listed on a website or a blog?  If it adds value, is that so bad?  Am I asking you for your money?  There are things I can do for this community where I can make money as well, where I would pay for the advertising here.  The reality is... most people are voting these up, but somehow I ticked you off.  I can easily publish these on many other news sites that would PAY ME to do it... but I am posting it here because I do believe in precious metals and want to educate people about it."

That being said - grading prices are also based on value of the coin that you declare. If you insure for over $300 per coin, you bump up a tier, going from $18 to $32 per coin!"

But why would you want to sell the coppers from the set?  In my opinion, I think they look great with both sets, and it might look empty without them.  Would you leave the copper spots blank, or get a second silver set to put in those blank spots?  Also, if you do want to sell your copper set, send me a PM, because I have a second set of just silver without the display case, and wouldnt mind having the second set of coppers to go with them.

Silverbugs,3e01jt,shudder317,5,Mon Jul 20 22:28:21 2015 UTC,"Some of the many things that influence PM prices:   The value of the currency it is priced in. For example the price of gold went up the last decade as the dollar lost value. The state of the economy the currency is based on. As the economy gets better the currency gains strength and the PM looses value. State of the global economy. When things get scary people buy and hold PMs.  The physical supply of the PM. As the price goes up many mines become profitable resulting in more metals coming into the market. This also has the potential to lower the price if too much comes onto the market. The demand for PMs. In the last decade Asia has had a middle class appear out of the ether. These nouveau middle class have pent up demand and bought like crazy, not to mention the cultural traditions to store wealth in gold. 15% of the world gold reserves are worn as jewelry in Asia. Manipulation. Its not a crazy tin foil hat conspiracy theory, its a fact that PM prices are manipulated by banks and hedge funds.  There really is no ratio that makes sense because the pros/cons of each PM will always be different at different point in history. It's a lot like Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, you can either know an electrons position or velocity but never know both at the same time. PM prices and ratios are the same, people like to pretend they know or a certain ratio makes sense, but its not that easy."
Silverbugs,3e01jt,Chilton1776,4,Tue Jul 21 01:25:16 2015 UTC,"If those numbers were so consistent for so long, why can't they get back to those levels and stay there for another 20 years or whatever?    The short answer is that anything can happen, and your argument ties in with Bernanke's comment that gold is simply a ""barbarous relic,"" or Zweig's article in the WSJ comparing gold to pet rocks a couple of days back.  At the end of the day gold is worth what people think it's worth, and if the world collectively decides that gold is worth $200 an ounce then that's what it'll sell for.   Is it all about supply? Are we as a planet really running out? I kind of doubt it.   That's a more interesting question.  I think it's reasonable to assert that prices in markets trend to the marginal cost of production over time.  The gold market produces a fungible product - different manufacturers do different things to differentiate their products, but for the most part an ounce of gold in an ounce of gold, whether that's a PAMP bar with their scanning tech, or 22k gold coins, or whatever.  Different, but fungible.  So with no way to differentiate their products, miners, producers, and retailers are all stuck in that position where they can't develop a moat, so we're looking at commodity producers.  And in commodity markets, prices drive to the point where businesses are making the minimum profit possible.  That's the way of markets.  So you can look fifteen years back and say ""there's no reason we can't see those same prices now,"" but in actuality the cost to produce gold is something like $1,100 per ounce with a standard deviation of $100.  If the price goes down from here then mines will go bankrupt or shutter their doors, and production won't go back up until demand is such that it can support a price that's higher than the cost of production + some risk premium for the producers.  That's just the way markets work.  Your long-term bottom in the price is around the cost of production, which is where we are now.  Which is why I'm buying now even though I think we'll see lower prices in the short term.  For prices to go lower and stay lower indefinitely, we would need to see:   A permanent reduction in demand.  Gold has been in demand for millennia, and with India and China developing middle classes with discretionary income I see demand increasing rather than decreasing. A reduction in cost of mining and refining.  Really low oil prices, new mining techniques, energy technological advances, or Elon Musk starting to mine asteroids are the sorts of things that would cause this.  But you can't predict stuff like that - I'm betting they won't happen in my lifetime in a way that totally overthrows the market.   I don't think the odds here are all that high.  (It's late.  I hope this was as understandable as I was hoping...)"
Silverbugs,3e01jt,retire-early,3,Tue Jul 21 05:24:53 2015 UTC,"Another big factor is the cost of bringing supply out of the ground. Mining is pretty energy intensive, if you look back at the 90's/early 2000's oil was sitting around $20/bbl while gold was around $400. For gold to return to those levels for any amount of time, at a minimum the price of oil would have to significantly decline as well."

I sold everything I had in 2011 at around $40-$45 an ounce and started buying again around 2013. I try to keep about 10% or so of my total savings/retirement in physical silver. Been going good so far and I like that it keeps dropping. I plan to hold until the next $40-50 spot price or until retirement.

Silverbugs,3e3g3v,ChopperIndacar,2,Tue Jul 21 18:24:38 2015 UTC,"You make money by CAUSING a dip in spot. One can accumulate short contracts for way more gold than exists. The trick is to OFFER to sell all those thousands of contracts at a time and place (say Singapore in the middle of the night) when there are very few buyers. So the few buyers that are there buy up what contracts they have money for, and once that tiny bid wall has been satiated, there are no more buyers. That lack of buyers causes the price to fall quickly and substantially.  This price fall causes others holding the long side of these contracts to panic, as they see the value of their contracts falling, and use automated systems to sell their long side at trigger points.  The entity that causes the price fall in the first place, can then stand there and buy up the panic sold long sides at a profit, and then withdraw their offer to sell 25,000 shorts, having only sold a small portion of them to accomplish the long side bloodbath."

Silverbugs,3dzf98,renegadellama,33,Mon Jul 20 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"I'm worried gold will flash crash below $1,000. Is it time to panic sell?   OK, take ten deep breaths and keep reading...  Have you done that?  Good.  Now, answer a question for me: what's your time horizon.  Are you buying gold because you want to sell it for a gain in 6 months or 2 years, or are you buying and planning on holding it indefinitely (or let's say > 10 years)?  If the former, then wait for a bounce, sell, use the loss as a write-off on your taxes, and go on.  If the latter, then keep reading.  Gold should be viewed as a currency, not as a commodity you buy.  If you don't believe this, note that in 1932 an ounce of gold was worth $20.67, and it's now selling for more than 50 times that.  That's not because gold has increased in value - it's because the dollar has lost ~ 96% of its value over that time period.    Don't believe me?  Google it.  Or price the cost of an SS Camaro in 1968 with its current version and calculate how much the buying power of a dollar has changed over the last 47 years.  Or whatever - for the most part you'll see that the buying power of a given quantity of gold has stayed relatively constant where the buying power of the dollar has decreased.  Feel better yet?  A little?  OK, how's this.  Look at how the value of the Euro has changed versus the dollar in the last few years - it went from something like $1.40 per Euro to $1.04, which is a 25% decrease in value in a couple of years.  Currencies (including gold) fluctuate - it's in their nature.  But if you look back over time you'll see that there have been something like 160 fiat currencies and all of them have failed.  All of them.  You know what hasn't?  Gold and silver.  Is that still relevant in the age of computers, and the internet, and all-powerful and all-knowing central bankers who can change the rules of finance on a whim for The Benefit of All?  You'll need to decide, but lots of us think gold/silver is a decent hedge.  Now, gold has been dropping a lot recently, and it will probably drop more.  Here are some points you can Google to understand some of the pro-gold arguments more:   The price of gold is set by paper contracts, not the actual sale of metal. These contracts greatly outnumber the amount of gold for sale.  Not long ago India's central bank came to the conclusion that the paper:gold ratio is somewhere around 100:1.  That's not a misprint - one hundred to one. Some folks equate this to a fractional reserve system - borrow someone's gold (like that owned by central banks) and resell it 10-20 times, creating a nearly infinite supply of gold derivatives.  Google this, and try to understand it. Now, this allows big players to buy/sell in huge chunks to manipulate the market.  And there are lots of folks who think that the market is regularly manipulated.  For instance, last night ~ 57 tons of gold were sold in minutes, at the least busy time of the market when liquidity was at its lowest.  This drove the price down by ~ $40 per ounce.  Another $550 million of gold was dumped after the close today as well, driving it down to under $1,100 an ounce.  People see this and call it manipulation.  Is it? Well, think about it.  If you needed to close out your gold position and you were selling enough to move the market, would you do it all at once, or slowly, taking at least a day or two to not affect the price?  Would you sell it when there were no buyers, or when there were lots of buyers?  Essentially last night's seller got the worst price possible for the $2.7 billion in gold he sold, and since someone capable of making a market order > $2 billion in size is expected to be literate in these things, we need to assume that his goal was something other than getting the best price. So, someone wants the gold price to go down.  And he/they are making it go down, because it's a small market, there's lots of ""free"" money out there, and all they need to do is sell paper claims to drive the price.  They've done this successfully, we can assume they're making money (if money is their goal), and they will continue to do this until they can no longer do it successfully. So the price will continue to go down, until it doesn't.  Nobody knows what happens then.  There will be lots of folks who bought paper claims on 100oz or 400oz bars of gold, and there won't be enough gold to fill those claims at the paper price, and they'll get a ""sorry, here's the cash our contract allows us to pay you with"" response.     And that's the situation.  The gold price goes down, demand goes up, and the price goes down further.  The effect you see is limited supply (not just Silver Eagles - look at the supply of 50oz and 100oz bars from your favorite provider and you'll see prices are up and less are available.)  My favorite product are the 1oz PAMP coins - last week they were selling at my favored vendor for a $21.99 premium; today they're selling at a $27.99 premium.  That's a 27% premium increase in one business day (plus they no longer are guaranteed to come in the cool 25 bar holder they always came with before.  Maybe they can make new bars and ship them, but holders are in short supply?)  The price will go down.  But that doesn't mean you can buy at the low price.  I'd say buy on the way down if and only if you have the guts to hold on if the price of gold drops another fifty percent.  It might.  And if you're going to cry, say you can't take it, and bail on your losing position then you have no business buying gold now (or being any kind of value investor for that matter.)  Stuff is cheap when it's out of favor, and it takes guts to commit and be willing to lose money until the market turns around.  And note that there's always a chance we're all wrong, and we'll lose 90% on precious metals.  That's the risk of investing.  Which is why few are saying go all-in on this stuff.  Rather, make it a percentage of your holdings.  Edited because I missed a point.  This stuff actually costs money to produce, and the general thinking is that on average miners can produce an ounce of gold for somewhere between $1,000 and $1,200 per ounce.  So we're at the point where miners are struggling, and once they fail (or decide to pile up their production rather than selling it at spot) there won't be more supply entering the market, which means existing stocks will be sold until there is no more, and it's at that point where there will be a significant split between the paper price and the physical price.  It may take until that point before this whole gold-pricing scheme unravels.  But that also means that if you buy now, you're buying for about the cost of production, which should be the bottom price in a rational market.  It's reasonable to assume that gold you purchase now won't be worth less in the future assuming a fair and rational market.  That's not to say the manipulators can't keep this up for long time, and that's not to say that gold will do better than stocks, or even bonds that are selling for a negative real yield.  Shit's crazy out there, yo."

There you will see that gold and silver have a tendency to stay low for multi decade periods, then spike up and settle back down. Buying the metals now, as they break down through one support line after another for years is a dubious strategy. Silver just punctured another support level around $15. What if I told you the reason the price is going down isn't because of some conspiracy manipulation, its because everyone knows PMs are a poor investment? I support the idea behind holding physical PMs, but I'm waiting for some evidence of a bottom before buying in. Looking at the 34 year chart, when would have been a good time to buy? Any time before 1980, or between 1990 and 2005. Buying now would be like buying in at 1983, when the price is heading down off a peak, with a long, profitless flat period ahead of you."

In regards to APMEX:   APMEX ""burnished"" ATBs are the US Mint's uncirculated ATBs (P-mint mark) APMEX ""uncirculated"" ATBs are the US Mint's bullion ATBs (no mint mark)   I think the confusion with dealers and buyers is the term ""uncirculated"".  The Mint uses that term as a method of manufacturing (special blanks and finish is used) while dealers/buyers tend to conflate that term with condition grades like ""BU"" so they end up using  ""burnished"" to differentiate.

Silverbugs,3dyt3v,Donkeyslapper84,4,Mon Jul 20 17:13:16 2015 UTC,That is a pretty good deal. I've been averaging $18-$20 per silver dollar. It's almost like you got the silver quarters for free in that deal. Really nice find.
Silverbugs,3dyt3v,spockdad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:10:27 2015 UTC,I average the same. Was this an lcs or desperate seller OP?
Silverbugs,3dyt3v,spanishfry,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:22:39 2015 UTC,LCS. They don't do well on their pricing for bullion but they sell their junk for good prices to most and great prices to a few. It's definitely not the shop you'd want to sell anything to though. They don't offer much to folks for their coins but if I need to sell I'm gonna hit up /r/Pmsforsale
Silverbugs,3dyt3v,silverscale,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:32 2015 UTC,Circulated Silver State Quarters?  once they got into circulation how would you know they were silver to pull them out?
Silverbugs,3dyt3v,TacoNinjaSkills,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:07 2015 UTC,"Well, they might not have hit actual circulation. I say circulated due to the scratches and fingerprints all over them. When they were removed from their silver proof sets, they were not properly handled and very well might have hit circulation.  As far as how to spot them in circulation, they would have stood out to me instantly. They still have a mirror finish on them and when you look at the edge of the coin, it's one solid silver color. Regular clad quarters have a copper and silver color on the edge.  Also, the mint mark would have been another confirmation on them being 90% silver."

The rest of the world has to work on the normal economics of supply and demand.  Right now, replacement cost has skyrocketed.  Once retailers start getting low and replacing their current stock, they're either going to be on a lonnnnnngggg delay or they're going to be priced very high (and likely both)."

Silverbugs,3dz64j,ribnag,3,Tue Jul 21 10:49:06 2015 UTC,"You're asking about a different problem, I think.    Hedging doesn't matter in this situation.  It's purely a supply and demand problem.    To answer your question though, some smaller guys hedge.  But hedging costs money too; e'rybody's gotta get theirs.  So for a smaller guy, you're trying to balance between the actual cost of the hedge and the potential cost of a spot drop.  Sometimes it's difficult to justify as a small guy, but it's all about your level of comfort, cash flow ability, and staying awake 24 hours a day, haha!"
Silverbugs,3dz64j,ProvidentJoeMerrick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:31:09 2015 UTC,It is partially because of the mint recently suspending sales.  Once that news swept through the silver community there was a noticeable increase in the premium of silver eagles.
Silverbugs,3dz64j,TX_Man_,2,Mon Jul 20 22:24:57 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like the best bet currently is APMEX on eBay.  You can get roll for $379.  If you pay with a 1.5%-back credit card, that would mean you'd effectively pay $373, or $18.67 each."
Silverbugs,3dz64j,Ag47baby,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"Right now, it looks like the best you can do is around $380 for a tube of ASEs on eBay (APMEX, MCM).  There hasn't been any big deals recently for them.  I'm guessing this is because there was a temporary sell-out from the Mint earlier this month which caused some extra demand so prices didn't come down that much when spot dropped.  The Mint will begin selling ASEs again on July 27th so you may see some deals shortly after as demand eases but you also don't know what spot will be then either."

Silverbugs,3dynk0,coldcatkid,5,Mon Jul 20 16:34:45 2015 UTC,It's as good a hunch as any. Us peons don't really get to know what's up. Only thing I know is it feels like pms are dropping and have a ways to go as the dollar keeps stengthening. Who knows how low it will go. I think it's time to go into dca mode and not ohhhhhhh buy the dip mode. That's just my hunch.
Silverbugs,3dynk0,FReZSTeR,3,Mon Jul 20 17:07:40 2015 UTC,I am Canadian and our dollar is being smashed right now by the USD strength and our Central bank lowering interest rates so the price of PM's hasn't changed much for us.   If I was an American or had a bunch of American dollars I would be buying right now.  I should have bought some USD 3 years ago when we were at par.
Silverbugs,3dynk0,FReZSTeR,3,Mon Jul 20 17:14:46 2015 UTC,Hindsight is 20/20. I'm also in Cad. But pms have dropped a lot faster than our dollar.
Silverbugs,3dynk0,Chilton1776,2,Mon Jul 20 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of reasons. PMs are often a means to preserve purchasing power if you think your currency is going to loose value and you do not want to trade for another currency.   $10,000 worth of gold would fit in your pocket, Maybe $300 worth of silver would fit in the same pocket. Gold is compact thats its biggest advantage. Other metals like Platinum are more rare, in fact platinum is something like 20 times more rare but the demand is not very strong and drops when the economy slows because its main use is industrial in chemical plants and making catalytic converters. Over the last few years palladium has replaced a lot of the demand for platinum, and its usually less than 1/2 its price.   Gold in general is just a ""comfort food"" kind of thing. People buy it because they always have, it has industrial demand, investment demand and personal demand when one goes up the others go down. This helps keep a steady demand. The decoupling from the silver ratio in the last few years is interesting, but its not that far off from the historical average (last 100 years) of 55 ounces of silver to 1 ounce of gold."

They basically have one line of bullion silver.  They obviously can't predict massive swings in demand.  There's no reason to mint 42 million ASE's by July.  They're on a schedule of production that slightly exceeds demand (during most of the year) and when there are spikes like last week, they run out temporarily because they don't have blanks.  They're not in charge of their own supply chain entirely.  They get their blanks from a few different sources and they must adhere to the absolute strictest standards in the world; down to the crystalline structure of the silver.  There are plenty of silver eagles to be had; just not necessarily at the price that everyone wants them to be.  But they're here and they're live and I'd say that they are minting to demand; even if it means that they have to catch up."

I do it for now because I don't use Paypal and I like Provident's selection, prices and service.  Free shipping is nice too but readily available if you order in any type of quantity from most vendors.

Silverbugs,3dws2o,FlyingBlueDream,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:24:04 2015 UTC,"Hello Ajsarch,  my plan should work well for short, mid, and long term.  Don't abandon your goal for 800 oz by the end of the year if you can swing it.  Buy the lower mintages and rare coins at good deals as the price goes down, when you feel its about at bottom then buy your weight but don't pay high premiums,  When I buy weight I always buy mix dated bags of 90% half dollars(walking liberty's and franklins) or other older 90%ers.  That way you can go through and find some real keepers you can sell at premiums, 90% are very liquid and when prices get low they sell out fast and then demand a even higher premium.  I stay away from mass produced Bars and Generic plain things.  I would rather pay $1.99 over spot for a bag of 90% than 79 cents over spot for a Bar.  When buying limited I try to stick mainly to government issued coins, I do get an occasional privateer or silver shield if it catches my eye, but I'm not betting alot on those.  When buying weight If you don't have time to sort through 90%'s for a quick flip then buy older Engelhard and rare bars from your LCS when they have a good deal, that will take some research on your end to know what bars to keep an eye out for.  With this method I have an average buy price of about $5 per ounce, been doing this for 1 year. I started with $1,500 initially so I can only imagine if I would have had 10k or 100k to play with. The cool thing about this too is that its made me a collector and I enjoy it.

Still not as bad as Gainesville though - but anything under 9oz is $4.95 and they have rounds at 15.50 and bars at 15.70 atm.  At MPM you really gotta work those tiered shipping rates. Add some $2.99 washington quarters as fillers to max out your value up to the next shipping rate tier increase. Or just add 40 washington's + shipping and be at 12.7x shipped and then add another $70 worth of shiny to get up to $199 and stay at that same tier :)

Silverbugs,3dw9qs,FitStack,-2,Mon Jul 20 06:44:57 2015 UTC,"The thing about this latest smackdown and future ones to come is gold/silver miners are operating at a loss right now. The cost to produce an ounce of gold, for example, is around $1200. So miners have been operating at a loss for the last year or so. If the price of gold continues to go down due to a strong dollar and price manipulation, many gold and silver miners will inevitably go out of business. At some point, due to lack of new gold/silver supply, price would have to go up assuming demand is at its constant level or rises."

Silverbugs,3dw78e,JarretGax,4,Mon Jul 20 02:35:38 2015 UTC,I passed my exam I was studying for! Actuarial exam. I tried to take it in July rather than November because our career fair is in September. Most people prep 4-6 months and I only took 5.5 weeks. I was underprepared but got luck or something. Somehow I passed but I don't care. Great relief and a lot less stress. Time to enjoy summer now instead of study.   Possibly thinking of trying to get in better shape.

Ordered a freshly rebuilt one, put it all back together, and found a dead valve in it. So, I've been driving around all week on 3 cylinders waiting for the replacement to show up from the folks who sold it to me.   When I took the head off, it was very clearly a defective part - one of the freshly replaced valve seats had dropped out of the head and was keeping the valve from sealing.   New head finally showed up Friday, and I'm getting it back together today. Super excited to have all 4 cylinders working again. This little car didn't have any power to spare to begin with.   More than a little pissed at the folks who sold it to me, though - they were good about sending me a replacement, no questions asked, but damn - it's been an extra $30 worth of parts and a full day's work to redo."

Contrary to what the other poster said, there is no easy way to differentiate between 80% and 50% dimes. They weigh the exact same. In 1968, which was split by 50% and CuNi coins, you can tell those apart by weight. However, the 1967s are not differentiable without more sophisticated analysis.   Also, the portraits switched for 1965, so all of them should be 2nd portrait Elizabeth II.   Because of this inability to distinguish the two, 1967s are typically traded as 65% silver.

Silverbugs,3drpgd,impreprex,4,Sat Jul 18 20:30:35 2015 UTC,"So, as I was about to leave the casino after losing some money (all my money), I reached into my pocket and grabbed my change because I was flat broke at this point (all I had was change).  I noticed this dime looked strange, so I immediately dropped it onto a marble table and listened for the silver sound. It was dim where I was, so I couldn't see it too well (that's why I did the drop test - and only from a few inches above).  Interesting find. I think I may have gotten that dime from a Wawa in Jersey on the way to Pennsylvania.  It appears to be in decent condition and I can feel the reeded edge nicely - if that matters."

Silverbugs,3drqwh,MasticateMyMuffin,6,Sat Jul 18 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"You have very limited coverage for certain items in case of a loss & that is why they have what is called an ""inland marine"" policy or ""rider"" which is attached to a home policy. Certain items cameras/furs/golf equipment/musical instruments/silver/guns/fine arts/stamps/jewelry all have limits as to what a carrier will pay out in the case of say a theft or fire if not scheduled (I get you’re asking about fire specifically).  That is not a complete list as some carriers you can schedule mountain bikes for example. Hell, you can schedule a bunch of crazy stuff & I’ve heard it all.***by scheduling it expands the scope of what a carrier will pay out on a loss & takes those limits out of the equation. Also takes out the deductible. Without scheduling it usually has a finite limit (1k-2500 etc) and also has to show some signs of break-in. By scheduling an item those limits go out the window. Yep, you’re paying for that coverage, but the carrier will pay out total value based on the amount of coverage you get & scheduling the items you have much better coverage. A good example (not a coin) is your significant other has stone fall out of her ring. Scheduled & the stone is replaced like/kind & quality & if carrier cannot locate suitable replacement, they pay out the insured value of the ring. Not scheduled & deductible now comes into play & there’s a limit.  On average you can expect to pay $15-$20 per 1k in scheduled silver per year (I just looked at 16 of my carriers & that was the range) or you can do what is called blanket coverage which is a little more expensive, but where you just say I need to insure 3k/4k/5k/10k of silver. You don’t need to schedule each piece or roll individually in that case, just some proof at time of loss. Totally get a lot of SilverBugs here keep their silver at the bottom of some lake & concerned about anyone knowing what they have. Totally not judging.  But truth be told as an insurance broker I have a bunch of high net worth clients & I don’t care what they have. I just want them insured correctly in case of a loss & at least here in MA privacy laws are pretty damn stringent. I’m cognizant of that & well, take my job seriously. Personally, I don’t flaunt my silver or talk about it w/family or friends, but I do insure it in case of a loss. I’d like to think most of us in my profession are pretty damn honest.

Silverbugs,3drdo6,catandmouse663,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:50:07 2015 UTC,Just curious what card you use for 2-2.5% cashback? Most I've seen is capital one for 1.5% on every purchase.
Silverbugs,3drdo6,robpbb,2,Sat Jul 18 22:52:52 2015 UTC,"Citi Double Cash card gives 2% back in a slightly convoluted and rather slow way.  All purchases earn 1% cash back. All payments earn 1% cash back... unless the payment is from redeeming rewards as a credit against your account balance.  No cash back rewards for that payment.  However, you can easily redeem your cash back rewards as a transfer to your checking account instead (doesn't need to be a Citibank account).  So in the end, if you do it right, you get 2% cash back on all purchases (after you finish paying for them).  I try to use my Citi Double Cash card for all my eBay bullion purchases, for obvious reasons.  The only thing that kind of annoys me is that your rewards don't become available or even show up as pending until the statement closes for the month.  There is also a minimum redemption amount of $25.  I really like how the 1.5% rewards Capital One card makes rewards available immediately after each purchase posts, and I believe there is also no minimum redemption amount with Capital One."

Silverbugs,3dpz0i,idonthaveacoolname13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:19:12 2015 UTC,I am surprised but I am new to this too. Two weeks ago I had this place willing to sell Washington quarters at $3.15 each which was good I now know. I went in the other day to make a big purchase as spot was down about .50. They were going to sell to me at $3.10 each then said it was actually up to $3.25 due to premium. This is still a good price it seems. I ended up trying a different place later in the day and got about $10 worth for around 12.2 x so you never give up. Just keep checking and pounce when the time is right.   Monarch precious metals has a decent deal even factoring in shipping and credit card fee. I was looking at 3 or 5-6 to maximize the shipping bracket savings.  It is under 13x.

I pick out all the silver ones, and re-deposit the ones that are only worth face value to a different bank. It's like a risk free investment... you just have to do the work.

Liberty coin on eBay also has 100 oz RCM silver bar for $1,585.  I don't know if I should buy another RCM bar or the cheaper JM bar.  As for the gold, the Philharmonic and the Britannia are better deal than the Maple.  Both have $23.52 eBay Bucks so it's only $16.47 over gold spot.  I have the 1 oz gold Philharmonic and it's really nice coin.  It's bigger than some of the other .9999 gold coin which I like."

Silverbugs,3dnorn,TabletTeacher,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:20:05 2015 UTC,I say take the deal! An ASE is an ASE unless its a key date/low mintage year. You may find that some dealers do sell previous years for a little more then current year ones but that is because they are selling to those that don't know any better or to those that need a certain year for there collection. This does not mean they are worth more as those same dealers when you go to sell one day will pay you the exact same amount for your random year box as they would for a all 2015 box.
Silverbugs,3dnorn,CrazyRusFW,-2,Fri Jul 17 19:57:24 2015 UTC,"If he made the offer, I'd ask for two rolls to see what he says. Or, if another coin interests you, ask for a roll of those and the roll of ASE's. Maximize your profit as much as possible. Or, ask for bars and a roll. If he is offering 25 ASE's, he can throw in a 10oz bar or two as well.   Let's assume he is going to average a $5 markup where spot is at for each of these coins. That is a $2,500 ""profit"" for him. He is ""giving"" you 25 coins which would cut his ""profit"" down to $2,000. Surely he can throw in another couple hundred bucks of silver. Even if he gave you another 25 coins, he is still ""profiting"" $1,500. Get as much as possible."

So he is making $1,250 on the monster box from the OP. He is than giving up that same $2.50 per coin from the 25 he is giving to the OP. So, he is than ""losing"" $62.50 to the OP, leaving the LCS with an $1,187 profit. Surely the LCS can give up another roll or some other silver.

Yes, spot went down, but what happened to bullion prices (not much) and availability (it sold out.)  So, if those folks who see prices below $10 for silver and $1,000 for gold are right, will you be able to buy it at that cost?  There's still lots of opinions on that, but this drop which was relatively minor in comparison suggests that demand will increase, availability will go down, and premiums will increase.  Which is an argument for buying steadily, even if the trend for precious metals is still bearish.  In the long term these will probably still be relatively cheap prices, even if they're not the lowest we're likely to see."

Being an idiot and not reading the T&C closely, I figured ""heck yeah"" I'd take 5K of their money at no charge, and then pay it back in six months.  It was only after getting the $5K that I found that any new charges to the credit card stacked up behind the $5K loan, making it impossible to pay the card off each month (avoid interest charges) because any payment went towards the loan first.  I'll also echo Energy_Turtle's concern about borrowing money (even at zero) to buy metal.  As a recent Kitco interview made clear, 9-10 dollar silver is a possibility in the next few months, depending on demand out of China.

I just don't think it is likely to get a return in the long run. There seem to be many better options out there. 10oz Perth coins have been on sale a few times for just over spot at eBay (Bay Precious Metals).
Silverbugs,3dmk68,hooahreddit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:58:46 2015 UTC,"I just don't think it is likely to get a return in the long run   Why? Because it's specific to one dealer?  From what I remember, they have a mintage of 50k compared to 80k for the CML lunar privys?  Do you know of CML privy's that historically haven't appreciated well? They all seem to do pretty good from what I've seen.  I did grab some 10oz perth from BPM."

Silverbugs,3dlcbe,lovecarbs,7,Fri Jul 17 05:06:07 2015 UTC,Let me see if I can fill in here:  The coptic crop circles are in alignment but it's too soon to tell here if there is support for such a movement.  Silver might move up unless it moves down.  We can see evidence here in the forms of these graphs which go up and down from time to time.  I am hedging either way.    Seriously though I did read over the posts from time to time and they seemed informative and well thought out.  I lost interest in when the infomercial started with the two little small twin brothers running around though.  :) Truthfully I don't think anyone can predict the market at all though.

If you are too fucking stupid to understand something, that does not make it a bad thing. I am smart enough to know that I don't know everything and this guy has a better handle on it than me, so he is a resource.

Easy peasy  EDIT:  We used to have an option on the site for local pickup that showed up when you entered a zip code within a certain radius of our office.  We no longer have it there.  We do offer a pick up option if you call your order in and request it.  There is a $10 fee to come in and pick up because like /u/dclctcd (had to look four times to make sure I typed that one right!!) guessed, it's out of our normal processing system and takes time away from what we're trying to do.  Basically, it's really inconvenient to us so it's a service you have to pay for if that's what you really want.  Lotsa people do it.  Maybe they hate their UPS/USPS guy?  Maybe they don't want it in their mailbox?  Idk.

Silverbugs,3dhozc,dclctcd,2,Thu Jul 16 21:47:59 2015 UTC,"It's obviously much simpler and cheaper to have everyone order and pay from the same streamlined system than to set up what would amount to a shop. They would have to maintain a till, carry cash to the bank, create a secondary bookkeeping system, train a few employees and build a room dedicated to these transactions that looks nice, is easily accessible to clients and is separated enough from the rest of the company for security reasons. Right now, all they have to do is have an employee pick up your package and bring it to you at the door.  I'm talking out of my ass, I don't know what their building looks like, they may already have a nice front office, but from a business standpoint, it makes a lot of sense to ask all of your clients to order and pay through the site."
Silverbugs,3dhozc,oneinch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:47:25 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying. I used to work for a web based company that did have a place for local customer to come into and buy products. Didn't really have to train anyone special because there were account managers and which ever account manager was available would take care of the customer. It wasn't a nice little section either, it was a small enclosed space in the warehouse area. Didn't need a separate bookkeeping system, they used Quickbooks and Quickbooks can run in multiuser mode and now there is Quickbooks online which is Quickbooks in your web browser.  Still, it was used often. Granted the company I worked for sold security cameras and equipment and not precious metals.   I live about 5 or 6 miles from their location which. When I order from their site I have to pay shipping and it might take them a day or two to get my order shipped and then at least another day to get it delivers.

But with inflation that's about $17 in today's dollars, so in 23 years the investment actually lost money.  No, I didn't sell at $45 either!  :p   Whereas a S&P 500 index fund would have returned about 1,200% over the same period.  Buy as a hobby or a SHTF hedge, not as an investment."
Silverbugs,3di0dm,EPIC_BOOBS,2,Thu Jul 16 20:37:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, PMs are not an investment.  They are another form of savings--outside of the banking system.  You can't look at it terms of how much your silver inheritance is worth now because silver is on a down-turn.  However, look at the fundamentals of our economy.  The Fed is scared shit-less of raising the interest rate a quarter of a percent!  When Volcker came in a few decades ago, he bitch-slapped the economy back into shape with interest rates as high as 20%!  We just messed it all up again with the tech stock bubble in the 90s.    The economy is worse now because we are a few TRILLION dollars in debt and no one wants to spend money.  We make nothing, spend nothing, wages are flat.  We are lucky that the rest of the world uses our dollar as a reserve, or else we'd be another Zimbabwe.    When the chickens come home to roost and all of our printed dollars flood the market, we will then see the potential PMs have in terms of the being then best savings vehicle.    I'm not trying to be a cheerleader for PMs here, but if someone wants to put money away in savings, why put it in a bank account and make next to nothing in interest?  Might as well put it in something physical and store it away until needed or the time is right to sell.  No one can tell you the future.  We can only look at the past.  All we know is that fiat currencies never last.  Never have, never will."

Silverbugs,3di0dm,blevdawgAg47,6,Thu Jul 16 13:07:54 2015 UTC,"In any other investment, be it stocks, bonds, real estate, this is actually horrible advice. For example, I have stop loss orders on all the stocks I buy. if the stock drops more then say 5% I accept that I was wrong and take my loss quick, living to trade another day. Yet somehow with silver I want my investment to lose ground. I want the $5 an ounce days to come back. I will rationalize all purchases I make somehow. Silver has an odd hold on me.  Imagine for example if people stacked wall mart stock like we do silver. Hopping the stock will drop so they can buy more. Telling themselves they have lost nothing because they have not sold yet."
Silverbugs,3di0dm,Anarcho_Capitalist,2,Thu Jul 16 14:56:32 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you.  I wish I knew about stop loss orders when I invested in the miners.  I am very new to stock investing, so I'm learning.  I didn't invest that much money in the miners, but I am down on my investment.  However, I am waiting for a bigger drop before I put more money in mining stocks again.  As far as the physical metals, I sometimes think to myself ""why the hell am I buying now, when I know silver will drop again?""  Then I rationalize it with ""well, who knows if this is the bottom?""    I think we have this intrinsic belief that because silver and gold were never technically worth $0, we can continue to buy when the price keeps dropping.  Compare that to stocks, where the price CAN reach $0.  I would take the bet on 1000s of years of historical value in PMs over a couple of hundred years of stock trading history."

This makes the stock drop even more then the large firms buy the stock they wanted for way less then normal. I don't have a link but you can easily find  examples all the time. The trick is to be very large and politically connected before trying this. If you are without political connection you go to jail, if you have them you make mad cash."
Silverbugs,3di0dm,Anarcho_Capitalist,2,Thu Jul 16 20:47:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree.  The nice thing about owning PMs is that you hold a store of value, not a promise.

Silverbugs,3di0dm,ryanmercer,3,Fri Jul 17 15:43:38 2015 UTC,"This is because they where made with more expensive silver, as time goes by and new rounds are made the price will drop. The new rounds will lower the overall cost of a mints inventory. That is if that is how they keep their books. Or the mint will need cash to produce more rounds. Then they will lower the prices, take the loss, and move on. give it time."
Silverbugs,3di0dm,Anarcho_Capitalist,2,Thu Jul 16 13:35:11 2015 UTC,"made with more expensive silver   I don't believe this is why. From my understanding the mints hedge themselves to make spot price irrelevant. So I think it's just because they have high demand that they raise premiums.   For example, I bought some rounds for 60 cents over spot a month ago, but I think that was a promotion and not anything to do with at what price they were minted.  Do you have a source explaining things your way?"
Silverbugs,3di0dm,aletoledo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:59:02 2015 UTC,"No, no source, just my understanding. If you buy silver for 15 and mint it you cant sale if for 14 or even 15. While supply and demand do mater more then anything, and mints may lock in good prices, if the mint paid more then spot for silver, they have to adjust inventory worth, buy more to lower average, or keep prices where they are. In truth their are probably many factors."
Silverbugs,3di0dm,Anarcho_Capitalist,2,Thu Jul 16 17:19:19 2015 UTC,"source   Going by this source, the way I see it working is as follows: retailers such as apmex or sdbullion are just reselling and not actually buying the silver themselves. They stock inventory just like a clothing store stocks inventory, but they don't actually buy the coins from the mint that makes the coin.  For those that actually buy the metal, they hedge by shorting it in the COMEX. so if the price goes up after they buy it, they pay for the losses on the short position and if the price goes down, then they collect the difference on the short position. All this with a paper short position and long in the physical."
Silverbugs,3di0dm,aletoledo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:02:21 2015 UTC,"This does work, but shorting means one pays interest. If the market rises then they must also pay interest on the losing short even though they cover. If the market drops they see no reason to rush in with low prices and only make money on striking fees. The market may come right back anyway. It is a good strategy that almost guarantees a strike fee profit, but think about it like this  You buy an ounce for ten dollars and short and ounce for ten dollars. You have a strike cost of a dollar. The market drops to nine dollars.  You are now up a buck in the short minus interest. down a buck in physical, and down a buck in strike cost. So you are down a little more then a dollar. This means cost for you is now 10 + 1 + interest, say .01 - short gain of 1. That's 10.01 cost while silver is at nine bucks and ounce.   You cant sale for cost and lose money of time and wages, and utilities and such. Not many companies can exist without at least a 10% mark up. This is just to break even, and what is the point of breaking even.   The old silver must sale for a profit. Yet some people keep books in a way where they have an average inventory cost. Now say you have that 10 dollar ounce but you buy 10 more for nine dollars. That brings your inventory cost to about 9.09 making it easy to sale with spot around 9. But one needs cash to buy more silver and one needs time to order it, ship it, mint it, and so on.   Why would a mint or dealer sale silver at a loss because spot went down for a day or two.  They will only sale that at a loss if they cannot get what they need out of it and need liquidity bad to continue operations. Or if everyone else is doing it and they are losing market share. So we see why prices rise fast and fall slow with all commodities."
Silverbugs,3di0dm,Anarcho_Capitalist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:10:39 2015 UTC,"but shorting means one pays interest.   The cost is encompassed in the premium.   Why would a mint or dealer sale silver at a loss because spot went down for a day or two.   maybe I'm not following, but if the spot goes down, they collect on the short paper contract at the COMEX. They lose on the cost of the short sale, but if that is 10 cents and their premium is $1, they still profit 90 cents.   You are now up a buck in the short minus interest. down a buck in physical, and down a buck in strike cost. So you are down a little more then a dollar. This means cost for you is now 10 + 1 + interest, say .01 - short gain of 1. That's 10.01 cost while silver is at nine bucks and ounce.   Where are you getting the +1 from (strike cost)? My understanding is that they short thousands of ounces at once, so the cost to short is merely pennies per ounce.  In the end, the mint pays 10-20cents for hedging in the price. They have a premium of maybe 50cents after that and then they use volume from that point forward."
Silverbugs,3di0dm,aletoledo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:37:26 2015 UTC,"The plus one is the cost to mint one round. I can only imagine it cost about a buck to make and ounce of silver into a round of silver.  I did a bad job of explaining. If you buy silver and short silver then your cost is locked in at the price you paid.   So ten for an ounce, ten to short and ounce, then the market drops to 9. So now you are down a buck and up a buck, but your cost is the same, ten dollars. You did not lose a dollar but if you sale the silver for less then ten you lose money.  You lose a dollar on your silver 10-1. you gain a dollar on the short 10-1+1. This means when you cover the short you have gained and lost nothing. You still own an ounce of silver for ten dollars. yet. your short covered the original 1 dollar loss, but that does not mean your cost is now nine dollars, it is still ten."
Silverbugs,3di0dm,Anarcho_Capitalist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"The plus one is the cost to mint one round.    Good point. I would calculate that low as well though.  Interestingly  enough, under islamic law, when they create islamic gold and silver coins, the cost to produce them can not be incorporated into the cost of the coin. I only know of them soing this in Indonesia at the moment.   You did not lose a dollar but if you sale the silver for less then ten you lose money.   Thats the purpose of the short though. When the mint executes the sale of the minted coin, they execute the short contract. they collect the $1 from the short, plus the $9 from the coin and they're back to the $10 of the cost they bought the silver at.   your short covered the original 1 dollar loss, but that does not mean your cost is now nine dollars, it is still ten.   If I'm following your way of thinking, you're double counting the $1 loss. When the mint bought the silver they paid $10. When they sold the silver they got $9 from the customer plus $1 from the short. There are no other factors, don't double count the $1.   What they are out is the cost to mint and the cost of the short contract. Presumably this is just pennies though."

More importantly you can hold silver in your hand and many people would rather trade with something physical   and there it is. This is the paradigm shift taking place right now.   Bitcoin is also trackable and has less privacy or anonymity (out of the box) than cash or PMs do.   I recently bought something from china with bitcoin, without a third party in the middle. Direct person to person payment. I sent the individual the bitcoin and it was confirmed in 11 minutes. Can this be done with physical objects? No. I also cross arbitrary lines that cannot be seen from space, called borders, with bitcoin in my brain, literally. Can this be done with metals? No.  On top of this, bitcoin has a hard limit, 21 million coins that will ever exist. Does gold and silver? I would say no. On earth? Yes. Space? No. Meteors have already been discovered that contain vast quantities of gold. Bitcoin has a hard limit that cannot be altered, and bitcoin can be transferred on earth or through space in very short periods of time.  Also, I would like to state that bitcoin is only a payment channel, which makes the blockchain function. It is only the token. Your assets(silver/gold) will one day have the ability to be registered in the blockchain.  Now, having said all that. I own both metals and bitcoin."
Silverbugs,3dg5z6,bearjewpacabra,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, bitcoin has more flexibility than metals and can be used to transfer large stores of wealth instantly to anywhere in the world with very low fees.  Every transaction is recorded on the block chain so it can be linked to you with enough investigating if needed (i.e. if the NSA wanted to they can tell a transaction took place and link it to the wallet/IP address to identify the parties involved.)          I don't take into account metals being mined from asteroids as it is currently not a feasible source of PMs. That can change one day, but currently the expense and risk to those that try to mine asteroids outweighs its benefits. I'm open to a paradigm shift (i.e. the shift from paper assets to tangible ones). The government and bankers LOVE the idea of a trackable digital currency like bitcoin... if anything they would create their own coin (like what citibank has been working on) and either make bitcoin illegal or make the regulations so stiff that it would deter people from using it (i.e charge large amounts of taxes, transaction fees, and threaten you with force if you don't follow their rules.)   I think the best solution is linking the two, a physical asset easily exchanged and verified by the blockchain. I am not claiming to have solutions to how this work, but I think having crypto tied to a hard asset would be a win/win (even if some centralization is required). My main concern is it should be done within the private sector with physical vaults that are audited and verified by third parties. That's just my 2 cents :-)"

I used the comedic theme of the bud light advertising campaign to try and get my point across.  Here is an example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_T8OtRTwBs    I think this is the forth time I've tried to buy something from them but the premiums shot up immediately before I pulled the trigger.  As for their news, it's good, but the community boards openly mock the three names I listed for being so wrong all the time, I find the boards quite amusing at times.

It means the packaging of the coin is destroyed and can't be reused but if I get a coin that needs a holder I like to use a fresh one of my own anyhow.

Silverbugs,3dfvr1,billysbrew,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:38:45 2015 UTC,When I started stacking I got unto then because of the resale value of the Walkers. I ended up trying to collect 10 of each in hopes of keeping one abs seeking nine complete sets. Unfortunately the prices on the following issues didn't reach the level of the Walkers. Eventually my interest wained and I'm now down to one set for myself to store on my boat.   I have noticed that the quality of them is hit or miss. Of the 15 Walkers I owned at one point over half of them had milk spots or dings. I'd order 10 brand new from Provident abs half would have a spot or ding. I finally sold then off and moved on to other collections.
Silverbugs,3dfvr1,silverhawk75,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:46:17 2015 UTC,"We're the walkers a real limited run since they were the first, thus the premium on them?"
Silverbugs,3dfvr1,TeaFella,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:57:31 2015 UTC,"The walkers actually have the 2nd highest mintage so far.  I'm guessing the premium has more to do with it being the first one and the popularity of the walking liberty design.  Honestly, I'm surprised the premium hasn't come down yet."
Silverbugs,3dfvr1,silverhawk75,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:42:19 2015 UTC,"Cool. Didn't realize how low of a mintage these were. 40,000 seems pretty low but I guess it is a pretty niche market. Thanks for that info."
Silverbugs,3dfvr1,mrmyrth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:54:12 2015 UTC,What /u/teafella said.  Basically boi9ls down to being the initial release  and a popular design.  The releases since have been hit or miss with their popularity.
Silverbugs,3dg1m5,spanishfry,2,Thu Jul 16 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean the 1883 Hawaiian coins (10c, 25c, 50c, $1). Any of these coins in nice quality are expensive, but the $1 is going to be expensive in pretty much any grade. If you can be more specific on which denomination you would want and what grade you would want it in I can give you an idea of what would be a fair deal."
Silverbugs,3dg1m5,tleilaxan,2,Thu Jul 16 02:50:25 2015 UTC,"Hey yes I sure do.  I'm interested in affordable grades I guess, which would probably be VF.  eBay completed is anywhere from $500-$1100 as the baseline for the $1, which is what I'm most interested in at the moment.  I saw an ungraded $1 today in a shop for $1500+ and it wasn't au or anything special."
Silverbugs,3dg1m5,tleilaxan,3,Thu Jul 16 03:36:35 2015 UTC,"Unless you are really comfortable in your ability to spot fakes, I would stick to graded examples of these. The $1 in particular is quite commonly reproduced, with some very convincing fakes out there.   You can find decent VF-details or XF-details coins at some of the larger auction houses for less than $400 and you don't have to worry about getting fakes. I wouldn't pay more than $500 for one unless it was graded AU-55 or better by either NGC or PCGS."

Silverbugs,3ddr3y,Ag47baby,6,Wed Jul 15 15:13:35 2015 UTC,"Also, I only buy 1/4oz and smaller.  When the time comes to sell, 1oz limits your market to a select group.  You can always get the premium back for the fractional stuff."

Silverbugs,3df8jx,mrmyrth,8,Wed Jul 15 20:22:18 2015 UTC,"Can anyone explain why the term ""delayed"" strikes fear in people?     I appreciate there are several companies that are illegitimate who take orders/money and never deliver. But for the most part most companies honor their sales. Why does it matter if it takes a week or a month if you lock in the price and it delivers in the end?"
Silverbugs,3df8jx,Slave_to_Logic,3,Wed Jul 15 23:40:08 2015 UTC,"I prefer the simplest explanation.  A lot or people bought on the dip last week and Provident ran out of some bars.  They ones they can re-order quickly are marked as ""Delayed"".  You can still buy them and lock in the price so it's not as if you're missing out on the low spot price.    And if they didn't mark them as ""Delayed"", people would be complaining that they're selling bars they don't have."
Silverbugs,3df8jx,TeaFella,3,Thu Jul 16 00:07:42 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with you except on the last dip, I've seen the ""delayed"" tag disappear when price went up 30min later."
Silverbugs,3df8jx,ProvidentJoeMerrick,5,Thu Jul 16 00:09:17 2015 UTC,"We're pretty straight forward.  Is it possible that we marked something as delayed only to find available stock somewhere else so we could turn it back live?  Yes.  Is it because the price rose 15c?  No.  We don't mess with ""Stock Delayed"" just because prices took a tumble.  Prices tumbling don't matter to us because everything is hedged.  What matters to us is availability of product.  That's when premiums change.  Silver eagles are severely limited right now.  That's why we're selling at a ridiculously lame premium right now; our replacement cost went up so our sales price had to rise as well.  No conspiracy.  Supply and demand."

If the ""delayed"" tag did disappear\reappear for some items I would again defer to the simplest explanation and say that there are a lot of people buying this week so inventory is bound to be chaotic particularly for smaller companies like Provident."

I can go from cold to an ounce of liquid silver in less than five minutes. I use borax flux. I little dab'll do ya, but too much is better than not enough.  Get the molten silver hot enough to swirl around in the crucible a bit.  That works the flux and takes contaminants to the side. Be sure to ""season"" your crusibles with flux before you start.    MAPP gas is required, I'm afraid. Get a torch made for it.   Good luck and be sure to share your results.  Edit: damn it, I spelled ""crucible"" right only one out of three times in a single post.

Silverbugs,3df5l6,randombits,3,Wed Jul 15 22:01:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response.

Silverbugs,3df5l6,spockdad,3,Thu Jul 16 02:06:23 2015 UTC,"I agree /r/silvercasting is a great resource.  And /u/Guiller67 is amazing (there are a lot of amazing casters here and on the silvercasting sub.    However, from what I have read and seen on this, MAPP is a better choice but propane will work.  You did not mention if you are using borax when melting.  You should 'season' your crucible with it, and sprinkle a bit on your silver as you are melting it.  It helps to lower the melting point of your silver, and will keep it from solidifying so quickly. Also, I know with molds, you want to preheat the mold, so I am thinking you would want to do the same with a sand cast."
Silverbugs,3df5l6,Guiller67,2,Wed Jul 15 21:17:35 2015 UTC,The crucible is well seasoned but it would seem I am not using enough borax when I get the silver liquid. I haven't seen swirling it around like others have suggested.

We have seen this see-saw before, Yellen says the Fed is raising rates--silver dips...she comes back and says not raising rates yet--silver spikes. Wait until the Fed actually tries to raise rates, a measly .25%.

It is funny how he sort of guessed at $10 saying ""what's another $5 drop?""

I worry a bit about that with some of the other mints.  Oh, and 100 oz. RCM bars do have serial numbers, which I like, and stack very efficiently.  Just curious:  Why did you blank out the serial number?  Do you believe there is some way that somebody not at the mint could trace that to your personal address?"

Silverbugs,3dbmd2,mrmann123,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:04:48 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the posted picture is more than enough to file with your insurance co. Especially if you are someone who has a receipt for a 100 oz bar, like say, people in this forum. It isnt his privacy, but the ability to resell the bar. If someone were to file a loss with their home owners or renters insurance, have a receipt, and that image. It would essentially block this bar from being sold as serials are recorded during a purchase, but rarely a sale. Try selling a serial numbered item in a pawn shop, there will be a check with the PD for stolen property, at least in the US."
Silverbugs,3dbmd2,mrmann123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:01:41 2015 UTC,"I can speak to the blanking of serials. If i was someone who had a record of purchasing silver and was looking to do some insurance fraud. This is where I would hang out. The PM dealers don't list your serials in the receipts. So it would be very easy to buy a 100 oz bar, download this image, have an accident/break in, and turn this image in to the PD and insurance company. I would be paid, keep my bar, and OP's bar would be unsaleable to any organization required to check serials against stolen property records. Odds of that happening to OP's bar are slim. Odds of someone looking to do that kind of scam needing a resource like this subreddit are very high."

By your insurance company?  Mine won't cover PMs except for some ridiculously small amount.  If your home insurance covers significant amounts of PMs, I'd love to get more information.

Silverbugs,3db111,Summunabitch,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:12:40 2015 UTC,"It was.  I have a few techniques for getting low prices from ebay.  1) Skim the ""ending soon"" list for whatever category you're interested in.  In this case, loose gemstones, and bid low on anything you like.  2) Sort by price, and bid low on lots of similar items.  You may end up with 2 or 3 of the item, but it'll be for way less than you'd usually get 1 for, if you get into bidding wars, or ""buy now"".  I only really recommend doing this with cheap items."

Silverbugs,3db111,raman51,3,Wed Jul 15 06:16:56 2015 UTC,"Not to threadjack but the ""manipulated by DeBeers"" thing is pretty outdated. They don't own the majority of mines anymore. You can chose to or not participate in their tenders; there are many more options available.   It's been a few years since I was involved in the business so I may not be completely up to date, but then DeBeers only produced about 30% of the world's rough diamonds. I would guess that number has declined since then as other mining companies like Rio Tinto have become very successful.   I'm not saying the market isn't manipulated to some degree, I believe most (all?) commodities are in one shape or form, but the DeBeers myth thing is not accurate at all."

Now, the spread may widen from current levels so you have some risk in the market being less liquid, but someone will always be there to take the arbitrage on the transaction.

Silverbugs,3d9713,slim_chance,2,Tue Jul 14 18:16:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's possible, but generally only with certain elements, and certain isotopes within an element. Silver's heavy unstable nuclides have halflifes of 10 ms for +1, and 2 sec for +2, so 10 seconds after the bombardment stops, it's back to stable. Hafnium can absorb 5 neutrons before it even reaches an unstable state.

When exposed, the silver in the dimes changed from Ag-109, which absorbed neutrons very easily, to AG-110, which is radioactive. The dimes, for about four minutes, were capable of emitting low-energy beta radiation. After 10 half-life periods, less than a tenth of one percent of the original activity remained and could be detected only by highly sophisticated equipment. . . . the exposed silver transformed itself into stable Cadmium-110.""

The discount is our lowest tiered price regardless of quantity.  So if you would normally have to order 500 to get a certain price, you get that price even when you only order 1.

Silverbugs,3d8v7w,vamper,-1,Tue Jul 14 13:56:03 2015 UTC,"Hypothetical situation - let's say everyone switched to something like Valcambi gram bars. Something like this (Australian currency prices dont freak out lol). Everyone had a little satchel full of their gold and for larger transactions used coins and bricks. What would be the pitfalls assuming that once it's common people will know how to identify gold correctly? Is there any machine you could put next to a register to confirm the gold is real? Maybe one that weighs gold and confirms it at the same time?  I really know nothing about the technical aspect of gold, but the idea fascinates me."
Silverbugs,3d8v7w,Knownzero,5,Tue Jul 14 15:09:54 2015 UTC,"Counterfeiting would be a huge concern, and difficult to verify in small portions, as well gold loss would be a bit of an issue, where if its a backed currency atleast the object of value is still safe, and come audit time would be determined to raise the value of other dollars."

Now, i love my silver, and would love for it to rise so i could recoup some of my investment... maybe even flip it for fiat and drop it into the market as it falls... rinse repeat every few decades/years as tides rise and fall.  however, 10 years ago, silver sat between 3 and 7 dollars for 20 years, and behind that it was under $10 for 30 years... outside of some crazy spikes (tulip buying?) its been low.   now i would have to agree that its insanely low with inflation and known supply, and industrial use, and gold ratio... but that could be for a million factors, we have already seen the world burn, and silver sit flat. we have watched as every prediction is turned upsidedown.   however, in 3-6 months i hope i look back at this post and say wow, i was quite the pessimist as i fondle my excessively expensive stack."

Silverbugs,3d8xup,onemananswerfactory,2,Tue Jul 14 12:46:02 2015 UTC,"""Proof"" refers to a minting process. The planchets are polished to a mirror finish before striking, and often treated so that the devices will have a frosted finish. This contrast between the fields and devices is known as cameo contrast. The coins are also struck multiple times, to ensure that they are fully struck, showing all the fine detail of the design.   These modern proof sets are not terribly collectible. I'd expect to be able to sell that set at slightly over junk silver value - maybe $20. There are TONS of them produced, when compared to older proofs - which are highly collectible. Each of these coins has a mintage of at least 540K (116K of these sets sold, 423K of the full silver proof set, and neither are sold out yet). In comparison, in 1942, one of the highest mintage ""old"" proof sets - there were 21K sets produced, and they weren't sold in hard plastic cases, so many more have gotten lost/damaged/melted over the years. The 1942 sets have appreciated considerably - these new sets are unlikely to.  In general, products purchased directly from the US Mint are a very poor buy. They're way over-priced, are typically over-produced, and don't really carry much value. There are, of course, exceptions for hot new releases which initially carry a huge value increase over the mint's price when they sell out - but those are a special case."

Silverbugs,3d753v,justanothershell,3,Fri Jul 17 16:57:33 2015 UTC,I buy government issue stuff 99% of the time. I don't understand the people that never buy it and only buy the cheapest silver. I think 60% is too low. Generic silver is stuck with spot as far as value. Government issued silver has numismatic value. It does not fall as quickly or heavily when spot drops like it does with generic silver.  When silver was $16.50 I bought my Libertads for about $18 dollars. When silver dropped below $15 I could still get that (or much more) for my Libs. You aren't getting $18 for a shitty buffalo round when spot is $14. You get more than what you pay for if you buy government issues right.

But there's absolutely still a pretty strong market for a lot of foreign stuff - both old circulation coins and modern bullion.   As a corollary to this, there are a lot of LCSs/pawn shops/etc that don't know much about foreign coins, and frequently undervalue foreign pieces. There's a lot of potential for returns this way, once you start to learn what's what.   Even aside from finding stuff that's undervalued, a lot of new release foreign bullion coins tend to appreciate pretty significantly year-to-year. Perth Lunar stuff and Chinese pandas are pretty much guaranteed to do this just about every year - a year ago, you could get 2014 Pandas for $4-5 over spot. Now, even though spot has dropped significantly since then, they tend to go for about $28-30 each. Older ones, even more."

Silverbugs,3d7c14,e30kgk,3,Tue Jul 14 02:30:14 2015 UTC,"If things ever get so fucked up that an ounce of silver is worth less than 2 GBP or $5 CAD, it won't even matter.   Also, it's significantly more plausible that 2 GBP or $5 CAD will be worth less than $1 USD than that an ounce of silver will be worth so little you'd be trading any of these coins at face value.  The face value is meaningless. It's a technicality used to authorize government mints to make bullion - the US mint only does what Congress authorizes them to do. Congress can very clearly authorize the minting of coins, but they can't necessarily command the mint to produce collectible tokens, because that's not what the mint is there for. So, slap a face value on it, and it's a coin."
Silverbugs,3d7c14,e30kgk,0,Tue Jul 14 02:22:37 2015 UTC,"Is the British pound or Canadian dollar on it's way down? Both coins are +$3 whereas the Silver Eagle is always gonna be $1. Both of these monetary systems would have to lose 2/3 of their value to make these coins less than $1. At that point, the UK and Canada go 3rd world status.  I am talking about worth beyond the silver spot."
Silverbugs,3d7c14,justanothershell,2,Tue Jul 14 02:26:06 2015 UTC,Face value does not add any value beyond bullion value. You can sell a coin for its bullion value (spot+premium) OR you can spend it at face value. You can't do both.   edit: The only way the face value has any relevance is if the face value becomes greater than the bullion value - and therefore the coin is worth more as a coin than as bullion. Silver would have to lose more than 2/3 of its value for that to be the case.

Thailand actually has a thriving gold market.  My advice to you? Bring your Thai mother in law and use common sense. Only go to big established places with an online presense/reviews. With that said with such a thriving gold market you'd have to try hard to get burned.  Why don't you just buy in the US though? Not that different in price for gold."
Silverbugs,3d6ika,mrmyrth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:32:14 2015 UTC,I have not personally compared prices I was told by my relation that the price is a lot better over there. I am going to do some comparison before I buy anything. The market we went to last time was a whole street that had gold stores one after another for a few blocks. I am assuming this is where we will go again and I think they were honest because my wife's grandmother bought her a necklace there.

Thais are really big on gold. Like REALLY all about gold. So I'm pretty sure that if you see Thais buying from a vendor, then you're probably okay too."

Paid by CC on 7/7.   Still sitting at confirmed payment. They sometimes are fast, sometimes are slow. But, I ordered one time a modern commemorative that said it was in stock, after a week .....I finally was called and they told me they did not have it. I got something different, then they shipped. Prices are decent, but if you plan on a gift, or something you need in 2 weeks, that will probably be when you get it. Almost makes a cc purchase not worth it, myself, I use a cc for online purchases for safety.  I kinda quit using them for anything I needed right away. 1 to 5 days is the supposed shipping time with cc purchase. With 4 days being the norm for me. Maybe they are extra busy. I guess I'm annoyed because I bought these as a gift, I need by Friday. Hoping they get shipped soon."

Silverbugs,3d5kuq,silverhawk75,2,Mon Jul 13 21:49:14 2015 UTC,"Well, I posted the above post and sent an email this morning, I generally give them a week. I expect 3 days is sufficient if they have stuff in stock. Does it really make a difference if I have to wait another few days? Not really usually, But I figured Id have my order in 2 weeks, So I can give the gift for my cousin's birthday.  I'm just saying, If you want your stuff in a decant amount of time, I cannot recommend them. I quit buying from them on a regular basis, But, I made a small test purchase in may, Went well, Now of course when I need my stuff, it doesn't ship expeditiously. Regardless, I'm off topic a bit, BUT I wonder? Do they really have stuff in stock? What's holding order up? Privateers in Stock? Grand Canyons? Zombucks? All show in stock. I ordered when Spot was 60 cents cheaper, That's the other annoying thing also. If I paid by check, Waited the 5 days to clear, Then another week, Then another for shipping, It looks like a purchase with a check would be a 3 week situation. Of course, their prices are better than most, And I am sure I will get my stuff. Certainly sound like a whiner,. I do. :)  Just like expeditious customer service"

Like, if you take USPS priority packaging material and use it as free packaging and then wrap it in paper to put postage on that's actually a crime and they can and will come after you with fines and potentially seek jail time.  With media mail though, if it has anything that's not approved media (even a note or receipt counts as something that isn't approved media) they usually just return it to the sender. Sometimes they'll deliver it with postage due and a notice to both the shipper and the party receiving it. Get caught twice or more and they'll start hitting you with fines. Get caught even more times (or piss off a postal inspector as little as twice) and you can face prison time."

Silverbugs,3d5wiq,catandmouse663,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:23:23 2015 UTC,"They've been selling that for a while. If you're really looking to pick it up, check back with them regularly. It's the lowest premium on a platinum coin I regularly see, though I'd personally rather have a platinum CML on a good deal. The ""out of stock"" may just be out of stock for this sale, again, I've seen the platypus in their store for a while.  They also have a 1 oz palladium CML.  It was $696 over this weekend, it's up to something like $721 when I was checking their current auctions earlier today."
Silverbugs,3d5wiq,magenta_placenta,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:14:03 2015 UTC,"I know they had it in their store.  I've been keeping track of the price almost everyday hoping it went on sale like they did with the platinum CML couple weeks back.  Today they finally dropped the price on the Platypus and I was too busy with work to check.  :(  I already have the 1 oz platinum CML.  I wanted the 1 oz platinum Platypus for the collection.  Well I guess I saved myself from spending ~$1,100.  I saw the 1 oz palladium CML for $696.  I passed because it was too expensive.  I can get it cheaper elsewhere."

Silverbugs,3d4wj4,FReZSTeR,6,Mon Jul 13 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, when the dollar gains value it becomes more expensive for other currencies to buy goods made with that dollar. When the dollar is weak it becomes cheaper for other countries to buy goods from that country.   A dollar or other currency can become so strong it hurts the economy. For a while the Swiss franc was the safe haven for many investors. This drove the value of the Swiss Franc up and to the point that its exports slowed dramatically and citizens were leaving the country to buy goods from neighboring countries because they could get a lot more for their dollar. By doing so it caused the Swiss economy to slow even more, its not as bad now but some of the measures to prevent the strength of its currency include negative interest rates, a very interesting situation.  One of the reasons China has grown so rapidly is because they keep their Yuan artificially low. This makes it cheaper for the world to buy their goods and services, but not very likely its citizens will buy from other countries.   The recovery in the US after the recession was helped because the Federal Reserve put more money into circulation, making the USD value lower, spurring a small resurgence in American made goods."
Silverbugs,3d4wj4,Chilton1776,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:38:04 2015 UTC,Strong Dollar also makes interest bearing instruments more attractive vs precious metals which do no pay interest. I hope PMs stay suppressed for while longer so us Peasants can continue loading the boat.

Silverbugs,3d4wj4,gordie44,3,Mon Jul 13 15:36:25 2015 UTC,Silver is cheaper for Americans right now at -.47% while silver actually went up .35% for Canadians. At least we aren't in Europe I guess!

Seems like Iran is going to be adding more oil to the global glut, so I think the dollar might have a bit more weakening to do unfortunately. So that means silver is kind of a solid choice just based on that. The usd won't stop rallying though so that's downward pressure on silver.  It's kind of a hard call."

In my last dream I am helping to clean a friends pool.  I find a toothbrush on the bottom (I presume this was because I forgot to brush my teeth before bed).  I then go to clean out the pool filter and there is a little hole in the pool wall alongside the filter.  JACKPOT! I see a silver pocket watch, and pull it out.  I look back and see 2 more pocket watches and a few silver coins.  I pick out a silver coin and look at it.  I then realize how fishy this all sounds, I say ""Aw Damnit"".  I look up at my friend who is outside of the pool and I say to him ""I'm dreaming aren't I"", he goes ""yup"" and I wake up."

Silverbugs,3d48b3,daktardoom,2,Mon Jul 13 11:49:46 2015 UTC,"Frankly, in Europe, if you stack silver to invest in silver, you're stuck with your local junk silver and the best known government ounces (American Silver Eagle, Maple Leaf...). You shouldn't even buy bars. The premiums are just too high here because of taxes.  If you buy to collect and not to invest, then your best bet is to buy a few ounces at a time from American sellers in /r/Pmsforsale and ask them to lie on the envelope and say that it contains ""metal souvenirs"" worth $15, to help the envelope slip through customs.  Buying non-government rounds in Europe is a recipe for disaster. European stackers generally don't want these, so you may have to pay a lot to acquire them and if you decide to sell them, best case scenario, someone buys them for the same price as an American Silver Eagle.  I've been stacking gold and silver since 2011 in France and lost quite a bit of money at the beginning when I wanted the cool stuff like you. I've regretted many of those purchases. My cost average on silver is still at 20.90€ because of my early purchases. I've always been reasonable with gold and as a consequence my cost average is at 1106.92€, which is merely 5.73% over spot.  You should learn to love the junk silver that the stackers in your country buy if you ever want to make money with your silver.  To reply to your question, I buy my pure silver from http://acheter-or-argent.fr, which offers the best prices in my country by far and has quite a bit of variety when it comes to government ounces. The silver bars are extremely expensive like everywhere else in Europe. I buy my junk silver from private individuals so that I can get it for spot or even under spot."
Silverbugs,3d48b3,dclctcd,2,Mon Jul 13 12:33:53 2015 UTC,"I am wondering myself if it’s a good idea to get silver from the US. I want 10 of the Privateers but if I have to pay for customs 30€ for each coin, that would break the bank."
Silverbugs,3d48b3,silberkind,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"It's unlikely that you'd have to pay so much if they were declared and taxed properly. For 10 rounds, an additional 30% of the price seems more like it.  In any case, I don't think that it's a good idea for a European stacker to want these rounds unless you buy silver to collect it and just don't care about spot price.  Buying 3 at a time on /r/Pmsforsale and having them shipped in a bubble envelope as metal souvenirs worth a total of $15 will probably get you out of paying import fees, but 10 rounds are quite a bit more difficult to hide. A small flat bubble envelope that weighs 350 grams is suspicious, but at 100 grams it would be perfectly inconspicuous."

I don't buy that the market has.  Plus I hope Yellen has thought long and hard about the implications of raising interest rates will have to the ""carry trade"" where people (well, banks, billionaires, and hedge funds) borrow billions at rates near 0%, then buy treasuries yielding 3-4%, and just watch the money flow in risk free.  This is the distortion (or as David Stockman calls it - ""Deformations"") of having ZIRP.  People borrowing money at essentially no cost and levering that borrowing 4X over to then buy safe interest bearing bonds.  The returns in percentage terms are small (3-4%), but when you've levered up into the billions, 4% of a billion dollars is $40 million/year, which is almost a living wage for the 1% ;-)"

Silverbugs,3cxlk5,arthropal,6,Sat Jul 11 23:09:33 2015 UTC,APMEX is by far my favorite large vendor. Always quick shipping and excellent customer service.
Silverbugs,3cxlk5,arthropal,5,Sat Jul 11 22:16:57 2015 UTC,"It's far from the norm, as they do bazillions of dollars of sales a month, and 99.9+% of the sales go without flaw.  Occasionally human error creeps in, and thats why they have video evidence of every package being put together.  The slow communication is evidence that their complaints and claims team needs to be upgraded, but by and large they are hugely successful.    They processed your claim as you asked, your only reasonable complaint is the slowness of process and lack of communication."

I am pretty shocked to hear that the order was messed up. I know many people that have ordered from them and they keep ordering from them. None of which has had any issues. I am a little surprised they did not try to make it right and were not responsive. Sounds like they were having a bad week or something.

There was an order a year or two ago where I got some random year ASEs and they were all scratched badly and I emailed them inquiring and they got back to me right away. The email had an apology and a printable return shipping label. I was impressed with the speed and professionalism. I ended up trading them coin for coin with an LCS I'm friendly with so it was all good in the end. All in all, apmex is a solid company. Sure, they're products are usually a little pricier but they make up for it with eBay deals and a massive selection!"

They wanted me to return that one, but gold was down significantly from originally what I paid. Their return policy is to refund at current spot if lower than what was paid. Altho they said they would refund what was the original payment, I just did not trust them to do so. Too big an outfit. Seems like one dept doesn't know what another is doing."
Silverbugs,3cxlk5,APMEXPreciousMetals,2,Sun Jul 12 04:40:21 2015 UTC,"I've had 2 issues with them in the not too distant past.  First, a friend orders me a Niue Turtle proof.  This is what I got.  Those marks on the queen side were on the coin itself and the other side was on the capsule.  Not very proof to me.  I have to pay for shipping to them for their negligence.  Then, eBay had a sale on bullion a couple months ago.  I ordered Austrian 20 Corona that was described as being B/U or Proof-like.  This what what I got.  The scuffs all over it.  When I was told I had to pay for shipping back to them AGAIN, I told them to refund me.  A few days later, they send me another one!  So, I don't even open it and just write ""return to sender"" so I didn't have to pay shipping AGAIN.  Then, 2 weeks go by and I didn't hear anything.  I call them and they say they'll call me when they find it.  2 more days I call again and they say they haven't found it.  3 more days, ""Yes, we found it and we'll credit you in the next 48 hours.  3 days later I call again because I hadn't received my refund.  They said it was sent but I was on PayPal while I was on the phone with them and all of a sudden, there it is.  I will order from them again only if there's something that's a really good deal and I can't find it elsewhere, but they're no longer my ""go-to"" dealer anymore.  The more of the common stuff, you can find cheaper through Provident (longer wait times but e-checks are the bomb) or JMBullion and they're just as fast as APMEX, better customer service and accept e-check."

Silverbugs,3cxlk5,lovecarbs,2,Sat Jul 11 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"I'd say that's not the norm.  Lately APMEX has received lots of flak that appeared to originate from some guy (forgot his name already.. D: ) that made a big stink about them being a bit screwy and taking a while to investigate, when it was just the postal service's fault because a shady employee stole his package or something like that.  When you purchase from them you agree that they have the sole responsibility to investigate incidents if I remember right, but he didn't get the memo. (/rant)    Seems like since then there's been more complaints but they've usually amounted to what you described: poor communication.  I'm guessing they must be having a rough time lately.. Perhaps employees are leaving the company or there's more and more demand, but that's just my $0.02.  All I know is that seemingly 99% of orders are totally without issues.  I've never had any problems with any of my ~5 orders from them other than that the postal service damaged a capsule once, and they shipped me another one and I had it in 3 days.

I just use the chat option as I don't like to wait on the phone and they take care of everything. Most of my problems have been with coins that were slightly toned or scratched and they always have an email to me within a few days with a pre-paid label attached.  I think you have to understand that they have busy and non-busy times and because of the drops in prices, they are probably busier than normal right now.  The important thing is to contact them as soon as you know the problem.  Everything else can take a little time.  I don't worry about how long it takes for them to email me or send my package back -- they do have to inspect things after all in case someone sends back a fake bar/coin.  I really think you should give them another chance.  Most other dealers don't give you postage paid return labels for returns/exchanges on bullion unless there's an error or gross damage to the coin."

In my experiences I have had at least (1) time with each retailer where it took a week to ship with a CC order. By your standards I wouldn't be able to order from any online retailer again.  The order you say sat in Dallas for a week with USPS wasn't even Providents fault but rather USPS's as they were the ones that held it up.   Don't get me wrong I am not trying to knock you, but just letting you know that it is not a normal occurrence with any retailer to ship a week later after a CC purchase. But it does happen.

Silverbugs,3cvxex,irongen,12,Sat Jul 11 05:42:24 2015 UTC,"Fractional old gold is pretty liquid, be they sovereigns, 20 francs, or $5 pre-33' pieces. It's easier for people to spend $200-$300 on a fraction of an ounce rather than ~$1200 on the full ounce. They also represent a time and place in history when things were much different than today. They span centuries, through wars, empires, nations, and countless hands, all to end up in your possession, in the year 2015, far in the distant future when they were minted. That's the main reason I, and many others prefer historic gold over modern bullion. They're both diverse and beautiful, and will hold their value over time, as gold has throughout millennia. So yes, I believe they will command premiums above their actual gold weight and will continue to be in high demand wherever you look. It's all about the history behind them for me though, and I'd pay the premium to own them."

Silverbugs,3cvxex,vamper,3,Sun Jul 12 03:25:20 2015 UTC,"gold is gold... however, .999 gold is often a bit easier due to purity and ease of verification. old coins will still get spot and maybe more... if they are rare or people begin to preceive 100+ year old coins as more valuable."
Silverbugs,3cvxex,spockdad,3,Sat Jul 11 05:50:38 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this. However if you wanted to go the AGE route, liquidity is very easy with them as well.  But they are 22k, but still easy to verify.   They still contain the Troy weight in pure gold that is specified on them."
Silverbugs,3cvxex,Ag47baby,2,Sat Jul 11 06:46:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed about AGEs.  In the United States, they are probably the most liquid gold there is.  Maples are also very easy to sell.  I've sold both to my LCS.  I've never tried to sell European or Mexican fractionals so I don't know how that would go."
Silverbugs,3cvxex,spockdad,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:45:56 2015 UTC,"So you would say it's easier to sell stamped bullion as opposed to coins, simply because they have their weight and purity stamped on them?  Do you think it's worth the increase in premium versus the older coins?"
Silverbugs,3cvxex,vamper,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:09:04 2015 UTC,"I think both would be fairly easy to resell. Everyone has a computer with the Internet in their hand and can easily look up purity for older coins. However, the premiums on older coins could deter future buyers who are just looking for weight. So overall, I would lean toward stamped bullion by a very small margin for overall ease of resale, but gold is gold. And to those who know it, it sells itself at the right resell price.     I know I have both, but it took me a bit longer to buy my 1903 $5 gold, and a 60's sovereign because i wanted to look up the gold content to make sure I was getting a decent deal on them."
Silverbugs,3cvxex,hbcivicsi93,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:09:05 2015 UTC,yes. simply for the fact i would rather pay a mild premium for a known coin... and im a cheap fuck.
Silverbugs,3cvxex,catandmouse663,3,Sat Jul 11 07:14:49 2015 UTC,old coins will still get spot and maybe more   I disagree.  These coins still draw a decent premium over their melt values.    $5 Indian half eagle melt value - $281.  APMEX price on a cleaned one - $361.  Almost $100 over melt  Gold Sovereign melt value - $273.  APMEX price AU condition - $304  $30 over melt  Lucky Angel 20 Franc melt value - $217  APMEX price on average circulated - $238  $20 over melt
Silverbugs,3cvxex,hbcivicsi93,2,Sat Jul 11 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"You're looking at their sell price and not their buyback price.  Most old world gold coins like the sovereigns, francs, pesos, etc are pretty much only worth spot or slightly less.  I've read in Europe, popular common gold coins like the francs are available for purchase at spot.  Here in the US, you can regularly purchase sovereigns and francs for around spot or less on eBay using a credit card during the 4x-5x eBucks promotion."
Silverbugs,3cvxex,Spence97,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"I'm looking at retail value.  Yes, through eBay you can get them cheap with ebucks.  but someone who doesn't use eBay, then their retail value is a decent amount over melt."
Silverbugs,3cvxex,Rastatodd,2,Sun Jul 12 04:25:33 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say that the smaller size makes them more liquid, as others have said.    Coins like old US gold seem to hold a much higher premium as well, even when the price of gold drops.  Never sold one but I've been browsing lately with the recent gold price drop and they seem to have held their price.    Coins like gold sovereigns or swiss/french 20 francs would also be high on my wish list because they seem to have a low but consistent premium over spot that makes them competitively priced with 1/4 oz bullion coins (AGE, maple, etc).  As someone who still enjoys coin collecting a bit, I'd take the older coin over a newer one for the same price!   Really, they'd be about the same (as far as liquidity goes) as other modern fractionals, but both modern fractionals and old gold are easier to sell than full ounces.  That said, I'd prefer old gold any day!  Comes down to what you like best among fractionals!"
Silverbugs,3cvxex,daktardoom,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:13:00 2015 UTC,"I own modern and coin form gold. The fraction gold bars are just what they are gold. Boring. But I do own old gold coins. I own Mexican pesos, the premuim you'll find is much lower than the US pre-33 fare. But just as liquid. Than I have a piece I love because of it's look and it's history. The Peru 1929 1/5 Libra. It's simply a pleasing coin to look at."
Silverbugs,3cvxex,CaptainSchettino,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:05:43 2015 UTC,"I stack both bullion and numismatic silver, but when it comes to gold, I much rather have numismatics simply because of the historical value. And I also prefer fractionals like the French/Swiss francs or Dutch guilders. Not only because they are beautiful coins and have the perfect size, but also because they are affordable, (+/- 200 euro's) very liquid, (the buy back price is always 4 euro's lower than sell price) and they are just beautiful designs. And like others have said. For some reason with gold more so than silver, I love the idea of the coins having been in circulation for hundreds of years. I don't even care about scratches as much as I do with silver.  Either way, they are all very liquid. And coins like the francs tend to increase in collectors value over time, so they are an interesting investment. My goal is to build a big gold stack out of gold coins all having the same size, including both French and Swiss francs, Guilders, and sovereigns. I don't really like the bigger ones that much, personally."

Also if anyone collects any type of sport card, sell them immediately. China is counterfeiting them like crazy and every year the fakes get harder and harder to detect.

When they switched to .999 they were coming from the mint with some weird scratches. I loved the obverse reverse, but was somewhat annoyed that they changed it on a seemingly random basis. Then sometimes only the background of Britannia herself. Still, I bought a few of the newer ones as they came out.  Then last week my Silver Bud found a new LCS to check out and they had two older ones (1999 and 2000). I decided I had to have them so now I guess I'll be filling in the collection!  Here's the five I have currently. I really hope they start modifying the obverse regularly. It's really cool to see Britannia in different poses with different scenes!  Edit: Corrected myself... Britannia is actually on the REverse. QE2 is the obverse."

Granted, you will have an easier time convincing someone that ASE or Maple is a real silver coin compared to a generic silver bar.  Just keep receipts and you should be good to go.  Don't surrender too much of your cash to premiums, especially when starting out.    I agree though, the premiums for those generic bars was not good.  I would have bought generic rounds that have the lowest premiums like buffaloes and still satisfied the ""Scrooge McDuck rolling on a bed full of silver coins"" feeling.

The guy had some pricy morgans and peace dollars and then I saw a pile of junk silver just laying there in the case. I was skeptical but asked how much anyways. He said 10% over spot. I whipped out my phone, checked coinflation and did some math and said, ""deal."" I got three quarters to start with. Next week I'll be buying alot more.

You don't hold a Morgan dollar in your hand and think about where those silver and copper atoms have been over the past billion years, you think about the one and a quarter centuries they've been right there in that piece you're holding.

Silverbugs,3coqmx,namint,8,Thu Jul 9 15:39:09 2015 UTC,Thanks fot the update.  Looking forward to adding a few to the few I have now.
Silverbugs,3coqmx,Starship1,6,Thu Jul 9 15:42:35 2015 UTC,"It really does look amazing. I'm curious how this looks after some time. I'm not sure what chemicals/processes you guys use, and honestly don't know a thing about ""antiquing."" Does it tarnish quick(er)? Would an airtite solve this problem, or since there might be residue would it accelerate tarnishing? How might it look after a year (if you've done one that long ago)?"
Silverbugs,3coqmx,Caututious,3,Thu Jul 9 16:36:41 2015 UTC,Basically the chemical oxidizer completely tarnishes the entire surface to black.  The fine details come from carefully brushing off the excess to the effect you want.  After that if you put it in an airtight or use a laquer the effect will not change.

Silverbugs,3co9a6,whodiopolis,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:56:04 2015 UTC,Geiger is a respectable non government mint. Non government mints are typically referred to as generics and Geiger is definitely a favorite generic to some collectors.
Silverbugs,3co9a6,whodiopolis,2,Thu Jul 9 15:00:12 2015 UTC,Cool. Is Sunshine a non-government mint as well? I like the non-G angle.
Silverbugs,3co9a6,Junkyard454,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:05:13 2015 UTC,Definitely not government. In my mind it is a discount priced mint. If you are looking to merely stack weight they have rounds that are priced very low over spot price.
Silverbugs,3co9a6,whineknot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:24:08 2015 UTC,Cool. I want to stack weight for this first year to get a solid base investment going.

Silverbugs,3co9a6,spockdad,2,Fri Jul 10 14:37:24 2015 UTC,"Silver is incredibly cheap right now. Historically, the gold to silver price ratio is 15:1. This means that 1 troy ounce of gold was worth 15 troy ounces of silver. Let's say the average gold price is $1,150 an ounce(excluding premiums) for arguments sake.

Speculation and excess borrowing can lead to collapse, but there is nothing about fiat currency in particular that means this crash will be bigger and badder than all the others. People have speculated on tulip bulbs, the south sea company stocks, housing prices, stock market prices, and all have led to financial crises. Now our holy and all powerful US currency is going to be the first domino that knocks down the world economy when everyone loses faith in it. I just doubt it, frankly. Sure, it would be bad if people were to lose faith in the dollar (though evidence is currently pointing to the contrary), but it's a store of value as is everything that people speculate on. Also, the massive inflation that was supposed to happen from printing more money is all but yet to be seen. Maybe it's time to admit that we'll never be Zimbabwe in that regard. Our economy has so far proved too big for hyperinflation (and I'm not talking about the relatively small 7% inflation we saw in the 70s). Europe is far more likely at this point to throw us into a spiral than is our own currency. Even then, financial crises have been a part of history since the beginning of debt and money.

Silverbugs,3cmr0b,RurickKingSlayer,3,Thu Jul 9 11:01:43 2015 UTC,"At work right now, but here's some more un-sourced tidbits. The issue is extremely complex, but here's a quick synopsis about the early days of being a 'silverbug'.  The US Mint only is producing what Congress tells it to. Right now, this means they sometimes get stuck minting a bunch of flops(presidential dollar coins, first lady coins, etc), even though the Mint knows there's a limited market.  But back in the 1800s and early 1900s, this was a big fucking deal. Getting the US to adopt new coinage, or new standards for coinage were major platforms in presidential and congressional elections. There were two competing factions, the Industrial/Banking Interest (Goldbugs) and the more populist, agrarian interests with a heavy debt load (Silverbugs). Silverbugs were predominately in the newer Western territories/states, that had large silver mines/deposits. Silverbugs essentially wanted the US to adopt an unlimited amount of silver into the money supply(likely leading to inflation), and more favorable exchange rates for silver. Admittedly, in the decades before the 1890s, silver had slowly been outlawed/excluded from certain large financial transactions-- with gold being the preference. There was also substantial conspiracy theories floating around about the gold market being cornered.  Now agrarian folks(farmers, miners, etc) loved this idea of pushing silver into the money supply. Miners would get rid of silver, and paid handsomely. Farmers would see inflation hit, which means that their loans to big banks will be easier to pay off.  In 1890, the government passed an act that allowed them to buy more silver. But the government paid for the silver with gold notes (gold is really what everyone wanted). When a depression struck in 1893, the US stockpile of gold was hit substantially with people redeeming their notes for physical gold-- only furthering the depression. The act was repealed to stop the loss of the gold stockpiles.  The two factions finally came to a head in the 1896 Presidential Campaign between McKinley (Goldbug) and Bryan (silverbug). Silverbugs were actually called 'silverites' originally, but they wore silverbugs on their lapel to show their support for Bryan. Goldbugs would wear a goldbug on their lapel to show their support for McKinley. It was the issue of the campaign. McKinley won, kept his Gold policy in place.   In 1913, the US adopts a Central Bank -- and metal becomes less and less integral in the money supply.  Silver dollars would regularly be sitting in bank vaults up until the 1960s, no one really using them. Morgan Silver Dollars were generally hated by the population, until recently. The only reason they existed in such large quantities was because the mint was forced to buy up silver and mint them into coinage.  TL;DR: Original silverbugs were a bunch of populist inflationists looking for bail-outs from the federal government."

They need to buy the silver/planchets, produce the coins, market/sell them, etc. Seems like pretty slim margins at best. Hardly seems worth it if the sole purpose is profit."

Silverbugs,3cmr0b,EPIC_BOOBS,2,Fri Jul 10 00:25:50 2015 UTC,Follow the money.  Where does the US Mint get the silver planchets?  What mine(s) supply silver to the planchet makers?
Silverbugs,3cmr0b,ryanmercer,2,Fri Jul 10 01:10:23 2015 UTC,"Where does the US Mint get the silver planchets?   Various private mints, (I know http://www.sunshinemint.com/CompanyProfile.aspx used to have on their site that they were a supplier to the mint).   What mine(s) supply silver to the planchet makers?   Originally they had to purchase the silver from the strategic stockpile, it was kinda the whole point of the ASE."
Silverbugs,3cmr0b,TabletTeacher,-3,Thu Jul 9 03:29:36 2015 UTC,"The purpose is to make money for the US Government. They sell a product and people buy it. It could be considered a ""voluntary tax"" since only willing participants pay the tax. Its not a ""dummy tax"" like the lottery because silver can actually increase in value unlike buying a lottery ticket where your odds of increasing your investment are small.   Why do people buy it? It is an investment that is not taxed. If silver jumped up to $100 an oz, you technically do not have to pay taxes on it. So, it could be considered non-taxed income for those who do buy it. There are many other reasons why a government would make bullion but it all comes back to the $$$$."
Silverbugs,3cmr0b,QnickQnick,2,Thu Jul 9 15:59:15 2015 UTC,"If you sell silver and make a profit you are supposed to file it as capital gains.  If you don't sell your silver then its true you don't have to pay taxes, but if you realize a profit from it you're supposed to declare it.  Of course there is the whole ""I lost my silver over the side of a boat"" thingy"
Silverbugs,3cmr0b,firechill2004,2,Thu Jul 9 03:43:49 2015 UTC,"Many silverbugs have no intention of ever selling to ""make a profit"".  It's more of a method to store wealth and maybe even pass it on to future generations."

Silverbugs,3clmfc,whineknot,3,Wed Jul 8 21:30:56 2015 UTC,"I think you paid too much for it, but that's just me. The Mint didn't put these out, so collectors market will be much smaller.   If you like it though, does it really matter if you paid ~$8 too much?  I like to look at higher premiums this way (1oz .999 coin for example):  If silver is $15/oz, and the oz coin you want is $40, you're basically paying $25 for the 'convenience' (not the right word maybe) of having your oz of silver have an impala or panda on it. You're gonna buy an oz of silver anyways, so do you want to pay $3 of convenience for the same old ASE or $25 of convenience for something you'll like/want more.  All told, the silver is gonna be sold as silver at most places you go (when selling your stuff), so its up to you to decide what you want to spend that little bit extra on. The Impala will have the same amount of silver in it as the ASE, and that value can go up and down.  Calculating your projected returns when dealing with collectibles however is a different game. You have to be half savvy investor, half collector, and half wizard it seems sometimes. $40+ generic zombie coins anyone?

Silverbugs,3cjnzc,GasStationSushi,5,Thu Jul 9 00:33:07 2015 UTC,"Here's an email I just got from Texas Precious Metals, that explains it in more detail. (Hint, it's not all doom and gloom).   It was reported yesterday that the US Mint has run out of silver coins. Some have interpreted this as an indication that the US Mint has run out of silver. That is false. The constraint is not a raw supply shortage, but a manufacturing bottleneck.  By no means does this exonerate the US Mint from culpability for their habitual ""shortages"". The mint carries relatively little stock, and even in boom times annually produces only about 1 (one!) silver coin for every 9 people in the United States. (See attached infographic below). Consider those numbers for a moment. The entire annual silver production from the US Mint can be purchased for ~$750M! (2014 statistics), which is a rounding error in the equity markets, let alone the bond markets.  However, it is important to understand how and why supply constraints occur during periods of falling prices, and why precious metals premiums consequently spike. Let’s use an extreme example to illustrate the nature of how the physical metals markets move.  a. Let’s assume the the spot price of silver is $15 and subsequently falls to $10. b. Let’s assume the annual average demand for physical silver is $1B.  In this scenario, if the demand in dollar terms remains flat, the manufacturing output would need to increase by 50%. The mint would need to increase minting capacity from 66.67M coins to 100M coins - a huge increase.  Now, if the silver spot price fell by 33% in a condensed time frame, you can be certain that demand would increase precipitously. If we assume demand (in dollar terms) doubles, the mint would need to increase production from 66.67M coins to 200M coins. What if demand triples or quadruples? You get the idea. Over the long term, the US Mint might be able compensate, but certainly not in the short term. No manufacturing operation could. Manufacturing is inelastic with respect to short term scalability.  Then you have the domino effect:   The US Mint goes on “allocation"", limiting supply to authorized purchasers. This supply constraint, in the midst of rising demand, forces dealers to raise premiums. Rising premiums on US-minted product induces buyers to purchases other sovereign coins, like Canadian Maples, or privately-minted products. The increase in demand for these products creates the same manufacturing constraints for these organizations that are affecting the US Mint. The problem compounds and lead times extend until demand cools, supplies increase, and the coil unwinds.   These reverberations in the market are Economics 101. The physical precious metals market is minuscule relative to all other asset classes, and small shocks can create major supply shortages.  As of this writing, we have seen premiums rise on Silver Eagles and a few other products, but not widely across all product lines. If prices remain stable for the next few weeks, we would expect a retreat in premiums and supplies to normal levels. With increased volatility comes the increased likelihood of prolonged shortages and elevated premiums.  Jason Kaspar CEO, Texas Precious Metals"

Silverbugs,3ckio7,magenta_placenta,2,Wed Jul 8 23:46:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think it depends on what you buy. Spot held in the mid 15s for so long that the premiums (mostly) reflected that. When we have these sudden drops of .80-.90 into the $14s, not many premiums go all the way down with it. So although you may have gotten a slightly better deal waiting, it's not much to beat yourself up over. Besides, this is a SOLID price to be buying at. Most of us thought buying at $25 was a big dip, then we thought $20 was a big dip, then $18.. etc. When we get these crazy dips this fast into the $14s I don't think many big dealers will drop their premiums on everything. Hell, I remember on Sunday night of Black Friday weekend when we had the crazy sudden dip into the high $14s and a couple dealers just crashed their sites and made stuff unavailable.

Silverbugs,3cm34k,MothaChicken,0,Thu Jul 9 00:11:41 2015 UTC,"If you look at the broker he is referring to you will understand what he is talking about. It is a service that let's you buy ""baskets"" of stocks, these baskets can be customized. I believe he is suggesting that he is willing to do the legwork to create some ""baskets"" geared towards silver then share that information with us to create our own. This is the same guy putting out the daily reports on this sub and this is undoubtedly part of his plan to take out Cramer and be the next daily guy.   I have never heard of it, Motif, but as I actively invest I think the idea is interesting and the fees are comparatively low. As an aside, I found it a great tool do some do some preliminary research as they expose a lot of information without signup."
Silverbugs,3cm34k,trouble_maker,-2,Thu Jul 9 00:18:14 2015 UTC,"haha, god, I hope not.  I have met Cramer a number of times and he is just toooooo wired. =)    The reason why I do the reports is multiple...  I do it as part of my own daily research, I send them out to my own clients and prospects.  I just post it here because I know there are people who would enjoy them.    and correct on motif.  They let you buy a basket of stocks/etfs/closed end funds for $9.95 a basket, for up to 30 securities, so a VERY low cost way to invest in your own ""theme"".  The mining baskets I have seen are quasi etf's which have not done that well, and I think we can do better by applying an additional screen to look at the basket from a different perspective, quality and income.   I cannot do it on other custodians without a lot of fees, hence why motif works well for it."
Silverbugs,3cm34k,L617,-1,Thu Jul 9 00:43:52 2015 UTC,"Undecided if I want to act as fiduciary on it or in what capacity... in part because of below.  I do not receive any commissions, they are fees paid to motif.  In fact, I do not even know if I will be compensated for it or how."
Silverbugs,3cm34k,trouble_maker,5,Thu Jul 9 00:16:34 2015 UTC,"You can only act as a fiduciary if you are licensed as such.  I just wonder what keeps anyone from doing this same thing on their own; with their Roth IRA or 401k for example.  Anyone can create their own basket of investments. I don't mean to just your balls, but this seems like a straight up solicitation for commissionable business.  You yourself say in your post that you don't believe silver is a good investment right now..."
Silverbugs,3cm34k,Peterboring,-6,Thu Jul 9 00:24:39 2015 UTC,"I am quite aware of the fiduciary standard... in fact, I am an RIA. =)  I take the fiduciary duty seriously, and you hit the nail on the head.  I am not 100% into metals as an investment right now, BUT... I do believe everyone should have a small percentage in their portfolios, I just want to have a better way of doing it than just buying silver that does nothing for you. =)  In order for me to stand by the fiduciary standard, I need a written advisory agreement whereby I actually do planning and know the person I am working with.  With my clients, I do charge fees, that are paid directly by the clients to me, and I do not receive commissions as a fiduciary.    I am putting together these portfolios because they are a better alternative to most of the other things that are out there and quite frankly have seen too many people screwed.  Motif is a low cost provider and people can work with them directly, or I can as a registered investment advisor use motif as my custodian.  People can do this on their own, but it will depend on if I leave it open only to my own clients, or make it public.  If I do make it public, then I will have to decide if and what role I want to play with it.  If it is public, people will be able to see the portfolio, but not the process behind it or what I am screening for on the actively managed side.   But... all of that is small stuff if people do not care for it.    So to answer your question, am I soliciting for commission able business?  No.   In part because I do not receive commissions in my fiduciary capacity,  and 2 I do not even know how I want this to be rolled out, (be it public or only to my own clients.)  Hope that answers your questions."
Silverbugs,3cm34k,vamper,-2,Thu Jul 9 00:40:41 2015 UTC,"You could recreate baskets anywhere, but you sure as heck aren't doing it as cheap as they are. 9.95 for the entire basket, then 4.95 individual updates, that's about as cheap as it get's acquiring baskets."

My suggestion is to sell on various message forums (realcent.org, /r/pmsforsale etc) or in person with someone who wants to pay cash.    Of course, you are obligated to still pay capital gains tax in either of these scenarios or however you end up selling them."
Silverbugs,3ck37p,Grimster1,2,Wed Jul 8 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"As the question was how to avoid a paper trail, not how to avoid paying the owed capital gains tax, then I can suggest this page, which shows that certain forms of silver do not require the buyer to notify the IRS of the transaction:  http://goldsilver.com/article/irs-1099-gold-reporting-private-gold-private-silver-bullion/  This is a different question than where you would get the most for your sale.  For that, you'd have to compare online dealers, such as APMEX or Provident, with LCS's.  My impression is that you may get a good deal with less hassle (postage, boxing, mailing) with a LCS if what you're selling is commonly sold by the LCS.  In my area, that means Eagles and Maples.

Maybe some blue jewels, but only small ones for accent.  No big gaudy stone in the front center.  Iv'e seen just about every picture of an antique crown there is to see on Google image search.

That is not a lot of money in the long run especially on an item almost guaranteed to increase in value. Also, look for sources other than retail. It's tough to make a profit when paying retail prices. That's pretty much as expensive as it gets. You lose money right away because no one is going to pay you when they could pay the store and get that security."

Silverbugs,3cka0r,vamper,-7,Wed Jul 8 16:18:48 2015 UTC,And he should be denied. Nothing obligates a business accepting gold/silver instead of fiat and there is nothing wrong with declining the offer.

Silverbugs,3cjro1,purargent,4,Wed Jul 8 15:11:03 2015 UTC,Yep. The spot market and the consumer-level physical market are two completely separate thing. Spot going down doesn't necessarily mean bullion prices will follow.

And using this fear tactic to keep your prices high while spot is so low is kind of a underhanded move. When you drop your prices closer to spot, I might grab some. Until then, I am sure this tactic may work on some, but I am going to search for some real sales while spot is low."

Basically they are trying to market these high priced Eagles to any suckers that might think,""I better hurry over and buy them while Apmex still has some left"". As if to make these people think that if they don't who knows when they will ever have a chance to buy them again. They even went as far to show news articles reporting on the ASE outage. I know that they have to make money and this is a way for them to profit on the current ASE mint outage but I think there were better ways of marketing this to people.

Silverbugs,3cjro1,spockdad,5,Wed Jul 8 17:11:26 2015 UTC,One of the main reasons I loved to have dealers like Apmex being a part of our tight-knit community is because it took the business side out and made it feel more like a personable relationship.
Silverbugs,3cjro1,purargent,5,Wed Jul 8 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"I agree.  As someone who typically orders from them 2-4 times a month it's disappointing.

Silverbugs,3cjro1,808kine,5,Wed Jul 8 17:29:05 2015 UTC,It would be appropriate if (like last year) most places were sold out and ASE's were going for $8 over spot.  But yeah every retailer still has them in stock and cheaper than this.

Silverbugs,3cgndp,maksimfa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"Best way... keep dollar cost averaging into it.  Buy the amount in dollars worth... you will get more OZ.  Don't try to pick a time to back up the truck.  Folks have been backing up the truck all the way from $30's, and $20's, and high Teens too.  Same for the Gold bugs and Platinum bugs... all the way from $1500 down in the last year alone."
Silverbugs,3cgndp,ChopperIndacar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:09:20 2015 UTC,I never quite understood this DCA line of thinking. Why exactly will you get more OZ this way? Let's take a hypothetical period of time. One person spends a consistent amount at regular intervals. Another person spends varying amounts at irregular intervals. They both spend the same total amount over the hypothetical time period in question. I don't see why one person would necessarily have a larger stack. It totally depends on the vagaries of spot during the time period. Am I missing something?
Silverbugs,3cgndp,justanothershell,0,Tue Jul 7 23:14:00 2015 UTC,"Quite a thoughtful post.  Yes, a lot of it really depends on spot price, and the big knock here is of course... it is a stack of bricks that does nothing for you but look pretty, unlike investments that can pay interest or dividends and work for you.  It all boils down to if you think you can perfectly time the market.  most people cannot.  In fact, the vast majority of the last 5 years has been a BAD time to buy as silver has been getting cheaper and cheaper.  People who tried to time it and thought it was too cheap would of ending up spending A LOT of money, compared to someone who just invested a fixed amount of money on a regular basis without worrying about how many OZ it is buying.  Yes, you would not have the ultimate lowest cost per oz... but you are not going to be the sucker who tried to catch the knife.  This is actually the big thing here..., and what is different from metals compared to other investments, the ONLY way to make money with precious metals, is to sell them.  They do not do ANYTHING for you just sitting in either your safe or in your account (IRA)."
Silverbugs,3cgndp,canIgetaWootWoo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:39:36 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your reply. But I'm not exactly sure what you're saying with respect to what I'm talking about. My comment was about simple math. If two people decide to, over the course of a year, spend equal amounts of cash on silver, with one spending theirs evenly over the year to some schedule, and the other person spending theirs in a lump sum on a RANDOM DAY, there's absolutely no reason to think the person who spent the lump sum would usually come out behind. I mean, that's all there is to it. Extend it to a decade and the principle holds."
Silverbugs,3cgndp,justanothershell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:53:34 2015 UTC,"Ok, let me rephrase that.  Yes... they would both end up spending the same... HOWEVER, the person who bought on that random day is really just gambling as to if they bought on a good day or a bad day.  u/chopperindacar did mention time value of money which would apply to investments that pay interest and dividends, but even if we strip all of that out... the person who dollar costs averages into it  will have a far better outcome in terms of risk of losing money.  If you are averaging into the market, you will never get the BEST/LOwest price... but you certainly eliminate the risk of buying it at the very top.  So for instance... If you invested in silver 3 years ago.  $10 k in one shot... http://i.imgur.com/7FBJmZy.png  $750 up front and $250/month ... http://i.imgur.com/378qIJa.png  So in a falling market, you are absolutely protected by putting in money over time.  For most people... it is just a wiser way. For the 2% who can actually pick a bottom... no, not the best.  Edit:  This was a morningstar hypothetical, invested in SLV, the silver ETF."

Silverbugs,3cf7ij,Chilton1776,7,Tue Jul 7 15:28:35 2015 UTC,"nope  https://www.goldbroker.com/charts/silver-price/eur  https://www.goldbroker.com/charts/silver-price/gbp  its down in Euro, Pounds and USD about the same amount.  Nice try tho."
Silverbugs,3cf7ij,SonicShitStorm,3,Tue Jul 7 16:06:27 2015 UTC,"Currently you are correct a majority of currencies are down against PMs and not all movements in PM prices is a result of currency values. When this happens its a decoupling of currency to PM prices. Just as the ratio of silver to gold has decoupled over the last few years from each other i.e. its currently 71 ounces of silver for 1 ounce of gold, 50 years ago it was 25.  While the price of silver is down 4.59% with the USD, the price of silver is down 3.46% with the Euro. The Euro is down .95% vs the US dollar. That means that the dollar has gained value and relatively speaking the price of silver has gotten cheaper for the USD and more expensive for the Euro.   You cant just look at silver prices in USD or Euro and think they directly correlate you have to look at the interdependency between the currencies also."

Silverbugs,3cf7ij,BNLboy,2,Wed Jul 8 02:57:32 2015 UTC,"The Greece news has definitely put downward fundamental pressure on most commodity markets. I'd chalk silver's decline up to it's longterm downtrend. The 5y logarithmic silver chart shows a nearly flawless downtrend. It actually seems like a reasonable time for AG to break through support as well (to continue the trend). I'm no market technician, but have always found basics, such as trendlines, useful. Strong dollar definitely isn't helping.   IMO, Path of least resistance is down until the trend changes or we get some shocking fundamental news."

One that often happens is Apmex selling larger amounts like $50 fv us 90% under us coins so you can get up to 10% back on those ones which is great when combined with ebates and a rewards credit card.

An ounce of silver is still an ounce of silver... nothing has changed except its price that is denominated in fiat paper dollars.   edit. In 2001, silver prices averaged $4.37 per troy ounce. The metal ended the year on a much-brighter note, with silver fixing at $4.52 on December 31, only 7 cents down from the year's first trading day.

Silverbugs,3cfsz3,Herms989,2,Tue Jul 7 16:53:32 2015 UTC,It is a semi rewards program from eBay where you get 2% back on purchases not including bullion category. But sometimes you can find stuff miss categorized and get a little extra money back.  Also they often run specials where you can get anywhere from 2-5x the amount of ebucks on purchases. One of the best it seems normally is foreign gold coins where at times you can get a 10% discount so often under spot.   Google search eBay bucks and you will need to sign up to receive them.
Silverbugs,3cfsz3,AnalyticLunatic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:23:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Do you perform a lot of bullion transactions on eBay? When I was lime green and starting out, that first coin I bought was a 2015 CML Lunar Sheep Privy for ~$37 after shipping from a vendor on Amazon.

Silverbugs,3cfsz3,Herms989,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"I cherry pick stuff off of eBay. I like you use /r/Pmsforsale a few of the major vendors, along with a few different forums for the majority. It seems like deals come and go pretty quick on eBay so you have to keep an eye out.   About 2 months ago silvertowne I believe did a silver spot sale I got 3 tubes of buffalo's at spot which was great. And the Saltwater crocs I posted I think is another good deal. You just have to be diligent and pick and choose your buys.   Also as I'm sure you know now buying anything besides supplies on amazon normally is a rip off so just do a bit of research before you buy. And don't be afraid to ask people around here if a deal is good or not."

Silverbugs,3cg7ho,justanothershell,3,Tue Jul 7 22:03:03 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that premiums in the DC/Northern Virginia area on 90% have increased quite a bit over the summer. In late May, early June when spot was around $16.50, a high volume LCS in the DC Metro area was selling 90% at 13x face value, which is about a 9% premium over spot. Today, when spot was about $15.20, they were selling 90% at 13.7x face value, which is about 24% above spot. They mentioned that there has been quite a run since July 1st on 90% which they attribute to several factors: 1) change in VA law allowing tax-free bullion purchases over $1000, 2) the recent dip and first time spot has been below $15 in five years, and 3) the Mint announcing a halt of sales of Silver Eagles for a while. This shop, which normally has a very wide selection of 90% had sold everything except Franklin halves."

Silverbugs,3cfnhc,MagicalLobster,2,Wed Jul 8 00:41:00 2015 UTC,I may have been a little off on this one. I'll admit to my mistake. JP Morgan is rigging the market but this dip may be caused by the Chinese stock market. I read a news article this morning saying that the Chinese citizens bought stocks on credit. The market started to drop so they started to sell. The government placed a ban on selling stocks. The people had to pay their credit card bill somehow so they are selling their precious metals. Asian countries own a lot of precious metals so I can see the logic in that article. I think China could be the one to thank this time.

So if you want to jump in with some cheap rounds/bars to start, I recommend doing research on the best generic deal right now. Government bullion, and cool stuff like hand pours and high reliefs are for the collector stackers. Now, some of this stuff can be had for decently low premiums. I am a collector stacker, and I pay medium-high premiums on most of what I buy.   For you, I recommend starting with current year government bullion to keep the premiums low and the resale easy. Check out American Silver Eagles, Canadian Maple Leafs, Perth mint stuff. Provident has some good stuff for the collectors that enjoy neat stuff like myself. Apmex has some great customer service, and service in general. JMB has good prices and free shipping over $100. Shinybars has a good selection of poured silver and more.

It is completely ok to break down investments to your horizons.  Quick example...  Long term, I am quite bullish on Russian equities. Intermediate term (8 to 12 months) I am bullish on Russian Equities. In the short term (1 to 8 months) I am shorting the hell out of the Russian market based on current occurrences (dislocations in emerging markets, weaker Ruble, lower oil prices), combined with the fact that we had a nearly 40% pop from the lows within a few months... tooo far tooo fast.

I think if any, it will be small impact, especially when you look at how gold and silver did during our recessions.  Considering that even though the Chinese economy is almost the largest, the investment exposure to foreign capital is still quite small, so it is not likely to have much of a big spillover.

A bad market will get people to stop buying PMs and start selling them. Second, bad money pushes good money out of use. PMs are money, money with taxes imposed on them and who's paper counterparts are enforsed by guns and tax law. Just as we take silver quarters out of cerculation, people in Europe will be buying or selling PMs depending upon their finances. People are not going to try and barter with silver as it breaks tax laws and if they can keep it will hedge against inflation.    PMs will begin to rise after the bust but not during. This is because then people will be on more stable grounds to invest. And because inflation hits after the spending takes place. Money created today may not have an effect on prices for years. And even then it will effect only parts of the market at first befor prices find equilibrium.   Check out this short fun book called. Economics in one lesson."

The problem is the poor and poorly run countries that leach off the others. It drags the system down. That is what is wrong with socialism. That is why people turn to the US.

If the seller is the one who does the RNG, they could cheat or be accused of cheating or whatever. Kinda messy unless we can figure out a way to do it that the community can agree on.  I suppose we could do RAZZ's only once per (X time frame) and the actual RNG portion would be handled by someone that the community agrees is a trustworthy individual. If you dont like the way it works/dont trust the people involved to be honest...simply dont participate?  I like it."
Silverbugs,3ccgmi,satirical_whit,2,Mon Jul 6 21:09:15 2015 UTC,"You have the basic premise down yes in the original example it was 2 ASE's but yep you are buying 1 spot for an amount decided by the seller. You can buy one,  all,  or anything in between.   To take care of the cheating aspect what is done around FB is the whole process is recorded and then uploaded online for all to watch specifically those that have a spot but some of the bigger ones are fun  to watch even if you don't have skin in the game. They use an online video recording and copy the list of people who bought spots into the random number generator then use a dice roll to find the number of times to randomize the names. On the last time of randomizing the names the one on top is the winner.   All that is recorded so there is very little to no chance of cheating. Also some razz's have multiple winners so that is up to the owners disgression."

There would be no reason to remove any packaging prior to sending in.  You could also cherry pick if you thought some were PF70/69 and some were not, though I think if these grade PF68 or above they would more than pay for the grading and thus boost your profits.

Silverbugs,3c9kuw,sneeze_and_fart,3,Mon Jul 6 06:30:36 2015 UTC,"I think a kid that's 8+ would get the hang of it no problem although there are smaller and simpler ones. Have a look at YouTube videos to see what's actually involved in opening them, its pretty much the same 4 motions just repeated.  I bought mine used off of eBay and got a decent deal, I think I paid ~$50.  When looking for them, keep in mind that the word MAME means bean in Japanese (like Edamame). If you see one listed as MAME, and there are lots, just know that these are very small ones.   3 sun, 5 sun and 7 sun are the most common sizes, with 3 being the smallest. You can go huge with these but they get expensive.  There are also different numbers of steps, more steps = longer (but not necessarily harder) to open.  I really recommend looking at solving videos for sizes and how hard it would be."

Yes, having 1/4 of a BILLION cars in the US alone causes pollution.  By having rules like this in place, it helps push the country to greener and cleaner running cars like the example above.  This helps minimize the impact we have on our environment and by comparing a weed-wacker or a small grill to a F-350 with 400+HP is ludicrous."

It rained all morning and was still cloudy when I was up on the mountain, which made for a very eerie/cool hike. Here's a view from one of the cliffs. I've never been on the edge of such a sheer drop before. Looking towards it from the trail, this is all I could see. Very surreal up there. For a few miles up top there's ladders and ropes bolted into the rocks. Here's one set. There's actually four separate ladders there, though it's pretty hard to make out the lowest one.   It ended up being 11 miles total. The way back was rough! For a couple miles I was more so rock climbing than hiking. It was so steep that I needed to use my arms as well. Everything was wet and I pulled something in my leg. I actually thought I might have to give up at one point, which I've never even considered before, but I pushed through. Great fucking day, though.

If they buy gold or silver with the euro and the euro keeps going down they will make money. On the other hand if they intend on buying gold with euros and cashing them out for other currencies in the future like the US dollar they would likely loose money as the US dollar gains value and the euro decreases value. The only reason to buy PMs would be if they intend on exchanging them for Euros in the future, and with premiums paid on the PMs its easier cheaper and safer to buy a stronger currency the euro will depreciate against."

Silverbugs,3c87lq,silverlitecoin,2,Sun Jul 5 21:12:29 2015 UTC,It seems to me that the euro is more risky to hold onto than gold and silver right now. What's happening in Greece right now threatens to break up the EU and along with it bring down the stability of the Euro.
Silverbugs,3c87lq,Chilton1776,6,Mon Jul 6 00:28:26 2015 UTC,"Yes I agree but changing Euros for the USD, Canadian Dollar, GBP or Yen would be better than PMs. There are three ways I see to look at this.    Greece leaves the EU and stops using the euro. Doing so, the EU just lost their worse economy and over night average employment, average wage per citizen and average GDP for the remaining countries go up not to mention the uncertainty of Greece would be gone. By loosing Greece I would expect the Euro would rally like it never has before. I think this is 75% likely. Greece stays in the EU but is unable to pay its debts and the ECB will not lend further funds to Greece because they will not agree to the terms. If this happens the Greek government is unable to pay its citizens (Greece employs 60% of the country). They would still be on the Euro but the economy would be almost destitute with unemployment over 50% and no euros in the country which makes it impossible for trade within the country. At this point I would expect the Euro to rise because the ECB will not be printing more money to lend Greece. The default of existing loans would be small and effect mostly Greek banks and the Greek government who hold the majority of the debt. I think this is 20% likely. The worse outcome I can see is if Greece stays in the EU using the Euro and the ECB keeps printing money to ""loan"" the country to keep them afloat. The vote they had today makes this unlikely, the country will not bend to the request of the ECB and Germany is fed up with subsidizing Greece. I think this is 5% likely."

The Chinese stock market has lost ~30% in a week.  And this a highly leveraged market (people borrowing money to invest money).  When things go way down fast like this, people's borrowed money is called back from the lender (called a margin call), and it forces people to sell their holdings to pay back the lender, exacerbating the selloff decline.  Euro implications aside, Greece's GDP is the size of Boston Mass.  China is either the number one or number two economy depending on how you define economy.  China's market woes could spread a financial contagion not seen since subprime.  Fortunately the Chinese government understands the gravity of the situation and is planning to go full ""Plunge Protection Team"" on the Chinese market, but depending on the cascading margins calls referenced above it may not be enough."

Silverbugs,3c87lq,Chilton1776,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:45:37 2015 UTC,"I'm probably the least conspiratorial person you'll ever meet, but with that said I have a tough time debunking the brilliant work written by Andy Hoffman at Miles Franklin around his analysis of precious metal price fixing.  I bring this up to say, if you believe cartel suppression is going on, then we really can't guess where PM is going, unless we understand what the cartels want PMs to do.  At least until the cartel loses control of COMEX (if that is to be believed).    I think a very good analysis of the situation is laid out by Jim Rickards in his book The Death of Money.  He sees the future of the dollar as going either hyper-inflationary, or a deflationary death spiral.  Either of those is good for gold, but deflation is bad for silver because of the commodity aspect.  Hoffman would argue that we're at or past peak silver because of price suppression, so even deflation won't help the supply shortages resulting from no additional mining occurring, and the need for silver in so many applications.  Personally, I see the Greek (Euro?) meltdown, the turmoil in China's markets, Puerto Rico declaring bankruptcy, a 40 year low in US labor force participation rate, Asia's slowdown in manufacturing (Korea/China) as all ""warning signals"" of major global financial issues on the horizons.  When and how those issues manifest themselves to be is anyone's guess.  Will it be managed, or will it spiral out of control?  There's too many unknowns.  Consider this thought exercise:   LTCM went bust in 1997 causing ripples across the financial markets, but other financial market players bailed out LTCM.  In 2007, subprime nearly collapsed the entire financial market, but the Federal Reserve bailed most of them out.  Does this mean the next crisis will be at the Fed / Central Bank level, and if so, who bails out a central bank?  Could the IMF with their SDRs pull that off?  Maybe, but what would that world look like?"
Silverbugs,3c87lq,MaxFreedomMoussa,2,Mon Jul 6 16:14:39 2015 UTC,"The Chinese market has been in a bubble for a while and really needs to come down to reasonable levels. Currently the entire market is thought the be 40% actual cash and 60% borrowed money.  Another interesting point to make is many of the loans in China are backed by PM's or copper. Most people/companies borrowing are required to put up a certain amount of the commodity in case the loan goes bad. Most do not have enough of the commodity on hand for the loan so they borrow it from companies and pay a monthly/annual fee (much like bonded companies in the US). If these loans go bad and margin calls happen the bank sells the commodities that backed the loan, thus increasing supply and can drive the PM price lower.  I have read much on China and US exposure to its market. Its actually very hard to invest capital in China if you are not a native. Many of the markets are not available to outside investors and in China its almost impossible for a nonnative to own a factory. However foreigners can own land, and thus a huge land bubble was formed by foreigners trying to cash in on the growing economy. China has a lot of potential for future market share, but currently exposure is limited to companies like Yum! brands selling fast food, industrial companies that sell machinery and some banks that use complex holding corporation to own stock in Chinese companies or Chinese debt.   China imports little from the US and the biggest import by far is food, something they will have to buy regardless of their economy. On the other hand we import much more from China, if their economy goes to hell our imports from them get much cheaper and any exports to China we loose will easily be made up for by buying imports cheaper. If China goes through a hard time the US will be ok, not great but ok. Australia on the other hand will have a much rougher time."
Silverbugs,3c87lq,Chilton1776,2,Mon Jul 6 02:16:00 2015 UTC,Why do you say Australia will have a much rougher time?
Silverbugs,3c87lq,MaxFreedomMoussa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:45:21 2015 UTC,"Australia is one huge island composed of commodities. A huge part of their economy is selling natural resources to China and over the past 20 years it has done very well as Chinese demand has grown near exponentially. If China slows down the demand for natural resources from Australia combined with a global slow down in demand for their natural resources puts Australia in a bad position.  Currently Australia has one of the highest minimum wages in the world at $17.29 USD, educated or professional trade workers average $60.00 USD an hour. They also have a huge real estate bubble of their own. For example a 2 bed 2 bath in Sydney not near the water could be bought for $100,000 USD in 2000, the same house would sell for $1,000,000 - $1,200,000 currently. With a decrease in commodity consumption a lot of Australian Industry will lay workers off because the $17.29/hr and up wage is unsustainable for nonessential employees. These workers will try to sell their houses to pull out the equity or because they cant afford them without a job. When you have enough people running for the same exit the situation can easily become over done and it becomes a price war with your neighbor. This brings the market back into realistic terms, but all of the Australians that took 2nd and 3rd mortgages on their equity will be stuck with an underwater home. Exactly like the US was in 2008 and we all know how that went, especially when Australia has no ability to bail its financial industry out."

Australia definitely has the ability to bail it's financial industry out, at least insofar as the US did.  I would LOVE to see a correction in house prices, but I don't think it will be that drastic. Personally I'm a dual US + Aus citizen and make most of my money from the US so it doesn't really bother me, if it was up to me I'd want the weakest Aussie dollar possible and the cheapest houses, haha.  Although China does make up a staggering 26% of exports, a reduction in the % exported to them wouldn't have the earth shattering effect you think. Keep in mind we export more manufactured goods than mining products. Though in 2015 so far 21% of apartment purchases have been from foreigners - mostly rich chinese who buy despite the new protections/taxes meant to discourage them/raise funds - so seeing that be impacted would be great IMO but of course horrible for people who own large amounts of property or who bought their house purely for investment.  The fact is young Australians are being priced out, and that needs to change."
Silverbugs,3c87lq,MaxFreedomMoussa,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:18:19 2015 UTC,"I agree the biggest threat to Australia's financial security is the disenfranchisement of its youth from basic things like owning a house.   Australia would have to fall a long way for that to happen, considering nobody makes the minimum wage here. When I was a manual labourer for a teenage summer job (18 years old) I started off at $22 an hour.   A large part of Australia mining is only profitable at a certain spot price. Iron will be profitable no matter what, but gold and platinum would have to be in the $700+ USD for it to break even (Thats not accounting for a lower petroleum price, Im not sure how to even begin to estimate that, but it would make the $700 figure decrees as its the most expensive part of mining.) Once its more expensive to mine than sell for a prolonged period layoffs are inevitable.   Australia definitely has the ability to bail it's financial industry out, at least insofar as the US did.   Australia's GDP is $1.4 trillion USD, currently the national total of mortgages originated from Australian banks is $1.3 trillion. If the banks were to have to underwrite maybe 25% of loans it would be almost a quarter of its total annual output. The United States has a GDP of $17.4 trillion and an outstanding mortgage balance around  $13 trillion. It doesn't seem like much of a difference, but its significant when you consider Australian real estate has increased 5-15 times its 2000 values while the US only increased 1-5 times its 2000 values.

The more volatile currencies are the better gold does, and with the BRICS bank launching next week, the Euro trouble, etc I predict gold as a storage of value will be wanted.

Adjusted for inflation the average price of gold is $600 an ounce.   This part I don't get, what does the recent increase in value make it harder to bail them out if the %'s aren't that dissimilar? Wouldn't that make a crash easier to handle since it would be a return to what was normal just 5-10 years earlier?   My apologies, I was trying to find a way to say that in worse case scenario (I know very unlikely, but still worse case) if the US house pricing were to fall to 2000 price levels it would be more manageable to the US than if Australia were to fall to 2000 price levels. Australia appreciated much more than than the US so it would be a much larger percentage of wealth lost due to this and thus harder to the economy to stabilize than the US. If Australian prices fell to 2000 averages it would be a 80% drop in the $1.3 trillion mortgage loans where as if the US dropped to 2000 levels it would be a 20% drop in the US's $13 trillion mortgages. Australia's 80% drop would be $1.04 trillion or 74% of its GDP. Where the US's 20% drop of $13 trillion would be $2.6 trillion or 20% of its GDP. I know its unlikely, but its the only numbers that I have to work with and in this case the US would be more likely to be able to manage its burden.   That's almost a ridiculous estimate for a Chinese recession... I was with you up until this part, that's almost laughable.   Once again, I think this was lost in translation. Its a fact that these three countries account for 51-60.5% of all Australian exports. Even if these three only decreased 10% of its imports if they have a recession it will still be 6% of Australia's total exports. I am not saying that all 51-60.5% of exports will go away.  Australia is a great country, and I respect them, but the parallels between their economy the last 50 years and that of a boom-town are very similar."

Silverbugs,3c87lq,maksimfa,2,Mon Jul 6 01:11:57 2015 UTC,"CAD value is hugely based on the price of commodities, much like the Australia dollar. When the US economy began to weaken and commodities were strong the CAD gained in value. Now with the USD on a rebound and commodities loosing value as global demand weakens the CAD has lost ground.   If I was trying to preserve purchasing power of the CAD against the USD I would sell any assets in Canada for CAD or borrow if the rates are low and invest in companies that do all or a majority of their business in the US.   As the Canadian dollar weakens it gets cheaper for the US to buy from them, but more expensive for Canadians to buy from the US. Find companies that produce products for the US market with goods bought in Canada and buy stock in these companies. You could also do as you suggested and buy a basket of US companies, but if the US starts to slow down its recovery, you might get caught in that downtrend. I think it would be safer to buy Canadian companies. For example if company ABC buys iron ore from a Canadian mine in CAD and makes car parts to sell to the US for USD that would be a good start. Something else might be company XYZ that writes software in Canada, but sells almost exclusively to the US for USD. If you want a safe investment that will prevent purchasing power depreciation in CAD just buy US savings bonds. Even with low interest it would appreciate against the CAD if the CAD goes down.  Just go through the Toronto stock exchange for ideas. If you have land or expensive items just laying around cash them out for CAD now and buy USD or a currency you think will appreciate for CAD going forward."

Silverbugs,3c9ucc,flyingburrito2000,-2,Mon Jul 6 06:08:40 2015 UTC,"Precisely.    In my comments on Friday I mentioned having uncertainty over closing out and cashing in some of my silver shorts.... the fear was... the ""No"" vote was going to lead to rioting... which would cause metals to go up... as most major unrests would do. (Fear trade).  I was right on the ""No"" vote, and fortunately people are celebrating the vote and not rioting.  Euro will likely be at parity, meaning $1 to 1 Euro.  USD priced metals will have lots more pressure on them.  What will potentially hold it up a bit is the Fed comes out and signals no rate hike this year."

At 32 kg (70#), it would be trivial for someone to pick it up and carry it off somewhere they could open it at their leisure.  Despite not knowing anything about the manufacturer/brand, I'm guessing, based on the fact that it's only 70#, it's probably not terribly secure to begin with - weight and security are pretty closely related.   Also, that's a tiny safe - that works out to .56 cu ft. If you've caught the bug, you're going to outgrow that in a heartbeat."

If spot goes down  $.50 the only reason he is giving you a higher price is that he is trying to max out his profit at your expense. I personally would prefer a bit more and buy from a source the bases their prices on a math equation (spot + expected profit = price) than buy from someone who is just trying to take me for as much as they can.

I'm surprised he let you walk over .5xFV if you offered that to him.  I find its best in these scenarios to just haggle. Haggle friendly. It's a competition of sorts, but can be totally friendly. You know, smile a lot, point out the problems with the item if you must but dont make that an obvious tactic like many people do. Pawn guys will see through that in half a second.   Also the more time he spends with you, the more likely he will be to want to sell you something to make it worth his time."

Surely even by the most lax standards this is illegal, but what makes the farce even greater is that all of this taking place out of FDIC-insured entities!  The final question, which we are absolutely certain will remain unanswered, is whether any of these dramatic surges have anything to do with the recent move in precious metals prices, or rather the complete lack thereof, even as Europe is on the verge of its first member officially exiting the Eurozone, and China's stock market is suffering its worst market crash since 2008. Oh, and we almost forgot: with both JPM and Citi now well over 50% of the derivatives market in two critical categories, who is the counterparty!?   Talk of metals manipulation is pooh-poohed here, and evidence of such is discounted and downvoted.

Show me someone else.  I am not insulted by your comments, I am actually smiling and gigling to myself about the broad strokes you are painting.  So... let me break it down...  No, my livelyhood does not depend on convincing anyone of anything about the PM markets.  In fact, my business as a whole is not depending on it at all.  We go for where the opportunities are, wherever the markets are.  As far as experience with PM's, someone in my office was in charging of purchasing precious metals used in their chemical company before they switched careers.   When they tell me it is not ""rigged"" I tend to believe them.  Keep in mind, they bought and handled actual metals, not paper stuff.  I am not going to justify the second paragraph because it does not matter whether it is right or wrong (banks controlling market),  but I will say you are completely clueless as to what my business is, and oblivious to the fact that I could care less what the markets do because there will always be ways to make money.  I am looking for a market correction personally, so I along with clients can make money buying dirt cheap like we did in 2008.  For the other large percentage of the holdings, we hold actual real assets that once again, do not correlate or have anything to do with stock and bond markets.   Keep in mind, Bulls and Bears make money.... Pigs get slaughtered.  I personally own silver bullion, and have posted quite a few pictures... however I was not stupid enough to take advantage of major selling and short silver myself.  The REAL MONEY made shorting it... buys me A LOT more silver and other investments had I just been a pig and spent money buying it all the way down.  You are not going to make money holding a brick that does nothing for you, with the one exception is when it all collapses and someone else is stupid enough to give you more.  For the ""Zombie"" scenario, you would be far better off investing money into land, firearms and training, survival training, and anything else you need to in order to survive.  A pile of bullion will buy you some stuff (if it is currency), but the real people in control will be those that have the skills necessary to succeed.   As such... my SHTF bucket investments are LOTS of Guns, Ammo, (and equipment to make more at any time), land, and a spouse who  spent most of her college education in the fields of middle of nowhere Russia working the land.    I AM a conservative, but I also don't live my life thinking it is a rigged game.    Even if the markets are Rigged... it has not prevented me or my clients from making money.  That is what you have to realize. =)"

If you read the article, they mention specifically silver as they code and lump Gold elsewhere.  In all likely-hood they could of easily gone long or short, it is not disclosed.  Could of quickly sold the exposure or closed it as the information is from March.  The greatest issues we are facing are those of deflation and slow growth, not runaway inflation.  The world bankers wish for inflation, but it is not happening.   Just today Greece voted ""No"" and the metal markets are selling off, along with the euro.

The low fees for transfer and redemption with BG are vastly superior to what Banks (at least in Canada) charge for their precious metal programs.  Not everyone is of our mindset of hold=own, so for many people this is a viable alternative to the bigger metal holding programs.  Also, I have an associate who is an extremely smart and savvy man in the financial sector, formerly a grand poobah muckity muck at a large metals house, and he's gone so far as to sink considerable funds into shares in bitgold, so I have confidence enough to dip my toe in."

I don't usually buy encapsulated coins anyway, I'm a coin collector not a ""spotless piece of jewelry in a plastic container"" collector.  Then what do you do when the plastic gets scratched?  You gotta open it and then any collector like me wouldn't give it a second look.  That includes anything from a third party grader.  Opened is opened and will never have the value of an untouched coin from the mint, I'd take the uncracked ""unknown grade"" coin from USM over any TPG product that says MS70 any day.  You know anything coming from the mint will be perfect.  I do have some proofs and uncirculated coins in airtights but probably less than 15 ounces.

So I go to ask the guy that buys the crap and ask him he looks online and explains they buy at 80% of spot so like $13 per ounce and I kinda balked at him and repeated what person 1 had said. He blankly looked at me and said he would go ask his boss. Comes back and says ""ya we give a quarter more for those walking liberty things.""

I feel disgusted.  For instance, at one time I traded in some gold and platinum and got $580 in trade. It was a gold 1/4 ounce eagle and a 1/10 ounce platinum eagle, plus 3 ounces silver PLUS I think $20 or $30. For that, I got an 1885 quarter eagle that was cleaned. It was marked as an AU58, and raw (ungraded).   I was able to sell the coin for almost $200 less than that. I even posted the coin here, where everyone told me it was cleaned.  Once I went back over the stuff I've bought from him, I've noticed that I got ripped off a few times.   So, yeah. I wish the circumstances were different."

For example, I bought these fireworks privy CML's, in the original RCM wrap, for .79 over spot http://imgur.com/JSifMdJ .  Again, sorry to hear your story. Sucks getting screwed..."

He's also fun to talk to because he does know his shit. And like I said, I absolutely love his selection and how everything is out in the open for you to see. That's the one thing I dislike about other small coin shops - you have to know what you want before you go there because not much is out to see.  I should just suck it up and deal with it for being a beginner and go back there with a better head on my shoulders."

If they absolutely have to put people on them, I'd prefer if they looked like ancient greek sculptures and not like porn actresses from the 70s.  They could also make bars that contain silver recovered on the bottom of the ocean in a shipwreck, silver that was flown in space (a lot of silver flew to the Moon during the Apollo program) or silver taken from very old, but damaged silver objects and create relevant designs.

If your question was actually about what I collect, I have a few different collections. Egyptian, Celtic, Roman (mostly imperatorial, from Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, Augustus, etc...), Greek, Merovingian, Carolingian, Viking, medieval, royal and modern gold and silver. I also have sculptures from ancient Rome to the 20th century in the form of marble or alabaster busts and statues, pieces of medieval and royal castles, dated keystones, etc... I also have ancient objects like this Egyptian amulet I posted a few days ago on Reddit. I also have many autographs and historical documents from people I like Albert Hofmann who invented LSD.

Silverbugs,3bxbte,dclctcd,2,Fri Jul 3 20:27:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, a handful of auction houses host space auctions quite often. The best pieces are sold and bought through them. Last month, Buzz Aldrin's PPK bag (small beta cloth pouch in which the astronauts placed the few items they were allowed to take with them to the Moon) sold for $50,000. It wasn't even the most desirable or expensive object sold during this auction. There's RR Auction, Goldberg, Regency Superior, Lunar Legacies, Bonhams, Heritage, Ned Sanders, Christie's and a few others. I also buy from other members of CollectSpace either on the site itself or through eBay. You can also buy directly from the astronauts, but I've never had the honor of doing this. Lastly, there are a few online stores, but most of their flown objects tend to be fragments of objects in gaudy presentations. I don't support cutting intact objects to make presentations, but sometimes these are the only flown objects a collector can afford. Most desirable Apollo objects cost in the $15,000-$60,000 range, but plenty of artifacts sold for $100,000 or multiples of that. It's quite a challenge for me to assemble a space collection since I'm French, many things can't leave the US due to ITAR restrictions and import fees put every purchase at risk of being taxed heavily, but if you're American and have enough disposable income, you can have a lot of fun on this market. I think that in 30 years we'll marvel at how (relatively) affordable and accessible the treasures of early space exploration were. It's a very rewarding hobby just as much as it is a great investment opportunity in my opinion."

Not really an issue, the guy was very cool about the whole thing. He ended up getting another one of his tested and it was only 18k Gold instead of 22k.   The thing with the fakes is that a lot of them are made out of gold. Back when the price of gold was less than the face value of a sovereign, a lot of the fakes were made with the real gold content. One guy actually made them out of 24k gold.   I have learned a lot about fake sovereigns since I bought that fake half. It was actually a pretty good lesson for me, and didn't cost me anything except my time.   The half sovereign is only slightly smaller than the full.   Edit: FYI, you can buy Sovereigns from APMEX on ebay and get Ebay bucks too. With a 4x Ebay Bucks you will get the Sovereign for under the price of spot."
Silverbugs,3bwv49,shinsmax12,5,Thu Jul 2 22:10:26 2015 UTC,"The thing with the fakes is that a lot of them are made out of gold. Back when the price of gold was less than the face value of a sovereign, a lot of the fakes were made with the real gold content. One guy actually made them out of 24k gold.   Just to clarify, the gold content of a sovereign has never (since the UK came off the gold standard) been worth less than 1 pound (the face value) - that said, the sovereign has long been used, especially in the middle east, as a form of trade currency.   This is where many of the fakes originate from - gold was minted into fake sovereigns simply to facilitate exchange. as a sovereign is recognizable as a .2354 ozt chunk of gold, whereas some blob you melted isn't. Sometimes this was done by unscrupulous individuals who diluted the alloy, leading to things like the 18K piece you mentioned above.   Additionally, there was a period (1950s ish, as I recall) when sovereigns hadn't been made for some time and traded at a considerable premium to their bullion value. A lot of near-correct-alloy pieces came from this time period, as well."

They are cool (historically, and to look at and play with) and also useful.  A sovereign scale (which is made to check both sovereigns and half sovereigns) checks multiple things:  1) makes sure the coin is not thicker than it should be  2) makes sure the coin is not larger in diameter than it should be  3) makes sure the coin is heavy enough to tip the scale  With the idea being that if the coin is not thicker or larger diameter than a real sovereign, it won't be heavy enough to tip the scale unless it really is a sovereign.   sovereign scale: http://i.imgur.com/KkKZgNo.jpg checking thickness of half and full sovereigns: http://i.imgur.com/sWLRycv.jpg checking diameter and weight of half sovereign: http://i.imgur.com/vXKpVbp.jpg checking diameter and weight of full sovereign: http://i.imgur.com/YRSmkWh.jpg showing that a 1/10th gold Eagle isn't heavy enough to budge the scale, even though it doesn't contain much less gold than a half sovereign (and even pushed way out the edge of the half sovereign holder): http://i.imgur.com/JCEYsXX.jpg   Sorry for less than awesome photo quality.

The sovereign scale is a Harrison scale; there were a couple other makers of them as well.  They shouldn't be hard to find, as they were made as tools for shopkeepers while sovereigns were being actively used as currency, which was quite a while.  My set was an eBay find that I won at auction for just over $70 shipped.  I think typical prices are generally much higher; probably more like the $100 to $150 range, at least from what I've seen on eBay.  However, they seem to frequently show up as low-starting-bid auction items.  I wouldn't be surprised if you were to run across some in an antique store/mall as well."

From what I have read there are 2 types of counterfeits. Ones that are made of base metals and ones that are faked but still contain the correct amount of gold.   I did a little research before I bought my 1914-S and 1918-S full sovereigns recently.

Silverbugs,3bw6dg,spockdad,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:30:29 2015 UTC,"I can tell you from experience don't try this in your microwave.  Skip the clean setting on your oven, too."
Silverbugs,3bw6dg,arthropal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:28:12 2015 UTC,"Silver is hard to melt without proper equipment, unlike aluminum which melts in a steel can over a wood fire.  You'd want a kiln or furnace that can reach silver melting point and beyond (~1000C) and a crucible that can take the heat, ceramic or graphite.  I agree, you should check out /r/silvercasting  Lots of talent, experience and equipment there."
Silverbugs,3bw6dg,vamper,2,Thu Jul 2 18:29:07 2015 UTC,"Silver is actually fairly easy to melt.  All you need is a propane torch and some patience.   And with a silver tray, you would want to cut it up into smaller pieces before placing them into a crucible.  Instructions Place silver scraps into the crucible. A crucible is like a cup that is used to liquefy metals since it can tolerate high temperatures.  Light the propane torch using a flint striker or lighter. Turn the gas on high so you have hot blue flame.  Hold the crucible handle in your left hand if you a right-handed. Hold the torch in your right hand, with the flame close to the crucible so that it's a couple inches away from the metal.  Add about 1/2 tsp. of borax to the silver once it starts to melt a bit to prevent it from oxidizing as it heats up.  Concentrate the flame over the crucible, carefully swirling the metal in the crucible from time to time to make sure all the metal bits have melted. Heat the metal until it liquefies.  Immediately use the molten metal for casting, or pour the molten silver into a metal or wood mold, if desired to cast a brick or ingot of silver for later use.  (Be sure if you are using a graphite mold to heat it with another torch before pouring molten metal into it.  And keeping the torch pointed at the mold while pouring will prevent oxidation).

Silverbugs,3bw6dg,randombits,2,Thu Jul 2 18:49:57 2015 UTC,"I've tried this with both copper and silver and have gotten a blobby mess both times.  My propane torch just doesn't put out enough energy to melt to liquid, because the crucible and metal radiate heat away, and you have to be able to put energy in faster than the piece is losing it.  That's why melting furnaces tend to be excessively insulated to keep that energy in.  I hear there are inexpensive torches that you can use, but mine certainly isn't one."
Silverbugs,3bw6dg,spockdad,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:53:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I had to upgrade to a fancy torch head to get enough heat... Before I could barely heat 1/2 oz to liquid. And keeping it liquid was nearly impossible, better torch and its 10x fold better at melting... Next is to build a insulated furnace of some kind."
Silverbugs,3bw6dg,arthropal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:58:36 2015 UTC,Use MAPP gas if you don't have enough patience.
Silverbugs,3bw6dg,randombits,2,Thu Jul 2 18:54:11 2015 UTC,"That was going to be my second suggestion, just couldn't remember the term MAPP before.  Thank you /u/randombits."
Silverbugs,3bw6dg,arthropal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"Tried that, too. :)  Granted, only with copper, which melts at the same temp but has different properties that make it harder to melt."
Silverbugs,3bw6dg,randombits,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:58:06 2015 UTC,"Copper takes another 200 degrees or so. Without additional oxygen, that's just out of reach for a torch."

What is an issue is how this problem for the admins was handled; whether or not it was an emergency for the admins, the IAmA mod team were not given warning, and weren't informed of the alternative contact location early enough, which gave them a sizeable logistical problem - one which they took themselves private to deal with.""

Silverbugs,3bycby,QueenRedditSnoo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:21:21 2015 UTC,"Where did it say she was fired?   Why did she leave reddit so abruptly?  The short answer: no-one, excluding a select few of the administrative team, knows precisely why /u/chooter was removed as an admin, and that will almost certainly continue to be the case until the admins get their house in order: both parties are at being professional in that they aren't talking about the reasons why it occurred."
Silverbugs,3bycby,Peterboring,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:24:51 2015 UTC,"I think the bigger issue is that there apparently was no Plan B, in the event something like this happened. It just seems like the admins keep the site running by throwing crap at a dartboard and seeing what sticks."

From what I've read, the mods have valid complaints. This Victoria issue has served as a catalyst to bring the various mods together in a giant scream of anguish directed at the Admins. I think the protest is likely valid.  If our mods chose to join in the protest to Reddit management, I would support that.  Just as Digg provided a big boost to Reddit when it dropped the ball, perhaps we should go bring some life to /v/silverbugs over at voat.com.  The only constant in life is that change is constant."

Silverbugs,3bsvdz,trouble_maker,2,Thu Jul 2 03:47:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to post this.  I read them everyday.  I mentioned Fit Bit... (FIT)... here on 6/22, shortly after the IPO.  It acted as many hyped up IPO's do.  We saw the pull back for a few days after the initial run up to a low on Monday of ~$33.xx.  The past two days have been excellent to a new high of $42.xx.  Q: Buy , hold, or sell?  My gut feeling is there will be profit taking going into the long weekend."
Silverbugs,3bsvdz,d_cruiser,4,Wed Jul 1 23:07:52 2015 UTC,"Currently own it?  Long term or short? =)  Fundamentally?  I look at FitBit like Garmin... there was a craze, but it was killed by Android, Apple and BlackBerry when they included maps and navigation on the phones.  It is an interesting technology, but I don't know if there is space for them in the future, particularly as phones may do more and more of what the fitness bands do.  Then... really think of it as what does FitBit do above and beyond all the other fitness bands?  I heard on CNBC or Bloomberg, they were talking about it and mentioned that more than 2/3 of the people stop using the bands after 3 months.   Another co-host added in that she did not replace her's after her's either broke or lost it.   Now ask yourself this... what percentage of FitBit users.... would be buying a smart watch?  Like Samsung or Apple?  So they do have first mover advantage, and I feel trying to cash in while they can.    For all of those reasons, I would Personally not invest in it.  From a technical perspective..... I don't know... to early.  It did break through the $41.64-76 resistance.  So If I bought it at the IPO or at the lows at $33... I would take some off the table and hold.  30% gains in 2 days would be just enough for me.  Starting a new position?  Not touching it."
Silverbugs,3bsvdz,d_cruiser,2,Wed Jul 1 23:17:33 2015 UTC,"I think your advice is sound.  When I got interested in the stock, I did a bit of research and it backs up your point exactly.  Most users stop using the band after a short time for a variety of reasons.   I have no position in FIT and it bothers me that I had a hunch and didn't act.  Oh, well.  I think they might have a good earnings report whenever that is.  I heard that Target is selling them like crazy."
Silverbugs,3bsvdz,d_cruiser,2,Wed Jul 1 23:30:24 2015 UTC,"Don't hammer yourself.... plenty of people do that already.

Silverbugs,3bu2k2,stack_coin_with_us,6,Thu Jul 2 03:55:37 2015 UTC,"I have never dabbled in cryptocurrencies and I don't see any need to in the future so I'm a metal guy.  I can't say I agree about the liquidity, though.  From the time I decide I want to liquidate some silver to the time the money is in my checking account is less than an hour.  That's certainly liquid enough for me."
Silverbugs,3bu2k2,Ag47baby,4,Thu Jul 2 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you on the liquidity factor of PM's as well.  I had a bit of a financial emergency a little while ago and my silver stack was a life saver.  I was able to sell off a small pile of it, and had the money I needed in less than 24 hours. Now I am still trying to learn about Cryptos, but the volatility of cryptos seems a little too shaky to me right now.  And the fact that they are based off of basically the same idea of FIAT currency makes me a little cautious too.  What exactly are cryptos backed by?  Bits and bytes?  PMs are still a physical store of wealth that I can hold in my hand, so I will continue researching cryptos, but PMs are my primary form of savings."
Silverbugs,3bu2k2,spockdad,2,Thu Jul 2 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"It is a similar idea to fiat insofar as bitcoins can exist purely as a number, but the more I read about it, the more cryptos seem like Rai Stones (really interesting Wiki read that I can't link to on mobile).   Basically, the most important piece is the decentralized ledger. This is something fiat has never had before. While bitcoins don't have physical/industrial value the way silver does, they have specific utility that gives them value over fiat.   I highly recommend reading into it. While I recommend putting more dollars into silver, bitcoin is still worth putting some learning dollars into."
Silverbugs,3bu2k2,HandshakeDrugs99,2,Thu Jul 2 19:13:37 2015 UTC,"Great advice and information. I am very interested in cryptos, so any good information like this is great. Thank you so much."
Silverbugs,3bu2k2,spockdad,2,Fri Jul 3 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"I guess I've always thought of them as backed by the spent work by the bitcoin miners, and the algorithm that guarantees that only a certain number of coins will exist. The downside is obviously that the whole thing depends on electricity and the internet. The upside is that it is much easier to send $10 in BTC to someone in Russia than it is to send $10 in silver.  I'm not holding any crypto right now and I'm holding some silver (lots for my income, not so much compared to some bugs on here), but I find both fascinating."

Silverbugs,3bu2k2,OdeeOh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:50:05 2015 UTC,"In my case, I would just open the safe, take out the silver, drive 10 minutes to my local coin shop, sell it, and use my iPhone from the coin shop to deposit the check into my checking account.  I've done this before and have timed it, just for fun.  Less than an hour from opening the safe to seeing the balance in my checking account.  This assumes you have silver that is readily bought by coin shops.  I'm strictly into bars and Silver Eagles so that works.  If you're trying to sell a Kook Kilo for a good price, you'd need to take a different, slower path."
Silverbugs,3bu2k2,Ag47baby,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:21:56 2015 UTC,I'll have to get more familiar with the shops in my area. Thanks! I see myself taking the same approach (as far as type/make).
Silverbugs,3bu2k2,OdeeOh,0,Wed Jul 8 01:20:40 2015 UTC,"It will always be volatile probably, just like anything.  Here's my theory on cryptos.  It's completely worthless, just worth what someone will pay for it.  But the thing is, it's always going to be around because someone will always be running the client.  Remember ICQ?  People are still running that.  And the coins are supposed to start getting twice as rare next year so if it interests you, just buy fifty or a hundred bucks and tuck it away while you learn about bitcoin."
Silverbugs,3bu2k2,Disabled_gentleman,2,Fri Jul 3 11:56:40 2015 UTC,"I think this is good advice too. It never hurts to put a small amount into cryptos, use them a little and see what you like about them and learn for yourself. We still use fiat, why not use cryptos too. If nothing else than to learn, and possibly to make a little profit."
Silverbugs,3bu2k2,spockdad,2,Fri Jul 3 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"Ag47baby, I've never looked at liquidity that way before, but you're absolutely right. For the vast majority of what I own, I could turn metal into cash pretty damn quickly. Excellent point, well taken !"

For example: If you bought this 1 oz Gold Philharmonic for $1285, which is already a pretty good price, and had a 4x Ebay bucks deal going on, you would get about $102 in Ebay bucks for future purchases. This brings the price down to about $1182 for the coin, PLUS you get to use a Credit Card and earn Cashback on that too! If you used a 1% cashback card, you just bought that 1 oz Phil for UNDER spot. And guess what? It's from Apmex!   Now I know that 1 oz of Gold is a big purchase, but you can get Gold Sovereigns the same way.

They seem to have a bit of a novelty factor in the US, so I don't think that you'd have trouble selling them. Selling a large lot at once might prove more difficult, but if you sell for spot you should find a buyer before too long.  I find them very satisfying to collect and at $220-$250 a pop, getting one each month is quite doable.  They fit perfectly in the coin tubes made for nickels.  By the way, these coins are from the ""Latin Union"" or ""Latin Monetary Union"" and derive their name from this organization. It was a standardization of gold and silver coins across most of Europe. The 20F coin remains the most emblematic coin of the Latin Union."

I would like to have 1 oz coins, but at the rate I can scrounge money from the budget, I'd be buying maybe a couple oz per year, and in the meantime I'd be at the mercy of spot price fluctuations. The fractional stuff lets me get at least some of it in my hands much quicker. The premium I pay over spot is just part of the business."
Silverbugs,3btkca,irongen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:25:09 2015 UTC,"I understand but for me, one of the big benefits of gold over silver is lower premium.  If you buy fractionals, that's nullified."

But if you cannot, or choose not to do so, then fractionals are your ticket. Personally, if I pay an extra $50-75 for, say, the same weight in gold via 20 franc pieces that I would in a gold Eagle, I'm not going to sweat it. I'm holding for the long haul. Either my metals will be trade bait in an extreme scenario, or the price will likely go up as currencies do their long, sad slide into debasement. In either case, possession is more important to me than worrying about paying an extra 2% in premium for fractionals versus larger size bullion pieces."

I've also bought 1 oz. gold CML's at spot thru Scottsdale's and SilverTowne's eBay listings. I can't really say I prefer one over the other; the CML's (and Britannia's) are .9999, and spectacular looking, but you can handle the Roosters and Sovereigns because they're not as soft. Either way, I always look at spot as ""the bar"". I refuse to pay more than a couple % over, and I just wait until the right deal comes along.

Silverbugs,3bt5xs,priuspilot,6,Wed Jul 1 23:01:09 2015 UTC,I think I will buy an ebay gift card so I can use that on any later deal.
Silverbugs,3bt5xs,User313,3,Thu Jul 2 02:22:55 2015 UTC,I'm debating on using it to soften the blow on a 10 oz kookaburra I've had my eye on or else just wait and see if they do a discounted gift card or the sort this next month and move it into that.   Normally they do not offer any ebucks back for the month they disperse them so it will most likely be a slow month on earning new ones.
Silverbugs,3bt5xs,Herms989,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:13:42 2015 UTC,10 ounce kookaburras are awesome! I have two and they were worth the money!

Silverbugs,3bt5xs,shinsmax12,2,Thu Jul 2 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"Gift card sounds like a smart idea, rather than letting them expire. Plus, you can wait as long as necessary for the right deal, or for a drop in spot."

Silverbugs,3bt5xs,duncanbishop24,2,Thu Jul 2 05:16:35 2015 UTC,You have to earn $5.00 or more during the quarter.

Silverbugs,3bt5xs,duncanbishop24,2,Thu Jul 2 11:02:47 2015 UTC,Correct.  If you earn less than $5 in ebay bucks they will disappear and you have to start over the following period.  So $4.99 you lose it all...$5.00 you get to spend it.    http://pages.ebay.com/rewards/faq.html

It's still not a bad price, but not as awesome as it sounded at first. $3.10 over per ounce is still pretty damn good. I'd buy all the not-current-year ones.

Silverbugs,3brwex,Gordopolis,2,Wed Jul 1 17:30:03 2015 UTC,"War nickels @ $.80 each and 40% halves @ $46/roll if you really want them, but I'd pass on those, personally.  Melt value on Canadian junk is 9.3x FV currently. My offer would depend entirely on the composition of the lot. For quarters and dimes, I'd expect a fair retail value to be in the 10.5-11x FV range, but if it's mostly halves, 12x would be reasonable. If there are lots of dollars or lots of uncirculated/PL or old (pre-1937) coins, even higher. Also, be careful here - I've rarely if ever bought a lot advertised as ""Canadian 80%"" that was entirely 80%. There's usually sterling and 50% mixed in there - people get purities of Canadian stuff mixed up all the time.   I'd go take a look at it - if it's all sterling halves and dollars, give the man his $270 and laugh all the way to the bank. If it's all Elizabeth II quarters and dimes, I'd offer spot."

Silverbugs,3btgqj,spockdad,4,Thu Jul 2 13:49:12 2015 UTC,6 minutes too long to listen to this guy bitch more.  Nothing seems to ever go right for him.  He should just bow out of the stacking game if nothing ever goes right for him.
Silverbugs,3btgqj,spockdad,0,Thu Jul 2 14:20:24 2015 UTC,"Nothing seems to ever go right for him   I don't see how you can say that. What do you know about the guy?  He's had the recent bad APMEX/USPS stolen and now a USPS misdelivering to a PO Box.  He has a lot of videos up so it seems a lot has gone right for him.  I found him via his APMEX story and I'm glad I did. He's bringing to light and reenforcing what we should all be cognizant of when buying/selling non-locally.  I felt for him in regards to the APMEX scenario.  The latest issue I don't feel so bad for him, though, as I outlined his two mistakes (at least IMO) in my OP up top.  I still think hjis experience is worth sharing here. I'm surprised so many seem to be brushing it off as he's just a whiny bitch.  I'm curious how you would handle the situations he's had. You wouldn't reach out to the stacking community in some venue?"
Silverbugs,3btgqj,e30kgk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"As I said with a previous comment, I was totally backing this guy when I first heard of his experience with APMEX.  I still think APMEX should have handled that situation differently.  And I should have prefaced that statement by adding 'recently' to the end of that sentence. As far as how I would handle the situations he has had... You had laid out his mistakes very clearly in your response to his video, which i completely agree with, but I honestly think if I would have as many problems with obtaining silver as he had, I would either stop stacking all together, or just buy locally.  It sounds like his local USPS is the ultimate problem for him, but by making these bitch-fest YouTube videos, he seems now to be more of a ""view hog"".  In that, he found out that bitching about APMEX got him a lot of views, and he is hoping the trend continues by starting a bitch-fest on USPS. After this one, I am done watching this guys videos."

Silverbugs,3boi48,SpaceTire,3,Wed Jul 1 13:53:46 2015 UTC,Its so pretty.  Its a fact that humans are preprogramed to be naturally attracted to gold.   It is our purpose in the universe to be seeded on Earth and mine all Earth's gold for centuries and to refine it and bring it to central locations in mass quantities for when our masters return. They shall take it.
Silverbugs,3boi48,JarretGax,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:31:51 2015 UTC,intresting.. tell me more
Silverbugs,3boi48,SpaceTire,-2,Wed Jul 1 06:35:27 2015 UTC,"I obviously don't have all the details, but basically there was an alien race on a planet(we'll call it planet x) between mars and jupiter. The alien race screwed up the planet beyond repair. They needed gold for the atmosphere. So they would send missionary voyages to earth to collect gold. back and forth. Humans are the genetic slave versions of themselves. But Since they didn't know which humans would be best long term, they put several hominids on the planet. Homo erectus, neanderthals, and a few others.   Long story short, Planet x ends up getting destroyed, thats where we got our moon from and why there is an asteroid belt in between mars and jupiter. Right before the planet x was destroyed the Aliens decided to take off and find a new home planet. They said not to forget them and they will be back. Even though they no longer need the gold for the atmosphere of planet x(cuz it got destroyed), I guess they left that part in our DNA.     Now with our Gods gone, anarchy went cray cray and the more aggressive and warish Homo-sapiens(Humans like you and me) eventually ended up killing off all the other great species of hominids. I think it would be cool to have hung out with The Giants of North America.   So the aliens, whom we were created in their image, left earth and our solar system good bye and now here we are. Mining Gold, putting it in fort knox. Letting the peasants have their trinkets as long as the mass storage vaults are filled by time they get back with their 2nd coming.   I believe they already had their 1st coming back. After they left, they came back the first time and saw how the homosapiens had killed all its sister species and they were really really upset about how out of control everything had gotten. And if I remember right, the story of Noah and his ark was when the aliens destroyed the icebergs with intense fire weapons and basically tried to drown the earth and wipe out most of humanity. Start fresh.   Sorry if I dont have all the details, its been a while since I've read about this stuff."

Silverbugs,3boklk,Spence97,4,Tue Jun 30 21:47:57 2015 UTC,"Got my first gold coin that I don't have to resell in the mail yesterday.  Ebay bucks brought it down to about $280 or pretty much spot price!  Was looking at a gold Indian but man the premium on those things seems so much higher, and I couldn't pass up pre-33 gold for spot.  Unfortunately, what this is doing is making me want a $10 gold piece, as well.  Time to start saving again!"
Silverbugs,3boklk,agbugger,2,Tue Jun 30 21:53:15 2015 UTC,"Ebay bucks brought it down    Mind saying who you bought it from? I'm scared to buy PMs on eBay unless they're from major retailers, but I do have some of the bucks to spend..."
Silverbugs,3boklk,agbugger,2,Wed Jul 1 01:53:34 2015 UTC,"Oh believe me I'm scared too!  Haha got burned with a gold sovereign a while back and posted all about it here. Shitty seller who wouldn't give me my money back and seemed to have a little mental disconnect because he kept repeating the same thing even though the coin he sold me was a fake because no coins were struck with that year/mintmark.   (/rant)  Every purchase of gold on eBay is a gamble but I risk it because every time the seller screws up eBay gives me my $$ back.  eBay is more buyer friendly than seller friendly in my experiences, but that's just personal experiences again.  I'm sure that buyers get burned all the time.  It's not a huge risk if you are smart about it.  Look for sellers with a return policy and good feedback.  That should prevent most issues.  I still wouldn't recommend buying from people that have never sold a coin before, but it's the buyer's call.  Maybe do as I say rather than as I do lol.  To answer the question about the seller, it looks like the only coin he's ever sold, but he had a return policy and good feedback so I jumped for it at such a good price.  Even if it had been a fake eBay would have forced him to accept the return since he specified a policy, no questions asked.  Shipped insured and with signature required, too.  Name was 1976sdc and there were no problems whatsoever.  Very nice guy and great communication.  LCS guys checked the coin out and it was all good when I went to buy the airtite.  They checked its weight and size with calipers and it was all good.  If you wanted to buy some cheap gold with your ebay bucks I'd recommend a gold sovereign from APMEX ($300 for about 1/4 ounce.. similar to what I got) or some other european gold since it's at such a low premium.  Something like a Swiss or French 20 Franc coin, and you could basically pick which design you like better since they're both the same gold content and premium usually.  Also, you can get gold half eagles like mine from major retailers for about $350-360 I believe, but that was a bit steep for me.    What were you looking for specifically? Or don't you know yet :D"
Silverbugs,3boklk,silverdollars,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:55:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed response. It's reassuring to know eBay would be on my side if I got a fake. Partly I'm afraid that I'm just not equipped to tell the difference, but it sounds like my LCS can be of help for that.   Now that I've seen yours I really l like the half eagle :) but I hadn't made plans to get anything specific yet. APMEX on eBay is good advice too!"
Silverbugs,3boklk,Snakehand,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:24:15 2015 UTC,"No problem and I agree that telling the difference is tough.  A good LCS can be your one stop shop for almost anything including this especially if you're a paying customer!  And APMEX is also cool because they usually beat their own site's CC/Paypal rates, oddly enough, because I think they don't take the 3% hit from the CC companies, just the limited eBay fees which have to be tiny when selling on that scale.  Just a guess though all that matters to me is a lower price!"

Also FYI the intrinsic value of small cents has never been near face value, at least until recent years - which is why we have zinc cents now.   you can make comparisons with a lot of other commodities (e.g. Silver), but gold still comes out looking more valuable now, then in the 1910s"

Silverbugs,3bn4uz,maksimfa,2,Tue Jun 30 23:39:35 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen the price of gold and silver trades off fear.    For example in the 1990s into the tech bubble of the late 90s, gold was at one of its lowest prices since Nixon decided to leave the gold standard in 73.  I would attribute the low prices to a mostly pieceful world, and investor interest in tech stocks pulling money away from gold/silver.  In 2000 tech stocks crashed followed by the shock and fear 9/11/01 then two wars (Iraq, Afghanistan), the 2005 London bombing, a falling U.S. Dollar, rising oil prices, China's rise, and a financial crisis starting in 2007. Golds rise from $300 to 1000 started during a period of rising interest rates from 04-07.  In my opinion gold/silver trade off fear, and that is why to me precious metals are treated as an insurance policy (or something fun to collect) and not an investment.

The provident order has been stuck in Texas usps for 5 days...and that seems to happen every time I order from provident.

If I wanted to wait I would send a check. You have no idea what the customer is planning to do with his product. Maybe he has a show to go to who knows.

Typically I dismiss many videos like this as they are extremely biased.  However I do use it as an opportunity to question my own beliefs.  For any videos you have to ask yourself, what is in their interest?  Considering he is a CEO of a Silver Mining company and makes his living off of silver, he needs the price to go up and as such, he pumps it.  Considering his company has lost more than 54% of its value in the last year alone.... I can see him being so outspoken.  80% loss over the last 5 years..... oooops.  I hope no one here invested in it.  For people like that, as very common in penny stocks, CEO's will blame everything but themselves for the loss of value, particularly when they UNDERperform their competitors and peers."
Silverbugs,3bkig0,luthervillian,2,Tue Jun 30 18:41:54 2015 UTC,"Unless im mistaken, all PMs companies had lower revenues over the past few yrs and his company is no different. He's just been the only outspoken CEO to stand up and say something. As long as powerful entities have control over silver and gold via the paper markets then the price of PMs will always be suppressed one way or the other. It doesn't matter anyway. I truly believe that he'll go local and ask other mexican based silver mining companies to join along with him and hold back their mined silver from the markets. I think that he'll be able to convince others to join together with him as this situation with Greece/EU crumbles as well as the Chinese stock markets crashing. Once that happens, it'll fuck up the silver paper shortys and allow silver to finally sky rocket. Im also expecting for china to announce(once their markets crash hard) that their gov has stockpiled 10,000 tons of gold minimum(i believe its actually closer to about 20,000 - 30,000 tons). Once they come out with their #, then gold too will double overnight(or within a few weeks at the latest)."

The manufacturing numbers out of China indicate a general slowdown.  Bloomberg recently reported surges in silver stockpiles: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-17/china-silver-stockpiles-surge-as-demand-wanes-on-slowing-economy.

If you open several disputes with eBay over the corse of a year they will deactivate your account. When sellers did accept returns I still had to pay for shipping and tracking, in the end I was spending $6-7 in postage and time per item that was fake just to return it. Even worse when an item is fake and a seller does not know, they accuse you of trying to rip them off... it seriously is not worth it."

Silverbugs,3bkmwz,blevdawgAg47,8,Tue Jun 30 00:27:47 2015 UTC,"There is a fixed amount of silver on this earth.  A non-trivial portion of the easiest to retrieve silver has already been mined, and some fraction of that has been lost to waste.  To state the obvious:  An ounce of silver cannot be created without effort and cost, and there is finite amount of it.  Silver is a historical store of wealth as well as a commodity that is used in nearly every electronic device.  When you buy an ounce of physical silver, you hold something that is in finite supply and cannot be easily produced/duplicated.  A paper receipt on the other hand is a claim for an amount of physical silver.  Many of these paper receipts allow multiple receipts to be written against the physical silver(!), because rarely do all the receipt owners ask for all their physical silver all at once.  The details on the receipt say if physical delivery of the silver isn't possible for whatever reason, you'll be given the fiat currency equivalent for that amount of silver.  It could be argued that the above receipt is an acceptable equivalent (financially) to physical silver, until there is a shortage in the availability of physical silver.  Develop your own scenarios for that - shortage of supply, increased demand, confidence in the local currency, etc.  Any of these events could cause a ""run"" on the physical silver the many receipts against one piece of silver will mean many receipt owners will not get physical possession of the silver.  This article suggests there is a 250:1 paper to physical silver ratio as of last year: https://www.goldbroker.com/news/paper-silver-market-250-times-size-physical-silver-market-526"
Silverbugs,3bkmwz,luthervillian,2,Tue Jun 30 01:45:02 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  So basically, when I read articles on ZeroHedge about silver manipulation and the banking cabal being corrupt... what ""the powers that be"" are trying to do now is keep this system held together as long as possible, because once people lose faith in paper silver, the banks lose lots of $$$ quickly and the price of physical silver potentially skyrockets?  If this is the case, what drives the banks to keep making the problem worse?  Wouldn't they see that they are going to lose their shirts on this and start retreating from this market?"
Silverbugs,3bkmwz,luthervillian,4,Tue Jun 30 02:09:28 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert on this subject, and would refer you to the excellent work done by Andrew Hoffman at Miles Franklin, who has written volumes on the subject of gold price manipulation.  Here's the general narrative subject to my interpretation:  The ""powers that be"" (drop any conspiracy theories here; I'm talking known entities like the central banks around the world and the proxies that openly work with them) have a desire for currency stability/control, and part of that control they understand the need to control the price of gold in the currency in question (let's say dollars).  All fiat currencies are backed by nothing but confidence, and so job #1 times a thousand is keeping confidence high in your currency.  A rising gold price in the currency you're protecting is a threat to that stability.  Thus, as central bank, you need to suppress the price of gold in your currency to keep confidence high in your currency.  Paper metals allow for easy manipulation by dropping massive sell orders on metal you don't even own to drive down the price."
Silverbugs,3bkmwz,mushroomlab,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:23:52 2015 UTC,This is very interesting. Thanks for explaining. How does this relate to the price of silver (compared to gold being controlled)? Do they directly correlate?
Silverbugs,3bkmwz,luthervillian,2,Tue Jun 30 02:46:40 2015 UTC,"Silver is far more of a commodity (some say the #2 commodity after oil) compared to gold, and so there are more factors driving the price of silver.  David Morgan puts himself out there as an expert in silver and usually has much to say on the subject - google his stuff or check out the new book he just released.  I would argue that you shouldn't get too hung up on if/why silver prices are manipulated...you're not going change things if they are, and most people don't want to hear about it / will dismiss you as a conspiracy theorist.  Like the LIBOR rigging scandal, everyone denies it until the truth comes out.  Instead, assuming you have money you want to put towards the purchase of precious metals, I'd argue you have to do your homework and decide what you believe is the average cost of production for an ounce of silver/gold.  Many out there would argue that number is ~$17 for silver, and ~$1200 for gold, with a TON of variation (or to get geeky a standard deviation around $5-6 bucks).  The point being you need to decide what price makes sense to you as a ""bargain"" price (or ""buy signal"") that affords you an opportunity to buy below the average cost of production.   Unless some new technology appears to lower production costs, simple math suggests no commodity can sell for below the cost of production for very long without exhausting supply.  And if supply is exhausted, assuming no substitutes exist, demand will drive the price up above cost of production to satisfy demand.  At least that's what ECON 101 would say.  YMMV."
Silverbugs,3bkmwz,johnrgrace,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:52:19 2015 UTC,The thing is can you actually get multiple deposit receipts for the same physical silver?  Until I see someone actually do this I'm very doubtful that it can be done.  People take that this can be done on faith.    Plus if there is ever a delivery failure prices are going to spike a LOT
Silverbugs,3bkmwz,bulksalty,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:29:38 2015 UTC,"Well a good example is silver futures, which like all futures never ever deliver (there needs to be a delivery option to keep everyone honest, but almost no one ever exercises it--they just buy an offsetting position).  Just for the grins, there is an open interest for 688,505,000 ounces of silver for September delivery, but none remaining for June (no silver changed hands via the futures market).  Thus, it's likely that there is far less than 688,505,000 ounces of silver held by anyone trading in the futures market."

Silverbugs,3bkmwz,maksimfa,5,Tue Jun 30 02:46:13 2015 UTC,"Can you explain to me why you think the silver market is rigged? Have you seen the proof yourself?   Can the markets be ""influenced"" in the short term?  Absolutely.... but they are rigged?  No, not at all.  I will try to address this from a few angles that can lead to separate discussions.   Ok, let's get the 800 lb gorilla out of the room.  If you believe that the only thing in life that matters is physical silver and gold, because you can't trust banks, depositories, the markets or the USD and other currencies..... then in that case, yes... keep on stack and stop reading right here... there is no way to convince you and I completely respect that.    Most people who fall into that camp do not care about selling, paying rediculous commissions (premiums), the costs and logistics involved, or care for storing that much metal in their home.  As such... yes, nothing beats holding it... and the posters comment here .... ""If you don't hold it...."" applies.  In any other case... paper silver, done right, is a far better choice for most people.  Rigged Market - If anything... the physical metal markets is rigged.  When I buy a share of a Silver ETF trust, representing aproximately 1 oz, I pay a ""premium"" of as little as a few cents per share.   The market is quite liquid.  Now, if I go to a local coin store, my dealer can charge whatever they want to charge for metals, they often include heavy premiums to buy, and I will be lucky to get SPOT when I sell.   In a rural area, your only choice may be one local coin store charging $5 over spot for basic eagles, or ordering online, minimum $100 or else you are paying shipping.  Some states have taxes, additional fees for credit cards.  Market price for initially ""paper"" silver is always liquid and transparent.  You will always buy and sell within a few cents of spot price.   YES... if you place a $10,000,000 order, you will move the market temporarily.  I will close out the ""rigged"" market discussion with the following.  There was a quote by JP Morgan along the lines of someone asking him what he thinks the market should do.  His response is... he does not care.  Where they make money is on the transaction side of the table, earning the transaction commission.  Banks are very much getting out of the investing side of it as that is how they got hurt in 2008.  Dodd Frank is forcing them to divest the investment banking divisions.  Paper Price vs Physical.  The price you pay for the physical metal is based on the world commodities markets.  They are in essence options contract where you have the right to have delivery of those oz of metals at the end of the month/contract period.   Other silver investments are based off of those commodity contract prices.   Let's dive in a tad deeper...  Is ""Paper"" really ""Paper""?  Some but not all.  Commodity contracts are paper, however they are closed out and convertible into physical on demand.  Silver ETF - Yes, this is paper as it trades... however you have to look deeper.  If it is an ETN... it is just a paper obligation following silver, but not backed by it.  These would be like the levergaged notes and other ETN's.  ETF's are indeed backed by REAL silver, in a storage vault.  To me... this is ""physical"" enough.  If you don't believe it exists, well, then you belong to the club above and should also take out all of your cash from banks, request physical stock certificates, bond certificates and turn off cell phones. =)  The price is whatever someone is willing to pay.  The commodity markets are quite liquid and transparent.  Other reasons to own ""paper that either converts or is backed by physical"" silver. 1.  Save on gas, postage, storage, safe, and sanity fees.  2.  Make metals work for you... (you can borrow against it, you can monetize it with options). 3. I can get in and out at a moments notice, with a click of a button, in a variety of currencies, in a variety of accounts.    How to use it?  Well... this all falls to you. Personally... I own a few hundred oz of silver in physical, much of which is in collectibile numismatic, never bullion, that I can flip.    Example... Australian Lunars, Chinese Panda.  You can buy large size at a very low premium, compariable to high end bullion bars, and they will keep value due to collectible premiums.  My goal is to sell one, keep one.  The rest of my silver exposure, be it long or short is through paper investments which I can trade, to take advantage of major swings."
Silverbugs,3bkmwz,jayrad01,2,Tue Jun 30 04:04:44 2015 UTC,"Wow I wish I would have read this a month ago. I bought about 350 oz in the past month and I'm always thinking when it's time to  sell it how am I going to do it. Will I have to piece it out and it will take God knows how long to get rid of it and how many different premiums when I could have bought etfs cheaper which means more silver and sold it with a mouse click at whatever price point and amounts I feel like. Thanks for the schooling maksimfa. I think now I may start buying some etfs from now on.

Silverbugs,3bkmwz,Chilton1776,2,Wed Jul 1 20:26:20 2015 UTC,"In theory all paper silver represents the equivalent amount of real silver. When paper silver comes due the people that buy paper silver just take the profit/loss on paper instead of taking deliver of the physical metal. These buyers are just looking to capture the move in the price of silver, and most are not interested in holding the metal.  A lot of people with financial backgrounds believe the amount of paper silver is far greater than the physical silver it can theoretically be redeemed for. If everyone with paper silver asked for physical delivery of silver when the contract was due, it would become obvious there is more paper silver and the price of silver would quickly appreciate to compensate for supply vs. demand."

But sometimes I want to see what they have, older pandas, maples, prospectors, or just in the mood for some interesting looking generics.  Just dont want to pay a premium for that Silver if there is a good chance they bought it for 20 cents over spot.  I dont think alot of LCS are putting out their silver recently from 3 years ago, unless they are in a hard place and need to liquidate."

Silverbugs,3biztp,iop90-,4,Mon Jun 29 16:51:12 2015 UTC,"$22-$23 CAD is pretty much what you can expect to pay from a vendor for Maples. Buffaloes are around $21 CAD.   I have been primarily using Silver Gold Bull since the beginning of the year. They seem to have the largest selection out of the Canadian vendors.   They tend to run a special once a month or so where you can get free shipping. Last month was add a 2oz Privateer to your order, most other months is spend $500 for free shipping.  I signed up for the Long Term Buy program at the beginning of the year. Basically you pay full price for S&H for your initial order and then you only pay $2.84 per additional order for up to 6 months. It's a great way to get practically free shipping on all your orders as long as you don't mind waiting for delivery. If you use one of their free shipping specials for the initial LTB purchase you can enter the program for free. It's perfect if you make smaller and/or frequent purchases."
Silverbugs,3biztp,Peterboring,2,Mon Jun 29 17:23:17 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! I completely forgot the CDN/USD ratio is horrid which explains the large gap from spot to Maples.

Silverbugs,3biztp,fletcpollo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:54:24 2015 UTC,"+1 For Silver Gold Bull's long term buy program. It's the best way to consolidate smaller purchases over 6 months to save on shipping. I've used Toronto Gold Bullion as well to pick up some E=MC2 privy maples, but if you don't hit the minimum shipping thresholds you're looking at paying $20-25 for shipping each time you order which will increase your $/oz."
Silverbugs,3bikgg,Stinkfist46and2,4,Mon Jun 29 14:54:06 2015 UTC,Lots of places to get silver at .69 or .79 over spot.  You just have to be willing to accept those nasty buffalo rounds or 10 ozt bars.  Goverment coins are almost always going to be at least $3.00 over spot.

Right now, the Euro is actually up for the day against the dollar, but meanwhile.... metals have been selling off.   Also, the link between market and metals are fairly low. Metals are more correlated to the strength of the economy as a whole, rather than stock prices.  The one time there is a correlation is if there is a major sell off and people buy metals for safety.

Silverbugs,3bhadj,Energy_Turtle,3,Mon Jun 29 20:31:53 2015 UTC,Got a new car. Decided against a mazda 6 because they're harder to work on. Ended up  getting a Ford Fusion SE with black rims. Looks like a poor mans Aston Martin.
Silverbugs,3bhadj,MothaChicken,3,Mon Jun 29 05:41:03 2015 UTC,Nice! Is the mazda 6 harder to work on be cuz of the skyactiv engine?
Silverbugs,3bhadj,silverlitecoin,3,Mon Jun 29 15:58:06 2015 UTC,"The dealer said the car was difficult to find parts for around here, as they are all imports. I bet the skyactiv has a lot to do with it, but I wouldn't know."
Silverbugs,3bhadj,MothaChicken,2,Mon Jun 29 16:52:15 2015 UTC,"If anyone tells you a major brand of cars (vw, Subaru, Mazda) are hard to get parts for then they're trying to sell you some other brand for a reason. They're mostly manufactured in plants in Canada or the U.S. While fords and gms are usually made in Mexico.  Also you can order iPhone cables from China for $1 with free shipping. Telling me I can't get a Mazda wheel bearing because they're a Japanese brand?  Geddouttahere."
Silverbugs,3bhadj,arthropal,2,Tue Jun 30 00:10:29 2015 UTC,"Oh, also, the Ford Fusion WAS the Mazda 6 until 2012.  Same platform, same parts.  The Mazda CX-9 is still the Ford Fusion platform."
Silverbugs,3bhadj,arthropal,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:19:04 2015 UTC,"That's exactly what the dodge dealership told us. ""It's very difficult to find parts for imports""...regardless, I like my car. The lawnmower engine was a turn off for the mazda."
Silverbugs,3bhadj,MothaChicken,2,Tue Jun 30 00:19:28 2015 UTC,"That's hilarious.  Half of Chysler's line is european imports now.  It's a line.  I'm a backyard mechanic who's worked exclusively on Subarus for 5 years (supposedly the devil to get parts for and hard to work on).  They're so easy to work on if you don't bring inline four mentality to the table.  Also, parts are dirty cheap from most retailers, even the dealer lots of the time.  Anything that's likely to be needed the dealer and car part shops have in stock, and anything weird that might break you can get in under a week, and chances are a Dodge dealer wouldn't have that part on hand either.  You're happy and that's what matters. I bet if you'd looked around you'd have found a Mazda 6 with the same engine you currently have.  Mazdas and Ford shares a lot, if not all, of their engine and vehicle platforms.  Same as Mitsubishi and Dodge.  Even GM and Honda have done some engine platform trading.  Everything is an import and everything is domestic these days."

Silverbugs,3bhadj,MothaChicken,2,Tue Jun 30 00:36:12 2015 UTC,Cool. I'm not arguing that.  Just saying for anyone else who might get that line from a dealer.  Dodge's lineup is almost entirely made up of Japanese and German designed and manufactured cars at this point.  For a dealer to say an import is hard to work on is a slap in their own face.  Individual models are easier or harder to work on.  My wife's Ford Escape is a horrific monstrosity of Mazda and Ford incestuous spawn with everything inside of every other thing.  My 2007 Kia Rio5 I could fix with a hammer and dental floss.
Silverbugs,3bhadj,arthropal,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:41:31 2015 UTC,"My Cadillac SRX was exactly like your description of your wife's escape. I hope I don't have to touch the fusion, as it has a lifetime power train warranty. The dealership won't let me do my own oil changes or it voids the warranty...and my dad just taught me how..."
Silverbugs,3bhadj,MothaChicken,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:59:04 2015 UTC,"I got over doing my own oil changes.  You don't have to get them done at the dealer, btw.  Nothing in the agreement states third party work will void warranty.  The $25 it costs for local mechanics to do oil changes beats the $15 for oil+filter+labour+figuring out what to do with used oil of doing it myself."

Silverbugs,3bhadj,maksimfa,2,Mon Jun 29 18:25:27 2015 UTC,"It was hard, but the mazda 6 engine sounded like a lawnmower, so that was the deciding factor."
Silverbugs,3bhadj,MothaChicken,0,Mon Jun 29 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"yes.... yes it does indeed.  The only thing I did not like about the new 6 is the engine.  I really wish it came with a turbo 4 or a v6.  Just a bit more ooompth.   Although a base 4 banger will likely be far longer lasting.  As a parent, the other thing that may be appreciated, the Mazda 6 allows you to share the inboard tethers/latches for the middle car seat."
Silverbugs,3bhadj,maksimfa,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:36:34 2015 UTC,The Fusion is a nice car. I got mine November of last year. So far it has been a fantastic car that looks and drives nice. I think you will be pleased with your choice.

I collect some rare coins already, but really want to take advantage of the low price of silver. Can people offer some suggestions on where I should look to get the best deals/values when it comes to purchasing silver?   I specifically would like to spend a couple hundred dollars at a time and probably stack in 1-5 oz denominations. Sure, I love the cool designs as well as the next person, but I'm mostly seeking value right now. Do cool coins sell/trade at a higher value during crisis than others?"
Silverbugs,3bhadj,MonkeyLuven,3,Mon Jun 29 16:12:39 2015 UTC,"/r/pmsforsale - GENERALLY better prices than most places online. Welcome to the community!  As far as premiums, I can't speak for that as I've only really been stacking for 9 months."
Silverbugs,3bhadj,Cancer-Cheater,2,Mon Jun 29 17:16:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'm not really certain how to know if I got a good deal or not since all I can go by thus far is the market price of silver. Having reputable places to start though is wonderfully helpful! I've also seen much about APMEX, but that just left me with more questions."
Silverbugs,3bhadj,MonkeyLuven,3,Mon Jun 29 17:44:27 2015 UTC,"To get an idea of what something is worth, compare a few prices from our trusted online dealers, like APMEX, Provident, JMBullion, Shinybars. There generally will  only  be a small spread, but you can trust  any of these and go with the cheapest at the moment you buy. At any given time, almost all of the online dealers will have one good price that the others aren't matching at the moment. These are generally on generic rounds or bars, (but not always) and they'll offer a discount from their regular premium of about a dollar an ounce over spot to $.69 or $.79 an ounce over spot.  Some of the best deals to be had are weekend eBay sales run by companies like APMEX, Modern Coin Mart and Wholesale Coins Direct. These are generally the only eBay silver sales worth considering. Generally, these sales are going to cost you at least a couple hundred bucks, as most are things like 10 ASEs at a good price. Often though, the sales are for entire tubes of coins, and you would need to have $400-500 on hand to avail yourself.  Watch the board here for notices of who has what on sale where."

As long as you are not buying junk or generic rounds, the coins will hold their value a bit better.  If you are buying limited lunars for instance, it will be a lot easier to recoupe money. If you are buying more than 100 oz, then HEDGE.  And disregard anyone who claims it is a gift to buy silver under a certain price, or even the opposite thinking it will go down to $2... although you will not find many of those people here.  The reality is, no one knows where silver will be in 15 years, let alone 15 months with any type of guarantee.   Personally, I think we will hit $12 to $14 before we hit $20... and if we do over the next 5 to 10 years, it will be because of a major economic collapse somewhere.  Buy as much as you can comfortably do...  and disregard anyone with their own agenda (ie dealers who need to sell, people who are freaking you out so you buy their books, etc. )  At the end of the day, if you won't be able to tolerate silver going down to say $8 an oz, you should not be buying it here in the first place. .... or just consider it an ""expense"""

I myself would have guessed the kilos were minted in less numbers also. I was looking up the mintages today when I bought the 10 oz Goat and noticed it. Lunar Mintage numbers"
Silverbugs,3bf2sr,BIGGERCat,0,Sun Jun 28 22:41:26 2015 UTC,Huh. I believe both are minted as requested/required. This would tell me that more kilos are in demand than 10oz'ers
Silverbugs,3bf2sr,jerrsun,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:15:39 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that with silver or any other pms to each there own. I am a collector first and a stacker second. 90% of the things I own are things I personally like. The other 10% were things I couldn't pass on because I got them so close or at spot. If someone asks my opinion on buying a kilo coin I tell them to go for it if its something they want. At worst in the end if they ever sell it, they will at least get spot for it and anything extra is just a bonus."
Silverbugs,3bf2sr,catandmouse663,0,Sun Jun 28 20:33:10 2015 UTC,I was disagreeing with your statement that it can be difficult to retain the premium (less than $2/oz) on lunar kilos. Historically the collectibility premium is strong. You can still get $40-50/oz for 2010 tigers for example.
Silverbugs,3bf2sr,catandmouse663,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:03:22 2015 UTC,Yes every coin is different in what it will do in the future. I am sure the tiger and dragon will always out perform the goat or horse. My point was that it is easier to find buyers for 10 oz coins over kilos. I was also talking more about buying a kilo and then selling it sooner rather then later. We don't know the future and these lunars could all end up selling along the same lines as a kook or koala. If the future price of an item was guaranteed we all would be buying the same exact thing. I just hope the Chinese don't screw these up like they already have done for the pandas.
Silverbugs,3bf2sr,catandmouse663,0,Sun Jun 28 21:27:05 2015 UTC,Again my biggest complaint was you saying it can be difficult to retain premiums with lunar kilos. It's just has not true. What makes you say that?
Silverbugs,3bf2sr,eightsecond,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"I went back through the thread and tried to find what statement you were talking about and i found it:   Kilo coins are to hard to move and recoup premium on.   I was only saying they are harder to sell. The bigger the coin the less potential buyers you have. If you cant sell it, then yes you cant recoup the premium. I should have worded it differently I guess :D  Here you go:  Kilo coins are to hard to move and therefor harder to recoup premium on."

Silverbugs,3bemf2,ribnag,3,Sun Jun 28 15:25:18 2015 UTC,The sand dunes has a mintage of 12K less. Would you not be better off buying that than a better looking but higher mintage coin?

Is there a denomination of USD which looks like this but is made of a different metal today (e.g. zinc)? This seems to have happened a few times before on Silverbugs, so I'm curious."
Silverbugs,3bcaao,JWson,3,Sat Jun 27 22:16:23 2015 UTC,"When we switched from silver to copper-nickel clad copper in the mid 1960s, the designs of the coins weren't changed, only the composition. This design is still in circulation, and the occasional silver one slips in, although it's rarely as nice looking as OP's."
Silverbugs,3bcaao,TheBandersnatch43,3,Sat Jun 27 22:20:24 2015 UTC,Both the quarter (this coin) and the ten-cent dime (smaller with FD Roosevelt on it) were 90% silver through 1964. In 1965 we changed them to cupronickel-plated copper (so very similar color but 92% copper). Remaining silver coins are extremely rare in change now.  Zinc is in the post-1981 pennies (copper plated with Lincoln on it).

Silverbugs,3bcaao,NShoreFisher,3,Sun Jun 28 02:11:17 2015 UTC,"one time there was this post on reddit about this guy who was left a big bottle of change (I think from his dad who passed away)  He was going to go to coinstar but a bunch of people told him that the older coins were worth a lot more money. It ended up being a huge amount.   Ever since then I separate out my old change. I should probably read up more about it but being a single mom and working two jobs I don't have a lot of time.  I never realized we had quarters that were silver, I thought they were all some other metal. i knew that the old pennies had more copper in them."
Silverbugs,3bcaao,philosoptical,3,Sun Jun 28 04:32:30 2015 UTC,Once you learn to spot them in your change you'll do it on instinct.  A silver quarter will shine on the sides and won't have any visible copper.  It's easier to spot them in a stack of coins.

I asked to see the $7 bags and realized there was $6 FV per bag. I spent some time chatting up the clerk that was helping me and rummaging through the other garbage they were selling, trying to make it look like I was kind of clueless.   After it was all said and done, I was sitting at $26 for the four bags. I asked if the prices were negotiable, the girl said they were to a certain extent. I said ok, can we do all of this for $24?  She said she would have to ask her manager, I was worried that I got too greedy and that the manager might realize that they were selling silver for ridiculously cheap.

Money talks and it doesn't matter whos money it is :)   All are from 1989 so I'm going to profit   The seller is trying to say,"" I know these are worth way more but I am willing to sell cheap because I bought these in 1989 when they were cheap."" It would be no different to see an add selling an ounce of gold for $500 and the seller saying,""no biggie I bought it for $250 30 years ago."

Decent analogy with the gold, but I think that's a little fishier - with gold there's a pretty solid price floor at melt value or maybe 5% back, but there's no really good dividing line of good deal/trap when it comes to numismatic pieces. All the other red flags aside, the only price in there that really stands out as completely too-good-to-be-true is the 93S.

This bar is a real beauty, wonderful luster, and a great texture. a fine example of a fondle piece, you can really feel the weight of the sliver and everything that one loves about silver. This item is highly recommended for people in an area where brass knuckles are deemed illegal, hold this in your hand for that extra weight for a punch, or let the bottom stick out just a bit for that extra skull cracking power. the finish is very easy to maintain so cleaning the blood off after use is as easy as wiping down a pistol for fingerprints. The price is very reasonable and if you needed to use this as a projectile weapon you wouldn't cry if you lost it, or got a ding from hitting a person in the sternum. all and all i give this bar a 99-100"

The 1891 is the only coin of the lot I'd actually be interested in, personally - I'd offer $70 on it, though the right buyer might pay around $100-110 for it.   The 1890 seems to be problem-free-ish, but is very heavily worn. If, examining it in hand, it truly is problem-free (I suspect it may be cleaned just based on coloration), it'd be worth a decent bit. I'd want to pay $40 or so for it, but if it made its way into a PCGS FR2 holder, I would expect to see it sell for around $120.

Last time I bought a couple nice gold coins so I had to make up for it in my favorite metal, silver. I got the libertads during the eBay special for like $17.40 each but they are kind of boring in the tube (why I bought them) and I don't want to ding them up taking them all out. I came back to Apmex after they exchanged the 20 franc they misshipped. I was happy to see the libertads well packaged with the blue box yesterday but pretty dissapointed in their shipping today. Everything arrived fine however sp I can't complain. I've kept my eye out to see what the new releases are that I like and I got most of them over these two orders and one from provident (still waiting). The little 1oz skull and crossbones is my favorite. Nevermind, after taking the privateer out of the bag it is simply amazing."

I have been buying a few single coins from Apmex's eBay store recently and they usually come in a small cardboard box (that is very hard to open) with that type of package that needs to be cut open.  Not saying you are wrong, but I never felt that it was poor packaging?"
Silverbugs,3b8yva,ctrip,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:37:05 2015 UTC,It was just the silver inside of the thin plastic bubble mailer this time. They didn't wrap it in any cardboard. It did appear that they wrapped the order confirmation sheet around them but it wasn't taped or anything. I knew what they were as soon as I held the package and they probably banged around a bit during shipment. The thin flat cardboard envelope things are the bomb as far as security.

The biggest issue is that Greece is in the EU and uses the Euro. They by law can't print currency in any form unless directed to by the ECB. Even then the other countries have the mints that do this and funnel it to Greece.  In theory if they could leave the Euro and bring back the Drachma and have the PM reserves to do so I would expect their currency would be consumed by every silver bug and gold bug in the world, as they would be buying the metal at spot price. They would ultimately be printing money that was never entered into their economy as everyone would buy it and keep it, this would destroy their economy. If they tried to stretch their supply and issued coins with a face value less than the PM content (like the $50 gold eagle) it would be cheaper just to use copper and zinc like the rest of the world and by pass any PMs.   PMs as a currency only work if the majority of the other countries are using them also, otherwise you are selling bullion at spot with no premium."

When a country's main product is it's currency the country basically becomes the Franklin Mint and should also issue Norman Rockwell pilsner glasses.  If Greece creates a new Drachma and other people outside Greece buy all of these Drachmas there are no Drachmas in Greece to facilitate actual transactions (Because in Greece you would have to use the Drachma, not the Chinese Yuan or US dollar you have from other people buying your currency). If for example Greece makes $1,000,000 in Drachmas and $900,000 go to ""investors"" in other countries it now has $100,000 that is supposed to cover every transaction in the country. If they use PMs as the coin material they can't afford to just buy more PMs and keep minting the coins.

Money is a form of advertisement and if you save it you are saying you have trust in that country. This is sometimes called an investment. If Greece prints their money, why would people buy this money? smh   Yes very good point when other countries hold some of another countries currency it is a good thing to a certain degree. The fundamental aspect of this that I think you are missing is that the money other counties hold is paper that has an intrinsic value based on the promise the issuing government will make good on the note and an actual value of 0 (or what ever scrap paper is worth). If the new Drachma in this thought experiment were to happen and it is made of gold or silver the other countries would be exchanging their potentially worthless notes (depending on how you feel about the government issuing the currency) for your physical silver/gold currency. There is a finite amount of gold and silver and Greece would not be able to keep minting currency for two reasons    1. Gold and Silver a limited in supply, even if they spent every foreign dollar they received in exchange for more PMs there is not always going to be a supply to replace the currency you loose. 2. Each time they buy more gold and silver it is consumed by other countries citizens that would rather have gold and silver instead of their dollars.   This ends in Greece minting tons of currency, but the majority of it leaving as soon as its minted to go to other countries for the PM VALUE not the belief the Greek Government is a good investment! Tell me how many silver US dollars/quarter/dimes do you get in your change in a typical day... Im pretty sure its close to NONE.   As if the only way to use precious metals is to use them in their physical form. Say one were to create paper/electronic digits to represent certain fractional weights of PM?   Yeah I think you are missing the point of this. The original comment was if they issued coins in SILVER or GOLD. There are literally billions of what ifs we can add to this thought experiment, but that was the original intention.   If Greece prints paper or digital currency that can be redeemed for physical gold you sure as hell can bet that a hedge fund is going to accumulate as much as they can and not spend it. (The absolute worse thing for an economy) By not spending it, the Greek government is essentially safely storing the hedge funds gold for free. Or the hedge fund could redeem it and take possession of the PMs and Greece loosing it only means to trade within its own country.  The BIGGEST point that is being missed is that if Greece did have a currency that was in huge demand because it was a PM their currency would be the strongest in the world! That means that NO OTHER COUNTRY would be likely to afford the good they make or afford to vacation there (tourism is their biggest source of GDP). A weak currency is what Greece needs to spur its economy and fix this mess, not a new global reserve currency."

Or I ignored answering that with a response.  No one would mine/buy gold then use it today as money like they would dollar bills.  This is the strawman people use against PM backed currency.   To spend time responding to it that way (did I just get trolled) would be a poor use of my time.   and not spend it. (The absolute worse thing for an economy)   Are you a silver bug?  What in the blazes did I even read?  So gold is valuable.  The money backed by gold is valuable.  How does a hedge fund accumulate the money?  They'd have to earn it just like everyone else.  What they'd do with it after they do earn it is their business.  If they took the route of ""not spending"" it, then this would be the worse because Greece would be holding the gold in their vaults, while the businesses and people don't have to pay a fee for this service.  ...  The absolute worse thing for a government and economy is people SAVING.  What's more is to have your money safely stored in your governments vaults behind your governments military.  The horror.   Or the hedge fund could redeem it and take possession of the PMs   The crucial step that you ignorantly or intentionally missed is that there was some sort of valuable production done in order for someone to trade their gold for.  But Greece lost because the economy is working and they aren't getting a holding fee.  If I was the government of Greece that'd just piss me right off.   The BIGGEST point that is being missed is that if Greece did have a currency that was in huge demand because it was a PM their currency would be the strongest in the world!

A weak currency is what Greece needs to spur its economy and fix this mess, not a new global reserve currency.   1 drachma could be to 50,000 dollars or five dollars.

Silverbugs,3b5zji,CurtNo,2,Fri Jun 26 11:41:10 2015 UTC,"When Greece joined the Euro in 2002, the exchange rate was €1 = 340.750 ₯. Assuming that the ""New Drachma"" kept the same rate, and going by the spot price here (as of the time of writing, this is €14.20), 1 tr. oz. of pure silver is worth 4838.65 ₯. A £1 coin (I'm using this for reference because I'm from the UK) is 1252mm3, which works out to be 13.1 grams if it were made of pure silver, or ~ 0.421 tr. oz. I'm going to multiply this value by 0.9 as it's more likely that a silver coin that's legal tender is not going to be pure (it's too soft), so that's 0.38 tr. oz, which works out to be worth around 1834 ₯. Of course, it's value as currency has to be greater than its value as a precious metal, otherwise people will not spend them, so it will likely be used as a 2000 or 2500 ₯ coin. Even a 5p-sized coin (the physically smallest in British circulation) would, by the same metric (90% silver) be worth, as metal, 707 ₯, which would likely be a 1000 ₯ coin.  The TL;DR of this is that only very large denominations could have a sizeable silver content, most of them would likely be made of copper if you're basing it on metals with value (at least up until 1000 ₯), and gold coins would likely be extremely rare, if used at all, due to incredibly high denomination (banknotes would likely be used instead)."

The government controls the people. Not possible with sound money."

Silverbugs,3b4m7n,maksimfa,2,Thu Jun 25 22:45:21 2015 UTC,Can you explain your hedging strat a bit more. I read that's how bullion sellers avoid going out of business during market fluctuations but the information was vague. Personally I've bought a few mine stocks for the fun of it but I'd love to learn more.
Silverbugs,3b4m7n,Soupdumpling81,3,Thu Jun 25 23:15:46 2015 UTC,"Sure.  Well, the easiest way would be to sell short the equivalent amount of Oz you want to hedge.  This way you are locking in and basically flat vs the silver you own yourself.  The other way that costs you a bit but has more options.... is to buy Put options on the silver ETF at a price where you either want to hedge or feel uncomfortable holding.  So for instance, I am looking at Jan 2016 $15 Puts, for $1 each.  Basically, what that means is that anytime between now and and Jan 2016, I can sell 1 share of the silver ETF, SLV to someone, for $15 a share.  For that privilege, I am paying $1 per share, or roughly 1 oz.     At the end, Jan 2016, if that ETF is over $15, that option expires worthless.  If it trades for less than $15, then it has value.    Basically, if that ETF is trading for $10.... your $1 option will be worth $5 as you can sell for $15. $15 - $10 market price = $5."

Silverbugs,3b55o6,x6ftundx,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:23:30 2015 UTC,"I was wondering, does it hurt the coin or devalue it in anyway? I figured these types of coins are just sold for melt value so toning doesn't really do anything, price wise."
Silverbugs,3b55o6,PrincessPi,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:13:25 2015 UTC,"The Zombucks are definitely not sold for melt.  The first couple in the series are only available now for around $50.

Silverbugs,3b3wpa,Spacecraft_Owner,8,Thu Jun 25 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"Well, my “hoard” is in no danger of attracting nearby dragons any time soon.  I’ve been officially stacking for a few months, though I’ve owned paper gold and silver ETFs on and off for years. I’ve got about 20ozt of phyz at the moment. Your question is very open to interpretation, so here is mine: Some of us use gold/silver as an investment vehicle, hedging their portfolio against financial turbulence. I place myself in this category. My view is that more than 15% of my total portfolio in precious metals (PM) would be overweight, based on my desire for a real positive return. I am underweight PMs at the moment, looking to acquire another ~50-80 ozt in the coming weeks, depending on spot price. Long term I expect to be able to convert my PM to equities at serious fire-sale prices.   My thesis is not shared by many reasonable people in the investment community, who view gold and silver as anachronisms, while accepting as valid the premise that their lack of counterparty risk is an attractive feature, and acknowledging that numismatic coins are historical artworks worthy of preservation. That is ok (because it means more silver for us). Some stackers do it for the artistic value of the pieces, whether they are historical, rare, or modern (looking at you dick-butt silver guy).  Other stackers will sort through literal tons of loose change to find one dingy 1964 quarter, and, yes, there is that community of folks who think that one day the collapse of fiat currencies and the fractional reserve banking system will usher in a new era of PM-backed prosperity, with themselves as the most prosperous founders of a brave new era. The many forms of stacking are all good, but as in investment strategy, it is important to remember the “strategy” part.   Personally, I would say that when stacking becomes more costly than any other “normal” hobby, you have reached “too much”. Fishermen, crossfitters, steampunk enthusiasts, and concert-lovers can all spend a boatload of cash on their pass-times, but I’ve never met anybody who had to sell their mint-condition collectable bass lures to finance daily life purchases. Not so with PMs. If having your wealth in PMs requires you to treat the LCS like a cash machine, it might be time to take a step back and weigh the risk of fiat against the inconvenience of converting back and forth. Likewise if you find yourself curtailing your social or work life in order to get a few more ozt on the stack each week, take a moment and breathe. Maybe spot will drop next week.  If you are among that hardcore minority that subscribe to the notion that PMs are money, and nothing else is, it would behoove you to ensure that you really understand the risks inherent in your investment / wealth preservation strategy. It is fun to own the shiny.Owning PMs is no guarantee of security or a positive real return, as the last few years have shown with painful clarity for a lot of members of this sub. If the dreaded Fed decides to jack interest rates to the moon and make all the bankers take their medicine like they should have, PMs will plummet relative to fiat. Not good if you’ve got >50% of your net worth sitting in your boat’s bilge as ballast.   Didn't mean to write a book, but I guess I'll keep it."
Silverbugs,3b3wpa,Ag47baby,2,Fri Jun 26 00:09:52 2015 UTC,"I have a different perspective.  About half of my (modest) wealth is in PMs.  I do, indeed, understand the risks.  I also understand the risks of the stock market and bonds, having invested in those for about 25 years.  I'm no longer a fan of stocks and bonds and now have minimal exposure.  To each his own!  I sleep well at night, knowing that while spot prices go up and down, over the long term, PMs preserve wealth and even slowly appreciate it.  That fits my needs well and I do not need to worry about whether a particular bank, firm, or government will default on its obligation to me."
Silverbugs,3b3wpa,Spacecraft_Owner,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:03:17 2015 UTC,"Much respect. You and I are in different places strategically, but your approach is equally valid. It's been ""the way to do it"" for millennia after all.   Out of curiosity, how much bother is it for you to move non-trivial sums out of PM? Buying is easy - all the sites we know and love handle that- but I've never given much thought to selling in lots a LCS might not be equipped to buy. You say ""half"" your wealth is PM  so I assume you've got the scratch for it not to be an issue, but what if you needed  to cash out some PM because you wanted a new car or your roof collapsed or whatever? Is it the same as buying large qtys?"
Silverbugs,3b3wpa,Ag47baby,2,Sat Jun 27 00:26:34 2015 UTC,"The largest sale I've done to date was 17 ounces of gold, to pay for college tuition for my daughter (which is what the gold was intended to do since I bought it).  That was a quick sale for spot at my LCS.  I think that was about the limit he was equipped to do.  But I do know that with one phone call to Provident, APMEX, or Scottsdale, I could unload a very large percentage of my stack.  Actually shipping the metal is a pain, but very doable and if I had a need to dump a large chunk of it, that's probably what I'd do."

Seriously, though, 599.93 ozt was my most recent total before it was all unfortunately lost in a tragic accident.  Edit: I don't think about it in a melt-it-down standpoint, because that would never be the appropriate method for disposing of it. A very, very rough approximation would put it closer to $20K in value. It ranges from stuff worth a few dollars over spot per ounce to coins worth hundreds of times their bullion value.  Before it all got lost, my intention was to sell it to pay for the final two semesters I need to finish my college degrees."

Silverbugs,3b2pe5,mrmyrth,3,Thu Jun 25 15:15:36 2015 UTC,"Stackers Fight On  Stackers have endured a long, hot summer of attacks upon silver.  Yet, despite that fact, they’ve doubled down on their retail silver buying as of late, and have absolutely refused to quit. The numbers bear it out.  Earlier this month, I covered how India has already imported perhaps as much as 100 million ounces(or 1,000 lakhs) of silver, in just the first 4 months of the year, and the same strong demand continues apace in the retail market.   Throughout the globe(with the exception of Perth), most of the world’s mints are showing near record demand.  The most impressive part about it though, are silver’s sales compared to its golden cousin.  In fact, check out this powerful chart, from a buddy of mine, which shows another undeniably powerful trend:  http://i.imgur.com/7c9VC0D.png  Silver hot 3  Unreal, right?  Ever since the Financial Crisis, it is not simply the raw mintage of silver coins that has soared, but, even more impressively, the silver to gold sales ratio has soared too. This trend is now 6 years old, and shows no signs of stopping.  Nothing close to this ratio has ever occurred before.  Despite the fact that we know the metal is only supplied at a 9 to 1 ratio, the US Mint has sold over 112 times as much silver as gold.  Furthermore, this ratio doesn’t even count the America the Beautiful series, or the numismatic sales.  “Watchman, give it a rest! Price continues to languish, this just isn’t a big deal!”  Wrong, it’s a very big deal.  You see, while governments have hoarded gold by the tens of thousands of tonnes for centuries, they no longer have silver stockpiles left to speak of.    Governments can(and do) dump their gold holdings in “leases” on the market every day, yet they are doing literally zero dumping of silver onto the market.  As I’ve covered before, the recently released data from the Silver Institute bears this out:  http://i.imgur.com/6IjlLSd.jpg  Indian silver 2  See that 2nd line under “Supply” near the top, marked “Net Government Sales”?  Last year was the first time since these records began, that world government silver sales were zero.  What this means is that while governments may or may not have more gold to dump onto the market, from this point on, they are out of state-owned, physical silver for all rigging intents and purposes.  This further demonstrates that the only means by which this silver suppression has continued, has been to meet this demand with the record, frenzied pace that silver miners are bringing it out of the ground.  That’s it!  Mine supply is the only card they have left, as silver’s monstrous flow, worldwide, is literally “hand to mouth”.  With a week left to go in the month of June, the silver eagle number is already bumping against 3.3 million for the month.  This will undoubtedly be the strongest sales month since January at roughly 4 million, and bring 2015’s halfway total to roughly 21 million ounces(or on par with last year’s record figure).  As blistering as worldwide sales paces continue to be though, I’m not chiefly focused on that, as something even more interesting is happening right now at the Comex…  Very Interesting COT Numbers  For the past several weeks, the open interest at the Comex has continued to climb…yet all the while, silver’s price has not truly broken down with gusto…  Why is that?  Please understand me here: I’m not calling that level “strong price support”, there is no line that is strong enough to withstand the attacks of our banking enemies.  They can take price wherever they wish, whenever they like.  So, why hasn’t silver caved in at this point yet, despite relentless attacks?  Ahhh, that’s the interesting thing…  The banks are not currently the big sellers in silver!  Quite the opposite, brothers.  In fact, for the last several weeks the banks have been quietly(but furiously) covering their shorts, and have been going long.  Just several weeks ago, the “commercials”(big banks), bought back 20,000 short contracts in one week!  That’s 100 million ounces of paper silver shorts, transferred off the banks’ position in one fell swoop!  Last week that trend continued, with the banks going further net long by another 7,100 contracts…or over 35 million ounces.  “Wait, Watchman, if the banks aren’t doing the shorting here, then why is silver near the lows of the past month?”  It’s because others are shorting silver in record numbers right now, just not the banks.  The “speculator” money, the hedge funds, managed money, etc are all currently taking record short positions in silver.  They’re loading the boat with all the silver shorts they can get their hands on.  “Wait, that’s crazy!  If JP Morgan and the other banks are covering, why on earth would they do this?”  Hey, I never said these folks were smart! After all, “betting the farm” on lower silver prices(despite the fact that the cost of production is much higher than current price levels) almost deserves the “Darwin Award” at this point!  Nevertheless, they are doing precisely that, and the preliminary open interest in silver has now reached truly unheard of levels.  In fact, Craig Hemke recently tweeted:  “This is insanity! Prelim Comex numbers show a new ATH in silver OI. Up 7000 today to 202,415. At 5,000 oz/contract, that’s over 1B paper oz.”  Remember, in this space, for every short, there is a long.  If the banks aren’t going short here, yet open interest is at an all-time high(over 1 BILLION paper ounces, in positions)…what do you think is about to happen?  Here’s what seems highly likely to me, in the very near future…  1) The specs and hedge funds continue to pile on shorts at levels that banks are heavily buying at. Remember, those specs are like the Pavlovian dog.  They’ve been trained by the banks to think that heading into Comex Options Expiry, the banks always cash in on short positions, so it seems “the thing to do”.  2) This time, however, while heading into Options Expiry the specs are going short, while the banks are going long. Even as we speak, those banks are pouncing on every new long being pitched, or going long against every new short.  3) When(not if) that shorting exhausts itself(at a price perhaps above the 15.50’s)…you will see speculators(holding hundreds of millions of ounces of paper silver shorts) being crushed by an immense short squeeze trap, which the banks have spent the last month laying in silver.  “Interesting, Watchman, so you’re saying this is ‘the big one’?”   Now, hold on! I didn’t say that, because it all depends on what the banks do next.  If the banksters’ plan to cap silver is still in effect, then I’d expect a quick(but short) rally of roughly $1 to $1.50.  Since the last, stifled break-out stopped at $17.80,  I’d guess that they’ll stop the advance shy of that mark, if the capping plan is still a go.  However, something else could happen…  Is it Time?  Three months ago, I laid out my thesis.  I said that silver is so crucial to the system, and that the worldwide supply/demand equation has become so critical, that it’s necessary for the banks to cap silver’s rise until the very last moments this international monetary system has….or else too many sheep will be alerted that something is wrong.  For that reason, silver and gold must be suppressed until the clock runs out, in order to ensure the maximum amount of capital stays in the banksters’ fraudulent, digital ponzi-extraordinaire!  They want as few “winners”, and as many losers as possible.  They need to seize as much “bail-in” capital as they can when the teetering house of the cards comes crashing down.  As Brotherjohnf says, “they want all the theatre doors locked, and everyone trapped helplessly inside, before the elites yell, “FIRE!“  That’s one reason I’m watching things like the Greek fiasco so carefully.  If anything could burn down the theatre right proper, it would be contagion and fallout from the Greek situation.  If silver’s rally isn’t capped, and is in fact, allowed to burst with the potential ferocity I believe exists…  Then we could be much closer to the end of Bretton Woods II, than we realize.  Either way, “the House” always wins, and JP Morgan and the banksters are sitting pretty with their lowest net short silver position in months(and with open interest at all time highs, no less).  Things are about to get interesting!  Conclusion  India, which is already buying a third of all silver, has broken its own records for the past 2 years running, and is now looking to do so for a third straight year.  The Indian nation will likely take in over 250 million ounces this year, and perhaps as much as 300 million…This will be to feed its insatiable appetite for bargain-hunting bullion deals, but also to build out the nearly $1 trillion in infrastructure that India needs to build within the next few years.  The Canadian, US, and private mints all continue to sell silver coins at record paces, as stackers worldwide have dug in their heels, and refuse to budge.  Meanwhile, with Comex open interest at all-time highs(of over 1 billion paper oz), JP Morgan and the banks, have by now perhaps reduced themselves to nearly net neutral in silver.  This would be amazing, as just a few short years ago, their short to long ratio was nearly 3 to 1!  The bankster trap on the specs will soon be sprung, and then we’ll see what “the plan” is for the immediate future: either the largest percentage rally in silver in several years….or just the next “lower high” in the contrived downtrend.  One thing’s for certain: the specs are in for a world of hurt, and very soon…perhaps even within the next week.  Until that time, JP Morgan will be gobbling up every single long contract that it can…"

Silverbugs,3b2pe5,maksimfa,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:17:05 2015 UTC,"Its a lot of drivel honestly.  The central points that banks are going long while pensions, endowments, private funds, and hedge funds are going short, and thus banks are smarter.... well, I think it is quite wrong.  If there is smart money, it is not the banks, but rather the hedge funds and private funds.  They are the ones afterall who made money in the 2008 crash.  Furthermore, you need to normalize it based on dollars spent. Let me explain...  When people buy silver... they do not say...  I am going to buy 1 oz a week no matter the price.  They say instead...  I am going to buy as much as $100 can buy.  So... As the price PLUMMETS, people will be able to buy significantly more OZ.... thus the central premise of the article.  In reality, if you are looking at whether money is flowing into or out of silver, it is flowing out on a net basis... and has been flowing out for the past 2 years.  Lastly, the comments on the banks... the large part of why they may be buying has to do with BASEL bank requirements.  There are many units that they have to spin off, and thus still have money that needs to be deployed.   Here is the chart that shows volumes and money flows for the last 15 years.  Don't take this the wrong way, there are plenty of ways to make money stacking, BUT you cannot give yourself unbiased advice when everything around screams cheap and must buy.  If you bought silver in 1980's, you would still be down today.  Food for thought.  http://i.imgur.com/dvDYFZE.png"

I'd measure the outside diameter for the Perth capsule and compare it with the I's outside diameter of 51.59mm to make sure that a tube for I holders would do the job without even needing new capsules.  As an aside: If you do go with new I airtites, hold on the the Perth capsules as many collectors will expect to get the mint capsule with the coin.  And an extra aside: there was a post about 3d printed trays a few months ago, you could modify the design to accomodate for Perth capsules or even get a tube 3d-printed.

I started talking to a co-worker about metals and it took so much convincing for him to see money though a different lens. It was like I was selling him a timeshare or something. He ended up buying maybe 20 ounces and got super frustrated when the price dropped. He also thought his 401k was FDIC insured so maybe I was barking up the wrong tree.

There was indeed a silver quarter in there.   This week (today), I had to go to the bank (which is in a supermarket right near us) to get $20 in quarters.  So I get the two rolls, and as I'm walking back to the store, I noticed one of the quarters at the end of one of the rolls was kind of pale for a common quarter. I had a feeling it was silver.  I got back to the shop and busted open the roll with the suspected silver quarter. Well, there were actually two of them in there. :D  Good shit my friends! That's 3 silver Washington quarters so far.  And the funny thing is I have a roll of Seated Liberty Quarters (not complete), Barber, and Standing Liberties (almost complete), but I've never been interested in starting a roll of Washington's.

But it's always 1965 and after. I just really thought I would see a decent amount of them considering how much change I get at my job - specifically quarters. That was not the case. I've come across absolutely nothing until this happened.  Since the 3 silver quarters came from the same bank, I'm thinking that someone has infused them with silver quarters.  My boss told me that he swears he heard the sound of a silver quarter when he was giving change to a customer the other day, but it didn't register with him until the person left. I really think I should get my ass to that bank and buy like $200 worth of quarters ASAP."

Silverbugs,3azgau,FrogTrainer,7,Wed Jun 24 19:08:48 2015 UTC,"14x FV isn't bad. Not phenomenal, but not terrible either. I'd pay it if I thought it would help me build rapport with a new shop I was likely to frequent.   Check out the generics - lots of things that are worth way more than generic prices often end up in generic bins. If it's a true low-premium generic with no collector's value, $3 over isn't a very good deal at all, but you may find something in there worth $40-50.   Dig through the world silver as well - another great opportunity to find something valuable. This stuff often sells at melt, or very close to it, and there's often stuff worth way more than melt in these bins."
Silverbugs,3azgau,e30kgk,2,Wed Jun 24 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"Ya that's the thing though, I have NO IDEA how to identify those $40 generics or valuable world silver.

Silverbugs,3azgau,e30kgk,3,Wed Jun 24 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"/u/satirical_whit is dead on with this - it just takes time and experience.   As a general rule, generics that you have never seen before are worth looking up. Use the text on the round to search ebay for completed auctions - the smartphone app is exceptionally handy for this. With some experience, you'll have seen almost all the common ones and get to a point where you don't need to look stuff up everytime - I'll generally take a gamble at $20 or less on any generic I haven't seen before. It almost always pays off. Just about any unusual round is going to catch someone's eye and make them think ""whoa, that's cool, I've gotta have that,"" and that creates a market for them.   Almost anything with a corporate branding on it is worth a good bit, as is anything vintage and/or poured. Engelhard stuff is always good at $3 over (except maybe for the 10 oz machine pressed bars), even the super-common stuff. You can get really lucky with Engelhard stuff - for example, anything odd sized (e.g., not 1, 5, 10, or 100 oz) is worth a goddamn fortune.  As for the world stuff, again look at ebay completed auctions, though experience is even more important here. You'll start to learn purities of things, which stuff is more or less valuable, key dates, etc. The NGC world coin price guide is a great starting reference - it'll list purity and bullion value of just about every foreign coin. Ignore the prices in there though, they're only good as relative guidelines (e.g., if one year is 10x the value of the other years, you can pretty safely bet that's a key date - but just because something says it's worth $40 doesn't mean it is)."
Silverbugs,3azgau,satirical_whit,2,Wed Jun 24 22:27:33 2015 UTC,"It takes time. I've been at this 7 months and still have no problem finding things to research and read about...even with the government bullion.  I would say just go and look. Ask questions if you are curious about something. If the proprietor of your LCS doesn't want to take the time to talk to you and tell you about things you are curious about, you dont want to be there anyways. There are a few really good LCS that I go to where the owners are SUPER friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoy going to those because I can learn. Only real downside to that is that its hard to come across the super good deals because the LCS knows exactly what they have.  Personal example: LCS1 has great owner, friendly and knowledgeable. LCS2 has meh owner and only really knows about government bullion. I go to both of these places. At LCS1 I have almost never purchased something that I could flip for a profit immediately, because the guy knows his shit and its priced at market value all the way around (government, private mint stuff, poured, etc).   At LCS2 I have found MANY things to immediately flip for a decent profit. Their junk bin is a treasure trove of great stuff that they think is just ""generic"". Bad thing here is that you have to know what you are looking at. If the owner of this place knew what the stuff was, it wouldnt be in the junk bin, so theres no point on asking him.  I hope that makes sense."

I got a US Assay Office silver ounce for $17 once.  They had no clue what it was and thought it was just a generic round.

Silverbugs,3ayd47,eisforevan,2,Wed Jun 24 14:18:33 2015 UTC,Of course it depends who owns the gold.  I doubt any central bank or government wants to back a bunch of IOUs with the gold bars in their possession.
Silverbugs,3ayd47,TX_Man_,2,Wed Jun 24 17:08:20 2015 UTC,"For the sake of including silver, let's throw in 20 ounces of silver for every ounce of gold, and use the 1:20 ratio the US had way back when we actually had silver dollars.  That would mean Gold would go for $16,949/oz and Silver would go for $847/oz  If we make the ratio 1:73.85 based on current prices, silver would then be $229.51/oz"
Silverbugs,3ay8ot,hbcivicsi93,2,Wed Jun 24 13:40:57 2015 UTC,I happened to come across this and started doing some research on it last night for possible resale.

Silverbugs,3ay6bo,cent66,3,Wed Jun 24 13:19:00 2015 UTC,Fractional European Gold... all day son.
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,priuspilot,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:14:54 2015 UTC,I almost pulled the trigger on one of those yesterday.. It will probably be my next purchase.  Lately I've been buying a 20 Franc Rooster with every bucks deal. I like the low $ layout for gold that's $4 over spot without any other deals or savings.   It's such an amazing deal all around.... I feel like it will inevitably end but I intend to take advantage of some cheap fractional gold until it does.
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,priuspilot,2,Thu Jun 25 09:49:42 2015 UTC,It doesn't start until 11 am east coast time.  APMEX has 1 oz random Canadian Maple Leafs in a non bullion categoery around $1250 so $1150 after the deal plus another $12 from ebates.  Not quite as good as last time where I got a 2009 one for $1104.
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,idratherbgardening,4,Thu Jun 25 10:48:48 2015 UTC,The last ebate I got credit for was on 5/26.  Since then I made 2 purchases from eBay that were categorized as Word Coins and received eBay Bucks but no ebates.  Ebates seems to have stopped crediting anything coin or bullion related at all.
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,ctrip,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:59:57 2015 UTC,Same here.  Anyone know of any other cash back rebate sites like ebates that still give $$ back for coin purchases on Ebay?
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,dividethatbynineplz,2,Wed Jun 24 16:56:12 2015 UTC,Swagbucks for 1%
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,knowldge,2,Wed Jun 24 17:44:21 2015 UTC,It did on 5/26 but I haven't bought coins since then.
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,idratherbgardening,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:15:30 2015 UTC,How do you find the non-bullion category coins?
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,Ag47baby,2,Wed Jun 24 21:33:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, lots of searching.  But if you know what you are looking for, do a top level search and then pick the non bullion category.   ""gold maple leaf"" in Coins shows 393 in bullion and 245 in Coins:Canada.  The top link in Coins:Canada is APMEX for $1253.  Some coins are double listed and don't count like the next few from Bullion Exchange.  (MCM also does this a lot).   Bullion Exchange does have 5 1/10 oz 2015 maples listed purely in Coins:Canada though for $707.  I wish APMEX would list all the Mexican gold pesos in Mexican coins.  They list a few but most are in bullion."
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,idratherbgardening,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Thanks!  I did get one random-year Maple from APMEX and I told myself it would be the last time I ordered a 24k random-year coin, as it had some very minor scratches.  But maybe I'll reconsider, if the price is right!"

This looks to be the auction but I don't see an ebay bucks logo. I believe it shows up down by the paypal logo under shipping/delivery at the top of the listing. Is anyone seeing the ebay bucks logo on this listing?  I'm signed up, but I've never seen the logo, though I'm not a big ebayer."

Every since I started buying a lot of items that would qualify me for eBay bucks they stopped sending me eBay bucks. I've went more then a year now without a single one. Has anyone else noticed this happening to them?
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,purargent,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"It happened to me but not that long.  They suddenly stopped sending me the offers for about 6 months.  Suddenly, they started again.  Last offer, I skipped because I was out of town.  I'm looking now and trying to find something that I like.   What are the qualifications on who gets offered the ebay bucks?  I don't know but I wish I know the process who gets them and who doesn't."
Silverbugs,3ay6bo,purargent,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:39:52 2015 UTC,I wish I knew the process also :) It would be hard to believe that the selection process is just random though. I do know that eBay isn't about giving out free money unless there is something in it for them. It would be bad marketing/business otherwise. Maybe I need to try and not buy anything for a couple months from eBay and see if they throw me a bone :)

Then again, maybe they're still mad at me for the time they offered a $10 off code to start selling and all I sold was a Roosevelt dime."
Silverbugs,3ayraw,mrmyrth,2,Wed Jun 24 16:08:07 2015 UTC,"Glad you have a good/great relationship with your LCS it definitely has its perks. Plus it sounds like yours is up to date on some of the more recent t happenings in then bullion/coin world.   I do have a good relationship with mine also but they are so behind the times its not even funny. They only just started selling 90% in bags of $25fv a few years ago and that was after much prodding to the owner it was $100 fv before because ""it's to much work.""  The newest up to date thing they have ordered was a few tubes of the 1 1/4 oz Canadian Buffalo coins.  A few weeks ago they had some provident prospect rounds in tube still and I asked about them. They bought it off of some guy and then proceeded to tell me it is someone trying to being back the Engelhard ones so they are a $4.00 premium over spot.  I told them to look it up online and see what they were going for and they said they charge that much because you don't have to wait for them to mail them.  I've had my scores from there before so I do keep going back and have built a decent relationship but they will either sink or swim by adjusting to the times. The older coin only collecting people are slowly dying out and yes there are those of us who and picking up some of the slack but no where near the numbers.   This turned into a bit of a rant but with the ease of the Internet our local brick LCS are going to need to adapt or die."

Silverbugs,3ayraw,Ag47baby,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:50:46 2015 UTC,It sounds nice but your mileage may vary.  I tried this for a while at my LCS and eventually asked if I could get a discount if I bought three tubes of ASEs.  The price per tube was about $15-20 over what I would have paid at Provident.    The answer was no.
Silverbugs,3ayraw,wildruler,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:45:19 2015 UTC,My LCS hooks me up sometimes. I got tubes for my junk for free when I started stacking. Their junk is 14x fv but this month they lowered it for me to 13.5x fv. I thought it was their new price until somebody else came in and they charged that person 14x fv. I also get free obsolete world banknotes so that's cool too.

The Vienna Philharmonic doesn't actually have a Chief Conductor/Artistic Director, but other world-class orchestras do and here are their yearly earnings. Take note that this is from 2012 and just for the organization listed -- they do guest conducting gigs with other orchestras for particular concerts and are typically the head conductors for others, as well. They generally do other side gigs throughout the seasons, too. In the end, the top tier conductors end up making pretty serious money."

Last time in 2011, in large part, Silver shot up along with Gold due to the fear of economic collapse, in part due to the quantatitive easing pumping liquidity that leads to inflation, the recession we were just getting out of, combined with the fear of default in congress with the budget fights.

Silverbugs,3av9b2,whirlyboy,4,Tue Jun 23 19:54:54 2015 UTC,"some thoughts -    Silver Shot   You dont need shot. In fact you can often times find generic rounds for spot price or under (or even better if you have ebay bucks). I have purchased two tubes of buffalos (weeks apart) for casting and have not paid over spot either time. Just look out for the deals on ebay especially.   Tumbler   You don't really need that right away. I would stick with the bare essentials until you know this is something you want to commit some serious time/resources to. You buy a tumbler and then end up not liking the casting process...what else you gonna use that for?   Something to cast   I didn't look at the details of those, but it looks like those are soft and pliable. Keep in mind that the delft clay process requires packing the clay pretty darn tight around the item. If you have something ""gummy"" or squishy, its likely to deform in the molding process.  I would stick to something easy for your first casting, like perhaps a screwdriver head (the small removable ones). Nice and solid, not many twists or crevases, and kinda hard to mess up.  Might I suggest this to replace your crucible/tongs/borax..  That borax that you linked is a ripoff (IMHO). You are getting 4 ounces for $6 (OVER $10 if you include shipping), or, $2.50 per ounce. there is NOTHING special about borax. Go buy it from Walmart...that is $0.05 per ounce. You do the math."
Silverbugs,3av9b2,satirical_whit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:33:13 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure whether the Commercial Borax had any kind of additive that might make it less effective so I went with that one.   The crucible/tongs combo looks great. I looked at another one and the reviews seemed to suck so I broke it up into the highest rated of each.  As for the shot, I was wondering if for a beginner having shot would make it easier to melt. I have generics that I wanted to use, but wasn't sure if plopping them into the crucible and going to town was the best idea.  The toys were kind of a joke...bugs...get it? I figured I'd start with something hard with few edges (like a wedding band), but the screwdriver head might make more sense."
Silverbugs,3av9b2,satirical_whit,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah no worries. No the borax has no difference.  Yes, the shot does melt ""easier"", but that shouldnt matter with the fire bricks or enclosure u have (on my phone so cant see your op right now). Just bend the generics with some pliers and go to town."
Silverbugs,3av9b2,bzzzr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:46:49 2015 UTC,For the tumbler would a brass tumbler off an ammo reloading bench work or is that drum style one different?
Silverbugs,3av9b2,Disabled_gentleman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:42:33 2015 UTC,I would think its the tumbler medium that matters most. I tumble glass and the biggest difference I've found between the barrel and the shaker (?) tumbler is the speed things get done. The barrel is really slow.

Silverbugs,3au5e1,Soupdumpling81,11,Tue Jun 23 15:30:51 2015 UTC,"Some early circulating medium (money/currency) was actually livestock and slaves. It was portable and somewhat fungible (a cow should be close to value to another cow). They were referred to as living money.  Cattle is sometimes considered the first wealth of mankind and were probably in most countries the first money. For instance, most commodities were valued at so many cattle and cattle were commonly given in exchange for all other things.   As metal made it way as money, it was not identified as being convenient representative of the commodities or property of all kinds, but as a substitute for cattle. Some of the oldest coins have figures of cattle stamped on them and some languages 'money' was actually called 'cattle'.   'Pecus' is Latin for cattle or livestock is the origin of 'pecunia' which is Latin for money."

Lastly I try to give some credit to something I don't think can be measured but can be inferred with some education.  The ""cool"" factor if you like.  How many people want a goat privy?  What is cool about goats?  How many people want a dragon privy?  How cool are dragons?  Both probably have an even number of people with that are their birth symbol and could sell evenly on those grounds if not for the fact that dragons are a cultural symbol across much of Asia.

That makes up about 95% of my stack at the moment. I don't like buying anything else because I try to keep my cost per ounce as low as possible."
Silverbugs,3aus26,purargent,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:12:36 2015 UTC,I'd look at sold eBay prices not APMEX prices for a better gauge of demand and what someone is willing to pay.
Silverbugs,3aus26,maksimfa,0,Tue Jun 23 23:51:00 2015 UTC,"I hear ya.  I'm a poor college student that was working part time until recently but run a small ebay biz.  I don't have much in the way of a stack but I just switched to full time last week since not taking summer classes.  My idea is to buy up as many E=mc2 maples as I can until they're gone and hopefully sit a while on them if I don't really need cash.  I don't think they'll go ballistic anytime soon, way higher mintage than some of those on the apmex link.  But I'd be happy if 24 dollar maples became 35 or 40 dollar maples.  I also am not a doomsdayer, I believe that when I cash out any silver I bought with a premium will be able to be sold with that premium.  I am an ebay powerseller so liquidating for fair market value for me is super easy, I asked an LCS to make offer on my proof eagle recently and got a good laugh.  I'm new and not much for speculating but I think I see an easy rise in the maples where I don't see such obvious things elsewhere."

Silverbugs,3aus26,AwkwardBipeds,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:59:16 2015 UTC,Definitely not an error or new.  there is nothing stopping Apmex from buying a few cases from Bullion Exchange and reselling them.... or.... someone buying a few cases and selling them to Apmex.
Silverbugs,3aus26,APMEXPreciousMetals,0,Tue Jun 23 22:02:36 2015 UTC,"Right, I merely find it strange that APMEX would pay dealer premium on a monster box to get coins to resell for a profit of $2 each, minus shipping and handling to their company for any orders over 99 which they must cover.  They have a rather extensive product catalogue, so if someone got exclusive rights to a coin it stands to reason it wouldn't affect APMEX much.  With a mintage of 50,000 and a profit of $2 per, they could buy the lot and I don't consider that a significant impact to business.  I would have expected to see small numbers appear as collections get sold back to APMEX over time only."
Silverbugs,3aup16,spanishfry,3,Tue Jun 23 17:34:49 2015 UTC,"It looks like there were rubber bands touching these coins. Tarnish is just the sulphur in the air depositing on silver, hence the smell when you clean it. Rubber has a lot of sulphur to vulcanize it to make it into rubber as we know it. This is tarnish on steroids. I know of no way to remove this kind of deposit, I would guess that any attempt that is successful would damage the coins."
Silverbugs,3aup16,Chilton1776,3,Tue Jun 23 17:54:16 2015 UTC,"I would super glue the tarnished sides together, that way you get a 2 oz ASE with proper obverse and reverse.  I make the big bucks because I focus on solutions, not problems."

And as far as mint tubes- you'll want to keep any Pandas you buy in their original mint capsules or mint sheets. There is a big counterfeit problem with Pandas, so having them be in their original Chinese Mint capsules or mint sheets will help ensure they are authentic in the future when you go to sell.

Silverbugs,3aylkb,Peterboring,4,Wed Jun 24 15:49:50 2015 UTC,"Chances are the tube was never opened before it got to whatever retailer you got it from. Provident probably handles bulk shipments to other dealers differently than they would yours or my individual order. The mint is probably ultimately the cause of the damage. Your retailer is likely the one that guarantees the quality and for shipping said damaged product to you. I agree with /u/Peterboring and /u/ProvidentJoeMerrick.

Silverbugs,3arwci,tmlee,6,Tue Jun 23 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"Silver is great as a portion of savings but you're in a risky spot if all you hold is metal. I see this kind of mentality a lot here. Don't treat the USD like a wartime occupational currency. It absolutely isn't and you don't see a whole lot of people retiring off their saved metal. Sometimes the path less traveled is less traveled for a reason. I keep quite a bit of silver, but I feel much more comfortable with my real estate, savings, and pension. And in the event of a wartime scenario I have guns too."
Silverbugs,3arwci,Energy_Turtle,2,Tue Jun 23 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"Not many have a pension anymore, and most of the people here seem to have real estate, and savings... However the lions share may be in PMs for some."
Silverbugs,3arwci,vamper,3,Tue Jun 23 05:11:57 2015 UTC,"Whether it's a pension or 401k or whatever, people should use it. It's just a crazy idea to put all your eggs in one basket, especially when that basket swings quite a bit. I think some here surround themselves with only this one idea that PMs are the future and the path to wealth. It's just not that way. Even our LCS guys know better and they are usually huge metal holders. They just made a better way to live off it."
Silverbugs,3arwci,Energy_Turtle,3,Tue Jun 23 05:20:45 2015 UTC,"yeah i feel confirmation bias is a big bad part of the PM community... you have dozens of ways for it to arise everything from historical performance, supply ""shortages"", fiat instability, and many many more, and most of these pull at the heart and soul."
Silverbugs,3arwci,vamper,2,Tue Jun 23 05:44:18 2015 UTC,"I have a different perspective.  I put away money into a 401k for over 20 years.  At one point I changed jobs and rolled that money into an IRA and began a new 401k.  I stopped contributing to my new 401k quite some time ago when I fully internalized that I had absolutely no control over that money until I was 62.  And with a single Congressional vote, that ""62"" could change to ""70"".   I also think the risk of force reallocation of 401k funds to, say, Treasury Bonds, is significant.  And who's to say that the deferred taxation advantage that these have today will still be there later?  I prefer to have direct access to my modest wealth.  I do agree with your point about the importance of having guns.  Free men own guns.  Slaves can't."
Silverbugs,3arwci,Ag47baby,3,Tue Jun 23 10:41:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know why someone (Energy_Turtle?) downvoted you. But what you say is true. 401K and any other Congressional designed (tax advantaged) money accounts can be altered at the will of Congress or even a heavy handed Executive (EO) if the legislature/judicial branches don't stop it. Please note that 401Ks are subsection 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Doesn't take much to change it. They did the same thing with Social Security. It use to be an individual account and now it is for all purposes, a pooled account. They are always talking about increasing the age of SS accounts, why not IRA as well? Plus adjust the way we do the 'death' tax.  ""Only the rich have retirement accounts. Lets tax them!"" Populism is a bitch.   The powers that be can increase the age and limit the annual withdraws hoping you die before you empty it and then the government takes the rest. There is so many ways the IRS can tax you, we can't even guess all of the ways they come up with. Of course they will just to close those 'loop-holes' that the rich exploit.  But what Energy Turtle says it true as well. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. If an employer matches, do it. Just don't expect it to be there when you retire, just like I don't expect my SS to be there when I retire. But I still contribute. I also expect to have to subsidize my retirement with other funds."
Silverbugs,3arwci,hooahreddit,2,Tue Jun 23 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"No, thank you.  I will not contribute, despite the match.  I'm not advocating putting all eggs in one basket, though my PMs are a very large percentage of my modest net worth.  And I'm quite happy with my financial situation.

If they did a complete new series, I would think they could do a good job at either continuing the Zombucks theme and continue making unique coins for all 50 states, or I think they could make interesting intergalactic coins. Whether they design planets in our solar system, nebulas, galaxies, other bad ass space shit that's over my head, etc would be another kick ass series that I bet could score them a lot of business.   They're doing a great job of retaining me as a customer because of the Zombucks series alone and I'm loving this dying eagle design."

Silverbugs,3ark55,d_cruiser,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:29:54 2015 UTC,Perhaps the market is fearing the demand for Plat and Pall will be less in the future with the increase demand of the electric cars.  The market tends to be forward looking and Telsa stock has rebounded nicely.  I think platinum and palladium are leading.  I suspect gold and silver will soon follow down.
Silverbugs,3ark55,catandmouse663,2,Tue Jun 23 00:10:14 2015 UTC,"Great idea but I don't think so personally.  The electric car demand for plat and palladium is minuscule.    Typically they are an indicator of industrial demand.  In any case, they were all overbought in the first place, and are now coming back to reality, and long term trends."
Silverbugs,3ark55,reph,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:40:05 2015 UTC,Perception is reality with the market.  Electric cars are in and Telsa is leading the charge.  I think there's some fear that the industrial demand for platinum and palladium is going to decrease as electric cars gain traction and fewer gas powered cars are sold.  Never mind that catalytic converter will now be required for all gas powered cars sold in China by 2018.  And China has now surpassed US as the largest auto market.

Answer: Priceless.  That said, once you DO get an idea, if you do decide to sell any of it off, in the spirit of the man who gifted it to you it would probably be a good idea to give first shot to other silver bugs (who absolutely LOVE shiny, and certainly can appreciate the backstory of this) over at /r/pmsforsale.  I mean, the guy knew you were into coins so he gave you his collection knowing you would appreciate it. If PM's aren't really your thing and you want to stick to mostly world coins I'm sure he would understand the sell-off of some of that collection to finance your world coin interest.

Silverbugs,3aqdpc,satirical_whit,3,Mon Jun 22 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"The reason I asked for the rough idea on value is so I can adjust what the insurance is on my collection or at least get an idea of what the increase on the rate would be.  Probably negligable as my collection, without the silver, is insured for $5k.  I doubt this will change it much but I have been wrong in the past.    Sentimentially, you are 100% right.  No way I would part it.  I see it as my unborn children's inheritance from their great grandfather.  Now some of the world coins, I have many copies of so I could see trading a few of them for others I would want.  I'd talk with my wife before I ever decided to trade any of the silver off, but it would definately go to someone that could appreciate it if we decided to trade some of the collection.  Thank you for the welcome!"
Silverbugs,3aqdpc,Spence97,3,Mon Jun 22 18:20:27 2015 UTC,"Ayy fellow North Dakotan!!!   Also nice inheritance!  I think you'll find that buying silver and all that good stuff is a fun way to save!   Just in the US/Canadian coins alone there's nearly 29 ounces of silver there by my math.  I do not know about the foreign coins but I'd think there's a significant amount in them as well.  As of right now that's nearly $500 in just the US/Canadian coinage, but I wouldn't think of it in dollar amounts considering how you acquired it! :D  And this site has a huge database of the silver content of foreign coins.  I don't have time at the moment to dig through and give you values for all of your coins but you certainly can! http://www.ngccoin.com/price-guide/world/  For example, it turns out that each of the Swedish 25 ore coins have just under .05 ounces of silver each based on a quick search."

This appears to be real and I'm absolutely loving and embracing it, giving my all.  This weekend was pretty damned epic. On Friday night her daughter who is still being potty trained pooped in the potty. She needed two more stickers for her chart in order to go to Chuck E. Cheese and we told her before she did it that if she did, we'd go to Chuck E Cheese. A few minutes later, a nugget appeared! So of course, Saturday morning was spent getting ready, loading up and heading out. She got to meet the rat, get pics and videos with him and went absolutely BONKERS the couple hours we were there. Her little brother and one of her older ones were with us as well. That was kind of a bad idea since the older one (14) wanted to play games vs. me, which I enjoyed. But my girl was left to watch a 2 and 3 year old, in Chuck E Cheese, alone. She was DONE after an hour and toughed it out for another. After, we went back to her place, hung out a bit, then went swimming until the evening.  The next day was Father's Day. I have a biological son, but he hasn't talked to me since last summer and that was only the day he arrived back home from visiting me and only to let me know he was ok and on his way home in the car. I was dreading yesterday because of that, I wanted him to call so bad, but the realist in me knew he wouldn't. So anyway, our plan was to BBQ at my place, enjoy the pool and just attempt to relax with her BFF and her man. I get over to my girls to pick them up and her daughter comes running up to me, screaming my name, hugs me and then hands me a card. I opened it and just about broke down, I almost lost it with the emotion. It was SO unexpected, I honestly didn't even consider they might get me a card or anything. Feeling appreciated, wanted, loved, etc... is something I haven't felt in years and it's even more overwhelming knowing my girls past and where she is in life in general, but especially with me.  So the weekend was awesome. Totally. We all have our moments in this crazy world and I'm far from perfect, but she seems to truly accept me, and me her, even with our flaws. I think THAT is what it's really about after all, so I'm content and feeling very blessed.  Remember everyone, smile and make someone else smile daily. I do that and boy has my world changed since I started to go by that motto. :)"

Silverbugs,3anhmo,dclctcd,4,Sun Jun 21 23:52:37 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't act impulsively with your first purchases because if you go wild, you might have to fight later to bring down your cost average to a reasonable level. The price of silver will still be just as low next week and will probably remain low for a while. There's no urgency.  Now that you own a nice chunk of silver, you should look towards more affordable silver. You bought this bar with a premium of 56%, which is truly huge. The price of silver will have to increase by 56% for you to recoup your investment. In Europe, you can expect to sell a nice bar such as this one for 25% over spot, so the price of silver would still have to increase by almost a third for you not to lose money.  The last silver I bought typically carries a 15% premium, but I got it for 4% under spot price. It's possible to buy nice silver for spot or under if you're very lucky. In any case, you shouldn't buy anything with a premium that exceeds 25%.  As a European, you'll have to forget silver bars if your goal is to invest in silver. Gold bars are fine because they aren't subject to VAT and can generally be bought with a 0 to 5% premium.  You should look into what other British silver stackers are buying. In France we mostly stack nice French silver coins from the 1960s (10 francs Hercule, 50 francs Hercule, 5 francs Semeuse). They typically carry 0 to 15% premiums. This is called ""junk silver"", although it's far from being junk. We in France actually nickname the 50 francs Hercule coin ""fabuleuse"" (""the fabulous one"") because it's such a nice chunk of silver (30g of 90% silver).  This Wikipedia page lists what constitutes junk silver in anglo-saxon countries. There's a long list of British coins, but they're actually older than what American and French stackers are used to. From what I can see, the interesting coins span from 1837 to 1946. Stick to the 92.5% pure coins, the 50% pure coins aren't interesting. You're going to have to see for yourself if stacking these coins is popular among British stackers and if the premiums are low enough, my experience with them is limited to having a 1874 Victoria shilling in my collection.  Aside from French junk silver, I also stack American Silver Eagles. For us government bullion is a bit of luxury as these coins typically cost 20-25% over spot in Europe, but it's the cheapest way to own pure silver. Austrian Philharmonics are fairly popular in Europe and in the world too and you might want to look into Britannias since you're British.  I'm sorry if I'm spoiling the fun of your first purchase, it wasn't my intention. As I wrote in another comment, these 250g Umicore bars are fantastic, they're just shockingly expensive on this side of the Atlantic.  I really recognize my 2011 self in your comments. I wanted pretty bars stacked neatly in a pretty safe. Once the novelty of stacking wore off, I really regretted wasting so much money on huge premiums. I wish someone would have told me this when I started stacking. It's possible to have just as much fun buying more affordable silver. Finding silver that normally carries a premium for spot or even under spot feels incredible! It's also very rewarding to fill plastic tubes with American Silver Eagles a few coins at a time as finances allow. You can stack them very neatly. A monster box contains 25 tubes of 20 coins for a total of 500 ozt of pure silver. You could buy an empty monster box and empty tubes and make it your goal to fill it!  If I were you, the first thing I'd do is create a spreadsheet in Google Docs to record all of your purchases. Mine calculates automatically the number of ounces of gold and silver that I own, the total I spent, the worth of my stack at spot, the average price per ounce of gold and silver that I paid, the average premium I paid and a few other things. It's very satisfying to be in full control of your stack."

It's on my night stand and I often take it in hand just to hold it, these bars have the perfect weight and form factor. May I ask how much you paid for it and where you bought it?

Silverbugs,3ao4wq,losthumans,4,Mon Jun 22 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"I mainly collect coins rather than bullion, so this answer is probably going to have way more detail to it than you could ever want.   Some of the labels that are different colors are that way because every few years, the major grading services change labels. For instance, PCGS used to have green labels, then blue, then lighter blue. So a coin in a green label might have been graded 20 years ago, whereas a lighter blue label might be last year.  First Strike is a PCGS designation that means that the coin was struck (and submitted) within 30 days of the start of the year.  Early Release is an NGC designation that means the same thing as PCGS's First Strike.   Purple NGC slabs means that it's a details grade  Gold label (for PCGS) means that it's in their registry. That's pretty cool, and it means that PCGS has a picture of that coin as an example.   In terms of ANACS slabs, the old white ones are generally worth a premium. However, the newer blue or yellow slabs are often off by a few points and are not worth as much.  Slabs with people's signatures on it are a thing. For instance, John Mercanti's signature is on a whole bunch of slabs. He was the chief engraver at the mint for a while and designed a whole bunch of coins, including the ASE. A coin with his signature is kind of cool, but only if you know who he is. For instance, PCGS puts a coin with his signature on it at about 2 or 3X what it would be without.  Outside of NGC, PCGS, and ANACS, I wouldn't touch other slabbing companies' coins. I made the mistake of buying a 1964 Jefferson nickle slabbed at MS-70 by SCGS. The nickle is pretty dinged up; nowhere near uncirculated. I am also the proud owner of a 1936 Buffalo nickle in a 1931 S holder slabbed by INB. Relatively cheep mistakes, but I've learned my lesson.   I guess the long and the short of it is that when you buy a coin, pay for the coin and not the slab. As you said, a lot of this feels like it echoes the beenie baby craze of 20 years ago and that's because it is the same thing. I hope this helps a bit."
Silverbugs,3ao4wq,zubatman4,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"Thank you for such a detailed reply, this makes total sense. The whole buy the coin not the slab idea seems spot on (pun intended). I also never thought about the first strikes being ""crisper"" than later strikes, still not 100% sure I think that's a big deal for standard bullion (particularly for designs that never change) but to each their own.  So theoretically do these hold their value? If I were to pay $50-$100 for a graded 2015 ASE would I really get that much back when selling?"
Silverbugs,3ao4wq,zubatman4,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:36:10 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm not a bullion expert. But I would suppose that an ASE with a high grade would be worth more in a slab than raw. But for an ASE, I don't think I could ever justify paying that kind of premium (myself). I might go $25 for a raw ASE. A coin slabbed at MS 70 (if it really is MS 70) will be worth the MS 70 price no matter what. However, if the ASE craze dies out tomorrow, your blue label CAC certified PCGS 2015W PF70 ASE becomes worth spot. Because I don't see that happening any time soon, I'm sure it would hold its value and mature over time. But $100 for a brand new ASE is more than I would ever pay.  I hope this answers your question. Like I said, I'm more interested in coins rather than bullion. I'm okay loosing a few bucks here and there on nice coins and finishing a set.   Also, the PCGS website gives their approximations of what their slabs are worth. This guide is a little high. It also gives the prices for ASEs in almost every grade. I'd check it out. Google PCGS Price Guide."

Silverbugs,3an961,thisismyfist,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:47:12 2015 UTC,"If you ever sell your silver, you will be required to pay taxes on any gains. You need to know what you purchased at so you are paying taxes only on the gains (or in the event of a loss, you can actually deduct the loss)."
Silverbugs,3an961,ryanmercer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:54:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry mate - Ive seen far too many people walk into their local shops and cash out to know better than that.  Some silverbugs are bugs because they specifically see this form of taxation as theft esp. when the risk is entirely on one side.  Consider the world in a deflationary period where prices are dropping and thus, the dollar itself is getting stronger.  You take a single dollar and put it in a box someplace for a year. After that you pull it out and find yourself able to buy more pairs of pants than you could a year before with the same amount of money.   Would holding onto a dollar for a year require you to pay taxes on it before you go to spend it? Afterall, you already paid taxes during the year you earned that dollar, so that dollar is yours.  In the sameway that my after tax income is used to buy silver.   Why would I pay taxes on something that required no burden to bear (ie. no bank accounts, no federal deposit insurance, no stock regulation authoritization or anything from society as a whole)?"

And I have always thought about all those ""lost"" premiums, fees and shipping. We could keep it all in the family so to speak  We could be our own ATMs and coin shops.   Every time I buy a coin for 2-3 bucks over spot I think that there is someone selling it way cheaper to someone at a pawnshop or jewelry store.

But my favorite is the dining/coffee locations at the supermarkets. Gives you a chance to count the money and there are a lot of cameras and people and limited egresses in case of robbery. But I was also armed as well. Police parking lot works well. Never had a issue except no shows. Phone numbers limit that dramatically.  Also be careful they dont follow you out. Hang out and drink some coffee. Have a friend with you but have them walk the aisles but watch while you transact.

Our mail system isn't perfect so I have learned to just wait it out. I have had packages sit in one location for a week and then start moving again. Like I said some took 2-3 weeks to arrive but at least I can say I have never had one get lost yet :)

They have really found things they love.  I have one rule. Buy what you like (I think you guys taught us that)  http://imgur.com/SHYzhZo My 9 year old's His tastes are bars and anything ""weird""  Highlights - some vintage englehard bars. Come fairly collectible art bars.  His favorite: his Doge Coin.

He got a red book from a nice coin shop owner. Highlights. A hand poured bar, replica St Gaudens in and some destroyed junk he found in a LCS His favorite:  a gold plated St Gaudens silver coin he found in the generic bin.  He recently added silver and copper versions.   Maybe someday a reall gold one lol.   http://imgur.com/mq99WV8 The 5 year olds.  I'll sum this up in what he recently told a coin shop owner when offered a round to him ""nah, I'm more of a bar kinda guy""  He had the whole store rolling on the floor.  Highlights.  Mother's Day 1974 he likes because of ""mama"".  Heart shaped silver that he likes because he bought it for ""mama"".  His favorite: ""the lion bar"". A Scottsdale silver bar that he constantly reminds the older boys he has and they don't.   This was fun. I asked the boys if they wanted to get out their collections to show off and they said ""nah, we don't need to"". Then they asked why and I said "" you might win some silver"".

A good note to point out is that a good way to identify hairlines from a cleaning is that they will be incuse (scratches on the surface INTO the coin) and by looking at the coin with a loupe you can see that pretty clearly.  You can also see the hairline scratches are on the field of the coin and they continue on the devices, which is another hallmark of a coin that has been damaged from cleaning.  Some people get confused when they see a coin that was struck by a die that was polished by a mint engraver...but that is a whole other story."

I take great care not to do anything which would force me to have to clean a coin but I have often wondered about exactly fingerprints and microfiber cloths, especially when considering buying a coin which is not from a mint tube and considering how others may have handled it.  Thank you."
Silverbugs,3aiuok,Silverlight42,-3,Sun Jun 21 04:51:23 2015 UTC,"I still don't believe a microfiber cloth is going to damage a coin noticably or depreciate it in any way.  Now... It may clean some of the patina off but I don't think it's gonna clean it up to any level that anyone will care about.  note:  not a coin expert, but I am an expert in all things metal.  Usually knives and I do know a fair bit about antiques and shit.  The problem I have with your post here is that there are no before pictures.  How do I accept they were not on the coin beforehand?  Also, do I believe you took a clean microfibre cloth?  no, you probably took a dirty one with large particles that scratched the coin.  Shitpost.   Please redo with proper sequence of photos including the ""clean"" microfiber cloth.   also make sure the cloth is a good one not some shit dollar store thing.  I do believe you could remove those scratches and waterspots entirely with a bit of rubbing.  It doesn't take much... but again -- patina is more important for some pieces."

This lens is exceptionally difficult to use, as it has an unbelievably shallow depth of field, and lighting is very tricky considering how short the focal distance is - holding the camera an inch from the coin really minimizes lighting angle options.   Here are a couple that are at least passable, and clearly show the absence of scratches. http://imgur.com/a/dsCon  Also, if you're that skeptical, I don't think there's anything I can do with the equipment I have available that will prove to you that my microfiber is clean."

The photos you linked just now as fine.   I can see enough detail to understand the scratches were not present.   I just think they would help your case in the post.  I mean sure overall execution could have been more consistent/better done but what you provided is ok.  So thing is... how can a cloth rag damage a coin?  It's still most likely due to large hard particles in the cloth, not the cloth itself.... so that is the important bit.   source on that is important.  anyway, very cool post now.   not shit at all.  and thanks.  just understand it's not likely that the cloth was at fault persay."

The key point is that deposits will then be a liability of the central bank which should make them near risk free - and the bank could still operate on fees, even if it means offering negative interest rates, which is little different than what some government bonds do today.

Silverbugs,3ahww2,hooahreddit,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:14:17 2015 UTC,"This happened to me in 2011. I ended up selling everything except for my best example of each coin. I kept a '96 eagle. I kept the best of each US coinage (barb, merc, etc.) I had and sold the rest of that type. I was still left with a nice stack but it was my numismatic stack that had silver versus my 'silver stack'.   I started buying back in the last year once we were under 20/oz. I hope to repeat history. But I am not sure what my sell price will be. I think if we hit 50 again, it will blow past it. I will probably do what I did last time. Break it into multiple trades. Last time I did 44 and 50. This time i will probably do 4 ways. Part when it hits 45, 50, 75, and a 100. That way if it retreats after 50, I was able to secure my profits."

Silverbugs,3ah8dh,jaymiggy,3,Sat Jun 20 04:04:37 2015 UTC,"That sucks! I have had this happen before and know how you feel. When it happened to me they took thousands. Thankfully the bank took care of the issue. I have no idea how these people got a hold of my information.  I'd also like to take the time to address some interesting information about ShinyBars! ShinyBars is one of the, if not THE most secure bullion site you will find. I am an IT professional in my other life and used my extensive knowledge to beef up the security to levels beyond that of most websites. As of about 2 weeks ago ShinyBars implemented HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security). If you haven't noticed, every page of ShinyBars is now SSL. Previously only the logon, account, order and checkout pages were SSL. What does HSTS do? Its main function is to protect against downgrade attacks. Downgrade attacks are sort of a man-in-the middle attack that takes advantage of the non SSL portion of a website to insert their own SSL and or capture data submitted before it is encrypted.  More information about HSTS here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security  I encourage you all to compare our security to other sites via the Quality SSL Labs tool here: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html  The next upgrade will be to the next gen SHA 2 hashing algorithm. This will be coming over the next year or so."
Silverbugs,3ah8dh,shinybars,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:57:46 2015 UTC,I'm also an IT Security professional.  Let me just say.  Don't be too proud of this technological terror you have constructed.  We are all only as secure as the next Heartbleed bug we haven't found yet.
Silverbugs,3ah8dh,arthropal,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:11:17 2015 UTC,As you know. You can only be as secure as the current technology allows...
Silverbugs,3ah8dh,shinybars,2,Sat Jun 20 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"I don't believe SSL is broken. It is a very high level of encryption when implemented correctly offers the highest level of protection available. With that said, our security mitigates potential issues with SSL. These issues are not necessarily ""with SSL"" but rather a mixed HTTP and HTTPS environment. If you read more about HSTS you will see that it extends beyond our site and into your browser forcing only encrypted communication.  With all of the above stated. We all know about the heartbleed bug. The heartbleed bug its self has been mitigated by all non-bucket shop CA's (Certificate Authorities). This is not to say that there won't be a ""new"" bug in future certs but for now we have what we have to work with in the IT security world. You can only mitigate, re-mediate and attempt to prevent security issues and that can only be achieved via active monitoring and continued education on the latest technology available."

Silverbugs,3agex5,El_Garretto,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:31:56 2015 UTC,"This fucker.  InwoodCoin.  Despite his high feedback, plenty of shady business going on with this seller.  Dig into his increasingly growing negative feedback lately and it tells a tale.  I had an awful experience with them on eBay, and it sounds like you are experiencing the same thing.  ""Shipping Label Created"" it said, but no actual activity at the post office.  A few days after the shipping label was created I e-mailed the seller.  He responded to my message, saying the item shipped despite the evidence to the contrary.  I sent two follow up emails asking for specifics, like when the item was shipped, and how he could confirm this.  He ignored both messages.  The expected arrival date came and went, so I filed an item not received claim through eBay and requested a refund.  These requests state that the seller has 3 days to resolve the issue, and if he doesn't you can ask eBay to step in.  Two days after I filled my claim, then the package was magically ""picked up"" by the post office.  I now knew he lied to me earlier.  The package came, and everything was in order.  But it took damn near 2 weeks for him to actually ship the items I purchased and he lied about it.    But wait, there's more shadiness.  I left two negative feedbacks.  A week later he sent me a $50 payment on PayPal (not a refund, but a direct payment), followed by a request asking me to revise my feedback.  Still lying, he claimed the outrageous shipping time was not in his control, but failed to offer any specifics.  After a phone call to eBay customer support reporting his attempted bribery, I declined the request.  Luckily, there is something you can do.  Since the estimated arrival was today, tomorrow you can go to the resolution center , and click ""Didn't recieve an Item"", and ""open a request"".  File an item not received complaint.  I'd ask for a refund.  This will force his hand.  He must either ship or refund within 3 days or you can ask eBay to step in.  If eBay has to step in, they give you your money back, and then debit him for reimbursement later.    This seller is awful.  I'd recommend anyone reading this to take a pass if you see him on eBay.  Prices are good, service is awful.  He is slow to ship, and ignores messages until absolutely forced to respond, and then will lie without offering any specific information.  Avoid this one..."

Safety trade (gold,  and to lesser extent silver). and 2. Industrial uses (platinum, palladium, copper, etc.).  Gold shot up, and silver followed due to: fears about economic collapse after 2007, fears about hyper inflation due to all the massive pumping, and fears of government shutdown over budget crisis.  All of those factors have subsided.  the bailouts worked to sustain the system, and we have had stabilization.  ... BUT... that stabilization has not reached hyper growth due to all the easy money and as such inflation is not really an issue, particularly as other commodity prices have fallen, from agriculture to energy.  The budget crisis was solved and we are on the right path.  The ""hot air"" in the safety trade is coming out of the balloon, and major institutions know it, hence why it has gone nowhere the past few years.   The catalyst for future growth will come from the millenials, once they are in the work force, buying stuff and economy is recovered and when all of the easy money in the system will start causing concerns for massive inflation.

How does it save Texas money on fees storing its gold in another depository?  You mean the one which is already established and houses all of the U.S. gold.  How does creating another depository with another staff and more guards cut costs?  It just shifts them inside its own state where it can cling to mediocre returns from taxes paid on these salaries.  And it can continue to lose the same amount of more as storing gold isn't free anywhere.  That being said, the Fed Reserve doesn't post MORE guards and MORE staff to cover Texas, it already has massive facilities and $1B worth of gold is a relatively small sum.  This will probably cost Texas more money afaic and is a sham against the public.  Not surprised you could sell this in Texas though."

For my rounds, I prefer the ones that have the reverse just like that actual coin that it represents not the generic background like a lot of them have. This leaves out a lot of the cheap copper. I may be different but I don't mind a premium. I don't stack it for an investment. Someone has to pay for those high quality plastic tubes."
Silverbugs,3adlub,ScratchMax,4,Fri Jun 19 06:45:57 2015 UTC,"Buy physical gold and silver, not ETFs.  Hold it yourself. Some coins cost more than others of the same weight due to rarity.  Starting out, I'd recommend buying recent or current year government issued bullion coins.  For gold, I'd suggest American Eagles, American Buffaloes, and Canadian Maples.  In the U.S., these are the easiest coins to buy and sell.  For silver, I'd suggest American Eagles and Canadian Maples. Yes, I'd suggest owning both gold and silver.  Gold tends to have a steadier price, which can feel comforting.  Silver's price bounces more erratically, which can be both exciting (when it goes up) and alarming (when it goes down). If you are buying 22k gold coins such as American Eagles, you can just stack them in tubes like this:   http://www.apmex.com/product/18428/1-oz-gold-american-eagle-coin-tubes-slightly-used  After all, that's what the U.S. Treasury does.  For 24k gold, such as Gold Buffaloes and Maples, it's best to store them in air-tight capsules like this:  http://www.amazon.com/Air-Tite-Black-Ring-Holders-Coins/dp/B002EKEHO4  For convenience, you can stack these in plastic tubes, if you want:  http://www.air-tites.com/storage-tube-coin-holders.htm#.VYPpREaM6_Y  I see there was one suggestion to buy locally and I love the idea of that, if prices are good.  Where I am, buying gold locally is a little more expensive ($10-20 more for a 1 oz. gold coin) than online and buying silver locally is much more expensive than online.  Before walking into a local coin shop, I'd suggest perusing some of the more popular and reliable online dealers:  http://www.providentmetals.com/ http://www.apmex.com/ http://www.jmbullion.com/  Typically, if you pay with a paper check or eCheck, my experience is that these dealers are cheaper than buying locally but you have to wait 1-3 weeks to get your metal.  Especially when you're starting out, that wait can seem intolerable.  Paying with a credit card usually shortens the wait to a week or less but costs more.  Good luck!"

Silverbugs,3adlub,arthropal,3,Sun Jun 21 09:00:38 2015 UTC,"I'd even take a look at platinum right now.  It's trading lower than gold, which is not a historical norm.  Platinum, like palladium and iridium, and silver, are in much heavier use in scientific, medical and industrial uses than gold.  Gold has value because it's rare and we all want it.  Silver and the platinum group metals have that, but they also have a strong market for practical uses.  Gold will retain value because of it's status as thousands of years of use as a storage of wealth.  Industrial metals may also go up in value as demand for them increases.  Platinum is in widespread use as a catalyst to clean up emissions.  As China and India get up to speed with emissions controls similar to the US and Canada did in the 80s and 90s, you'll see demand for automotive emissions control, as well as industrial smokestack scrubbers skyrocket, and these make heavy use of platinum.  Also, hydrogen fuel cell tech, if/when it takes off, contains a lot of platinum.  Silver is used for solar energy applications due to it being extremely conductive and reflective."

Silverbugs,3adlub,dclctcd,2,Fri Jun 19 14:37:04 2015 UTC,"I like to buy locally, but you can get a fair price from r/pmsforsale. You will pay a premium over spot for gold coins. Bullion is closer to spot. I buy gold and silver. When I can afford one or the other. I like junk silver (circulated dimes, quarters, halves. Pre-1965) because you can get more silver for your dollar (closer to spot), and if the dollar does collapse, you won't always want to spend an ozt of silver. You might only need to spend a few grams. The old coins are easily recognizable for there silver content. As far as storage. The first thing to remember is to tell no one what you have. Put your coins in a coin tube and find a safe place. If you buy numismatic coins you will need to be more careful, but don't start there. Start with the junk, generic rounds and bars, and silver eagles. Start small, ask questions, and watch vidieos."

Silverbugs,3adlub,blevdawgAg47,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:14:04 2015 UTC,"No one addressed this point yet, so yes, some pieces are more expensive than others despite weighing the same because they have, as you suggest, a more attractive design, but also sometimes because they come from a more trusted source. Coins that were issued by a government are more trusted than generic rounds most of the time, but there are generic rounds that are so well designed and finished that they can be more expensive.  The difference between spot price (which is the current price for a virtual troy ounce of the metal you're considering) and the price of the piece of metal is called ""premium"". Most pieces of physical metal carry at least a small premium, sometimes it can even be as high as 20% for pieces that don't have numismatic value.  Coins with numismatic value can be worth multiples of the spot price, but this is a whole different realm than stacking precious metals.  You will generally be able to get the premium back if you sell something well, but you should still do your best to buy as close from spot price as possible.  If I were you, I would start with the basics: gold and silver coins issued by the US government. I'm French, so I collect French gold, but for silver you can buy rolls of American Silver Eagles from trustworthy dealers such as the ones listed in the sidebar. You can also try to find good deals on junk silver, which are 90% pure silver coins issued by the US government before 1964. You can also buy bars if you prefer to buy heavier pieces, the premiums are generally lower on larger bars, but they can be harder to resell since they cost a lot of money. If silver went to $100 a troy ounce, a bar weighing 1000 troy ounces would cost $100,000.  The best way to store your precious metals is to invest in a very good safe and hide it as well as possible in your house. This is expensive, so you should only invest in a proper safe if you're committed. Some people also keep their precious metals at the bank in a personal safe, but there's a saying that goes ""If you don't hold it, you don't own it."". Use your best judgement, but don't waste money on a subpar safe.  I keep all of my silver in mint tubes and store them inside of Pelican cases. I then store the Pelican cases in my underground safe. I only keep the Pelican case I'm filling currently in the safe in my bedroom. Some people keep their bars in the original packaging and some put all of their coins in individual plastic capsules, but I think that the tubes are perfectly adequate.  You don't absolutely need gloves to handle your bullion since it doesn't have numismatic value, but it's always easier so sell a coin that looks as new than a damaged one. If you hold them by their edges, you should be fine, even without gloves."

Silverbugs,3adlub,blevdawgAg47,-2,Fri Jun 19 13:58:49 2015 UTC,"Unless you're converting $100K+ to pm's, I would suggest you consider the Gold/Silver Ratio.

Silver is mined at about 10:1 ratio to Gold and is consumed at a much faster rate than gold because of industrial AND investor demand."
Silverbugs,3adlub,e30kgk,5,Sat Jun 20 09:16:24 2015 UTC,"I would strongly suggest you ignore the gold/silver ratio. It's a completely arbitrary indicator of an imaginary quantity. It doesn't represent any concrete thing, because there's no direct link between the price of gold and the price of silver. People like to draw conclusions based on the fact that the ratio ""should"" be 16:1, 10:1, or some other number - but this is a faulty assumption because the historical conditions that pegged gold and silver prices to these ratios have no bearing on the present or the future.   Silver is mined at about 10:1 ratio to Gold and is consumed at a much faster rate than gold because of industrial AND investor demand.   Scarcity and price don't directly correlate like that."
Silverbugs,3adlub,blevdawgAg47,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:31:11 2015 UTC,"Are you saying that supply and demand have no effect on price? I agree that the paper price is an arbitrary number and does not reflect fundamentals. Which is why silver is artificially undervalued and presents a good opportunity for accumulation. Even if you like gold better, I'd still be accumulating silver at 74:1 to trade for twice as much gold at 37:1 sometime in the future."
Silverbugs,3adlub,bigmeancow,3,Fri Jun 19 13:13:38 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying that you can't take two completely disparate commodities, and say there's n times more supply for this one than the other, so the price for the other should be n times higher.   I'm not saying that the paper price is an arbitrary number - I'm saying the gold/silver ratio is. The paper price is driven by the markets, and is the true value of a bulk commodity. Bulk silver is worth $16.16/oz. No more, no less. It might be worth more tomorrow, an hour from now, 5 minutes from now - but right now, bulk silver is worth $16.16/oz, incontrovertibly.   However, the gold/silver ratio is useless because it is an attempt to quantify a relationship that does not actually exist. Yes, gold and silver often trend together, but they are two different commodities with two different markets. The gold/silver ratio is about as useful as the oil/tea ratio, or even the Marlboros/Cheetos ratio.    I'd still be accumulating silver at 74:1 to trade for twice as much gold at 37:1 sometime in the future.   If you could say with certainty that an ounce of silver would be worth 1/37th of an ounce of gold at any point in our lifetimes, you'd be right. However, you can't say that, and I don't think one can even make a compelling case to say that it's likely to happen. This is just as reasonable as saying you may as well stack gold, because at some point, the Gold Fairy is going to come around and write checks for $1 million to everyone who owns gold, just for being a good sport. Or that you should stack gold because eventually, the government is going to confiscate all the silver, but will leave the gold alone. Or any of another myriad harebrained predictions based on wild-ass speculation."

Silverbugs,3abd4r,Jalex5,2,Fri Jun 19 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"Failing Greece is a threat to the stability of a united Europe, and hence the Euro, so I would expect lots of flows into US assets (primarily bonds), and an increase in the value of the dollar, and a drop in the price of PMs.  That's a guess.

Silverbugs,3abd4r,Jalex5,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:06:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for your thoughts.  Seems like you and /u/chilton1776 above both see a drop in PM prices as the more likely outcome (if they leave the EU altogether?).  Interesting..
Silverbugs,3abd4r,Soupdumpling81,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"I have thought about this a lot. On one hand Greece is the weakest economy in the EU and by them leaving the EU would be stronger but on the other hand if Greece can leave/be forced out of the EU, Germany can also, and if anyone wants to leave the EU its Germany.   With the first scenario if Greece leaves the Euro should strengthen thus making the dollar worth less and golds value go up. I would expect to see a $100 - $50 swing in gold over the course of a month. With the second scenario if Greece does leave the EU it is guaranteed to default on its debts. When this happens gold tends to go up anyway, but this fear would probably make the dollar worth more and thus gold prices go down. With this scenario I would expect gold to drop $100 - $200 in a month. The third scenario that I have thought of is Greece stays in the EU, with the other countries angrily fronting the money to save them. If this happens the Euro gains major ground against the dollar. I could see $100-$200 an ounce in gold swing in a month in this scenario. A rare forth scenario is Greece leaves the EU and Germany soon follows. If this happens the Euro crashes and the dollar skyrockets. I would expect to see gold drop $200-$500 an ounce in a month. This is very unlikely, but Germany has a lot of angry citizens that feel they have been responsible and have had to bail out the weaker countries that were negligent with their economy.    I gave my estimations with gold, its a lot easier to anticipate gold movement when compared to silver. Silver I would expect to follow but has a bigger range of prices and its more like throwing darts to just guess."

Also, be aware that most garage sale goers are checking your stuff out with a pocket full of change (and probably not 90% junk silver).  They are looking for deals, and most who ask about it will be very uninformed on silver, so you will be answering a lot of questions.  I would show only some ""junk"" and some very low premium stuff.  If you get a real silverbug, and they ask about anything with higher premiums, then pull them out from hiding.  As for prices: I would say you would want to price junk at around 14.5-15x Face Value, and generic about $2.50 over spot.  That way you have some wiggle room when the haggling starts."

Silverbugs,3ab28l,Ag47baby,2,Thu Jun 18 21:18:43 2015 UTC,There are some coin bars.  You could argue a rcm bar isn't generic.  Define generic how you will I suppose.
Silverbugs,3ab28l,XxElvisxX,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:14:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've been told by shops locally that they consider RCM, Engelhard, and JM to be premium brands and everything else is generic.

Silverbugs,3ab28l,Slave_to_Logic,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:04:26 2015 UTC,I was talking about selling to my LCS.  They actually carry very little in the way of bars.  But they do buy and they pay a little more ($0.15?) per ounce for these brands than for other brands.
Silverbugs,3ab28l,Ag47baby,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:45:28 2015 UTC,"they pay a little more ($0.15?) per ounce      With spot at $1202.00 I consider an extra fifteen cents to still be ""at spot."""
Silverbugs,3ab28l,Slave_to_Logic,2,Fri Jun 19 12:51:37 2015 UTC,"I apologize.  I was getting posts mixed up.  When I talked about the $0.15, I was talking about silver, not gold.  I've never sold gold bars to my LCS.  They pay spot for gold Eagles and Maples."
Silverbugs,3ab28l,Ag47baby,0,Fri Jun 19 13:05:01 2015 UTC,I've been seeing deals for the Fortunas quite regularly this year for $19.99 over spot. I'd say selling at spot is a good deal as it would be a quick/easy/no problems to sell at a LCS.  Never underestimate the convenience and peace of mind from this kind of transaction.
Silverbugs,3abbql,wildruler,3,Thu Jun 18 18:38:43 2015 UTC,"$1 face value WORN 90% silver coins = 0.715 Troy Ounce silver You can use an combination of any 90% coins.  So yes, $1.40 face value is one troy ounce."

Silverbugs,3abbql,SockMonkey1128,2,Thu Jun 18 21:37:07 2015 UTC,Is that true? If so that means 14 pre-'64 dimes is the same weight as 4 pre-'64 dimes plus 4 pre-'64 quarters.  Does the weight of 4 quarters = the weight of 10 dimes?
Silverbugs,3abbql,PrincessPi,3,Thu Jun 18 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"Correct, very seldom is junk silver sold by exact weight since each coin will be worn differently.  Its usually sold based on face value."

Silverbugs,3abbql,myfirstproof,2,Thu Jun 18 20:54:39 2015 UTC,You could post your trade at /r/pmsforsale.  I think you'll have better results than Craigslist.  Just my opinion...
Silverbugs,3abbql,e30kgk,2,Thu Jun 18 21:34:28 2015 UTC,I thought about that but I also thought that on /r/pmsforsale I would have to pay shipping and if I found a deal on Craigslist maybe I could find somebody that would do a straight trade ounce for ounce.
Silverbugs,3abbql,RanardUSMC,3,Thu Jun 18 19:22:56 2015 UTC,"There might be shipping costs using /r/pmsforsale, but they are negotiable.   You could always try and if you don't like it go back to CL."
Silverbugs,3abbql,Disabled_gentleman,2,Thu Jun 18 19:51:43 2015 UTC,"By convention, yes, $1.40 FV of circulated US 90% contains 1 oz of pure silver. This is based on the convention of treating $1 FV as containing .715 ozt silver.   These are not precise numbers at all, but it doesn't really matter, because that's how these coins are handled in the market. For example, you can't expect to sell junk silver for more because you weigh it up and show that it contains .725 ozt/FV. In my experience, the .715 ozt estimate is a little on the low side for anything but Barbers, but again, totally irrelevant.   Why on earth would you trade $7 FV for a generic 5 oz bar? $7 FV is currently worth about $94.50 (based on 13.5x FV pricing, which seems to be pretty typical), or $18.90/ozt. I'd put a value of about $87 on a 5 oz bar (~$1/oz premium).   Those ads offering to buy junk at spot are lowball offers looking to prey on the naive. Junk 90% carries a decent premium. Generic 5 oz bars don't. You're better off keeping your junk."
Silverbugs,3abilx,Stone_One,5,Thu Jun 18 19:28:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, people generally speak in terms of spot price plus a premium.  Generally, for eagles, the premium is at least $3 dollars per coin over spot price.  Sometimes a little more, sometimes (rarely) a little less.  Just look for the big sellers on Ebay such as APMEX and wait for a good sale (lately a roll of 20 has been in the $389 range).   When purchasing online, you can usually find free shipping (JM, Apmex, most of the big ones).  Check for this on the ebay listing (it's usually free shipping)."

For some of the smaller sellers, if you reach out to them and ask them to change their listing from Bullion, to Collectibles, it will give you the eBay bucks with the purchase.  This can be done by just editing the listing and saving, which I can verify as I sell on eBay a good bit."

The Libertads, I would try to get them in the $420-440 range if possible.    For the Engelhards, I would ask $30-35 on the 1/2(a little over $40 seems to be the going rate on those), probably around $25 for the 1/4, and about $15-18 on the 1/10.  Or see if he will give you a package deal for the full set of them at $70-75.  I think those would be fair to the seller, and should be a little cheaper than you can find elsewhere. If the seller has more than one set, I would love to get a set of those also.  PM me if you think that might be possible."

PMSforsale does sell a lot of hard to find stuff lower than you'd find anywhere else, so you probably did get a pretty good deal on yours, but since these are more of a collectible, my valuation could be a little high. The real range may be in the $25-35 range."

Both are 'on sale' at apmex (but I've been eyeing them both for a while, and I'm pretty sure they've been this price for at least as long as spot has been in the $16's).  There a quite a few in this series, but I think these 2 are the cheapest. If the others go 'on sale' I will probably pick up some of them. It's definitely a set I would like to complete.

From the pictures and videos I've examined, someone who isn't very familiar with the ASE and who doesn't have a real one or a high resolution picture at hand for comparison could easily be scammed. Having a relatively precise scale and a caliper protects you for now, but it won't last.  I'm quite sure that with a few more years of practice they'll find the perfect alloy and refine their designs to a level where a visual inspection and standard measuring tools won't suffice to determine authenticity. All they have to do is meet the tolerances of the US Mint. The US Mint will probably have to add security features to its bullion fairly soon.  Mark my words, in 10 years all serious collectors will own a simplified, cheaper version of an XRF gun (spectrometer) and it will common to drill minuscule holes in bars and in the edges of older rounds and coins with a specialized drill to collect core samples."
Silverbugs,3a7hay,dclctcd,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:06:48 2015 UTC,You buy SAE for fungibility. When it's time to sell they are recognized. Most people will fall for a fake but your lcs has handled so many eagles it is very unlikely they would be tricked. Which is why people mostly find fakes when they go to sell.

While this is an oft-cited explanation for their premium, I think this is completely trivial. The list of sources I believe when they stamp a product ""1 oz .999 silver"" is pretty damn long and not terribly exclusive - and it's a totally binary status. The market either trusts them or doesn't, there's really no ""more trusted"" and ""less trusted"" when it comes down to it. Any government minted round or private mint makes the list, with very few exceptions.   In fact, off the top of my head, I can't think of any mint, large or small, public or private, that I have cause to question the validity of their markings on a silver product. Out of the literally thousands of silver items I have owned, I can think of only one that ended up being significantly different than marked - some hideous 3 oz medal made in the 70s by some defunct mint that only weighed 2.7 oz."

Type in silver 69, or silver 70 in Ebay search and 97 out of 100 will be silver eagles.

Silverbugs,3a71oa,3rd-Grade-Spelling,2,Sat Jun 20 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"Everything is fluid, and often not in lock-step.  Silver price (amount of dollars you pay for it) often spikes before the US dollar value (amount it will buy) drops.  The asynchronous nature of the commodity and currency markets means that there are almost always periods of time before market correction kicks in, and thus the buying power of silver, gold, US dollars, oil, etc wobble about.   Overall, given large enough time scales, with spikes and dips averaged out, precious metals will retain buying power.  On a small scale, it's extremely noisy, especially silver."

Now is either a great time or a horrible time to invest in silver, however it's better than the last 5 years, and I personally can't see it dropping significantly (I see $11 as absolute terrible bottom, but doubt it will hit that)   I would make sure you have 6-12 months of liquid funds available before you invest significantly into silver, I would also recommend paying down any debt.

Lucky, you are buying at the low in the market place, silver might go lower but you're buying at a good time.  Precious metal (physical, in your possession) has no third party risk, no taxes to be paid, it doesn't go bad, and you can always find a buyer.  Silver, its good stuff.  (heh, i think i will make that my motto.)  Will add this also,  The most electrically conductive element is silver, silver also has the highest thermal conductivity of any element and the highest light reflectance.   Silver is also anti-bacterial;  The antimicrobial properties of silver have been known to cultures all around the world for many centuries. The Phonecians stored water and other liquids in silver coated bottles to discourage contamination by microbes (Wikipedia: Silver). Silver dollars used to be put into milk bottles to keep milk fresh, and water tanks of ships and airplanes that are ""silvered"" are able to render water potable for months (Saltlakemetals.com). In 1884 it became a common practice to administer drops of aqueous silver nitrate to newborn's eyes to prevent the transmission of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from infected mothers to children during childbirth (Silvestry-Rodriguez et al., 2007).  So much more..., its industrial uses are endless.  People tend to save gold, but use silver, there will always be a demand for silver."

However it's only legal tender coins you can get for that price. So I pretty much have to forget all about bars, and rounds. Luckily my earnings online have made it possible for me to buy some bars from Apmex without it costing me much out of pocket. Most stackers here are from the US, and I think they take it a little for granted how easy their stacking is compared to everyone else. Like that privateer coin, it's FUCKING NICE! But guess what? I can't get it! First of all, they don't even ship to Europe, but I would also be charged VAT on them.

Silverbugs,3a50q1,tacopwnsyou,5,Wed Jun 17 07:33:11 2015 UTC,I work for the USPS. The only things that receive special care during sorting and transport are express mail pieces and registered mail pieces. Blue insured (require signature/more expensive) and black insured (do not require signature/less expensive) get the same treatment as all other packages up until delivery. Then only the blues are different. If its worth it to you I would suggest sending it registered. No one fucks with a registered.   Ninja edit: also wanted to clear up a misconception. The reason no one screws with a registered (it must be domestic. International means next to nothing) is because the person handling it has signed responsibility for it and they alone are personally and financially responsible for it until it is either signed over to someone else or delivered.

So you still do retain the value, and even if the value drops all the way you'll technically still have at least a dollar.  For me, I'm holding until I absolutely need it.  If I don't then my kids have a decent stepping stone for their future, or lots of precious depending on your mood."

Silverbugs,3a3tly,Slave_to_Logic,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:03:32 2015 UTC,"It may actually help some people be able to tell the difference between natural and artificially toned coins.   This is a great point.  I've always been on the fence about whether it's a ""good"" thing to artificially tone something regardless of its category of bullion or numismatic.  On one hand, the fantastic colors are so beautiful.  On the other, it's not natural.  An ignorant buyer could pay a hefty premium and be left with something worth quite a bit less than the genuine article.  And I think this is the part that we're all worried about; that someone could pay more for something they think is genuine that is actually worth ""less"" because of the artificial toning.  But security by obscurity is rarely a good method of security as criminals are very often many steps beyond where most of us are ""comfortable"" and so upstanding and responsible toners/doctors can provide a service much like upstanding and responsible hackers do for the tech industry.  Don't be afraid of it.  Be knowledgeable and/or get advice from someone else who is knowledgeable before wading into something you don't understand (and losing your tail on a bad ""investment."")"

Thanks everyone!   Anything secure enough to trust nearly $20K worth of valuables in is strong enough to hold 70 lbs.   If you diversify into other stuff, space requirements go up because you'll want to keep stuff organized, which leads to wasted space, plus stuff of different dimensions just doesn't stack as well. Speaking from the experience of someone I know, a diverse collection of ~600 oz is a tight fit in a ~4.5 cubic foot safe.  However, if you go the boring route of 1000 ASEs, you're looking at 50 tubes. A tube is 3"" tall by 1.75"" square, and they fit together very nicely. Each tube has a volume of 9.19 in3, or .00532 ft3 - or about .266 ft3 for 50 of them. This fits easily in pretty much any safe.  Basically, space constraints aren't going to be the limitation here. The key is to find something secure enough to trust. My suggestion with a stack of 1000 ASEs would be a safety deposit box - safer than anything you could feasibly put in your house, cheap (~$50/year in that size), cheap to insure, etc. It's not like a collection where you want to be able to access it frequently."

Silverbugs,3a2b2y,Peterboring,3,Tue Jun 16 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"It all depends on multiple factors, but typically your top choices would be:  `1. /r/pmsforsale  This is the preferred place for most silverbugs. It is convenient, you can typically get a decent price (buying OR selling). Only drawback is that there is currently no recourse if someone gets shady or steals yo shit (you send them money but they never send the product). There are systems in place to try to lessen this (shinybot and /r/pmsfeedback), but the possibility is still there.  `2. Your local coin shop   All depends on where you live and what coin shops (if any) are near you. They typically get new stuff all the time because their business is all about turnover. I personally havent had much luck with this option, but thats just because the LCS near me stinks.   `3. eBay   Yes, they take 10% off the top, but sometimes its worth it. I've sold a few silver pieces on there and made a good profit. A bit risky as a seller, because there are always people out there who might try to defraud you by saying they never received the package, or it was empty upon receipt of the package, in which case ebay will side with them and debit the refund from your account - you really have no recourse.   `4. precious metal dealers   typically how they do it is you talk to them, tell them what you have, you agree upon a price, ship them your silver, they verify it and then cut you a check. Only bad thing is that typically they buy at a percentage on the dollar of what its worth. I have priced out a few different things to sell to them and have been offered peanuts (some people will prefer to go this route though, and it might just have been the type of silver i was trying to sell...dunno)   `5. Pawn shops   meh. its a pawn shop. they typically buy under spot (typically because the people who are there to sell stuff are in a tight spot and have to take their offer).   anyways, hope that helps."
Silverbugs,3a2b2y,satirical_whit,2,Tue Jun 16 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"I have a couple of questions:   Lots of people recommend the pmsforsale.  Is there a limit to this recommendation?  That is, is it still a good recommendation if somebody wanted to sell 100 oz.?  500 oz.?  1000 oz.?   You said that precious metal dealers ""typically...buy at a percentage on the dollar of what it's worth"".  Doesn't this depend on what you're selling?  I own mostly bars and ASEs.  The buy prices I see for these on APMEX, Provident, etc. are quite fair, not a percentage on the dollar of what they're worth.  Did you have some other form of silver in mind?"
Silverbugs,3a2b2y,Ag47baby,2,Tue Jun 16 20:13:29 2015 UTC,"As to the size, you can sell larger amounts of stuff, its all about trust. Eg. Do you trust this person enough to take $5000 from you and then send you the silver? Etc.   For the selling to the dealers, ive only checked it out once or twice, and im pretty sure it was on semi-numi stuff. Stuff they had but was ""out of stock"".

Silverbugs,3a2b2y,nordicminy,2,Tue Jun 16 23:47:21 2015 UTC,"I believe you but if somebody wanted to cash out their silver position because prices jumped and they had 1000+ ounces to unload quickly, I don't think it's the right forum."
Silverbugs,3a2b2y,Ag47baby,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:01:27 2015 UTC,True but I think you could do several hundred ounces there for slightly under spot over a couple weeks. But yea I understand the point.
Silverbugs,3a2b2y,nordicminy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:26:47 2015 UTC,"1) It depends on what you have and the price you want to get for it. I've seen people move hundreds of ounces pretty damn quick on /r/pmsforsale to multiple buyers. There was also a case not long ago where one user met up in person with another user to purchase a few hundred or so FV of junk silver. There are also other forums out there where the average transaction size is much larger than /r/pmsforsale, if you needed to move a large quantity quickly.  2) On the typical near-spot items, the spread is usually pretty low. For example, APMEX is buying 2015 ASEs at $17.75 right now - you're really only missing out on $1 or so each by selling to APMEX rather than in a private sale. However, this is not the case on higher-premium items. I had several Lunar Series I 10 oz pieces that I was having trouble finding homes for not terribly long ago - I contacted several retailers to see if they were interested. APMEX's offer was the best, offering $250-300 each for them, but was still only about half of what I ended up getting for them when I finally sold them privately."
Silverbugs,3a2b2y,e30kgk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:04:04 2015 UTC,"I don't buy any high premium silver, only bullion.  The prices I've seen from Provident and APMEX have been good for the items I have.

Silverbugs,3a2b2y,HaroldWS,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:46:16 2015 UTC,"If you are uncomfortable with /r/pmsforsale try to establish a relationship with a local coin store if you have not.  My LCS is perhaps the best place to sell for me because he pays nearly what he sells at.  He will pay above spot for government minted coins and spot for generics.  As far as gold goes, he paid me $1210 cash (spot @1175) and would sell at $1225 for a 2015 gold eagle I needed to sell (thanks, ebay 10% off coupon!).  Shops like that with low buy-sell margins are really good to hang around in general too.  If you can find a place like that, you'll get almost as much money as you would selling on /r/pmsforsale and it's often cash-in-hand.  Again, I'd still try /r/pmsforsale first based on the high amount of user recommendations here.  People here love buying from other community members!"
Silverbugs,3a2b2y,Spence97,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:52:06 2015 UTC,"I sold my entire stack last year and did so quickly and got fair prices. I did it on Craigslist because I had bought and sold on there before and never had a problem. I put in the listing that we would be meeting in the parking lot of a local police station of my choosing. This sets the tone from the get go and generally scares away the dirtbags. My local PD just happens to be next to the local library so I had a nice quiet place to sit down and talk with the buyer and let them examine everything thoroughly. The transactions, it was two buyers, went flawlessly.   If you're hesitant about doing craigslist, you can always take it a step further and use the lobby of the PD. Lots of PDs have a real open door policy with Craigslist because it helps eliminate problems from the get go.  Lastly, you probably wanna know about price received. I received spot on all my ASEs and slightly more on all my junk silver. I thought this to be fair because I didn't have to go through the hassle of messaging /r/pmsforsale users back and forth, waiting for payment, and then scrambling to ship everything. Similarly, I'd have had to have done the same thing with eBay. Also, when compared with local pawn and metal dealers, I did great because they never pay spot on anything because that's how they make their money. I received cash in hand, same day, with no problems. Craigslist is one of the few outlets that lets you do that and if you do it like I did, you have nothing to worry about."

Silverbugs,3a2b2y,aanvals,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:39:29 2015 UTC,One as of yet unspoken option is you could sell it at a coin show.     Getting a dealer table costs somewhere between $100 and $500 depending on amenities and you sell to the public and other dealers for the duration of the show.      If you have enough to unload that is likely your most profitable option.

Often times those are a rip-off and they'll be advertised as from an ""unsearched lot"" of ""pre-1965 silver"" and be mostly 35% silver war nickels AKA a very poor deal.  Just go for the lots that show you what you're buying.  For eBay purposes anything <15x FV (as in $1 face value in coin for $15) isn't half bad when you're buying small quantities.  Not worth fussing over a couple bucks and that is as low of a premium as you'll get on eBay, where generic silver sells at over $20/oz at times lol  You could probably get $3-4 face value or as other suggested a provident privateer round or a 2 ounce libertad, both of which are also very nice coins!"

Silverbugs,3a2yoo,soundofprofound,4,Tue Jun 16 20:37:23 2015 UTC,"First lets get something clear. Silver and gold are money, a store of value, wealth that you can hold. That being said, your mentality as a new stacker should be that silver is savings, not an investment (unless you are dealing with futures contracts).  On to your question. You should start with government produced bullion coins such as American Eagles, guaranteed for weight and purity (seriously though, counterfeiters get a nice visit from the Secret Service and probably the FBI.). These are one troy ounce apiece and legal tender for one US dollar. You can also buy 90 percent silver (also known as ""junk silver"" or ""constitutional silver"") which are dimes quaters and half dollars minted up to and including the year 1964. A dollar face value of these is about .715 ounce of silver (or about $1.40 face value for one troy ounce) and each coin's face value indicates what fraction of that amount it has in silver content.  This is a decent cost effective way to get fractional silver at a per troy ounce price comparable to that of silver eagles.   I would also suggest getting yourself a quarter ounce gold eagle somewhere down the line to whet your appetite for gold.  As far as dealers go, check the FAQ in the sidebar for that (APMEX is good and Gainnesville coins is good, especially for large orders). Find the coin shops in your area and make friends with the staff."
Silverbugs,3a2yoo,icespout,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:51:44 2015 UTC,".... this.  What is your reason for stacking in the first place?    If savings, as icespout pointed out above, then find what you would like more... some folks just want to get as much as they can and buy old bars, others like coins.  Personally, I love collecting silver bullion coins from around the world.  If you are buying this because you think it is an investment.... well, do you know that Silver has been a REALLY SHITTY investment over the last few years?  From 2011, it was probably one of the worst investments you could of made.  So if you are buying it for the purposes of an investment, do your research first so you do not blame yourself.  Ie... if this is an investment, how would you feel if you paid $18 per coin, and a year from now, or even 6 months from now they would be available for $12 a coin?  $8 a coin?  To a collector and someone just trying to diversify their savings, they would not care, as the percentage returns of silver are secondary to their own reasons for owning it, be it security or just love having silver around. =)  So do some digging first inside your soul.  The next step would be to go to a local coin store, and just look around.  Look at bullion coins, look at generic rounds, look at bars... what excites you most?  Then... go from there. =)"

If you like it, grab it. 20€ looks to be not quite $23 USD so it's a good price, I suppose. I picked up a tube last year, I like them."

The year on the box is 2002 and the box is numbered #227, but out of how many, who knows.   CoA's that don't say that kind of devalue it some IMO.  I paid around $300, which for you spot watchers is way out of bounds, but is inline with what you can pay on Ebay for them.  I got it mostly because the Plaza hotel and Casino has a special place in my heart - was the first place I ever stayed alone - at like age 18, for a security conference in LV.  $25/night and at the time, was not long after Casino came out, which was filmed quite a bit at the Plaza.

Silverbugs,39yurb,xpl0yt,6,Tue Jun 16 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all that info - I am very new to the hobby - my first purchase was a couple weeks ago and it was a roll of 10 P1's. I am happy with the purchase, but if I could make a few suggestions (I am an art collector and I believe am qualified to give a somewhat on-point opinion on this matter) The edges of the coin take away from the overall feel of the look - the idea that it is a pirate/old-style coin - the edges look too new and pristine - perhaps keep them as round, without the ""coin"" type edges - another thing I would like to see is a date for the year or perhaps a 1/50000 and so on - that would be pretty cool but not sure if feasible -   Other than those suggestions I really enjoy the high relief of the P1 - I think the lettering could be done a bit better - it is tough to see the ""PAY"" in the phrase NO PREY NO PAY - at least to me - I could be the minority there.  Thanks again and I am excited to buy more of your products -   Also one other question - how come there is a ~10 dollar premium over spot for these? This is a complete NOOB question as I said I am brand new to the hobby. I know there should be some level of a premium as it is a design and not just spot silver, but still $10 per coin seems a bit high - that's a 33% premium.  Thanks!"
Silverbugs,39yurb,textom,3,Mon Jun 15 22:39:53 2015 UTC,"how come there is a ~10 dollar premium over spot for these?   Hello, Supply, meet Demand."
Silverbugs,39yurb,randombits,3,Tue Jun 16 02:42:11 2015 UTC,"A 10 dollar premium on these coins is not bad at all when you take this into consideration. The MINIMUM premium that the US government charges for ASE orders of 10,000 coins or more is $2 per coin. That does NOT fluctuate with the price of spot, its to cover their operating costs, and net some income. So if you have a $2 premium on a $15 coin thats ""13.333%"" premium with a huge bulk order. All things considered the average premium for a single ASE, that sales to the public, comes to around $4 which comes to around a ""26.667%"" premium on a plain ASE.      You got much better coins (with lower and discontinued minting) than the ""low"" premium alternatives, and the premium that they are charging actually isn't bad, it's just right. Note I just used an ASE for comparison, because many are familiar with the pricing, not trying to do a direct comparison."
Silverbugs,39yurb,randombits,3,Tue Jun 16 15:42:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback, /u/netpoints.  Here are some answers for you.  Rim.  The reason for the rim is because it's easy to do splash minting and have no rim.  But it doesn't stack and that's not awesome.  We actually considered doing a rough rim, but that bring the same problem.  We went back and forth on it and decided on this rim because it's hard to duplicate a ""rough"" rim to make it look like a period piece.    Date.  We've gone back and forth on this and it's something we might do in the future, but it's just never been a priority for us and it helps us save money on dies so we've left the date off.    Mintage on the round doesn't work because these aren't limited by a mintage number.  Just by end date.  ""No prey no pay"" statement.  Funny story on that.  The mint made samples of it and gave me one.  I had it on my desk and my nephew walks in the night before we're supposed to launch it.  He's half Puerto Rican and says, ""What's this?""  Giving him a hard time, I said ""It means No Prey No Pay in Spanish; you should know that.""  He said ""I don't know what you're trying to say, but this definitely doesn't say No Prey No Pay.""  Crap.  I go around finding out who gave the mint the info to put on the round and how'd that person come about the info and it turns out that one of the guys in the building (whose name will remain a secret, haha) put No prey no pay into google translate and it spit something out.  Off we went with it.  That's what we get for using google translate instead of actually talking to a native Spanish speaker, haha!  Showed it to a Mexican and a Brazilian (jic it was actually Portuguese, haha!).  No one could translate it so we had to rush the English, No Prey No Pay onto the round for final approval.  I agree it's not the best, but at least it actually says No Prey No Pay!  Reminds me of the tall tale of why the Chevy Nova didn't sell well in Mexico."
Silverbugs,39yurb,randombits,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:54:03 2015 UTC,"As to premium, that is up to the seller to set and you the buyer to pay or not. Your numbers are a little off. Provident price for one Privateer at cash discount is 41.12 which is 20.56 per ounce. Spot is around 16.00 although changes quickly. 20.56 - 16.00 = 4.56 divided by 16.00 = 28.5% markup or premium over spot.   This is high for a bullion coin but if the mintage is less than 100,000 then that makes it a collectible. Is the premium worth the design and possible appreciation? That is for you to decide. You will find that Perth Mint and the Canadian Mint charge much higher premiums for most of their stuff. Like $50 to $100 per coin."

Stopped into a Racetrack gas station for some overpriced batteries and paper towels two days ago, paid cash, in my change I heard the tell-tell silver tinkle.  Looked, found the silver quarter.  Put quarter in my phone pocket for saving, is a 1964.  Remaining change in right hand still had that tell-tell silver tinkle; dime was silver too.  As I was walking out the store, I remembered to turn around and go ask if they had any more of these grey, corroded coins.  The clerk had 30 more.  As the clerk was counting them out, I had a bit of an ethical dilemma.  To help, I said to her ""I almost feel bad for taking them"" and smiled at the clerk.  In the end, only one of the 32 coins was cupronickel, a 1966 dime.  All of the other 30 dimes and 1 quarter were silver.  The coins are fairly corroded, with a graphite like corrosion on most of them.  Date was visible on all but two with mild scratching, one just reads 194? .  Looking at corrosion notes online, it is best to leave them alone.  Going to bag separately to prevent cross-corrosion of my other coins.  The clerk smiled back at me and took my three dollar bills for the 30 dimes, she seemed happy for me but had no idea what I was doing.  If she had asked what was going on I probably would have told her to check the safe and other registers before she left."

Like I said, how they respond to this will determine my opinion.  I know I'm not the first person to ever post before receiving a response from a vendor.  The whole is to say that just because they sold a bunch of silver at crazy low prices doesn't mean they're a great company.  How their customer service handles issues like this (and other ones that are popping up in the facebook group) that will determine their reputation.  In all honesty, I would have expected the packer to inspect my order before sending, but with the volume they are doing right now I can give them a pass on that and see give them a chance to fix this."

Actually, I'm not worried about an answer or a discussion.  I brought an issue I have to people's attention and said from the start that I am waiting on their response before judging.

Silverbugs,3a1bh5,Silversaving,4,Tue Jun 16 14:33:39 2015 UTC,"you say you weren't smearing their name, but the fact that you made a post before allowing them time to respond smeared their name.  If a journalist did that they would be reprimanded by their editor and they would have to print a retraction.  If you listen to NPR or the news they always wait to air their story until they get a decline to comment, meaning that they gave the offending party the opportunity to comment on the issue.

Markets opened a tad higher on the metals, then right around 10 we had the news that Greece talks breakdown and now that EU is debating the Greek default. That shot gold and silver higher, from there they spent the rest of the day erasing those gains.   Was surprised a bit that it happened, showing that the market did not fully price in Greek default, but.... not good news for silver and gold that it gave up about half of the gains. It will be really interesting to see tomorrow and the overnight action. Right now you have the longer term selling pressure, but you do have a potential catalyst that can send metals higher in Greece.   I am personally debating both as far as what to do with my silver shorts. When I am done with the gym will see what the overnight markets do.   Up day today, but closing away for the highs of the day was not really a strong day for bulls."

Silverbugs,39x3ol,Ag47baby,2,Mon Jun 15 18:29:56 2015 UTC,"As many have stated already, fractionals do have a higher per-oz premium, but no matter what the medium is (100 oz bars, or 1/2 oz rounds) you will typically get your premium back as long as you pay market value when you purchase. I had a roll of 100 1/20 oz libertads that I was able to get at a really decent price and have since been selling them to others or adding them onto orders as gravy. Right now for example a 1/20 2002 lib (which is what I have) is going for about $6.95 on eBay, and people ARE PAYING THAT. That is roughly $139 per ounce of silver.  So to answer your question, there is no real clear cut answer. You have to make sure you are purchasing things that have a history of holding their premium. Liberates and other government coinage typically hold their premiums quite well. People want to do ""collections"" where they have all of a certain type of coin (all the 1 oz libertads since the beginning, or 1 of each of ALL the different types of libertads). These people will always be around. So if you want to unload it QUICKLY, id suggest you don't get into the fractional with a higher premium. If you don't mind the long haul it can be quite lucrative if you are able to buy them at the right price."

Silverbugs,39x3ol,PrincessPi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:06:05 2015 UTC,Fractionals seem to cost more per ounce than buying a full ounce. If they were the same price per ounce as a full ounce I'd buy them. Silver is silver to me as long as the price is right.
Silverbugs,39x3ol,PrincessPi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:08:48 2015 UTC,I love the 1/2 ozt perth lunar series.  I think they're beautiful. After a while I stopped buying what I thought was collectible and just started focusing on coins that interested me.
Silverbugs,39x3ol,PrincessPi,2,Mon Jun 15 15:28:54 2015 UTC,agreed but arent you interested in resale value?
Silverbugs,39x3ol,hooahreddit,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:10:55 2015 UTC,"Sure, but since I'm buying silver as an investment, I don't plan on reselling them anytime soon.  The only half ounce pieces I buy are low mintages so they should appreciate in value.  The Perth lunar series coins, no matter what size they are, seem to have a pretty decent appreciation, so I'm not too worried about that."
Silverbugs,39x3ol,spqrnbb,2,Mon Jun 15 15:27:34 2015 UTC,great thanks for your insight ! i love the perth mint lunar series!

My girlfriend and I thought we found ""our"" house about a month and a half ago, but after a few days of negotiating it was going nowhere, so I pulled our offer and their house is still on the market today...

The place was essentially an episode of Hoarders in a massive industrial space. We filled up a 30 yard dumpster of scrap metal, 2 20 yard dumpsters of garbage, and still had an overwhelming amount of stuff to move. The move has been almost entirely done by three of us. There have been a lot of 60-70 hour weeks, and it's finally over.   I'm ready to get back to working on cars, instead of carrying shit around in the 90 degree Georgia heat. First, though, I'm taking this week off to recover.  This move was part of restructuring our shop, so when I start back to work, it'll be as part of a new company. We're leaving behind most of the people that were at the old company, and hopefully almost all of the problems as well. It'll be interesting, that's for sure.   I'll be the only tech, and I've got a ground-up race build right off the bat as soon as it's done at the cage builder's shop - it'll be my first build entirely solo, so I'm a little nervous about some of the details, but I know I can make it work. I'll also be working out of a temporary space for the first month and a half, which definitely sucks, but shouldn't be an insurmountable challenge.  Hopefully, this new company will take off pretty quickly, and will offer me some pretty decent growth potential over the next few years. There are some solid ideas in play, and if the implementation of those ideas goes well, this will definitely be a positive transition for me."

If people want a place where they can say whatever, they will go there. They already do. I don't like censorship but it's a fact of life.

Silverbugs,39vlcf,Energy_Turtle,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:04:43 2015 UTC,"Reddit is changing its entire MO.  It used to be free speech, now its a marketing website for SJW's.

The thing about businesses is that they cost money to run and they're usually an attempt to make money. Do you run a site used by millions for free? People need to get over their idea that businesses are evil.    if that content isnt to the viewers liking then people will leave.   This is the basis of every business ever. I don't understand why everyone is so shocked when they use a system to spout their stupid and hateful ideas then cry about censorship when the system changes. If you like something, don't abuse it. These idiots forced reddit's hand. What did they expect?"
Silverbugs,39vlcf,disanthropologist,2,Mon Jun 15 18:14:28 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why everyone is so shocked when they use a system to spout their stupid and hateful ideas then cry about censorship when the system changes. If you like something, don't abuse it.    so in otherwords, if you like your free speech dont excercise it?  Freedom of speech means ANY speech is allowed, even the stuff we dont like.  Just like TV - if you dont like the violence then change the channel.  You dont force a show off the air simply because you dont like it.  As for reddit?  It comes off as ""the front page of the internet"" and looks like legit content but it isnt any longer, and thus we are currently being decieved.  If reddit wants to be a marketing site then thats their choice, but dont try to fool people into thinking reddit is a place for actual news, information, or free speech, because those three things are gone and replaced with kittens and SJW modmongers."
Silverbugs,39vlcf,thisismyfist,3,Mon Jun 15 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"Freedom of Speech means the government won't come after you for what you say. If you are using a business to express your ideas, you have to play by their rules. They aren't going to want the front page full of hateful stuff. This concept is so simple, but people don't seem to get it. You can still look at pictures of people dying, porn of all kinds, and even take a stroll through /r/coontown. When that stuff gets too big then it will likely be knocked back a bit. People aren't ""SJW"" for wanting to make money. Almost every website on the internet is a ""marketing site"" by your definition. Please show me the news site that doesn't have ads."
Silverbugs,39vlcf,disanthropologist,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:38:33 2015 UTC,"Good points.  You need to extend your definition of free speech to include the fact that that speech is also protected by said government. In otherwords - I can't get punished (someone attacks me, for instance) for saying things someone else doesn't like.  It's interesting that reddit has a policy against hate but as you said, there are other sites on reddit that are just as bad but still exist.  This is technically hypocracy, since by your own explination these are tolerated until they affect the business practice, as opposed to being outright shut down for being a hate sub.  The SJW's are the target demo for sales.  and you are right they arent SJW for wanting to make money.  Theyre SJW because they are fucking insane.   Please show me the news site that doesn't have ads.   Ads are one thing - but censored content to imply or assist in advertising is not, wether its in a reddit post or on the news. Its dishonest. News can have adverts outside of the articles themselves. Commercial breaks and what not.  Its not like you are reading about a murder and they include how great it was that the cops who arrested him drank mountain dew (tm) before the event."

It tells me they are likely irresponsible and tells me they are going to increase my financial exposure/be a liability if I marry them. Other times you'll find white collar crime, like this one's check fraud. Other times you'll find felony convictions like this one or a past one that served time for aggrevated felony assault. You'll also find bankruptcies, small claims lawsuits etc (for example you'll find my chapter 7 in that system). I rarely bring up what I find with a date if I decide to continue seeing them but I'll slowly steer conversation that direction or toss out I have a chapter 7 but other than that never any legal issues and they'll sometimes volunteer their stuff the and give me an opening to ask if they have anything else (and if they say no and hide stuff I walk away).  I'm from a law enforcement family, I'm also from a 3-letter agency family and contracted for an OGA myself for 13 months. I don't want to be with someone that has a considerable legal history. If they had a misdemeanor as a youth or something or a few tickets over a decade I'll give them a chance if the rest of their life appears to be in order.

I fully understand vetting someone before you marry them, but thats before you marry them. If you're seriously thinking about marrying someone you would hope they would disclose any information like that. "" oh, by the way, I'm a felon and I used to be a man "". I personally feel like knowing that much about someone and we're not even engaged, is a little much. Judging someone solely on their past, to me, is being too hard. Obviously what they've done matters. You dont want to marry someone that just served time for dismembering their family, but a seat belt violation? especially one in 5 years? What if they were speeding to get to the hospital because a family/friend? Some cops may excuse that, but most wont. Speeding is speeding. And to some cops that take their job super serious, 1MPH over is literally going to kill someone.

What if they were speeding to get to the hospital because a family/friend? Some cops may excuse that, but most wont.   9x out of 10 (probably more like 95x out of 100) they have NOTHING. Speeding and other moving violations =  increased risk... if we marry and they are speeding or texting and driving one day or can't seem to stay in their lane and plow into someone else BAM huge financial exposure in a possible lawsuit. The seatbelt thing shows they are lazy, get in the car and put the seatbelt on... takes 1 second or less and 1 second or less to remove it. Should be an automatic process... it's the easiest law to follow that one is going to encounter daily (personally I hate seatbelts, I was in an accident wearing one doing about 30, other 2 occupants of the car were NOT and I was the only person injurred and was in considerable pain for weeks and pain for months, but it's a LAW)."

Silverbugs,39vlcf,PrincessPi,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:48:58 2015 UTC,I can find anything on just about anyone. Here in Indiana my first stop is the county court system's lookup. It searches nearly every county's court records by party or defendant name for civil and criminal courts. For traffic violations it'll usually have most of them. If I find absolutely nothing for them in there I'll also go a step farther and check state and nearby counties' inmate locators to see if any are on parole.

Silverbugs,39sl0b,cryofthewild,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:15:00 2015 UTC,The ratio is what makes silver far more appealing ( for me and others ) to buy. If it closed in on 1:7 you'd could exchange it for 10x the gold you could buy currently.
Silverbugs,39sl0b,whatgold,2,Mon Jun 15 02:23:23 2015 UTC,"But that damn price ratio.   It's been rising relative to oil since silver was demonetized in the 1800's.  Silver isn't money, it's a material used to make solar panels."

Silverbugs,39sl0b,HaroldWS,3,Sun Jun 14 17:54:59 2015 UTC,false.  I've seen Canadian Maples from the early 90's tarnish in their mint sealed air-tight packages.
Silverbugs,39sl0b,HaroldWS,2,Sun Jun 14 17:56:30 2015 UTC,"okay, exposure to sulfur is what does it, which is usually air but sometimes shitty packaging does it too.  If you launch an untarnished CML into space, or keep it in an actual vacuum, it'll never tarnish ever.  Silver didn't tarnish until the 1800's when we started polluting the atmosphere.   And while gold generally doesn't tarnish, it can still change colour etc.  My '67 $20 canadian gold coin almost looks bronze compared to other gold, and it's apparently a common issue with those particular coins.  It's only 90% gold or something though, and maybe that's why."

Silverbugs,39tlq8,PrincessPi,4,Sun Jun 14 18:34:56 2015 UTC,I use the google spreadsheet in the Silverbugs wiki. It serves the purpose I need it for. You can see how many of each coin/round/bar you have. You can change some of the foreign stuff to meet your needs. It also tells you your profit/loss margin which is mainly what I use it for. I try to keep myself in the green which is hard when spot is below $17/ounce. You can also keep track of the melt value of your stack as well as how many ounces you have and how much you have spent. I wish it updated itself with spot value because each screen you have to change it manually. That and I wish there was a way to keep up with silver numismatics like peace dollars and morgans. Those are really my only two complaints. It works really well for what I need it for.
Silverbugs,39tlq8,wildruler,2,Sun Jun 14 20:12:40 2015 UTC,"There are some on the wiki, but I can't figure out how to use them very well. They are a few years old, and I am not excell savy enough to change and add things to them."

The spot prices are based off of SLV and will update when you update the external data. SLV is a little below spot price, but it's what I use in Quicken to keep track of the silver value of my stack.  I added a price paid column for you on each sheet and it will sum up on the first sheet. I personally didn't need it since I keep track of that with Quicken.

Silverbugs,39u5he,AgITATED1,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:19:27 2015 UTC,Did you intentionally buy 2014 ASEs? Or were these a random year purchase? The reason I ask is because 2015's are cheaper to buy and when you go to to sell one day a 2014 will sell for the same price as a 2015.
Silverbugs,39u5he,purargent,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:33:10 2015 UTC,"The 2014 were cheaper, I'm not sure why. I'm in the UK so the choices are slightly more limited.   I'm planning on buying a tube of all the regulars and see what I like best."

The price of numismatics is not really dependent on either. Their price is set by the market. Condition and rarity are what matters. I've spent hundreds on a single Mercury dime. At that point it's just useless to talk about premium. The PCGS price guide is one way to figure the value of a coin. All of those price guides tend to list a bit high though."
Silverbugs,39t8g0,Energy_Turtle,0,Sun Jun 14 23:29:33 2015 UTC,"I think maybe he means premium over getting it in the same grade ungraded?  The lustre on that 41 is fantastic, they've all been cleaned though."

""MS"" means mint state which should mean right as it came from the mint, but all graders require for that prefix is that they be uncirculated.  Unfortunately, 99.9% of all silver coins have been cleaned so if they didn't grade them, they wouldn't make any money."
Silverbugs,39t8g0,Disabled_gentleman,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:58:33 2015 UTC,??? They give damaged grades all the time. Their business is based on reliability and it wouldn't be too great for business if they gave a bunch of phony grades.

ICCS uses soft sleeves which are in my opinion better for the coin in the long run than those ""cassette tape box"" ones (slabs.)  But yeah any time you see a 20+ year old silver coin with no toning it's got to raise flags.  The deeper you delve into this hobby the more you'll see just how hard it is to find original stuff, you go into a coin store and ask about uncleaned coins he'll either laugh at you, not know what you're talking about or tell you what I'm telling you.

Silverbugs,39rjrv,eightsecond,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:04:48 2015 UTC,"It's not that they ""matter"" more, it's that their value is tied more to their condition and rarity, how well they've survived the years since minting. Obviously, deliberately toning a coin whose value is primarily in how closely it resembles its mint state is not a great idea."
Silverbugs,39rjrv,ShotgunZen,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:30:58 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but why currency? They mint more of them, they are ugly, and other rounds are much more interesting and rare. the privateer for example."

I'm hooked now though and looking at older years, and of course will buy a 2015 while it's still cheap! To anybody who doesn't own a graded Panda- buy one, you will Not regret it! It's a thing of beauty in Silver Proof quality and a pretty solid investment too."
Silverbugs,39r7pk,TonnyRespect,2,Sun Jun 14 01:22:14 2015 UTC,"That probably cost more than my entire stack, I can't even let myself buy an ungraded panda on ebay."
Silverbugs,39r7pk,Disabled_gentleman,-6,Sun Jun 14 01:30:48 2015 UTC,"I see those pandas go for around 20$ each every night on ebay with free shipping and they appear to still be sealed in their Chinese mint packaging.  If I was going to collect them I'd buy those, they should all be MS69 or 70 coming straight from the manufacturer and if they didn't meet my specifications I'd just resell em.  Third party grader holders mean a sealed coin was opened, and some of them, these included touch the coin at spots which could cause unfavourable toning."
Silverbugs,39r7pk,purargent,4,Sun Jun 14 02:25:59 2015 UTC,Its a pretty much fact that 90% of Pandas on eBay are fakes. Probably higher then 90% but I was just guessing low :) I have yet to find a real panda for under $25ish on eBay and that is for the 2015's. I just looked at sold listings and the only $20 Pandas I see that have sold recently are shipped from sellers in China. Unless your buying Pandas straight from the mint any other panda shipped from China on eBay is fake.
Silverbugs,39r7pk,Disabled_gentleman,-3,Sun Jun 14 03:12:16 2015 UTC,"Well yeah you're just guessing.  I see pandas go every night and they all look legit, if not you can get your money back so there's nothing to lose.  Not sure about the dates but the year you need will come up."
Silverbugs,39r7pk,nugget9k,2,Sun Jun 14 04:08:30 2015 UTC,"In Shanghai you can buy current year pandas at the bank.  They cost the equivalent to $50 U.S. Dollars and have over a $30 premium over spot to them.  THIS is how they are distributed in China.  Thus, I don't believe someone in China will be selling one to an American for $20 any time soon. Source - I have been there"
Silverbugs,39r7pk,Disabled_gentleman,2,Sun Jun 14 11:51:19 2015 UTC,"They go for $20 because they are fake, and if you resell them as real pandas you'll get your 5 minutes of fame from your picture in the local newspaper"
Silverbugs,39r7pk,nugget9k,-2,Sun Jun 14 05:51:30 2015 UTC,Well I think you can claim return shipping fees from paypal now so if your coin turned out to be fake you could return it and get all your money back.  I'd only resell the coin if it was real and not in good enough shape for me.
Silverbugs,39r7pk,spockdad,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:10:47 2015 UTC,I think you can claim return shipping fees from paypal now   I had no idea.  Paypal pays for that?
Silverbugs,39r7pk,nugget9k,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:58:10 2015 UTC,"Yup. I can confirm that. Recently bought a fake from eBay went through the process and got the seller banned, and every cent I put into it back. eBay did a great job with that. And I learned my lesson to never by from a Chinese seller. Win, win came out of what would have previously been a losing situation."
Silverbugs,39r7pk,spockdad,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:32:46 2015 UTC,You returned it and paypal paid the shipping?
Silverbugs,39r7pk,nugget9k,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:41:21 2015 UTC,eBay just looked at the guys listings and could tell they were all fakes. After that eBay refunded me for shipping and the item. I never had to ship it back because it was a fake.
Silverbugs,39r7pk,spockdad,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:45:00 2015 UTC,"Right, Paypal definately does cover your buyers fees.  That is not what DG is talking about.  He is saying on top of getting your money back, If you need to ship the item back they will pay for that too"
Silverbugs,39r7pk,Disabled_gentleman,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:30:52 2015 UTC,"Oh. I see.  I guess in my case, since all of the items the seller was selling was fake, they didn't make me ship it back."

Silverbugs,39pho2,djm123412,2,Sat Jun 13 15:34:10 2015 UTC,"All dealers can hedge, a lot would rather just take the risk on...hedging is no different than you determining if you want/need insurance.  Depending on your ""risk tolerance"" you might be willing to go without insurance and that is a risk.    Unless you are strictly a bullion dealer, it would be tough for a coin dealer to manage their net position during business hours. Never mind trying to determining the # of positions they need while open for business (inventory goes up/down during the day) and hedging might not even make sense financially depending on what they specialize in. Smaller dealers know their buyers, so they know generally how fast they can flip something and for what price.  People complain that dealers don't buy for spot and then they complain there are no dealers in their area.  If there are no dealers in your area, economics are at play.  They are either going out of business or its too tough to work on the margins they operate on in a brick and mortar store...  The ones that do buy under spot and sell for over spot are ensuring they make something on each purchase and that's why dealers like to see inventory come in and quickly leave."
Silverbugs,39pho2,SkullCollector,4,Sat Jun 13 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"Nice, I just asked a metals dealer here how he was hedging - he said he wasn't because he was small, so the question went un-answered.

This is actually happening (Chase telling their customers to remove PMs), but I don't think the gov is going to check lists of people who bought PMs online and start knocking on doors..."
Silverbugs,39q534,e30kgk,3,Sun Jun 14 14:40:18 2015 UTC,"Chase is asking that cash and precious metals not be stored in their safety deposit boxes. This hasn't got a damn thing to do with confiscation or the government.  Also, it's absolutely not enforced. I haven't heard of a single individual being forced to open their safety deposit box and show a Chase employee that their box is free of PMs or cash. In fact, the contents of your safety deposit box remain entirely confidential - you can store cash, gold, heroin, whatever in a box, and no one will know."

I read somewhere that someone was being asked a lot of questions when selling gold bars with serial numbers.  The guy was unloading several bars and the dealer he was selling to limited his sale because the bars had serial numbers.  The dealer was concerned with tax reporting because they could track that sale by looking at the serial numbers.  I apologize for not having all the details, but this was something I read or heard about."
Silverbugs,39q534,purargent,4,Sat Jun 13 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"I have never heard any such thing, and it sounds like someone in your story is completely full of shit.   The IRS does not maintain any record of serial numbers on bullion products. There's a whole lot of paranoia in the stacking community, and precious little of it has any basis in fact whatsoever.  edit: He's concerned about there being a record of serial numbers, but there aren't records tracing ownership of these serial numbers. It's not like a car or real estate, where there's a recorded title for each owner, and it can be traced from owner to owner. A serial number is useless for establishing a chain of ownership unless there's a standardized, consistently-used method for recording transactions linked to each serial number."
Silverbugs,39q534,e30kgk,2,Sat Jun 13 18:50:47 2015 UTC,"If somehow having a serial number on a piece of metal became a liability, there's nothing to stop you from melting down and recasting your bar. You'll lose any premium value but you still have your anonymous lump of metal."
Silverbugs,39q534,purargent,5,Sat Jun 13 19:07:07 2015 UTC,paranoid colleagues about serial numbers on bars and how they can be tracked.   Paranoid is the keyword here. I believe that online dealers have way to much important things to do then to record all bars that have serial numbers and associate that bar to every sale that they do. Precious Metals are very liquid and exchange hands many times over there lifetime. So even if say by chance this was going on. It would be like finding a needle in the haystack.
Silverbugs,39q534,ChopperIndacar,2,Sat Jun 13 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"Yep, even if the serial is correlated with the owner at initial sale - which it isn't - that doesn't mean shit.   It's like firearms - yes, the serial is recorded with the identity of the initial purchaser (but NOT reported to the government - the record simply exists and can be obtained from the dealer with a court order), but that doesn't prove ownership of the gun. The original purchaser of the gun can walk out of the dealer's store, and decide to sell the gun to the first person he sees with no paperwork involved whatsoever. If the police ever ask you about a gun that your name appears on a 4473 for, you don't have any obligation to account for the whereabouts of the gun. It simply shows that at one point, you owned it.   There's a lot more than the existence of a serial number involved in tracing ownership of an item."

First of all, make SURE it is sterling.  There is such a thing as silver plated flatware.  It should say sterling on it.  Even plated can tarnish.  Also keep in mind the knifes have stainless blades and only sterling handles.  The handles may be weighted as well so don't go by weight in the knives.  I have a lot of sterling handed down by earlier generations.  I see people trying to sell full sets online for $3000 or more.  Don't know if they are actually getting it.  Gotta keep in mind how many place settings there are and how complete the set is.  Also, different patterns are worth different amounts.  Mine are mid 20th century...1940 or so.  I'm still not sure what they are worth.  It HAS been my experience that they sell for a good bit more than melt weight.  If the ones in your pictures ARE sterling and not just plate...it looks like there are only 8 place settings in each (mine have 12)...That will make them worth a bit less"

I even have a few 08 counterfeits that someone tried to pass off and I caught them red-handed.  The pictures are terrible, and most of the obvious problem signs for counterfeits are conveniently blurred out.  (Temple steps, font, panda eyes)  First I will say that if it is a counterfeit, which it likely is, that it's a good one.  Much better than fakes I confiscated 5 years ago.  Second, the font on the 2008 looks significantly ""off"", especially the 2, which looks mis-proportioned.  Third, if you're paying just over spot, that's completely non-sensical given market value for an 08 piece.    Conclusion:  Probably fake, a good fake, but a fake nonetheless."

It was the first shiny that I put away and haven't looked at since. Every shiny purchase I've made as always given me a great feeling. This ATB just made me feel like whatever at least it's silver.  It's ugly, that 3 inch quarter just doesn't work for me. Compared to 5 ounce libs and turtles it doesn't feel chunky. I'll keep it but it will be the first thing I sell or trade.

Silverbugs,39nmh6,glycerin_13,0,Sat Jun 13 03:41:44 2015 UTC,"You said it with bullet three, though I think I agree on all points.  Why would you put a giant quarter head on them????  Also, why would a 1oz eagle be monetized at 1 dollar and a 5 oz round be monetized at 25 cents?  This might be negligible since the monetary value means absolutely nothing to anyone, but for me its a major source of WTF were you thinking when you made this.  Given that the monetary values of US bullion coins don't follow some tied gold/silver ratio, they could have made the 5oz ATB coins 5 dollar coins even though the 1/10 gold is.  Doesn't really matter, at least it would be logically consistent for how they are ""monetizing"" silver."

I had more hope for a five-coin-per-year set, but again, it just seems like we ""phone it in"" vs countries like Australia and China who produce real works of art for their yearly issues.

My first one was the Gettysburg one, because I grew up in that area.  I like the design on that one.  The next one I got was the very 1st in the series Hot Springs, also like this one a lot.  Overall, I really like most of the first, second, and third year designs (2010-2012), but after that, most of them seem to have gone down hill.  I have all of the quarter silver proof sets (except 2012), but only have about 10 of the 5oz ones.  I think the reason I like this series is I love the USA's national park system, and that they created coins to celebrate that.

I wish they were similarly proportioned as the Perth Lunar 5oz.  Despite this, I still buy them but now only collect the unciriculated  P-mint ones.  I feel with their matte finish, they don't look as cheesy.  p.s. the Homestead one is a particularly bad example. It's not an attractive coin. The Kisatchie is better looking.

So while the new artwork depicting the parks generally pops (as it was designed with both coins in mind) Washington's portrait on the other side of the coin is seriously lacking in detail.     It is what it is. They lack the quality of an ASE but the mintage numbers are night and day between them...

Silverbugs,39nsp1,Spence97,1 point,Sat Jun 13 02:44:56 2015 UTC,"Graded and/or ""sealed"" bullion isn't really worth anything more than the regular stuff... And if it is it really shouldn't be because all coins released by the mint would qualify as a ""gem uncirculated"" roll.. Nothing too special in my opinion.  But at the same time follow the whole buy what you like thought process.  That's the fun part about collecting this kind of thing!  I'm not sure if I'd personally pay extra for a graded roll of bullion but a common item/series that's not always the best deal vs spot price yet is still loved by many are ones put out by the Perth mint such as the Lunars/Kookaburras, for example.  That would be a wiser purchase of a higher premium item, in my mind, since they usually retain those premiums and/or increase in value over time. (again just an example... buy what you like!)  But if you're dying to have a graded roll, buy what you like!  Better than blowing it on something useless.  Otherwise I'd just stick to the regular rolls.. The $340 you dropped on that roll is a great buy!  $1 over spot for eagles is awesome :D"
Silverbugs,39nsp1,TeaFella,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:26:59 2015 UTC,Well since they sell them I assume someone is buying these but I don't know anyone who collects bullion ASEs like that.

So I bought em.   sides have a serial number and say copyright 1974 Saturday Evening Post.  Also what is 1974P?   Anyone have any idea about them?  saw a few on ebay for prices all over the place.

Silverbugs,39mwt5,autowikibot,2,Fri Jun 12 22:45:28 2015 UTC,"Four Freedoms:       The Four Freedoms were goals articulated by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt on January 6, 1941. In an address known as the Four Freedoms speech (technically the 1941 State of the Union address), he proposed four fundamental freedoms that people ""everywhere in the world"" ought to enjoy:   Freedom of speech Freedom of worship Freedom from want Freedom from fear   Roosevelt delivered his speech 11 months before the United States declared war on Japan, December 8, 1941. The State of the Union speech before Congress was largely about the national security of the United States and the threat to other democracies from world war that was being waged across the continents in the eastern hemisphere. In the speech, he made a break with the tradition of United States non-interventionism that had long been held in the United States. He outlined the U.S. role in helping allies already engaged in warfare.  In that context, he summarized the values of democracy behind the bipartisan consensus on international involvement that existed at the time. A famous quote from the speech prefaces those values: ""As men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone."" In the second half of the speech, he lists the benefits of democracy, which includes economic opportunity, employment, social security, and the promise of ""adequate health care"". The first two freedoms, of speech and religion, are protected by the First Amendment in the United States Constitution. His inclusion of the latter two freedoms went beyond the traditional Constitutional values protected by the U.S. Bill of Rights. Roosevelt endorsed a broader human right to economic security and anticipated what would become known decades later as the ""human security"" paradigm in social science and economic development. He also included the ""freedom from fear"" against national aggression before the idea of a United Nations for this protection was envisioned or discussed by world leaders and allied nations.

Silverbugs,39ne38,jeremycb29,1 point,Sat Jun 13 00:45:18 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot for the suggestions! Do you know if any coins similar to Zombux are avaliable or will come out soon? Those seem like they might be a good investment too. For my first purchase I want to just buy 1 of every cool coin I want (I'll probably spend $100-150 total).
Silverbugs,39ne38,justanothershell,2,Sat Jun 13 01:02:43 2015 UTC,dont forget a privateer round
Silverbugs,39ne38,spockdad,2,Sat Jun 13 01:04:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  While the zombucks series has appreciated, the 1st coin in the series is what really holds it afloat for numismatic value, the rest of the coins seem to have only appreciated slightly.  as /u/justanothershell mentioned, the 2oz privateer round is the first in its series, and appears to have huge potential to gain numismatic value (but there are no guarantees that this will happen).  If you do decide to go with this, you will want to do it pretty soon, as they will stop making this round very soon. So the Privateer will set you back around $42-45, then it was also mentioned the Pandas, Perth Lunars, maybe a few Maple Privies, would all be good rounds to investigate for yourself.  (One each of those, would put you right around the total you were looking to spend.) But I highly suggest, taking a good look at them.  If you dont like them, dont buy them.  If you do like them, then go for it."

Silverbugs,39ipn2,justanothershell,2,Fri Jun 12 14:02:55 2015 UTC,"Congratulations on your first piece of silver. As for what you paid for it, I'd say it was a fair deal. Maybe a dollar or so too expensive for what I'd pay on a maple leaf, but still a great first step into the world of silver. I know I paid about $2-3 dollars more on a bar than I should have for my first silver purchase. But as you continue stacking you will find much better deals, and figure out your own buy it or leave it price range.  The $5 denomination on the coin is mostly for show, but it is the very least the coin will ever be worth. It is backed by the Canadian government.  Your strategy for buying silver at such a young age is awesome. You will have 50-100 oz in your first year at that rate.  Not sure what you searched or what kind of store you went to when you purchased this, but a good thing to search for is coin shop or local coin shop (you will see ""LCS"" thrown around here, that is short for local coin shop). There you should find a nice assortment of silver and gold in bar, coin, and round varieties.  On a budget, another way to collect silver is to buy $1-5 dollar face value (FV) government junk coins. These are usually 50% to 92% circulated silver coins. Canada has some beautiful ""junk"" coins, and here in the U.S. most of our desirable junk coins are 90% silver.  Anyway, keep stacking and have fun. Also, don't let anyone tell you what you stack is crap, if you love it, it is an awesome stack!"

You may find that you paid a little extra, but if you like the place that you bought it from then don't worry about it. I'm in the USA abut I love the royal Canadian mint stuff.  The maple canopy coins are my favorite out of every ounce I own. I would suggest that you check eBay, apmex, and provident for better prices online.  Only buy from reputable dealers in eBay. There is a dollar value on the coin and that is mostly ceremonial.  True, the coin will always be worth $5 even off spot price goes to $0.50, but that will never happen.  It's more of a security thing - you know that a government mint produced these coins and so the metal content is assured.  This is in contrast to generics, where only a company somewhere is responsible for the content (that's why they cost less).  Hope this helps.  Check out some other pictures on here and keep stacking!"

Silverbugs,39ipn2,TonnyRespect,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:45:34 2015 UTC,"That translates to $19.93 USD. Average price among the large online retailers seem to be about $19.05 right now. However, that's for a minimum order of $99+. So for a single coin in a brick-and-mortar retailer, I think you did very well. If you're only buying 1-2oz/wk, you're not going to get any volume discounts or free shipping online. I'd recommend saving your money until you've got enough ($99+) to make an online order. Volume discounts aren't going to happen for $99, but you can still benefit from the prices (like I said, 1pc-avg $19.05/pc for those CMLs). Maybe buy a variety at your LCS first and then stack a bit online of whichever proves to be your favorite. Then you can be broke and happy like us! :D"
Silverbugs,39ipn2,Spence97,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"Seems nobody's answered the face value question... The $5 face value is arbitrary and basically just lets it be called a ""coin"" rather than a ""round.""  Using google-fu I found this:   ""Gold (or silver.. just quoting here!) bullion coins have a legal tender face value, often a value which seems ridiculously low compared to the actual gold value of the coin. This nominal face value is assigned to these coins to make them actual legal tender, which can be transported from country to country, freely, and without the tariffs and taxes imposed by some countries on gold bullion""  And you got a pretty OK price but check online for better buys.  I wouldn't discourage giving the local guys some business if you like em but everyone seems to recommend that silvergoldbull.com site for you Canadians.    Welcome to the subreddit!  It sounds like you have a good plan thought out and often times that ounce or two a week turns into 5 or 10 so don't be worried if that happens.  Also if you want to branch out, even though our name is ""silverbugs,"" we don't discourage buying fractional gold such as british gold sovereigns now and again to diversify.

Our biggest and in my opinion best vendor is https://silvergoldbull.com/ right now they have 2015 maples for 22.50. They often run specials for free shipping. Right now it's buy a 2oz privateer and get free shipping.  Congrats again and welcome to the jungle.
Silverbugs,39ipn2,Peterboring,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that website looks great! Seems like if I can't get free shipping, staying with the local dealer is the right move. For the time being I will be buying in small quantities, so paying shipping never looks like it will be worth it for me."
Silverbugs,39ipn2,FReZSTeR,0,Fri Jun 12 02:27:46 2015 UTC,"It's true that S&H can be a killer. I typically save all month and make 1 larger purchase. I've also signed up for their long term buy program.   https://silvergoldbull.com/long-term-buy  Your first purchase you pay the regular shipping price, but if you can get free shipping on that order you only pay $2.84 per order after. It's a great way to save on shipping.  Also check out /r/pmsforsale. You might be able to find a member that you could buy from locally. Plus you'll find better prices than the usual LCS.   I'm not trying to dissuade you from using your LCS, just trying to give you some options. We don't have many up here. Best of luck."
Silverbugs,39jw9f,maksimfa,3,Fri Jun 12 06:19:57 2015 UTC,"As far as I know from info from the perth mint, these are all very much hand made and have a very intense process of striking and such. Hence the premium. They're very hard to make in the dinner plate size :) They are also extremely low mintage and take a pretty long time to make just one."

Silverbugs,39jw9f,Peterboring,2,Fri Jun 12 13:27:19 2015 UTC,It's weird because I was talking to someone about this last night and almost made a thread here about it.   I am a huge fan of the Lunar 1 kilos due to their low price over spot and future collectibility factor. This year I have purchased 8 of them and was looking into the possibility of trading them (plus 2 more) in for a 10 kilo. I quickly found out this was not going to be possible due to the difference in premiums.  The biggest reason I believe for the much higher premium is that the 10 kilo has a low mintage cap; a rarity in the Lunar series. It's a shame because I'd love to own one.   Edit: removed the confusing info regarding the 1kilo and 10oz prices.
Silverbugs,39jw9f,Mykidsfirst,2,Fri Jun 12 11:44:07 2015 UTC,"You can pick up the 10 oz for a couple bucks over spot at multiple online retailers, including eBay."

Less middlemen and direct source should mean lower cost of raw materials? Yes?"
Silverbugs,39jg2b,otyebis,2,Fri Jun 12 06:16:03 2015 UTC,All orders are shipped free.  That knocks it down a buck or two.
Silverbugs,39jg2b,randombits,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:58:44 2015 UTC,"You may be right about less middlemen, but because they are small, it probably costs them a lot more to process, refine, and mint these. Governments and bigger companies can produce them cheaper because their volumes are much higher so they can ramp up their production and efficiency to drive down their $/oz ratio."
Silverbugs,39jg2b,spockdad,1 point,Fri Jun 12 06:39:03 2015 UTC,It's not like they would sell their raw materials on the open market for higher than spot or going rate just because they are small. I would guess they have this retail branch to improve their margins by selling direct to public. I would be more likely to buy if they passed some of that savings on to the consumer.

I don't remember the details such as which countries that applies to, etc., but If you were to import 10 Silver Eagles you would only pay tax on $10 since the silver eagles are official silver bullion coins of the United States with a ridiculous stated value of ""ONE DOLLAR"" minted on the reverse side of the coin; whereas, if you were to import 10 silver rounds you would pay taxes of the spot price of silver times 10 or roughly $160 at present.

Silverbugs,39gm4b,jajorda2,2,Thu Jun 11 19:18:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's a 37mm, but that's only a guess. It's been awhile since I've put them in there. They're already in my new safety deposit box so I don't have them. IIRC they're a tiny bit loose, but close tightly. Sorry I'm not much help."

Silverbugs,39hvj7,wildruler,4,Thu Jun 11 20:42:12 2015 UTC,"It means ""at least X"".  No one intentionally debases their four-nines silver to get three nines (though they do to get Sterling and various other ""junk"" grades), it just means they didn't bother refining further once an assay came back as good for the desired purity, whether .999 or .9999 or whatever.  As for impurities - Mostly copper, with some gold and PGMs (and trace amounts of just about everything); and sometimes lead depending on the origin of the silver, but we can chemically remove lead a lot easier than those first three."
Silverbugs,39hvj7,ribnag,2,Thu Jun 11 21:05:17 2015 UTC,"Just a question... Could the Silverbug artists that we have here on Reddit that makes the beautiful castings and homemade bars by melting .999 silver rounds or shot be adding impurities (not intentionally)  and possibly reducing the purity to .998 or so?  (Because of the borax and crucibles or clay molds etc.) Or... Once they are .999, they remain .999 unless other metals are melted in?"
Silverbugs,39hvj7,SilverRado,3,Fri Jun 12 00:16:30 2015 UTC,"I believe it's ""contamination"".  That is, they can only verify to that decimal place.  In either case, nothing has been purposefully added."
Silverbugs,39h0p9,APMEXPreciousMetals,8,Thu Jun 11 17:37:37 2015 UTC,"The way you calculate ""over spot"" for this page is very confusing.  The only 2 methods used for calculating it is:   If the coin is 1oz or over, Divide the premium by the total weight in ounces to get the amount over spot per ounce. If the coin is under 1oz, Figure out the spot price of the item, and list the premium per piece.   You have listed a 2011 5oz ATB coin for $120, which isn't a bad price... But then you list it on sale as only $39.99 over spot! which sounds horrible.  Really the price is about $8 over spot."

So, please tell us, does Apmex insurance cover shipments that were stolen by mail carriers?  This question, by the way, is part of the cost of having a Reddit presence. Do whatever you need to do, but I do expect an answer."
Silverbugs,39h0p9,jeremycb29,17,Thu Jun 11 19:50:27 2015 UTC,"To answer your first question, all shipments from APMEX are covered. Secondly, we reached a written agreement with sillkeepin1 on how to resolve this issue Thursday, June 4. We shipped his replacement package Friday, June 5, which was delivered and signed for on Monday, June 8. Phone confirmation of receipt happened on June 9.      This one instance does not coincide with our 15 year customer service history or our 99% customer satisfaction rating. APMEX holds customer satisfaction to the highest esteem. Our customers have rewarded our efforts with an A+ BBB rating, 99.8% customer satisfaction rating on our eBay store and 5 out of 5 stars customer approval rating on APMEX.com.      To date, over 99.93% of all packages shipped by APMEX are swiftly delivered without issue. On the rare occasion when a lost or stolen package is reported, APMEX conducts an investigation and resolves the issue based on the results.  We would like to take this opportunity to answer some recent questions.    Q: Is my order safe?     All of our shipments are covered in the case of loss or damage in transit, regardless of order value.       Q: Do you have a process for lost or stolen orders?     APMEX has an easy 3 step process for handling lost or stolen claims.     1) A lost or stolen package is reported by a customer to APMEX Customer Service    2) APMEX, and sometimes our insurer performs an investigation of the shipment    3) Resolution and next steps are decided. If the package was indeed lost or stolen, the customer is asked to sign and file claim documentation with APMEX for reshipment. APMEX then re-sends the customer’s order. If the initial claim is found to be fraudulent, APMEX has the right to deny the claim.      Q: How long does it take to investigate lost or stolen orders?     On average it takes two weeks for the investigation and resolution of an issue.         APMEX is dedicated to our customer’s privacy and as such, will not disclose the details of someone’s claim, order history, or personal information. This commitment to privacy prevents us from responding to specific questions about what happened, though the accounting of this experience is not completely accurate. We can say that this issue with stillkeepin1 has been resolved. If you have questions about shopping on APMEX or our processes you may contact us at (800) 375-9006 x182.      We hope that our record and your experience with our company determine your view of APMEX."

The markup over spot on those lunars is?  Current price as of time of comment is $27.57, for a cash price, for the current year goat.   Spot is currently $16., so currently a 72% fee over spot for the 1 oz coin.    If you go to the local store, that is what you will likely get, spot.  Yes, you can get more if you sell online, but then you get the fees and all.  Even an American Eagle if you can get for a $2 premium over spot, is a 12.5% load/fee.  Are precious metals a way to save?  Sure... but you would have to be an idiot to forgoe your 401k, especially since most companies will offer you FREEEEEE money via matching.  You can contribute to a money market fund, or even a silver fund if offered, and get a free match.  I love my coins as much as anyone else, but after a while, they just sit there, doing NOTHING for me. I can't loan it out and make money off of interest.  It is not really liquid and well, quite frankly silver has been a dog over the last few years.  You would of been better off investing in CD's or savings accounts at a paltry 0.1%.  This is not to say metals should not be in your overall portfolio, they are at least 5% of mine, but I am also not an idiot to believe that silver coins with 12% + premiums is the way to go for all of your savings."

As someone else pointed out, the big part of the price premiums is specifically because it is an ongoing series, and folks getting in now... will also want to get in and buy the earlier series too.  I am the same way with ATB.... I just got in, but willing to pay a bit more for the previous ones.  Once that market dries up... will it still be worth it?  I doubt it.  I bought a few rolls of 1/2 oz coins for the sole purpose of flipping them in a year or two... but it is not bullion value to me and mostly a trade.  Also keep in mind, the Tiger is also the most popular and has the highest premiums.  The 2011 rabbit coins did drop.  My 2014 goat Kilo coins certainly went down in price.  the 1/2 stayed flat, the 1 oz actually went up a tad."

So I switched to silver - which has lost almost half it's value (I started buying around $28/oz). So is 401k really that much better than PMs? I don't think so. Stocks have no intrinsic value and tend to crash regularly. I think it's crazy to speculate and risk my savings in a rigged casino just to gain a couple extra %/yr. At least silver will always be worth something to someone.   Even an American Eagle if you can get for a $2 premium over spot, is a 12.5% load/fee.   You mean only a (one time) 12.5% load/fee! You can find junk for 5% over spot.

I disagree about liquidity. I could easily sell all mine for spot tomorrow at the local coin shop, or a few days on craigslist, eBay, r/Pmsforsale, family members, etc.   I am also not an idiot to believe that silver coins with 12% + premiums is the way to go for all of your savings.   I agree, but I think you're hitting a straw man. No sane person advocates 100% silver."
Silverbugs,39j2x9,teslamap,3,Fri Jun 12 12:04:22 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought until I lost half my 401k savings in 2008. So I switched to silver     Had you left your money in your 401k up until now, you would have made back all of your losses and then some.  All retirement plans you should view for the long haul, just keep socking away into it, and dont even think about it.  401k, PMs, IRA's, etc should be thought of as long term investmenting and savings. if you let fear of loss pull you out while the markets are down, you will always come out in the negative. The rest of your points are good points, especially your last 2.  But I will strongly advocate to keep saving to your 401k's at least up to what your company will match."
Silverbugs,39j2x9,spockdad,0,Fri Jun 12 13:37:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'd be back in the black now - but for how long? Sooner or later the market will crap out again (it always does) and I'd be back in the red. I can't sleep at night knowing most of my savings is tied up in a market that continually craps out. The market is too speculative, risky and rigged for me. PMs aren't a perfect alternative (especially when the COMEX is rigged), but it's the solution that suits me best. In my humble opinion, I think you're ignoring the negative aspects of a 401k. The fees are high (refer to previous link), it's about as illiquid as any investment can get and you're mostly steered into risky assets with no intrinsic value that crap out on a regular basis. I wouldn't be surprised if the govt started monkeying around with it (probably attaching fees or taxes - or maybe even outright confiscation). All fiat money dies, including the dollar and the markets attached to it. The big question is - will the dollar die in your lifetime? If so, your 401k will die along with it. PMs have been around for several thousand years. 401ks are great sometimes for some people but they do have a downside."
Silverbugs,39j2x9,teslamap,2,Fri Jun 12 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"Teslamap,  I am sorry that you lost half the value in your 401k.  Should of work with a competent advisor, it would of never happen.  Even IF you did lose all that money, you would been more than recovered right now, and had you been contributing on an ongoing basis, you would of been EXTREMELY well off as you would of been buying at dirt cheap prices.  I am sorry you lost money in your 401k, then lost another half of that again buying silver at $28.    Secondly, stocks DO have a huge intrinsic value, you just have to understand them.  Stocks are not just some fantasy created... like bitcoin.  Does Apple, Toyota, Boeing, have no value?  Absolutely they do, starting with the real assets on the books, including CASH, Real Estate and Inventory.  We are not even talking about the enterprise value or value of any patents or intangible products.  Unfortunately, it is due to the lack of financial education in this country and the media's more than willingness to keep people stupid by supplying them with plenty of fear.  Yes, investments have fees, just like your silver.... storage costs, insurance costs, it adds up.  For an average person saving for retirement, where are you going to store 15,000 plus oz of silver?  Then go and try to liquidate that safely.  The most important part that you are forgetting is the free 401k match.   I don't care if there is a 90% fee, but if it means I am getting 10% free, 10% of something is better than 100% of nothing.  Now lets take a look....  From 1990 until 2004, silver went nowhere, dead investment.  Finally when up during the collapse as people were freaking out, then collapsed during the recession.  Then... only once we were dealing with the fiscal cliff and the shutdowns in DC, did Silver spike... but  again from there, dumped.  Now if you were unfortunate to invest in silver back in 1980, you had to wait 30 years, and be smart enough to sell... just to BREAK EVEN.  But here you go... take a look.  http://i.imgur.com/FHiTRto.png http://i.imgur.com/Jfp7KCL.png  As far as metals... yes, I have an issue that it just sits there.... what maintains value better is guns and ammo. =)  It even goes up over time.  Precious Metals do not grow, or work for you, and you made my point.  My business, works for me to grow my money. My car allows me to get places. Even a home gives you a place to live, it does something for you.  The hundreds of OZ that are sitting... is just there because it sits there and as a hedge against everything else I own and invest in... and from time to time, it is a great conversation starter.  Otherwise, for most people, precious metals do not do anything, except, as you said, maintain their value against the currency.  Your money should be working for you.  On the last one... I am glad it did hit a straw to hopefully to start getting folks to think critically for themselves, and not just what the popular idea within their community is.  I have seen plenty of videos and comments here and on other sites claiming exactly that.... that everything is doomed and all you need is precious metals.  Telling someone that metals are a better investment than a 401k with free matching, also fits into that criteria, especially since that same 401k can invest in metals. =)"

Silverbugs,39j2x9,maksimfa,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:04:09 2015 UTC,"It's rare to find someone to converse with who doesn't go ape when someone disagrees - thanks :-)   sorry that you lost half the value in your 401k. Should of work with a competent advisor, it would of never happen.   The Dow lost half it's value from 07 to 09. If you know of an advisor that could save significantly more than 50% of my portfolio in that circumstance - and doesn't cost a fortune, I'd love to meet them!   Secondly, stocks DO have a huge intrinsic value   Forgive me, I should have chosen my words more carefully. My point is that whatever intrinsic value a stock has can (almost) evaporate overnight (which doesn't seem indicative of intrinsic value in my mind). I'm reminded of PAN-AM. When I was a kid they ruled the skies. They had real assets on the books, including CASH, Real Estate and Inventory. But now they're long gone, along with all their ""intrinsic value"". Radio Shack, GM, Lehman Brothers, etc. To my point, PMs have maintained their value for 3000 years but stocks crap out.   where are you going to store 15,000 plus oz of silver? Then go and try to liquidate that safely.   If I reach that amount of PMs, most will be in gold, which is much easier to store in a safe deposit box, home safe, buried, whatever. I plan to liquidate slowly through the methods I mentioned previously.   From 1990 until 2004, silver went nowhere   Well from 08 to 11 it went from $9 to $40! Anyone can take a slice of chart to support their position. The only chart I care about is the one showing stocks and PMs in 30 years from today.   what maintains value better is guns and ammo   Agree ;-)   Precious Metals do not grow, or work for you   They also don't go bankrupt and sold for pennies.  I think we actually agree more than disagree. I'd never put all my savings into PMs or a 401k. I'd be happy with 50% PMs and 50% 401k. Each has it's advantages and disadvantages. I agree people need to research and decide what's the best investment for themselves. You lean toward a 401K that ""works for you"" - I lean toward the safety and security of PMs."

Silver is a long term value preservation type investment.  You also can TRY to trade it buying low and selling high but that isn't really the ""stacking"" model many follow.

Silverbugs,39fmc4,johnrgrace,4,Thu Jun 11 12:23:19 2015 UTC,Can you give me an example of a longterm asset? I'm next to ignorant and will spend way too much time googling and confusing myself.
Silverbugs,39fmc4,KeatingOrRoark,4,Thu Jun 11 17:40:46 2015 UTC,"For me an asset is something that puts money in your pocket. Things like stocks or rental properties etc. Stocks usually pay a dividend and rental properties have long term potential for steady flow of income after the mortgage is paid off. A huge thing that you have to decide for yourself is your personal risk tolerance and how aggressive you want to get. For me I am what you would call a ""lazy"" investor. I don't want to have to look at earnings reports and a whole lot of other ratios in order to decide if I like a stock or not. Another thing to consider is that people who are paid a lot of money to look at these things can probably read them better and faster than me so trying to ""time"" buying individual stocks in my opinion is a losing battle. For this reason I chose to invest in Vanguard total market index funds which is very diversified and tries to mirror the market.  Another huge consideration for investing is any fee associated with the account. These annual fees are compounded over years and years so if your money is in there till retirement you would be surprised with how much money .25% difference can make. This is another reason I chose vanguard because they have the lowest fees.  If retirement is important to you I would first of all open an IRA which is a tax advantage account. These work by putting in post tax dollars into an account and letting them grow into the market. Since they are post tax dollars you will not be taxed on the money when you withdraw it. The annual max right now is $5,500. This is an asset because it pays dividends as well as gains.  Likewise your employer 401k plan is similar but opposite on how it is taxed. The money is put in before tax and taxed when you withdraw. The good part is more money is in the market for longer but obviously the drawback is taxed when you take it out. Look at what age you are aiming at retiring at because the tax rate will be adjusted at your income level when you retire. I believe that the max annual contribution to a 401k is $17,000.  Another huge consideration for investing is any fee associated with the account. These annual fees are compounded over years and years so if your money is in there till retirement you would be surprised with how much money .25% difference can make.  If you have kids and would like to help em out in college there are similar tax advantage accounts for higher education. Look into a 529 plan.   Back onto the asset thing basically stocks are more of an asset than silver/gold because of that dividend and the compounded interest that isn't really there with silver/gold. Most people say to have ~ 10% of your portfolio into PMs. I went a little silver crazy when I first started out before I tried to educate myself on investing but I am not worried about it. If market crashes PMs will probably go up so I can sell my PMs and re-invest.  TL;DR: An asset is something that puts $ in your pocket, hopefully doing so without you having to sell something."

(1) store of wealth (2) I love shiny stuff (3) for selling if the prices skyrocket  My recommendation would be to buy some if either of the three apply to you.  The general feeling amongst investors is to go for about 5% of your savings in precious metals. I go for about 50%. Some here I'm sure have closer to 100%.

It's all just a matter of what your end goals are and how much, or little, you believe that a commodity has staying power.

People have, indeed, made a lot of money on silver at various times in the past.  When it runs up, it tends to run up fast and very high compared to its previous valuation.

Contrast that to a stock in a company, which generate returns simply by holding them for a long term. You can have the price of a stock remain unchanged over 20 years, and have it provide monetary returns every quarter. Neither silver nor gold can do this, and for that reason I do not consider them  an investment, though I love owning physical silver and gold for diversification and peace of mind reasons."

Silverbugs,39fmc4,ConspiracyFox,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:39:41 2015 UTC,"Precious metals are not so much an investment but a store of wealth.  There are market fluctuations over the short term and so it would be possible to try to buy low sell high type investment but more so over the very long term precious metals keep up with inflation.    If you store cash dollars in your mattress the federal reserve continues to print those and so they continue to lose value.  Precious metals are limited in supply and cannot just be created, there is labor involved in bringing it out of the ground paid for dollars tied to inflation. So precious metals over the long run will always go up in value.  While stocks could go to 0, think blue chips like GM.  Precious metals on the other hand will always have their base value.  Then if you look at the history of fiat money 100% of them have always eventual failed.  So if you put on your tin foil hat, read a lot of history books, research heavily into the history of money and compare that to what the dollar is doing you can make a long term decision on what you think the dollar is going to do.  I found a really good 2.5 hour series on the internet that explains the history of money heavily weighted towards buying precious metals, but it is very informative especially part 4.  worth watching especially considering more people spend longer planning their next vacation than they do their financial future.  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE88E9ICdipidHkTehs1VbFzgwrq1jkUJ  Personally my own opinion and not advice--- The stock market is on a all time high and 2 years overdue for a major crash, while precious metals which have a historically inverse value in relationship to the stock market are at a good low.   My personal investments right now are heavily into precious metals and ill wait till the next crash before I get back into the markets."

The government is trying to round up the surviving coins since they were stolen from the mint after the order came out.  The order did have the effect of making the Eagle series much rarer than their mintages would imply though as most people iirc did cash them out and most of them are now in the bullion bars at Fort Knox.

The rest of his issues with them are unsubstantiated claims unless he provides proof.  Now I shall listen to the rest of his hyperbole and rhetoric to make sure I don't feel the need to edit. This guy is a total blowhard and honestly, I bet if he didn't ""expose"" them, his order would still have been replaced. From what I understand, it wasn't a couple ounce order, any rational person would realize that they need time to do a full investigation. If they needed to buy time, so be it. We allow other entities to do that, and much worse, so why should this company be any different.  I'm happy with the outcome. And now ""stillkeepin1"" will go back to where he was in my mind before someone started this spam/smear campaign. Nonexistent.  If you have an issue with ANY online vendor, report it to the company and have a little patience, especially if it involves more than just a simple USPS insurance claim that can be done online and approved automatically (I know, I've used it).

Don't think they should just re-ship or refund items without seeing what's up.  They can't magically know everything and it's in their best interest to see what happened to his nearly $1k order.  Also I don't think his claims of ""they did it for money"" are super valid.  They're RAKING it in regardless of whoever they lose because of this whole kerfuffle.    Sounds like a complete blowhard indeed... making a big deal out of spreading ""inaccurate information.""  Also seems that he used a thesaurus for a ahem FEW of his sentences to give them some extra oomph.    I feel like large companies mess up due to the huge volume they process..

If I am wrong about that, I'm sure someone will correct me, but I'm not going back to rewatch the first installment to see if I heard him correctly.  So I have been working under the assumption that APMEX washed their hands of this guy LONG before we heard about it.

I'd make several tedious videos to get satisfaction regarding a $1000 loss too."

We shipped his replacement package Friday, June 5, which was delivered and signed for on Monday, June 8. Phone confirmation of receipt happened on June 9.        This one instance does not coincide with our 15 year customer service history or our 99% customer satisfaction rating. APMEX holds customer satisfaction to the highest esteem. Our customers have rewarded our efforts with an A+ BBB rating, 99.8% customer satisfaction rating on our eBay store and 5 out of 5 stars customer approval rating on APMEX.com.       To date, over 99.93% of all packages shipped by APMEX are swiftly delivered without issue. On the rare occasion when a lost or stolen package is reported, APMEX conducts an investigation and resolves the issue based on the results.  We would like to take this opportunity to answer some recent questions.      Q: Is my order safe? - All of our shipments are covered in the case of loss or damage in transit, regardless of order value.    Q: Do you have a process for lost or stolen orders? - APMEX has an easy 3 step process for handling lost or stolen claims.    1) A lost or stolen package is reported by a customer to APMEX Customer Service    2) APMEX, and sometimes our insurer performs an investigation of the shipment    3) Resolution and next steps are decided. If the package was indeed lost or stolen, the customer is asked to sign and file claim documentation with APMEX for reshipment. APMEX then re-sends the customer’s order. If the initial claim is found to be fraudulent, APMEX has the right to deny the claim.    Q: How long does it take to investigate lost or stolen orders? - On average it takes two weeks for the investigation and resolution of an issue.       APMEX is dedicated to our customer’s privacy and as such, will not disclose the details of someone’s claim, order history, or personal information. This commitment to privacy prevents us from responding to specific questions about what happened, though the accounting of this experience is not completely accurate. We can say that this issue with stillkeepin1 has been resolved. If you have questions about shopping on APMEX or our processes you may contact us at (800) 375-9006 x182.        We hope that our record and your experience with our company determine your view of APMEX."

Silverbugs,39dn3m,xMRGRIMMx,3,Thu Jun 11 01:35:06 2015 UTC,Question.   I got these from my GF for my b day.   She got them from provident.   The bar is dirty  inside the plastic and it had a nice dent in it like it was dropped or something.  Don't want to complain because it was a gift.  I know bars will not be perfect but this seems a little odd to me.   What do you guys think.
Silverbugs,39dn3m,Bkmiller75,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:53:27 2015 UTC,How bad is the dent? I probably wouldn't worry about it though. Generic bars usually aren't perfect and that won't really hurt the value.
Silverbugs,39dn3m,bonerfly,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:40:47 2015 UTC,Its bad enough that it bothers me. You can maybe see it on the bottom edge in the pic.   I dont know how to add more pix.  I guess it is more upsetting that it is dirty and damaged.  Not really worried about the value.

Silverbugs,39d3xj,maksimfa,3,Thu Jun 11 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think so.  I looked at the ebay final value fee chart on their site and I think it's the same for bullion or anything else.  I think eBay just gives some ebay bucks back to the buyer to help increase sales.  They're still making money off the seller, just not quite as much.  But someone, please correct me if I'm wrong.  Either way, you can probably convince some sellers to do it... It's worked twice for me today, but I'm about done with my buying spree..."
Silverbugs,39d3xj,DuckFigg,5,Thu Jun 11 00:28:38 2015 UTC,This is correct.  Source: I have been asked to re-list bullion items into Coins:US before by buyers. Final Value fee was the same.  Only the big players get discounts for listing in the bullion category (and then ebay doesnt have to pay out ebay bucks as well)

Seriously, as an American you have it so easy as stackers, I mean, you've probably earned it being the number one economy, for the time being. But sheesh, youve got the dollar, the free shipping and ebay bucks, your metal is easily id guess 5% cheaper than us in Canada, and I think due to VAT about 30% cheaper than our friends across the pond.

Silverbugs,39d3xj,wildruler,0,Thu Jun 11 02:00:09 2015 UTC,"So here was the conversation with an eBay rep.  They say that they are working on trying to implement it for Canadian customers. I questioned what there is to work on as we used to be given it and then it was taken away. She simply kept saying that she is glad I am eager for the promotion but that they are working on it. I also asked about the 10% off coupons, it is completely automated she said. She told me she would talk to her supervisor about the eBay bucks as I kept pointing out how ridiculous it was. Seriously, enjoy the perks of being American you fricken spoiled bastards."

Hell, I think the pirate thing is played out and wasn't going to touch them, but after some of the pics I saw and how artificial toning brought out the details, I had to have a few.

Silverbugs,39blww,Cantilivewhileim,2,Wed Jun 10 22:23:34 2015 UTC,"The MINT stops taking orders the 12th.  Provident and whoever else can sell their stock as long as they have it, just to be clear.

Silverbugs,39blww,L617,1 point,Wed Jun 10 22:53:01 2015 UTC,That is correct. It will take a few months before everyone sells out there stock of them. Premiums will go up and Apmex will keep there premiums a little higher then everyone else. Then when everyone runs out they can add a few more dollars to that premium :)
